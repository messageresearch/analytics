Every tear I shall be address for I know he'll see me through. He said he would I promise I can love all the things he had for those who pray. I just feel like something good is about to.

Barabus so afraid for he knew this was the day judgement would be served and he would die. He heard footsteps down the hall. Then his name was called as a Roman soldier stepped inside. He could not believe the centurion said, "You're free." For he knew he had done these awful crimes. Rabbus said, "How can this be? For I know I've done these deeds." Then the centian rely, "Look up, yonder on the cross. The middle man has paid your cost. See the nails in his hands and feet. He's the reason you're redeemed. See the wounds in his sight. His blood has given you life. The mockery spits upon his face. This is your disgrace. Jesus took your place. Like Barabus, so was I. Sentenced to die. Prison for the crimes I done. Feeling broken and afraid, knowing that I'd have to face judgment day surely come. Then a voice so sweet and kind said, "Let her go. This child is mine. She has no faults. Her record is clean. As I have showed Mira's grace, so have I taken her place. 2,000 years ago up on that tree. Look up yonder on the cross. The metal man is painted. See the nails in his hands and feet. He's the reason you're redeemed. See the wounds in his side. His blood has given you life. A mockery spit upon his face. This was your disgrace. Jesus took your place. Look up yonder on the cross. The middle man has paid your cost. See the nails in his hands and feet. He's the reason you're redeemed. See the wounds in his side. His blood has given you life. The mockery spit upon his face. This was your disgrace. Jesus took your place. Amen. Amen. Amen. We have a third song, especially Alicia Arolo. She'll get ready to sing. But before we do, I'd like to sing, "You're my glory and the lifter of my head today." Amen. Aren't you glad? He's your glory this morning. &gt;&gt; Psalms 3, chapter 3 says, "You're my glory &gt;&gt; and the lifter of my head this morning." My blessings this morning to lead you through your destiny. And you're my glory and the lifter of my head. You're my glory and the lifter of my hand. For thou, oh Lord, art shield for me, my glory and the lift. If he is this for you this morning, lift your hands and sing it one more time. And you're my glory. And you're my glory and the lifter of my hand. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're my glory and the lifter of my heart. Oh, he's a shield for you and I. Lord, thou are glory and the lifter of Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning.

Happy birthday, Brother Rod. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord bless Alicia as she sings this morning. The room grew still as she made her way to Jesus. She stumbled from the tears I held her blind. With such pain, some spoken anger heard folks whisper. There's no place for her kind. Still on she came through the sin that flushed her face. Till at last she knelt before his feet. And though she spoke no words, everything she said was hers. that she poured her love for the master from her box of alabaster. And I've come to pour my praise on like oil from Mary's alabaster. And don't be angry if I wash this fear with my tears. And I dry them with my hair. And you weren't there the night he found me. You did not feel what he felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me. end. You don't know the cost of the yoyo in my buster box. I can't forget the way life used to be. I was a prisoner from the sins that held me bound. I spent my life I poured it without measure into a little treure box that I've found. until the day when Jesus came to me and tilled my soul with the waters of his touch. So now I'm giving back to him. All the praise he's worthy of. I am forgiven. And that's why I love him so much. And I've come to pour my praise on like oil from Mary's alabaster box. And don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and I've dry them with my hair and you weren't there the night he found me. You did not feel what he felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me. And you don't know the cost of the oil and my alabaster box. Oh, when I've come to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's alabaster books and don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and I dry them with my Here, my hair. You were there the night he found me. You did not feel what he felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me. And you don't know the cost of the Oyo. No, you don't know the cost of my prayers. And you don't know the cost of the oil. Am I alabaster? Oh, what a beautiful song that is this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Lord's good. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand. And it's an honor to have brother Steve Clar here to speak for us this morning. &gt;&gt; He's in the house. He's in the house. What's your need today? Oh, he's in the house today. Amen. Please don't go home today without receiving your blessing that he has for you today. Ask and it shall be given to you. Seek and you shall find. Knock on his door today because he has something for you and I today. Hallelujah. Little girl was lying. Little girl was lying there for people sleeping. They just left in Jesus. She said she's only sleeping. As he took her by the hand, she begins to pray again. So begin to praise the Lord. So begin to sing in the house. Oh, death has to. And now there is life where darkness used to be. Now there is and there's no more. I will praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. We were like that labor. So Jesus touched this heart of mine and gave me life again. Now just a house to claim. Ever since that last day, there's a light that shines on me for all the world. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Glorious. Father, we're so thankful, God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That you're in the building today. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we've come to receive from you. And &gt;&gt; we desire, Lord, that you open the word to us. &gt;&gt; Let it not be a man standing here or reading this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. Father, in myself, I have no good gift to give. But Lord, if you'll use the vessel and you will speak through us this morning, I believe Lord, the people can say like those Cleopus and his friend on the road to Emmas, they can say, "Didn't our hearts burn?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was talking with us along the way. Didn't our hearts &gt;&gt; didn't he open the word to us? Did he instill a little more something to the depths of our our being? &gt;&gt; So, Father, we're asking for this this morning, I pray. Father, we remember Brother Ron as he's away on a welldeserved vacation. I pray, Father, that you would bless him and Sister Sandy as they're resting. &gt;&gt; And I pray, God, that there would be a special anointing wherever they are &gt;&gt; this Sunday. May your presence just overshadow them, Lord. And Oh, and just give them good rest. We pray. &gt;&gt; Bless us in your divine presence now. We ask in Jesus Christ's name. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I bring greetings to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And uh we're just so happy to be here. And I I was just really thankful brother Ron extended a invitation to us to come preach. And uh I take it such an honor. He's not here this morning and uh he's just had the the honor to allow me to stand here. So I'm just really thankful this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I see a lot of friends in the building today and amen. My special friend, Brother Don Saunders, God richly bless you. Brother Don was in Canada with us for a couple months and I got to see him an awful lot. And so uh God bless you, Brother Don, and my sister Rosanne and brother John McCaffrey. Good to have family in the house of God with us this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Living with us and uh my son-in-law and my daughter. Amen. That they're here today with us. So, praise the Lord. I bring greetings to you from Brother John Andy's and Sister Sharon. And uh they love you and they appreciate you. And so all that really know them personally. Sister Sharon said, "Make sure that you tell all the sisters, God bless you." Well, um that's not possible. So, I bring greetings that way from the pulpit. th this morning. Praise the name of the Lord. A I'd like to sing one song with you if that's okay if we I have such gratitude to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have gratitude to the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; I've asked brother Dubsy to help me and brother Robert to sing this song. Gratitude. Amen. All our words fall short. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And all of us this morning have got nothing new. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Warren and brother Steve and all the other ministers. God bless you. We've got nothing to give to the Lord but our just a little Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe this morning all of us could just put ourselves forward and give ourselves to the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Let's just not rely on the ministry. Why don't you say, "Lord, I got something to give. I I have come this morning to give of myself." &gt;&gt; Even if it's just a little hallelujah, Lord, that I want to give this morning. All my words fall short. I've caught nothing new. How could I express all my gratitude? I sing these songs as I often do. But the same but you never do. I'll sing it now. I throw up my hands to praise you again and again. Cuz all you have is a highle. And I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else good for a king except for a heart singing hallelujah. Hallelujah. I got for you with my hands stretched wide. Lord, I worship you. Oh, so I throw in my hands. Let's worship in just a moment. We praise you cuz all I have is a highle. And I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing hallelujah. So I throw up my hands. So I throw up my hands. Praise you again and again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I know it's not but I'm nothing else before singing high one more time. Oh I want to throw up my hands Lord. Oh God I want to give you praise this morning. Lord I give all to you this morning. Oh I want to praise you this morning. I want to give you a hallelujah. Praise your name. Glory be to God. Oh, this the least that I can do for you this morning. Oh, it's not much alone. I gave it to you this morning. Hell for a king. It's simp for a heart singing hallelujah. Would somebody in the house like to praise him this morning? &gt;&gt; Would there somebody like to lift your voice and say hallelujah? Praise your name. I give myself to you this morning, Father. It's really not much, but I give it anyhow to you. I lay before your altar. I leave it in your presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise you, Lord. Praise you. Praise you. Praise you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus. Hallelujah. Speak to us now, Lord, by your word as we open the scripture. &gt;&gt; Your presence is here this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; Anoint the hearer, Lord. May you open my tongue to speak this morning. &gt;&gt; I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you have your Bibles with you this morning? &gt;&gt; We'd like to turn to Judges uh sorry, Joshua chapter 6. Joshua chapter 6. And we're going to read one verse here and then you can have your seats. Joshua chapter 6 verse 20. When you have the scripture, will you say amen? &gt;&gt; So the people shouted when the priest blew the trumpets. And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell flat down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's a wonderful thought of scripture this morning. &gt;&gt; The walls came down. &gt;&gt; And they took the city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They took their inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many this morning could say, "I want to take my inheritance this morning." Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The word of God has promised me an inheritance &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take this word &gt;&gt; inside of my heart. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless the reading of this word. We can have our seats in the presence of God. Just to bring a a little context to the to the scripture this morning, the we see in Joshua chapter 6, we see the city of Jericho was it was entirely enclosed and they were an anticipation that there would be an attack from the Israelites. And God spoke to Joshua and and he told him, he said, "Now," he said, "I am going to provide the victory." &gt;&gt; I'm always thankful this morning when God does the speaking and he does the promising. &gt;&gt; Before one brick or one piece of rock begin to move, &gt;&gt; the Lord had already spoken to Joshua and said that you will have the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I look at our lives and I think of us individually and I don't know the battles and the struggles that you are all going through. But one thing I know that the book the Lord has promised us that we shall be overcomers. &gt;&gt; In the season that we're living in, we're so mentally uh bombarded and the prophet would speak a greatest battle ever fought. And we recognize today we are living in that time where there is such mental pressures. &gt;&gt; And there is a time where a a a pressure is coming upon the bride. And one thing we must be assured of in our hearts, not just under an intellectual conception, but we must have it within our hearts that we are victorious. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the Lord has promised here in Joshua chapter 6 that that he would he would look after them and they would be victorious. And the Lord instructed the Israelite warriors now to march around the city one time for six days in a row. Now if you can imagine the the the toil, the struggle, the hardship it would be. We're not talking about now just marching around like the square footage of this auditorium. &gt;&gt; They had to with toil. They had to with great sweat and great pains. They had to march around the city one time for six days. And there would be seven priests there and they would be ready to blow the trumpets, that ram's horns. But the instruction now was there was no blowing of trumpet or there would be no shouting until the seventh day. And on that seventh day, now it wasn't just marching around one time, but now they had to march around seven times &gt;&gt; on the seventh day. And now we come to our our scripture. And the people shouted, a great shout, and the walls came down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, in my heart this morning, I have a shout. &gt;&gt; I I would say to the congregation this morning, can you say amen with a great shout? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, something in my heart is bubbling out. It's not something that any man has to instruct me to do to worship. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not somebody that's got to say, "Will you praise God? Will will you lift your voice?" But something on the inside &gt;&gt; because I already know that there's a victory around been want &gt;&gt; and I'm more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, my thoughts this morning as a sermon title, if you'll just keep it in your heart, is you surround me with songs of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And towards the end of this service, I hope to get to speak on the covenant of the shoe. Now, brother Brandon would say in a message in 1960 in Blind Barnameus, a short quotation, he would say, "By the people shouting and giving praise to God, the walls of Jericho fell down flat, one on top of the other." And then he says these words. He says, "A little shouting helps once in a while." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; My prophet, &gt;&gt; your prophet, &gt;&gt; he said, "A little shouting, &gt;&gt; will help once and a while." &gt;&gt; He says, "It certainly does." And now after the walls of Jericho have fallen flat. Brother Brandham, in this next quotation, he dramatizes a reflection that Joshua might have had when this event happened. The walls came down. And I look at like if it was a little bit of a interview. Hey Joshua, what were you thinking? And he would sit back there and blind bother Brandon and say, "Every stone that I'm sitting on, the power of God took it off the wall." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very stones begin to shake when the power of God begin to move. Now, let me make this statement to you, and I hope that you will agree with it because we're all message believers here this morning. &gt;&gt; But we recognize that there is not a stone large enough &gt;&gt; or a wall that is built big enough &gt;&gt; that faith in the word of God cannot move. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe that this morning &gt;&gt; because I believe in the supernatural power of God. &gt;&gt; And I believe that supernatural power of God is tearing down walls &gt;&gt; in our lives even this morning. &gt;&gt; If you come with a need upon your heart, the Lord Jesus can come right to your seat. We're not just talking about angelic beings now. We're talking about that mighty angel. &gt;&gt; That one that stood with his foot upon the land and the other upon the sea with the rainbow above his head that gave us his word in this hour. That same one, that mighty conqueror, he's in the building this morning. &gt;&gt; And by supernatural power, he can take down every stone and every wall &gt;&gt; that's ever been built up in our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about this word called dunamis power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And dunamis power is a special word. It's used throughout the scripture about 117 times in the New Testament. And it means to have an unstoppable supernatural power that flows from you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An unstoppable force. I'm talking to every brother this morning. I'm talking to every sister. I'm talking to those that are at the age of accountability that have given their life to Jesus Christ. And may I remind you of the scripture that gives us the proof that the power of God is on the inside of us. And that is in Acts 1:8. And ye shall receive power. &gt;&gt; We're talking about supernatural power. Not just speaking about gifting this morning. We're talking about supernatural power of God. And the scripture says after the Holy Ghost has come upon you. &gt;&gt; So it's not just ordinary power. &gt;&gt; I like to use these words. Words are powerful. &gt;&gt; This power we're talking about is explosive. &gt;&gt; This power &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; that you and I know of is lifealtering. Yes. &gt;&gt; When we received God's life, we never were the same again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's It's not just a little feeling or a touch that we might have felt in a breeze that made us feel a little good in the service. This is lifealtering. I will never be the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only am I not the same, but I need a strength in this hour. &gt;&gt; And it's sustaining strength &gt;&gt; that comes to us daily. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; His mercy is new every morning. And as I get up every morning and consecrate my life to him and I ask him to move in my life, it is the Holy Ghost power of God that directs me and sustains me and moves me in the right direction. &gt;&gt; Cannot be of myself. &gt;&gt; This is what we know to be the quickening power in Romans 8:1. that quickening power that raised Jesus Christ from the grave. &gt;&gt; Now I I also want us to see that this dynamo power, this dynamic power is not just for miracles. &gt;&gt; Many times we think about dunamis power and we think about miracles, &gt;&gt; but it's everyday living for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every moment. Can you testify with me of that? Every moment of our day is a miracle. It's deliverance from mental battles. It's power to march. We're talking about now marching seven times around Jericho. It is the power every single day to put the boots on your feet and begin to march for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; But here is the paradox. Unbelievable but true. It comes this power. It comes by a still small voice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, sometimes we look for the thunderouses. &gt;&gt; We look for the earthquakes. We want everything to shake around us. &gt;&gt; But it comes by a still small voice. &gt;&gt; And you know it, brothers. You know it, sisters, that tenderly speaks to you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Speaks into your heart. Can you can you know that understanding &gt;&gt; that he speaks to your heart and he says words like this? I will be with you &gt;&gt; even in you to the end. &gt;&gt; How about this one? Greater is he that is inside of you &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in our text, God has instructed Joshua and the people to shout &gt;&gt; and the people shouted with a great shout and the walls came falling flat. Now, if you think about it for a moment, Israel, that was a multitude of people and their shout was very great. Can you imagine? and put this use your imagination cell for for good use. Think of it now. You got 40,000 men and they all shout at one time. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the sh sound waves that would &gt;&gt; Now let's do a little exercise. Would you like to exercise for just a moment? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I look around the building and I I would say there's a few hundred people in the building this morning. I would want in a one, two, three, all of us to say amen. &gt;&gt; Would that be okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One, two, three. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that was a shout. &gt;&gt; But can you imagine 40,000 men &gt;&gt; making a shout? You know, in 2023 in Seattle where our area, they had a music cont uh uh concert and and the person that was singing the people and the songs and the movement, the clapping and all that was going on, they made such noise that it registered on the recctor scale for earthquakes at 2.3 of a magnitude. &gt;&gt; The place begin to move. But I want you to notice when they all shouted together, the stadium didn't come down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So I begin to think in my heart, it has nothing to do with our vocal cords &gt;&gt; or our enthusiasm. &gt;&gt; The sound waves that came from Israel's trumpets and shouts, well, they shook and I'm sure the walls begin to tremble. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want you to see this. This is very important to me. It was going to take much more &gt;&gt; than noise &gt;&gt; to bring the walls down. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, throughout the message, your readers just like I am. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham gives us a license to shout. He gives us a license to praise the Lord. We ought to shout. &gt;&gt; And he says it would do us some real good, &gt;&gt; right? But now, let me repeat myself. It's going to take a supernatural faith &gt;&gt; in the word of God to bring the walls down of Satan. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to encourage you today with your supernatural faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would and I just say this shortly. Brother Brandham as an example would speak of a little acorn. And I have one on the screen for you. An acorn has all of the potential of being that oak tree, &gt;&gt; but it's in seed form, &gt;&gt; and the seed just needs to be encouraged &gt;&gt; to push out and drink. &gt;&gt; Push out and drink. &gt;&gt; And we this morning have all been birthed by the power of God. And it's my desire to encourage you to take the word of God, the supernatural power of God, &gt;&gt; and drink it in &gt;&gt; and push out. &gt;&gt; Drink it in and push out and we will inherit &gt;&gt; the land. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 11:30, it says, "By faith, &gt;&gt; the walls of Jericho fell &gt;&gt; down." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was after they compassed seven days, they did the word of the Lord. The command is we must do the word of the Lord. If they missed one day of marching, friends, they were not doing the word of the Lord. March seven days of faith believing in the promise of God that said possession is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; The bride, we are the bride. &gt;&gt; We are the last age and we are possessing the gates of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to encourage you this morning, if you're a little light on the possession this morning, let's take it by faith and clothe ourselves in the word of God once again and realize that we are possessing the gates of the enemy. We've won the battle. &gt;&gt; For the battle is not ours, it is the Lord's. &gt;&gt; But each age, now we're talking about the each age, had to march for their day. And we could see the Ephesian church age and the Sardian church age and Pergamos there on the screen I have for you a small picture maybe and thyroyus and sardis in Philadelphia. They all w marched one day &gt;&gt; for their season &gt;&gt; and each marched around. And I want you to notice there was no shouting. It was a march &gt;&gt; in the heat of the day. They marched &gt;&gt; through the dark ages. They marched. &gt;&gt; They took the Bibles. They took the written word of God out of the people's hands. &gt;&gt; And they had those that were committed to the writings of the scripture. They were called murmurous. And they would take a portion of scripture by memory and they would keep it in their mind aresh. And once it came to the time where the Bible could come forth again, they came together and they repeated the words to put it back into script so that you and I have a Bible this morning. &gt;&gt; Can can I give you a little admonishment this morning? It's good to read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; So each one of them marched for their day. But there was a seventh day, the fullness of time. The promise of the word would be open and they would march seven times around the wall. And at that seventh time, there would be a a a jubilee and a time of rejoicing because freedom would come and God would break down every wall. &gt;&gt; The march of seven, of completion. We know this as believers just instilling it back into our hearts. The seventh day they marched, it wasn't easy. &gt;&gt; How many thinks that this lady will see an age is easy? &gt;&gt; Now, this is a a tough day. It's been a hardest day than they ever had. &gt;&gt; We talked about mind battles. You know, you know, to do good, but evil is present. Paul says &gt;&gt; there's a constant battle. The only thing that helps us to know that the spirit of God is on the inside of us leading and guiding us into all truth. And brother Brandon would use that example of the old Indian that would talk about which one would dog you'd feed the most, the white or the black dog. How many remembers? And the little old Indian said, "Well, it's whatever dog I feed the most." And the Holy Spirit is, he's communicating to us, encouraging us today, saying, "Feed the good. Feed the white. Feed the word." Amen. &gt;&gt; And keep marching. &gt;&gt; You know, you need rhythm. &gt;&gt; You need rhythm to march. You need rhythm to to to run. How many long-distance runners will we have in the building this morning? I know there's one sister in the building. I don't know if she'd want me to call her name, but she's a she's a runner. I think her last name would be Lavo. She's a blonde sister. Brother Jesse's a good husband. So, you know, runners when they run, &gt;&gt; they have to pace themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have to learn how to breathe. &gt;&gt; Now, as you could tell, I'm not a runner. Praise God. I'm an eater. But runners know how to pace themselves. &gt;&gt; We are spiritual runners. &gt;&gt; We've taken the baton and we're running the last rep &gt;&gt; lap. &gt;&gt; And we'd have to know that we have to breathe appropriately. &gt;&gt; Do you know I believe this is how you breathe appropriately. &gt;&gt; You breathe faith &gt;&gt; in through your nostrils &gt;&gt; and supernatural out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Faith in, &gt;&gt; supernatural out. This is the life of the believer. &gt;&gt; Faith in the word of God, supernatural out. &gt;&gt; And as we're running, we recognize that we have to breathe properly. If we don't breathe properly, we're going to get a stitch in your side. &gt;&gt; You're you're going to find yourself in problems. You're going to be exhausted. &gt;&gt; But God says, you know what? Breathe properly. Breathe in the word, &gt;&gt; then proclaim. You talk about supernatural, I'm not just speaking about winds. I'm speaking about hands and feet of people doing the same work that Jesus did. The scripture preaches and says, "Proclaim and prophesy." Again, &gt;&gt; we've had the mighty angel come &gt;&gt; and brought a message to an earthly angel, Brother Brandham. And he's proclaimed the word to us. Revelations 10:7 is fulfilled. But there's a portion for us to do and that is to breathe the word in by faith &gt;&gt; and work your life out in the supernatural. Breathe it out. Let the word live. &gt;&gt; This is a new day. &gt;&gt; We don't want to get complicated this morning, but this is a new day. We speak of it being the eighth day or the day of the Lord with things begin to move. And I encourage you this morning. Let's reach our potential. &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like to move forward in our progression of thought. Now, we we talked about shouting, and it's not just something that we do to make noise, but it's supernatural faith. And and so, now we read in Psalms 32:7, it says here that now as the psalmist is writing, he's proclaiming to the Lord, "Thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me from trouble, &gt;&gt; and thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Those words compass, it's round about. It's moving about. It's a movement. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Now, a song. If you stay with me just for a minute, a song. We heard some. Thank you for singing those beautiful songs this morning. I I really is blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A song is near and dear to you, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Most people will say, I'll get up and sing a song if it's something that works in my life or I feel something in my heart to sing about because it's an internal expression. &gt;&gt; It's a prophetic word or a glorification of the Lord. The Hebrew word, and not to get entangled in Hebrew words, but the Hebrew Hebrew word for songs is ran, which means to give a ringing cry from the inside. A ringing cry. Now, that word deliverance in Hebrew is Yeshua, which speaks of an action of redemption and salvation and liberation. But this is where I get excited. Maybe you'll get excited with me. &gt;&gt; Deliverance also speaks of a formal a formal authoritative utterance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A formal. &gt;&gt; All right. I'm serving you notice. &gt;&gt; You know, someone ever show served you notice from the court, it gets your attention. Right? &gt;&gt; I'm serving you a notice. So now, if you'll put songs of deliverance together, what you'll get is resounding cries of a formal authority. &gt;&gt; My goodness, how does that fit in the scripture, Brother Steve? Well, here goes. Jesus said to Satan with a formal authority what it is written. &gt;&gt; Jesus himself used his own words &gt;&gt; against the enemy. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus gave notice to Satan at the cross a formal authority to say these words. It is complete. It is finished. &gt;&gt; The work that I'm done. It is finished. Amen. &gt;&gt; So notice how does that work together with us? Well, we're in our sunship. We're in our placing. &gt;&gt; We're son adopted sons of God. &gt;&gt; And that places us in authority to use a formal authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are we g using against? Not each other. &gt;&gt; Right? It seems like in church people like to use a formal authority against one another. No. No. That's not what it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're serving notice against the enemy. &gt;&gt; Well, we have this authority through the atonement that's made way for a redemption and redemption has made way for our sunship. And now we have a new song to sing. &gt;&gt; We are a people that have a new song of deliverance. And I believe it starts like this. We are hes of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are hes through Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; We are hes with the son. We are that one that Christ in us as adopted sons and daughters of God. Carry the ring upon the our finger saying whatever you say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's time to stop crying so much. We're whining and crying and fing. Stop that whining and crying and use the authoritative word against the enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would use these words. Satan can't hold it if you go to him with spiritual authority word &gt;&gt; with faith and say it is mine. &gt;&gt; That's right. I &gt;&gt; I wonder just a moment if you could think in your heart if there's a pressing need in your heart. Maybe a family member that's gone astray. Or maybe there's something that's happening in your home that Satan's trying to to build a wall or destroy in your home. I wonder if just now you could put it in your heart and say, "Satan, I serve notice." &gt;&gt; And the word says, "This promise &gt;&gt; is mine." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say, "Get him running. Lay it down because we have come with a spiritual authority. I'm a believer. These are words that we ought to speak vocally. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Does anybody ever drive down the road and the enemy come and bombard them in their mind? &gt;&gt; Okay. It's just Brother Steve. I don't know. When I drive down the road and let me tell you, I get hammered sometimes. And sometimes I don't know where the next thing is coming. My mind is all over the place. May maybe someone said something or maybe something done in my life and I brother Robert I just I feel like I'm a basket case but all of a sudden something reminds me &gt;&gt; you have an authoritative word. &gt;&gt; Why are you letting this guy talk to you? &gt;&gt; And we have to use our words cuz Satan needs to hear your voice. I rebuke you Satan in the name of Jesus Christ. I come against you with the authority of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So with people of God, we got to hold our position. &gt;&gt; Hold our position and cry out with this authoritative utterance. &gt;&gt; You know, David, this is before the Holy Ghost came. David, the anointing was so fresh upon him that when Saul was having a a demon spirit upon him, an oppression, David by inspiration, yet not the Holy Spirit there for the day, but under inspiration begin to play songs that delivered Saul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. &gt;&gt; You got to quote the word. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you got to use your word. &gt;&gt; That's why we preach so hard. I know, brother Ron. He encourages us all to read our Bibles, know what the word said. He encourages us to read the message, friend, because that is what's going to get us through. And when we sing these words back, it's a new song, a song of deliverance. It's a meaning from our heart. It's prophetic. And when I quote the word back to the enemy, something takes hold inside of me. &gt;&gt; Suddenly I have a courage. &gt;&gt; Suddenly I'm just there to say, "Oh, where's that cat?" How many remembers that story brother Brandon tells about that mouse and the cat? They were cha mc cat was chasing the the mouse and there around and around they were chasing the house and suddenly they got around the barrel and the mouse fell in the wine. &gt;&gt; And he got a little bit of stimulation. Yes, sir. And brother Brandham lets us know that we need the stimulation of revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? Stimulation of revelation. The new song &gt;&gt; on the inside of our heart. Not an old song. No, the new song of revelation. The word for our day. And when he popped out of that barrel, he looked around, brother Ezra, and he said, "Where is that cat now? I'm ready to fight." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An authoritative utterance. &gt;&gt; We just read there in Psalms 32:7, David's expression, "Thou art my thou shalt compass me about with a ringing cry of deliverance." But now in Psalms 32:8, God gives a response. And the response says, "I will instruct thee." I have you. That's that word. I'll never leave you or forsake you. I I I'm going to go before you. I will instruct you and teach thee in the way that thou shalt go and I will guide thee with mine eye. &gt;&gt; Brother Brando speaks a message that we could take hours on and enjoy about being a guide, the Holy Ghost guiding us and leading us. But the words here is I will instruct you. And brother Brandon in absolute says like this. Before you can have faith, remember we need faith. Before we can have faith, you've got to have something to have faith in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what more can you trust faith in than the word &gt;&gt; of the living God. &gt;&gt; Now friend, when you're sick, you need to start trusting. When you got something going on you in your body and the doctor says to you, you're going to die and there's no help for you or you end up someplace in a mental hospital and you're confused. You've got to recognize in Hebrews 4:12, for the word of God is a quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword. &gt;&gt; Peace piercing even to the dividing of sunder of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and the marrow and the discerner. &gt;&gt; I need a God that gives me discernment in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; The rights and the wrongs and to know what's truth today and it's the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; We have a new song to sing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the next part of our song we already said that we are joined with the father. There's a next part I'd like to bring to you that we could sing. Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it. &gt;&gt; You're a joint heir. Whatever you say, you're going to it's going to come to pass. And these words that we use are shouted loudly. And we sing this new song with an authoritative cry. &gt;&gt; You know my prayer be today. I have prayers while I preach. I say, Lord, I and I have prayers. So I I wrote down in my study, Lord, what would be my prayer? My prayer, Lord, help me to take the word and sing it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let there be a new song come out out of my life so that around me can see the glory of God shine through me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember when Moses met the burning bush &gt;&gt; and he had that burning bush experience and he came walking down the mountain? His face shone like the sun &gt;&gt; that that they had to take a a cloth and put it over because it was too bright. &gt;&gt; My prayer with the Holy Ghost upon us today is that my life shine that way and it may never depart. with Moses, it kind of departed after some time. But in my life, &gt;&gt; young people in your life, &gt;&gt; could it be that you'll go to your schools now? Now it's coming to fall. Or you'll go to the malls or you go wherever you go and the glory of God is so upon your life that all they can see is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so far we've mentioned today that there's been a command to shout and to bring down the walls. Shout with authoritative words for what purpose? For deliverance and inheritance. So, let's move forward if we can just for a few more minutes in our thought. Would that be okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; So in in Joshua chapter 6, we recognize that God told him go. But in Joshua chapter 5, if we stay there just for a m minute, we recognize it's the account where Joshua meets with the captain of the host. And and this is very symbolic and it's very important for us because uh we want to know that that Joshua he was there and he was wondering how he was going to take the land and he was pondering. Now sometimes we make our our Bible characters superheroes but he was really in a place of what am I going to do? &gt;&gt; We've crossed into this land. Now I'm looking over the hill and now there's this walled city. How are we going to get into that place? &gt;&gt; I think that you've looked at your walls in your life, &gt;&gt; places in your in your life and you have no idea how the outcome's going to be. Like you are absolutely Lord, I just got to trust you. I don't know. So in Joshua 5:13, we see Joshua, he met the warrior Dawn, and Joshua calls on, "Are you for us or are you against us?" In verse 14, he said, "Nay, but I am the captain of the host of the Lord, and I am now come." Verse 15, "And the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua, loose thy shoe from off thy foot. Amen. &gt;&gt; For the place whereon thou standest is holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Joshua did so. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to tuck this in your heart just for a moment. The captain of the host said, "Loose thy shoe off your foot." Singular. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you read that? &gt;&gt; It's not shoes. &gt;&gt; It's singular. Shoe. Now, tuck that in your heart for just a moment because there is a difference between singular and plural &gt;&gt; of the foot and the feet. &gt;&gt; So, well, maybe I should just spoil it for you just cuz I don't want you all wandering in your minds. The covenant of deliverance &gt;&gt; comes by the shoe &gt;&gt; and the breaking down of strongholds and the possessing of redemption comes way all by the shoe. But first, I want you to catch this that you already know, but I'm just pretending you don't. &gt;&gt; I want you to see it like this. This was no ordinary angel. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would tell us in Israel in the church 5, he said, "He met Jesus face to face, the captain of the host of the Lord." &gt;&gt; So here Joshua didn't just meet an ordinary angel. He met Jesus in theophony form. Right? &gt;&gt; And there he stood. Now to Moses, Jesus appeared in a burning bush for him. &gt;&gt; We would see God in progression. We would see him of God above us leading pillar of fire by by night and clout by day. We would see God with us and Jesus, the manifestation of the word upon the earth. And then at the day of Pentecost, we see Jesus in us. And we're walking right now with Jesus &gt;&gt; on the inside of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's look at the command that Moses and Joshua were both given. Moses and Joshua were given similar commands. Well, let me help you remember in Exodus 3:5, you will see these words. And he said to Moses, this is to Moses, draw not hither. Put off thy shoes &gt;&gt; off thy feet, for the place where on thou standest is holy ground. So in Joshua's ministry, &gt;&gt; Jesus speaks and he says to him as the angel, "Take off your shoe." &gt;&gt; And with Moses in the beginning out of the coming out of Egypt, he says, "Take off your shoes." Now in Moses ministry, it was the calling out, "Come out of Egypt. Come out of Egypt, and I'm going to take you to the land of promise. Come out. I've called you out and I want you to lay bare before me. This is nothing, Moses, you're going to do. So, you're going to come humbly. You're going to take off your shoes and you're going to be instructed by me. I've heard the cries of my people for 400 years. And I have now come down. I have come down to deliver them. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Moses, it's time for you to mobilize. It's time for you to do your job. It's time for you to go forward as I command thee. So, we see Moses walking as one that is just in pure leadership of God. &gt;&gt; It's like Jesus when he was upon the earth. He said, "I do nothing unless my father first shows me." And Moses was that type of Christ to the people. So, Moses just walked forward and and we realize there is a coming out of Egypt and a going into the promised land. Very important. Come out of her, my people. And there's a going in. Pause here just for a moment. Moses, my servant, is dead. Joshua is the new commission of ministry. And we look at ourselves as our prophet that has come. And the Lord blessed and led him and he was led and guide, opened the word to us. But our service, brother servant, brother Brandham is dead. Who is leading us today? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost, our Joshua. &gt;&gt; We're not looking to another eighth messenger. We're not looking to another man. We have wonderful ministries. We have wonderful men leading us. But it's the Holy Ghost, the dunamis power of God that's leading the church today under a Joshua ministry. &gt;&gt; Now, under Moses's administration, Moses, he sent out 12 spies, remember that? To the land to survey the land. And 10, the majority brought a negative report. What did they say? We can't take it. we just can't do it. &gt;&gt; And two brought a positive report, a proof saying, "Hey, we can take the land. &gt;&gt; It's ours." I know that we look like grasshoppers and they're giants, but we've already it's already been given to us. All we got to do is take it. &gt;&gt; And that was a Joshua and Caleb nature that's represented in the bride today. We can take this land. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say, "Take it." God's promise to you joy, brother. All you have to do is take it. &gt;&gt; You know, he he says like this. He isn't going to poke it down your neck. How many's here that Brother Brandham say that? He's not going to poke it down your neck. You've got to take the land. &gt;&gt; But under the Moses administration, two million of them listened to 10 negative reports. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they did not take the land. They wandered for 40 years. But now here in Joshua chapter 5, God has bringing them into full circle. Now they're back and here they are. And Joshua now sends also spies. But he doesn't send all 12. He sends two. And they under this new administration, they go into the land to see what they can possess of the land. Remember they've got that Joshua Caleb spirit. We can take the land. But I want to stop here for just a minute. Whose land was this that they were going to take? &gt;&gt; It was the Canaanites. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, if you go back in your scriptures, the Canaanites were not of any promise of the land. In fact, you remember they were cursed by God because Noah, remember the story of Noah in Genesis ch uh uh chapter 9, Ham had looked upon his father's nakedness and when he did so, there was a curse that was placed on Ham's seed. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Under no circumstance was an Israelite to marry a Canaanite, a Jebusite, or the itites that were following." And all along through the scriptures, oh, Abraham was looking for a a a a a wife for his his son Isaac. And Abraham said to Eleazaria, "Promise me &gt;&gt; that you won't take a daughter from the Canaanites." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to my family. &gt;&gt; Go take a a bride and be brought back Rebecca back. So God was very determined that no Canaanite was to marry an Israelite. Then we find out further in the scriptures, just to save time, just to paraphrase, we find out that Joseph, you know, he he's he he's sold into slavery. Then suddenly in in in in in Genesis chapter 37, in the midst of the story of Joseph, we break into the story of Judah. And we find out the story of Judah and Tamar. And we see that Judah had married a Canaanite wife. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. That was against the word. &gt;&gt; God had said, "You never should take a Canaanite." And so he gave Tamar, which of the household of Israel, he gave her to his first son, Judah, did. And what happened? That son died. &gt;&gt; Right? Then there's called the law of leverage where now the the the wife or the brother had to make be with the the the brother and she takes him and together they go to he dies. Now there's one son left &gt;&gt; and they're all Canaanites &gt;&gt; from Judah's wife. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But God had said and promised there shall be no Canaanite marry an Israelite. &gt;&gt; So here we go. We find Tamar. She makes herself out to look like someone of illreute. And it was it was through the lust of Judah's heart that he found her. And he went to her. And we know the story. And I want to fast forward the story. Now she has pregnantated. She's got children. And on the inside of the scripture tells her that there's twins. &gt;&gt; But this is amazing to me because God will have a pure line and his word will be fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, as she's giving birth, one of the little fellas, he pokes out his arm and they whim the midwives quickly tie a string upon his arm because according to the law, whoever comes out first or whatever part that comes out first is the firstborn. So out comes his arm. The string was tied around its arm. That little child pulls it back into the womb and out comes the firstborn which is Perez, but he has no string around his arm. Next comes his brother L. I think his name is Lent. And he comes out of the womb. Now he's got the string. He is noted now to be the firstborn. Now according to the law of leverage, the firstb son had to go towards the Canaanite lineage. But Perez coming forth, he went after the nature of Judah and the line. You read it in Matthew chapter 1, he went forward and he became of the household that brought forth Jesus. So God through all of this trouble and struggle and mental cross the hands just like he did by the forefathers and he made it possible that through the law of leverage that one would go towards the Canaanites. He would not be regarded in the household of Israel and the other would go forward knowing that our Lord Jesus would come through that line. &gt;&gt; Great pains God took &gt;&gt; to keep the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Jebusites out of the house of Israel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we find out then that there is a jo uh Joseph when he was in Egypt, he knew Pharaoh and Pharaoh knew him and he was second in command. But there came a time where there was a Pharaoh that would arise that knew not the Lord. How many remembers in your scriptures? &gt;&gt; And we see that Israel now is there as a people and they are under task masters. And we say, "Oh, and they're crying, oh God, deliver us, deliver us." But there was a law in the land of Egypt that said there was not allowing of any mixed marriages. So God in his tender mercy had driven Israel into a situation where they only could bring forth of their own kind. &gt;&gt; And for 400 years, God built a nation. When Abram came out uh uh from his father, they were only maybe 70 people looking. God made the promise, this is your land. I'm going to give it to your people. But the but the the the cup of the Amorites and the Jebusites and the Canaanites, it's not full yet. &gt;&gt; And God, now this is a word brother Brandon would use for our time, but God used it in that time. It was the tender hand of Jehovah that was keeping the lineage, keeping the bloodline, keeping it all pure under the hardship. Oh Lord, come. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he was keeping the people in a place where they were pure line that they could leave the land and now move forward under the Moses administration. But the word of God said, I want you to separate. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Didn't we hear a message the prophet of God preached to us? Total separation from all unbelief. &gt;&gt; We are not to go and take out a denominational system of an ism. We have a law of the Lord to keep yourself pure before him. Not with the deeds of the nickels, not with the things that would so compass around us, but keep yourself in separation to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A total separ separation. I want you to notice this. This is just phenomenal to me. When I when the Lord placed this in tomorrow, are are you doing okay this morning? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, Moses and the group, they marched and they marched, right? Round and round and round and they couldn't seem to get into the promised land. And then we find out that Moses, he struck the rock the second time. He should not have done that. And and and and it cost him his entrance into the promised land. But I want you to notice God did it for one purpose. &gt;&gt; Can you think of it this for just a moment? There was a chosen seed that was sitting inside of Jericho walls &gt;&gt; and she was not a Canaanite. &gt;&gt; She was a gentile. &gt;&gt; And if you want to notice this, that God had placed a little woman. Yes, I'm talking about Rahab the harlot. &gt;&gt; God had placed her in that city. Now, if 40 years beforehand they would have crossed over the Jordan into the promised land, friends, there would been no Rahab the harlot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There would not be a lineage bearer &gt;&gt; down the lineage of Jesus Christ. But by fornowledge, God knew &gt;&gt; that the people had to wander, &gt;&gt; wander in the wilderness, crying unto him, "Wonder." Now, I'm sure the first church age, which would be the Ephesians church age, they wondered, "Lord, we have a we have all the word here. We have all the everything. We could just leave it. We're ready, Lord, for rapture." But yet, they still had to toil and struggle seven church ages to where we are. There was a journey hot terrible &gt;&gt; but Hebrewsap 11:40 says like this God having provided some better thing hallelujah for us &gt;&gt; that they without us they without us should not be made perfect. &gt;&gt; God saw us right here today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not by chance that we're all here today. &gt;&gt; It's not by chance that you came to hear a preacher today that comes from Washington. It's not by accident brother Ron needed a rest and went on vacation. It is by God's fornowledge and plan. All of your life is for by fornowledge and plan. If he did it for a little Rahab woman that was a prostitute. &gt;&gt; What can he do for you? &gt;&gt; Now I want to bring us back to our thoughts about the shoe. Remember the command now, the singular command to Joshua. Take off your shoe. Can I read it to you one more time? Joshua 5:15. And the captain of the host said unto Joshua, "Loose thy shoe off from off thy foot. One shoe off of one foot." So he's got a sandal on just to make it real and a sandal off. And he's standing there. How is it different from Moses? Because Moses was two shoes. Remembering that something special was going to happen under this administration. The captain of the host himself, the Lord Jesus, was standing there and presenting to him the covenant of the shoe. One shoe off and one shoe off. Presenting is the covenant of redemption. &gt;&gt; Yes. It was Moses to take them out of the land of Egypt. God already knew that coming out of her my people with the promise of going into a land. &gt;&gt; But Joshua also knew that he wasn't going to go into the land. And now under this administrative Joshua, he's asking the captain of the host is asking Joshua now to remove your shoe. And he's paralleling it now to what he was going to do in the book of Ruth chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Boaz went up to the town gate. Now remember, Ruth already had come and in the night time and slipped herself beside Boaz &gt;&gt; and made her attentious knows that she was really interested. And then she said these words, "Take the border of thy garment and cover me up." &gt;&gt; We have said, "I'm really interested. Take the border of your word and cover me, Lord." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now there's got to be a redemption process. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To take that old Moabitis. &gt;&gt; So Bose went up to the town gate and sat down there just as just as the guardian redeemer of Naomi and Ruth just came along. Remember the story? And Boas said, "Come over here, my friend, and sit down." And Boas then he also called 10 of the elders of the town and said, "Sit here, too." And they did so. And Boa said to the guardian redeemer, he said, "Now Naomi has come back and you can redeem her, but she also brought along a Mob Moabitis, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, wow Naomi, she's selling a piece of land and it belongs to your relative Emma." So Boaz is you know showing the picture here and he continues and he said if you don't redeem it I will do so but if you do not tell me and so I know and and then the next one that is in line has you remember the story has the right to do the redeeming the next one. So Tob, he's the guardian. He says, "Oh, oh, I'll redeem it." Because he's thinking land, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. An old woman. Boa said, "Okay, on this day, you'll buy the land from Naomi, but you will also acquire the Moabitis Ruth." &gt;&gt; Well, all of a sudden, hang on a second. I can't do that because if I do that, redeem it, it might endanger my own estate. Because remember the law of leverage. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The firstborn would have been have to given towards Ruth's first husband. &gt;&gt; That wasn't good. He wanted the land for himself. It would part it up. No. No. We don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; So verse, are you with me? Did I lose anybody? So Ruth 4:7 it says, "Now this this was the the manner in former time of Israel concerning the redeeming and the concerning the changing for to confirm all things, a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor." And this was the testimony of Israel. So there came forth now the symbolism. &gt;&gt; What did Tob do? You know the story. He took off his shoe and he relinquished his rights. Now, brother Brandham says in this message in 1951 in commission, he says, "Redeemer and a public testimony was to be made before Israel at the gate as Boas kicked off his shoe to show that he would firmly redeem Naomi." And it was redeeming Naomi, but he got Ruth, the bride. &gt;&gt; So good. So good. Now, we want to parallel it back if we could because now we're looking at Joshua and he's looking way across the field and he took his shoe off on holy ground to claim it back the inheritance and God gave him the people. &gt;&gt; Moses brought them ac up to the crossing points, but there was no redemption. And Joshua under the covenant of the shoe took back the land, but he also claimed Rahab and her family under her roof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this picture now, redemption of land, the inheritance of the land, but now also redeeming a bride with the lamb, &gt;&gt; the land, sorry. We see what the captain of the host was foreshadowing for what was to come. &gt;&gt; The captain of the host was God with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The logos of God in human flesh, brother Warren. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the genealogy of the captain of the host that dwelt in human flesh came by Rahab the Jer the gentile which married Salmon and the Israelite from the tribe of Judah and her son Boaz the husband of Ruth was a Moabiti gentile but Boaz and O and Jesse and David came forth and there stands Jesus &gt;&gt; all because of the covenant of the shoe. Brother Brandham says in the breach 1963 he says like this. Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he found he was lost. He had sinned and he had and he had separated himself from God was on the size of the chasm. So he could not redeem it. &gt;&gt; But it took the law of the kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; He had to come. He was our champion of love. Friends, I I want to say to you, we're singing in a new song. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of the champion of love, &gt;&gt; because of the woman's seed. And as he died on the cross of Calvary, he paid the supreme price not just for the land, the inter inheritance of a land, but he also redeemed a bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To go into that land. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the commission, he says, "The debt is fully paid &gt;&gt; and you're excused before God. You're taken out of the pawn shop." That's right. The only thing you have to do is accept faith in Christ and walk out of the pawn shop. That's all. He's our kinsman redeemer. He's presented the shoe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not just shoes. He's presented the covenant of redemption. &gt;&gt; So we see now, friends, as I close, the gentile bride no longer is painted as an immoral woman or a &gt;&gt; Moabitis. &gt;&gt; When we were wandering in a system or in the world, we of were of illreute nature. &gt;&gt; Right? Just like Ruth was, &gt;&gt; we're just like Rahab was. We all had a filthy nature. But because he took off his shoe and he made a promise and he made a covenant, the old man was divorced &gt;&gt; and had died and the sin was paid &gt;&gt; and now we could be married to our kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say like this again in 51 commission. He would say Jesus when he redeemed e Israel, he got the gentile bride. He made a public testimony. He was lifted up between heavens and earth as an end sign right outside the gates of Jerusalem. And there where the supreme price was paid. He was lifted up as that shoe before men. The covenant was made of redemption. There it came forth. There was redemption. All our inheritance was lost. Our health, our strength, our salvation, all was lost back there in the fall. But what? There was redemption at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad this morning that he lifted himself up? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad there that he stood in the gap for you and redeemed you? &gt;&gt; It's not two shoes, three shoes. It's one. Christ himself has come. And we this morning I end with this now in our hearts. We end with this in Revelations 5:9. And they sung a new song. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A song of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's singing a song today? Not a woe is me. Oh, what was way back there in Pentecost and the Baptist church and the Presbyterian. Oh, we were like this. No, it's a new song. It's a song of deliverance. It's a formal voice that says the price was paid. He lifted himself up. He was that shoe. He was that covenant said that I would pay the price for the Moabitis. And she is now clean and she is in the lineage. She is my bride. She is the perfect one. &gt;&gt; And they sung a new song saying unto thou art worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof. Thou for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by the blood out of every kindred. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's all of us. &gt;&gt; Every tongue, &gt;&gt; that's all of us, &gt;&gt; peoples and nations that we could sing a new a song unto God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because you have adopted me, Lord. &gt;&gt; I have become heir of all things. Because you placed, oh God, your life inside of me, that ring upon my finger, I can stand now and sing, Lord, a new song, &gt;&gt; a song of deliverance. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the covenant of the shoe which was Christ raised before the people. &gt;&gt; Father, we we're here this morning. &gt;&gt; You surround us, Lord, with a new song. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; A song of deliverance, a a new song of praise. It's not just a hope. So, Lord, you've given us supernatural to faith to believe in of your word. &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone, &gt;&gt; but by every work. &gt;&gt; Faith in that work gives us supernatural power to live. faith in that word that says the covenant maker is not just just roaming there among us but he's in us and each one of us have a portion of him this gives us overcoming power to live in a such a trying time as we wait for your coming Lord we faithfully wait Lord your word will come to pass it always has always will so we stand firm upon on the revelation of this day. For the revelation of this day has showed us who we are that that we have by fornowledge been chosen just as Rahab or Ruth were chosen. Great pains. And Lord, you all made great pains that we were called out, that we were separated, and that we could live in this new day, the eighth day, the Lord's day, still shouting for joy, and every enemy has to fall. I pray for those this morning. Maybe somebody's got a need and they want to lift their hand before you this morning. Say, Lord, I have a need. I pray father the captain of the host our mighty leader of the holy spirit would come amongst the people and now lord meet every need give give the people the heart that you have already told us &gt;&gt; you're more than conquerors footsteps this possession one foot in front of the other claim the promise take it it's yours redemption has already been paid The atonement has been made. The at onement with you, one with you, Lord, has been made. Bless your people, Lord, as they've received the promise of God in Jesus Christ's name. Would you stand to your feet and sing whatever song you'd like to &gt;&gt; No longer a slave. Let's sing that &gt;&gt; verse one. &gt;&gt; Me with a melody.
