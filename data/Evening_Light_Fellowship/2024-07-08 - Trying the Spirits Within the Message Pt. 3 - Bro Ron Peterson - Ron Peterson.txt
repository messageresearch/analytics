months has been very hard for him he's not had quality of life and uh he was struggling she took him to the emergency room last night 5:00 this morning cardiac arrest so pray for the family now Sister Carrie and the girls have been on vacation they do not know yet and so they're on the airplane traveling home now and I ask all the whole church do not text or call because sister Jan wants to let them know herself okay so just wait until probably the end of the day I don't know what time they arrive today but the girls don't know um and uh so we're just praying um so pray for sister Jan also I ask her how she's doing she said brother Ron I'm I'm doing pretty good and and uh but uh yeah Amos came into my back office and he said just think he said brother Johan and brother James [Music] Weeden and brother Dave are having their Men's breakfast life is but a vapor amen it goes by so very quickly and those of you that have gray hair amongst us realize it was just yesterday you were a kid you were young you were running you you know then you got married then you thought well I'll probably never see children then you have children I'll probably never see them grow up they grow up I'll never see them graduate they graduate I'll never see them get married they get married things just go by like that so be praying for the family pray for me this morning too the Lord help me because it's never easy I as a pastor carry very uh big burden on my heart for the whole church amen so if you just remain standing and turn with me to the book of First John 1 John chapter 4 amen thank you musicians yeah enjoyed the songs amen if you understand those songs one of them and who I am have to deal with identity this message has brought to you an identity of who you are where you come from where you're going it's all about positioning and placing once you know who you are you take your position in the body of Christ doesn't mean that things are going to be easy doesn't mean that the road is not going to have some bends some turns some potholes some different things that just may turn you around but you know what God is our God and you know what uh when it's all said and done when your heart stops here all of a sudden you will break into a whole another dimension Hallelujah brother Mike sister py it's good good to have you here I think I miss you every time we have service I think about uh how that God sent to us this message I remember the first time I heard it something struck 18y old kid set my heart on fire everything is about positioning and placing and since that time I've been tried my very best to just stay in my position be faithful love God raise my children and nurture and admonition of the Lord go to church and do those things which is right and is pleasing to him amen and uh so we're going to continue on with this thought here about trying the spirits that are within the message and I want you in 1 John 4 and one let me see I could get my glasses here 1 John 4:1 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world turn with me if you would to the book of Galatians Galatians my wife and I having our devotion yesterday morning we were in the book of Galatians and it was so fitting as I was reading this with her in our devotion I thought I would read it this morning also Galatians 1: 6 through uh 12 I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you under the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a cursed as we said before so I say now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be a cursed for do I now persuade man or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet please men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after men for neither I received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ amen that is the way that the church and its foundation is built upon turn with me Revelation chap 2 very last book of the Bible Revelation chap 2 verse two I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and now how thou can not bear with them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars may God add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord continuing on I'm going to go quite quickly I've got quite a bit of um ground to cover this morning and I want to title again the sermon as trying the spirits within the message part three and the subject of discerning of spirits now I want to say that my time of navity and innocence is long gone I've got experience I've been down the road a few miles I've been here done that I've seen others rise up come go and the prophet of God says I look and I see the heaps of ministers and wrecks alongside the road because they failed to go into this thing correctly amen so I'm speaking to you this morning as an elder as one who's experienced who looks at things perhaps a little bit differently I'm not so quick to you know just Embrace everyone anymore and say oh yeah everybody's in the message now let me see fruits first amen and I want you to know that we have now entered entered into the greatest time of deception the message has ever known yeah we're here we have arrived we're at the time as it's been in every age that after the messenger comes preaches his message gives us thus sayeth the Lord and after he departs guess what you have the Grievious wolves that come in among you wolves and sheep's clothing they say and act so much of the time that they say oh I'm of God I've got a word oh God showed me this God show me that and they add to and take away from the message of the hour and next thing you know it's no longer per uh pure becomes hybrid and loses its power it's the most deceptive time brother Brenham told us he said look and I just am going to quote the quote to you again he said when the true church gets a true revelation of who she is it's all about identity Revelation is bringing to you identity identity brings to you placing positioning amen when she gets a true revelation of who she is and begins to discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit that is within the framework of the church so like I said this is um a very sobering message this is not one of these messages that will get you all excited and jumping and shouting no it's a warning warning than judgment when brother brenon preached certain sermons there wasn't a lot of shouting trying to do God a service anointed ones at the end time he began to preach sermons that gave you warning and began to set the path straight so that you understand that there's coming a time when these false prophets false teachers will come on the scene and they as the scripture say will deceive the very elect except that God shortened the days so God shorten the days because there is so much deception and I'm going to go into this and I'm not going after any Minister I'm not going after any Doctrine any church in particular I'm preaching the whole Council of God so I don't want anyone to think well he's preaching about this one or he's preaching about that one and those that listen to the sermons on the internet who may be not even part of our church or whatever and they're just kind of checking me out that's good I want you to I want you to check it out I am not a novice I've been around around and I kind of feel like Joshua who's been into battle so much that finally the angel of the Lord stands there before him an angel stood there before Joshua and guess what Joshua did he drew his sword and he put it right on him and he said are you for us are you against us he'd been in battle so much are you for us or you against us he said Nay put up your Joshua I am the captain of The Lord of hosts thank you Lord I thought I was going to have to fight another one now um in the sermon the spoken word is the Original Seed I'm going to give you some quotes we're going to go quite quickly and those that are on back there brother Yesa just stay with me because I'm I'm going to go quickly and um let me get this here so what this was both physical and spiritual with Eve first and any time anytime that a woman takes a wrong step I'm talking about Christ and the bride are we together he's saying look I'm talking about a physical room womb spiritual womb and anytime a woman takes a wrong step I'm talking about Christ and the bride but anytime a woman takes a wrong step she has to First receive it in her mind right some Slicker has to persuade her she listens to it against her own better judgment then the ACT is committed so first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind and then the womb of her mind she doubted God's word then come the actual act the Bible says and the serpent beguiled and she did eat begal means to seduce with words that's what he did he came by Brother R said it could have been hundreds of years he just kind of sitting and chatting with her and hey Eve and on and on it could have been but he used words God uses words Satan uses words did not Satan himself use words to the Lord Jesus himself cast yourself down for it is written but Jesus said it is also written amen imagine tempting the word with the word now watch this because we're going to take this into something here that I want all of you to understand how is spiritual adultery committed ah I tell you what I am not so quick to just let somebody come in here add to and take away and these Ministers of the message and if you're listening to me I want you to listen Okay that you start adding to and take away from the word of God I'm against you I'll draw my sword right and I'll say are you for us or you against us you think I'm going to sit there and let you play around one of the biggest things that's a biggest stumbling block the message has ever seen is the internet you got every false prophet every false teacher and all kinds of anointings and all kinds of churches and this and that and everybody's click click click next thing you know and it's like Elijah said why halt you between two opinions brother see years ago you really didn't hear about what who was preaching and what they were preaching and how they was preaching and everything but now you can just click click click and go to all over the world just listen to anybody and everything but I'm zealous over this church and this message with a Godly jealousy and I get angry I get upset when I see people even the congregation sitting there and gulping down things that are con contrary to the word of God swallow a camel strain it a net excuse me now brother Brenham goes on spoken word is the Original Seed there's a womb in the physical there's a womb for the spirit do you believe that there's a spiritual womb and physical womb the mind is the womb to the spirit that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you knowing better by the word of God by the Intercourse of the Mind take a lie of the devil against the word of God that's exactly what 've done with spiritual intercourse first she come by believing Satan's lie into the womb of her mind that polluted her soul set death in the soul then the then the a natural act taking place that's the only way that a woman can ever commit adultery against her husband first let some man talk her into it then receive another man that's not her husband then she's committed adultery and when the Bride of Jesus Christ lets man-made Creeds and dogmas take the place of the word of God she's committing adultery no adulterers nor fornicators will make it into the kingdom of heaven anytime you substitute anytime you interject anytime you misinterpret misplace a word you are guilty of adding to or taking away from the word of God and you're committing spiritual adultery on Christ's Worden we have entered now into the time of Matthew 24 we are in the Fulfillment of Matthew 24 many false prophets false teachers have been scattered out throughout the message each one of them gotten their own little thing trying to pull off little groups here and there and I got my stuff too and I oh you need this you're not making a Rapture unless you come follow me I beg to different with you brother R said a little old washer woman with one tape can make it how in a world you got to sit there and you listen the Revelation you need is the Revelation you get from Jesus Christ himself it ain't you don't get it from me you don't get it from any preacher it ain't because you belong to this church or that church you belong to Christ and he alone has the sovereignty of showing you the revelation of who he is thank you Lord when you know who he is you know who you are amen amen all kinds of false prophets false Christ showing Great Signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they'll deceive the very elect my is this serious you better believe it it's serious so just sit down and listen let me give you an example of some of these Eighth Day Messengers ones who say oh H you know the prophet of God said it will not be two of us here at the same time why if I fulfilled what God want me to do guess what not be two of us here at the same time perhaps I've laid a foundation for another one to come after me I'll tell you what he laid a foundation but that Foundation was for the son of man that's the one that come after him was the son of man himself amen I have met so many of these Eighth Day Messengers I'm embarrassed they're in every country not just here in America I met them in Belgium and Holland France I met him I've I've met Joshua and calebs uhhuh I've met them I've I had different ones say I'm Joshua I'm Kaleb in fact they are that type Spirits the one that split brother brenham's Church prior to the opening of the seals according to a vision remember he's out there he sees his front yard all T up and the two closest men to him his manager said well where are you going to go because according to the vision go west you're going to meet with seven angels well where are you going well I kind of like there's two places as a cowboy as a Young Man Prescott and wiinberg they wound up choosing Prescott next thing you know 60% of brother brenham's church was split they moved to Prescott and the influence of those two men told their followers brother bram's the type of Moses he saw into the promised land but didn't walk so we're taking you into the promised land now you can burn your tapes and books cuz we got thus sayith the Lord for you and anybody that ever tells you that that this message is old mana and that you can burn it in your tapes and books let me tell you there is but one Angel messenger there is one prophet of this hour that was sent to turn your hearts back amen not another Prophet this ain't no eth day messenger Eighth Day Prophet Eighth Day message no sir it's seven Church ages seven messenger seven angels and there is one major prophet to this generation Moses and Elijah every country I'm Moses I'm Elijah you need to follow me I'll tell you what brother Brenham said we the two witnesses I even had them in my church in Texas yeah just a young boy here I was preaching and stuff I I didn't think I'd come up against stuff like that next thing you know I got some brother Anointed with a spirit and you talk about how he he would listen to the tapes of brother Brenham I told you before his wife went ahead and made him a garment made it a many colors like Joseph's Garment of many color he had a staff and on top of the staff he had a uh LED pyramid and he had his Walkman you remember the old Walkman well you could have these LEDs that when brother Brandon's voice he said good evening friends it would light up the pyramid on top of the staff and the staff was so many cubits oh everything was so spiritual and he walked at night because he said the word is a lamp unto our feet so when brother Brenan would talk it would light up around him and he'd walk around at night can you imagine well he came to church one day and said I'm I'm the Elijah another brother in the church said you can't be the Elijah I'm the Elijah and he influenced the other brother and said you need to burn that staff and everything he had batteries what what happens to batteries if you burn them yeah they explode yeah capish you understand he takes this he takes his staff he takes his Rob he puts all this stuff into fire and the one Prophet saying to the other PRI you need to burn that stuff so when he he was there and they were burning it all of a sudden guess what bow bigo explosion and the brother had a little pocket New Testament uh in his pocket right here and and the fire hit it and and bounced off in his his pocket got burnt he said but look see the word the word had saved me oh my I've had different ones I said when did you become the Elijah when Joseph Brenham shaved his beard what yeah that Spirit went from him to me so now and I said well Z yeah a prophet's got to have a beard since when's a prophet going to have a beard oh all of this kind of stuff what I'm saying saints of God we're talking about anointings we're talking about people sincere now I want you to understand let me see if I finish this because yeah in the Ephesian Church age go I'm going to show you remember brother Rand laid a a paper in the Cornerstone of his church look at this Ephesian Church AG now I believe in 27th verse I have not shun to declare unto you the whole counsel of God now listen what this this is a prophecy I'm going to go down a little further for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among not sparing the flock also of your own elves watch that man could look down through that and see that coming and of your own selves men shall rise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them I'm going down to paragraph 84 Ephesian Church age these false Apostles are Grievous wolves that Paul spoke of once I'm going to uh I am gone once I am gone they will try to come and claim equal Revelation but their purpose is not to help you but to destroy you then he quotes Acts 20 for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves men shall arise speaking perverse things their own words and ideas not Gods to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn every one of you day and night with with tears paragraph 95 Ephesian Church age now Paul was a prophet taught by the Holy Ghost if Paul baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ said anyone that said that did different from his preaching was a cursed then it is a time to wake up and see that the church is no longer in controlled by the Holy Ghost but controlled by nickan anybody know what a nickan spirit is to conquer the leoty you think God's going to let you stay as one happy family they going to send in Devils among you like I had a cartoon p uh character one time they showed a big devil behind a desk and all these little Devils out there in front of him he had his finger up like this and a little caption below it says and remember this quote lots of scripture because will not Satan's Messengers transform themselves into angels of light oh I'm a message believer I'm a message preacher God's spirit brings unity and Harmony within the body of Christ amen this message has brought a Unity to the Bride of Jesus Christ we are one body we are baptized into one spirit is that right now the devil don't want you to stay one body because a nickan spirit is going to come in there and Conquer and one of the spirits that is an antichrist spirit is to divide and conquer so when you see that this little group comes up and they got some exclusive Revelation you're not a part of it you're not going to be in the bride you have to believe this ministry you have to believe this or that what is it doing it's dividing the body and every one of these isms that have come within the message we'll talk about that we'll elaborate on this but every one of them pulled off disciples after themselves they're still doing it today right Satan will not let you stay one happy family I printed this out I didn't give this out to the Brethren so don't try to find it brother Yesa because I'm just reading it this is um one where brother Ram says a word to the church he said love one another but now let me give you my warning Satan won't let you stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring in somebody and make him his Target he'll bring some critic unbeliever sit down and cause him to fellow fellowship with you under the quiet and things and then he'll shoot that guy full of some kind of poison and stuff he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with it you stay right loving sweet and kind to one another stay with your pastor he's ordained of God the enemy will come that devil is using an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's right don't ever become clannish don't make yourself clannish that's happening now we've got tapes on that he says you got tapes on discipline in the church how you be behave yourself in the Church of God how we got to come here to get together sit together in Heavenly places whatever you do don't stay home that's a problem today we got a lot of people home churching don't have to come subject to nobody just stay home and uh you become your own Pastor next thing you know there's you have denominated don't take a preacher to make a denomination just takes one with his own own ideas contrary to the prophet of God brother Brandon will the bride of Christ listen to me now will the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the coming of the Lord yeah sure uhhuh what is it it's Ephesians 4 Apostles prophets evangelist pastors teachers so anybody tells you to just stay home and press play it's already it's wrong because he'll deny he'll just let you have a four a onefold Ministry not five-fold just the prophet well let me tell you that Prophet said there's a five-fold Ministry there's Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers whatever you do don't stay home and Co just went ahead and made an excuse for many people to work from home Church from home that's true and just live stream I streaming is okay it's a substitute but there ain't nothing like being in church sitting under a live Ministry with a minister that's that's hearing from God and got something on his heart next thing you know he's Discerning your heart and he's casting a spirit off of you and you didn't even know you you had one on you so next thing you know you'll think a little wrong your brother or sister let me tell you get out that root of bitterness don't ever have a root of bitterness among you used to be years ago it's pretty naive as young man in this message you'd come go to a convention and you'd travel halfway across America to go to a convention there' be churches in different ministers and hey we're all together this one big happy family within just a year or two this one's split from that one that one split from this one and they're shooting at one brother Brenham said hey the Bride of Jesus Christ is one amen and he said bride will not persecute bride he said the devil he says has got you shooting at one another he don't even have to come against you why you're just shooting at one another God help us I'm not asking everybody to agree with me I'm just asking you to agree with the word amen let me show you say you want to find it in scripture I'll show you you want to see how a nickan spirit comes in 1 Corinthians chap 1: 10-15 now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you all speak the same thing that there be no divisions among you that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind same judgment for it hath been declared unto me of my brethren by them which are of the House of Khloe that there are contentions among you this is a first church first church age now this I say that every one of you saith I'm of Paul I'm of Apollos I'm of sephus and I of Christ is Christ divided was Paul Paul crucified for you were you baptized in the name of Paul I thank God I baptize none of you but Chrismas and gaas lest any should say I baptize you in my own name happening in every Church age it's happening in this age too spiritual immaturity you're no longer babes having a sincere milk of the word but you're spiritual adults able to take strong meat this is strong meat if you're one of these that's just on the sincere milk of the word you may gag at some of this well just spit it out and wait a little bit later till you get some of these then you start chewing on it amen I'm of Paul and I of apost us I pray that you will become mature adults in Christ watch what 1 Corinthians 3 verses 1-4 and Brethren I could not speak unto you as spiritual but as un carnal even as babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hither to you were not able to Bear it neither yet are you able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envyings and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men for while one saith I'm of Paul and another I am of Apollos are you not carnal carnality who's your pastor what church you go to my pastor can beat your pastor our church is bigger than your church God help us Amen in Galatians 3 And1 The Bible says oh foolish Galatians who ha Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth oh my now let me just go over a couple of these things that have caused divisions among the body of Christ and if you haven't seen or been affected by one or more of these doctrines you will be just hang on how about the peria any of you hear about the peria different ones say well uh brother Ron why don't you tell us all the things that are wrong with these false doctrines now remember they're going to have a vast majority of truth it's just a small element that makes it an airor next thing you know you got a little group of the Pria they're all over here and boy you got to listen to these tapes and you got to follow this guy or you're not going to be in it how about the seven Thunders a went through America like wildfire then it went over into Europe then it went over into Africa until boy I tell you big old crowds and all kinds of anointings seven Thunders and there what's the listen brother Brenham said the truth about the seven Thunders he said it'll be these mystery Divine truths that'll literally turn your hearts back right but you get a Scarrow right don't get upset at me you put your long face on me I tell you what I'd rather tell you the truth and have you understand it then be going out here and embracing all of this stuff next thing you know you got a demon Spirit on you and you're following some false Propet and you're out here jumping and shouting and screaming and coming up on I'll tell you what you be be a be I'm going to share something with you as a pastor some of those that shout the loudest sometimes got evil spirits amen some of you thought oh boy I better be careful here you remember in our church on Maryland we had a single brother coming to our church always sitting about third fourth Pew back I'd be preaching Hallelujah I'm sorry Sarah but that's what would happen to everybody in the church do you remember that some of you Oldtimer hallelujah boy I had different ones said brother Ron I got to sit somewhere else because this brother scares me to death and he come into church every every huh just as Meek and humble never came and fellowshipped with us after church and came in right time for service when service was over he left hallelujah praise God till I had a little sister who she was in a wheelchair and different things well next thing you know she called me up can I talk to you Pastor this guy's been stalking me this guy's been sending inappropriate things telling me inappropriate things I said oh my and I I I I I thought oh boy I better get better get some deacons together I had the sister come and she told us different things and I said oh my we got an issue here so you write those things down the Bible says let everything be confirmed by two or more witnesses not just one but I thought oh my I don't know nothing about that we had a brother in the church who he had a friend in the police department cuz none of us knew anything about him where'd he come from where's his background has he ever been married he's got kids where's his family we didn't know anything so run a police report all of a sudden a big old rrap sheet comes out here I had a meeting had the deacons and different ones in the back room Hey brother what about this and I you've been saying this and this this that's a lie I didn't say any of that she's not telling you the truth well the Holy Spirit In Me was saying this is a lie like ananas and saira you're denying it and I wound up that I said Hey Now saints of God listen excuse me if you think this a little bit rough I told him I said brother you're going to have to go somewhere else because I can't have you I said said you don't even recognize the spirit that you're packing and everything and I had a a young brother who came to me and he withstood me and I was his Pastor I don't think it's right brother Ron people's past and the things that they do and everything and everything what about the blood of Jesus I said I understand blood of Jesus Christ cleanses a man from all sin but I said he's he's not even admitting guilt so this brother he withstood me and he he said and and go you know God blessed this young brother because he always stood for the underdog be careful who you choose sides with he felt well there's nobody here on this brother's side and he's such a humble brother next thing you know um I had told this brother I said please I'm going to ask you I had him sign the letter please don't come to church any longer about three days later he died the young brother in my church still going to my church said hey there's nobody to take up a an offering to bury him he's got no family no NEX of kin he's just a ward of the state he came to your church Ron why don't you take up an offering bury him let's have a memorial service I said no I said just like ananas and saf you remember he said Hey listen to the footsteps of those that went and buried your husband they're coming to get you now and she gave up the ghost huh we we're talking about the Gospel of Jesus Christ Christ and he was the loudest Shou us one that we had now be careful sometimes they put a mask on of having a form of godliness but denying the power of thereof how about just five-fold Ministry only you don't even have to listen to the tapes cuz a fivefold Ministry will'll tell you what the prophet of God said you don't got to listen I'll tell you just pay me and I'll tell you no way no because there's a balance between the tapes and the fivefold ministry somebody say Amen on that then it split up fivefold ministry and them going to church and then a group makes themselves tapes only and yet they still go to church you ever any of you know of a tapes only church where they just go hey you come here and guess what we don't have a pastor we just uh brother brenham's our pastor and on and on and so we'll just play a tape they believed in going to church until evolution of time until they don't go to church anymore they just stay home and play a tape I want you to see how divisions come in among the church and next thing you know and look so innocent I could ask any of you do you know anybody that's been in these movements do you know anybody that split up or disfellowshipped with you because you didn't agree with the way they were going how about return Ministry brother Ram's going to come back and when he does he's going to preach a seventh seal he's going to get into Moses's airplane he's going to kill the brown bear he's going to do this and this he's going to go to the White House give them thus sayth the Lord on and on and he have you ever seen the Mosley's airplane out here is yeah you can go see it it's here in Arizona it's a it's a big old Boeing star Cruiser the last three call letters are 777 do you get it are you spiritual it's a star Cruiser brother brandham God told us to buy you an airplane so we can fly you around well brother if God told you cuz this is their testimony God told us to buy you an airplane what do you think brother brennam would say if God told you to buy me an airplane buy me an airplane did he ever fly on it did it ever happen oh I want to ask you let's just say brother Brenham came back and returned Ministry resurrected came back and he's going to preach and everything do you think he's going to fly around and old dilapidated tail dragger twin engine why brother he's he'll have something better than Air Force One do you see what I'm saying in fact let me tell you he's going to travel like a thought huh we're talking why would you let somebody talk you out of the supernatural in a resurrection Ministry okay we're talking I have seen people say I will stake my eternal destination on brother brandham coming back in a return Ministry he's going to preach in the tent yeah it's going to be a big tent going to fly around the airplane they even knew what ministers are going to sit on what position in the airplane now I know saints of God and I know that some of this is a little bit hard to hear because really you know what it has divided the body of Christ so many times and what happens with people when they follow one of these de exclusive Revelation Ministries and they go for so long and just like a wave I'm a surfer man you guys know what it's like to take off on a big wave and you got all the power and you stroke off into that wave and as soon as the surfboard catches the momentum or the power of that wave you take off come down to the face of that wave you make turn and guess what woo yeah wow me CU you got power with it but what happens to the wave you ride it and it keeps going and it goes further and closer to Shore and that big old wave what does it do it just it's losing its power until funny comes up and it goes right up onto the shore and goes onto your little toes and then it recedes back well that's what's happening with a lot of these movements a big powerful movement big wave yeah but then you just keep writing and writing and H and pretty soon it's just a little trickle but then watch there's coming another one somebody else going to rise up with something else so you got the the one now press play it's happening and affecting churches All Over America and Africa right now is really affecting them just press play and Obey stay home can you imagine the Bible says forsake not the assembling together and yet you're going to let me ask you a question from Genesis to Revelation did God ever used the son of a major prophet God never did never will I'm sorry I don't follow the brandom family I follow the message fact when Brother Joseph and I withstood one another on the the ability to copyright the message I said how can you copyright what is God's I said if this was your daddy's message you copy it but don't I said you you better change the name it ain't voice of God it's a voice of William brandom and you can have every royalty and you can make money and you can sell every book and every tape and you can make money because it was William brandom's message brother R said I ain't got no more to do with this message than nothing against my own better judgment I want to go up and be a Trapper why he got to see all the nonsense people baptizing in his name people thinking he's Jesus Christ he said why he says uh I I thought it was a joke until I found out it was some of my best friends oh we know who you are William brandom it's God manifested In the Flesh here it is mdcs come down and the next thing you know what you do you take it too far next thing you know you've made brother Brenham God you know baptize in his name guess what the new name is written on the stone William brandom wow yeah so let's get baptized in brother br's name and it's pulled people off well what happens after this whole wave finally just go where where do those people wind up hitting the ditch that's why this is why I'm trying to preach it to you straight this is why saints of God you better thank God that you have a minister that's not appear here to just tickle your ears I'm going to go show you some things here because brother brm said this is a prophecy now I'm going to show you some stuff here in the seventh seal 1963 brother BR picks it up I've held that word look at every Vision everywhere the day I laid that Cornerstone Yonder I put that in there wrote on there what he showed me that morning in a vision that morning in a vision be instant in season out of season Reb rebuke with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall Heap up for themselves to uh together teachers having itching ears and not and be turned away from the truth unto fables that's the seventh seal 3 months later he preaches flashing red light of the sign of his coming but today they don't want to hear a message like that people don't want to hear that they want to be tickled in their ears exactly what the here Holy Spirit told me that the day I laid the Cornerstone in there to preach the word be instant in season out of season for the time will come when they will no longer endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall Heap for themselves together teachers having itching they shall be turned to fables that's exactly what it's turned to be see the time will come when they'll no longer endure sound Doctrine it's time to discern Spirits try the spirits see that if they be of God God does not hand down spiritual lineage excuse me spiritual gifting by physical lineage never did use the son of a major prophet never he's the same yesterday today and forever from Genesis Revelation amen the closest thing we have to that are are the sons of Eli and the sons of Samuel and the people came to Samuel and said thy Sons no longer walk in the ways of thy father I'm shock you for a moment the most brokeup family right now divided within the whole message is the brandom family wake up and smell the coffee and if you don't believe me go ask some of the brandom's do they all go to church what about Joseph's own son Isaac what about him does he go to church what about the grandkids where are they are they all going to the Tabernacle are they all staying home and pressing play it's so broke up and divided and I'm sorry that's a shocker to a lot of you but I don't use the brandom family as my measuring post amen God never did he the son of a major prophet that's why when I went to work for Brother Joseph I told him I said I got more scripture against you that you'll go wrong then you'll go right I said but nevertheless I said I'm working for you I said so you just tell me what you want done and I and so for there in Europe for about three and a half years we ran the only voice of God office outside of Jeffersonville anywhere in the world first one Joseph inherited a work we were already doing and brother Mike it was your your brother brother Floyd that sent us because Brother Floyd Patterson was the publisher of spoken word Publications any of you remember spoken word Publications you remember if you were going to get a book and you wanted this uh any of the books of brother Ram you remember the old spoken word books with the eagle on the back used to be that that's where you if you wanted to get books you had to go to spoken word brother Roy borders well brother Roy borders got sick and he was dying he told Brother Floyd you become publisher Brother Floyd took it over about a year and a half into it and Brother Floyd did ask us to go to Europe so my wife and I packed it up how old was I when I moved to Europe Sandra 32 just a young kid 32 years of age go over there with three of my kids made $750 $700 a month living in Europe then Joseph brandham comes along year and a half later he wants to take it from Brother Floyd Brother Floyd said no I won't do it Joseph went to Billy Paul and said I want to start my own publishing company and brother Billy Paul wrote a check that day for $60,000 to buy the first web press when Brother Floyd found out about it he said I'm not going to fight the brandom family for for for this he turned it over to Brother Joseph Brother Joseph took it changed the name voice of God recording fine so he inherited he and brother Billy Paul came over to Europe said brother Ron will you continue on doing this because what I'll do is I'll send another brother from Jeffersonville he'll take over if you can go another six months I said fine six months turned to three and a half years until finally and I'm going to be just so honest with you guys I was on the inside of the inside close to the family voice of God and I saw and heard things that troubl me so bad I said father let me out before I backslide because all it takes is a little bit of time you be with somebody and next thing you know they call this the message brother Paul we were fellowshipping the other day you're a young boy about 18 years of age you go to Europe you're you're you're fellowshipping with the young kids the pastor's kids and stuff these are kids in Europe back when you was just young boy and you go out to dinner and fellowship with these kids and they're drinking alcohol and you're going whoa is that right brother Paul I said oh God because I've never doubted this message because this message is Christ I've never been offended by anything what brother BR said oh there's been some things that has cut me to the Bone and everything but I've said yay and amen I said yes Lord I have never ever this message has never offended me but the Believers within it h I tell you what that's why some of the young people look at the people within the message and say if that's the message I want nothing to do with it but you know what it's happened with Jesus Christ you had all kinds of different ones that after he left guess what hus and philetus pull away disciples after themselves making the the faith of some shipwreck the Bible says having made the doctrine said that the resurrections already passed this is your Bible we're giving you Bible examples I'm going to give you another Bible example here I better keep going the ministry was changing because God was purging the church except there be a great falling away right there had to be a falling away first the shuck is not air with the wheat there's got to be a purging of this message all kinds of carnal impersonations brother brandom the angel of the Lord said hey don't get your line Tangled Up in times like this and quit trying to teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things oh well I'll tell you how to fish here's how you do it first second pool you remember that he said all you've done William brandham has caused carnal impersonations everybody's got a gift in the hand everybody's got to have prayer lines all this kind of stuff he said one day I'll I'll show you how I was disobedient to the Angel and the angel rebuked me sh this is that third pole don't explain it leave it alone brother renam in the seven seal he says you should have caught that the other day this is that what I've been telling you about this is the mystery of this whole week this is that third pole this is the revealing of the word sh don't tell nobody he said the third poll will not be a public show he said I'm never going back into World evangelism he doesn't go back into World evangelism carnal impersonation ations sermon you must be born again 1961 people are told out on the west coast now oh we got the immortal baptism we baptize you in water you turn back uh right back around young man right there young woman yes sir you got Elijah's garments they've got manifested Sons yes sir brother God's getting manifested Sons right now manifesting tell them all about this tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're a manifested Son of God nonsense where do you get that in the word babies are not born men they're born babies and grow to man you know what a baby has natural discernment and it uses the five physical senses C taste smell feeli here and everything that baby wants to relate to himself he's got to touch it smell it feel it whatever huh he finds his foot guess what he does he's got to taste his foot he got to taste his hand everything you put anything in front of him he grabs it he oh glasses I wonder you see what he's doing trying to because he's trying to discern but now listen we're not talking about physical discernment now I'm talking about spiritual discernment and all of you have got to have spiritual discernment I don't want you immature babies I don't want you to be so innocent and naive to think that that everybody that claims to believe this message really believes it because the Apostle Paul told the people he says a real true Jew is one who's won inwardly oh even Peter had to be rebuked by Paul and he said here Peter you're trying to make all these genes Jews you're trying to get them circumcised had to withstand him to his face okay we're talking about when the true church gets a true Revelation okay these things are happening here Among Us it's divided it's split this group and you know what you watch when something like that comes in and divides a group you'll not they'll not have fellowship with you anymore they can leave your church and you can have a big convention they'll never darken your door again why what happened what what happened used to be you could yeah hey man people I'm just talking about you watch you take a spirit you can go I've been in Costco I've been in Kmart I've been shopping I'm all a sudden see Believers and they see you and go so I head them off at the pass and come to the hey and all of a sudden they're speaking in tongues because you know what we're brothers yeah you might see it differently than me but why why does that got to cause us to be divided why can't we and brother Brenham said one says he's coming on a white horse another says he's coming on a white cloud so what what difference does it make as long as we agree he's coming five physical senses to discern the worldly realm around you but there's a six sense given to every SE Gene that is called the gift of faith and fath of Revelation brother renom calls it the super sense sheep that tend to wander off needs constant eye of the shepherd a child that lacks natural discernment and Common Sense will need the parents constant attention where were you last night well I was just out I know you just out when a church remember lacks of discernment it's constantly needing to be rescued From The Snare of the enemy because you go out and you do things wrong say things wrong and get a wrong among the wrong company next thing you know you taking a spirit because birds of a feather yeah now let me show you a scriptural example we're talking about the book of Acts huh we're talking about oh hey how about that book of Acts how about the acts of the Holy Spirit man that came in there day of Pentecost Acts chapter 2 man came down they all began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there was one big happy family but just give them a few years watch if you want to turn with me let's go to Acts chapter8 now I'm going to show you the difference between two elders and a young Minister a deacon called Phillip all right we're going to look Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them acts 8 ver 5-2 and the people with one Accord gave heed on all these things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did Spirits crying with a loud voice come out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with PES and that were lame were healed there was great joy in that City but there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery Bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all had give heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God and to him they had regard because of a long time he had Bewitched them with sorceries and when they believed Phillip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself wow Hallelujah philli gets there they got a little Revival and Simon Says man this is amazing so Simon believes also Hallelujah put it in our magazine send it out around the world Simon got converted watch this Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Phillip my they were having a message Revival and wanded beholding the miracle the signs which were done now when the apostles which were in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they said to them Peter and John hey go check it out boys yeah go see if this is real who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was swen on none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then laid they hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost when Simon saw that through the laying on in the apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money well they said oh wow this a greatest Vindication of my Ministry yes it'll cost you $10,000 and I'll give you this power and you can saying give me also this power that whomsoever I lay hands on he may receive the Holy Ghost Peter said unto him watch now here's an elder thy money perish with thee because thou H has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money thou Hast neither part nor lot in the matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God repent therefore of thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee for I perceive now here's here's discernment Philip missed it philli missed it man come down here we're having a Revival Simon is in the message he's brought all the people with with him Peter says oh you need to repent you're not even converted Simon I perceive that thou art in the G of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity then answered Simon said pray ye to the Lord for me the none of these things that you have spoken come unto me and they when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord returned under Jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages under the Samaritans it took seasoned Elders you understand that to discern a spirit on Simon Philip missed it he looked at just the outward manifestation he came into the message he got baptized look at this man he's one of us until two Elder veterans come down there you're not even converted Simon you have Bewitched the people your heart's full of iniquity the word Bewitched in Greek means to make them astonished and full of wonder it says like a magician's trick you ever done in a or seen in a m magician comes out here huh huh you want to see hey watch this wow how did you do that you have Bewitched the people it happened in the book of Acts among men of God but it took a seasoned veteran said Simon you're not even converted huh began to expose his see let me give you another example in the book of Acts how many of you have ever read this Acts chapter 16 let's let's read it here acts 16 verse 16 it came to pass as we went to prish certain damsel possessed with the spirit of divination met us and brought her Masters much gained by sus the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the Servants of the most high God would show unto us the way of Salvation now notice this is exactly what she's saying these are men of the most high God let me tell you you know what most ministers would do in the message right now man put her picture and get her testimony and let's put it in in our book and let's put it on Facebook and Instagram and show everybody this a Vindication of our ministry look at this here she is here are these men these men are the men of the most high God who show us the way of Salvation what a trap what a trick yet demons speaking words of truth amen keep reading though this did she many days but Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour look at that what she was saying was right but it was a spirit it was an ungodly spirit Spirit of divination that's what sent those guys to prison was because those that said hey these men come and trouble Jerusalem and try to do this and that they you know they're coming against us see you know what they were doing they were tearing up that exposing the religious exposing this moneymaking sousing sorcery just like Simon just like an an i and saf fire the Bible says 2 Timothy 3: 5 5 through 13 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with divers lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Janice and jambre withstood Moses so do these resist the truth men of corrupt Minds rep probate concerning the faith they shall proceed no further their Folly shall be made manifest unto all men as theirs was verse 12 yay and all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers will wax worse and worse deceive deing and being deceived what does it mean to be spiritually Discerning you ought to be able to to have a discernment of something inside of you to know if it's right or wrong you see the bride of Christ must not only have spiritual revelation but spiritual discernment so she'll not be deceived pray for spiritual discernment and understanding amen let me show you he cares do you care we got two churches at hand this morning one of them is the Church of Pentecost organized at Pentecost by the Holy Spirit the second is the Church of the Roman Catholic which is organized in N of Rome one of them is a spiritual birth the other one's an intellectual membership I'm going to go to the bottom here one is based on spiritual discernment the other one is based on educational intellectual conception brother Brenham taught sermons such as Jezebel religion Blasphemous names he said denominational Spirits are seducing Spirits enticing Spirits unclean ungodly lascivious sensual remember a religious spirit is a sexual Spirit that's why when you get off the word of God and you take a spirit of spiritual fornication it'll wind up in physical fornication that's why a lot of these min in their lives they went along very good for so long next thing you know what's happened to them not a lot of people shouting hallelujah amen on that but it's true amen demonology many of you were in some sort of denominational Christianity before you came to the message but when you heard the message was clear and precise come out from among God quickening your spiritual discernment you did not understand it all at the beginning but you were learning and Desiring for more of Truth and then many of you tried to fellowship with people from denominations after you came to the message and found it immediately it don't work different spirit so you better discern amen Samaran Church age brother R said The more associate the mere Association of kind-hearted people with True Believers might well bring death in return for their kindness oh it's okay just go ahead and fellowship with this stuff mere Association I want you all to exercise your senses remember the false bride will hybridize take away misinterpret misconstrue misplace the word they'll put their own opinion to it and that's what makes them deceivers now watch this because in the sermon you must be born again false prophets have false words Creed denominations Sensations now he's going to give you examples of this oh bless God only thing you have to do you want Elijah's garment glory to God only thing you have to do is just blank your mind don't think of a thing and say oh fill me fill me fill me the devil will sure do it then you're you rely upon what oh it really run all over me brother ROM I felt it Oh Glory to God hallelujah jumping up and down like that oh I got it and live like you live by their fruits you shall know them see not Sensations oh brother you want to receive the Holy Ghost just get down to the Altar and say Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory until you speak in tongues uhuhuh go back out and live any kind of Life lie steal something's wrong somewhere now I want you to put on your spiritual thinking cap and I just got a couple more quotes here but we're going to read them read them slow so that you guys will catch this one of the longest sermons brother Brenham ever preaches is spoken word is the original seat paragraph 47 talking about deception it didn't come through Adam shame on you who don't see that see it's not Adam's fault he had nothing to do with if death come by Adam see then it come by God death come by crossbreeding death can't come by God's word death comes by crossbreeding it to denomination Creed instead of Christ Dogma instead of the word it doesn't come by the word the word is life amen to crossbreed it there's where death comes from Adam was not deceived paragraph 50 but his bride was deceived Christ today is not deceived the word is not deceiving it's the bride it's the bride doing deceiving by the word and watch it's by their interpretation of the word you see that this pretty heavy to take who's doing the deceiving watch this let's keep reading paragraph 67 and Adam's bride could not wait she went forward first that's the way today the bride today she wants to manufacture something glory to God she's got to work it up on the platform she's got to have everything see what she doing manufacturing something that's the reason why she's reaping her Harvest right now I hope you don't make I hope you don't make you upset I hope it gets right down to the place where I'll try I'll trust that God has give it to you paragraph 81 that's what's the matter today you want some kind of phony makeup with screaming and jumping and speaking in tongues or something instead of waiting waiting for the real word of God to be manifested through his bride them kind takes the word of God it's God's true bride bringing forth children see a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word amen paragraph 105 I don't feel bad about criticizing it's due criticism I don't want to hurt nobody's feelings but I'd rather hurt some man's feelings than to hurt God's feeling now watch remember we're talking about spiritual fornication paragraph 106 musicians come it's getting a little tight in here so Jehovah's bride went horing Jehovah's bride went horing and what did she do she brought forth a bunch of illegitimates again Christ bride has done the same thing what's the matter can't wait oh no uh-huh just can't wait they have to manufacture something they can't wait for the Holy Spirit to come and get into the church see they have to get more in their denomination paragraph 109 but today why it's sounding brass tinking symbol that's right just be become nonsense a laughing block a disgrace to the world disgrace see paragraph 121 what's she trying to do manufacturer little jumping on the platform not making fun of it's all right she manufactures something see you get members into the church what's the matter she just can't wait so they tell them you have to do that and and away they go see there's the seed coming right up you have to do it my brother my [Music] sister we don't have to manufacture any evidence when brother Brenham gave warning messages such as the anointed on at the end time he said false seed Anointed with the spirit of God and yet they're false seed prophesy tongues all kinds of signs and wonders they didn't jump and shout when he brought forth the sermon trying to do God's service without it being according to his will when's the last time you listened to souls in prison there's not a lot of shouting and jumping and screaming going on no he's saying hey souls in prison what is it it looks like it's happening now right now Among [Music] Us people being imprisoned Souls imprisoned you see what I'm doing I'm taking history to show you that happened in every age why wouldn't it happen in this age I don't care we can jump and shout and say we are predestinated elect of God for ordained we got the word of God in our hearts and we'll beat every devil and every this and that and Hallelujah and defeated he's defeated every place every time anywhere yeah well don't you understand spiritual [Music] warfare don't you understand brother Ram said hey you better you better trained for this contest because you will meet him he said you will face him and he's going to disguise himself as an angel of Light and he's going to come he's going to try to deceive you he's going to get you under some kind of anointing that's why brother brandom tells us he said I'm afraid what we do is we get one another Spirit not the Holy Spirit God don't need to use these instruments here to get the Holy Spirit moving in fact brother R said you want to see if it's a real Revival unplug the organ God don't need that they were sitting on the day of Pentagon God don't need our help I love you guys that's why I tell you these things the truth and again I put this disclaimer out there because I know I get some burners of emails to come back to me and then different ones want to go and shoot at me because they think I'm against emotions or Sensations and I want all of you to understand I'm not against that I'm not I'm an emotional preacher myself I like jumping and shouting but oh God give me something that I that is the word revealed in my heart to give me to shout about it otherwise it's just a pep rally get up here and shake your palm Pals God sent a prophet Hallelujah isn't that the right you're predestined Hallelujah yeah zimu amen amen glory understand we're in a spiritual battle and this is the most worst of all times right now seducing Spirits waxs worse and worse in the latter days men right brother Bren and put that letter in the Cornerstone of brandom
