God bless you all tonight I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus Amen there was an accident on the the roads there and many people got um delayed and getting here but you're here and I think how many times the the devil's tried to throw accidents and roadblocks in your way but yet you know what you're still hereall 2024 guess what we're still here you know uh the Devil's thrown many things at us brother minnow listen my brother I want you to come up here for just a minute greet the people he's a seasoned veteran and uh uh I am allowing him to be here in town without having him to minister I'm allowing it it won't happen again uh uh but brother Mano come up here seasoned veteran Pastor been through many experiences he was there uh he was privileged to actually be in the meetings of brother br he said he was there um during the six Services of brother Brenham preaching marriage and divorce and um many of us did not have an opportunity to see that Prophet to hear him preach and to come under that but the Bible says uh blessed are those who have not seen amen and yet believe brother meno we love you thank you uh we respect you just for 2,000 huh an hour is okay an hour is good Mario will be blessed he'll he'll in seon out of season but uh men what do you see for 2024 as an expectation as a seasoned believer please not past tonight I appreciate what how brother Bram told us to live he said plan like you've got a 100 years but live like he's coming in the morning amen that's how we go to bed every night we've been all these good years I count them great years my whole life basically since I was 23 years old and now I'm 81 at 23 years old I heard brother Brian preach those messages running from the presence of the Lord all the way through marriage and divorce this day is the scripture fulfilled who is this MDC on and I can say this from that time on even though I was surrendered to the Lord before that already is why we went but from that time my whole life has never been the same amen it couldn't be because the Deep was calling to the deep and yes sir that's the point that God makes he knows where his sheep are they scattered across the world and he might pick up a person and use him for one thing I know we'd all like to sing to like tonight we're saying Lord you want to be so filled with the Holy Ghost that no matter where you go there's an around you you just like to be that way but we are human as well that's right we're still in this body Paul told us how that he himself had uh to contend with his flesh as we all do but knowing that the flesh is never redeemed until we change this body or the Rapture takes place we till that time then what I want to do I do not what I would do I what I would not do I do and Paul said there's a law but there's a law of the spirit as well yes sir and the law of the holy spirit always brings us back to his word knowing now that we are in him before the foundation of the world and years mean so little now I'm thinking uh often you know how you look forward look forward brother on that's how we look forward in 24 I don't know look I was there when we were were before 77 every move we made getting closer getting closer getting closer but much of it was what the Prophet had said and as we all know brother Ram spoke the in the message from the indictment till communion he took his whole life and surrendered to call out a bride and to dress her make her ready to take on the resurrection and the Rapture that was his whole message so he spoke it as though it would happen while he was here he did yes sir but you know in God's time just a few seconds now and one place you said is that though God was Raising from his seat he said that two three minutes ago that's about all it's been these last 50 to 60 years and but look how many were not even born and God has saved them now here your sitting we thought we were the last ones and I'll tell you honestly when God called me and I saw I heard brother Brown say certain things I felt so bad I felt I was born out of season oh if I could have just lived there when the message was really there little did I realize that I would take the full benefit and have the full benefit of the message in the third pool in the open word prior to that they're aiming towards aiming toward but one day he said this day is this scripture fulfilled we have arrived we have arrived when is it I don't know but we have arrived at the newness of our bodies we've arrived at the place we're not looking for anything new I'm not looking for anything new I'm looking for the same Christ that started the work to finish it off if 24 is the year you know I I don't even want to go there because you know we don't live by years anymore we've already passed that we've slipped into immortality already one Resurrection one Resurrection has already taking place out of dark denominationalism yes sir into the very presence of almighty God we can go no place church if you're born of the spirit of God you can go no place you just walk in the harmony of Christ the word and when he nudges you'll be you'll be changed when he calls you'll be changed Hallelujah that's what we look for I might live to see the Rapture I hope I do I'd like to go with my wife together but you know what God has the appointed time for all us I'm just be glad to have served him these years and live for I'm thinking what will it be like if this is the down payment is this good what will the full payment there's no way we can imagine it we can't even get into that place we just get a little glimpses of it along the way but forget those things which are on the past now you sitting here tonight you know some of you stumbled fault there's not one not one Minister can stand behind the pulpit but feels unworthy Amen to be even mentioned among the apostles and Prophets but it's he that made you worthy thank you Lord if you look back and live there you'll die don't look back look forward forgetting those things which are on the past press toward the mark the pr prize of the High Calling One Day at a Time Sweet Jesus God bless you I'm going to open my [Applause] bible amen thank you brother meno God bless you uh we have uh brother Mario who has not been here with us for 15 months he's been over there in the Philippines and been ministering and so I figured it would be good and it's very timely and the devil tried to hinder you from even getting here and he was four cars behind when the accident and so you know all of the there's 10 police cars and ambulances and all kinds of stuff so but we're glad that I told him I said I'm just thankful you weren't in the midst of it amen huh how many times has God spared you you were right behind an accident you were right there if you would have put your shoes on a little faster if your wife would have had your clothes out for you you would have been dressed sooner see no I'm just teasing um but uh little things that delayed you and you wonder you know and I'm always the one that I want to be there on time and this and I realize that there are times that God sets a little something there your your car didn't start you this you had to go back in to get something and and he delayed you just for a few minutes or moments and kept you from a a real heartache or an accident where a loved one could have been lost amen so we're just very pleased let's all stand together let's sing that song I surrender I Surrender because universally that's what we're doing tonight amen I Surrender Lord with all of the issues that we have within this Mortal life but father I surrender to you amen it's just giving my life to you that's what it's all about and and anybody know what the universal sign of surrender is hands up amen let's do it for just a minute amen let God know I Surrender oh surrender I Surrender Lord I I Surrender my life I give it all to you than you Lord I Surrender I Surrender Lord I Surrender my life I give it all to you Hallelujah Heavenly Father we thank you Lord tonight we come before you Lord and we humble ourselves into thy holy presence Lord thank you Lord God for making our way safe Lord that

of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen praise God so greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm glad I be in the house of the Lord tonight that's right amen it's been uh 15 months that I am gone and just bear with my rusty English because when I was in the Philippines I need to speak uh when I was always in the islands and different islands and sometimes people don't write don't know how to write I don't speak so I need to speak in a very in or dialects sometime three dialects because every island is different dialect so I need to get into that in order for them to understand the message of the hour so for 15 months I am used to speaking like that so my English is very Rusty so just bear with me amen amen so praise the Lord and it's always a privilege and an honor to minister to the Saints here in that evening light and thank you very much brother Ron for giving me the time to praise God Minister the word of God tonight and also glad to see you all I miss you all when we were there we are just streaming sometime but we are seeing the back part of your only the back part now I am in front of you so praise the Lord and also glad to see brother Mino praise God's wife praise God so we will go directly to the word of God and when brother Ron uh asked me to preach this Wednesday so I prayed for God's uh Inspirations and leading and he just directed me to the book called Christ is the mystery of God revealed yes sir but I will not preach the whole Christ is the mystery of God I we know that it is already being preached but I believe as the prophet said keep on digging and more will unfold that's right so we will just take uh some nuggets as the Lord leads amen take the highlights and bring it into the present tense uh Colossians 1 verse 2 26 27 it's just a simple thought and uh it's just to refresh our memories of the things that we have already heard amen Colossians 1: 26-27 it says even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from Generations but is now present tense in our generation is made manifest to his Saint sir amen made manifest means to make clear Amen to be made visible now in our generation thank you Lord to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles amen so the message is supposed to be to the Israelites to the Jew but they rejected it and it was given to us thank you Lord hallelujah The Riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles we are foreigners outside of Israelites we are foreigners we are eaten we are unbelievers but it was the grace of God hallelujah that was given to us Amen to whom God M would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory god in men living in Man by his Spirit as the nature of man guide him him and leading him by his spirit amen amen and it's a great thing that's right then Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished amen as he ha declared to his servants the prophets and may the Lord add the blessing upon the reading of his word you may now be seated praise the Lord amen so as the Lord directed me to the uh book Christ is the mystery of God revealed so I'll take my title uh here where and he said now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery so that's my title tonight God's purpose and his hidden Mystery now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the word ever began and how it is unfolded right down to this present hour that we are living in so here is a man who preach with authority he is not just an ordinary man that can preach what is the hidden or the purpose of God and the hidden Mystery before the foundation of the world Amen so he is not he did come from any the background and sometimes we cannot even hear some Scholars or teaching that is preaching about the hidden Mystery of God but here is a man with full Authority and he said that's what I want to speak to the church this morning men with authority it was just like Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth he went to the synagogue and preached the gospel open the scripture and all those people were asist Hallelujah and they even question them themselves where did this come from what school or denomination he did come from because he speak with authority amen we are glad that brother Bram Hallelujah is the prophet that God sent in this last days because the mystery of God according to Amos 3:7 the Lord surely the Lord can do nothing or The God can do nothing except he revealed the secret things that's right to his servant the prophet that's right the secret things belong to God but the revelations belong to a special class of people hallelujah those people that he are chosen elected selected predestinated Justified Sanctified called and glorified am this message is for a special class of people that's why the secret is only for the bride special class of people that's why he said to speak to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the word ever began and how it unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we are living in God is unfolding unfolding his great mystery he has he had made known this mystery now being made manifest now being made clear in this generation praise the Lord he keep on unfolding and the life that we live now is the unfolding of what was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Hallelujah God called us not by accident it is a chosen people in time and season that we need to manifest what was the thought of God before the foundation of the world unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we are living then you will understand clearly you see oh I believe what is being done God is doing something in this generation God is unfolding right now that's why somebody said oh we thank God for what he has done and he is doing but they are not recognizing what he is doing right now that's right and the prophet in this last day said you need to recognize your day and your message God is doing something in this generation and we are the people the beneficiary the recipient of that unfolding of Christ in these last days hallelujah God's great mystery about is a secret he kept it a secret and nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it that's right remember when he preached chrisis a mystery of God revealed he preached four months before he preached about the seven seal he preached about the first to The Sixth Seal and when he come to the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for half an hour and it stopped there he didn't continue but four month before now he is preaching Christ is the mystery of God will and his thought continue he say he didn't reveal it that the reason our our seventh mystery when the seventh sealed was open there was silence in heaven he speaking about the seven seal because when he preached the seven seal in March of 1963 there was silence he didn't continue he didn't explain it now he beginning praise God to pick up those thought and bring it in Christ is the mystery of God revealed praise the Lord now paragraph 173 when Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come so he's giving an a hint that the seven seal is the coming of the Lord right so he cot there was silence in heaven then the next paragraph he said Jesus when he was here on Earth they wanted to know when he would come speaking about the second coming of Christ he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen but we know that he's coming amen God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of an hour and seven Thunders after their voices so if we keep it up if we pick it up he said that the reason there was silence in heaven for space of half an hour so is quoting Revelation 8:1 it says that and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour so he pick up the tote when he preached the seven seal he continue that so see God has this is a sequence that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of an hour and seven Thunders after their voices this is another scripture he TI up Revelation 81 to Revelation 10 the seven Thunders and seven Thunders utter their voices and John was even forbidden to write and he said the coming of the Lord so Revelation 8 there was silence in heaven no angel clapping no no Hallelujah no shouting it was the secret coming of the Lord that's why in Revelation 10 he said the mighty angel came down with an open book amen the closed book in Revelation chap 5 that no one knows or woring to open now it's an open book in Revelation chapter 10 yes sir that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet speaking about the coming of how he will come and when he will come he hasn't revealed yet of how and when he will come but he is coming that's right it's a good thing that he doesn't hallelujah it's a good thing that he hasn't he don't need to speak it because the angel of the Lord said don't tell you have already tell the first fo and the second fool and it was impersonated so dist third po don't speak it it's a complete silence no one knows and that's the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't yes amen he has showed or revealed every type that's in the Bible that secret coming Hallelujah he already showed it in types and shadows in the Old Testament that's right Hallelujah and he has showed to reveal it in every types that's in the Bible shown what he's coming in every type in the B therefore the entire mystery of the Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ so all the stories of the Bible from Genesis through Revelation were encoded in this great mystery yes brother and the secret of his coming and the revealing of himself Hallelujah and so it was the secret that was sealed up until this end time age when God to the Sabbath Angels Ministry would come and make it known to the predestinated people and the Mystery of our name was written in all those stories of your life in this day making you a part of the mystery that is being revealed today amen as Christ as Christ is the mystery of God revealed you the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed because the full mystery requires both husband and wife Hallelujah to show the complete mystery remember the entire Bible was written for this end time age because everything that was written Hallelujah in seed form in the Bible comes to manifestation at the Harvest Time which is the end time yes sir we are now manifesting the fullness of all those prophecy so today we are fulfilling every scriptures we are living in the days of Noah again and it was in the days of Noah praise God so it shall be at the coming of the son of man we are living the days of Sodom again and we are living the time of Exodus of the Third Exodus Prophet amen we are not living in the first Exodus we are not living in the second Exodus but we are living in the Third Exodus Hallelujah the first Exodus and Nation come out from the nation second Exodus from the law to Grace but the Third Exodus come out from denominations among them and we have the promised land which is the revealed word of the hour we living the days of Ahab and Jezebel Hallelujah in these last days we are living the times of Sarah again could we say when God appeared the form of human plus y amen yes sir and this in the heart of Sarah in order for her to receive strength to conceive the promise in this last days we have arrived as many prons Hallelujah we have seen the last sign in this last days that the God made flesh discern the heart of the children and that is the last sign before the changing of our bodies Hallelujah we are living in the time when elizar has been sent out to get a bride for Isaac praise be to God we are living the time when root the Gentile is coming into Union with boas at the Harvest Time and eliminate inheritance is about to be restored back praise the lord we are living the time when Jacob had to wait seven years for Rachel seven Church ages for a wael to come up we are living the time when Rahab is applying the token the time of judgment and pending attraction we are in the time of Rahab that's right that we kept the messenger we kept the message of the messenger and apply the token Hallelujah before the Judgment come and when I see the token I will pass over you praise be to God hallelujah hallelujah we are living the time of Gideon when three powers United together to go against the bride religious power political power praise God hallelujah and what other power demonic power join together to go against Gideon but there is a descending Angel Hallelujah who revealed who really he who re who he really was and build up his faith amen the message of the hour came down to let us us know who we are to give us Faith to believe his message we are living in the time of Easter when she come into the union with the King and come into the full realization of her position is how we are also coming into full realizations of our position in this day amen because the message of the hour Hallelujah will bring us in our position in this last day this is the adaption time we are living in the time when Joseph is about to dismiss his gentle wife to the palace and reveal himself to his Breen on and on we could go because the entire Bible was written for this Harvest hour of where the seed becomes manifested at the Harvest time that's why when I first received the message of the Y I was so attracted by the message of the prophet he always preach about the Old Testament character and then I so enjoy it and I cannot forget it because he bring the Old Testament Saints into the present tense that's right and I identify myself in all those character and come to think of it and realize that we are the mystery that is being revealed in all those Testament until this time and the riches of the glory of God hallelujah will be made known in this last day thank you Lord this is what the Seven's heill has sealed until this time this was the hidden Mana that was sealed yes sir up until these last days this is the bread of life that has been broken to us in this hour of him walking with us in this day amen in the message Feast of the trumpet look I want to say one more thing closely don't miss this how striking from the seventh Angels message in Revelation 10 was the seven seal amen so the seventh seal message was the message oh the seventh Angels message was the message of the seven seal which was Revelation 10 and I trust that we are matured enough we are belong to the message of the hour amen we always hear about the seal about the seven tunders and we know that the seal is only a seal seven seal there are seven seal and the book is not this kind of book we understand it and the book is just a scroll being sealed amen with seven seal and when you open the seven seal it open up first to six seal so the seven seal is just a covering of the book but the inside content of that book right is the the seventh Thunder of Revelation 10 amen amen so that's why he came down with an open book in his hand and he gave the message to the seventh angel the seventh angel of Revelation 10 and the seventh angel of Revelations is at at the time is here on Earth just like John introduced Jesus Christ and when brother bam is he need to introduce the Christ amen in the form of the word not in the form of human being that's right that's why it's an open book yes amen the content of the book is the seventh Thunder and it takes the seventh angel to reveal what was in the Thunder amen so the first coming of Christ was in the form of revealing of the Man Called Jesus but the second coming would be the form of revealing of the word and not in the body of men but now that word is manifested in a body of a woman the bride Hallelujah because the manifestations of the second coming of Christ will be completed in the form of a woman which is his wife Allelujah remember that it required both Adam and Eve male and female to fully revealed Adam amen he could not be called Adam unless Eve was being made manifest male and female and God called them Adam so it will take the entire body of Jesus and his bride to fully reveal Christ amen hallelujah the second Adam this was God's stold purpose first to express himself in Christ praise God then to have the and then to restore the Fallen Kingdom by restoring everything that Adam lost in Aiden oh Hallelujah you need to have preeminence and what is preeminent that means he is the first in everything first in importance first in honor first in exaltation Hallelujah because Jesus is the head he said I am the beginning and I am the ending I am the Alpha and the Omega that's why Paul wrote In Colossians he said that whatsoever things you do yeah in words or in Deeds do it all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ give thanks to God that's right and the father by him in Proverbs 3:6 in all thy ways let him have the preeminence in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path amen thank you Lord God wants preeminence Hallelujah praise God so in the message Christ The Mystery of God revealed paragraph 37 now he Sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last days be revealed he's Sanctified it by his own blood he don't delegate it to any other any other that's why in Revelation 5 verse one when John was being lifted up and the angel I will show you things that is going to come said and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seal Hallelujah a written book and sealed with seventh seal it was a covering and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seal the rope and no man in Heaven Nor in the earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look unto nobody's worth it and I John said much be and I WEP much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me we not behold the ryion of the tribe of Judah the root of David had Prevail to open the book and to lose the seal thereof and beh low in the midst of the throne and of the forast and in the midst of the ERS stood a lamp a lamp as he had been slain Hallelujah a bloody lamp praise God so that's why he said that so that's why he said he Sanctified it with his spirit and his blood a church that he might make every promise in the last days be revealed Hallelujah Hal Hallelujah continue on Christ The Mystery of God revealed now it's easy to go back and pick up what this other fellow has left off here in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the seven seal he's expressing himself amen that's his purpose that's the purpose of God to express himself Hallelujah that's his purpose that's why he that's the second fold of his three-fold manifest first to express himself in Christ and then Express himself through the church and the same thing Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through and the church become the word when it lets the word go through them but when they accept a hybrid denomination and we can add more and if they accept a man-made Theory a manmade understanding Hallelujah own interpretations of the message of the hour then it cause a short and blow of fuse amen but when the current is Flowing freely the word of God it expresses itself that's why God wants preeminence God don't want our understanding or the let him have the preeminence that the word can flow through amen and we become the Church of the Living God Amen Lord hallelujah and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his gued goded D through his church have the preeminence in the church you did you catch it and in there when the word is flowing through the church and in there there would come there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of God and the time that will come forth we are going into that direction amen we are now arrived in the point of no return yes sir we are in the Eds of fulfilling fulfilling God's promises that the end time sign is almost being made manifest the sign of the end time Wars humors of Wars Calamity there gravity there they are all fulfilled we can see it amen there is only one promise for the bride and that is for the changing of your body there would be a Time come forth and that time Hallelujah we are now leading on that direction amen when he could express himself in in the fullness of his goded b goded d through his church have the preeminence in the church we are going into the direction as the prophet said when the squeezing time comes what you seen temporarily in the ministry of brother Branham in the ministry of the fivefold ministry will come into full manifestation it will be the gued in the church that can speak something into existence we are now leading on that direction we have the mind of Christ Hallelujah it didn't happen to brother bam alone because he is just the first fruit that he is being waved in our generation Hallelujah we are now leading in that direction there would be a Time come for that time is now we have now reached the point of no return and sometimes with the we are now 14 kilm to our destination we have arrived amen Amen in the point of our destination Hallelujah there is no turning back there's no way that you can turn back because when the message is flowing through you you're just going in that direction Hallelujah that's right have the preeminence in the chur of my what the anointed men now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed Ed by what accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word they are spirit and they are life Anointed with the word what e turned down he came back and we accepted it what did E turn down it was the word I believe is Satan is anointing his subject amen when revelation s chapter 9 verse1 it open the bottomless fit the anointing of that bottomless pit goes to his subject and he anoint his subject to disbelieve God's word whereas God the eagle anointing anoint his people to believe the word of God hallelujah hallelujah there are two spirit in the last days one anoint the people for to un believe the word of God but one anointing to believe the word of God Amen Hallelujah accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back the second Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit an anoint with the word and E turned down he come back and we accept it yeah praise the lord we accept it have you accepted it if you are the bride you need to Rejoice that what you receive is not just it didn't come from any denominational ideas of men what you receive came from the anointing that comes from Heaven the mighty angel coming down Hallelujah and you receive a supernatural word the anointed word of the hour that anointing will bring to manifestation that anointing will bring this flesh subject to his word the word is spirit anointed word what eeve turned down he come back and we accept it but the eve of Satan uh paragraph 56 of the same subject Christ The Mystery of God be and Satan oh you know but see turn around and listen to him he listened to Satan Hallelujah but the Eve in this last days is not going to do it are you the Eve in this last days you're are not going to turn down the word of God in this last days because he is predestinated not to do it you are predestinated not to turn down the word of God because he is predestinated not to do it yes sir God's going to do it he will be the one to do it that's right not us amen because he Sanctified himself he gave his blood and his spirit for the sanctification of his church thank Lord because he's predestinated not to do it yes sir God's going to do it he knows he said he spot he will there will be without spot or wrinkles he's going to stand there in the Splendor of him his word made less and she be the token to the world you will be a token to the word when you walk into a mall and some of them are be are wearing short and you our sisters with long hair you are a token to this world that's right Hallelujah you are a witness that there is a God somewhere walking in flesh amen then we are the people that God has predestinated to be the recipient and to comprehend this thing predestinated people to comprehend this hidden secret of God no other age or no other anointing could allow you to see these things that's right say rising of the sun he is the one who opened those seal he is the seal for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seal that was opened and what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ amen hallelujah it's so simple God reveal himself in Simplicity that's right we need we don't need to have a flowery words those seal is Christ the anointed word but there are so many details about that word amen so the prophet is telling us that Christ was revealed by his word in this age by the opening of his entire mind this is coming of Christ in word form to be United with the People by revealing to them his his thought amen the the message that we receive is not a thought of a man that's right but it was the thought of God being made manifest in his servant the prophet in his first coming he was the word made flesh everybody agrees Amen in the man Christ Jesus and the thought of God we're connected to the body of Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ was the express question of the Unseen God that's right that's why in John 14:7 when he's speaking about the disciples he said if you have known me you should have known my father also amen and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him that is the Declaration Hallelujah if he had known me praise God you should have known my father also so and from henceforth you know him and have seen him it seems that Philip cannot understand what he's talking about and he said Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and he sufficeth us and Jesus said unto him have I been so long with you and yet you have known me Philip you had been in the message for so many years and yet you don't know what is the message of the the message is not brother Bram that's right the message is not do this and do that amen the message is not law right that you should do this and do that the message is Christ in you the hope of glory and Jesus said have I been so long with you and yet thou has not known me Philip he that had seen me had seen the father that's right he that had seen me had seen the father because we are the second F mystery of God don't look about your physical beings look at the promise in you because you cannot receive the message of the hour by accident that's right thank you Lord he that had seen me had seen the father and how sayest thou show us the father where is the message of the hour we are the message of the hour just like the worldship where is the will I want to attend the Will I Am the will Bible where is the message of you are the message of the hour because you are manifesting Christ in Bri form in this last days you are not talking about any other denominational deas but you are talking about predestination placing all of that Hallelujah the deeper things of God hallelujah so we are not fellowshipping any denominational deas we are fellowshipping around the mind of God that is being given to us to comprehend thank you Lord believest thou not th I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work now he is explaining the Revelation amen believest thou not thy I am in the father and the father is in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself amen the word that we receive is not our or word or is not the pro prophet's word it was the word of God given to the prophet so we are quoting the man of God in this last days right thank you Lord I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doth the works and he continue on believe me that I am in the father and the father me or else believe me for the very Works sake amen so there is always an Evidence the word that I speak unto you is not mine but is the father of me but if you cannot believe believe it recognize my work that's right because he said the son can do nothing except the father show him first we as the Bride of Jesus can do nothing else except God allow or reveal himself to us amen because as brother R preached in this Sunday the word is in the bride and she knows what he wants done with the word we have now but now it is the thought of God being connected to a bride body and so now she is the word of God made manifest in this hour an end time many membered body of Christ the bride coming of Christ Christ coming in the form of the bride and he said John 14:12 at that day you shall know that I am the father and ye in me I in you at that day what day is that the day Hallelujah with when the voice of the seventh angel begin to sound the mystery of who you are and who I am is already finish Hallelujah we just need to walk in the light of God hallelujah just like Enoch walk yes sir he walks in the light because the light is the one who guide us out of denominational Darkness we need to walk in the light as he is in the light until Hallelujah Enoch was caught up because he followed the light of his hour the light of God there that's why the prophet said there is a man here that now can turn on the light amen and greater than Solomon is here hallelujah amen in Lan age he said now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 7 is going to do things and we are fully convinced that the Malachi 4 the Elijah was send and the seventh angel messenger they are one the same person that's right and his name is William Marion Branham no questions and no doubt about it that's right everybody confused about it it's up to them but Elijah was sent to you thank you personal if you are predestinated of God Elijah was sent to you to you and you is a present tense that's right praise God it's going to two to two two things one according to Malachi he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers to he will reveal the mystery of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 Jen heard the Thunder seven thundered after their voices so Jen heard it and he understood it and he was about to write right but the don't write it John because in the last days in the Sabbath Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the Revelation contained in the seven seal it will be this divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turned the heart of the children to the Pentecostal father and listen to the the seven thunders in Revelation 10 are the Mysteries contained in the seven seal amen the seven seal was open book and the mighty angel coming down with an open book and seven Thunders after the voices so the content of the book is the seven Thunders right and John is forbidden to write but it will take the seven Angel alah to reveal that mystery thank you Lord hallelujah so the seven seal we just covering of the books but the inside content within those seal were the tunders of Revelation chapter 10 Allelujah it will be this divinely revealed truth mystery Hallelujah that will turn the heart of the children back to the faith of the father so it is preaching of the Mysteries the revealed truth of the hour that will turn the hard back to the original faith and so if we are not preaching the Ral mysterious truth then we are not preaching the message of the other denominational type of breaching nothing's against that there's so many denominational kind of breaching and it can help you become a better citizen that's it can help you have a good moral character it can make you feel good I'm good it can make you feel religious it can touch your emotion it can make you cry it can make you worship God but it can never give you rupturing Faith because rupturing faith lies in this divinely revealed mysterious truth that will give us rupturing faith thank you Lord can you say Amen to that Amen brother Bram told us that the seven seal include many things it's the opening of the word that was sealed up it's the coming of the Lord amen it's what we will give the rupture and Grace for the church to move out it's the third pool it's the opening and revealing of the books is the shout of the first Thessalonian 4:16 the coming of the Lord in three faes there will be a shout there will be a voice there will be a Trum that was included in the seven seal it's the Eternal Church age at the end of the seal it's the winding up of all those Lucid it's the end of the struggling nature it's the end of the struggling word it's the answering in of the Millennium and it is the ital Deeds of redemption coming back into the hand of men Again The Inheritance that Adam lost in Eden what did he lost in the Garden of Eden he lost fellowship with God he lost eternal life he lost Dominion all over the earth and the title dided was Return to the original owner but in his last days hallelujah praise God the title did of redemption is coming back again on Earth to restore what Adam lost in this last day restore fellowship with God restore eternal life and going back to the Eden again praise the lord it's the title deed of redemption revealed is the literal claiming of the book because the book is really a people and that is what he is really opening he is opening the mystery of time people Christ and his bride fully revealed in his last days very good wow praise be to God what a privileged people we are that's right that the secret was hidden from ages and from generation but is now in our generation is being made manifest being made Hallelujah visible made clear amen praise the Lord don't look at your trials look at the promise and rejoice that's right because we are born in sin trials and persecution Trials come our way all the time that's right you cannot say I don't want this I don't want no the more you don't want the more it goes and sometimes sin fascinate before he assassinate sin is beautiful and sometimes you are fascinated but then you will be praise God assassinated amen continuing with Christ is the mystery of God revealed but God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ amen amen amen what a man with authority when you speak yeah no one can argue about it because what God's great mystery that the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ then was given out down to his church what was once in God's mind is now present tense in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church Church his bride Whispering secret to her Hallelujah Am Prepared darling we have a honeymoon I have already prepared a place for us it's a five star hotel Hallelujah with the king bed Deluxe bed prepare it's a secret and no one knows about it it's just between you and your hasand Hallelujah we are rejoicing because nobody knows about about this except the Bride of Jesus Christ because it is a secret thing that God is Whispering to his bride you know I prepare a g for you we have a first class airplane Hallelujah because in the moment in the twinkling of we will be and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them those who lost their loved ones don't worry that's right they will rise first before they meet Christ amen we will meet with them first praise Lord we will meet them first before we meet Christ because in the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive will not hinder them amen and we will be caught up together before we met Christ amen hallelujah what a privileged people don't be Hallelujah don't worry that your love is going before us but we will meet us first before we meet the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ Whispering secret to her that's what God Christ is doing to the church he's letting her know the secret just the secret not the spur I mean his wife that's the secret that's why when you have a secret don't let anybody know you will be jadiz that's right that's why the prophet said don't don't don't reveal the secret of God you're ready share the first pool second pool and it was impersonated don't don't it is just for the bride now but but his mystery is only revealed to his beloved wife that's the only one could see it amen amen no other way else yes a special class of people a beloved bride a beloved wife we are already accepted in the Beloved how do we know that we are accepted because you receive the message of the you receive it and sometimes we want to reject it but we have no capacity to reject it we are on our way to heaven hallelujah hallelujah although sometimes you plan you discouraged and sometimes you think I'm not going back to church I'm not going to serve God the more you do it the more you you you know yourself that you are here amen it happens to me the more I say this time I will say brother bam this enough for me I don't have the capacity anymore to preach I have been preaching any time but the more I think about that then the cell phone preach for me brother Mario and I cannot say no that's right praise the Lord because the gift is not ours but it is God's Gift given to the church amen that's why this is the responsibility of the fold Ministry that we will always put in remembrance the things that we have already heard don't ride don't turn on the right don't turn on the left stay in the middle of the road just like when the angel of Lord meet Joshua Hallelujah my servant Prophet Moses is already dead don't turn light don't turn on the left don't turn on the right amen just go directly and I will be with you the god of brother Braham is still the same God today right whatever God revealed to brother Ram is revealing it to the PIP Ministry so the PIP ministry will point Point them back to the balance of the word not their on their own understanding not in their own kingdom but back to the word am thank you Lord if we as the prophet if we are not preaching this mystery revealed truth then we are not preaching the message of the hour denominational type of preaching it can make you feel good right there are so many sermons that can make you feel good but there's only one sermon that can turn a rupture faith and that is the mystery of the hour this mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one could see it period oh you're so boastful if you say that I don't care but that's what the prophet said that is what the word said only the bride what you receed share it to other Els and they will rejected you but for the Bride of Jes Jesus Christ even though you cannot explain it you receive it and embrace it that's right his mystery is only revealed to his beled bride can you say amen amen if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you need to Rejoice tonight that's right you cannot help yourself to Rejoice because this mystery is not for everybody it is for his beloved wife and if you are the wife of Jesus Christ you need to Rejoice because the has arrived that we are no longer Hallelujah am we have no capacity to turn back anymore prise the Lord hallelujah that's right few more step and by and by we will just leave it everything will be leave here but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against the truth of the revelation of this mirle but the bride is standing on it that's her stand Hallelujah all hell is against this truth just like when they accuse the Lord Jesus Christ you a son of a car you anit my child you make yourself a god blasphemy we that are born in sin come to the word speaking lies our neighbors not about us but yet we can say we are the Bride of Jesus Christ all Hells against those mystery you can open all the YouTube the social media they will be against the prophet in this last days but the bride has already received Hallelujah the proposal of the bridegroom Hallelujah I have already prepared a place for you Hallelujah I have already prepar the place for you and that's what our stand because the groom or the pride is part of the groom amen just like Eve is a part of Adam Eve doesn't know who she was that's right good but he when she was presented in Adam Adam said you are now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh amen hallelujah the same likewise in our day we are Bor of his bone fles of his flesh revelation of his SC Revelation continuation of his Revelation because without us he could not be called God because God is an object of worship and many are worshiping the false god but God hallelujah has a true worshiper that's why you as a true worshipper make him God because without you he cannot be called God because God is an object of worship we are the true worshipper of God in this life let's make him God because we are part of him amen he cannot deny us that's why all hell is against this truth right he will bombard you with all praise God persecutions and trials and unbelief right but the bride stand in the word of God because it was already a revelation all hell is against this truth of Revelation just like Peter was who am I to you who am I to them oh thou are the prophet oh th are this how about you it comes to a personal revelation it's not oh what is the church mean what is the church group what is your group mean by this or do no how about you amen good question don't tell me about what anybody else say don't tell me what anybody's teaching right how do you know the message of the come on brother Hallelujah it will take the Holy Spirit revealed into your heart that you can say this day the scripture is fulfilled I recognize my day I recognize my position I recognize my part in this prophecy in fact we are the people of Prophecy being made manifest in this last day and all hell is against this amen truth but the bride is standing on this that's her stand he said why do you hunger Church why do you go to church on Wednesday night why do you hunger on I believe we don't come here just to be SE that's right or to check our attendance brother Ron I am here present you're hungering for something and sometimes you don't know and some you are hungering why do you thirst you are hungering and you are tting amen is the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you that's why you are hungry and thirsty it's your father trying to reveal this secret to you thank you Lord but you let many things get out of you oh Lord don't reveal it to me yet I don't want to serve with all everything cuz I have my plan I have this I have that I have my plan please don't reveal it to me yet cuz I'm not really ready to surrender myself that's right so let many things get out of you you let your job I need to have triple job I need a job I need a job I need a job job is okay you need to support each other but if our job hinders you to serve God you better seek God first that's right the kingdom of God because he is trying to reveal something to you you let your job you let your wife and you know that wife is a byproduct right you let your wife let brother bu me this buy me that buy me but not all white that like that amen you let your husband you let your children you let cares of the word you let some pastors you let somebody else get out get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're a thirsty hungry it's God trying to reveal it to you the Revelation the last day what the minor said the last day is here as brother Ron said the last day have arrived there is no more turning back Hallelujah that's why don't let those hinder you in the revelation God is trying to reveal himself to you but you let so many things under you your job your wife everything your trial and persecution Tri and sometime you say I don't want to go to church anymore I have this so many trials but that is not that the real life the real life is in the word of God we will live everything because when you are spiritually strong even know how hard is the trial the persecution it will overcome if you have the word in God that's right because the word of God bring healings healings for the Gentile is through the spoken word that's why when a gentile come to Jesus Christ if you say this if you say that Gentiles are healed by the spoken word he gave us his word and we healed us hallelujah so if you are spiritually strong all the obstacle all the trials all the persecution the word in you will control your spirit and it will control your flesh that's why they said oh you're so poor you know but I still love the Lord because he promised in PM when David expressed himself to God he said H when I was young and now I am old right but I never seen the righteous forsaketh or begging bread God always supplies our needs according to the riches oh his glory we just need to uh seek his kingdom first if you are thirsting praise God if you are hungering let him be the first because he is trying to reveal himself to you are you happy amen then I weigh close I already bring my message Hallelujah and continue on with the last quote so if the musicians should come Hallelujah God we have arrived amen we are now in the point of no return Hallelujah we see in the Horizon what is being in store for us I have prepared a place for you Hallelujah so let's keep moving on let's be inspired in spite of our trial and testing and persecution that's why satisfaction is better than success amen because success is based upon what anybody else tells you but satisfaction is within your soul right amen you may not have everything that this world offer but if you are satisfied you are blessed we have a roof above us we have a cloth to wear we have a foot on our table we have shoes for our feet what a blessed people we are that is the real life that is the real message of the hour not what somebody else dictate us on don't let us be molded by somebody else comments let us walk according to God's revelation in our heart don't care what anybody else says just like you know he don't care what anybody else says he don't care about anybody he just walk in the light as God is in the light until God translate him that is our status now they said it was in the days of Enoch the seventh from Adam we are now in the 7even churches amen and it will take effect in our generation that's right maybe this 2024 who knows just keep on moving amen hallelujah he the head is the first fruit of the Resurrection yes he is the first fruit of the rest is that right then what is he he's the head of the body which is his church the bride then the body bride must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery listen to this it's impossible for it not to go in the first Direction he was the head so if the head is resurrected the body will follow amen hallelujah and he said it's impossible for it not to go Hallelujah the rupture is a sure promise because the first fruit is already being raised and we as the body of Jesus Christ will follow the head wherever the head the the the body follows oh my it's part of God's mystery how God revealed himself here and raise it up by the word and so he revealed the church and raised it up by the same word it's part of his threefold mystery Hallelujah that's why in Romans 8:11 but if the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen the body must follow the head hallelujah it's impossible for him not to go and as the continue on in Christ The Mystery of God revealed as the head was sto from the grave so must the body follow him back to Eden where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must must follow the bride because that's the head and the head's revealed and came back with eternal life Hallelujah I was once dead but now I'm alive amen because I live you shall live also Hallelujah and the body must follow that because it is husband and wife again just like it was in the beginning in the original creation God created Adam and Eve male and female Hallelujah but it was marred by unbelief but now praise God it is being restored back again in this generation praise the Lord it is H by wom and as long as you're pregnated with the same word which is his body you took his body because in him when you took the word not the qu the word make a text for this afternoon to go my wouldn't be wonderful see just think of it now what it is therefore the body cannot recognize don't you fail this don't you fail this he said the body therefore cannot recognize any other headship but the word that's right Hallelujah cuz the head is connected with the body and the head is the word and it's the same word one headship therefore denominations and holy fathers and everything else is dead is done it's nothing it cannot give you rapturing Faith it's done there's one headship and that's Christ and the body only recognize one thing Hallelujah the word as he is the word you are the word so let us that time together and I trust that it will challenge you it will revive you it will put in remembrance the things that we have already heard amen this is not a time to be weary this is not time to be sad this is a time to be Rejoice because the mystery of God what was in the back part of his mind before there was a stardust before there was a moon is now being revealed to his reent his bride that's the only one that he promised to reveal himself what a privilege people we are not even worthy that's right the grace of God but he do it anyhow Oh Praise hallelujah thank you Lord therefore denomination and holy fathers and everything is dead and done everything else is done for the Bride of Jesus there's one headship and that Christ and the body only recognize one thing the word that's why at the ending Paul said for we know in part and sign part
