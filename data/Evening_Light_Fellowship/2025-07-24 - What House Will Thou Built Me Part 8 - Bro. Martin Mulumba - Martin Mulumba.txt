that while we were yet sinners, you died for us. &gt;&gt; Lord, that we have a new and a lively hope this evening. So, we just ask that you would be in the song service.

Thank you. &gt;&gt; How we love you, Lord, for the price that you paid on the cross for this great plan, Lord, Father God, of redemption, for leading the way and showing the way. Because without way, Lord, Father God, there's no walking, Father. We will l father God know we're about to abide Lord Jesus. We will know Lord Father with that where to leave because only you is life. &gt;&gt; Everything else Lord Father God has a beginning and the end &gt;&gt; but because you loved us that's why you're bringing us back to eternity &gt;&gt; whereby we standing Lord Father God coair with Christ this hour &gt;&gt; standing in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus at this hour. Yes. &gt;&gt; May you come and join us in the meeting. Take over the service. Lord, &gt;&gt; we praise you, Lord, Father, for what you've done already in the song service through the cleaning and sound engineers and all the hidden offices and prayer warriors, Lord, in unseen places behind the doors. Father, such a time for to invite you because we know no one is greater among us all save Christ. you are Lord Father God and bring us higher into your presence Lord. &gt;&gt; We ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless yours tonight. Uh while we are standing, let's uh take the book of uh Exodus chapter 40. We'll uh read few verses here and there but God's grace to help us uh take the reading tonight. Um verse 16 uh Exodus 40:1 16 verse 1-6 uh God is speaking to Moses do this go do that thus did Moses according to all that the Lord commanded him so did he so shall we and it came to pass in the first month in the second year on the first day of the month we understand that's the month of Abib um around probably March or April overlapping there that the tabernacle was read up at the time harvest time that the tabernacle was erected. Exodus 40:33 he ridded up uh the court round about the tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the court's gates. So Moses finished the work. He started from all the way from the mountain. Received the visitation, receive angelic visitation, he received the commission, he received the signs in the end, everything all the miracles all the way down to for this purpose. Then verse 34, then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud abode there on. No presence of a man in the God's tabernacle. God himself takes over the work and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. 36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys. Each person with the journeys. We have to know our journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We came from eternity. We started in uh Genesis 15 with the promise of the seed was not materialized to the seed that was made perfect manifest to the seed that had to make the choice of the uh of the lamp. Now the same seed now has ridded up the tabernacle. The cloud came down for this great purpose. But if the cloud were not taken up, then the journey not till the day that this was taken up. Every move was commanded by the cloud. When the cloud move, people move. When the cloud doesn't move, you can move. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So in order to move without uh vision, people are wondering. For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle, but day and fire was was on it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all the journeys. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. Uh we'll be uh finishing up by God's grace uh God willing tonight uh with uh our little subject that we started from uh the beginning of the year. This will be part eight. Uh, what house wil thou build me? By God's grace, we'll just uh give it a little title, a little uh subject there of shalom. After working so hard throughout all this journey, then uh there's a time of fellowship. It is a time of shalom. after we've endured such uh such a great journey where about uh we go and uh labor so hard along the journey it comes to you to a point where we understand that oh it is the Lord it's been the Lord all this all this why because we understand that when Moses went up the mountain and speaking with uh with the Lord that people could only hear thunders and they couldn't understand what was happening but then there come now a time where about the tabernacle was erected now even Moses himself couldn't get into the tabernacle because if it's just taking what the pastor says well but then there's a time not even the pastor will understand what is happening Mary looked at Jesus and he couldn't understand what was happening with this boy why was this boy so distinct and so uh peculiar from all the rest of the boys in this journey I'm not talking about historically I'm talking about us because we had these people that once upon a time we look like everybody else then all this journey that at times that throughout the services and uh uh you hear the feedback that oh that part was a little too harsh and yes the the the the the gold had to be beaten in order to reflect the image of uh of of the smith of the lockmith because without him seeing his reflection, he has to go all the way in order to do that. So we understand that uh building this tabernacle is not an easy journey. It's not a picnic that we come about as we see in the world today. He comes on his knees and and proposes to you and uh takes you to the restaurant every day. But then then there will be a time he tells you go onto the field and go and uh get me some uh uh flowers and get me you go there. Oh, but I thought you told me to get the flowers. Now here all the uh the the the pins and all the the hurting and uh I'm getting into the mud and all this year that people are criticizing me. Yes. Because that's the program of erecting the tabernacle in order to make this tabernacle stand up. It was not a man-made desire to come and stand before the Lord said, "Lord, this is what I need to do." Like Cain came and say, "I'll bring some beautiful flowers and some good design." He said, "No, no, no, no, no, no. It has to be a messy work." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to in today's life, we don't like messy work. We like everything smooth. Don't offend anybody. Be politically correct. No, no, no, no, no, no. We need some mercy work. &gt;&gt; You need your healing. Oh no. This is not for you. This is I can't give uh children bread to dogs. Oh my god. The pastor said that to me. I'm not going back to that church anymore. &gt;&gt; It is a messy work. And that messy work is a continuous messy work until we leave the earth. &gt;&gt; Until we put the seal of approbation, we seal the wagon and then we move on. It will always be a mercy work. But nevertheless, but then in the midst of all that, we receive a shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the midst of all that mercy work, there is a shalom. Then you start wondering how come this journey is so hard but I'm still able to keep on. &gt;&gt; It's not because you are able to do it. &gt;&gt; Because we've seen in the book of Revelation is always God said go and do this. Tell the children of Israel go and do this. All throughout the journey it was always God said Moses did. The people did. God said Moses said the people did. Right? &gt;&gt; So therefore we understand the pattern. If God is spoken a prophet must speak and when the prophet speaks then we have to do &gt;&gt; and in order to do it's a hard journey to start to move from the earthly to the heavenly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother say that we are very heavy in this dimension but we have to be lifted up in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. But in order to get into the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, as we've seen before, that it requires to understand a pattern of approaching him, in order to know how to approach God and how to receive a favor from God. You can't go to God and try to play and trick God and say like, you know, oh, you know, I I have need of this. You know, I promise you I'll be a good boy if you give me a housewife. If you give me a car, a job, a business, and all this, he knows what's behind all all that. &gt;&gt; Then he has to put you to test. &gt;&gt; And when he puts you to test, then it's a hard time to wait. I've been waiting for a whole year for this promise to happen. &gt;&gt; Abraham, I'll give you a child, but you have to wait 25 years. What? How's that even possible? I can't do that. I can't wait for all this time here. I am the Lord. Walked out before me and be perfect. &gt;&gt; Really? I have to. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I put you there on the pedestal as the father of faith. Wow. &gt;&gt; Brandom, you are the prophet. Yeah, that's good. But then understand the work that you're going to go through. It's going to be a messy work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to make mistakes along the way. I'm going to punish you with Amibia. I'm going to punish you with all this year and I'm going to put you in a very tough position. You're going to lose your wife. You're going to lo lose your brothers. You're going to lose your parents. &gt;&gt; It is a messy work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we read in the Bible that all the children of Israel in their journeys, each one of us, you can look back and you said, "Oh yeah, this is my journey." And we call it my my experience. That's my journey. Oh, I came from this humble beginnings. Oh, I didn't know what the message was. Oh, yes, it was a messy work. The time that we spend in prayer and supplications. What is this message all about? It is a messy work. And yet, yet you see the attraction of the world on one hand. Oh, Brennham, why don't you come with us? Oh, don't you have a girlfriend? You a Can't you smoke? Oh, look at you. You're not connected. You don't know what's going on. You don't have Oh, don't you are you not on Snapchat, Tik Tok? What kind of person are you? You're weird. &gt;&gt; A messy work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a time. But in the midst of all that, &gt;&gt; he said, "Be not afraid. &gt;&gt; It is high." &gt;&gt; And he keeps giving us the journey ahead in order to understand. though misunderstood by the world but seen by the father that we are doing the proper work and this journey in which that we have started in the book of uh uh exodus uh starting in the book of Genesis with Abraham himself. I looked at it I said Lord what a what a message for myself. I looked at my life and I said, "Oh, look my look at every stage of my life." I came to understand even what is happening now with me. I said like, you know, for the last few weeks I was sitting I was like it doesn't make any sense. I'm preaching. I'm doing this here. I'm serving the Lord and I'm going through this. Yeah. I have to pay the price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I pay the pri when I pay the price, it may not even be seen by anybody outside. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he's working the very inside of my being. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When I come and I preach here, I will just go out there. So then then what's next? What is happening? I have all these ideas in my in my head, but I need to wait until he comes down and tells me what journey to take, what route to take. Because if we just go by knowledge quickly, we find ourselves into just verbalizing before the church, line up the scriptures and put it out there and uh then I'll just read one quote after another, the service is over. But then I have to pay the price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I have to wait in prayer. &gt;&gt; Even at times I've spent all these years alone and when you spend all that time then now you have somebody next to you. She's observing you everything you're doing. When is he praying? When when does this how how does it work? Then you look at it. It's like, oh, this is a new stage of the journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People used to wonder about it from people from outside. Now it's somebody that you with 24/7. Then you're just like, "Oh." But I told her, I say, "Listen, it's not an external work. It's an inside work." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we can be called husband and wife, but it goes deeper than that. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because I can just we can just sit here and I can just tell you you know Bernham say Bernham say I have that knowledge but it's not about that because the purpose here is to show that it's not just a sermon but it's a way of life that he's expecting us to go all the way in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And once you go all the way in, everything that I'll be speaking about us, it'll be so much clear, so much precise that I don't have to say it twice. So it is with the church. All this journey that we see that the children of Israel came along, it was not erected tent in order for people to see us. Of course, people will see the manifestations of sons and daughters of God, but that's not the point here. But he wants us in the holy of holies for a specific purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because church attendance is good. Supporting the cause is good. Paying our tithes and offerings is good. Confessing our sins and all that is good. But then brother Ram says, you see, just be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Just live a good life. &gt;&gt; But then this year, God will give it to you if it's yours. What is that that that God has to give to you if he wants to? &gt;&gt; Because Peter looked at Jesus and said, "What about John? What about him? &gt;&gt; What is that unto you?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What did he say next? Follow thou me. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a public show anymore. &gt;&gt; When we put our dresses and our uh h shirts and suits and stuff, that's a public display. &gt;&gt; That's our first pool, our second pool. Oh, he thinks right. He's very polite and all these things here. People can see that. But then when it goes beyond there, &gt;&gt; that three-fold mystery of that seven seal, it can be a public thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even to the one next to you because even Mida asked him and said, "What about when we get there? How is it going to be like? Are you going to have hope on me?" He came to him and said, "Hey, do you know these uh seven uh trumpets? God has given them to me. I have to get a 10 to get the people there." God said, "No, no, no, no. It's not profitable for the church." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why was God keeping all these things secret? Why was the prophet standing there and goes to the motel and tells the brother and say like you know hey cut this section and I'm going to make another recording and he tells the people and say hey you know what I heard it oh no I didn't hear I saw it oh no actually just leave your Christian life come to Esther and tell her hey it's this time or nothing. All the public display that Esther was doing, going and putting and being natural and all these thing, not cutting the hair and all these things, that time was over. &gt;&gt; That time was over because this tabernacle that we are building is not a tabernacle made out of man's hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because a man's hand will tell you, "Put the shirt, put the tie, you need to cut your hair this way because we don't want people to look like this and all these things." Yeah. On under that ministry, it is correct. &gt;&gt; Under that anointing, it is correct &gt;&gt; because it is a partial revelation that you received. But then once under the full manifestation comes into view, it is a whole different thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this seven seal mystery started at the time of the burning of the fig tree. But it didn't begin with the full revelation. &gt;&gt; It begins with a partial revelation. I said, "Hey, I'll give you the first gift. If thou be sincere, then you'll have the next one." Then he gets the second one. Then afterward, I'll give you more, but hang on tight. He said, "Sir, I'll receive more. I can wait for that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then everybody's like, "Hey, can't we have you here's a check a,500 All kind of distractions start coming in. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, you know you can have this year. You know you can have this year. He said, "No, no, no, no, no. That's not a purpose where I'm called on to." He was on a certain journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then when we look back in our lives, we have to be sure of our journey. &gt;&gt; If we are B, brother Metan, where where do you come from? I don't know. Where you going? I don't know. What do you have scheduled up? I don't know. Why are you coming to church? Well, that that comes to church. He told me to come to church. Where you come from? Oh, I believe if I go to ancestry.com, I'll be able to retrace my ancestry. But that will only get you so far on your earthly journey. &gt;&gt; That's right. But then the where you started in the heavenly journey no ancestry no books no record will be able to give it to you. &gt;&gt; But instead this earthly journey will just be as much confusing splitting as we have seen under Nimrod &gt;&gt; because Nimrod religion will come and give you a new definition of yourself &gt;&gt; and under that teaching of Nimrod is a divide and conquer. And after conquering you under that confusion, then you become the false prophet under that anointing. But it is not the same as you are under the seventh seal anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we started on last Sunday, the the Sunday we started uh we saw that uh we talk a little bit about the four uh the five requirements to receive the revelation but we I was unable to finish it as the word as it opens up the more you go and the more you start realizing certain things you say you can just finish it up. Then he brought me back to something that was happening in the church while I was preaching. And I said on that service, I said, "Bear with me." As I'm taking my time to get up there. I didn't understand why I said it myself. Then I went back. I said, "Oh, it makes sense. different anointing that we are preaching with leads things in a certain manner. &gt;&gt; At times he's conscious of his children that certain things need to be broken down slowly so there's no confusion in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure. &gt;&gt; But then now this afternoon you can see how happy I am that I say yes. &gt;&gt; I can't explain this. It is so important to each one of us. &gt;&gt; Not to stay in the outer courts. &gt;&gt; Let's go in. I beseech us &gt;&gt; that once you take this message for yourself, not for the church gathering and you spend time with it, &gt;&gt; you're going to experience those anointing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In music, &gt;&gt; in prayer, in preaching, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Church is one thing. Burnham say says you see like Mary Mary was just standing there. &gt;&gt; She was just a place like this one where people come and ged to but church is not the thing &gt;&gt; but it is the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see along our life journey he comes and gives us a little bit more today &gt;&gt; a little bit more tomorrow. a little bit more again. &gt;&gt; And then when you come and you get into that full restoration, it can only be a shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you look back and you see that journey and say, "I've walked this walk. &gt;&gt; Was that really me? &gt;&gt; Was this me who left this? Was this me who was struggling with this high heels and tie skirts? Oh, what a shalom. &gt;&gt; What a place of rest. &gt;&gt; I was out there sneaking around and playing with men, playing with women without anybody seeing me, not unable to live freely. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then I made the decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I have decided &gt;&gt; to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; The world behind me, the cross before me. &gt;&gt; And then when you get to that cross, then you said, "Oh, there's a cleansing flow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Flowing from Emmanuel's vein &gt;&gt; and it's flowing daily. Then you say, "Thank you for the cross." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the work you've done. Then he tells you, "Come, I'll show you more." Amen. &gt;&gt; Come, I'll show you more. &gt;&gt; Then the next fellow wants to understand why you so happy. &gt;&gt; Explain it to me. &gt;&gt; Make it a good sermon as a nay introductions, development, and make make it plain to me. I can't. &gt;&gt; It is a forbidden language. &gt;&gt; But I can show you the way. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the way. &gt;&gt; He will take you through. &gt;&gt; He is the shalom. &gt;&gt; And once he get you there, you'll come out. &gt;&gt; And you'll be just as happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this shalom is not a public show. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though human flesh can only express the happiness, but it's not enough to express it. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; You can be as happy because as happy you can be running on the street. A drunk man can also be as happy as you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the manifestation in the articles. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; As eloquent I can be or you can be or how you can write and they say about it, he will never get it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The prophet tried. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he said, you see, just be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And I sit there. I'm looking. I said, wow, these things are so real. Then I looked at the next service. He says he preaches the world is falling apart. You just revealed something here and the world is falling apart. Intellectually &gt;&gt; it's a contradiction. Right? &gt;&gt; You can have a shalom and then the world start falling apart &gt;&gt; because when you come they told us in church it is a time of peace that's where the separation start coming into view &gt;&gt; to whom the word of the lord has been revealed who has believed our report. I beseech us tonight not to listen to me intellectually. &gt;&gt; It won't work. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But open the inner man &gt;&gt; to receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at the appointed time, you'll be able to say, "Oh, this is my journey." &gt;&gt; This is exactly what I'm saying in my life at this time. I'm not confused at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm my my life is so clear before my path I said that few weeks I was wondering &gt;&gt; what is happening why am I going through this why is this here then you had to come and take the word and open the word &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; wouldn't be a wonderful thing that when we sit with each one of us in fellowship you said Brother, I know what it is for me. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; William Brham says, "I sit there in the room and I saw it. I heard it." &gt;&gt; Because right now everybody's listening, but can any of everybody see it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can everybody hear it? &gt;&gt; Because all of us will say, "Brother, are you the tabernacle of the Lord?" Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Bible say I am the temple of God. Everybody will say it. Sister, are you the temple? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have all my virtues all in place. I am came into marriage according to the word and everything. Did the cloud come down? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; I am the wisest man, you know. I am I have a good reputation in town. King Solomon. Everybody's in peace with me according to the word. building the tabernacle. Solomon, did the cloud come down? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that answer you can fool it. &gt;&gt; You can come and say, well, you know, I am baptized with the Holy Ghost. You know, you know, in this day, this is the hour. This is my experience. It's a whole different thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a whole different journey. and hear the Lord. And now he's showing us &gt;&gt; by his grace to say, well, it will require the ability to hear from God. &gt;&gt; It will require a requirement. It's not maybe I will have it, maybe I won't have it. It is a must. &gt;&gt; Let me push a little bit forward. Cain heard from God. Right. &gt;&gt; Pain heard from God &gt;&gt; and God told him do like your brother. &gt;&gt; But it's not that kind of hearing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because when you only hear with this natural here, you're going to miss it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my position. Oh, this is what I know. This is what brother Bam say, black and white. But you're still missing it. How come you're standing in the presence of God? God is talking to you and you can't hear it. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; I'm going to jump a little bit here. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham speaks here in the message exposition of the seven church ages smearing church age. It says to further bring out what we've just said and to also use the scripture that should be born in mind as we talk about who it is that is baptized with the Holy Ghost. See what Jesus said in John 6:46 uh 6:45. It is written in the prophet and they shall all be taught of God. But turn into Isaiah 54:13. Hence this uh this is taken and and it reads and all children shall be taught of the Lord and all of God are the children of God. Thus it thus it is that the evidence of of being a true child of God in whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the ho by the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. being taught individually &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Where has thy strengthen gone? Samson paragraph 43. Now I think that's just the way a lot of our seminary teaching and knowledge does too much of canary brain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Canary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We go about knowledge in the head, knowledge in the head, knowledge in the head, and we miss it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh brother, if you just believe the message of the hour, you got it, brother. Brother, you need to be there in church to prove that the Holy Ghost is in you. You have to come in church. That's true, brother. But that too much of cannorary brain. &gt;&gt; Intellectual teaching in other word. &gt;&gt; But we don't want that. &gt;&gt; We don't desire that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We can't understand the mysteries of God by knowledge &gt;&gt; because it's only revealed by the Holy Ghost as it will reveal. &gt;&gt; The mystery is here in the is the mystery here. It is the mystery. A mystery is a scripture. We go on to the next scripture, brother. Is the previously hidden truth now divinely revealed. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Of course we speak about the outer court and holy place. Yes. That is known of all can be impersonated by all. But that mystery I'm not just talking about the mystery that we can read about in the in the message because we just read in the Bible. He says that the children of Israel went each one in the journeys plural. Otherwise, oh brother, this is the mystery of God, the message of the hour. Yes, that's true. The Catholic Church today have the message on record. They study it day and night. They know exactly how to present it. They can even they are even better in explaining the message of William Brennham. &gt;&gt; But then the mystery of God it is a scripture that was once hidden divinely revealed. &gt;&gt; And that revelation is not a public show. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a me of me coming and explaining it to the church. Oh, you are the bride. Everybody can say that. &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin could say so. &gt;&gt; They had oil in the lamps. &gt;&gt; And having oil in the lamps is not enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. The greater the mystery a uh divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remain despite the revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We read the message of the hour. We have all this wonderful revelation. Despite that revelation, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Something still mysterious still attached to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Yes. But yeah, but say like you know the word is revealed. Yes. Then what is that element that is attached to it? It is a special thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then when it comes to us, you say, "Yes, &gt;&gt; it makes sense." &gt;&gt; I know the church can be as humble as it can be, as simple as it can be. But I'm pointing us to that element that it's not a shouting mother, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of amen. &gt;&gt; But it is a thing of brother, get in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, brother. I've read the message. I know this here. I listen to the tape every day. I know. But I'm calling us to that place. Amen. &gt;&gt; When nobody has ever been before but only you alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And once you get to that place, it is a different talk. The message becomes a whole different message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Burnham lists all kind of mystery. The mystery of godliness, the uh the mystery of uh iniquities and all these things here. We can all read about it. My message is going to be very short, but God's grace, God willing, but this place of shalom. Oh, paragraph 259 of the same message. No such a thing as an eternal burning hell. You'll burn millions for years. But anything that was eternal had never had a beginning or an end. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And hell was created. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. All these mysteries. Amen. &gt;&gt; The mysteries of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation, we we we saw it. But the person, listen to this, but the person of Christ performing in you the same work that he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is that work? What is that work, brother? I'm a preacher. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We know. But what is that work? Each one of us I like that calm quiet in the church. What is that work? &gt;&gt; God in you. &gt;&gt; Yes, he's in us. We know what is that work because William Brham when if you are a good tape listener or good student of the message you can see brother Brham along the ages along his life he preaches one thing here another one here then one here he's struggling with this year he comes oh you know obedience is better than sacrifice yesterday I was supposed to preach on a uh Sir, what? Um, uh, watchman, what is of the night? But I didn't. Ah, I'm sorry, Lord. Yeah. Longong along his life journey. But then when he comes to him and tells him, I'll meet you in there. He says, I'm standing here. This is 1956. He say, I'm standing here. The thing that he told me until I go in the grave, I'll never say it. I'm not talking just about church attendance. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about, oh, I'm I'm a preacher only this year. Go and verify it. You say, I'm standing here. Until then, I'll never say it. &gt;&gt; Each one of us, we need to get to that point. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as I am talking, I'm wrapping this. It's we building the tabernacle. We know all these things here. But then now comes the place where about we just read in the Bible. Moses was unable to get into the tabernacle because the cloud was there. I shouldn't be able to walk into that place because he has taken over &gt;&gt; because all the elders stood outside while Ruth and Boaz went inside. &gt;&gt; What was happening in there? &gt;&gt; What kind of conversation takes place? What are we looking for in this hour? All of us are message believers by the by the face value. &gt;&gt; It will require supernatural instruction. Not just a student comparing verse with verse. Barabam says though that is good but a mystery. Next uh part please so at least people can have the reference. Next. Next. Seems like you don't have it. Nevertheless, it will require supernatural instructions. Not just a student comparing verse with verse, though that is good. Listen to brother Brandham. I'm reading from a church age book. But a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You first have to hear from him and he has to instruct it. &gt;&gt; Otherwise it will never be clear. &gt;&gt; This is the issue that we have in the message church today. You come and you listen to a sermon, you go out so confused that you do you get upset with the minister. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And once you get upset with the minister, the next time he's preaching, you're not excited to hear it. &gt;&gt; And that's why I understand. That's why I said it made sense to me. that it requires him to come and teach us. &gt;&gt; And if we still at the level of I when I pray, I didn't hear God talk to me and I think I'll just do what things good to me. &gt;&gt; We are in trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the next time he will come and talk to you, &gt;&gt; he'll be so confused &gt;&gt; on why should you do that when it seems so right to any human mind to do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise it will never come become clear and once it becomes clear say you become a notball. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. You become misunderstood by the world. Brother Brham, he said, "Dad," Billy Paul said, "Dad, you're doing wrong. You can't leave the missionary work." He said, "No, I didn't promise him that. If he's the one that that with back there and whatever all the experiences that I'm experiencing along my life journey, I can't go back there. You say I'll go meet banks and do what I can do and provide for my family and all these things here. Then he comes to him. He say by this you'll know when you go to Mexico you'll see this here you will see those dead fishes. Nobody knew about it. Billy Paul couldn't understand why was that leaving the work and go back there. It seems reasonable to serve the Lord, right? It seems so reasonable to come to church every day. &gt;&gt; It seems so reasonable to human mind to Mida and to Billy Paul that you can do that you can't leave God's work and to go find a job. &gt;&gt; That's human mind. &gt;&gt; Brother, the brother left the church. Oh, this is this year. And he does to human mind. Yes. &gt;&gt; But then once you get into that relationship, he will take you into places that even yourself wouldn't make sense. &gt;&gt; That's what I said that to myself too. It was so &gt;&gt; it's not just a sermon. It it is such a pain to be found in certain position in life. I was in Colorado. The Lord comes and tells me, "You need to go." I say, "What's happening?" I'm serving you. I'm doing this here. I have the Sundays. I have the young people. I have the media. I'm the trustee. I'm I'm the interpreter. I'm preaching. I'm serving you. &gt;&gt; What do you mean to go? Go where? Why? &gt;&gt; Tell me. Make make it understandable. He comes again. You must go. Nah, I don't believe this. I don't see any scripture that anybody will just leave the church to go somewhere without any understanding of who shall follow him. &gt;&gt; Then the Lord had to go and find a sister in France that I never seen. call that man, tell him this, this, this. Then when she comes and tells me, if she ever walks in the room, I'll never know it's her until she presents herself. She said, "Brother, I saw you. I came. I wanted to greet you, but you left. You started going this way. You were with such a people." I said, "I don't know anybody of that form until I get to Arizona. Then I find myself say the sister so right. &gt;&gt; Then I find myself in Mexico. It's like the Lord saw me before then. &gt;&gt; But to my human mind, it couldn't make sense &gt;&gt; without that vision. Then I said, "Lord, forgive me. You're bringing me this life journey. I think that my life is limited to a church &gt;&gt; to a certain association. &gt;&gt; But he wants you to go places that you never seen before. &gt;&gt; That's why we read that when the cloud lifted up and went, the children of Israel went also. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone in the journey, it's not a public show. &gt;&gt; One of the minister told me, "Brother, if it doesn't work out where you go, just come back." I said, "Brother, I hope so." And it's been three years. I haven't went back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's how the Lord and I'm giving this example so it can be a little bit more clear that this seven seal revelation is not a collective thing. &gt;&gt; It's not to be understood by all. It's not to be understood by yourself. is not to be clear in your mind because our canary brain in our seminary told us you assign yourself to this group of people &gt;&gt; and that's what Nimro did. We when we if we you can if you can remember when we read in Branham in the what house will thou build me prior to those years he said every time the Lord give gives me any new sermon I'll come back to the tabernacle to preach it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; but then when he preaches what house will thou build me what does he say he said here I am with brother perigrine in standing up the church. I don't have to go back to Jeffersonville anymore and I can do it from here. &gt;&gt; That seven seal goes beyond human understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can be in this life journey going left and right and thinking like you know this is my career life and this is what I'm planning to do. This is how I'm going to do it. This is first step, second step. Then he comes and tells you scrap all that. Go this way. &gt;&gt; What do you mean go this way? &gt;&gt; I spend time in research and development. I should live this year. I can testify. I've been through it all my life. Burnham says mida calls me a restless wind. Today I'm here. I can't sit. Then he say, "Oh," he says, "I am homesick. I'm tired. I want to go home." But then where is home? &gt;&gt; He said, "But look at all the place where I grew up at. All the houses been broken down and they have all this type of development here. We have no continuing city." &gt;&gt; That's right. And for that to become clear in this journey of ours when we want to associate ourself with the rest of the group I got you my friend you know we have to stick together you know let's go all together they was like you know leave your wife leave your children go sit down there you need to spend some time with me &gt;&gt; and the wife here what kind of husband are you I didn't sign up for is &gt;&gt; those stages of your life it is tough. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's why the mystery requires a teaching of the spirit &gt;&gt; or otherwise he will never become clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to understand my brother. What's your name? Where you come from? What's your death father? What's your background? What's your interest? It's like oh this is what it looks like. Oh this I know if I go back to him he's the one who can help me. But then when the angel of the Lord comes to him and say leave all that demeanor leave all that smile keep your face face there. Go in there don't greet anybody. Go there until I speak to you. Then the person comes like what is wrong with this brother? The brother's backs alive. He has lost the the joy of the salvation. Are you a secret sinner? &gt;&gt; All these here are examples in the Bibles that we are aware of &gt;&gt; that the Lord is bringing us one step above the other into that great shalom that that restoration of that channel of communication that nobody can decrypt. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nobody can understand why it has to be so. &gt;&gt; Why it has to be you to go through all that journey? &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Each one of us to look back in that journey and say, "I've come so far &gt;&gt; with what I called my experience. Lord, then what next? Oh my. &gt;&gt; We see Manoak wife. Judges 13:3-5. And the angel of the Lord appear unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold, now thou are barren, and beest not, but thou shalt conceive and bear a son. Now therefore be aware, I pray thee, and drink not wine, and not no strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing. For lo, thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and no resor shall come on his head, for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb, and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines. The next fellow is criticizing her. She can't bear a son. She can conceive &gt;&gt; instructions, direct instructions. &gt;&gt; Matthew 13. And he answered unto them, because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. For whosoever have to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance, but whosoever have not, from him shall be taken away, even he that he hath. Therefore, I say, speak I to them in parables, because they seeing, seeing not, see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is and and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which say by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand. Each one of us have you ever been in that place when the message doesn't make sense to you yet? &gt;&gt; It's at that place. That's right. That's true. &gt;&gt; You're only hearing a quotation being plugged here, an example of stuff being plugged here, and it doesn't make any sense. &gt;&gt; And this is what now the prophet go Jesus is telling them. Verse 15. For these people heart uh heart is a works gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have no have um eyes have they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I shall heal them. Verse 16. But blessed are your eyes, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; for they see, and your ears, for they hear. For verily I say unto you, that many prophets, &gt;&gt; and righteous men have desired. &gt;&gt; Imagine that. &gt;&gt; Have desired. Daniel said, "When will be the fulfillment of these things?" Close it, Daniel. It's not for your time. &gt;&gt; That's right. Lord, give me revelation of this, revelation of that. It tells you, wait, think about it. &gt;&gt; Abraham, I need a son. I need a son. 25 years. &gt;&gt; What is your journey? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See each person. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And for I understand that we have elders here. they can understand it better. When you elder sit there and you listen to somebody preach, you can quickly tell where he's at in the word. &gt;&gt; Yet, there's still also another person in the church who doesn't understand what that person is teaching. So therefore you understand that each one of us in our journey we are called to press harder &gt;&gt; to go deeper. &gt;&gt; Lord give me that revelation &gt;&gt; if I can go quickly to try to see if I can do if I can get to it. have desired to see those things which he see and have not seen them and to hear those things which he hear and have not heard them. Revelations um revelation of Jesus Christ church book. Now you might take what the pastor says or what the missionary um seminary teachings and though it might be talk to you with eloquence until God reveals to you that Jesus is the Christ and that is the blood that cleans you and that God is your savior, you will never have eternal life. It is a spiritual revelation that does it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Regardless of all the noise that I'm making here, let me call it noise. &gt;&gt; All this that I'm making here, clear, unclear, confusing, not confusing, very straightforward. If the spirit doesn't come down, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And reveal it, it will never become clear. &gt;&gt; That's right. Otherwise, it's just another reference quotation that be projected on the board. &gt;&gt; But that's not it. &gt;&gt; Then when the spirit comes, it is so specific &gt;&gt; because the tabernacle has been erected and the cloud has come down and now he's the one giving direct instructions. Amen. &gt;&gt; These direct instructions is not a public show. &gt;&gt; Samaran church age. Notice that Jesus here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addressed himself to only one person relative to the word for that age. God will speak to you and you alone regarding what is to you in what you have to do. &gt;&gt; Agewise, the prophet comes and gives us the message of the hour. Sure. &gt;&gt; Agewise. &gt;&gt; Then now, Ruth, Esther, Gideon, Joshua, &gt;&gt; angelic visitation for the work. They are not major prophets. &gt;&gt; But here now, it is specific to the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now when we get to that level, the message becomes a whole different book. &gt;&gt; The message can be a reference point. Brother Abraham says as much as we want, very eloquently spoken and good English, bad English, good accent, bad accent, all that you want to give to it. But until then, the message will never become clear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when we go to a market, we find all sizes of shoes and shirts and stuff, but you take only what is specific fit for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not that the rest of the shirts are not important, &gt;&gt; right? Very good. &gt;&gt; But this shirt here is the one that I need. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you take that shirt and that dress for a specific purpose. &gt;&gt; Let me bring it there. You have a shirt to sleep with. You have a shirt to work with. You have a shirt to party with. You have a shirt for some high-profile meeting. &gt;&gt; It is still you. &gt;&gt; Very good. Right. in different stages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've received the Holy Ghost. It's good, but it's not enough. &gt;&gt; But they told us to receive the Yes. &gt;&gt; Get in there. &gt;&gt; We saw William Brham receiving the Holy Ghost, right? Brother Brandham received the Holy Ghost and went and said, "Mama, something happened to me. I'm a different being." Yes, but I'll meet you in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard it. I saw it. And then the revelation. I'm hearing it. I know exactly what is happening in my life. &gt;&gt; Why is it happening? For this purpose? Because I preach this. Because as we listen to this sermon, this anointing under this type of sermons in this type of places that Barabburn was going, it requires this type of anointing that only becomes clear when you sit at the feet of the prophet. Lord, why was Barana preaching this? Why didn't he preach this here? He left this meeting going to this meeting. What is happening there? Oh, thank you, Lord, for the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just not a slogan, my brothers. &gt;&gt; It's not just a church attendance. &gt;&gt; It's not just coming here and hearing another good sermon. &gt;&gt; It's so far beyond that. &gt;&gt; It's so far beyond that. Even my words will not be able to express enough &gt;&gt; all this life journey that I've lived so far. I said, "Lord, you've given me the grace &gt;&gt; to identify these things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember those days I was sitting there. I'll never forget it. A minister came to Congo. I don't know if I can recall if it's brother Edis or one of the brothers. And he started preaching the high priest going into the temple, going into the holy of holies and and then he's the same one coming out. I'm sitting there. What does it mean? You mean barrenom going up, coming back down. So the high priest, is it the one? What's going on here? God didn't just come and oh my child because you are my child and let me explain it to you. No, I sweat it out. &gt;&gt; I had to sit down one message after the other looking deep into it after studying going into prayer. &gt;&gt; Then when it pleased him, he came down and said, "Oh, that's why we have all these doctrines of worshiping the prophet. The revelation has come. The revelation has not come. So all these debates of doctrines and stuff, it's because it's not a public thing. That's right. &gt;&gt; It requires to go down there and even yourself, you can't say it. &gt;&gt; That's why he kept it secret. Oh, that's why even the prophet himself kept it shut. It was because of this. It goes beyond human understanding. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I couldn't get to all the quotes, but by God's grace, he get I'm seeing all this here. Christ coming down and let me just read um just one quotation the seven seal then we'll close. And by God's grace and uh before I read this quotation, thank you so much brothers and sisters for all these opportunities that you always give me to stand here on the pulpit. I never take it lightly. Uh I might not be very eloquent. My way of preaching might not be very straight. because every time that I get here, I can prepare the sermon quickly. You take me different routes. So, God bless you so much. &gt;&gt; Bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Uh God willing uh starting tomorrow, I'll be uh taking some new assignments. I don't know how long it will go for. Uh you'll see. I might not be around so often, but uh as the Lord allows that to happen, we'll meet in fellowship. As I said, it was heavy on me. Yeah, it was heavy on me. I said, "What is this life? You come and you do one thing and then you after another after another." But I pray that you remember me and my wife in prayer &gt;&gt; for this uh journey ahead. She'll be around uh all the time. We have to do what we have to do is uh those chapter of our lives and that it doesn't always make sense &gt;&gt; but when it comes down &gt;&gt; that's why it's always clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Barabam says here to close seven seal. Now we into the age of the eagle the revelation to be revealed the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. the whole thing. He says, "Now, now compare this with Revelation 10, chapter 1, chapter, Revelation 10th chapter verse 1 to 10. You see the coming down of the angel, the coming down of the cloud." And uh you'll see here in this revelation and the revelation here revelation 10 1-7 that in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel message was to finish up all the mysteries of God. &gt;&gt; Let that be for you. &gt;&gt; Let's not just be church attenders. Let not be forgetful listeners, &gt;&gt; wonderful ministers that I've seen around come on the pulpit, preach differently, deeper amens and all these things here. But until we get to that level, that angel talking to us directly about those things, the mystery will never come clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we pray as the musician come? Precious heavenly father, I'm so grateful Lord to stand in your presence. Lord, I'm so happy this afternoon about thy word and seeing the anointing and your children standing there sitting there and listening. Father, I just hope Lord by no means Lord that try to be disrespectful by words, choices and all these things. Father, but do you believe, Father, that the same way that you did with the prophet, so shall you do with us. The prophet sweed it out, we have to come through the same way. Bless us, Lord. Thank you for finishing up with uh this message. Such a blessing for me, seeing all the vindications that you did uh round about it. Father, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; it is you and you alone that can do it. &gt;&gt; Here I am following the steps. Father, may you lead us, Lord, along the way. Lead me.

Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, out on the waterers, storms raging high, the waters around them were troubled by night. Fear filled their hearts. They felt they would die. They failed to remember that the master was nine. And he spoke the word. And the winds all stood still. And even the waters they obeyed his will. He calmed their storms just like he will mine. I just remember that he lives deep inside. So why should I worry? Why should I fear when the very same Jesus saves always lives in my heart and hears when I cry on call on his name till the storm passes by. We're reading the Bible. He walked with them. brought a light to their darkness when the way grew so dim. How great it would be to have his footsteps in mind to walk with the master all of the time. And when trials come and death seems so nice, I'll call on the master. I know he'll be there on time. And when sickness comes and my body is in pain, all I have to do is call on his name. So why should I worry? Why should I fear when the very same Jesus saves always? He lives in my heart. He hears when I cry. I call on his name till the storm passes by. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen.
