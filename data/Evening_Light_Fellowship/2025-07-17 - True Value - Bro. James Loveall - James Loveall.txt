Hallelujah. We give him all the praise and all the glory tonight. Amen. Brother Steven, would you come tonight? Ask brother Steven back and we'll ask him to take us to the Lord in prayer tonight. Brother Rod turned in a praise report for his brother Dawn says he's in the hospital. He is doing better and they want to see all his numbers get back to normal before they release him. So continue for Don Peterson in prayer. There's also a praise report from Sister Nancy. She said my white blood cell count went down Monday. my blood and other numbers were normal or just below normal. Praise the Lord. He is an awesome God. So, just want to thank the Lord for being with Dawn and being with Sister Nancy and pray that he would just continue to be with them. Brother Ron, just let me know that the Chuas are in the Philippines. He'll be there till mid August. So, let's pray for brother Mario while he's there. Pray the Lord would use him in a special way. And sister Nancy also has a prayer request tonight. says, "Please pray for our daughter Sarah and her husband that they would find a house." So the Lord knows that need, pray the Lord just be with them. And if you have a need tonight, you just want to lift it before the Lord with Stephen if you would come. [Music] Let's all pray together. Father God, we have come here this evening for a purpose, Lord, because we have a desire in our hearts to learn more of you, Father. And we know that where there's a deep, there's a deep to respond. And so we're here, Lord, and we're asking, Father, that you would come and fulfill the desires of our heart, Father God. And that main desire is more of you, Lord. Father, touch the needy in heart. Touch the needy in mind, Father, in body. For we know that you are an ontime God. And that by your stripes, Lord, we are healed. We ask that you would come this evening, Father, by the foolishness of preaching, Lord, that you would change our lives, Father, like we so often say, Lord, may we leave this building different than what we came in, Lord. Father God, if there's anything within us that's evil or contrary, unlike you, Father, Lord, we ask that you would take it from us, Father, for we want to be like you, Lord. Bless brother James this evening. May you anoint him, inspire him of your spirit. Father God, relax his spirit, Lord, that he may yield the gift of God unto thee, Lord. We commit all things into thy hands. We thank you for the opportunity that you've given us again to be here. We love you. We thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Stephen. Amen. You may be seated tonight. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. We want to welcome each one. If you're here visiting tonight or you're streaming the service, we just want to welcome you. It's good to be set free. &gt;&gt; I was thinking of that song today. Thank God I am free. Free. Free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For a long time I traveled down a long lonely road. My heart was so heavy. In sin I sang low and I heard about Jesus. What a wonderful hour. I'm glad that I found out he could bring me out to his saving power. Thank God I am free. Free. Free from this world of sin. [Music] Been washed in the blood of Jesus. I've been born again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. Saved by his wonderful grace. [Music] I'm glad that I found out he could bring me out. Show me the way. Like a bird out of prison that's taken its flight. Like a blind man that got he gave back his sight. Like a poor wretched maker who's found fortune and fame. I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out through his holy name. Thank God I am free. Free. Free from this world of sin. [Music] Been washed in the blood of Jesus. I've been born again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. saved by his wonderful grace.

It's good to be set free tonight. Amen. Brother Ron just handed me a note to special unspoken prayer request for brother Bisco. So let's just go to the Lord in prayer. The Lord is with this need. Heavenly Father, we just come before you one more time, Lord. And &gt;&gt; we bring our brother Biscll before you, Lord. A soldier of the cross, Lord, &gt;&gt; been a influence in so many lives, Father, a testimony. And &gt;&gt; Lord, in these older years of his life, Father, he has a special need, Father. And we pray that you would just come on the scene, Lord, and &gt;&gt; meet that need in a special way. And &gt;&gt; be merciful, be gracious, Lord, we pray. And we just look forward to hearing of a good report. Father, &gt;&gt; we just lift him now before you and ask you to touch him in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him look upon his face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I journey through the land, singing as I go to Calvary to the crimson flow. Though many arrows hear my soul from without. But my Lord, he leads me on through him. I must win. And oh, I want to see him look upon his face and there to sing forever of his saving grace and on the streets of glory. Let me my voice will pass home at last ever to rejoice when service for my Lord darkly even night close to him. He will give me life. Satan snares vex my soul. Turn my thoughts aside. But my lord, he goes ahead. Leaves whatever he t. And oh I want to see him on his face and bear to sing forever of his saving grace. And on the streets of glory. Let me lift my voice.

With a tender hand I'll stretch toward the valley low. He's guiding me.

Oh cares all pass where home at last ever to rejoice. When before meows rise from the mighty deep, when my Lord directs my guard, he does safely keep. And he leads me gently on through this world below. Yes, he's a real friend to me.

[Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. And I'm I was a little late tonight and I didn't mention anything. I'm sorry. But I wanted to give this testimony because it's just so fresh from yesterday. And uh 3 weeks ago or so, the saints were asked to pray. They had diagnosed me with prostate cancer. And I had did a little homework. I just want to say first of all that Elizabeth had us go in for blood work here a while ago, which I'd have never done that. We've never been to the doctor for a physical exam. We just don't have unless we're I don't know, maybe if we're dead, we'd go see him, but it wouldn't seem dead either, would you? But anyhow, she wanted to have blood work done. And I realized that was really just God inspiring. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Inspiring her because from that blood work then we find out I have a PSA elevated. I still know anything's wrong 100%. You know, I'd never know. But uh so they wanted to do the biopsy. So that was 3 weeks ago, but then I had done a little homework and you find that that's a very slow growing cancer and and sometimes you'll never live long enough for it to affect you. And so that was kind of what I was expecting here a few weeks ago when they did the biopsy, but then no, it came back as they they rate them on a Gleon scale of 1 to 10 and and 10 being the highest and this was number nine as far as aggressive. And so then the next thing was they're worried spread, you know. So they just uh yesterday then I got the results from that scan. They did a whole body scan to see if the cancer had spread and and it has not. So that was a very happy day for me. [Applause] So that was what we were praying there 3 weeks ago that the cancer had not spread any further. And I believe God answered your prayers, the prayers of the saints. And I thank you for praying for me. God bless you richly. I love you each one. Praise the Lord. continue to hold brother Russell up in prayer and just believe for a total complete healing for the Russell. Amen. &gt;&gt; The potter's hands. &gt;&gt; Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior of my life placed in his hands tonight. Let him have his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; A beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior. I know for sure all of my days are held in your hands to your perfect. [Music] You gently call me into your presence. Guide me by your Holy Spirit. Teach me, Lord, to live all my life through your eyes. I'm grounded by your holy, holy, set me aart. I know you're crying me to yourself, [Music] Lord. I pray. So take me, hold me, use me, build me. I give my life to the father's hand. Guide me. [Music] Walk beside me. I give my life to you. Sing it again as brother James tonight [Music] beautiful [Music] all my days are held in your hand your perfect. You can lead me into your presence. Your Holy Spirit teach me Lord to live all my life through your eyes. I have to fight. You're holy. Set me aart. I know you're me. [Applause] Lord I pray so and I [Music] Take me home to me and guide me. [Music] Walk beside me. I give my life to [Music] How many truly that's your prayer this evening? &gt;&gt; That you would say, "Father, come and take me and mold me." And &gt;&gt; Father, take out things in my life that are not like you. And &gt;&gt; Lord, if you have to start all over, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; As long as you're in the potter's hands, it's a good place to be. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That you can be molded into a image that he sees fit to use. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why we've gathered here this evening. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; On a Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; To say, "Father, come and speak to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Minister unto me." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me be in the center of your will. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; That as you begin to work me and &gt;&gt; you begin to mold me, I can be just like you. &gt;&gt; Maybe you have a need tonight. And you want to make it known unto the Lord with an uplifted hand. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And say, "Father, I have a desire. I have a need in my life. And I need you to come on the scene. [Music] Father, we are a needy people this evening. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, we have needs. We have desires. [Music] &gt;&gt; Father, I have nothing to offer. [Music] &gt;&gt; But little is much when God is in it. Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. If you could take the fishes and loaves and &gt;&gt; feed the thousands, how much more &gt;&gt; Lord, in a day and an hour &gt;&gt; where the word has been revealed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When it's come into its fullness, oh God. And so we're asking, Lord, your people have needs. There's uplifted hands all over the building. [Music] &gt;&gt; Father, I don't know, but you do. &gt;&gt; And we're just asking by the foolishness of preaching that you would go and you would minister to hearts, that you would walk the aisles, that you would begin to discern spirits, and Lord, take out things that aren't like you, oh God. that you would mold us, oh God, and make us into the very image that you would see fit. Yeah. Father, I humble myself and I get myself out of the way, oh God. And Lord, I just ask that your people would pull upon the gift. And Lord, as the word would go forth, that it would fall into good ground, that we'd bring forth life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask that you would have your way in this service. Come have your way &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this evening. &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, thank you musicians. Let's turn to Genesis 24. We're going to go to Matthew 6. Sounds like my time is already up. Not yet. The word hasn't been read. &gt;&gt; Genesis 24 and verse one, very familiar portion of scripture of Eleaser getting a bride for Isaac. And verse one says, Abraham was old and well stricken in age, and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of the house that ruled over all that he had. I want us to take a moment right there. He had went and chose the oldest of servants. &gt;&gt; He didn't go and choose some young whippers snapper, the brand new servant, the servant that didn't know what to do, the one that hadn't been taught, but he went and chose a servant of maturity. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He went and chose a servant &gt;&gt; that he knew he could trust and he can depend. &gt;&gt; He chose a servant who knew the things that he liked and he didn't like. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's very good. &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, if he chose a servant he couldn't trust, how could he give him all things? &gt;&gt; Why would he entrust something unto some man that he couldn't trust everything, all that he had? &gt;&gt; Yes. And Abraham said unto this elder servant of the house that ruled o over all that he had, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell. But thou shalt go into a country, my country, and my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. And the servant said unto him, Pre-adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must I need to bring thy son again unto the land from whence thy came? And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou, that thou shalt not bring my son thither &gt;&gt; again. &gt;&gt; Don't bring my son thither. What is he asking him? There's no need for return ministry. There's no need that you go and have to come again. &gt;&gt; There's no need of that. But the Bible says here, the the servant asked pre-adventure that I don't find the woman. That's carnal understanding. That say the servant is asking, "What if I go out and I look and I can't find one that is willing to listen? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What if I I go out and I search the land and I can't find one that's willing to follow me back?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he's saying, &gt;&gt; "Whatever you do, do not bring my son again unto that land." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Listen why in verse 7. And the Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that's where unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give you this land, and he shall send his angel before thee, that shall take a wife unto my son. God is already making a provided way. &gt;&gt; He's already making a provided way before it's even done. Before he even sends his servant, he says, "Don't worry." That's why God down through all the ages and every generation, listen, he's there. There's no worry or fear of if God's going to have a people upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no worry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he sent his angel before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To make his prophets of every single age down all through time. He sent an angel before him to make him prosperous. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, listen again. Thou shalt be clear from this my oath. Only bring not my son thither again. And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swear to him concerning that matter. And the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master, and departed. for all the goods of his master &gt;&gt; were in his hand. &gt;&gt; You can be seated this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want to as I said in verse two and Abraham said to his eldest servant, it was just something that the Lord began to deal with my heart. And as I begin to look into this portion of scripture and I begin to try to just see the value of what lays here within the scripture because Abraham, as I said, didn't choose the youngest of servants. He didn't choose a man that was just uh wet behind the ears. He didn't know a whole lot. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he chose a servant who had been around a while, &gt;&gt; who had been under his teachings, who had been under him, and he's been able to tell him and show him all the ways of how he would like it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had to have such uh confidence in this man. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. Because if this man was to go out and the Bible says he was weary in age and he knew that he was coming to a place and there was a junction in time that he didn't have many days left here on earth and he knew that his heritage and his lineage would then live on through Isaac. &gt;&gt; And so he knew the the value that laid here. &gt;&gt; He knew the value of the woman that Isaac must have. &gt;&gt; Right? Why? Because the value laid within the seed &gt;&gt; of Isaac. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if you go and read the chapter before and Abraham goes and he offers Isaac as a sacrifice unto the Lord &gt;&gt; and he says, "Now I know &gt;&gt; that you love me." &gt;&gt; But then he the angel comes a second time and what did he say? He says, "Not only that now that I know that I love you or that you love me, but now your seed shall possess the gate of the enemy. Your seed shall be as the stars and as the sands of the sea." And this promise is going to come through the lineage of Isaac. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And so the value of the bride for Isaac &gt;&gt; was so immense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That if he put it in the the lap, let's say, of a servant who was immature, &gt;&gt; and he went after the best looking girl. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; He would go after the &gt;&gt; gifts. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Let's talk spiritually. because we know that we can bring it to this day that we know that this is an Old Testament type &gt;&gt; of Ezer going and getting a bride. &gt;&gt; And so God sent a messenger to this day to get a bride ready. &gt;&gt; And he had to have such confidence in this man or else this man would go after the next flashy thing. He would go after the biggest churches. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; He would go after the almighty dollar. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He would go after the best looking buildings and all whatever &gt;&gt; and all the signs and the wonders and everything and say that's what God is &gt;&gt; and he would mess miss the very virtue of the bride that he was supposed to get. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see God didn't choose Paul a first church age messenger to bring the entirety of the message. Right? &gt;&gt; He didn't choose Luther and Wesley to bring it into fullness. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He only gave those messengers apart. &gt;&gt; But there would come one that would be likened unto Elezer that he would begin to have the fullness &gt;&gt; of what the master had to offer. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Because if he gave the fullness to those first church age messengers, it would not only leave you and I out of the picture. Come on. &gt;&gt; Because time would have to continue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you see, there came a time and a place that God would have an interest in man that wouldn't be swayed by by certain things or by uh decisions that man would make. How many times did the prophet come in this day and people would offer him money and they would offer him cars and he would begin to walk away from those things. It shows you the very character of this &gt;&gt; Elezer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It shows you the character of that kind of man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, even this prophet, even though he was entrusted with all that the master had to offer, &gt;&gt; there was still a time that this, let's say, servant had to grow into that maturity. Eleazar wasn't always the eldest amongst the servants. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't one that always knew how the master liked it. &gt;&gt; But it came with time &gt;&gt; and with teaching &gt;&gt; and with mistakes &gt;&gt; and with failures. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's good. &gt;&gt; Are you saying brother Brandham had mistakes? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Because he was a man. He says I was just a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you see, when you begin to understand that as he the prophet's ministry, it's a progressive ministry, he would begin to understand that he would begin to grow. Brother Brandham didn't have all the answers in his early years of ministry. But what happened as his it begin to unfold? When did the prophet begin to his ministry begin to open? 1962 and 1963 when the seals began to happen, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What is it? The older days of his ministry, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When he began to get become the elder one amongst the message where it wasn't even a message then, but he began to come into that maturity. What happened? The third pool began to happen, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And things begin to open. But what happened with the people? They begin to walk away. Why? Because first and second pool, they love those wonders. They love those gifts that he had to offer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we can get into the story of Ezer that he be to give uh Rebecca the gifts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He be to give her things a fine jewelry and necklace and many people in churches would stop there. Pentecost would stop there. They would stop with the gifts. &gt;&gt; But that's not the value. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not where the value lies. Is there value in it? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But that's not all the value. &gt;&gt; And so this evening, we're going to talk a little bit about true value. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True value. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With the subject of the valuation of the word. &gt;&gt; The valuation of the word. In Matthew 6 and 19, it says, "Lay not up your treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, &gt;&gt; and where thieves break through and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. &gt;&gt; Where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you've ever had anybody steal something from you, &gt;&gt; it is not a pleasant experience. Right. &gt;&gt; When somebody steals something from you, I've had somebody steal break into my shr and they stole a bunch of stuff. You feel violated. You feel exposed. You feel, "How could I let this happen? What happened? How did it happen? Who's following me?" &gt;&gt; Who's watching me? Now you become paranoid. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah. But let me tell you, the Bible says, "For where your treasures is, there your heart will be also." &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; What happens when rust and moth begins to corrupt an object? We don't have it much out here, but back east, if you if you have a car and you drive it down the road during the winter months and you begin to drive it and the salt gets all over it, what happens? &gt;&gt; Begins to rust. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What happens when rust and corrosion begins to happen? &gt;&gt; It loses its value. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It loses its value. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this. Rust doesn't happen overnight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Rust doesn't happen overnight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, my treasures are this." And you begin to uh wonder what what happened. How did I get so far down the road? In your spiritual life, things begin to happen and you put your treasures and in materialistic things and things here on earth and you begin to value things and they get out of priority, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And things begin to fall apart. That's what happens when rust and corrosion begins to happen. &gt;&gt; Things begin to fall apart. &gt;&gt; And you wonder what happened? How did it happen? Rust doesn't happen overnight, &gt;&gt; right? Backsliding doesn't happen overnight. &gt;&gt; Falling back doesn't happen overnight. It's a progression. It's something that happens that if you're not continually growing, you're not continually maturing in the word, if you're not continue unfolding as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For where your treasures is, there your heart will be also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let me say it like this. The treasures that you value show the condition of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; The treasures that you value &gt;&gt; shows the condition of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It shows me where you're at as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; If you show me and you tell me you don't value things that that should be a priority, &gt;&gt; if you don't value your family, if you don't value your kids or your relationship, &gt;&gt; right? If you don't value coming to church or or or trying to make an effort, &gt;&gt; if you don't value those things, you can tell me all you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can put a front on all you want. &gt;&gt; But it shows the condition of the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was was talking to the young people and he says he says now boys and girls, but I think it's applicable to all of us. He says, "You know what?" He says, "There's a lot of things in the world that's real valuable. And one of those things is you have it with you today. It's the soul that's inside that body." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the most valuable thing in the world &gt;&gt; to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the most valuable thing in the world to you. &gt;&gt; Is that right, mother? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I get a father to say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The most valuable thing that you've got in your soul is your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't get anything else from this service, &gt;&gt; remember this that your soul is the most valuable thing. And the value that you put on your soul, &gt;&gt; that is the most valuable thing. &gt;&gt; So, let me ask you, what happens when we begin as fathers and mothers, we begin to devalue our souls. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I love my little child. I I I cherish him. I care for his soul naturally." Yes, there's a value in that. But I want to talk about the true value. &gt;&gt; That if you begin to devalue it and you lose the value of that, if mama and daddy aren't valuing the kids' souls, &gt;&gt; what are the children going to value? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. That's right. &gt;&gt; What are the children going to value? &gt;&gt; You can say you love your child, &gt;&gt; but yet if you keep them from church and you don't show the priorities of living a good Christian life and how to act and how to respond to a mother and how to handle certain situations. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You see the such value of it &gt;&gt; and the simplicity of it. &gt;&gt; True. The most valuable thing that you've got is your soul. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful statement. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, let me ask you this evening, where is your treasures this evening? &gt;&gt; Is it in monetary value? Is it in things that are of corruptible things? Because as mortals, we begin to put value on things here on earth. And we could all value things differently. We can value experiences. We can value, you know, some like objects, some like cars, some like, you know, going on vacation. Some value things differently. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong in in a value of those things. &gt;&gt; But whenever they become unbalanced, &gt;&gt; when there becomes an imbalance of those things, that's where the corruption comes. &gt;&gt; That's where the abomination comes. There are things as mortals as I said that we place value on things that we think that is going to bring fulfillment in our life. You've ever done that? You ever think that if I can achieve this goal, it is the greatest thing ever. &gt;&gt; And if only I can attain that, I'll I'll be set. If I can only get so much in my bank account, I won't have to worry again. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Listen. I put things in this world, even as a young man. You go through high school and you play the sports and you have one goal and that's to win a state championship and you have such value. And as I look back and the reason it comes to my memory is cuz I just moved and you're going through the drawers and you find something, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Something that you used to value so much. &gt;&gt; Yeah. something that you were it was a goal that you wish you could attain and you only have four years to accomplish it &gt;&gt; and it seemed in my small town that you would attain it and you attain it we always got runner up &gt;&gt; and every single time you know what people would say there's always next year &gt;&gt; there's always next year &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; there's always next year &gt;&gt; there's always next year listen and that's what happens to some Christians there's always next they begin to God begins to deal with their heart and he wants to put some value on things and you do it and then you put you know what there's always next year &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; and you begin to put things off and I got tired of hearing it until finally it came my final year and we accomplished it &gt;&gt; and there was such a value and I and I put it in if if I look back did it did I overvalue and was it an imbalance at that time absolutely &gt;&gt; yeah Absolutely. Because I work so hard for it. &gt;&gt; Something of value &gt;&gt; is worth working for. &gt;&gt; Something worth value is worth earning. If you were given everything, it's not of value. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If God gave you everything and he just dumped out all his blessings, what would it be? You'd just be a spoiled child. &gt;&gt; There would be no value. You wouldn't know the value of life. If everything was always green, you wouldn't know the very value. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you that brother Russell looks at life a little bit different. &gt;&gt; Because when you begin to have value in life and Satan comes or we wouldn't even say Satan, but a trial comes and temptations come and things happen in your life, you begin to value it a little bit different. &gt;&gt; You begin to look at it a little bit different. &gt;&gt; That's good. Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; You want to find the real character of a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You say, "Well, you you can find a character of a man when he doesn't got money." &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, you can find a real character of man when he has money. &gt;&gt; Because when he doesn't got money, what does he got to do? He's got to depend on God. And he's got to call on God or he's got to ask for help. And he's got all these things. But you give a man money, watch his character. &gt;&gt; See if things change. If you tell me that your life's changed, if you see, if you tell me, "Oh, I'm all better now." Maybe you've done, maybe you've changed, but give that man back some money and see what happens. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See if his priorities have changed. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; The truth. &gt;&gt; You see, I was watching even this this thing popped up and it was the number one. A man came to a number one in his in his group and the thing that he was trying number one in the world and he said everything that I worked for everything that I wanted to achieve everything that it's something that you have a desire and as mortals and there's nothing wrong with wanting to achieve things in life because we read we read in the very beginning that Abraham was blessed in all things. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you you can be blessed in all things. Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. True. &gt;&gt; God wants to bless you in all things. &gt;&gt; He wants to bless you in your health. He wants to bless you in every way that you want. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wants to bless you more than you want to be blessed. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And he was blessed in all things. But this man, he would he he he attained the highest level that he ever wanted to achieve. And you know what the question he asked himself? What is the point? What is the purpose? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That you strive your whole life for that you want to achieve and you want to attain something so badly that you work your life for and you you give up and you sacrifice so much and he says I wanted to achieve it so badly and when I got there he asked himself what is the point? &gt;&gt; What is the purpose? &gt;&gt; Yeah &gt;&gt; good. He said just for a moment &gt;&gt; that you receive this satisfaction &gt;&gt; that you receive this little bit of glory because let me tell you if somebody's wins the World Series next year there's another World Series next year or this year and then there's one next year &gt;&gt; and one after that and one after that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you're attaining something. &gt;&gt; And he says, "What is the value in that?" If we take it to our Bibles, the scripture says, "If we attain the whole world &gt;&gt; and lose our souls, &gt;&gt; what good is it?" &gt;&gt; If we live our whole life and we attain all these things of value that we place value on and we lose our souls or we lose our family or we lose our relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Come on. Help me somebody. Come on. &gt;&gt; If we lose those things of value, &gt;&gt; what is the point? &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And when I was thinking of the dep of value, now this is my definition. The value of something is only the importance you put in it &gt;&gt; or put on it. &gt;&gt; And I believe that there is true value to everything and something we can attain from everything in life. &gt;&gt; You say what do you mean by that? That in the bad times we can find value in it. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the good times? Absolutely. There's value in everything. It's all in how you look at it. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. True. &gt;&gt; You see, to get to the value of something, there must be a standard that you measure it up to. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Something of value, there must be a way to measure that. And as I begin to just read through the Bible and the the Bible talks about weights and balances and if you could bring the picture up so we have a visual if they have it because when we look at these things of weights and measures maybe they don't have it. It's okay. But you begin to see that throughout scripture. I didn't put this together. I just found it. But you begin to see that weights and measures are weighed differently in scripture. That all down through the Old Testament and the New Testament, you can see that if you were a man, it's not like today that you know it's so easy that you go to the grocery store and you you trade something off or you just spend a dollar. Now, there's certain places in the world that yeah, you will have to trade a chicken for something. &gt;&gt; Right. But here in the US, you just trade the dollar. That's the standard &gt;&gt; in which we live by. But in the Old Testament, in order to do any business, if you wanted to trade some dry weight of wheat or whatever it was, and you wanted to trade it for some water, 10 bass equal one homer of of wheat there. And so there was certain measurements and weights. And if you begin to do business and you would see that uh 1/2 cubit is 9 in long. It's from this fingertip to this fingertip. And a cubit is from this fingertip to the tip of your elbow. So now can you imagine going around and that's how you did measurements. I shouldn't want to do business with brother David over here. I'd get the short end, but all down through and I love it because it came and I found this and it says the standard tends to vary slightly over time. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And the following are approximations based on what we know from archeological findings. says, "Oftent times merchants carried multiple sets of weights to use depending on whether they were buying or selling &gt;&gt; in order to teach the people they were dealing with. &gt;&gt; Look at that." &gt;&gt; They carried multiple weights and measures. &gt;&gt; Let me read that again. Often times, Christians would carry different sets of clothing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They would carry different things to whatever way they wanted to lean. They're trying to cheat the system. They're trying to get by. They're trying to wade in the balance over here. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You can't cheat God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can't cheat God. God will find you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no need to carry different weights and measures and standard. There's only one standard and that is his word. &gt;&gt; And when you begin to understand and go by his word, you can never fail. This is a perfect, just, and balanced word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Proverbs 11:1 says, "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord." &gt;&gt; Man, that is a strong word. &gt;&gt; That is a very strong word. Abomination. It's not just that he dislikes it or disapproves it or he's not okay with it. No, it's an abomination. &gt;&gt; Look at that. &gt;&gt; An abomination is a thing that disgusts or brings hatred. It is hateful. It is sinful. It is wicked. It is vile. &gt;&gt; I don't want no part to do with any of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But a just way &gt;&gt; is his delight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:22 says, "All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the Lord weighth the spirit. &gt;&gt; You see, God sometimes he weighs the spirit. Let me give you a word of advice. Sometimes you need to weigh the spirit. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you you you need to use some discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you're walking around and you're just going about and you're you begin to look at things and every man is right in his own eyes, &gt;&gt; but if you're not careful and you don't weigh the spirit. &gt;&gt; True. Some men look good on the outside. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Some things can be said in a way. And I looked at this word weth and the word weth means to con means to balance the measure or assess. In this context, the definition says it signifies that God careful and just evaluates the spirit's motives &gt;&gt; behind the action. You know there are sometimes that there are motives behind people's action. &gt;&gt; And if you don't spiritually discern things that are happening amongst you &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:11, "A just weight and a balance are the Lord's, and all the weights of the bag are his work." All the weights of the bag &gt;&gt; are his word. And so in today's society here in America, everything is valued by the dollar. The dollar is the standard. You can go to the store, you can buy something, either pull out the credit card or you throw them cash. Cash isn't even a thing now. Most people don't even take cash. &gt;&gt; A cashless society. &gt;&gt; They're trying to get you to spend things on credit and money that you don't even have. That's right. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; You go to the store and you buy things by the dollar. Now, we're talking about value here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because when you travel the world, you begin to realize that this dollar value begins to change. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; That it begins to change one way or the other. If you go to Mexico, it's 18 to1. 18 pesos to $1. If you go to Canada, it's $136 to1. Australia, $153 to1. If you want to feel real good about your money, you can go to Vonatu for $119 for one, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know it comes to me saying that because many people find let me say this like Mexicans they find and I deal with guys and that's their mentality that instead end up dealing with it hard and they come over here and what they do they make money and send it back &gt;&gt; and they retire in Mexico. &gt;&gt; Let me say there's no way for us as Christians. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; That's not our inheritance. That's not our plan. That's not our saving to go and to retire in a cheap place. No, &gt;&gt; our place is heaven. &gt;&gt; Our treasures are not here. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; But as you begin to see this value dollar begins to change. &gt;&gt; Yes. This news article flashed and I seen it that a $100,000 salary in January of 2020 has the same buying power as 124,000 in April of 2025. Meaning that that 25% drop in value to your dollar buys less today than it did just 5 years ago. From groceries to gas, housing to health care, inflation is quietly chipped away at the middle class incomes. Even earning six figures are feeling the squeeze in today's economy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; true. &gt;&gt; This statistic is a wakeup call. Listen to this. This statistic is a wakeup call. If your income hasn't risen with the inflation, you're effectively earning less than you were in 2020. &gt;&gt; Yeah. the same dollar, but now it's losing value. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have the same buying power. And as I begin to think on this buying power that if you're spiritual, natural types of spiritual, and if you're naturally losing the value on that, what about your spiritual life? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What about your spiritual buying power today? If your walk with Jesus Christ is the same as it was 5 years ago, &gt;&gt; if your joy that you had just last year, if your understanding and revelation is the same as last year, your buying power isn't enough for today. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the closer we get, the tighter the squeeze, the closer we get to this end time, the tighter that squeeze is going to be. The pressure is going to be harder. The trials are going to be harder. The temptation's going to be harder. So if your faith isn't growing to match today, &gt;&gt; your buying power isn't enough. &gt;&gt; So let me tell you, it's time to get more buying power. It's time to increase your understanding. It's time to increase your revelation of God's word. It's time to put more time into God's word &gt;&gt; and put value in things that God sees value in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful. So true. &gt;&gt; If your love hasn't increased, something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If your worship hasn't increased, something's wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you saints, God inhabits the praises of his people. We don't just come to church and just sit on a pew and fulfill a duty of sitting here, but we come and bring our worship and our admiration unto him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If our commitment to Christ &gt;&gt; hasn't increased, &gt;&gt; the buying power isn't enough. Right. &gt;&gt; The buying power. What is that buying power? It's the power that's going to take you home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's that Holy Ghost in power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, God doesn't devalue. &gt;&gt; He doesn't. &gt;&gt; God hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; But it's our value that we place on the things of God. Those are the things that Satan, what he does, if we can do it in this way, that Satan in his inflation, he begins to cause things to rise up. He begins to cause trials to come our way. He becomes he he inflates temptation in our lives and it begins to deviate our value &gt;&gt; from the importance. &gt;&gt; You see when the squeeze begins to happen, &gt;&gt; it's not if, but when. &gt;&gt; And if any of you aren't feeling the squeeze, &gt;&gt; that squeeze is coming on so strong. You better thank God for the freedom that we have tonight. You better thank God for the opportunities and not take it lightly because the squeeze is going to get tighter and it's going to get tighter and it's going to get harder and it's going to get harder. Why? Because just as Satan is increasing, so is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When that squeeze begins to come from all sides, what happens? Look up. Your redemption drawth nigh. There's only one way to go. When there's nowhere else to go, it's going to be up. And that is the buying power that's going to get you out of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I've realized, depending on the stage that you're in, the stage of life that you are is where the value begins to shift. And there's nothing wrong in that. That whenever you're at a place that you understand, if we can put it simple, that kids, they do not have to worry right now at the stage that they're in of what career they're going to choose, what path they're going to take. No, they're just kids. One day my kid wants to be a firefighter, the next day he wants to be a cowboy. Nobody can tell me he can't be an Indian. You know, there's things that as kids, there's no value in what they want to be. &gt;&gt; But you see the value, it begins to change. Teenagers, they don't think of what what what their 401 is going to produce at the end of their life. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's out of balance. &gt;&gt; I don't expect you to do that. &gt;&gt; Because it's in balance. But we want to have a balance in the stage that you're living in &gt;&gt; that as you walk with Christ and you begin to adjust. I don't expect you to have a revelation of somebody else and oh, you know, grow at a certain rate. No, no, no. You grow as God sees fit. You grow as the revelation comes to you. You unfold as God begins to show himself to you. &gt;&gt; And the values begin to change. &gt;&gt; Yes, they do. &gt;&gt; But there comes a time of maturity and growth. Paul says, "When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child, I put value on things as a child." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I put value on certain things that there wasn't much value on. &gt;&gt; But that's okay. But when you become a man, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when I become a man, I put away those childish things. &gt;&gt; I put away those childish things. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I think it's time for some to grow up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time to grow up. It's time to come into a place, a position, and placing as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't stay a child forever. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't stay a child forever. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; If you're not growing and maturing and learning, &gt;&gt; there's something wrong. Yes. &gt;&gt; The actual definition of value is the regards of something is held to deserve the important worth or usefulness of something. A person's principle or standard of behavior, one's judgment of what is important in life, values. And when you begin to change your values, &gt;&gt; when you begin to change your values of because of the people that you hang around, something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; And can I give you a warning that it's not just changing your values for people out in the world? That's that's easy to notice. &gt;&gt; That when you begin to adjust, but let me tell you, there's going to be ones that call themselves message that you're going to have to hold your values. You're going to have to hold your standards. You're going to have to be an example. Why? You might not fit feel like you fit in. Why? Because you say, "Well, well, this church does it or this church allows it." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Values. And you begin to lower the values and the standards. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; You see, there's nothing wrong in putting values in those things. In fact, it's a must to have values in certain things. If you put a value in education, there's nothing wrong. We should all learn to read and write. &gt;&gt; But there is a true value in it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That whenever you begin to take it too far &gt;&gt; or you become imbalanced with it. It's the same with a career. There's nothing wrong in providing for your family. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong in that. But when it becomes imbalanced, &gt;&gt; it takes away the value of it. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; The value of kids. I think this is a big one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says that kids and children are the inheritance of the Lord. &gt;&gt; They're things that they're ones that God has given us to look over, to oversee. Yes. &gt;&gt; To be able to show them the values of life. &gt;&gt; To be able to show and to tell your young ladies how to be a lady. To be able to tell your young men how to be grown men. &gt;&gt; How to have respect for elders. How to open the door. &gt;&gt; But in a society, we begin to lose the simplicity of life. &gt;&gt; We begin to lose those things of what we think is just such that's not that big of a deal, right? Fathers, you need to teach your daughters the value that lays within them. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't tell them the value that they have, the worth that they have, &gt;&gt; somebody else will. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Some other man is going to tell you how valuable they are. &gt;&gt; Or you can play the other side that Satan's going to come in and he's going to begin to tell them and devalue who they are. He's going to use things as you don't fit in, you don't look pretty enough, you need to add a little bit of this, you need to do these things. What is he doing? He's devaluing the worth, &gt;&gt; the true value of what lays inside of you. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; There's value in these simple things. &gt;&gt; Amen. True value is when you lead by example. &gt;&gt; True value. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is when you lead by example. &gt;&gt; You don't tell them, show them. &gt;&gt; True, brother. &gt;&gt; Don't tell them, show them how to do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Show them how to be a gentleman. &gt;&gt; Show them how to be a lady. Because if we lose the simplicity of the gospel, if we lose the simple things in life, what happens to this message? &gt;&gt; If we lose the value of God's word and the standard he's given us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What happens to it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Good. &gt;&gt; You see, Satan wants to devalue. &gt;&gt; Satan wants to devalue and tear down He wants to tell you what you're not and what you can't do and who you're not and that you don't fit in and you're not in this message and you make a mistake and you fall down. Let me tell you, if you fall down, it doesn't devalue who you are. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take away of you being a son or daughter of God. Just get back up and keep walking. &gt;&gt; Because we've all made mistakes. We've all fallen down. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We've all had hard times. We've all lost value in certain things. &gt;&gt; True. But just get back to the value of what God said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The power of transformation. Our redemption wasn't cheap. Wasn't a cheap thing. It was the son of God had to die for us. See? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It isn't. Things of value come at a great price. &gt;&gt; To bring this message, it wasn't easy. See, no, it isn't. I had to forsake everything that was dear to me, even my own people, everybody. But you see the value of it is you see is to do the will of God. &gt;&gt; You have to come to a place that that's where your value lies. It doesn't matter if your mom or your dad doesn't come. It doesn't matter what value they place on things. What are you valuing right now? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our redemption wasn't cheap. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The price that had to be paid all down through the ages. It wasn't cheap. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you, what true value do you place on the message &gt;&gt; as an individual? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What value do you place on this message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Because there's a true value that you must find within this message. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you can put a value on the Bible. Sure. There is value in this, &gt;&gt; but there's a true value. &gt;&gt; There's a value on a God-s prophet. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; There's value in the messages and in the tapes that he has. &gt;&gt; But let me ask you, what value is it if you don't read it? &gt;&gt; What value does this have? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. If you don't pick it up &gt;&gt; and you begin to partake of it, what value does it bring you? Nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you said, "Brother James, I want to diet. I want to go on a diet. Do you have a book that you could give me?" Yeah, sure. And I give you a book and you look at it and you say, "Okay, day one, you got to do this and this. Day two, you got to run a mile. &gt;&gt; Day three, you got to do this. You got to eat healthier. You got to do this. But if this just sits on your &gt;&gt; table and you say, "Well, I want to go on a diet. I want to lose weight." &gt;&gt; Well, the answer is right there. &gt;&gt; But if you never pick it up and go through it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. Come on. &gt;&gt; If you never partake of it, if you never put it into action, &gt;&gt; if you never get into it, it does no value. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. So what happens you begin to want to do it a different way because many times as us humans we want to go the easy route. So if you want to lose weight and you want to do all this and you do it and I'm not against it but people it just came as people want to go the way of Ozimpic and you you can take a shot and lose weight. You laugh, but it's true. &gt;&gt; And what happens? They don't change the way they eat. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They don't change the way they live, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And what happens now? &gt;&gt; Doesn't do anything. &gt;&gt; Oh, for a time it works. &gt;&gt; Oh, it works. And you'll start losing weight. &gt;&gt; But what happens when you stop taking it? You put the weight back on. &gt;&gt; Right? And many times Christians want an oimpic religion. &gt;&gt; That they don't want to change their diet. &gt;&gt; They don't want to change the way that they're living. They don't want to do the the hard way. They don't want to begin to work out and put in the work and put in the time, put in the effort, begin to eat the diet of the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They want the easy way. So, give me an oyic experience. Yeah, &gt;&gt; give me an Oimpic religion that I could just take a shot and keep living and eating the way I am. &gt;&gt; That I can eat my dessert. I could do all those things, still live the same way. I say, God, help us. &gt;&gt; I say, God, help us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To find the true value of it. Because whenever you begin to uh put value in this, yes, there's value in the Bible, but that's not all of it. There's value in those tapes. Absolutely. But there's a true value that you will find when you get into that. When you begin to partake of it, when you say, "Be it unto me." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The true value lies not when you believe it, but it's when you apply it to your life. Yes. &gt;&gt; The true value lies in the application of it. &gt;&gt; The true value isn't knowing what he said, but it's applying what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just knowing it. Let me tell you, Satan knows this message. &gt;&gt; Satan knows the Bible. Satan comes to church. Satan sits on the pew. He's faithful. &gt;&gt; But it's applying it to your life &gt;&gt; is what makes the difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see this message is going to become such a value. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would explain it in such a way that this is love, God's love letter given to man. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think back on World War I whenever they would go off to war, what would they do? There was no forms of being able to ha have a communication back and forth but to write a letter. So there in a time of war, men would sit down or they would take a a love letter that was given to them by their wife and they would begin to read it and sit down and they could read it over and over. Why? Because it was the only thing that they had of her. There was only thing that that would bring her back was this love letter. And God has sent his love letter down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just to you &gt;&gt; that you might cherish it, that you might look upon it and read it and begin to take the promises of this book and apply it to your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, I I wrote you a He says, "If I wrote you a letter, I believe that we are friends enough that you would appreciate it and you would wrote you would wrote me back. I would appreciate it. He says, "But if your letter was just addressed to me after I read it, it would not be so valuable or would be not valuable to anyone else. It would be a letter that was directed to me or my letter directed to you and after it was once read, it could be discarded unless you just keep it as a relic." &gt;&gt; I think many times within the message, people have too many things that are relics. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They put too much value on. &gt;&gt; I'll leave that one. &gt;&gt; But oh, it's not so with the word of God &gt;&gt; because it was not addressed to any certain individual. It was addressed to all Adam's race, all Adam's fallen race, to every mortal being. That's why it's so valuable. Just one word, you can hang on to it with all that's in you and know that it is true. God said all scripture must be fulfilled. And he says heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail. &gt;&gt; My word will never fail. The value of one word from almighty God. Why do you come to church? Why do you come on Sundays and Wednesday to hear his word? Because one word might make a difference. One thing that is said might help you along the way. One prayer, one song that's &gt;&gt; sang. True. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the English dictionary, we say it, we say thousands of words every single day and there's no value really in it. But when it comes to God's word and the way it's placed, you can take every promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And apply it to your life. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Sometimes it means a lot. Sometimes it cost you something. And anything that anything that doesn't cost you something isn't worth having." Right? &gt;&gt; All great things has to be paid for. &gt;&gt; And this religion that we have and this Pentecostal Holy Spirit that has set us bring back the resurrected Jesus Christ alive after 1900 years is worth all our time, &gt;&gt; all our effort. Everything that we do, it's worth all to us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Last one. And he says in this portion of scripture he says I have it under consideration for the text. He says just five little words. He says what makes but what makes what it what it is is it's the scripture. The valuation of the word the word is so valuable. No matter if it's one little word it's valuable. It's the valuable word. The word was in the beginning a thought of God and then it began after a thought. A thought is a word is a thought expressed. &gt;&gt; And when God thinks of anything, &gt;&gt; then when he expresses his thought, it becomes a signed document. &gt;&gt; And everything that God is worth and everything that God is is behind that word. &gt;&gt; Everything that God is worth and everything that he is. That's why Abraham could send Eleazar with everything that he had. Why? Because he had a signed document that was paid. He had a decree that was going out to go find me a bribe. Bring him back for my do my son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he entrusted him with everything. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He says no man is any better than his word. All the Bible is is the prophets who went who has went up into a place where we spoke today as eagles. For in the beginning, God knew everything that would ever be &gt;&gt; from the very first beginning. You see the value of the word. &gt;&gt; You see, that's the power of God's word. &gt;&gt; That's the power of prayer. &gt;&gt; That's the power of things that God has given us. is not just something that we we say a prayer and it goes up. But brother Brandham says that prayer goes up and it goes and finds a resting place. &gt;&gt; He would begin to tell us through a story of the man that stole that brother's car. And they would be driving down the road and he came up to brother Brandham. He says, "I left my keys in this and my car is stolen. Will you say a prayer?" Brother Brandham says he says the prayer and it goes up and he begins to wander around and he goes into that vision. He finds it down the road. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "What did it do? The very word that he spoke." Listen, there's power in the words that you speak. And when the word goes up, it begins to go and find. And it begins to search and it finds the bedding ground in which it's meant to fulfill. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When your needs come become before the people, it's not just writing it on a piece of paper, &gt;&gt; but when it's presented and it begins to go and somebody comes and prays, what happens? That prayer goes up and it goes and finds that individual. Listen, when we begin to pray for brother Russell, what happens? Angels begin to go and find them and begin to minister unto him healing and virtue. Why? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's power in God's word. &gt;&gt; There's power in prayer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what makes the difference. &gt;&gt; That's what makes the difference. &gt;&gt; If God would tell us that, the prophet would tell us five minutes in the presence of almighty God can make the difference. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If it did it with Moses, it can do it with each one of us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true, brother. Five minutes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Five minutes in his presence. &gt;&gt; I want you to think of that. &gt;&gt; Five minutes of time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You might be going through the hardest thing right now. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You might be going through something that might be unbearable. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why do I come to church?" Because five minutes will do. &gt;&gt; Just five minutes. That's right. &gt;&gt; I say God, help us give them that five minutes. If it takes a minute, if it takes a half minute, &gt;&gt; if it takes one word, &gt;&gt; let it go forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, my treasure don't only lie in a place where I'm going, but my treasure lies in the word that he's given us for this day. &gt;&gt; That's where my treasure lies. &gt;&gt; Because I believe that we can have spiritual treasure here on earth. I believe that we can have spiritual blessings here on earth. &gt;&gt; I believe that God can pour some things out and give us a overflowing of blessings &gt;&gt; here on earth. We don't have to wait to heaven to get be able to walk on streets of gold to be able to tell of how great God is. No, I'm not going to wait until I get to that over there. Yes, it's going to be a wonderful time and that's where my treasure is and that's where my home is. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, there's treasures here on earth that we can partake of. There's things that we can have here on earth. Let me tell you, it's an untapped resource. &gt;&gt; That we are living below our privileges. Help us Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From where your treasure is, there your heart will be. Also, &gt;&gt; first Peter one says, "Bless, blessed be the God of our fathers and our Lord Jesus Christ, which is according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope." &gt;&gt; That's a lively hope, saints. &gt;&gt; It's a lively hope. It's a living hope. How do I know it's alive? Because there's testimonies because you and I are testimonies that it's a lively hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you &gt;&gt; who are kept by the power of God. &gt;&gt; Who are kept by the power of God. It's not you keeping yourself. You can't keep yourself. Let me tell you, if you try to keep yourself, you're going to fall. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you are kept by the power of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last day, &gt;&gt; last time, &gt;&gt; wherein we greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaven in heaviness through manifold temptations. Does anybody know what manifold temptation is? I had to look it up. &gt;&gt; Manifold temptation, it implies that the temptations come in many forms and not &gt;&gt; uniform. &gt;&gt; They can be physical, emotional, and spiritual in nature. &gt;&gt; So what are you telling me? It's life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. None of us are exempt from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; None of us are exempt from it, saints. &gt;&gt; Manifold temptations, they come and it's just life. So if you come under the heaviness of that, let me tell you it says greatly rejoice &gt;&gt; that the trial of your faith being more precious than gold that perish though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and gloring at the peering of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believe. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you rejoice with joy unspeakable &gt;&gt; and full of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you rejoice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That you rejoice, saints. &gt;&gt; It's not a time of heaviness and weary. Though we are in dark times, though we are in time of heaviness, but you must rejoice. &gt;&gt; Be of good cheer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's it. &gt;&gt; Jesus told Thomas, "Blessed is he who has not seen. &gt;&gt; You have seen." &gt;&gt; Amen. But blessed is he who has not seen &gt;&gt; and still believes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Musicians come. &gt;&gt; You see, Eleazar in the beginning went to get a bride for Isaac and he came to a place to a well that he prayed. And he prayed a prayer and he says that this woman would speak and say, "I will not only give you water &gt;&gt; but your camels also." &gt;&gt; You see, there's something for us to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can place value on the messenger. &gt;&gt; And as time would go on, he found Rebecca there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they would begin to commune back and forth &gt;&gt; and he would give her gifts &gt;&gt; of earrings and jewelry and he would ask her, "Is there a place for me in your inn or in your house in your father's house?" Now, if you put yourself in the reality of it that a stranger comes to one of you sisters and says, "Here's some jewelry. Do you have place for me to lodge in my camels?" It's kind of unsettling. It's one of those things that what would I do in that situation? But he says, "Is there a place?" and she says there is room. And as he would go on and they would begin to talk with the family, they would ask the family if he could have her. And he says, "You would have to ask the woman." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Go ask her. Go ask the damsel. See what comes out of her mouth. &gt;&gt; She willing. Yes sir. Come on. &gt;&gt; What did she say? &gt;&gt; I will go. &gt;&gt; I will go. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I will go. You see her family wanted her to terry there for a while. He said give us 10 days. Give us a few days that we can spend some time. But you see when the time is at hand. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's no stopping it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Each one of us has to make the same commitment and say I will go. &gt;&gt; I will forsake father. I'll forsake mother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And say I will go. [Music] And we know the story [Music] that as she would come into Isaac, and I think it's so amazing because the Bible says that Isaac when he seen her a far off, he would go and he would get her and she would veil herself and hop off the camel. [Music] But let me tell you, she had value placed on the gifts that he gave her. &gt;&gt; Value on the message. &gt;&gt; Sir. Yes. &gt;&gt; On the messenger. Let me say that. &gt;&gt; But as they were going to meet Isaac. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She would ask Eleazar, "Tell me what he likes." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is Isaac really like? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we had a prophet come in this day and he would begin to preach sermons of choosing a bride, things that are to be. He would begin to tell us of things that are going to happen, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The restoration of the bride tree. &gt;&gt; What is it? Sermons that are telling us, &gt;&gt; showing us his love language, &gt;&gt; ministering unto us. It's a love letter that he's given us. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's value in it. There's value in the gifts. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when they got to Isaac, they left all that behind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't place as much value on that. Why? When we get to heaven, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; All the Bibles will be stacked. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; They'll be all stacked up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You won't need the love letter &gt;&gt; when you have the lover. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; One that you've been waiting &gt;&gt; your whole life for. &gt;&gt; One you've been waiting to sit in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; What will it be like &gt;&gt; to sit in the presence of Almighty God? Oh my. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You won't be disappointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything of life that you've been through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; The true value lies in the message that he brought. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the message gets you to the person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't get things out of balance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I love the prophet. There's so much value in what he said. There's value in those tapes. You better get into those tapes. &gt;&gt; You better listen to what he said. You better get into the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's value in it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you got to fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; You got to apply it to your life. &gt;&gt; When everything is said and done and you get into the presence of almighty God, &gt;&gt; it'll all be worth it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet would tell us, "Don't miss it." Yes, &gt;&gt; sir, brother. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't miss it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do to got that you got to do to put value &gt;&gt; and align yourself and bring your life back into balance. Isaiah do it. &gt;&gt; It's not too late. [Music] You see, if I was to place a value on an instrument, this guitar, that could guitar could have been ordained to go and play some country song. It could been out in some concert. It can be in the hands of some popular star. [Music] The value doesn't lie in the guitar. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Until it's played. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Has monetary value in that guitar. &gt;&gt; That's right. But if it's never played, but it was brought into this church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [Music] &gt;&gt; And when it's played by a son of God, &gt;&gt; when it's played by a master that knows how to pick it &gt;&gt; and bring it to its full potential. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants to do with each one of you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Be a clay in the potter's hands. &gt;&gt; Be one that can be molded and used for the master. &gt;&gt; Let your life play music that is pleasing unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. true value. &gt;&gt; Let's stand today. Let's just pray. [Music] Father, Lord, we humble ourselves in your presence. &gt;&gt; Lord, I know when you come by and I can feel your presence, oh God, &gt;&gt; I know when you begin to minister to hearts and we go in certain directions and but we know that there's a purpose and a reason, oh God. [Music] Father, how we just want to be used in your hands. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Father, you've placed us here on earth for a purpose. And there's value in each one of your children's that are here tonight. They may think that they don't have much value or there's not they don't have much worth, but oh God, I ask that you would go unto them and you would minister unto them, oh God, and show them the value and the price that you had to pay and that redemption, it didn't come cheap, but there was a sacrifice that you had to send your only begotten son to come and die on a cross for each one of us, oh God, that we might be able to have the shed blood of Jesus Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, how blessed we are that you've sent a prophet in this day. Lord, I'm so thankful that you've sent El Ezer my way. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord, I didn't find you. You found me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we could have done. It's not of works unless a man should boast. How humble it makes us feel, oh God, that you've chosen us &gt;&gt; as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Lord, there's no big eyes and little U's, but Father, you use each one of us as you see fit. &gt;&gt; Lord, from the youngest to the oldest, oh God, I'm asking the special blessing upon him. &gt;&gt; Yes, [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord. May we be May we be and have a just weight and a just balance &gt;&gt; because that is your delight, oh God. &gt;&gt; Yes. And so, Father, as you've come and you've ministered, oh God, I ask that you would find good ground that you would go with us this day, that we would be ones that would be witnesses that father people can identify that that's a Christian. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's a godly man. That's a godly son. There's something different about that man. Lord, we want to tell you that we love you and appreciate you for your goodness. How blessed we are. Be with your children as we go our separate ways. And Father, we just ask that you would bring us back again on Sunday. Oh God. We love you and appreciate you in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, you are so precious to me. &gt;&gt; Is he precious? &gt;&gt; Lord, you are so precious to me and I love you. Yes, &gt;&gt; I love you because you first love. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again. &gt;&gt; Is he precious to you? And Lord, you are so preious to me. Lord, you are so precious to me. And I love you. Yes, I love you because you first [Music] love me. [Music] I put value on Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's a just Wednesday. &gt;&gt; With a just measure &gt;&gt; and a just value. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I tell you, there was some real powerful &gt;&gt; nuggets. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; some in the message are wanting an oimpy &gt;&gt; shot. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; And you don't change your diet &gt;&gt; and your way of living. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you want to go &gt;&gt; Hey, that was good. &gt;&gt; That was a very good analogy. Hey [Music] How that [Music] Rebecca said, "Ela Ezer, tell me what he likes." &gt;&gt; What is pleasing, right? &gt;&gt; Every tape that I listen to, I hear another portion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of what pleases him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Increase your faith to be greater than the inflation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because that faith is the monetary value &gt;&gt; for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Without it, &gt;&gt; that's right. [Music] &gt;&gt; I feel a just a sweet presence &gt;&gt; strumming the chords of my heart. [Music] You won't need the love letter anymore &gt;&gt; when you have the lover. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. [Music] How that that prophet said, [Music] "Oh Lord, when it's all over, &gt;&gt; the battles are over, arms are stacked, and the Bibles are closed and we come up to your house." &gt;&gt; That's what I desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. And maybe you see yourself having fallen a little short. That's good. That's why we come to church. &gt;&gt; We say, "Lord, let me have a just measure." Yes. &gt;&gt; And when you put your value &gt;&gt; on the things where your treasure is, &gt;&gt; your habits, &gt;&gt; your career, your priorities, they change. &gt;&gt; They do. &gt;&gt; And it's not something that is a conscientious change. It just &gt;&gt; happens. Yes, it does. You find out when Paul said when I was a child I thought I spoke I but when when I became a man that's right there's a a time when you actually grow up and you say you know what the value that I had on that that sport, that career, that job, that whatever. &gt;&gt; But when you mature to a place in him, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; those values &gt;&gt; are no longer &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; there. That's why coming to church is so important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why doing those things that you know to do &gt;&gt; because you place a value on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We love you guys. Thank you, brother James. That was a very good service. You did a tremendous job on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. These these young men are getting better and better and better. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It just pops my buttons. Don't give me no Saul complex. No, sir. I say, "Hey, man. Knock it out of the park. Knock the hide off that ball &gt;&gt; because you put a priority." James says, "Hey, you start going through you move. You go through drawers and you look at something, you you look, I I I want to put such value on this and now it just sits in a drawer and I never look at it." Oh, &gt;&gt; don't you love him tonight? Let's sing that song. pleasing. Let me be be pleasing to you cuz that's my desire &gt;&gt; in all in everything that I do. Let me be pleasing because without faith, &gt;&gt; it's impossible &gt;&gt; to please you. So, Father, thank you that you increased our faith tonight. &gt;&gt; That you challenged us, &gt;&gt; that you encouraged us &gt;&gt; and you spoke to us.
