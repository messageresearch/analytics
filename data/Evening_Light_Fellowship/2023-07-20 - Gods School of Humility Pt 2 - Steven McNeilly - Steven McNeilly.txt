God bless our brother Steve is a ladies lay before the Lord and just sends to sincerity on his heart man you know just get to be a nervous wreck when you know you're going to minister the words that's good you know it's a serious thing and you know we don't take it lightly because I believe if you'll pull on the gift God is going to meet you right where you're at amen sing at verse one we'll start at the time father I see that you are drawing a line in this end I wanna be standing on your side Lord holding your soul at your kingdom come let it live and be this is my prayer this is my plea let

the worshipers oh let the worshipers [Music] [Music] I surrender to my king Hallelujah [Music] praise the Lord foreign [Music] surrendering our all to the king is not just a one-time affair it almost feels like it has to happen on a daily basis that we have to remind ourselves I've already surrendered that to the king so I'm not going to be like a dog going back to my vomit I'm not going to be like a pig going back to its Waller but I've put the past behind me I've surrendered my life and so now I'm going to live my life not for myself but for the king Hallelujah let's pray together father God we certainly appreciate this time that we can be gathered together and Lord your word says that we're two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be in their midst and we know Lord that when you're in the midst of us that you bring a blessing each and every time like brother Sean prayed you are a supernatural God and because you are Supernatural it means that you are unusual and so father we pray that Supernatural naturally unusually Lord you would come and that you would meet with each individual tonight where we're sitting that you would speak to our hearts Lord that you would change our lives father for this is our desire we ask that the word father would have an effect in our lives Lord we're confessing that we have a seat Gene within us and Lord is beginning to manifest and it's beginning to bring forth but the only thing that can make it bring forth more Lord is the watering of your spirit the anointing father that whatever life lays in there it might be made manifest so we pray father as we're living in a in a dry desert 115 degrees Lord may you come and water us afresh this evening we ask it for thy Kingdom's glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you this evening it's good to be in the house of the Lord thank you so much musicians and um I got a a little text there from brother Ron while I was in the back and he asked me to greet the Saints they're up in Salt Lake City there brother Ron and sister Sandy it's their 50th year anniversary so let's give them a big warm hand [Applause] s 50 years my goodness that is quite the Milestone isn't it we're so blessed to have a pastor that leads by example we're so blessed to have an example that is set before us as we see people they can't make it past five ten years but here we have a pastor and his wife who are faithful to the body and faithful to each other and what an example that is for us as Believers to follow and we just trust that uh they would have a real nice time up there and enjoying the nice weather I'm sure um Community the sanctuary is almost complete just a few more um touch-ups and a few more things to happen here and there but my goodness it is looking really nice and you're all going to love it so much and I wouldn't be surprised if you pick a different seat to sit in when you go because it just looks completely different and so the law Lord willing on Sunday morning we will have service in the church not right here so if you come here there might be a sign on the door go to the church and um I believe that brother Steve Clark is ministering for us on Sunday also so that'll be a real blessing for us if you have your Bible turn with me to the Book of Daniel chapter 2 and we'll read verses 36 through 45. Daniel chapter 2 and verse 36 it says this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king Thou King art a king of kings for the god of Heaven hath given thee Kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and has made thee ruler over them all thou art is head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breakouts and pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breakth all these shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou saws defeat and toes part of Potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou saws the iron mixed with Miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be broken partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawst iron mixed with Miri clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these Kings shall God Of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever and everybody said amen for as much as thou saw us that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and gold the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure you may be seated this evening terms mean your Bibles to Revelation chapter 13. very familiar portion of scripture and we'll read verses 11. through 14. Revelation chapter 13 and verse 11 and it says and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and the exercises all the power of the first Beast before him and causeth the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had powered to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell in the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live amen I would like to continue on this thought of God's School of humility and this is part two and we find out that humility in this day in which we're living is a characteristic or an art it is it is something that has been left out of the human race these past Generations it's very hard to find a person with god-given humility it is very hard to find a person that is humble in their ways is not just uh no I'm not just talking about somebody who walks around with their head down and their eyes towards the ground and and and they have a a manufactured humbleness but I'm talking about a true humility and when you find someone that has a true humility in their lives their Spirit actually Bears record of that humility and because they have a spirit of humility we find that now you can watch their life and you can watch the attributes of their life and it just brings forth an aroma of humility you would go find it very hard in this time to find somebody I that that truly has a genuine attribute of humility in their lives especially in the world humility in the world is seen as a person who is soft a person who is weak a person who cannot stand up for themselves a person that doesn't know how to fight ah you're just weak you're just soft that's how the world sees humility but brother Branham said that God actually dwells in humility and so if we are professed to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and we profess that we are bone of his bone and flesh flesh of his flesh if we profess that we are his body and he is our head and he dwells in humility how should the Bride of Jesus Christ be acting in this day she should be walking a life of humility in Hebrews chapter 4 19 57 brother Branham said I love you it goes to show that you're interested enough you don't have to come to an air-conditioned building to hear the gospel you're hungry enough to come to a place like this God never would let us build nothing but this we love it this way just a little old shack but that's the way we love it God don't dwell in glamor God dwells in humility so God is Not dwelling in the glamor and the Fashions of this world and the things that sparkle and the nice vehicles and the nice houses and even the nice churches but God dwells in one thing and that's humility God keep us humble we find out that that's why God has to put us through this school of humility because within ourselves and in our carnal flesh we're prideful we've got so much arrogance we got so much pride in our lives we're we're all about the big guys and the little use which is contrary to God's word which is contrary to the place where God dwells but God wants to dwell in a human vessel that is surrounded with humility it's so easy to get puffed up it's so easy to have a stuffed shirt just watch God bless a man or a woman and watch somebody who started out in humility whether it be in their own Ministry are in their own life all of a sudden hey they start out with their life and they drive a little beat up car I remember my first car in the U.S that I ever had and that thing was a six hundred dollar hot rod it had a massive big old pipe and it was just a police magnet it had no AC in it we had humble beginnings but watch God now take a person not talking about myself because I am very humble as you see take a person that starts off with humble beginnings and let them and let them be blessed and let their family be blessed and all of a sudden they won't go to that person's house or they used to Fellowship any with anymore because they're of a a higher degree they're they're they're they're of a higher uh what you may call it um status in life they're of a higher status within the church God help us if some of you were pried because of the materialistic things you have I pray that God humbles you I pray that he gives you a blowout on your tire I pray that something happens in your car why because God doesn't want a prideful arrogant spirit he wants somebody who's humble but we find out that it's interesting the only way that God can keep us humble in our humanity is through the trials of life we wonder why God why why is this happening why is this happening to us I'll tell you why because you're too prideful so now God has to take us through a school it's not a School of Hard Knocks because when we go through a School of Hard Knocks guess what it just makes us bitter it makes us with a heart of disappointment it takes us to a place where we're just not satisfied in our in our hearts and in our souls Hallelujah I'm like jumping two sermons ahead but that's okay you didn't know until I told you so why is it that God has to take this this human flesh and he has to break it apart he has to put us through the trials of laodiacia because he wants to dwell within your heart and when our heart is full of pride and arrogance the Holy Spirit can't dwell there so we find that whenever we whenever we look at this uh uh this statue of this dream of Nebuchadnezzar we see that it represents the Gentiles Gentile dispensation it represents the kingdoms of the Gentiles from uh from the time of Babylon until the very time that we are living in but it also represents our body of humanity it represents our flesh man and it's just so funny because we are so into ourselves we're so into our carnal man we we put a nice suit on them we we want to make sure that our hair looks nice and and we want everything to look nice which is nice but in doing so we become prideful and arrogant within our Spirits do you know how much God thinks of our carnal man brother Branham said that we're just a bunch of dirt bags what was it he said you're worth about 50 cents whatever it is he says and here we are we get out here and we really think we are something we really think that we are somebody and we really think that we're doing something in in this life but God cares absolutely nothing about this carnal man because there was a stone that the builders rejected and that stone that came and had crushed this image this Gentile Kingdom what does the word of God do to our flesh man it crushes him it annihilates him it breaks them apart why because the carnal man and the spiritual man it cannot co-mingle together how can you serve God and Mammon at the same time how can you serve two masters at the same time how can bitter and sweet water come out of the same whale at the same time the one has got to live and the other one has got to die now notice the difference that when God breaks a person when he takes them through the school of uh not hard knocks but the school of humility there's something very special that happens to that person because when God breaks down this carnal man he just doesn't leave him in a broken state but he wants to take the clay and put it back on the potter's wheel one more time and he wants to mold the clay into the image of what the Potter has had in his mind before the foundations of the world so when God breaks a person down he's doing it that he might rebuild them and bring them into the very image of Christ it's called the stature of a perfect man he starts them off by faith and then he goes to knowledge and virtue and brotherly kindness and all these different attributes that God has within the seed he doesn't leave a person broken but he builds them up again but there are others who are broken and the reason why they're broken is because they get out from behind the protection of God's word and when a person gets out from behind to protection of the word guess what when they're broken they're in a backslidden state and when they're in a backslidden state and they're broken in their spirit in their life and their financial lives that makes them become bitter in their life because of wrong choices but when God breaks a person that person doesn't run away from God that person doesn't point the finger at God and say look what you did to me look what you did to my family look what you did to my loved ones why did you do this God no when God breaks a person it brings him in a closer relationship with God it puts them on their knees it puts them in a place of desperation and saying God I don't understand this but I love you do you see the difference so now you can look at the attributes of the life just because somebody goes through trials and temptations and situations it doesn't mean anything bad necessarily problem is we got too many uh job's friends in the assembly ah you've got secret sin in your life I know it why would God cause your life to fall apart in such a way why would God cause you to have this sickness that never seems that you can get over you've got secret sin in your life and they begin to point fingers but notice what the trial did in job's life Hallelujah he he got to a point and he said though these skin worms eat my flesh he sat on a on a on a on a heap on the ground and he was scraping his boils his family was taken away from him but yet he said I know my redeemer liveth I know that I'll see him one day in this flesh this situation is just temporary in my life and I know that I'm innocent before God if you know you're innocent before God it doesn't matter what anybody else says so what did the situation do it brought an attribute out of his life that caused him to call on God it caused him to seek God but it didn't cause him to run away from God now notice Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis the same thing was happening to them wrong choices they made a wrong choice in their life and because of that they were banished from the Garden of Eden but what did they do when sin entered into their lives they hit themselves they ran from God how are you going to run from God where are you going to run to oh if I go to the deepest depths of Hell Lord you're there if I go to this place Lord you're there what's the point in running so now you can look at a person's life and by their characteristics of how they're going through the situation you can tell what's going on in their lives you can say this person is being broken of God so that they might be rebuilt stronger and in a formable image in the image of the Potter's mind or look at the attitude of the person now brother Branham said that Babylon through Nimrod as the beginning of all idolatry Pagan mythology worship and when did it start it started in Genesis as the head of gold and it ends up in the feet now we realize that brother Branham said that footsteps are possession meaning that this form of religion and of idolatry that began in the head now goes down to the feet and this this worship of idolatry now has spread throughout the whole entire world this Babylon spirit that started in Genesis it ends up in the Book of Revelation now we have to remember that though we can put a name to it and we can say Nimrod we understand that it wasn't just Nimrod as a person but it was a spirit that was driving Nimrod because the man that had the name Nimrod is dead and buried he's not with us no longer but the spirit that began there is the Same Spirit of idolatry it is the same Spirit of paganism that continues now to down to the Book of Revelation to this very Church age that we're living in we understand that he was just a man that was acting out whatever attributes and characteristics of the spirit that dwelt within his life even though the man died the spirit never died brother Branham said that God will take his man but he'll never take the spirit and the devil does the same thing his man might go off the Earth but the spirit lives on I'm so glad that there's coming a day and it's called the Lake of Fire that all these spirits that bombard us and give us such a hard time on a daily basis they're going to be cast into that fire never to bother us no more but until that day we have a fight on our hands the end the sign of the time 1958 brother Branham said and the first thing you know some little painted face Jezebel looked around and said what's the matter and then she was All Shook Up and then he thought well now wait a minute no one can get in the gate the guards are at the gate no one can get over the wall we got the wall lit but God can look down God hates sin and loves the sinner he hates the sin he loves America but he hates her sin he loves his church but he hates the sin in the church let me say this that God loves you but he hates the sin that so easily besets you that's in your life he says he hates the sin and the church but it hasn't changed Spirit don't die the same Spirits was in them people are in these people today the devil takes his man but never his Spirit God takes his man but never his spirit talking about spirits real quick we realize that in the Garden of Eden until Satan had entered into the Beast the Beast had never done any harm but it wasn't until Satan had entered himself into the Beast it wasn't until that time that he began to manipulate and work on the reasonings of Eve it wasn't until Judas Iscariot until Satan entered into the heart of Judas that's when he betrayed the Lord before that Spirit entered into him he was part of the disciples he was part of the work of God he cast out devils he prayed for the sick he did all these different things why because that Spirit had not entered into his heart yet but when that Spirit Satan had entered into his life it caused him to bring forth an attribute of betrayal because Satan in the beginning he betrayed God we can look at within the scriptures how that you remember the time when there was the prophets and they were prophesying and and uh and and and and and God said who who shall we send and there was a lion spirit that was sent from the presence of God and he said I'll go and I'll cause them to prophesy a lie until the spirit entered into those prophets it caused them to prophesy a lie and so we find out that Spirits now a lot of people are manifesting the spirit that dwells within their lives so it is with the bride of Jesus Christ why do we do what we do because we have the spirit of God that dwells within us why do we have this desire to live a clean holy Sanctified life because he is a clean holy Sanctified God and when his Spirit dwells within us we want to do what the spirit is telling us to do why do you believe in miracles because he's a miracle-working God why do you believe in the power of the spoken word because in the beginning he spoke his word that's why we believe it so why do you do what you do why are you the way you are because I am how I am because he was as he was I do what I do because he did the same also Hallelujah the spirit of God will make you act and do things that you're carnal man would never thought was possible what are you talking about brother Stephen are you talking about speaking in tongues Maybe but what I'm talking about is this that when somebody Smite you on the cheek what does the carnal man want to do he wants to thump him somebody cut you off on the road somebody steps on your toes so what is the carnal man what's his first reaction eye for an eye on a tooth for a tooth man that's my first reaction but when the spirit of God takes over when somebody does something against your family what does the carnal man want to do he wants to hate the person I'll never talk to that person ever in my life again why because they did thus and thus to me but when the spirit of God has preeminence in the life of a Believer what does the believer say Lord forgive them for they don't know what they did oh you want me to walk a mile with you I'll go too with you it'll make you do things that you never thought was possible it'll make you think things towards people that you never thought was possible why because it's the spirit of God now when we read the fruit notes in our Bible it's plain to see that most historians are on the same page of the the order of this of the Gentile dispensation starting off with Babylon and going on to the means of Persians and going on to the grecians and into the Roman Empire you find it you can read it in your footnotes of the Bible most historians will agree on these things but now it took a prophet to take this this stature this dream this this vision of the of of the Gentile dispensation and take it from history and and bring it into a a modern event being made clear by prophecy notice this the Feast of the trumpets 1964. notice quickly now these Supernatural demons wow under the auspices of a United Nation United groups together eastern and western notice what brother Branham called them Supernatural demons he said just like the right and the left foot of the image that Daniel saw how they wouldn't agree and mix with one another the word Eisenhower during that time Eisenhower it means iron Chris gev means clay and he pulled off his shoe and he beat it on the desk with the League of Nations Chris Kristoff did dusting dusting off oh my the hour that we're living the church and its condition so now brother Branham takes this very same vision this dream that Nebuchadnezzar has and he brings it down into the time that we are living right now I believe the date was 19 and 60 or something like that when it happened and here is these two men the eastern and the western side and the Bible said that they would never mix they would never come together they would never agree and here he was he took off his shoe and he beat it on the desk let me ask you a question why did he not beat his hands on the desk why did he not beat his head on the desk why did he not beat something else on the desk because that wasn't where we were in the time of Prophecy it wasn't where we were in the timeline of God to fulfill his word but we weren't in the head we were at the feet and so he takes off his shoe a representation of the feet of the that that consumes our feet and our toes within it and he beats it upon the desk nobody else was talking about this but brother Branham picked it up and he says oh my where are we at we are at the end time because what happens whenever we're done with defeat this rock that is June out of the mountain without hands it smashes the image so it takes the prophet of God now to take a modern event and to say this is that where are we at in the timeline of God Jezebel religion 1961. this is a pretty lengthy quote and you people for politics because you're just a good Democrat voted for something like that and soldier birthrights of americanism and Christianity to give it over to the prostitute that run Us in this nation what made us what we was see how she's been creeping in what's he talking about the Roman Catholic Church real easy until now really see how she's been creeping in real easy until now she's on the throne sure the White House Throne watch did you see the other day about the Catholic schools and Protestant schools support the Catholic school but not the protestancy oh brother you watch for a wave of stuff coming forth now notice as they did it look what taken place all this sin heaping in got to a place and got the nation in that kind of a staggering place a few years ago the Pentecostals first broke out and saved the nation a few years ago when Al Smith was going to run does anybody know who he's talking about he's talking about Alfred Smith I think it was the 1928 or the 1930 election he was the going to be the first Catholic President of the United States now watch brother Branham he's talking about this so it must be a really big deal he says but Al Smith Alfred Smith was going to run American no better then but penny cost God so worldly and went right on in and sold their rights as a Christian to politics and its politics ahead of the Bible does any I looked it up today that's how I know Alfred uh Smith or whatever his name was yeah Alfred Smith the reason he did not win the presidency that year is because all the Christian churches the Pentecostals and and all the different ones they all voted in the opposite direction for the other party why because they knew better they knew that with the Catholic President there would come Catholic ideology and there's a spirit that comes behind that whole movement because remember we're talking about spirits you may not know it or not but you were influenced and manipulated on a daily basis by evil spirits to make you do say and think things that you do not want to do think or say God help us Lord help us to keep our minds fresh to keep our minds on your word Lord to keep our minds pure he said to Pentecostals first broke out and saved the nation a few years ago but Pentecost got so worldly it went right on it went right on in and sold their rights as a Christian to politics and it's politics ahead of the Bible oh my now just a minute and watch just how this comes out now we find out what they did and the things they did we see it parallel paralleling here just exactly sin on every hand Jezebel come in she Bewitched all the people and noticed finally she began to build big shrines to bail him is that right and the balen priests flocked from everywhere to get into that place and begin to contaminate the lands with Balaam worship so now he's taken an Old Testament type and he's bringing it into the hour in which they were living in look how they've done look how they've weeded in just the things they've done look where they're at today look at Catholicism swallowing up swallowing up swallowing up marrying into breaking this just exactly what Daniel said they'd do iron and Clay wouldn't mix but mingling their seeds one with another breaking every Protestant girl marries a Catholic boy has to raise her children Catholic all like that marrying intermingling like that until it's come to a place to the whole United States is all warmed over what's it warmed over with it's wormed over with worldlyism and is wormed over with Catholicism what are we going to do as missionaries going out younger deliberate in South America and all over the part of the world Tommy Osborne and them trying to get the people out of the that paganism and they can point their finger right back that we elected our leader in the same thing what's going to happen to this world it should shake every person in here how we going to answer what's the missionary going to say you come here to liberate us from this and your own people put the same thing in your office there on the throne look back in the pages of History turn back and see if it's absolutely almost unconstitutional for it to be they wouldn't do it years ago but see we've sold out our Christian rights to politics and that's how the devil weaving his self in Ahab was nothing but a figurehead for Jezebel that's all this will be just a figurehead he won't do it himself but that system behind him will drive him to it exactly right pinch your conscience you Christian wake yourself up it's later than you think the condition that we are in condition that they were in and how they let themselves get loose my so what was it he's not talking now all of you know where I'm going with this at that time he was talking about J.F Kennedy and how the people had elected him into office and how he was the very first Roman Catholic to be the president of the United States he says it was almost unconstitutional to do it at one point now what is the problem with it that's the question what is the problem with well isn't he a person of Faith isn't uh Catholicism just a another type of Christianity Catholicism and Christianity are two Polar Opposites into the Spectrum because Catholicism is filled with idolatry it is filled with the spirit of paganism worshiping false gods friend of dead people all these different things now the people are not bad in themselves but brother brother Branham said it's the system that's driving the person it's the spirit remember brother Branham said it was Jezebel behind Ahab Ahab wasn't a bad man so brother Branham but it was the system that was behind him that was pushing these things before the people so now they elect because of the vote of the woman now they elect the wrong president now they elect a man that has a system and a spirit that has an agenda and that is pushing something forward before the people the restoration of the Bride tree I'm sorry for all the quotes I I forgot that we don't have the the things up here and so I realize it's harder to follow when we can't read it so I'm just going a little slower which is probably making it worse if I could only preach like brother Andrew Glover you guys would all be awake right now notices Stay With Me the restoration of the Bride tree 1962. there is a iron curtain there is a bamboo curtain there is a purple curtain brother you don't fear none of the rest of them but watch that purple curtain she is sitting right here on the throne today in this country remember just like Ahab did and Jezebel behind him the Bible calls the Catholic Church Jezebel prostitute and Ahab wasn't no bad guy I don't say that Mr Kennedy isn't a nice man I don't know nothing about him he's a man that's all I know he's the president I believe he'll make a good president it's not him it's that system behind him what is the system it is Jezebel prostitute system that's behind him with an agenda that's going to push things out upon the American public he said it's not him it's the system watch this wait till she gets wormed into the cabinet and everywhere she can then watch what will happen look what it done in other nations look what it's always done so now brother Branham takes it a step further he says wait until she what's he talking about the system the spirit of idolatry of paganism the spirit of Jezebel wait until she now gets wormed into the cabinet well what's the big deal about the cabinet these things was a flashing red light for brother Branham in his time to see that a Catholic President now was running the country and his flashing red lights were going off and now he's seeing the types in the Old Testament of Jezebel and of Ahab and now he's seeing this man with this religious uh religious system behind him now that's gonna because remember I already said we are influenced by spirits we're either influenced by an Unholy Spirit or we're influenced by God's holy spirit now a man without the baptism of the Holy Ghost how can he yield himself to God's holy spirit in order to make a right decision in his life for the country for his family whoever it may be so if we're not yielding to God's spirit we're yielding to something else and it's anointing us and it's causing us to make decisions it's causing us to do things it's causing us to say things and go places which we shouldn't be doing as believers it was a fresh flashing red light when brother Branham saw the vision in 1933 how that a woman would rule the United States he said it would probably be the Catholic Church it's not that the people within the church are bad always remember it's the system and the spirit that's behind and driving the people and the church we realize that the spirit that's behind this certain religion it is Antichrist it is anti-god it is anti-word and the fruits that it brings forth is going to be everything that's anti to this word of God so now we're beginning to realize that the people that are in office the people that are in the Senate not only in our country but every country around the world it is extremely important because there's something that's behind him that's driving them to do what they do and why they do it within this system is dwelling the place of every foul and unclean bird with her feet of iron she is trodden across the Earth and has given to the kings of the earth to drink of the cup of her fornication my goodness we realize that President Joe Biden is the second President of the United States of the Catholic faith outside of J F Kennedy we have President Joe Biden and in his Senate now because brother Branham said watch when she worms herself into the Senate so I did a quick Google search how many of the Senate you know are Catholics within the United States 27 out of 100 people in the in the senate or in the Senate of President Biden are of the Catholic faith meaning this they are of the same mind they're of the same faith they have the same agendas they have the same system and spirit that's behind them that is pushing them towards something to make decisions on things not based upon God's word but based upon the spirit that's driving them to do it which is Jezebel prostitute anti-wort Antichrist call it whatever you want so now we can begin to see we think well why in the world is why why is our our country uh going through what it's going through it's because of the people in the office and the decisions that they're making based upon the influence of the spirit that's driving them now I looked this up and I got this from the White House web page the cabinet and independent federal agencies because I wondered well what's so big about the Senate what does the Senate do anyways do you know miles yeah I wasn't sure myself so I had to look it up what's so important about the Senate doesn't the president make all the decisions in the United States let's see what they say the cabinet and independent federal agencies are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement and administration of federal laws these departments and agencies have missions and responsibilities as widely Divergent as those of the Department of Defense the Environmental Protection Agency the Social Security Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission is it any Wonder why we're in a place of where we are right now because the people that make the laws the people that bring these things to pass they are anointed of a certain spirit they are anointed of a certain anointing and it's something that is completely anti-word anti-god Antichrist and the longer the time goes on guess what there's going to be more laws that are passed there's going to be laws passed someday that if you're not a part of this ecumenical move we're going to close your doors we already seen it how easy it is for the whole entire world to shut down by the decisions of the leaders within that country who would have thought it not just one little country here and there not just one little state within the U.S no it was a worldwide phenomena where people were forced to stay in their houses people were forced not to go outside people were forced to get a job people were forced to do these things we realized that this system now that brother Branham said is on the throne of the United States we realize that she's running the country he said what's she going to do next what's going to happen we're going to take a loan we're going to pay off all our debts and he said when we take our loan from the church we're going to sell out our birth rates where are we at in the timeline of God you see this man taking off his shoe and beating it on the desk you see these different things we see the world is falling apart all around us we see that as Believers and Christians we have absolutely almost zero rights to speak our minds we have zero rights to say well I'm a Christian and I don't believe in this way of living I don't believe that two men should be together I don't believe in this transgender movement I don't believe in these different things and because of your beliefs they'll call you a homophobe they'll call you evil they'll call you all kinds of of of bad things and they'll try to put you in jail try to make a big deal out of you why because you're not going along with their agenda but yet it's okay for everybody else to speak their minds it says worldwide my mom text me the other day and she said they had a gay rights parade in Belfast or whatever uh about a week or two ago and I think the first half of their little quotation it was It was kind of profane and I can't remember it so that's a good thing but the second part was we're coming for your kids something something we're coming for your kids something something we're coming for your kids why isn't somebody telling them hey who's coming human traffickers are going to come from my kids what are they talking about no nothing has ever said you know why they want to come for our kids because they can't have kids of Their Own now look at the importance of where we're at in this present day look at the importance that we have as families as heads of the homes as fathers over our children as mothers over our children look at the responsibility that we have to teach our kids truth to tell them what's right according to God's word to tell them what's wrong according to God's word not according to what the system that's running the country says Hallelujah this system is nicolaitanism to the core as the musicians come we'll bring this to a close and it wants to divide and conquer the true worshipers of our privilege of how we worship God in spirit and in truth and it's being done by passing these laws amongst us well it's the law it's got to be true ha not if it's not according to God's word we are very quickly as Believers going to a place that we no longer have free speech we are told that we have free speech but when we use our speech freely and speak on the things of the conditions of the convictions that's on Upon Us Upon Our Hearts guess what's happening they're rising up against it calling us evil calling us Warlords whatever it may be you're just full of hatred against you're a Christian you're supposed to have love towards God's creatures well love is corrective [Music] brother Branham said in one of the quotes that I read he said that this is not a Time to let loose [Music] Pentecostals they got worldly they let loose [Music] they started taking speaking in tongues is the initial evidence they started getting all riled up they started getting all loose in their worship [Music] started getting all loose in their lives toward the only thing that It produced was an imitation the only thing that it was producing was a hypocritical Christian and now we can see it creeping in and if we're not careful it'll creep into our lives and it'll creep in to our churches people are getting too loose with their life [Music] we'll just loosen up man now a person within the message somebody who wants to hold a standard somebody who says it's time to kick the TV out it's time to sanctify the home it's time to get off your cell phone it's time to get off YouTubers it's time to do these things why because there's a looseness within the church and the ones who want to stand and have a conviction in their lives guess what they're being seen as as legalists well you're just a legalist you need to loosen up a little bit you're a little uptight [Music] brother Branham said it's not a time to let loose but it's a time for us as Believers to tighten our belts it's a time for us as Believers to re-sanctify our homes it's a time for us as Believers to get back to get back to our first love a life of sanctification a life filled with Holy Ghost and with overcoming power well if you just soften up a little bit if you just loosen up a little bit if you just if you just let loose and relax [Music] yeah let loose and relax a little bit see what happens coming for our children [Music] and when I heard that you gotta fight in your hands [Music] ain't gonna take none of my kids [Music] ain't gonna preach some kind of Filth to my kids in schools and these different things and think I'm just going to stand by and let you do it you think you're gonna come and take something away from me that God gave me good luck [Music] it's time for us to tighten up it's time for us to tighten our belts it's time for us to let loose of the things of the world these things that that get in our way of of having a closer walk with God I I feel burdened in my heart right now and I'm thinking there's there's too many of you are living a loose life letting things into the home that shouldn't be there Stephen do you ever let your kids watch yeah that's sure I do but it's not every night it's not every day but you know what it's time to knock it back a little bit [Music] why they want you to let loose because if you just let loose just drop the standard well everybody else is doing it how about you be a standard Bearer how about you stand upon the word of God on your own convictions how about not using somebody else as your absolute somebody else is your standard Bearer but get on your knees and see God and say father what is my convictions for my family and my household no matter what anybody else is doing chances are if you are letting loose in your your softening up in your walk and your convictions chances are when the squeeze comes chances are when there's a little bit of pressure put on you you'll fold like a squares can God doesn't want no compromisers God doesn't want a bunch of people that says yeah I believe the message but yeah it's a little bit hard to do that so don't you realize the hour in which we're living yeah I do be compromise now chances are you'll be a compromiser when the Lord comes [Music] if you compromise in the little things guess what you'll compromise and big things let's bow our heads together [Music] father we see the time where we're at in the great timepiece of God and Lord we know without a shadow of a doubt we're there we're at the End Time Lord and it's a great and it's a dreadful day for the Bride of Jesus Christ who you are have a desire to hold a standard within their lives within their homes within their families we know Lord that it's going to be a great day but to the compromisers to the ones Lord that are letting loose father is going to be a dreadful [Music] thing Lord we feel the pressure Lord not only do we see the darkness but we feel the darkness not only do we feel the darkness Lord but it's all around us and it's smothering us I pray that you would shine light in our hearts and in our lives perhaps father there's those amongst us that have let down the standard they've gotten a little loose Lord they've been yielding to the wrong things they have been given themselves to the things in the peoples of the world chasing after money women in popularity Lord I ask for a Special Touch in their lives and if you have to Lord I pray that you would take them through the school of humility because our desired Lord is this that not one is Left Behind Lord we're not here as Believers to be left behind but we're here on a Wednesday night because Lord when you come we want to go and so I'm asking now by your Holy Spirit Lord that you would Quicken the hearts and as you Quicken Hearts father I pray as when they would go home Lord and realize that things are a little loose that it would go beyond the Intercourse of the Mind and that it would go down into the heart of every believer and that it would cause an action May there be a reaction to the action of the word tonight Lord [Music] and may that reaction father bring forth fruit some 60 some 90 some 100-fold father that thy name may be glorified amongst us here father we love you so much we thank you for your word and Lord we are honored to be living in such a time as this bless your people take us home safely bring us back on Sunday Lord with an anticipation Lord father for greater things thank you now in the name of Jesus [Music] Jesus Christ what a time we're living in [Music] what a day it is it's a great day but it's also a dreadful day it is a great day to those who are watching and waiting for us coming it is a great day to those who are trying their best to live for standard for Jesus Christ but it's a dreadful day to those who think they're right but yet because of their inconsistency because of their looseness and slackness in their lives [Music] I trust this evening very sobering thought [Music] we all think we're doing okay but there's certain areas in our lives guess what time to give it over it's time to give it to God [Music] I'm to let go of it it's time to release it because time is too short to waste time on silly things my brother my sister let me just speak to your hearts I say don't waste no more time [Music] if you're not ready there's still time to get ready [Music] he hasn't come yet but yet he's coming and so it's time for us as individuals to take inventory of Our Lives what do I need and what do I not need what's good about me and what's not good about me who cares what's good I want to work on those things which are not good and it's a hard thing to do is to take self-inventory of yourself and to be honest with yourself and write it down have you ever done that have you ever taken a synopsis of yourself and the things that that you know are not right according to God's word and you write those things down [Music] throw up because you know that it is not according to God's word I guarantee you if you do it it'll have an effect in your life [Music] and if you read it and you say my well I sure don't want to do that anymore I sure don't want to act like that anymore God these are the areas that I'm struggling with Now by your Holy Spirit come and take control amen let's Stand Together [Music] Satan lay before me is Temptation of his desire to steal away my feet but I have found inside the revelation strength I need to keep in his grace [Music] something keeps all in me [Music] every day I see he's helping me Faithfully to overcome our trust he's guiding me constantly giving me foreign [Music] verse one verse one the trials of this world was getting closer the pool I felt

Faithfully to overcome my try us he's guiding me constantly giving me victory oh he's a reality something keeps holding me first too oh and Satan lay before him his temptation all of his desire to

amen are you thankful for that tonight amen just very sincere thought it was a song that came to my mind and the guy that pinned it he said Satan you can't have my family Satan you can't have my increase Satan you can't have my joy and you know what he said This Means War you know what I declare war on Satan I won't stand aside and sacrifice our families this body or anyone to a system amen I believe the Lord is calling us out of a system by his word amen you believe that it's just about our heads Heavenly Father God I thank you Lord for each and every individual Lord [Music] each family
