active at all and so we could noticed he had started running a fever which we monitored and there's a pretty strict protocol to when someone on chemo runs a fever and it after an hour it got worse and so we called and we had to take him actually back into the ER Monday evening about 7 38 and um you know for three-year-old to access that Port again was traumatic for him twice in one day was tough for a little guy and uh just prayed just keep in your prayers um they did give him some antibiotics he's doing uh he's doing good thank the Lord for that and it's just he'd been diagnosed with a viral

o'clock we were released from the hospital so he's at home resting and he's his normal little happy self and we're very we're very thankful we believe the Lord has moved on his behalf just to see how

is evening Lord we are here come by our way O Father have your way in this service we commit our lives this time into your hands bless your people tonight in Jesus precious name amen amen you love him tonight amen if you have your Bibles you turn to Ecclesiastes 5. yes Ecclesiastes five and we're going to turn to John 14. Ecclesiastes 5 and 1 says keep thy foot when thou goes to the house of God and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they considered not that they do evil and as I begin to think on this be ready more to hear than give a sacrifice of Fools and the Lord's been dealing with us here and I'm going to keep going but it came to me when I woke up and it came to me that you know as I begin to look and it popped up on my calendar does anybody know what today is it's Ash Wednesday Ash Wednesday people go before the priests and denominations and different religions and you go and you confess your sins and you make promises to and your devotion unto God and it's the first day of Lent and in Lent for the next 40 days they sacrifice something as a representation of what God did in the desert and what the reason this stuck out to me because back in high school I had some buddies and you would ask him what did you sacrifice now I say this with respect because my family my my mom's side of the family is Catholic and they're very devout very sincere Catholics but they would go and they would sacrifice something and I would ask him what did you sacrifice some would give up Facebook for the 40 days some would give up video games and one of my best friends you know what he gave up eating hot Cheetos a sacrifice of fools you see you go and they just what are they living by what is something that they can give up for 40 days to live without Hot Cheetos and I began to ask him how does that apply to your life how does that how does that even work but yet that's just where they're at that's they've grown up as kids giving up something let's go on in verse 2 be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be haste to utter anything before God for God in heaven and thou was upon Earth therefore let thy Words Be Few for a dream cometh through a multitude of business and a Fool's voice is known by a multitude of words and this is our thought tonight when a when thou vow is The Vow unto God defer not to pay it for he that hath no pleasure and fools pay that which thou has vowed better is it that thou should as not vow then thou should as vow and not pay says suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the Angels it was that it was an heir wherefore God should God be angry at that voice and destroy the work of thy hand for in a multitude of Dreams in many words there are also diverse vanities but fear thou God let's turn to St John 14. Saint John 14 verse 1. and it says let not your heart be troubled you believe in me in God believe also in me for in my father's house are many mansions if it were so not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am he may be also you can be seated tonight now I had to call Brother Stephen after Sunday service and get some of my notes back but do you believe that God has a channel that you can tap into that thing sometimes you'll be about your daily life and you can say a prayer and you can maybe read a scripture and sure enough that the minister will begin to preach on those very same things and tonight we would like to talk on true to your vows true to your vows and with a subject of you or she you or she now I trust we can get this thought across and you know as I begin to think on this it was I began to take self-inventory you begin to think God am I staying true to my vow am I staying loyal to who I am and I'm doing all that you're calling me to do and I begin to look at vows in the Bible and if you have your Bible turned to numbers 30 but you see this Bible is the greatest love story and it's the greatest vow ever given to man and I can tell you one thing that God is true to his vow that down through time and down through all generation and down through every Church age God has been true and he's kept his word and God makes his vows and he takes his vows very seriously he writes a whole chapter here in numbers 30 and we're just gonna for the sake of time I'm going to read a portion but then I'm going to try to paraphrase it and Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel saying this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded if a man vows a vow unto God and swears an oath to bind his soul with the bond he shall not break his word and he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth and if a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house and her Youth and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every Bond where which she had bound her soul shall stand now listen but if her father disallowed her in the day that he heareth not any of her vows or his barns with wherewiths she hath bound her soul shall stand but the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed it so you see that and then he goes on to talk about a married woman and it's the same thing for a married woman that if a married woman were to vow a vow unto God and she would make a vow and her husband hear the vow and he holds his peace and that vow goes through then she is responsible for feeling that vow but yet if her husband hears that vowon disallows it then God voids that vow and I begin to think spiritually that we have a Heavenly Father that whenever we go into prayer and we begin to cry out to him maybe in a season or wherever we're at we begin to vow and make vows and Promises yet we have a heavenly father and we have a father and a husband that is able to stand there and be a rightful judge of the vows that we make because he knows the intents and the thoughts of the heart and he isn't he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities he knows when to allow it and he knows when to avoid him in Deuteronomy 23 and 21 when thou vows when thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God thou shall not slack to pay it for the Lord thy God will surely required of Thee and it shall be a sin in thee but if thou forbear it meaning if you refrain from saying in a vow it should not be no sin in thee that which has gone out of thy lips Thou shalt keep and perform even a free willing offering according as as thou has vowed unto the Lord thy God which thou has promised with thy mouth you see God isn't pleased in just lip service he just doesn't want you just to say things just to say things when you say something he wants you to be a man of your word a woman of your word that vow has to mean something in Psalm 61 I'm trying to build a thought here he says Hear My Cry O Lord attend unto my prayer from the end of the Earth While I Cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for Thou shalt be thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower for mine enemies I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the covert of thy Wing say law for thou o God has heard my vows thou has given me the heritage of those that fear thy name in verse 8 and so I will sing praise unto thy name forever that I may daily perform my vows you see we want to daily perform our vows we just don't want to perform vows when it's convenient we don't want to perform vows when you feel like it when times are good you see when you make a vow sometimes you're in a good season in your life but there's going to be hard times that come and your vow is just as good in those hard times as it is in the good times it's easy to praise God when you're on the Mountaintop it's easy to say all is well for whenever you're going through a hard time we have to keep our vows keep our promises and may we daily perform our vows I came across this this story and it's just I love how God does this when you begin to study and it's not necessarily looking up certain things and it's just you reading your Bible and maybe it's for somebody tonight but I came across this story in Hannah and first Samuel if you have your Bible scroll over to first Samuel first Samuel 1. and we're going to start at verse 9 but the back story of Hannah is she's obvious she's the the mother of Samuel here and she's the second wife to El Khan if I said that right and he has two wives now one wife he has has all the children their family and here Hannah sits barren now God in verse 5 he says and God closed up her womb he closed up her womb now let's pick it up in verse 9 and he says so Hannah Rose after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk and now the Eli the priest sat down sat upon the seat by a post in the temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sword and she vowed a vow unto God you ever been going through a hard time year after year she would go to the Tabernacle and she would cry onto God cry unto God for a child ask God let me be of man-child and yet God closed up her room in verse 5. but he did it for a purpose because whenever you get serious with God when you vow to God here and she vowed a vow and said oh lord of hosts if that will indeed look upon my afflictions of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaiden will but wilt thou give unto thy handmade a man child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head you see there was a time and a season that that was this was to come into fruition but it took handed to get serious with God it took Hannah to get into a place into a condition that God can bring this this purpose this miracle of a man-child to pass you know maybe sometimes it's time to get serious with God and make a vow with him to say enough is enough I'm going to take God at his word and say God if you give me this man child if you deliver me from this if you bring me through this trial right Miami and I know that he'll perform it now I begin to look naturally because what God does naturally he reflects spiritually and you know the biggest vow that we can make as human beings is a husband and a wife and you know first there must come a choice and when you choose and in whom you choose it will reflect on the character that's inside you and we know that a virtuous woman is the best thing for a man next to Salvation and and how important it is that we choose wisely because the choice and The Vow is what marries Us in the eyes of God The Vow is what marries Us in the eyes of God and I believe a hundred percent that you must have a relationship with Jesus Christ before you make any vow man to one man to woman or whatever you're trying to get married and move on and be you know get into a relationship you must first have a relationship with Jesus Christ because your relationship with Jesus Christ right now is going to be a reflection of how your personal relationship is with your wife because if you have a relationship with her and you have communion you have Fellowship you go on dates and you hang out and you do all these things and you spend time together that's the same reflection of your spiritual Walk With Jesus Christ because if you expect that you don't have a relationship and you're not praying and you're not reading and you're not talking and having communion you see God all he desired is to have fellowship with somebody this whole love story is based around fellowship and having a bride and having a family and that's all he wants it's a desire of each one of us to have a help mate to have a wife to have a best friend but yet your personal walk right now with Jesus is going to be a reflection of how your relationship is with your wife so if you're not true to Christ right now on your vows how can you be true to your wife most you see a vowel is a two-way street it requires Fellowship it requires love you see marriage doesn't fix natural desires naturally a husband and wife when she becomes a part of you and you become one and you make that vow everything you have she has everything you are she is she should have full access to everything that you have because you see the thing is is me you know and then obviously there's different ways to my wife has full access I give her a credit card she has full access why because I have confidence in the character of her I don't have to sit there and restrict her yeah we might sit down and say hey let's be you know let's not splend this or let's not do this or she comes up to me and asks can we buy this or do this because it's my confidence in her right but I give her full access because everything I am she is and you see there's different types of relationships naturally some might go on dates go on destination dates and travel and do different things some might go on food dates my wife loves to go and try out different Cuisines and all these different things some might buy flowers and I thank the Lord that my wife thinks that's a waste of money so I say praise the Lord and I agree no a little secret we do is she she uh instead of buying flowers spending forty dollars and they die the next you know week or whatever we buy a plant she said buy me a plant and then I can remember when we did a trip or whatever it was our anniversary but you see we all have different makeups we have all different relationships with our wives they're all personal one with another you can't be something you're not and you can't pretend or you can only pretend for so long now I began to look at The Love Languages there's five love languages and in those Love Languages you have physical touch and words of affirmation and give gift-giving and quality time and acts of service and I begin to think spiritually that God uses some of those Avenues to talk with us when you need the Embrace of his presence he comes down in your room and in your prayer closet and he gives you some physical touch and wraps his arms around you we need words of affirmation he might give a minister or somebody a friend to give you words of encouragement you see and then even in in our natural but in your spiritual what is your spiritual love language how does God use you as his bride of Christ and I began to look at the different types I begin to think of what what's God's type of woman now we all have a type of woman right the one you marry is your type of woman or if you're single the one you're looking after is the one your type of woman but God has a type of woman and I began to think what is God's type of woman because as I look across you see the diversity of people you see the diversity the differences and in Revelation 7 and verse 9 and I after I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number and of all Nations Kindred and people and tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with right robes and Palms in their hands you see God is calling a bride out of every Kindred tongue Nation people he's calling people from every part of the Earth from different backgrounds God is calling elect lady from every part of this Earth and different backgrounds different walks of life different churches different size churches different pastors and something came to me and it's a mini-membered body and so I looked up many membered body in the scripture we can find it in First Corinthians and God just began to deal with me last night and he says now concerning spiritual gifts brother and I would have you not ignorant he know that ye are Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as you were LED wherefore I give you understanding that no man speaking by the spirit of God calls Jesus accursed and then no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost now listen now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are differences of administration but the same Lord there are diverse diversities of operations but in the same God which worketh all in all right but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all and for to one is given the spirit of words of wisdom into another words of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit and another Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another works of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues and to another interpretation of tongues but all these things worketh that the one in the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jew or Gentile whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink from one spirit you see and gone began to deal with me that obviously it said many times that every church is sovereign there's different ways to operate a church there's different ways there's different ways of administration but you see we all have one goal one objective and that's to make this Rapture that's to get a bride ready because Christ is coming for here shortly brother Branham says in 65 things that are to be he said in my father's house or many mansions and I don't believe that when we get to heaven that will be when we get to heaven that will be just everyone looks exactly alike I don't believe that that all blondes and or brunettes or little or big or Giants I believe that God is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got planes he's got deserts he's got different things because he's made it the way he wants the way he wanted and he made the season summer winter spring and Autumn he made the seasons and it shows he's a god of variety he made you in a variety some men real blusterous and some real dogmatic and others are fine in others kind and you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom you see God is a god of variety even in weddings you see the difference of giving vows some sing a song and some write their own vows and some are normal and just say the normal vows but you see that vow is between you and the person you're making that vow to it's sovereign I have a vow between me and my wife and that's all I worry about my loyalty my consecration everything that I am is being loyal to that one vow that I've given my wife I shouldn't have to worry about this this vowel and that vowel and I don't try to make my brother's wife see and agree with the vows that I made my wife you see we're all Sovereign we're all make our own vows with Christ now the Bible says in First Peter 3 and 1 wise be in subjection to your own husbands and if you begin to read farther on it says in First Peter 3 and 8 and it says finally be all in one mind having compassion one to another love his brother and being pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrary wise blessing knowing that you either they're unto cold and that you should inherit a blessing you see we're all called we're all calm you see we all have a purpose and one goal and that's to make this Rapture and we're striving for the same thing you see if we stay true to our own vows now if I can use an example in the Old Testament in the Old Testament when you would make a covenant with another person you would take a piece of paper Brother David I'm going to make a covenant with you and you would take a piece of paper when you make that you would write your agreement down whatever it may be and you would write this let's go ahead and stand and you would write an agreement and we'd both agree on it and so I'm going to write a vow and My Vow would be I promise to worship when David's lean songs and he promises to say Amen when I preach okay amen all right that's our vow but see you have a vowel and it's written out and we would tear this vowel in half and he would take one and I would take one and what we do is we'd kill a sacrifice and we'd kill the sacrifice and we'd split it in two and we'd put one behind me and one behind him and if none of if one of us didn't fulfill this vow that we made we would be as dead as that sacrifice how important it is for us to keep our vow to God I'm gonna make another vow Jonathan come up stand on this side it's the same thing we would make a vow and he would take that vow now I got two vows understand where I'm going with this I cannot put these two together these two do not match so why do we get caught up in one another's vows worrying about is he keeping his promises he keeping his this vow is between me and him and this vow is between me and him you can't cross vows because they won't match up they won't dovetail one with another thank you Brothers you see God made a vow with each one of us he gave us a vow to live by that our life might dovetail one with another and each one of us have a vow to keep with him a covenant one with him and our life must dovetail one with another with this vow and we must stay true to this vow so we shouldn't get caught up and if I'm keeping my vow over here and he's keeping his vow God made a covenant with each one of us and over on Calvary he took a sacrifice and he killed his only begotten son and just like the first Adam when God put him to sleep into the Earth and from his rib he pulled out a help me a bride for Adam so did Christ Calvary at Calvary he Sled Shed his only begotten son and as the soldier pierced his side blood and water came out from him and his Spirit left and brother Branham says the he split his son in two as a sacrifice and he sent his body up to the right hand of God and he sent his Spirit down to the church for you and I and now he's pouring himself out in questions and answers in 64 he says when Jesus suffered in that body he suffered cause a man and a woman because a woman and a man are one person Eve was taken out of Adam in the church what happened God opened up his side at him and took out of there helped made a bride and God opened up at his side at Calvary and took out a bride and when Jesus died at Calvary remember the bride was taken from his body until he was dead she was not taken from his body until he was dead why because he must die first and Redemption must happen listen he had already died and then they was going to break his leg and a prophet said they'll be not to be one bone broken and so they drove they've done drawn back the hammer to break a leg and a man went up with a spear and pushed it in him through his heart and water and blood came forth he was already dead she was already redeemed in the body by his death so there's no more suffering no more suffering tribulation period for the bride do you see God had already died there he hung on a cross and he spread out his arms and he said it is finished and he bowed his head and died and their Redemption happened so the bride is already redeemed before it happened so the the spear that pierced his side did not kill our lord Jesus what happened is Spirit came out upon the Earth came down for his bride you see if you were in them at Calvary your redemption's already been paid your vow has already been made in the marriage of the Lamb he says now look it's so perfect that when God took and made a man and to show that he did not want it out of anything different the man was not in the original Cree the woman was not in the original creation so she is not in the creation but she is a part of Adam she's a byproduct but he goes into the side of Adam now to make another creature but to take a part of a of the creature and make another creature out of it and he took the masculine spirit that was in Adam and he took the feminine spirit that was in Adam rather and put it over into the woman so both spirit and body they become one he says what a beautiful type it was that God did at Calvary he took Christ and connected him with the church through rivie inside he brought the blood that cleansed the person that sanctifies the Flesh of the church and puts the spirit of the Living God that he took off the cross there out of Christ and he put it into where the individual there you are there you become one Christ and you are one you see he poured himself out into his into his church everything Christ was he poured out into his church but yet you got to make it personal with you that everything God was everything God is your husband everything he is he pours into you and you become one he's one with the individual you see in choosing of a bride he says the True Church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him and his promised word till every mind that is in Christ is in you what a difference and then he says the modern Church and then there's a spiritual church and both are being pregnanted what is it even as this Asbury Revival is happening causing a Revival all over what are they doing they're being pregnant but yet there's a spiritual church that's being pregnated with the Lord Jesus Christ and I began to look that as it was at Calvary for the Branham says that there was a representation of both at Calvary both sides he says you see he said it in the mark of the beast he says that there was a representation of both sides he says we see three crosses but really there was four he said what God was doing the only begotten son came down and God slain the only begotten son and he took he came from heaven and he was going back to heaven with the repented Center and Judas was the fourth tree and he hung himself on a sycamore tree and he came from Hell the Son of Perdition and he came from hell and he went back to hell and he took with him The unrepented Sinner [Music] so what vow are you making what side are you fulfilling we got to choose one or the other you can't serve two masters you can't serve God in Mammon right we got to serve somebody I want to say I want to serve the Lord Jesus I want to be on his side I want to surrender my all to him so we see that there's two sides and here in the last days brother Branham says on the continuation that quote of choosing of a bride in the next paragraph he says the world counselor in churches will produce the world and the Antichrist through denomination shall be given birth to her son the Antichrist the other is being pregnanted by the word of God and will bring forth the body and finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ which isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and Christ in his body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together make the body one again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own she sold out to her formal things you see the Finish the finished Body of Christ the body of Christ isn't finished God is incomplete without you as great as God is and all down through time he's fulfilled himself but yet he's not complete without his bride you have to be so sold out to him dead to your former things now listen God will never join himself to you if you're not dead to your first husband God can't do it it's against his law he'd be get committing adultery you see a woman is so sacred in what she has a woman is so sacred that she must keep that for only her husband and if a woman goes out and loses that sacredness she can only be forgiven but she can't be justified because if you go out and you lose that you can only be forgiven by your husband but you can't be justified because you she can never have that virginity back are you with me and so now is naturally if a woman is untrue she can only be forgiven and now we're living in a generation where it's a woman's age that the beauty of women are at all-time high that women are thrown in your face at every turn it could be a microphone commercial and they got to have some naked woman on there it could be a car commercial and there's got to be some kind of woman on it why because it's the spirit of the age and you see now we're living in a time where there's no vows there's no marriage vows there's no accountability why because then they have to stay true to one person they don't have the freedom they don't have the Liberty to live their lives to enjoy life because they're bound to a vow they're living under a conditional vow well as long as I get to do this then I'll agree to this you see and when times get tough they just want to hit the door I know buddies that I grew up in high school with and they've been living with their significant other for seven years and they've never agreed to have their vows because then it makes it a whole lot complicated if they want to leave you take a man who has some good money a good paying job and all of a sudden you know what I'm up and out wife leaves them she takes half of everything so it's better we just not agree to make a vow of one with another see how insane our society and how corrupt the minds of our people have become and you see that's how some people's relationship was with with Christ they want it to be on condition they want a vow that fits their lifestyle they don't want to live by a vow that God gave them that he paid a price he killed his only begotten son paid the ultimate sacrifice but yet they don't want their life to dovetail with the scripture they don't want to match it up they want to pick and choose what they want to live now we know this in in second Corinthians 6 and 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers now in the message you hear this all the time for young people and we shouldn't be married one with another choosing somebody outside our ranks but I want you to think spiritually now because God can't join himself if you're not dead to your old husband that old husband be in your flesh be not unequally yoked with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with Darkness you see if we got darkness in our life how can God come and have communion with you well Concord hath Christ with the belief on what part hath the believer with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God and hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out of them out from amongst them and be separate saith the Lord and touch not thy the unclean and I will receive you you see if you do these things God will come unto you he'll make a vow with you and back to Calvary I that's why God had to make a provided way and it had to be through Calvary the shedding of his own son he had to pay a sacrifice for Redemption and you must come Christ provided way meaning that you can't put new wine in an old bottle you can't get the Holy Ghost before you're cleansed but there's a process and I want you to understand where I'm going and God help me and as I begin to think that justification is the foundation and stay with me justification is foundation because God wants you to realize something that justification is for you for the for Matthew says in in verse 12 36 he says for by Thy word shall thou be justified that's not forgiven but by Thy word shall that be condemned Romans 5 and 1 says therefore being justified by faith you are justified by faith we have a peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ you see you're just not a forgiven bride but you are Justified Justified as never did it in the first place you see you have to be justified God already paid the price and justification when you realize what justification is is for you because how many begin to think I'm not worthy I don't know why he loves me but he does I don't know why he chose me but he did through all my faults through all my failures God had to make a provided way that he couldn't have a forgiven bride but he had to have a Justified bride so he had to pay a price at Calvary and he had to shed his own son to have a token that would cover our sins through the shedding of his blood you see God loves you for what you are God loves you for who you are you know you only you can fulfill your purpose in life before the foundation of the world God predestinated for you to be you to you for you to fulfill your purpose and your placing in the body of Christ nobody can take that place I can't take that place I can't take brother Jonathan's place and he can't take my place because each one of us have a purpose each one of us have a placing and God predestinated you for a time in an hour that he has confidence in who you are that you will fulfill what's inside of you you see it's not how you see yourself but it's how God sees you listen the Apostle Paul says in second Corinthians 11 and 2 he says for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you unto one husband that I may present to you as a chaste virgin to Christ how can you be a virgin sometimes many times in our own carnal thinking you see that's where justification comes in because as a Chase virgin to Christ God's only going to marry that virgin but yet you must come that provided way that God has you see you have to be dead to your own ways dead to our own thinking staying true to her vows making sure that our lives dovetail with the word of God in the marriage of the Lamb 62 he says when and then when the church has the ceremony makes their promise and then she takes a bride the bridegroom's name she is no longer a church of the world she is a church in the Lord Jesus Christ amen now I don't mean by name I mean by birth by Nature by the power of God by the revealed truth of God in in the heart she becomes the Christian Church the great Universal Apostolic Christian Church she becomes a part of Christ and when she does that Christ inject injects into her his own Spirit his own life and the Bible says in Adam and Eve you are no longer Twain but you were one and when the woman the church is married to Christ they are no longer two they are one it's Christ in you amen that's it his life has been brought into you then you become the bride he talks about his wife being no longer boy but Branham and Skip down and he says when you come into Christ you're no more of the world you are of Christ see you care not then for the things of the world they are dead to you for he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of God is in in him so you see you can't be an artificial Christian you can't be an artificial professed Christian but you can't be a Christian become until Christ injects himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into you then you're connected in him you're no longer Twain you were one Christ promised to be in in us and the father was in Christ I and the father are one you and I are one see Christ in us all that God was he poured into his in Christ and all that Christ was he poured into his church what was the purpose to continue the gospel you see everything God was everything that Christ was he poured into us we must realize the power that lays within the elect lady the power that lays within the vows that you made see it's your confidence in the in The Vow that you make with your spouse that they will stay true to what they say and that you'll stay true to what you say many say that God was just an ordinary man just a normal man some might say that you're just an ordinary Christian but I believe that the elect go elect lady is more than just an ordinary lady because just as Jesus was out on a boat one day and the storms and the waves begin to crash down and some would say he's just a man but yet whenever he woke from his sleep and he stood at the bow of the boat and he said peace be still he was more than a man but what was it it was the deity of God how many have storms in their life and your boat is Raging and you're out on the water and you don't understand what's happening but yet I challenge you to stand on the bow of your boat because you might just be an ordinary Christian but yet as an elect Lady Of God there's something inside of you a deity that God sent down that I Calvary when he poured out his spirit and he gave it into the church he gave you that same deity that same power and it's time to speak to your storm that you say peace be still in the winds and the waves that obey your voice because it's God in you just like when Christ was that the tomb of Lazarus and some say he was just a man because he wept but yet when he said come forth he's more than a man you were more than just an ordinary Christian you're more than that as the elect Lady Of God you have full Authority you have full power everything that Christ was he poured into you and when you begin to realize that the power that lays before you how many have loved ones that are dead in sin it's time to speak to that it's time to say come forth it's time to live it's by the power of your own words by the power of your confession you see your vowel God has made a vow with each one of us he's given us full access to the word of God full access to the spoken word and it's your character to be a rightful judge of how you use it his word is full of vows made to us as the elect lady he says I'm the same yesterday today and forever he says I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world he said the works that I do a greater work that you will do you see when you begin to take these things personal they're more than just words on a scripture on a in a Bible they're just more than words on a piece of paper but it's whenever you begin to take that personal and you begin to live by it you begin to say greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world you see what God did in Saint John 14 he said I go to prepare a place what is he doing he made a vow with us and then he gave us an inheritance the earnest of our inheritance he gave us the earnest but yet he said I go to prepare a place why you just don't go to prepare a place for just somebody if I told Jonathan I'm going to prepare a place for you he'd be like well you giving me a free house but that when you go to prepare a place it's for somebody you've made a vow with somebody who you've pulled into yourself and he's made that vow with each one of us I go to prepare a place you know God says what he means and means what he says you know in the natural sometimes you go through hard times and in the natural a couple would renew their vow after so many years it's not that they're living Unfaithful and true but yet maybe they just need to renew it need a fresh love one for another maybe they need to go on another honeymoon maybe they need to go on another date whatever that may be maybe the woman has become insecure you see as time goes on and things change in your marriage even as a woman you begin to question does he still love me and you could sit there and say God how do you still love me after I've made mistakes after I've fallen after I failed naturally you might put on some weight after pregnancy whatever it may be and I'm not the young woman or I'm not the young man that I used to be but yet there's a vow made you see no matter what comes what goes in a marriage through the ups through the Downs what keeps you together is that vow because things will change hard times will come it's not if but when they will come but yet it's staying true and being loyal to that vow he's never once broken his vow children may we become bold when may we come boldly before his throne knowing that the vows that we say we must keep because God let me say it like this God has confidence or you have confidence in God I know that God will keep his end of the deal but I ask the question can God have confidence in your side can God have confidence in you to keep your in God's not complete without you he needs his bride to fulfill his work to finish off the work you see when I began to think on making a vow as I said before things sometimes things happen and even in our relationship even with my wife and you know Valentine's just happened and yet you get older and things change you begin to question not necessarily question but within yourself you begin to wonder through all my faults through all my failures do they still love me how can they still love me but yet God made a vow before the foundation of the world with you and he chose you and he predestinated you and he knew your faults he knew your failures he knew when you would make mistakes and he said I would still love you he thought so much of you he thought so much of you that he sent down his son to pay that sacrifice through Redemption through his blood he thought so much of you that you would fulfill your end of the deal that he chose you for this hour because there's one elect lady in this hour that is going to go fulfill his word let's stand let's bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we bow before you in your presence realizing Lord the vows between us made Lord and I myself want to stay true to that vow I want to be loyal I want to be a man of my word I want to be faithful and Lord you have called us you have predestined us for an hour you have chosen us and Lord we're asking for your help I don't know maybe somebody hasn't made a vow maybe somebody's been on this road a long time and they need a refreshing of their vows maybe there's some that haven't been true maybe some have Lord things come up and or we want to ask for forgiveness or we want your blood to cover us and to wash us and Lord through the power and of your blood and through justification that you sent down your son and Lord help us to realize that the Bride of this last day she's not just forgiven but she's Justified Lord she never did it in the first place our sins were thrown in the sea of forgetfulness and I'm so thankful for your grace and for your mercy that you've poured out on us brother Branham says sometimes as human nature we we can forget we can forgive but we can't forget we can't forget sometimes our human natures and they get in the way and we remember maybe the way a person was or the things they did but Lord you don't even see him that way Lord you see him as Justified you see him as washed you see him as your elect lady you see him as chosen so help us Lord in our carnality Lord to be a righteous judge of those around us to not worry about what's happening and this tick for attack and but Lord let us focus on our vow with you that our life may dovetail that I might be matched up with your word Lord we're so thankful and Lord I ask this special blessing upon your people Lord may we you be with him may you go with him may you be their portion may you uplift them and [Music]
