our lives with God and this morning they gave me the privilege to speak for 15 minutes I give thanks unto my sister for giving me this opportunity it's a privilege to be behind this Pulpit we give thanks to our brother Ron Peterson for the opportunity and to the local Ministry and the trust to be behind this pulit I don't take it lightly but with all due respect from here Words of Life come out and being here brings a lot of memories this place for me is very special we're here to speak a little bit about our brother gust [Music] my brother-in-law I can say a lot speak a lot but it's not about saying or speaking a lot yeah now it's 10 minutes but we're very thankful with the opportunity they have given us we're seeing friends family members these moments it's a little difficult but within our hearts there's a joy there's a joy in which you cannot explain it our brother Gustavo is ahead of us now for me brother my brother was an example in reality there's many several examples around us there's not going to be any excuse that we don't make it there God is giving us the opportunity God be in flesh he's in deity of human of human flesh we see around us and my brother here was a war he is a warrior the sons of God do not die they are at rest how many believe that so we do not die those that are in Christ shall not die we're just being changed what does death do and my short understanding of it like an Uber comes for me it's going to take me to my destination so that's what death does for us these moments we are we're celebrating the life of our brother Gust in the human side or aspect of it we are sad yes and yes it's okay to be sad because it is a separation but within our hearts we know it's not for a lot of time we have been taught we have a little bit of time and I remember when brother brand said when he he passed the curtain of time he heard that voice keep pressing on keep pressing on and in this morning I could say let's keep pressing on Don't Look Back look forward and it's not too far but uh we need to encourage each other not looking our mistakes failers but we can see it through Grace because we're all going to be saved by gra through our Lord Jesus Christ that's where the key is at that's where the key is at if we need forgiveness we need Deliverance it's the Lord Jesus Christ he already paid the price it's already been paid we cannot pay it because he already amen I'm going to tell you a short uh story that my brother-in-law here loved a lot and with this I'm going to close because time is at hand every time I tell him this story he would like to listen to the story the human being we always have questions what is the strongest thing in life so they went to go ask than you okay they went and asked iron iron are you the strongest thing and iron said no it's the fire because they put me in the fire and they they melt me they softened me up so they ran to the fire and they asked the fire fire are you the strongest and the fire said no I am not it's the water because they throw water at me and they turn me off so they went to the water and they said water are you the strongest he said no it's the Sun because the sun heats me up and I evaporate it evaporates me so they went to the sun son are you the strongest thing that exists and he says no it's the clouds how is it the clouds because the clouds get under me and they take away my heat so they went and asked the clouds clouds are you the strongest thing that lives on Earth they said no it's the mountains because we go through the mountains and they separate us so they went to the mountains and they ask the mountains and they asked mountains are you the strongest thing that exists in life the mountains said no it's man wow wow so man was marveled with the same man himself said and he said man are you the strongest he said no it's death wow my so they went to death and death was on his throne and they said death are you the strongest that exists and death sitting on its Throne sadly he bowed his head I once was the strongest thing that existed until a man the third day resurrected and that is the Lord Jesus Christ that is the strongest that will keep us keep us up strong keep us strong that's the the story and my daughter can come up my brother Gustavo L and he believed and he left believing in the Lord Jesus Christ God bless [Applause] you God

minutes and my whole life knowing brother Gustavo 15 minutes is impossible amen Alto my name is Alberto the father brother Gustavo was my brother we they were we were brothers and well and our youth there was a lot of things we lived but there's a hope in us right when we met the Lord and knew the Lord the the Lord says the preacher says that on that day of death than the day of birth it's better to be in the house than the house of the B because one day we have to reflect that we're going to die but have hope a lot outside that don't have hope ones that are Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb to go and speak to them the gopel of the Salvation that is the will of the Lord no one be lost all proceed to we all have an opportunity like our brother Amen to go from this life to another better life where our Lord Jesus Christ is at well so we've also had to fight of cancer we also share that amen I was also diagnosed the same around the same time my brother Gustav was diagnosed to the human mind Brothers you can understand it you cannot understand it but the word of God everything that happens to us happens good us that brother has draw us be fellowship with him amen amen to God you cannot understand it you can't many that are alive are dead amen amen and brothers there are things that we may not understand but we encourage one another let me tell you it's a very it's a demon that doesn't you can't even be one day get up every single morning and cry out and cry out Brothers but that has draw us nigh to the Lord even more every minute one draws n to the Lord and cries out him and our brother Gustavo even in that also we identify with one another greater is he that is within with us within us the the word of God says Don't Kill the the flesh that can cast your soul and and body into hell because one day we are conscious that we're going to die and we fear we do not fear made us blasphemy against the Lord contr he has given us more we can go preach this gospel amen

his wife to the local Ministry thank you for allowing us to be here my uncle Gustavo he love this church very much um I give thanks unto the Lord the opportunity he gave me in his great love he gave me a a double blessing he gave me two fathers my father Fidel [Music] AA was the brother of our brother Gustavo a when he passed away my uncle Gustavo AA he adopted me as his son me and my my two other brothers and I give thanks unto God for the life of Gustav AA I can understand that it pleased God Amen one day to shed or pour out everything that was in him pour it out all in a man named Jesus the Christ he was the fullness of the Lord there the deity dwelt but all that was in Jesus he died on the cross on Calvary he poured it out he split himself himself and he poured himself out upon his children and one day he started to live he started to live in this man [Applause] named surely I saw my Lord in this man he not only preached but he lived what he [Music] preached a man full of God it was an example for us if we're here standing my other two brothers and I Carlos a and then Fidel a it's because of men like him that they denied themselves to be able to give life to someone else that was my he was a father to me he was my pastor loved the souls he loved the people and when I think on I think of that story that the the Bible tells about that man that had been robbed and he was on the ground then a priest passed by and he even looked towards him but he continued his path then the Levites passed saw the man on the ground and kept going his way but then a Good Samaritan came and that was my uncle he helped people like this man did he took the wounded he said cure him and I'll pay the tab that was my if you were in need it didn't matter to him to put himself aside and to give to someone else how many many times he helped me when we we're left alone my uncle he he was here in the United States we were back in Mexico with my grandmother and he would always send he would always send money send money to us for us he always helped us he was always there he was always present a man he was my idol when he would call me and he would text me and he would tell me how are you doing champ and then I would feel bad cuz I didn't deserve to be called champ CU for me my uncle Gustavo he was my champ he was a man that fought from his youth he was a man full of suffering he went the Lord sent him through that path of pain but he never complained even in his last days when he decided and he called me he said Son my last days I want to be with you I want to be in your house I want to be with you guys my family I want to spend my last days there with you I want to say thank you for those days for those words for that encouragement in which you gave me because in your last days he continued being an example his his faith nevering his faith kept strong when he couldn't even raise his hands he didn't have strength he made the the most possible to lift his hands and give glory and honor the one that called him that day the one that raised them up the one that chose elect he would raise his hands and he would tell me sing a song and he loved worshiping the Lord his last days he could barely walk and he wanted to dance he wanted to jump he would say sing sing praise the Lord he was an example of a life I give thanks to God for him because God allowed me to be by his side to be able to hear His Last Breath of Life I remember when could be barely be able to open up his eyes and when he would open them he would smile and he would wink at me there was never a complaint there was never pain within him he was always thankful always happy always with him thinking of his creator I give thanks to God because I could see God walking speaking in human flesh a man like my uncle he leaves a big Legacy behind he left a big Legacy and he was the responsible one and he was the one in charge and who God sent first before us to open way to open up the path and to speak to us about that marvelous to speak to us about eternal life and he was the one that introduced to us into the gospel he is our father in the faith not only our uncle but our father I give thanks to God for him the advantage of having the making or doing the program and I put right there without limit of time I'm just kidding my uncle Gustavo i' would like to share to you what I lived with him he was always in charge of us when I got to this country it's because he was the one that brought me over and before he got married I was always with him he would always take me out to eat he was like my father I remember he took me one day to a restaurant to go eat some burritos those burritos were very good he loved them so much and we would get to that restaurant we would eat I'd have to say those burritos were this big or so so he ordered his burrito and he said one for you and we finished eating and when we finished he said you know what Mi I'm still hungry and I was surprised because that was that was a big burrito that was a tremendous burrito he ordered another burrito so he ate two burritos and I would always remind him do you remember when you eat those two burritos and he would just laugh and he said yeah I remember that how was that possible that you ate those two big old burritos I give thanks to God for my uncle I remember when I got here to the United States Mex from Mexico I didn't know of the Lord when I went into his apartment where my uncle was at I remember he grabbed the guitar and he started to sing the song God is here that was my first song it was my first experience with God and it was through my uncle because he was a musician he play the guitar he would sing preach he was a man full of gifts a man that God used for my life greatly I give thanks to God for him I'd like to thank you all for getting here I'd like you to remember my uncle for what he was a man that always loved you that was always there how many were Witnesses of that is there a witness of that of that love am if you can please stand for a little while for that he [Music] Liv thank you Uncle you may be seated God bless you amen God bless you Brothers thank you for being in this place each and every one of you that take part of the family of I said my I see my precious family that from Colorado my family from California each and every one of you God bless my name is I am the pastor over there in Orange County and I was able I had the honor and privilege to share part of my life with our beloved brother Gustavo and I testify also he was a man that loved God we lived our youth together amongst misery amongst needs but we were happy oh we do Mischief things together I remember uh his father had a birthday party oh yeah the men were drunk they were smoking drinking we were still little boys and we learned from them I remember when we got the end the tip or the end of a cigarette and we would go and hide and we would start to smoke because we would see all the men were smoking they were happy they were smiling and we would imitate them unfortunately my uncle got there because uh we were in the bathroom and and we would take a puff and then we would give it to him and that's how we were and my uncle came and then and he found us smoking a cigarette unfortunately for him he took the the the punishment of my uncle I remember the brother on a motorcycle and it was easy for us toide we would see the man that rod motorcycle to give a good Ki to get it going and and then there we were revving revving the ENT and we would throw to the side fall over and we pick it up but Fidel was not there uh he was working and and and for our luck we we took off with it and we started to take off with it and we would fall we would get back up turn it back on again and we were playing around for a and then another neighbor came with his motorcycle and I was the one riding the motorcycle and I said let's go race and the neighbor was very mad because that motorcycle was his and he asked where is Fidel I want to speak to him and it went bad for my brother Gustavo I remember once he wouldn't drink and I and we went to a birthday party I was the one invited him and I told told I'm going to show you how life is lived oh I'm going to show you how you drink that's probably 18 years old and he was younger there in that party they would receive us with a shot of tequila and then they would put seven up inside of it and they would shake it up and then and would take it in one shot they call iton H and we were the party and after a couple ofon he felt like he was the best dancer of the party he was going to go take out a young lady and then another one and then another one give me give me another that young lady over there is namana Maria and that one over there is Maria and that one is Rosita and every time he would take out a young lady he would talk to her he would ask for their names he said give me another Kon I'm going to go find [Music] [Laughter] Julie H Julie was not there and there Brothers we that's how we lived I remember we would go hunting we didn't have nothing we would find the bullets uh 22 caliber and after two or three little bullets we would collect we would go uh to a neighbor and we would ask to borrow his rifle and then we would go I remember once once I remember the rifle wasn't working the the the the the the Bulet was in the chamber well we broke it down we started seeing why it's not sh and then I checked through the the the barrel I didn't see nothing moving and and then boom the rifle shoots it didn't hit him nor me it could have killed us or an would have marked our our mouth or face it is but God delivered us I remember we found an iguana in a tree you can just see the head of the Iguana and we point at it or shoot nothing we put the other bullet in the chamber and G another shot and nothing the the ungrateful one wouldn't even move he would give us to PR until the last shot on the head and it comes down that was a teaching for me as a Christian when Christians don't move they're easy targets for the devil I remember when I went to with a cousin in idah to go H deer oh but to get a deer brother so all and I don't know where they just disappear and I remember of The Ungrateful iguana easy target well there are teachings that you learn and we learn brother Gustavo was a courageous man a conqueror he was a conqueror he was not scared even though he had many disadvantages he overcame many of his obstacles he had to come over here for the need and we would write to one another I I came over here because of him he would start to invite me to church and in the beginning I didn't want to thanks I got to know the Lord Jesus Christ I remember back then he would cut my hair I was his his his practice dummy I believe he already had that calling in him that Ministry that special Ministry and they would say what happened to you like cuz I kind of walk sideways I don't know but that's how we learned and then I would start to cut his hair too and well then oh life has to continue he was an inspiration he opened ways he he overcame many obstacles many many stories that we have our brother testifies I experienced it he would always share what he had it was a passion for him to and in a sense this world lost a great man but God has allowed and we need people like this with great testimonies jealous of the word of God God if this man could because he had a willing heart each and every one of us could also do it it's nice to live leave history in this world though our Lord Jesus Christ changed the whole world and he marked time before and after like a man not like God so have that calling that vind Brothers I come to say I have good news for you I have word of God as well I'm going to read the word of God in second Corinthians chapter 4 H if you don't have your Bible I'll read for you verse 16 and on for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light a light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory uh and now listen to this this is something very beautiful for we for we know that in if our Earthly House of the Tabernacle is dissolved we have a building of God and our house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in that we grown Earnest desire to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven uh brother I Was preparing and this was the Revelation that God gave I didn't understand it before now I understand it and the Lord brought his people out of Israel out egpt sorry out of Egypt he brought brought him through the desert you know you know the story you know the Bible while they were in the desert for 40 years a period of a generation they lived in Tabernacles they lived in tents they lived in temporary tents until God introduced them to the promised land the word of God says we know today we know that if our Earthly Dwelling Place speaking of this body we dwell in this body this is a temporary dwelling place it's a tabernacle it's a tent it's a movable tent God allowed the people of Israel in the desert put up their tents dwell in them and when the Lord would remov the cloud the people would move their tents and move and where the Lord would tell them they would Place their tents once their Tabernacle they were there for a while then the Lord would rise up again and move again and they would move their tents and then they would replace them again and time and time again that tent would would wear down until God gave him the promis your life my life is a tent that is removed and is affected day by day by the different visitations of sicknesses this tent this uh is affected as well for difficult situations we feel and it and it and it it diminishes the word of God says but we know if our our Earthly Dwelling Place this Tabernacle were dissolved would deteriorate would be lost be ripped would disappear we have a glorious hope we have a building in God in heaven not made by human hands made by [Applause] God we had a funeral service yesterday as well for a young young lady she had an epilepsy uh in the morning while she was sleeping her parents unfortunately found her her her face was not pleasing her face was very very degrad deteriorated a purple body very blue something so very it wasn't pleasing at all glorious promise and I was able to give them these Breath of Life it doesn't matter how you found your daughter or what aspect purple face or the color that she was that is a tabernacle simply it will it will we away it's deteriorating that's why we get old but you know the Lord says I go to go prepare a home for each and every one of you I'm preparing a dwelling place for each and I'm going I'm prepare you a perfect clothing for each and every one of you to the Beloved because in the Tabernacle in the T in which you are living in right now one day you Shall Perish but the one that he is making is being designed by to the measure Eternal measure perfect word God says Earnest Desiring to be clothed upon with our us that trust in God Jesus Christ in your heart you have a promise when you leave your tent it will not be a naked spirit with a glorious body Eternal in the heavens word of God says Brothers for being so being clothed we shall be not be found naked in other words when we leave this body it won't be a naked Spirit it won't be a naked Soul it will be redressed with a new garment a new shirt you're going to see like the Excellence of creation for what that are in Christ sickness of oh the spirit of cancer deteriorates it breaks down it burns the body you can p whatever you want well that it can break down the body but that body it's a it's a tent there's a hope we shall be redressed an eternal home that Brothers will not deteriorate it shall be perfect and as proof of guarantee a guarante of the promise that God has made he has given us of his holy spirit as a deposit of guarantee that what he has said shall fulfill he shall do it and I believe it don't worry for those that can destroy your body our brothers back in the back back in the time they were burned up that tent can be destroyed but your soul shall be redressed someone someone someone here desires to
