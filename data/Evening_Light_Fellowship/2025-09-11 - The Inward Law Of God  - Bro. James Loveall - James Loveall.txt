[Music] Oh day star, shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. [Music] Lord, I see a world that's dying, wounded by the master of DC.

We have one praise report turned in and one prayer request. We'll read our praise report first. This is from Sister Melody. She writes, "My son works for a call center that takes donations for different conservative causes. And one woman he talked to is a Jewish message believer who was so impressed by my son David that she gave $800 to the company. She wanted him to tell me that I raised him right and wanted to ask God's blessing for me. So thankful to hear this as my son is not where he should be spiritually. It blessed him a lot. So we thank the Lord for that." Praise report from Sister Melody. Brother Brian has noted down, please pray for sister Sarah. She really hurt her back and needs a touch from the master's hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Stephen, if you could come open our word, our service in a word of prayer. Sure. Uh, brother Steven McNeely. Yes. I'm sure many of you heard uh Charlie Kirk, Christian political figure, was murdered today. So wife and two kids. So just have that on my heart as well. If we could pray for the family. Let's bow our hearts. Father God, we have gathered here this evening, Lord, with a desire to hear from you. Lord, your prophet taught us that whatever we come with a desire or an expectation that you would come and you would fulfill that expectation. And so, Father God, I pray that by the foolishness of preaching, Lord, by the open word book, that you would come and speak to our hearts and that you would change our lives, Lord. For that's our main desire. Father, we see our country and the things that's going on around the world and Charlie Kirk and the assassination. We ask that you would bring comfort to his family, his wife, Lord, his two young children. Father God, a widow and fatherless by some silly act, Lord, &gt;&gt; by silly politics, Father. Lord, I just pray comfort and Father God, that you would just be with not only that family, but the surrounding family, the people that were there and shaken up and so on and so forth. Lord, what a tragedy. But we're here tonight, Father God. And Lord, I pray that you would be with Brother James and that you would touch him. Father, that you would inspire him and anoint him with your spirit. Father, that there would be a connection between us and him and your Holy Spirit, Lord. That your word would have an effect. Be with Brother Jonathan, father, as he leads us in worship. May we set aside, Lord, the cares of this life, the cares of this world. Whatever day we've had, Lord, may you help us to lay it aside now and to fully concentrate upon thee and to worship thee with a thankful heart. Lord, we commit our lives and our family, our church, and everything into thy hands for thy kingdom's glory. We ask these things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Why don't you shake your neighbor's hand as you're taking your seat this evening? Amen. Let's go up to B flat. Just a closer walk with thee. Amen. Just a closer walk with thee. Granted, Jesus is my plea. [Music] [Applause] daily walking closely. [Applause] Let it be. Dear Lord, let it be. Well, I am weak, but thou art strong. [Applause] [Music] Jesus, keep me from all wrong. And I'll be satisfied as long as I walk. Let me walk close to thee. [Applause] [Music] Well, just a closer walk with thee. Oh, Jesus is my plea. daily walking close to thee. Let it be, dear Lord. Let it be. Well, through this world of toilet snares. [Music] Oh, if I falter, Lord, who cares? [Music] [Applause] Oh, with thee my burden shares. None but thee, dear Lord. None but thee. Well, just a closer walk with thee. Jesus is my plea. [Music] daily walking close to thee. Let it be, dear Lord. Let it be. Well, when my feeble life is over, time for me will be no more. [Music] Guide me daily gently, safely. Oh, to thy shomom shore to thy shore. Well, just a closer walk with thee. [Music] Jesus is my plea. daily walking close to thee. Let it be, dear Lord. Let it be. Amen. Just give him a hand clap and praise this evening. Well, when we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus. will sing and shout the victory when we all get to heaven. What a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus. We'll sing and shout the victory one more time. Well, when we all get together, what day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus will sing and shout the victory. Amen. Give him another hand clap of praise this evening. Amen. And we can all stand as we get ready to change the order of the service. Let's just sing even so come Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's just been on my heart today. Just such a dark world we live in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just said Lord it's time. Just take us home Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even so come Lord Jesus come. Even so take your bride away. How my soul longs to be with you my Lord. Even so, even so. Come Lord Jesus. Come. Lord, you are the lover of my soul. [Music] Lord, you are exalted over all [Music] and I bow before your throne to worship you, oh Lord. Lord, you are Lord, you are the lover of my soul. Even so, once again, even so, come Lord Jesus, come. If that's your desire, just lift your hand this evening. Oh, even so, take your bride away. Oh, how my soul longs to be with you, my Lord. Even so, even so. Come Lord Jesus, come. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could pull out the word, speak to the mountains. Amen. As brother James gets ready to come preach. Amen. I'm sure many of you know this song, but let's just worship the Lord this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would I worry when giants come calling my name? Oh my God is so much bigger than troubles I face. Can you say amen to that? Oh, why would I hunger for power, riches, or fame? Oh my God is so much better than all of these things. So I won't be shen. I won't be moved. My God is faithful. [Music] His promise is true. So I speak to the mountain. [Music] It's time to move. My God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. Amen. Oh, my enemies scatter cuz they know the battle is done. Victory's already won. Oh, my God is stronger. The victory already won. [Music] Yeah. He died for my ransom and rose up on the third day. Oh my God is stronger than death. Hell and the grave. Oh, I won't be sh. Oh, I won't be moved. My God is faithful. [Music] His promise is true. Speak to the mountain. So I'll speak to the mountain. It's time to move. For my God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. There's no mountain to high, no valley to low. There's no fear that I have. He doesn't already know. There's no problem to fix. There's no weapon too strong. There is nothing for God that's impossible. There's no mountain to high, no valley to go. There's no fear that I have. He doesn't already know. There's no problem to make. There's no weapon too strong. There is nothing for God that's impossible. [Music] Oh, I won't be shen. Oh, I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His promise is true. So I speak to the mountain. Oh, it's time to move. My God is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise this evening. [Music] He's bigger. He's stronger. He's better. &gt;&gt; He's greater than any trial that we'll ever go through, any valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our God is faithful. &gt;&gt; Our God is faithful. Somebody say, "Faithful." &gt;&gt; Faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's an everpresent help in the time of need. He said, "My arm is not too sure." [Music] &gt;&gt; We have not because we ask not. &gt;&gt; Take God at his word and see what he'll do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I believe that if you make time for God, God will make time for you. &gt;&gt; You begin to ask, &gt;&gt; you begin to seek, &gt;&gt; let me tell you something, you will find him. &gt;&gt; You begin to knock and the door will be open. things will begin to happen in your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, it might not happen how you think it will. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we ask God for an answer. &gt;&gt; And we ask and we ask and he doesn't give it right away, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But sometimes we just need to change our approach and say, "God, &gt;&gt; just send a little word. &gt;&gt; Send a song by my way. send some word of encouragement to let let me know that you're with me. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads before him if you have a need. &gt;&gt; Lord, how thankful we are for this opportunity once again to be gathered in your house, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, not taking for granted this opportunity, Lord. Lord, this world is falling apart and people are doing things that are insane and assassinations and things for what they believe in and what they stand for. revelation and understanding. And Father, we have gathered on this Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; Lord, would you come and just walk with us, Lord, &gt;&gt; as you did in the beginning with Adam and Eve in the cool of the evening, Father, and Lord, the word would go forth and that it would bring forth life. &gt;&gt; It would bring a freedom. It would bring a liberty. Oh God, have your way in this service. Lord, &gt;&gt; oh Lord, &gt;&gt; we thank you for this opportunity. We thank you for this word. We thank you for a prophet in this day. Oh God, &gt;&gt; we thank you for revelation and Isa to see. Lord, we just ask now and Lord, we set ourselves aside once again. &gt;&gt; Lord, we humble ourselves in your presence. Lord, &gt;&gt; have your way. Speak to your children &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, &gt;&gt; let's turn to Romans 7. Romans 7 and verse 12. And we're going to kind of skip through a few scriptures here just to save time and highlight a few here. Amen. Romans 7 and verse 12 says, "Wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good." And verse 18, "For I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would, I do not. But the evil which I would not that I do. Now if I do that I would not. It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. &gt;&gt; I find then a law that when I do good, evil is present with me. &gt;&gt; For I delight in the law of God after the inward man. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I see another law in my members, waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is my members. Oh wretched man that I am. Who shall deliver me from this body, the body of this death? Let's turn to Zechariah chapter 7 back between Habacook and Malachi. Zachchariah 7 and verse 8. And the word of the Lord came unto Zachchariah, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother, and oppress not the widows, nor the fathers, the strangers, nor the poor, and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in his heart. Now, I want to stop there because it was just something special that as I begin to study and this thought was placed upon my heart and I believe that God speak to us in ways that it can be in devotion, it can be driving down the the road in a song, it can come by some way. &gt;&gt; And as I begin to look into this subject here and this this scripture, it was just in a morning devotion. I just opened my Bible and this is where it came to. And it was something so special because if you read the first verse of this chapter, it would begin to say in the fourth law of the reign of this, but on the fourth day of the ninth month and whenever I looked and I seen it was that day of September and you begin to look at certain things that God speaks to you. But I see here that the Lord begins to say, "Execute true judgment. Show mercy and compassion every man to his brother." And as a minister and ones that get behind the pulpit, you want to that's what you want to do. You want to preach the gospel, but you want to show true judgment and you want to have mercy and compassion and you want to preach it in such a way and you want to show grace, but yet there is a law to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen what happens here that when the people if they don't listen &gt;&gt; in verse 11 it says but they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear. Yay they made their hearts as anam stone lest they should hear the law and the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by former prophets. Therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hosts. You see what happens whenever you disobey and you put away the laws of God. You don't hearken to the voices of the prophets. &gt;&gt; There comes something from God. And I and I begin to understand and as I was even praying that that morning that no matter who's preaching, no matter the prophets that speak, &gt;&gt; no matter what words are being spoken or prophesied, there is a people that will not hearken unto the words. &gt;&gt; It's happened in every age. There's been an age that, you know, every age the word goes forth and there's been a people that won't hearken to the voice of God, that will turn away after their own lust, that won't do the laws that God has commanded them to do. &gt;&gt; But I also believe and I read not only in my Bible, but this day, there is a group of people that will hearken to the voice, that will obey the voices of the prophet. Can you say, "I'm going to be obedient to the word of God. I'm going to hearken to the prophet's voices. &gt;&gt; We want to execute true judgment, show mercy, and have compassion. You can be seated this evening. And the subject we'd like to take here is the law, the inward law of God. The inward law of God. And you know, it was something that brother Ron began to touch on this here on communion if you were here that he began to talk about Paul, the chiefest of sinners, that he said, "I find a law within my members." &gt;&gt; But there was a law that we can delight in, and it was a law after the inward man. &gt;&gt; And this law after the inward man is not based upon the flesh. It's not based upon the spirit realms. Why? Because the spirit realm and the in the flesh realm is based upon senses and it has emotions and conditions attached to it. And you can be swayed one way or the other, but there's an inward man that we can delight in &gt;&gt; that it's steady. It's consistent. It's true to God's word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are laws of God that are given to man that we we must abide by. And there are laws given by man which are given to other men that we abide by in this day. &gt;&gt; Is it not so that whenever you come and you get in your car, you got to abide by the speed limit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to drive according to the laws. You got to drive according to the traffic lights. If there's a stop sign, you got to stop. &gt;&gt; You're abiding by the law. &gt;&gt; Most of us were law law-abiding citizens. We do our best. And then there's some that the speed limit is just a suggestion. &gt;&gt; It's a recommended uh uh speed to go and you live and you push the law and you live in the boundary and the grace of a officer, &gt;&gt; right? Meaning that if you drive, we could say 10 miles over. And what if he was to pull you over and it the speed limit was 75 and you're going 80 and he pulled you over and he said, "I'm pulling you over for speeding." And you would say, "Well, I thought there was a 10 mph grace period, but it's based upon what he wants to give you." &gt;&gt; But now you're living without the boundaries of the law. And when you begin to live outside the boundaries of the laws and the things that God has given us, there could be problems. &gt;&gt; It's true, brother. &gt;&gt; You know, naturally, when you train a young man to drive and you get a you get into the car and you begin to teach them and they're not very comfortable behind the wheel, what do they begin to do? They they abide by all the laws. 10 and two, drive at a certain speed, use the blinker, stop so many seconds at a stoplight or stop sign. You do all these things. Why? Because you it's unfamiliar, but you're learning the the reigns of the laws, you know, but then the more you drive and the more comfortable you get, what do you do? You begin to push the law. &gt;&gt; You begin to speed a little bit. You begin to do a little California stop, maybe look both ways. Oh, we're all guilty of it. &gt;&gt; Come on now. I know we've all had nature changes, but &gt;&gt; the flesh man is still there. &gt;&gt; But you see that Satan also has laws. &gt;&gt; Satan has laws that he begins to input into society. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And these laws are not laws that he could create on his own because we know that he is not a creator. &gt;&gt; He could not come up with a law and say this is what you're going to do. But what does he do? He begins to pervert laws &gt;&gt; that God had and he begins to pervert these laws into ways that would would glorify him or ways that he would be able to utilize these laws. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you can take the human race from the very beginning &gt;&gt; and God had laws and you mean man and woman, but what does Satan come and do? He begins to come and he begins to pervert that law. &gt;&gt; He begins to say that you can have a same-sex marriage and you by science you can change your sexuality and you can do all these things. What is he doing? He's perverting the very laws that God has given us. And if he can't pervert the law, what does he do? &gt;&gt; He changes the law. &gt;&gt; Have you noticed that over time laws begin to change? &gt;&gt; And I'll just say this that God creates laws even for nature and nature for all these thousands of years and they've never had to change. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why is it when God created in the beginning and he spoke the whole world and he said all these things will bring forth after their own kind. &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell a tree to bring forth a fruit. &gt;&gt; That tree is going to bring forth whatever's inside of it. &gt;&gt; It's the law of God. Whatever you plant, you're going to reap. Whatever you sew, that's what you're going to reap. It's a law of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so these things in nature, you don't have to tell an animal when it comes to the time to breeding or that that time of of during the rut, you deer hunters and it's this time of rut. You don't have to tell the the male deer, okay, now is the season that you have to go for the females. No, it's something in its nature. &gt;&gt; It's a law of God that he put inside that deer. &gt;&gt; He even told the animals to multiply and replenish the earth. He told him, &gt;&gt; "Make them after your own kind." &gt;&gt; And so we see that these laws are in effect, but yet Satan comes and what does he do? He begins to pervert the law. And if you can't pervert it, he changes the law. &gt;&gt; Now you can marry a uh you have the same-sex marriages. You can marry an animal if you want. &gt;&gt; Back then you would never even think of it. It was never even in a law book. &gt;&gt; You could never comprehend what that is. But now we're living in such a dark time &gt;&gt; that now he's got to create laws. As time goes on, he's perverting these laws. And if the laws don't make way, he's going to make way for those laws to come to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was even reading this thing on that guy that he had shot those the the the mass murderer, the one that killed those couple of kids while they were praying. And he he was a transgender and he was whatever you would call it, but his partner was a furry who wanted to be an animal. And you see all this perversion and in his manifest or whatever they call it at the end of his life they had said they had read that he wish he would have never done it. He wish he wouldn't have never changed. He wish he would have listened. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not a law of God. It's not natural for men to think like that and do those things and live that way. &gt;&gt; But what Satan does is he'll take you farther than you want to go. He wants to He will start with a little this and a little that and it says, "Oh, it's not too bad." &gt;&gt; It starts with one word. &gt;&gt; It starts with one thought. It starts with one little thing. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And look where they end up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says in the fundamental foundation for faith. He says, "Now Satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death bought operate." He says, "And Satan sends a cancer and the man recognizes it and receives it." Satan sends heartache. We recognize it and receive it. &gt;&gt; Let me stop there. You don't have to receive it. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the doctor said. I don't care what has been given to you. You don't have to receive what Satan has sent you &gt;&gt; because that's not a law of God. No. &gt;&gt; And if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man, how much more ought God with his power make his laws work in man? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If Satan can make his laws be sure and us recognize it. &gt;&gt; Listen, in us recognize it. Too many times we're recognizing the laws of Satan. &gt;&gt; We're putting too too much emphasis on the things of Satan, &gt;&gt; all these laws, and we get distracted. But listen what he says. If we can recognize what Satan's doing, how much more ought God through his children to make his laws be recognized amongst his people? A divine healing and revelation and power and gifts and manifestations of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those are the laws that we should be recognizing. Those are the things that should attract our attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you see, there is a reality to this message. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a reality to this message. It's just not a hope so or a theory or or Bible stud studies or stories that we read long ago. That's not what this message is about. &gt;&gt; It's so much more than law and letter of the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And dos and don'ts and regulations. There's so much more to this message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's a life that can be lived behind the Christian life. &gt;&gt; It's not if you do these laws or you do you live this way or you obey your parents this way or you be obedient in such a way and it becomes a cookie cutter religion. Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; It's not if you say these prayers or or or give this much or be this person. No, that's a religion. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this evening, you're not bound by a religion. &gt;&gt; You're not You're not here because of a religion. But you're here because of a love affair, of a relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's because I'm in love with him is why I do the things that I do. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I go to church. That's why I serve God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's because I'm in love with him. Brother Brandham says, "I don't do this in fear that he would send me to hell. That's not why I do this. I serve him because I love him. &gt;&gt; It's just like me and my wife. I love her. I don't want to hurt her. I don't want to harm her. &gt;&gt; She doesn't have to worry about it. &gt;&gt; We just celebrated seven wonderful years. Has there been ups? Has there been downs?" Absolutely. But when you're in love with somebody, it doesn't matter what comes, what goes, &gt;&gt; you're in love. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's because the you have a love with Jesus Christ. Let me ask you this question that if this was all that life was cracked up to be, if there was no afterlife, it wasn't based on anything after this, if it was yolo, as the kids would say, you only live once and this is all that it has, would you still serve God? &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you still serve God? Would you still come to church and be faithful and do all these things and live the way that you are? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because let me put it this way. Because if there's a desire or or a wondering if am I missing out on this or that or I wish I could be this way or I can do those things and I can go to those parties or I can enjoy the the the the things of life, &gt;&gt; something's wrong. &gt;&gt; You're not fully in love with him. &gt;&gt; Because my love isn't based on what he's done for me, saints. It's not based on what he's done for me. I know what it's like to be a sinner. I know what it's like to be lost and to be full of mistakes and failures. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says while we were yet sinners, &gt;&gt; Christ died for us. &gt;&gt; His love for me goes far back before I was even a sinner. Whenever I was out in the world and I was doing the things of the world, &gt;&gt; his love for me, it wasn't like I Well, I hope he comes around. &gt;&gt; Well, I hope he falls in love with me. Let me tell you, and I'll get ahead of myself. He put a law inside of you. &gt;&gt; He put something inside of that, but you couldn't help fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You couldn't help but fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; You see, and so it is naturally that you don't fall in love with somebody because of what they have to offer you. &gt;&gt; Don't do it, girls. Don't fall in love with somebody because this man has money or he can offer you things or he can give you this and he I can give you that. I can give you a car and I can build you a house. Will you marry me? &gt;&gt; Don't do it off of what he can offer you. &gt;&gt; Because what happens if those things draw up? &gt;&gt; If you base it on materialistic things and it's not based around genuine love, it'll fall apart. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how do I how do I know?" You can ask all the millionaires. You can ask the billionaires. You can ask all these ones that have come into money. You watch them. They grow up humble beginnings, start things in their garage. And what happens once they make the money, what happens? Their marriages fall apart. &gt;&gt; What kind of love did they have? &gt;&gt; So, don't do it. Somebody tells you based on materialistic things, I can offer you this. I can give you that. That's not what love is about. &gt;&gt; That's not why you fell in love with Christ. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It's a sobering thought. What if God never did anything again for you? &gt;&gt; He's done so much for me already. &gt;&gt; We are a blessed people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have so much to be thankful for. I serve him because it's a love affair. &gt;&gt; That's why I come to church and I do those things. Brother Brandham says and I and I was just listening to this quote today and he says, "And when men and women get to a place and say, "Well, I really ought to stay home and see this good old play tonight." But I tell you, they'll think I'm backslid if I don't go down at church. &gt;&gt; And you sit there and sleep anyhow. You might as well have stayed home and looked at some something you'd enjoy more. &gt;&gt; He says, "You should have just stayed home &gt;&gt; and watched something you had enjoyed more." And something pricricked in my heart and was wondering is that the reason that Wednesday nights are not as packed is because they find things that they enjoy more &gt;&gt; that they enjoy more doing. And I understand that you can push it so hard and this is where the fine line is that there's people that that can't make it on a Wednesday night. There's ones that it makes a sacrifice. And I'm not preaching at you because you're here tonight. But yet you see the prophet said, "I wonder if they why not just stay home and do those things that you enjoy more?" &gt;&gt; It's very humbling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then he goes on to say, "But when your joy becomes the Lord and the Lord is your joy, you can't wait. You can't stay away from church." &gt;&gt; Then we're getting somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when we're getting somewhere, saints, &gt;&gt; is when your joy becomes the Lord and the Lord becomes your joy. Listen, it don't matter if you come to church or you stay home. You say, "You're putting too much emphasis on church." Well, my joy is the Lord and I am the Lord. So everywhere I go, I'm I'm happy. I'm joyful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's what the attraction is. That's what pulls us to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, science would say and they would come up with this uh uh title of the law of attraction. And it says it is a belief that positive thoughts and emotions and actions attract positive experiences and outcomes while negative ones attract negative results. &gt;&gt; You ever been around a positive person? You ever talk around a positive person? Maybe it's a good positive Christian. You're around them. They're always uplifting you. They always make you the better person. They always make you that like your problem is not so bad. &gt;&gt; And they encourage you in the Lord and they uplift you. Why? Because there's a positivity around them. &gt;&gt; There's something that attracts you to that person. Those are the kind of friends that we need. Those are the ones that you need to get yourself around. If you find yourself finding the negative in everything and you come to church and you're negative and you go to this and you're negative and everything's negative and your whole world is falling apart, change your friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Change your law of attraction because there should be an attraction when you come to church because when God does something, there is an attraction. &gt;&gt; God always causes an attraction. Yes. &gt;&gt; One common framework involves the principle listen of the law of attraction. One common framework involves the principle of ask, believe and receive to manifest your desires. Now if science can get a hold of it and just general thinking of man ask believe and receive how much more as we and sons and daughters of God that it's so much more than just a law of attraction of some happy positive thinking &gt;&gt; but there's an attraction to God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that attracts and draws us. And it should pull us into an atmosphere that we should be better Christians and more positive and and more friendly and more brotherly love and more grace and more mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a law of attraction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God does something in the scripture, you can look it back that when he does something in the scripture, there's always an attraction. There's always something that happens and there's always a group of people &gt;&gt; that when this traction happens, they know that it's coming. Why? Because they're looking for the attraction. &gt;&gt; Because there's a people on the earth that hear the word, whether it be through a prophet, and something happens and the manifestation is coming to pass and they say, "Oh, this is what the prophets told us would happen." &gt;&gt; But I heard the prophet say today, "But it's a It's a minority people. It's a small group that begins to know when those things are going to happen to recognize that when God does something in scripture, they say, "Oh, this is what the prophet spoke about." &gt;&gt; But let me say this, the attraction ob also pulls everybody else in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God does something, it pulls all the critics in. It pulls all the haters in. It pulls all the skeptics. And everybody gets attracted to what is happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, don't be discouraged this evening. If you've come across somebody or something, don't be discouraged by those because there's an attraction to this message. There's an attraction. There's something that has happened in this day. A prophet has came and spoke. &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by those naysayers. &gt;&gt; You can take it back to the Mount Carmel showdown. There was an attraction. &gt;&gt; Let whose God is God? Let him rain down fire. &gt;&gt; What did it do? It caused all the people, all the other prophets, everybody to come &gt;&gt; to see whose God is God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; When God came on the full of an ass and brother Brandham says the small people when he be to come down, there was a small group saying hosana, hosana. Why? because they knew he was coming and this was the manifestation of that word. &gt;&gt; But then it brought a bunch of attraction. It brought everybody. &gt;&gt; It brought the unbelievers. It brought the makeelievers. It brought the ones that were just coming to look and see. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; What is the attraction? God always causes an attraction. What is the attraction tonight? Why have you gathered? Why have you gathered on the Wednesday night? It's not to just come and play church thing. &gt;&gt; That's not the attraction. It hasn't come to hear some good music and hear a man preach. That's not that. &gt;&gt; What is it? to hear the word of God &gt;&gt; that it would come forth and it would change our lives and that it would minister that we would go from this place a better Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the attraction. The attraction isn't some man or you know we can go that the attraction is Jesus Christ. Can I put it back? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the attraction of the hour. So we can take it back that this law just isn't built on just a hopes and a will and a positive thinking. But this attraction, we can take it back to his word. &gt;&gt; And if this law of attraction takes us back to his word, there's got to be something positive to come out of it. &gt;&gt; You see, when you're attracted to something, you're focused on it. &gt;&gt; You're focused. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you begin become attracted to a young brother or a young sister, you're attracted to them. You begin to focus on them. You begin to watch them. You want to be with them, talk with them. Why? Because you're focused. &gt;&gt; Stay focused, saints. &gt;&gt; Stay focused on the word of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't get distracted by Satan's laws and things that he wants to put in our way and be become so easily distracted by &gt;&gt; in Romans 7 and 1 it says know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth. So this law hath dominion over a man. But if we take it back to Genesis, we know that this law was put in place because in the beginning, God when he began to create and he created all of nature and he put all these laws in place and you can read in the first chapter that he put all of nature in order and he put them to abide by these laws. And Adam dwelt there in the in the Garden of Eden. He didn't need a book of commandments. He didn't need a law book of dos and don'ts and don't do this and don't do that. No. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was in harmony with almighty God. &gt;&gt; Because they were all under the Holy Spirit, operating as one. &gt;&gt; They were all operating under the spoken word in the beginning. And so when God, the reason I can say that they were operating all as one is because Adam, when God told Adam to name the animals, he didn't have to tell him what to name. He just named them. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to tell Adam go do this and do that. No, he didn't. Why? Because he was operating under the law that was inside of him. And this law didn't have dominion over man, but man had dominion over the law &gt;&gt; because there was no fall. &gt;&gt; But then there would come a time on the seventh day that God would begin to create and he said that God is not good that man would dwelt alone. So what did he do? He created a help meat for him. And right before that, he says, "Adam, here's one law you got to abide by. Don't eat of the tree of knowledge." &gt;&gt; It's kind of amazing when you think how could man, now we know that it's the great plan of God, but humanly how could man mess it up if he's given one law. Doesn't it seem so simple? &gt;&gt; Just don't do this one thing. &gt;&gt; Everything you can eat freely of everything else you can do. &gt;&gt; Everything you can do. I have given you the whole world. Just don't do this one thing. &gt;&gt; And yet man &gt;&gt; and God's forn knowledge we know &gt;&gt; but would mess it up. And so Paul takes us back to the very law here and and we're going to continue reading the scripture and he takes us back on how important this law is. Because let me say this, somebody that is in love doesn't break the law in this manner. You can take it down real quick. Because somebody that's in love, they don't just easily break this this law. When you're in love with somebody, it just doesn't happen. &gt;&gt; When Satan in the in the beginning, it just didn't happen suddenly. &gt;&gt; When somebody's in love and they have a a life partner, there's something that has to happen over time. And what does it do? It draws their love away from who they're with. It begins to lose their focus on the person that they're with. She began to lose her focus and begin to lose her attraction. Let's go to verse two. For the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. But if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then, if while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if her husband be dead, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to a man another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye are come dead to the law by the body of Jesus Christ. Ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that ye should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. You see, that's why you have to be born again. That's why you have to have a new birth. That's why you have to have a change. Nicodemus said, "Do should I go into my mother's womb?" No. &gt;&gt; But why do we have to have a death to oursel? Because Christ can't have a relationship with you if your first husband, if the first one, your first lover is still alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; God would not go against his laws. &gt;&gt; But now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we are held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter. I think that's so beautiful that we should live in the newness of the of the spirit and not in the oldness of the letter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not sinned, but law but by law, for I had not known, lest except the law hath said, thou shalt not covet. &gt;&gt; So we see here that law coming brings a revelation and understanding of what is sin. &gt;&gt; That's what revelation does. &gt;&gt; It begins to take things out of our lives. That whenever God brings it across our paths, what happens? Revelation comes and it pricks our heart and we take that sin out of our life and we come to the house of God and we hear the preaching of the word and as it goes forth it begins to wash us. Why? Because we are being purged and we're being washed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see the law of the inward man and the newness of the spirit revelation exposes the sin in our life. Brother Brandham says in church uh the church choosing law for grace and he says if you could do one thing to save yourself then there's not one speck of grace in it. &gt;&gt; If you could save yourself that's why you can't tighten down the law so hard that you can't there's no grace &gt;&gt; because it takes Calvary out of the whole picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. But law, listen, law is what you do in regards to the grace that God has shown you by saving you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Law is what you do in regards to the grace. What are you doing with the law that God has given you? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What are you doing with the law that God has given you? Because we see that as as time was that God was in the beginning and at the end and here God was but there was a a hickey in time or a valley in time as it would. And brother Brandham says everything that was born in that was born under sin and death. Everything was born under the law. So if you're born under a law and within this time you have this this thing and it comes across and there's a little hickey in a chasm and everything that was born within it was pulled into the law of gravity &gt;&gt; was pulled into the law of gravity and it would fall. So now everything born under that all of us come into the world born in sin shaped in iniquity &gt;&gt; come into the world speaking lies. So we start out born in God's mind but when we're born we fall &gt;&gt; and every time we fall what is it? It's a law. &gt;&gt; There's no man born perfect. &gt;&gt; There's no man born righteous. There's no man born just. &gt;&gt; Because whenever you're born, you're born here on the mind of God. God was eternal, but when you're born, you fall. &gt;&gt; So, there had to be something that was greater than the law that would begin to as the fall would happen, you would be able to be caught by the law. &gt;&gt; It was greater than the law. Right. &gt;&gt; And John says, first John, it says, "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." You see, he was the law made flesh. He began to do things that that were according to the law. It shouldn't be done. He began to do things that would defy the law. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To a normal man, how could a man walk on water? &gt;&gt; Who is this man? &gt;&gt; Who is this man that could speak to the storm and the waves and the seas obeyed him? &gt;&gt; In this time and in this fall, it had to be something that would defy the law of gravity. and God would begin to come and the word made flesh. Now the law being made flesh and in the book of Isaiah, what does it say? And Jesus came to the scroll and he found where is written of him. What was it? It was the law coming to the law. And what did the law recognize within the scripture? He was no longer the law. The law was coming to the law, but he was the made flesh. And what did he come to realize? &gt;&gt; He was the grace sent to the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He was the grace sent to the law. &gt;&gt; Because in Luke 4, he says, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captive, the recovering of the sight to the blind, to set liberty them that are bruised, &gt;&gt; and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book, &gt;&gt; and he went and sat down, and they were all confound. &gt;&gt; The law was coming to the written law. &gt;&gt; What was it? He was grace to that law. &gt;&gt; He was mercy. He was deliverance. He was healing. &gt;&gt; He was virtue. &gt;&gt; He was everything that we had needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That us as mankind, there's nothing that we can do within ourselves to restore us back to the original. So God had to send his only begotten son that whenever the fall would happen, something greater than the law that would defy the law of gravity would come and catch it in the middle and restore it back to the original. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is this story all about? What is the Bible all about? It's about a love story about redemption. God bringing his people back to the beginning, back to the very mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. back to the very harmony of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; God was manifesting outwardly the very law that God had put in him in the restoration of the bride tree. He says God set all his laws to serve him, both natural and spiritual, working according to his word, regardless of the condition. I love that. He says, "I had a scripture here on that." Yes. God sets all of his laws in motion. Think of it. Let it soak in. He said, "God set all of his laws in motion that it must work according to his own word." &gt;&gt; Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; He says his word, his laws has to work according to his word. He commanded the sun. He commanded the moon. He commanded the earth. He commanded nature. And they all fall right in line. &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the laws work in harmony with God's spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just his word, but it's spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the law of life that is in us &gt;&gt; will bring us to a resurrection. &gt;&gt; It's got to. It's impossible. It's impossible, saints, for it not to. God has put a law inside of you that it's got to bring you to that resurrection. It's got to bring you to that restoration. How do I know? Because the law is inside of me. &gt;&gt; And if the law is inside of me and it's inside of you, then you will be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do I know the rapture is going to happen? When do I know it's going to take place? It don't matter because I know that there's a law inside of me that whenever it happens, I'm going to be going. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the law I'm depending on. &gt;&gt; It's impossible for it not to. &gt;&gt; You see, right now, you're being restored by that which is already in you. &gt;&gt; You don't need anything added more to you. &gt;&gt; You don't need any more laws and things. God had put inside of you a law and that law is going to take you to your final destination. All you got to do is sit in his presence and abide by those laws and those guidance and that guidance is the Holy Spirit in your life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The law within nature, the scripture says, is groaning and yearning for what? the manifestations &gt;&gt; of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That they are operating in this realm of a fallen earth. &gt;&gt; They're just operating yet they're still in their cycle under their laws, but they are waiting for us to go back &gt;&gt; to the original, back to the harmony of almighty God. Brother Brandham says again in the restoration of the bride tree, he says, you know, a a fish has a law, and that fish can stand up here in water, and he has a law within him. If he'll just let go of that law that's in him, he can sink plum to the bottom of the sea. Won't bother him a bit, won't break one cell. You try to do it. That law is not in you. Let me say this. Too many times we're trying to do things that the law isn't in you. &gt;&gt; Why don't you fit in? Why can't you do those things out there? Because that law of sin and death is not inside of you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That law is not in you. &gt;&gt; You can't do it. But that fish can. He deflates himself with that air in such a way that he can. There's nothing in him to burst open. He's made that way. He knows it. And he can enforce that law to take them plum to the bottom of the sea, then raise them back up again. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If a fishing, a little fish can identify what law is inside of him, &gt;&gt; if a fish can identify that if I do this law that God placed inside of me, how much more should sons and daughters of the living God be able to identify the law that's inside of them? How much more he says that there was a law in Christ. That law is in men. You can bury him in the deepest grave or in the deepest sea or the lowest hell. There's a law and the spirit of God that will raise him up again. &gt;&gt; So it don't matter where you bury me. It don't matter where you're at in the world. That's why he says, "I have called a people from every kindred, tongue, and nation." Because it doesn't matter where you're at, geographically. It don't matter where you're at. If there's that law of God, he's going to raise you up. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That law has to bring forth. He says, "And a bird has a law and it's a body and its body is material. It's earthbound, sets on the earth here, but it has a law within it that the way it spreads its wings, it can plum fly out of sight." That's against science. &gt;&gt; They claim it's earthbound. Gravitation has a hold on it here, but it can defy gravitation. &gt;&gt; Lift itself off up right off of it &gt;&gt; and right on out because it has to put that law that's in it to work. &gt;&gt; It's built to possess that law. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's materialistic. All these laws are put in place and science can say how is that possible &gt;&gt; that an animal can do all these things and it can just get up and fly away. &gt;&gt; What is it doing is defying gravity sir? &gt;&gt; What are you doing this evening? &gt;&gt; You're a natural creature. You're made of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; But yet there's something inside of you that one day you are going to defy gravity. that just as gravity has a pull on you and every day you wake up and you got to die to this flesh and you got to die and you got to die. &gt;&gt; Why? Because this gravitational law of sin and death is within us. It don't matter how rich or or how great you are or how well you eat and take care of this body, you are going to die. Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet there's a law within you that when gravitation begins to take place, let me tell you, I hope I'm here when the the rapture of the bride comes because let me tell you, there's going to be ones that when God comes and is going to defy all gravitation, all natural laws that when law comes and tries to hold you, something else is going to come and take you out of here. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You didn't do anything to earn it. You didn't do anything to discern them. &gt;&gt; But that law was put in you before the foundation of the world. You were predestinated with this law inside of you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That law, he puts that law in it to work. He's built to possess the law. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this evening, you're built to possess the law. &gt;&gt; You're built to defy the laws that Satan has against you. Too many times you're focusing, as we read in that quote, too many times you're focusing on the laws of Satan. &gt;&gt; Stop being so negative. &gt;&gt; Stop looking to the positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Start defying all those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's our inheritance to possess the land. Sir, let me ask you. We're talking about animals. It came to me, what makes a lion the king of the jungle? &gt;&gt; What makes him? What in him? &gt;&gt; Who told him he was the king? Who told him? &gt;&gt; He's not the biggest. &gt;&gt; He's not the tallest. He's not the fastest. &gt;&gt; He's against all odds. But what told him inside him? You are the king. And if you've ever heard a lion roar, let me tell you, everybody listens. It gets your attraction. We were at the zoo the other day and it began to just puff out. &gt;&gt; You can hear that thing all the way across. It's true. &gt;&gt; All the way across sends chills down your back. But who told him? &gt;&gt; Nobody. &gt;&gt; There's a law inside him. &gt;&gt; There's a law that God put inside of him that said, "You're the king. &gt;&gt; You're the one that rules. &gt;&gt; He's put that law inside of you. &gt;&gt; He's put that law inside of you. &gt;&gt; You might not be the biggest. &gt;&gt; You might not be the fastest. You might not be able to sing. You might not be able to do nothing. &gt;&gt; But God has put a law inside of you. &gt;&gt; He has put a law inside of you. Why? Because he loves you &gt;&gt; and he chose you and he called you. &gt;&gt; It's not my choosing. It's not your choosing. But God chose you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me finish this quote. He says now, he says, "Now I'm feeling be uh feel religious." He says, "Now we have a law. The law of life is in us." He says, "Only thing you have to do, you were made and born and placed here in the body of Christ as sons and daughters of God." &gt;&gt; You were made, born and placed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, what did you have to do with it? Right. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; You don't have to knuckle down to the devil. We've got a law and that's the law of the Holy Spirit. The only thing you have to do is to know how to let go and let God. Let go and let God. Let go and let God. But yet, that's the hardest thing is to let go and let God have his sovereign way. He says, "You keep fighting at it and it won't never seem to work when you let go and let God." That's all &gt;&gt; is to know that the law of life is in you. &gt;&gt; You just have to let go and let God. Then he takes your healing. He takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything else that's he's promised. any claim that he's given is yours by letting go and letting God. You say, "Brother James, I don't know how my son and daughters are going to be saved. I don't know how loved ones are going to come in." I don't know either. But I know that if we learn to let go and let God have his way. His ways are above our ways. His thoughts are above our thoughts. &gt;&gt; He's going to work it out. &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. &gt;&gt; Just let go and let God. Sometimes it seems too easy to let go and just let God. We try to control it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We try to figure it out. But let the law that is in you. Listen. Let the law that is in you pull you into that manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the law of the rapture, let the law of all the promises pull you into those promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the law of the Holy Spirit inside you that's doing the work. &gt;&gt; Musicians come again. He says, "But the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that he unrightly deceitfully taken from God." Souls of men he took from God. souls of women, children, sickness of the body, he placed upon the people where God made them in his image to be like him. And the church is given the rightful legal right by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and force this upon him. &gt;&gt; It's a law inside of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in Romans 8:2, he says, "For the law of the spirit of life is Christ Jesus and has made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, that is was weak through the flesh. God sending his own son in the likeness of a sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh. &gt;&gt; That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in who? &gt;&gt; That the righteousness of God of the law might be fulfilled in you. &gt;&gt; Who walk not after the flesh &gt;&gt; but after &gt;&gt; the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you begin to walk after the spirit, &gt;&gt; you see, we're getting into uncertain times, &gt;&gt; dark times. &gt;&gt; It proves today that men will give their life &gt;&gt; for what they believe. the persecution of Christians. &gt;&gt; If you don't think it's here, &gt;&gt; Satan is going to enforce his laws so much. &gt;&gt; He's going to make it hard. &gt;&gt; He's going to try to take rights away and things away. But don't worry &gt;&gt; because there's a law. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's greater than anything that he can send our way. &gt;&gt; We don't have anything to do with it. &gt;&gt; But let go and let God &gt;&gt; have his way. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. [Applause] I have this scripture James 2 and8. [Music] &gt;&gt; If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if ye have respects a person, you commit sin and are condemned of the law as transgressors. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, yet offend in one point, he is guilty of them all. &gt;&gt; The royal law. &gt;&gt; Galatians says, "Bury one another burdens." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so fulfill &gt;&gt; the law of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's Christianity, saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't got to tell you these things because the law inside of you will do those things. &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? &gt;&gt; That the law inside of you will love your brother. &gt;&gt; He'll bear one another's burdens. &gt;&gt; He'll help a brother in need. He'll encourage a brother. He'll uplift a brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say, Lord, help us to do better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us to be ones that we're not afraid to reach out and &gt;&gt; to ask a brother how he's doing. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Do the royal law of God. &gt;&gt; Love thy neighbor as thyself. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song. it all in control. He's got it all in control.

So every road I walk down, I'm sure it's in his plans. &gt;&gt; I've put my life in control. [Music] He's got it all in control. [Applause] He's got it all in control. He's put that reassur way down in my soul. [Music] He's got it all. &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. &gt;&gt; Lord, how grateful and thankful we are, Lord, for another opportunity, Lord. Your word is true, Lord. It's not based upon what we can do within ourselves, oh God. [Music] But we delight this evening in the in the law after the inward man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The law that you put inside of each one of us before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And Lord, though darkness comes upon the earth and it seems like there's no light, but Father, you're guiding us. You're watching over us. You're protecting us, oh God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as long as we have the law within us, you're going to bring us &gt;&gt; to the resurrection. &gt;&gt; You're going to re bring us to that rapture. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we are a part of you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we're so thankful that you chose us, &gt;&gt; that you called us. And now, Father, as we go our separate ways, I I pray a special blessing upon your people. Father, that you would bless them, that you would uplift them, that you would encourage them. Lord, I know they're going through trials and they have sicknesses within their body. But Father, we don't have to accept those laws and those things that sicknesses and cancer that Satan tries to throw at us, oh God. &gt;&gt; But let us take the law of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And take you at your word, oh God. &gt;&gt; We just commit this service into your hands. bless your people &gt;&gt; and bring us again on Sunday with an expectation in our heart, oh God, that we're prayed up and we're ready and we're ready to hear your word. &gt;&gt; Father, grant it. We ask it in Jesus precious name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, brother. &gt;&gt; Sing I surrender as we leave. Amen. I surrender. [Music] I surrender. Lord, I surrender my life.
