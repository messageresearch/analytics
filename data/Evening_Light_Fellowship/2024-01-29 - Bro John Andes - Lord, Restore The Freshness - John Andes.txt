that Enoch did no great Miracles you know what what he did B he walked with God Amen he walked with God and His Revelation became so clear so real that one day he steps into a revelation and that realm envelops him and his feet never touched the ground he walked right on into the that other dimension father this morning would you come as we humble our hearts before you and we can't do it

just want to love you more and more to amen amen isn't that desires of our heart today my how these songs have expressed the hearts can we just pray right now and ask the Lord to continue our dear heavenly father we just surrender in this atmosphere we want to invite the the supernatural element into our service Lord we've sang songs we've heard from different countries Canada Poland from the African here we are in the United States but Lord this is a message that has gone around the world certainly has the heart of God today as we sense within the assembly the fire of God and passion for your Holy Spirit take us deeper today Lord we want more than just church we want to see more than just one another God would that element just come into the room and take over all of our hearts God we thank you for everything we thank you for your mercy and Grace and we invite you to be the speaker now I think there's going to be a baptism maybe after the service we want to thank you Lord for that we want to be mindful that one day it's going to be the last Sunday morning service it's going to be the last time that we do our hair that we start our cars it's going to be the last time that we go to work or have Sunday school Lord don't let our hearts get in a rut don't let our hearts get cankered with Leo deia keep us free keep us fresh keep us on the edge of our seats today Lord as we drink from your presence let the waters be sweet let the waters meet the need for the hour let the bread be for the season from Bethlehem that would satisfy every single heart from the youngest to the oldest Lord don't let us take half the service to look around or get comfortable but let us just jump right in right now and realize Lord we're in the presence of God he knows the secrets of our hearts there's not one of us that is hid today in the midst of the hundreds that are here today or those streaming you can come to every life and every situation and speak personal we give you this service in Jesus Christ's name amen and all the saints said amen amen God bless you I'm just going to let you have your seats for a moment I I just wanted to greet you as the brothers bring up our

to all you that are here I understand somewhere here from Edmonton the dos and New York Tennessee Texas Washington all throughout uh Arizona the churches we have old friends here old friends and some new friends and to all the saints of God God we we were here just four weeks ago for a wedding brother uh Elias Pages was getting married to Sister Ariana clar with the clar and the Paige Peterson family and just within uh those few weeks we've at our little church just baptized three people already and next Sunday another being baptized I just wanted to show you our little family let you see them brother Timothy is on your right and Jessica they have three children brother Michael's um there to my wife sister Sharon is here today and then Michael is our middle son and then Victoria she was born in the Thunderbird hospital so we visited our brother yesterday brother Ron and I brother Glenn tamlins at the hospital in uh Thunderbird hospital we were able to go back to where my daughter was born in 199 98 so actually it's been a little longer I don't know if it's old age on all of us but it was 97 to 2000 when we lived here don't try to think about that amen that was another generation ago so I just wanted to let you know the the family as well and by the grace of God and um also since we've ministered for you just over uh two years ago the Lord uh laid it on our hearts to open a little church there in our area and we started in a community center uh this is the community center that we were for 20 months and then we move the lord gave us another church building in Bellingham Washington end time message Tabernacle that uh we're just renting right now and we're just so thankful to the Lord isn't his L the Lord good to just meet the Cry of every area every place that would be brother brandham wished there was uh churches on every corner and I just pray that that we would have the spirit sometimes as our Prophet you know to uh be able to have that kind of attitude and wherever you're live or locally that God would give you a blessing well there's a lot we of things we could say or preach on we just have one service but the Lord laid something on our hearts today to speak and I'd like to speak on Lord restore the freshness amen and it's not a it's not a demand of God lord restore it's not us demanding God it is it's expressing a desire of the heart it's a prayer so forgive me but I'm actually our title is a prayer Lord restore the freshness it's a thirsty cry for more of him amen so I I believe the brothers put up the scriptures so but we're going to be reading in 2 Samuel 23 and then also 1 chonicles 11 so to two places in the Bible maybe we could stand go ahead Brothers if you'd like to turn to that 2 Samuel chapter 23 and um you've helped me feel at home so I can feel relaxed today amen some of these thoughts that we're going to be taking are out of uh at least five messages of brother brandham you'll remember why little Bethlehem and then he spoke it again he spoke it in 19 1958 then 1963 why little Bethlehem then God's gifts always find their places there is a man here that can turn on the light we have seen his star and have come to worship him we want to take our inspiration from the prophet and then go right into this morning we're going to jump right into it after the scripture she'll be ready for that in 2 Samuel chapter 23 you can see in verse one these are some of the last words of David he is remembering these times in verse 8 it speaks about the mighty men that David had but we're going to slip down to verse 13 and three of the 30 Chief went down and came to David in the Harvest Time unto the cave of aelm and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of refraim and David was then in an hold and the Garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem can we all say Bethlehem Bethlehem and David longed this this verse is on the screen David longed and said oh in my Bible there's an exclamation mark what about your Bible David longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of The Well of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three Mighty Men break through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the Lord unto the Lord amen and he said be it far from me oh Lord that I should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in Jeopardy of their lives it wasn't natural blood David was looking beyond the Flesh of the people around him he was looking that how they are responding to the word was their Revelation it was their blood it was their life and we are pouring out our life every day is US expressing what we think of him amen but when David expressed this he saw that these men have been in Jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three Mighty Men let's go to the next scripture if we can in 1 chonicles 11 out of out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses let these things be established Lord restore the freshness verse 1 chonicles 11 verse 16 you can see in verse 10 down to 17 as these Mighty Men some of their names are mentioned look at verse 15 now three of the 30 captains went down to the Rock to David so there were three of these men that were around David in the in the cave there and ageline and the Philistines were around verse 16 and David was then in the hold and the Philistines Garrison was then at Bethlehem and David longed with strong desire and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of The Well of Bethlehem that is at the gate and the three break through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David did David take the water and drink it and just satisfy himself no did he satisfy y his desires his natural desires no he looked beyond the water natural he said these brothers have a revelation and he poured it out on the ground sometimes you feel like your life is just being poured out on the ground the sands of time is swallowing up your life your energy your money your family what is happening David poured it out on the ground verse 19 is our last verse and he said my God forbid it me that I should do this thing shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in Jeopardy for with the Jeopardy or the hazard of their lives they brought it therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mightiest God bless you you can have your seats David was frustrated that's what brother brandham said David and all his frustration he was walking back and forth it was a hot day why is it so hot he wasn't on the throne he wasn't in an air conditioned place he was out running for his life life the people in the message had uh misunderstood him he was the anointed king amen and what was going through his mind is after all of this and he was frustrated it was hot Saul was after him there were armies everywhere and he's sitting in the mouth of a cave the anointing oil was on him and he was thinking how could it be God how can all of this be in my life he said oh I wish I could have a drink have you ever been thirsty have you ever been hungry have you ever had something inside of you that was looking beyond the now and looking Beyond around you no matter how good you have but you just wanted something that was [Applause] fresh David was like that I wish I had a drink and his mind begin to go back to the gates of Bethlehem where there was a well right there was just nothing like that water that was in Bethlehem remember Bethlehem was the house of God's bread Christ is Bethlehem brother brandham said bethl bethl House of God's bread and we see the bread of life came out of Bethlehem it was the house of God's bread but Bethlehem was also the water seat of that whole province in that area there's no water like Bethlehem had and David used to take his Sheep by that well so he knew the waters were sweet good and I pray God today God restore some sweetness back into our lives Lord restore the freshness D David like any real leader is around sheep and they have a burden for the Sheep they've got to be fed good they've got to have good water not getting in a rut and just getting into a place of a form that didn't satisfy David David had water but there was no water like the Waters of Bethlehem remember it was his soul that was crying for a drink of that water he wanted something specific and he started to remember the days when he could drink of these Waters and and you know as we bring it up till today let's just bring it right up till today Jesus Christ is not satisfied with the denominational stagnated Waters of Leo DEA a lot of churches in Phoenix today that have their music have their services have their programs and I'll just be honest with you God is sick of it it stuffs him up it's it's just stagnated Waters but I wonder if sometimes even within the message we've allowed the freshness to seep out we've allowed our hearts to get caught up in a lot of other things and the sweetness leaves and we get in a dry place and we start to remember the times when that love and God's presence was near amen and I say God bring back that new again to all of us I'm speaking to the young and I'm speaking to the old Lord restore the freshness restore means to bring it back it it infers that you had something before but some of it has seeped out maybe it's gone somewhere but you as a Believer are just like David I'm longing I'm thirsty to see Jesus back again amen amen a real worship something that is from the genuine heart where God can pour himself in where the word can live in our day I'm going to just have our liberties today I I believe brother Ron give that to us today I want to focus on two specific areas number one it's God's desire for a fresh drink just forget about yourself just you know we can become selfish that's right we come into church we go to a meeting we around people we get so selfish let's focus on the main thing God deserves a fresh drink today I think I got about half of you with me today God deserves a fresh drink he deserves to have people that are connected to him that are engaged to him that are looking to him today but number two is we're Believers you and I have a desire for a fresh drink something cool something that is good and refreshing some Waters that are clear that meets The Thirst not stagnated not corrupted something clean something refreshing something that will renew the heart of God and flow back to us and we'll satisfy I just want to say the last time I saw you was last year in 2023 and you finished strong and you're here today this is 20 24 already one month's already gone by I want to say this is the year right now to grab a hold of this we don't have 2023 anymore there is no other year before us in the past that we can just all be clawing back for memories that will satisfy us this is a new year and in the the future is unknown we're not even promised another breath or another baptism this afternoon we have today how many want to give him a fresh drink today amen remember these three men were around David they weren't far away they they weren't like some distant place they were around and I want to be around where the word is I I want to hear that still Small Voice Lord please position my life where I can hear your will and your desires and David did not turn and command these men and say I want you I he did not speak like that he was expressing his desire he was just speaking from his heart but these three men were Mighty Men and they were Gentiles but they saw him on his way to the throne he wasn't on the throne it wasn't beautiful it wasn't nice it wasn't always good times but they saw it was Christ in David how many know that it was David was a fugitive from his own people Christ was a fugitive from his own people Amen in our day Revelations 3 in the church age that we're living in he was on the outside he was a fugitive from his own people I believe all of you believe that but let's come right into the message today right where we're living there's Warriors today where Jesus desires a he's still a fugitive even amongst his own people often times he can be so far away and I say God bring those Desires close again bring your presence down real again Lord and we're talking also about our new generation that there deserves a chance at the word and they deserve to have the Holy Spirit in our meetings and in in our families in our relationships please give them a chance an opportunity to receive the [Applause] Lord Lord restore the freshness Lord bring it back again Lord I'm speaking earnestly but sincerely that God give that to every single one of you today maybe somebody that's streaming whether locally or wherever they're at the Lord can just come right where they're at and restore it right there where they're at God's a god of Miracles he can change a nature he can change a heart friends don't put anyone out too far they might be the last one you might be the last one that needs to come to Perfection take the word of God today there is a faith for this generation that's been anointed by a prophet has anointed this this generation the Lord Lord Jesus has anointed this generation I want to take you back even individuals today in your memory and in your past I see a lot of Elders and older ones here I heard brother Ron last Sunday mentioned his testimony sister sy's testimony and where they came from my wife sister Sharon is here and she was raised in Australia her father is a pastor of the message raised in the message from a little girl but it wasn't until a teenager when there was some meetings and the freshness of the message came by her way and she gave her heart to Christ and she God filled her with the Holy Spirit we believe in that today don't we it can happen right here today someone the Holy Spirit just falls on them could be in the nursery right now come on I want to go back with you just for a few moments in our own lives where we were raised born and raised in the Bram Tabernacle I'm speaking today about Lord restore the freshness we were raised with people that would stand for hours in lines as it was in brother bram's day but it wasn't when brother John was being raised up and they'd have special meeting there was two doors in in the in the back one in the front one on each side and there would be lines for hours long lines and when they open the doors within 60 seconds that whole building was packed and they waited and they waited and they waited to hear maybe a tape maybe a message I remember the park V Junia High School where they'd have special meetings and thousands of message Believers that love the message they would brother bradam spoke their marriage and divorce and he spoke looking at a curtain and on this side was an auditorium that was just packed full of people and on this side there was a whole gymnasium with bleachers and chairs and they would just pack out that building when brother John was raised up at Easter meetings they would rent the same place and they would just pack out this for a whole weekend and hear messages remember those days I remember youth camps as a young boy I was just sharing with a couple of the brothers locally on Friday night how we were raised were young men and young ladies that are now leaders in the message that they were on the they were receiving the Holy Spirit and God was being poured out on their lives genuine Holy Ghost camp meetings not just a lot of running and screaming for the moment but like it was an experience that kep married them Monday Tuesday it was like the message was being poured out and what we saw not not just on the day of Pentecost but through brother bram's Ministry that could bring you from a new birth all the way through to adoption and maturity it was happening Hallelujah I remember days when fathers and mothers and families they were burdened for the word I remember the days when young men and young women would move across the oceans move across the the states or provinces or countries but they move for the word of God it wasn't for a job or because of family or finances it was for the word I remember when families were moved by the word yes sir I remember years ago when desires for people is this okay today speaking about Lord restore the freshness yes I remember people would linger for hours in the presence of the Lord longing they were loving they were craving they just wanted God I remember the days when people love the message they love the ministry they love church they love the house of God it wasn't cuz it was convenient but they loved it I remember when they loved to sing songs I remember they love Fellowship you couldn't hardly break them up from one another hardly they had brotherly kindness they long to get together I remember when the presence of God being so strong and so powerful in meetings when it was just a heartache they just wanted to see more of God I've got to have God I've got to get to Jesus they would run they would stand up and run in a service I remember preaching in New Zealand one time and and it was in a place a sheep farm and it it was 100% of the people in that building we we ended up at the altar I remember that brother Ron it was a place where God was just moving God's spirit was moving sovereignly people had a strong will to serve Christ that Holiness was the standard Jesus Christ was the head as I begin to just sit and Ponder as maybe Mary pondered and meditated about these things and think I begin to ask the question will we ever see those days again or will it just grow continually worse will lukewarmness continue to grip the throats of even Believers and caner their lives their breath becomes stale their hunger becomes the cry for the spirit is just hardly uh you know very anymore it's like a lot of other things have taken over are people thirsty for the Supernatural and I say God today restore our first fresh desires again Bring Back Your word your breath of your word so that it'll satisfy this new generation that will bring them to a full birth that will bring our families back to that place again restore unto us all the years come on friends we get in a rut we get into a place where the message doesn't stir our hearts anymore where meetings just become so staged and so expected and this and that God Shake our worlds a little bit don't ever let us get so old and stagnated and in a form that it's got to be our way or the highway friends we got to get on God's way amen sir restore unto us if we've lost something in the battle please forgive us Lord I I would be the first one to say if we've lost something in the battle forgive us Lord and restore it back again restore our first love give us refreshing Waters Lord of Life Hallelujah renew our joy our Heart of Worship bring back the new again give us SP aneous crying out in the spirit I remember the Welsh Revival it wasn't in a church service it wasn't with a with a lot of things going it was a youth meeting where young people and a young lady stood up and said Lord Jesus I love you with all of my heart and a Welsh Revival started and a 100,000 Souls were won and I say God help us today with this glorious message amen hallelujah amen I hope this is okay give us gentle weeping again will people just seek him give us Ardent Faith Warriors that are resolved to follow and with a firm commitment cuz I I just speak a word of encouragement the more you feed from the world the more it dulls your spiritual being the more you neglect that spiritual hunger and the Pains of the word and satisfy those Godly thirsts with water with carnality you will more spiritually Decline and get worse and worse and I say God help us today give me a new [Applause] desire you can even create a new heart and give it back again a clean heart a right Spirit renew a right Spirit within me or are we just going to be satisfied with more ungodliness the more evil it just seems like people good people can get swallowed up and loosen standards just becomes positive where dullness is acceptable I'm looking at my notes my wife tells me not to but that's what the Lord laid on my heart so I'm trying to be very focused where people can condone sin because it's in our family or it's our church or it's my friend if it was another church my you'd be so quick if if it was another family you'd be so quick but because it's my friend my are you just kind of have another attitude people get cold and indifferent we get it's stale the danger is where that's becomes accept acceptable right and people actually begin to agree with backsliding There's No Cry for godliness no passion for him and David was seeing all of this and something be to cry out within him from his heart oh for some fresh waters again amen let's go back please to second Samuel if you have your Bibles and can turn back there again today M it's been a long time since we've been back and seen a lot of you we raised our children in the church for three wonderful years I don't regret it not one minute brother Ron and sister Sandy and the church here you opened up your heart to us we knelt down today my wife and I in prayer and I I was thanking the Lord for this church it's only because of you is why I'm standing here right now it's because of the love of the Lord Jesus you've opened up your heart I'm not taking advantage of of your invitation to say something inappropriate I'm taking the opportunity to encourage you God may we all walk out of here today with a a real fresh drink of God Upon Our Lives but may we also have something stirred within us to give you a fresh [Applause] drink can you say amen I mean what if somebody near you just God dealt with them today what if God stirred a family or stirred a heart a child a young person I remember growing up in the message for years it was like there was a lot of um mechanic swed into our lives but one day the dynamic struck and all those years it was like lighting fire and and it was just like something it just took all of those years don't be discouraged and weary with your life and I want to close with that today when when it seems like God is just pouring out your life and it's just going down into the sands of time and you feel is my life a waste come on now is being a Christian and all of your strength and now look at what's happening is it just a waste it's like seriously David let's look at it here remind you in 2 Samuel 23 I I'll REM remind you of verse 39 remember Uriah the hittite was one of the these 30 remember Uriah was the husband of BBA right remember that remember it had to be baseba that brought forth the child Solomon it's not condoning what happened to get there or how it was but God's word is going to happen regardless and all the negatives that's happened in your life and in the message and around the world globally God's word will not return unto him void but it is accomplishing right here at the end time 2024 by restoring that freshness back [Applause] again he's still the mighty angel that can stand in any situation and he just takes control over every matter he knows the secrets of the heart still the same Lord Jesus that can say I forgive you I heal you thank you Lord I'm going to take all your sorrow and all your hurt I'm going to make you whole we're going to start on a journey we're going to get up on a road to recovery do you want to go there well Lord I don't I'm get up get up on the road to recovery let's go let's take a step let's move out there and David you can see him in 2 Samuel 23 uh uh verse 13 again as he was in this place David was in the hold and verse 14 in verse 15 David longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of The Well of Bethlehem which is oh I just want to have something real and fresh and these three Mighty Men they heard that and they broke through all the unbelief that that was it a weekend Serv I don't know was it Friday to Monday and here it's Monday night and they're bringing it back 15 miles just look it up it's it's seven 7 and a half miles one way from adelon the cave to Bethlehem and then back again that's exactly what a prophet said wow it wasn't just a little five minute prayer and a little bit they they were anointed to go after this water and they di down into the well M was precious water we're taking this back to our King and somebody else said he's just a fugitive he's just frustrated he's just a frustrated person right now but these men were looking beyond all of that it was Christ in David they I'll give my life for Christ sir and you look down in these next verses they brought it back to David in verse 16 what did David do he poured it out on the ground forgive me for repeating but David didn't say that take that glass of water and say God bless you brothers and go back to your families and then go back there wow just what I wanted take that water and drink my I remember the days and now satisfy my natural thirst David didn't do that no real leader is out for just their carnal natural thirst David was looking beyond that and said my these men have caught the Revelation they've jeopardized their lives it's their blood of the I can't drink this right amen God help us not to be selfish I'll I'll say right here God help me not to be selfish it was Christ in David that said I'm going to pour this out on the ground SEC 1 chonicles 11 I know you've been there already but it's just good 1 chonicles 11 to see this out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses here it is almost repeated again in verse 17 and David longed I wonder where that as where that's at anymore people want money they want a house they got to have a certain this drink or this certain and they just long after something and if they don't get it and if they don't get it it's something driving them a thirst but David was longing he just longing said oh that one would give me drink of the water of The Well of Bethlehem that is at the gate and the three broke through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of bethle that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David but David would not drink it but poured it out to the Lord and said my God forbid it me that I should do this thing shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in I'm laboring on this point it's the same Spirit of Christ that looks down this morning the almost this afternoon he said I wonder if there's someone someone in Phoenix that will give me a real fresh drink of water today I I wonder if there's any believers in Phoenix in the midst of all this Darkness I wonder if there's any light here that would even hear the voice of God that would even know the mind of the spirit on come on or are we already eating our dinner and drinking our you know drink our favorite drive-thru is already you can already sense that coming oh you just got to have that or fellowship or a love friend or this and that right people become miserable they become a c indifferent then it becomes an attitude in the family then it becomes an attitude in the church then we just become comfortable and it just hardly it just doesn't nothing moves me anymore brother John I just brother John I love the Lord but something's happened on the Lord has heard your cry and he's giving you a fresh drink today he he's he's swooping away all those those memories and the feelings and the things that actually happened and he's saying I'm here to give you something fresh and new oh saying new it's new doctor new this no people even in the message they want to run they want to shout they want to do this they want to do that even ministers they they want to get the the church all jumping and yelling and screaming and yet Monday and Tuesday God forgive me but that's not what's happening in their private prayer closets that's right why would we try to lead our young people to that kind of experience every service every Camp every meeting every's got to be this got to be this way and that way when Monday and Tuesday you're not like that why would we do that friends that's right God help us to find our place and to have the Holy Spirit bring a a balance to our lives amen bring back that freshness Lord let me just ask a personal question is it fine for our young people just to have an experience just like the Rich Young Ruler that they're really good and have all the the actions and the they can do this and be so good get all the stickers handle themselves so well and yet the end result was the young man crying out in hell I have no doubt about it that that Minister that took his service in the scripture brother brandham tied the Rich Young Ruler into that man that came to Jesus that had the attitude his business was growing he was building bigger Barns and all kinds of attitudes he had money he was doing good Commandments and Jesus loved him he loved him amen I just want to say something for about 90 seconds that might help an older person you know Jesus loved this person and yet that kind of love did not win that man's heart and sometimes we we can why isn't that person coming what my family this person in the church this coworker if we're not careful we we'll lapse into a place of condemning ourselves and walking with guilt I'm talking to older ones we look into the scripture like how Jesus handled the Rich Young Ruler is my 90 seconds about up and we got to realize that even the perfect love of Jesus could not win that man's heart you've got to commit that to God under the power of the token and say Lord I give that to [Applause] [Music] you I wonder sometimes if our pulpits have lost the vision and they've lost the way sometimes parents lose their Zeal sometimes even Grand parents lose their influence on their grandchildren and I wonder in the message not I'm not talking just locally here but globally what is our Revelation really produced that some of our young people could raise up so good so wonderful and like the Rich Young Ruler if they died we'd put them into heaven we'd put them into heaven I'm sure that priest did that day he he brought him into the Heavenly Gates he's given so much money he's been so good and brother Bram said that rich young ruler was down in Hell Jesus gave us that example he's down in hell you know brother bram's own family and children which I knew well brother Ron knew very well personally I did too we got to remember that our prophet's son he smoked he gambled he rebelled he even got engaged and went through a married situation which brother brandham did not support his own daughter was involved in rock and roll when she was a teenager after all these meetings brother brandham our Prophet tried to commit suicide not just once but twice what about our families and when the message was just coming out it was like oh when we all get to heaven that's a wave in the 70s and in the 80s now I'm bringing you through all of this in your mind through the 70s ' 80s '90s up in to it just seemed oh we're all going to serve God we're going and now you can see in families and in lives a family of five there might be three serving the lord there might be two serving the lord maybe and you I know of even pastors that have five children and all of them went to the world and you begin to think not in the message we would never talk about divorce or separation we would never talk about drugs or issues and but now as we've gone on don't get quiet on me friends I'm just saying what some of you maybe all of you thought at some point it's like [Music] really and if we're not careful we'll see all the drama in the message and all the drama in your personal life and then you'll drag that into your family and once you bust out of your room and get off your device and then you'll bring that drama to church and you want to drag your drama and your culture into church God forgive us Lord this is the House of God this is a place where we ought to come and let off the pressure this ought to be a safe place this ought to be a place where mental friends there's never like ever and brother John travels around the world there's more mental uh uh uh sickness and issues in the message than ever if we're not careful from the pulpit to the back we'll actually accentuate that and make it even worse and you have people that come to our meetings that just want a fresh drink of water I mean where are the days when the spirit just wash through the congregation and the peace of God just cover me Lord we're people that are broken and crushed and and just torn apart they can be healed where are those days again amen there ought to be a cry in all of our hearts bring those days back again Lord Lord Jesus I've got a teenager I've got a grandson now or a granddaughter there's people you can see there they need the Lord in their they need more than Church come on Friends our own Prophet had that question are we getting them to Christ don't be offended when the ministry starts coming down home to you and you start asking well where's he coming from where's he G stepping on my toes well friends we need more of that in our lives Church ought to be a hospital place it ought to be where God comes down into the secret places we're not running and hiding but I can run in there I want to run into his presence and be saved Deliver Me From [Applause] Evil we need our churches to be a place where fresh water is being served all over the place come on friends we need men and women that have God that can give it to somebody else say Lord if you don't even talk to me this whole service I'm going to give a fresh drink to this brother that sister back I don't even need you Lord but we need you I said we need you yes I I know you're listening I don't need to scream and yell good brother bradam said David when he was thinking on these things it must have been a hot day he got thirsty hot and sweating could have looked way down in the valley from the top of the mountains on the east side of the West side and talking about this city look down and seeing where the Philistines all down there thousands of them garrisoned around he seen that old well well he once drank from that's why brother John went back I was just triggering I remember I remember I remember I remember he begin to think of a morning when he take his sheep and go out to feed him he would pass by this old well because it was a great place of water then he'd go there and he would drink water and drink and let his sheep drink and there at Bethlehem where he watered his sheep H so it's not the Super Bowl that's going to get us we're not our minds aren't on the it's not on those things of the world and our jobs and things we sit in the presence of the Lord and sometimes we're already trying to work through all of this what happen happen in our situations and then we wonder why the freshness we we get we and then the service is over and it's like really and I got to go and yet we got to go the children come on let's go we got plans today this afternoon we got plans right and this is going to happen and we get rushed and we get busy go from two Services Sunday down to one and the cry for the spirit that want to get together we start picking on one another like chick we people you know how many know it's chickens that pick on one another pick on this and the hinder parts of this and that you know our the church needs strong families your church needs strong families that are the core group that's not a weakness that's a strength sometimes people can come in that are broken or hurt or we're not like that and they can kind of start oh with this and an attitude oh that trustee or that Deacon or the preachers and the preachers families my father's a minister I I was raised in a glass house brother minnow my children were too now our grandchildren it's like God we need to be in a church where it's not just my dad's the pastor my grandpa and Grandma's there and my friends here and friends we need more than that we need the house of God to be a place that God can do surgeries like heart surgeries God help help us not to get handsy pansy you know like this that's a spirit of the [Applause] age David was longing what did Brother brandham say for a cool fresh water lord bring it back to us this year I begin to get concerned when I was thinking about this and burdened I think Real Men of God think about these things begin to think about our father fathers and our mothers can I go a little further I'm speaking about restoring the freshness where even our mothers have we become more spiritual over the years since the popularity of and advancement of of electronic devices has that that tree of knowledge now that it's got closer but is the Tree of Life still blooming in our garden in our lives is the word still the main thing amen do I have a right to ask that question what about our elders are we are they more filled with the love of God than politics news articles yes financial affairs can can fill up a young man's heart they get married and have children and more and then financial affairs our family issues clouding are are somehow got in between between our health concerns now that we've got older our fellowship used to be so Ardent about the Lord and what the Lord's doing and brother yes what about this and oh it was great now as we get older it's our health concerns they Cloud our minds business Affairs thinking how to make the next deal so you're talking a certain way on what side you're no I'm on the Lord's Side it's like I think our goal ought to be to have a mansion on the hilltop and our future home ought to be the home that we're striving for amen Amen brother preach it [Applause] brother it was Christ in David God help me to stay focused here David was crying out oh for some fresh water from The Well of Bethlehem yeah I'm just going to have the brothers turn to 2 Samuel 23 our opening scripture and I'm going to have the sisters turn to 1 chonicles 11 our second scripture okay we're going to just let you take a little time here to look down through those verses some of you marked in your Bible or wrote so all the brothers 2 Samuel 23 is this okay just going to let you look at this CU I'm going to ask you something here second Samuel 23 Brothers verse 13-1 17 and then sisters you can look at the scripture in 1 chonicles 11 verse 16 to 19 just glance down through those verses that we read God give us fresh waters brothers and sisters when you read down through those verses it does doesn't say much about the kind of car they drove doesn't talk about the house that they lived in or their sandal type what kind of sandals you wearing today we get so caught up in our shoes amen does it say anything about their the model of their sword their horse Color their mustache did he have a beard I don't know does it say anything about the kind of cell phone they had whether it was Apple Android flip phone blah blah blah does it say anything about that then why do we get so consumed with it I'm talking about Warriors that was listening for the just the least little desire was like a command to them and they fought their way through it's like take my life take my arm but brother we got to get to the well what do you say brother corneus I appreciate that song Welcome for from Poland and this what do you say sisters my wasn't that a great song from from Edmonton today sister Dole wasn't that a great song and my we just got to get this water back to David if one of us go down you carry the water okay and and they grip through there and they're killing Philistines blood's flying everywhere they're getting hot and sweaty man it's hot brother woo that's right I'm going to need some of this water well you can get some when you get and they get there and they get down and the well they're Splash get come on they're coming over let's go guys and they're running they're going back at 7 and 1/2 miles back right it wasn't just a weekend party let me just say something right now over in Israel right now the war that's going on Friday night youth banquet wouldn't have happen cuz all of those young people 18 and up are have been enlisted right that youth banquet would have been cancelled brother Ron I'm trying to bring it to reality yes that's right it's not the older ones right those young men that you know were singing and laughing and talking and the girls and this and all the photos and so on I'm not doubting that I'm just saying even the young ladies would have been on the front lines 18 19 20 this is the prime of the message I just wanted to make that point we get caught up in this and that activity and this that that we got to do that in the church we got you know does does it say anything in the scriptures that you read about their bank accounts brother Robert you got 10 bucks I can borrow this other brother you know he's got forgive me I got to get my stocks you know he's got 500,000 I got to move this friends they were focused doesn't say anything about their grades in school we don't know about whether they like Starbucks or McDonald's coffee or whether they had bought a nice machine now what model do you have Ezra I don't drink coffee it doesn't say anything of do you like cocacola do you like Sprite do you just drink water with lemon I don't friends do you look down through those verses we don't know the color of their robe where they went on vacation what their ages were if they had a degree their grade point average I'm bringing you to a certain point David was wanting drink from these Waters and these mighty men brought it back brother bam said it like this was then that these Warriors grabbed them swords and David cried out for a fresh drink of water and they cut their way through 15 miles of men to get him a drink of water and David poured it out upon the ground as a sacrifice yeah I got to bring you to the close before we close I've got to really have you catch this yes Warriors today Jesus wants a drink of good fresh water he's talking about that denominational stagnated Waters is sickening sickening to him take the word of God and pull it and cut through all these Creeds and things till we can hit that place where there's a fresh drink for him a real true worship a genuine heart where he can pour down his and make his word live in this day I I would just say a word of encouragement to every person you can cut your way through all the unbelief in your life and bring Jesus a fresh drink of your life there's no excuse there's no reason why you can say no today there's no valid reason there's nothing that is happened in your past or present that you ought to be able to say I'm going to stand by this complex I'm going to stand by this that happened in the church I'm going to stand by this issue shame on you above all of that you've been commissioned yes sir commissioned by the word to bring Jesus a fresh drink I would encourage you to Wade through all the physical pain you have through all your family scrabbles and all the culture think about it in this room alone we have all kinds of nationalities my goodness Filipino Spanish African you you know out of Po I mean we're manifesting the word out of all Kindred tongues and Nations and if we're not careful we'll get a spirit in our churches oh oh this person or that per we're not careful it's God that blends our families together friend we need one another turn to your neighbor and say I need need you I need you so now I I really got to have everyone's attention to catch this when these brothers came back to David I'm just going to ask you for a moment about their attitude because when David poured this water out on the ground I wonder what their posture was are you serious do you think it was like this do you think it was like that what do you think their attitude was when David took it's our Blood Sweat and Tears it's our finances why did David pour it out on the ground if some of you could see this today it would help you this afternoon David actually poured out that water on the ground because he had a revelation that what these men were doing was something greater than just water I don't need this water David wanted that water but when he saw the character I said [Applause] character I can't drink this water these men have jeopardized their families they've their wives and children let let me ask you again in another way how do you think they gave this water to David do you just think they came in there and kind of threw it at them and say I got to go to my family man bless God I gave my family here here David do you think they were just kind of hasty like that and and and just rushed in and made it real quick when David poured it out on the ground did they just stand there in shock did they huff and puff like a lot of people do today and get disgusted I've give three years of my I've gave you this and that did you do it as unto the Lord [Applause] let me ask you this did they feel like David disrespected them David I gave up all of my time I could have been killed you're not even thinking about my wife my teenagers my little children you're poured it out on the ground he didn't acknowledge their sacrifice you're saying David you don't even my labors were they unhappy did they put on a nice face VOR David see and then walk out and say are you serious I'm leaving him you see what he did after all that we did what a waste the Lord laid this on my heart today to say bring back the freshness Lord amen I'm talking about our thoughts and our attitude how we're living as Believers how our service to the Lord that the Lord restore the freshness because our attitude I have it right in front of me and and why it had to be Shepherds brother you wonder what what you would have done back then or Noah's day brother brandham said you want to know what you would have done then look at your present State now and you can see what you would have done then cuz it certainly is revealing it is revealing what people do yes God raised up a generation where it really doesn't matter what goes on down here I'm going to serve the Lord as for me in my house don't make that a verse in the Bible make that a real Revelation it's like honey let we don't understand all things I can't put it all the blocks together but often times we need the Lord to disf fragment our minds our puny little Minds we get it all worked out and something's done different we get all huffy huffy and puppy and that's not fresh that's not sweet then we wonder why the blessing of God and we wonder why his spirit is grieved it's very simple friends we need a fresh [Applause] drink we just need to look at it all over again from another perspective someone to come in from the out outside maybe am I just need to hear it from another vessel another gift say the same thing say well bless God I don't receive nothing but my p i don't receive nothing but this certain evangelist we've had too much of that in the message and we've made them stars and heroes and as they've got older or passed away or maybe some fell away people went to the world well I'm leaving the mess I'm Le no no no you're leaving Christ and none of those people ever go on further with the Lord they they go down down their attitude their Spirit their family they get choked and I say God give me a fresh drink of my life I refuse to be a statistic for the devil I refuse to be a trophy on the devil's mental peace Hallelujah I refuse to be sour some of you that lean toward melancholiness and depression and darkness you need to rise up today and say I'm going to give Jesus a fresh drink of my life say I don't have a song in the night I'm in the night well the Lord can give you a song God can restore back to you all the years I'm speaking the word today to you God's given you a fresh [Applause] drink it's not more programs it's more of Jesus it's not more flesh and we don't need another rising star in the message we need Jesus to rise [Music] it might be a feel-good religion on Sunday or at a camp but you've got to come back home you got to face the issues don't bring spiritual drugs in the church like you did in the natural and you took drugs on Friday and Saturday and wanded into to work Monday and wondered and had your oh I guess we got to go back no no no it's 7 day a week that's right our brother stood up here and went like this and prayed 365247 amen hallelujah the same brother that was blowing off your sidewalk this morning I said I have a brother in my church that does that his name is Brother Bill and he said God bless brother Bill I said God bless brother Bill amen friends we need everybody there's no little one Among Us you ought to just be happy God called you to be a [Applause] believer your pastor spoken on him we've spoken on him around the world michef Prince M it was it was Saul's son and he was way over in lar way out of cell phone service but when that something in David that love of God through David called him back and gave him his position you might be maimed all day long and sit under the table and be embarrassed and your little wheelchair is sitting underneath and your little crutches are under there but you're at the Lord's table I know some of you are broken I know some of you even now are trying to figure things where's brother John coming from in the last five minutes of the service they'll say praise God he's fine on the word and still serving God well what if we started our services like that all of our hooky spookies and what we thinking God bless you brother Mike I love you amen all the people that's serve the Lord Brother mow and brother Andre petite preached here Wednesday your pastor gone around the world there's one thing about brother Ron and sister Sandy they're sacrificial their lives have been poured out before the Lord you say what you want to say and about a lot of other ministers but a lot of them have given their lives and it might surprise some of you but on that day when they make it over there and all the scoffers and mockers and people that's torn down and this and that don't be part of that group help us to find a place Lord David cried out because the very desire he had for fresh water had been manifested in these brothers not the water it was their character and when he saw my I finally see the kind of character in my day I can pour out this water I don't need this water amen I'm he brushed off his brow and he said Thank You Lord I thought I needed a water from Bethlehem but I saw the character in my brothers I hope I didn't lose some of you throughout this service but God is looking at some of you today and you're looking at your life being poured out and your really it's a waste but David saw his desire and it stopped him from satisfying his own desire his f Focus shifted these men produced his desire not selfish not me focused cuz it was poured out on the ground because it was poured out on the ground was it all a waste was it all in vain help me out if you pull a little harder or close quicker for the baptism okay some today even Believers they're lack they don't realize they're manifesting through the trial through the hurt through the difficulty and they think it's just being poured out on the ground now soaking through the Sands of humanity being a Christian Life it's just isn't in vain living holy your sacrifice David was showing that spiritual things mean more than natural things you brother character and I see you jeopardize your life mean more to me than my natural carnal desires you see your strength being soaked down into the sands of time poured into children poured into the church poured into others poured into your spouse and you get slapped in the face they walk away they hurt you and you see your life slipping away and you feel like it's all lost I'm single brother John I don't even I'm not even married I'm old fogy and nobody loves me and as the days go by and the weeks and the feelings in your heart maybe years sometimes you feel it's all just a loss you just feel like it's all a loss you start feeling bad about being a Christian and you're wasting your time I want you to be careful today be mindful because the Lord is appearing to you in these meetings Amen to awaken your desires toward him he's here to light your flame he's here to encourage you what more do you need to hear who would say it clearer hallu hear the voice of God today in the corridors of your heart he's calling you to a life of service or maybe he wants you to be satisfied with where you're serving and what you're doing oh Bethlehem dwellers he said Hallelujah I call for men and warriors who's not afraid I don't care if there's 800 standing on one side 10,000 on the other I want Warriors who will come with me and cut a hole through this line of unbelieving Philistines the world and brother bram's talking about that World Council of churches around the word of God there's a well there's a fountain open in the House of David of Bethlehem God if we've lost that Vision restore it back to us today let me hear the word like it was my very first time and I'm just soaking up I'm soaking it in brother I'm here to worship God I'm here to hear from the word Lord I've got to hear from you if I don't hear from you I'm going to die we need more people in the church brother Ron that are like that if we had more people that came to church like that I've got to hear from you or I'm going to die God will speak through any person to your [Applause] need God hear the Cry of our hearts

good fresh drink of Pentecostal Water original Pentecost not a bunch of carrying on screaming hollowing here I mean a genuine Holy Spirit baptism there's not one believer but what would say that's exactly [Applause] right that produces the life of Jesus Christ back in the person back in me back in my family back in the church church back in our Sunday school back in our youth [Applause] group

happen in your life you see this I showed the young people this on Friday night all their faces of these IDF soldiers young men men young ladies you see them these are the ones God's calling to the front lines soldiers men and women that that's over in Israel they're commissioned they're called they're a plumber one one day and a week later they're on the front lines with a machine gun I wish I had a little bit more time it would encourage us to encourage the new generation encourage the new generation say but brother John they're killing people they're blowing up buildings and killing this and that and then then they're shooting one another it is true that 177% of the soldiers being killed this is the IDF is telling us that so it's not the enemy giving us fake news they're telling us that almost 20% of their own soldiers are being killed by friendly fire oh we're going to quit now we're going to go back and stop all no no no no friends we might be young we might be youthful we don't have all the years of experience but they need our encouragement I'm going to just bypass this next slide talking about those but God give us a people that will drink from that well let's cut our way through today who would like to stand with the Lord today and stand with God help us God restore unto us all the years maybe it's your family maybe it's me Lord I I start right at this Pulpit let's stand today let our attitudes Lord reflect you let my spirit Lord respond let me react appropriately if you pour out my life for the rest of my life yes I'm still going to serve you I still love you Lord it was worth every mile of the way amen you ought to be so happy today that you're you're not a preacher didn't preach to you that's preaching from a complex somebody done somebody wrong song and all the hurts and the pains believe me we know a lot of things in the message that would be reason enough to walk away this and that you haven't heard that today you've heard opposite than that we're warriors and men and women I'm women that are here take up the sword take up your baby take up the diapers and the pacifier serve your family like you serve the [Applause] Lord you got your eyes

used to be and we don't always you know want to be like this and that and we we get and we get ashamed we get [Applause] embarrassed we're not the way we ought to to be toward one another and then breakages start happen issues start coming up and the Lord is just trying to say today I'm going to slip you a little fresh drink of water your time of battle I I just want to give you a fresh Glimpse here's some water here's some water and some of us are going but you don't know you this and that and God knows that's right and at the end of it all what kind of water are we giving back to him what's our attitude like what's our spirit like when things go wrong and it comes back at you it ought to bring more humility amen humble thyself it ought to be something like Lord help me Jesus what is it going to take Lord to win that [Music] heart how could they do that and what and it's like Lord help us Jesus as we bow our heads Lord help us Jesus yes I want to give you a fresh drink of my
