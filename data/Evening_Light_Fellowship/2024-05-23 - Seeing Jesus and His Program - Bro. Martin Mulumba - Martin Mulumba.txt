in our heart in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen may God bless you tonight thank you musicians uh we'll take our Bibles once again in the book of first king chapter 19 1 King 19: [Music] 13-8 and it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in the man in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and he and said what Dost thou hear Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for for the Lord God of hosts because the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the soul and I even I alone am left and they seek my life my life to take to take it away and the Lord said unto him go return on thy way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest unto azahel to be and comest anoint azahel to be king over Syria and jeru the son of Nishi shall thou anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of shapat of of ABA shall thou anoint to be prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escape the sword of Isel shall Jo slay and him that escape from The Sword of joil shall Elisha slay yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel all all the knees which have not bowed unto Bell and every mouth mouth shall have not kissed him may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated uh once again uh I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is uh a privilege once again to be in the house of the Lord as uh we are going through uh this uh series of seeing Jesus and his program uh Jesus giving his program to his Prophet Elisha Elijah uh to be able to go and anoint three people for the Fulfillment of his ministry and right afterward we see that uh despite the prophet not knowing uh complaining before the Lord that he was left himself in Israel that everybody has bowed down uh before Bal but he said no I have 7,000 people that um have not bowed down to to Bal uh we see in the message the prophet also uh complaining in the same manner he said uh if there be eight people to be saved in this generation uh it will be a very uh astonishing thing to find but in they said by the grace of God uh later on in the journey Journey the Lord was able to show him uh the bride coming out in the vision though he did he only saw that in the vision but by God's grace in this last day uh the bride day after day is coming out of the rubbish and and all the dirt of the World by his grace uh in this great program that God was has given to his prophet he had shown him uh the condition uh that he will found himself in after running away from Jezebel that's what we had tried to start last uh time he were uh here seeing Jesus and his program and why communism that we see that the prophet had uh three set of people that he had to anoint and we find that according to the word that uh you may have uh one um person that hides many things behind him or one scripture that uh folds many elements behind because in the word we understand that anything any Scripture uh has a two-fold or compound uh M mystery behind it uh every single thing every single verse sentence or chapter can reveal the entire program of God um many times as uh brother bam says it that you read the Bible and if you don't see Jesus go back and read it again because Jesus hiding himself in very many types and shadows of being a thief coming as a thief in the middle of the night as we know that a tee is not very a good example to be presented by somebody but Jesus can can come and hide himself behind uh such uh types and shadows in the same manner also the very program the very things that the prophet has given us in the message can uh sometimes hide the some of the things that many people can say oh I can't preach on this because this can be a stumbling block to many people but by God's grace when the Holy Spirit comes and picks up those element it just opens up even more than by the time we realize say like you know oh it's not by might it's not by by strength it's not uh because we went to school but it's because it is his grace and when his grace comes and opens up those things you know you can't hide it you can't hold it for yourself you have to share it about because when uh John uh saw that nobody was able to look upon those things because uh these were tremendous things so nobody could look nobody could even understand what this great mystery was but then when the book was open then all of a sudden all the nature Heaven and Earth heard shout because there was a new song because the things that we used to be uh a stumbling block or something of uh of great shame of uh uh of a great uh discussion in the church that you know you can't speak this because uh nobody knows what it is sometimes if we had to speak about it it can be can uh uh give people very in amount of shock people have stayed away from churches left to churches because certain things were spoken about but by God's grace when the Holy Spirit comes down it gives us a whole different perspective of those things and then when we start looking at it say oh we can speak about this because these are our inheritance because this is our program because God has G given us these things because at yesterday it was a stumbling block you speak about it why do you say did you say that oh this pastor is racist or this brother doesn't like us oh this church is uh this way I can't believe that we are in 2024 and people are still thinking this way no it's not understanding it's not human ability amen but it is God coming down and when it comes down it truly comes down and when he opens it up we start looking at reality we say oh Lord if it wasn't for the blood if the blood wasn't shed we would never known these things because when the blood was shed then we have the boldness we have the courage to go into the holy of holies because in the holy of holies that's where the two cherubin male and female had the face looking upon the mercy seat and in The Mercy Seat that's where all the TBL of the law with laid within and nobody was able to go into the holy of holies unless he had seen the shed of the blood and today we have people who want to come into the holy of holy wants to understand explain it to me let me understand it no it's it's not because when we we explain it that you'll be able to see it but the way the provided way is through the blood and under the blood the shedding of the blood you renounce of yourself your knowledge your understanding all that we thought that we were just as we saw it uh in the last series all that that I am from this background I am from this this year all that didn't matter until you come under the blood because the blood tells you you need to leave everything that is of you and to take everything that is me and by taking everything that is him then it gives us a whole different perspective of life that's right that's why our precious Prophet Elijah found himself and said Lord I am here all alone everybody has forsaken the Lord they've thrown down thy altars there's no message anymore everybody is going left and right giving their own interpretation the Lord said no that's your perspective that's your way the humanistic way of looking at things oh I don't trust this brother oh this sister has done this that's your way of looking at it but then when you come under the blood under his presence then he gives you a whole different perspective then he tells him like now here's the program that I have for you amen you thought that you have nobody else but I'll give you Elisha that you're going to anoint because he's a representation of the 7,000 that is coming after then we started with Eli uh with j j that we saw that this Spirit of Communism that the prophet was showing us that people in this world that we are living in that the Lord also gave him also a a program in 1933 he gave him seven Visions under those seven Visions we saw that uh uh there was a stage where uh Fascism and Nazism that was reigning of all over the world that under these were going to be swallowed up under communism but then that communism when we look at it in the world that we find out that it's just known in the political side of things but then glory be to God that because God gave that program to the prophet the same Prophet along throughout the message we see that God started unfolding or breaking down the bread so we can understand those seven visions and what it means and how it applies in every SE sect of Life as we see it and we see that uh in the message uh question and answer um 64 19 uh 169 down there that the day in sherp when that AR prise come them and there was all all of them young colored inspired out there communistic I've told you that here in this Pulpit M Martin Luther King is the greatest ende demment the colored peoples have have had right that man's going to lead a thousand of them to a Slaughter that's right inspired by communism and when we look at these wonderful scriptures you know in americaas things like this they always brings almost a riot among people it's like you can't speak about that you know nobody no it's not about what we think that Martin Luther was doing but it is what God wanted to show us but through his his messenger and as we see that Martin Luther in the years that we've seen you know everybody here I believe uh have a little bit of history of uh what America has been uh going through you know along the ages since uh slavery and uh emancipation and all these things but that not necessarily like you know the thing that usually we are dealing with here we are dealing with the word God's program because with God's program it unfolds and opens our understanding that it's not about racism because what people thought was a stumbling block in the message that why did the prophet say this like you know oh he can't say that no it's not about what we think but when we see when we leave all our ideas and we get the anointing of the Holy Spirit then we starts looking at these scriptures in a whole different perspective because we see that uh during this time you know it was emancipation civil right we are all equal yes everybody the prophet gives us those quotations he said like you know man God created all men free but man made his own his beloved brother and sister a slave it's not just to the black people but it's all over the news children go missing who are they who are kidnapping them fellow parents killing their own children uncles all these people doing these things not to the black people or black people to other black people but the world that of the internet we have today we start discovering all kind of things that people are doing to their fellow brothers why because they thought like you know we needed a a different life than what we think that life should be should look like and along the way as all this information were em emerging then people say well we need a different lifestyle we needed a society that is different from what they have presented us because remember in the last uh uh series we saw that what started uh in uh in Europe in the form of of uh of the Catholic Church came along in the United States and as it came along in the United States then it unfolded into a whole different system saying like you know we are free we are free yes yeah by looking at it it seems to be free but brother says otherwise brother Bram says that America is a bunch of slaves that are never seen in any part of the world these quotations are very tough when you just readed it because America we say land of the Brave home of the free you want to do in America you can do anything yes of course but that comes with a cost but glory be to God that God had a prophet unto him he had given a program and by giving him that program then the children of God we are able to see what's going on in the land because by just looking at America we say that it is we are free we can do anything we can marry whoever we want because in the time of Martin Luther people could just like you know do whatever they want they couldn't do everything they want they were uh uh tlets for for the blacks and the white and and everything this was a big struggle among the people then Martin Luther as we just read here he had an idea he said well we needed we needed different world because why Martin Luther says that he was a minister he was a leader and this leader wanted now a different lifestyle than what they had known before and to this day it is still a struggle they wanted a different lifestyle but despite of everything they wanted to do if it was not according to God's program everything they were going to do all the reforms that they were going to do will not work because it didn't come through by the blood because without the blood there's no remissions of sin and sin is unbelief and everything that we had known from the foundation of the world since Genesis that when Cain came and killed his own brother nothing think no reform gun reform was going to change mind of of Cain but it required the Holy Spirit to come into Cain for Cain now to be transformed to look at his own brother he is equal despite that everything that we will do all the the the the the the the the the all the the seminaries we will have that will never happen and as along the time we seen that Nation after nations from every part of the world brother as we read it last time 23 of the world now is communist why are we communist today why is the world turned into what we are today because it is God's program because he wants it to be so because he had seen a system that Nimrod had brought in among the people and he was he didn't agree with it then he said you my Prophet I'm giving you the charge to come and Proclaim these things so that my children so that elishah and the 7,000 people can be able to be aware of what's going on otherwise we'll be looking at communism and all this revolutions say like oh we are becoming a better a better people no there's not becoming a better people outside of the blood because as the people were not understanding to see that God has sent us a prophet and they take the prophet's message and they put it aside and they started correcting the prophet that also another bunch of Communists that we have in the message today because they think that they know better than the prophet but then when that pill of fire came down at his birth you and I were not there you and I didn't know that there was a p a pill of Fire coming down for a certain purpose and as the pill of fire was leading him and telling him do not smoke do not drink do not defile your body in any manner because I'll have a program to end to you when you shall grow you and I don't we do not have that kind of of of commission some of us when we stumble in the message is after living all kinds of Life some of us even after being in the message we live all kinds of life and after then we learn some few quotations left and right then we start telling the Prophet what to do then we start tell taking the scriptures that we think that can be preached upon why because we think that we know better than the prophet but the message of the hour is not a a a uh a piece of puzzle that you bring and you just draw your own picture out of it or a set of Lego that you building anything that you think that you should be building no but then we should go back to the prophet and tell us that you know show us the program because without the program we wouldn't know where to go we wouldn't know how to walk we wouldn't know what are we doing we wouldn't know what is happening among us because this communist Spirit when it comes in as we are going through it we see that people didn't even notice that you know we became a bunch of communists that's right yet being a communist we are here telling the prophet no the prophet is wrong here the prophet is here this here you know this is just the prophet saying it's not that said the Lord and all these things here but then Paul in the Bible says it is not the Lord but it is high and by him saying it is high it's in the Bible and John comes and say if you remove a part of it you're going to be strien by it from the Genesis to Revelation the whole entire Bible the way it is put up with Paul's writings that's right with Timothy's writing it is the word of God that's right and the word of God is the Lord himself speaking in the form of the Prophet right and people have hard time understanding that why because we a bunch of communist I'll prove it with the word amen amen and we see that God's God's preparation brother Bram is showing us how this communist Spirit goes on paragraph 37 he said I was parking my car in a parking lot around here a man said preacher what are you going to do about all these kids and this juvenile delinquency I said cut all this vulgarity on televisions and all this other kind of stuff like that and get that communistic Spirit started to moveing and it will move we didn't see it like that before we thought like you know communism is Russia but he says when he comes down he said like you know the two is will be swallowed up by the F by the third one which is communism then somebody comes and is wondering my child is not listening oh he's now a te teenager and all this year the prophet now start giving them the solution he say it's simple just remove the phone from the hands it's hard to be done nobody will accept that to happen why brother says but as long as the kids as got in in them drilled in them see it at home see it among the father and mother the father is with the phone every day with the on their hands the mother is doing the same what do you expect from the children what do we expect and we are looking for a better a better better a better generations to come but he said no it is drilled in them see it at home and he goes back and say that you know it is the father it is the mother because he is the one leading his family he is the one setting the example because the children can see that Dad and Mom do not Fellowship anymore why because of these televisions in our hands in our cars the mind now is turned somewhere else it says well walk down to school and act and act impudent and everything like that how can how can one Church do it brother we putting them into communist is a spirit not just a nation it's a spirit and the spirit what's warming into America and how is it warming into America it's not Russians coming down and telling us like you know we need to do all all this conspiracy theory of 2016 that oh the Russians have invaded our our elections and stuff no we are looking at it so far away but the Devil comes and say like you know just put it in your children's hand we will give all the reasons in the world oh my child will be away I need to track them down I need to know where they're going I need to see what they're doing exactly keep doing that but the prophet says remove that from their hands and see what will happen then now let's see if really we are communist or not because it is a challenge in this generation it was a challenge back then to keep the children away from Cinemas and all these things and now it is now FS now children are talking about being bullied online and all this things just take the whole computer away give them the bible to read amen it's warming into the churches it's warming into the into into into the schools it's warming into the individual that Spirit of Communism and communism is the thing that's breaking it down watch these high headed hty Americans and you see whether communism has got them or not the prophet says that the two first spirit will be swallowed up into the third and in the third now it's warming among the people it's is warming among the people I'm not telling the I'm not saying the bride but I'm saying like you know that's what is happening it's it's among the people don't don't never fear about the robin that that PS on the the hle hurting it it isn't the Rubin peeg on the on the on the Apple that hurts it it's the warm at the cold that gets the Apple the rotness that we see I'm not outside there because out there it's already polluted butam say I'll never pray for them anymore but then we see that the pro God said to the prophet I have 7,000 that have not bowed to Bow despite that baram says yes of course you'll find yourself you know doing a mistake here and doing a mistake there but you say like you know look at those high-headed people oh I I think I know what I'm doing you know I don't tell me how to raise my children yes of course that's how it's supposed to be you should have the responsibility just as the prophet was looking at Martin Luther said you know he's going to be the greatest inment to the people because they didn't he didn't see where he was Leading the People he just thought like you know this is a revolution let's have a new Revival and that Revival Martin Luther took the people and look at this it wasn't just the blood but among them all the other races all the other backgrounds also join the move and what did that produce freedom of everybody freedom of everybody everybody is now is able to do anything by them going into that system we see that after World War II brother Bram says that I saw that America technology was going to rise higher it was going to the the the the the development was going to get greater but by doing that brother bam says you see now the women now have left their position and went to into the war plant we'll read it and by them doing that now who was going to take care of the children the telephone now will take care of the children now television will do that now a bunch of Communists without even aware that we are communists the second coming and then the great people of this world pass by big blue shaded Cadillacs fine clothes and Rich and yet they tell us they tell us peace they they they tell him that we we uh we all come from one man we we on the equal what happen what's happening there like all the like the rest of the world communism is taking over and we the cause of it the cause of Communism is not Russia out there but it is ourselves because we are unable to see how it's finding a way in our homes how it's finding a way its way in our Liv lives because we thought that's what it is freedom wife go to work men go to work and let's have our sister-in-law or grandmother to take care of the children oh no I can't I can't leave it to uh I can't get it to to uh how do you call it babysitter Center stuff like that they care stuff but then will just have the children with somebody else a grandmother and the grandmother is like you know my my my little child child you know don't don't beat him you can do whatever you want but that was not her job the job was to the mother the mother has still has the energy to take care of the child the grandmother is already like you know done her part right she doesn't have the energy to deal with all the movement of the children anymore it's because of ourselves Grandma you going to take over are you going to be with Grandma yes he's excited she's excited why because he she knows with grandma with grandpa everything is allowed but with Dad around dad is a little bit more strict anytime that I have the possibility to go see Grandma I take the chance leave me there for the weekend that's right and brother Bram say he says you see he say we the cause of it communism comes in with a false economy and promise him something falsely because after World War II we needed we want to grow our economy we want to become the better a better people a more developed people because now the wife can also bring ideas to the table because if you don't allow women to work you are very traditional you are very oldfashioned and it is a still a stumbling block to this day as they are growing up all of them this year young sisters they are working there I need to go to school because I also need to be somewhere I need to have opportunities yes you have all type of quotations that you'll find in the word and that's why the Bible says I think I quoted it last time here it said that Isaiah 41 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread why are they able to eat their own bread because they are able to work because it is good for them to work because if they don't work they find themselves a bunch of slaves because the very husband who was supposed to take care of her now will not turn her into words that we can't even use on the pulpit true it is a stumbling block today the very husband the very head the very Martin Luther who was a minister who was supposed to be anointed of God who was supposed to sit under the prophet of the hour to receive the anointing on how to lead a family how to lead the church he is the one now bringing now a false economy you go to work I go to work we'll make more money and then we'll have a better life and has she thought like you know this was good to see then she goes to work the children are left alone with the television with the smartphone now the devil Now find find its way into the children teaching them all kind of things by the time she's 9 years old she has the mindset of a 30-y old man she knows everything about other females everything about men and we say well we need to have a better life in the name of false economy brother Bram says we are the cause of it it is hard for people today to make a living with just one job but at the same time bam says but there's also Elisha there's also Elisha unto whom the understanding must be given because the world today seems like you know everybody has to work everybody has to work yes everybody has to work but unto what goal unto what goal the children are growing up no mother at home and when there's no mother at home then the very children now they come to church he when I was dealing with Sunday School in Colorado one of the child just comes and very disrespectful say like you know let me study this then you start looking what does your mother do oh mom mom works what do mom is at home oh you can see when brother bam says that we are the cause of it yes we are the cause of it because we think that we can teach the prophet better than we think but then when we get in the word then we start seeing how the prophet gives us all the necessary equipment each mother in its position each father in its position and everything just working fine and that's where now Elisha's Ministry comes into play because Among Us here we have a lot of elas and God is going to hold you responsible what did you do with the anointing that I gave to you we'll get to that I won't jump this perod of communism because I know right now even I know like you know it's a very tough subject to deal with when you say like you know now what are we going to do we have bills to pay of course you have bills to pay but until you are anointed you'll find yourself all your entire life paying bills and bills and bills and bills without resolving them they pay you 2,000 today it's not enough then they pay you 4,000 tomorrow it's okay now okay now let's leave uh our ZIP code let's move into a different zip code and when you move into a different zip code you find yourself in the same cycle again true and who is the cause of it we are the cause of it and yet we say brother Bram didn't know what he was talking about Jesus Christ true sir without the anointing without the program we are spinning around without understanding what we are doing he says now blind Bas he says now what's happened communism has has come down and told him it's all false and get him a false economy by giving him a hope said yeah that's the way they do they to do it that's the capitalist and so forth the Communist come and say that you know you see now in this capitalist Society you know nothing can really work we we have to work all of us that's a false hope brother bam says that's a false hope and while we seeing these things in the church churches you look at the church you look at the people outside just as it was in the time of in the time of Moses they saw that the bride the people the Jews were getting stronger he said what shall we do you say like you know let's put more work on them they lower the wages inflation always going high and people are saying they're not seeing that they're just wondering like you know oh we hope like you know if I get a new a new job then oh yeah yeah probably a better car and then a better clothing and then and then and then and then and then before they find them themselves they are always in dead until the day of Their Lives why the same system that started in Genesis when the economy was not working under Joseph but God had to give Joseph the understanding on how to work because it's going to get worse and worse and worse and as it's getting worse brother R I'm says it is necessary for that pressure to come about so that the bride can understand what they have to do but then when we look at it just look at it like that you said no oh it's not a it's not communism brother bam says he said he said the reason that's the reason it's done that is because of that we put our money on beer cans and cups and things like that and the missionary have to leave off of a penny off a penny march to come to to the altar about once once a month and brother we've sold we we going to reap what we sold you just remember that show everything that we are sowing the very children we are sewing because what we call Baby Boomers today is the result of after World War II and the baby the baby boobers are the generations that they didn't know parental control and the the great decision makers of the world that led the world into all the chaos that we see today are the Baby Boomers what we are sewing we are ripping and when we are ripping it and we are facing it and yet at the same time then God gives us a prophet warns us of the those things then people go about and they just repeat the same mistakes again but glory be to God that we have the prophet we have the message of the hour we have the Tes to understand so we can be able to see they didn't work yesterday yeah they kept all the money they invested into all kind of stupidity and today still the same thing they take all the money they send it offshore they tell you no we don't have enough money to pay the people and when they do that now now the pressure is upon you that I need need new shoes mother I need this here I can't be this way here okay now all of us let's go to work let all of us now communism start taking place in the children among the children and what do we expect of the Next Generation because they are the ones that will get married tomorrow and once they get married without any form of parental control any form of the word presented before them right they see that in the father that is always working hardworking father hardworking mother yes like you know that's what we need to do yes keep doing that but also look in the word and see what the result of what you're sewing what you're going to reap the resurrection of the Resurrection I believe that one of you right now after seeing what you have seen hearing what you have heard seeing his power and manifest station I believe that each one of you can go to your church and start a prayer yourself I believe you can turn this whole place in here and makes this town so dry from whiskey that the bootle would would have to Prime itself an hour to get enough motion to speed I believe that's the truth I here on the police force and everything that we are that they bootlegging whiskey in polce and they bringing in here what is what the trouble is they let down the bars and their churches and God formal everything else pollute the country and members of the church drink smoke gamble live like the rest of the world work like the rest of the world we do everything like the rest of the world butam says that's what broke communism lose in Russia believe th this because they have seen that everything that the Catholic church was doing we are doing the same thing no wonder today now the sisters now they can go and get anybody outside and bring them to church he's a nice guy I can marry him he leaves the church and goes outside she's a nice girl what why because there's no discernment because he and he or her cannot see the difference between a Christian and a pagan yeah we can just live like everybody else yeah he's just he's just a nice guy he speaks English he he has a job he has money you know he doesn't I've done the background check no that background check doesn't work on this that's right amen background check All These Years background check never depicted communism otherwise as brother bam says we should have closed all the bars closed all the whiskies and stuff but no all the money all the biggest investment is into the uh the casinos and into all the human trafficking and all these things background check never detected in even one of it not once and they come in the churches we see that this whole crumbling system is being destroyed because the very people who were supposed to present the good the the the the best example are now crumbling down and when it gets into the churches people who have a lot of money barabam says I believe in the second sale 153 he said now somebody who has money comes in the church and start telling the pastor Pastor God bless you Pastor you we we support your ministry Pastor so how okay so what do you want but Pastor you know certain things you know Pastor you know you know us you know we have to have our own group Pastor right in the church why because he has money he wants to bring now communism among the people bringing into all kind of type of ideas butam says you know the whole uh the whole air has become contaminated with with the power of the Underworld the power of Darkness we look out of the world now and find out around how communism waving its way in we could get out of the street here in America we we we take for instance like I was passing I was passing a place while ago in your city the lovely city you find that these matters outworking these War plans and things and that come in that come in their children with babysitters oh it's a disgrace that our America our American woman ever put a pair of overhauls and went to a war plant to work I don't care how much that hurts but it's a dis Grace brother brother is seeing that happening it was a disgrace yesterday but today is a normal thing it is a right for every woman to work with all the attached cation to it brother Bram also said if she's not if she's not yes of course until you receive the Holy Ghost you see what your position is God opens up the life of your children before you like Manoa with his wife went to the angel and showed to him tell us how are we going to raise this children besides that we are just raising any type of children we are just like you know yeah we are normal kid average kid you know they'll do this they'll oh you know it's just teenager's life you know before you know before you know it they're now turning to uh young adults and before you know it they're not interested in coming to church anymore because the father themselves the parents themselves the pastors themselves the ministers themselves they are unable to see it butam say we are just bunch of Communists without knowing without seeing it and all these uh you know short skirt high heels and makeups and you know uh clear nails and all these things and extension left and right and double life being lived yeah but when we look at it we don't see it but until we get the word you get into a church then you start seeing things as brother ROM said I'll come and I'll look at the sisters it's not the normal looking just say you go into a church you're looking at them no it's not that kind of looking he said like you know get to talk to them hear them because you go into a church some of the basic things you can see how communism has got even the simple education the simple manners a child doesn't even you he walks walks to a grownup they don't even know how to say hi some of the simplest things at times you meet them like you know they don't they look at you even if as if they didn't even see you they just pass why because they learn it at home and when you look at the parents the parents will do the same brother Bram says in Elisha's time the children they saw that at home that's why they came and said baldheaded men yeah they learn it at home these are these are some of the simple things that somebody's responsibility was not done because of a false economy because of like you know we're going to be better people we're going to be no it used to be yesterday hello mister hello Dad hello pastor and this and this here this builds up upon this right brother say if they had learned it at home they would have not behaved that way before the men of God and when that happened then the men of God also got angry then he cursed the children no wonder brother I'm going say like you know these Rick and rers I've told them preached them years after years they keep keeping cutting their hairs why because at home no nobody was able to do that because there was no mother like Moses mother to take off the child to teach him that you know you are a super race you are a peculiar people then now we can see now if somebody now behaving in that manner we see the children say what do you expect of the third generation just as it say like you know the Revival comes in big Revival everybody's excited then the next generation is start sloping down then the third generation there's almost no light to it and this communism spirit is finding its way in but then also there will also be Elisha's part you know what you supposed to do what are we doing and how we able to help others to be able to overcome the challenges of this world because the time is pressing because as we read it say the Bible says that you know the time the pressure it is for his reason because the child must be born but then if we are unable to see these things what yesterday seemed as Martin Luther a stumbling blog to speak about communism and the endeavorment that he's doing it's not just to the black people it's all over the World am all over the world the same system liberalism all kind of things that we can say here that we you are able to see out there but then it is now given us the responsibility to work to Stand Together by us looking inside but what I'm say then we start he said like you know forget not the family prayer those places that that the matters has to start back to and some of us have to get out there and work amen that's what the matter with the churches today you done get away with from from that River you got you got away from the gifts gifts of the holy spirit they got such a a church natural they got away from the spiritual gifts of the spiritual things they cast the fruit they believe because they live they live with the world act like the world Ste cheat Smoke Drink gamble have Bank parties in the church to pay the preachers and everything else super saers dances that's the result of Communism what people are looking forward today it's like you know just come to church and sit there Listen to A good sermon hallelujah amen hallelujah amen Jesus loves you hey Jesus Jesus Jesus yes but that Jesus has a program he has a program he does not just save us for us just to sit like that but he saves us he gives us the understanding his mind in us for us to be able to see because if this generation Works harder then the next generation will be a better one but then if the the Lord inspires certain things then we must have work to do yes because as is a showing because along the time you can even see that in the message that when it started in the 50s speaking about communism until when after 56 then he start speaking about communism as Russia coming to destroy coming to do this year coming coming coming coming doing this year why because that generation didn't understand what he was explaining to them on that first part of his ministry amen and when the church doesn't get it then the Lord said you know I'll just start talking to them just like you know how we are going to heaven we are going to heaven we are going to heaven and then he says like you know in that day many shall come and say have I not preach have I not done this year have I not done this year why because they have rejected the word now they just want to hear what pleasing to them amen but it says like you know if we are able to see what is happening among us because if you says you know if God has to give us some something it has to be the best the best children the best people the best ministers but how do we end up with the best it's by kicking communism out amen by taking the word and putting it back in its place amen and when we start seeing the world taking place then you start seeing the atmosphere start changing then the Lord start will start not focusing now on how the bride should work and work and work and work for the emment of the Bride not for the world because all the Investments after we've done all the Investments after we've done we say like you know we are the land of the free how come we ended up now being slaves after we've done all the research after we said that you know we left Europe we come in America to worship brother said it started like a little lamb but then he ended up speaking like a dragon behind it what happened between is some of these little things it's because the matters were unable to find the position because bam says you mothers when your children went to school take your time go in your in your closet spend time in prayer but then is it the world in which we are living now today but at the same time this is not to be hard on the bride on the church because it says I also have 7,000 amen but then to the 7,000 it's not because we are the 7,000 that he hallelujah how that doesn't concern us no there's also work for us to do and that part of the work is also very important amen he said like you know that's what caus communism and the unbelief look and say there's no different in that person and me right that's what Comm communism to to rise in Russia that's the reason that they burn up the Catholic church in because very soon they'll say like you know if a gay person walks up here say like you know according to the law of the country you have to bless me what are you going to do people are facing that out there true if that happens here what are we going to do if some of the children we have here happens to them what are we going to do are we going to start looking yeah brother we'll pray for you no it's not about like you know waiting until it happens a prudent man yes should see it from from Far amen we should be able to work yes let's work church let not just have a church attendance coming when we want when we think like you know we go we watch all these movies especially in this generations of smartphones and iPads and and personal devices people are being polluted with all kind of things and it is a time for us to work people spend more time on Tik Tok Instagram and Snapchat and all these things grown young and everything except with the Bibles and they don't see that you go to the beach you put your clothes here you get in the water the waves are just taking you one step at a time one step at a time one step at a time by the time you realize you here and the clothes are there what happened the waves yeah you looked at one video oh I need to see more I need to see more I need to see more I need to see more before you know it you outside but then work must be done here we must work butam say I'm going to close this here butam says one day the Russians the level that communism was going to take he said the Russians will come here will take your home that you worked for take your child R them before you rape your wife and rape yourself and when that happens then you're going to remember we had a prophet look at what is happening in the Congo they take a man they tell a boy you're going to lay with your mother in front of the father after that they kill the the mother they cut the flesh they give to the child eat baram says it's going to happen here and now it is time for us to work brother says Russia is ahead of the US 5 years but then when you look at it do you see it until Biden find out that the Russians are now building weapons to destroy the satellite then he discovered like you know we late we must work now butam said by the time we catch up the 5 years the 10 years ahead it is the end all the invest ments that we are doing everything that we think that we are investing better into for to provide us a better life it is the end look at what is happening in the Congo I'm going to give you the Cotes bam say that they have now Cobalt bombs today we are just talking about atomic bombs atomic bombs but it says that you know the Cobalt bomb are coming and now the Cobalt where is it coming from the Congo brother Bram we have received the prophet what we think that we know better than we can tell him what we can uhh correct him in certain things but I am going to guarantee you in this message that there are things that when you come across you'll be ashamed to even be alive you'll question yourself that if we are still Christians because he had seen these things happening and he is telling us that it's here it's among us but we don't see it but we we're still like you know going to church and just behaving like you know as as a normal life and all these things get married and do all these things go work as much as the Lord wants you to do it but at the same time time you must be anointed to see what is happening because when The Invasion comes he will be very late for us because there's a pro us who are alive and remain howsam says like you know no matter will be complete in heaven without her children that's right and it is not twice work and who is now the father who's going to be there without the wife and the children Billy Paul I have claimed you all that you have loved I given to you but yet the same Faith your children must come to that level The Church Must come to that level what good is it like you know oh the ministers come and they preach and they preach and they preach they get there is only five people why would the Lord come and Inspire the the ministers with the type of sermons that they are ministering because the Lord sees them the Lord see what's going on behind the doors when they are watching movies when they are on on Instagram and hours after hours after hours now it becomes now a norm now for the sisters and the brothers always pictures here pictures there pictures here pictures there if we we spend so much time with photo Photoshop editing the the pictures how much time are we spending in prayer because brother Bram says the amount of time that you spend with one thing double it do it for the Lord this is the time in which we are living in communism Among Us destroying and breaking down and in a very simple manner butam said regardless of all the Fashions and all the Investments that you do understand that none of it is going to make it none and when Russia comes over remember the seventh Vision musician come forward when the seventh Visions comes forward he said like you know I turn around and I saw it was destruction all over the place amen all the real estate all the banks everything none of it is going to stand but there is also investment to be made yes sir that's where Elisha comes into play the type of investment that must be made seek ye first the kingdom of God and everything else will be added unto you and we have these elas who have made this Investments that supposed to help us because you Elisha you see your brother your sister going through that wave of Communism and you are unable to [Music] help that's what Elisha supposed to do all that was in Christ it ped in Jesus and all that was in Jesus in the prophet all that was in the prophet it's available to us it is now our responsibility to embrace to work Galant it's not an easy work it's not an overnight work the time you realize that the child don't listen no more it's usually too late but if you were able to redeem the time work in that manner because remember say I saw in the discernment this child was stubborn the Spirit came from the parents and the grandparents so it is you take your child you raise them the way you rais them then you give them into marriage what kind of child are you giving away what kind of church church are you building because if I have the privilege to stand today it's not just because I am Brother Martin no somebody must have done the work yesterday it was tough why parents are like this why parents are like this yes my brothers yes our parents will be tough on us but it's for our good I know at times like you know it doesn't make say why do dad Mama behave this way but brother says if there's any better parents that he could have given to you is the one that you have and he says many times we think that Dad and Mom are wrong but he said that you find out always they're always right yes brother martin but I seen my father do this I've seen my mother do this yes [Music] Abraham also in the Bible saw his father out there in Babylon he saw his father in Babylon but the same father took him out of Babylon and brought him into Genesis 12 that's where the Lord started dealing with him the same William Bram we call today prophet of the age prophet of the age look at the father a drunker yes that cannot be such a good example for you but yet at the same time God has given you that father to lead [Music] you that may have went into all kind of stupidity yes I know that you can tell me here sit me here but imagine daddy do this mommy do this mommy did this and Mom doesn't this they don't respect each other they don't love each other they're not like yes at the same time those parents are the one that God has given you to lead you and because they've went through what they have went through they will not desire you to go through the same things and by the grace of God now parents will also have to understand the work they have to do it's not because I am father I can do whatever I want no because the Bible says parents do not also be a stumbling book to the children right Pastor do not be a stumbling block to the to the church it is a community h a common effort butam says the only good communism that we need is the holy ghost in the church he said there was communism one time it was at Pentecost he said that you know people had everything together they sold everything together they shared everything together that's the only type of Communism we want and when we do that that's where Elisha next time God willing that's where we begin with Elisha now Elisha must do the work we must be aware on how to labor because the last service the last series we ended up with he has redeemed red us from every nation every Kindred he has made us priest and all these things to do what to labor in the field may God bless [Music] you amen let's stand he never promised that the cross would not get heavy that the hill would not be hard to clim he never offered victories without fighting but he said help would always come in time oh just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says [Applause] give just so on our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again once again he never promised that the cross would not get heavy that the hill would not be hard to climb oh he never offered victories without fighting but he said help would always come in time oh just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give just hold on our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again just hold on our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again amen let's sing change
