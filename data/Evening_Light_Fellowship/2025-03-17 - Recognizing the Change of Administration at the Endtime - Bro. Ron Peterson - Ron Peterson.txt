the same Barber I found sister Becky look at that pretty red hair huh you remember that day there were ones brought to him in Matthew 19 verse 13 then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them but Jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come un me for of such is the kingdom of heaven and he laid hands on them and departed than now as the prophet told us he says what we do is we don't baptize little babies or sprinkle them he said because they haven't made a decision but what we do is we take them and we dedicate them and uh give them back to the Lord for a life of service and so in his Stead of the Lord Jesus I will take the little one and you have named him if I say it correctly kaas kaas which means rejoice and Paul which means humble and I'm getting a little bit of ring can you guys hear that too okay yeah all right and uh kaas Paul and brother Justin we want to Rejoice because not

let's just remain standing thank you musicians each and everyone the song special I'm doing quite a bit a reading uh today so I I ask for your uh patience in that when I have a lot to read I tend to want to read fast if I read fast because I am a speed reader by nature but when you read too fast you sometimes say words or skip over words I don't want to do that but I uh have to take myself and force myself to slow down because I know that uh I'm very much aware of time amen amen and brother Jonathan next Sunday I want you to be introduced to our church raise your hand raise your hand this is a brother he says brother Ron I've made this my home church so welcome we will in fact come up here right now come up here hurry up because I'm I'm not going to be here next weekend so as a pastor I welcome you as one of the sheep tell us your full name where you're from give me a two-minute reader digest version of who you are where you're from God bless you Sons uh it's good to be back here and I went uh away not away I was in Minnesota for uh 2 and a half years and uh before leaving I I was on this ppit the old one yeah and I said uh I will be back I think uh I felt the Lord guiding me back and it was his way not my way and I think uh I'm back and I take this as my home Church like you said God bless you Saints tell us your full name oh my name Jonathan kend that's my name say it slowly Jonathan Jonathan kendi kendi yes kendi kendi yes God bless you Mercy bless amen when I said I'd do it next Sunday I realized I I'll be gone but I just wanted to welcome you back he's been in Minnesota we loaned him away for a few years but he's come back here so Jonathan we bless you and welcome you in the name of Jesus turn with me if you would to the Book of Joshua Book of Joshua has some things in my heart and we've been talking about the leadership of God we've been seeing how leadership that God comes in and no matter how much that God vindicates a uh a man of God or the leadership that God uses we always see that the enemy comes in and he does everything that he can to bring opposition against it now when there are true prophets that come false prophets when there are true Messengers come false Messengers so we know that we so we are much uh aware of that and I just been looking in the scriptures and I've been debating and meditating on different things about this leadership in the end time and so if we would let's just read Joshua 1: 1-9 if we could and let's take very much notice of the word of God Joshua chapter 1 and verse one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying notice the Bible says he was moses' Minister amen amen and this is after the death of Moses so now I want you to understand that after one passes off the scene there's a changing of administration [Music] amen God doesn't just leave his people without a voice or without leadership thank you Lord so after the death of Moses now comes a change a transition there's going to be a new Administration so God now begins to speak to Joshua Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou all thou and all this people unto the land which I do give thee even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto MO Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even to the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee amen I will not fail thee nor forsake Thee thank you Lord be strong and of a good courage for under this people Thou shalt divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them now stop there for a moment because I want you to understand Moses saw into the land but never possessed it true so this new Administration is taking Moses message and his word about what God's going to do in this inheritance that he's given him and now it's given to Joshua to divide them their inheritance amen what a commission only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth for Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then th shalt make for then Thou shalt make thy Way Prosper and then shalt have good success have I not commanded thee be strong and of a good courage that's the third time Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee am withersoever thou goest thank you Lord turn with me to the book of Ephesians the prophet of God said the Book of Joshua in the book of Ephesians parallel one another Ephesians 1 we'll start at verse 9 Ephesians chapter 1 and in verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times notice he's talking about a dispensation here and what he's going to do that he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated un being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory wherefore I also after I heard of of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give un you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him somebody say amen amen and the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power amen amen may God bless the reading of his word you all may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord I'd like to title my sermon this morning recognizing the change of administration at the end time now it's important that you understand that you recognize the day and the hour in which you live amen and I'd like to take a subject this morning if understanding the Joshua commission under the third pole we're going to be looking looking at this Joshua commission what it means because we find out that it's not a man it's a Ministry we'll explain this in Greater detail as we go along there have been different ones that have rose up within the message who have claimed that they are the Joshua and Caleb and you can't make it without hearing their message and different ones have followed them and then we've seen where how the vast multitude of those that followed them when they hit the ditch they also went with them and so God help us that we keep our eyes focused and centered on Jesus Christ not on a man amen no matter how great a Ministry he has brother Bram says you watch a a man and God begins to bless his ministry and if he's not careful he gets lifted up pride comes in next thing you know he becomes like a god to the people and pretty soon instead of serving the people the people are serving him amen the Bible says if you want to be great in the kingdom of God learn to be the servant of all now like I said I've been praying and studying from the Bible concerning God leading his church church and I've always seen where God has always wanted to be the shepherd of his sheep he wants to watch over you he wants to lead you guide you he wants to take care of you amen now we can see from the types and the Shadows throughout the scripture coming all the way from Genesis to Revelation that the enemy is always attacking the leadership of God and Satan knows that if he can Smite the shepherd the Sheep will scatter if he can't Smite the shepherd then he'll send false Shepherds and false prophets to pervert the leadership and cause the people confusion discouragement and the next thing you know they'll even perhaps go away remember God's spirit will unite together a nian spirit a spirit of the Antichrist its goal is to divide and conquer so when you begin to see split after split you begin to see this one and that one and taken over and going into this direction and that direction and breaking uh churches up and causing people to to uh become uh let's say grouped into little groups well we have it and brother Brenham even said um uh a quote about that he says be careful of those Beaver preachers he only says it one time you can put in the word Beaver preachers he says that when they begin to say it's us for a no more in other words they say we have the exclusivity of God's revelation I want you to know there's only one that holds exclusivity of the revealing of the word and that's the Holy Spirit and so it's it's not under a certain man or a certain Ministry although we do believe there is a Ministry but that Ministry is the son of man it is the really revealing of Jesus Christ through a third pole now remember that the third pole is mysterious brother Brenham said now watch that third poll he said it's a mystery yes and he says it must be revealed and we're going to go into some of these things here this morning to give us a little bit of an understanding of what's Happening even among message Believers today God wanted to lead his people by way of Revelation like he did Abel God gave Abel Revelation he offered God back his Revelation and God received it when Cain brought his knowledge uh and his desire of what kind of sacrifice he thought God should use right God refused him remember this that God does not receive every sacrifice in fact Jesus said in that day many will come unto me we say did we not do this in your name did we not do that and he said depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you that word to know means genosis I never conceived you you're not my seed if you were my seed you would hear my voice and a stranger you would not follow now we are in another Exodus today it's not coming of a physical people out of a physical land but a spiritual people coming out of a spiritual land and I wish to type this out here a little bit for you this morning so I want you to notice that certain things happen and when they happen it's a milestone in other words there was a junction brother Brenham said after the death of Moses notice he says now God's changing it's a junction yes can you imagine what the people thought oh my our leader is gone Moses who did the signs and wonders who was God's voice to us and we weren't really following Moses we're following the pillar of fire but oh what are we going to do now he's gone well understand that never does God leave his people alone he said I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world God loves to give you revelation we see that whenever you have one that receives Revelation and another one comes along and he is an opposite of that which received Revelation so you have Abel and Cain you have Moses and you have Dayan and Kora right now I will elaborate later perhaps in the next service or two concerning the gains sayings of Kora because it's happening right among the message today people are saying oh Moses take took too much Authority unto himself then you have Elijah and balum you have Jesus and Judas you have Paul and Alexander the coppersmith who has done me much harm and you have the end time Prophet versus denominational leaders so I wish to take a closer look and let's understand what brother Brenham says about Moses now we know there types and shadows throughout all the scripture we know that Moses is the type of the end time Prophet we understand that amen amen but then there are antitypes also so we take not only what he said here we know that that uh uh Enoch is a type of the seventh Church age that's going to take a Rapture but we also type the bride is going to get into an ark the Ark of Safety being Christ but then brother Brenham says that Enoch is the type of the Bride that goes up up and he said that Noah is the one that stays here and goes through tribulation so we can type it out ever Which Way But I wish to just let the word speak from itself as the prophet gave us his understanding so he goes to uh the sermon experiences and he begins to say this he says now these gifts is what's doing that see the systems changed the church has led the world ever since Martin Luther's time is that right but the church age is dying out now that's right that's the Moses part it's dying out because as Moses failed God so has the church failed God I mean the denominations you see what I mean how many things you understand what I'm speaking of thank you friends look Satan tries to tell me sometime that they don't get it but I know you do see then has failed the church has failed because it's got to a place if you're not Methodist you're not in it if you're not Baptist you're not in it if you're not being belonged to the Assemblies of God you're not in it if you don't belong to the Oneness you're not in it if you don't belong to this one or that one you're not in it how many of you have had somebody say if you don't believe this way you're not in it if you don't believe it that way if you don't believe this Doctrine you're not in it well let me tell you it isn't a man that puts you in it's God that put you in and if God puts you in no man can take you [Music] out amen praise God so let's look and see what he says pergam and church age Church age book now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah savior and he represents the end time leader and that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua so you have the end time leader and you have Caleb who stays true to Joshua and he says but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when and when the time come to move God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word God could trust Joshua but not the others so it will repeat in this day the same problem wow same pressures so it's going to repeat right so it will take one with Holy Ghost discernment amen amen it'll take those who can receive super ra super natural Revelation from God Amen so he keeps going on and he the prophet declares in faith once delivered to the Saints he says denominations are breaking God's are breaking God's pulling out his people getting a church ready Hallelujah the very Word Church means the called out come out from among it my people be ye separated sayith the Lord and I'll receive you you can't writing on your denomination denomination Church age is a little like Moses so now watching make the comparison right it failed to Glory Moses glorified himself instead of God and failed but Joshua was right with him all the time which has took Israel over to the promised land see but Joshua and the signs and miracles and power that's been with the church all the time and you're afraid to let loose that's the thing that'll take the church into glory in the rapture Hallelujah somebody say hallelujah hallelujah he said don't be scared that means praise our God in the Great War Warrior Joshua 1955 Moses a type of church organization who brought the law so forth failed why how did he fail glorifying himself instead of God is that right so is the church today trying to see who can build the biggest church who can get the best dressed crowd who can get the mayor of the city and all the celebrity into the church like the Baptist said a million more in 54 I don't care a million more what it's not how many we can get to join the church is how many we can get in Christ Jesus to believe and submit themelves find their positions stand like the Rock of Ages at their post of Duty and ready oh I hope God just settles everybody in here tonight just let you know what to do this great crisis we're at kades Baria now for just a moment let me rehearsing to you brother Brenham came to the church age in born in 1909 when did the Lan Church age start 1906 brother Brenham CHS 1906 because it was the time of the outpouring of the holy spirit in ausa Street in Los Angeles and what many said was the great glossia of the Holy Spirit putting the church in order and on and on brother Braham said it could not have been the great Revival CU he said he said that the teaching Reign had not yet come cuz the former and latter Reign shall come at the end time and we know if you don't if you're not t right you're going to have a wrong kind of harvest so I don't mean to go into that this morning but 1906 hold that in your mind you have 50 years is what Jubilee so the prophet of God is over in Los Angeles California ausa Street and he's there preaching at a convention where the Holy Spirit fell so he's ready to take the church over he's he is a prophet commissioned and you can see now he come to a place and he's ready and he preaches a sermon I believe if it's if I'm correct return in Jubilee He said let us return back to the word of God and let us have a jubilee which is a release but what happened he said now America rejected the gospel in 1956 here was the prophet here he is on the scene here he is with a message they came to Katy's Baria which is judgment and they refused so God now watch this God's pulling away from denomination and bringing another group up another Administration and you all remember that not all that came out under Moses Ministry that came out from Egypt Egypt crossed over brother Brenham said there was 2 million that come out of Egypt he said how many of the original group crossed over preached a sermon on it one in a million now watch this he said Joshua and Caleb were of a different spirit and they followed the word of God but all of the old warriors were fighting and denominational Spirits got in there and he let them everyone die and he said but God keeping his word is now going to take a younger generation and those 19 years of age and under God brings them into the promised land and the other ones don't receive the promise I wonder if that's what God is doing today if God is dealing with the young people and saying hey the others the different ones you've seen the different ones rise within the message and say I got a little this I got a little that and they pull one off into this one and this Doctrine and this teaching and I'm the one you need to follow I'm the voice of this last day until it became split up split up until uh be we became divided just like denominations then who do we believe I thought this was the message of the hour I thought this was what God was doing I thought I thought this was it well it is but let's go go back to the scriptures and you begin to see what happened then it's happening again today no matter how they saw all of the signs and wonders Miriam danced in under the spirit with a tambourine we saw dancing and all the signs and wonders under the coming out of Egypt right but the Bible says with many of them God was not well pleased therefore they were thrown overthrown in the wilderness Now 1 Corinthians chap 10 verses 1 through 11 moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the Sea Watch this move of God don't be ignorant these fathers they came under the cloud what is the cloud God's leadership they pass through the sea and we're all baptized in unto Moses I want you Moses never baptized anybody but watch this and all baptized unto Moses where in the cloud and in the sea the cloud is the anointing the footprint of God and in the sea was a time a separation and did all eat the same spiritual meat did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be ye idolators as some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the serpent neither murmur as ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed in the Destroyer now all these things happened unto them foreign samples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come I believe that scripture is being fulfilled today amen so let us not be idolators fornicators EX I want to ask you how does a church or a man or a person commit fornication on Christ brother Brenham says these words you better better by the Intercourse of the mind which is the womb to your spirit you add to and take away to the word of God he said you're absolutely committing spiritual adultery on Christ the word it starts out in a spiritual form they're Anointed with a fornicating spirit it's a Jezebel spirit let me say this it's a sexual Spirit unclean spirits will usually manifest themselves in physical uncleanness amen starts out spiritual how do these people these ministers different ones how is it that when they get off and then just a few years later it can become such a a reproach to this gospel how how did it happen they went ahead and added to the word of God and when they did there was a unclean spiritual fornication spirit that took them over okay spiritual happens first that's what happened to Eve eveeve sat down to listen woman what happened to you well it's the serpent he beguiled me beguiled means he seduced her with words he didn't take her physically at first he seduced her how is the how do churches get off of the word you'll have some Ministry add to take away next thing you know you've got some fornicating Spirit an adulterous sensual lascivious unclean fornicating adulterous Jezebel spirit and the spirit of Jezebel understand gives to the people the whne of the wrath of her what for fornication and the kings of the earth did three be careful of who you listen to be you know and as much as I've told you that most of the nonsense that you have on the Internet is just stuff that's against the word of God and against this message be careful of what surfing you do on the internet I like to Surf but not that kind of Surfing amen be careful because what happens you go and you listen this one brother and down here's a few more and then a few more and pretty soon you're off on how did it happen how did so many people who my you you you Church you ran well what what hindered you well somebody got in here and somebody began to so seed and was a seed of Discord and he began to say well the prophet you he made his mistake here and over here you know and I'm greater than a prophet I have been in a man who believes he was the minister after brother Brenham I was in his church he had a pair of headphones on and he was the only one that listened to the tape of brother Brenham but he put the headphones on and he translated the message as brother Brenham was preaching in his head headphones do you got the picture he's the only one hearing the voice and so now he's and he's preaching very good by translating as fast as brother Brenham can preach but I was there and my wife was there with me and all of a sudden he he had his glasses on he was listening and and everything and all of a sudden he put his glasses down he stopped the tape throws down his headphones and he says now there's where I disagree with the prophet he said he made a mistake so now he was all of a sudden causing himself to be above he had greater Revelation he had more he had greater understanding in fact that man told me he says you know what I am in the Bible told me this personally I am Matthew 24 I am the faithful servant to store up the spiritual food that's who I am that I am I'm identified in the Bible brother Brenham talks about him I don't need to go into the names and different things but listen there was ones raising up while brother Brenham was still alive Amen in fact to show you he he he had misinterpreted even the dream wrong that he was storing up natural food brother Brenham told him he said no you missed it it's not natural food it's spiritual food and I told him I said if you were to store up the natural food why don't you give them that excuse me not natural food but the spiritual food why don't you give that out to the people he said well God changed he said it went from an American Eagle to a German eagle you see all the spiritual you tell you what it just takes just a few years of you being in the message and travel the world a little bit and if you haven't met one you will meet one they are now um remember now I've been talking to you about that there's going to be a Ministry of the third poll let's watch perfect faith brother brandham said this is coming into that third pull I'm believing it now I want to ask you a sincere question you that pass through the prayer line can you actually believe and feel he goes on this is just starting to bloom now see I did this for a purpose I did this for a purpose I'm working out something it's taking charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in to kind of raise faith in a Brank bracket where you've never noticed it in that way before not a faith but a perfect Faith amen built it up here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word which is sharper than any two-edged Sword and the discerner of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming now to Perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the r that Rapture that's what's holding it right it away right now is waiting for the church to come into that perfect raptured faith I'm looking for it it means a whole lot of shaken down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God somebody say Amen to that huh don't have somebody say Hey you better you better get my tapes I tell you what I'm going to tell you what that Prophet said I'll tell you what the Bible said listen there is but one voice that God is je in this age that is the voice of the seventh angel messenger but the voice didn't stop with him there is another voice there's another Administration and if you catch that you understand it then you will see what God is going to do in this hour now God had notice Joshua even before Moses did so we're going to go to numbers 27: 18- 23 and the Lord said unto Moses take thee Joshua the son of nun a man in whom this is the spirit and lay thine hand upon Him set him before elzar the priest and before all the cas the congregation and give him a charge in their sight now hold that thought a charge in their sight what does that mean we'll get into that in a moment and thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient and he shall stand before elzer the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the Judgment of irum before the Lord and at his word they shall go out and at his word thou shalt come in both he and all the children of Israel with him even all all the congregation and Moses did as the Lord commanded him and he took Joshua and setting before El of the priest and before the congregation and he laids his hands upon him and gave him a charge as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses now notice in verse 18 it says the spirit was upon him in Hebrew it's ruach it means literally to smell or to perceive and make of quickening understanding in other words it says this comes from the direct Hebrew Supernatural awareness wow wow ruach this guy has got a different Spirit he's hey I smell something I just hey do you hear that yes so he's got spiritual awareness a charge verse 19 SAA point to give a charge to command to send as a messenger to put or set in order wow so I want you to lay hands on him and give him a charge in other words before the people I want the people to see that Moses I'm commanding you to do this now do it before elzer the priest and before the people and give him a charge let him set things in order cross referencing that in Deuteronomy CH 34:9 it says and Joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit and of wisdom for Moses laid his hands upon him and the children of Israel hearkened unto him and he did as the Lord commanded Moses the this young man Joshua was a man of perception he could catch things that others can't he is a type of the believer in this end time message that's got the Holy Spirit listen to me carefully now whom the holy spirit will lead you and guide you into all the truth regardless of all the voices throughout the message he will not only hear the message but he will perceive its hidden message he'll catch the voice of the sign amen he will hear the voice behind the veil yes he will receive Supernatural instruction just as Boaz had taken notice of Ruth working in the field God has taken notice of the believer of this hour who has the spirit and who is able to perceive what's going on am that's right amen that makes you a very special class of people thank you Lord wellow Brother Brenham said the initiated to whom will be shared secrets and things that others cannot catch now that doesn't make you high-minded and stuff shirted in fact I want you to understand the more that God gives you revelation of the will of God in your life the more humble you become because you realize it's him it's nothing about me it's all about the seed God's watching over the seed and no matter how many mistakes I make and regardless of how many times like Po like Peter I put my foot in my mouth the you know uh uh you can't wash my feet uh well if I don't wash your feet you have no part with me well then my head and my hands give me a bath I want you to understand God Is Watching Over the seed that he placed in you and it's everything in your life God will use to work together for the good even if it wasn't good God will take the bad to use to make Gooden then will be things in your life there will be mistakes there will be issues there will be trials and you'll make the wrong you'll make the wrong choice you'll do the wrong thing you'll say the wrong thing but God determined to bring you to where he is going to bring you God Will Make A Way when there is no way hallelujah thank you Lord you will have a m uh mediator you ought have someone stand in the gap cuz God's watching after his seed when he made that abrahamic Covenant with Abraham you find all the mistakes that he makes even after the Covenant is given but you know what it's amazing you go to Hebrews 11 and then the Bible says Abraham staggered not wait a second wait a second let's go back to I take you back to Genesis I'll show you he gives his wife away he goes into Hagar etc etc this guy's making all kinds of mistakes and like father like son what Abraham does Isaac gives his wife Rebecca away apple don't fall far from the tree but God is determined I want you to understand it's not about your works works is only your faith being expressed manifesting that God has given you Revelation because without works show me a man who has faith and I'll show you a man who has works okay but it's not the works that justify you before God no God says no I'm well pleased to see you're catching some now I talked to a brother the other day and he's really struggling with his life and listening to all kinds of things and spirit talking to him and he says well they told me this and they told me that and this demon said this and that I said why in the world are you listening to all these demons I said they cannot read your mind but they can put words into your mind and can put thoughts into your mind how many know that brother Ram said because your body is a byproduct of sin Satan your first Kinsman has got a right to put thoughts into your mind but he can't read your mind so he waits for you to declare it oh I tell you what I'm having a hard time all these demons say this and that I said why in the world are you repeating what those demons are saying you're letting them know they have your they have your number they have your channel yes oh I'm having such a hard time this demon told me on this and that and why in the world you listen to the demon amen I said next time you get all of these thoughts I said why don't you just start praising the Lord why don't you just say oh God is a good god oh my and I says when you start taking the word of God from your lips I said that Devil's going to go wait just a second this guy's not listening I thought I had his channel I thought I had his ear what's wrong don't you want to confuse the devil listen let me tell you my brother and sister when a Believer gets on on their knees and praise hell shakes I want to ask you then when was the last time you made hell Shake I say get on your knees more often when your knees are knocking kneel on them tell me say Amen to that have faith in God when fear knocks at the door and Faith answers yes no one's there amen I want you to understand the Bible said that Joshua was moses' Minister he ministered unto Moses he was a servant a coworker he was one who could receive instruction in fact when Moses went up onto the mount you all know the story to get the laws of God he's gone for 40 days the only one that stayed on the mount not in Camp was Joshua and he waited for Moses to come down and here comes Moses and he's got the law on his arms his beard is now white his hair is white his countenance Shone as the sun amen oh Moses Moses you know Moses talking to him he says Moses says we've got to hurry up and get down and he says oh I hear the sound Joshua is saying I hear the sound of war in the camp he said it's not war Moses said Josh it's not war it's Frolic amen they've made a golden C I wonder how many golden calves have been made in this message and people Frolic and dance around it huh and give themselves to it till finally when it finally comes to an end where do they find themselves defeated now Joshua does not take the command until after Moses is dead God never has two heads right to lead the church at one time so so after the death of Moses then God begins to speak to Joshua the one thing I like about Joshua is he never has his own message he always says Moses said y i you of what Moses said just like Timothy the people ask Timothy can't you don't you have your own message no Paul said I don't have my own message in fact I plagiarize every Sunday I take from another man's message which was the message sent in this hour and I give it to you in fact the prophet of God says you ministers get into these messages get into this word of God and he says and you begin to eat it so you can take it and give it to the people that's why I put the quotes up there for you to see it's not just me it's what he said than Lord Joshua had to be commissioned and placed as God's man because God changing the the administration now watch that just exactly what was taking place in Sabino Canyon brother Brenham had passed all his test and now coming to a place of adoption he's going to be placed he's getting ready to be commissioned for a new Administration in fact he's up there and he's praying you all know you've heard it on tape so many time I'm up there praying I'm praying about this vision and this explosion does it mean my death he got his hands up and he said something struck my hand he said what was it a sword he said I looked and I said oh I've always been afraid of knives yes I'm afraid of these things he said but it fit my hand perfectly he begins to describe it and he says oh a king Knights a man with a sword are we together these are what he said now what is nighing a man is to take a man who's been faithful right and I King dub Thee I Knight thee with the sword un a commission it changes him he was just a regular man until he's kned right the prophet of God was just a regular man until he was kned until he was commissioned by the by the king himself and he said what is it what is this sword that's given to you it's the king's sword that's right the word of [Music] God hallelujah taking size with Jesus now as I've done the work of an evangelist now how many of you know that brother Brenham had took a word that God had given to him and put it at the Cornerstone of brandom Tabernacle yes sir amen do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry for the time will come when they will no longer endure sound Doctrine but they shall they shall raise up men having itching ears right so he says now watch so watch as he picks this up as I have done the work of an advances and here's my plea if that is pleasing to God I've done work all right trusting I have pleased him asking forgiveness for all my mistakes then he may be calling me from the field of evangelism to be his Prophet then if it is I'll leave evangelism but if he calls me to be a prophet I cannot be an evangelist right if I'm an evangelist I cannot be a prophet I'm mixing the two offices that's where I've always fussed about standing on the platform it's never been good successful God has used it but I never thought it was his direct will it's been his permissive will stand on a platform a vision or two will knock you out almost and then if you tell this person how to straighten up his himself up and what to do then the next person stands there expecting the same thing and you can't tell them unless something tells you to tell them right then the other people feel like you're a traitor a backslider a demon or something because you don't tell them what they want to know see that's not the office the way a profit operates yeah who's got the prayer number one they gave out the prayer cards number one number one are you are you here tonight look on your look on the person next to you maybe they can't hear or read number two number two okay right number three you've all heard it you know I I get so impatient even listening to the tape I I would say those who have prayer cards one through 20 stand up and get over here in line period if you snooze you lose but so now he's doing this and he's mixing evangelism and a prophetic gift he said never been successful are you kidding me I thought it was great I thought it was very successful H what about the 50,000 in in in in India and all the thousands over in African are you kidding me he says no he says watch he says a prophet don't operate like that come out here and tell people their name he said what good is it told them their nameen yes yes your name is Eva May yes like it's some big Revelation if you don't know who you are take out your driver's life license I'm not trying to make fun of that I'm just saying a lot of those people that were just operating gift under the first and second pull totally missed the third pull in fact when the prophet enters into a third pole Ministry first and second poll took off because they said oh this man you know what when when when he used to discern people's hearts and all of that that was the an of God now he's talking about uh uh angels and messages and and and Seven Seals and seven Thunders why he lost his commission you you remember let me tell you they said well he got off he didn't get off he got in they're the ones that got off what is the attraction on the mountain I went up in the canyon climbed Plum up where the Eagles was flying around I was watching some deer standing there I knelt down to pray raised up my hands his sword struck my hand I looked around I thought what's that I'm not beside myself here's that sword in my hand bright shining glistening in the sun now that there's not people in Miles me way up here in this Canyon where could that come from I Heard a Voice said that's the king sword I said a king Knights a man with a sword he The Voice come back and said not a king sword but the king sword the word of the Lord said fear not it's only the third pull it's the Vindication of your ministry wow are you catching something the third pull was the V indication what is the third PLL revealing of the word the Mysteries and guess what all of these mysteries in fact brother brandom says the angel tells me sh don't tell nobody you've made carnal impersonations of the first and second poll don't try to teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things get your line all tangled up and he said said no this time don't tell nobody he said but throw your he said take that line throw it out way out let it go deep he said the little fish they go after it first that attracts the bigger fish any of you that have ever been underwater or scuba diving or whatever if you see little fish screeing off you can watch there's a bigger fish coming after them so he said it ain't that little fish that you want you want that rainbow trout you want the the you want the big one amen huh every fisherman wants a big one little one huh nah little thing like this is that big one any of you ever got a big one huh yeah we were we were fishing up on the keenai river for the king salmon and we've been fishing all day we paid what 250 bucks each to have a guide put us in a boat and we float down the river and we tried everything everything we could this guy took us everywhere we were there from before Sun up and we got out on the river and we're just expecting to catch all these fish and we didn't even get a snag I never caught a rock and finally I I I was just so disgusted really hey uh guide take us on back no no I got nah don't waste your time we've been following uh your advice this whole time take us back in I'm cold I'm hungry I want to I want to get back I got one other place okay we go over here he said put your lines out so he I'm just sitting I didn't even want to fish but I throw it out never nevertheless at Thy word amen so Terry Shephard was on one side of the boat I was on the other there were about four of four of us Brothers all of a sudden uh man Terry his pole like that he said I think I'm on a rock he said no no you got one nah n like that and all of a sudden mine so two both one on each side and both poles are going straight down I said n it's a rock it's a rock man he said let yours run let yours run mine ain't running anywhere it's a rock anyway it wounds up that he get he we're in these Rapids and he's got to try to get the net and and scoop it up and Terry's fish is is huge it looked like Jonah's wheel cuz when you ain't catching nothing something that big looks like a wheel and so this thing comes up to the side of the boat like this and and this guy missed it the first time with the net okay okay like this and he and he went to get it and it rolled the fish rolled out goes the like that and he says Well Ron you you got yours on nah no he's gone he's G wait a second no he's on no no he's off he's off come on let's go no no he's on he's on anyway a 50 lb 36 in King Salmon yeah and Terry had just prayed this is the truth he said Lord let my pastor catch a big fish today he said I should have said let me catch a big one too God doesn't want the little fish and when you get hooked remember he doesn't show you the hook he doesn't he puts the bait in front of you any good fisherman he hides the hook okay and little the fish they come up there huh oh yeah signs wonders oh the word of God ah okay and all of a sudden somebody comes by and Sam when they grab it yeah yeah then you're hooked and God is the greatest fisherman I've told you this many many many times he said all that the father hath given me will come to me God is not ringing his hands in heaven wondering if he's going to lose you oh I fa so bad I I you know I'm probably not going to make it to heaven I'm not the best why didn't God choose somebody better somebody smarter somebody who's more obedient why didn't he why do I always have to why me well it's because you're elected before you were born before you came into this world neither having done good or evil God watching over that seed do he place inside of you so he's not looking for anyone else but himself why because the seed is his representation that's him in seed form Hallelujah absolutely amen glory to God I'm so the third poll was a new Administration God was changing from the ministry amen of Moses now watch this looking the way to Jesus 63 brother Brenham is now coming to a climax here in his own Ministry he doesn't he doesn't even understand his own Ministry what are all these visions and ah I went to my first pastor and he told me he said these are demons it's Devils talking to you how many knows he yeah he said oh I went out he says I went out to a little cabin out in the woods to pray oh God take this these demons and these voices that talk to me take them away and he says there he was praying he said in little old cabin he says I hear on the on I see I hear footsteps he said I looked up there was an angel about 6' tall ol of complexion hair to his shoulders white robe he said I have come from the presence of almighty God to come to tell you that you are of a peculiar birth and God has watched over you that's why you have heard as a little boy to keep yourselves away from things that will defile you don't drink nor smoke nor defile your body in any way because when you get older he says I have a work for you he said this is the first time I'd heard that voice so many time but this is the first time I'd ever seen him wow wow Billy Paul told me he says brother Ron one time he said we were up in I want to say vania Illinois or somewhere they were in a motel room brother brandom's brother is with them and Billy Paul they're all sleeping in the same room the angel of the Lord come to brother Brenham brother Bram said can I wake up my son Billy Paul so that he can see you he saides but don't wake up your brother so Billy Paul he's told me the story several times bless his heart he's gone to Glory now he said brother Ron he said I felt daddy shaking the bed and saying Billy Billy wake up yes Daddy what is it he said the angel of Lord has visited me tonight and he's here in the room and I've asked him if he'll allow himself to be seen by you and he said he would do you want to see him oh yes Daddy I would he said now he's standing right behind me brother brandham over Billy he's on the bed his little pillow there he said now when I stand to the side you'll see him so he said there he was laying on the bed and Daddy just did this and he said there he stood his arms folded and he looked at him he said Oh my he said I I grabbed my pillow I was afraid he said Oh Billy don't ever be afraid he'll never hurt you and Billy Paul told me he said brother Ron daddy never had to say during the meetings he's here now he said his presence was so strong that when he came into the building I knew he was there he daddy didn't have to say he's here now now may I share something else with you I was at da Saunders house da and Sharon had asked us to come over because your daughter married a Chinese boy her father Grand anyway the the father is a pastor in China is that right brother Don and I began to show them a little video of myself with brother Billy Paul and brother echard fluke who was our translator and Billy Paul was giving his testimony and there was just we felt the presence of God and it was just such a sweet thing well Billy Paul goes brother Ron come here come here so brother eah hard fluke the translator is here here is brother Billy Paul and I'm to his left and I I showed the brother from China the pastor and his wife I said look at this and I showed them on the phone and they took it and you can hear and Billy Paul come here yeah come here stand up here here next to me I'm going to be Billy Paul so you're brother Ron bless you brother you I like you Billy but see my left hand Billy does this to me he's holding my shirt and he won't let me go and Billy keeps talking I have this on video you can see it maybe one day I'll show you Billy Paul keeps talking and I say Billy let me go tell me let me go let me go no let me go no I said Billy please let me go he said no so he's holding me and he's talking this whole time the presence of God got very okay God bless you you could just tell the anointing of God was there so when we were done I ask him Billy why did you hold me why didn't you let me go because you kept talking he looked at me really you don't know he didn't have to say another thing I knew right then I said I said Billy was was the angel there he just shook his head I said wow the angel was there in the meeting and Billy Paul was holding me that doesn't make me anything special I do say this that there are several times during the course of my Ministry I felt a very very sweet presence I believe he comes by amen doesn't make me anybody special looking away to Jesus I just want to read this I'm on page eight I've got 16 or 18 pages I told Stephen McNeely in the back room I said I just I don't want to go too fast I just want to find the mind of God here it is looking away to Jesus 63 now I'm going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along that is the thing that I've looked forward to for so long or at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third poll has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there'll never be any impersonations that cuz it can't be it cannot be now it's in existence and I I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up and when it does the Pentecostals and for and so forth can almost impersonate anything that could be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power he said what you've seen temp temporarily in other words I'm coming into it I I've been holding back I've been I've been waiting to see if you're spiritual enough if you're spiritual you should have caught that the other day this is that third pole remember Sabino Canyon the sword what is it this is the Vindication of your ministry this is the third pole are you following me now I must continue in a just as I was commissioned first I must continue on therefore you've had the word you know what to look for how to stand I must continue on in evangelism and friends of mine keep still and just keep moving on for the hour is approaching swiftly see that when something is going to be done you might see some odd little things happen for me nothing simple I don't mean that but I mean something odd to that regular Trend because what I've reached to now in the ministry I'm dropping back here watching the spot and waiting for the time to to use it but it's going to be used and everyone knows that for as certain as the first was identified so has the second been identified and if you'll think real closely you who are spiritual as the Bible said he's here's to him who has wisdom the third is properly identified see we know where it is so the third pull is here amen musicians have you come okay I've got so much but I just want to then lay a foundation for where I'll go on the next service Joshua's first commission was to cross over Jordan in the time when the Jordan was uncrossable why it was overflowing its banks but whenever God tells you to do something he'll make the impossible possible that's right so his first commission move by faith and he says Let The Ark and the ministry go before you and he said and as soon as their feet Touch the Water up to their ankles the Jordan sometimes you got to get your feet wet that's right before the wat's part you understand you walk by faith not by sight You'll Never Walk On Water till you get out of the boat we know that we shall possess the gates of the enemy the third poll is an adoption Ministry it's a placing Ministry yes when the true bride catches a true revelation of who she is and what she stands for then and only then will she stand as an invincible Army from who am I to who I am I can see now who I am thank you Lord he will place them by Revelation into their inheritance Benjamin over here ishar over here Judah over here going placing them into their position you know what the Holy Spirit does with you he places you in your position it's not given to you by man the holy spirit amen thank you then he took them to gilgal the place of the [Music] forkins and I'll save this for next service but remember what he does the word of the Lord comes and says circumcise Israel the second [Music] time what how do you circumcise the second time that's what he asked God and understand this he said no he said you've been 40 years in the wilderness you have had so many children that have been born and none of them have been C [Music] circumcised he said I want you to circumcise all of those who are the children of the Wilderness and I just wonder how many within this message have been serving God and thinking that everything is okay and I ask you right now have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe yeah well I thought I I I I I thought that if I just say Amen to all the word of God I've got the Holy Ghost brother Brenham said that only proves to me one thing that's that you can read amen no no no no have you received the Holy Ghost has the circumcision of the spirit because you know what God doesn't seal you to the time of your Eternal destination until the boxar is in order do you understand that not when you just first start out so I'm going to save the rest for our next service oh thank you brother R finish the story about the Saunders at their home okay next week no I'll tell I'll tell you right now do you remember brother da sister Sharon do you remember his wife she starts getting all excited what what is it I want you to pray for me you pray

said I want you to come to China we need your ministry I said the Lord willing we will we will go I haven't sought a time or time I'd like to take a couple Brothers with me brother Mario Brother Stephen or James some of you guys I'm take you guys and go to China brother Ram says watch when East comes to West how many of you ever heard where brother R said you watch when East East comes to

and you're putting all your effort and money and everything I said okay [Music] but I believe saints of God that what's happening right now this message went as far as it could go it went to the West Coast to Los Angeles the City of Angels huh are you understanding now it's going back across the seas what what if brother Brenham said what if that Circle becomes complete this he said is the finished cycle what if West meets East again and they come together yes I just read the quotes last night I said oh God Amen fantastic so the ministry of Joshua we're going to look at it NE next

amen he's watched over every one of you before your birth before you came down here to this earth it's called predestination amen thank you Lord that's why when this word came across your path you know what you're predestinated to it this is your message this third pole it's all about the mystery and guess what you're a part of that great mystery you're the mystery that is unfolding Malachi 4 has already done his work Revelation 10:7 has already sounded but now there's a time of Revelations 108 take the book this is our day this is our message [Music] now there is a voice still in the land that's the and he said there will be a people who under their Prophet will be the final voice to the final age some body say Amen to that God Will Make A Way God will make a way where there seems to be no way he works in way we canot see we will our way Jesus see my eyes me clely to [Music] your for to we will make a way he will make way Heavenly [Music] Father Our Father thou will make a way you have provided a way for us in this end time and sometimes father it becomes so mysterious and maybe sometimes hard to grasp and understand but we don't need to understand it we just need to say Amen to it amen Mary pondered at the words of the Angel and his salutation and that angel could not leave until Mary had her will agree with God's Will and say be it unto me according to thy will then the angel had done his commission revelation Ians 10:7 could not go off the scene until he had preached a message and says I'm looking for a bride for Isaac amen I'm a type of elaser and I've preached here and there but God is looking for character not for beauty amen you remember when God called you you remember the feeling that you had all all a sudden feeling wow there's something about this voice amen there's something about this oh God we know there's something about it it was you my sheep will hear my voice amen wasn't the voice of William Brandon we heard the vocal [Music] cords we heard the message but it was in Ed it was encrypted there was a voice behind the [Music] veil oh God I thank you for this message I pray that you bless each and everyone allow us father to enter into that third pole the revealing of the word because as it unfolds we unfold with it therefore we'll know to how to take our position because the third pull is a positioning it's adoption it's coming to
