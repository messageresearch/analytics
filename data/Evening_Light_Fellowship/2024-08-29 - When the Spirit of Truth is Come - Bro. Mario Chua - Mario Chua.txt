with God and he says no all things are possible with you you know that's the truth right it's all things are possible to us we just have to have that Revelation you know that it's it's with us and I was thinking of her testimony and praying for herself and and and so forth and I remembered a story I'd heard years ago about AA Allen that somebody had asked him to go visit uh uh a woman's sister that had I guess she was demon possessed for a better lack of term there you know today we put all kinds of different terminologies on it but she was deemly possessed and so he arranged a time to come to her house and he went to her house and she was waiting on him a car pulled up and said outstep a Allen he's all white dressed in a white suit white shoes everything White come walking up the door and she opened up the door brother Allan so good to see you he said where is she you know no greetings nothing and her sister was sitting at the dining room table there just out of her mind didn't know where she was at a and walked over and bent over and whispered something in her ear and she snapped herself just like that and turned around walked out well the woman wanted to know what did you say some of you may have heard this story said devil this is AA Allen and sometimes we got to realize who we are and the authority that God has invested in us right amen amen I think sometimes we're a little bit timid on approaching the things but I appreciate sister T's testimony or brought that back to to my memory but God Is A Healer the same yesterday today and forever and nothing is too hard for him and like I said it's certainly good to be back here with the Saints amen I appreciate each one of you and my wife says I'm not qualified to preach a marriage banquet we'll say God bless you

time began my life was in his hands and he knows my [Applause] name and he knows my every thought he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call I have a father and I have a father he calls me his own and he'll never leave me no matter where I go he knows my name yes he knows my [Music] name and he knows my every thought and he sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call he knows my

Father Lord we so appreciate once again your presence tonight and we thank you Lord for this opportunity that we can come Lord and Praise Your Name Lord thanking you for all the things that you have done in my in our lives Lord God thank you for your faithfulness and we ask you once again to come by Lord and speak to our heart Lord the things that is being hidden from all foundation of the world but is now being revealed to your Saints Lord God we ask for more Revelation and understanding on your word Lord that we may live the life that you're pleasing to you Lord God and we commit the service may you just be with us Lord anoint our hearts and our spirit Lord and we can stay focused on your word tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen so greetings uh in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so so some of the brothers uh asked me do you have any plan to travel brother Mario and I said I don't have any plan because I've been in the Philippines for 15 months right so I need to stay here a little bit longer but I don't put a period in it because when I said as I'm getting older I don't know how to plan anymore I just leave it to the Lord and whever he leads me then I would just follow so I've been traveling last month and also this month with been in Hawaii with my uh mother-in-law uh she's a t magara and she has uh 16 kids so I think if I'm not mistaken sister josephin is number six in the 16 is that is that right so she is now 86 years old and she's a great testimony of the faith of God in his life faithfulness just uh uh an inspiration to each and every one of us amen at 86 he still longing uh just this day uh we told her you can just stay home and just listen because if you can and that you know if you don't feel good no I'm going to church I am going to work so praise the Lord so it's an encouragement and it's good to to be with her amen so praise the Lord tonight and may the Lord uh bless us as we turn our Bible in the Book of John chapter 16 we'll uh begin in verse 12 and 13 it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen it's really different uh when you are in a a live service together with the Saints amen you just can feel the the the presence the leak of fire that each ones brings amen so we are expecting that the holy spirit will come and just anoint the word and just stimulate our heart in the word John chapter 16 verse 20 uh verse 12-13 it says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now because God know the season of your life to reveal his truth to you amen so in verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth truth is come he will guide you into all truth yes for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that he shall speak and he will show you things to come amen so showing things to come is a prophetic Ministry and we know that we are living in that age right now so turn with me in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 verse one and after this I look so after this it means after the seven Church ages has run out because in Revelation chapter 3 the door was closed so in chapter 4 There Was An Open Door and behold the door was opened not on Earth but in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up here and I'll shoot the things which must be Hereafter so this open door was opening of the word that came by the voice of the seventh angel and this door was a door that stood between the Lan and the bright age dispensation so it an Open Door it give us an entrance from Lan Church age into a bride age dispensation amen so an Open Door will give us will bring us somewhere sir because it's an Open Door praise be God so Revelation chap 10 verse 7 a very common scripture but in the days of the voice of the sevenant Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servant the prophet and may the Lord had the bless upon the reading of his word so I will uh title this sermon you may be now see title the sermon when the spirit of Truth is come so before we go to the subject tonight I will just like to read the message is this the sign of the end so it is a question but we know that the answer is in the context of the question now listen close the seventh angel of Revelation 10:7 is the seven Church a messenger so he quote that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished now the sounding forth this message the seventh angel here is sending forth his message to the loudan age notice his type of message now it wasn't to the first Angel second third fourth fifth six but it is in the seventh angel that had this type of message and what type of message was seventh angel his type of message is finishing all the mysteries of God that was written in the book the seventh angel is winding up all the Mysteries that's lay loose ended all out through this organization and denomination the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery and that's what the Bible said finishes The Mystery of the written book so this seventh angel the type of message is winding up all the loose end so there are a lot of mysteries around the seventh angel but this ministry of the seventh angel is to gather those lose ended and reveal the mystery now let's note a few of these Mysteries and if you want to write it down first I'll take what scopel say here in Matthew Chapter 13 so he's using the scopel uh Bible with the references under Matthew Chapter 13 who knows Matthew Chapter 13 I know you know it but when randomly questioned your mind is still progressing what what what is that but we know that Matthew you know it and it's the parable of the sore of the seed amen so all the people gathered together and he told them things in Parables yes parable of the S of the seed he spoke to them many parables and some seed fall to the roadside and the birds so it so we know each and every one of that but it's good to be reminded ad fell on the rocky ground other Fells upon the thorn horns and other fell on good ground and yield fruit and he ended up with he that had an ear let him hear amen so before he quot verse 11 in verse then all the disciple cames to him and asked him why speakest thou in Parables so if we don't know anything about the word we need to come to Jesus Christ and ask if you cannot understand the word you need to ask it will not come to you if you don't ask because you need to seek Him amen first the kingdom of God seek him and you shall find him if you cannot understand the message of the hour I encourage you to read the Bible read the spoken word and when the preacher stand and preach you know exactly where he's going but if you don't read the scripture you don't listen to the message of the hour there's always a question mark in your faces but if you read and hear the message every time a preacher stand here you are in great anticipation knowing that God will always speak to his people amen so they are asking why do you speak in Parables so Jesus Christ answered he answered and said unto him because it is given to you his disciples to you because it is given to you to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but to them it is not given so there are two kinds of people to you the mystery is given to you so given means granted you don't work your way to receive this Revelation it was given it was granted it was bestowed and it is the gift of God knowing alone who you are Hallelujah it give you con confidence it give you strength and you will know no matter what happened in this life do too many tries and testing you know exactly where are you going because he said I am the beginning and I am the ending he knows what you're beginning and he knows what your ending to you it is given to know but to them it was not given amen so what is the difference between you I we and them when it comes to the Physical Realm we are all the same we are born in sin come to the word speaking lies nothing good about us amen yes we have a judgment that the wages of sin is death but by his for knowledge he has an elected people a chosen people it's not by our works it's not by our ability it's not our status in life but by his election he has chosen you Hallelujah before the foundation of the word and he is obligated to reveal the secret mystery that was hidden before the foundation of the world to you it is even to know and you need praise God to claim that you is you tonight why are you in the church tonight because God is going to reveal to you his will because knowing who you are as brother Ron preached last Sunday knowing who you are even when he preached the Myster of Christ revealed when someday when you know who you are then the Rapture will go it's not by by our ability but our struggle by how much we achieve or know our memorize the scripture but it was by revealing by knowing who you [Applause] are knowing alone who you are will give you confidence so it's not looking at the flesh because if we are looking at the flesh no one can be saved amen but God is not looking at the flesh he's looking at his election those who elected before the foundation of the word many are called but few are chosen and you are the Chosen Few to receive the message of the hour many are rejecting the message of the hour and along the way they at first they receive the message of the hour but along the way they're ready hello forsaking the message of the hour but not you you are still here in the midst of your struggle in the midst of your trial in the midst of so much Hallelujah confusion around the message of the hour you are still staying and looking for the re for the revelations of the word of God there is still life bubbling in your heart looking for more of a revelation of the word of God because God is obligated to reveal to you but to them Hallelujah it was hidden because they have ear to hear but they could not hear but they can eye to so this is what brother Ron is praying before we come out of this because before we come out of the pulpit we pray there and he pray that he mention something like that the par speaking Parables and the Mystery was hidden to them but for the bride it is being revealed Hallelujah and we know that he continue here's the mystery a mystery IAH there's a lot of mystery in this world that we can never know and sometimes it blows our mind that mystery that no one can explain about it just like a simple mystery why a cow face North and South while eating grass even science are baffled by that some of the scientist just notice in the Google Earth while they Google it they come up with a cow are facing north or south while eating grass and they cannot explain it and somehow white flowers are growing everywhere and animals some animals can live without oxygen that's that's just a mystery and the other one is how the Argentine ants sustain a colony across three continent the Argentine a the red Aunt they can be found in Europe South America and Asia how did they come to that we don't know and even the prophet said that even the sexual reproduction is more mysterious than the Virgin birth but we are not concerned about this mystery of the word but we want to know is the mystery which is hidden in the word of God he said the mystery is a scripture previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remain despite the Revelation and the greater mystery and the great mystery are so he summarized all this mystery that is being gathered in the last days so is this the time is is the sign of the answer so in paragraph 31 he enumerated all the mystery but I don't need to read it to you tonight for the sake of time but I encourage you to read it and make it your devotion by reading those mystery that he mentioned in the scripture but I want to jump on paragraph 31:2 for our subject so enumerated it and in paragraph 31:2 that some of the Mysteries that this Angel is supposed to wind up all the mysteries of God and I may say this with reverence and not refering myself but referring to the angel of God the serpent SE that's been hidden Mystery all through the years the grace strengthen out not this Grace but real true Grace and brother Steven preaches beautifully during that time amen no such thing as Eternal burning hell to all these Mysteries praise God you'll burn for million of years but anything that was eternal had never beginning or end and hell was created for all these Mysteries so my subject tonight is this one the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did so this will be my subject to tonight and this is one of the Mysteries that we are told we would be known to the end time by the seventh angel but yet it's very misunderstood subject so may God help us to see it clearly as taught by the seventh Angels message and Sometimes When We Touch about certain subject sometimes we are become nervous as if it's so it's so we are walking in a danger Dangerous Ground but we know a message believ the prophet tell us that all the mystery when God reveal it he always reveal it in simplicity so let us calm down and relax we are in a good you are in a good hand not in the hand of brother Mario but in the hand of God tonight so in Revelation 4:1 it speak this door that was open in heaven took place at the junction of time between the Pentecostal age and the bride age and the bright a dispensation of the time that we as believer are living in right now so since the opening of The Seven Seals in 1963 it is important that we recognize the junction of the message of when doctrinal changes took place from Pentecostal Lan Church a teaching to a bride age teaching although brother brother Ron already the uh teach about this subject but it's good to be reminded because a lot of people as as they go on the message of the hour they are uh little by little are going away from the real truth of the message of the hour but it is good to be reminded the direction of the message believer are going in different direction even in the the Old Testament when the messenger was out of the picture the people began to worship different kinds of gods then God sent another Messenger to correct them and go back to the world again then after 40 years when The Messengers pass away then they go back another to a denominational belief then God send another Messenger to return them back that that is how God is so gracious to each and every one of us we fail but he never failed Hallelujah we can run away from the presence of God but he will keep on moving and direct us because when the Holy Spirit come upon us he will guide us he will direct us he will lead us into all truth that's why it's good to be reminded of the word of God and so this is very important for us to understand that when brother bham stated or started as a young Minister he didn't know everything from the begin meaning so when we mentioned about brother bham didn't know anything or didn't know everything a lot of eyebrow are going up what a prophet didn't know anything he was a prophet we know that a prophet was born a prophet but a prophet was born our gifts and callings are without repentance he was born to to be a prophet but the Revelation is a progressive revelation just like when we are born we are born a baby we become an infant we become a child become a teenager adolescent is so Progressive even in the Book of Genesis when God created the Heaven and Earth and there was Darkness God said let there be light let there be let there be let there be let there be so it's a progression of the revelation of Jesus Christ he began his ministry with many things in his own understanding because we know that he started as a Baptist Minister as he always had a testimony that I got my teaching as much I I could scripturally that needed to strengthen out by the real truth of the word and so there was a junction along the way in his ministry when the real true light of the revelation of these hour was revealed and became clear to him and that is also our experience as we walk with the Lord in the light of the message of the hour we didn't know everything when we receive the message of the hour but along the way God is trying to reveal little by little progressively little by little because the message is Progressive amen there are so many issues many issues that we struggle with when we first come to the message of the hour but by God's grace when the Holy Spirit Come he reveals little by little progressively until we come into the maturity of the word of God there is no shortcut we cannot say oh I am old in the message I've been in the message not that's not a qualification the qualification is how much you humble yourself in the presence of God the more you humble yourself the more God reveal himself to you it's not by how long you've been in the message how many messages you you read even if you receive the message of the hour and receive Christ and you humble yourselves and ask God to reveal he will reveal it to you and S the revelation of those who just start are better than those who are been in the message for so long sometime they've been in the message for so long but the end of the day they reject the message of the hour so it's not a guarantee how long you are in the message it's all by the grace of God he will reveal to whom he wants to reveal it and so because of this when people come into the message from Pentecostal background they will naturally bring their Pentecostal understanding over with them so we have the saying that they came out from denomination but their denomination didn't come out from them especially in the Philippines when there was a mystery Expo and and maybe 30 or 40 denominational preachers are attending the message and when the message was expounded they were so excited that what they hear they didn't hear it in their denominational School and they readily accept the message of the hour and they began to preach along the way they see thousands maybe hundred of coats that support their Pentecostal view so any kind of Doctrine you can get quotes from Brother Braham and it creates sometimes confusion among the church because the direction that they are going into is still in their denominational understanding of the message of the hour so a lot of that is happening maybe not only in the Philippines May some other countries those who receive the Pentecostal message and they receive the message and they preach the message in the long run they don't know what direction they are going into amen and they encourage people to have this sensation and feelings the first and second pull of the ministry of brother B to attract the attention of so many people but that is not the message of the hour so but when they start out in the message they are looking at the message mostly through their eye of denominational or Pentecostal background religious bre so that's why they can preach the message and quote the message th to support their views that is why they are able to find maybe thousands of quotes in the message that will seemingly allow them to preach a Pentecostal teaching of the Holy Spirit of byan lisian age within this new land of the message of the hour but they are still using and quoting the prophet's message yet the prophet tell us in many places in the message that we have to die out to that understanding in order to come into the bright age the message the anointed one at the end time in paragraph 158 he said the life keeps advancing on but remember it's in another stage it can't in that stage we can't eat the Carion of other ages we can't eat Pentecostal Carion Methodist or Baptist it's become a Carion we have press food the word of this hour and Carion means decaying flesh of dead animals and also known as carcass we we have a fresh food in this hour so the real fact is that in the message of the hour you can find quotes to support almost kind of false teaching that you could imagine just like what has been done with the Bible over the period of time and we have seen a lot of throughout the years but the true bride will be not be deceived because she will be guided by the Holy Spirit of the inner teacher that is leading her through that mind field of this false teaching that's why the bride cannot be deceived impossible but that is very impossible because the bride is part of the groom and we have the Holy Spirit that will lead us and guide us and direct us into all truth amen so we have to come to realize that breham been start out knowing it all at the beginning you can stumble all you can but we believe that he didn't know everything at the beginning of his ministry it was just by the grace of God he need to experience the scripture that he's reading in his life just like us we need to experience every word of God and the lack of this understanding is what caused many to become confused over the years with certain teaching of the message because when we read the message it is important for us to understand that the revelation of this hours was first a journey of progressive revelation it is a journey to the prophet himself as the Lord will reveal certain truth to him along through the season and experience of his life that's why he can preach boldly because he know all the scripture he experiened through his life we all know that he was born a prophet as I say that gifts and callings are without repentance but the revelation of the word of this hour had to be revealed to him progressively by God and so as the word came to him then it corrected many errors of doctrine that he may have had because of his own human understanding and this is God's pattern for us also in our experience of Life as we walk with the truth of this hour the same experience with our Prophet as we go along with the Scripture it became pler and clearer and clearer amen so there were certain Pentecostal doctrine that were corrected as the message Advance by the opening of the mystery being revealed in our day yes but when a person would come out of Pentecost Church background into the message then they would still be able to find hundred of goates of the message that would allow them to preach Pentecostal Doctrine concept of baptism with the Holy Ghost as a message Doctrine yet the prophet clearly tell us that we are not to bring the doctrine of the Pentecostal age over into the new land of the bright age yes we have something different and we need to recognize that in the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this days yes no sir that was for the Pentecost and this is for the bride going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostal represent that again so he's referring to the asusa Street Experience praise God of the Pentecostal age again we are in the bright age so we are in the age we are in the different age no more than the word of Noah would work in the days of Moses no more than Moses law would work in the time of Paul he tried to tell them you are dead to that and you cannot have that so brother Bram is tell us that this mystery of baptism with the Holy Ghost without sensation would be one of mysteries that he would be revealed in this last age because in the message is this the end of time sir he said the mystery of baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same work that he diden amen so what is the work of Christ yes so the work of Christ was he fulfilled scripture that were written of him for that hour and that was the work that he accomplished remember that there are 47 major prophecy fulfilled in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ that's why when he walk in the in Luke chap 24:25 after his resurrection he meet with the disciples then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken oh not Christ to have suffer these things and enter into glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scripture the things concerning himself amen beginning at Moses and Moses wrote five of the books Genesis Exodus theoy Leviticus praise God and some beginning at Moses in the Book of Genesis then all the prophets from Isaiah Samuel Daniel Zechariah Malachi and Son all those prophecies fulfilled in his life am so is the work that he is doing not only the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ and what is the person of Christ the revealed word in the day that we are living in he is performing the revealed word praise God in he said that that was the work that he accomplished amen amen the word being made manifest and so at the end time the Bride of this hour this is what also called to accomplish as he accomplish the scripture prophecy pertaining to himself then as a bride of Jesus Christ we have scripture and works to do and that is to accomplish the the prophecy that pertain to us there are so many scripture that pertains to the Bride of Jesus CH and one example can be seen in Genesis chapter 24 Rebecca is the typ of the bride and IL there is a type of brother Braham that it introduces to the Unseen groom Isaac which is a type of Christ Hallelujah there must be a Rebecca if there is a Rebecca there must be an elisher that will introduce her to the Unseen brid Grom reaches the Lord Jesus Christ part we are to buit Genesis Chapter 18 Hallelujah and God appeared unto them and discern the heart of Sarah and Abraham and that scripture fulfilling our day amen the word of God made flesh and discern our spirit in these last days hallelujah and we also to fulfill the time of Easter coming into the marriage Union after B they rejected the King which is titled Pentecostal they rejected the invitations of the king yes Hallelujah and was put away by refusing to come into the Pres of being SE refused to be his word b they loud as here they close the door and God is knocking them so we are to also to fulfill the type of Bruth at the Harvest Time who came into Union with Bo as the L of harvest and also Rahab at the time of judgment with the token display who married salmon at the end time all this problem y they are the supernatural element yes although there a Mysteries being revealed this is the supernatural stories element in the scripture Hallelujah that we can see ourselves in the scripture amen and all the scripture must be La out in this hour by by an elected end time people this is a prophecy there must be a people to leave it out who are those people you are those people amen amen and so this the work that Christ is performing in the lives of the elected bride of Jesus Christ these are the supernatural element prophecy stories for this day that Christ was being writing in the story of your life amen Rebecca meting elizer the prophet and introducing us to ISA which is Christ in this life and so this is the third pool Ministry of this hour which is the word of this day being interpreted in human flesh again this is not the first pool the second pool by by Emotion by attracting uh the public this is the third pool which is revealing directly in private through the Bride of Jesus Christ and this is a greater than what the Pentecostal loud this year produced this isn't just baptism of the anointing of the Holy Ghost falling on people but this is the person of Christ fulfilling end time scripture through an elected people and so this is where the real Supernatural work of God has been taking place among the people of God Amen this is not just about anointing but this revealing of the person of Christ to every believer but if you only have a Pentecostal denominational interpretation of what it is to do the words of Jesus by trying to copy some historical event and you try to bring that idea from the loudan side of the door and over into this bright side of the door then you try to mix that old Mana o byan age in the truth of the message of the hour then it won't long before you will encouraging the people to look back to the the first and second full experience of a platform performance of an outward Supernatural attraction am so we need more Revelation and then all you do is bring confusion into the message and we see a lot of them today the direction of the message of the hour is going back into the first and second pool that's why when the spirit of Truth is come he will guide us into all truth and brother bham Ministry but we know that the first and second Ministry of stages performances and big crowd has now passed that's right we are beyond the first and second pool yes of attracting thousands of people we believe in healings and Ministries all that Revival in the in the spirit we believe that but as the Bride of Jesus Christ we are beyond the feeling of Sensations to the word that is being revealed in our day we need to have a clear understanding of the hour and the day that we are living in and recognize who we are because to you it is given to know the mystery of God God is obligated to reveal to you his hidden Mystery he was not trying to bring you to a sensation by feelings or emotion or sensation is trying to bring you to the word of the hour and that word will manifest again in the flesh we know that the first second full ministry of stage performance and big has now passed because we are now living in the bright age of the third po of the prophet's Ministry of where the spirit of Christ is now dealing privately with his bride under a supernatural administration of revealing of himself by the opening of the word and of which there is no public show involved amen that's why we can oh we are not Vindicated because we cannot see speaking Tong we cannot see healings we cannot see Miracles that is not the basis the basis is you have a clear understanding of the word of the hour Allelujah amen all this mystery the M mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person amen of Christ performing in you the same works that he did the word that was being made manifest in Jesus Christ once again will manifest to his bride he will perform it once again in our lives that's why my brother and sister this is a personal revelation if we look at our physical flesh no one can be saved am because all of us are we we all have shortcomings that's why the message should be our is being revealed because the revelation of the world will create rupturing Faith that's right amen we can only be ruptured by the revelation of the word of God not by our works in the flesh because if we look at the flesh no one will be in the rupture there why the prophet said the revelation of knowing who you are then the Rapture will go knowing who you are because flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God even though how much we clean it we take about every day but the next day we take about again because there's this dirty flesh you canot clean how much you toothbrush how much you clean it but the next day you clean it again even though how much you struggle to be to be to be good to be clean to no no no no no just believe the word that's the only thing that he wants you to do believe the word because we cannot do anything within our lives praise God the thing that he has done it is done it is finished I paid it Allen I only required you to believe the word now to struggle to be perfect because Perfection is in the revealed word of the hour if you believe the revealed word is perfect then you are perfect as well so the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same work that he did so we want to look a little bit deeper into the mystery as thought by the message of the hour and she proven it by the word as the Bible truth Amen in Matthew 5:45 I don't know if I can finish this but I I I try to that ye may be children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust so in the message the anointed one at the end time when he preached in 19 65 brother bam tell us that this Reign represent the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost yes that fell on both the just and the unjust and so this was a teaching that was a great Shack to the Pentecostal word of which the Propet mostly is preaching to that's right because it seems so contrary to what the Pentecostal church had always thought and believed they made such a major point on this baptism of the Holy Spirit and now they are being told that it will fall on the both sinner yeah and the saint right it is a great check genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost can fall to the Sinner and to the Saint at the same time yes and so this was such a great contrast to their Pentecostal understanding of being the third work of Grace So in 1965 there was this Junction of truth that was being sent by God to correct the Pentecostal error of understanding God is revealing progressively to the prophet so we need to have this understanding or else we can just compare quotes by quotes fighting quotes by quotes that's right but the prophet said even though how much quot we use when we preach the absolute is still the word of God as the prophet said my absolute is the word of God before we are born before Jesus Christ was born before brother Braham was born the scripture was already done but there is certain time in this age that we need to realize something is happening in our age so in 1965 there was a junction of Truth was being sent by God to correct the Pentecostal error of understanding and so all of a sudden brother abam seems to change the concept of what we always thought was The Ultimate Security of when a person received the baptism of the Holy Ghost anointing that sealed them into the day of redemption yes but then from July 196 my brother bham begin to make statement about the baptism of the Holy Ghost that seems almost completely opposite to what he had taught at the time yes modern events made clear by prophecy notice we find today that people there's many people just can't believe it so in this upper paragraph is he talking about the the the the healing and he said and know we find that people there is many people just can't believe it's even spirit filled people even spirit filled people many people just can't believe it even spirit filled people you can be Spirit-filled but if you don't have have the truth you are on the other side yes if you have the truth and you don't have the spirit you are on the other side that's why we are always in the middle of the road he said we it is now time for us to worship Him in spirit and in truth because they my word they are spirit and they are life notice that he is saying that even spirit filled people can believe the true word this hour I'm going to give you one that'll choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all this will choke the Pentecostal group of people amen this is a hard saying why suddenly he changed he didn't change it by his own but it was the Holy Spirit corrected him not all that don't have anything to do with your soul that's the baptism notice this Junction of truth of the word here of how that brother bam own understanding had began to see with a clearer Crystal understanding that there was difference between the anointing of the Holy Ghost on the spirit of a person and the person of the Holy Ghost of the revelation of the word for their day in a person's soul amen so there's a difference the anointing in the spirit of a man and the revealing of the person of Christ to the soul of men so the person of the Holy Ghost is the revelation of the word for your day which come by the spirit of God leading you progressively into the full word of your hour amen and this is in contrast to the Pentecost and understanding of the anointing of the Holy Ghost Reign that comes by and is recognized by the Association with feeling feeling and sensation so there is a contrast what is the baptism of the anointing of the Holy Ghost that anoints your whole human spirit that anointing is not fake anoint the genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost and brother bam bring scripture to back it up yes because the rain falls to the just and the unjust and the others the baptism of the person of the word what is the person of the word it was Christ by the Revelation in your soul so do you see the difference others the word of the person of the Holy Spirit himself revealing to you the truth of this hour to your soul by Leading you into truth of your day without sensation of the anointing maybe you're are sitting there where the preaching is preaching it just quicken in your soul and you recognize it was God himself speaking to your heart without any sensation or emotion that you feel it just the word that was spoken and Quicken into your heart and you can say Amen to the word of God the preacher is not trying to encourage you to feel something and be no no we just speak the word and if it's the word of this day it will will kick into your heart if you are part of this word you will say Amen to the word because you are responding to your [Applause] theop and so the language Changs of the concept from a Pentecostal age thinking of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to a bright age thinking of the word being revealed by the spirit of God yes so let us make this this clear you can be silenced and listen carefully you do not need the baptis of the Holy Ghost to be saved and go to [Music] heaven because we know that the foolish virgins never receed the Holy Ghost baptism of the oil in their lamb and yet they are saved and can have eternal life yes they asking for o give us more oil we have enough they don't have enough oil in their day they have oil but enough in their age they have don't have any oil to go through but for the Bride of Jesus Christ we are equipped and there are souls under the altar of the Jew in the fifth seal in Revelation 6 that are saved and they never receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and one in Matthew chapter 25 who are good to the bride and they can have eternal life and never have the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet they have eternal life so the message of the hour is so clear amen it is not a cult that we can say oh we are the only we are the only Bri no no no there are a lot of scripture pertains right but there are scripture for the bride there's scripture for everybody because God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but come into eternal life God is so gracious that he is not willing that anyone should perish but come into repentance but for the bride we are special class of people we are not become boastful of it but it's by God's grace and we are bold enough to claim I am an elected of God because my life changed and then on top of this understanding the prophet of this generation teaches that you can actually receive the genuine baptism of the anointing of the Holy Ghost and go on to be lost yes a lot of question but thank God we have a prophet in these last days that the ministry is to wind up all those loen gather together all those loen that create confusion and division Among Us and reveal the truth that's why when the Holy Spirit truth is come he will guide you into all truth in the message leadership the outward expression show exactly what on the inside the kak many of you think I got the baptism of the the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven and many are claiming that I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven I spoke with tongue I have sensation I see a vision I saw that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven yes that's hard say wow no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life yes and still be lost and go to hell yes the Bible said so so he is now beginning to make statement like this because he is seeing with this with greater Clarity than he had ever seen it before yes that the genuine Holy Spirit reain falling on someone is just that it's just an anointing that can fell on person human Spirit but this does not change the seed of what the person is inside their soul Hallelujah so PR is making it clear and so that is why you could have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and you can still be lost but when the same Holy Spirit revealed the word for your day to you then that word is the person himself coming into you the very person of the word of eternal life himself he is never doing away with the anointing of the Holy Ghost but he is trying to show that if that is all you haveen just the anointing on your spirit realm then that is insufficient in this bright age because if you have the wrong teaching of the word in your heart then you will eventually become a false anointed one anointed by the spirit of God but if the word is not yet revealed you can be anointed one false anointed one at the end time we all believe in the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost on wi no one is ever doing away with it but we are not to make the anointing of the spirit our soul object and focus because that was the old Pentecostal lisian age teaching but we are to make the revelation of the word of this hour our object yes of focus yes amen the empasis in this hour has moved from the rain to the seed amen that's why in the message the the seven Church ages when brother Braham inspired by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost speak unto him take up your pen and write amen and send it to the church the same holy ghost that tell John the Beloved in the Book of Revelation amen when the seven Thunder out their voices and when he was about to write the same holy ghost that tell brother take the pen and write the same holy ghost that tell John do not write this John right because it was prepared for the seven Church ages messenger so when the seven Church ages messenger take thy pen and write and send it to the church and the brother quoted Revelation 11 let every seed bring forth of its SK the empasis is not the rain but the emphasis on the word the seed you need to recognize that if you are the sin of God it is written it is spoken so shall it be done no one can take away the Revelation that was already spoken whether you like it or not the time and season of your life will recognize your day and it message you cannot run away from it because the Holy Spirit take your pen and right and send it to the church we have the message of the hour Hallelujah the identification is not on the anointing but on the revealing of the word that you are the seed of God in this last day whether you like it or not the anointing was already spoken and it will Quicken the seed if you're are the seed of God it will bring forth the manifestation of whatever seed you are in you are the seed of God Amen then expect to be Quicken one of these days you may struggle you may run away from this word but it was already spoken and it shall be done whether you like it or not the time and season in your life will come that you will recognize and return to the word of God because it was already [Applause] spoken let every seed bring forth to be kind Hallelujah so I would like to read it he say here's what I'm trying to say the law of reproduction is that each species bring forth of its own kind even according to Genesis 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and herbul in seed and the fruit yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and Dan into a fruit we can see the progression of the seed from seed to plant to fruit yes sir the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in the last day the true church Christ sin that is your identification whatever seed was planted in the day of Pentecost will be the same seed that will be in theia because he said I am the alpha I the Omega what he started he will finish it it is not by your doing but it twice doing it for his chch I am the alpha what I have begin I will finish it at the end it is [Music] done yes sir in this last day the true church Christ SE will come to The Headstone and she will be a super Church super raise as he nears him yes am don't underestimate yourself I cannot make it so it's not for you to make it right he has already done it you have nothing to do but believe what he has done in your life he knows the end from the beginning whatever things that comes our way it works out for our good to them who love him you are a super race it is a declaration don't belittle yourself don't look at your shortcoming because shortcomings will always be here but the message of the hour you are a super race and you need to stand and claim it I am the the super race not because you are good in the flesh because you struggled because you have a status in this life no because you believe the word and that is our standard the word of God word because he is the one who's doing it all we are the seed planted before the foundation of the world and she will be the Super chair super r that she near him they in the bride will be so much like him yes amen wo they will even be in his very image so don't look at your shortcomings today I cannot make it no listen to what he said not to what you feel right not the way you judge yourself right but judge yourself in your heart how much you embrace the word of godallah that is the main purpose in this life not our status in life not our because when we go over there we cannot bring anything from this word whatever character we have right now when this body change will still the same character if you are a doubter of his word you will be a doubter there if you are believer this word you will be a believer and as a Believer you have no option no maybe it's what if no maybe no if you are a Believer you believe whether you understand it or not you believe it that was already done they will the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one how can be how can we be one with God by acing the revelation of the word that was being given to you in this last day that makes you one and how can two walk together if they don't agree if you don't agree with the revelation of the world how can you be one right right we become one by receiving the word that was sent in our day and the one that is revealing is the person of the Holy Ghost himself up doing the works we are doing the works by manifesting the prophecy that was sent in our day we didn't struggle to manifest that word we just believe amen this is in order to be United him there will be one they will be the very manifestation of the Living Word word of the Living God Amen we are the very manifestation that's why we are predestinated unto adoption by Jesus Christ and we know very much that that adoption is you are already a son of a king adoption didn't come from any other Wells you are already son and you are being sent to a teor Amen in order to be adopted May making bring you into your position and our tutor is the Holy Ghost amen he will discourage us when we do wrong he will correct us if we do wrong he will teach us guide us and lead us into all truth then one day the father will say how is my son is he doing well oh no just give me more time he was so stubborn hard to correct always running around give me more time and God is so gracious some of us are so stubbed cannot be corrected they react when they are being corrected but nevertheless God is so gracious just keep on tutoring keep on tutoring amen keep on tutoring then one day the father asked how is my son oh I think he's ready my master CU I see he talk just like you he act just like you he walk just like you he preached the word just like you he quote the word just like you now it is time to put him in his position I have given you the reing the position all those things because we are we are the expressed image of Christ that's why we thank the holy spirit that will guide us our teor and one day unconsciously yes we are manifesting expressing the word of God we become a living epistle real Evol man unconsciously you just walk and talk just like the natural but somebody is looking at you differently and they can say this man talk like different this man talk act like different I don't know what happened to no you are Sons and Daughters of God there are people walking in this day that are fulfilling prophecy in this life day Hallelujah as brother denomination cannot produce this the wrong seed they will produce their qu and dogmas mixed with the word Mong realizing bring forth a hybrid product yes Mong realizing is cross beeding man's idea and the word of God create a hybrid I think I will just close this we are already over time so can we stand if go God's grace we can just continue by guys hallah I don't want to I don't want to make a number but do you want to continue no I know you enjoy it but I gave you something to long for more amen that's why I'll just cut so that you pray you will long for something amen so brother Ron is ready for Sunday let the anointing fall on him God bless you I said give it the bread amen amen thank [Music] you that was not skim [Music] milk that was very good when brother Brenham talks to about baptism of the Holy Ghost according to former thinking he has to correct the ER of the age you understand that loud youa where I feel denominations failed where they organized where Pentecost failed they made this an initial evidence and then he comes out with statements like that and he says it watch you you can have the spirit on your spirit prophesy activate the gifts of the Spirit and he said but it's not in the soul once you are baptized by the holy ghost in the holy of holies and the word sits upon the throne of your [Music] heart let me tell you it's already done [Music] when my wife was praying and she felt led to even pray for herself she laid her hand on herself and she said and this just blew me away but when she said it I totally agree she said I curse this in the name of Sandy Peterson and she said because my name is as good on the check as his that's beginning to understand it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone thank you Lord that thou has opened our eyes of understanding allowed us to understand what predestination and election election is all about and you know what that does that ought to make you
