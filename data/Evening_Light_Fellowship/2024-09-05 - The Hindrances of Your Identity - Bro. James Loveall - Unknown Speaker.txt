evening you can be seated for just a moment God bless you I'm glad I'm in the house amen because I learn more about him and to know him is to love him amen um this coming Sunday I'll be preaching for about 30 minutes or so about a space of a half hour but uh what we're going to do is uh this is going to be the time of brother Neil moer to give his his testimony of what God has done in his life and we have videos we have slides and it's going to be the first time that we have done this presentation and so I want all of you to come here uh I'm sure you're going to be blessed by it and you many of you probably have no idea what he's gone through probably no idea um we are going to take the vote on our deacons and and trustees that have been in position now for uh a year and a half or so so we will be uh taking a vote on this Sunday also the technicians here my sound technicians brother Ruben and his team um and brother Ethan they have told me that um every time we have translations we're going to we have the possibility now to record it and then to put it on the archives so that you could listen to French or Burundi Spanish whatever because if we have it translated even if it's only for one or two here there are others I'm sure that perhaps at home that would love to hear it in French or in Spanish so praise the Lord I saw last Sunday when I went by do you know these are the three translation booths right here if you if you don't know and they can look through the window and look at me or they have a monitor in front of them headphone with a microphone and they can look out and see me or watch it on the um on the screen but I've also uh told my translators that you need to be as anointed as the speaker and you must be consecrated before God so that when you come and you know you come before service prayed up and have the notes if the minister has got uh the scriptures you want to be able to have the scriptures so you if you're translating you just don't you want to be prepared in other words it's there before you we're going to go to 1 Corinthians 5 chapter uh you know and what verses and then if there's quotes of the Prophet you want to be able to read those Len I'm just saying this out loud so that you understand anyone who does the translation because uh if there's a quote of the Prophet you want to be able to as the minister is speaking it you want to be able to uh to say it also to translate it and as you all know that there are in uh in every language there are certain words that perhaps uh might be hard to translate and so the translator would look at that and then he could go ahead and maybe uh in his word dictionary or on some kind of an app hey what does this word mean uh in French or in Burundi or in Spanish or whatever and uh uh so that would be good so I'm looking forward to that I think that uh all of this uh effort that we have been doing for years um we've just done it and when they're finished we didn't have any archive recording we're going to be doing that in fact tonight James love all as far as I know they told me tonight is our inauguration of doing it uh French and doing a live translation uh and uh everything and so uh during the service they're going to come tap me on the shoulder and I'm going to go back and listen also to hear because I'm interested um I want that if we're going to do an effort let's do it whatever you do do ask unto the Lord and do it with your whole heart amen uh and uh there's nothing worse than having a monotone translator the the the minister mind praise God God is a good god uh PR God God is a good god and and hey flat no no no n hey um I think one of the best translators I ever had was brother Gordon tutani from uh Zimbabwe in shaa and let me tell you if I emphasized a certain word he did if I raise my hand he did he was just uh and um there are certain words that if you don't know it's good to to know them and I even this is me when I go overseas is I give my translator my scriptures and I said have it marked in your Bible you guys see these yellow markers here I said you have it marked in your Bible so if you say go to uh Ephesians 4 uh your translator going hold on here a second I know it's in here uh what was that uh what what what the chapter no no no go let's go let's do it and do it with our our whole heart and so anyway giv a little pep talk to all our translators and uh so tonight I believe brother James we're going to be doing that I think I think if everything is going well uh we'll do it so I said James you you are uh the first one that we're going to be doing and then we will archive this and put it uh there so others around the world can listen and if they don't speak English they can get it in a um uh in their language whatever language that we have translated well aren't you excited about that I am I think that hey I think that's wonderful I I see praise the Lord everything that we can do to make it easier and better for the people here at our church that's what we want to do amen and you all know that that when the reason that I archive and we live stream our services is for you in case you can't make it I'm not interested in trying to be a world Pastor uh and all of that and trying to see how many people in countries and different ones that would follow our ministry no it's for you it's for us and sometimes I say things very privately it's to our group brother Brenham would do that with Brenham Tabernacle now he says now you all know I'm speaking to my home church now he said I have to do a little uh maybe five-fold Ministry and uh work work him over a little bit and you know he said as an example he said well the last few weeks I've been going from house to house having to talk to the people because a little gossip a little something was going through the church and different things and so uh no matter what a a Vindicated Ministry of God that you would follow there are always little glitches and little things and um you know so it comes up in every Ministry and so I'm excited to be in church amen and I think on Wednesday nights if we're not careful what happens is we can drag a little bit and it's just church it's formal and yeah we're here and I'm I'm glad that you know and and hey but listen you realize and I told the brethren in the back room I said you realize that I said the Bible says where two or more are gathered there will I be in their midst so if you have the Lord and he's brother Brenham said he will go everywhere he's involed invited so how many of you say I invite the Lord Jesus so now he's come so if he sits in our midst unrecognized or unano or unwelcomed or his he sits with dirty feet you hear the sermon brother Brenham Jesus with dirty feet or the unwelcomed Christ I never want to go to church I never you know I don't want it to become just mechan it's Wednesday night I've had some of the most dynamic services on a Wednesday night amen so I don't want it to just become routine God bless you I think that's about all that I have here uh for this evening so I'm excited oh another thing brother nanded do you guys remember nand from macius yeah o la yeah the Lord willing he uh I think it's October he's going to be over in Denver with uh one of the brothers that I spoke for in the island of rodriges uh small French island over there uh and he's they're going to Denver to be with the pastor over there and then he said brother Ron I'll catch a flight and come over so will uh Lord willing Lord willing so uh would you like to hear Brother nanded yeah he uh I think I'm not going to take up any more time but I'll tell you what the French language is so expressive and it had you know when you talk about God and oh the Amora you know and just it's with expression I love I I love the French language I wish I spoke it brother Mark come up here go I don't want to take any more of your time we have brother James he's waiting

and father we're just asking that Lord you would come and you would break the bread of life to us that you would open our eyes of understanding that father you've given us a word in this day you've given us eyes have to see and Revelation to understand and father as we read through the scriptures and we we hear from your Prophet oh God may you just come and take this very thought and may we place it to the lives father come and have your way this evening and Lord take my inabilities and make him your abilities once again father we're trusting and depending on you once again come and have your way in Jesus precious name amen and amen you love them this evening amen he's a good God if you have your Bibles let's turn to first Thessalonians 5 and 1 and Ephesians 6 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse one it says but of the time times and Seasons Brethren ye need ye have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night what is Paul telling them here that I I don't need to tell you you already know you've already been taught for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as a travail of of a woman with child for they shall not escape and as you think of the travail of a woman there's no escaping that moment when it's upon you it's upon you and I can say that because you know even as we had our first child you begin to prepare very early and you're in this expectation you're in this excitement to have your first child in month in a month in advance you have the bags packed and you got that hospital bag and you're ready but then the second one came and he came early and we weren't ready and there's a different approach to it there's a different attitude that's true but yet let us not get slack am let us not get lazy for when the time comes it will be here there's no escaping it yes very good right but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the bread breastplate of faith and of love and for a helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us unto wrath God has not appointed us unto wrath we have a p purpose we have an appointment with him but he hasn't appointed us to wrath we are children of the light and because we are children of the light but that doesn't mean that we won't go through Dark Places that doesn't mean that we won't go through dark trials true but we are children of the light and for God hath not appointed us unto wrath but obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ let's go over to Ephesians 6 and verse 10 very familiar scripture here Ephesians 6 and10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his mind put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil the Ws the tricks the deceptions of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers against rule the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places you can have your seats this evening now we want to continue on in the same direction and the Lord kind of dealt with us in a different way but it's going to be the same thought but we just changed our title here but we know that God dubsta tells his word that everything we can continue a thought and it can go on and on and on and as brother Mario ministered and brother Ron ministered and you can see a thought in the channel that God would use and we know that as a minister would preach in sermons would go forth that you must identify and you must discern in which that what that minister is speaking to because he will minister to you but then he's also in a way he's speaking either to your to to your flesh man or he's speaking to your your spirit and then you'll have sermons that he comes and he and he preaches pre predestination and an election and choosing and all these and you begin to see that he's ministering unto the soul into your soul so you have have to discern the direction in which he's taken you so this evening for a title I'm going to take the hindrance the hindrances of your identity good and a subject of mending Broken Spirits amen mending Broken Spirits so we see that we have hindrances all around us anything can be a hindrance for us and they might vary from person to person person right something that might bother me might not bother you something that I struggle with you might not struggle with something that hinders me might not hinder you and by definition hindrance is the state of being interfered with held back slow down the state of being hindered a person or a thing that interferes with or slows down the progress of someone or something hindrances can be physical it can be mental they can come spiritually and as we read that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers rulers of the darkness we know that the prophet would teach us that there would be Dimensions we're living in the realm of many dimensions and in the countdown he would say he says now he says we know that there are there's another dimension which is the fourth dimension because science has probed into it and found it and it is the radio there's no senses of our body that can detect radio or Television over that ether wave yet right through us now is coming people's voices right through here is coming television pictures but we have nothing in us no way at all to contact that in ourselves it takes a crystal or some sort a magnet to contact that but it speaks that there's another D Dimension now that's the fourth dimension and we know that even within this room there's waves going radios picture shows and movies and all the these different channels the other day in our house we were we were eating dinner there in the in in the kitchen and and Nolan had a a toy radio in the front room and it's just a toy little toy radio all of a sudden we hear it going off yeah Roger that go ahead we're like what is that little did we know that it was picking up signal of somebody working in that area a little toy radio why because it's a receiver to something that's there we have all these things that are going through this room right now picture shows and movies and ball games and everything but yet we can't fill it with these senses but we have to have a device to tap into that realm we have some have to have a receiver in order to connect with that if we took a cell phone we all have a cell phone but if we took a cell phone this is a way that I can contact those the the YouTubes and the internets and everything that is going on within that realm we can't see it with our physical eyes right we don't know what's going on but it takes a receiver it takes a device to contact that realm yes come on it's no different than there's a a soundboard back there and it's per it's sending out a signal it's sending out a channel it's sending something out but there has to be a receiver on the other end in order to contact it in order to make have a purpose and those soundmen they find a channel that that doesn't have a bunch of voices it doesn't have a bunch of interference in it yeah in order for this microphone to work so I have the receiver on my end and it's traveling back to that soundboard which allows you to hear my voice right what happens if I mute my receiver now's there's interfer there's something interfering it there's something that's come between the connection right so in order for that channel to be open in the microphone for you to hear my voice there must be a channel yes sir there must be a a signal that you're receiving and each one of us has to become a receiver the holy spirit is no different the holy spirit is no different he's looking for somebody to be a receiver this evening not just just to sit on a church pew not just to come and show your attendance and say well I was in church and and I sat there and I raised my hands that's not what it's about but it's coming and being a receiver of what is going forth but you can't let a hindrance you can't let something in your life you can't let something come up because we're going to go through it we have hindrances within our lives within our minds hindrances within the spirit yeah of man that mess up the connection between you and God we're all a work in progress and no matter how long you go in this journey no matter how long you've been working walking this journey whether you're you know you just came into the world or you've been in this message all your life Satan's going to have hindrances that he's going to throw at you he's kind of going to try to deflect your identity and who you are and as I begin to think and study and there was something that came to me and it was have you hit your full potential ask him have you hit your full potential Wow have you hit that full potential you say well what are you talking about are you talking my personal walk being a husband being a wife being a son of God being a minister song leader whatever it is have you hit your full potential I'm talking about it all because it all intertwines one with the other and if you haven't hit your full potential why haven't you right what is hindering you what is holding you back are you too busy at work are you too busy in school are you too busy about the things of the world that you begin to become hindered to that channel that God is trying to speak to you very good and you're a receiver but yet there's an hindrance yes sir 1 John 1 and 5 says this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with the other and the blood of Jesus Christ how many's thankful for the blood there's still Power in the Blood and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen and if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves if you think that you're perfect and you're coming to church and you're faithful and you're doing the things and you you're just going through life and you have no sin because all have fallen short all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but yet each one of us have to Die daily yes sir we fall daily we have to Die daily we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US you see remember the scripture we read of the Ws of the devil what is it to deception I remember a brother he had told me he said James I've gotten to a place in my Christian walk that I whenever I pray I I don't even need to pray for myself no more I just pray for everybody else I don't need no more pray you know I'm I'm focused on praying for everybody else and I said God you know within my heart I said don't ever let me get to that place because I want your help every single day amen I need to pray for myself daily I need God I need to surrender myself to you I need to walk with you I need your help I don't know what tomorrow holds but I Know Who Holds it and if we can surrender ourselves don't ever get to a place where you're you're comfortable because if you're comfortable you're stagnant you're staying still now notice brother brandom I begin to in study and I begin to look into the titles that brother Brandon would use of identification or or Christ identified through all the ages and he would preach 11 sermons on identification or God identified by all his characteristics identified Christ of all the ages I identified with Christ and he would preach us multiple times but what is he telling us in these sermons that he's the same yesterday today and forever as he began in the beginning and he began to condence in down and he began to transform and he began to show himself what is it it's the same Christ and you begin to look at you know the manifestations and as he would walk became man Jesus he says if you've seen me you've seen the father right the works that I do you say you do also that's you identifying yourself with him how important it is for for us as an individual to identify ourselves with this message amen amen you see because identification doesn't come from from a man it doesn't come from just a prophet it doesn't come from being a part of a local church or a pastor your identification doesn't come from your parents or or the person sitting next to you or a friend or a group that's not your identification your identification is personal amen yes yeah it's not based upon knowledge how much you know how much you can quote the quotes how much you can memorize the scriptures cuz the Lord knows I I would fail at that my memory is terrible and that's why we're so dependent upon him is because if it was by the knowledge that we had I would fail as I said your ident identity can only come from a personal Walk With Jesus Christ and what he reveals to you can we pull up the common signs of an identity crisis I begin to look and this is Brother Google there that I just pulled it up so I'm not trying to preach some theology or some you know science or whatever but I took these points from what the world says from a doctor's standpoint of view that if you went through a therapist this is what they're going to tell you they're going to ask you these questions some common signs of identity crisis questioning your character questioning traits that influence your self-perception questioning your purpose or position in life experiencing anxiety and unrest there's a couple more altering your values and inclinations frequently to match the environment or relationship that you're in look at that altering your values yeah if you don't know who you are if you don't know your identification what you're going to do you're going to begin to change your values you begin to get around work friends or school friends and you're going to want to fit in with them good you're going to want to fit in because you know what it's it's awkward to be the the odd men out yeah and you begin to change your values listen back people don't backslide overnight they don't backslide overnight that's right why is it that values begin to slack they begin to lower oh it's not not that big of a deal you have difficulty answering questions about yourself how can you answer about yourself if you don't know who you are right difficulty trusting your ability to make decisions listen it's not Upon Our Own ability no it's not on our own ability when you find the mind of Christ when you find your identification in the word he'll take care of that I begin to look at different Avenues of identity we live in a world that everything is goes off your identification you need ID to get into access to here and there and you need to when you're traveling or now you need it for when you go to Costco why because people are stealing other people's identity they're using other people's identity we're living in that world where you have to have an ID and now we're past the ancient age of just having a a swipe a swipe password or a number password I'm exaggerating a little bit but now we're on to what face identification face identification I don't even need to type in a password to the cell phone no more if it recognizes who I am it opens it it unlocks what belongs to me if it recognizes who I am it I have access to my bank account I have access to everything I have need of right here right come on but if I give it to brother Mark he has no access to what belongs to me on are you understanding it are you tracking there's another identification listen it's a face identification that you must spend time in the word of God and begin to realize this unlocks everything that you have need of and if you don't spend time how many times do you unlock that thing right many of us would be ashamed to say how many times we unlock that phone with face identification but yet we have no face oh it's unrecognized oh it's been a week you can't unlock what belongs to you if you never put in the time face identification we know that we can be influenced into an identity that brother Brandon would take this and that's where I got influenced by because brother Brandon would talk about ones in his day and he would begin to use movie stars and and different things of you know you can influence your kids in a way by allowing the things that they feed on that it might be so innocent but the things that they're feeding on they're getting identity from it and they begin to act like where did you learn to say that where did you get that from and then all of a sudden you're you're in the other room and then you hear it on something that they were watching where are they getting their identity the prophet of God would teach us be very careful be very careful us as parents we have the greatest impact on what your the identity and even the direction in which your kids go yes you begin to to set the very Foundation of who they are why because you're the greatest example of a Christian to them amen you're the greatest example if you show up to church and you're faithful and you put a priority on those the things of God you're putting an emphasis on it and it's showing your kids what you value more yeah true but whenever we begin to put our identity on something else oh son it's okay just do this or just go there what are we doing we have the greatest impact to influence our kids you know that you're your kid's first hero you're your kid's first hero until you give them a reason not to be that's right they're watching every move they want to be just like you how do you know that because I'm going through it right now with Nolan he wants to help in everything you know the other day we we I was out in the garage and he came out there and he began to you know I'm putting together this garage door machine thing and have it all set up nicely you know how you do it and the kids are inside and you separate all the bolts and you you got it all organize that's how I do it separate all sizes yeah Dad I want to help I want to help I want to help and you can see the excitement in his eyes he just wants to be with you he just wants to help you and then if you're not careful you'll quench that because you know what he's over here and he's messing with it and noan stop you messed up my pile don't do this don't do that get over here do this then he's just standing there like what and then he takes one of the bolts and I set it all up and he sits a bolt right down the center of the machine take off the end redo it and I'll say that's where I failed because I snapped you ever snap at somebody and you could see it in their face and you're taking away this drive that this kid has to want to be like you to help you and yet he doesn't even know right and I snap and I yell at him and then I realized what I was doing because we have a way to influence this we have a way to control that because he just wants to help and when you recognize when you fail as a parent and I pulled him over I said buddy thank you so much for helping me thank you for working with me and he was like Yeah Dad that was so fun but yet many times we fail as parents my wife showed me a thing the other day she just said a friendly reminder and it's a good for all us I wish I would have shown it it showed a parent on one side on their cell phone and a parent on the other and a kid with two toys in the middle of them because we're failing our children because many times we get too busy with life and cares of life and and these hindrances within our lives listen friends it's not just about just your Christian walk but it's being a good father and a good mother and a good son and a good teenager right true we have to be careful careful how we inter influence our kids by the things they watch and the things they do you know even with Nolan now he's he's walking around and he wants to be David and Goliath we show him this little show and he he wants to be David and Goliath and so him and I play David and Goliath all the time you got to die and get back up okay now you're David okay now I'm David now you're David but yet it's a cute little story now but let me tell you if I can steal in him some identity that David had back then if I can instill in him something if he can have the faith of David so now he goes to I want to be brave like David yeah you are son you're going to be brave like David why because I know one day he's going to face a Goliath one day he's going to face a bear right one day he's going to have Giants in his life and he's going to need to know how to fight them true you see within uh identity we shouldn't even have to bring it up but you you have fake IDs fake IDs that people use fake IDs are only give you access to places you shouldn't be that's right they give you access to places that you shouldn't even be but yet as I was praying before I came to church he says what about the fake IDs in the message that walk around and they show and they show that they're I'm a Son of God look at I have access to this I want to be like this I want to do this yet they're showing it because they have no real identification of who God is in their life and they're trying to gain access to a to Avenues in their lives maybe they're trying to seek for the Holy Ghost and they come up and they go back and they come up and they go back they come up for healing and they go back and they wonder why what's going on why isn't I why isn't God answering my prayer well how are you living from Monday to Saturday right exactly are you doing the things you you you should be doing are you living a consecrated life yeah are you serving God like you should be because the battle is Raging even when you know who you are even when you have an identification of who you are and what God's called you to and the position you have and the in the placing that you have and you know what you are as you're a male or a female as simple as that is but yet you know who you are you know that God sent a message a messenger to you for this day but yet still people are battling battling with identification yeah let's look in our Bibles judges 16 of a man who lost and you know I'll just share the story well let's turn to judges 16 we know the story of Samson and it came to pass afterwards that he had loved a a woman in the valley of soric whose name was Delilah now I looked up her name even it came to me and her her very name means delicate or she who weakened and the Lords of the Philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see wherein he his great strength lies and by the means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give the every one of us 1100 pieces of silver and Delilah said unto Samson tell me I pray thee wherein thy great strength lies wherein thou mayest be bound to afflict thee and we know the story that she would go through and she would he would tell her if you bind me with seven cords of green cords that that will hold me and then she woke him and said Samson they're upon you and he said well if you bind me with uh seven new ropes that that that'll really hold me then he said if you weave my the locks of my hair look how closer how much closer he's getting pretty soon the Satan's slowly creeping in first it's bind me just bind me with seven cords now seven new ropes now he goes right to the locks of the head he's playing with that Covenant and you play with the Covenant one too many times sir come on you play with a covenant one too many times listen I I I believe and like as I was saying you can have services that preach on predestination and for new and you know and they're all good for us right and I believe them but yet that doesn't mean that you can live any kind of life that you can live any kind of way and when you begin to mess with the Covenant that God has with you you're in danger come you're in danger yes why because that's a very sacred Covenant that God has with you God don't change for nobody amen will you be able to go through grace and mercy yeah possibly and I believe in that but yet many of us are bound by things of self- choices decisions we made as kids or in high school maybe back in our lives he began to play with it and I'm just going to skip to the quote that brother brand says once more he says now Samson gave God his strength to use but he didn't give God his heart he gave his heart to Delilah and gave his strength to God how many times within the church you begin to give God your ability and you say God I'm serving you God God I sing and and I do things for the church and I and I go to church and and I serve you and I've given you my abilities but your heart is still out there God don't care about your abilities amen God don't care about your abilities he cares about your heart because whenever he get you your heart he got your abilities but you've got to surrender soul body Spirit strength in everything you are to the will of God become a prisoner to him you're going to be a prisoner somebody's prisoner you don't belong to yourself you are somebody's prisoner you're either a prisoner of the devil knowing this truth and won't surrender to it or a prisoner to the world and surrender to God one or the other you're either the devil's prisoner to sin or you're the prison you're God's prisoner to righteousness yeah you're one or the other I begin to think as I was going through the story of Samson I wonder what God now play along with me I wonder what God could have done with Samson if he would have stayed in the perfect will of God yeah I wonder what God could have really done with that Covenant or do we look at it as a Bible story that that that's the purpose that Samson that's the why the story is there so we can relate and type you understand where I'm going yeah but what could have God really done with Samson with that Nazarite vow if he would have kept and he wouldn't have gone and married a girl that he wasn't supposed to and then he's you find him sleeping with harlots and then now he's sleeping here with the lla and he falls in love with a worldly girl yet he's still a son yet still God loved him yet in the end he still killed more more soldiers than he did in all his battles and God still used him after all those mistakes after all those failures so you may feel that you know you made a bunch of mistakes and you fell down well if you fell down get back up because there's more war to fight there's more battles to win amen you still got to keep fighting in Acts 22 another story that came to me and it came to pass that I as I journeyed and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon suddenly there was there Shone from Heaven a great light round about me and I fell into the ground and heard a voice saying Saul Saul why P persecutest thou me now listen he sees the light it's all around him he hears a voice and he said and he answered who art thou Lord and he said unto me I am Jesus of now Nazareth whom thou persecuted and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they never heard the voice they seen the light they seen the light and were afraid let me tell you people that see this message and they come and they see the light it's one thing to see the light it's one thing to be afraid of the light but you must hear the voice that is coming behind that light you can believe in the in the prophet and he you know the pillar of fire is over his head and you can believe in that come on but yet you must catch the voice behind that amen yes because if you don't catch the voice what good does it what good does it do you they heard the V or they seen the light and were afraid but they didn't catch the voice they didn't hear the voice of him that spoke unto him and so we see that Saul we know the life that Saul lived he would persecute he would persecute the Christians he would hold the coat that ston stepen and he would come to a place in his life that God you're really choosing me why me why are you choosing me after all that he done they're not even going to accept me into the cities that I go but yet when you meet him when you come in contact with that light when you come in contact with that voice listen it's going to change your whole identity it's going to change your name it's going to change the way you walk it's going to change the way that people perceive you and now we're getting here to this point that as I was studying it kind of went into a different direction identity identify the hindrances within your spirit because we know that in a person you have Body Spirit Soul you're a Trum you have your five senses that contact the flesh but it is your spirit when things go wrong and things happen it is your spirit that is what gets wounded yeah it is your spirit that gets hurt let's read here and knoweth it not he says now this is the outside man is the flesh that's what we look at what we see and it has all five inlets to the body any grammar school child as myself would know there's five senses that control the body c t feel smell and hear and without that you can't touch the body that's the only way you have the body is these five senses skipping down he says now inside of that Spirit which you become when you're born into the Earth the Breath of Life is breathed into him that spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God but it was given or permitted by God it was permitted by God why because we all come through through the sex act we know that wasn't God's provided way so we all come into the world shaped in a sin or shaped in iniquity born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies let's get down to the underline he says there is five inlets to the spirit you can't think with your body you think with your spirit you can't think with your conscience in your body it has no mental faculty at all your body doesn't so so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being because reason doesn't see taste feel smell or hear reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep and you're out your body is laying there dead just like some tonight dead asleep but yet your spirit is still here your spirit is still reasoning There is five senses that controls that inside man that and the last man which is the soul there's only one sense that controls that he says it's free moral agency which you choose or reject he says and now the reason today he says don't forget this now he says what is the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost he says now people can live in this Spirit they can dance in the spirit they can shout in the spirit they can go to church in the spirit they can absolutely have the real Capital spirit of God anointed on that Spirit but still be lost in just as devil possessed as they can be with that Spirit how important is it yeah to identify within the spirit wounded within your spirit this thought came and just because we're Christians doesn't mean that we're we aren't exempt from wounds right that we're exempt from heartache that we exempt from complexes that we're exempt from persecutions or or things that would come from the outside maybe even within our own homes yeah we're not exempt from it trials that make us hard that make us callous you see the past can can can hinder your spirit if you're not dealing with it correctly true because they are lay there dormant what happens to a wound that is not taken care of correctly becomes a scar self-inflicted wounds brother brandham says all right the shepherd can't afford to lose one sheep that's the reason you backslide her tonight he's honking haunting hanging around your heart trying to draw you back to the fold because he once kissed you and you kissed him and told him that you loved him and raised your hands and praised him and you backslid and went out there and got all butchered up and wounded where not in your flesh not in your soul but in your spirit but he still holds holds around you all the time come back wandering sheep I just can't afford to let you go maybe the little sheep that he had to go away out on the mountain to find all through the place maybe you're that sheep tonight laying out there wounded somewhere let me say it doesn't even have to go for the backslider maybe you're sitting here and you've been faithful and you can't seem to get past something in your life you don't know what it is but there's a wound in your spirit there's something deep down that it might be hindering you or and it's holding you back and you don't understand where did this come from why am am I the way I am I don't understand it right and we could take wounds that go back brother brandom would teach us in in throughout his ministry people would come through the prayer lines and he would begin to discern and he would go into that fourth dimension and he would begin to see different things of of this person's life yeah and he would say you were child I see it now you were a child you were chased by a dog yeah that's where this came from that's where this th this sickness came from that's where this fear came from and yet they're an older woman or an older man let's read an example here it says good evening lady a timid Spirit that's the kind usually that's the kind of a little timid time don't have too much to say deep thinker always planning things ahead usually never happens that way though isn't that the way it always is you get all worked up for nothing you keep worrying and worrying how's this going to work out and how am I going to do this and how am I going to go there and you get all sick up in your stomach and you might go through it might be just a job interview or it might be how am I going to talk to this brother you ever wanted to approach your brother or go to somebody and you go sit down with them and you had this it all worked out in your head this this is what I'm going to say and this is how I'm going to say it and you sit down it goes completely opposite and you're like why did I spend all that time worrying about what I should have said and could have said whenever it just comes out naturally you had a great scare once in your life too something seemed like it was when you were a school girl I believe it was a dog or something along I see something bark and go and jump and scream he was just a little child and down comes Life coming down recently you've been real nervous oh yes here's something moving sister I'm sorry yes I believe it's cancer so you see this cancer he be he would begin to discern her heart and begin to talk with her and he begin to show her the sign in the hand and do that the life of the cancer is living off her life but yet this cancer was built up from a nervousness because of when she was a child right each one of us if I mention this there's things in our childhood that we've been through that were that they were wounds then and now there's scars in our minds things that happened to us as a child and you wonder why why do I act the way I act why do I do those things because it was a wound back then I'm going to be open and transparent when I was a child living in Baghdad my parents would have to go to to preset to get groceries or whatever it would be during the day Mom would drop me off at school and say okay I'll be back at the end of the day and I always had this fear that she would crash she wouldn't come home and it was a fear that I would get so worked up and you could even ask her that I would go and sit in the principal's office this is in first second grade whatever it was and I would have this fear and I would get so sick within my body that I'd have to go and sit in the principal's office because I had this fear in my mind what if she doesn't come home what if she crashes and you have all these scenarios that play in your mind I can see them right now and it was a fear that would build up and it would make me sick and I didn't know what it was till years later God began to deal with me and he began to show me and one time he told me he says this is where it came from I've never talked to my mom about it still to this day never brought it up but it was a fear that I had something in my mind what is this coming from when my mom was 18 her mom crashed and died just outside the Baghdad lord said that's where it's from I said that that it doesn't even have anything to do with me but it was this fear and the spirit said she lived that fear because it came out and I didn't even realize that it was something that bothered me all my life or it would go on for years and I would always work myself up yet it takes us back to that moment each one of us have scar the memories wounds within our minds whether we be a child maybe we weren't maybe we had a father who wasn't really a good father and he didn't re raise us right or maybe it was an abusive relationship or you just didn't have that relationship and so you're always longing for a relationship with somebody you're looking for a father figure somebody to lead you to show you the way and these scores or these memories and wounds within our Spirits can be within us if we don't fix them yeah they can lay dormant there for years and it's time out and time again that I would begin to look into this and the prophet would find another uh brother here and he says that all this worry and Gloom and feeling the crazy feeling like you're losing your mind and things like that and he says now I tell you where it started on the pro he says but what really is doing it's a demon It's haunting you is that right he says you have no peace at all day or night it's after you seems like you just get gloomy feelings in there is that right he says yes sir he says worry don't sleep nervous gets up at night is that right he says when you was a child a little boy with knee pants on you got problem comes and with something run he says I believe it's a dog that chased you or something is that right a big dog and you ran to the porch says that's right I see it as a little boy it's the truth he says who would know that but only God but he says that's where it started takes him all the way back to his childhood all the way back to a place even some of these wounds within us we don't even realize that they're there right amen they could be wounds that you were raised in maybe a religious home can I say this there's a difference between religious home a religious home in a Christian Home a religious home because if you're so religious and you crank down on your kids and you can't do this and what does your t-shirt mean and and where did that come from and what is the definition of this and how do you get this and you can take all the the the life out of the kid brother Brandon would take talk about the horse and you can train a horse you take a wild horse but you can beat the spirit out of that horse you don't take the spirit out of it you just give it in a direction to go sir right but yet we can crank this message so tight you can't even live but what good does that do because then you can live in a home that I'm going to shelter my kids I'm going to homeschool and I'm not going to do this and they're going to be so protected what happens when they turn 18 right and they have a choice to go yeah maybe you were a parent and you were raised in a certain way maybe you grew up with uh the less fortunate maybe the Lord started blessing you and you said you know what I'm never going to let my kids live that way I'm going to give them everything they want I'm going to show him everything I'm going to take him everywhere what happens you begin to spoil them if you don't do it the right way you begin to spoil them you make them spoil brats but yet it was because something that this man he might have grown up in maybe a father that he grew up in all his life but then he didn't want his kids to be that way raised in a troubled home raised in a troubled home where maybe the the father doesn't show the love to a mother like he should or to the kids maybe he was raised in a broken home and you don't even know what a a real family looks like and its wounds within your spirit something that's hindering you yeah because you know what's going to happen if you don't handle situations you don't happen you don't handle these things that come to your memory listen I don't have to discern your hearts you're Discerning right now that's right I can sense the spirit of he's taking you back to this memory and that memory showing you where this or that or why I thought this it's true somebody in your home that's what he's doing right now but if you don't handle if you don't take the ointment of the Holy Spirit and put it over that scar if you don't do that wound right now it's going to turn into a scar in your later years then you're going to have your own family or you're you're going to be a grandfather or down down the road somewhere and you're going to be like how did I get here why do I respond this way and it was an untreated wound yeah very good yes choices you make you know choices of the direction of your identity each one of us have choices yeah some of these choices are self-inflicted as I said yeah these wounds are self-inflicted why because you want to fit in or you want to try it or you want to have a testimony listen you don't have to go out there to have a testimony because you know what they that's going out there and trying that you want to go smoke you want to go drink you want to sleep around with girls you want to do those worldly things you know what's going to cause wounds scars things that are going to be brought up in your memory and you're like where did that come from it's true yeah things that you'll have to deal with for the rest of your life because of a choice that you made when you were a teenager true and the access is something hinders you to get something there's other other avenues in order to tap into that realm that you Desiring if you're trying to have access to certain thing and something hinders you and you can't get there what do you do you can get on the web and you can search and you can look up different things you can go places that you shouldn't be why because you're searching for something you're searching for an identity but you can't find your identity out there you see when things happen in our lives they they are wounds and if they're not treated correctly they become scars and as time goes on these scars become callous and hard and these don't happen within the as we we talked about it doesn't happen within the flesh man it doesn't happen within our natural bodies because what happens in our five senses as time goes on you don't feel the pain no more you're not wounded in your flesh at the moment if you get a scar if you get a cut and it's deep you feel the pain you feel it there but at as time goes on you don't feel it no more there but there's a scar and where are you wounded in your mind because you can remember that scar it's true you can remember you can pull up the pain that it w was the experience the memory yeah Isaiah 53 and 5 musicians come but he was wounded for our transgression and he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen amen we need the ointment of the Holy Spirit to come and to wash us and to cleanse us and to show us those scars to show us those wounds within our spirit amen to menend the Brokenhearted to menend those things that are so deep down in our lives that we don't real realize they have an impact on our lives but they do if they're not handled correctly why does the Bible say in Ezekiel 36 a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put in you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit in you yes and cause you to walk in my statutes that you may keep my judgments and do them that's the identity I want to identify with that's the spirit I want to have one that he can come he's a good father he's a good God I know it's a Wednesday night but I know that there's things within our lives that if we're not careful we just push it aside and don't think much of it identity is an important [Music] thing convinced and concerned he says a man has got to be convinced first and the only convincing thing is that the only convincing thing is the manifestation or the identity of the Gospel being identified in you he says when you see that you have come passed from Death unto life and become a new cre creature in Christ Jesus that's the identity of the Holy Spirit that's the identity of the holy spirit says there's a genuine Holy Ghost there's a genuine holy spirit Spirit of God there is a genuine power of God there is a Son of God that's reflecting himself tonight is the spirit of God to show forth his life he's standing here tonight in the midst of you in the form of the Holy Spirit to pound out all the dross out of you the doubt and reflect to you his resurrection that he's not dead that he is here to show you that he's living the same yesterday today and forever he is here to identify himself with us should we not then identify ourselves with him to believe his word and to take it let's stand tonight you see identification is a powerful thing Satan's going to put hindrances within your life he's going to put things within your spirit things that are going to come against you to hinder from you from coming to the full identity of who you are identification is personal it's a powerful thing because when you know who you are you know your placing let's just bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we humble ourselves in your [Music] presence Lord as your Prophet would identify down through his ministry he would take ones that would come up for prayer and he would say let's take it back to your childhood let's take it back to your teenage years maybe you've seen something you shouldn't have maybe you did something you shouldn't have and now it's caused his sickness it's caused this fear over your life it's caused you to do things that you you didn't think you would do if you ask the if you ask the bum on the side of the road if you ask the prostitute on the street and you said where would you be in 20 years they never thought that they would be there how did they get there they lost who they were who they lost their identity and we're in identity crisis this world is falling apart but yet we're so thankful that you sent your word and you mended the hearts of your people father that you can send the the Holy Spirit down and you can nurture those those wounds within our lives things that father maybe we've seen or memories we've had God and we put them under the blood of Jesus Christ and we say Satan we rebuke you we take away those fears those anxieties those persecutions the things within our minds oh god father we know that you are you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord I know that you put it on my heart for a reason I know there's broken people I know there's Broken Spirits amongst us ones that are going through trials ones that are going through hardness and father we're just asking that you would come and be their portion father would you lift them up would you encourage them oh God in the privacy Lord
