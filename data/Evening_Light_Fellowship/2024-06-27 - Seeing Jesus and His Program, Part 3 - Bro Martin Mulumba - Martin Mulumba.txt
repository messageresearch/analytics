him all the praise is unto him that's right we thank him for the life the strength the understanding the Revelation the opening while the world is dying around us yes but we can come and selected people who were under consideration to see these things amen all the glory all the honor unto him tonight amen glory be to him Lord amen such a wonderful and privilege to be found in his presence amen because blessed is the man that the Lord chooseth to come in his presence because many can be gathered in a real uh human realm and we standing we seeing the neighbor next to him but when we are able to be lifted up in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus it's not just Revelation but Visions too we want to see him that's right and his program because that's where Esther stepped into into a place where the outside teacher could not tell her anything but all the instructions were given to her to lead her Faithfully in into that communion and into that presence she's not there wondering is that him what form is it taking form like is it the prophet is it the man is it the minister no she knows who he is amen because he wants to be known in all the forms and shapes that he reveals himself into just like uh any married uh a girl cting a boy he only knows she only knows him in the form of suit and ties and when they come to church but after the wedding then she start discovering all the other forms all the t-shirts all the underwar all the mood swings how it snows at night all these things are not just Revelation I heard and I read about this and people told me about this no experience amen she's stepping in there amen shall we pray Heavenly Father such a time to be found once again in thy presence to step L father God like he John up higher come up let me see show you things that are to come because I jesus if I sent my angel to show these things to the churches thank you Lord while Lord father God the Roman system Lord was covering the land and putting him Lord father God in a Island full of snakes and all diabolic Powers but Lord despite Lord father God the environment like Mary in a very corrupted land but she was able father God to stand virgin Lord and Lord father God in this hour to find Lord father God wife that is Lord father God unadulterated taking the word just as it was given unto her because L father God this is Lord father God will bring the conception and bring out Lord the expected son Lord father such a Time Lord father to be found into looking L father God to the Unseen once again tonight knowing Lord that you are the provider you are Jehovah jarra

coming in the presence Lord father God of a minister of a pastor of a audience Lord we want to see Jesus and his program once again Lord we're looking away unto you Thanksgiving tonight in Jesus Christ's name amen amen hallelujah may God bless you tonight it is a privilege to be found in the house of the Lord amen while we still standing let take our Bibles in the book of First Kings chapter 19 uh verse 19- 21 try uh to save us sometimes thank you musicians I always forget you but I believe at this time I'm trying to uh catch up on these things by God's grace uh first king 19:19 so he departed then uh that's Elijah and found Elisha the son of uh shafat who was plowing uh with 12 to yoke of oxen before him and um he with with the 12 and Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle up and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled the flesh with the instrument of The Oxen and gave unto the people and they did it then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered unto him may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated uh once again thank you brother Ron uh for the opportunity uh thank you uh Church of the Living God to come uh to the service tonight uh so we can uh spend the time in his presence in fellowshipping with the word uh but God grace we are still continuing with uh this series of uh seeing Jesus and his program uh and also we'll try to uh make a little bit of uh step uh forward of um accessing the word or access to the word uh got a little bit a few questions on uh the act the way we were accessing communism and because um we think that uh many things have been preached and people focus on certain areas in the message uh and at times when you go back to the prophet but it still seems like you know we never heard this but but it's still in the message uh but by God's grace um it's been um wonderful very very great blessing to me because uh at times when we finish to preach here it's we get more than we can bring and otherwise we'll spend probably a year or two just on one on one stage and it's not good but it's just like you know give these a little things that's why I think the Lord's leading me to give the way to be able to access the word so that some of these things that when we holding this language it may not be so hard to understand for those who are coming up but also for the ones that are seeing it right away may God bless you but we laboring on the field understanding that you know it's on different level so at times like you know we can focus on the grown ones and we focus on the younger ones and at times we just keep a balancing between according to his leadership of course as he wants the things to be accessed um seeing that we started with uh um still on seeing Jesus and his program uh seeing that communism as the prophet has been showing it unto us since 49 as he had seen it glooming upon the Earth and later on he saw it two3 of the world going into uh communism and we had also seen that um communism is not just the political system that uh came out of Russia because we understand that um the God gave the prophet the understanding the vision uh the seven Visions all the seven Visions uh showing um naism and fascism to be swallowed up um into the third which is communism which actually happened as we look into history uh around the um the third third war and uh that's where the whole uh communism thing started going around the globe and all these things but at the end of the day the way we access the word is not just by looking at history because when we just look at history we can see out there on the field on the land that people have access to history they read all kind of things and they come up with all type of conclusions they say like you know oh Christian it is uh is the worst things that ever happened to humanity because um they are the ones the Protestants and the Pentecostals all of them they were free m because uh U the way they presenting things they have access to knowledge but it required the prophet to come and give us the access to see how to look at all that information because he says that hey I don't believe everything I read but it's according to the Lord who comes down and shows to me how to be able to look at those events because when you look at for instance in the book of uh uh the church ages it says that you know uh when uh the Greece Greek were um building the temples it says like you know to me this was the age where they were uh pouring a lot of uh the connection the deeding and and all these connections the way he was laying it and bringing the types of a normal life somebody just goes to work and comes back and he tells them like no no that's communism how come somebody going to work and coming back it's communism it was such a mystery people couldn't access it people couldn't understand how communism could just be the fact of somebody working up and going work but then by God's grace that's why we try to see on how to be able to access the word because all these things that we have in the message it's not meant to bring all type of doctrines as we see today because the way somebody have seen it along the years that you'll probably noce it in the way somebody preaches the way he presented he presents his sermon the way he leads his church is because he has focused his ministry on certain quotations and when he does that it then limits his view on how to be able to move onto the next stage of the ministry that's why even my first sermon here on the pulpit was the work of the ministry it sounded as a harsh sermon on the first time that somebody comes on the pulpit but normally that's not the point the access here is we're looking at what the prophet has brought the key that he has given to us and that will apply to every single one of us Church individual families and then everyone should be able to see on how to move forward but then like you know when we preach for instance against like you know women you shouldn't put those extension high heels and stuff and you should have long dresses to one that can feel as it's a law but instead it's not a law because we're not here to preach the law but when you understand your ministry then you understand that this portion of the word applies to my Ministry of this stage to unlock the next stage because God cannot take you from justification into sanctification if you do not believe him yet because he can't start pulling certain things out of your life if you don't know how to believe him because any body that comes to God must first believe that he is and believe his faith and it's in that stage of justification that somebody comes through the door and you become by faith believing that he has called me because no man can come to me unless the father draws him first and this drawing is justification is you not even yet Sanctified but then when we preaching about your ministry about like you know hey understand you don't need this let's go of this but then you holding up that only shows up that your faith is not anchored yet because Faith must be anchored into the veil believing that the sacrifice that was laay down for that your sins is not your doing but is the work that he did that brings you and gives you the power to be able to walk into your sanctification am because when Martin Luther came he understood he said the just shall live by faith and the believer coming in must have that understanding that it's not me doing then if I am under his leadership if I believe that he is if I believe in the perfect sacrifice that he laid for my life it's no more I that liveth but he that liveth in me and as he is lead leading me he cannot just be your savior but he also has to be your lord and by him not being your lord he can't tell you anything he can save you of course but he has a program for your Earthly Journey because you were elected called anointed and you have to be placed and this placement lays down the program that you have to go through let it be a church let it be uh a nation let it be a a family Let It Be an individual and the understanding on knowing how to access the word and how to approach him because Esther found him herself in under the leadership of Modi she came along understanding believing tell me more let me receive let me have access to this because by the time that mod is taken out of the scene beyond the curon of time now she has to know on how to access on how to dress on how to present herself before the king otherwise it's just a church attendance oh we have to go to church oh I'll show up whenever I want I'll do it this the way I need it to be done no but you as Phillip God can use your ministry leaving the whole congregation and leading you right there in the wilderness for specific work but Phillip is unable to come to that understanding if he had not believed that the word was with God the word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and this word dwelling Among Us is not some human understanding some human thoughts I say like oh he's a he's from Kentucky oh I don't think like you know he knew what he was talking about that will limit the access to the program of God Amen because faith is the very Foundation of everything because faith is the Revelation Revelation as I've said it before is God the spirit of God coming down in the form of Angel giving us more information in order to understand and better receive it and if we are unable now to stay under that leadership then we find ourselves in all kind of situations I believe this I don't believe this you can't say it that way we only we have only seen it this way but it required that it required the understanding of the sacrifice that's what first king is showing us here Elijah that we have seen coming down going into the cave the Lord tells him what what are you doing here he said I am left all alone the Lord said like that's your mind take away your mind I have a 7,000 more out there that have not bowed down to these things here and we had seen the mystery of je coming in in the form of Communism how we brought it into this day in the history of America that Martin Luther King who was a leader brother Bram show us that this guy who was supposed to be the leader of the crowd but this guy didn't misunderstand the whole portion of the word that there was also Elijah in his day that he is supposed to go and sit under the ministry because himself Elijah wanted to he said if I could just get to speak with him for him to understand for him to see what is happening in the land he said like you know these are spiritual things it requires the Holy Ghost for you to see it that's right because when communism was Finding its way among the people some people say like you know oh this only affected the black families in America some people say like you know oh this is only concerns the minority but until then the world comes the prophet starts showing to us he said like you know 2/3 of the world is under communism to third that was back then and later on you say like the whole world is covered by it and how do we see it brother start showing us as we had seen previously that he start bringing what is communism what is this all about we know that communism brother bam tells us we have the quotation brother bam showing us that communism is Russia will come and strike the us and we'll do all these things here but that was another layer that they start dealing with after 55 because you have to understand that as Elijah is coming through it didn't just come start with the the Teaching Ministry but as is coming through with the Evangelical or healing campaigns throughout those times he's now laying seeds amen he's putting these things in the places so that in proper time those children who says like you know after my departure you start seeing these things will go in those places and start picking them up and say like look where we coming from look at what is happening Among Us pay attention to this let not just have a conceptual mindset of saying we are the bride and all these things while communism has find its way in the church among the people because if we unable to say this then at the end of the day brother Bram says then we find ourselves saying Lord have I not preached have I not like you know been this year say like you know I never knew you what is knowing is coming into is leading and this leading is not you thinking but it's him coming into you and thinking your in your Stead because that's the world we liveing in now I think this way I think this way I have my opinions I I think this way I'm the I I'm entitled to do this I you can tell me what to do that's human perspective of things but then when now we are lifted up in Heavenly places not just in the realm of Revelation but also in Vision we seeing him face to face then it start showing us like you know look at what is happening in the land look at how all this families we last sermon we saw it but said like you know we are the reason why that our old the standard of the church is broken down because we have taken our own mindset and put it mix it up with the word thinking that we have received the word but we are only tearing it so that it fits our condition amen we find quotations of course oh look at look at brother brother brunham and sister mid the way they're dressing of course you'll find it because your mind is able to still work and be able to find those examples but until the five requirements to receive the revelations are met then now you able now to start seeing it's not you thinking it's not you Desiring for you to receive it the way you thought to be received right because when he comes down to you he he start now showing you places that you never thought to be looked at before because what we have known all this time about communism it's just like you know Russia will come Russia will do this but brother say we are whole bunch of communist and Martin Luther King who was supposed to be the leader this is not a pagan he's not a backslider this is a minister with a big audience this is a father a mother this is a pastor leading a church but not knowing that it is communist inspired amen and while all these things are standing before us we should be conscious what we doing what are we following where are we going and that's why the Lord by his grace who loves these people is said like you know let me show you these things come up up a little higher let me show you the things that to come but then it requires these people now to be obedient amen and that's why he says here it said like you know when Elijah departed it said like you know come let me th the mantle upon you now it's Elijah's choice now to either take the mantle or to reject it or to tailor it according to his own faith because usually when the mental comes upon us it's big it doesn't feed us and if it's too small that means we're big oh I know I I know the whole word I've read all the message are you you can't tell me anything of course you're too big but then for you to be able to sit at the table right the robe must fit you must be able to be anointed by the Rob but then if we bring our own Rob to or find our own ways to get access into the banquet then they will ask you but the robe that we supposed to have in this part brings everybody to the same level how come you still think as a communist how come you think that you still like Nimrod lifting yourself above the stars of God how come you are found in this Gathering and you're still despising others because the fellow didn't understand the law of faith didn't understand the perfect sacrifice because he thought that the fact that he comes into the congregation because remember in job one it shows us that the fellow came into the presence of God where you from said I was wandering the earth oh so you just wandering left and right and you still able to come into His presence of course you can you've been running back and forth and without prayer without without anything and you just show up to church of course you will because we're two or three are guarded in his name is in the midst thereof that's right and when he's in the midst thereof the four fellow that comes over just wondering without understanding he finds himself like Moses before the the the the burning bush I'll just come however I want with my sandals on I with my ideas and I'll just do whatever I want he said no that that's not how you access the word that's not how you come into His presence you need to remove your sandals you need to remove this because when you understand that hey my justification is not because I've done anything but because he had done the work and I am accepted in the Beloved and being accepted in the Beloved is not oh you know I've read all this quotation left and right I have my quotations on my sermon I'll come this way and I'll present it this way no he like to skip on the mountains start from the first first quotation jump to the last one and flip it around and before you know it oh I never seen it that way even even if I had prepared a sermon but then intellectualism right is Introduction development give examples conclusions let let us pray that's human mind but he wants to skip on the mountains he wants to address the younger ones he wants to address the older ones he wants to do the things that the way he wants it if you come with your prayer card in your hand he wants to leave you there he wants to address the need of the one the other one pulling by faith because he's believing but he faith is not still not yet there andam say many times it's even the unbelievers that get healed more than the Believers because they don't understand the approach they don't understand how to access the word it's not human intellect oh he said this quotation how do I understand this does disconnect to this year no right faith is the Revelation amen and it takes you up there yes sir and Elijah came he found him looked at him said what are we doing here I said like you know follow me and he understood they need to go and separate himself from his families from his old culture oh we me Mexicans we do this and this is the way we've been doing it for centuries like you know we Africans and all this this is what we seen with Nimrod coming and conquering the land and cultures and all these things here oh you congol you play this music here I'm thankful to the Lord that he's opening even further these things into music I never seen music like that I said even in the church people playing all this kind of music but bringing all type of anointing things of course even the prophet would say I said I'm so grateful for you Spanish people I don't even understand the words but I know the spirit is Right amen what with that way of playing music and the colored woman came and start beating the whole thing as a Baptist man mindset Baptist mindset they said like you know oh look he he she want they want to turn my church into a Tavern but before he knows it the spirit comes like you know stand up go up there he start he started dancing with her in the church I said like you know all these are quotations that we have but then when it start opening it then it start showing us even further how come the fellow guy who rides peace in the valley and he sends you to go look at the life of the one who wrot it and you get stumbled said like this is the one who wrote peace in the valley how come the Lord just didn't go and use one of the cleanest and purest person right there in the church how come Amazing Grace was G was written by a a person that was going out there and buying slave and selling them away but then if we bunch of communist you know oh these people with all the racism oh you know people this is that they say like you know because you don't know how to access the word because we don't know how to access the word as I say like you know racism in America is one of the greatest issue people have it in in all types of forms but then the Lord said you know don't worry it's communism because they think because Fascism and nism will be swallowed up I said it be before because when I'm if I'm a communist how just say like you know oh we are all together everything is good by God's grace and all these things but underneath I'm a fashist I'm a nist that's what the word is showing us and this F communism brother Bram brought it even further and said like you know look how these mothers they're leaving their babies to the babysit in the name of having a false hope of a better life they go to work they work so hard but before they know it that whole generation is all destroyed but what I'm saying you leave those CH those children alone you find that very soon they become a bunch of neurotics but she couldn't see that in her Ministry because she couldn't believe him at first because she thought that I'll just go to church and I'll just listen to a sermon I'll pick up some quotations and and defend my position to go to work without understanding her Ministry without seeing how communism will come in [Applause] today because the definition of communism is all of us classless people no God wants classes right that's right he he wants the archangels the cherubin and everybody else the highest Authority the pastor in the church he wants the deacons he wants the ashers he wants all those class of people in order to bring out his program right that's right oh Pastor what you say I don't believe you oh brother I don't I don't look at it that way of course until you get a hold of him then he will start proving all things he'll bring all scriptures to your remembrance thank you Lord it's not just a part of it because when we take a part of it we run with it but you don't see all the distractions that you're doing because of a false ham says because of the extra dollar she's looking for before she knows it she found herself like you know doing all kind of things oh I work too you should also help with the dishes amen but then when she was taking her vow in The Vow didn't say that you she was going to do that but then if that be true for her to be doing be found in that position then she had to know how to bring all scriptures into fulfillment because Esther labored after the Reapers with the Reapers but as soon she found herself at the feet of Bas he said I cast all my car upon you accessing the word not just quotations like I can do this I can do that I know brother say this oh we know you know amen but knowing how to access the word and it doesn't come overnight it doesn't come overnight but then we're bringing faith in his place so that each one of us will be able to go back say Lord you have a program and I need to access it and I believe the perfect sacrifice and this sacrifice Will Lead Me Faithfully into your program because he said to I believe Mar said m m you always carried by all kind of work and things but she has chosen the proper thing you need to have the most needful thing sit down at the feet and learn sit down and be able to know how to access the word Abraham I'm giving you the land understand on how to explore the land how to access the word and he wants you there at his feet that's right he want to there like John on his bosom learning dly and Elisha the same he come in his presence so like you know understand all this nimod series let me now go after you and the Bible says that he ministered unto him he labored with him because he knows I've seen this fellow's ministry i' I have the 1200 tapes I can see where he start Ed how he came about and all these things I've heard the demonstration on the mountain are all this false denomination all these things were brought down how the the prophecy of the seventh Vision came about how things are going to happen I'm seeing how all these things are happening but then what about me oh I know Russia is doing this I know the United States is doomed what about me what am I doing am I just going to church am I just embracing another sermon and say oh I I heard of someone today oh God bless you brother oh brother didn't understand this here we become acquainted with it we want it intellectual we want it in a form of like you know amen glory be to God Amen we are the bride but then when we turn we turn into communism and we're destroying the Next Generation without even realizing it but then when we are conscious just like Joshua say like I am my household We Shall Serve the Lord and dis serving like Elisha sitting at his feet understanding what what are we doing at what season what what is happening in the land just as our precious pastors have been showing it all over the world world and the the the the all the elders were going and stuff why are they leaving us for us to go back into Egypt for us to cross the Jordan under sanctification and say oh we are satisfi this journey oh I don't cheat to my I don't cheat my husband I'm faithful to my wife and all this year I don't think really going into the promised land is necessary for me to go in like the tribe of of done no because we understand God's program came from Genesis 15 I said come out I'll show you the land I'm laying the sacrifice I'm giving you the alliance I'm giving you the promise that this whole land have I given to thee and this seed shall possess this whole land do you know the land do we know the land question as a deacon do I know my land holding the mystery of the faith I am only a deacon for this such a group I am only a minister for such a group if it's not that nism and fascism tell me what it is tell me not that tell me what it is because all these things we see them in the word and then when we lift our faces then we understand who is who amen because William brandham stood on the pulit and said like you know I'm looking at you I don't know who you are I don't know where you came from I don't know what's wrong with you but I'm waiting for him to come down and when he comes down he will tell me exactly what's going on with you and when the word opens up what do we see we want to see Jesus in all the forms as a mother we want to see him as a father we want to see him because the word will respond to the word but then if the church has to move according to the word it has to respond with the word with everything that's in the word Lord you know I'm being in this season for this reason but I know the process that will take you have to know let me not get into another angle as I was showing it to the brothers in uh presc last Sunday I said like you know you have to know if it's your first age your second your third and your fourth and the fifth and if you under Reformation of things you have to know that's why Psalm 957 say for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand he's leading us today if ye will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation as in the day of the Temptation in the wilderness he's showing them I have a program I brought you out but you need to listen amen you need to to pay attention to the word am watch the word but we want to show watch the statistics and who pays the ties better who doesn't pay the ties and all these things here but then I'll read you the quotation but says that until you get into that place then now you start seeing things differently than they you the way you used to be because that's basically the whole responsibility that's basically the whole point of the whole series is to bring Elisha to understand his position what he's supposed to do and how he's supposed to address it but before he's able to do that he needs to learn himself first on how either to shrink in the robe or grow in the robe because when you get fitted in the robe then the robe now start moving that's because a little child you give him your his father's shirt he will wear it it's very big make a step and then it start falling into it right you just like you know putting out coat and quot this and qu that you know oh Pastor don't believe this pastor don't believe that before you know it you hurting yourself amen butam is wrong here we don't really believe this here he he still making mistakes oh keep having your mind before you know it you on the first Pew middle Pew back outside there and you on the streets that's right it's a simple principle it's either we moving forward or we try to think that you know we're progressing at a regressing rate amen I come to church I listen but I don't really obey it we are progressing but a regression rate I don't really like when I listen to this today I don't really think like you know that tipe is really has a has a clear sound it's not really clear I don't want to put myself into that but then when now the sacrifice is enjoyed to labor to stay under it then it start opening up Elijah Elisha I can see Elisha watching him every move he made that's the only way he was ever going to get the blessing he was getting the blessing is when he watched him keeping his eyes upon him he said kept his eyes upon him keep your eyes on Christ don't look at how don't look to how sick you are or what the doctor said look at what Christ said keep your eye keep your eye wi right there believe what he said he wants that faith in because even William Bram he told him what are you waiting for a vision for the whole point of your ministry of Malachi 4 it's not that I will send you Elijah the prophet to start telling you Vision Vision Visions I will send you Elijah to do what to restore the faith and he wants people to believe him the very same principle that started the journey is the very same principle that will finish it am you came by faith and You raptured by faith I believe I'll be there I'm saved by faith I'm following his program by faith it's not a statistic like you know I see my children this way oh my children are wearing Dre and my oh those oh the the neighbors I don't want you with the neighbors you know but ROM say the Lord has ways to show me things you say oh just be kind with them just say God bless you and stop there and those same Spirits are still around us today amen inside we holding fascism Nation ISM but we are just communist but then when the word comes down then it start showing us watch here my brother watch there my sister welome this place here because this is limiting your access to the word you're not believing him butam says I try to speed up so I can close here in a little bit it says this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the Revelation for out of the ages comes the seals and out of the seals comes the trumpets and out of the trumpets comes the veils like the birst of a Roman Candle the church ages comes with a mighty illumination without which there could be no further light he's giving us the key on how to access the word we have all the 1200 messages but we need to know how to access the word that's why we have all these doctrines and people who grew under those doctrines we believe this way and times you say like you know have you ever taken the time to sit down with him to get into the field to labor after the Reapers because when we labor after the Reapers you are hearing me tonight but that's not enough that will not cover everything but I'm pointing to specific places to awaken our mind that our spiritual laziness should not be justified to the fact that we going to church but it should awaken us to labor because when it comes and say like you know who is the lady it's said like you know oh I've heard the great report of you you come to church that's fine but let me take you where to find the bread and the vinegar watch the principle every single person that ever come into the presence of him it takes him first to the sacrifice Elisha comes to the sacrifice he's able to walk away from all his doctrines and culture and all these things based upon the sacrifice Revelation comes first by opening with the sacrifice Leviticus 23 opens up with the sacrifice Exodus 3 begins with the sacrifice and this sacrifice is the same sacrifice that now start changing forms we call it in one stage the first pool we call it into another the second pool we call it the third pool but it's still the same person but just revealing even more information giving us more understanding but then it requires Faith to believe him to follow him and he says that these Church ages because Revelation opens up first I am Jesus who was alive dead but live forever more and this living but says on his Earthly Journey it couldn't tell because the disciple wanted to know when are these things going to come not even the son knows because it is a mystery hidden but bam says this was not revealed to him until his death and Resurrection now the whole thing comes open right then the whole world sits down and say like you know John had probably had had bad supper the things that he wor he didn't didn't know what he was talking about but then glory be to God that we receive Elijah who comes to us and tells us begins with the church ages without which there could be no further light amen but nobody knows how to access it come down and sit down let me teach you and that teaching says like you know I want people to have this book the angel said like you know the first sentence on the tapes we have we are we testing some new gadgets why people need to have access to the material to the message so they know how to go through it because in many places that he went Africa and uh uh Germany and Canada and many of these places we don't have the recordings but it pleased the Lord to know exactly what we will need have them recorded in whatever shape of form whatever state that there is now he wants you now to get to work he wants you not to get to work you're not getting into the field just like anyhow we need to have the pieces of the puzzle but we also need the picture of the puzzle because at the end when you put all the pieces together it must reflect the picture of the puzzle otherwise we ending up with people like I don't believe this this message is wrong oh that means you never had the picture to begin with and it's giving us that the picture he said out of the edges comes the seals out of the seals the trumpet out the trumpets the the veils it's not like after the church ages you have no after the seals out of the ages you have the seals amen out of the seals you have the trumpets then we start throwing things left and right and this and that and but by God's grace he's giving us the light he's giving us the key he said like you know otherwi there could be no further light he said light upon light follows until the whole of the Revelation opens up wide before our wondering eyes as you we are growing under the mantle you say I never looked at it this before I never seen communism this way before because is opening the whole Revelation it's not just speaking about Russia being commun the communist country or Cuba being the communist country but then it's start now showing us like you look out the whole world now we call it into a feminist movement the place of the woman and all the these things here said like you know the place of a woman is in the kitchen and then they get all bumped up say oh you telling a woman a modern woman to stay in the kitchen because you don't sit at his feet to understand that the kitchen is a Ministry amen because this I'm I can't go into all these places but I'm just giving us the key to be able to sit at his feet and start drinking it down into each one of us into our Ministries because brother bham shows us clearly Suzanne Wesley with 17 children she just didn't sit there just cleaning the dishes and all these things come on and Bam shows us clearly that today you have all these tools to help you and stuff but we unable to spend more hours than she did that means we just didn't sit we were too big to fit under the robe and we couldn't see how the place of the woman is in the kitchen it is a statement hard but to the Sons and Daughters of God they able to catch it and Martin Luther King of the family should be now able to see that I say like you know no no no no no no no no it's not not despising you he's not hating you but he's showing you a mystery only given to those who have the five requirements to receive the Revelation because these five requirements gives the people the ability to to assess themselves and when they understand that I don't have the Revelation where does these things come from and where are we going with all these things then they get to work like Elisha said tell me not to leave you let me listen to a tape every day let me Le read a chapter a chapter will turn into a whole book a whole book will just turn into a whole study because Elisha is trying to grow Elisha is trying to to uh uh to lose weight so he can be able to see Jesus and his program and that's the way we are able to preach these things the way they are we preaching them not as based on human ability that oh brother it's your experience no it's not about experience I'm on my probably my second quot why because he knows with certainty how where the children needs to be found the access to the word it's not just like you know coming to church you hear something new oh I never SE see it like that no it's not about never seeing it like that but when you have the key Jesus Christ is same yesterday to end forever butam calls it the Keystone to the Bible I'm calling it the access to the word he calls it the Keystone to the Bible Abel calls it the Revelation catching knowing on how to access him and when we are able to access him then we see the whole PN of the word the same quotations the other person is blinded by it but the other one is quickened by it the other one knows how to find a position she knows she the church she in the church men and women right she knows how to access the word by knowing how to access the word every single time that the ministry come on the pulpit she's able to access it right away she knows that oh this is my focus right here she's not sitting here you heard the preach about you you need to change no no but she's able to understand like oh this is not my next stage I haven't been working enough let me labor more like in the book of Ezra so they labored on the on the land they labeled on the wall one to with The Sword and the other the the uh one hand with the tool and the other with the sword they're laboring from the rising of the Moon of of the sun until the stars appear the whole program is before them because Joshua understands say I am in the work I am working if the sun has to sit down now and these demons will come will go and strengthen themselves and come back again right I hope we understanding the principle that I'm laying here it's not just about quotations left quotations right oh you people believe this no it's it's not about them people believing that but then let me just get to that quote so we can close time is gone elishah and Elisha and the only way to that that you can you can tonight become alive of faith in God is DED out to yourself to yourself and symptoms everything around you and become alive die out die uh die out to to symptoms die out to circumstances die out to everything else and become alive in Christ and when they got to the Jordan I'll I'll skip this year next paragraph 41 well you now brother I'll go somewhere in the middle there uh few lines before the red line where we are lighted there now brother if you don't see Divine Healing you don't see the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't see the mighty move of the of the spirit of God just as you might not see one quotation that quotation how does it apply look at how brother bam is giving us the tools on to be able to access it he said the spirit move the spirit of God moving in uh in the last stage here just get in the spirit one time and you will see things things will be revealed to you that's right don't come here in a humanistic realm like who who's preaching today ah I don't like him I'm not going get in the spirit and things will become be revealed to you the same Minister who is a stumbling block to you the next time like you know my brother I'm happy to see you why because you have died out to your own self now you are under his shadow like Mary how this thing will be the Holy Spirit shall overshadow you overshadowing brother Bram says it's him like in Mary it comes in it's it's not that he preaches good I understand him better no you should come to that level and he want you there that when the word comes out you able to see him at all times you want to see him at all times when he wakes up in the morning she's looking at him what are you wearing today I'm putting a blue tie white shirt and all this oh this is good and when you know that he's putting those rugged shoes and all that oh he's about to work when you see him putting the gloves and trying to reach to the oven oh he is about cooking when you see him going into the certain areas with with the gun you know oh he's about to hunt you should know him has is displaying himself he's keeping on the mountains he's changing forms is bringing the focus on certain areas to to bring the awakeness but then when it's not that we unable to access the word we just look at him has like you know oh the next fellow who's preaching brother Ron okay God bless you I'll be there oh brother S I don't really he doesn't speak good English why should you let him preach and all these things here but then he chose in this last day to use a man with the lowest education than all of us to bring all these Mysteries so that when it is a stumbling block to you that you want it to be a perfect English then you miss him right away that's right yet he also uses people like Luke like Paul who had went higher studies speaks better English and all this all the grammar in place but he wants you to know how to access him he wants you to know when you look at his eyes when he's in Fire and doing all these things you know this is not the time to approach him this is the time to stay quiet and afterward that's what na told her he said like you know disturb not the man until he has finished to eat and drink then access him it is the principle of the word that I'm showing that all these things that has to follow I don't have to sit here and say like you know oh you the young people you have to respect your parents and you the grown-ups and all this things no we're using the language of the word am and each one of us are able now to take it down because the same electricity is powering a lot of things here the same electricity is giving us life the same electricity is giving power to the mic but it is say still the same electricity and it said you know I don't really like the light I don't I I don't like the keys you know the drums the way they played I don't really like it in reality he's standing there like in the book of Samuel it said like you know Samuel it's not you that have rejected they've rejected me that's right and he wants us to know how to access him because when he comes down we are conscious what are we doing where we do going amen time is up but God's grace the access to the word out of the ages comes the seals out of the seals the trumpets it's not just a mere quotation the access of the word am because we're hearing every time a minister comes in oh I get inspired so quick when the minister start you read the quotation you you able to see where is going with the sermon where did you get that quotation did baram really say that where is the spirit get into let us get into the spirit musicians if you come come step forward let us step into the spirit and by stepping into the spirit we are able to start seeing Jesus and his program because this program has never changed that's from eternity back to Eternity and in between our Earthly journey is giving us experiences but these experiences are laid down in the Bible laid down in the message with to people with common passions like us and these people Elijah walking in with Hunger you will go through the same thing the economy will suffer you sometimes you lose some money sometimes but he said I have prepared a woman to take care of you if he had taken care of him is he not going to take care of me today amen what why do we worry why are we afraid why do we Panic of our situations oh my children don't listen bring them to the word we see look at William brandham with Billy Paul he's giving us examples every day revealing himself unto us well but the prophet was uh uh he was seeing Vision it was easy for him to know what was happening with the children he says but the Lord might not give you a vision but he knows how to speak to Youk and probably God God God willing down the road probably the if it's his will we'll be able to speak on the makeup of the Bride to bring these things so that we able to know sometimes we waiting that until I receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost then I'll be understanding on how the Lord speaks with me he didn't do so with William brunham a young child he said defile not your body when you shall grow I'll have a work to do with you he's showing how he start to speak to each one of us yes some of us see Visions some of us see dreams some of us our souls and our spirit are so apart that the only way he access to us is only reading the Bible [Music] some of us we don't even know how to read the message but then the next fellow who comes it starts speaking and then he start opening up he wants us to see him right him keep your eyes on him because look at as what is happening in the world one of the pastors said I said a Frank will not die he will be here until the Rapture oh so you set your eyes on the men all this way all these days huh you couldn't see him now let us learn to keep our eyes on him amen because when you see him you desire now to stay with him abide with me stay with us yes like the disciples on the road of os I said like where do you go come in because I want him to change the form now from this fellow to come into and to break the bread for you because on the road throughout the sermon he takes the time he's explaining he's breaking he's going into these places but then when you start now revealing it specifically to you then now it's a whole sermon it's a different thing that's right like oh I never seen the message this way I thought brother brandham was wrong he was never wrong the thing is I was just too big or too small to fit the mantle that's right shall we pray Heavenly Father surely in humility and by that Grace and you bringing Lord father God our word in places Lord father God the way you had designed it Lord father to be heard and understood by your children know father got some types of condemnations but Lord strengthening and giving L father God the necessary uh minerals to help us along the journey because we are your chosen bride and your Prophet says that you're doing all you can in order to bring us to see these things and you labor because you vow to Ruth that you shall not rest until you've brought it to fulfillment to Abraham you gave the promise and you gave you came down and you even L father God gave the sacrifice in this day you just didn't give the promise you came and you married us you brought us a great Shalom once again let it be that shalom in our hearts tonight as we go by you this your grace in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you [Applause] [Music] oh Lord be it unto me be it unto me according to Thy word according to thy promises I can stand secure carve upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to Thy word oh Lord be it unto me be it unto me according to Thy

more and hold on to when we get on our knees and we pray seems like when we close our eyes this world just goes away Lord but when we open our eyes and Rise we got to go face some of the things of this natural life I ask Lord that we could be like those on the road do IM there came a point where their eyes were [Music] open Lord help our understanding Lord there's there's a higher place you're wanting to take us to Lord but sometimes we're so Earthbound I ask Lord that you would uh strengthen us for this journey Lord give us the privilege to live a life pleasing to you yes what a great privilege that is Lord I ask that you'd help us that we could take what we We Got Tonight Lord maybe it was just a couple of nuggets but oh God may we hold on to it may we find strength and Revelation

tonight I ask you'd bless us as we go keep us in your care we ask in Jesus name amen [Music] amen amen praise the Lord you know I have always loved the story of Elijah and Elisha and you know it didn't look like anything great that was done Elijah just takes his mantel and brushes it by Elisha what did you do to me ah go on back how did this message when it come across your path here's some Kentucky Minister without much education and that that mantle of Elijah just rushed right by you and all of a sudden what did you do well go back back he starts making sacrifices immediately not knowing what he's doing look at our lives look at when this message came across your path and you wanted to follow it you knew nothing about it well go on back how can you go back you was predestinated Hallelujah it was that mental that had an effect on you and so much so that when you caught it he said what what what do you want from me he said I want a double portion of what you got he said oh you've asked a hard thing nevertheless if you see me go you can have what you have need of huh talk about access to the word huh you see when you begin to see the things that's happening when you begin to catch the Revelation for the day in the hour in which you live you begin to see the El I saw Elijah Hallelujah some saw a man saw Elijah amen and caught the Manel thank you Lord hallelujah yeah then all of a sudden there he goes away manal comes down what's the first thing he does with it where is the Lord God of Elijah smites the brook he comes over see my brother my sister this message is far greater than you will ever ever imagine it's time for us to take it fits I tell you what it fits us this how many of you know this message fits you it came across you and you said
