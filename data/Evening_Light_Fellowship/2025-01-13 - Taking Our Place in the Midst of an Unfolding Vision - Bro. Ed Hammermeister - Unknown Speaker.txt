1 we'll read this scripture and then I'll let you have your seats and and I'll make a couple of comments after that sure good to be with you this morning sure love the Lord sure love his people so glad to see so many of you second Peter let's start the reading this morning if we can and I I want to take it if I will from verse 10 verse 10 wherefore the rather rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall amen for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth amen yay I think it meat as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance drop down to verse 16 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were I Witnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount now imagine this Peter saying I was there I heard that amen but then he says this we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in the dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts God bless his word you may have your seats this morning I will go further in another scripture but I just want to greet you all this morning from our church in Edmonton Alberta we're about 2,000 mil straight North and we have Sunshine too and uh good we have lots of sunshine there and so you'll you'll enjoy it especially in the winter it's a mosquito free environment it's really really good so those of you that have been there amen I I appreciate I have a couple of Elders here this morning brother menow as I heard you sing and I thought you know they've never asked me to sing and and and I and I thought just I can't believe it the other day I had a little bit of a head cold brother Ron and you know your ears are plugged and you feel like you're in a tin can and and as I'm singing I I go oh that's why they don't ask me to sing now I know and and so but I appreciate our brother meno as an elder and also uh brother Jim douly brother Jim is a precious friend to me and uh it was brother Jim 40 42 years ago this coming year I was baptized in a log church and brother Jim was the Elder that baptized me and and we're still here so it's a it's a real coming together we have we have all of the Western Canadian provinces represented there's there's people from Saskatchewan here there's people from British Colombia here and I came to fill the Alberta Gap and so uh but brother Jim douly I mean he was born in New New Finland he spent time in Ontario he was in the Yukon he's in British Colombia I mean he's covered the whole country by himself so brother Jim God bless you brother Yul sister Patricia God bless you we love you they're they're dear friends of ours we also have have others here brother Kim hilderbrandt this morning I had a little text from your brother brother Kelly hilderbrandt he said to greet you brother Ron and also he said to greet my brother so he's he's greeting you as well and brother Dennis gransy and your wife you're we bless you we thank you to be here we have a lot of transplanted Canadians that are here uh brother Mark stanky uh he's here uh brother Russell Wallace he's also a transplanted Canadian they all lived north of the 49th but till they all found something better south of the 49th and that's the reason they're here so um we we are grateful them we're also grateful for our friends brother Robert Gary um brother Amos Peterson um the Peterson family as a whole that trip we went on to Europe it was a bus trip in 1989 it was special and I thought you were just there for the architecture and the history brother Robert I didn't think nothing else no matter what they're telling I that's I believe that okay so anyway God bless you all for your faithfulness to this church and to brother Ron and uh and it's it's good to have a friendship I also need to say my wife is here and so if you look at that row it's sister Rebecca it's sister Sandy and sister Sandry Sandy but there's each one will answer to a different voice when you say Sandy so so they're here but we've been married for my companion of of 32 years and uh I'm grateful that she loves the Lord and and that that is first and foremost and and then that love has been in a committal to me and if any of you are interested our average age is 58 so I she's a little younger than me but that helps my average just so you know anyway also she has a cousin here uh Rose mccaffery John and Rose mccaffery so I I think I've got more that are with us than that are against us so I'm I'm grateful this morning for all of that I just want to say also thinking of you brother meno thinking of you brother Ron and I I just want to say I'm grateful not just for their bit of German Heritage which is is necessary sometimes but I'm grateful and not just for their history of where they've stood in the message but the word that caught them many years ago it still Burns bright brother menow when when we had you speak at our Minister's meeting and and the presence of God came down and and that same fire that was there at the beginning is still there it does my heart good brother Mano it does my heart good and brother on I see that in you and I I thank you that that that word is still shining bright and and we bless you for that and it's a privilege to be here this morning so I'm I'm happy just to be able to pass those greetings on and from the church if I've missed anyone forgive me but I'm happy there's other faces that I see and know and love and God bless you all we're here for one purpose that is the Lord Jesus Christ so turn with me if you will to the book of habac habac chap 2 couple this with the reading that we took uh in in second Peter talking about uh light that's shining in a dark place coming greater and greater and I want to take this as well habac chapter 2 verse one and it will say I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved moved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it now so the vision wasn't just to be there to look that gaze but that we may run as we read it amen and so he says for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not tar now I I'd like to take for a title this morning taking our place in the midst of an unfolding vision and you allow me a little bit of time we all have a different way of approaching the word we had a a brother brother dea's son OED was in our congregation for a while and he ministered and we all called him the helicopter preacher cuz he just got in he got right into the word and when he was done he just closed up the Bible and I'm still making notes as he turned it to me and yeah we called him the helicopter preacher that's when I became known as the 747 preacher I need a little bit of a Runway to start so I'm I'm going to take a little bit of that Liberty this morning so just just bear with me turn with me to Revelations chapter 1 Revelations chap 1 and I will read just a few verses here as well the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John this a tremendous thought about that angel that that spoke this to his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace now look at the words here from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne so I'm I'm going to take that one more in in Revelations 19 and uh and we'll we'll take it the the Book of Revelations is an unfolding book right before our eyes and and there's never been a people never been a people on the Earth that can read it like we can read it that's right and and and and we thank God for this privilege verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come his wife has made herself ready to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb you can be great grateful that you're saved but I think if you ever want to be grateful be grateful that you can be called a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ there is no greater privilege than to be in that position today and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God and now John says and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said see he said see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of the Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy now there's a lot to unpack there but let me let me just take take it as the Lord has given it to me this morning and I feel like I've got uh some things on my heart that I feel I'd like to get to but we'll just also be sensitive to how the Lord is leading in us this morning but if we take this thought of taking an unfolding vision and and taking our place you know a vision if if we would take it and we're acquainted through the message it is the picture it is the Insight you know in into the past it's a into the present and into the future it's also goes beyond what our natural eyes will see it it goes into other Realms and and we have have had an insight into another realm and another kingdoms and and other places like no other people on the Earth and and so we've been brought and the vision has been brought to us who are in this Dimension who are in this time who are in this season it's been brought to our senses to understand that that we can understand what's there but by no means are our senses what's going to bring us to where we need to go to that's right uh and and and and I i' say this we have five senses but those are only to contact this Earth our six sense is what's been given to contact a Heavenly realm and he says the six sense is superior to every other sense and when all the other five senses are lying take the six sense and I believe we ought to take that this morning our our minds are focused on something so a vision or a prophecy and you know we're on the heels of the Pentecostal Age and and sometimes everybody is a prophet and everybody's got a prophecy and but if we take the real if we take the genuine if we take the thinking that God has given us and and we view this not just as an inspiration like pulling something down but a but a prophecy or a vision it's something God wants to make known to us it's not us pulling it down it's God revealing it to him Us in this season and so we're thank thankful for it and uh all of these things are subject to the will of God and in in doing God a service brother brah said there's five things about the the word in the SE must be in season it must be at the time God said it would be and it must be written in the word of God and it must be in the season of God's time and it must be God's choosing he doesn't need any of us to interpret his word God is his own interpreter and he interprets his word by bringing it to pass so we want to take that this morning now I want to read uh this has always been precious to me but from the impersonation of Christianity and I believe I gave this quote brother bam would say and God likened the prophet to an eagle that would go in the makeup of a prophet he is a Seer that in the spirit he climbs Beyond the emotion of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of the music he goes beyond the Clapping of the hands he goes beyond the joy of the Saints now I love all of those things but there's something there's a kernel that goes so much deeper than this and he says he goes beyond all of that God brings him into a realm alone he opens his eye he lets him look around and as he looks around he he sees things to come and then he comes back down making the members of a body to foretell them of what is in the making now it it is amazing to me I I grew up in an era you know where where I won't tell you some of the music because it'll bring rhythms to you but you know I'll take one that brother Brown and we talk about Elvis and The Beatles and different things but they talked about Pat Boon I said who is Pat Boon Like Pat Boon and and and is like that was nothing terrible about that but I'll tell you what it was in 19 I think 1990s or somewhere like that here Pat Boon comes out and he makes a a record with a a rock band I won't mention their name but he a title of it was nice No More Mr Nice Guy now what what was the spirit that showed that to brother Brandon what was the spirit that was behind that and I say that to give you confidence that these little things you know little things like brother bam says I I see the spirit of Elvis Presley leading the world to an Armageddon I see natives with little tubes in their ears way before we ever had earbuds where where what was it it's God for telling us these things amen so now also in in the same message brother brandham would say it this way the word of God that that then the word of God that has been spoken before the foundation of the world it isn't that God speaks and says something to the prophet at that time it's that the prophet catches what God has already said for the word was before the foundation of the world God spoke the word its laying way out it's stretched out in time and the prophet goes up and he sees the time coming it's only a gift of knowledge and brings it down in puts it on paper it's it's if I had a platform here I'd cly he's seeing things a far off that we're not seeing but we believe what God has been speaking to us and we conduct ourselves without seeing the end but we know we're in the spirit of something that's right now I if if I can just take these thoughts and I'm just allow me to to just uh bring bring this forward a little bit because we've been painted a picture brother Ron just alluded to some of it the things that we see coming to pass around us and and we can look at things we can look at what's going on in California we can we can see those things we can see what's happening in Israel and I and I say this because we've been told we're also looking we're more aware than any other people in the earth when in California there an earthquake or Israel how significant is o October 7th 50 years to the day from from the last Invasion back in 1993 and and and and it was right on the holiest Day of Israel all of these things have a significance amen my my my wife's got a birthday coming up this month she's going to drive up her average age again and and uh and it's on on January 26 well the day before there are seven planets aligning now don't ask me what it means but I take what brother brandham says when he it's in 1962 I think it's end time seed sign he's going he's pointing to planets Alig three aligned at Jesus coming five aligned when when when he was there at that moment and he's talking to events that are happening in the earth you know this England washed off the mat floods there this is that and he says what is it and then he brings out the spiritual application it's a bride coming into her infancy in her infancy I tell you what there's more that that the bride is coming to since that time and I'm not the prophet to declare that's what the seven planets that's not me but I'll just say these things are out there but we need to see beyond just that we need to see what's happening in here and I trust something's happening the word is more real to me today than ever before so he he he would he we can say you know we look at the presidents and we all we were all looking to see if if it would be a woman president or you know is it a woman system you know brother bam says it both ways and you know the one thing we have to remember sometimes he's looking at something and he's describing what he sees maybe symbolic so we have to let God interpret that and and I I believe that everything is being fulfilled exactly but you can look at all of those things and if you're a follower you know you can just say Well when California sinks when when there's a woman present when when Israel does this then I'll do this I'll just say that if you're on that level you're missing something and and I need to go to a level that's beyond that there's a faith realm that we've got to get there's a cycle we've got to get into now and I take it this way because I I I took this in in several services at home and I I'm bringing parts of several messages and I and I took it just to start standing we we're like we're standing in the midst of an un and we're watching but I'm taking this from standing to being a participant to being a key cog in what's happening around us cuz it was like Abraham three men came and visited him and Abraham recognized the one for what it was and and he had a visitation in in in Genesis Chapter 18 and then the two men went on their way and they went down to Sodom and they went down to Sodom and and we recognize that's type to this very age that was a Billy Graham and and an or Roberts and each were a messenger to the to the age but here is Abraham and now I I love I love these types because they're so real to me and and and and and God knew he in fact he was sending destroying Angels down to Sodom but he said I've got to stop and see Abraham first Abraham was the friend of God and he said I've got to see Abraham and he knew what was in Abraham he knew what was formed in him and Abraham begins pleading because he knows Lots down there now now listen we we we all have somebody that we know that is somewhere but how do you know that your prayers aren't stopping or holding back the Judgment of God on their lives and to me this is so real when I read it brother Ron I read how Abraham is there begging and pleading and from from 40 to 40 from 45 to 40 to 3530 and he comes down to 10 and then it looks like the angel left off and and and and okay but the Angels now here they're going to destroy the next scripture you read in there is they're going to get lot and they said lot you've got to come out because we can't do anything now what was holding them back it was Abraham's prayer that was in the middle of it we can't do anything until you come out do you make a difference absolutely we make a difference the bride of Christ is here for a purpose and the scripture says and and you can read it in Genesis 19 and God remembered Abraham and delivered lot out of the city who did he remember Abraham friends we are here for a purpose we got a great responsibility amen and I say I want to take it and we all know somebody and you could be standing for them and God's going to make a way we are participators we are intercessors now God gives us this this vision and and it's an unfolding and I want to take it now just beyond the natural Visions for a moment you know when when brother Brandon would have a vision and and it was things that he learned early in his Christian walk and he said God showed me a vision I'm going to walk in a room I'm going to pray for this person and he went and did it and then he realized he missed the sequence and he missed not following his part somebody had to lay a hat down some older woman had to be in a room and he realized he missed it and then he's praying before God oh for gift me Lord I missed it I missed it now he couldn't tell anyone else what to do he couldn't tell them hey move that hat over here he couldn't do it it was under the Sovereign orchestration of God hallelujah and so he's waiting and he's waiting all night if you read the for the account and he says there has to be this certain person come and then at the last minute somebody's getting ready to leave oh he can't leave he can't and all a sudden that person shows up and he comes he lays the Hat down he says now let me pray again and when he prayed why he stepped into his position amen and so we have a position now we're not prophets but every one of us has a place every member of the Bride has a place that they can be a part of and whatever that place is I want to be faithful to it Hallelujah brother Theo orasmus precious brother many years ago he told a story down in South Africa and uh he was preaching at the church and a sister was a very gifted s sister singing had a gift and bless the body of Christ she comes to him one day and says brother Theo I just ask I'd like to clean the church he says sister you bless us was singing and you do those things to clean the church so I know and she was persistent so she started cleaning the church a couple months later brother Theo says he's ministering and in the middle of the service somebody's just healed and and and he noticed that it's happening more regularly and he comes to find that this sister when she would come into the church and she'd clean the pews as she's cleaning the Pew she's praying Lord bless the person that sits here bless the person that sits here B and and what's she doing she's laying a foundation a preparation we all bring an atmosphere we all bring something doesn't matter what a position is but we're all contributors now I got to keep my focus and keep going so now brother brandom he he could not orchestrate the vision now this came out I think it was brother Evans who lost his car somebody stole his car and after service they got together the brothers got together and prayed and as they prayed then brother brandham saw a vision and he says I saw a man driving a car out to Bowling Green and he says and the man was a Christian so we sent the word out and the word because he was a Christian could deal with him and he says you're doing wrong he got under conviction he parked the car and they went to a certain place now in the middle of all of that you know we're we're looking for marching orders from from everyone that was Sovereign but I think it was brother Evans later on there was a man that know owed him some money he's driving with brother brandham they're going past a certain town now the man that owed him the money was not a Christian and so brother brandham saying oh man if he could just realize you know that if he would just go down and talk to him and he says but I can't tell him I really love how the prophet was he always respected that God had to do something he said I can't tell him and they're passing the sign he said oh Lord let him get it let him get it and then the man says Hey brother brandom down there's that City there's that guy that owes me do you think we could pop by there he oh yes we can down they go and and they confronted him and he he paid them back now different different outflow and different outgoing but it was God working and I I would just say it's God who's directing every member of the body it it we can tell each other you do this you do that but I'll just say I give lots of room in every service for God to deal there's times brother on you I'm sure you feel the same way you know and you're on a subject and you feel like going down and saying brother this is for you just listen to this this you got to catch this part but you can't do that amen God help us in our carnality Amen brother Brandon would say in the unveiling of God and he's typing it out to Jesus he'd say when Jesus went from first Pole to Second Pole to third pole under third poll he says except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink drink his blood he never explained it and and he didn't do it but it was under that last pull and it was done that way for a purpose and brother Ram says now the message is at the same place he says I can't come out and say things but if you're elect you'll catch it and that's the way even in the ministering as much as we would like to change things I just throw the word out and say Lord you have to do the work because we we've gone from a man anointing over into an eagle anointing and it is not just the hand of man you know just cuff somebody and yeah you've got to do it but you also want to see God deal with somebody now as we move along here just a little bit and I I need to take this if I can in into I'm going to share a couple of quotes these I didn't give you so just hang on but brother Brandon would talk and he would say how under you know the materializing of a vision how it would start out and he would he would see a little girl and she'd grow up and and as she grew up I see you as oh and I see and he begin to see the whole thing but it didn't happen even as he had the vision he was watching what he saw and he was speaking what he saw and and he would say now I I could see where she's at now I oh she's in a hospital and and before I speak it I see the person go away and I say the Lord bless you heal you he already has oh what a tremendous thing that is and then I turned around and I'd look at somebody and I could see them walking down the street like this and and and and they were doing like this and and then brother bam with assurity in the vision he could say he says I see a with a doll in her arm walking he says oh all the devil in hell can't stop it now look at the faith he had in what God was giving him and if he would have that I could have the same faith not just in the natural vision but in the spiritual vision that's been painted he says I can only say what God has showed me and tells me what to say and I can only say only see him materializing in front of me nothing else I can do but he says the man is not going to die with that cancer he's going to live and it never failed and I say thank God for such a gift in Our Generation Now I want to move this where it becomes more real to us because I I believe we don't want to just point back and say well brother BR I believe it needs to permeate Our Lives permeate where we're living at and and and as brother Brandon would talk he talked about even talked about Moses and how Moses you know he had intellectual faith and he had qualities that God had placed in him but they had to come to life and and I would say the same for me I I grew up in a home and around the message was we had a a split home and father believed one thing and mother but all along there was always something in me and and I knew one weekend at Dad's church and one at Mom's and at my dad say hey if I'm ever going to have a good time that's the church I'll go to but I also knew if I'm ever going to get real with God I'll go where Mom goes who was a believer of the message and and it wasn't just because she went there but it was I knew in some of those Services there was something more that was there brother meno I was a 12-year-old boy I was down in the camp meetings in Saskatchewan in the tent the Believers were singing and I'll tell you what I I as rambunctious as I was in doing things when they started singing and I just stood up and I was just into it and I remember it was there even as a 12-year-old boy down at the river where they were baptizing I said I want to be baptized too and and and you know I really hadn't had much of a change to lead up to that so it never happened but I'll just say that was always there but it had to be quickened in the right season and so when it when it was finally quickened how I thank God for it it came just at the right time so Moses had these gifts and and and he had an intellectual conception but he never could bring it until the light flashed across him something that not he just read about but something he'd seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and something that spoke back oh how it brings to life I'll say this friends you've got to get to that place whatever you do that you have you know it was God Amen hey if my parents quit the message I'm going on there is no plan be I'm sold out to thisall and he would say I think any man or woman boy or girl that has an intellectual conception of the word and so forth can never have a full Foundation until they met that light and Moses he says they met that light that brings the word to reality Moses with this great call but one day when he met that then he got his anointing the anointing that he had was inside not just the intellects but a faith that is based on a belief from God that separated him from his mother it strikes him in the presence of this light it anointed him that he was believed intellectually he had believed you know sometimes we don't see it unfolding in front of us you know it's like I think it's about s years years ago since I was last year and sometimes we come and and you see the kids and they go that's not your kids I saw them just seven years ago and they're like this high and you look at them and go my how you've grown and they look at you and my how you've grown yeah thank you go play with your parents New Year is always is a time for resolutions brother Ed what's your resolution I need to lose 20 PBS how you doing 25 more to go I'm there yeah I'm there you know we we we can't see things as they happen day by day but there's a seed that's growing and and and as and and and we don't see it and and and brother brandham would would speak about about these different things and how they're around us and and he said you know and and I I'm just trying to find the right place here but he he would he would talk about these things listen just turn with me if you will to um let's go to Psalms 139 for a moment Psalms 13 this is one of my favorite scriptures in the in the whole Bible I I honestly I could read the whole one but but it's David catching a revelation of you know God you see my downsitting my Uprising you understand all of these things you you Compass my ways you're behind me you're in front of me you're you're you're everywhere it's it's too much if I make my bed in hell you're there if you're so David's catching something of the thoughts of God and and really if if we would say the message is not us pulling ourselves up but the message is revealing who we really are and it's opening who we really are are the real you the thoughts of God the Eternal quality that was always there and and I would say it's it's not a knowledge we're trying to find we want to see ourselves in the light of our savior who has redeemed us so in verse in verse uh 14 David says I will pre praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth now here I like this verse 16 Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect or not having matured yet in other words it was always there there was a picture in the mind of God of who you would be what you would be in the end you know those those photo albums you you look back and you think think oh that was us in the 70s yeah I can tell cuz we're wearing those polka dot pants with flares in them and and this is us with that and oh that's when the horn RM glasses are in oh they're back in now if you if you ever need those old clothes keep them they'll come back around don't worry so you know you look at all these things but God's photo album's different right he's looking to your perfect being and he sees you over there oh they're not quite there yet they're coming they're coming they're coming and and he's working on us he's working on us day by day he's forming us he's shaping us he's bringing our character he's bringing everything in line oh we ought to thank god oh I have trials but you know our trials are different they're not like the world's trials our trials have a purpose they're not for our destruction they are for our edification they are there for our Perfection and so David saying you saw my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them oh I'm so thankful he before there was a speck of Stardust the bride was in his mind you know the thoughts of God are different like you know you know brother Aaron or brother brother Robert if I say to you you know AEL give me your first thought of AEL the praise that night the praise at night I we all remember that now before he could utter those words he had to think about them yeah so he had to thought so there had to be something you could go back to now before God could ever speak a word concerning us he had to have a thought and it wasn't just oh let me think of this no they were always there the thought of God have never changed they're Eternal and he thought of me and he thought of you and he thought of this meeting and and he knew that there be some Elders here and he knew what we'd be gathering listen we have come together for This Moment by the thoughts of God by his Divine orchestration be it unto me according to your word Lord in continuance they were fashioned how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee oh I I love the materializing the unfolding it's it's beautiful to watch so brother Brandon would bring this and he talks about it and and he he's just talking about how there's all of these things that are coming and and it brings us and it moves us and let me just take it this way if you if you P up pull up the why Christ speak I want to just take this because brother Bram would would say it this way and I I really love how he says it and and he talks about it and he says and it anoints us when we see where we're living in the last days when we see all the signs that are taking place spoke of in the scripture taking place in the last days this is all the way to heaven to the political powers to the nature of people to the demoralization of the world among the women and how they would do these last days and how men would do and how the churches would do and how the nations would do and how God would do and we see this all laying before us now it's wonderful to see that but you know there ought to be something in you that also says I am not a part of that I am so glad that I can't where I once hungered for those things the by the new birth I have a different hunger I have a different sanctification oh and it it's like the dove I can't feed on those things anymore friends I I believe sometimes we just need to get more in tune with God and these things will repulse us I I you know what the devil wants to get you in his cycle but God wants us in his cycle and and and you've got to be in a cycle in order to be there at the end now he says it anoints our faith it moves us out into great Cycles see it separates us from the things of the world no matter how little we are how much of a minority we are how much we're laughed at made fun of it that doesn't make a bit of difference used to be a time I would come to church and I have to drive and go past the neighbor I duck so my friends couldn't see me tell you what nowadays class reunion and they said Ed hammermeister you're a pastor you're a preacher how'd that happen said it wasn't me God determined it for me and I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed of it anymore used to be he said there's something within us we were predestinated to see this hour there is nothing that is going to stop us from seeing it amen God spoke it it's already happened we see it oh how we thank God for this it brings out your faith when we see these things happening listen I I don't rejoice as brother Ron would said about what's happening there I don't Rejoice about those things but I just have a quickening in my heart it's closer than it's ever been before it's real than ever before and it causes me to go into the word more than ever before why cuz I've got a part to play in all of this I'm not just a bystander you know like like I I used to play sports and I in in basketball I wasn't as tall as some of the other guys and but I was on the bench but I mean you got somebody who's on the bench I'm not doing anything you know and just back there and all a sudden the player gets injured the coach calls you oh yeah yeah what's what's what's going on in no if you're on the bench wait till your appointed time be in the spirit be clapping be participating be a part of it and then when you're called to step out you don't know the hour you don't know the place but God does and he is God he's working on you he's preparing you he's setting us up for the greatest move that has ever happened on the face of the Earth praise Lord I believe the best is yet to come now as this vision is unfolding it's not just outside events but it's something on inside of us that is being made real to us and we want to see it and even brother brandham would cry out and say oh I need a repentance I need to say I need a Revival I need a shaking I need a wakening up now he's living in the middle of an unfolding we were we were sharing some things in Fellowship about the things that brought brought brother brandham even to the opening of the seals but he comes at the end of 1962 and he preaches a message sers is this the time and he asks it as a question and he he goes over there and he goes over there and and he's asking the question and and and he's saying we've had six dreams and now I've had this and and if this vision is scriptural it's got to be interpreted by the scripture and he takes Revelations 10 now isn't that amazing and now it it looks to some people like this is a mixed up message but it's unfolding it's unfolding before him and now he goes out and and and and he's pricking what is the attraction on the mountain and and now that's just a few years later and he's going what is the attraction on the mountain he said it's Revelations 10 1-7 he said it is Luke 17:30 he said it is John John 14:12 and he says 2 3 years ago this was history but now it's fulfilled there was an unfolding and he was walking in it friends it didn't stop there it's still unfolding we are walking in the further part of the vision are you with me this morning amen I I say let's Lord awaken us this is not just church ATT attendance this is not just showing up it is it is like an everyday life I am here at his disposal I'm here for him now as we talk about position there's always a battle for a position God bless you brother James Laval who spoke on Wednesday you went down some thoughts I had some of these thoughts turn with me to Revelations 12 you're with me this morning Revelations 12 and as it says in verse 7 if we turn to verse 7 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against with his angels and they prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven prise Lord so that great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan and the tol and a Geo whatever language you want and he says which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcome him overcame him listen to all three parts cuz all are connected they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb ah we don't have strength in oursel brother menow that's right we don't have strength we can say ah I I'll take charge now I've got this no we need him more than we ever needed him we overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony now the spirit of Christ is or the testimony of Christ is the spirit of Prophecy amen now it was David he's he's he's there crying oh Lord all my bones they stare out at me my they've crucified me they've crucified me it wasn't David it was Christ he was testifying of and and it wasn't you know you'll not suffer your Holy One to seek corruption it wasn't David it was Christ that it was speaking of and he pulled out the scriptures pertaining to himself and and and now we are standing here with a testimony listen I never knew I'd be a preacher I'd been scared to death I I I I would say I I there's no way I could but I didn't do this he did this than you he brought me here step by step the devil told me I wasn't even good enough to be in church and and listen that's a funny thing he he he he leaves you alone and then the minute you come to church he says you're not good enough and then the minute you do something wrong then he condemns you again I said listen either I'm not good enough or I did wrong which way is it going to be you can't have it both ways that's right and I'll tell you what he he he's always tell you you're not going to get past this he'll bring trial you're not going to get past this you're not going to get over this hump you won't pass this you'll never be one of them on listen is this just me am I the only one I'll tell you what I know him he's speaking to every one of us amen he's telling you if you were if you were I'll tell you what he keeps telling you your future is is not looking very good you got this disease you got this situation you got this I'm me say something the future is not in the devil's hands the future is in God's hands your future is in his hands don't listen to him cast all your cares on him he's a liar to begin with my future is in him who called me and loved me and washed me it's him who brought me this far it's him who will bring me all the way through it is him and not only me but all that I love and my family and my loved ones it is him thank you Lord there was a there was a scripture or there's a quotation I came to and it was beautiful when I got to it brother bam says from the beginning it was not so God by Vision has told me my Ministry is going to change and he says I'm long in for it to to happen I'll be able to preach the gospel in such a way that it will do something that will help suffering Humanity to a happier way of life and a healthier way of life it's my sincere desire and then he follows it through and he he says now I want to make a statement there's a new ministry coming and he will tell it it's greater than all the rest put together it's already confirmed this is in Be not Afraid 1960 he said the hour is at hand I believe when God is going to help his children now he makes a distinction here it'll especially be for those who cannot reach up and get a hold of God like they should I believe the Lord is providing a way for us now to take care of them I believe that God has Elders he has parents he has people that are looking out for you when you can't look out for yourself he'll put you on pray on somebody's heart for prayer they'll call you they'll text you and I just say be faithful yes don't don't ever if God lay some I say be a be a benefit to the kingdom of God and he goes on to say some of us has faith we can reach anything that's great faith others has Mustard Seed Faith and have to wait so long to get through now he says I believe believe the Lord is making a way for those people now I don't know when it will be but it will be just as certain as I'm standing here the same God that was with Moses when he had Pharaoh in his face saying you can go with a man you can go for three days and Moses said I will not leave a hoof behind my grandmother escaped the Second World War under in Germany where they lived under the the Russian army that was coming back and they came back to Germany and she felt him pressed not to stay in East Germany but to go to West and they lost everything she lost her grandfather she had nine kids the youngest was two months old the oldest one was 13 my mother was the second oldest they had nothing and they were there there and God just so supernaturally looked after them he says she knew she had her brother had her husband had a sister somewhere in Canada but she didn't know where all the records were gone one night she had a dream she's writing a letter to Canada she remembers the address she writes to that address and it's exactly where her sisterin-law was Hallelujah now God wasn't just looking at her and the children but I was down the lineage there was others down the lineage God was watching over them naturally but Also spiritually oh what can we do to help you he can we send you clothes we no send us coffee cuz there was no coffee to be had in Germany sent a suitcase full of coffee listen you think you're laughing at this you don't know how important coffee is you some of you don't don't you know coffee first came to Europe in 1515 you know when the Reformation started 1517 beware of a caffeinated Pastor send us some coffee they sent us some coffee they sold one pound of coffee for 10 loaves of bread yeah they survived god making a way my Grandma had the youngest was two years old Adolf Whitmire his son Michael married r a cook Adolf was so sick my grandma almost prayed for him to die one night in a dream a hand comes down and puts a scripture puts his finger on a scripture in the book of Exodus I will leave neither hoof behind amen I'll tell you what there's a God that is greater than everything that we have my grandmother my mom was the first one over she worked for six months sent the money back the next one three years all nine kids came before she left my grandma before she left she's in a Baptist Church in Germany and I think this is about 1954 1953 somewhere there and the man says you're going to Canada he says if you ever go to Canada and you have a chance to hear of an evangelist named William Branham go and hear him amen 1957 brother Branham came to Edmonton for 10 meetings my grandma was in the meeting she didn't know what she was in the middle of but God was guiding her God was leading her and she began to take her position and she began to take it and she stood for this message till the day she died and she saw a young man like myself go Renegade and then she saw God turn him around amen thank you and it was a joy to her and it's a joy friends to see one come back to their place with god let's never lose that never lose it I digressed so as we read Revelations and I didn't I think I'm in the middle of verse 11 they overcame him by the blood of the L Lamb by the word of their testimony your testimony didn't start here had started with God before the foundation of the world you got called you were on the tip of the iceberg you didn't know what was behind it and I'll just say he who started this work will finish the work and he says and they overcame by the word of their testimony even when the devil has told you you'll never make it I'm just going to go to church anyhow I'm sold out there's no plan B and it says and they love not their lives to the death to be so sold out friends I there's been a few instance I've completely sold out my future into the hands of God and he has rewarded me abundantly never failed me yet and he says wherefore Rejoice you heavens and you that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come unto you having great wrath because he knows that he has but a short time amen you ever wonder why there's such a challenge yeah hey he knows his days are over that's right he knows what's ahead for you and I Hallelujah he'll do anything he can to stop us let's take this out of the contest brother bam in 1963 at New Year's he's speaking and he says I want to speak for these few moments quickly about the greatest contest there ever has been between the church and Satan the great strength of Satan but I want to speak of the great strength of God in his church now this great contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven Satan was kicked out into the Earth and he became an enemy to God's people and since then he has used all his strength and strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires into his fires listen you will never fight the devil on is ground that's not what we've been called to don't go on the internet and say well I I'll be able to handle this that is not our territory yeah you use it for what it's used for but make sure there's a division so far and no more listen I know the devil is destroying young people and families and homes all by just getting caught in a cycle Doom scrolling and one after the other one after the other and then okay I'm done I'm was going to play a game for a half hour two hours later not even sinful oh just look at a few things I'll tell you what you'll never regret putting that device down and spending a few minutes in prayer you'll never regret taking a little time to encourage someone to think on the things of God I just this is real this is where it's at friends amen hey this is as much our battle as as the great Revelations are we've got to contain our own Spirit we've got to watch where where we where we're at with things he'll go on to say and you know who has the most power look all I can say is don't get pulled into Satan's fires amen don't go in a bar room to witness to somebody don't go on his ground don't get into a relationship it it'll take you way further than you want to go amen hey we've all been harmed we've all been injured thank God for grace that he pulled us back but let's learn from it let's teach others let's teach our children I'll say this to any young person I've been there played on the football team in high school Captain went to University played football did all of these things and I thought oh this is the epitome of it all and my life was going darker darker darker and God pulled me out and ever since then it's a star that's been rising out of the darkness and I'm so grateful to be where I am and I'm nothing in myself he'll try and pull me down too that's right so he says now and we know who has the most power God does and the best thing that he could do to combat Satan with was his word because the word is God and what's stronger than the god the word is God the word becomes our strength God in the church becomes its strength to pull Satan into his own fires that he has made and the tug goes on and God said and Jesus said in Mark 16 in my name they will cast without Devils now you just have to arm yourself with this thought you're going to meet the enemy you're going to meet him you're going to meet him somewhere and so the thing is know your enemy know your weaknesses I I know I just don't do good in the evening and that would be a time I'm susceptible so I'll do something that's hey it's not heavy it's not this but it's not going to be what the devil wants me to do that's right hey and if I'm not a Mourning person then then wherever you are recognize where you're weaknesses are and work with them according to what God has said in in the greatest battle the greatest battle that was ever fought in heaven Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels the first battle in heaven and sin did not originate in Earth it originated in heaven and it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven fell on human beings then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan came to destroy God's creation that God had created for himself self he came to destroy it that's his purpose is to destroy it the battle here on Earth begins in us it's been raging ever since how many are in a battle this morning just be honest ah hey he's there he's there in the morning he's there in the evening he's there in the middle of the service he's there wherever we're at amen and so we've got to be tressed ready for the battle we've got to be dressed for fighting we got to be trained for fighting that's the greatest battle God is training and selecting his soldiers now I'll just draw this this is familiar I'm going to have to move quickly now just to get to where I want to get to he says Satan knows this is that this book is the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he says let me show you the reason he says he knows a lot more than theologians he knows God is immutable in his nature in his ways Satan knows that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be the true church is the continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows the Antichrist Spirit come into the church defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan his attempt his works his attempted destruction of God's people now here's the thing he he says discrediting of God's word right to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights it he cannot stand it now he knows something special here he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army you know what he knows there's only so many message churches if I can get a little bit of a Schism between them if I can get this if if I can get that I I believe we're coming to maturity and I'll tell you what the tremendous victory in the love divine brother bam makes a statement that's outstanding to me he says do you want to be a real outstanding member in your church how many would want that hey fall in love with Jesus and when you fall in love with Jesus you'll fall in love with every member in your church and every member in every other Church ah but they're my enemies they said you may never get forgiven in this life but the power of forgiveness you can lay it down and say this will not be against me I I choose listen the most offended person in all the world was God by what Humanity did to him and he could have said there until you come back and gravel and make your way and do this I'm not touching you but you know what he did he says I will go down the one who bore the hurt the one who bore the pain I will go down I will make reconciliation I will choose to do this Hallelujah and he brings Fellowship back into it there's an example for you thank you Lord you have an opportunity to clear the record amen and you can clear the record and you know where you find these scriptures Mark 11 if you don't forgive neither will your father forgive and if you forgive you can say to this mountain be moved and it will be moved oh I I love it when there's a clear heart I don't understand all misunderstandings and things but I just say oh God let me be a real Christian now there's there's much I could go to let me let me go down this path just for a few minutes our weapon our weapons have naturally speaking in the last 150 years maybe 200 years we've gone from a bow and arrow to a spear to guns to rifles to cannons to missiles to atomic bombs now as the battle intensifies you're not going to go out against Russia with Spears and bow and arrow you're not going to go there you the battle's got to be fought on the level that it's escalated to amen now let me this scripture may not seem related right now but let me just take it for a moment Psalms chapter 1 no sorry Acts chapter 1 I'm sorry Acts chapter 1 and and in this Jesus would say this sorry I I'll keep moving quickly just help me pull a little bit and we'll move along quick so where when they therefore came together they asked him saying wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel he said it's not for you to know the times and the seasons which the father has put in his own power now look at this next verse but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me in Jerusalem in all Judea now I I'm I'm going to make a distinction here you receive power after the Holy Ghost has come on you that's right when you get the Holy Ghost that is the ceiling of your salvation amen that is God coming down and he is giving a new birth to the seed Gene it is being quickened you will never lose that that's right that's yours now you can grieve the holy spirit away and it'll it'll take its flight as brother Brandon would say but you never lose your salvation you never Lo lose the Holy Ghost so there's an anointing that comes with the Holy Ghost in its season now he says you brother if I can do it this way and and brother I would say you have power it's unlimited power in you but he says that power is limited it is governed by a law of Faith so you can only have the power by the Revelation that is loose to you so that's what gives you faith now I I I couldn't I couldn't go out there and go into a hospital and say I'm just going to go raise all the dead I wouldn't have faith for that cuz that's not the season we're in that's that's that's not what I I would do but but he says now and and we have to remember the Holy Ghost if we just take and and I'll just forgive me brother Ron you correct me if I'm going on a path but we can't view the Holy Ghost just in Pentecostal terms the the Holy Ghost is receiving the word for you your age and I'm not just talking knowledge but I'm see receiving the power of God that's loosed by Revelation in the hour that you live in now if I if I can say it this way Luke chapter 4 Jesus would say uh I'm anointed he would actually say I'm anointed to the the spirit of the Lord is in me he's anointed me and he gives a specific reason to preach the gospel to the poor to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen and he closed the book and he gave it to the minister and sat down the greatest anointing read some words and sit in a chair now we wouldn't think of it that way would we but that was the hour he lived in that was Jesus you know brother B would say it supreme power in control amen he could have done it what ever he wanted to but that was the greatest anointing now we we we need to recognize there's a holy ghost but there's also an anointing that comes with every Age and and I'll I'll just I'm going to just pull this a little bit out of I'll have to go quickly here in the Old Testament there was a tabernacle and then there was four tribes around each side and each had a banner and each had a symbol or an emblem a lion an ox uh an eagle a man and each represented God's protection to them sir it represented that now it also did that in the book of Acts or sorry in the New Testament under the four gospels there was again each gospel written with an anointing and a protection around the word that was there amen now now let me read a little bit of what what brother brandham would say and you'll find this in the fifth seal now and just just let me go quick I'm I'm doing it this he says notice as the Antichrist went for on his beasts of ministry God sent forth a beast to combat it now Satan is is great at replication he's great at Watching God he's great at watching you he he tries to repeat he tries to emulate he tries to do it but God always raises the standard amen so in the first age God sends an anointing he says on these beasts of ministry send forth a beast to combat it now watch every time the Beast Rose the Antichrist rose on his horse it began to announce his ministry but God sent a beast also and he was on that to announce his combat to it when the enemy comes in like a flood God will raise a standard to it so when the enemy went out as Antichrist God sent a certain type of power to meet him and then again a red horse rider another color another Ministry everyone God sent him now I I I wasn't there in the early church but took a bunch of cowards in an upper room and they were nothing in themselves but when the Holy Ghost came on them there was an anointing that came with it that they were no longer cowards they were as bold as lions and they went out and they didn't care what anybody said but that was an anointing that was on them now that wasn't the men that was the anointing that's right now it also went to the Dark Ages the ox anointing and now it looks like this is terrible they're just giving their Liv they they they're just but you know and you read some of those stories in Fox's book of Martyrs mothers giving their children being torn apart doing and and you think how in the world did they do that how but it was an anointing God sent are you with me I'm going really quickly on this now don't forget this church brother Bram was say fif seal and you brethren on tape I want you to examine this how could men do anything else beside the power of God that had been released to them I'm going to set this box up here to represent that if God sends a certain Spirit among them then the only thing they can work by is the spirit that works among them and I'll prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose watch exactly the Church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else amen now my goodness I don't know when I get over there and and I'm going to read about polycarp and I'm going to read about these Martyrs and and these different ones and I'm going to man how did you do it and he says we didn't do it God sent an anointing it wasn't us amen we just were faithful to the word and God gave us a power we didn't know we had yes sir somewhere beyond the caffeinated Pastor there was an anointing that came in there there here's a here's an interesting thing about a hundred years before Luther ever came there was a man named Yan hus and Yan hus he began to see some of the things in the Catholic church and he began to Pro protest them and he began to Pro protest them in such a way and he actually he began to do some of the very same doctrines that Luther would embark on but now hus was still under that man anointing sorry under that Ox anointing and when he did it they burned him at the stake now a 100 years later Here Comes Luther he's got some of the same principles he's near the same town that huses they're identifying his works but now the anointing has changed and Here Comes Luther and he is under a man anointing and they could not put him to death why it was the wisdom of man it was the power of God to the church that was there at that time thank you Lord friends if we can see how important that is and I'm coming to something so just stay with me we're going to be over there and you know what age did you come out of ah I came out of lead deia whole where the survivors are hey hear this guy's testimony how did you overcome I was faithful and God sent an anointing and the anointing kept me in the face of the most deceptive age that ever was friends we need to appreciate what we've got thank you Lord Brother brandom if you actually take first PLL and second pull they were actually under a man anointing he said our last great Reformation was Pentecost man anointing now everything brother Branham is looking at now remember the revelations distinguishes the lion the ox the man and then it says the Flying Eagle so brother Bram is seeing a transition and he is walking in the midst of this unfolding in his own life now hey God prepared him for it there's a bull across the field ah reach for my gun oh I don't have the gun you begin to exercise what Adam had in the Garden of Eden why because we're under a restoration not a Reformation but we're coming back to all that Adam lost friend Adam didn't control nature you know move the tree he didn't bring a bulldozer over he didn't you know some magic part he did it by the spoken word that's where we're coming back to and we're coming back and we need to see a distinction and I've I've been watching this and I'm going here is here's brother brandham first pull second pull now he's going into third pull and I'm seeing all of brother brandom has been spped Stripped Away the man part he talks about in the countdown he says we've gone beyond you know the horse and buggy age the automobile age the airplane age you know the airplane I you know you talk about people on Pentecost hey what' you guys do at church oh we were just in the Astronaut training program what' you guys do oh we went on a plane ride oh it was great we were up there and what' you guys do just preparing for one trip one final trip amen I'm waiting for the I'm under an anointing it is preparing me for something oh don't be don't ever lose patience what God is doing he's preparing us for something and so he's he's going and and brother Brandon would would take it and he actually goes down let me just bring this further he says now the Antichrist is cunning he's got all kinds of things that represents Christianity on this side or only got it off on the other side something against the original Doctrine something that makes him anti Christ see the reformers when the Beast went forth in a form of a man to combat that now so that was Luther that was Wesley that was Pentecost but look at what he says now don't forget this he says remember it all the days of your life these beasts are correct it's thus sayeth the Lord you can't take that man anointing that Beast to give you a true definition of where you came from neither can it give you a true definition of what the holy ghost is now am I throwing all that out the window no I still need justification I need I need sanctification I need what was there but now I'm moving beyond that I'm not throwing that away it's still part of it but I'm under a different anointing I'm not under the same thing anymore oh friends I I I need to just forgive me give me just a few minutes I need to there there's something here that friend said I believe is very pertinent to the hour we're living in yes sir it takes our approach where it's not in my hands that's right but it's God working through me thank you Lord sometimes it does US good to see where we're at let me just relax for a moment we went on on a trail I never heard of it before it's called The Devil's Bridge and I prayed Lord make a path path that we can cross the Devil's Bridge I won't tell you where I heard it but it was at church about where this thing was some people have told me they renamed it Angel's Landing so that's okay so I'm out there with my wife and I we hiked all the way up here the other day in Sedona and we come up to the top and there's a big photo opportunity and and it's it's like this a bridge of rock and there's a big hole underneath it and and people are out there and you can tell how vain somebody is by how long they're posing and doing things and and and anyway they're all out there so there's this elderly couple with us and and they're just standing there and they said uh hey you take a picture for us and I'll take a picture for you okay that's great they went out there they stood out there I I mean I've taken some photography so I took the whole Panorama like I took you know just the mountains the backdrop the whole could see their image then I took another closeup and another close-up another close-up I said oh this is great your grandchildren are going to love it and so then I said you going to take a picture of me sure come and take a picture I come back they're all close-ups there's not one picture of where I'm standing I go I'm going to have to photoshop this thing to show my children where I was sometimes it would do us good to see where we're standing every type in the Bible the Book of Ruth is not history that's me in there listen Esther is not history that's me in there Hallelujah if we could recognize where we're standing that's what the devil wants to keep you from but when you catch it oh friends that's the Invincible Army in the Old Testament you will find onethird of all the books in the Old Testament are dedicated to the restoration of Israel all of the Minor Prophets and the different ones and I'm just going to take a quick principle listen I don't didn't give you these scriptures but really quickly if you will Ezra chapter 1 now remember the restoration if I can tell you this way it was after 70 years but it didn't happen all at once it happened over a period of time amen and this is a type for us I'm just stay with me I'm going to tie this in in a minute so in the first chapter I won't read them all Ezra 1 1:5 and it says about Cyrus the king now never I think Isaiah prophesied about Cyrus a hundred years before he ever came on can you why would God do it because God was drawing attention to it and so Cyrus this King of Persia he says now if there's any body of the kingdom of Babylon that wants to go back to Jerusalem for your God is God I'll help you I'll give you all the vessels I'll do all of those things I'll send you back so he does that and then in chapter three we find that they go back and Ezra was a priest so in chapter 3 you can read this in verses 10 to13 but they they went back and the builders laid the temple the foundation of the temple they they had a singing and everything and they rejoiced and there was was weeping the temple was restored the foundation rather was just restored oh they were so happy but then right away at that time what happens in in verse four when the adversaries hear about the temple being restored then they came to zerubabel and said you're not doing right now I'm not I'm not going to know but in in 4:4 and the PE and it says here and the people of the land weak weakened the hands of the people and troubled them in building and they hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of they hired somebody to frustrate them to weaken them friends that's exactly what the enemy is trying to do right now he knows that if we keep going the way we're going he is finished so he has an anointing on people listen people that were always there in the city right yeah H always there but wouldn't lay their hand but when they see the work Rising all of a sudden they're anointed and they're Anointed with something what are they anointed by to come against if you actually says the people of the land weakened them hired counselors just look around what's in B newspapers websites people that were Among Us what is the spirit that's behind these things and I just say they have no part in US neither are they part of this restoration and I say that's not going to stop us now the sad thing is back there if you look at history 19 years there was nothing done on the P Temple because of this 19 years in the history now this is in Ezra 4 but you go to Ezra 5 you let's read the last Ezra 4: 24 then cease the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem it ceased in the second year of the reign of Darius of Persia but God is never going to let the work die amen so he says then the prophets he the prophet and Zachariah the son of Ido prophesied unto the Jews that were in Jerusalem in the name of the god even unto them and when they prophesied listen what did it do then zerubabel the son of of Shel and jeshua the son of Jack they began to build the house again and with them were the prophets of God helping them oh my goodness if you if you follow these two prophets through you know Zachariah was was the younger prophet he had the deeper things and and he would deal in symbols and and I see you know this and this and and and you know people may have gravitated oh I like to go to zachariah's Services they're just deeper than the others but then God has this old man hagy he's there and he just he tells him you know and hagy he says you guys are building your own houses and the house of God is laying dormant get with it amen oh that's kind of down to earth and blunt part of the same message that's right part of the same message these prophets were not to be separated they were part of the whole coming together of God H we need to hear about how our lives should be how our family should be how we should conduct ourselves in church as much as we need to hear God has called you for the foundation of the earth they're all part of the same work there's much I could say here but now finally the temple was built and it's really interesting to me God chooses to build the foundation build the temple but the walls are laying scattered now God has restored the word in our age and it's not up in some place in Jeffersonville it's not up somewhere it's to us but it's in our soul but the Battleground is in the walls of our spirit and sometimes the enemy can try to destroy what's in our soul by what we open up to right now in the Old Testament type here the temple is restored now what comes next is this guy named Nehemiah a cup Bearer in the house of the Lord and He there in Jerusalem now this is now I think the work had been undergoing 30 40 50 years and Nehemiah hears that the walls are down and as he hears this and he says they're burnt with fire and and and he just starts grieving and he going how can this be friends if brother Brandon would look at us he isn't worried so much all about how if the message is is being preached right but also how it's being lived in our homes how it is in when it comes down to a daily walk with God he wants to see it take life take root and I believe God wants to see it the same way so now Nehemiah he's just going oh God he repents and Lord be open to my prayer you've dealt corruptly with us oh God hear my prayer and the next verse chapter 2 he comes into the king's presence and for the first time he's sad and that was a dangerous thing to do at that time but as he come comes and the King says are you sick is there something wrong with you King I'm sorry but my father's sepers are lay waste and the gates are consumed and he says what's your request he says I prayed unto the god of heaven and he says oh King if your servant has found favor send me to Judah to the city of my father separer and the King said unto me verse six and I love this next part and the queen was also sitting beside him amen who was the queen sir who had had an influence friends Esther was a queen listen do you think that you have an influence listen you you you think that you're sitting here where you're sitting today you can have an influence you can encourage this is not just a oneman Ministry anymore now the work has to be completed everybody in their place everybody is doing something to encourage somebody and he says let letters be given to me and they that I can convey them and a letter to Assaf to the king's Forest that he can make he can make beams and Timbers and and all of these things and well wouldn't you know it the enemy is just going to let this go no just watch you get serious with God the enemy will come against you with but don't you look at that one moment am verse 10 when and San balot the horonite and Tobi the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was a man come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel oh God give us a heart like that that we can see it and the enemy has to notice these people are real amen it grieved them here's Nehemiah takes his horse by night he goes and looks at the gates didn't tell anybody what he's doing why he was there verse 19 no sorry Verse 18 he he tells the elders that the hand of the Lord is in me the King has spoken words let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this work verse 19 but when Sam balot the horite and toai the servant the amonite and gishian the Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised this why are you doing this will you rebel against The King and I answered them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore his servants will arise and build but you have no right no portion no Memorial in Jerusalem here's the thing these guys had been there for 20 years that did not lifted a finger right but the minute somebody lifts a finger they get upset hallu oh my goodness I just say Lord I I want more of God I want to see this program not in my soul only but in my spirit in my family in the church around me Nehemiah chapter 4 and it came to pass that when Sam ballot heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and he took great indignation and he mocked the Jews and he spake before his Brethren the army of Samaran and said what do these feeble Jews will they fortify themselves will will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of these heaps of rubbish which are burned and tobah the amonite was by us and he said even if they build if a fox go up he shall break down their stone wall can you hear the voice of the enemy back there can you hear the voice of the enemy here today he will try and stop you don't press in you it's not for you what do you mean it's not for me all the riches belong to me I'm under an eagle anointing the riches I'm not trying to pull myself up I want to see the real me I want to live the real me and in verse four Nehemiah says hear us our God for we are despised turn their reproach on their own head and give them their prey in the land of captivity cover not their iniquity let not their sin be blotted out for they have Pro provoked thee to anger the the builders so we built the wall and all the wall was joined together unto the half for the people had a mind to work the vision had to come to pass and it wasn't one giving in order but everybody's heart was the same just like brother Brandon when he was making the vision I couldn't tell that guy to move that hat he had to do it himself I'll tell you what when we get in one mind in one Accord and there'll be an army that is rising I believe it's rising even right now and I need to see every one of us in our place coming to this place if you want to have a purpose for 202 I want to see the walls built around my family I want to see the walls built around my spirit don't let me be involved in things that weaken me very good and I even say it this way if I can be so bold I'm getting a little older maybe I can say a few things now brother man makes a simple little statement you come up for a prayer line and he says to be prayed for thank God for that but if you keep coming up he says that weakens your faith that's right in perfect Faith he says to his church I want to see the how advanced my church is I'll do that in a few minutes and he has a prayer line but he doesn't stop and discern he just says perfect faith in God's word he lays hands he says may in God's name you be blessed May in Jesus name you be blessed he's watching friends there's a maturing we've got to come up to we can allow we can allow our faith to be weakened by retreating to what's comfortable even in a past age honestly I I I I I want to see God move as much as anything but I'm not going to work it up myself amen I want to see God do it that's right I want to lean on him we had a situation come up our church and I something a brother Harold had dealt with years ago and I thought I'm going to have to deal with this and I remember how brother Harold had dealt with it and dealt with it and it always came back up again and I'm driving about four four and a half hours coming back from a meeting and then I said I'm going to have to deal with this and then the Lord said to me just speak the word and I took several services and I just laid out the word and I'll tell you what that did more than I would have done with my own hand because there is nothing more powerful than God's word people came to me after said God really spoke to me thank you for that and I say that wasn't me that was the Lord that was the anointing that I'm under amen and I think we need to take it and employ it that way yes sir hey you have wayer children you're going to have to use wisdom you're going to have to allow them to give them let God deal with them help them but let God deal with them help them but let get God I'll tell you what it's not easy it is not easy but let God do a work amen now I want to point out one thing here I'm just about done here this whole battle by the time it was said and done there was not a SP a single spear that was thrown there was not even a a physical battle in any way it was a battle of the mind and now here when these two guys arise up Nehemiah says okay everybody's one mind he says now we're going to build the wall but your family you stay behind the wall and you be armed and you be ready and when the enemy sees it but they never had to do it amen why because they were of one mind they were one Accord the battle that we're fighting friends it's even Among Us sometimes yeah and I us just say like brother brandham said somebody sometimes he'll send somebody in among you do this and this he says don't don't make clicks don't do those things just love them if they're one of you they'll come in and join you if they're not they'll go out and do this you've heard it before where's our battle today I'll tell you what it's it's it is more subtle than we realize sometimes and he goes on to to say and if I just wind it down with this and in in verse 17 and they builded the wall they put their burdens everything they laided everyone put his hands in the in the work and everyone had one hand in the work and the other in the weapon wow one service of Hagi one service of Zachariah it's you got to keep your balance here and he says and the builders everyone had a sword girded by his side and so he build it and he that sounded the trumpet was by me and I said to the Nobles and the rulers to the rest of the work is great and large and we are separated in the wall far from one another when you hear a trumpet come over here and help us oh I like that don't you amen how many say I'm I'm going to be here for you Lord and if you send me somewhere just down the street or overseas or wherever I'm a part of this work listen I'm I'm done let's Stand Together how many are saying I'm a part of this I'm a part of this restoration I'm a part of this anointing I'm a part of what God is doing and I've got a position that I've got to fulfill Amen in the midst of this battle amen I believe that it's it's ours to take I I I want us to just say I'm I'm grateful I brother Harold hilderbrandt was my pastor for many years we watched him decline but I'm grateful he gave me a place allowed me to grow allowed me to come to where I am allowed me to see and even saw you know the the good things that I glean and maybe some failures but never to put anything past on that because we need to see this work is bigger than one man this work is God's work and we are part of this whole work this economy of God I'm so glad I'm a part of it thank you brother Ron for allowing me to minister this morning maybe we can just sing a song I will not lead it there's a brother here at home I'm really good at lip sinking and there's a brother that sinks amen ah Why Should I Worry why should I fear when this very name same Jesus is here this morning you do that brother Robert go ahead and sing for us sing sing one of that I I I I would like to just have brother Ron come up and pray you're the pastor of the church you see the way the Lord has ministered you pray over your people okay think about what that example he just mentioned as they were there building they weren't worrying because
