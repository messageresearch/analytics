I don't know if uh you all are aware but Rashashana has started uh in Israel. It's a feast time. It's one of their biggest feasts of the year. And the largest gathering of Jews in Jerusalem is happening right now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and they're under such an expectation. It is a time of of a new year of repentance and it's also they say a time of judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But remember, judgment begins at the house of God. So, they're kind of purging themselves and then saying, "Oh, God." And many prophecies, they're they're all pointing to Old Testament uh scriptures and they're saying, "Hey, do you realize this anti-semitism and all of the countries that surround Israel is completely surrounded by the countries that are their enemies that want to absolutely eradicate all of the Jews, not to just give them a place. They do. They want to get rid of them. &gt;&gt; And so anyway, uh they're saying, "Hey, do you realize these countries are the countries of Gog and Mog, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; According to Ezekiel's prophecy, how close are we?" Well, now we know that Armageddon comes before Gog and Magog. But I'll tell you what, saints of God, all of the pieces prophetically, &gt;&gt; okay, are coming together, excuse me, right now. And brother Brennham said, "Watch Israel." That's God's time piece. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we want to be aware of these things. I'm I'm excited. I think this is an exciting time to to be alive and let our light shine and let us stand up. We're in the midst of a woke generation. Amen. I got woke up. Amen. By a midnight cry, hallelujah. A message of this hour. I thank God for that. Others are getting woke in a different direction, &gt;&gt; but we thank God that we've heard the voice in this end time that's to uh tell us to get ready because he's coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I just uh I wanted to say that just so that all of you would be aware uh of what's happening. Pray for Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he that blesses Israel will be blessed. Amen. God bless you. Amen. If we could sing that song, Heart of Worship. When the music fades and all is stripped away and I simply come. I'm longing just to read something. That's a word that'll bless your heart. I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper within through the way things appear.

You know, it's everyone's needs tonight, Lord. and we just depend upon your grace and your mercy for each one of us. Lord, tonight may you just come and use the gift Lord to speak to your people tonight. I cannot rely on my knowledge or understanding but I will rely upon your Holy Spirit Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it is you that speak to your people Lord God. &gt;&gt; Just want to thank that I'm privileged to be a mouthpiece tonight. &gt;&gt; And may you just sanctify my mind and my heart, Lord, &gt;&gt; that you may have preeminence, Lord, tonight that your name may be glorified among your people, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I commit this service to you, Lord God, in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; So, to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So, just uh pray for me because my tongue has a cold sore. So, it's really hard, &gt;&gt; but uh it pulls my lot tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know God is always in complete control. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; And uh we're so glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we have something to rejoice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not because we are so many, not because uh uh we are here, but uh we rejoice because we have the word in this last day. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Not just a partial word but the full word of God that's being revealed to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God show us uh before today and tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have a complete package. &gt;&gt; So we just need to depend upon the Lord tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh even tonight I cannot just speak by my own self. I just need your help. &gt;&gt; Amen. As always says uh when you are in the pulpit it's always a two-way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It is not a showmanship because as a ministers we are just like waiters. &gt;&gt; We need we need uh we need to take your order in order for us to deliver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So just don't stare at me as if you you are blank. Amen. you just uh twinkle twinkle your eyes or smile so that I will know that you are responding to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us not look at the person but let's look at the the the word of God tonight. Amen. And I believe we come here not to see a person but we come to manifest or to to enjoy the word of God tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though the minister sometimes is inadequate as for me in adequate to explain the word but as you pull it will be the word it will be God who will give you the right word &gt;&gt; for your needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I will not hold you too long tonight and we will go directly to the word of God. Just a simple thought that I'm trusting that it will lift up our faith and encourage uh knowing our day and our season and uh knowing the pattern of how God moved upon his people. &gt;&gt; Genesis 11 verse 29-30. So this is a three portion of scripture. Genesis 11 2930. Then Genesis chapter 25 2021. Then Genesis 29 verse 31. Chapter 11 verse 29. And Abraham and Nahor took them wives. So Abraham and Na are siblings. And the name of Abraham's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife. Mela, the daughter of Heron, the father of Mela, and the father of Isaac. But Sarah was barren and she had no children. So this is the first time that baroness is mentioned in the Bible. And so we know that there's always a hidden truth &gt;&gt; associated with things like this that God places in the stories in the lives of people recording the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. As the prophet said, every every period, every comma, every line, every verse, there is always Christ in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we cannot see Christ in every verse, in every line and every chapter, then we need to look back &gt;&gt; the word to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Genesis 25:20. And Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to wife, the daughter of Bitwell, the Syrians of Pandan Padan, the sister of Lean, the Syrian. And Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was barren. So first Abraham wife was barren. &gt;&gt; Then now is Isaac wife was barren. Genesis 29:31. And when the Lord saw that Leia was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. So notice the three barren woman in a row, one after the other, the wives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, old barren. And may the Lord add a blessing upon the reading of this word. You may now be seated. I still remember when brother Warren preached about this baroness way back in uh when we were in Maryland and that's the first time I heard him preach about the baroness but I believe this is important subject that we can we can relate amen &gt;&gt; because all these women in uh the old testament it's just reflection of our journey in life we can be identified in Sarah We can be identified in Rahab or we can be identified with Rachel &gt;&gt; because they are just a shadow of reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not a shadow but we are the reality of the shadow. All the women in the Old Testament speaks about churches and they are reflections of what we are now uh being made manifest because we are the reality of the shadows. Amen. So before we go to our subject the season of baroness uh let us uh define the word baroness which typically refer to the state of being unproductive, empty or unable to produce life. So barrenness can have an incredibly profound negative emotional impact on women who discover herself to be barren. And there is also a great strain that is put in her relationship with her husband as well as family members and friends. So barness is su sometimes a bad word and sometimes is associated sometimes with a curse. They said it. But yet barrenness is a thing that is not restricted to a woman who cannot conceive and bear children. But it can also include many other things of life of different struggle that we go through as we go along the journey of our lives. For example, when a man loses his his job or his ability to provide for his family, then that is also a form of baroness for himself, &gt;&gt; right? because it can make him feel unfulfilled &gt;&gt; and may even feel like he's a failure. And men don't like to fall because God's designed men to may even experience feeling of an insecurity. And so all of this can become like a trial of baroness in his life. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's an every one of us in our life's journey, we have a certain experience in our journey that it seems like a baroness in our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. It may be in our family uh family members, in our sibling groups, in our our workplace. We can encounter something that we struggle with and sometimes we feel that we are unproductive, uselessness, unfulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's bring a a a something a depression or something in our lives. &gt;&gt; Right. And so there are many things that people can suffer from the effect of some form of botherness in their life. And then there's maybe some person is trying to get to to get uh some weaknesses in their life but cannot seems to overcome it. Each and every one of us has a weaknesses that we are trying to overcome and sometimes we cannot overcome it and sometime we come to the point that we question ourselves. Am I really saved? Am I really a son and daughters of God? &gt;&gt; And so as we go along, as we go along our our lives, we are exposed to and become more aware of our own personal weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So our experience with God is just personal. Yes. &gt;&gt; Only you know your weaknesses. &gt;&gt; As we travel in this life's journey, you know your weaknesses. And when you know your weaknesses, that's the good thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because all things works together for good to them that love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And it makes you more humble. &gt;&gt; It makes you become more merciful towards others. &gt;&gt; Because it help us humble and in turn make us more merciful toward others who are struggling with their own struggle. Everybody is struggling. &gt;&gt; True. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we notice that many women in the Bible that conceived and gave birth to children easily, they looked down on and in some cases mock those of the women who were barren. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Usually that is the case. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is just human nature. The attitude is that it is easy for me. &gt;&gt; So why is that easy for you? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; In other words, you cannot compare your experience to others. That's right. &gt;&gt; But what is easy for one person who is not barren in one area of their life, it can be very hard for other person to conceive and bear fruit in that same area of life. Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so all of our life stories are different from each other &gt;&gt; with different struggle, different trouble. But the same God who is writing the mystery of his grace to one person &gt;&gt; is also writing the mystery of grace to another person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why we are not to look down on one another's person's struggle just because that is not our area of barness. Right? &gt;&gt; Just like Paul wrote to a Galatian, he said in Galatians chapter 6 verse1, he said, "Brethren," in other words, brothers and sisters, listen, if a man be overtaken in fault, ye which are spiritual, &gt;&gt; restore sex and one in the spirit of meekness. &gt;&gt; Amen. considering thyself, &gt;&gt; considering thy own struggle, considering thy own trials, &gt;&gt; how God lift you up in the time that you are down. &gt;&gt; You need to consider that and apply it to others. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, you are just another human being with the same potential to fall under similar condition because of having the same human weaknesses. Right. &gt;&gt; So bear ye one another's burden and so fulfill the law of Christ. &gt;&gt; And what is the law of Christ? Love one another. &gt;&gt; Encourage one another. Amen. Hallelujah. For it himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So that's the struggle in barness. And we can see that baroness is not permanent. &gt;&gt; Amen. is just for a season. &gt;&gt; That's why my title tonight is the season of baroness. &gt;&gt; We realize in reading the scripture that whenever there is a great promise of God about to fulfill, there is always a season of barness that is associated with the people of God that are connected to the fulfillment of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of this, there's a reproach that the people have to &gt;&gt; a season. Remember that we are nor sheep. from But they waited. &gt;&gt; How about Rebecca? We are a type of &gt;&gt; Rebecca was the answer to Elazar's prayer. &gt;&gt; In other words, Rebecca was blessed. He recognized her day and his messenger. &gt;&gt; He recognized the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he meet Isaac. &gt;&gt; It seems a good fairy tale. And they live &gt;&gt; happily ever after. But it didn't happen that way, &gt;&gt; right? Come on. &gt;&gt; Because she realized that she was &gt;&gt; Barent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then after all that great start to Rebecca's life, as the story goes on, she find out that she's barren woman. And then her whole world of what that seems like a perfect fairy tale of love story all of a sudden hallelujah to the way that it looks to her had become a dismal end just like we sometimes we can shout oh we received the message of the hour I followed the message of the hour we received the revelation of God amen that I am a part of him before the foundation of the word but then all of a sudden along your life's journey you experience in sometimes a season of barness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you become be tested &gt;&gt; your testimony that I am sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You will be mocked. Where is the fruit that you are sons and daughters of God? &gt;&gt; Where is it? Why are you sick? Why are you have trouble? Why are you this? Amen. What happened? What happened to be you being a sons and daughters of God? What happened your to your testimony that you are predestinated son and daughter to god &gt;&gt; but remember we are a son of the promise. &gt;&gt; We are the people of the promise &gt;&gt; and the scripture has a pattern in order for us to look upon &gt;&gt; because God never change his ways and his pattern. So what happened in our lives in our journey, we need to look it back into the word of God and look what God is doing during the time because there is always a season of barness &gt;&gt; in our life. &gt;&gt; But barness is not permanent. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet there was a great purpose that God had for placing that season of barness in her life. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Everything has a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember that not not only Sarah, praise God or Rebecca, Hallelujah, Rachel are barren, but there are seven women recorded that is barren. &gt;&gt; Rachel was also barren. Hannah was barren. The mother of Samson, praise God, Noah was barren barren. Seven women, &gt;&gt; seven churches, seven seal and seven thunders. &gt;&gt; All of this we speak about the bride in these last days because we can identify our experience to the seven women in the old testament because they are shadows of reality in our day. &gt;&gt; So what God has been doing and hallelujah because God has a pattern he cannot change his pattern. We just need to recognize our position in these last days. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so there must be a season will be the time of barrenness that take place just before the promise of God &gt;&gt; because baroness first before the promise being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we see this showed in the lives of the seven women and suffer the reproach of barrenness for a season. as the prophet preached about the reproach for the cause of Christ or for the cause of the word that he preached in 1962. Baroness bring reproach. What's the scuffness of baroness? be his cup means to not to ridicule &gt;&gt; the approach of barrenness first was speaking about Miserah and they had see to stand their reproach of being barren for all those years she was nearly 100 years old she was 90 but the word of God that said she would also be a princess of this child amen she will to be a princess. So she stand the her baroness for 25 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She was 90 but the word of God said that she would also be the princess mother of his child. And she and Abraham baron both of their bodies as well as dead. But yet they never doubted that word one bit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the key word because when God gave you the promise as a believer you hold on to the promise. But then you need to struggle in life. But God is testing your faith. &gt;&gt; Not only is testing if you can pass or not, but testing means to manifest the faith that you receive. Because the scripture said Abraham and Sarah believed. &gt;&gt; And it's counted for them for their righteousness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But yet they never doubted that word one bit. But they had to stand it first. And then Hallelujah. God keep his word in the dark born and his seed is like the sand of the sea or the stars of heaven. God always answer his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. Baroness first then Isaac and we know that Isaac represent the new body in types. He's also a type of the Lord Jesus Christ. And he is the he is also a type of the of the the son of God coming to meet us in the air. She could rejoice over all that she had happened in her life. She met the the messenger of her day. She met Isaac. She was chosen. She was blessed. She had seen the supernatural guiding her right from her first encounter with Elizer at the evening time &gt;&gt; and all the way along her journey's life to her marriage to when you conclude it and they lived happily ever after. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then right after her marriage with Isaac then everything is to have gone wrong. Poor Rebecca because he had discovered that she was barren and all of her dreams of fulfillments to have disappeared in a pop of smoke journey. We are too blessed. We receive the message of the hour. We are now in the process of changing our bodies. We heard the voice. We heard the shout. But along life's journey sometimes we can say that am I really when trouble come I'm easily discouraged and suddenly mention my name do this he do that he do that I recently reacted &gt;&gt; individually you know what's what what you've been growing through. &gt;&gt; And so Rebecca was sad because knowing that she was barren, she cannot produce exactly according to the promise. Rebecca was sad, Hannah was sad, Rachel was sad, and we also find ourselves sad during the time when we discover areas of life that burn for certain things. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no excuse &gt;&gt; because as a as a bride of Jesus Christ, as a believer, we a season of baronness &gt;&gt; that we need to recognize in order for us to go through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So baroness brings feelings of failure and unfulfillment and not designed to be said, &gt;&gt; right? And so this is why we find that many people would sometimes try to paint pregnancy and manufacture happiness in order to combat the sadness or barness that they are experiencing in their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the message the resurrection of Jesus Christ uh he preached in 1956 and if you notice it's when you are discouraged that when the devil really can pour it on you. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you are experiencing this season of baroness in your life, you feel unfulfilled, you feel failure, you feel something that you are not productive. As the prophet said, it's when you are discouraged when the devil can really pour it out on you. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing he's watching. If you are discouraged in your journey, then he can pour out &gt;&gt; whatever he is in mind &gt;&gt; because it's only waiting &gt;&gt; for his great opportunity. &gt;&gt; Remember that the devil don't die. &gt;&gt; The scripture said, "Resist the devil and he will flee from you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He will just flee, but you he will not die. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So when he flee, he will wait for another moment. and come back &gt;&gt; and give discouragement. That is his very purpose. &gt;&gt; He cannot kill us but he can give us discouragement and fulfill praise God desperation in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can pour that's when he gets you. If you come to the church say well I don't know I don't know whether I'll get any better or not. I've been prayed for twice. Oh my. You might as well go home. That's all. If that is our attitude going to church &gt;&gt; as the prophets, you might as well go home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as a believer of Christ, we come to church and we want God to speak unto us. &gt;&gt; Whoever it be that stand in the pulpit, God is using that mouthpiece to speak unto his people. And whatever your needs, &gt;&gt; if you have the right mental attitude, &gt;&gt; when you come into the church, whatever, &gt;&gt; right mental attitude towards his promise, &gt;&gt; he will make it come to pass. &gt;&gt; So whatever your needs while you come &gt;&gt; expecting that wherever two or three are gathered, he will be in our midst. You just need to have right mental attitude towards his promise and he will fulfill it &gt;&gt; because God hallelujah he will not meet God until he fulfill his own word. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; If you come to the church and say well I don't know I don't know. &gt;&gt; You need to be specific when you come to church. Lord I want something from you tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord I want something. I don't want to get out from this church being not being filled. &gt;&gt; I want to be fed. Lord, &gt;&gt; I need to go to the church to be fed. Don't go to church. I don't know. I don't know. You just better be go home and sleep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What he's talking about? He is talking about a person who receive and believe the truth of the seed of the word of God but then their life seems to remain barren from the manifestations of the fruit of the promise of that word &gt;&gt; that is the sad part you have the right to be discouraged but when you can cast that aside &gt;&gt; you need to cast aside your reasoning cast aside your your idea cast aside your fear cast aside your feelings things. Cast aside your everything as Paul said in 2 Corinthians 10:4, casting down imagination &gt;&gt; and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity, every talk &gt;&gt; to the obedience of Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cast aside those feeling of uncertainty. Cast aside those feelings of fear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't want you to be proning. &gt;&gt; God wants you to be happy. &gt;&gt; Are you happy tonight? &gt;&gt; If not, be happy. &gt;&gt; Make a smile. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil put you down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you are in church, you need to be happy. This David said, "I'm so glad when they said that to me. Let us go into the house of the Lord &gt;&gt; because we have something to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because brother Ron is here. No, we have to rejoice because our pastor is here. No, you need to rejoice because the word of God is our &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the word of anybody but his word. They are spirit and they are life. &gt;&gt; And if there is life, there is an emotion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is an amen. There is there is a smile. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your beautiful smile. I appreciate it. &gt;&gt; God wants you to be happy. The human heart was made to be happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what the prophet worry will cause cancer. &gt;&gt; If you have so be careful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not to worry too much &gt;&gt; because worry causes cancer. If you worries about sicknesses, go back to his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that health all thy iniquity. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember your benefits. &gt;&gt; What is your benefits? Your healing, your overcoming everything. &gt;&gt; Because God dies for you. Christ died for you and he said, "It is done. It is finished." &gt;&gt; And remember the benefits of how he gave his life for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He give you healing not only in your spirit realm, in your soul, in your physical. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Worry will cause cancer and temper will cause cancer. Don't never be upset. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet is trying to show us that we need to recognize the season of barness in our life &gt;&gt; so that we will not be worrying too much. &gt;&gt; When you worry too much sometimes your temper become &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; uh over overdose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't never be upset. Just walk in his love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just walk in his love. Amen. Say, knowing that you're walking in him, &gt;&gt; that is the key word &gt;&gt; in our struggle, in our trials, in a barness that you feel your banners. This is the key word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Knowing &gt;&gt; that you're walking in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you know that you're walking with him in the midst of your struggle and discouragement? You are still holding unto the promise of the word. That is that you know that you're still walking in Christ. &gt;&gt; Knowing means hallelujah recognizing your day. &gt;&gt; Remember he never leave you nor forsake you. You need to recognize &gt;&gt; and realizing and perceiving understanding that we are already in him. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Not we will be but we are in him &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the word. &gt;&gt; And even King Solomon catch the revelation of his relationship with his God. &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 8 verse 22 he said the Lord possessed me in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. beginning of his ways before his works of old. &gt;&gt; Amen. King Solomon already saw himself with his creator. &gt;&gt; I was set. The Lord possessed me in the beginning. In other words, I am with him in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Of his way before his old works. I was set up from everlasting from the beginning or the ever the earth was &gt;&gt; and greater than Solomon was here. And he said before the earth was created before there was atom before there was a bullet kill I was already in his mind &gt;&gt; because I am part hallelujah of his attributes I was already in him. &gt;&gt; Oh thank you Lord. And Colon 8 verse 24, when there was no depths, I was brought forth. And when there was no fountains abounding with water, before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth, &gt;&gt; while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the word, when he prepared the heavens, I was there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he set a compass upon the face of the earth or the depth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he established the clouds above, when he strengthened the fountains of the deep. When he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment, when he appointed the fountains of the earth, then I was by him &gt;&gt; as one brought up with him. I was daily his delight rejoicing always before me. I was his delight. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "Are you glad to be a Christian?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're glad to be a Christian, it is not our old will, but it is God's desire for us to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; As Solomon said, I was by him and one brought with him and I was daily. I was daily his delight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Rejoicing always before him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. said, "Knowing that you're walking in him &gt;&gt; because we are his daily delight." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And nothing can harm you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can the devil harm you be? Because you are already in him &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world, before he created the mountain, the hill, everything &gt;&gt; that we can see around here. We are already in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; And the Lord possess me &gt;&gt; and the Lord possess us. &gt;&gt; Speaking about eternal security. He already possess us. &gt;&gt; A sense of security. We are in walking in the word of God. &gt;&gt; No one can harm us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who can harm us? Satan cannot harm us. &gt;&gt; He need to ask permission first. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. So it's his business to take care of what he took himself. &gt;&gt; Remember when the seal was open, the mighty angel come came down with an open book and he revealed the content of the book &gt;&gt; and the content of the book is our name written in the book. &gt;&gt; How do we know that our name is God? The mystery is being shown to you. &gt;&gt; And you responded to the mystery of this day. &gt;&gt; The mystery is you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The mystery is you and I. &gt;&gt; We saw our name in the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because he said that it's his business to take care of what he took himself at the opening of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; He said that he gathered his subject unto himself. &gt;&gt; And who he is his subject? The blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That is the very purpose that he came down, open the book and restore to us. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's his business to take care of us &gt;&gt; because when he opened the seven seal, he gathered all &gt;&gt; he subject the bride of Jesus Christ. So, he's taking care of us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember, he never go back. &gt;&gt; When he came down, &gt;&gt; he put his feet upon the sand in the land &gt;&gt; in the sea in the land and said, "It is done. It is finished." &gt;&gt; No one can harm us. No man can pluck them from my father's hand. No one can pluck them from my father's hand. &gt;&gt; Remember that eternal security. You are sealed until the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; Because no other one, no other man sealed you. But it was the Holy Ghost that sealed you. &gt;&gt; No one can flock you out from my from my No one can pluck them from my father's hand cuz there's nothing can harm you. There's neither power, earthly rulers, spiritual forces can override God's promises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He cannot override the promises of God. Maybe if your p failure or whatsoever things that you struggle, he cannot override what's God's promises. That's why no power, ruler and darkness word, praise God that separate you from the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Things present, things future, nothing can separate us from him. &gt;&gt; No current hardship, no future uncertainty can interfere. We are in him. &gt;&gt; So whatever the situation now, there will be a lot of riess and everything. But praise &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; we will not be discouraged. &gt;&gt; Nothing future nothing praise God present future can separate us from the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No hardship of the future uncertainty can separate us from the love of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; We are in him &gt;&gt; and we never come in by our own will. &gt;&gt; That's right. Remember no we don't we don't look for God but God is looking for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why even though we are in the season of barness remember that we are already blessed by just recognizing who we are &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; And we never come in by our own will. He by choice. &gt;&gt; He has no choice. He by choice elected us and brought in to him. It was his choice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No one dictate him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was his choice &gt;&gt; and elected us unto himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the greatest of all them. It's the father who take cares of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who got any more power than God? So what kind of power have you got over you to take care of you? What kind of power is taking care of you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The whole power that's created the universe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we cannot say amen as if we are not really convinced. &gt;&gt; Maybe the first time you heard it but when you go home you meditate it and thank God for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he called us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Separate us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the power that created the universe, don't look at your present situation that you cannot appreciate what he has done for you. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes if you look and compare yourself to others, &gt;&gt; that's the time that Satan &gt;&gt; want to come in. &gt;&gt; Don't compare yourself to others. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May it be material, but compare yourself to the word. &gt;&gt; And the word said you are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You are washed by the blood of Jesus Christ. You are sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ. You are washed by the washing of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to compare yourself by in the word, not on somebody else. &gt;&gt; And you begin, praise God, to meditate upon who you are. Because if you know who you are, then you can act accordingly. &gt;&gt; Remember that the brother Brandon's parable about the black slave. &gt;&gt; He was slave. They ate the same. They they sleep the same. But he act &gt;&gt; different from all the slaves. &gt;&gt; Although they ate the same, they they been treated the same. But because he knows who he is, &gt;&gt; he was the prince in their tribe. So he act accordingly according to the knowledge of who he is. &gt;&gt; That's why if you know you are sons and daughters of God, don't look and compare your others &gt;&gt; to some others but compare yourself to the word of God because you are predestinated sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You act different. &gt;&gt; Don't compare yourself to others because all these material things are temporary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look yourself to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Enjoy being sons and daughters of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And took the solar system and blew that and every star went to its place as sure and he watches over you. Amen. That's the kind of father we have. &gt;&gt; A good job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you cannot comprehend. Just go home and read the word and meditate &gt;&gt; how grateful we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the greater power who created all the solars and universe is in you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And no one can separate you from that power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So as a believer, we must realize that there is a season of barrenness before the promise of God is fulfilled. And there is a necessity of a reproach of barness that we will have to bear for the cause of the word. Hallelujah. We have a pattern to look at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why we need to recognize we are sons. Okay. We have a season of barness in our life. &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be despared. Many will show their colors during this barness and season of life. You receive the message. You make you you claim your sons and daughters of God. You claim you are proinate but along life's journey it seems that your life is unproductive and many will show the colors and drop off in their faith because actually their faith was based upon the reasoning of the word &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; rather than revelations of the word of God revealed to them by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As brother said if the if someone put you in somebody will put you out. That's right. &gt;&gt; But the bride of Jesus Christ is based upon the revelation. &gt;&gt; And upon this rock of revelation, I will build my church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And no one can can pluck you in and you pluck it out because it the Holy Ghost that make the foundation upon this rock of revelation, &gt;&gt; the gates of hell cannot prevail against it. &gt;&gt; You will stand. If you can stand alone, you will stand still. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so because of this problem of baroness that we have seen over the years, there has been such a pressure on maybe many ministers or churches in the message to try to prove some form of proof &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; or manifestation of pregnancy and life in the churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when brother Ron preached about those altar calls those emotion we believe in all that and agree with brother wrong &gt;&gt; because without because if the spirit of God is in it we can feel we can express our emotion. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we don't make it a tradition that every service there's an alcohol, every service there's somebody running, every service there is shouting and dance, every service. No, that's become sometimes they don't have the revelation and they and they and they go in that direction just to prove oh we are alive and we are alive and they just mock those who don't have that kind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we are they only vindicated because in our church there is a there is a jumping and shouting and altar call and all these mighty signs the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; But for the real bride we are just feeding upon the revealed word of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; We may not jump and shout and soever but I believe every word we are watching every word that we receive &gt;&gt; because the revival of the bride is by the revelation of the word not by emotion or champing and dancing whatsoever. We believe in all of that, &gt;&gt; but I rather have the revealed word &gt;&gt; that we live up &gt;&gt; our faith a little bit higher. &gt;&gt; Not a little bit, but full. &gt;&gt; Come have Jen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will show you things that's to come. &gt;&gt; That is our revival. The things that is to come. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some will maybe shout yam around the church building that is okay if it's done in a genuine way. &gt;&gt; We believe in all of that as brother Ron preaches beautifully about that and maybe somebody is against that. Oh, brother Ron is not preaching that or right. No, we believe in all of that. &gt;&gt; But we don't make it a tradition. &gt;&gt; We believe in the genuine moving of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; But I rather have the word of God being preached to us &gt;&gt; than those emotions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So nobody wants to be sad because of being married woman that is receiving seed but is not bringing forth life. Amen. So a woman is a receiving the message but there was no life. So that's impersonated. They make it something that they are alive and produces that they are alive. And then you will sometimes see that this same one will often look down upon even mock of those of whom they consider to be barren. &gt;&gt; Ah there was no shouting there speaking time. There's no healing. Ah there's barren church. No vindication. &gt;&gt; That is really the evil that we are now in the last days. &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Peter 3:4, he said, "Knowing this first, &gt;&gt; that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust, &gt;&gt; walking after their own interpretations about the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; and saying, where is the promise of his coming? For since the father fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." And so we must realize and accept that there will of necessity be a scoffer in the message. Do you agree? &gt;&gt; Because it was a prophecy that in the last days there will be scoffers. &gt;&gt; True &gt;&gt; of the message of this hour that will rise up because one of the mysteries that the message open up to us in the mystery of the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; and that mystery will only be made known to an elected group of people. No one can recognize the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Only the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why we can say special class of people. When it comes to salvation, everybody have the opportunity to be saved because God so loved the world &gt;&gt; that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him. &gt;&gt; He not bearest but come unto repentance. &gt;&gt; Everybody has a chance. But to sit on the throne, it will be just an elected group of people &gt;&gt; which is called the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must realize the mystery will be known to an unelected group. So from Sarah to Elizabeth, every one of these seven seven women in the Bible are showing us in type &gt;&gt; a different portion of the mystery of the barren woman in these last days at the harvest time. Because each of these women barness preceded the coming of Christ in type. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sarah Barness came before the coming of Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Isaac was the promised son which is type of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Rebecca Barnes came Jacob and Jacob was the father of 12 pretaks which is a type of Christ our father. Rachel Barnes came Joseph and Joseph is a perfect type of God. In Joseph there is perfection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; After Hannah's Barness came Samuel which when he was rejected God said that it wasn't Samuel that they were rejected but it was God &gt;&gt; that they were rejected &gt;&gt; because prophet represent God to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was the coming of Christ, the coming of God because the prophet introduced &gt;&gt; God to the people. &gt;&gt; And Manoah's wife Barnes was over. She gave birth to Samson. And we know that Samson was the one who died between the two pillars. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With his arm outreach or who gave his life freely in order to bring victory to his people. Just like Christ on the cross who died with his arm outreach between two thieves to bring victory to his people. It is done. It is finished. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; When the Shunomite woman Barnes was over, she gave birth to the promised son that came the prophecy of Elisha of whom then died and then was risen back to life again. Type of Christ, death, burial, and resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Elizabeth Baroness came, John the Baptist, the very forerunner of Christ, whose ministry was to make the pathway, prepare the way for Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So everything that comes our way had a purpose in our life. &gt;&gt; Our barness shows something &gt;&gt; of Christ in the bride. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. So and all these barren women were showing of a prophecy of the end time hour of great gentile church woman that has been barren for a long time and that endure the reproach of barrenness. Amen. Before the coming of Christ of which she has been promised to give birth to the word of this hour by being uniting with the word under the ministry of Elisha's anointing. So this overshadowing of an angel with a message is that is what is producing the coming of the promised son. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the angel overshadowing Mary, it produced Christ. &gt;&gt; So we have angel in these last days &gt;&gt; that will produce Christ in each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the message it is the rising of the sun, the last coat. So I told you I will not hold you too long. So, and he being the groom, the bride has to come forth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Has to come forth. &gt;&gt; Because this we are now living at the end of the age. &gt;&gt; All the mystery of God is being revealed. &gt;&gt; So, it is the rising of the sun. So, our maturity now is in the rising of the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. is no longer under the seven church candlestick because the candle light cannot produce maturity in the bride. &gt;&gt; So it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The rising of the son of man in these last days. So we are feeding &gt;&gt; on the word body of the son of man &gt;&gt; in these last days &gt;&gt; to take away all the gness out of us. Amen. We are no longer preaching about do this, do that, do this, do that. But we are preaching about knowing who we are. &gt;&gt; Because you know, if we know who we where we came from, we know where we're going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can act according to the revelation that we are sons and daughters of God, we will not become son, but we are already son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the word, we just recognize take away the amia in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes before we recite the message, we jump from one church to another because there was something in our heart looking for something &gt;&gt; very familiar that we we jump from Baptist to every church that we But then one day, hallelujah, there was a shout that let us know who we are and we recognize that we are sons and daughters. Take away the amnesia. Yes. &gt;&gt; And then I said, "Where were you when I &gt;&gt; Where were you when I when I created the the foundation of the world?" Where sons and daughters of God are shouting for joy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he being the groom, the bride has to come forth because it's part of him. &gt;&gt; We are feeding upon the son of men ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not his message but it was the message of the son of man &gt;&gt; and it came only be the manifestations of the fulfilling of all the revelations any other has to spoke of the bride. &gt;&gt; Look at what he is saying here. All the woman in the Bible that represented the end time bride of his hour. This anti-ribe can only be the manifestation of all the revelations of all other women in the Bible. If Christ is hidden in the volumes of the book, then the bride is also hidden in the volumes of the book. &gt;&gt; All the women in the Old Testament is just a shadow of what will be the manifestations of the bride in these last days. &gt;&gt; Their journey is our journey. Their experience is our experience. We can identify ourselves by each and every one of them &gt;&gt; because it was Christ in them. As the prophet said, it was Christ in Moses. It was Christ in David. It was Christ in Elijah. It was Christ in Daniel. It was Christ in Luther. It was Christ in Wesley. It was Christ in. Now, it was Christ to the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are just the manifestation of those shadows. And we are the prophecy the reality of those shallow in this lifetime. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It seems that anybody and not and not everybody's enjoying it but it's just okay because God has a time and season to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; We are not in a hurry because everything is under control. &gt;&gt; Everything has a season and a time &gt;&gt; that he can grow. Not everybody grow &gt;&gt; the same. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; What we do is just we just preach the word &gt;&gt; because the word of God is a spirit and they are life. &gt;&gt; If you are a seed, there will be a a release of the anointing to quicken that seed. &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, let every seed bring forth to be kind and it was already being spoken. So shall it be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the anointing that is being released. So if you are a seed of God, whether you like it or not, you will come to the understanding of who you are. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; No excuse. &gt;&gt; If you cannot receive it, then maybe you're not part of it. But if you are part of it, you will come &gt;&gt; to the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you cannot help yourself. &gt;&gt; Even you try to run or forsake it. Hallelujah. You cannot forsake it because you are part of the word. How can you forsake that you are part of the word? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It can only manifest if it does something different from the groom. It isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. She is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Eve was actually just Adam in bride form &gt;&gt; and Adam was Eve in bridegroom form &gt;&gt; because they were both a part of one spirit and one flesh because he was part of Adam's spirit and also a part of Adam's flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By being created from his rib. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it took both Adam and Eve to both manifest in order to fully reveal the full mystery of one body of Adam which was both masculine and feminine. So we have the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Christ is not fully revealed unless the bride is revealed. &gt;&gt; Now that the bride is already being revealed, it's time to go home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, "And men and women are one. The woman taken from his side. She had taken a spirit, the feminine spirit from him. The flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics. The wife, the spirit of him and the flesh of him put it together and made mechanics and dynamics. &gt;&gt; We have arrived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They said that this is the turning point. &gt;&gt; But we have reached the point of no return. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are not turning. We have already turned a long time ago. &gt;&gt; We have turned from denomination understanding. We have turned from man-made ideas understanding. We have now reached the point of no return &gt;&gt; because we have already heard the shout, the voice and we are waiting for the trump which is the changing of our body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are now in the process &gt;&gt; of changing our body. &gt;&gt; We are no longer turning corners. We have already turned a long time ago. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. We have recognized our day, our message, our time. And we have reached the point of no return. We are lonely waiting for the trump. And in the last days, the trump of God, we are now gathering &gt;&gt; together in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We will be united by the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this last day, shall we stand? &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust that this short sermon will give an encourage to each and every one of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you cannot grasp it, just &gt;&gt; just meditate on this word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 5:13 to him. For we are members of his body, &gt;&gt; of his flesh, and of his bone. &gt;&gt; For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they too shall be one. &gt;&gt; This is a great mystery. &gt;&gt; But I speak concerning Christ and the church. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The greatest mystery is between Christ and his church being revealed in this last day. God bless you everybody. &gt;&gt; Praise you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you begin to see there was a season of barrenness &gt;&gt; and every time in those seven women, you see that there must have been a time of mental struggle &gt;&gt; for those that were recipients of the word yet didn't see it manifest when they thought it should manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there must have been struggles. &gt;&gt; Who am I? I thought God said &gt;&gt; year after year it's not happening. It's &gt;&gt; you know but &gt;&gt; whenever you see an Adam look for an Eve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whenever you see an Abraham look for a Sarah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that principle? Because when she comes on the scene, she is just revealing there's another one there that's calling her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So at the time when it looked like an impossibility, &gt;&gt; God said, "Are you done? &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. Don't try to manufacture it. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you what. I have a I have a handmade. &gt;&gt; And even if I can't do it, perhaps Hagar. Yeah, that'll be it. Ishmael, may he live and be my No, it ain't Ishmael. It's Isaac. &gt;&gt; God had to rebuke him. &gt;&gt; Hey, so many times we try to figure it out. Hey, listen. You don't have to manufacture it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. &gt;&gt; And in the time of impossibility, in the time when everything seems to be, oh, when uh Abraham was as good as dead and his wife was good as dead and it looked like no possibility, God says, "Okay, are you done?" No. Stand back and see &gt;&gt; see the God come on the scene. I will produce it. &gt;&gt; It's all about him. It's all about him. What What are they playing here? &gt;&gt; Let your word be born. [Music] &gt;&gt; Beaten and warm hardly a place for a king to be born. &gt;&gt; Choose some place special to reveal his majesty. Oh, I know. I give him control. He'll be born in me. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. [Music] living inside this house of clay and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Oh, outward and outwardly on nothing. Not much to behold, unlike a place for his work to unfold. But I'll just yield this vessel and let him have his way from glory to glory. He'll change me day by day. Your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start live inside this house of clay and mold it every day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. [Music] You know, when you look at the word of God and you see the supernatural events, angels appearing to Mary, blessed art thou Mary among all women, for God hath chosen you. You found favor in his eyes, &gt;&gt; and God has chosen you to be an appointed vessel &gt;&gt; to bring forth the Messiah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And she pondered those things in her heart at the salutation of this angel." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't we ponder? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't we struggle with it? &gt;&gt; And you know, the word could not pregnantate that and bring it to bring it to fruition until she said these words, "Be it unto me. according to thy word. Don't figure it out, saints. Don't try to manufacture it. Just say these words, be it unto me. &gt;&gt; According to thy word. &gt;&gt; It's all about him. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; And just surrendering and let your vessel &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; be yielded to him. Amen. Heavenly Father, I thank you for this word tonight, reminding us, Father, of our humanity and carnality so much of the time and a time of barrenness when we wonder, is it really true? Will it really happen? Oh, I've waited for so long and it hasn't happened. Maybe I need to manufacture it. Maybe ah maybe I'll give this promise off to another bosom and to another womb. No, father. But let us say, all right, I see it's all up to God. So therefore, I will do as Ruth did. I will rest. I will lay my &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; self at your feet until there's a rising of the sun. And Boaz says, "Stay here. &gt;&gt; Stay here until the rise." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because this is the time of the kinsman redeemer to make himself known to come before the elders, take off his shoe and to redeem. Father, we thank you. We thank you for all the things that we see that are happening around the world that you have given us the of understanding. [Music] The world looks at just events and happenings and I'm sure it was no different than the days of Jesus Christ when your word was being fulfilled and they crucified Jesus Christ. They wondered until even a centurion when lightning flashed there was darkness about the midday when he gave up the ghost and he said truly this was the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father God I pray for the revelation of the Holy Spirit upon each and every one because father it's only you that can open our eyes. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, Father, I pray may we embrace the promise. Never doubt or have any kind of unbelief, but say, "Father, be it unto me according to thy word." I thank you. I praise you. May we ponder these things tonight as we go home, as you lay on your pillow. Quit looking at yourself, but look to the promise. &gt;&gt; God will bring his word to pass. He will &gt;&gt; in its season. Father, I thank you and I praise you in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen. That means so be it. Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; That means so be it. God bless you. We'll consider ourselves dismissed. We'll sing one uh one more song. Do you have a song in your heart there, Brother Gray? &gt;&gt; Um made me glad. &gt;&gt; He has made me glad. &gt;&gt; That's right. Are you glad? He said, if if you've received the word, you're happy, &gt;&gt; huh? Are you going to sit there and frown and and woe is me and and be like little Tigger and and you know or Eeyore or that? Yeah, I think it's Eeyore. Huh, Andy? It's Eeyore. They got a little black cloud and it's raining. Woe is me. What? Hey, no. Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's get a little joy in our heart, a little smile on our face, &gt;&gt; and I I will bless the Lord forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's take a moment right now and let's bless the Lord with our voice together, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I willless bless the Lord forever. [Music] And I will bless you at all times. And he has delivered me from all fear. And he has set my feet upon a rock. [Music] And I will not be moved. And I'll say of the Lord, you are my shield. You're my strength. You're my portion. Deliverer, my shelter, strong tower, my very present. help in time of need. And who have I inherited but you there's none that I desire beside you [Music] and you have made me glad. And I'll say of the Lord, you are my shield. You're my strength, my portion, deliverer, my shelter, strong tower, my very present, help in time of need. You are my shield. You're my strength, my portion. Deliverer, my shelter, strong tower, my very present, helping in time of need. Amen. It's been good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Amen. God bless you all. You're dismissed tonight. Go in Jesus name. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hey. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
