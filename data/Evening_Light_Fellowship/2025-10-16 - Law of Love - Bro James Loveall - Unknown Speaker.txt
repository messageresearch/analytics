This from our sister Maria Arasola. I'd like to give the praise and glory back to God for healing my right shoulder. Last Friday, I woke up with severe pain on my right shoulder. I could only raise my arm at less than a 30° angle from my shoulder. I drove with my left hand only. I could support the steering wheel with the grip of my right hand. And since I was in severe pain when I angled my right arm, I just had to drive with my left hand. Once I started driving, I could not adjust the temperature in the car. I was in so much pain that even wiping the kitchen countertop. I just continued praying for God to take away my shoulder pain so I could use my right hand normally. I just kept praying, believing, and thanking the Lord for his healing power, for he has already done it before the foundation of the world. My daughter asked me if I wanted to have it checked. I said to her, "I do thank the Lord for good doctors and I appreciate these doctors that help their patients, but I was praying, Lord, can you just heal me uh heal me without me going to see the doctor?" The following day, my shoulder felt better, and every day the pain was diminishing until 3 days later, I could do a full range of motion on my right arm and now the pain is completely gone. Praise and glory be to our God and Savior Jesus Christ. God bless you all. Amen. So thankful for the Lord touching her shoulder. Also have a praise report from our sisterh Gracia Castor just saying God is very faithful and has answered my prayer about finding a job. Our sister Gracia also has a prayer request having faith that God will heal my sick coworker. And then from our sister Maria also a prayer request. Please pray for traveling mercies to the Arcasola girls. They will be leaving to the Bethlehe youth camp in South Carolina in a few hours. Definitely pray for traveling mercies for them. And then uh Sister Devel asking prayer for son Isaac asked to pray for the ranch foreman in Texas named Tyler. He is hospitalized with blood clots in his legs. Tyler has already had two surgeries to correct this. Certainly remember Tyler in prayer. And then Sister Mary Hail, please remember Randy Hail in prayer. He's in the hospital with an infection and bone infection. His doctors will be doing surgery on his foot tomorrow to help it. He is streaming from his hospital room tonight. Amen. God is certainly mindful of everything that we have need of. Brother Johnny Green, if if you could just come take these needs to the Lord. While he's coming, we also do just want to make a quick announcement. Family night is going to be Friday, October 31st, 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Signup sheets are posted on the bulletin boards. All are welcome to attend. So, look for something like this on the bulletin boards. Amen. Johnny, God bless you. to go to tonight. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Lord Jesus, what an honor it is to stand in your presence &gt;&gt; to be able to confess our sins knowing you're faithful and just to forgive us. And Lord, as we come before you tonight, Lord, with all these needs, we pray, dear God, that you would be with each one. There are serious needs, especially Brother Randy in the hospital tonight.

We're so thankful, &gt;&gt; Father, that we have a house to gather in. That &gt;&gt; Lord, that we can come and sing your praises, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we can tell you how great you are, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; that in the good times, in the bad times, Lord, you're the you're the God of all creation, Lord. You're God upon our throne, [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord. how humbled we are to be your children. And &gt;&gt; we just humble ourselves once again in your presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; Asking that you would just come by our way in a special way, oh God. That you would speak words of life and truth, Lord. &gt;&gt; Give us what we have need of this evening. Walk the aisles and talk to your children, Lord. We are a needy people. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, be with us this service. &gt;&gt; Be with the needs of your people. And Father, you see this prayer closet. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm a nobody. But Father, if a faith of a mother as a desire upon her heart. Oh God, I'm asking that you would grant that desire &gt;&gt; that if you can stop the plane of a of a prophet going by through town and you would have a prophet go by her way, oh God, that &gt;&gt; it was by a prayer of a mother. And so we're just asking that you would meet this need, oh God, &gt;&gt; and let the faith arise this evening, &gt;&gt; Lord. If your children have a desire, a need within them, &gt;&gt; Lord, may they reach out and touch the gar. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We just commit this service into your hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. You love the Lord this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's so good to us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, musicians. &gt;&gt; It's certainly good to be home. If you have your Bibles, you can turn to First John 4. We thank you for your prayers. We are up there with Brother Lindsay. Um we had such a special time. I bring you greetings from brother Lindsay in the church there and a special greetings to his favorite son, brother Ben. I think every son that moves away becomes the favorite son. And uh yeah, we had a wonderful time this weekend. It was just a a short trip up the mountains and it was beautiful to see the fall and changing of the leaves. For you Phoenicians that don't know what that is, it's where the leaves begin to change color and we don't have that much here, but it is beautiful to see. And it is &gt;&gt; um my wife was able to go up there with me and actually my parents went up there with me um for the service. They had like a four o'clock service on Sunday and we just had a wonderful time. Um, I do want to wish my wife a happy birthday, a late birthday. Um, the Lord's good and he has blessed me with a wonderful wife and certainly honored and we just trust the Lord give her a wonderful year. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to First John 4 in verse 7. And it says, "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God, and he that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that he has sent his only begotten son into the world, that we might live through him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Wherein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us &gt;&gt; and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought to love also love one another. &gt;&gt; No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. Turn over to second Peter 1. Second Peter 1 and verse two. Very familiar scripture of the stature of a perfect man. And verse two says, "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according to as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding and great great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine divine nature. &gt;&gt; How many want to be partakers of the divine nature? &gt;&gt; Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through the lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and brotherly kindness charity. For these things be in you and abound. They make you that you should ne neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lackth these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. For if you do these things, ye shall never fall. &gt;&gt; How many wants that assurance this evening that you will never fall? &gt;&gt; You can be seated this evening. I certainly want that security. And it says here that these things you do and abound to make your calling and election sure. That if you do these things, you shall never fall. And I just don't want to be an unfruitful Christian. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be 30fold or 60fold, but I want to be a hundfold Christian and I want these things and and I want uh to be a partaker of the divine nature of God. And the last time we spoke there on the inward law of God and I kind of want to go in that direction that we took from Romans 7. And Paul says that when I try to do good, evil is present with me that there's a war happening between my members and and a war happening within my mind. And he says that I find pleasure and I delight after the law after the inward man which is the law of God. And to use two quotes just to bring us up to speed in the restoration of the bride tree. He says God has set all his laws to serve him both natural and spiritual working according to his word regardless of the condition. He says I have a scripture on that. Yes. God sets all his laws into motion. God set all his laws into motion that it must work according to his own word. His word. His laws has to work according to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He commanded the sun. He commanded the moon. He commanded the earth. He commanded nature. And they fell all right in line. And all these laws work in harmony with God's spoken word. So we know that whenever he spoke in the beginning, he put these things in order. That he would set the moon in place and he would set the stars up there and that he would put laws within them that from that time he wouldn't have to change those laws. that they were set there forever. And those laws were put in place and they work in harmony according to his spoken word. And the laws of life that's in us will bring us to a resurrection. It's got to. It's impossible for it not to. Why is it impossible? Because if you are a part of his word, then you yourself are going to work in harmony to God's word. &gt;&gt; There is a harmony that comes with living a Christian life. that whenever it's not just coming to church and reading your Bible and doing trying to be a good Christian, but there is a harmony that that should pro protrude within your life. That there should be harmony between your family. There should be a harmony between you and your marriage. And there should be a harmony in the way that you live a good Christian life. &gt;&gt; These laws have to work in harmony. How much more should our daily lives work in harmony to God's word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the fundamental foundation for faith, he says, "And if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man, how much more ought God with his power make his laws work in man?" &gt;&gt; If Satan can make his laws be sure in us recognize it, how much more ought God through his children? &gt;&gt; Amen. So God is going to use his children &gt;&gt; to make his laws known &gt;&gt; that you can see that he put his laws up in the stars and he he created the universe and he put laws within those things. But those things don't have a soul. You and I have a soul. And our law the these laws that God wants to express through you and I in this portion he wants to express through his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. and to make his laws be recognized amongst his people of divine healing and revelation and power and gifts and manifestations of the spirit. So you see that these laws were put in place and brother Brandham would tell us many times that you can read in your Bible and you can see that the moon is the he would type it to the bride and how the sun is the type of Christ and you can see all these types and shadows &gt;&gt; but yet there's laws that within us that the moon can't express. There's laws within us that he has to express through you and I. &gt;&gt; That the stars can't express healing. The moon can't express the love of God. The the all the these things of the universe, they they they can't express these attributes that God wants to express. So, he has to use his children. You and I as human vessels will be used to express these laws of joy and peace and revelation and understanding. But yet, God's going to send us through trials and things to begin to express those attributes. without you going through a sickness. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that the earth is groaning for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this e evening if I can talk on the mysterious law of love for for a subject of I will heal your backslidings. I will heal your backslidings. And it was just something that in study it just ended up in this direction. And I hope that I can tie it together. And Webster says the mysterious means to relating to or tooting a mystery. And he put this here, the mysterious ways of God. That according to everybody else, there's a God is a mystery. That there's things that he doesn't show to everybody. that there's ways that God does things and there's a mystery to it. Mystery is an exciting wonder or curiosity or surprise while baffling efforts to comprehend or identify. Mysterious means something is strange or unknown, not easily understood or explained, which can cause a curiosity, a wonder or an awe. So putting this together of having a mysterious law of love that sometimes we can't explain the law the love of God. Sometimes we can't explain the way that the reason or how why we love the things that we do. Just as human beings within this building we all love different things. We all are attracted to a different person. That I married my wife because I I fell in love with her. that there was attributes within her and things that I loved about her, &gt;&gt; but I wouldn't love another woman. &gt;&gt; And each one of us has a choice that we can fall in love. And I trust that you marry the right person over love. &gt;&gt; Not over money, &gt;&gt; not because he smells good, not because his feet are small. But because of love, &gt;&gt; love can be a mystery. When you fall in love with somebody, some people might ask, "Now, what does she find in him?" &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. You don't understand it, but they're in love. You might not put a couple together, but they fell in love. Why do we love the way that we do? Why don't we all love the same things? the mysterious side of love that you can't explain it. It's hard to comprehend. You sit and wonder. And I, for myself, it's no different with Christ than I. Sometimes I wonder that out of 8.2 billion people on planet Earth, why did God choose me to love? Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of all my faults and all my failures and all my mistakes and the things that I do, why did God love me? &gt;&gt; Why does he love you? You see the love that God has for his bride or his church. He just doesn't love everybody. &gt;&gt; He's not attracted to everybody. &gt;&gt; He's not attracted to every church. He doesn't go to I if if it was based on upon the beauty of a church. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The Catholics would have us beat. &gt;&gt; If it was about a big denominational church, we would definitely be beat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because God doesn't love everybody. But God loves people that love him and love him according to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. He's calling a people from every kindred, tongue, and nation. So it's not based upon the church, but he falls in love with an individual. He falls in love with you as a individual. that the more I travel and you can go to different places that it's it doesn't matter the amount of people &gt;&gt; that God is still the same and he comes in a such a sweet and sovereign way whether you have five people whether you have 25 people whether you have 200 people or a thousand people &gt;&gt; God comes to the people he loves &gt;&gt; and he has fellowship &gt;&gt; and from the very beginning of time God always wanted fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but it's a mystery to me why God chose to love me. Sometimes I don't understand it. I can't explain it. But one thing I do know, I'm glad that he does. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And I know one thing that I love him and he loves me &gt;&gt; and that's all that really matters &gt;&gt; is that whenever you fall in love one time that he will supply every need that you have, every desire that you have, every question that there is. God will supply every single one of those. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 3:16 says, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son." What did that love cost him? It cost him a sacrifice. That this love came at a sacrifice. And Ephesians 5 and 25 says, "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it." See, he's requiring you husbands to have the same kind of love. A love that comes at a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Not a selfish love, &gt;&gt; but a love that comes at a sacrifice. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the sad part of it is is many of us are s doing uh have s are sacrificing over a lot less that we're willing to sacrifice our marriages. We sacrifice our children over the love of money, over the desires of a career. and you go out and you do these things and we must do those to live, but you sacrifice and you give up. Why? Because of a love for something. The love of entertainment and sports. You can't expect your kids to fall in love with Christ if you're not in love yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, if you don't sacrifice for the right things, you will begin to lose things. But it's also true, if you sacrifice for the right things, God will bless you. &gt;&gt; If you want to be blessed in your marriage, sacrifice some time. Go spend it with your wife. Show her how much you appreciate her. Show her how much you love her. Sacrifice some time and spend it with the boys. Spend it with your children. Why? Because it's a law of God. He says in divine love, he says there's two kinds of love. There is a love which which is called human love or in the Greek word is called filio love. And in the divine love is agapo love. Agapo love is divine love. And when divine love is in your heart, there's a difference in your life. And everybody knows it. That's right. You live like a Christian. You act like a Christian. You walk like a Christian. Your whole system is timed to God's Bible. &gt;&gt; Your whole system is timed to God's Bible. Why? Because you're in harmony with God's word. And when you're in harmony with God's word, that is the way and the beauty of it. That your whole system, your world and everything that you do is timed according to God's Bible. &gt;&gt; Why? Because all these laws have to work in harmony to God's word. Hear him. He says, "Men and women, hear me today as your brother. Let all your isms and your little sensations drop. Find the love of God. I'd rather have his love than every gift he's got in the kingdom to give me love. Give me his love. And that's what the world is looking for today is to see a display of real love. It'll win souls when you got love. &gt;&gt; They can tell when you've got it. Got love. He says, "We've got too much makebelieve love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got too much love of filio love. Trying to make it agapo love. Let me tell you, you can't make filio love of agapo love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need real godly love. &gt;&gt; You see, Satan can impersonate a lot of things. He can impersonate a lot of loves and he can do a lot of things, but there's one thing he can't do is that is an impersonate and agile love. The real genuine love of God. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not in him. And we can take the laws of God and go in so many different directions. And I want to focus here as we read on the stature of a perfect man in the divine nature. And when you come to the seventh, it is brotherly kindness. And we know that the capstone is love. There is a myri mysterious side of love that you can't explain. Yet the more that I read the scripture and and I begin to just go through the New Testament and I and I didn't search them out and so I probably missed them. But you begin to just pick up your Bible and and most of them I highlighted them already and you begin to talk about and you begin to read the love of God and the love your neighbor as thyself &gt;&gt; and how important it is to have brotherly love. And yet the more that I read, it's not just a suggestion that you must have &gt;&gt; but it is an absolute must. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To have brotherly love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the closer you get to perfection, the more love that we ought to be portraying in our Christian walk. that God loves in such a way that in turn we should also love our brothers &gt;&gt; and love our neighbors as thyself. &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says in divine love and sovereign grace. This is 1956. He says, "Now we face in the day that when it is prophesied to us that brotherly love would become a strange thing among people." 19 and 56. What is that? 70 years. 60 years. 70. Where would be brotherly love be now? A strange thing among people. And it is to my humble belief. He says, humble belief. Now, we're entitled to our own humble beliefs and our own humble opinions. But let me tell you, I'm going to take the prophet's humble belief. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. He says that it's the greatest of all the gifts that there is in God's Bible. If the Lord Jesus should stand on the platform tonight and look at me in the face and say, "I'm going to give you your choice. You can be a great person, a great minister, and I'll give you a gift of preaching the gospel, and I'll give you the gift of teaching the word, and I'll give you the gift of divine healing. I'll give you the gift of prophecy, and I'll I'll make you a prophet." And any of these fine gifts of faith, any of these gifts that's in the Bible, I'll give them every one to you. And then I will withhold love from you. Or either I'll give you love and withhold all the gifts from you. I'd say, Lord, take all the gifts and let me have love. &gt;&gt; For no matter how many gifts we've got, they've ne never will do any do us any good except the love of God is in the motion behind the gift. We must have love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, gifts don't save anybody. &gt;&gt; Healing doesn't save anybody. That if the prophet himself can come and hold meetings and have revivals and and heal thousands of people and people come through a prayer line, nobody just got saved from that. &gt;&gt; It didn't hold everybody. &gt;&gt; But yet, there's a power behind love. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there's such an importance of love in our lives that we can preach all the sermons and we can do all the things and you say, "Well, I don't preach." Well, that well, you live a good Christian life and you try to live godly, but if you have not love &gt;&gt; Matthew 22 and 36 says, "Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?" And Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. And these two commandments hang all the law. that you also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples. By what? By the love that you have one for another. &gt;&gt; That you are my disciples. If you live and how you know coming and being a friend of the pastor and doing all the things that you can though those are good. It's not just on quoting scripture. It's not just on quoting quotes though that's good. But let me tell you, Satan knows scripture &gt;&gt; and Satan knows quotes and Satan comes to church. &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that he can't do and have this kind of love. So based upon this portion of scripture we read disciplehip disciplehip for God is based on your love for your brother. And one more scripture here, James 2 and8. And it says, "If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well. But if you have respects a person and you commit sin or convict convinced of the law as a transgressor, for whosoever shall keep the whole law yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. &gt;&gt; And as I begin to look into this portion of scripture, why is it called the royal law of God? Why is it the royal law? Because royal has something to do with it. It's only used one time in the scripture, the royal law. And when you begin to use the word loyal, royal in the Bible, it is used to describe things that belong to a king or a kingly power. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. It is something that belongs to a king or a kingly power. So when the Bible says it is the royal law, who is it pertaining to? that not everybody can love &gt;&gt; and have this kind of love. &gt;&gt; Because in order to be royal, it m you must come from a lineage. You must come from a bloodline. &gt;&gt; You must be a part of something. You can either be married into it or born into it. But not everybody is a part of royalty. that royal has king characteristics. It comes with a supreme authority that in order to fulfill the royal law you must be a part of the royal family. &gt;&gt; Not anyone can fulfill this scripture because it comes with the divine nature. And without Christ, there's no way for you and I to have this kind of love. You cannot have this kind of love one for another without Christ. &gt;&gt; You can have love for other people but as the scripture says here but to love them as yourself. Love somebody else as yourself. How many loves their neighbor naturally? It's impossible. It's hard to understand that you can have a love for somebody else that you don't even know or it's a neighbor or a brother or somebody in the church, but you have an affinity with them. You have a love for them. It's against all human reasoning and ability. But let me say this evening, since you are a part of God and the royal seed of Abraham, you are able to have this kind of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not only have this kind of love that it may abound in your life, but it is required of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have this ability within you to express this kind of love. Brother Brandham says in questions and answers, he says, "Always remember, you're God's children. You're from a royal family. You're a royal blood. There's no better blood in the world than yours." That's right. A royal blood shows itself. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's royal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, in the the greatest battle ever fought, he says, "And the royal seed of Jesus or of Christ is a Holy Ghost filled church &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost." What? The royal seed. By promise, not by sensation, but by the promise of God. &gt;&gt; They stand by the word of God and they chop their way through screaming, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Somebody say hallelujah this evening. &gt;&gt; That you chop your way. that no matter what you're going through, you stand upon the basis of his word and you keep chopping. No matter trial that comes up, you just keep chopping. Whatever sickness that has come upon you, you just keep chopping &gt;&gt; stand upon the basis of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's not of our own ability. It's not of our own choosing. You didn't choose this royal. &gt;&gt; You didn't choose to be a part of the royal family. But it is by predestination that God for ordained predestinated you to be a part of his family. &gt;&gt; That it's nothing within ourselves, not of our own desires. If we had our own desires, we'd be doing something else tonight. &gt;&gt; If we were living according to the flesh, some of us would be too tired or we'd have money to make or we'd have things to do. But that's not who we are. There's something that is running through our veins that we have a desire to come to the house of God and say, "God, I am here. I am a part of your family and I'm going to sit around your dinner table this evening &gt;&gt; that you would come and you would speak to my life &gt;&gt; that you would help me to have this kind of love. We can remember that there's only two bloodlines from the beginning that started in creation there. And I can take us back to Genesis 4. And you can see the two that would come together. And in Genesis 4 is where the first fruits of the the the fall would come. You would have Cain and you would have Abel. And you would see the very sin that it caused there in Genesis. That what was the first death? What was the first killing? It was of a brother. One to another. Those are the fruits of the fallen seed. &gt;&gt; So I wonder, and it's not a place to give our own opinion, but my humble opinion, why that God put such a great emphasis. Whenever you read your New Testament on having brotherly love, because if that produced a killing, how much is God going to have to require of his first fruits? What are the attributes that are going to be birthed through this first through his lineage through his bloodline? &gt;&gt; That if one is willing to slay his brother over jealousy and all of that, how much more is God &gt;&gt; going to require of us brotherly love? Because when we read in the New Testament &gt;&gt; that your love for your brother identifies &gt;&gt; what seed you come from. &gt;&gt; Your love for your brother identifies what bloodline you're from. As I said, because Satan can impersonate a lot of things, &gt;&gt; but he can't impersonate the agile love of God. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have that law within him. &gt;&gt; Remember the royal law. &gt;&gt; How do you be be are you able to love your neighbor as yourself and portray that love one for another? Satan doesn't have that law within him. &gt;&gt; And we can see it all down through scripture. The conflict of brothers, both natural and in the flesh. You can take Cain and Abel or Jacob and Esau. The battle of two brothers, Judas and Jesus. He said, "You're your father, the devil. And the Bible gives us a story of Joseph and his brothers and how that it gives us an example of how we should have brotherly love one for another &gt;&gt; because we we know that Joseph was sent and he would have dreams and he would become spiritual and he would begin to tell his dreams and share with his brothers and and his brothers would hate him for it and with the they would sell him off into slavery and they would throw him in a ditch and tell him his father that he was dead and he would go off into slavery and it was brother Brandham says it's a perfect type of Christ how that his brothers would portray him or uh betray him that I can imagine Humanly, Joseph was hurt. He was bitter. &gt;&gt; He was broken. &gt;&gt; He was betrayed. He was left alone. &gt;&gt; Sold into slavery, not knowing what would lay ahead. &gt;&gt; All because of his brothers. But yet within this story, there would come a time that Joseph would have to in the time of judgment that his brothers would come to him and bow down before him and they would fulfill the dreams that he had. And there was coming a time that as they laid stood bowed down before him, he stood. He had a choice within the power that he had to choose grace or judgment. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a choice to look him in the eye and either choose grace or love &gt;&gt; or love or judgment. And when you put yourself in his shoes, it's easy to say. But can you imagine after all those years and all those beatings and all those nights left alone, not knowing why this purpose was to be fulfilled? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you think Joseph was hurting his spirit? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That he looked his brother in the eye. How could you do that? &gt;&gt; How could you treat me? I'm apart. We're brothers. But yet there came a time that Joseph when he looked at his brothers, he set aside all the hurt, all the pain, &gt;&gt; and he said, "They're my brothers." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their blood is the same as my blood. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Their father is the same as my father. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What grace he must have had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To be able to put all that aside. I'm going somewhere because I want you to understand that maybe there are some sitting in this congregation that have been hurt, that have been bruised, that have been uh back bitten, that been all these things by their brother, &gt;&gt; but there's going to come a time. &gt;&gt; What kind of love are you going to portray? &gt;&gt; What kind of grace are you going to show? It's a mysterious part of love. &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we go through a trial. Maybe some will go down. It'll be down the road. And you have to remember that when a brother maybe hurts you, he offends you, he does something to you, &gt;&gt; you all have to remember what law of love are you going to show. &gt;&gt; You see, because this expression of love, it can be uncomfortable showing grace. Sometimes when they don't deserve it is a hard thing. &gt;&gt; Showing love when somebody's really offended you is it's a tough thing to be the bigger person and go up to somebody and say, "I'm sorry." It's a hard thing. &gt;&gt; Or am I the only one? &gt;&gt; We're all humans. &gt;&gt; We all know what I'm talking about. We also know the story of the prodal that the love that was shown that many times when a prodal comes home the father he celebrates here and he kills the fatted calf and he gives him the code and he he he gives him the ring and he does all this, but yet there's one that's sitting who's hurt, who's bittered, why why does the older brother, wouldn't you think that if we see somebody, they go out and they they they waste all that they had, all of their inheritance, they gave it away and then they come back to church and some sit as the older other &gt;&gt; bitter hard why with the father when the son comes home. &gt;&gt; But you see there's things in our flesh that we don't understand &gt;&gt; that how could God do something like that? Maybe he sends a mother away and she begins to backslide. And maybe it's a father or maybe it's a son or somebody that you love dearly. The thing about a prodal when they go out in the world, what happens? It is somebody that is so dear to you or close to you or been to our church and amongst our ranks. It's somebody personal, somebody that you've shared memories with and treasured times with and done all these things and they go out and then they come back. And yet we are the ones that are left bitter, &gt;&gt; broken, &gt;&gt; bruised. Well, how can they go out and do all these things and live the way they want and they can enjoy life and do all those and then I'm here faithful and I I never left you, Lord. and they come back. And it's hard for some to show love, to show grace. It's a love that we can't understand sometimes. &gt;&gt; The love of a father. Why does God do the things that he does? Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Why does he send us through the trials that we go through? You see the wounds of a backslider, yet they're guilty. But they come back and they come amongst our ranks and it's hard. But yet maybe God is going to use your love to bring their healing. It's going to test your real brotherly love &gt;&gt; because this kind of love is not when it's deserved. &gt;&gt; It's not when it's easy. You can love somebody whenever they're a friend to you or you know your your your friends and it's easy to have that kind of love to say I'm a Christian and I love this brother and I love brother Jim. You know you have all these Yeah. We have a love one for another but what happens when that person hurts you? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What happens when that person says something against you and you begin to avoid them throughout the church? Then if they're coming your way, you go the other. It's time to face it, saints, &gt;&gt; to love the unlovable. &gt;&gt; Yet, if you begin to look at this, it's no different than Christ and you and I. &gt;&gt; That how could love God love us? That while we were yet sinners, he died for us. that he did all these things for you and I, but yet we didn't always love him. That we are out there doing our own thing in a backslid condition, living any kind of life. Yet he's seen a seed. He knew that you were a part of him and he knew that you would come unto him, but he didn't wait for you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But he went on with a plan of redemption, knowing that in your time and whenever he had an appointment with you, God always meets his appointment. that you would recognize his love &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you have your Bibles, I want to go to Jeremiah 3. I'm gonna have to hurry here because Israel, we know, is God's people and he delivers them time and time again. and he would he he they fall in love with him. They serve him. Then they go into a a condition that God doesn't want to be associated with. And then he delivers them again and he he does all these things and he delivers them from the hand of Pharaoh and they fall in love and they worship him. But then as time goes on, they begin to have other gods and other things that they begin to worship, other idols that they put in the place of God. And here in this chapter he says there in verse one he says they say if a man put away his wife and she should go from him and become another man shall she return again and shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers yet you return unto me saith the Lord. He says, "Wherefore the showers have been withholden, and there have been no latter rain, and thou hast a forehead, and thou refuses to be ashamed." Listen to the condition that Israel got themselves in that they began to not receive the blessings of the of the Lord. And they were living in a dry and desert place. They're living under a condition that they weren't even ashamed of the way that they were living. knowing the truth but yet not doing and falling in love with Christ. And it's by their own choice. Listen, it's by your own choice sometimes that you begin to get backsliden &gt;&gt; that you make choices that you know when we talk about the backslider, you can think about ones that have left the message, but what about ones that are sitting here tonight or just listening on the internet that aren't living according to God's word? Because if you're not moving forward, you're living in a backstate condition. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, "Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? She has gone up unto every high mountain, and unto every tree, and there hath played the harlot, and I had said after her, she had done all these things. Turn thou unto me," but she turned not. and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. And I saw when all the law for all the causes which whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery, and I put her away, and giving her a bill of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, and went and played the harlot also. So we see this bill of divorce, it's part of the Mosaic law that he was given. And if you go back in Deuteronomy 24 and1, he begins to talk about how that a husband, you know, if he finds his wife unclean and he puts her away and he sends her out with a bill of divorce and the second husband would come and and find her unclean that he he would give her a divor a bill of divorce or that he would die. The law is here in verse four, he says, "For her former husband, which hath sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife after she is defiled. For that is an abomination before the Lord, that thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance." So, we know that God puts all his laws into motion. And we can pick this up in in Mark 10 and verse 4. And Jesus is talking to the Pharisees because the Pharisees had asked, "What should we do with a husband and a wife that he wants to put her away?" And he says, "And Moses and Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and put her away. And Jesus answered and said unto him, for the hardness of your heart, he wrote this precept. But from the beginning of creation of God, made them male and female. And for this cause a man should leave his father and mother mother and clean unto his wife and they twain shall be one flesh. And so then they shall no more be twain but one flesh. What therefore God had joined together. Let no man put us under. So you see the condition that Israel was in that they got to such a place that God had the right to put him away in a bill of divorcement. That there was this this law that was put in place. But let me tell you something that that wasn't the way that God always wanted it. &gt;&gt; He said because of the condition that you were in is why Moses wrote that law. &gt;&gt; But he said it wasn't so from the beginning. &gt;&gt; He said is it it is until death do us part. That's what the love of God toward us and toward his children. It's until death do us part. That he has a covenant of love with each one of us. that it's not in a condition that we find ourselves in. That sometimes we fall away and we make mistakes and we do these things, but there's a love, there's a ring that God has put on our fingermen &gt;&gt; that we didn't deserve it. We didn't earn it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's because he loves us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And yet we see that Israel gets in a backsliden condition. They begin to make idols and put their worship toward other gods and God would save them many times and God would speak to them and they would change their lives and it became a cycle of Israel. And yet, if we're not careful, that's what happens with you and I. &gt;&gt; That God is in so in love with you that he speaks to you on a Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; And you fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; And then you go out in the world and you have fellowship with friends and you begin to get on your phones and you begin to do different things, but yet he still loves you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you come back on a Sunday and he begins to talk to you and he begins to love all over you and say, "I love you." And you fall in love all over again. And what happens? The busyiness of life. &gt;&gt; But yet God tonight has a law and a covenant of love which he cannot break. the message of grace. He says sovereign grace can only be given by one that's sovereign &gt;&gt; and God is sovereign. So he can give sovereign grace. &gt;&gt; Therefore being sovereign grace don't have to ask anybody. &gt;&gt; It don't have to. &gt;&gt; It does what it wants to. It's so wonderful. It doesn't have to ask can I do this or shall I do that or can I must I will I doesn't do it. &gt;&gt; It does it itself. &gt;&gt; Grace is sovereign. He says therefore he can save the vilest. &gt;&gt; He can save the worst. He can save the impurest. He can save the immoralist. He can heal the sick. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can do anything. God can do the impossible. Many times we get so bound by putting God in a box that that's a that's a case too far gone. That person's too far lost. They're too impure. They've gone too far. Nobody's gone too far tonight. &gt;&gt; I know I'm preaching one side of it, but let me &gt;&gt; God can do the impossible. &gt;&gt; Think of it. Grace and love and grace is sisters. Twin sisters. You can't have grace without having love. Twin sisters. Exactly right. Before you can have grace, you have to have love. Before you can actually show somebody a favor, you have to love them. &gt;&gt; Right or wrong, you have to love them anyhow. So love and grace is the same thing. &gt;&gt; What a profound statement. that you can't do one without the other. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham was talking and I heard it the other day. He was talking about the man that would come up and he wanted to beat his brains out. And he says, you know, I actually felt sorry for that man because he didn't want to be in that condition. You know, many times people get into a condition they don't want to be in. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; They don't want to be in that condition. They don't want to have those characteristics. Maybe somebody offended you. Maybe somebody said something to you, did you wrong, but maybe it's not in their nature. Or maybe their nature's a different way. And but they don't want to be that way. Or maybe God caused it to see your reaction. because he wants to produce something. &gt;&gt; And the only way that's going to happen is through trials and tests. And Israel got into a place in verse 12, he says, "Go and proclaim the words toward the toward the north and say, Return, thou backslidsing Israel, sayaeth the Lord, and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you. For I am merciful, sayaeth the Lord. I will keep I will not keep my anger forever. Only acknowledge." Listen, if you ever get in this condition or if you ever get in this state, only acknowledge thine iniquities that thou hast transgressed against the Lord and has scattered their ways to the stranger under every green tree. And ye have not obeyed my voice, and ye have not obeyed my voice, sayaeth the Lord. Turn, oh backsliding children, sayaeth the Lord, for I am married unto you, &gt;&gt; and I will take you one of a city, two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion. You see, it's not a group of it's not a group affair. It's an individual walk with Jesus Christ. You can't just come to church and and serve God because your parents come to this church. It's got to be a very personal walk with Jesus Christ because in verse 15 he says and I will give you pastors according to my own heart which shall feed you &gt;&gt; with knowledge and understanding. &gt;&gt; He didn't say I'll give you a prophet that it'll be good &gt;&gt; but he says I will give you pastors and with pastors comes preaching. &gt;&gt; That's why we need the preaching of the word. And I will give you pastors to give you understanding. That's why it's important to know your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To know why you go to the church that you go to. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That you can go to many message churches and I'm sure you can get by, but God has to reveal unto you a pastor. &gt;&gt; That's right. that whenever you're called to a posted duty, you know where you go to church. &gt;&gt; That it's not this Sunday you go over there and that Sunday you go over here and you might play a tape cuz it's convenient. &gt;&gt; No, but it's a revelation to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That you have a post of duty at that church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. that you stay at home on a Wednesday to stream this brother and then you come on Sunday because the pastor's preaching or you do all these things. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; You see, there's many churches all around the world, but God reveals unto you who your pastor is. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Why do you go to this church? &gt;&gt; Is it because your family comes here? Because when your family leaves, you'll leave. &gt;&gt; When somebody falls away, well, there's nothing to this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It's not a personal revelation. Jeremiah 3:22 says, "Return ye backsliden children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art our God, the Lord our God." You see, the Lord has mercy and he shows grace and he shows favor upon his children. That is still alive and well today. that maybe you're here tonight and you're in a certain condition or maybe you're streaming and you're not where you should be. Only acknowledge thine iniquities that thou has transgressed against the Lord. That his love for you has never changed. And if his love for you has not changed, then our love for you has not changed. You see, the truth of brotherly love toward a backslider, as I said, is so personal because they were a part of us or you know that they know better. We all know somebody that's struggling, maybe walked away from the Lord, maybe aren't serving them like we they should. We all know somebody. We all have a family member. We all know somebody that is dear to our heart. &gt;&gt; And my pull for tonight is that you would lift them up in your prayers. &gt;&gt; That you would reach out to them in brotherly love and ask them how they're doing. Because many times they walk away or they're they're questioning certain things and they begin to get shunned and there's no more talking and there's no nothing to them and it's so hard sometimes. But yet if they're his will come back to the sheepfold. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother James, are all them that walk away from the message his seed?" No, I'm not. But who am I to judge? Or how do we know who's gone too far or who who's not his seed and who's not his? &gt;&gt; I say, God, help us &gt;&gt; to portray the love of God that people around us begin to identify. There's something different about that person. &gt;&gt; That you can walk through an airport and people compliment you on your family and say, "You have a lovely family." Why? because they're identifying a bond, a love between a family. They're identifying a harmony that's living out &gt;&gt; God may use your love to bring their healing. Your love You see, Joseph had come to a place that he realized, forget about the past. God hath done this for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Why? to preserve life. &gt;&gt; That we have some that walk away or maybe some that are struggling. We don't understand it all. But yet God has a purpose in it. &gt;&gt; God is trying to bring an attribute of love not only from their life but from your life. &gt;&gt; Musicians come first John and 4 and 16 it says we have known and believe that the love of God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have the boldness in the day of judgment here is when our love is made perfect that in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world Joseph, are you listening tonight? &gt;&gt; That in the day of judgment that it becomes to your decision. What are you going to choose? &gt;&gt; There is no fear in love, but perfect love cast out all fear &gt;&gt; because fear hath torment. He that fearth is not made perfect in love, and we love him because he first loved us. And if a man say, "I love God," and hateth his brother, he is a liar. That's pretty hard. For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? &gt;&gt; And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God loveth his brother also. I say, "God, help me love my brother." &gt;&gt; He says, "We ought to honor one another, respect one another as brother and sister, and love one another with undying love." You say, "Well, I just can't." Well, just stay here a little little longer and then you will like people too. You'll love those who don't love you. That's a real good sign of Christianity is when you can from your heart love those that doesn't love you. &gt;&gt; Love the unlovable. I say God help us this evening to have the love of God in our lives that as we begin to build and we can live a a good Christian life and we're striving to come into the perfection yet the capstone is love. &gt;&gt; Yes. [Music] Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy boughs of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mine, meekness, longsuffering, forbearing one another, forgiving one another, and if any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do you. And above all these things, put on charity, which is the perfect the bond of perfectness. You want the bond of perfectness this evening, put on love. Love them that hate you. Love them that despise you. Love them that talk about you. &gt;&gt; It's a sobering thing. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a hard thing because sometimes it's unexplainable. You can't put into words sometimes the responsibility that we have to love our brothers. To love ones within the church. I say, "God, I don't want to be identified by any preaching or anything that I do on earth, but I want to be identified that he had the love one for another." &gt;&gt; That he would go out of his way to serve his brother. &gt;&gt; He would go out of his way to help his brother. &gt;&gt; That maybe there's one that's lost their way and they've they're struggling and they're having a hard time. That you would reach down a hand Because you see, there's ones that whenever you're hurt and you're bitter and you're broken, that's the evidence that things have happened to you. &gt;&gt; That if you have scars in your life, that is the evidence that something went wrong, something happened. And every time you see that, you can identify that scar with a hurt, with a wound. [Music] But yeah, may we come to a place in our lives that we can look past all that &gt;&gt; and we can have the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. [Music] He says, "Living and dying, buried and rising, coming." He says, "Dear God, I've tried to speak of a love that you gave to your church. It seems that they've caught they've caught up with the miracles of the Bible. They've caught up with the memberships and the evangelism and missionaries and but Lord, let them catch up with the love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That'll set the church on fire with a real gospel love, &gt;&gt; with a real sacred love that could turn the cheek. or the one that is willing to lay down his life. If it would mean to save another, God, give us that love in our hearts as we wait upon you. No greater love hath a man that he would lay down his life. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this gospel love says is a million miles different than a just a felio love. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says it'll make you love a man that would come and do something to your wife, hurt your children, and make you love him. Talk about real love. And I've seen it. There was a documentary on it that a man that this man he he had some children. They just went down the road just to go get some ice cream. And a man was driving his truck and he crashed into him and killed all three of them. And yet there came a healing only whenever he says, "I don't know what it is, but that man wasn't in his right mind. He wasn't in the condition he should have been. He had every right to hate that man. He took everything. He took all his kids from him. But he visited him in the jail cell. He says, "Sir, I'm a Christian and I love you and I forgive you." Could we say the same thing in our life? This isn't just some far out story, saints. This is everyday living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we get so flared up over somebody saying something, somebody doing us wrong, &gt;&gt; I say, God, help us love. [Music] &gt;&gt; The love of God is greater far. Let's sing that. &gt;&gt; The love of God is gater far than tongue or pen. You can't ever tell. It goes beyond the high star and reaches through the low. A guilty fair bow down with care. God gave his son to win his child. be reconciled and pardoned from his oh God. How rich and pure, how measureless [Music] and strong. It shall forever the saints and [Music] shy time shall pass away and earthly. And kingoms fall when men refuse to pray on rocks and hills and mountains called God's love so Sure. [Music] shall still endure all measureless and strong [Music] redeeming grace to Adam's praise the saint [Music] Love of God. &gt;&gt; Oh love of God. How rich and pure, how measureless and strong. It shall forever more endure the saints san. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads and our hearts together. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, the love of God, how rich and pure How marvelous, oh God, that we can't explain it with words. And words fail us sometimes. &gt;&gt; But Father, we're so thankful that you seen fit to love us. &gt;&gt; That you seen fit to call us, to call us your children. That before the foundation of the world, you elected us to be your royal seed. that there's a royal law that lays within your scripture that only your children can express. Why? Because it's an attribute of you. &gt;&gt; I say, Father, help us. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; That as we go from this service and [Music] Lord, may we show forth your love in such a way. Lord, &gt;&gt; may we love the unlovable. May we give grace to those Lord that are in need of some grace. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. how hard it is sometimes and our connality gets in the way that we want to live by the law and you got to do this and you got to serve God this way and you if you're not a part of this and if you're not doing these things how dare you but I say God give us love in our hearts &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and father as we go from this service May you go with your people, Lord. That we can come back on Sunday morning with an expectation in our heart with a desire that we want to hear from you. Lord, &gt;&gt; that we want to grow in the stature of a perfect man. That we want to begin to express all the attributes, all the laws that were within us. Oh God, &gt;&gt; we just say we love you and appreciate you. &gt;&gt; Be with us as we goless &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Brother sing could we within the ocean fill and were the skies a parchment made. For every sock on earth the quill and every man ascribe by trade to write the love of God above [Music] would drain the ocean and dry. Nor could the scroll contain the whole stretch from sky to sky. Oh love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong it shall forever more into the saints and a [Music] Let's just sing one more before we go. Seen that song, Amazing Love.
