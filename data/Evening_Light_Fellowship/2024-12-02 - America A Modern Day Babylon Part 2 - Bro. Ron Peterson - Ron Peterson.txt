amen I greet you all today in the lovely name of Jesus Christ I've had this thought in my heart now for some time about the handwriting on the wall and um uh it's a very serious serious matter probably more serious than you can imagine and um so anyway we'll continue on with this thought today and perhaps the next service that I take uh I don't mean to ever Bel labor a point but I want to get the point across and I believe that there are some things that the Lord wants to deal with your heart and show you this morning and uh so we happy to have everyone here I have my friend John hinga big tall guy there here for yeah there he is he's here with us we've known know John for quite some time he and his wife Louisa um and so it's just a blessing brother John to have you here with me Amen brother Jim duly God bless you buddy it's good to have you here with us Brother Mac amesa God bless you to have you here with us he came in the back room said I need some honey come here he say he says come here yeah he says I know you've been dipping into that honey bucket so the Lord bless you all amen turn with me if you would to Genesis 10 and then Revelation 17 Genesis chap 10 many are away traveling and I trust you all have had a nice time of Thanksgiving with your family and friends and you're all fed up like the turkey was and uh we trust that things are going well for you we know that all things work together for the good didn't say they would be good but they will work together for the good so we trust God in his plan in our lives the things we go through we know are for a purpose Trials come upon you to test you you say you believe your belief will be tested everything brother Bram said every chrisan will be tried on what they confess so um God help us then to be able to not only confess it but to possess it amen you say you believe the message that's good let me see you live it amen amen because no man can do that on his own takes the Holy Spirit to give you power to overcome the enemy Genesis chap 10 verses 8-10 and Kush begat Nimrod and he began to be a Mighty Man a mighty one on in the earth and he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said even as Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel everything has a beginning Genesis is the book of at beginning now brother Brenham said that watch you see what starts there in Genesis and goes all the way down through to the Book of Revelation so we see something began back then a kingdom a kingdom called Babylon and Babylon is not just a physical Kingdom but a spiritual entity and the Bible talks about mystery Babylon so I'd like to read that also Revelation chap 17 verses 1- six and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman sit on a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her head was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunken not with inspiration drunk with the blood of the Saints you want to know who she's after if you're a Christian if you're one of the sainted ones of God she would love to devour you and drink your blood and she is drunk the Bible says with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration heavenly father I pray a blessing upon Thy word I pray that you will Open the Eyes of our understanding Lord that we might know in this end time who is this mystery Babylon how far does it reach and make sure father that we have no part of matalon within us am we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen bless you you can be seated this morning in the presence of God as I read there in Genesis and we look at how something begins and brother Bram says when you take it back and he says you look at Kush who was begat who begat Nimrod but if you study it Kush is is The Descendant or the son of ham who is the son of Noah and brother random said we see the serpent the seed of the serpent came through ham I always can remember that because I have relational Association ham is a comes from a pig think on that can't change the ways of a pig a pig is a pig every seed will bring forth of its own kind amen so we see here something began back there in Genesis and the beginning the beginning didn't say the end of his kingdom the beginning of his kingdom was Babel so I'm titling my sermon this morning America a modern day Babylon this is part two and we are the subject of the handwriting on the wall now what is happening in America today is actually biblical prophecy we are found our country is found as a nation in Revelation chap 13 started out with two horns civil and ecclesiastical powers and looked like a lamb but turned out when it raises and grows up and matures it becomes a dragon and speaks like a dragon and makes war with those so don't think that America and I don't want all of you to say well praise God Trump is in the office now things are going to get better they ain't it's just going to I I I tell you I think what it is the only thing I can say that I'm happy about is the fact that at least it showed that there's enough people in America that don't want the other way of leadership and yet brother Bram said you can put an Abraham Lincoln in a George Washington in every office you'll not change America so America is on her way down she what you are witnessing are the death death throws H gasping like a drunk man that's reeling that he's walking and he's just about ready to fall and this nation of ours has sown her seed for so long and understand that God is Not mocked amen for whatsoever you sow that shall you reap for you if you sow to the flesh you shall of the flesh reap corruption but if you sow unto the spirit you shall of the spirit reap everlasting life Babylon did not cease with the Babylon of the time of Nebuchadnezzar it's a spirit and we can see the types and shadows within the scripture brother Brenham would go back and he says as it was in the days of Daniel as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Abraham or go on and he will show you so you can go back to those scriptures you can read and it'll show you what was going on in Babylon then gives you a picture of what will happen to the Babylon now so as it was so shall it be we see this is a time of political and governmental pressures put upon the people exactly as it was in the time of Daniel remember that Israel because of their Disobedience to God's word were taken captive by Babylon and they were put under political pressure govern mental pressures but there was one that refused to eat the food of the king he had spiritual food and he fared far better than those who ate of of the King's food who was that that was Daniel there were others that were influenced under Daniel's Ministry in fact there was a pressure watch this that Daniel after that he reads and gives the interpretation of the handwriting on the wall is lifted up but guess what when he's lifted up they wanted to worship Daniel and Shadrach meach and abedo the three Hebrew children the reason they went through a fiery trial was because they refused to bow to the image of Daniel and brother Bram said because watch the kingdom the Gentile Kingdom came came in with the word worship of a man it goes out with the worship of a man so we see these things spiritually their persecution LED them to the Lion's Den LED them to the fiery furnace but let me say this as a side note the Lion's Den and the fiery furnace was a trial that brought them to their Deliverance they had to go through it to experience to come out without the smell of smoke and you wonder why you're going through such fiery trials God knows exactly what he's doing let's quit worrying about well why am I in this why is this gone why why why stop and just say God it's all in your hands how many can quit asking why and just saying okay what do I need to do amen what do I need to do excuse me now brother Brenham said in the five definite identifications of the True Church of the Living God but as I travel around the world I find every nation has its own spirit and all nations are controlled by the devil somebody say all all yeah all the nations so yeah America so bad I'm going to go to the UK I'm going to go to Australia all nations are controlled by the devil all governments are ruled by the devil the Bible said so they fight they war and they will till Jesus comes then he'll set up a kingdom and there'll be no war but Satan said that all the kingdoms of the world was his and he do with them whatever he wanted to write in the face of Jesus Christ they're all Satan's instruments Satan's kingdom so I want you to all understand that the whole system around the world and all governments in all countries are influenced of the wicked one it's coming to a head brother Brandon with the opening of The Seven Seals he said watch that seven seal has to do with his coming right and he says it's the end of all things it's the end of of this world it's the end of the political system it's the end it's the end of all things thank God we're coming to the end of all of these issues because there is another kingdom coming in can you say Amen to that a whole another kingdom that's being ushered in right now how long does that ushering take it's just depends on the wedding ceremony some weddings that bride is ushered in you know you have the music and and then somebody stands up they all stand and they look and then slowly she's being ushered in and slowly she comes down the aisle how long does that take depends on the wedding ceremony some of them like brother Ron cut to the chase buddy we want to just come in say I do you may kiss the bride that's it we're happy but this ushering in is happening right now there's an ushering in of a whole another kingdom and we see these two kingdoms are in conflict because you have the kingdom of God and the kingdom of this world and they are totally opposite of one another and if you feel comfortable in this Kingdom I doubt you belong to God's kingdom because Jesus said those that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution amen greatest battle ever fought brother Braham says rulers of Darkness who rules the world the devil certainly who is all these things coming on all these ungodly things going on around uh uh through here and these governments and so forth It's all the devil the Bible said so the devil controls the United States yeah the devil controls Germany and the devil controls every nation in the world I'm coming to it in just a few minutes we'll find out whether he does or not every Kingdom there ever was and ever will be until God sets up his kingdom is controlled by the devil I don't mean everybody in it is the devil now there's Godly men in government offices but there are few and far between amen God's seat is always minority understanding do you know that President Obama was the first president of the United States it says America is no longer a Christian Nation he declared it he said we are a secular Nation we're a mixture he himself he's not black nor white he claims to be black since whenn do you have when you have a white mother and a black father that makes you black you may have negroid features but you go over into Africa into certain tribes they would never say he's negro because or it's just we're we're in a mixed time a mixing of a white horse rider and a black horse rider brings forth appeal do you understand it's mixing of Creeds it's a mixing of doctrines it's a mixing of seed you know I don't know if you've saw in the news but Camala Harris has no negro ancestry in her if any of you have seen that and they say well this is going to be the first black president are you kidding me it was a falsehood it's it's being proven she has no negro blood within her in fact when she and I'm not trying to make anything political but it was just a falsehood to pretend she's something to get their vote because when she started into her governmental uh whatever governor and all that kind of stuff she was Asian of Indian descent so well which one of you well I want you to understand today well I don't feel like being white so I think I'll be black I don't feel like being black so I'll be Asian I don't feel like being a man so I'll be a woman you can be whatever you want to be you just it's whatever you identify with and I don't mean to make that a joke because it's a reality we live around I was over in Australia landed in Australia it was just going to another uh uh making you know a connection and they got two lines and I always look I'm at the gate and I'm always going to choose the shorter line try to go you know but Murphy's Law always seems to come up and I'm in the L line and I'm just you know somebody Taps me on the shoulder uh excuse me yes yes I think you're in the wrong line well I look around and this is all women and over here is all men and so I said well today I think I'll be a woman this was years ago and everybody went like that I said no really as I'll go over there and get with the men America was founded upon Christian principles the Constitution was forged in the fiery trial of government tyranny to Rise Up from the United Kingdom and government tyranny and declare ourselves as a Sovereign Nation they had a Boston Tea Party because of taxation without representation my do you understand how the God was mentioned in our constitution in our laws in our bylaws it was in our Halls of Justice when people came and went into a courtroom put your hand on the Bible do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth so help you God there was a fear of God God was on our money God was I pledge allegiance to the flag now nowadays they pledge nothing I pledge to fight everything and go against everything that you ever stand for Kneel for God and stand for the flag this is a nation I believe that we I am a patriot but I put God first amen I'm not on a political platform this morning and I don't want anybody to think that but we're in the time that Babylon is right here and in every classroom they used to say the pledge allegiance our our forefathers fought to gain religious and political Freedom one nation under God indivisible they gave their lives for it America today is in the midst of a religious persecution a battle for your god-given rights anti-semite semitism is now reaching an all-time high since the times of the second World War and people are standing and watching Jews getting beaten just because they're Jews Christians are not allowed to pray in schools teachers and coaches are not allowed to pray with their classrooms or with the team before or after a game not allowed to to pray in our governmental buildings but you know what's an amazing thing let something happen that is a of some sort of catastrophic event and everybody says oh let's pray you better start praying now Satan has polluted our schools our families our churches he's invaded our pulpits invaded our government doing everything he can right now to invade the message and the ministry somebody has been sending me little clips of things about the message that have been recently here in our local paper here in Arizona these are just flashing red lights realize something's coming the government's looking at you politics are looking at you you people are weird you're Fanatics there's something wrong with you you believe in some kind of a prophet yes we do America now has become another modern day Babylon our governments corrupt our schools have become corrupt and he's doing everything he can to corrupt our churches thank God that he sent a prophet in this end time that we might know what's going on thank God for this prophetic Ministry amen thank God for it otherwise you'd be swallowed right up into this movement that you know God loves everybody doesn't matter how you live doesn't matter how you dress then why does God put it in his word am in the sermon contending for the faith he says there's a phenomena of this way of the holy spirit moves and the meetings that's been very strange to the American people because that there's such a mixup among the American people so many different denominations with so many different phases of which of which way they believe and they become so indoc so indument there that's a word brother brenon made up he means indoctrinated but talk about a people that's all messed up that doesn't know what they believe in the sermon that called out last evening it was laid upon my heart to speak on the subject the handwriting on the wall and the Lord did bless us and not only did he bless us but he furthered his kingdom by letting us read his word and to let the Holy Spirit reveal to us the things that's so close at hand and in doing so we type the great modern Babylon with the great modern America and we found out that in this nation of ours today we found ourselves in the same kind of a fix they were in when they had the handwriting on the wall and we also found out that we had uh and the same conditions morally speaking so he's looking into Ty of what it was then to what it is now yeah I want you to understand Daniel with his prophetic Vision could see the handwriting on the wall nobody else could understand it it was unknown tongues it was God's hand that came down that wrote on the wall and nobody understood it and Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon was scared and he brought all his souss and brought him all together what does this mean brother Brenham says that's what's happening in America today I see the same signs and I'm here to tell you I'm reading the handwriting that's on the wall in America you're ready for Destruction there is only one major difference between us and denominational Christianity and that is the lack of the revelation of the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit cannot deny God's word because the holy spirit is the author of the word so brother Brenham gives us time after time if you say you have the Holy Spirit and you're a woman and you say I feel no conviction about cutting my hair he said it's not the Holy Spirit you have you have of a religious you understand religious spirit doesn't condemn me to paint my face paint my nails do those things that the world does he says I can see why and I want you to understand all of these and I'm going to label this Feelgood churches because the churches out there are not going to tell you you need to live a holy life the Bible says without Holiness no man shall see God they will not tell you uh uh that it's wrong to get divorced and remarried and all of that stuff they don't in fact they're full of counseling we just give you counsel we we've got counselors for those of you that are all going through some trials and we all got trials even among the message just because you are married together and it says now I pronounce you husband and wife you may kiss the bride and you introduce them and go live happily ever for after that's a fairy tale because you know what you're going to have difficulties in your Mar I don't care how good that marriage is how long it's been together you still got issues oh don't sit there like you're sanctimonious and you no you're going to have issues but it's only the holy spirit in your lives that's going to keep you bound together amen God help us to tell the truth to our people you young people it's not a guarantee just because you came down here and you exchange rings and vows no it's going to take work you're going to have disappointments discouragements and everything that's why we try to teach you huh don't try to stop the train after it's left the station stop it before it leaves the station amen that's why we have our youth meetings that's why we talk to our young people so young brother young sister you're thinking about getting married you're thinking about saying I do to somebody I hope to God that you've prayed and sought God that that person is the right one and they're filled with the Holy Ghost because if you don't you might be the next one that just in the divorce court that's why that's why we teach these things so the difference between us and denominational churches is a revelation of the holy spirit because the holy spirit in you is going to make you obedient to all the word of God not just taking what you want and what you don't want huh look at the Great revivalist even going on in this our day Benny hen TD Jake go on you can name them one after another look at the crowds look at the people look at the way they dress the way they live but just come oh God he just loves everybody don't you just love him let's all sing Love and so it's a feel-good church because I can go there and I won't feel condemned excuse me but I'm going to use my own twin brother as an example December 6 of last year I took my twin brother out for lunch of course you know he and I and Mitch Buckingham we all came to the message together but it was just a matter of time and life goes on we get married and everybody gets married and issues come up next thing you know he's divorced goes back to California leaves the message bring it up to December 6 of last year just a few days away this was my birthday so I take him out for lunch for my birthday our birthday I make him wait 6 minutes because I'm 6 minutes older and then I told him I and he starts I don't know what was he had a bur under his saddle do you know the expression he just was upset he just didn't well you know what you know what how I feel about the people in this message they're all Hypocrites they're just a bunch of Hypocrites and on and on and the more he starts going on I said hey hey I call him brv we couldn't say brother we said brother and we shortened it to brv so everybody growing up knowing us as twins they just didn't say Ron and Don they said the brvs hey brv I told my brother I said BR stop it I'm here to just have lunch why well you just can't take it and you know what I don't like coming to your church I said why come yeah well I feel condemned every every time I come and I said I said you should feel condemned because you want to drink you want a date you want to the movies and the things of the world and you don't want anybody to tell you what to do and I said so you come to church and you sit right there and everybody kind of thinks that he's my twin brother than he believes the message he don't so I told him and said why come so he hasn't come since I'm just being honest with you it hurts me with my own family when they walk away from it I can't make anybody believe it do you understand that I can't make anybody believe it I'm just saying that we're in the midst of a modern day Babylon right now and she's giving out a cup full of the wine of her fornication what is fornication unclean living is that right am I said revelation of the spirit is what makes us different not the moving of the spirit or the anointing of the spirit because the anointing one the anointed ones of the end he said it's the Gen Holy Spirit falling upon seed and nonseed do they not raise up and worship God do they not feel his presence why his reain falls on the just and the unjust Matthew 5:43 and 48 you have heard it is both been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them the C curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil on the evil and on the good and sendeth his Reign on the just and the unjust now if I was God I wouldn't do that because I'm carnally thinking well no I'm only going to let my anointing my my goodness and my blessing come upon only my seed but no he lets it Go upon seed and nonseed are we together on that the name Babylon comes from the the word Bal b a l a l it means confusion and you get babyon it's it's a compound Hebrew word which actually means the Gate of God so remember when they made the Tower of Babel they were thinking we're making a Stairway to Heaven this is our way to get to God but we understand there's only one mediator between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus Babylon was founded by Nimrod the son of kush the son of ham the son of Noah Now watch how brother picks this out in the the seven Church age book perian Church AG Babel is the original name for Babylon it means confusion it was literally started by Kush the son of ham but was brought to a kingdom of power and Grandeur under his son Nimrod the mighty Hunter Nimrod according to Genesis 11 account and also according to profane history Nimrod set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong Nation he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished his accomplishments were so Monumental that the kingdom of Babylon was called the head of gold amongst all World governments that his religion gained prominence is proven by the fact that the scripture identifies it with Satan completely in Isaiah chapter 14 and Revelation chapter 17 and 18 and by history we can prove that he invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatry Babylon is it's the basis of every form of idolatry and the theme of Mythology though the names of gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people that he made a name for himself and his followers goes without saying for as long as this present age goes on until Jesus reveals himself to his Brethren he will be worshiped and honored through though under a different name from Nimrod and in a temple slightly different from the one in which was originally adored let me show you something very interesting that as I studied about babyon I want to show you in 2 Kings chapter 17 2 Kings 17 the king of Assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from th and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land notice the god of the land not the god of heaven and one of the priests whom They Carried Away from Samaria came and dwelt in bethl and taught them how they should fear the lord how be it every nation make gods of Their Own and put them in the houses of high places which the Samaritans had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwell and the men of Babylon made suo Beno who made this the men of Babylon others made God's idolatry but the men of Babylon made suo Beno what does that mean in Hebrew let me show you it means booths of the daughters means brothel means idolatrous tents for impure purpose to commit adultery and fornication so the men of Babylon the spirit behind it suo benath means houses of fornication that's the spirit behind it why it's unclean it's adulterous it's fornicating in fact their worship was to worship the woman and to worship was to have sex with her this is what the men of Babylon started that's why the original go back to the original sin it wasn't eating an apple do you see do you see how that now the Earth all the media all the social agenda all of the Instagram Facebook Twitter whatever it's filled with things that come from this very thing of Babylon wants to seduce your minds the men brought forth from the men brought forth from Babylon idolatrous worship and it was incorporated with the worship of women through fornication and idolatry now here in America we're witnessing now let's bring bring it down home Pagan feasts of the Catholic Church I just Googled it yesterday how many holidays holiday means what holy day doesn't it how many holy days do we celebrate every year that comes from the Catholic Church hey Siri that's what I did hey Siri how many of our holidays have Catholic origin hang on it's having a hard time computing watch this here's what it told me Christmas Easter Valentine's Day Halloween Good Friday Carnival also known as Marty gr Ash wednesy Ash wednesy is I hope you had a good Marty Gro come to church and we'll put an ashing cross on your forehead and we will absolve you of everything you did wrong the past week idolatrous pagan holidays have any of you Hey listen I didn't really you know I heard of marra before I've heard of Carnival before because I heard about it over there in I think Florida or or New Orleans New Orleans with the marra and all of the stuff and the parade and but I I took some brothers with me uh uh they came to visit me when I lived in Germany and it was Carnival and I wanted to take him out to dinner so guess what everywhere the where we were at it was all Carnival it was all they were all people dressed up and blowing horns and it was crazy it was like adult Halloween and people all dressed up so I said well let's cross the border and go into Holland so we went into Holland to to Fino and I went to my favorite uh restaurant which was a Chinese Indonesian and then unfortunately every and all of them were doing Marty gr too and I thought let's just go in and have you know some I there's a a a dish there called Bobby pong gang I love it's my favorite dish in the world Bobby pong gang all of you Google it figure it out try to cook it have me over for dinner anyway I take these brothers and it got so loud and people and people dancing and everything I said let's hurry up and eat and get out of here so as we did we got up and the women came over to brother Dave Cook if any of you knew did Dave Cook and come here Dave like so Dave dances with her out to the front door and Dave looked at me he said I'm so happy happy to see how you guys celebrate Carnival over here he was joking but I said Brethren I'm sorry I said but the whole world has been indument with all of this stuff it's okay it's not I want you to understand those are pagan holidays and they are coming back from Pagan worship and yet it's celebrated here in America and we think nothing about it God help us thank you Lord for sending us a prophet that told us that where Christmas come from told us where Easter comes from and said hey you know what it's Christianity versus idolatry are you listening to the same tapes I listen to and when you listen to that and then wonder how is this stuff celebrated and I want to say this the farther we get away from the time of brother Brennan preaching it among his people to years later churches now are embracing it as though it's nothing oh brother Ron you're just an old fogy you're just a a mean old guy that just won't let us have any fun it's idolatry stay away from it lot they see in church age he said now of course they are poor he said that that means they're spiritually poor sign of the age as it closes is bigger and better churches with more and more people and with more and more manifestation of what is supposed to be the demonstrations of the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost but they filled Alters watch this the gifts of the Spirit in operation the remarkable attendance is not the answer from God for those who come to the altars very seldom stay to go on with God and after the great campaigns are finished we are all those who came down the aisles they heard a man they listened to an appeal they came into the net but they were not fish and turtle likee they crawled back to their own Waters what is a denomination let me ask you this what is a denomination here's what Webster said denomination a large group of religious congregations United under a common faith and name and organized under a single Administration and legal hierarchy let me paraphrase it when a group of people take the leadership of man over the leadership of God they've denominated making private interpretations of the word and turning the word of God into fables Creeds and dogmas now brother brandham put this prophecy on the cornerstone of Brenham Tabernacle make full make Proof full proof of thy Ministry for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but shall reap and Heap up fables and doctrines yeah Lord help us you would think that the brandom Tabernacle today would be probably the most thriving biggest church in America go there go there and visit sometime it's a museum my heart broke I walked through as I walked through the front and of course they don't want you to get up and get behind the pulpit that you know just this this IM me don't touch these things so we walked in and I looked at the pulpit and it's empty there's no one there there's no one in the congregation The Voice is not here the very Cornerstone of this message they've silence to the voice they've closed the doors and even if you have a prayer meeting you can't even pray out loud and you have to get online to say what time you're going to go there to pray I say it's nonsense something inside of me is rising up against it and say it wasn't no Catholic Church that's going to close your doors it's a Catholic spirit and you're going to worship a man and he's going to tell you what tape to listen to and where how to do it and when and everybody nonsense you listen to those tapes at home and you read your Bible and pray that when you come to this church if I'm saying something that is contrary to this message or your Bible get away from it amen God's governing rule is by theocracy not democracy theocracy is a government government ruled by or subject to religious Authority democracy is not God's way of leadership that's man's all of this stuff we're you know not not going to be a democratic Nation anymore and all of this politics all of this stuff brother Bram said democracy is not of God let me show you is your life worthy of the Gospel 1963 remember not long ago in this Tabernacle I preached on a subject about 20 years ago not long ago that's how I am Sandy says uh you know I tell him well I just did this not long ago and she said I that's 25 years ago you here not long ago 20 years ago I'll show you the goddess of America had a little flapper here sitting there with it and that's what it is they're getting what they've asked for and they're going to get it that's all no they won't believe it no sir they let you know that they're American citizens and they got a right to function any way they want to let me tell you I'll tell you now no sir politics will never work no sir democracy will never work democracy is rotten to the Bone if it could be run among a bunch of Christians it'd be fine but when you put it out there in the world it becomes all sails and no anchor exactly right look at here today anything can take place and they'll just anything pull a few politics and get away with murder look at this Prophet looking at the symptoms of America democracy is a rule by majority that's not God's rule God Rules by one king or queen is that right a monarchy that's called a theocracy Anarchy is no rulership recognized at all so take away and have no rulership Democratic or Theocratic you have Anarchy that means anything goes and then you have communism which is a theoretical e e omic system characterized by the collective ownership of property and by the organization of labor for the common advantage of all members sounds good brother Brenham they even asked brother Brenham what about in in the book of Acts where they put all their stuff together and they all lived as one and they gave to those who had little and etc etc he said it won't work today how many of you know that he said otherwise now that's what they did a giving an example in Prescott so everybody that lived in the Prescot Church in that little trailer park they all worked for the same company and they pulled all their money and the head of that group got to pay the brothers well I'll give you so much cuz you don't have a big family in fact you're not even married so I'm going to give you so much money so you weren't getting paid by the hour you were getting paid all the money got given to him and then he passed it out now understand I think next week we might start our own company and all of you can work for me and all the money comes to me and I'll give it to you guys as I think you need it I would hope some of you go n n sorry a wrong and yet brother renham said what they did then the book of Acts will not work again for today fact Paul said the a man who doesn't work he don't eat boy there' be a lot of people on this intermittent fasting anyway even within the message you have different ones who do not believe in going to church or even having a home Church they don't know the difference between organ organized religion and a church that's been set in order do you hear the difference they don't know the difference between organized religion and a church that's been set in order brother Brenham said you watch the gifts of the Spirit if they're not set in order and used correctly do more damage to the church then they do good even says that ministers have invaded the pulpit without a call of God on their life oh god brother Brenham said the church in order he didn't organize it no he was against organizing churches watch this we would see Jesus 1961 well you see Mr Brandon we're not supposed to argue the word I said I'm not arguing the word I'm just asking you I've got hops Two Babylons I've got ancient histories that I can find here's the Nan fathers Nan Council pre nine Council all right right here in my study show me anywhere there was a Catholic church till 3005 show me where it was he said you're quoting history I said how do I know there was a George Washington here only by history show me something different see I said that's exactly right God never did organize a church it never was God's plan to do it organizations mother church it's Catholic and all the rest of them is off of that same organization according to Revelation 17 that's exactly right breaking down Fellowship now watch this when a denominational spirit gets among the people of the message it destroys Fellowship one with another it does brother Bram said this message will never denominate the but some of the people already have yeah the message can't because the message is Christ God God help us to have our eyes open to what's happening then we got all these private interpretations about you know well he said this but he meant that and next thing you know we got a little group and they pull off that little group and to show you how bad it gets so they follow a man that man can pull a group of people away from the message they can all follow him and he dies and goes off the scene and they still play his tapes yeah go figure it's happening Daniel Andes took me through Jeffersonville and he says have you ever seen Don rutles church I said no sir you want to go see it yeah he said you want to see Junior Jackson's Church yeah have any of you seen you know have any of you been brother Steve you have anybody else they're not big churches are they Martin how many people are in them it's a handful and there a bunch of old gray-haired people going in there the kids are saying this is nonsense and do they preach no they play the tapes of Don ruddle or Junior Jackson saints of God I will come back from the grave and haunt you if God takes me off of the scene and you play my tapes I will cuz I don't want you to follow me you follow Christ you follow the Bible you follow God's word quit following the leadership of man yes God uses man but it's not the leadership of man brother Brenham said I believe in I believe in God filled God ordained God sent men who are equipped with the word so you're not following the man you're following God he still uses man I pray I'm one of them amen Fellowship is always hindered when you have your interpretation goes against my interpretation next thing you know we can't have fellowship if we will say what the word of God says or what the message says how can we just Fellowship one another how can we just say what he says well it means this it means that somebody sent me a clip of Donnie Reagan preaching little clip So I listened to it I listened to it last night talked about gono yes it took an Apache to catch an Apache because the white man could not follow the Apache no matter where he went through the the mountains over here in Arizona so they got some other Apaches who followed the white man next thing you know they caught gonal put him in a train put them all of them in there and the different ones with their different ideas trying to paraphrase it right now and they started fighting excuse me in the Box Car drawn Mo stood up and he said stop fighting yourselves there's so few of us left let's stick together I feel like that in the message there's so few of us left are you kidding me our papers are saying you're are a cult you're this and that you people are weird well let's quit fighting one another let's have perfect love I believe that before we get out of here the very last thing that that bride's going to have and it's going to be perfecting her is what perfect love Yeah amen a sign of this time brother Bram says my brother sister get away from these matter modern Babylon walls they're going to fall one of these days and you'll be the victim of them get out of it my people and be ye separated sayeth the Lord and I will receive you and you'll be Sons and Daughters un me and I'll be a god unto you where at the end time the writings on the wall ikabod on the church the spirit of the Lord has Departed the church is being made ready come out walk separate get out go to the middle of God's salvation and hang on to Christ until the hour of his wrath has passed the signs and wonders of his near coming of approaching that's coming near now at hand his spirit's right here oh I hope you don't judge me a fanatic if I am I don't know nothing about it I believe to be the servant of the Lord God and after the great striking things that I've said about the end time remember Jesus promised to appear here at the end time the Gentile age and so the same thing as he did when he represented himself to the Jews how' he do it by Discerning their thoughts and telling them where they'd been and tell all such things that was the last sign before the destruction and here it is again tonight the same Holy Spirit the same Jesus in the form of the holy spirit with his picture taken the pillar of fire every scientific thing like it was in those days in Babylon here it is right back again tonight we're at the end time he knows all about you do you believe it I'll tell you what do not put your trust in this nation do not put your trust in president Trump pray for him that's true but don't put your trust in our government put your trust in God let me show you very quickly here before I bring this to a close the same issues that Daniel faced in the time of being captured by Babylon I want you to see it from the scripture so I'd like you to turn with me in your Bibles to Daniel chap 4 Daniel chapter 4 verse 29 through 37 at the end of 12 months he walked in the Palace of the kingdom of Babylon then the king spake who is he who is the king at that time Nebuchadnezzar and the King spake and said is not this great babyon that I have built from the house of the Kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my Majesty sounds like somebody else that's so narcistic that everything look what I done I did this I did that I I I that's why be careful and while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from Heaven saying oh King Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall Drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will look at that seven seasons will pass until you know the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men the same hour the thing was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the Dew of the Heaven till his hairs were grown out like eagle feathers and his nails were like Bird's Claws and at the end of the days in other words that's prophecy Seven Seasons at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven and my understanding returned unto me and I blessed the most high and I praised and honor honored him that liveth forever whose Dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to Generation Now I want to ask you is he doing this because he's got divine Revelation is this some kind of divine Epiphany oh God no it's cuz God humbled him made him eat like an ox amen until the time had passed and then his mind returned to him look at this 35 and all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand and say unto him what doest thou at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom my honor and my brightness returned unto me my counselors and my lords sought out me and I was established in my kingdom and excellent Majesty was added unto me now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of Heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in Pride he is able to abase so he's saying this CU you know what he was humbled oh look at this great Kingdom Babylon look at this Kingdom I have done this and I have built it and it's so great look at the glory of Babylon and God humbled him hey God can humble you real quick too you think you've built something up you think this is all you know look at me look at what I've done hey you better you see when he was saying these things and he was saying oh he's the god of heaven and this and that he's not saying it by Revelation he's saying it because God humbled him do you know that at the at the end time that every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that he's God I'm going to ask you is that divine revelation it's just an admitting he's God even the Devils would admit he's God Pharaoh his Moses God is God so all of this stuff that just like Nebuchadnezzar and I'm going to show you in the scriptures in the next sermon or two did you take manasse one of the tribes and how he did so evil in the sight of the Lord more evil than all but and caused all of Israel to depart and did Evil and so and so but at the end of his days I'm going to show you in Scripture that he had an Affliction come upon him and he got very sick and he turned his face towards God because of his Affliction and the Bible says and God intreated him and God allowed him to come back now you would have thought that all the horrible things he did caused Israel to go so far off worse than all the others and yet God the Bible says and he did all these things before God humbled him he came back he's going to to be one of the tribes I want you to talk about predestination I want you to think about it for just a second predestinated manasse did more evil than all the others and caused them all to go wrong and yet he's going to be there how did God do it there was an Affliction putting on turned his face towards God and the Bible says and God entreated him and he did all the this unto him before he was humbled and after he was humbled he came and he tore down those places he had built up he took down the altars and he he destroyed all of that stuff and yet it says after he died and watch his the next king that comes on his son and he he did evil in the sight of the Lord even as his father had done even though we teach our kids sometimes what we have soed in our youth comes back to haunt us in our old age oh God help us bring our children up and nurture and admonition of the Lord Daniel chapter 5 we'll use this this will be our closing may I ask you brother Mark my voice is a little rough right now would you read Daniel chapter 5 I'll give you a moment to find Daniel 5 and verses 18 through 31 while he's turning to that there's a quote I want to show you brother R said in raising gyrus daughter Brethren go ahead you know oh how wonderful then this Maniac run down to and the Lord Jesus rebuked them spirits and a lot of people say that religion will run you crazy not the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ won't it'll give you your right mind and you're not in your right mind until you have met the Lord Jesus look at that isn't that amazing he said you're not even in your right mind till you met the Lord Jesus he said maybe the 250lb man of muscle like some kind of an animal he ain't a man he's a beast certainly man is not measured by the muscles or by his stature man is measured by his character whatever he is he is by character Daniel chapter 5 brother Mark if you would start at Verse 18 and if I stop you for a moment and I elaborate go ahead oh Thou King the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honor and for the Majesty that he gave him all people Nations and languages trembled and feared before him whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive and whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened and when his heart was lifted up here's the first sign something's going wrong and his mind hardened in what pride comes before keep reading he was disposed from him his kingly throne and they took his glory from him and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the Dew of Heaven till he knew that the most high God ruled in the Kingdom of men and that he appointed over it whomsoever he will and thou his son o b shazar Hast not humbled thine heart though thou knewest all this hold on hold on oh Bel shazar Hast not humbled thine heart though thou knewest all this you knew what I have done to your father and yet look at you with your pride lifting up go ahead keep reading but has lifted up thyself against the Lord of Heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy Lords thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine in them and thou Hast praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor know and the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorified then was the part of the hand sent from him and this writing was written now watch this here's a writing on the wall and this is the writing that was written meany meany tearson this is the interpretation of the thing meany God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it tle thou are weighed in the balances and are found wanting Paris thy kingdom is divided and given to the mes and Persians then commanded belshazzar and they clothed Daniel with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the Kingdom in that night was Bazar the king of the calans slain and Darius the median took the kingdom being about 3 score and 2 years old now we can tell by what happened to the king of Babylon and to his son who took over the kingdom and watch how the pride get lifted up until the handwriting is on the wall if there's one thing about America she needs to Humble herself instead of being so proud and arrogant now humble yourself before God watch this musicians if you come I have two quotes here I want to close with 1958 brother BR preaches the sermon handwriting on the wall this 1958 oh if there was a time that Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
