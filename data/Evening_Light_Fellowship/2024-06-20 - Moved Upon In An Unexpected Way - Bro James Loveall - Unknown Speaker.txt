gracious Heavenly Father Lord we humble ourselves in your presence Lord it's nothing that we can say within ourselves it's father we didn't choose it but lord it's not what we choose it's what you have already chosen father this is what you've birthed us to be and father we want to step into that tonight and Lord as Believers we want to walk by faith and trust and believe that you're going to move and you're going to minister to our hearts and so father would you you come by our way and would you walk the aisles and Lord there's needs upon the people's hearts and father we see that we're living in a dark world but father there's light that is going to shine tonight and we're just asking that the word come forth and may it bring life oh God to the Believers we just Commit This service into thy hands father move us aside soften the hearts of the people people father may we receive what you would have us to receive for this evening have your way in the service we commit It For Your Glory in Jesus name amen and amen if you have your Bibles and turn with me to Genesis 1 Genesis 1 and one and then Genesis 1 and4 trust you're happy to be a Christian am happy to be in the house of the Lord amen Genesis 1 And1 it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness God saw the light that it was good and he divided the light from the darkness so what does that make darkness and God called the day the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day now let's skip down to verse 14 and we know here in the second day he created the firmaments and and the third day he would separate the waters from dry land and Waters and he would create her herb yielding seeds and we see in chapter four here and God said let the lights in the firmament of the Heavens to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs for seasons and for days and years and something spoke to me and said what are those signs for there's not even a people yet upon the Earth but yet he said let these firmament be created for signs for seasons for years and for days and let them be for lights in the firmaments of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser night to rule the night he made the Stars also so here he names the stars but as I begin to think to myself why didn't he say he created two lights the greater one he created the sun to Rule the Day and the moon to rule the night because in we would know in a symbolic form that God is talking about something greater there's something hidden there and God set them in the firmaments of the Heavens to give light upon the Earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from darkness and God saw that it was good so God divided here completely the first time he divided light from Darkness completely but then Darkness he adds another form of light and separates it again so no matter what time day or night there's still light shining you can be seated tonight we're going to turn over to Isaiah 42 and verse 1 Isaiah 42 and verse one take this thank you behold my Ser servant whom I uphold mine elect and whom my soul delighteth I have put my spirit upon him and he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets a bruised Reed shall he not break and a smoked Flack shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth and I begin to look at what is a bruised read and as you would know what a bruise is a brood is is an inward thing it's a bruised re an inward pain that is that it would be and a and he says here that it would be a a smoke flax as it was in back then in the oil lamps he wouldn't quench the fire from that wax as a as a fire would be B burning from a lamp and he says he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he set judgment in the earth and the owls shall wait for his laws thus saith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out and he that spread the forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it he giveth breath unto the people upon it and the spirit to them that walk therein so you see that the same God that created the heavens and the Earth the same God that said let there be light amen is the same God that gives not only the breath of life but he gives his Spirit into those that will that will walk therein and I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thy hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles what was it for to open the blinded eyes to bring out to the prisons from those the prisoners from those in prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house as you see here them that sit in darkness outside of the prison house what is it people that sit in bondage you don't have to sit in some prison somewhere and be in bondage but many people come to church or they live their lives in in bondage Bound by something Bound by Darkness maybe Bound by a pain Bound by anxiety Bound by fear Bound by worry and yet they are bound brother Brandon would say that he he he would say that he's a typologist and he would begin to type things because there's patterns and there's seasons and God does things as types and shadows right the Bible says that there's nothing new Under the Sun you can't learn you know brother Brandon would begin to talk about Theology and learning it from schools and everything you know message preachers we're not going to learn it from those type of things but you know if we're not careful you know you begin to get on Google and you your Revelation becomes not only just preachers but message Believers of Googling this and Googling that and what is what does AI say about that I have a question let me type it in I have a question let me type it in to to Ai and try to get an answer what is it many times we fail to get on our knees and get a revelation from God something to minister to the people something to seek the mind of God for but it's so easy to get on and you can type in something into a into let's say even to the message what is the prophet say about this and you know what we try to do is we try and we get a thought from God and we study it out in his word because everything has to go back to his word and it has to line up to that Bible and we take it and we read it and we try to find this story aligns with that story and maybe God begins to unfold something in our own thinking and we begin to write it down and after it's put together what I do is I try to take it back to the message of the hour and find where does the Prophet say about it and the beautiful thing about it is if if it's a God and God is speaking and God wants to say something His prophets already said it there's nothing new there's no new revelation His prophets already brought it the light for this day has already been spoken why because it's the word for this hour so if we could take a thought this evening moved upon in an unexpected way moved upon in an unexpected way in a subject of separating light from Darkness brother brandham says in questions and answers 54 he says all things of types and shadows when God made the heavens and the Earth he made the moon to shine in the absence of the sun to give light while the sun was gone see a beautiful type of Christ in the church the church is the Moon to give light to the world while the the sun is gone see what I mean a lesser light amen he says then otherwise the moon and the sun is husband and wife and Christ in the church is husband and wife the wife being a weaker vessel only gives a smaller light in the absence of the husband being the weaker vessel is giving a a lesser light than that of the husband so why is is Satan so after this world and this generation a of equal rights females to have equal rights and equal power and all this why because they want their own power can you imagine if the Sun and the Moon begin to battle it out and the the moon said I I don't want to shine at night I want my time to be during the day what would happen to the orbit what would happen to Creation what would happen to the growth of your family the Moon being the weaker vessel and be in the Lesser light but yet she's still a reflection of her husband and the church can only make manifestations of the Holy Spirit and remember the moon cannot give any light of her own and when you see the Moonlight it cannot it's not the Moonlight it's it's the reflection of the sunlight and Christ ascended up is that right he says the Sun and shines his light on the church to reflect his light and power to the world in his absence so anything that we can do down here on Earth it has nothing to do with ourselves we have nothing to do with it all we are here is to reflect the Sun not the sunlight but the S so in the Son of God for our day and our hour yes just as a day of natural light we know the progression of light and the progression of light as it begins to start and it rises in the East and it begins to rise up it is not the Dead Heat of the day but as the sun begins to Peak up in the East and it begins to rise it is the warmth of the sunlight and Dew begins to Rise Up from the earth it is warming everything up to a certain temperature and as the day goes on it gets warmer and warmer what is happening it's the progression of the sunlight it is not hot from the very beginning it it Peaks its head over and as it begins to set it begins to cool off what is God showing us just as he created the heavens and the Earth and he began to create light from Darkness but in the beginning he just didn't Express and create light and everything that was light came to an existence but he shows us a pattern that it develops in cycles and in Seasons because if the plant life and things that relied upon the sunlight if it was an intense heat if it was the dead of Summer Phoenix 110 all day long from the day it Rose to the time it set nothing could have life it would be hot you ever planted something in the wrong season you ever tried to plant something in summer what happens it dries up and kills it why because it didn't get have time to put Roots down or if it was in the dead of winter somewhere and there was snow the sun still shines but yet it's not in in an atmosphere that a seed could grow under that sunlight but there is a time coming that in the winter it's going to turn over and that light and that seed that lays within the Earth is going to be able to bring forth of its own kind it's a progression so a progression of light a progression of life is dependent upon the progression of light a progression of life is dependent upon the progression of life just like your Christian walk you and I don't come to to Earth and you know these young boys they don't have all the revelations and know it all and if we were to have them come up and try to preach us a sermon they probably couldn't do it why because the Revelation isn't unfolding unto them I don't know it all but yet what it is is we're growing daily and we're maturing every single day and it's a process of sitting under the sunlight under the light of God and to re to re reject this sunlight to reject this sunlight would be death both naturally and spiritually brother Brandon would share a story about a man and he would say if there the Sun was shining outside and a man ran into a basement and he rejected the light said that there's no light there's no life out there the the sunlight isn't real he said you would consider him a crazy man and yet we s in a generation where the the the light of God has been shown and people have rejected the word of God they rejected the light for this hour it's the same thing but in a different form to reject the natural light is to reject death or to accept death you see his God sent his light His True Light to every age and over time as it moved down it began to get brighter and brighter and more Revelation and more Revelation as we see in the church ages God sent a light to every age and he would begin to unfold himself in a form and that was Truth for their day and you see that let's start at Luther and You Begin the Reformation of Luther and you would see that he would Minister a word and it would be a light for his day and it would begin to light up that age and it was truth but what happened they begin to denominate they begin to walk away they begin to walk away from this word of God they begin to get their own ideas and add to it truth for their hour it was it started out as the real light even through the Dark Ages and even the times of the you know the Christians being martyred and even when we went a few month or so ago whenever it was and they be you begin to walk the Coliseum and you can see where all the Christ Christians would have been martyred all the ones that gave their lives for the truth of their day and yet what would give them something to begin the more they killed the more would begin to come forward and give their lives what wasn't it wasn't themselves but it was their light they were catching the light for their day and they wanted that truth and they were coming forth but as the age goes on Darkness would happen and in each age God would raise up a man for that age they would have a truth until they denominated and you know the thing about artificial light here it's dependent upon a power source it's dependent upon a power source you can feel the anxiety the worry the fear is this supposed to happen but it's dependent upon the power source and as long as the power switches on we have light and there's no darkness and as long as that power source is turned on we have life and what would happen to every age as I said Luther would come and they be be he would begin to preach and share the light for that day and people would begin to catch it and light would come on and then they would denominate and God would pull himself from that and move away and darkness would happen upon the the Earth but what happened God raised up another man a light for that day he would begin to minister the word of God now I want want you to pretend that this is lamp and as a man would walk the Bible says the word is a lamp into our feet and a light into our path you understand that as you begin to walk the the light follows it begins to follow if I go over here or if I go over here see you guys can identify where the light is because this is the only light in the room and as I begin to walk listen it's my footsteps are in front of me and I can see where I'm going I can see that there's a step here but what happens is it's coming to me many people have a flashlight religion too they have it has a power source and if you turn off the power you're back in darkness so you come to church and you walk around and it's a lamp unto our feet and you can walk like this but then whenever you go out in the world and you go to school and you go to work and things begin to get dark AR around you and you want to fit in and you want to dress like the world and you want to wear a little makeup and you want to do a few things what do you do you turn off and you can fit in and you don't see it nothing's wrong but yet darkness is creeping into the home little things coming into our lives and yet God would raise up a man in that age and he would come with the word you see why why is it a lamp unto our feet because if we had a flashlight and we begin to shine out here we don't see what's in front of us we can't identify what's in front of us and when you can't identify what's in front of you that's when you begin to trip up that's when you begin to fall that's when you begin to make mistakes and you fall short and the and with the flashlight you begin to look around what is everybody else doing over there what is that church doing what is this doing all right oh we have it right here this is as far as we need it when you have a lamp the word of God to light your path and he sends the word and it lights up the the age once again go ahead Brothers he begins to light up the age you see the prophet of God said whenever you walk away from the true word of God for that day that's when the Holy Ghost that's when the Holy Spirit pulls himself from it artificial light dependent upon a power source dependent upon a sensation dependent upon a feeling when you become dependent upon something else maybe you're dependent upon a preacher some kind of preacher a song leader well they didn't sing me happy and you're dependent upon that to get worked up into an atmosphere listen when you have the word of God and it's the light for the day and you begin to walk in that light you're not dependent upon anything else you're not dependent upon a light source you're not dependent on is my is my person sitting next to me are they into church or you know do I got to come to church on a Wednesday Sing me happy and I don't feel like praising it don't matter if you don't feel like it that's the time to praise the Lord that's the time to say I believe in the word of God I believe this message of the hour it was sent for our day brother brandom says from that time on in 62 he says I've always said about organizations now we I know he's speaking in in a audience of of denominations listen to what he says he says I've always said about organizations I believe in them and I believe that they are fine they serve a purpose but you see when we make an organization 90% of us when we make and put down this is what I believe period this is what I believe period if you say this is what I believe comma and put as much as God is willing to add to us that's right that's all right then listen there's good people in denomination and I'm not going to take them out of Heaven because they don't believe what we believe yeah they might not be bride but we can't take them out of Heaven there's going to be good people up there there and Heaven is big enough for them too but this is what I believe period we got to be careful that we don't get that attitude in the message well this church says this and that church says this period this is what I believe no we're dependent upon the holy spirit that I say every time that I come to the house of God that you would Minister to my life that if Lord if I'm sitting here and maybe I'm cold and I'm starchy or maybe I haven't said amen in a while that you would move amongst us that you would speak to my heart and I could respond to that word you see when the pillar of fire moved Israel moved with it and in the New Testament when it began to move just exactly like it did in the Old Testament mve the same way Israel had to follow that Pillar of Fire and set the tent up under it and when it began to move in the last listen at the Reformation of Martin Luther saw it and then as soon as Luther was over they built an organization around Luther's work God moved right out from under it Wesley saw it and away he went and after Wesley Asbury and many others when after their time then that what happened they built an organization under it and God moved right out from under it and went right on you you see they tried to create a false light they tried to create a a false light brother Brandon would call it a painted fireplace you can't get warm from a painted fireplace listen if you're cold listen and it's dark a painted fireplace ain't going to do you no good ain't going to do you go good and brother Brandon begins to say and there's a man here that can turn on the light he says the greatest robber he begins to talk about the greatest robbery that ever took place was over in England it was like $7 million what was it because of a false light because of a false light what was it that train was headed down they set out some false light they stopped the train and they robbed them blind one of the greatest robberies brother brandom says and the greatest robbery the Church of God has ever had is a false light a glare their denomination he says it's robbed them from the power of the Holy Ghost it's took from the church the very Lifeline it's robbed them of the word of God when they've accepted a Creed instead of the word it's robbed them and they claim they have the word the word lives itself out of the of that for the age he says it makes itself known they claim they have the word too back there in the days of Jesus they said they saw a great light and they rejected it they saw it and they rejected it I say Lord let that not be us this tonight that we're not going to reject we're not going to turn around we're not going to pull away from this message there's many falling away and rejecting it falling faults with this and failures with this person but that if your Revelation isn't based upon that you won't fall if it's not based upon a man you won't fall that's why your Revelation has to be your own personal Walk With Jesus Christ and no matter how many false lights there is there is always a True Light to follow and that is the word of God the real genuine Holy Ghost as I said it's not dependent upon a camp meeting or or going to Camp or or some kind of anniversary meetings or some Gathering or a certain group no no no the Lord has placed you here in Phoenix Arizona to be a light in the city of Phoenix they you come every Wednesday and every Sunday and you you you fill up your lamps you know what happens too many times we go through out there in darkness and you know what happens when you're constantly using your lamps I only remember I'm old enough to remember the Coleman lamps but before the oil lamps what happens when you're constantly using the lamps you're burning oil like crazy you're burning it because you're always burning burning it what do you do on a Wednesday night you're coming and you're saying Lord fill me up Lord fill me up I got to make it to Sunday and I got to keep going I got to keep striving I got to keep living what is it that's what coming to church it'll charge you up it'll fill your tank [Music] up the man who who was credited with creating the artificial light we would know him as Thomas Edison he created you know there was many that had to you know a lot to do with it and putting it together but he was the one that created you know uh he was one that created the one that it lasted like 1,200 hours or something like that so he was credited with the light bulb creating the light bulb and you know the thing about it is this man he would say he' fail I failed 10,000 times he said I didn't fail 10,000 times it just to it was there it was 10,000 times or ways that the light bulb didn't work he says I never failed and I think the beautiful thing about it is is God in one day came down to earth and said let there be light and it was light no failures no Faults he just spoke it that's a God I can depend upon but what happens is US humans we try to invent something we try to come up with something and we have faults and we have failures but you you know what as long as you if you keep falling and you keep failing that's okay get back up again keep going because if you're not failing you're not falling you're not doing anything you're not brother Brandon would tell a story about a a Salesman the car salesman and that boy would come in for a job I believe it was and he would come as a Salesman and and he would come to get a job and the boy didn't have a pencil on his or eraser on his pencil and the man said where's your eraser at says I don't need one I don't make mistakes I don't make mistakes you ever heard those type of Christians I don't make mistakes guess what he said I can't use you I can't use you why because you're not afraid to fail you're not afraid to step out listen when the spirit of God sometimes moves upon you and he might have you to sing a song special and you never sung before you might give a testimony you might do something for somebody what is God he wants you to step out of your boat get out of your comfort zone don't be afraid to fail do something for God be a light you know when you begin to fail when you begin to do something for God you know what happens you begin to have critics critics you know that you begin to have critics well that brother man man he could preach this but yeah I wish he could preach like this or he needs to preach like that and I didn't ask you I didn't want this anyway well do it yourself you know what happens a lot of people want DIY do it yourself that's what we try to do with our Christian walk I'm going to DIY this I'm going to get through my own trial I'm going to do it myself I don't need nobody listen don't be afraid to fail but when you fail and you're on your knees get back up keep pressing on let's hit them critics because it's ones that bring discouragement when you try to do something for God what happens you begin to hear voices and people talk and oh why why is he up there and why this and why that and all the you know what then what happens you become discouraged you become distraught but yet brother Brandon would talk about every picture that went through the Hall of Fame had to go through the Hall of critics had to go through a hall of critics and you know the critics most of the time the ones that are criticizing are not even doing anything but criticizing that's right brother Ron said armchair quarterback oh if I was in the game this is how I would do it oh he missed the pass over here oh he did this why didn't he do that oh he should have you know called an audible he should have done this what is it armchair quarterback then he get in the game and then he fumbles the ball it's life CR criticism is going to come but that's okay you know when criticism happens brother brandom says you know what that is when little things come up and and maybe you know people are saying this or that or a little bit of criticism you know what that is Growing Pains of God's [Music] grace Growing Pains of God's grace brother brandham says in Shalom what is light the Vindicated word spoken word of God outside of that there is no light see you can't lighten the Earth with flashlights it takes God's word that's made manifest the Sun not the Su in but the s o in the Son of God for your day and in your hour you see when it's a real Holy Ghost when your foundation is upon the word of God no matter what comes you can always go back to this no matter the darkness outside no matter how cold no matter the way you feel it's not based upon your feelings but when you have the Holy Ghost and it's burning inside of you there's no way to put it out it goes with you when you go when you go to the store and when you go on vacation and when you go anywhere what is it it's the same light it's the Holy Ghost you can't put it out you can't turn it off it's the very life of the believer and the darker the darkness the greater the light the darker the darkness the greater the light will burn you see and many times God will move in a certain way an unexpected way let's take Paul and Silas let's take Paul and Silas brother and in the Bible it says and I have it here that acts whenever they begin to and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang songs unto God because of the condition that we're in listen they were in a prison cell and they were down in darkness and they were covered and they were in bondage and I'm sure rats and and crumbs were laying around them but whenever you're all completely engulfed in darkness what else is there to do what else can you do let's bring it to today in your condition maybe you're all wrapped up in darkness and you have this problem and that problem and you don't know what tomorrow holds but let me say this I Know Who Holds Tomorrow and that Darkness can be pushed out from the light but they sat in dark Darkness they didn't sit there and have a pity party they didn't sit there and question God and why and the Bible says at midnight why midnight it's more than a Time listen when M why midnight because it's the darkest of all hours it's trying to tell you something when it's the darkest of your hour and you don't know what tomorrow and you can't see too far what do you do let me say this yeah reading your Bible is good and you should do it but you can't do that in darkness yeah you can listen to a message tape but if you're sitting in their Darkness there's no access to that but what can you do you can begin to get on your knees and you can begin to pray on to God and say God I don't know what tomorrow holds I don't know the future but I trust you and I know that my my life is in your hands and you begin to worship and you begin to say praise God and in those prison chains listen they begin to worship and they begin to praise and what happened the doors begin to open not only did it set them free but it set those around them free and that's what happens when you come to church whenever you raise your hands and praise God and you've been praying in your prayer closet and you've been worshiping God what is he doing he's bringing a liberty he's bringing a freedom and you're going to set those around you free What Makes You Different I'm able to set that neighbor maybe you come to church maybe it's been a while since you've knelt down on your knees and talked to God hey I understand we're all humans we get busy with life life happens and if you don't dedicate time to God to pray and read time will pass you by but maybe it's been a while since you've knelt down and prayed and gave a little worship to God God inhabits the Praises of his people but yet you come to church and you sit next to somebody that has been they might set you free the effect that you might have on somebody else's life they don't even know it the darkest of all hours brother brandham says in we have seen the star and have come to worship him he says I think that light shines the best in darkness darker it is the better the light shines sometimes just a small little light where there's much light it's not noticed but the darker it gets that that small light will shine that much stronger and remember that there's no Darkness can exist in the presence of the light the light is so much more powerful than Darkness until it can't stand in the presence listen no matter how great your light is you might think that you have a little a little lighter and you might come to church and there might be some that you look up to and you see Grandpa he's over here and he has a bomb fire going and you have this brother over here and he's been basking in the word and they have a big old fire and you feel ashamed with your little light but yet a little light is better than no light and let me tell you something that little light whenever you go out into the world and you begin to get around your co-workers and you begin to go to school and you begin to walk around you don't even have to go to a certain place but people identify walking through an airport whatever may be amen they can identify that there's light and that light brings life and it presses out the darkness it pushes back the darkness now I want to take it back as we opened with Genesis and in Genesis 1 because we are Earth and vessels and we see that in the beginning that God created and it was without form and it was without void what is without form and I looked up form and it's a it's the visible shape or configuration of something it's a particular way in which a thing exists appears it's a manifestation but if it sits in darkness how do you know what it's supposed to manifest how do you know what it's supposed to be how do you know what the potential is supposed to be and void it contains nothing empty vacant not not occupied not filled it is just out there and so here you were this type of world that was going through life without form without purpose without reason you were all voided up there was nothing there you were vacant you were not filled with anything but then one day you know I was when I was listening to the tape brother Brandon began to talk about the Earth and before it began how long did it sit in vacancy how long did it sit there without form and darkness it could have been billions tril Millions how many years was it that it sat there without nothing on it nothing happening but yet it was kind of for a purpose because how long was it before you and the spirit of God began to blow across the Waters of your life maybe you were 12 years old may you were raised in this message but maybe you've gone 4050 I don't know how many years without the spirit of God and then one day the spirit of God begin to blow upon the waters he began to move and when God begins to move he brings life into it he brings life into that atmosphere and God began to move upon the waters what does Waters represent people so you're telling me the same thing that God did then and moving across the waters he's doing again tonight that he begins his holy spirit is going and it's blowing across the people and it's bringing it to light and it's bringing life to it as I said there's no way to know the potential until it is brought into the light because when Jesus said let there be light and there was light what is it it's a great revealing if you want to reveal something you bring it to the light if you want to reveal something you bring it into the light there's a lot of things done in darkness the world lives in darkness naturally the life of the world starts whenever it gets dark that's why to the believer there's nothing out there during the night time it's just death and the and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters moved upon in an unexpected way you see when the spirit of God begins to move upon your life that water had never felt the charge of the spirit of God it never felt the Embrace of God when he said let there be light it had never received just as we would see the sun rise it never felt the warmth of the ray of sunshine but yet when God begin to speak and he begin to say let there be light and he divided the light from the darkness and God saw that the light was good and God divided the light from Darkness you see God didn't take away the darkness God didn't take away the darkness but he left it there for a purpose he left it there for a purpose but he divided the light from the darkness and in darkness then he would place the Bible says he has two lights one great to rule the day and the other one to rule the night and in that night so now that he divided the darkness we see that in darkness there is still light to rule over that Darkness what is the purpose of the Moon to give light until the sun returns you see tonight he's still separating the light from Darkness from our lives he's still moving Upon Our Earth and vessels he's taking away things that aren't Christlike things in our lives that try to creep in and the Bible says gross Darkness would come upon the people and it would begin to creep in it might become in as little secret things we'll read maybe we watch maybe we see maybe we allow our kids to do dark dark nness creeping in maybe creeping into our homes to the kids rooms we don't even realize it and you say well I got my life yeah but the darkness is overcoming the Bible says Jesus told Peter the devil would sift you as we he's after you like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour darkness of complexes or sickness darkness of sin what is sin it's unbelief unbelief in his word because when you walk away from the light of God you're walking into darkness but you see whenever you have that Holy Ghost it pushes PES back the darkness it pushes back it becomes a barrier and as Darkness tries to come in it tries to come after your kids or it tries to take this and cause arguments between you and your wife or or or or disagreements or whatever it may be what is it it is a light that holds us it is an anchor it is our TI poost Ephesians 5 and8 says for we for ye were in some Darkness sometime Darkness but now ye are in Light walk as children in the light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving what is acceptable acceptable unto the Lord and have no fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame to even speak of those things which are done of them in secret that's a powerful scripture those things done in secret I say Lord help us to bring things into light and not allow these things to creep into our homes secret sins let me tell you something secret sins will become manifest if you are a son or a daughter of God secret sins will be manifest to light and you don't want God to do that you want to come and bring those things into manifestation and say God I have failed I have fallen down Lord I'm sorry I've made a mistake I'm going to do better Lord put these into the sea of your forgetfulness Lord help me to do better help me to keep these things in light because if God does it and he brings it to manifestation but all things that are reproved are made manifest by light for whatsoever doeth make manifest his light and wherefore he saith awake thou sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light I say it's time to wake up naturally and spiritually yes sir it's time to wake up and to identify and to recognize the light of your day the word for this hour to walk in the light as he is in the light and as the light keeps moving on as we keep progressing and moving forward we have an end goal we must move as the holy spirit moves and he guides us I'm going to close 1 John 1 and5 he says this then is the message that we have heard of him and declared unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another you want to have fellowship with God Walk In The Light amen if you want to have fellowship with him if you're wondering why things are going wrong or why there's just a disconnect listen if you stop talking to your wife and you just stop talking and stop having Fellowship you're going to have problems you're going to have problems because they want to express themselves to you they want to talk to you they want Fellowship there's a reason you married her is to have Fellowship to live this life together to enjoy life but if you cut that off what good is it so if you want fellowship with God talk to him talk to him walk with him and when you begin to walk with him and talk with him let me tell you he's going to walk and talk with you back you will have fellowship with him but if you walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin musicians come another scripture John 3 And1 19 and as I read this because many people read John 3:16 for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son we know that but yet in in John 3 19 and even between John 3:16 and 19 he says that my son was not to sent to condemn the world but through him might be saved but now listen to verse 19 but this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved mov D and he that doeth truth cometh to the light and that his deeds may be made manifest that they are rotten gone many people stop at John 3:16 that I believe that God sent this one down and he died for my sins and I can live as I want to but you got to keep going on this is the condemnation that they Lov Darkness more than light they rejected the light for their [Music] day then Jesus spake unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life I'm so thankful that we had a messenger sent to this day that would begin to walk us through the scriptures and he would begin to unfold the very word that was sent for our day and for our hour and if you want a sermon to go listen to go listen to Shalom go listen to Shalom good morning peace be unto you why to the bride it's a new day it's a new light it's the revealing of the word you don't have to walk in [Music] darkness Shalom peace bride listen this isn't our end [Music] goal he says the hour is upon us Darkness grows Darkness Darkness upon the people now that's what it is what does it all mean where are we standing what hour are we in how close are we to the coming 1964 he's saying this how close are we Church what doesn't mean God has begin to separate the light from Darkness see pressing it behind like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of a new day the church ages are fading out the church ages are fading out he says God is pressing the darkness into a place it has to do it to fade out the church organizations to fade out the world the world is covering the thing over worldly ISM has took the whole thing that isn't God right by worldly things and worldly dress and worldly acting and worldly living it's the world ye are not of the world Little Children You are of of Heaven this is not your [Music] home he says gross Darkness listen if you want to identify where we are this is it he says gross Darkness the blinding of Israel was the lightning for the Gentiles now the blinding of the Gentiles is lightning of the Israel it's just like the day and night one side has got darkness and the other has got light and then the light over over come comes over on the other side so the moon passing the way it did and the reflection of Darkness of the world blinding out it's light it's a reflection to us that the Gentile age is just finished the church is making herself ready been making herself ready for a long time it's time for Rapture for darkness is fading upon the Gentiles and the dawn will soon break upon the Jews the sun has traveled from the East to the west and we're on the west coast he says the light can only do one thing go back east on the other side you understand you know the light can only go back East again to where to where it began at Israel God blinding them for a while but the darkness now is pressing upon the Gentile world that's covered the whole thing the Gentiles will trod down Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation will be finished Jesus said so and now it's the finishing gross Darkness upon the people God reflecting it in the skies as he has shown it on the earth before it it happen we're in it we're here it's happening what is happening in Israel right now Wars free Palestine they don't even know why but there's a purpose it's got to come to manifestation what is it that part of the scripture that part of Prophecy what is it it's coming to light it's coming into Revelation is being made known before us don't miss it Bri the closing of the Gentile days is almost [Music] over it's almost time to go home [Music] you know as I begin to think about just even this quote [Music] here what was it this year we seen the eclipse the eclipse happening what was it the sun shining in the day and the moon covering it over let me ask you what happened to the Earth Darkness but on the other side it was [Music] light uniting time is happening the flashing red lights of the end time are [Music] here oh read these and be done because we got so much more to live for in Revelations 21 it says and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof Revelations 22 and there shall be no night there and they need no candle no light from the sun for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign they shall reain forever and ever you're going to rain ah this temporary Darkness though it presses though it tries to engulf us try though it tries to come in and pressurize listen there's a light that shines greater let us stand he says we have seen the star he says in this dark world someday is going to turn all light when Jesus Christ the son of righteousness shall come again then we shall have no more Darkness until that time just as we look out at night time and see the moon and he begins to talk about correlating that the Moon is just a reflection of the sunlight you are here to reflect him it's no light of your own no glory within ourselves but you are here to reflect him let's bow our heads father we humble ourselves in your presence Lord we're so thankful for the light we're so thankful for this light of the hour we're so thankful for the message of this hour we're so thankful that you sent our Prophet who didn't deviate and and tried to compromise with this message but he stayed with the light of the word of God and many would fall to the left and some would fall to the right and they would try to make it denom ation and we even see it happening within the message of you know press play and the different things that are that are going on we're not worried about those things we're staying focused on the very true light that you've given for this hour Lord I want to keep pressing the battle I want to fight the good fight of faith I want to shine my light Wherever I [Music] Go Lord let us not worry about uh uh this church light and that church but Lord let us focus and let us bask in your presence let us lay in the presence of almighty God lord I want to lay in the the light of the sun Lord that if there's any Darkness within me if there's any Darkness within my life may you cast it out Lord out of my life my family's life [Music] Lord I feel your presence Lord would you move upon the people father ones that maybe feel that their light isn't enough or it's not shining very bright that's okay keep coming keep sitting in the sun and that seed will bring forth of his kind it's just the progression of light and with that progression brings life and that life will begin to progress and it will begin to unfold father we're so thankful we want to say we love you and appreciate you Lord You're so worthy of everything that we could Lord forgive us for our shortcomings forgive us for our failures Lord we don't want fellowship with any kind of darkness no secret sin of Darkness we don't
