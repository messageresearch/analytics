has taken us and brought us into a realm yes that we might catch and understand what God is going to do part of that how do I know I will be a part of that because I'm a part of what's going on right now yes amen hallelujah heavenly father as we come to this portion of the word we ask your Holy Spirit to come and Quicken this word the author who Moved upon men of old to speak a prophetic word even they diligently sought at what time these prophecies would come to pass and here we stand in the last granules of the sands of time in God's great time piece and father we stand on the threshold of Eternity knowing that this is the end he said you don't need to write another history there'll be no one to read it after this amen father we thank you I pray a special anointing upon thy servant today upon thy people that you would Quicken us once again oh God by the foolishness of preaching we thank you we love you I pray that you'll be with us now anoint us with the isv of understanding we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you all let's just turn in our Bibles to Luke chapter 17 thank you musicians and all of you different ones uh we appreciate it God bless you Amen

to turn seven zero tomorrow he's going to join the club man God bless you brother Johnny official brother hey yeah you are special amen and um so we're just pleased I am so thankful for what God has done in my life thank you Lord to able to hear his voice and the ability to respond to it brother Bram said those that are predestinated they will hear the voice of God in the last dayen that for there will be many that will hear the articulation of the voice but will not catch the understanding that's why Jesus said why is it you don't understand my speech because I speak plainly to you so though the Bible is here and though we can read it and we understand its precepts or we try to as best as we can we ENT we know that except God Open the Eyes of of our heart it's a dead letter amen so we ask God to Quicken the word of God to us that we might know amen because how can we serve a God who we do not know he's just a strange something mythical something intangible something un believable but when God reveals himself to you he comes down personally yes thank you Lord and He makes himself known to you am and that making known to you we call Revelation amen and it's something we should be praying for all the time God give me Revelation because and we know Revelation is Faith and without faith yeah it is impossible to please God that's right God give us Faith let's say that together God give us Faith amen God bless you Luke 17: 28-30 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen Romans chapter 8 if you would then we'll go to Galatians chapter 3 amen Romans chapter 8 Romans 8 is a very fat yes fat lots of delicious yeah Delicacies of God Amen when just everything and and uh it's so wonderful all of you when you get a chance read Romans 8 in its entirety we will not this morning for the sake of time but we'll read Romans 8: 1-4 there is therefore now somebody say now now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus notice this there is a law of life of the spirit of the life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death yes two laws law of sin and death and the law of Life For What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh yes sir in fact I'll tell you he nailed it to the cross that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us let's say in US in US that makes you a part of it he did that to produce something in US amen thank you Lord that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in US amen who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen amen Galatians 3 vers 25- 29 Galatians 3 verse 25 but after that faith has come yeah we are no longer under a school Master right Lord for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ now we're not talking water baptism amen that's right right we're talking being baptized in Christ yes for how are we bapt for by one Spirit we're all baptized amen amen y spiritual baptism for as many of you has have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ amen there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus Hallelujah and if he be Christ then are you Abraham's seed yes and HS according to the promis now every one of you should have a smile on your face as you read that unless you're a void of understanding and then you sit there like a cow looking at a strange gate you got no idea what it means but you who are in Christ have put on Christ you are Abraham's seed and then HS according to the promise somebody say Amen turn around Shake somebody's hand say God bless you and you all may be seated this morning in the presence of God amen amen hallelujah yeah praise the Lord Hall now I am continuing on with the thought this morning but I want to title this uh sermon this morning the revelation of the son of man now now notice the Revelation okay the revelation of the son of man is going to produce something amen it produces position power and Perfection be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect if God requires that he must make a way for for that and I'm very pleased to be preaching on that this morning and I want to take a subject those baptized into Christ have put on Christ amen amen amen amen now I wish to get right into my sermon this morning because I got many things that I wish to share with you concerning position and adoption because I truly believe that we are living right now in the appointed time for the bride to catch this yeah the message didn't come to just teach you a church order that's right amen how to wear a dress how to have long hair all of those things no that's a part of it but to miss the understanding of why God sends a prophet God sends a prophet to bring you always back to the truth of God's absolute amen and so I believe that now the bride has come to a time of maturity she's matured she's no longer thinking as a young woman even as Sarah when the angel proclaimed to her that she's going to have a son it wasn't it wasn't immediate how how will this be and you understand at that immaturity she laughed and passed the promise for a season to Hagar yeah that's what happened and Abraham seed the right seed in the wrong woman Church brings forth an ishmail every time amen and you all know that ishmael's nature was a wild man you couldn't correct him there are ishmaelites alive today whom will not receive correction of the word of God that's why predestinated seed ordained seed yeah when they are corrected of God because a bastard child come on is without correction God does not waste his time on nonseed amen that's plain thank you Lord amen you understand that amen so if you've ever felt God to chastise you to chasen you to correct you you should just rejoice and see praise God if there's nothing else that proves to me I'm seed because if I wasn't seed he wouldn't waste his hallelujah amen amen now fruit ripens quickly at the top of the tree we know that we have had a restoration of the Bride tree amen and he says watch the fruit at the top of the tree ripens the most quick why because they catch the fullness of the Risen son are you understanding that here we are yes and and you know what in in in many ways I don't think it's fair because you know I've been in the presence of this message and in the sunlight of this message for 53 years it's taken me 53 years to ATT teain to a knowledge of where I'm at yeah thank you and yes it's greater than it was when I first came into it but you know what some of you young little Whipper Snappers that have just come into this you 11th Hour workers I got to be careful that I don't get an attitude amen come on can you imagine these young believers that just come into this yeah God begins to give give them an accelerated Revelation because knowing the time's short so he's just megadosing them Revelation Revelation and now these kids are just excuse me but the young ones that are just coming into this message guess what we can sit down we Fellowship yeah hey brother Ron I was reading the other day and it said this and this I'm going wow yeah yeah took me 53 years son and but thank God because you know what they're all coming to maturity they must the hour is short the devil has but a short time to try to do all that he can and and if he could he would deceive the very elect but we all know he can't do it you can try buddy but you can't why because the word of God is our absolute amen that's what Malachi 4 did was to bring you back to the faith of your fathers amen now I've got to launch into this this morning and I I've got a uh a bunch of quotes here the reason that I read to you these quotes is to not just give it to you for information no but to actually realize that these sermons that he preaches are declarations they from a sermon title alone he's declaring something hey what is this attraction on the mountain who do you say this is what shall I do with Jesus the Christ he identified Christ of all ages yes Christ revealed in his own word who is this mezc hey wow he's asking questions he's making declarations to help establish you so that you know chronologically where you're at and if you understand the continual unfolding of the word even to the prophet ET that God gives him so much Revelation he's there for a season and then God sends another portion of Revelation he says oh my and it just begins to unfold and to unfold that's why we must continue to unfold with it amen all right so Souls that are in prison now 1963 just going to read the highlighted portion God reflect him himself back in that that he became a man when he become Christ Jesus and he was God see God was in Christ amen that se lived in him reconciling the world to himself and through that perfect man each one of us imperfect that believe in God has accepted that how many of you say I accepted that AC becomes Hallelujah the Perfection of him whoa wait a second that is a powerful statement yes sir you mean to tell me that when I put on Christ when I am baptized into Christ by his spirit and uh I'm Abraham's seed and his Perfection becomes mine yeah wow our Perfection comes with our Oneness with God Amen being united together by way of the holy spirit's transformation that's what the holy spirit is doing amen giving you the mind of Christ amen yes sir and giving you Revelation so that you will know who you are because you can't take your position until you know who you are that's right and then you are positionally placed yes to receive power amen thank you Lord and the end result is perfection hallelujah thank you Lord You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet amen hallelujah amen I Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard thank you Lord neither has entered into the mind of man of the things that God has got prepared for his people somebody say Amen faith is the power of transformation it is the quickening power to transform these mortal bodies from the glory of the terrestrial to the glory of the celestial amen that's our journey upward guess what Satan's journey is downward he's going down that's right he don't like to hear it when he reminds you of your past remind him of his future Hallelujah okay Philippian church was being told by Paul they must press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ is that right that means it's higher it's upward and that's what they've got to try to strive for to enter into that listen if you're going to run the race run to win amen if you're going to fight fight to win amen now Revelation is the quickening power that opens your eyes of understanding to the word right the holy spirit is the Divine revealer of God's word without the Holy Spirit bringing to you Revelation it is a closed book amen sure now brother Brenham says this in testimony 1950 but God is in the people what makes them good marks the perfect man it's God in you that makes it perfect amen see be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect see be ye therefore perfect how can you be perfect yeah yeah I mean you know I stand here like that emoji we send each other how can we be perfect somebody do this yeah you're just like me hey wait a second how can I yeah so here we ask the question how can you be perfect not in yourself but in him Hallelujah GL prise the Lord God don't look at you then God don't look at you then he looks at him amen right amen see how do you get in him by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body then you're in him and when you're baptized by the holy spirit in the body it's 1 Corinthians 12 see how he brings this back to scripture takes these things how can we be perfect how can we so this Prophet begins to declare unto us the word of the Lord so that we might know who we are what is our position so that we might have power because power outside of character so what is God dealing with you right now character cuz power outside of character is satanic but Power with character is what F to rule fit to rule so now God is molding our character through the trials and the tribulations and the trying of your faith is worth to you more than precious gold amen hey I tell you what if you found a gold nugget somewhere as you're walking along the street or something like that you found a big old gold PE I guarantee you you would do a happy dance that's amen you'd say wow look what I found how much more so should the word of God when the trial you're in produces Christlike character and then you go wow now I know why God had me go through the trial some of The Darkest Hours of your life and the worst trials produce the greatest character and while you're in it you are sitting there why me why do I have to have this trial wo is me I never wanted to be job I didn't ask to be like job I don't want to be like job amen because scraping the boils on the as sheep is not what I think of oh good and yet God said have you considered my servant joob and yet job hey he looked at all of that stuff and all of it and his wife said why don't you curse God and die you speak like a foolish woman everybody's turning against him but guess what God never let me tell you it doesn't matter even your rotten attitude even if you know I didn't want to be I didn't ask for this why are you doing it but when it's all said and done when you come through the trial and God has has given you a trial by fire and all that which is impurities all of that which is wood haste double is all burned up and guess what God leaves is a residue of gold hallelujah thank you Lord for gold that's why he tells this last age I counsel of you to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich right amen Adam was a perfect man in a perfect Edom let me tell you he was actually the first female that lost his place because Adam was both say it m male and female made he them right so Adam a byproduct because God cannot fall right but he made a byproduct the first bypro God took a portion of himself and he called it Adam he said that's me in flesh form God knowing he would be the first of a byproduct of God knowing he would fall but it was all in God's plan I will redeem Adam Adam will redeem Eve it's all a type and a shadow watch God it's my whole plan unfolding amen hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah so now job was a perfect man the Bible says Noah and Abraham were perfect men but read their stories read the chapters of them and they all made their mistakes thank you Lord thank you Lord that they made mistakes because it gives me hope they were men of like uh passion huh on yeah because if they were without mistake How Could You attain to it they were just perfect in all their ways aimc says hey you know that woman she's pretty I'd like to have her Abraham tells s tell tell him you're my sister what you're going to give me a way to save your skin right huh so aimik says so you're who are you I'm I'm a I'm a sister huh he does not only does he do it but he does it twice and guess what Isaac does the same thing like father like son could you imagine the times after restore unto this man his wife and hey hey I didn't touch her yeah I I kept you from touching her you just laid there in your bed with your toes up and you took a bath oh tomorrow I'm going to take her he said I kept you let me tell you A lot of times you may think oh you've kept yourself oh I've been a good boy when I come through the Gates of Glory I'm going to have my head back I'm going to say open up ye gates because I was perfect in all my ways on wrong right you're going to say it was Grace it was Grace it was his Mercy it was Grace it was him wasn't nothing I did it was him yes sir absolutely okay so the Perfection that God's speaking about is not their conduct while they're here on Earth that's right but in their position in their calling very good for I want you to make your calling and your election sure sure that's right amen glory not just being called No but being elected thank you Lord okay Colossians 1: 27- 29 to whom God would make known what is the riches yes of the Glory of this mystery among the Gentiles yes which is Christ in you yes the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus thank you Lord where unto I also labor and you know what I'm laboring in that very same situation with you striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily what kind of power is working inside of you it is a mighty power that's right hey let me say this cuz Satan is a mighty power the Bible says he is a mighty power but God Is An Almighty power amen it is God who sanctifies you both Body Spirit and soul which will make you blameless if God has called you God will do it amen that's his business amen so we all ought to say I'm about my father's business yes sir Amen in 1 Thessalonians 5: 23 and 24 the very God of Peace sanctify you holy that doesn't mean h o l y holy that means complete that's right I want you to be Sanctified in all your ways I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ Faithful Is He that calleth you yeah who also will do it wait a second let's paraphrase that he that called you he's going to do it yep wonderful I feel like doing a little happy dance up here he's going to do it amen it ain't me Glory it's him you realize he that called me he's going to do it how is he going to do it it ain't to my works I'm a failure but he's not amen yeah amen all right thank you Lord so God's going to sanctify you holy Body Spirit Soul he's going to preserve you blameless and he will do it amen first Peter 5 are you liking this amen let's let's walk through the scriptures and let the scripture tell you your position yeah 1 Peter 5: 10-1 but the God of all Grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus that after you have suffered a while come on make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you hallelujah it's him going to do iten Amen to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen amen now let's talk about perfection for a while absolute perfection is an attribute of God Alone amen because he and he alone is perfect in all his ways that's right we are not we are born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies and if anybody needs help we do help [Applause] am you know what we should be crying out in desperation help I can't do it I've tried I've tried to be perfect yeah I tried to live according to the law because he who offends the least of these laws is guilty of all amen I'm I tell you what I'm going to walk perfect today I'm going to get up I'm going to walk I tell you and it ain't just a few steps out of your bed and you stub your toe and oh do you honey why did you and immediately that nice little Aura of I'm going to be good all day vanishes right right amen come on absolute perfection is an attribute of God Alone his Perfection then is the standard for all believers to attend to sure because it'll only be a perfect bride amen coming back by Perfect Faith Amen in a perfect Rapture into a perfect Eden into a perfect ion wow why cuz God is bringing everything back to let's say it together Perfection hallelujah thank you Lord I strive for something there's something inside of me that strives for something far greater than that which I have that's right yes I don't Glory as though I have already attained to it no I'm striving unto perfection all right so the goal and fundamental idea of perfection is for the believer to attain to by being complete in him amen thank you Lord that is the goal of every Spirit-filled believer is to be perfect in him now Perfection to the believer is the work of God himself that's right amen he does it it's not you amen I'm letting that sink in he is therefore Jehovah Gyra yes sir amen I'm the god that provides all your needs you need Perfection I got it amen thank you Lord you need healing I got it you need Redemption I got it huh Hallelujah listen when you were a kid did any of you worry about your dad if he's got enough money to put gas in the car did you worry about if you know hey if Dad was there he's got it come on dad pay for the meal we even got stuck my dad had a Jeep it was a two- wheel drive jeep station wagon and we went out just kind of riding through uh the desert we were just you know and we're there and we're were that and like this and we go over a couple little heels and all of a sudden and I felt the rear end slip down into [Music] some my brother he you know Dad Dad what are we going to do and I wanted to say ah shut up Dad's here he's got it he can handle anything I want to tell all of you this morning quit your whne dad's got it he's got everything under control that's the truth brother he loved you so much that while you were yet a sinner right Christ died for you not in your righteousness while you were a sinner Hallelujah he loved you despite yourself despite all of the things you would do wrong amen amen amen I'm living proof we must therefore agree with the scriptures that Christians may become perfect even while they were still in this Mortal body yes sir because he has to make that Perfection Christ has perfected us Forever by his blood in the spiritual man thank you Lord Hebrews 10:4 for by one offering has he perfected again this word Perfection keeps coming up yes he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified and amen amen by recognizing yet watch this that though God has made a way and we realize in this Mortal body which keeps making mistakes amen is there anybody real and human here this morning come on put down your Halo let's be real this morning and realize that all of us we make our mistakes amen amen yeah so thus not only Watch God's going to make a way but we have a hard time because we're still working it out right while we're here we make our mistakes and we get disappointed in ourselves but I want you to understand God is not expecting you in this Mortal body to attain Perfection why because the body you're in is imperfect it came by sex law not by Spoken Word guess what what is the last thing of our inheritance we're going to get before we're raptured out of here why because God ain't going to let a sinful body come into His presence I'm not stuck cuz you Tred to get into the kingdom and you ain't got the right robe that's right don't get in yeah you don't get in and guess what there was a man who came to the feast and they were Jesus is walking along all of a sudden you don't have your robe yeah where's your robe how did you get in right because everybody that came in by the door the door is Christ that's right they got a new Rob but this guy didn't have robe how did you get in here well I I climbed in some other way uh there was a window open and he was cast out where Into Darkness where there was wailing and now this loving God you better you better understand God is a fearful God and we must serve him with reverence and godly fear because our God is a consuming fire he's a god of wrath and of judgment we got him that it's all love and God's going to love everybody that's the Beatles what the world needs now you think they'd say what the world needs now his fiery judgment are you kidding me because they all want to be loved huh don't denominations all project God's love it don't matter the kind of life you live don't matter how you dress it don't matter the life you live it don't matter anything about you in fact you can just do what you want to cuz you know what you're going to be saved that's a lie of the [Applause] devil as many as I I love I rebuke and I chase and be zealous therefore and repent that's not taught in denomination amen or if they say well repent they might just have what uh what is that uh thing I'll give up for Lent huh Marty gr yeah man come on oh I'll go I'll get at Ash and cross and I'll act holy and stand before the priest hey come here put may you go and have a greater Marty grow next year and do all the Unholy things you want because I'm going to now forgive you and they feel secure do you know anybody have you ever seen anybody with the ashing cross on their forehead it's big over in Germany because Marty Gro is connected with it you know what Marty Gro is it's a party yeah man I took some brothers with me one time because in Germany in the area of crfi let me tell you there were all kinds of parties and Marty Gro going on and they had the costumes and and everybody and it's it it's just a big adulterous Affair so I had one I had brother Dave Cook fly over from Saskatchewan and I thought oh I want to take him to dinner okay uh let's cross the border into Holland because it's not so big over there as what it is in Germany and so we went and I wanted to take him to have Bobby punga in a in a restaurant that's my favorite meal if anybody knows besides the Hammonds that's my favorite meal Bobby pangang it's an Indonesian food and Chinese anyway I said I'm going to take Dave Cook and so we went to my favorite restaurant and we went in there and they had a band they had all the costumes and I thought oh Dave day I'm sorry he had kind of un I had no idea was going to be like this so Dave As Nice and cordially as is we sit down and we try to order you have to scream through the music your order and finally they bring it and finally we eat it I can't wait to get out of there everything so we get up to go and guess what the ladies that are singing and dancing they come over to Dave Cook stand up brother no I was going to dance with him but they grabbed a hold of Dave Cook big 360 lbs they grab him and start dancing and he dances her to the door thank you [Laughter] goodbye and you know what he said to me brother Dave Cook H it's amazing to see what the Believers in Europe do for Fellowship I said Dave this isn't what we do anyway maybe some of you would enjoy it but I now I want you to understand that the Bible declares that a man can become perfect only by his position in your union to Christ that is by a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost which is called the Seal of God brother Ram said you take all of my sermons the greatest of all sermons The Capstone of my Ministry I titled the sermon the token in the Old Testament Abraham was given a sign of circumcision in the New Testament it is called the baptism of the Holy Ghost being baptized into Christ you have put on Christ by being in Christ the Believers acquire a perfect position than you Lord wow I'm in him because Christ is identified in every age that's right in every generation understand that the message Believers in every age become the identified Christ of that age that anointing that was poured out in the time of Luther they came under that anointing and they became and acquired the position for that hour amen and and then God moves on he goes to Wesley and he goes on and on down to the age of laiaa until it is the darkest and the worst of all ages and yet God is still perfecting a bride Now understand he's not looking at you amen he's looking at the Christ in you thank therefore when God looks at you he doesn't see you he sees Christ brother Brenham gives the illustration he said when you pray and you have the token in your life which is the Life of Christ that is the Seal of God it is the blood being applied he said when you pray he says your voice goes through that blood right and it has an ability to exchange your voice for his wow and he says and now when you pray it's not your voice it's his just think of that wow God talking to God Amen our father Yes Who Art in Heaven amen do you see it was deity talking to deity amen all right Colossians 2 2 veres 8-15 all right let's hurry let's hurry somebody say hurry up okay all right Colossians 2 8-15 beware lested any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily ye are complete in him right thank you Lord which is the head of all principality and Power in whom ye also are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism wherein you also are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god wow what it's all him he's doing it the operation of God is he's doing it who raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him am amen wow having forgiven a few of your trespasses that may be in the new revised standard of the watering down Bibles they're putting out in fact they they have made the new Bibles genderless and another thing because they will not say our father they'll say the great being in heaven oh my they won't say male nor female why because they don't even know what they are that's right they have no identity but eled have identity brother Brenham said watch in this end time many of them he says she wears his clothes he wears her clothes she cuts her hair like a man and he wears his hair like a woman amen amen amen it's vice versa he said it's a spirit and it's getting worse they don't even know who they are they don't even know what gender how many genders do we have listen if you you would have asked that question 10 years ago you'd have been laughed silly oh I think there's five whatever are you kidding me huh there's only two boxes on the birth certificate he's either male or female but that was old time now you see they've gotten so far out see anyway let me go on we have been quickened together and have forgiven all our trespasses blotting out the handwritings of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way kneeling it to the Cross amen he took my place and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over there over them in it the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings a Believer into the position of the Perfection that is in Christ amen Galatians 3: 26-29 and ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ again think of this yeah there's neither Jew nor Greek Now understand when you're in Christ there's neither Bond nor free Jew nor Gentile male nor female wow look at this when you come into it for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and then if you be Christ then you're Abraham's seed and according to the promise now brother brand picks this up in the end time seed sign he says now what's happening I'm closing I might say this friends the church is coming forth God's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle and she's predestinated he's going to have a body without spot or wrinkle as God in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man so is god with his word coming again making himself manifest in a bride amen Amen brother brandom says in another quote this is the bride coming of Christ this is the restoration of the Bride tree amen but the unadulterated word of God will be born into that church and she'll stand like Jesus Christ did and with his Spirit anointing in in his word amen I believe it's the announcement now amen what was he what was he doing he was making the announcement do you know it actually the word message and he brought forth his message it means in an announcement amen within those seven mysterious Thunders which will be made known and brother Bram said it is those seven mysterious Thunders he said that to my opinion will cause rapturing Faith to the going away the BR somebody say Amen I'm not trying to trick you and when the seven seal mystery of the book was open God circumcised listen to this God circumcised this message from Clarence linen hops to Babylons prasan fathers brother Brenham put himself away into it locked himself into a room I'm not even going outside I'm waiting here and he says this first seal oh God I have no idea what it means so he says I went back and I started looking at my old notes oh who is this white horse rider writing down through it must be Christ and he says then supernaturally an angel amen I want you to understand the angel of the first seal he said it is not Jesus Christ it's the Antichrist I would have made a horrible mistake amen do you understand now what God is doing is he's circumcising this message away from all kinds of knowledge and teaching of man and church and all of the things down Through the Ages now what God is doing is he's taking away all of the humanity and carnal knowledge and men's thinking and interpretations and giving us Theus sayth the Lord can you say Amen to [Applause] that Hallelujah and now it becomes an unadulterated word of God even while he's doing questions and answers on the seals and he answers something wrong he says oh wait a second wait a second is everybody okay somebody feels sick what's wrong somebody said read the question again okay he goes back reads the oh my if that isn't God he said right here he wouldn't allow me to answer that incorrectly wow there's God watching over his word amen thank you Lord Revelations 19: 6 and 10 and and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters and the voice of Mighty thundering singing Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife ha made herself ready let me just put it back on you if you miss it it's because you failed to make ready don't blame the preacher don't blame anybody else if you miss it because the Bible says the Bride made herself ready amen and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto them blessed are they which are called unto the married supper of the lamb and he saith unto them these these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship Him the angel and he said see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy the bride will have the testimony she understands prophecy those um within the message that are preaching from the glare of another age are not preaching a Perfection ministry right right they're wanting you to go back he said go back Pentecost no wait a second we come through Pentecost brother R say I've heard a sermon where Pentecost failed how many of you heard it if you haven't heard it go back and listen listen to it why are we against organized religion come on why are we not a denomination he answered all these things amen he says you can't feed the bride of Christ Pentecostalism that's correct well brother Brenham are you against shouting no I believe in shouting are you against Dan no I'm not against dancing are you against all speaking no I'm not against speaking in tongues that's true uh he says but I've seen witches and wizards that's right and he preaches a sermon called the anointed ones at the end time and he says look don't judge them by their anointing he said but look for the fruit where does all of the shouting jumping dancing and hollering where does that get you if it's not based upon a word revelation to you it's just human emotion which you get an influenced by one another and you catch one another's spirit and when it's all said and done and the emotion leaves you where does it leave you I'll give you a quote he said defeated well I thought because the Pastor said Hallelujah if the Holy Spirit ever gets on you why you it'll be tongue talking asks 238 babies and the next thing you know you got a preconceived idea so are young people H I got to do that too why cuz he just gave me an example follow me I believe in dancing in the spirit but let it be the real holy spirit because of Revelation not because of the music because watch this I'm going to tell you most of the time when they dance it's only because of the music amen sir yeah watch when the at the end of the service and they changed the order and pretty soon right on it was the music and the next thing you know then all of the dancing and all of this brother Bram said now he's here now right it's the end of the service right true he could have got to hey come on up here sis get on that get on that piano and say when we all get to heaven when we all get to heaven D ding D Ding and what a day of rejoicing that will be ding ding ding right and get away hey I can show you AA Allen okay you can go AA Allen says praise God let's change the order of the service and he gets a black man up there to sing I'm getting my dancing shoes on I'm getting my dancing shoes on I believe everybody that's got a victory puts their dancing shoes on Amen and you know what most of the people follow that and I didn't see any of you dancing when I did why didn't you you're just watching me I'm not making fun of that I've dancing in the spirit before there is a dancing in the spirit there is a real joy of the Lord I have gotten in a car I was David McGary and I had been cutting pulpwood all day he failed the trees he cut them in 4ot sections I picked them up I stacked them in stacks and by the end of the day we smelled like Pine uh sap we got in the car we're all just dirty got got wood chips all over us man we get in his old opal Cadet which was a miracle in itself you had to pray to get that thing to start we're bouncing out of the woods man rough day one and yeah man well you you did The Cutting man I did the stacking so anyway we're we're going along you know what David says you know what brother Ron he says I I'm just sharing what he said and David doesn't mind me sharing it he said you know I got a I got a way about me either people like me or they hate me he said because I just say things I just have that nature you know he was out golfing with a couple of the brothers out here on a nice golf course he was getting ready ready to put and somebody went did you just spit onto the golf course why I tell you and just read this guy the riot act who cares who if I saw you guys do it I might spit with you but he says now he he he's just driving his car brother R just you know not everybody loves me he said but he loves me amen and I he said these words I don't know why he does but he did Hallelujah he didn't have to but he did and he kept saying it and when he did sister Anita the Holy Spirit came down in such a way says he did didn't have to right but he did and he starts weeping and the presence of God came so strong in that car how many of you believe you can say the right thing you can be somewhere and all of a sudden God is so pleased with what you said he couldn't control the car he pulls it off the side of the road we don't have to say anything we bust the doors out and he and I run like two crazy man in the woods praising and leeping and jumping and just about the time we go to get back in the car it comes on us again it wasn't in a meeting it was just in his presence I love his presence okay I want to go on I want to go on all right okay okay we may go into overtime Abraham could not produce the real seed within his own ability you agree he tried everything right and when his body was as good as dead and Sarah her body was dead also is that right so now it's impossible that's it Abraham could not produce the Royal seed in his own flesh Sarah's womb was as good as dead in their flesh it was not possible ible see and so God came down he said I'm Jehovah Gyra I'm going to come down don't you know who I am I'm Eli I'm MDC and so he comes down and gives them you're not your name is no longer Abram it's Abraham you are not Sarah you're Sarah and I have joined it's an invisible Union if you can understand he came down joined himself Hallelujah when he did Abraham it was in do it unto him for righteousness oh Lord and now God what did he do I'll bring it to pass Abraham I am the almighty God yes sir it's not you it's me Abraham right I've been waiting for you to just say I can't do it I'm finished and sometimes God Waits you for you you say I can sail my ship I it's okay I've been in storms like this before so he lets you sail your boat and he goes into the back hinder part of the ship and goes to sleep come on then we go wake him up takeing on water what's an amazing thing huh is they went and wake and says Master wake up don't you care we perish don't don't you love me isn't it amazing when we are in fear of our life that's when we make deals with God Let's Make a Deal God how many of you ever made a deal with god oh if you'll get me out of I tell you if I get that job if I get this house if I get that girlfriend I promise you soon as you get it forget it yeah it is okay now watch this in the sermon Perfection 1957 brother Jerry listen to this oh God requires Perfection and in him you are perfected forever think of it it's not nothing you do amen it's not new pages you turn it's not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that brings you to Perfection then you are perfected in Jesus Christ Hallelujah the only way you can make us perfect is to give us perfect Faith amen Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God so when you come to church you're you're asking God come show me what's wrong with my walk that my walk will be like that of Enoch and Enoch was not because God took him us come on wow God help me to walk with you Lord the third pole is a Perfection ministry that's why you can't tell everybody and and explain it don't you know that I told you you tried explaining the first and second pole and you got your line all tangled up and you caused carnal impersonations how many of you know he said that cause all these little Davids and everybody's got a hand got a sign in their hand and got all this Stu he said I cause that cuz I'm trying to teach Pentecostal babies right spiritual things now if you watch real close I shows them how to fish he said now don't get your line all tangled up this third poll you got to be real reverent he said now

deeper and some of you have not been going deep enough that's what Peter and him did they fished all night Hallelujah he says cast your net again this time Let It Go real deep wait a wait a while and before you start pulling it in let it go down and all of a sudden they start pulling it in and they feel like oh my and now they've got so many fish they fished all night and didn't get nothing sometimes God just needs to give you a word in season and you're ready to get the biggest haul you've ever had in your life am but he waits until you're done Peter are you done have you caught any fish no Lord we carried all night and I'm a fisherman I was raised on these Waters I know where they there ain't nothing he said no cast your net one more time but we we fish Peter cast your net you

what happens to you it's him amen I thought it was just some guy had a little fire on the beach and it was him sometimes God disguises himself and it's him he's telling you giving you a he's giving you a word in season if some of you when you are in these times when you have fished and you have done all and you have sought God for an answer for something in your life he's waiting for you to

about it this is Reverend this is Holy I don't want you to tell anybody about it huh now there's a major Doctrine going around in the message you get your Perfection by pressing play brother renom addresses that watch this you want to see the answer questions answers 1964 dearly beloved let's see about the scripture of Ephesians 4:11 through 13 let's see do we get all the perfecting of saints through the tapes or should we be here where the gifts of the Spirit are operating and different offices of the church to help perfect us our hearts have believed all the word of the Lord oh this

to light a candle you just press play and you are perfected while you sleep vast majority of them because there is no getting ready listening and under anticipation because Ephesians 4 says that God sent some Apostles some Prophets You Know evangelist pastors for the what perfecting of the Saints press play doesn't do that now if you ex if you exclude the rest of the four four out of the fivefold ministry you don't have everything you need to get you out of here because it's for the listen don't cut up the word don't take what you want amen and leave what you don't want perfecting belongs to the body of Christ amen in the UN unconditional Covenant with god with the people will you give me a couple more minutes but I am not what I I am who I am it's the Perfection of Jesus Christ in God

amen hallelujah you might even get happy yeah yeah like one sister told me went brother that word was coming so I almost said amen break the sound barrier once in a while Amen brother wrong that's nothing but the truth and then all of a sudden huh had he right that ain't nothing but the truth brother REM just telling a story that ain't nothing but the truth man I tell you what activate the faith that you have and what God is speaking to you that ain't nothing but the truth and watch what God will do I ask you I challenge you to put him to the test amen amen thank you Lord your Perfection is connected to your position in Christ I hope I'm making it clear amen all right perfect Faith 1963 this is coming into that third pole I'm believing it this is just starting to bloom now just started I did this for a purpose I did this for a purpose I'm working out something see it's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in see kind of raise faith in a bracket where you've never noticed it in that way before not a faith but a perfect Faith built it up here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart make a perfect Promise by his perfect word which is sharper than any two sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart we are coming now to the Perfection because the people has got to come to this in order for the Rapture amen amen that's what's holding it away it's waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured Faith amen looking for it it means a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you and together we'll make it by the grace of God and a Church of the Living God said amen amen hold on we'll make it brother Ben God ain't looking at you thank you Lord amen third pole is anointing on the bride to speak the word see the revealed word is moving her into her position right Israel and the church 1953 confirming his word that someday we who turn old and gray and 70 years old someday we'll spring back you're you're Johnny you're closer to 20 than you've ever been amen someday we'll spring back to a young man and young woman again but all that death can do is just take us away then it's finished then all the doubting part and everything it's like the man's life in here has gone out and there's nothing left but per Perfection than is that what he said Sergio are you reading that look at that what this body he was when it was in Perfection What God intended when it was it resurrection and Resurrection it'll be Perfection wow thank you Lord it's not just a mythical Dream It's thus sayith the Lord amen God said so then I'll base my life right there yes sir God said so that settles it forever see it settled in heaven Little Piece of Heaven is in your heart it ought to settle it right there amen you see the resurrection is the changing of these mortal bodies Amen brother B said by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we have the earnest he says but when do you get the fullness of your Redemption first resurrection what does he do first he changes and we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which sleep but we'll be all changed in a moment and he says how will it happen and I don't really know is it going to be like Star Trek beat me up Scotty I don't know all I know is you know what I will be Chang Myer I will be changed you will be changed yes praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah he's going to change these vile mortal bodies the one that gives you problem every day yeah on yeah and then only when you have a body likened unto his glorious body and you shall know him as he has known and then you'll walk into the presence of God cuz God will not let sin come into His presence amen that's why we've got to drop these old Mortal bodies brother Ram says it's an old cockle bir nature huh I'm reminded of it every day especially on the freeway tra yeah traffic and this guy cuts me off and you know I want everybody to buy the rules when they don't go by the rules and somebody cuts me up be be a if I had the power that's why you didn't get the power cuz you would abuse it there'd be piles all over I 17 there brother Ron's on the road again I have to I have to make us laugh at our own nature because there are certain things now if you're if you're like my wife you can be cut off people can do all this stuff and she raised her hand God bless you she's an overcomer when she drives I'm an undergoer so if you're like her she she never honks at nobody yeah okay go ahead bless her heart and I I I always say I'll never use her in a sermon [Laughter] again I think my daughter Rebecca sent to Sandy a little note and it says if you are born into a pastor's family or a preacher's family you must keep quiet because everything you have said and acted upon can and will be used in a sermon so we expose our kids okay I'll tell you what I promise never my three kids I'll never say no I'll just talk about your kids would that make it better you'd say oh God for B yeah so anyway I'm sorry to my family Perfection does not mean you are not going to make mistakes let me alleviate that pressure from you doesn't mean you're not going to make mistakes come on perfected is not a physical character but a spiritual position amen your Perfection is not based upon your works but hisen James 1: 3-5 musicians if you will come I am closing James 1 3-5 knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience and let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire Hallelujah wanting and lacking nothing wow and if any of you lack Wisdom ask God this Perfection is not about you or whether you are good enough it's about whether he's good enough I have a mediator I have an advocate that when I do wrong guess what he is my attorney and he stands before the judge right I have a mediator and when I've done wrong and I do wrong guess what I have an attorney and he says your honor according to Acts 2 and 38 and let me remind you your honor and he just begins to now lay it all out there and then your attorne attorney as he gets done and he gets done as your attorney pleading the case he very quickly elas he comes up here he changes puts on the white white hair of the wig case this amen hallelujah you have proved yes The Advocate the medior the pericos he's right Lord and now I say case dismissed and then how is it oh jury what do you think of this case and so the judge quickly changes his hair he stands he goes over and he becomes juror number one case dismissed jury number two changes this MTH case dismissed do you see what I'm saying it's all him amen it is all him thank you Lord let me ask you who can lay any of sin the charge of God's [Music] elect you mean to tell me that that blood is so powerful Hallelujah wonderful Hallelujah that he absolutely [Music] washed all your sins away put into the sea of his forgetfulness many of you I want you to understand that when you ask God to forgive you and you put it under the blood it's into the sea of his forgetfulness and not even God can pull it up and yet you say the very next day after asking God to forgive you he says For What come on well yeah but yesterday you didn't do anything wrong yesterday I I looked on the book is it not there in the sermon l Grace I hope you see it it isn't whether you're good enough to be a Christian or not it's whether he was good enough right if God accepted him and his blood makes an atonement God don't see [Music] you he sees the lamb see that was me William brandham no good not not fit to live worthy to go to hell born in a sinful family raised a sinner not good at all not one sound sound part about me that's right but one day accepted Hallelujah when God looked down on Christ and Christ Hallelujah took my place then God don't see me he sees the perfect one so as long as I'm here in him then I am perfected not in myself in him not my perfection I don't have any you don't have any but it's his Perfection somebody give him praise this [Music] morning this morning the holy spirit this is in the lamp's Book of Life Through the word bringing you the good news that from before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life all the Devils of Hell cannot erase it out there God wrote it spoke it just as sure to happen as God wrote it in there before the foundation of the world Amen then ye be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how can you be when it's not my perfection it's not your Perfection it's his Perfection of his word he chose you yes yes you never chose
