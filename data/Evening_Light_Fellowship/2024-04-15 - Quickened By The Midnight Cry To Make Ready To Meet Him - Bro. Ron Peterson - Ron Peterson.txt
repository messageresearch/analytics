unto him amen uh brother Robert didn't say I was going to have to follow Brother s that kind of a song so do the best I can this is a um song I've just kind of had out of my heart for a while it's a song that I think um brother Robert said uh that David wrote Psalms and that he put into songs and I can imagine this might have been a song that he uh that he wrote when he was feeling a little bit distant from God and it's my prayer this this [Music] morning just the time I I feel that I've been caught in the M of self just the time I feel my mind's been bought by worldly [Music] wealth that's when the breeze begins to blow I I know the spirit call and all my worldly wonderings just melt into his love and oh I want to know you more deep within my soul I want to know you oh oh I want to know you to feel your heart and know your mind looking in your eyes stirs up within me cries that say I want to know you oh I want to know you more and when my daily Deeds ordinarily lose life and song My Heart begins to bleed sensitivity to him is gone I've run the race but set my own pace and face a shattered soul but the gentle Arms of Jesus War my hungering to behold and oh I want to know you more deep within my soul I want to know you oh I want to know you to feel your heart and know your mind looking in your eyes stirs up within me cries that say I want to know you oh I want to know you and I would give my final breath to know you in your death and Resurrection oh I want to know you more oh I want to know you more oh I want to know you [Applause] more beautiful what wonderful words those are may that be our prayer every SLE one of us here in this assembly and every streamer we want to know you more can you say amen amen let's stand this morning we get ready to change over the service

I am you're a part of the I am of God Amen certainly had a refreshing time during our anniversary meetings amen amen yes and of all of you that are spiritual and understand the leadership of the Holy Spirit when other gifts come in and part of the ministry what they do is they substantiate what you have already been hearing am absolutely there's so many things you say oh yeah we just heard that we this this because there is a channel that the holy spirit is using to anoint on his bride around the world Amen does it matter what country amen doesn't matter what language amen but there is an anointing of the Holy Spirit that's upon the bright yes she's catching it yes she sure is hallelujah she can't help but catch it that's right thank you Lord amen um we know that the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy let us bow our heads for just a moment father God once again we have come into thy house Lord to learn of you yes I pray father that you would open our eyes of understanding father and let us take this book and eat it and become a part of it that we would become a living epistle in this last day that our voice would be Blended together as a sound of many Waters joining with the voices of those down Through the Ages that caught the revelation of the spirit for the day in which they lived I pray oh heavenly father that you will come and anoint the speaker and the hearer each one father may we be sensitized to your Holy Spirit anoint the word to our understanding now I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you all let's just remain standing thank you musicians amen we're going to go to three scriptures this morning uh let's go to Matthew chap 25 vers 1-10 then we'll go to Luke 12 and then we'll go to Revelation 19 amen certainly enjoyed the song specials amen I believe that when you have the victory of Christ in your life doesn't mean you won't go through trials doesn't mean that you won't be tested but it means that you will be an overcomer not an undergoer yeah too much of the time I'm undergoing this I'm undergoing that well the scriptures says to he that hath an ear let him hear and those in each age became the Overcomers so that's your destiny to overcome laiaa to overcome all of the things that come against you amen because we've been made more than conquerors through Christ somebody say through Christ who strengthens us amen Matthew 25 verses 1-10 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom teed they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps notice the cry woke all of them up F uh five wise five foolish yes so there is a quickening that's happened in this our day that's caused us to realize he's coming get ready yeah amen watch this now and the fully said unto the wise excuse let's go back verse 7 then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foi said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered and saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut I want you to notice verse 10 as we read it again and while they went to BU the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marage marage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily Ascend to you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour where the son of man cometh amen turn with me now to the Book of Luke 12: 39 and I gave the Brethren 39 through 40 but I'm going to read to 43 be therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when you think not then Peter said unto him Lord speakest thou this Parable unto us or even to all the Lord said who then is that faithful and wise Steward whom he whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing amen notice the theme that you see that is going to tie all of this together this morning is therefore be ready amen amen turn with me the Book of Revelation chapter 19 Book of Revelation 19 and we will read down to verse 10 starting at verse 5 and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thunderings saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready amen notice that word ready again are you ready amen and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints amen and he said saith unto me right blessed are they which are called un the married supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God Amen and it says and I fell at his feet to worship him and said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God am for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy may God bless the reading of his word this morning you may be seated in his presence amen thank you I'd like to take for a short time this morning just want to be sensitized and led of the Holy Spirit and I want to speak on a the title of quickened by by the Midnight Cry to make ready to meet him now what is this message all about come on brother us is about how to go to church how to dress I'm afraid that's sometimes what we've boiled it down to amen and I take a subject this morning is revelation makes preparation that's right tell me you believe this message tell me you have Revelation let me see it manifested in your life because Revelation is Vision it's seeing yes now we do not want to be a Pharisee of Pharisees concerning the law blam us we don't want to be like Saul of Tarsus who had a religious spirit about him and he was persecuting even the Church of God but on the road to Damas us there that elect seed God got a hold of him knocked him off his high horse and into the dust where he belongs and he said Lord who art thou he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest isn't it hard to kick against the Pricks and here it was that God had to Blind him physically to open his eyes of understanding that's right amen and what's an amazing thing is that channel of the Holy spirit that he got into he went and and spent a couple years off in seeking the mind of God when he came out he and the disciples are speaking the same thing how many of you believe that God has got a channel that he wants all of you to get into now I'm going to substantiate some of this of what we have taken as a title and in the sermon the sudden secret going away the church brother Brenham says some people say well I go to church this Sunday I listen to our pastor which is a fine preacher that's good I appreciate that in you or America the world whatever it is but it takes more than a good message from the pulpit it takes your life it takes you to get ready that's right in Revelations the 19th Chapter 7th verse the Bible said that speaking of the bride of Christ she hath made herself ready she made herself ready and you as a member of this bride you've got to make yourself ready if you miss it and you fail to prepare and get ready there's only one to blame your pastor huh the preacher come on brother how about the prophet if you miss it it's because of your own foolishness now I as a pastor want to make everyone within the assembly from foolish to wise but I realize we can't do it and your life right now testifies of which direction you're going show me who you fellowship with show me what you do and I'll show you the direction you're going amen foolish love to hang around foolish and wise love to hang around those that are wise amen why because the wise have something in common they love to talk about one thing that's the word yes amen not the world not the things of the world because listen if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not even in you in the uniting time and sign brother Brenham picks this up again like the wise men coming down from Babylon they screamed where is he born King of the Jews he's on Earth right now we've got to find him that's right and I believe he's so close to coming coming that I can say behold the bridegroom coming I hear the Midnight Cry how many of you can say I can say I've heard that Midnight Cry hallelujah we're right at the time of the end oh my the hour we're living in what a day what a time we're living in this great mystery of God being finished bringing in the godhead showing what it is and those little isms and went off and made him this and somebody made him this and somebody made him that but the angel of the Lord come down and brought up all their isms and put all that truth out of it and presented it and there it is just as perfect as it can be no other way you could go there it is that's what he is see he's a serpent seed all these different things that's been so mysteriously amongst the people see what is it see he had this is the sign to what unite amen this message has came come to unite you with the bridegroom not to just introduce you but to actually unite to cause an invisible Union amen I've been studying and sometimes I think studying hath made me mad I think everybody ought to see what I see am I remember my Damascus experience and let me just tell you personally yes I came into the message 1971 over in California Surfer not knowing much of nothing we came in listening to the tapes God began to open our eyes and every time we listened to a tape it was another chunk of the world just being taken off of each one of us and we were so sincere you need to be sincere when you come to church and you ask God Amen and so then it wound up we were up in Flagstaff we were there I was a deacon that's where I became an ordained minister long story short I found out that we talked about the message but never really preached it you can refer to it sure and there was a time when you used to say and God sent a prophet Revelations 10:7 yeah Revelation 107 belt buckles fact we got a whole new generation it's got a new belt buckle I think it who is it Austin Johnson have are you wearing yours this morning he he he had one custom designed well it's not your bell book I'm not making fun of it in fact he can make me one of those if he wants but what I'm saying it's not the Bell Buckle makes you a Believer neither is it a sign on your bumper nor is it the amount of books that you have in your library or the amount of tapes that you listen to brother Brenham said that little washer woman with one tape can make it because what she will do she lines up to the word what she hears hallelujah how many of you say I want to line up amen hallelujah help us Lord to do that which is right and it was when I went overseas now back when voice of God started sending out those little boxes of tapes cuz we couldn't afford to get a complete Library so they used to send you a box of tapes any of you were on that tape list where you got a box of tapes and you didn't get more until you paid those off then they sent you another one well we were getting our collection of tapes and listening to it and and everything but anyway our pastor asked me he said Brother Juan would you like to go over we're considering opening a spoken word office in Europe to get out the books and different things of the Prophet it wound up that we went over there and then it after a year and a half it changed from spoken word Publications to voice of God and so here's what happened you put me into an office and give me ,200 tapes surround me with the books and the work that I was doing of people writing a letter please send me tapes and send me these books and etc etc and while I was working I'd put tapes on and I listen to them in chronological order wow wow I was like a kid in a candy store amen oh look at this oh man I've never heard heard of this sermon oh wow I just put it on and listening to tape so I want you to know that that was my demascus experience and God opened my eyes of understanding and pretty soon when you see the revealing of the son of man you go beyond looking at the first and second pool oh that was wonderful the signs and the discernments Oh how we we we love that but that was only to get the attraction because there was a great G attraction that was behind all that because many of those that that love the signs and the Wonders the fishes the loaves the healings and everything where are they today many of them did not go on into the revealing of the son of man some of them just stayed right there and got high sitter amen and there in a little office the name of our village was Caren Caren alar that's not German that's Dutch otherwise it'd be kiria alter kiria but we were from a village that during the second world war or just before it it split up into two Villages church and old church Caren means Church Al and no so anyway we were from the old church I like that so here we were in car and Alder and we had an office for spoken word and then later voice of God but it was there saints of God that my eyes became open oh I've been in the message I've been rejoicing about it I was a deacon we went to church I've been fanatical about this message and going to church ever since I came into it I'm still that way amen God thank you Lord amen and when I came over to visit in America and I started preaching some of even the elders within the message we're talking icon ministers said well that's what's wrong with you young preachers you always talking about revelation God Revelation this Revelation that and I said well what do you preach from because if it's not Revelation see to he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit because the spirit is trying to get something over to you more than going to church more than how to dress more to not cut your hair and wear makeup and all that stuff those are some of the basics but God wants to pull you into the place where you have a solid rock foundation and Upon This Rock of Revelation I will build my church it's got to be revealed not what some man teaches you not the Creeds and the dogmas and rules and regulations that's a part of it but if we stop there then our children become conformed and not transformed and our people become churchi oh I love to have brother Salas you're talking about a devil chasing gospel am that when Revelation strikes you let me tell you the devil will fear and Quake when you get out of bed amen amen oh there he is he's getting out of bed run right now while you can cuz he's liable to cut your head off amen Revelation does that thank you Lord and Saul when God opened his eyes of understanding he said all of my former learning is D do you understand understand that am and he began to catch the revelation of what God was doing in that hour he began to to understand recognizing your day and its message how many of you right understand that it is a revelation about your day and your message amen that's part of the mystery that's being finished because you're a part of that in a mystery that's right so therefore even when you didn't know you were a part of it guess what God did he calls you thank you Jesus am and he starts now revealing himself to you line upon line precept upon precept and he does it not all at once cuz you couldn't handle it so what happens is you get upgrades praise the Lord that's what happens yeah uh happens to your computer if it's under the signal if it's under the footprint if it's under the cloud and all of a sudden you go to look at your computer and said oh hey you just had an upgrade yeah you're now with Windows 2.0 or whatever right yeah okay great do you know that when you come to church and you sit here under the cloud on come on and you're under the inspiration you sitting right there automatically get an upgrade that's why going to church is very important yes sir amen though you may not know it something's downloading like that and put on your hard drive because the Holy Spirit listen to me now the holy spirit is to lead and guide you into all truth and bring to youre remembrance those things which you've heard before if it's not on your hard drive you sit there like a cow looking at a new gate you have no idea what they're talking about but when the Holy Spirit comes and anoints something you have already heard all of a sudden my goodness it's one of those aha [Applause] moments Upon This Rock I'll build my church amen every one of you have got to have the type of experiences amen amen cu the message is Christ abolutely and the testimony of Christ is the spirit of Prophecy amen that's why without the spirit you miss it yeah that's right oh you can start to learn its dogmas its Creeds it's Traditions yeah and you conform to it that's why you can preach a conforming gospel for years and people conform to it right yeah and by the pressure of the ministry I'll tell you what sister you put on that uh uh immoral dress and on on you cut your hair you wear that makeup Jezebel D and all this amen and pretty soon everybody con Ms cuz they're afraid yeah exactly amen God doesn't control You by fear is it because of law or because of love he said if you love me you keep my commandment you start working on falling more in love with him and guess what it's not the law it's because I'm in love you guys don't understand I do this not not because somebody puts a gun to me not because somebody is holding a leash tight to me nobody tells me I got to get up Sunday morning and go to church I want to go to church why because God is in me Amen brother prise the Lord so when I came back from Europe and came over here I was kind of like whoa you young men that's what's wrong with you is everything's Revelation and it really it it it put a damper on me I thought wow am I I'm missing it these guys they've been around you know these are these are great men and I even question myself well maybe I am a little crazy amen praise the Lord I'll admit to you I've been fanatical about this [Music] message since I came into it I don't look for excuses on why to miss church huh how many of you know that God the scriptures talks about a parable there was a king who had a feast and invited those to a wedding that's right and to the supper y yeah and one by one they begin to make excuse right well I um I'm going to get married what's you going to let your marriage keep you out of the Kingdom wow well um I bought some cows you going to let your business I'm I I I'm expanding my barn what's your excuse I've been a fanatic for this message it used to be hey up in Flag we was a hunting Church yeah everybody would got bit up there in flab by the hunting bud but I was just fanatical enough that I would not leave Friday night after work to go hunting most of the time the vast majority of the time I left Sunday after service I get up there late and everybody El several of Brothers got their tents and everything here I come in driving at night got to turn on the lights and thank the Lord those Brothers help me put up my tent in the dark and then guess what Monday through Friday we hunted or through Saturday because you know what I got to provide for my family yeah man I got to get I'm a meat Hunter I'm a I'mma shoot anything that moves I'm putting meat on my table oh my after I spent $1,200 for a new rifle after I got new boots had to put a camper shell on my truck had to get a tent you know and so by the time you add up the total of what it cost me to go get that meat I could have gone to Costco and filled my freezer for a year I ain't got to go out there and then guess what I uh every day hunting getting up early before man walk your legs off I remember we saw some deer we're at kyab North kab wow and they got all these little um tributaries and and and whatever you call them so here's this little Hill and comes out here and goes down then you got a valley you got another one over here Hills and Valleys and everything we were out there hunting and brother Mitch Buckingham he was with us and he saw a big old Buck Hey listen if you don't get Buck Fever when you hunt then you shouldn't hunt it just get you so excited so he saw this big bug big fourpoint buck and he was down in the valley Mitch was up here on the top and he runs down here trying to get to him as quick as he can well the deer saw him heard him like this so the deer he runs up the to the top of the hill on the other side and and Mitch sees him okay I'm going to so he breaks and runs out so the guy trots off over the top and guess what when he gets to the top Mitch is thing's not very far from me he's going and then he drops off into it well he keeps doing this never did get the but you see a lot of times we spend all this time that's energy w here let me tell you hunting is not financially beneficial it's going to cost you a lot you can say well I'm bringing home meat no go to Costco you can bring home all the meat you want but if you do like to hunt and everything well then go for it just go hunting that's fine but give God what is God's amen and I would leave Saturday to drive all the way home six hours or so to be in church for Sunday and after Sunday I drive back now some of the Brethren I'm not I'm not riging on somebody's parade that well we're going to stay there for the weekend and it's too far to drive back home I know you're not fanatical you're not uh a heresy like I am I don't expect you all to be that way but I am I love this message with a ferency amen I don't try to find an excuse of why or to go some somewhere else or whatever I put Priority on the word of God because saints of God ever since I came into this message I realized I've got to be focused huh I got a fouryear scholarship to San Diego State University I went my first year I got a 3.83 grade point average I loved College I loved the university I I went to to to lunch with my professors you got to be kidding me I enjoyed it high school was a bunch of Misfits people that didn't want to be there they had to take your name and uh Ron Peterson are you here yeah John do are you here yeah yeah yeah here presid and in colleagues they don't do I could care less you guys pay to come here so I I wound up I turned on in college I enjoyed it wasn't not a problem for me but then I found out I was going in a wrong direction I came to this message the Way Up Is Down amen and a tree of knowledge and all of well my and how do you think my parents felt when I told them after my first year of college that I'm quitting I'm going to become a Christian yeah we're all Christians cuz we're born in America oh yeah America is a Christian Nation praise God we're all Christians that makes about as much sense as saying I slept in the garage makes you a car in fact America is no longer it's a secular nation and Christians are going to become persecuted cuz watch what they're doing against with the anti-Semitism that they're doing against Israel remember that the foolish virgin is going to be a hunted down persecuted little group how many know that and they have to give their lives we don't want to be here during the tribulation no God help me Lord Brother Brenham told Billy Paul Billy whatever you do you make the Rapture and don't you yeah he said you miss that tribulation yeah okay amen amen so I began to look at the message and everything and really if you boil it on all down to one thing I want to ask you what is the message all about and I will end my sermon with the two quotes that I want to show you but I just I'm going to throw this out there to you God sent an angel messenger yes who was visited by a Heavenly Angel to preach a message to get a bride [Music] ready so the message has one intent and purpose to get you ready so that you can get out of here amen now yes you got to have a job you got to have a house Jesus said your heavenly father knows you have need of all these things but seek ye first me say first first see the priority seek first the kingdom of God cuz he knows you have need of these things but he said doesn't he provide even for the Little Sparrow amen amen how much more so will your heavenly father pre come on okay so I thank God that he opened my eyes of understanding that when we came into this message I began to see a picture unfold I said my Bible days are here again Abraham mzc signs in the heavens signs on earth a prophet Speaking In The Name Of The Lord thus sayith the Lord my I began to see Elijah Mount Carmel I began to see Jezebel religion I want to ask you denominational Spirit comes from Jezebel that's organization denominational Spirit and the Bible says all those whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall be deceived you know what deceptions going on right now listen people don't even know what gender they're of they they can believe they're a cat or a dog whatever somebody asked me the other day well what do you identify as I said a Believer and I'm correct and I identify as correct you don't like it you better accept me because I want you to say I am correct a that what everybody's wants is that self-acceptance hey so you can say brother Ron you're correct you're right nobody said it Robert see I don't need that personal affirmation for you to say it I believe it I believe it now in is this the sign of the end sir what are these what are these sermons all about you take the sermon title alone and in itself is a sermon and when he asks you a question s is this the sign of the end what's the sign and when is the end what is this attraction who do you say this is do you see he he begins to now cause you to come into a greater spiritual understanding here we were just a bunch of surfers and rock and roll music and drugs and all this stuff and man let me tell you when when God begin to open our eyes every tape another Revelation another tape another Revelation and I can say it's still happening thank you I try to listen to a tape every day yes I do I have to seek the mind of God I don't do this because I'm a pastor I did it when I was sitting on the Pew amen amen you've got to seek wisdom from God so brother Ram says here s is this the sign of the end because it's given to you his disciples it's given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but not to them to them it is not given and the Mysteries here are watch this a mystery in scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which a supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation let me expound on that for a moment owning a Bible doesn't mean you catch everything that's revealed in the word otherwise everybody with the Bible that could read that had any kind of Common Sense would have to agree and understand the scriptures but it's a sealed book it's only to the elected would God do that purposely absolutely blind some to Open Eyes of others amen he reveal it to you who are you you ever had somebody tell you who do you think you are yeah you think you're holier than I am you think because you wear a long dress or this that or because you go to church and that that you're more holy than denominations they believe in Jesus haven't you ever had somebody say well what makes you so special special you got time for me to tell you how special I am I'm called predestinated elected chosen Justified glorified I've been anointed to receive this message I have been predestinated or ordained it was God that knew me before the foundation of the world and I didn't know nothing I came down here with spiritual Amnesia didn't know nothing long-haired Misfit but when God begin to open to me my eyes of understanding of this message everything came into a priority Rapture or bust no second place first place amen if you run run to gain the prize if you fight yeah fight to win not as one who just beats the air right huh thank having all the books and Tes doesn't mean you're going to catch the revelation of the hour you must have the Holy Spirit in your life let me tell how special Revelation is to you it is so special that God does not allow no preacher no Prophet no Pope no anyone else no Elder to give you Revelation they can preach they can expound on the word of God but God Alone Peter who do you say that I am Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God blessed art thou Simon Bor Jonah Flesh and Blood didn't give this to you but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock Hallelujah am what makes the foolish foolish what makes a Wise Wise I cannot I think the thing that frustrates me the most is I really get down upon myself because I think if I preach it good enough the foolish will become wise so I'm thinking if I preach it good enough and with enough anointing and this and that that I will open their eyes I got nothing to do with foolish virgin will always be foolish that's right she's virgin she's going to be there she's going to be saved amen she's going to have eternal life she's going to be in heaven she's not a part of the Bride she's not going to be in the New Jerusalem they're going to be outside the gates thousands upon thousands of people they will have eternal life what why because they were born again they asked Christ to come into their life but there's very few that went on to adoption amen though he be born an heir to All Things there's an a time appointed of the father when God watches your life God watches your life and he looks on how you live according to that which he show on you so your life right now Bears witness of which group you're in amen you judge yourself that's true you judge yourself so I'm not here to tell you well you're foolish you're the no you look at your life what have you been doing who you hang around with come on or you become Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band huh you hang around a bunch of losers you hang around losers you're a loser come on now listen on anything in the world in order for you to get better yeah when you learn tennis do you play those that you can beat every time you kidding me yeah come here man yeah hit the ball and they yeah man you know I won five sets in a row they couldn't even return the ball oh yeah man you you feel good about that you want to learn to get good at tennis soccer baseball football accounting engineering you better get around somebody that's better than you right it's going to make you hustle yes sir oh you think you you think you're good huh yeah I remember in Flagstaff where I first learned to play racketball and I love racket ball I love the fast sport of it four wall indoor racket ball and we had a uh a young man at the Athletic Club there who was semipro and they had the female world's champion come to do an exhibition so this guy's name is Tony so this guy was good nobody in the club could beat him nobody could get near this guy and and so you know I remember we we had he had a glass court and we were at the back and there was some upstairs and he could watch this and we're all crowded around and so Tony he's up here and he's going to take the serve the female huh she's going to receive from him so man he's so good at his like this and and she just does a backhand now I tell you what her backend was so good she did this she came from well out pow sound like a shotgun shell about that far off the ground hit the front wall dribbled off luck shot luck shot come on Tony well anyway she made him look so foolish you understand sometimes you can be the semipro at the club man you be everybody but when you got somebody that's good like somebody that plays rocketball or what do you call pickle ball huh we got some guys in this in this church that are good oh you play uh pickle ball yeah yeah so good grief what you tell me you're semipro when it comes I should have known there are certain telltale signs that some people are good he he's got this backpack with about 50 paddles in the back he's been you got be Kidd me yeah okay come on man anyway you're going to get better hang around people that do better than you right come on now natural type of the spiritual I don't care what it is if you're going to get better get around those that overcome amen amen all right all right I'm going to skip a few things here CU I just feel to to come to a point here 1 Peter 4 verse 17-8 the time is come the Judgment must begin at the house of God Amen yeah and if it first begins at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God Amen and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear how many know that this is a house of judgment let me fast forward for just a second and tell you it's the only judgment the bride sees and it's self judgment right amen she judges herself because this is where judgment begins so when we come to church we don't come here to just be uh told hey you're predestinated you're elected uh no devil in hell can Hey listen let me tell you I don't know about you but I face a very Fierce adversary oh yes absolutely and if you think that every day and every time that you're going to uh uh you're going to see his tactics and you're never going to fall for any kind of a trick and you're never going to get blindsided you better wake up because there's a real devil and he's out there and in the sermon the contest brother R said you better study how he fights amen that's right amen because I you can tell the people as an example you can defeat him any time any place anywhere hallelujah amen I claim the token amen and everything like that then you go out here the next day and you ain't feeling so anointed and then you slip and fall then where you at cuz you going just by feelings listen I'm here to tell you God is weaning you away from feelings do you see it taste it smell it feel it hear it no yes amen Faith cometh by hearing but it's a greater ear than this because many have ears to hear and they hear not many have eyes to see but they see not but blessed are your ears blessed are your eyes why because the spirit is trying to bring something over to you so you can live a life that overcomes the enemy you will fa him absolutely you will face him in the sermon seven Church ages 54 judgment begins at the house of God by the word of God yeah amen not a textbook but the Bible yeah not some church teaches in their theology but what God says then you'll have a Revival where great powers and wonders and signs and miracles and everything else takes place see you put the word first not the signs the Wonders and because you jumped because you shouted because no that's what Pentecost did they put the emotion be before the word because if you listen to Pentecostal go back and listen to anything called Pentecostal and you will find out they're saying hallelujah right and they're getting the people all excited because of some anointing well the anointings will fool you and they leave you look at Elijah 450 false prophets he kills a mount caral then he runs towards Jezebel I'm going to tell her I'm going to preach to her sermon she going to repent he gets there before Jezebel tells him hey you know what happened the he false prophet cut their heads off and I tell you Jezebel you better because the Bible says he gave her a space to repent and she said I tell you what Elijah what you did to my prophets I'm going to do to you what did he do well I'm going to run run run run run being chased by Jezebel you got to be kidding me here's here's here's Rambo onean Army here's God's prophet and he's running before Jezebel and now he runs cuz brother Bram said watch when you're not under the anointing be careful how many of you know you have really good Services Hallelujah real good victories the next day or on your way home yeah yeah huh yeah the kids say something the wife says something the dog bites you at the door something and so easy to lose cuz the devil's going to try to take away what you claim you got that's why you got to know spiritual warfare that's right up listen your Bell's going to get wrong once in a while and you see a good boxer if he knows how to fight and boom all of a sudden he got it on the chin you know what he does he covers up he gets back into the ropes and he uses this and the guy's beating on him like this and he's covering up and he what's he doing he's getting his air again he's getting his head cleared he covers up let me tell you there are times when you're going to get brother Brown said the devil's got a good shot coming at at you and you better keep it covered up then after cover up now all of a sudden you see and then dance a little bit and then amen yeah look I'm just going to confess I saw Rocky when it first came out da da I tell you what man the you know in the fight Harry is getting beaten I thought come on Rocky you can do looks like he's done for looks like he's done for and then all a sudden come on come on yeah go Rocky go get him man I came

talk about pumped I never been pumped in my life and here I was ah this is great I can't wait for a couple days we can go again I woke up the next morning I couldn't I couldn't scratch my head and I was so weak and sore let me tell you it's not how much you can try to Mega cram in one time it's repetition it's coming to church Wednesday and Sunday and Wednesday and Sunday it's not mega dosing on Friday Saturday Sunday and come to meetings and get all pumped up Time After Time repetition repetition and not using too much that you struggle give me reps give me 10 reps of 40 lbs what too easy yeah well by the time you're then pretty soon you watch your guy you go he's not using his arms judgment begins church is a judgment seat you know that it's God's threshing FL amen yeah you come here to get beaten to be threshed around a little bit you don't need this you don't need that you've been listening to that you watch the Cong start flinching good grief man just tell me I'm [Laughter] elected you see it's too easy everybody you know we we just want to say we're elected were that predestin yes yes yes all of the above but you still going to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling I want all of you to manifest revelation in your life amen that it has an effect upon you amen amen thank you Lord Brother Braham said speak to The Rock Church is the Judgment seat where Heaven is the great judgment seat of God I don't see why so many complain why I speak too hard and try to make people straighten up and tell them the way they're living the way they're dressing tell me I'm hurting my Ministry then judgment seat is the house of God that's right here's where it begins at right here where Justice and righteousness and Judgment of God is to go forth from the pulpit amen amen House of God is a judgment seat amen the bride is being judged now right what's a self- judgment the Bible says 1 Corinthians 11 27:32 wherefore whosoever shall eat his bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty and of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine everybody around him no no come on come on well I'm better than them look at look at that hypocrite I tell you what huh isn't it isn't it amazing aming the Bible says sometimes we measure ourselves among ourselves huh you real yes Mom I got a C minus in my class but you know how many people below me got a D and an F a't that amazing we huh yeah I beat 12 people in my class I didn't say the 37 others that were far better than me I just look down yeah I'm glad I'm not like this Republican huh brother we pride ourselves well I went to church and this and that yeah how was your life with Christ do you love one another I'm going to preach the Lord willing in next year or two I want to preach on When Love projects we can talk about agapo love we have I want to see it projected in your life amen do you love only those who love you come on even the Pharisees do that and I'll tell you what to love those who hate you and despitefully use you there it is but there's a blessing to bless them and curse not amen I want to see brother Brenham says I would rather see Divine love being projected among the the body than all of the gifts in operation because Godly love covers oh my goodness the word yes well let me tell you you know what brother Sono did I'm an exposive wow is that Godly love you know I have told my Lord and Savior every fault I have yes I have and when I do I'm very quiet before him I don't have to scream it out in fact my most precious prayers are when I am broken and I have a contrite spirit and I can't hardly pray and I'm broken before God and I confess to him everything and he's never told nobody else Oh What A Savior God you talk about real love L's God loved you while you were yet a sinner but God commendeth his love toward us the first scripture I ever learned in my life Romans 5'8 but God commendeth his love toward us that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us I had to learn it at Green Oak Ranch Boy camp and everything the camp that you went to go do whether it's archery or all the activities you had to learn a scripture that was your ticket to get on the little train and I thought it so unfair I want to ride the train I want to memorize some scripture no just okay okay that's what it takes I want to ride the train and I you know you know like those fortune cookies got a little tiny piece of paper in it it said Romans 58 but God commendeth his love toward us while we were yet sinners Christ died for okay God commendeth we're in a world we use the word command never heard that word before so I memorizing it I got on the train I was one happy puppy little did I know it would start a foundation in my life amen that while I was yet a sinner Christ died for me listen when we boil this whole thing of Christianity down into a nutshell you know what it is Paul says is Christ and him crucified amen that's what it's all about He Paid a Debt he didn't owe thank you Lord I owed a debt I couldn't pay I never heard the gospel story before till I was 9 years old I said Jesus Christ died for your sins I I didn't know I was a sinner and they had a guy that had an easel and he had these fluorescent chalks and this guy was a good artist and here was this big Chasm and here was here was Heaven and here was this Earth this Dimension and the only way you could get to heaven and he drew he drew a cross he said the only way that you'll get to heaven is through the cross and I said what is the cross I didn't know what do you mean the cross then they preached a sermon called the cross talk there was a man taken his name was Jesus Christ and he was bitten uh beaten and smitten he was bruised and they made him carry his cross up a hill called golgatha and there he was crucified never heard it before crucified he was crucified for what sin what did he do wrong Jesus said for what sin do you can condemn me what did I do wrong he said you cannot take my life but I Lay My Life down my brother my sister you know what it's such an attraction to this message to me it made Christ real yes am not some religion it wasn't some drummed up Hollywood fireball out here and this and I'll tell you another thing it wasn't none of the Miracles no no not it wasn't the pillar of fire picture it wasn't the cloud picture and I looked at it and said oh my now I believe that's a message of God take away every Miracle take away all the quote signs I heard something greater than a sign I heard a voice behind the veil am amen when you come to church you actually coming here to judge yourself judgment to the bride is actually a three-fold past sin was judged for her at Calvary when you confess your sin as a sinner the sin question is done away with Wow Thank You Lord It's so simple listen coming to Christ is very simple why do we make it so hard receiving the Holy Ghost is so simple and you shall after you have come to Christ he says be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right it's a gift we all like gift don't we amen I love it when I get a gift I love you know I couldn't wait when you got the paper on it there are some people that like to dissect the little piece of paper and save it and they're going to wrap another not me wow what did I get I like a gift well the scripture says that the Holy Ghost is a gift Amen brother leas I have a gift for you you like gifts you do I do too it's nice man you're really I tell you what it's going to do something for you the rest of your life so I have a gift and it's for you amen but what do you got to do you have to take it yes amen right cuz as long as I hold on to it and I tell you how great it is and I can explain so good Bo about what a great gift it is I says it's yours man if you want it what do you got to do you got to take it and when you do you say it's mine man thank you but it's mine some of you that have not received the Holy Ghost I ask you why have you not received the Holy Ghost since you believe on why haven't you on did you just go through justification and sanctification and stop there because the Holy Ghost will give you power it will seal you till the day of your Redemption does it mean you'll never make a mistake does it mean you'll never have an issue you'll never fall no but I'll tell you what those that have the Holy Ghost they keep going hallah amen thank you Lord amen they never quit amen they keep going yes amen your Perfection is not in you it's in him Hallelujah okay M past sins forgiven right as soon as you confessing present how about sins of the flesh omission and commission things that you do wrong did you know that you can grieve the Holy Spirit by correcting your children in Anger amen I'll tell you what kid come here I tell you I told you never to qu qu quack come on well how about when you get done with him God's going to get a hold of you come here you do your boy that way I'll teach you a lesson you don't correct them in Anger you correct them in love amen amen amen yeah you still correct them daddy daddy if you love me I'm sorry no you're still getting it but it's done in love when you get done and say come here come here sit on Daddy's lap like an old Volkswagen that's Out Of Tune and it just you turn it off I had one like that and it just turn it off and it just keep running and the kids you love Daddy yeah you know why daddy did it no because he loves you that's right a son or daughter of God is without chastisement is not his that's right amen so through actions and things that we do we will make mistakes but we confess him immediately God put him under your blood let's go huh amen and for a future a judgment in the future yeah Bible second Corinthians 510 musicians come I'm going to I'm going to close with this I'm only on page four but that's okay I just have a few more things I want to say so I'm not closing I'm getting ready to close amen Future 2 Corinthians 5:10 for we all must appear before the judgment seat of Christ this is Brother Brenan when he went beyond the curtain of time right when he was there and he said I want to see him he said he a little higher you can't see him until you're judged judged yeah does Paul have to be judged yeah and he said praise God because I've said only what Paul said amen so now watch what does this if you it is that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that which he hath done whether it be good or bad yeah bride cannot have True Fellowship with those that are foolish Abraham could not have good fellowship with lot in fact there was always a contention Abraham had the wisdom of God enough to say okay lot you choose first amen you want to know God's will let a lukewarm half in half out Christian let them choose first well here's where I'd go then you know you go this way go ahead lot choose I want the green plains of Sodom Abraham said you go to the right I'll go to the left amen amen Abraham and lot had to get separated shuck had to be separated away from the wheat there comes a time in our life and I believe that God is doing this right now he's taking this little bride yes we pick up one here and one there but if you'll notice actually the crowd is getting thinn down a little bit where are those that were with us just a few years ago where'd they go what happened well this excuse that next thing you know well I don't put so much priority on church or this message the next thing you know a little bit of the world and everything what happened to Nathan and Kora Who challenged the authority of God's man in that day the Bible says that and the Earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up just watch these next thing you know the world Creeps in oh God help us to be like Abraham amen amen judge ourselves Lord is my life getting closer to God can I see it I spoke with a young man just the other day and we were visiting he said brother Ron you know what you were saying that we need to pray and read our Bible and he said you know what I started doing that and he says wow it's been a couple years now and you know what I pray and read my Bible every day and he said but why is it that I don't feel [Music] like I want to feel I said that it's pretty good I said cuz you're in a battle and God is weaning you away from feelings so say what kind of feeling do you want you want a bubble dance you want to get so excited you can say I got it well you can do it and and get so excited I'm nothing wrong with that but when you get done how was your walk with God amen amen I love the U meetings that we had I love the types and the Shadows when you look at the kinsman redeemer I love the story of Boaz because it shows the right of Redemption Now understand after the three died immc Maan and chilon when they all three died here's left widows they' got no seed so Naomi says okay orpa you go back Naomi you go ahead and go back too or Ruth orpa kissed her mother-in-law goodbye and adios and Ruth said no where you go I go that's right amen and your God will be my God and your people now what she's doing I want you to she's identifying under the Covenant that was given to IM LIC and Naomi is a recipient because she was United with you with a liate do you got that cuz the right of redemption comes through the man yes so here aimc she here she's over here in a foreign country she says I'm going back she's got enough spiritual perception I'm going back yes and when she does she she goes to the hometown of ALC and she finds a Kinsman by the name of Boaz who is of the family of IMC it's a nearer Kinsman oh and when these brothers begin to go into this and the Seven sealed book of redemption let me tell you the reason I get excited and the reason I've got a sermon to preach is I've been eating the book yeah I got something to preach when I eat the book book when I re when the word of God is revealed to me and the seals are open guess what it becomes a new book amen Lord amen otherwise I got nothing to [Music] preach such as I have give I Thee Paul said I certify to you Brethren that that which you have heard of me I didn't receive it of man neither was I given of a man but by revelation of the Holy Ghost thank you Lord amen wisdom versus faith faith not wisdom not knowledge that comes from going to church and learning this message on he even said that after I'm gone he said you watch there'll be different ones raised up among you he said the devil will shoot him full of all kinds of poison a word to the church and he said you watch then he shoots him full of poison they said this one and a prophet meant this and he made a mistake over here and next thing you know your minds are all clouded no wonder people huh no Revelation come on you might have heard the voice of William Brandon but did you hear the voice of the spirit I think a very good example that I was told by this personally it's not on tape but you hear his name brother Brenham speaking about him Brother Richard Blair and two of his friends the Martin Brothers John and Earl had invited him to meeting with brother brandham and they told him about brother brandham and so he came and my brother Rand preached up a storm when he got done he told John and wow he told me to get out of denomination so what they did they dialed brother bram's number and brother Blair was so excited to tell brother brandham my what a sermon you told me get out of denomination hello yeah is this brother Brandon oh God bless you my name is Richard Blair and I at to sermon last night and you told me to get out of the domination he said uh excuse me uh brother Blair no I I never told you get out of [Music] denomination um no no you have to understand man why you preach it was it was fantastic I heard you say get out of denomination no no excuse me no you you never heard me say that little little perplexed he said no I I know I heard you say get out of denomination he said if you heard get out of denomination get out of denomination I want to ask you what did you hear through this [Music] message many Saw the Sign many of the people were so excited to see the first and second poll fishes loes signs wonders eyes come open out of wheelchairs oh my then he said but I'm having a change of ministry not going back into first and second P what what said no what good is it to tell the people where they're from and their name said as far as I'm concerned he said I just come out and tell them the word whether they like it or not I go back up he said I think I'll go up in Canada become a Trapper huh yeah that's kind of he he just he'd been preaching so much and I don't know about you but what a man of patience what a what a man of patience he preached for an hour and a half in some fantastic sermon he said okay now how many is there someone here that's got prayer card number one number one are you out there number one look around uh oh good good yes okay number two is there number two I mean you know what he was so patient was he not you know have said 1 through 20 if you got the number get up here if not you're you're left out hey he was so kind so patient oh every time I hear the messages of brother brandham something falls into place another piece to the puzzle and I love it I love this message because I love Christ I do I'm a fool for it too I am I don't want to compromise with it I don't want to water it down just tell me the truth I remember my former Pastor his mom and dad were some of the ones in the Pentecostal movement that got brother Brandon to come to Los Angeles and I'd never met my pastor's mother before never met her and so I figured that when she come to Church she would be just a little Meek gray-haired little old sister come in and you know dressed as a grandmother well I remember my pastor said well my my mother's here today and we were in the church and she was standing right behind us you remember that say she standing just a couple pees behind us and Mom want you to stand up tell the people you you know like this so man she stood up and we turned around we looked and I was shocked my all of these bracelets and they all jingle down praise the Lord God BL and I'm not judging I'm just look I just thought I'd see a gray-haired old motherly and I remember I preached one time and Flagstaff and she was there and one of the deacons says uh sister Patterson wants excuse me but sister Patterson wants to see you she wants to see you right now she called me Ronnie [Laughter] baby points her finger at me she says Ronnie baby let me tell you she says you preach the truth you hearing me Ronnie Baby You Preach the truth whether or not I accepted or anybody else because I want you to tell me the truth amen I said thank you she said don't compromise for nobody she said you preach the truth amen amen that's what I aim to do amen preach the truth God bless you all let's Stand Together [Applause] make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you for you are the father I am the CL more be make me this is what [Applause] you make it ever true change my heart oh [Music] God Amen now we're going to have a a baptismal right now after service and I'm going to dismiss those that are going to get baptized if they'll go now and those that are going to help them if you'll go ahead and do that right now and I just want to bring to your attention if you notice that during the ministering of the word during our anniversary meetings what it wasn't it tremendous and brother Brian was ministering and I thought cast The Net Brian what good is all this preaching if we don't get the last seeden make an appeal and I was ready to come come up to him and tell him Brian cast The Net but he ended the service he turned it over to me and I thought oh God I'm going to do it I'm going to cast a net amen and if you'll notice how sweet the presence of the Holy Spirit was there and there was no begging and it looked like nobody was going to answer that's right okay maybe everybody's saved Maybe but little did we know that God was working beyond the behind the [Music] scenes you saw a little Phoebe come down there her daddy was saying hey you know what I was praying I don't know who it is that's going to go forward but I I'm praying all of a sudden his daughter saying excuse me excuse me and they come up here it's giving your life to Jesus Christ it's what it's all about amen and then after you've come to Christ and you go forward he'll lead you and guide you into all truth and then he'll he'll seal you that's that's the final product being sealed to the day of your Redemption Hallelujah doesn't mean that you won't have an issue things happen no but let me tell you your destination never changes GPS may say oh he took a wrong turn here recalculating but guess what you're still going to come to the same destination praise the Lord God bless you I love you all and I want you to understand if there's someone else here maybe who wanted to get baptized in Christian baptism now is an opportunity amen I've had it happen many times I've seen it when people just all of a sudden next thing you know I got 20 30 people getting baptized you don't beg them you know what just something in their hearts I'm telling you it's on your heart what does hinder God bless y'all turn it to brother Robert and Lord willing you guys be praying for us give me Jesus we leave on Wednesday to be gone
