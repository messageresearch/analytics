this morning God bless you name I'm so happy to be here with you I want to appreciate brother Peter Ronson for his labor of love in this place and I'm privileged this morning uh to come and fellowship with you at evening Light Fellowship uh the Bible says in Zacharias 14:7 the evening light they shall be light in the evening time and that light is this message I it's so precious to us yeah I believe the message when I was 14 years I got saved I was 12 years when I got saved but that was in the Pentecostal but when I was 14 years uh we had a tape of brother Branham and we believe the message we are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the message is life to us yeah brother Bram love to come to Uganda and Kenya and Tanzania but that was his desire but there was a war that was going on between the the the Mau he couldn't come but the message came and reached to Us Praise the Lord and that message is life to us yeah that's why when it came to us we loved it we entered into it and we are hold holding upon it and you know that everything that we need to make it in the Rapture is already given to us in the message of the hour we are just resting upon it and that's our Assurance yeah as Judas said in Judah 3 Judah is the last book of the second last book it's next to Revelation says when I give diligence to write to you I wrot to you that you may obtain for the faith that was delivered to the Saints yeah so this faith brother Bram was sent to restore us back that faith and that's the faith we we are containing for yeah in the message the perfect Faith he said the bride has to reach into that perfect faith when you read the scripture in Marco uh 1122 have the faith of God I say when we reach that that that stage we shall be the bride material and I want to tell you today I'm looking at the bride material we are the purest of the blood of Jesus Christ I know that very soon we are going to make it into the Rapture because the word of God has already identified us and we are identified with the word the message of this hour we are seeing events made clear by prophecy when you look at what's happened to Israel that's the natural church but we are a spiritual church we know that our time of going home is closer it's more than uh than we think anytime something can happen that's why Paul says in first 1 Corinthians 15 verse 51 says I show you a mystery we shall not die but we shall we shall not all die but we shall be changed in the twinkle of an eye it will be so speed like that so any time because no one knows the day the time but we know the season because we are seeing the events we are seeing the bath pain happening all over you see if you are Eyes Are Open you can see the bath pain happening these things happening land sliding water over flowing sickness coming like coid 19 all those are birth pain why the the world is is is crying for new release is crying for the manifestation of the sons of God and we are the manifestation sons of God so may God bless you my name's um Bima Steven I've been a pastor for this message uh over 27 years I love Jesus Christ I see where I begin and where he taking us he has

whatever the need be father I pray Grant it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you let's just remain standing thank you musicians I appreciate all of that thank you for the song special today greatly appreciate it each and everyone doing their part amen Luke 17 if you would Luke 17: 29-30 Luke 17 verse 29 and 30 but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed turn back with me into the Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 18 and verse 11 Matthew 18 verse1 for the son of man is come to save that which was losten there is a mission there is a reason there was a purpose yes and he says I keep came to seek and to save that which was lost Luke chapter 19 if you would back to Luke 19 veres 9-10 Jesus having spoke to n Nicodemus and told him to come down out of the sycamore tree this day I've got to have lunch with you at your home verse 9 and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for as much as he also is a son of Abraham he was identified as Seed of Abraham I'm sure zakus is going oh wow how does he know me and the verse 10 says for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of God Amen I would like to continue on there is this is such a vast subject that really as I got into it and as you know as a minister as you begin to study the word of God it begins to unfold and it just goes from one scripture to this to another thought and that and you just next thing I know I have 17 pages of notes where normally I have 10 to 12 I will see how far I go on that if I can I'll try to finish it all but if we can't that's no problem we'll have some left over for another time now I would like to continue on the subject of the revealing of the son of man this is part two and I want to take a a a subject here of the change of ministry and a change of administration you will find out that every time that God has a minister or a prophet upon the age or upon the scene you will find out that there is a certain Ministry that he has and God is with that Ministry and you'll find out that that M Ministry even within itself changes amen it goes brother brms actually says that every great prophetic Ministry has three polls it has a first poll a second second pull and a third pull so we understand that there is a Ministry and how there's a change in the ministry and when you have a change of ministry you have a change of the way it's administered so I want to take some of this and I want to parallel for just a moment because it would it would be foolish of us to not mention some of the things that's happening in the world today right now with Israel why because the prophet of God said the very same hour that the angel of God met me the very same day the very same hour that he sent me with this message he said Israel became a nation he said behold the Fig Tree and he says watch if your understanding you'll catch that all of this is connected together Israel and the church as it was in the first Exodus it'll be in another Exodus even in this our day so we understand even all of the global leaders now we're talking the natural right now global leaders are very concerned people are ambassadors are flying going from one country to another and Muslim leaders are rising up causing uh the Muslim Believers or religion to unite together in fact the leader of that Muslim movement said we are wanting the world to see the power of Islam Benjamin Netanyahu had a rebuttal of that he says you can come against us with spear and sword you can do what you want but we come to you in the name of the god of Israel amen we know that what is happening in Israel isn't an atrocity it is horrible and I want you to understand that this is the part of the flashing red lights of his coming we know that Christ is coming he's coming very soon the Bible says I just throw a couple scriptures out here for you to make you aware of what's Happening Luke 21 verses 20 through 32 and when you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies how many of you know they've actually Compass them in from north south east west compass with armies then know that the Desolation thereof is nigh then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains let them which are in the midst of it depart let not them which are in the countries enter there into we can see that scenario playing right now right for these be the days of Vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled but woe unto them that are with child to them that give suck in those days for there shall be G great distress in the land and wrath upon this people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and they shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled so it says Jerusalem is going to be a Troublesome Stone people that handle it the Bible says this is going to be an area that people are going to have a problem with Jerusalem and so it's a uh it's going to be h a Troublesome Stone it's going to be a hot potato if you please until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled so watch the connection there's Gentiles and Jews and we're understanding that God is going to deal with the Gentiles for a period of time he calls that the times of the Gentiles and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity and the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing for fear and look and looking for after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken then you then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory can you say Amen with that amen when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh I say my brother my sister if these things which he prophesy are now here at our doorstep and the world is watching it it's on the news it's on every channel why all of a small piece of land called is Israel amen amen so likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand verily I say unto you the Gen this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled picking it up also in Acts chapter 2 the Bible says verse 16 but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the Earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass it whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved my brother my sister we are in the midst of perilous times a time of trouble the world is perplexed T the of a small country Israel why in the world would there be such an uprising to want to destroy a people that for thousands of years they've been persecuted they've been killed they've been gassed they've done all these things to try to eradicate the children of Abraham but you know what God is with them God is watching over them signs of the times are all around us Wars rumors and Wars Israel is at War at this very moment Ishmael is attacking Isaac they are of the seed Ishmael of the Seed of Abraham through Hagar you all know that according to scripture and ishmail hated Isaac and persecuted Isaac the and I told you here just a couple weeks ago I said watch things happened to Israel on feast day and here 50 years ago on the same day yam Kapur the day of atonement the most holy feast day of all the feasts of Israel there the the uh Arabs attacked Israel 50 years ago they called it the yam Kapur War what do they call it now yam Kapur War part two I don't know but it's continuing because just as it's been from the very beginning Satan does not want to see the Seed of Abraham come to fruition but God Is Watching Over Israel I tell you my brother my sister the whole world right now is got their eyes on Israel now watch this because do you think it just was coincidence that it happened on the day of yam Kapur do you think it was coincidence that yesterday how many know that we had a solar eclipse how many of you even walked outside or perhaps even looked at it or took a picture you'll find out the Bible says and the sun shall be darkened the moon shall turn to blood we have seen all of these Blood Moons we have seen the the eclipses all of that now the prophet of God God when he was here he he began to take notice of these he said they're signs the Bible says let the sun and the Stars let them be for times and for Seasons I want you to understand God is showing you timing and Israel brother Brenham said is God's time piece so we want to see what's happening with Israel it's a Time piece could it be that the countdown has already begun could it be that this partial eclipse of the Sun watch this it's amazing because there was a partial eclipse and it caused a ring of fire Hallelujah but there's coming another one in 2024 April the 8th that is going to be a total eclipse of the Sun not a partial this was a partial and they will have the sun will be blotted out by the moon and when it does it will not have a ring of fire because the the this eclipse of the moon will be 112 miles closer to the Earth and it will cover the the sun and it will have a Corona it will have a like a Halo completely around it I'm wondering have we entered into the time where in the church is trying to eclipse the light of God In This Very hour and yet God is fixing to Crown it Hallelujah signs of the times are everywhere brother Brandon picks it up a lot of you see in church age follow along Matthew 24 mention signs in the heavens concerning this last day just before Jesus comes I wonder if you notice such a sign recently fulfilled as to portray the very truth that we've been discussing that truth is that Jesus has been steadily pushed aside until the last age he has pushed outside the church and he goes on I'm going to just read the highlighted portion now think on this the church shines in the reflected Light of Christ he is the sun the church is the moon so we're seeing sun and moon we're seeing Christ in the church something's happening thus this orb of light is the Moon it had decreased from almost a full moon in the first age to a silver in the fourth age but in the fifth age he began to grow in the sixth age it took a great step of growth forward in part of the 7eventh age it was still growing when suddenly it stopped short and waned to almost a nothingness so that instead of light it was the Blackness of apostasy and at the end of the age it had ceased to shine for that Darkness had taken over I tell you what just look at the world condition now look at the minds of people they don't know a man from a woman I'm telling you they are turned over to reprobate Minds to a time of deception M that's gross Darkness the people Christ is now outside the church here's the sign in the sky the last eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse he says and when he went to Jerusalem speaking of the Pope the moon or the church went into total darkness this is it this is the end this generation shall not pass away until all be fulfilled even so Lord Jesus come quickly what you saw yesterday is just for telling you that things are happening these things don't happen just by coincidence it happens for a purpose it's showing to you I'm coming I'm coming here's the flashing red light you see the blood moons you see the sun being darkened you see on feast days hallelujah what is God doing getting our attention but there was a greater sign than all of that there was a voice sent in this day behold I will send you Elijah the prophet and he shall prophesy and he shall finish the mysteries of God hallelujah it'll be the mystery being finished that the Bible says down Through the Ages that's been hid but what is it it's Christ in you the hope of glory showing the very mystery that's being finished you have a part of it Hallelujah you are part of a prophetic word that's being finished in this very hour Hallelujah somebody say Amen to that he didn't come here to tell you how to go to church how to pay your tith or how to dress that's all a part of it but he taught you how that you might have a union that you might be having an invisible Union with Christ and Christ is the word that's why he came back to restore the word not some denomination not some man's idea but the word back to the word here's God's umum Thumb you want to know what's truth God's word is [Applause] true somebody give him praise this [Applause] morning headline news Muslim nations are being rallied right now against Israel it's very important to understand that the prophets identified pre-tribulation spirits during the second world war he said watch Hitler Stalin and musolini are pre tribulation Spirits he said they are spirits poured out it wasn't a man it was a spirit and they hated the Jews they gassed them they shot them they starved them they did everything I whed aitz I saw what they did right it was a death camp they told him we're sending you to a labor camp over that gate arbite mock in German work makes Freedom they walked through those Gates and as soon as the gates were closed they said there's only one way out of aitz and that's through the chimney of the crematorium it was a death camp why pre-tribulation let me tell you that same spirits of Hitler Stalin and musolini are now in Hamas Isis and Hezbollah you're seeing the atrocities that they'll do to women and children are beheading you think how can anybody with any kind of conscience do this to little children to women to yes excuse me old people brother Brenham said excuse me he said any man without the spirit of Christ is nothing but a brute beast that's right and he says who will ravish the women take the little child cut it out of the mother bash its head against the wall oh my and he says watch pre-tribulation spirit this same MOS Hezbollah and Isis that's rallying together right now guess guess who they're going to kill remember Revelations 11 has two witnesses coming down Moses and Elijah and guess what they're going to do they're going to kill them also remember they're going to call plagues and things huh and then they're going to kill them and their bodies are going to lay there in Jerusalem for 3 days and then God will raise them up but also the 44,000 the true Jew huh the true Jews out 12,000 out of every tribe that's what your Bible says 144,000 you know what they're going to do to them too they're going to Martyr them who's going to do it Hamas Isis hollah and there's going to be a mark of the beast let me tell you when this pale horse rider begins to ride death and Hell follow him but praise God there's going to be a Rapture of the Bride there's going to be a catching a way before that happens hallelujah or how would you even want to bring children into this world knowing what's coming on the face of the Earth thank God we got a promise thank God we got blood thank you we got a t token that is over us God help me to speak this morning there's going to be a change of ministry and a change of administration because we see the Gentile days is just about over Gentiles days are numbered amen he said when the Gentile day of dispensation is closed there'll not be another Gentile saved and guess what God's going to do he's going to fix it all and go back to the Jews huh wow now watch this because we see it in the scriptures remember Jesus said go not on all the world he said I want you to go first to the house of Israel how many know he said that go first to the house of Israel and so they go and guess what they do they rejected him God who was omnipotent and merciful knew he blinded his own children yes he blinded their eyes otherwise they would have seen their Messiah but they crucified him why because he had to be crucified he was kinsman redeemer he had to come and pay the price do you understand that watch the change now in Acts chapter 13 Paul being the first church age messenger verse 45 but when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it's necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you but see you put it from me you judge yourselves Unworthy of an everlasting life Lo we turn and go to the Gentiles so there's a Time the ministry is changing we went first to Israel you rejected I'm changing the ministry I'm changing now the administration I'm going from Jew to Gentile are you following that so we see the pattern happening again today Gentiles have rejected the word of God and their eyes have been blinded the Bible says in 2 Corinthians Chapter 4 verses 3 and 4 but if our gospel be hid it's hid to them that are lost look at that if our gospel be hid it's hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not well I don't believe you can't believe but if you are a seed of God you can't help but believe nobody talks you into it and nobody talks you out of it Hallelujah whom the God of this world has blinded their minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them the prophet of God came down in our day and he said guess what 1956 the church came to a place called kades Baria and he says and they rejected the gospel the Full Gospel businessman the Pentecostal Church those that God was shining the light to they rejected the word and he says kabot is written on the wall Judgment of God is now striking America as much as I don't like it as much as you'd like to raise up somebody and and put somebody back in office the prophet of God said you could put a Abraham Lincoln and a George Washington in every office he said it's too late she's already turned oh my we see America going so radical that even parents parents you that are watching over your children you that the ones God is given as your inheritance you're labeled a terrorist I'll tell you what we need some more parental terrorists in this end time that'll stand up how many of you say I stand for my family I stand for the word of God otherwise if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything Judgment of God is now striking America 1964 proving his word he promised these things to happen in the last day the same son of man will be made manifest we're talking about the revealing of the son of man watch this now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discerned the thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not been yet born but it was man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the almighty God showing as Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more a church see not no more the bride is called I want you to understand there's a delineation here he said I'm not longer calling you church

you to understand this message has United you with the revealed word of this hour who is it none other than Christ himself he is the mystery of God revealed I'll take the manifestation it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman do you see what what I mean see it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us make his word so real it'll unite the church in him as one oh my brother the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United see we're going to the wedding supper not to the marriage the marriage is here it's right now hallelujah what marriage you to Christ when you give your vow brother Brenham said when you vow yourself to him or another person you are married in the eyes of God it's The Vow that marries you not say Church ceremony that's a legal certificate Hallelujah watch this to unite we're not going to go get married we're already married let me blow your mind you're already pregnated you already got seed he pregnated you at the time of the invisible Union a union of Love guess what he did he Zoey life came in pregnated that elect seed predestinated to take his life it's no longer you that live Paul said I show you a mystery it's no longer I that live but Christ that liveth in me and the works that I do I don't do it myself but I do it because Christ is in me Hallelujah God glory but the Rapture the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person the two become one oh God and when what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word then the church become one whatever the son of man does or the son has done he was the word then the church does the same thing out of the world he calls the church and out of the church he calls a bride there came a time when Jesus said I no longer call you servants but I call you friends because a servant does not know what his Lord doth but a friend will know what his master doth Hallelujah we've we've come to the time we're no longer church it's not time to be Church any longer it's time to make your higher calling an election sure I'm part of the Bride somebody say I'm bride God taking his group to a higher calling amen here Christ revealed in his own word excuse me I'm just going to read the highlighted portions 1965 Luke 17:30 watch what Jesus prophesied there saying as it was in the days of Sodom it'll be the same now remember notice this at the time that the son of man be be revealed the revealing of the son of man now the son of man was actually revealed potentially just for a few moments there just before Sodom was burned now that man was Elohim that was God and Jesus Is God and God was revealed potentially right there for a few moments to talk to Abraham in the time of investigating judgment oh my do we understand there ain't going to be no more revivals big sweeping revivals this nation

they're learning the Bible says they'll be forever learning but never knowing the knowledge of the truth right this Bible is a sealed Bible now not everyone that reads it will understand it not everyone that passes through these pages will catch the Revelation that God is wanting to give to the church but he that hath an ear he will hear he that hath an eye will see can you say Amen to thaten let me tell you that's what makes you so different God put a predestinated seat inside of you and he said when I send an evening light it shall be light about the even evening time and when I send the light there'll be something inside of you that'll say no man spake like that man what was it the seed was receiving truth it was thank you Lord it was being [Music] quickened there was

day and I want you to get big catapults with bombs and I want you to blow and the walls are going to just come what did he say I want you to do what Lord did I hear that shout is that all we do his ways are above our ways and his thought thoughts are above our thoughts right all they do is go around Jericho Joshua H the Battle of Jericho we sing it Jericho Jericho right they go around it seven times okay Israel I want you to shout and they Shout to the Lord and when they do the walls the only part of the wall that didn't come down somebody had a Scarlet thread sir Hallelujah somebody had

Joshua the destroying Angel you'll be saved you in your house wow God's ways are above our ways his thoughts are above our thoughts I tell you within the son of man Ministry is your full inheritance your full adoption remember the son of man came to seek and to s that which was lost amen Revelation chapter 5 1961 our kinsman redeemer is handed the seven sealed book of redemption from the original owner stop there just a moment the Bible says in Revelations chapter 5 who's worthy to take the book right Amen to loose the seals thereof yes and John says and there was no man found worthy in heaven upon Earth I looked and around I looked around and there was no one worthy to take the book and I John wept and as he began to walk away distraught that no one could take the book and there was a voice the Bible says Revelation chapter 4 and a voice behind me said we' not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah shall Prevail and I turned to look and I saw a lamb he saw a lamb having been slain before the foundation of the world who was worthy Revelation 5 No One worthy in Revelations 10 take the book and eat it there's something happened what was it son of man came down took the book who was it Christ himself he is those seals Hallelujah you think you're eating a message of a man you're eating the words of the unfeeling words of the UN of the son of man if you just saw the veil you missed it if you missed the third poll of his ministry when it was changed you missed it that's why they want to go back they want to go back they want healing signs they want to go back Church go back back to pentec let me tell you the church never goes backward the church goes forward he said you cannot feed the bride of Christ Pentecostalism Hallelujah why that was for its day but God's light keeps going on he said he said Luther's day was good in that day that was the word of God in its hour and then Along come Wesley and it was God it was the word in its hour but he said that word left over to the next age will not produce nothing because that age must have a life in itself do you understand that can't live by the glare of of another age Luther Wesley Pentecost he says that Pentecost wanted the gifts that was restoration the gifts Rebecca she took the gifts yes and she was on her when she came riding the camel which was the power to bring her to Isaac because elaser but when she saw who is that man in the field elzar said that's your lord and she lighted off of that Camel Hallelujah and she went from the gifts to The Giver hallelujah hallelujah hallu I'm not wanting just the gifts sir the Apostle Paul said I want to take you Church unto Perfection beyond the laying on of hands the gifts of God beyond all of that I want to bring you into a Perfection this we will do he said if God permit God Wills that he brings you into Perfection what is it maturity you're no longer when as a child I think as a child child I spake as a child I understood as a child Paul said when I became a man put away childish things people playing with the gifts all they want to do and you know this and that nonsense I want the giver we don't you you know what listen he didn't do away with the gifts he just put them in order Brenham Tabernacle you've played with these gifts for 20 plus years now I'm going to put them in order they got offended that's what it caused the split sole objective ad mission of the son of man to seek and to save that which lost kinsman redeemer he breaks the seals reveals gives his inheritance to his people gives the inheritance the inherited by becoming the kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but in instead of keeping it himself he gives it back to the people that's his love for us thank you Lord watch this what was sealed in sight of God was revealed in Christ what was sealed inside of Adam was revealed in Eve what was sealed inside of this closed book is now revealed in the open book and what was sealed inside the Seven Seals which was Christ is now revealed in the bride this is that mystery that's been hid down from the ages and generations it's Christ the mystery of God being revealed That's What Makes You Different that's what makes you different from denomination why because the mystery of God is being revealed to you how can you not be different God revealing how could Abel not be different than that of Cain it's not by the life you live it's not by how you keep the law but it's the god inside of you keeping his own law amen let me just say this to all of you a little secret you had nothing to do with it he's doing it thank you Lord you didn't call yourself you didn't even go looking for him he came looking for you now whenever these things begin to

Christ 19 60 now when this gospel is returning to the Jews when the day of the Gentiles finished we're right there we're right there that's what's happening in Israel you see just like it was in the first Exodus if they could kill all the elect seed they might stop they might stop a Moses from coming on the scene do you see they did did it in the days of Jesus kill all of the children and this great thing is fixing to happen will carry over to Revelations 11 what happens after Revelations 10 Revelations 11 pick up those two prophets Elijah and Moses returning back for the Jews we're ready
