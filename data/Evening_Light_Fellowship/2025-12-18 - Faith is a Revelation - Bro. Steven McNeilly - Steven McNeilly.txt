========================================

I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child. Let's all stand as we sing the first verse. You unravel me with a melody. You surround me with a song of deliverance from my enemies. Till all my tears have gone. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. From my father's womb, you have chosen me and love has called my name. I've been born again into a family. Your blood flows through my veins and I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God and I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. I am surrounded by the arms of the father. I am surrounded by songs of delivering from our bondage to We're the sons and the daughter. Let us sing our great. You split the sea so I could walk right through it. My fears were ground in perfect love. You rescued me so I can stand and sing. I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. Blessed be his name. It's good to be called his child. Amen. To have a heavenly father. Brother Bobby McGary, would you come tonight, Brother Bobby, and open our service in a word of prayer? Let's just hand a prayer request before we came out from Sister Molly. It says, "My mom passed away early this morning. Thank you for your prayers during her illness." So, let's pray for the family. Pray for sister Molly, all the family members. Pray the Lord be their strength and their comfort at this time. How many would have a need tonight? You just want to lift your hand before the Lord. He's aware of each and every need. Amen. Brother Bobby, if you would come, let's let's pray. Father, we're a privileged people to be in your presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; You've done so much for us. We thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, you see the needs of the people, Lord. Lord, you're more than able to meet those needs. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you for what you've done in our lives, Lord, and what you're doing and what you're going to do. Father, would you heal the brokenhearted and give strength to the weak, Lord? Would you bless the service tonight? &gt;&gt; May we receive what you have for us. Thank you for what you're done in our lives. Father, we love you and we commit this service, our lives, this night into your hands. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Bobby. You may be seated tonight. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Welcome each one here tonight. And those of you streaming, we just want to welcome each one. Just a reminder, this coming Wednesday, a week from tonight, Christmas Eve, there will be no service here. We've canceled our service on Christmas Eve.

Appreciate everything Lord has done for him. Pray Lord continue to be with him. Amen. Love each and every one of you as well. It's good to see each one tonight. And we're coming up on the Christmas season. The world celebrating the birth of a savior. And much as I appreciate that, I'm so thankful for the cross of Calvary tonight. And I wanted to sing at Calvary. Years I spent in sin and pride was there at Calvary the price was paid. Amen. &gt;&gt; Years I spent in vanity and pride and caring not my Lord was crucified. And though he thought it was for me, he died on Calary. Oh, mercy there was rain and grace was free and offered there was multiplied to me. There my burden soul found liberty at calary and by God's word at last my sin I learned and then I tremble at the law I spurn till my guilty soul glor to cal Glory. Oh mercy there was great and grace was free and pardon there was multiplied to me. And there bear my burden soul found liberty at calary. And now I've given to Jesus everything. And now I gladly owe him as my king. And now my raptured soul can only sing of Calary. Oh mercy there was great and grace was free. His heart there was love declined to me. There my birds open birdie at Cal and know the love that grew salvation land and know the grace that brought it down to man and know the mighty dawn God at Cal. Calary mercy there was great and grace was free. His pardon there multiplied to me and there by burden sold liberty at Cal the course again. Oh, mercy there was great and grace was free.

Let's all stand. been thinking today of his goodness, the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that before we turn the service to brother Stephen. So many things to thank him for. Amen. I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hand. From the moment that I wake up till I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of love. And all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire. In the darkest night, you are close like no other. I've known you as father. I've known you as a friend and I have lived in the goodness of God. And all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the new. Your goodness is running after running after me. Your goodness is running after running after me. With my life laid down, I surrender now. I give you everything. Your goodness is running after, running after me. Cuz all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. Every &gt;&gt; I will sing of the goodness of God. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise this evening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what the greatest thing about the faithfulness of God is? Is that he is faithful even when we are not faithful. &gt;&gt; That's why he made a promise and he said he could swear by no greater. So he swore by himself &gt;&gt; because he realized that man could not keep the covenants or promises of God that and so he said I swear by myself Abraham. It's not by your works but it's what I'm going to do for you. And so God this evening in his word is it's not what we can do for God, but it's what God has already done for us &gt;&gt; and we just need to accept the finished work of Calvary. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's pray this evening. Father God, Lord, we commit our lives into your hands &gt;&gt; because there's no other hands that we want to be in, Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't want to lead ourselves and we don't want to be the pilot of our own ship. But Father, we ask that you would come and that you would take control of all of our lives, Lord. Take control of this service this evening, Lord. You know the thought that you've placed on my heart. And I pray, Father, that the thought would be extracted from my heart to your people's heart. Let it be, Lord. We pray that for every need, Lord, that was uh unspoken here this evening that you would meet it. And we ask that you'd be with Sister Molly and the family, Father, that you would comfort them at this time. Let all things be done for thy kingdom's glory in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We greet you this evening in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. And uh it's always an honor and a privilege to come to the house of the Lord. If you have your Bible, turn with me to the book of Hebrews, chap 11. Thank you, musicians. And we'll read verse one. And then we'll go from Hebrews to Romans, chapter 1. We'll read verses 16 and 17. Allelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Very familiar portion of scripture for us here this evening. Hebrews chap 11 and verse 1. It says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Brother Brandon would take that and he said it's the evidence of of things that is not seen, not felt, nor smelt, nor heard because it has nothing to do with our five senses. It's a spiritual six sense. &gt;&gt; Six sense. Romans chapter 1 vers 16 and 17. And it says, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, the just shall live by faith." Amen. You may be seated this evening. I would like to title my sermon this evening, faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think uh once in a while it's good for us as ministers to speak on faith because uh it's so easy for us for our uh faith to become we would say uh low or for our faith to become discouraged. And once in a while we need a a little injection of of faith put into our blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I I I would like to speak on on faith and perhaps um take it from a little bit of a different angle this evening um regarding faith. And my title kind of gives it away of faith is a revelation. And we understand that faith without faith it is impossible to please God. And the reason that we are all here this evening is because we want to be pleasing unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to figure out, you know, not just where we're we're doing good in life, but we want to see kind of uh what we need help with and we want to get a little bit of encouragement and whatever the Lord would have for us in our spiritual life. That's why we gather into the house of the Lord. It's not to just be seen or it's not to be heard or it's not to have fellowship one with another. Though those things are nice, but it's for us as as as the word here on earth to receive from the word from heaven. &gt;&gt; We want to receive from the word because whether we like it or not, we are becoming the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say that because whenever you become the word, it it it it it is taking us into uh kind of uncharted waters, if I could say it like that. When we think about becoming the word of God, we we think about the great miracles of God and we think about great healings of God and so on and so forth. But when we become the word, we never think of of well, if somebody smites you on the cheek that you turn the other cheek. that if someone asks you to walk, you know, half a mile with them, that you walk a mile. Or if someone asks for your coat, you give them your cloak also. And we find out that these things are is is actually the word becoming flesh in this day. It is a life lived of the gospel. So whenever we think about it and we get all rejoicing over it um and and we think of the the great things of becoming the word a lot of times we forget of the simplicity of the word and the simplicity of becoming and living a Christian life. &gt;&gt; The amazing thing about it is this is that everything to do with the Christian life is contrary to who we are as carnal human beings. &gt;&gt; That's right. So anyways, enjoy becoming the word. So the reason why we're here this evening is because we want to do that which is pleasing to the Lord. And and before we can have faith because without faith it's impossible to please him. First of all, we need to recognize and understand exactly what faith is. Right. &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard or or made the comment even yourself, uh, all I need to do is is have faith. All I need is is a little more faith. Uh, all I want is to have a little more faith. And if I had just a little bit more faith, I could do this. And if I had a little more faith in God, perhaps I would receive my healing, or perhaps I would be able to overcome this situation. and and we're talking about um and and we think about faith AND WE SAY, "WOW, ALL I need is is just that little bit more. And if I had a LITTLE BIT MORE FAITH, I COULD DO ALL THINGS. And if and if and if and it almost seems like faith is something that is just is is untouchable." that faith is something that that when you think you're getting to a place of faith that it just steps a little bit further and you never you never fully grasp it and you say all I all I need is a is a little bit more faith and I believe that and perhaps it's the ministry's fault that we have we have put place in such a a a position in such a place where you know if if life isn't going good well you don't have faith enough or if you haven't received a healing or you haven't received uh uh uh your sons or or your daughters into the kingdom of God is it's your fault AND IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH FAITH and and this is happening because your your faith is no good and I think we've we've preached faith and saying well all you need is faith and all well it's true all we need is faith but what is faith &gt;&gt; is faith an imagination Is faith some kind of uh uh myth? Is it some kind of thing that's that's that's not tangible? It can't be touched. It can't be felt. It uh what is faith exactly? Because if we have to attain faith to be pleasing to God, I want to know what is faith &gt;&gt; and I want to know how it is applied in my life. And I want to know how to be pleasing to God with my faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when faith is something that's magical, let me say it that way, when it's something that's uh perhaps a a a figment of our imagination, faith will never ever be tangible and it'll never be anything that we can fully grasp. But I want you to know that faith is real. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That faith is tangible. &gt;&gt; That faith is solid. The Bible says it is a solid rock. It's a firm foundation. It's not something that's far off in the clouds that we have to do something magical to receive it. No. Faith is the simplicity of the gospel. Faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not something that's not within our grasp. And when we realize what faith really is, we can start living our life according to faith. and according to the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; A lot of times when we when we when we don't receive what it is that we're that we're praying for or that we're trying to have faith for, and as time goes on, a lot of times our faith can uh it can drop. When our when our faith is something that that's in our imagination or the intellects of man, before you know it, you will give up on faith. When faith is not a revelation to you personally, you will give up on what it is that you're trying to have faith for. But when faith is a true revelation to you personally from God, it doesn't matter how long it takes for whatever it is to come to pass in your life, you'll still believe God and your faith will still be strong. &gt;&gt; That's right. And so our problem is this is that we are we are constantly trying to figure out what faith is or we have a misconception of what it actually is and what it actually is in our lives. And so before long we get discouraged. We pray and we try to have faith AND AND I'M TRYING SO HARD THIS WEEK to have faith for this. AND I'M TRYING SO HARD to have faith for that. And before long, when you're trying so hard to have the faith and it doesn't come to pass, we end up in this cycle of of depression and this this cycle of, well, perhaps it's not for me. Perhaps that is for somebody else. Or or or we get discouraged in our walk. And and it's really because we don't understand what faith is. We're trying to figure it out intellectually. We're trying to work our way into it. We're trying to pull oursel up to some level of of what we think where faith is. And we're actually missing what faith actually is. &gt;&gt; When I say faith is a revelation, you're all going to go, "Well, yeah, I understand that." But faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is something that is given to you personally from God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And so when you think about revelation and you think about the word and the revelation of this hour, there's many things that is called that we could call revelation. I'll get into that after a little while because there's me there's many things that God has revealed to you personally and you're missing that that's actually faith &gt;&gt; because faith is a revelation &gt;&gt; and faith will hold you in your time of need. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so what happens is we when we're feeling when we're feeling good in God and we're feeling spiritual and and and and and and we're praying and we're reading our Bible so on and so forth, we say, "My my faith is so strong right now and and I'm feeling good and and I can cut off any devil's head and I can do this and I can do that and I can run through a troop and I can run over a a leap over a wall and I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." And it's all to do with feelings. Understand? Faith has nothing to do with feelings. &gt;&gt; But faith is faith. &gt;&gt; Faith is a six sense. It has nothing to do with how you feel. It has nothing to do what you can see, taste, feel, smell, or hear, but it has everything to do with the revelation of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, so a lot of times what happens is we're feeling good and we're feeling strong and it's all to do with feelings and then when something goes wrong or we have a bad day, we say, "Wow, my faith is low. There's something wrong. I Yeah, I'm just not feeling it today. I my my faith is at an all-time low and and Satan is just trampling all over me and my mind is his playground and so on and so forth. Wait a second. What changed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If faith is a revelation that's given from God, it's a revelation when you're feeling good and it's a revelation when you're feeling bad. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why so many people are tossed to and fro. It's not because they don't love God, but it's because they're trying to work themselves up into something that they are making unattainable. &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried to Have you ever tried to do something that perhaps it it's out of your league to do and you just can't do it, but you keep trying to do it? &gt;&gt; How frustrating is that? You ever You ever set a goal and you think, "I'm making my goals big, man. big. I'm going to drop 50 pounds. And and and and you drop 30, which is awesome, BUT YOU FEEL BAD BECAUSE YOU CAN'T get to 50. And and you can never get to that goal because it's unattainable. It's it's just not attainable. And a lot of us, we do that with faith. We set these big goals and the FAITH IS WAY UP HERE and we're trying to climb the ladder and we fall down the ladder and well faith is right there and if I could just get to there everything will be okay. And we climb and we fall and we climb and we fall until we stop climbing. &gt;&gt; Is the ladder really even worth climbing? &gt;&gt; And it's because of our conception &gt;&gt; of faith. The prophet said that if you had enough faith that you could go and you could create a world and you could go live on that world. Anybody ever heard the &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; the quote powerful quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is is trying to tell us that all things are possible. &gt;&gt; But let me ask you a question. If you were to create a world, what kind of world would you create to live in? Do you think that you were able to create a world and what would it be like? Would it just be would it just be one little imagery of of this of this perfect LITTLE ROOM WITH YOU AND nobody else there? Why would you want to create a world and go and live in it by yourself anyways? &gt;&gt; So I could get away from everybody because everybody else is my problem in life. You'll find out if you go to that world. Chances are your troubles will go with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What kind of world would it be? You know, so much of the time we can become recluse and we want to get on a world on our own and we want to and we want to do that. We want to have the faith for that. You know what? That is is actually contrary to God &gt;&gt; because God was alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he wasn't happy that he was alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was lonely. Therefore, he had a plan in his mind that he created a world. &gt;&gt; And not only did he have the beginning in mind, but he had the ending in mind. &gt;&gt; And he had everything in between in his mind. And this plan that God has is perfect. And why did he want to why did he want to create people? Why did he want to have sons and daughters? Because he craved fellowship. &gt;&gt; Understand? And it's not good for you to be alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not good for you to be in an island all by yourself with just you and your family. You need fellowship. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm better off all by myself." No, you're not. Because God gave you a helpmate. &gt;&gt; It wasn't good that Adam dwelt alone. And so therefore, he gave Adam a wife. But he didn't stop with Eve. He told them, "Go forth and multiply." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You see, it wasn't good that he was alone, and it wasn't good enough that God give him a wife, but he gave him a wife to multiply and replenish the earth. Therefore, it's good for you to replenish the earth. The McNeel are trying their best, but we're just one family. There's only so much they can do. But what I'm saying is, what I'm saying for anybody online, we got six kids, you know, judge all you want. It's okay. What I'm saying is this. I'm saying that it's not good for you to be alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you need friendship. That you need family. That you need you need a relationship with other people. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS THAT iron strengthens iron. &gt;&gt; The uncertain cell 1961, brother Brandham says, "Now if you're not certain, then you can't have faith. If there's no certainty, you cannot have any faith because faith is something that's certain." I like that. It's certain. It's true. It's real. It's steadfast. It's certain. faith. He says, you know, uh faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It's not a myth. It's not just an imagination. It's not hope, but it's faith. &gt;&gt; He says faith is a substance. It's something that God has given you. Amen. And then you do not see it, but you just you just as sure got it as if you had it right in your hands. Faith is what purchases the product that you are hoping for. So, brother Brandham says it's it's not a myth. It's not an imagination of your mind. Nor is it a hope. Faith doesn't hope. But faith doesn't hope that God will or that thought that God can. But faith knows that God will. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between can and will. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, it isn't the intellects of our minds that we're trying to bring ourselves into this substance. It's not an imagination. It's not a myth, but it's real. Faith is something that's tangible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that you can hold on to. Faith is a gift from God that God gives to every one of us. It's it's something that we possess as believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And grace are and faith we realize is the faith is a gra is the grace of God that is given to us. Some of you might think to yourselves tonight you know uh I don't have a whole lot of faith. But I want you to know something that you have more faith than what you think you have. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you why. Because you are here tonight. &gt;&gt; Because it takes a faith. Now remember, and I'm just going to always go back to it so you know what my sermon title is. Is that faith is a revelation. And revelation is given from God. And so understand that to come to a church to come to church on a Wednesday night takes faith &gt;&gt; because coming to church on a Wednesday night, guess what? It's never uh um it's never easy. &gt;&gt; When is coming to church on a Wednesday night easy? When do you ever have an easy day on a Wednesday at work? When are the kids ever easy for you at home on a Wednesday? When is it ever convenient to drive to church in Phoenix in rush hour traffic on a Wednesday night? It is never convenient to come to church on a Wednesday night. And perhaps that's why sometimes uh we don't have as many people here on a Wednesday as we do on a Sunday because Wednesdays aren't convenient, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Satan makes it that way on purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; You know what? But if we were to change church to a Thursday night to make it more convenient, it would still wouldn't be convenient. &gt;&gt; If we changed it to a Tuesday night, it still wouldn't be convenient. The same people who are here right now would be here on a Tuesday night. &gt;&gt; The same people who are here right now would be here on a Thursday night or a Friday night. Why? Because God has given YOU A REVELATION. GOD has given you faith that it's more important to be at church on whatever day of the week it is than to be staying at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. It's a faith that God has given you that the Bible says uh the Bible says that uh uh whenever when brother Brandham said this that whenever the church doors are open, I want to be there. &gt;&gt; And any true son or daughter of God, they'll think the same thing. They'll say, "When those doors are open, I want to be a church. I don't care who's preaching. I don't care how many people is going to be there, but I have a revelation that I want to feed upon the word that it's feeding my spiritual soul." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation that's been given to you personally. It's a faith that has been given to you that you say, uh, I'm not going to make any excuses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to plan my day accordingly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to plan my Wednesday afternoon accordingly so I can get to church on time. Is this okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you all do it because you're here. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to plan my day. I'm going to BE A GOOD STEWARD of my time. Um, I'm going to make sure that, hey, if you got to if you got to make mac and cheese for the family. You know, I trust that some of you fathers could care less about what's for dinner, you could care less if it's spaghettiio's and toast with melted cheese on top. As long as you're at the church on time. &gt;&gt; Spaghettiio's with melted cheese on top and toast. That's Irish right there. I have not had that in a long time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Spaghettiio. M. Let's just dismiss and all go to someone's house for spaghettiio and toast. But understand, when something is revealed to you, there's nothing that's going to hold you back from doing it. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT'S A revelation that's been from God. And then you realize and you say, "Wow, my Wednesday has been so hard today." Then you have a little bit of spiritual understanding because in our opening scripture, it said faith upon faith. And so God adds to our faith more faith. And we begin to use discernment that whenever everything is kind of uh going lopsided on a Wednesday, we realize tonight I really need to be at church. This isn't up for question. &gt;&gt; I'm going TO CHURCH BECAUSE I NEED TO be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What I don't understand is this and let me bring let me bring a little bit of a balance to this. I realize that sometimes in our lives that the day can get away from us and that things can happen and we just can't make it. and you know you just can't make it. You know it's not going to happen and it gets away from us. And guess what? That's okay. That's why we have streaming. That's why we have these guys that are so faithful and and and and and the video and the sound and all these different things. It's just in case that if we can't make it on a Wednesday or a Sunday that that there's something there that we can just that we can stream and we can enjoy the word of the Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And help me understand this if you know the answer because I don't I don't understand why people choose to stay at home. &gt;&gt; Perhaps you're streaming right now and you're a chooser to stay at home. I don't understand you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't get it. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make any sense to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know why that someone would choose on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about once in a while because we've all been there and we're all going to be there in the future. &gt;&gt; But every Wednesday &gt;&gt; that there's always an excuse that every Wednesday uh uh the animal is always in the ditch. That every Wednesday you choose to work instead of getting home for church. &gt;&gt; I don't understand that. It doesn't make sense to me &gt;&gt; not as a minister and not as a lay member &gt;&gt; because before I was a minister I was at church &gt;&gt; on a Wednesday and on a Sunday. I didn't want to miss because there's some there's a hunger. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a hunger that I that I hunger and I thirst FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS. AND I FIND it in the word. And I find it that I'M COMFORTED WHEN I GO to church and I hear the WORD OF GOD. IT it comforts my heart. It comforts my soul. &gt;&gt; But now we can perhaps we can put on a our spiritual thinking cap and we say, "Well, what's really going on? Why is something wrong? What's going on with the family? What's going on with the husband and wife? We What's going on? &gt;&gt; Understand, saints of God. Whenever you start missing a Wednesday night service on the regular, something is wrong. &gt;&gt; Because it's not the same as sitting in service. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I believe it. Faith by experience 1958 and this is this is quite a lengthy quote about 10 paragraphs. Brother Brandham says now faith is a substance it's like this perhaps well you found me somewhere starving to death and I told you I was hungry and one loaf of bread would save my life and and you would reach into your pocket and you give me 25 cents. Say here brother Brandham you don't need to starve. I'll give you 25 cents and get a loaf of bread. Now, I'd be just as happy with that 25 cents as I would be if I had the bread. Why? I've got the purchase power of the loaf of bread in my possession. &gt;&gt; Now, I cannot eat the 25 cents, but the 25 cents will buy the bread. And now, faith is the 25 cents. If you got faith in your heart, you're just as happy with the faith that your crippled hand will move as you would be if you were moving it. Because it's the faith is the purchasing power of your healing. So understand the faith that you already have, the revelation that you already have is the purchasing power of what you are in need of. You you already got the money in the bank. &gt;&gt; You just got to use the money. And a lot of times that we're we're asking for something from God and and WE'RE SAYING, "GOD, UH, PLEASE HELP ME and give me faith for such a thing." And God God sends something our way. &gt;&gt; It's like this. I I say you wanted to uh you wanted a cake for somebody's birthday and God gives you flour. He gives you eggs. He gives you water. Then he gives you some uh salted caramel or whatever. And you say, "This is not what I wanted. I wanted a cake." Well, you got the cake right in front of you. &gt;&gt; ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS put the ingredients together. And so, brother Brandham is saying this 25 cents, it's the purchasing power of what I am in need of. That's the faith. So, I I I already I as good as have it right now with this money as I would as my crippled hand moving. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It all depends on how you look at it. &gt;&gt; It all depends on the revelation that you got uh uh concerning the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Now, maybe with the 25 cents, I'd just I'd be just as hungry as I was before I received it, and it might have to go several I might have to go several miles before I could get the loaf of bread. I might have to go through the brier patch." Understand? Sometimes whatever you pray for and whatever you're asking for, it doesn't manifest itself right away. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; sometimes you got to go through the brier patch, &gt;&gt; up over the mountain, cross over the bridge, wait through water, but all the time I'm going, I'm rejoicing because I've got the purchasing power of that loaf of bread. Now, Brother Brandham is using a natural type that we might understand what he's spiritually talking about. He's saying, "You have faith. The purchasing power is right here, but you might not be able to buy it right away. Therefore, you'll have to go through life's journey. &gt;&gt; You might have to go up a mountain. You might have to go down into a valley. You might have to wade a river. You might have to do things that you're uncomfortable with. But as long as you have the purchasing power of faith in your hand, you're just as happy as you were &gt;&gt; until you get the thing that you're looking for. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I got it right here. 25 cents. Ah, loaf of bread is only 20. &gt;&gt; I got 5 cents left over. Huh? Can you imagine? You ever saved for something that you want to buy and all of a sudden you got the money and you're on your way to buy it. You're like, "Praise the Lord. I've been saving so long for this." And it feels good because you got the money is there and it and you can use the money that you've saved it for. It's as good as in your hand already. Just you just don't have it yet. You just haven't purchased it yet. &gt;&gt; I want you to be thinking of your needs right now. Whatever they may be. I don't know. In a congregation this size, we all have different needs within our life, financially, spiritually, the home life, kids, whatever it might be. But understand, if you got a revelation of the word of God and the promises that God gives to us through his word, we have the purchasing power already in our hands. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The problem is the journey. &gt;&gt; The problem is the mountain. The problem is the briars. &gt;&gt; Briers leave scratches. Briars leave marks. The problem is waiting through the water. These are the problems that we face. But as long as you have a revelation in your hand, as long as you got the 25 cents, as long as you GOT THE PURCHASING POWER, WHEN IT COMES time to purchase the product, you can buy it right there and then. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's real faith. And when faith really hits the heart, paragraph 20, it doesn't have to be a spontaneous miracle. As we were watching last night, the man laying here in the cot with a great big swelled up condition in his stomach. And I was fixing to leave and the Holy Spirit called me and I looked and saw the vision over the man. And the moment he responded to it, his stomach went right down like that. And off the cot he went rejoicing through the building. or the persons in the stretchers the other night or in the wheelchair. Understand these things was a uh uh they happened on a on a on a current basis in brother Brandham's ministry. But he's saying now just because that happened here, it doesn't have to be that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said see uh uh it is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen. You don't have to feel nothing. You don't have to taste nothing. Only thing you have to do is to believe something and it becomes a positive something that you possess. That is your faith. Understand? You don't have to believe uh in a word of a man, but we're believing in the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. and every need that we are in need of in our life, it is written within the word. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But we need a revelation of it &gt;&gt; because so much of the time the journey disrupts us &gt;&gt; and Satan uses the journey to discourage us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And why does Satan want to discourage us? This is a quote in uh in in in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Brother Brandham says that Satan wants to take your confidence away from the word. &gt;&gt; And so you got this purchased possession in your hand. You you you've got it THERE AND IT'S FAITH and you and you're standing upon the word of God. But Satan now uses the journey to disrupt our faith, to disrupt our thinking, to cause unbelief to come into our lives. And all of a sudden, we get discouraged and we and we lose the confidence in the word of God. &gt;&gt; We've all been there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints of God, don't be there again &gt;&gt; because there's no need to be discouraged with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because God's timing is perfect. &gt;&gt; He said you cannot accept it by paragraph 23 by intellectual thought. That's intellectual. Your minds will reason. But faith does not reason. If you got intellectual faith, then it's just a reasoning faith. You'll say, "Well, if I only was healed, I could get up. I only was healed, this lump would leave. If I only was healed, I'd feel different. If I only was healed, the doctor would tell me so." But when you've got faith, all the doctors in the world could never tell you anything different. You possess that. It is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. He's bringing us back to it's a substance. It's an evidence. It's real. It's concrete. It's an absolute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, usually we find most people are afraid to accept it. And usually people who have faith in someone who has experienced faith. Now when you accept Jesus as your personal savior, there is not a way in the world for you to ever be saved only by your faith. You had to accept it. You had to believe it. Notice you could get down to the altar and could cry all night long. And you could beat upon the altar and scream until you could scream no more and still you're not saved. You could feel real good and run all over the building shouting and still not be saved. The devil can beat you around to stump on your feelings. If I had to go by my feelings, there would be many times I would be all out of condition. But I don't rest on my feelings. I rest upon the unconditional word of the living God who made the covenant with me if I would believe it. It's not what I feel, it's what I believe. Jesus never did say, "Did you feel it?" He said, "Do you believe it? Faith happens is far beyond feeling. You could feel tonight you're saved and run around praising God and the next morning you wouldn't have any feeling about it all. Then you say, "I'm lost again." But when faith takes a hold to Jesus Christ, God's son died in yourstead and he become you and your sins and that you and your sins might become him and his righteousness and accept him as your only propitiation for your sins. Then faith takes a hold and all devils out of hell can't move it. Faith endures. Faith locks something. It seals something. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham is pulling us away from our from our feelings and thoughts and emotions and and and he's saying, "No, it's faith. It's a revelation and the unadulterated word of God. It's faith in the unconditional promise that God has given onto us." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for those. &gt;&gt; That's too simple. Why do I just have to read the word and believe it? Why can't I feel something? Why can't I run? Why can't There's nothing saying that you can't. But understand, brother Brand, I'm saying you could do all those things and still not be saved until faith anchors. If thou shalt believe in thine heart, hallelujah, that Jesus Christ had died for your sins AND HE ROSE AGAIN, THOU SHALT BE SAVED. That's the Steven version. You've got to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And until you believe it, you're going to be saved one day and lost the other day. &gt;&gt; But when faith truly anchors down, you know, you could you could bump into the people you used to run with and they could say, "Hey, hey, Steve, let's go let's go X, Y, and Z." I'm all, "No, I'm only ABC now." always believe Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm not doing XYZ ANYMORE. WELL, WHY NOT? &gt;&gt; Because I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I got converted &gt;&gt; because something changed in my life. My desires are no longer the same. I'm a changed person. THE OLD MAN HAS PASSED AWAY. NOW BEHOLD, all things have become new. &gt;&gt; And so what happens when faith takes a hold in your life? Your conversation changes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Your life changes. your your what you profess, it changes. There's a manifestation in the life that you live. And everybody else will look around and they'll say, "There's been a change in that young man's life." &gt;&gt; I don't go to those places no more. Let me ask you something. What is speaking? Faith is speaking. &gt;&gt; Why don't you do that or go there anymore? Because I'm a believer &gt;&gt; and I don't do those things no more, unbeliever. Believers do not run with unbelievers. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Believers do not date unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Believers do not marry unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Y'all ought to be shouting, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. No. You know why? It's not just a rule. There's reasons for it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David. How can two walk together unless they be in agreement? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine trying to go to church on a Wednesday night married to an unbeliever? Good luck, Jack. &gt;&gt; Good luck, Sally. Because one is going to want to go and the other one's not. And it's going to be a constant battle and a constant fight. Why not marry a believer &gt;&gt; who has the same passions, &gt;&gt; who has the same love, who's had the same birth as what you have had. It'll make your Christian walk so much easier. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So something changes our discussions change how we think it changes. Why? Because revelation which is faith. Faith is a revelation now is now beginning to take control of this earthly tabernacle. Revelation is the power of transformation. Revelation is the power of transformation. You cannot transform yourself intellectually. You cannot say, "Well, I I want to be a good boy and I want to do this and I want to be a good person." That's not how it works. You've got to give it to GOD AND LET GOD do the rest. &gt;&gt; And when it becomes a revelation to you personally, there's no more uh well, I really want to do this, but I can't. I really want to go there, but I can't. It's not even in the picture anymore. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because revelation upon revelation is now taking this earth, this this dominion, this domain that that I am that I am living within. This this dominion that I am trapped within. Now it becomes subject to the spirit of God because of revelation, because of faith that God is implanting in my heart by the revealed word of the hour. Understand God has given to you dominion not only over this earth but upon this earth right here. And this is the earth that we need to take control of because it's this thing that gets us in so much trouble. &gt;&gt; That's right. How do I control it? How do I CONTROL MY EMOTIONS? HOW DO I CONTROL MY TEMPER? BY THE power of revelation, by the faith of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, &gt;&gt; we see in the days of Noah that the earth was filled with violence and the thoughts of man's heart was continually uh continually evil until it actually repented the Lord that he had ever made man upon the earth. And we understand that we're living in the same conditions that Noah lived in. And we find out that the Bible says, "But Noah in Genesis 6:8 that Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord." Now, this grace was manifested onto Noah in verse 13 of chapter 6. And it says, "And God said unto Noah, the end of flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them, and behold, uh, I will destroy them with the earth." And so now Noah had found grace in the eyes of God. And the grace of God was now manifested onto Noah whenever God spoke to Noah by his own voice. And so the grace of God was manifested by his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you a question. When did Noah find grace in the eyes of God? Did he find grace in the eyes of God 120 years before the flood? Was it when Noah was born? Was it The Bible says that Noah walked with God. Was it only when Noah was walking with God? That's not the answer. God. Noah found grace in the eyes of God since before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; And it was just at this particular time that the grace of God now begin to unfold onto Noah. Though though Though he was surrounded with violence, though he was surrounded by evil, he was surrounded by perversion. But yet he walked with God and he found grace with God. And the grace of God was manifested to Noah by his spoken word voice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What did that voice say? That voice, it was a voice of preparation. He told Noah, "I'm I'm I'm going to destroy all flesh. I'm I'm going to flood this place with water. Uh every it repenteth me. I am disgusted with this with what mankind has turned into. I'm going to get rid of it all. But no, I'm going to speak to you right now and I'm going to tell you to prepare an ark and I'm going to tell you how it needs to be done and how it needs to be built and I'm going to give you the dimensions and so on and so forth. It was a voice of preparation. What was he preparing him for? He was preparing him that he might overcome the judgment that was coming upon the earth. It was a voice of preparation. It was a voice of warning before judgment. You see, God never changes. That before God sends judgment upon the earth, he's always going to send a warning. &gt;&gt; And how does he send a warning? He uses his own voice. &gt;&gt; He speaks. He speaks to the nation. He speaks to the country. He speaks to the world. How does he do it? through his servants, the prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What is his voice? It's a voice of prepare. &gt;&gt; Behold, the bridegroom is coming. &gt;&gt; The midnight HOUR IS HERE. UH ARISE and trim your lamps. What kind of voice is it? It is a voice of warning. &gt;&gt; It is a voice of uh the bridegroom is coming. It is a voice of preparation. Wake out of your sleep. the situation that you're in. Wake out of your sleep, oh thou slugard. &gt;&gt; The Lord is coming. &gt;&gt; It's a voice of preparation. It is a voice of warning before judgment strikes the earth. You know, it's pretty interesting. You've heard people say, you know, uh uh if I was to only if I was to only hear the voice of God, I would be okay. If I could just just hear his voice, how he spoke to Noah. If I could just hear his voice of how he spoke to Abraham. If it was just a clear audible voice, everything would be okay. My life would be all right. I I would be I would be so uh overcome by by the presence of God by his voice that I would do everything that he tells me to do. But yet Amos 3 chapter 7 says that God will do nothing &gt;&gt; until he reveals his ser his secret to his servants the prophets. &gt;&gt; So before God does anything he reveals his word to his prophet which now speaks the word to us. What is the word that we hear from a prophet? It is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we say, "If only I was to hear the voice of God. If only I was to recognize that still small voice when he would speak to me, everything would be okay and life would be all right." LET ME ASK YOU, WHAT ARE you listening to through 1100 sermons? &gt;&gt; I tell you what I hear. I hear the voice behind the voice. &gt;&gt; I hear the voice of God. It is a voice of warning, A VOICE OF PREPARATION, a voice of him telling me what he likes, what he dislikes, a voice of a of him telling me what lays ahead in the future. A voice that he's telling me the secret things that's written within his word. It's not the voice of a man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But if you'll listen with revelation, &gt;&gt; it's the very voice of God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, if you make the man God, when the man went off the scene, you'll take the voice off the scene with him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the man was a man. He was a man used of God. He was a prophet. I believe there was no other prophet like William Marian Brham. And there never will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet, his voice was not God's voice. God's voice was behind the voice. &gt;&gt; It's the picture within the picture. We no longer have to wonder what does God think about this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does God think about holiness? &gt;&gt; What does God think about a sanctified life? &gt;&gt; What does God think about a man uh pinning up the wrong kind of things on his walls and listening to the wrong kind of music? We know what God thinks about these things. &gt;&gt; How do we know these things? How do we know how to walk in this day that we're living in? Because God has spoken &gt;&gt; and he has told us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. &gt;&gt; OH, BUT IF I was to only hear the voice of God from lip to ear. &gt;&gt; I would I would get in my position. I would do what I'm told. I would live for God the right way. My brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; if that's your thoughts, you're missing it. What is this message to you anyways? &gt;&gt; What does it mean? &gt;&gt; What is this message doing for you? Is it just a title message? Is it just is it just sermons? Is it just a way of life? Or is it the life? &gt;&gt; What is it to you? Answer the question. Because if it's not God, let me say this. It's either all God or nothing of it's God. &gt;&gt; I don't want to pick and choose. Well, this part is of God and this part isn't of God. And this, let me tell you something. In Brother Brandham's uh uh the mistakes that he made in his own life was of God. If Brother Brandham said something that was wrong at some point, I want to say this, it was of God. &gt;&gt; Because God does things for a reason. Could you imagine? And some of you are going to get real tight on me right now, and that's okay. But could you imagine if Brother Brandham lived a perfect life before us? Could you imagine if he never let us give us uh insidefo to the things that he done or said that was wrong? Could you imagine how we would feel? &gt;&gt; Could you could you imagine what that would do to us? We would place the man up as God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And even with his mistakes and with his downfalls, because he had plenty, you know, Brother Brandon was a liar. Sure he was. Tell him. Tell him I'm not in. Really? Yeah. Tell him I'm not in. He steps outside. You know what he just did to his wife? He just made his wife a liar. Can you imagine a prophet of God? You know, he could have just kept that secret. Well, &gt;&gt; these people, they they see me to be a prophet and and some even call me God. And if I was to tell him the truth about how my kids are kind of hectic at home sometimes, you know, we have this we have this within the message that everything's got to be perfect and you got to have a perfect family and you got to have perfect kids and you got to have perfect dad and we set this bar up so so high that it's on a table attainable. But guess what? EVEN IN THE PROPHET'S OWN FAMILY, &gt;&gt; Billy Paul WOULD HAND OUT PRAYER CARDS AND then he would go and HOT ROD AND SMOKE AND DRINK OR WHATEVER. Brother Brandham had it in his own life, in his own family. He had issues. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And if he had issues, &gt;&gt; go figure. You and I are going to have issues. But the issue doesn't have anything to do with with your with your uh uh Christianity or with your sunship or your daughtership or your position in Christ. It's just family issues. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And guess what? Let me just let me just take some air out of the bubble. It's okay. You are allowed to make mistakes. And you are allowed for your family not to be perfect. &gt;&gt; It's okay &gt;&gt; because guess what? None of us have a perfect family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; None of none of you sisters have a perfect husband &gt;&gt; and none of us husbands maybe all of you don't have a perfect wife. Had to say that or I'll be in trouble. But let me say this. It's okay that everything is not perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's okay because we feel this pressure of what are people going to think? What are people going to think of my spirituality? What what are they what what are they going to think? And I want I want people to think the best of me. And those of you who say you don't think like that, you're a liar. All of All of us want people to think the best of us, &gt;&gt; okay? That you're a good dad, you're a good mom, you got good kids, everything's in order, and everything's hunky dory. And it can build such a pressure in our lives. And it's a pressure that is that is that is self pressured. It is a balloon that we have blown up ourselves. You know what happens to a balloon that that reaches its elasticity? One more. All of a sudden, the thing goes pop and everybody sees the remains of the balloon all over the floor. My goodness, what happened to that balloon? The balloon imploded because we were giving it so much pressure and so much air that it couldn't handle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints of God, we need to learn to let off the pressure a little bit. &gt;&gt; And we need to learn to realize that it's okay if our lives is not perfect. If you made the wrong decision and and and and whatever that decision may be, hey, guess what? It's okay. Dust yourself off, get up, &gt;&gt; and learn from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's not Let's not dwell upon this balloon that popped. Let's clean it up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where was I now? Ah, the invisible union of the bride of Christ. Brother Brennham says, "And the revelation is the only thing, the revelation of the word." What is a revelation? Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I'll build my church, and the gates of hell can't prevail against it." Faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you. &gt;&gt; So we see that faith is a revelation. Faith is something that is sure. Faith is a solid rock. It's a solid foundation. It's something that you know personally that God has absolutely given to you. It is a revelation of the word and the will of God. That's what faith is. Faith isn't up here that's unattainable and you got to pray yourself up into it and you got to you got to you got to it's some kind of magical thing that happens. No, that's not what faith is. Faith is a revelation of the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Now we find that that uh uh how do we the question is this. If faith is a revelation, how do I increase my faith? How do I increase my revelation? The answer is found in Romans chapter 10 verse1 17. It says, "So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God." If you want to increase your faith, you've got to increase your hearing. &gt;&gt; Now, what does it mean that faith cometh by hearing? What does it mean to hear? The Bible says in Revelation 2:7, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches." John 5:24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that hearth my word, believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life." John 8:47, "He that is of God heareth God's words. Ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God." So, he's talking about if you hear my words and believe on him that sent me, you're going to have everlasting life. But does that mean that everybody that that hears the word of God with the the their two ears on the side of her head, does that mean that they're hearing what the word is saying? Does that mean that they're hearing what the spirit of say is saying? Because if you have an ear and you're able to listen, shouldn't you be able to hear what the word is saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got a few more scriptures. Pilate therefore said unto him John 18 verse 37 art thou a king? Then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this hand was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice. So does that mean that the Pharisees and the Sadducees who heard his voice, does that mean that they are of him, that they are of Christ, because they heard his voice with the natural ear? Well, what does it mean then? What does it mean then that says he that heareth my words, he that hath an ear, if it's not a natural ear, what kind of ear is it? Mark 4 verse Mark 4:9 it says he that hath ears to hear let him hear. When the Bible refers to having ears to hear, it doesn't mean that it's only for people who are not deaf and have the ability to hear words and to hear language string together in sentences, but it actually means to hear with a spiritual understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1964, his unfailing words of promise. I'm going to try to hurry now. But what are you doing now? You're going to accept eternal life. Look what Jesus said. He that heareth my words heareth means to understand. &gt;&gt; So it's not just in hearing the words that we're speaking, but it's actually having the ability to understand the words that are being spoken. He that hath an ear of understanding, let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches. He that hath an ear, let him hear. &gt;&gt; So it's not everybody that has the ability to hear, but it's everybody that has the ability to understand what the spirit is saying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we find that we got to increase our hearing. It doesn't necessarily mean that we have to increase the amount of tapes that we're listening to. Well, if I have to increase my hearing and and faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God, I'm I'm just going to sit at home all day, then I'm going to listen to tapes. And when I'm when I'm at when I'm at home, I'm going to listen to tapes. When I'm at work, I'm going to listen. And when I'm here, I'm going to listen. And when I'm there and I'm going to increase my hearing until finally I can create a world that I can live in all by myself CUZ I HAVE THAT kind of faith because I've been hearing all of these words. &gt;&gt; It's not in how much sermons that you're listening to. But it's in how much you're actually grasping. &gt;&gt; It's how much you're actually understanding. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not how much Bible verses that you can memorize or how many chapters that you can read in a day, but it's how much that you can actually understand of what the spirit is saying through what you are reading or listening to. That's the secret to increasing your faith is increasing the understanding that you're listening to. And therefore, that faith is a revelation. And then you can believe that all things are possible to them that believe because your faith is strong according to revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; As the musicians come, I'll I'll bring this to a close. Faith is not faith is not uh being diagnosed with with with sugar diabetes and then drinking all the sugary products and eating all the sugary food that you can and saying, "Well, I'm going to trust in God and I'm going to have faith." That's not faith. Faith is not uh I'm going to get into my car and I'm going to close my eyes and drive on my way home because by faith God is going to direct my car. That's not faith. That's foolishness. Faith is not spending every dollar that you have in the bank and then saying, "Father, uh, on foolish things and then saying, "Father, increase my bank account." I have faith. I have all kinds of faith that if I drive with my eyes closed or or if I if I do this with my finances or if I do this over here that that if I just have faith in God that everything will be okay. That's not faith. Saints of God, that's foolishness. Brother Brandham says in a quote, he says, "Faith is a law." And in order for faith to work, you got to come by the laws. &gt;&gt; And you can't be foolish in our everyday decisions in life and expect to have a revelation of the faith of God. It just doesn't work that way. You can't plant a seed of foolishness and expect this divine revelation to come and help you in your life. &gt;&gt; That's not how faith works. But faith is a revelation. And you have a revelation to know, you know what, this is a temple of God that God has given me. I'm going to treat it the right way. &gt;&gt; Amen. And perhaps if I watch my diet and I take care of things a little bit, I might not have to take those pills. Or I might not have to do that. Or, you know, you know what's really interesting? You know, let me just use diabetes for example. Okay, we get a pill for diabetes. Takes care of it. Regulates our blood sugar. It's awesome. Praise the Lord. But a lot of people, they'll want to say, "Well, I want to have faith that I can stop taking the pills, that God will heal me of this diabetes." But yet, they're unwilling to change their lifestyle, the food and drink choices that they're making. Do you think God is going to do that? Maybe. But wouldn't you rather say, "You know what? I'm going to control what I can control over here in order that I don't have to do this over here anymore because I'm making the right decisions right here. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Noah understood the voice of God when he heard it. And the voice of God got Noah into action. Why? because he had a revelation. There was never rain that had come upon the ground. He didn't know what a flood was that was going to flood the whole earth. He just knew that God said so. And because it was revealed to him, the voice of God for the day and hour in which he lived. And guess what it done? It got him into action. The voice of God in this day, if it's not getting us into action, my brother, my sister, there's something wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something wrong. It should be getting us into action, getting us into preparation, getting us into our position because we're getting ready to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When God gives us a revelation, he doesn't show us how things are going to play out. &gt;&gt; He didn't show Noah how it was going to play out. He just told him to get the building. &gt;&gt; He didn't show Abraham the things that he would go through from point A to point B. He didn't tell him how it was going to fair out, but he just said, "Hey, get out of your father's house and start journeying." So, he did. So, the word of God, revelation will get you into action. But the faith is this is the unknowing of what's going to happen or how it's going to happen. And that's when we can say, I have a revelation of this, but I don't know how it's going to happen. I have a revelation that by his stripes I am healed. I don't know when I'll be healed. I don't know how it's going to happen, but I believe it's going to happen. When it's a revelation and you've got the 25 cents in your hand, nothing else matters. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you're going on a journey up the mountain, through the briars, through the water, whatever it may be. The journey is the journey. And let me say this, you need to enjoy the journey. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when you know that you are in the the palm of God's hands, when you realize that all things are working together for the good in your life, then you'll begin to realize, wow, the journey ain't so bad anymore. &gt;&gt; The briars, it ain't so bad. The mountain climbing, hey, it's okay. The waiting through the water, fine. I'm enjoying it. Why? because it's been revealed to you that you're in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chap 11. How long do I have here? I got a few minutes. Turn with me. Hebrews 11 verse uh we could read the whole chapter, but it's 40 verses. But let's go to verse 23. By faith, Moses when he was born was head three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child. And they were not afraid of the king's commandments. By faith. In other words, by revelation, not some unattainable thing out here. It was by a revelation that was given to him in his heart. By faith. When Moses when he come to years, he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer after with the affliction of God uh than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he had respect onto the recompense of the reward. By faith, by revelation, he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king. For he endured as seeing him who is invisible. Through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. What was he doing all these things by? Moses was living his life by revelation. Not by some unattainable faith out there. Not walking uh blindly as it were. No, he was walking according to the voice of God that God had spoke to him. He wasn't walking foolishly. He wasn't walking blindly, but he was walking by revelation to the voice of God in the hour in which he was living. &gt;&gt; Can you put yourself there? &gt;&gt; Verse 35, women received their dead raised to life again. I love this part. I don't know why. And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. And others had trial of cruel mockings and scorgings. Yay. Moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned, saw a sunder. They were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. All and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. Say well the idea that we have of faith would be how were they tormented? How how did this happen? Why were they torn us under? Why why this and why that? understand that they were walking according to faith. &gt;&gt; They were walking according to revelation of the revelation that God had given them. That they wouldn't bow uh uh for an easier life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That they wouldn't bow their knee. That they that they that they wouldn't uh uh give up the things of Christ for for for the pleasure of sin for a season. No. By revelation they lived their life. By faith they lived their life. &gt;&gt; And therefore they were written in this wonderful chapter called the faith chapter of the Bible. But yet when we look at their lives, especially toward the end, we wonder, "Wow, this doesn't make any sense according to my concept of faith in my mind." Because the concept of faith is overcoming and strength and and and healings and deliverance and that's a part of it. But yet the part was this. They were walking according to their revelation &gt;&gt; because faith is a revelation. Now let me ask you something tonight. Our lives are all different and and our journey is completely different. My let me let me share with you the burden that I had for this sermon this evening was this was that you wouldn't look at your life and you wouldn't look at the journey that you're on and see the pitfalls the downfalls the briars the mountains the trials the troubles the tribulations and say to yourself and let Satan tell you that you don't have faith Because faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; And I want you to realize that you do have faith &gt;&gt; and your faith is strong and that the things that's going around uh uh along in your life and your journey, it doesn't necessarily have a reflection to who you are in the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; That was my burden. And I hope that I hope that that burden was transferred that you realize, hey, you know what? I got faith all mixed up. Faith is attainable. Faith is steadfast. Faith is sure. I It's not in my imaginations. It's not something I got to work up. And it's not something that I have to try to attain to. It's something that God gives to me. It's a free gift of God. this revelation that I've received in this hour. Let me ask you something. Have you received the grace of God in this hour by understanding the voice that he has sent to you in this day? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. You talk about grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together and pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, I don't believe there's a such thing as a perfect sermon, Lord, and a little bit cut up, Lord. And but, Father God, I I'm not depending upon me, but I'm depending upon you to transfer the thought, Father. And so I pray Lord that uh you would be with your children tonight and that Lord they would be encouraged that they would be encouraged by the word that they've heard Lord that that faith father is attainable and that you've given to all of us a measure of faith that we can use to get us through this life. And I want to thank you, Lord, because it is it is of grace, Father, that we have received this gift of faith, this gift of revelation, Lord. And I just want to raise my hands to you this evening, Father, and say thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the revelation. Thank you for the faith, Lord. Thank you for the work that you've done in our lives. And Father, thank you for what you're doing. and thank you for what you're going to do. For we believe, Lord, that we are in the palm of your hands. Therefore, Father, lead us and guide us, Lord, give us wisdom, Father, in our lives to make good choices and to make the right decisions, Father God, that uh not foolish ones, Lord, but decisions that would bring glory to thy kingdom. We commit all things into your hands now for thy kingdom's glory. We give you thanks in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing this together. Go ahead. Help me out there, somebody. I don't think this is the right words for the song. Was it? Let's agree together that all of our enemies will crumble at our feet. Whatever we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven at the name of Jesus. Satan has to flee. We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Those saints and angels, we shall not be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. For many years now, saints tried to stop us. But the bride of Jesus, she's still alive like a mighty army. We keep marching on the word, winning every battle cuz the Lord's on our side. But we've got the power in the name of Jesus. But we've got the power in the name of the Lord of Satan rages. We will not be defeated. We've got the power in the name of Take the course again. Oh, we've got the power in the name of Jesus. For we've got the power in the name of the Lord. Though Satan raes, we will not be defeated. power in the name of the Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never offered a victory without fighting. But he said help won't always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in. Just hold on. Show up and he will take you through the fire. Sing it again. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never offered a victory without fighting. He said help would always come in time.
