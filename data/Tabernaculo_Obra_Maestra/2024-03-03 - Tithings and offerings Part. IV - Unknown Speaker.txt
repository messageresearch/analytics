interpret in English I'm going speak to you in English if you could please stand for the reading of the word we're speaking on the subject of tithes and offerings and we're going to start in the book ofre Hebrews Hebrews chap 7 and we're going to uh begin at verse 9 and this is the fourth part and we expect that the Lord will add His blessings and he continue Opening Our so that we can see the eyes of our understanding so that we can know how better how to serve him not in legalism but by the grace of God that he's extended to each one of us and the book of Hebrews uh chapter 7 and this is how it's read in verse n and as I may so say Levi also who receiveth ties paid ties and Abraham let's pray our blessed Heavenly Father we give you thanks once again add your blessings uh to the word this morning bring to our hearts Revelation that we can serve you with our whole heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you can be seated Hebrews chap 7 ver9 we're going to read it once more and as as I may so say Levi also who receiveth ties paid ties in Abraham now we know that this is hundreds of years after the law uh hundreds of years before for the law sorry uh God instructed a order of of his Commandments of his word before he had a priesthood he ordered that those that were going to participate in the priesthood they were not only going to receive tithes that not only were they going to receive tithes but the the ministry was going to pay tithes that this Commandment that the Lord brought here it was before the law it was God putting everything in order and this commandment it was it was um firm and even before the law under the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ in this new testament it it be it it it continues the same because it went before the law it went through during the law still firm after the law it was a Commandment that lord said those that receive tithes they would also pay tithes this was a commandment from the very beginning this isn't legalistic this is an order from denomination this is an order that God put from the beginning um chapter 18 okay Leviticus 18 excuse me okay Le Leviticus chapter 18 verse okay one moment please no just bear with us please Leviticus 1825 26 or 25 and 26 that's how does yours read 18 uh okay but I don't I don't I didn't write down that what book it was in I think it's Leviticus let me look it is I believe Leviticus 18:25 let me check that okay no it isn't is okay yeah it's a different book Deuteronomy no pcia chap 18 bear with me um Numbers chapter 18 verse 24 okay 25 okay verse 25 and 26 and thus speak unto the Levites and say unto them when you take of the children of Israel the tithes and which I have given you from them for your inheritance then you shall offer up and heave offering of it for the Lord even a tenth part of the tithe and this is your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as were the corn of the threshing floor thus you also shall offer a heave offering unto the Lord of all your tithes your tithes which ye so which you receive of the children of Israel what God had put in order even before Levi was born when he was still in the loins of Abraham that he paid tithes unto MHC even in the loins of Abraham this was a a principle that God was putting that each one that was going to receive tithes was also going to pay tithes even before the law it was already in the mind of God it was already it was already done ver 18 verse 28 um speaking unto the tribe of Levi the uh priests thus you also shall offer an heal offering unto the Lord of all your tithes God is speaking unto Moses the same word to those to that are to receive TI also going to pay ties and we you okay I'm sorry 28 thus you shall also have shall offer an a heave offering unto the Lord of all your tithes which you receive of the children of Israel and you shall give thereof the Lord's heave offering unto Aaron the priest out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of the Lord of all the the tribe of Judah that all the ministry that was going to receive that that pertained of the tribe of Judah verse 29 out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of the Lord and that then it says of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it speaking unto the pr speaking unto the ministry and of all the best thereof it'll be like product unto the Levites I'm sorry therefore Thou shalt say unto them when ye have heed the best thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor and as the increase of the wine press and these scriptures from verse 30 25 to 30 we uh recognize and the Lord being the same yesterday today and forever he never changed his mind when he spoke to Abraham through the voice of a prophet Apostle Paul when he said Levi was still in the loins of Abraham um Abraham was his grandfather great grandfather great grandfather sorry and that he he rece he paid ties of where unto Abraham Levi also paid ties unto Jehovah as well I always thought of this scripture before what it meant and I thought it's God putting a principle and this principle it was to those that were going to receive tithes it was also going to be for them to pay TI and for the tithing that came in one tenth of of those Heights was for the Levites in reality was for the ministry for Aaron and his sons and also for the ministers that would Minister for the Levites and all not just the the lay member all the lay member and the the ministers paid tithes to Jehovah remember the the people that had their tithes bring their tithes they wouldn't bring it directly to the ministry the tithes and the offerings it was unto Jehovah Jehovah gave commandment that he was going to give unto the ministry a portion of his tithes that those that had been brought to him yes amen the the tithing was for the ministry and the ministers were toay tithing of their me of their tithing that was the shadow it was what God put in his word and it was mandatory under the law if you were a Believer a Philistine he wasn't a part of this of this was a follower of Jehovah it wouldn't pertain to him he he wasn't tearing the word of God when he didn't fulfill [Music] it because it wasn't his portion to fulfill it he wasn't a Believer he wasn't a Son of God this was only to the Believers to the followers of Jehovah and it continu let's go to the book of Hebrews let's go to the book of Hebrews chapter and we're going to begin with verse one and this is where Paul um marvelous declaration marvelous declaration and he says that the priesthood unchangeable the priesthood being changed there's also a necessity that also be a change to the law read in verse one and this is what it says this mzc king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom all also Abraham gave a tenth part of all God is establishing a pattern and that is to to tie to tie verse Two To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent neither having beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually if we could see it and we could look back to that day I'm I'm certain I'm certain that he would you would see as he was in flesh in the in he was going to be the same man MC as Jesus of Nazareth one time that God chooses how this man was going to look his face his his color of his his height I know that I believe that was the same it's exact same because the Bible say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever God was not going to choose the body of M MZ to descend a man that was dark with blue eyes with a man with blond blonde hair I'm sorry blue eyes with blue eyes and white skin and then and choose a a man Jesus of Nazareth Moreno dark dark haira uh brown eyes God wasn't going to do that once he chooses something he's the same when he chose to descend in the form of a man to to come in in the in the presence with Abraham he used the same form when he came through the uh Virgin Mary and when he uh came to grow as a man he was the same man that God had used before to have an encounter with Abraham continue verse three without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave tenth of the spoils it was God the same God that made himself flesh to descend to establish a principle in his people through his sons and through his family verse five and verely they that are of the sons of Levi who receiveth the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their Brethren Paul is making it very clear this commandment this principle that he began before the law that God had the same where God had the encounter with Abraham though they came out of the loins of Abraham one more time and certainly and verely they that are of the sons of Levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their Brethren though they come out of the loins of Abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises and but he whose descent is not counted he gave TI in truth in truth it was God himself and to give ties to the ties and offering our attitude should be this I bring to the house of God I give this to God God supplies our needs God gives me work everything that I have he gave to me and he tells me stay with the 90% And you just give me the 10 that's the attitude of the Christian that's not something that we demand or that we should demand in this time that we're living it's in one that a son has to have a revelation thankfulness to the blessings that God has given us he gives to God the tithe and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better that's us the minor and the major is God that He blesses to to bring as as we we can see as we walk in this life we can look behind us where we were and we can see where we are right now and we can see how God has blessed us in a great man spiritually in our our income income sorry in everything God has blessed us everything that we have we receive from the hand of God if you really have a revelation and then bring to me this portion the tithes and your offerings verse and here men that die receive tithes but here he receiveth them of whom it is witness that he liveth because in in in truth the tithes and the offerings they they belong to him that lives our heavenly father Jehovah the Lord Jesus Christ he's the only worthy of tithes and offerings our attitude should be I bring my tithes and offerings to the Lord yes he yes we put him in the hands of a man a steward and that man is responsible God makes him responsible he he acts justly with the ties and the offerings of the people it said that the tithes it said that the ties belong to the pastor and they put a period there do a black period a black period and very large reality in truth it's not just to the Pastor to the ministry the fivefold ministry but the pastor is the one that's responsible unto God to justly divide those tithes to the fivefold ministry so that the local Ministry can be blessed I mean the local um people can be blessed people the ties are not 100% to the pastor the ties are 100% of God the offerings 100% to the Lord and the Lord puts it into a Steward's hands amen so it can be justly divided so the ministries of today they're going to pay a great price how they used the offerings and the tithes of the Lord because one under the law the TI and the offering and the sacrifices that the people would bring unto the Lord like a a cow or a ram like a ram like a calf goat a goat sorry a sheep a flow offering of two birds like everything would be brought to the altar of and there unto the altar of God God would choose of the offerings of the sacrifices of the Levites and the the which were going to receive the tithes of the the I'm sorry say that one more time they were going to receive the ties of them not everything that people bring of the ties where the ministry going to use all of it because if that's the way it was the the believer would bring his his lamp like a rope unto him and the levite would bring him the levite would take him and he would tell the believer there these ties the offerings that you gave these are mine now and the um the and the lamb ENT the lamb enters into through the door of a believer and the levite comes he turns over to the Prest he turn over to the priest okay and the levite say the the tides belong to me takes the sh he goes out he goes out the other door and and doesn't give the Lord an offering you see what we're doing when we say and you see what we say when the ties belong to the pastor and you put a period on it's not like that the Commandment wasn't like that but the levit he had the responsibility to put the Lamb on the altar this burnt offer this burnt offering to put on the altar that there was certain portions that were for the Levites and and certain and certain offerings he would on his shoulder he would take the shoulder of the the portion of the take the shoulder of the sacrifice the shoulder of the sacrifice of that for him and but but the rest of it it would stay on the altar because it was offering and tith unto the Lord and now to say in these days that we live that the ties belong to the pastor period that doesn't leave anything and the portion that we bring to Jehovah you see what we do with the shadow that should here to come there in that time it was it was you were obligated because it was part of your religion and the offerings and the tithes many times it was an animal it was a bird it was was flower different things it was a herb herb but now it's changed it's more modern times now but the principle the same firm the word of God and what we give in that time for the believer it was you were obligated because if you sinned in order to receive pardon you had to bring your offering your tithing to bring a sacrifice unto the Lord was the Lites that to unfold these sacrifices in in the way that Jehovah wanted your could be accepted unto the Lord forgiven of your sins that was the Shadow the type that of something that was coming let's continue reading uh we're going to read from chapter 7 verse 9 and as I may so say Levi also who receiveth ties paay ties in Abraham one says what was the purpose to do to say this declaration for God for God to make this statement to make this statement and as I may so say Levi also receive tithe paid tithes and ab who receiveth the TI and God said this statement because he was putting everything in order years and years hundreds of years that the law was being brought to this truth this commandment it was before the law those that receive tithes that they God would bring that they would have to pay ties any verse 10c for he was yet in the loin of his father when mzc met him if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should Rise thec um Paul said uh to the and after the order of MDC Paul returns back to the original Paul returns into where God put his everything in order in order for the ministry one Ministry a Ministry was going to be under a new order no longer under the order not no longer under the law now a Ministry a fivefold ministry under the order of MC now the order of MC but nonetheless but nonetheless but nonetheless under the order of MC the the Commandment is firm that was going to be applied to all Ministries under this order the fivefold ministry those that re receive tithes in this uh day that we're living we're also going to pay ties also the lay member as the minister under the order of mzc and that order that is the fivefold ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and verse 11 once more if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there another priest should rise after the order of MC and not be called after the order of Aaron verse 12 Paul says for the priesthood being changed the completely changed the priesthood completely changed it was a it was a Shadle the priesthood was no longer going to be the same in this age in this age it was a New Testament law it was a new testament priesthood high priest high priest for the precept being changed there is made of a necessity a change also of the law today we want we want a new priesthood but we want to we want to follow in legalistic my brother it tears all scripture it breaks every scripture for the prood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law but he that receiveth tithes he also has to pay tithes that was under the the ministry of mzc a a PR unchangeable a PR Eternal and when God made this statement that Levi was in the Lo loins of Abra that he was going to receive tithes he was also going to pay them he was speaking a new a new priesthood that was going to come at the same as the Lord Jesus Christ he was going to be the high priest of mzc it was a law that was unchangeable the one that receives tithes that he also had to pay them many times as a minister many times as a minister we think I'm a minister I don't have to pay TI but that's not scriptural no that's not scriptural under the law under the um the priesthood of MC it's not scriptural during the law and the prophets it's not scriptural one once more when he has changed the priesthood of Aaron to MDC back back to the beginning once again for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar now in this time our ties and offerings those are belong to to somebody somebody is said in the Bible that is it's not of the tribe of Levi the Lord Jesus was not of that tribe the Lord Jesus came out of the tribe of Judah that which no man gave attendance at the altar but it's him now that belong to belongs our ties and offerings and You by Revelation give and the minister Me by revelation we we we need to know how to apply it how divide it how to divide it what portion is ours and which portion we are to maintain so that when ministers come they can be a blessing through the tithing and so now the Apostle Paul we read the scripture and him speaking he would bring the gospel to the Corinthians I give thanks to God I haven't received one penny from you and I've invested more time with another people but he says I give thanks to God of the the brothers in Macedonia they saw the need here and those being poor and from their being poor and from them being poor they still gave their tithes from they've made me Rich so I could come to you Paul said I give thanks to God that I've work with my hands to sustain me but the time came Paul as he got older and Paul in his sickness Paul in the last days of his ministry in prison he was always before a tribunal judg like a judgment Hall and he would come and they would come to him bring him another they would bring him food they would take care of him the Saints brothers in Christ they would bring this offering and tithes so he could live and the majority of his his ministry and it it was writing the Epistles while he was in prison men would come to him many and they were lifting up God was lifting up as Apostles and these men these apostles were taking to Paul preaching the kingdom of God and Paul feeding them with Revelation from the Epistles you would take to Timothy you take these to Leia and to other Apostles he would say take this to the the brothers in Ephesus and like that and during this time in the days of Pentecost it was a great move at that time it was a grand a great Revival said that a th 3,000 Souls were added to the kingdom of God and at the same time there was a great persecution in Jerusalem a violence that came to the people of God through the midst of um the Orthodox Jews and also through the Rome the pagans in Rome everything was against the brothers in Jerusalem they couldn't look they couldn't find work nobody would give them work because they were followers of Jesus persecution and the violence was great the Bible doesn't say say that the people at that time were Rich recognizing the great need at that time they had resources to help to help they began to sell their own properties bring the money to the feet of the Apostles so they could divide everything that was needed for the the brothers there and with that said the tithes they not they don't all belong to to the apostle that's not scriptural that's not the truth if it's a portion if he receives a portion correct that's correct but now today how it's established the the the uh church is established today the ties come into the house of God the pastor receives them and he should be filled with the Holy Spirit how to divide them these tithes to the ministry or the work of God stewards just stewards ones that can Bless the people of God with the word of God word of God Apostolic word Apostolic word evangelist Evangelistic word Evangelistic word prophetic word um teaching word teaching word Pastor the pastor it is the responsible of the pastor in this day to justly to divide those ties to bring the fivefold ministry so it'll be a blessing to the people that we can be a people that are free in the Lord Jesus Christ it it's up to you it pertains to you bring your TI and offerings with the attitude Lord I bring this to you if if you are doubting of the just Steward in the Pulpit you need to find another one or search for another one if you believe that the pastor or another man is not just need you should look for one that is that his attitude is your attitude is that your attitude is I bring my tithes to you no no attitude is our attitude is not that I bring my Tidings or we bring our tidings to the pastor that I bring we bring our Tidings to the Lord to the Lord Jesus Christ and with that attitude you are just through Revelation and you never have to worry if you did it if you were right or wrong you don't have to worry if the pastor if he's using it right or wrong if he does it wrong he is required himself he's enriching himself if he's enriching himself he will have to answer in the day of judgment he'll have to be thrown into the Lake of Fire now you're not responsible for that you're not you're not guilty of that your responsibility of love it's only to take have that Revelation I give my tithes and my offerings I bring it to the house of God but Lord I give it to you and the the pastor the man and Lord give him Revelation how he's going to use that money for the glory of God for the blessings of the for the edification for the edification of the people continue chap uh Hebrews chapter 7 ver4 for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood and this is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of MDC there arises another priest and who is made not after the law of carnal commandment in other words God today is not lifting up a Ministry because your father is a minister because your father is a prophet because your father is an evangelist that doesn't qualify you or does it allow you to preach the gospel no no it doesn't changing the priesthood it's necessity there be a change of the law you no longer come to I'm sorry say that one more time you know Minister doesn't come because he pertains to the law of to a certain tribe of a certain tribe verse who is made not after the law of the Cardinal commandment but after the power of an endless life for he testifieth thou art a priest Forever After the order of mzc now the minister is if the minister is not in this order of mzc then you're not a priest in in this order Verse 18 for there is verily a disannulling of the Commandment going before the weakness and unprofitableness thereof the the weakness was this that under the law that nobody could be perfect under the law NE the lay member or the minister person or the old person under the law verse 19 for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing out of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God and as much not without an oath as an oath he was made verse 21 for those priests were made without an oath but this was an oath by him that said unto him the Lord swear and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of mzc verse 21 verse 21 for those priests were made without an oath but this was an oath by him and said unto him the Lord swear and will not repent thou are a priest Forever After the order of mzc 22 by so much was Jesus made a shity of a better Testament and that's the P or The Testament that we're in and that's the Testament that we're in now it's the Testament of life it's the Lamb's Book of that's the the P The Testament verse 23 and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continueth ever have an unchangeable priesthood and under this ministry unchangeable there's a commandment those that receive ties pay ties not just the the lay member but also the ministry under this priesthood in this under this fivefold ministry to say I'm a minister and I don't have to pay TI that's not scriptural to say I'm the pastor that all to to say that I'm a pastor and I say that all the ties belong to me period that's not scriptural but I have a quote from some say I have a quote from the from the prophet and I have and I have many quotes like the devil said unto Jesus on the Mount of Temptation Temptation if you're the Son of God make turn these uh the stones into bread you know that that was a scripture in the Book of Psalms that was a prophecy and what did Jesus say when he gave him one scripture the the devil and he put a period there he said if you say that you are do what the scripture says here Jesus said said better that I I understand the the scripture than the devil and he said he said also it is written it is also written not only by Bread will the Man live William Bram brother Bram he [Music] said I pastored a church for 17 years and you know what he said I never received a salary through all that time because he was a St a just Steward he knew he knew it was a a people that were poor and he he knew that if he took all the money that was coming in for his his own life there would be no church where would the brothers be able to to gather he was he lived just he made he did righteousness he did righteously because he was a man he was uh filled with the holy spirit because he was a just Steward righteous Steward so Len because they they say William BR William Bram they say William Bram said they say that William brandham said the the ties belong to the pastor and they throw out the whole Bible out uh filled with shadows and types so that we can see our the truth in this day they don't want to speak of the Prophet they don't say anything about when brother Braham said I never received a salary for 17 years theh the prophet said I tried at one time to give 90% of my income and that didn't work very well for me and then I began to give 10% and then I had I had problems at the end of at at the end of it all as a minister and now I say the last days of his um Ministry I receive a salary and also brother Neville of $100 a week the year was 19 196 63 62 when he began to receive salary a set salary a set salary and not just him but brother Neville and then that at that time the church was big enough big enough because they at that time they could do it and he also receiv received many offerings too he he was going to get married no oh I'm go hunting mhm he was going to go hunting in in in like in the in the far lands in Far Away lands in Africa hunting in a lot of different places in the world even at that [Music] time like a a hunter so he could unfold the events in his life it costs money and there was many men with money and they knew that brother Braham liked to hunt and they would pay for all of this and this man of God he didn't need money he only needed to um commit his life to the Lord because God puts it on the hearts of their men to to supply their [Music] desires of ministers that are just before the people CL clearly one could be an unjust Steward and and be a millionaire but there's a day of there's a day to pay for that there's a lake of fire to take the offering and the tithings of God and not be just with those under unto God and and unto his people we'll continue verse wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to unto God seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them such an high priest became us who is Holy harmless undefiled separate from Sinners and made higher than the heavens all ministers they to desire to to get there every head of the household to desire to to come to this who needeth not daily those High priests to offer up sacrifice for for his own sins and then for the people's for his own for his own complexes for his own sins for his own iniquities for the people's for the for he did once which he offered up for himself and also for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself offering himself himself up for the law maketh men High priests which have infirmity and that hasn't changed the priesthood has changed we're no longer under the law we're under the grace of God we're no longer under the the book of the law now we're under the Lamb's Book of Life and even though and even though the men are um weak weak men weak men that they need they need a new born again experience they never go to we never you I never you me don't you ever don't you ever don't youever surrender yourself surrender yourself to a minister that hasn't been born again how do you know through through fruits by his fruits that you'll know you have to meditate in the word of God day and night to see what are the fruits of of a man that has been born again that is the advice of a young person that is the advice of of a young lady how to choose a wife doesn't that man choose us doesn't the man choose us see yes or no but you can say yes or no you can say I think that you don't have the Holy Spirit you're not meditating day and night in the word how is it how are you going to ask for my father that you want to be my head in all now the father should be alert awake when the when the young come he should have the Holy Spirit to tell his daughter look daughter this this young man a good man he comes to church and his his parents have been here many years but this young man hasn't been born again it it it it's not worth it for you to do it and when he comes to visit you I'm going to tell him no no thank you for your interest but no the father the father of the house no brother you don't know my daughter she's GNA get very bad she's gonna get angry start crying see you see but you're only going to do it one time but if you don't stand in the gap that be that it'll be her life for 20 30 years that's if her her marriage lasts that long we're talking of offering and tithing but we're talking of just stewards making righteousness being righteous in the church just St uh doing righteous in their place in their homes the father of the of the house and for verse 28 for the law maketh men High priests which have infirmity and in the and amongst the priest amongst the priests they were weak men and the sisters and they've also been married with weak men we have to be men like men strong men strong in the love of God to be uh righteous in the things of God strong to meditate in the day word of God day and night that should be your offering and tithing for your family and your wife you see how you see how this subject is very big in all of our Lives now to finish Matthew chapter 10 Matthew Matthew 10 verse 5 Lord Jesus was um uh sending out his disciples and it says these these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying inst it was not only going to be for the 12 for every every man under this new test under this new testament every man that finds himself as the head of the home every man that is the head of the church instructions for everybody these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded saying go not in the way of the G and and into any city of the samarit Samaritans enter you not it's because when Jesus came in his first coming he came like the the king of the Jews and he only he came as the king of the Jews to fulfill prophecy to the firstborn it was given to him por of the Lion's tribe of the the Lion's portion the Lion's portion of inheritance of inheritance and and so Jesus was in his ministry like King of the Jews Like The Lion of the tribe of Judah this book the Lamb's Book of Life it had to be presented to the firstborn if not it breaks every scripture break every shadow and type and also the Shadow and types it was written in allegories in this day that the firstborn was going to re reject on the cross of calvary the son the younger son he was going to receive all the inheritance of the father you know the type in the shadow in Genesis and when um Joseph took both of his sons Ephraim Manasses Ephraim and Manasses and Jacob a prophet of God his father he was already blind close to dying and Joseph wanted the the um tradition to be fulfilled BR son to his father his Prophet that he would bless them like it was written like it is the C like it was the tradition of them and he brings a firstborn to the right of his father and the younger to his left it was proper it was correct but then the Holy Spirit comes down and when Jacob goes to put his hands on them he crosses his his and he gives the great inheritance the to the younger and the great blessing the great blessing to his younger and and Joseph recognized no father I put him right correctly one to the right and one to the left and Jacob said no no Joseph God has crossed my hands signifying in this beautiful allegory that one day the one day the lion the tribe of Judah and he was going to bring all of the inheritance to the firstborn the chur of the Jewish Church the Israel that when when they reject on the cross of calvary this inheritance this Lamb's Book of Life everything that God had for them it was going to be given to us a gentile people and the Book of Matthew it's unfolding this allegory and Jesus is is showing or sending out his 12 disciples these 12 Jesus sent forth commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel but the king of the Jews it's verse five Matthew 5 that the king came only to the Jews the king of the Jews the king of the Jews only came to the Jews the firstborn son who he belonged to from the father he gave un to them the Lamb's Book of Life but they rejected it verse six but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel not every sheep was lost not every human being was seed of God and as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and then he says heal the sick he gave them a gift of of healing cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely you have received freely give this same Ministry that unfolded in the first uh coming it repeated to confirm to to confirm his second coming in this 20th century verse n he says to his Apostles under this new testament not no longer under the law to these ministers under the New Testament he says in verse n provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses when you go to unfold your Ministries that I give to you provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your pures nor script for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the Workman is worthy of his meat Paul said to the Corinthians in First Corinthians chapter 4 1 Corinthians 4 4 verse 10 he says he says we are fools for Christ's sake but you are wise in Christ we are weak but you are strong you are honorable but we are despised now Paul saw the burden burden of this ministry he had complexes building even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place and labor working with our own hands we being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it he's giving an example Paul of a just Steward for the things through the things that happened to him it is also required of stewards of the fivefold ministry this here first Corinthians 4 verse 1 and two let a man so account of us as of Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God moreover is required in stewards that a man be found faithful in what he does with the tithes and the offerings of the people Lord
