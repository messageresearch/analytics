be here once again appreciate all the songs of Zion the worship of each and every one of you for that's why we come we really are worshippers we come to worship we we we come to wash his feet just like that little lady uh a woman of uh of of of of a bad reputation but she seen Jesus walk into a a a house of one of the of of one of the Pharisees one of the priests but she as she as she peeed through the fancing she she saw that they were not making him welcome like they did all the other guests but she realized that it was Jesus and she realized that it was that that this same Jesus had forgiven a woman just like her a woman who had been caught in the very Act of adultery a woman that that that that that the priest and the Levites had brought to Jesus and they said this woman was caught in the very Act of adultery what should he said what does Moses say we should do to her what does the law say and the Bible says that Jesus he took his finger he took his hand and he began writing on the dirt it doesn't say what he wrote but by one by one all the accusers walked away and the woman looked up and and wondered and Jesus told her go and sin no more cuz we're not under the law no more the penalty for for being caught in sin if you repent the penalty now is not death but it can now be eternal life oh what a paradox when the Covenant changed from the old to the new that we could be delivered we could be forgiven we could be changed we could be quickened God could then even transform us this whole body of Flesh to a theop to a Celestial body oh do you love him this morning turn with me in your bibles if you would and we'll go to Luke 13 Luke chapter 13 and verse 32 Luke 13:32 and it reads like this and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold I cast out devils and I do cures to today one and tomorrow two and the third day I shall be perfected it was three polls of a Ministry it was three stages of the ministry of Messiah amongst the Min amongst the positions that he would manifest in these three stages he says he says I do cures today I begin as an evangelist praying for the sick and tomorrow and I'll continue doing it through my second poll but in the third pole I shall be perfected and so will my little bride at the end time nevertheless I must walk to today and tomorrow and the day following I have to walk through these stages of the ministry for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem and his style of preaching in a parable he was speaking and he was telling them what would what would take place for this Parable was a prophecy and this and this and this Prophet would perish in Jerusalem but this was more than a Prophet this was more than the messenger to a church age this was God Messiah this was the Lamb of God this was the prophet of prophets he said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the prophets and Don as them that are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and you would not Jesus said my ministry will have three poles but they won't see it they'll be blinded they they they will put me to death I will be another prophet that perishes and dies in Jerusalem in Mount Calvary and then he says oh Jerusalem you which killed the prophets and Stones them he says and despite your great sin as a hin tries to gather her children together so have I come even at this time to gather you and you would not God types himself Jehovah as a hen because he had come to a chicken yard of a religious order even as God came to a chicken yard of a religious order and once again as the in House of denomination rejected coming so will they at the second coming but just like at the first coming there was a little flock that was persecuted by that denomination there was a little flock that was persecuted by the politicians and the global leaders so is it again today because it's the pattern of God's word and when you see the pattern of God's word you see God and you see more than what the world wants to do to you when you see the pattern in there you see what God is doing for you today let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you bless the reading of Thy word and we'll be sure to give you all the honor glory and the praise in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated like to read a quote for you and it's found um let's see here in the message 195611 why are people so tossed about and it's a message where brother rman speaking of the tent vision and and the vision that he had uh speaks on the three poles of his ministry and in paragraph 37 then he then he talks about that angel that was speaking to me in this Vision he says and the man which was talking behind me walked around in front of me and he was dressed in Palestinian clothes and a and a turban on his [Music] head he had a white robe he said brother brandom that's it I said I know I didn't do right I said I jerked it when I when I shouldn't have he said don't get your line tangled up in these kinds of times and I said while I'm running as straight as I can I'll be very careful and he said now the first time I spoke with you you put your hands on the people in other words as Jesus spoke there in the Book of Luke praying for the sick and evangelist great campaigns healing campaigns he said you put your hands on the people and told them what was wrong with them and the second poll you would know the secrets of their hearts and I made you a seer before the people a prophet was he always a prophet you were born a prophet but it wasn't known to the people it wasn't known to his family hard but there come a time when the gift would be a Vindicated that God would interpret to the people when he began Discerning the hearts and they realized no man can do this this has to be God and the Discerning of the hearts and the intents was was the very sign that God was on the scene it was the sign of the Messiah it's how Nathan recognized him immediately because he was a well-taught Jew he said no man can do this they was from the time he was a child and they'd never seen it done they only heard that God Alone is the discerner and intense of the heart because they hadn't had a prophet for 400 years and when Jesus Jesus came and he tells Nathan he says I knew you I says I saw you when you were under that tree over there a few days ago and he says Master th the Christ the son of the Living God you're Messiah you recognized it you have to be God Only God can do this be God in you you have to be a prophet for this is the sign of the prophet he he he said now the first time I spoke to you verse per 38 you put your hands on the people and told them what was wrong with them and the second poll you would know the secrets of their hearts and I made you a seer before the people it was that manifestation it was when he began to discern the hearts of the people that some began to say this is more than an evangelist that prays for the sick they said it of Jesus this is more than an evangelist that prays for the sick this man is a prophet in chapter 4 of Matthew Jesus began his ministry as an evangelist praying for the sick in chapter five he he begins not only praying not only just laying hands on the people and healing them but he's now teaching on Perfection Matthew 5 6 and 7 but Perfection is a call for you and I to be be justified by faith because Perfection is the end result of something that God wants to start in your life and without this beginning without this start all that awaits the man or the woman is a devil's hell but if you accept this teaching on Perfection God is offering eternal life Perfection is a call for you and I to be justified by fa Sanctified by the spirit baptized with the Holy Ghost refilling after refilling of that same Spirit our cup is running over Perfection is the end result of this process of this friendship restored with the father turn with me to Romans chapter n Romans 9 and verse 23 he says and that he might make Paul the Apostle Paul speaking to the Romans and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared unto Glory even us whom he ha called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles because it's come to a place where the generation of Jesus Christ was not Israel alone but it was also a gentile people you say brother Daniel did you say that backwards that the Jews first were a generation of Jesus Christ they were indeed for they were the firstborn son when you read the genealogy of Matthew 1 and verse one Matthew says and this is the generation of Jesus Christ then he begin to say and Abraham and David and all the descendants they were all Jews the generation of Jesus Christ but because of the mixing of the seeds then amongst the Gentiles is also the generation not every generation not every Gentile is a seed of God not every Jew is a seed of God but in the mix but in the mix of all these people in the world amongst both Jews and Gentiles there is a generation it's for those that he came down it's for those that he came and presented himself as anel Healing The Sick doing great wonders to catch the attention of his children they would know this would excite them this would encourage them in our world falling apart when Jesus came this gave God's children hope today in a world falling apart to see the ministry that's amongst us not only the ministry of William BR today the messenger is the Holy Ghost who said I'll be with you I'll be in you to the ends of the Earth Christ in us he's the hope of glory for you and I without him there would be no prophets without him there be there would be no sincere Pastor without him there would be no sincere evangelist without him there would be no hope but in him we have hope and and he prepares us daily to move from Glory unto glory to refilling after refilling and he's changing us daily if we look in the mirror of his word and we can't see Christ in his fullness and we can't that's why we must look in the mirror of the word and say through the blood You See Me Lord Jesus you see me cleansed and rightous and perfect but when I look in the mirror of the word I know I need to grows when I look in the mirror of the word I know I need to change and as long as I keep myself in the mirror of the word I will be changed the glory unto Glory unto Perfection which is eternal life which is a which is a reunion with the father it'll raise my faith to rapturing Faith if every day as I get up in the morning I look in the mirror of his word know where I'm falling short and know that God can lift me up from that spot and be the man he wants me to be that that morning all the way till the evening that's the mercy of God so in chapter 4 he come as the Evangelist praying lay hands on the sick in chapter five and six and seven the Evangelist begins toach on a process on a friendship being restored with the father on Perfection on how to be peacemakers in our home at our jobs how to how to apply meekness in our life when we feel the old anger rising up up but the Holy Spirit sweeps in and he says put the anger aside let me give you the meekness of the holy spirit that I displayed when I was on the earth and I was riled against by by the Levites by the priest by the high priest by his soldiers that SLA by the Roman by the Roman Pontius pilot who jerked on me and I pushed away the human anger and I displayed meekness I displayed self-control I didn't lose it so I could show you you too can have control over the Deeds of the Flesh and because I live and had self-control you can live in me and I can live in you and and display self-control in chapter 8 of The Book of Matthew Jesus finishes his teaching 56 and S of Matthew of the Book of Matthew was Jesus preaching on Perfection first he made the statements in chapter five and verse and chapter six and seven he begins to expound and F in and fill in the details of what he meant to be a peacemaker to be meek when R against not riing [Music] backfolded this teaching in a parable that can be revealed to you and I this morning it doesn't have to remain a parable has to remain prophecy it can become reality in your life this morning so in chapter eight of the Book of Matthew the mountain he went up on in chapter 5 in chapter eight he comes down and when he comes down from that mountain he continues his his ministry as an evangelist praying for the sick and the first is the leper and the leper heard his preaching Le heard his teaching and the leper believed every word he said maybe he didn't understand every word but he believed it he believed it to the point that though he knew being a leper that the leprosy would finally destroy him not only destroy him but it was big white blotches all over the skin a person was was was was was the skin was rotting as they were walking everyone shunned the lepers it was a horrible disease there was no cure there was no hope there was no physician till Jesus Jesus came and the leper saw it he caught the Revelation he said Lord if thou will you can make me clean he believed it and the Bible says that it was still the first pull of his ministry so what did he do did he discern his heart the Bible says he the gift was in his hand and the leper was healed it would change it would go to where it'd be Discerning the hearts of the people this was the first B of his ministry and he told him don't tell don't tell any man but go and offer the gift that Moses commanded and be a testimony for what God has done in your life you see what he said first he said don't tell no man and we think because he spread his Fame all over that he disobeyed he said first he tells him don't tell no man no instead go to the church and offer the the gift that Moses commanded and be a testimony to hundreds in the synagogue and be a testimony to the priest because most priests had never offered up this sacrifice for the cleansing of a leper in Israel you know why because they'd never seen a leper cleansed in their whole life it was a generation that had never seen the miraculous healing power of almighty God so when he met when he went with his two turtle doves to the priest I'm here to offer these two Turtle dos for the cleansing of leprosy he says look at my face you remember what I was I was that leopard that you didn't want me to come close now I'm offering the gift that Moses commanded he's telling the world he's lifting up the two Turtle [Music] do and he's going to cause the priest to give glory to God with his sacrifice two turtle doves the priest would take it one turtle dove was taken and it was placed in an earn vessel and in thatn vessel it was killed then they would take the blood out of the earth and vessel sprinkle it on the other Turtle it up they would walk out and in an open field they'd let it fry it was free to go because the other had died and the priest didn't realize that the bird the turtle dove in the vessel of clay represented Jehovah in a vessel of clay Jesus of Nazareth and that one day God would die in this vessel of clay he would represent allmighty God take away our sin was by the blood of his lamb the gift that was offered for you and for I to take away our leprosy sin because we were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity we come into this world speaking lies what could wash the St away nothing but the blood that Turtle do God in a vessel of clay called Jesus of Nazar died that day on C and when he shed his blood MC the high priest sprinkled you and I you know when he sprinkled you when you were baptized no no if you're a child of God the day you were born in your mother's womb because you're a gene of God you were sprinkled with a blood of this of this turtle dove who died in Earth for you and he watched over you all the days of your life that's why you're here this morning he the gospel because many times death should have touched you but you were a turtle dove that's been sprinkled with the blood and death couldn't cross the barrier of the blood to take you away God had a plan for you and I to serve him to love him to stand for him be a witness the doves does of God being Witnesses for him of the leprosy of which we've been cleansed Oh Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved the richet like and Jesus continues and in verse eight he goes to Peter's house and when he gets there Peter's mother is sick with a terrible fever she can't do anything she sick and the Bible says that he put forth his hand and he touched her he didn't say a word for for it was the full first full ministry and the gift was in the hand Jesus the great evangelist in chapter n Jesus it says and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own country in chapter nine Jesus will be entering into his second po Ministry in the in in verse two it says they brought unto him a man sick of the py lying on a bed and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the son be of good cheer he said thy sins be forgiven the ministry was changing it was a second pool he was now Discerning the hearts he looked at this sick man in a bed he said wow wow what a sinner this one is the first thing I need to do for him is forgive him these sins I need to heal the soul I need to heal this son I need to heal his heart I need to give him relief in his mind but the scribes said within this themselves this man blasphemeth watch how he moves into his second pull of his ministry knowing their thoughts he said wherefore think he evil in your hearts you could ask the question didn't he always know the thoughts of their hearts it wasn't he God even as an evangelist correct but there would come a time that he would be fulfilling Bible prophecy and he wouldn't get ahead of his word he was going to be right on time doing what he's supposed to do on the right day at the right time at the perfect hour to set a pattern for us that when he comes again and he does the same thing again can say it has to be God that's come down in our midst again to speak to our hearts and Jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts and they're still thinking blasphemer now he's going to put them in a corner he says you tell me what's easier to say thy sins be forgiven or to say arise and walk you call me a blasphemer but which is easier to say a man with no inspiration just an arrogant man he could scream and say your sins be forgiven but that same arrogant preacher couldn't tell a man on a deathbed arise and walk which is easier to say for God nothing was too hard but he put this question to these scribes because for them in their minds one was easier to say than the other part two opens up the second poll Ministry begins could he still heal the sick yes that never went away but the ministry was going higher but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on Earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the policy verse 6 arise take up thy bed and go into thy house when the multitude saw a marveled and glorified God which had given such power unto men but not just to Men first the power had to be given to a man who knew how to handle the power for power without character would have been demonic but Jesus the second Adam had the character to handle the power of the fullness of the deity of God he was a man in complete control he was the man that God was looking for to be able to put the book in the hands of a man be worthy to open it and to lose the seven parts of that one Divine Plan of Salvation of redemption Deliverance for the generation of Jesus Christ Jew and Gentiles both the Fig Tree and the bride tree this man Jesus this is the man we need this is the man we still need God bless all his go all the god- sent prophets God bless all the God sent pastors God bless all the God sent evangelists God bless all the fful ministry that God has sent but the man you and I need this morning the man that's in the book of this called the Bible man Jesus of Naz he is the Lord Jesus Christ he is Emmanuel and he's still with us this morning the Bible says and as they pass verse n he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the seat of custom and he arose and followed him at the beginning of his second poll of his ministry Jesus Jesus begins to set the New Testament Church in order he's he's setting the New Testament Church he's putting them an order the order began like this first prophets John the Baptist and Christ himself now apostles but don't put a period there because the word was unfolding the revelation of a New Testament Church was growing the order was being placed little by little line upon line word upon word would be adding more so if you are quick to say I got it it's just Apostles and nothing else no no no no no no more would come a fful Ministry come and the fful ministry was a pattern in God's word it was the ministry of Jesus Christ that's where the fful ministry comes from Jesus began as an evangelist it was prophesied that he would be a prophet in the book of deuteron and the book of Acts Peter reminds us of the prophecy of Moses the Lord shall raise up a prophet so he was evangelist he was prophet in Chapter 3 of Hebrews Paul said that Jesus was the Apostle of our faith in the book of Peter Peter said that Jesus was the chief Shepherd of the flock evangelist Prophet Apostle and when he went to Nicodemus in St John 3 Nicodemus said we know we the priests not all of us hate you Jesus not every levite against you like the high priest and all his family members all the political priests there's many of us we know the priesthood by watching you that thou are a teacher come from God because no one does the things that you do no one preaches like you've ever preached before Jesus evangelist Prophet Pastor teacher the fightful ministry was the ministry of Jesus Christ it wasn't something Paul invented it was God so in Matthew 9 and9 Jesus begins to set the church in order he begins to call men and the and the ministry he's going to need first to establish his church is the apostolic Ministry of Apostles but not only they wouldn't do it all but that's where he would begin because the apostle was going to be a certain kind of a man certain kind of a of a personality he would be the man to come and set things in order these would be the men that would transition from the law to grace these were men that would give their lives these were men that would all die for their gospel gospel they preached and they understood that and they were willing and everyone gave their life Peter was hung upside down he said I am not worthy to die like my Lord and they hung him upside down on a Roman cross Paul he said I must go to Rome for I'm going to preach this gospel to Caesar himself just before he went as he was having a little Fellowship in a little fellowship hall with the [Music] Saints a man rose up who was a prophet of God and he grabbed Paul's coat and he said thus sayith the Lord the man who whom this coat belongs to will die in Rome Paul said that's my code and I already know that and the people began to weep don't go Paul oh don't don't make this harder for me than what it already is I must go not just to preach the word in the highways and the byways but I must proaim Jesus Christ at the highest office of this Nation Caesar himself no man will have an excuse for rejecting the blood of that Turtle do that was killed in the vessel on the cross of Calvary and Spilled his blood so you could be sprinkled and the soul and heart set free chapter n God begins to set his church in order Jesus now Discerning the hearts he's entered his second phase he entered his second poll the prophetic part Discerning the thoughts and intents turn with me to Hebrews chapter 4 Hebrews 4 and verse 12 the Apostle Paul he says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing a center of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and maral and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so when Jesus began Discerning the hearts it declared him to the people to be a prophet and more than a prophet he was God himself he was that turtle dove in an earn vessel the dove represents the Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit was placed in an earth and vessel not a measure of it the fullness of God was in this vessel and it's in this vessel that God died because as a spirit he couldn't die you can't kill an eternal being so he created for himself a body a vessel of clay and he dwelt in that knowing that one day that the priest of Israel would kill this turtle dove in the Earth Earth and vessel what they didn't know is when they sprinkled the blood that it would fall on all his children not just the children in the days of Jesus but his children today his children this morning you and I we have been sprinkled with the blood of that turtle dove who died in an earth vessel and who killed them the very high priest of the Church of Israel it had to be that way it was spoken all the types and shadows all the patterns spoke of it but it would be Redemption and the killing of that Turtle [Music] do when we are sprinkled with that blood we're free we're free we're free from this old nature we're free from all our anger we're free from all our complexes we're free from everything that holds us down we're free from the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life when we're sprinkled with the blood we can every day overcome every strong Temptation and be made strong in all our weaknesses and grow in Christ because the refilling of the Holy Spirit as I've told you before it's not a reward for being a good boy and a good refilling of the holy spirit is God coming down and delivering you from every Temptation he gives you the strength with a refilling when you feel like I don't think I'll make it this time lord and the dove swoops down then the turtle dove that died in the earth and vessel sweep down into the room you're at of the job you're on wherever you are and gives you the strength to rise up above that weakness chapter chapter 9 verse 16 start at verse 15 he excuse me Hebrews 45 and 16 Hebrews 4:15 and 16 for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help time of need Matthew chapter 10 under the second poll of Jesus's Ministry the word now Discerning the hearts of both Sinners and Saints he begins to establish the ministry that will that will speak to Israel that will speak to the generation of Jesus Christ that will call them out of the bondage of this church that they're in they called it the Church of Moses and yet they were in bondage I was going to say something but I'm going to hold it verse one of Matthew 10 and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples all all the power that he had displayed he now gives them power his power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease gifts and callings are without repentance these men had yet to be baptized with the Holy Ghost these men had yet to even baptize to they hadn't even B been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ perhaps baptized in water in John's baptism where John said I I baptize repentance and I preached the Kingdom of Heaven is and I'm telling you behold this Jesus he's the Lamb of God but don't put a period there because more would be added to the baptism the power of that turtle dove that died in the earth of his name would be added making the baptism Supernatural and life changing for you and I now the names of the 12 apostles are these Simon who was called Peter Andrew his brother James the son of zebede John his brother Philip and Bartholomew pH Thomas and Matthew thean James the son of alus and leus who surname was thus Simon the Canaanite Sim and Judas es scariot who also betrayed him 12 chosen men with gifts of healing including Judas what of you were there in that day and you're sick and now Judas with this Ministry with this gift Judith scariot come by praise for you prays for the whole family everyone's healed you'd say wow wow what a great man of God a man with a gift but he was also called the son of predition a man with a gift and he betrayed the man who gave him the gift but to you but today you and I might be ready to follow him anywhere he goes and those who followed Judas they finally wound up on a plot of [Music] land see Jesus seen Judas hang himself on a tree and you would have said wow wow but he had such a great ministry but do you know that that was his ministry and his end proclaimed who he was that's why a prophet in our day said stay with the word stay with the word these 12 Jesus sent forth verse five and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into the city of the Samaritans enter ye not because Jesus had come as king of the Jews and he was going to offer the open book and the revelation of the to the firstborn is all the types and shadows of the Old Testament SP Jesus wasn't inventing anything new Jesus was fulfilling his word but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and is and as ye go preach saying the book will be open the Seven Seals will be revealed it's now upon us already then he said heal the sick cleans the lepers ra the Dead cast out Devils freely you have received so this is a chance for you Apostle to make a lot of money what I gave you didn't cost you nothing but you go ahead and charge Millions for it oh Lord he didn't he didn't say that the true Apostle wouldn't do that yes the workman's worthy of his hire but not the Workman that puts a price on his hire he said heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out the Devils freely you have received freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses freely you have have received freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your pures nor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the Workman is worthy of his meat he said do it freely because you receive freely okay then I'm going to have to to take a lot of extra clothes I I'll need to work and have a two or three pairs of shoes I'll need some cash if I get hungry I want to eat don't do that either he said freely you receive freely give walk by faith and I'll take care of you I'll take care of every I I'll take care of every hotel room I'll take care of every meal you just preach the word you just stay true you just be honest you just be sincere with the people and into whatsoever verse 11 city or town you shall enter inquir in who who it is worthy and there abide till ye go then and when you come into a house salute it and if the house be worthy if they're Believers if you see that in them is the seat of God if they welcome this revealed word then let your peace come upon you but if it be not worthy let your peace return unto you and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words depart out of that house or city shake off the dust off your feet the Jewish people were a hard people at this time they had been hardened by the life they had lived they had been hardened by The Bondage they were in they had been hardened because they were under the rule and the fist of Rome that hardens men that hardens women that hardens children and then a man an evangelist and in that world he tells them blessed are the peacemakers they said I've heard enough you see honey why do we even come to this church this morning that man don't live in a real world doesn't he know that the Romans are persecuting us that even the priest abuses doesn't he see this world's falling apart where did he come from the moon no he came from the throne this was God the Father coming to bring to you a a peace that passes all understanding all human understanding and in the midst of a world falling apart God's children are at peace because we trust him we see the pattern of his word we know he's here verse 16 says behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves I know you're in a world of wolves when I told you be a peacemaker I know that this world is a world of wolves so I'm going to give you some advice in this world of wolves where you work where you play he says be ye there for wise as serpents and harmless as dogs it was a parable you think about it and think about how you can apply this Parable in your life verse 17 but beware of men for they will deliver you up to cils they will scor you in their synagogue he's speaking to 12 Apostles he's telling them about their Ministry of what it's going to be like it won't be easy but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the cils Tribunal to be judged and they will Scourge you in their synagogues that means you'll be physically beaten and you shall be brought before Governors like Pontius pilot like Caesar of Rome Kings for my sake for Testimony against and the Gentiles but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what you shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak it was a prophecy of the third pole of the ministry of Jesus and his Apostles the five Ministry a parable and The Parables of Jesus were all prophecies and most of them were becoming history the moment he was speaking them but they couldn't see it their eyes had been blinded oh God Open the Eyes of our understanding for we're living in the last moments we're living at the end time for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you then Jesus goes on all in Parables and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the Father the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death and you shall be hated of all men for my name sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved this just wasn't a parable and Prophecy in the days of Jesus this was a parable and prophecy that is still unfolding amongst the Jewish people today they'll be hated of all men for my name sake the old name but he that endureth to the end when he sends Moses and Elijah after he's raptured a bride those that endure to the end a little a little flock of Jews 144,000 those are the ones that will be saved like a little bride today a little flock amongst a gentile people those are the ones that are going to be saved oh may we be a part of that little group that's saved that's quickened that's changed will be translated by the power of spirit then he says but when they persecute you in this city stand your around and show them who you are no he didn't say that he said no flee ye into another city oh no brother Daniel you don't know me I ain't scared of nobody I face anybody down I ain't scared of nobody Jesus said but when they persecute you in this city I know you ain't scared of nobody to do violence but I want you to flee in another city because I don't want you to be a man of violence because that means you're Anointed with demon power I want to anoint you with the Holy Ghost and in him Jesus was found no violence the words of Isaiah in Isaiah 53 so if you're Anointed with even a measure of that fullness of God that Jesus you too will not be a man of violence the flesh wants to be but the Born Again believer and Christ in US overcomes his flesh the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his Lord it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his Lord if they have called The Master of the House be elub how much more shall they call them of his household fear them not therefore the disciples weren't running into another city because of fear the disciples went to another city because of obedience to Jesus Christ to almighty God for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known what I tell you in darkness what I'm telling you in the darkness of L that speak ye in light in your churches that the book is open and the Seven Seals which is seven parts of one beautiful plan of God sprinking sprink King you with the blood of that turtle dove that died in a vessel of clay that vessel of clay was Christ the turtle dove represented God in ch God In This Man Called Jesus it was God he was Emanuel but to die he needed to become man and when he spilled his blood then he sprinkled you you didn't know it I didn't know it when we were lost in sin but even then we were sprinkled with the blood that's why when death came so close to you the devil couldn't take you because he couldn't break through the barrier of the blood to take you then we had fear now we know we're covered with the blood of Jesus now he takes all fear away and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul verse 28 rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell then he goes on always in parables are not Two Sparrows sold for a faring and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father a faring today would be worth like one tenth of a penny it's nothing so it's almost he's saying are not Two Sparrows who are worth almost nothing and one falls to the ground and God sees that that bird fall it has value to him he says but the very hairs of your head are all numbered but the very hairs of your head are numbered that's how much he values you that's how well he knows you and he wants you and I to come to know him the same way a friendship restored with the father is our hope our deliverance it's our Born Again experience the of the Holy Ghost fear ye not therefore verse 31 you of more value than many sparrows whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will I confess My Father which is in heav but whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven and The Parables continued on Jesus speaking each Parable was a prophecy that had a beginning in the days of Jesus many of his Parables had to do with Israel she's the eldest son the youngest son was a New Testament Church it was all prophetic but it was all in Parables and there was a reason the prophet said the book of Psalms Messiah would come he would speak in Parables and without a parable he would not speak but in Parables he would he would speak things that had been hidden since the foundation of the world he would speak things that only the ears of Adam had ever heard and now you and I today this morning are hearing those things he said my word will not return people that will complete will fulfill this word that will live it and will be changed and will be quickened and will inherit eternal life and you can make redemption's claim on every loved one and don't let go of it and God will give you the desires of your hearts verse 41 and 42 I'm closing he that receiveth a prophet name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward I believe Jesus was not just speaking of all prophets but I believe Jesus was speaking more of himself he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet how about if you receive this prophet in the name of Jesus Christ then there's a reward he that receiveth Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ shall receive the reward that Jesus has for you eternal life what greater Prophet to receive what greater name to receive him in what greater reward could there be and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man who is righteous you I one of the prophets Jesus we are righteous through the blood of Jesus Christ he alone is the righteous one he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous shall receive a righteous man's I believe Jesus was speaking of himself for there is no righteous man for there is no righteous man with a greater reward than this man our Lord Jesus Christ in closing and and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these my little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple barely I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward as we stand to our feet this each and every one this morning has a reward given of God you can't lose it because because you didn't pay for it you can't lose it because you missed the payment the price has been paid in full and to whom that believeth all things are possible the price has already been paid the turtle dove in the in the vessel of clay has paid the price and the blood has been shed and you are the turtle duve sprinkled with the blood of Jesus now I say to you to continue to challenge your faith now let's go out that door and let's act like it let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you from Earth's humble Shores we thank you that you've forgiven us all our sins we thank you that you've washed Us in the blood of Jesus now we ask you for the Holy Ghost strength to live a life worthy of the
