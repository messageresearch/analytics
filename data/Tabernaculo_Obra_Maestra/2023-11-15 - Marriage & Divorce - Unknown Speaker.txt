other's presence here with Saints of light precious Faith washed in the blood of Jesus preparing we we are the bride of Christ and the bride of Christ is his wife and the bride is the wife adorning herself getting her wedding garment ready for for that day of the of a catching away so the marriage is taking place here even now but but as as as as the bride of Christ as the body of Christ it's it's a many membered body because his bride is Supernatural it's not just one person it's everyone who can believe and and surrender their lives to Jesus Christ through a born again experience it makes you part of that number part of the Bride of Jesus Christ and yet God doesn't deal with his bride as a group she she's identified as a group but he deals with you as an individual because he wants you to have a personal experience with him not not a group experience that uh that I belong toab or I'm a Catholic and I'm part of the Catholic church or I'm Pentecostal I'm part of this Pentecostal denomination no no no go God God doesn't see any of that he looks past all of that and he's looking in your heart your heart is surrendered to him not surrendered to a denomination not surrendered to to a certain church but a heart fully given to him one that's repented that that has repented and been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then he said when you come out of that water a heart truly repented there is a supernatural baptism that takes place it's called the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why you're still serving him today because of that Supernatural baptism and he said I'll give you refilling after refilling after refilling that'll help you to grow unto the stature of a perfect man a perfect woman and Perfection is the end goal and we all begin bless said are the poor in spirit that come to the feet of Jesus a broken human being and he lifts us up when we repent you love him this morning just a couple of announcements first of all we're happy to have uh the Clayville family with us here most of you know them my son-in-law Chris Chris my daughtera and uh my my grandchildren Anthony who come up and sang Titus played the piano of course it makes us very proud and U and and my little granddaughter allur that she didn't sing and and she didn't play the piano but I've already given her half of my kingdom just because she's so sweet so we're happy to have him here tonight bless their hearts brother joh Jonathan mentioned to me tonight that we probably won't be seeing him too much on Sundays between now and January sometime uh he's had some invitations the go so if you don't see him uh know that he's somewhere ministering the gospel prayers with with him and his family God um turn with me in your Bibles and we'll be [Music] reading we'll be reading in first Thessalonians chapter 4 and we'll be beginning at at verse one 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse one and it reads like this furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as he have received us of of us how ye ought to walk and to please God so ye would abound more and more for you know what commandment we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor Holiness was a huge struggle in the days of Paul Holiness was a huge struggle in the days when John the Baptist was on the scene you might say they had ceased to struggle they they had ceased to struggle for Holiness and they were living in fornication and adulter and Paul a great prophet of God sees the great need in the people not only the Pagan world but but the the but the Jewish people and he begins to address this issue this Grievious problem amongst the people verse four that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concupisent even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any way in other words he's talking about a man taking another man's wife he said because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified and then in verse seven he says for God hath not called us unto uncleanness but un to holiness a message to the world today because the world is unclean vulgar Wicked fornication and adultery runs in every home in every Church in every place let's pray heavenly father we thank you now that you're setting us free and opening the eyes of our understanding that we might give our lives to the we ask it now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated for a title that we'd like to speak on for the next few Services marriage and divorce in our day and the subject to address this in the mouth of two or three Witnesses because it's a it's a it's a Bible principle and it's it was it was from the Old Testament and it carries over this Bible principle into a new testament into a new covenant there's there's few things in the Old Testament there there's few things that there's few things that carry over there's few there's few of them few there are there are a few things in the Old Testament that that carry over into the new from old to new but this is the principle this is one of those things that was thus saith the Lord in the Old Testament thus sayith the Lord in the New Testament marriage and divorce this message that brother Brandon preached has 326 paragraphs and you can you can you cannot take one sentence or one paragraph and and think you have a true Revelation this message as all messages that were ministered by this Prophet were to provoke you and I to go back to the scriptures the Bible because the Bible is God's book The Bible and the Bible alone where the mysteries of God are laying where truth alone can be found in this subject using a Bible principle a truth once more is in the mouth of two or three witnesses there are three Witnesses in this great truth and if you don't bring up all three Witnesses together you'll not have the complete truth if we were to be standing before a in a in a in a courtroom and and and a trial was taking place and and and there is a person who is the accused they call it the defendant then they have the prosecutors and and uh the defendant and the one who's defending this person they we have three Witnesses by which we can prove that this man is innocent now if they don't allow these three witnesses to come forward three eyewitnesses then then they'll never know the truth of what took place so that's what we have here in in in this in this uh teaching of of marriage and divorce we have three Witnesses three witnesses can this great truth and we must bring them all together to have the complete truth Jesus Christ himself is one of those Witnesses and what he spoke in his Earthly Ministry then in the form of the Holy Spirit he gives Paul a great prophet an apostle another portion then once again the great Holy Spirit Jehovah God also uses Moses as one of these Witnesses then he brings forth a prophet in this 20th century to take all these loose ends and bring them together to bring together all these Bible truths that have been lay in the Book of Genesis that have been laying in this new testament things that Jesus said things that Moses said things that Paul said to give us the understanding truth and and yet even with this truth of marriage and divorce it it allows us to share with young couples how to have a better beginning so they can have a better end but of course people who have compromised their lives then then the the the the answer the answer is still God's word and the true answer makes them to understand and the the mess that their lives are in but nonetheless it it doesn't fix what they've already done but there can be forgiveness of course there is forgiveness so a man and a woman that their lives have been destroyed with foration and adultery there's there's definitely forgiveness available there's salvation available but all that a man and a woman soul that shall they reap so they they can come back to God if their lives to God but the things that they've done will have a longlasting negative effect on their lives and if they have children on their children's lives that is inevitable for the seeds that we plant once they grow and give fruit we've got to deal with that fruit and sometimes that's not pleasant so so the truth of marriage and divorce is is first and foremost for those who have yet not tangled up their lives with all kinds of ungodliness and of course when you preach that truth then it makes those whose lives have been compromised uncomfortable to hear the truth but those whose lives are compromised you must let us as ministers preach the truth to save an upcoming Young Generation so they don't have to suffer the consequences that many men and women today are still suffering so it's not said to hurt people who have made terrible mistakes but said to save and teach a younger generation how to have a better beginning in so that they can have a better ending in their relationship so it must be said it must be spoken from Genesis to Revelations the truths have always been in the Bible it simply took a prophetic gift to pull them together for the Bride of Jesus Christ for believers and it will take a prophetic Insight in your own life personally to catch it Revelations 2 and verse 7 says he says it's it was the end of the Ephesian Church age and this is a statement that's used at the end of each Church age and the first time this this statement was used was Jesus in Matthew 11 when Jesus was preaching the opening of the first seal the ride of the first Rising his first coming and the opening of Gentile Church ages and Jesus made this statement and this statement is placed in Revelations 2 in every Church age from Ephesus to LA and Revelations 2:7 says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the mid of the paradise of God so who is the revealer then the Holy Spirit the Lamb of God Jesus Christ the son of God William brandham Willam didn't add anything new as he told us himself for the Bible was a complete book already he said the ministry of the seventh angel was to bring all these loose ends together that are already written in the Bible but it took someone God sending a prophet and he told us he would send prophets we we read it last service in Matthew 23 about verse 3435 long after John the Baptist was dead it could have been months a year later John John had been beheaded by Herod the Great and Jesus said long after John is dead I will send you prophets wise men scribes because every time the devil kills one of God's men God's raising up another one to keep the word flowing to his people to inspire them to seek Revelation Matthew 19 let's read we're going to read from verse 1 to verse 12 bear with us in this reading Matthew 19 and verse one and it reads like this and it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these sayings he departed from Galilee and came into the coast of Judea Beyond Jordan and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there it was a great healing Revival that Jesus had begun and it was prophesied it would be so in Matthew 4 Jesus's Ministry begins and he's an evangelist praying for the sick and thousands are coming to his prayer meetings thousands are being healed it was the beginning of the ministry of the son of man Jesus a prophet a god Prophet Jesus a prophet of the prophets that's what the term son of man implied that when God came in flesh and made himself a body of Flesh it would be God living in this body not three Gods one God with three manifestations the son the Father the Holy Spirit but not three people that's Pagan belief to believe in many God but one God with three manifestations three distinct Ministries but the same person so here in Matthew 19 and the and verse two and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there the Pharisees also came unto him but for a different reason it says to tempt him to try to find fault in him that they could accuse him of something that would Mark him as a blasphemer of the law so that they could try to put him away and have him killed so he says and say and they came saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause they were trying to think of a subject that was highly controversial that would turn the tide of the Jewish people against Jesus and one of them said I've got it marriage and divorce he says anything different than what Moses said we've got him he'll be a blasphemer before Jehovah God himself and yet they didn't know it was Je that had come according to the Prophecies of the prophets to bring change to Israel who was living how in fornication in adultery and their prophets and their priests were drunken it was a vile horrible time the church was a chicken yard the people were pecking on the ground no one was looking up to heaven for messiah to come they were all pecking on the ground listen when the Pharisees came to him they said is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause they asked him a question for which they thought they already had the answer he said and said and and he says he says and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and cleave to his wife and then and they twain shall be one flesh that was that was a sermon at the high points of a sermon that the Pharisees and the Sadducees had never heard before that was not something that was preached under the law and yet it was in their Bibles it was in what the it was what in what they called the Torah the bonding books of Judaism the Torah it was laying right there and Moses had also said this part that wasn't being preached to the congregation so oh they heard of the first and second poll but who preached the third anymore and yet it was laying in there he says and he answered and said unto them have ye not read because he knew they hadn't that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh then he says wherefore because it's written that way they are no more Twain but one flesh then he said he said thus saith the Lord they couldn't deny it he's quoting to them right from their own book but they never touched that part because they had no revelation of that part and then he tells tells him thus saith the Lord what God hath joined together let no man put us under their question was can we as men put put our marriage under and and divorce for any cause and he brought him down he took him back to the word and let them know can we he says is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause and the and the final the final statement to them was what therefore God has joined together let no man thus sayith the Lord they say unto him if what you're telling us is really in the message why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorce to put her away the same thing to the same reason many men today can rise up and say I heard the prophet say this and this and this Jesus told these ministers there was evangelist there might have even been a prophet there an apostle a teacher a pastor the ministry was was was was grinding him down he saith unto them Moses let me tell you why the prophet said that Moses Moses the prophet said that because of the hardness of your hearts he suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and you know why Jesus had come you know why God had come in flesh you know why God had spoken the word and put a seed in this little virgin called Mary so that the son of God God could be born so that Jehovah Emmanuel could live in that body because he was coming to bring change change to Israel change to the Romans change to the Philistines change to everyone change to the black people change for the white people change for the colored people bring them change regardless of your color regardless of your nationality regardless of your ethnicity there was coming one change to deliver Mankind from the forication the adulter the uncleanness that they were all living in from the Kings to to the poorest bigger on the street God was bringing change and he want wanted to take us back to the beginning the way it was the original thought the original life the original family structure oh we're going back by the grace of God because he's here with us tonight to illuminate us to give us Revelation to recognize the day that we're living living was a day like it wasn't the days of Jesus our world was falling apart violence was everywhere morality was everywhere nakedness was everywhere but Jesus came and he said from the beginning it wasn't so and Moses gave you this writing of divorce not because it was thus saith the Lord and this is the way we'll always do it no Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so verse n but I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except prior to this statement the men of Israel could put their wife away for any reason they could get up in the morning and he could say woman I've told you this is the third time don't earn the bacon I've had it grabs his napkin that the wife gave him your divorcees it to her doesn't say nothing points to the door and she was divorced and he'd go to the side door open it bring another one in just like that and there there was no price for the man to pay Moses told us we could do this it wasn't much better than before than they had the law and it got even worse as the years passed and when Jesus came it was a world falling apart it was a religious world falling apart it was a denominations falling apart it was Pagan Rome falling apart it was the world falling apart they said the fall of Rome one of the greatest Empires that ever ruled the world they didn't fall because other nations were so much stronger they fell from within their decadent and filthy lifestyles imal it is what brought the fall of Rome it's what brought the fall of the Jewish people verse n and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever Marth her which is put away doth commit adultery God was bringing great change from a time when the man could put away his wife for any reason to Jesus now coming he said we're going to start walking you people back to how it wasn't needen we're going to start even up evening up the score between the man and the woman when in the beginning the man and the woman were equal and when Jesus came he says I'm going to make it that way again I'm going to make the man as responsible for this Covenant for this relationship can he says at this time I'm giving you only one reason verse 10 it says his disciples say unto him his disciples mind you not the Pharisees not the scribes not his enemies he shocked his disciples because they weren't Bible readers they didn't hardly have and hardly any most of them didn't even know how to read his disciples saying unto him if the case of man be so with his wife then we as reasonable men we got to tell you it's not good to marry the change is too great one of them might have said I got four wives now what am I going to do with them with this change that's come it was a mess but he said unto them listen to this it's a revelation all men cannot receive this saying brother Daniel why won't all the men in this message line up to this truth because all men can all men cannot receive the same save they to whom it's given and it becomes a revelation that this is the best way to live man who will say teach us how to choose a bride teach us how to choose a group teach us how to have the right kind of a holy [Music] courtship teach us Lord Revelation was just now starting to come up then Jesus said for there are some Unix verse 12 which were so bornn from their mother's womb and there are some Unix which were made unic of men and there be Unix which have made themselves Unix for the Kingdom of Heaven sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it and remember Jesus was speaking in a parable so about the time you finish reading a sentence and you think I got it get it with a comma and don't get it with a period because there's more Matthew 5 and verse 27 Jesus speaking Matthew 5 was called the the Beatitudes um and but Matthew 5 is really Jesus speaking on Perfection and when and Perfection is the end result of a work that God has come to do in our lives Matthew 548 you all remember Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as my Father which is in heaven is perfect so that is a closing statement on something Jesus was teaching and the be therefore represented the 47 verses before laying in those 47 verses prior is the mystery of a born again experience of a baptism of the Holy Spirit of refilling after laying in those 47s is the holy spirit wanting to teach you how to be sensitive to God to grow onto the stature of a perfect to to go from blessing of the porn Spirit to enter into Perfection the end goal the Capstone of a believer's life that's the wedding day Rapture time we're caught up in the A and the Perfection is eternal life to be as Eternal as the father which is in heaven is ET potentially you and I are Eternal not this body of fles but the seed of God the soul of God the man the man the woman you really are on the the inside that's where Perfection lays that's where eternal life is Promised in the message marriage and divorce says this he says this scripture this question confronted Jesus at the very beginning of his ministry and it confronted Moses at the very beginning of his ministry it's a foremost question in believer's Hearts The Sinner doesn't care but it's to Believers because the believer is trying to do all that he knows how to do to live right before God therefore if any question comes up on relation and the marriage and divorce case comes up because it's the cause of the original sin that's where sin started and that's the reason it's brought up every time because it's the very beginning of sin when Jesus spoke in Matthew 19 in verse n and he and he said I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication now in one place brother Ram says of course fornication and adultery if you want to put one definition to both it's unclean living it's immoral living it's it's having it's it's having uh intimate Affairs when you're not married to that person fornication adultery both represent the same thing but fornication when you when you start to to to to place it more by itself then he said he says fornication is is is is what Young is what people who are not married single people who who enter into an intimate act together they're not husband and wife that's fornication now the same act between two people married people but there but but the ACT is not with their husband or their wife it's adultery so it's that's the same act but one is identifying people unmarried living unclean the others identifying married people living unclean but here in verse 9 Jesus mixes up the word fornication with a woman being a man's wife with a woman being a and that as and that in itself has brought a lot of confusion so then they say well if Jesus said it that way and brought confusion how will we understand it Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit and that's brought a lot of confusion because Jesus was speaking in a parable the prophetic word that would be revealed later to his children so what's Jesus doing in Matthew 19 Jesus is speaking the prophetic word in a parable and the way we get it is exactly the same he hasn't changed his mind about how he's going to teach his children it has to be a revelation so here Jesus says and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife accept it before fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery so now he mixes up you're putting away your wife if she committed fornication so how do we bring this together because if it's your wife then wouldn't it be adultery but Jesus didn't say adulter so the definition we can look to dictionaries but the best way that God Reveals His word is by going back and here in Matthew 19 Jesus went back to the beginning so then that means that the answer lays back in the beginning but I want to tell you it's not only back in the beginning there's also examples in the New Testament but back in the beginning Eve was Adam's wife and yet they had never come together so when Eve had an encounter when Eve Adam's wife had an encounter with the serpent in the garden Eve was still a virgin and yet she was Adam's wife remember Mary when she was found with child of the Holy Ghost was she Joseph's wife then she was she was so much Joseph's wife but the Bible says they had never been together so she was Joseph's a virgin wife because of the vow under Jewish tradition when you made a vow of marriage you were husband and wife but she was also Joseph's Bride for there was a date set for the marriage to take place the marriage as in as in the as in the public [Music] ceremony so so Mary Joseph's bride Joseph's wife she was given a time sometimes as much as a year and and though it was his wife he would never touch her until the wedding day until that public ceremony so Mary was the Bride of Joseph but even though she was was the bride she was his wife so what was the bride under Jewish tradition the bride was the wife adorning herself preparing her wedding garments for that for that day that wedding day that wedding ceremony where the husband the bridegroom would come and catch her away to supper of the Lamb the types the shadows of it here so when Mary was found with child then Jose the Bible says Joseph felt he had to put her away divorce her how could he divorce her if she wasn't considered his wife she was considered his wife but because he's a just man the Bible says he had planned to put her away privately that circumstance Joseph's wife Mary they were thinking she had committed fornication because prior to the wedding day she had given away her virginity to another man so under that circumstance Joseph could not only divorce Mary and put her away but he could also M take to himself another wife immediately that was the fornication that Jesus was talking to the Jewish men about and for that reason you could put your wife away now you can still put your wife away or your husband for any reason because the big question is today if you're a Believer can I remarry now and will God recognize that will I be still considered righteous and clean before side Jesus gave them one reason if the wife commits fornication which means that before the wedding day that this woman who took a vow gives her virginity to another man and is found with child with another man then her husband has has a right to put her away and marry another one reason why a Believer because the unbeliever don't care they most of them don't even marry today they just live in in they just live as prostitutes and hor mongers they're harsh words but it's true only the believer wants to know the details of how God wants us to live to line up to truth because the end result will as Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as my Father which is in heaven is per and the believer in his heart he says that's what I want Lord Jesus where do I start where do I start throwing all the garbage out of my Life Cleanse me Lord make me whole give me a born again experience baptize me with the Holy Ghost and Fire change me because remember Isaiah 40 what was the ministry of John the Baptist is going to bring what did Isaiah prophesy five things that would come that when the first seal opened five things change change change change change as we stand to our feet and as we pray I ask is there something in your life in for which you want change because if there is change is available change is available let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this first part of your revealed word you continue to bring more Open the Eyes of understanding that we can see that in all our
