happy to be in the house of the Lord there ain't no other better place to be than in the house of the Lord we could be anywhere but we came to hear the word of God we came here to hear him not me not a man but to hear him we can all stand up amen my thought here this morning brother Kenny was singing a song and I know in the lyrics it said the major of our hearts and that whole song when it began to speak about the major of our heart something happened inside me amen amen because I recognized that that major those tables it represented sin you see that major it was filthy all the animals were in there they were pooping on the ground and our Lord he didn't have a roof over his head am man it could have been cold amen but yet he was born in a major and now we have a major there's a major in our hearts here and Jesus came and he went into a major amen that's why that song Amen he came to the maor went to the cross and came inside us you believe that that this morning we can turn to Revelations 3 and verse 20 and we can bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you once again you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord I pray that you would be with us Lord take control of our hearts take control of our minds get us all out of the way let your Holy Spirit have full control oh Lord be your brother Daniel as he's over there home you are the same that you're here you're there too too Lord and all those that are watching online everyone Lord we pray that you just be with them if they have a need Lord but by faith if they just believe all things are possible Lord you we know that you'll make a way you are are Escape Lord I pray you give everybody their portion and help us this morning we put everything in your hands thanks for everything Lord we love you in Jesus Christ name amen amen says in Revelations 3:20 it says behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sub with him and he with me you may have your seats you see us up with him that means to have Fellowship to have communion individual before in the Old Testament you see when the children of Israel when they were in the land of Egypt you know many plagues had happened God was showing that there was a difference they in the Egypt they believed in their gods and then one day we'll get into that now each one of those plagues if you look back in and and you dig into there um they they represent a God that they serve and at the end the death angel comes God gave a commandment to his children they had to get a lamb that lamb couldn't have a spot or blemish cuz that Death Angel was coming to go to all the firstborn babies amen the boy babies but they had to keep they they had to they had to get everybody inside amen all the firstborn baby amen they had to get everybody inside had to apply the blood of Jesus Christ on the doorpost that blood represented Jesus Christ that door was Jesus Christ when they got behind the door when they got behind the blood they were getting behind the Lord Jesus Christ but everybody that was outside of the blood outside of that protection amen that Death Angel was was going to come then when it came the time to The Exodus amen God was bringing his children out he brought them a message and in Exodus 13:21 amen the Lord says that he went before them in the day in the pillar of a cloud and to lead them in the way and by night in the pillar of a fire to give them light to go by day and night and he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of cloud By Night from before the people how amazing it is that when they went through the Exodus God was on the front of them and the Lord was behind them watching them guiding them had not matter if the person behind was a very old person maybe they couldn't walk good but see when that pillar of cloud was there when that Pillar of Fire was there no matter how much of the army of pharaoh was there behind them each and every one of those people had a cross because God was bringing them out and one of those not one of the enemy could have touched even the one behind in the very behind of the line why because Jesus Christ was watching them he was guiding them and then they cross and the waters was closed on Pharaoh's Army they started to get a tambourine they started to worship and it was amazing amen that was a miracle but you see then things started to happen they were they get to a place where where there's bitter Waters they couldn't drink the water they started to murmur against Moses and you know Moses was the type of Christ many people M murmur against Jesus Christ this day maybe they don't say it in their mouth but many times things can happen to us and we go around saying Lord why Lord why but see in that time when they seen the waters were bitter if they had seen what God did before if they realized God can do that again it wouldn't matter if those Waters were bitter it wouldn't matter what they could see with their natural eyes because they know that the god am man that could protect him through that whole way out of of Egypt is the same God that can change these Waters to be purified amen then they got to a point where they they said it'd be better if we were in Egypt oh we could have ate good in Egypt see there were slaves in Egypt see God promised them a land and they wanted to go back to to the worldly life they wanted to look back when God's promise to them was before not behind amen amen and they wanted to go back the Egypt never left their mind and each time the Lord kept doing things for them doing things for them amen even there was a time they seen everybody else had a king amen they wanted a king too says they wanted to be just like the world and the Lord told Samuel tell him that this king would he would be over them he'll make your daughters Cooks amen he'll he'll send your children to battle but it didn't matter they still wanted a king but he told Samuel to their voice but they didn't reject you Samuel they reject me and all throughout that time they rejected him then comes to Exodus 338 it says and it came to pass when Moses went out unto the Tabernacle that all the people rose up up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after Moses until he was gone into the Tabernacle and it came to pass as Moses entered into the Tabernacle a cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked with Moses and all the people saw the cloud cloudly pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and the people rose up and worshiped every man at his tent ain't this something how the Lord would come down he would talk to his servant Moses but yet all those people had to stand at the tent door maybe they had to see from afar off and they had to stay right there behind but does the scripture say he tells Joshua Joshua I'll be with you as I was with Moses amen then he tells a Believer amen and not only will I be with you I'll even be in you you see before they had to stand from afar they were looking at their tent door watching the Lord come down and talk to his servant but see they had to look from afar but see God wanted to have communion with them and they rejected it you see it came to the Gentiles amen amen and no more we would have to look from afar we didn't have to we wouldn't have to stand outside of our doors we wouldn't have to look to see a cloud fall down because this time Jesus wants to dwell in the heart amen but the Bible says that behold I stand at the door and knock amen amen Jesus wants to come inside the door he wants to come and commune to have Fellowship we seeing the children of Israel amen he wanted to eventually go inside of their hearts but they rejected it but see God knew that there was going to be a people that he could dwell in that he could come inside in and he would tell them you don't got to look from a far off anymore because I'll come inside your heart amen amen I won't just speak to the messenger of that hour but I'll speak to you directly cuz Moses was a messenger of that hour amen but see brother Brandon was a messenger of this hour but see he wants to come and speak to us directly inside of our prayer closets amen when we're in a desperate need when we're in a desperation God wants to come down you see he wants to come down as he came down with Moses but he's coming down to our hearts before there was a tabernacle now there's a tabern not built with any man's hands but it's a temple that God dwells in before he would come down to that Tabernacle but here is the Tabernacle of God this day it's you and I we are the Tabernacle of God that he wants to come down and dwell in to tell his messages to amen amen that time when he was talking with Moses that was us amen he wants to come down and talk to us have fellowship with us Amen to give us encouragement when I see that how they had to stand outside of the tent of the door they would have to watch it from afar amen you know I started to weep and I was like thank God thank you Lord I don't got to watch nothing from afar but I can just pray and you'll come down amen he is a mighty conqueror amen it's like Rahab the Lord was knocking at her door he wanted to come and talk to Rahab and by her helping those two Messengers she was opening the latch and going and and talking with the Lord by helping those two servants amen he gave her a token while everything around her fell apart amen all the houses fell down the Walls fell down but where she dwelt nothing happened there why because there was a token covering that home amen cuz she wanted a real token I like rahab's attitude amen because she was seeking amen she wanted protection she seen that God could lead the children of Israel out of Egypt she didn't tell those two Messengers show me a miracle no but she said I've heard that there's a God a real God not a God that I pray to see Rahab she was sold as a prostitute by her by parents she was a beautiful woman am man how much complex Rahab could have built how many times men treated her bad yeah but when she seen these two servants she knew that they were from God she would pray all the time to all these the gods that they had there but they never would answer and she was tired of that she saw all these other gods weren't doing nothing but then she heard that there was a real God one that was helping his people one that was giving them breakthroughs and you know what I believe I believe when she let those servants out and when she had time alone she was crying out to the Lord she was crying out to the Lord she said oh Lord I've been in prostitution I've been all these things in my life and Lord I have a token that can protect my home amen amen why because the Lord was Knocking At rahab's Heart amen amen she was knocking at her heart amen she could have looked at those two men said I ain't even talking to you I want no nothing to do with you and helping those two men her whole house they could have killed them all but she believed that God could protect them that he will protect her and her family she wasn't thinking like oh what would happen What would this happen but she said no the Lord that brought the children of Israel from Egypt they gave me a token that when they come across nothing will happen to my house and she believed in that token amen amen but a door there was a knocking at that door of Raab rahab's heart but RAB all along in her life she had a desperation inside her searching and searching but yet when she finally met the one that can fulfill her needs the one that can take her throughout all her problems that she didn't need to be a prostitute no more but one that would free her from that amen there's a joy that touched your heart it's like the woman at the well am man she only had a a little bit of things to make some cakes she had a little bit of oil but yeah Elijah came amen he said first make me one amen amen and she H she heed The Call by her doing that you see the Lord was even knocking at her heart and when she went and served the prophet first she was serving the lord am man it was the Lord first amen and you could imagine when she would pour out that oil and see that just wouldn't run out when she would make all these these cakes when she would just make and make them and it wasn't running out you see I believe she was a gentile woman amen but seeing that wasn't running out she knew that there was a God that existed am man it wasn't a God Like Her people served but she seen that someone was interested in helping her that someone cared about her needs that her and her son didn't have to die anymore but when she seen that oil being poured out and it wasn't running out see she opened her heart her heart to the Lord amen amen Elijah could have came up to her and he said first serve me she could have just said no I mean I have this this is the only thing we have this is all we got this is this is the only thing we have she could have walked off but she didn't walk off cuz she knew deep down in her heart her answers were being her her prayers were being answered there's something happening inside that widow's heart the Lord was knocking at her heart Lord seen her need amen amen and his Pro Prophet was in need amen we see so so we see that the Jesus Christ he was in in the form of a pillar fire the form of a pillar pillar of cloud amen and you see Paul before when he was Saul amen he believed in God but he just had a partial realization he didn't realize that Jesus is God amen amen he knew that the pillar of fire the pillar of cloud was Angel of the Covenant he knew that was the Lord he knew that was God but you see he just said he just he would persecute anybody that believed in Jesus you see but the Lord he loved he loved Saul he changed his name to Paul he loved Paul and he even came to Paul's own heart knocking but you see he knew that Paul needed to see the pillar of fire see the Lord knew Paul's heart that he was zealous he said you know he knew that Paul knew that that Pillar of Fire was God couldn't be nothing else so here he is on his way to Damascus amen he the pillar of fire comes he says who out who are who are you Lord and he said it was me Jesus that voice came out of that Pillar of Fire and see Paul realized that Jesus was God he said the pillar of fire is the Lord when Jesus spoke out of that Pillar of Fire he knew what everything he done was wrong amen amen then he went blind he have no food nothing to drink he came into a place and Paul PA Lord knocked on Paul's heart amen Paul was the only one that could open it amen Paul repented from everything that he done you could imagine how much he believed in what he believed but when he heard the voice of Jesus Amen Paul let me in Amen Let Me In and he let him in it changed everything in his life it changed what he believed amen and he realize that the Lord Jesus is the Lord and that there is only one God amen amen but he answer that prayer he answered that knock many many times the Lord is knocking at our hearts many times we just don't answer amen he knocks after the heart ain't it sad and the Bible says that there is a door that was open it comes a lady seeing Church age then he Jesus is on the outside knocking they just shut him out but he said I'll come set with him he's coming to the individual he's coming inside our heart he wants in he wants to speak to us he wants us to open it no one can open it but us the individual our parents can't open it for us amen our brothers can't open it for us but he says you got to open it when he comes and knocks he's coming to our heart a personal individual heart Amen brother Bram says as I stand at the door and knock he says he talks about a a picture of a of a man he was an artist he painted a picture it was a Jesus knocking at a door the guy became famous from this picture but he said that I had to go through the Hall of critics amen that these people had to find all the flaws that was in it you see so after this famous picture had went through practically the of the Hall of critics it was asked the man who's who who Who's the one that painted this the critic said there is just one thing that I can say that to find wrong with your picture amen that critic said who painted this and he was getting ready to criticize that picture and he said there just one thing that I can find wrong with this picture he said you have forgotten to put the latch on the door and the petor said oh no you misunderstand he says if the latch was on the outside he would raise that latch and go in but he said but the latch is on the inside amen amen he said the person on the inside must lift up that latch said that's the way it is with Jesus with all of his mercy and all of his compassion yet you are the person that has to let him in amen or keep him out you have the latch on your side amen amen that critic said oh well you got something wrong with your painting you didn't put a latch you see the latch was on the inside he tells them you see that painting was Jesus knocking on the door said I don't see a latch but see that painter said the latch was on the inside that the individual has to let the one on the outside in amen and Jesus is knocking amen amen amen uh let me find out where I was at right here it says what would a man knock at another man's door for what would be the reason why it's to gain entrance is to come inside amen he wants to come he's got something he wants to talk to you about or something he wants to show you when someone knocks at your door they're wanting to gain an entrance or a little fellowship or something to talk to you about he said that's the reason why Jesus knocks at the door amen the church just shut him out they want they didn't want him coming inside and talking to them or fellowshipping because their own ideas came in they made a denomination but Jesus said I'll come to that individual and I'll come and knock amen amen and all through the church ages says here he that has an ear to listen what the spirit says amen amen now for in order to listen to what the spirit says you got to open the door for that Spirit which is a spirit of Christ amen it's not any other spirit it's a spirit of Jesus Christ amen it says uh what would you think that down through the age ages that many call um why many people while many people would come to a door he talks about Caesar and the day days of Roman Empire he said what if a foot soldier living down say in a little in a little place and somewhere where Caesar would have come from he would have came from his Palace and say he went down to that little place of his foot soldier amen where he lived and he would have knocked on that door that fo Soldier would have been thrilled he would have been happy because they're King their Emperor would have came down to his door amen and say he had opened that door you see he was knocking on that door because he wanted to tell something that man would have been so happy amen he would have said great emperor enter into my house and what whatever you see that you want it's yours he'd been thrilled to have such a privilege to entertain the Emperor of but you see it depends on the importance of that person that knocks on your door says I want to ask you something who is most who is more important to knock on your door than Jesus Jesus Christ where is there a greater person that can knock on your door than him and he's knocked on more doors than all these Kings and more than ever and has been turned away [Music] more say many of these Kings can go knock on their servants doors brother Brown is saying that the Lord has knocked on more doors than they would ever knock on he's knocked on more doors than we ever knocked on and yet he was turned away more than anybody else [Music] was that's a sad thing ain't it but he says behold I stand at the door Brown says he says say I come to your house and I knock at your door this one's the door to your heart and uh verse 20 says say if I come to your house and knock at your door and you give me the right hand of fellowship and told me to come in and then said stand right there don't don't you go meddling around my house don't you go check out what I have inside just stand at the door well that's about the way it is with some people ex when they people that accept Jesus amen he says now there is more than one door to the heart he said there's doors to little compartments in the heart he said that's where you live in these little compartments he said if we look over some of these compartments and see what they are he say now think of it what if you come to my house and that you knocked on you knocked at the door he said I'll say come and open the door I'll say come in and and you come in I say now look here talking about giving an example he says I don't want you meddling around in my house he say you stand right there and tell me what you want he says but you don't go fooling around in my house you see you wouldn't feel very welcome amen you wouldn't feel very welcome you wouldn't feel welcome at you wouldn't be feel welcome like it was at your house he said if you feel welcome in I expect you to say come in brother bam so glad to have you the house the house is yours take over do what you want just do what he says just do that come in he said he said he said I would just do that he said come in he said I'll take off my shoes I'll lay across the bed go to the refrigerator and and get me a great big sandwich and lay there and eat and I'd feel at home amen see he said You' feel welcome then he said that's the way it is with Jesus he wants to do that in your heart he wants to feel like he's at home but we got him closed off in a lot of things say now Jesus I tell you why I'll let you in my door I don't want you to go he said I don't want you to go to hell he said I want you to be saved at the end at the end of the life he says you could come in the door you don't got to be meddling around but he says right here he says when you get in the human heart let me see if I I just said if you get in the human heart let's think that this this over they say that there's a little uh um there's a little closet a little door um most people don't want anybody meddling around it's a private room they don't want you to go through that door amen the door to my of my private life now Jesus I'll let you in but don't you go medling around with my private life if I had to stop my card party if I had to give up the pool [Music] room he says if I had to called Old if I had to be called oldfashioned because I don't smoke cigarettes with the rest of the women if I have to burn up my shorts and can't wear them like the rest of the women but you stay right there don't go meddling or with me that's the way it is with a lot of Christians that accept Jesus he wouldn't be welcome in your heart amen he said it says don't interrupt any of my don't interrupt I drink a little man a little bear I don't want you to bother with that I'll let you in but because I don't want to go to hell see he says when he's knocking at your heart when he comes in he wants to be your lord Lord amen amen Lord is to to be the rule to be ruler to have rulership he comes into your heart knowing that he has made he made that heart for himself and all the rest of the body you can have but the heart is the control tower amen that's where he sends his messages he says and he wants to come into that heart so he can lead you and be Lord he says you want him as your savior oh Lord I've done many things you want I want you as my savior but he says but not as your lord ain't that something you know that if if someone were to coming if you would welcome someone in your house just sit down don't do nothing or stand at the door amen and I I'll give you something to drink outside I won't let you inside I won't let you in all the rooms that I have you see I believe what he's talking about is that that's how that's how some people are amen Jesus knocks at the door they repentance that they don't go further they don't want him coming inside their heart and see when he knows everything that's inside the heart but they don't want him to come and take control they don't want him inside see he says when he's knocking at your heart when he comes in he wants to be your Lord amen that's his that's his control tower that that he says you want him as your savior but not your lord so many people say I want him as my savior I've accepted him as my savior you see that's a good but have you accepted him as your Lord amen help us Lord you accept him as your savior but have you accepted him as your Amen to be a friend to be a servant amen a Lord that when he comes he can he has control in your heart amen amen you know I believe the Lord help us all because when I was hearing and watching and studying this I believe that this message spoke to me amen amen I can't stand up here and say like I'm Mr Perfect anything no this message spoke to me because we have to Lord over every single thing in our life to let him have control over every single thing in our life or you can have control of my drinking that I used to do I don't drink no more I don't smoke no more amen but let him have control over being impatient let him have control control over Pride let him have control over when someone speaks something against you and you get angry and you you want to tell him something back you see in in Matthew 5 it says blessed are the peac makers amen amen amen amen and though and all those verses talks about when the Lord is in control of you amen because when someone speaks something against when the Lord has lordship over you instead of speaking something back you get down on your knees you start praying for that individual but you see Satan comes in the midst and many times what happens when that individual speaks something bad about you say comes in the midst then you go on and talk about that individual to everybody else oh this person did this to me that person's this and that person's that instead of going to that person amen amen whether if it's a brother or a sister amen amen going to getting their hands say brother we're close to the end time I don't want nothing to do with none of this stuff that's happening you're my brother I love you it's too late for all this stuff come on let's pray together let's love each other let's forget all these diff indifferences but let's look to the Cross where we both were saved many times times that doesn't happen you see that's why we need him to be the one in control the control tower amen give him full lordship of the control tower when he's ruling in our lives where he's taking everything out amen where he's taking everything out no I thank God one of the best things that that he can give us power over is to be able to get out of the way amen healing speaking healing to existence is nice but for me I rather get out of the way I'd rather have the power to get out of the way to let Jesus in than to receive healing from my body because we can get receive healing for our body but if we Let Jesus in we receive healing for our soul what's more better to be healed the body or the soul amen this body this flesh was stay but the soul will not stay that theop will will go and will be changed and that body won't have sin represent sin amen amen what's more better amen many times people just don't open the door to when the Lord is just knocking amen he's knocking because he wants to come in Amen to have that door opened you see that latch that critic of that paint painter said that that you didn't put no latch the latch is on the inside amen amen you see there a of a parable painting there's a hidden message inside amen amen but you see the individual has to open the door to the Lord amen amen when you read that verse when you see that the Lord says behold I stand and knock and you see that he's on the outside of the door that was open amen it caused cuses you to want to surrender everything and say Lord though many people close you out I won't I'll let you in I want you to speak to me I want you to encourage me I want you to change me Lord these complexes that I have Lord come inside and take them away this attitude I have come inside and change my attitude I don't have to treat other people like this amen amen our mouth is used as a powerful weapon many people speak so bad about others and then the individuals commit suicide because of words that come out of people's mouth amen that's why we need God to come inside take control of our hearts amen that what comes out of our mouth is not us anymore amen I thank God that Paul says not more no no more that I live but it's Christ that lives inside of me that the words that I speak are not my words anymore but they're his words that speak through me amen amen thank God we all got a a race to finish we're all running this race but we have to have our hearts open to the Lord amen or we're never going to finish that race amen amen it's good to accept the Lord as our savior we have to accept him as our Lord when I I heard brother BR speak that I wanted to cry because I was like Lord there's a lot of there's things that I can already see in my life that I need to surrender to you Lord forgive me I need to make you Lord of everything in my life not just open one door and say be lordship over this and be lordship over that no but when the Lord comes inside the heart just like brother Brown was tapping when someone comes inside your house when they welcome in they're welcomed in that's how we want to welcome Jesus come inside fill at home amen amen take control you know all the things in my heart you know all the things I go through I don't want to have an attitude anymore amen amen amen there's times you see I believe that when the Lord has lordship over you you're able to say sorry amen amen I met and known people people that say they're in the message for how many years not many people but the people I've met they have a problem saying sorry when they do something and it bothered me so much why can that be because they haven't made the Lord the leader of their heart if the Lord took headship of their heart when they know they're wrong or even if the other if they know they're right and the other person's wrong they would be humble and say I'm sorry and take that other person and say forgive me amen there's times when I have a little little little say a fit if I don't agree amen when my wife is telling me something and it's something that I think that's right in my eyes later I realized that I was wrong I'll go to my wife I say you know I'm sorry forgive me you didn't deserve that and it's not right amen amen but how many people are doing that these days man how many people are forgiving truly forgiving amen someone does something bad to you someone it can be someone that did something bad that you seen that they did that was ungodly and you forgive them and you go and try to talk to them about the Lord to save them from going to hell but when someone does something bad to you knows if we forgive you know how because watch when you run into that person at the store you try to go the other way you don't want to even you don't even want to run into them you can't even you don't even want to shake their hand you don't want to say hi I've always asked myself what is forgiveness to the Lord what is love to the lord it's easier to say that we forgive it's easier to say that we love but what is it to the Lord amen amen words are words but see God doesn't look at the outward appearance he knows the very things in the heart and that should cause us to examine ourselves amen amen I believe Billy Paul Billy Paul he couldn't tell who was brother bram's enemy he just couldn't tell maybe he would know people would talk bad about his dad but he said that brother brandom we treat everybody the same that's how he carried himself couldn't be someone that talked bad about him but see when the Lord dwells in the heart when you shake someone's hand see if you ever if you ever have something with somebody it was an argument or something shake their hand and feel some kind of tension there go to that person and talk with them don't let it just go like that cuz we're brothers amen amen we're in the same body amen we have to open our door to the Lord and keep it open not just open and that Lord I'm done get out then we shut it on the door remember the door was the Lord was inside in the beginning but then he was on the outside so that means that he can be on the outside again that's why we have to continue and die every day that's why Paul said he died daily he repented daily he asked for forgiveness daily because we all come short of the glory of God so we have to pray daily so brother Brown said the best thing a Christian can do pray and read their Bible every day and then one thing I would say I even say Worship the Lord every day amen amen whether it's with a song cuz I I tell you what I could be going through a lot that day and I'll just turn on one hymn and have a breakthrough but we have to worship Him in spirit and Truth many churches these days they Worship the Lord do you see but there where's the truth they just jump and they scream and they shout running up and down the altar don't get me wrong WR I'm not against those things if it comes from the spirit of God because I believe there's there's a real and then there's a fake amen i' I've been to churches where people are running around and they're hitting each other and they're throwing things on the ground the Lord won't cause you to hurt yourself amen amen he won't cause you to hurt yourself he don't want you have a broken nose there's no way you come out of a church with a broken nose because you guys running in the spirit no amen no that doesn't happen amen amen but thank God for those that worship Him in spirit and truth I believe if there's something that ever causes you to jump and Shout because you have received Revelation from Jesus Christ and that's what caused you to jump and Shout not because people are promoting it because many churches promote it amen but because the spirit of God dwells in you amen amen we can all stand up amen amen amen than we all surrender amen it's like that song I surrender all and many churches can see that song but are they surrendering is the Lord the Lord over their hearts we got to cry out amen and said Lord take Lord lordship over my heart [Music] I'm struggling I can't do it on my own Lord the Lord take control amen amen and you'll see what the Lord does Amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord you are a guide a guide through this life Lord I believe that we were with you before and when the sons of God were shouting for joy we were there and Lord we're here right now we go through many problems every day Lord we can stress still but father it's like that quote said I don't know what tomorrow holds but I Know Who Holds Tomorrow and Lord that's what we have our confidence in cuz we know Lord Lord God that because you live we can face tomorrow because you live we know who holds the future Lord we place all of us in your hands Lord there's times when we we're weak when we feel like we have no strength but you're are perfect strength in our weakness God we thank you we ask that you just bless everyone Lord if anyone here has a need Lord Jesus whether it's whether one of the needs I I'm sure that many of us had is just to take control more in our lives and we thank you Lord we all have needs Lord we pray that you would meet each and every one of them according to your perfect will because your timing is perfect Lord and we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in Jesus name amen amen i' like to uh Sing a Song Josh knows it stay oh yeah amen we all know what it's like to be in the presence of the Lord amen amen and how many time has has there been a time when you're so desperate when you got into prayer and time didn't even matter time just went by amen you're desperate help us Lord to be in desperation every day amen that's such an urgency every day to just talk to the Lord whether it's to thank him what is to say Lord thank you for bringing me through this day a desperation of Thanksgiving amen oh let's just worship I know what it's like to be in the presence of the Lord and not know what time it is because time Stood Still and bodies were healed oh I love
