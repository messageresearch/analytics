[35:51] [Music]
[35:55] God bless you all to
[35:57] tonight it's good to be
[36:01] back amongst uh Saints of light precious
[36:07] faith and um certainly appreciate the
[36:12] song specials this
[36:16] evening that were sung our brother
[36:18] Jonathan or brother
[36:21] Ken sometimes it takes a mountain he
[36:24] saying and um
[36:27] I've I've certainly am a witness of
[36:31] that um in my stubbornness it's taken
[36:35] more than one mountain in my
[36:39] life and uh it's also taken more than
[36:43] one Valley in my
[36:46] life for me to surrender as I
[36:52] should and maybe for some of you it just
[36:55] took one mountain
[36:58] or maybe it just took one
[37:01] Valley but I went from a mountain to a
[37:03] valley to a mountain to a
[37:08] valley and all I can say
[37:11] now is Amazing Grace How Sound Saed a
[37:16] rich like
[37:17] me I once was lost but now I'm
[37:22] found was blind but now I
[37:25] see we appreciate the song that brother
[37:28] Kenny
[37:30] sang but there was there was something
[37:33] that he said just before he
[37:36] sang I I think referring to the song
[37:38] that brother Jonathan had
[37:41] sang he said he said there there's a
[37:43] message in that
[37:45] song he says of the love of God and
[37:50] tonight unknowing to brother
[37:53] Ken unknowing to brother Jonathan
[37:57] we have a message tonight that we've
[38:01] entitled behold what manner of
[38:04] love so I I think it's it was
[38:08] appropriate I think it was they were LED
[38:10] of
[38:12] God to sing the songs they
[38:16] sang and share that with
[38:19] us because I think it was right in
[38:23] line and I feel that God was just
[38:25] speaking on every
[38:28] side and speaking through the
[38:32] Brethren with their
[38:34] songs and preparing our
[38:36] hearts so as we turn in our Bibles
[38:40] tonight to first John in chapter
[38:44] 3 and we'll be begin reading at verse
[38:49] one and again the title
[38:52] tonight behold what manner of
[38:55] love
[38:57] First John
[38:58] 3 and verse
[39:01] one behold what manner of love the
[39:04] father has bestowed upon us that we
[39:06] should be called the sons of God
[39:08] therefore the world knoweth us not
[39:11] because it knew him
[39:18] not beloved now are we the sons of God
[39:23] and it doth not yet appear what we shall
[39:25] be but but we know that when he shall
[39:28] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[39:31] see him as he
[39:41] is verse three and every man that hath
[39:45] this hope in him purifieth himself even
[39:50] as he is
[39:55] pure verse vers 9 of First John
[39:59] 3 whosoever is born of God does not
[40:03] commit
[40:08] sin whosoever is born of
[40:13] God does not commit
[40:16] sin because it's the Born Again
[40:20] experience that annuls the curse in our
[40:24] life that we were born in sin
[40:27] shaped in iniquity and came into this
[40:30] world
[40:32] speaking for his seed remain in
[40:38] him and he cannot
[40:40] sin why because he is now a born again
[40:47] believer in Christ the Bible says John
[40:50] said because he is born of
[40:55] God let's pray Heavenly
[40:59] Father we thank
[41:01] you for the love with which you loved
[41:05] us and that same love that calls us to
[41:09] surrender
[41:10] all we thank you now in Jesus name amen
[41:15] amen you may be
[41:18] seated God's
[41:20] love was from Genesis to
[41:24] Revelations God's love love was was from
[41:28] Adam it'll go all the way to
[41:33] 144,000 who will give their life in a
[41:35] Great
[41:37] Tribulation God's love was from the
[41:39] beginning of
[41:41] time all the way to this seventh
[41:44] Millennium in which we
[41:46] live 7,000
[41:49] years of man's
[41:51] existence and the measure and the true
[41:54] test of God's love
[41:58] it's not just the promises he's
[42:00] made that he's chosen us before the
[42:03] foundation of the
[42:05] world that he said he that we would be
[42:07] holy and Without Blame in his
[42:12] presence because of the blood he shed
[42:14] for us in
[42:16] Cal it's not just because he said that
[42:18] we would be Sons and Daughters adopted
[42:21] by Jesus
[42:25] Christ Bible says if you love the
[42:28] world and the and the things of the
[42:31] world the love of God is not in
[42:34] you but but even so you may feel his
[42:37] love around
[42:40] you you may feel it from your
[42:43] parents you may feel it from your
[42:44] brothers and
[42:46] sisters you may feel his love all around
[42:50] you you may even feel that love of God
[42:52] pulling at your heart from time to
[42:55] time
[42:57] but you can't change
[42:59] yourself you must be born
[43:02] again the true measure of his
[43:06] love if we were to of all the things
[43:09] that we could say is a measure of his
[43:13] love I chose this one
[43:16] tonight his long
[43:19] sufferings second Peter chapter
[43:23] 3 and verse
[43:25] 9 and it reads like this the Lord is not
[43:29] slack concerning his
[43:31] promise as some men count
[43:36] slackness but is longsuffering towards
[43:40] us not willing that any should perish
[43:43] but that all should come to
[43:48] repentance until a man a woman a
[43:54] child any person com comes to True
[43:58] repentance and not under the law for
[44:01] repentance under the
[44:03] law is just realizing I've been
[44:07] caught there there's a penalty to
[44:11] pay if I tell them I'm I'm
[44:14] repented maybe my pay the maybe the
[44:17] price I have to pay will be
[44:20] less that's repentance under the
[44:24] law but under Grace but until you
[44:28] repented under
[44:30] grace then God can't begin to reward
[44:35] you or restoring your
[44:38] life all that the Palmer worm had
[44:44] eaten all that the Locust has
[44:47] eaten all that the canker worm has
[44:51] eaten all that the caterpillar has
[44:54] eaten that Joel spoke of
[44:57] Prophecy chapter 1 verse
[45:00] 4 but from the day you're
[45:03] born you and I
[45:05] both this worm is in US waiting to
[45:10] devour but the
[45:12] ministry of the Lamb of
[45:15] God and the book that he
[45:18] opened and and and it Reve and and the
[45:21] revealed word that was brought to
[45:24] us brings us
[45:27] rewards Matthew said in Matthew 5 and
[45:30] verse
[45:33] 12 he said rejoice and be exceedingly
[45:40] glad for great is your reward in
[45:46] heaven for so persecuted the prophets
[45:50] which were before
[45:53] you so no repentance
[45:56] no
[45:58] Supernatural reward of
[46:01] God but repentance through
[46:05] love when you repent because you
[46:08] love Christ your lord and savior then
[46:13] what's the
[46:14] reward in St John 3 verse
[46:18] 3 Jesus tells us the great
[46:24] reward in s John 3 and
[46:27] 3 Jesus speaking to a Pharisee a teacher
[46:31] of the
[46:37] law he
[46:40] Nicodemus he said Jesus answered and
[46:42] said unto him verily verily I say unto
[46:44] thee except a man be born again he
[46:47] cannot see the kingdom of
[46:53] God except a person be born
[46:57] again they cannot see why Holiness
[47:00] should be part of their
[47:03] lifestyle they cannot see why
[47:07] honesty but we should be honest in all
[47:11] things unless we be born
[47:14] again we cannot see why we should be
[47:16] faithful to our
[47:23] spouses unless we be born again
[47:26] we cannot see what the importance is is
[47:29] of meditating on his word day and
[47:33] night unless we unless unless we can be
[47:36] born
[47:37] again we we won't be able to see or be
[47:40] convinced why being modestly dressed is
[47:43] the way we should
[47:45] [Music]
[47:48] live unless we be born
[47:50] again we cannot
[47:53] see why we should be the people
[47:57] Peacemaker instead of the
[48:03] warmonger it's the Born Again
[48:06] experience it's to bring you into his
[48:10] presence it's the first step to walk
[48:12] into his
[48:14] presence coming to church and walking
[48:16] through that
[48:18] door it's a good step but it's not the
[48:22] step that's really
[48:24] needed
[48:26] the step that's really needed and the
[48:28] first
[48:29] one is a born
[48:32] experience it brings you into his
[48:35] presence and it makes you perfect even
[48:38] as your father which is in
[48:41] heaven is perfect Paul spoke of it this
[48:45] Born Again
[48:47] experience unto
[48:49] Perfection and added
[48:51] details to what Jesus had already said
[48:56] there in Ephesians chapter
[48:58] 1 is Paul
[49:01] expressing details of the Born Again
[49:04] experience Ephesians chapter
[49:07] 1 and verse
[49:09] 17 Paul says that the god of our Lord
[49:12] Jesus
[49:15] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[49:19] you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[49:23] in the knowledge of him
[49:28] in other words Paul is
[49:30] saying if you've been born
[49:33] again you'll see this kingdom of
[49:36] God he'll give you a spirit of wisdom
[49:39] when you're born again he you a spirit
[49:42] of
[49:44] Revelation he'll even give you the
[49:46] revelation of Jesus Christ when you've
[49:48] been born
[49:50] again but outside of the born again
[49:53] again
[49:54] experience
[49:56] it will not come Verse
[49:59] 18 speaking on the Born Again
[50:04] experience and he said this Born Again
[50:08] experience this is what it will bring in
[50:10] your life
[50:11] also that the eyes of your understanding
[50:14] being
[50:16] enlightened that you may know what is
[50:18] the hope of his
[50:22] calling and what the riches of the glory
[50:25] of inheritance in the
[50:29] Saints John said it this way John the
[50:33] Baptist he said I baptize you with
[50:37] water unto un unto salvation the
[50:41] Forgiveness of your
[50:43] sins but there cometh one after
[50:45] me that will give you a born again
[50:50] experience and he will baptize you with
[50:52] the Holy Ghost and Fire
[50:56] a supernatural
[50:58] fire that will be a cleansing From the
[51:01] Inside
[51:03] Out in Ephesians 4 and verse
[51:07] 30 Paul said this concerning the Born
[51:11] Again
[51:13] experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:16] he says and grieve not this experience
[51:20] of being born
[51:22] again grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[51:26] God whereby you are sealed until the day
[51:29] of
[51:31] redemption when you've been born again
[51:35] when the fire has cleansed your
[51:38] heart and
[51:41] mind verse
[51:43] 31 then he
[51:46] says when you've had this Born Again
[51:52] experience he said let then
[51:56] remember all the bitterness you
[51:59] felt remember all the Wrath that you've
[52:03] had remember the anger that you've been
[52:06] trying to get rid
[52:08] of remember the evil speaking that you
[52:11] that that you wish you wouldn't use
[52:14] anymore Paul says let all bitterness and
[52:17] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[52:19] speaking be put away from you with all
[52:24] malice
[52:28] he says now that you've been born
[52:30] again you can
[52:33] choose to exchange bitterness for
[52:38] kindness you can exchange wrath and
[52:41] anger for being
[52:45] tenderhearted you can exchange the
[52:47] clamor and even speak evil speaking and
[52:50] ask God to give to give you forgiveness
[52:53] one for
[52:54] another
[52:58] Ephesians 4
[53:00] 32 Paul says concerning the Born Again
[53:07] experience and the
[53:10] details of what it does in our lives and
[53:14] be kind one to another
[53:18] tenderhearted forgiving one
[53:23] another even as God for Christ's sake
[53:26] have forgiven
[53:29] you through the blood of
[53:32] Christ what he did on
[53:34] Calvary he placed our
[53:38] sins in the sea of his
[53:45] forgetfulness he not only forgave
[53:48] us he
[53:50] forgets but he doesn't forget that we
[53:53] need to be changed
[53:56] and the blood of Jesus places a
[54:00] barrier where the holy God doesn't look
[54:03] down upon us and see our
[54:07] condition but the blood gives us a space
[54:09] to
[54:12] repent and be changed that's where we're
[54:15] at
[54:16] today in a space of time that he has
[54:19] given us so that we can be
[54:22] changed from all the wickedness of this
[54:26] World Paul was adding
[54:28] details to the Born Again
[54:31] experience he was telling you what the
[54:33] baptism of the Holy
[54:36] Spirit and what it will take away from
[54:39] you and what it will give you to replace
[54:43] that evil
[54:46] conduct to to replace when he's when
[54:49] he's put out the demon power in our
[54:53] life then the holy Spirit comes
[54:56] in if we give him full
[54:59] control here in second
[55:02] Peter chapter
[55:04] one Peter is speaking also on the Born
[55:07] Again
[55:08] experience and the baptism of the Holy
[55:12] Ghost and he is adding more
[55:15] detail as the Holy Spirit anoints and
[55:18] inspires
[55:20] him it's the divine power of
[55:24] tutorship
[55:26] through total
[55:27] obedience and Peter was saying now that
[55:31] you've been born
[55:33] again now add to your
[55:36] faith he said add to your faith
[55:40] virtue add to your faith
[55:43] knowledge add to your faith
[55:47] self-control add to your faith
[55:51] patience add to your patience godliness
[55:56] add to your godliness brotherly
[56:00] kindness Peter here speaking this is the
[56:04] Born Again
[56:06] experience these are the steps that that
[56:09] Peter was anointed to outline for
[56:13] us but it's the same thing that Jesus
[56:17] said he's just spoke it in in a very
[56:20] simple
[56:21] form there in there in Matthew chapter 5
[56:26] it was Jesus teaching on
[56:28] Perfection
[56:30] Perfection is the end
[56:33] result but to begin to be able to get to
[56:38] Perfection the first step is to be born
[56:41] again that's the beginning and Jesus
[56:45] spoke on
[56:46] Perfection he was really speaking on the
[56:48] Born Again
[56:50] experience and the steps that we should
[56:53] take to get get into his
[56:56] presence Jesus
[56:59] said blessed are they that
[57:04] mourn Peter said add to your faith
[57:09] virtue they were speaking on the very
[57:11] same
[57:12] thing he said Jesus said blessed are
[57:15] they that
[57:18] mourn that's not a weakness when you've
[57:21] been born
[57:22] again that's a strength
[57:25] to be able to weep before
[57:28] God and say Lord I need you to have
[57:31] victory in my
[57:34] life Jesus said blessed are the
[57:38] meek because it takes strength to be
[57:42] meek when you really want to display
[57:45] anger it takes great
[57:47] strength oh I've fallen short many of
[57:50] times
[57:53] inde because it felt like it was easier
[57:56] to get
[57:59] angry it felt like showing anger would
[58:02] would would put the situation in my
[58:07] control the reality is and the Holy
[58:10] Spirit revealed it that had I displayed
[58:15] meekness he would have come into took
[58:17] control of that
[58:20] situation my anger made it further out
[58:23] of control
[58:26] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[58:28] after
[58:31] righteousness is what Jesus
[58:34] said Peter said add to your faith
[58:45] self-control Jesus said blessed are the
[58:51] merciful Peter
[58:53] said
[58:55] add to your faith
[58:57] patience they were saying the same
[59:01] thing God through His
[59:03] prophets God through his
[59:05] Apostles had them say the same
[59:08] thing in so many different
[59:11] ways not even a fool would
[59:16] a so that if your personality can't
[59:19] clash with
[59:21] [Music]
[59:23] Paul or maybe Peter's personality fits
[59:25] you
[59:28] better and if you felt you couldn't
[59:30] trust Peter or
[59:33] Paul you could go direct to
[59:36] Jesus but it's still the Holy Spirit
[59:39] work through all these
[59:42] Messengers it's the same message it's
[59:45] the Plan of Redemption coming from the
[59:47] Lamb's Book of Life to bring Salvation
[59:51] and change to our lives Jesus said
[59:56] blessed are the pure in
[59:58] heart Peter
[1:00:00] said add to your
[1:00:03] faith
[1:00:04] godliness both were
[1:00:06] speaking of the Born Again
[1:00:09] experience and the steps that takes
[1:00:12] us to be like
[1:00:14] Jesus in these bodies of
[1:00:16] flesh on this Earth so that we can
[1:00:20] receive our last
[1:00:23] change through rapture in faith the
[1:00:26] change of these
[1:00:31] bodies Jesus
[1:00:33] said blessed are the
[1:00:37] peacemakers Peter said add to your
[1:00:41] faith brotherly
[1:00:46] kindness this this work of God in our
[1:00:50] lives it's begun in
[1:00:53] love
[1:00:55] the love of God it will end with the
[1:00:57] love of God in our
[1:00:59] hearts the songwriter once
[1:01:02] wrote oh love of God so rich and pure so
[1:01:07] measureless and
[1:01:10] strong it shall forever more
[1:01:14] endure the Saints and Angels
[1:01:18] song God wanted Israel to love him serve
[1:01:22] him even under the law
[1:01:25] heed but Israel had a fourfold fourfold
[1:01:33] cycle that they lived
[1:01:35] under Mankind and the human
[1:01:39] race is in that same cycle yet
[1:01:43] today the church in the
[1:01:46] wilderness or the church through seven
[1:01:48] Church
[1:01:51] ages is in that same cycle
[1:01:55] all the people that are that are called
[1:01:56] the message
[1:01:59] people are in the same cycle
[1:02:02] today because what makes up the members
[1:02:05] of the Catholic
[1:02:08] Church makes up the members of everyone
[1:02:10] in this
[1:02:13] message we're all human
[1:02:16] beings born in
[1:02:18] sin shaped in
[1:02:20] iniquity come into this world speaking
[1:02:23] lies we were needing a
[1:02:26] savior we were needing a
[1:02:29] redeemer Jesus Christ the Lamb of God in
[1:02:33] the Book of Joshua chapter
[1:02:37] 23 beginning at verse
[1:02:44] one and it reads like
[1:02:46] this and it came to pass a long time
[1:02:49] after that the Lord had given rest unto
[1:02:53] Israel from all their enemies
[1:03:01] roundabout that Joshua Joshua waxed old
[1:03:04] and stricken in
[1:03:08] age and Joshua called for all Israel and
[1:03:12] for their
[1:03:16] elders and for their heads and for their
[1:03:18] judges and for their
[1:03:22] officers and said unto them I am old and
[1:03:24] stricken in
[1:03:27] age and you've seen all that the Lord
[1:03:30] your God ha done unto all these nations
[1:03:32] because of
[1:03:37] you for the Lord your God is he that ha
[1:03:41] fought for
[1:03:43] you now what Joshua is
[1:03:46] doing he's getting ready to tell
[1:03:49] Israel how to keep the
[1:03:53] victory that they've had under his
[1:03:56] ministry which really was the ministry
[1:03:58] of Jehovah
[1:04:00] God a vessel of clay called
[1:04:03] Joshua the son of nun in verse six he
[1:04:08] says be ye therefore very courageous to
[1:04:11] keep and do all that is written in the
[1:04:14] book of the law of
[1:04:19] Moses that she turn not aside there from
[1:04:22] to the right hand or to to the
[1:04:26] left that you come not among these
[1:04:30] nations these that remain among
[1:04:33] you neither make mention of the name of
[1:04:36] their
[1:04:38] gods nor cause to swear by
[1:04:42] them neither serve them nor bow
[1:04:46] yourselves unto
[1:04:47] them in other words Joshua is
[1:04:50] saying if you love the world and the
[1:04:53] things of the world
[1:04:56] the love of God won't be inside of
[1:04:59] you it won't be a part of
[1:05:02] you you won't have a Victorious
[1:05:05] Life in verse eight he
[1:05:09] says but cleave unto the Lord your God
[1:05:12] as you have done unto This
[1:05:17] Day verse
[1:05:19] 11 take good heed therefore unto
[1:05:23] yourselves
[1:05:25] that you love the Lord your
[1:05:30] God that statement
[1:05:32] there that's how you keep the
[1:05:35] victory if that's how the victory was
[1:05:38] kept under the
[1:05:40] law that's how the victory will be kept
[1:05:43] in the grace of
[1:05:45] God it's an unchanging
[1:05:49] declaration for the believer the
[1:05:51] believer 4,000 years ago
[1:05:54] or the believer in
[1:05:57] 2024 take good heed therefore unto
[1:06:04] yourselves that ye love the Lord your
[1:06:07] God and that's how we keep the
[1:06:10] victory don't let your
[1:06:12] love for god grow
[1:06:15] cold that's how you keep the
[1:06:18] victory don't let your love for your
[1:06:21] wife grow
[1:06:23] cold that's how you keep the
[1:06:25] victory don't let your love for your
[1:06:29] husband grow cold that's how you keep
[1:06:32] the
[1:06:33] victory don't let your love for your
[1:06:35] children grow
[1:06:38] cold that's how you keep the
[1:06:41] victory don't let the love for your
[1:06:44] parents grow cold that's how you
[1:06:48] keep the victory don't let your
[1:06:53] love for the household of
[1:06:58] faith grow
[1:07:00] cold let's reach out to one another
[1:07:06] always Matthew
[1:07:09] 24 verse
[1:07:15] 11 he says and many false
[1:07:19] prophets shall rise and shall deceive
[1:07:22] many
[1:07:30] and people get a hold of
[1:07:32] that and they say he Jesus
[1:07:36] said that the law and the prophets were
[1:07:38] until
[1:07:41] John so that means there's no more
[1:07:44] prophets then they go to Matthew
[1:07:46] 24 they say Jesus also said that many
[1:07:51] false prophets shall rise and shall
[1:07:52] deceive many
[1:07:56] so then they say you see there's either
[1:07:59] going to be no prophets or the ones that
[1:08:02] come will all be
[1:08:04] false it's in the Bible they
[1:08:06] say but in between those two
[1:08:09] verses in Matthew
[1:08:12] 23 and verse
[1:08:14] 34 Jesus said to the
[1:08:17] Pharisees this was long after John had
[1:08:20] been had had been
[1:08:22] killed
[1:08:24] this is long after John had been
[1:08:29] beheaded Jesus told them Jesus said
[1:08:34] I will send unto you
[1:08:37] prophets and wise
[1:08:39] men and scribes and you'll continue to
[1:08:42] persecute
[1:08:44] them but
[1:08:47] nonetheless the prophetic ministry will
[1:08:50] continue because it's been since Eden
[1:08:53] the proph prophetic
[1:08:55] Ministry was through the law the
[1:08:57] prophetic
[1:08:59] Ministry it crossed over into the New
[1:09:01] Testament with John a prophet of the New
[1:09:08] Testament and if you go to the Book of
[1:09:13] Revelations practically every
[1:09:16] chapter speaks of re of
[1:09:19] prophets
[1:09:21] Apostles
[1:09:22] Messengers that God would send all the
[1:09:26] way to the end as a matter of fact long
[1:09:29] after the bride of Christ is
[1:09:33] gone and God comes down to deal with the
[1:09:37] Jews what's the first thing he
[1:09:41] does he sends two
[1:09:43] witnesses
[1:09:45] prophets all the way to the end God
[1:09:48] never changed his mind about his
[1:09:52] word but unless you're born again you
[1:09:55] won't see it you'll put a period on the
[1:09:58] word of
[1:10:00] God instead of a comma where he also
[1:10:05] said Matthew 24
[1:10:10] and2 it says
[1:10:12] this it was
[1:10:14] Jesus speaking on the Seven
[1:10:17] Seals he says and because iniquity shall
[1:10:22] abound the love of many shall wax
[1:10:26] cold remember Joshua 20
[1:10:30] 23 11th verse that we just
[1:10:33] read where Joshua finishes telling
[1:10:36] them to Israel take heed to
[1:10:41] yourselves that you love the Lord your
[1:10:45] God because that how you're going to
[1:10:49] keep the
[1:10:50] victory in your lives
[1:10:54] Joshua
[1:10:58] 24:14 Joshua speaking to
[1:11:01] Israel he said now therefore fear the
[1:11:04] lord and serve him in sincerity and in
[1:11:08] truth uh Joshua 24 and verse
[1:11:16] 14 and put away the gods which your
[1:11:19] fathers served on the other side of the
[1:11:22] flood
[1:11:28] and serve ye the
[1:11:30] Lord if there was one thing I could
[1:11:32] finish with tonight to
[1:11:35] everyone I would say serve him with all
[1:11:38] your heart your soul all your
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:44] mind Joshua
[1:11:46] 245 and if it seem evil unto you to
[1:11:50] serve the
[1:11:51] Lord choose e day whom ye will
[1:11:57] serve whether the gods which your
[1:11:59] fathers served that were under on the
[1:12:01] other side of the
[1:12:06] flood for the gods of the amorites in
[1:12:08] whom land you
[1:12:12] dwell but Joshua then says but as for me
[1:12:17] and my
[1:12:18] house we will serve the
[1:12:22] Lord because that's the way me in my
[1:12:27] house we keep the
[1:12:31] victory Joshua 24 and verse
[1:12:36] 16 and the people and an answered and
[1:12:39] said God forbid that we should forsake
[1:12:42] the Lord to serve other
[1:12:49] gods for the Lord Our God he it is that
[1:12:52] brought us up
[1:12:54] that brought us up and our fathers out
[1:12:56] of the land of
[1:13:00] Egypt from the house of
[1:13:04] bondage and which did those great signs
[1:13:08] in our sight and preserved Us in all the
[1:13:16] way wherever we went and among all the
[1:13:19] people through whom we
[1:13:22] passed
[1:13:23] they said you think we'll stop serving
[1:13:27] him you you think we're going to stop
[1:13:29] being obedient to his
[1:13:31] word after all he's done for
[1:13:34] us they tell Joshua no
[1:13:37] way not us no Verse
[1:13:41] 18 and the Lord drave out from before us
[1:13:45] all the people even the amorites which
[1:13:47] dwelt in the
[1:13:52] land Israel speaking here therefore we
[1:13:56] will also serve the Lord for he is our
[1:14:02] God now the Book of
[1:14:05] Joshua is called a book of
[1:14:08] Victory the Book of Joshua was
[1:14:12] Victory through love the Book of Joshua
[1:14:16] was Victory through faith the Book of
[1:14:20] Joshua was Victory through
[1:14:24] obedience but what follows the Book of
[1:14:27] Joshua is the Book of
[1:14:30] Judges and it
[1:14:34] records 12
[1:14:36] men and one woman designated of God to
[1:14:41] deliver
[1:14:44] Israel and deliver Israel they
[1:14:49] did through a fourfold fourfold cycle
[1:14:52] that repeated over and over and over
[1:15:01] again in a in a 3 to 400 year period
[1:15:05] they lived
[1:15:08] there that's that's what when you look
[1:15:10] at the book of The Book of
[1:15:12] Judges it was a period of three or 400
[1:15:15] years
[1:15:17] there and it was a period in
[1:15:20] Israel where they never had the victory
[1:15:22] again
[1:15:25] over their
[1:15:28] enemies it was a cycle of
[1:15:33] rebellion
[1:15:38] retribution
[1:15:40] repentance
[1:15:42] restoration and then they started all
[1:15:44] over
[1:15:45] again
[1:15:48] Rebellion
[1:15:50] retribution
[1:15:52] repentance
[1:15:54] restoration under the law the cycle of
[1:16:00] mankind a cycle of a
[1:16:03] people lost in
[1:16:05] sin who just couldn't get the victory
[1:16:08] over
[1:16:10] it
[1:16:11] judges This Book of Judges is a book of
[1:16:17] defeat and not of
[1:16:19] Victories why go with me to judges CH
[1:16:24] 1 and verse
[1:16:32] 21 judges 1 and verse
[1:16:35] 21 it says and the children of Benjamin
[1:16:38] did not drive out the jebusites that
[1:16:41] inhabited Jerusalem but the jebusites
[1:16:44] dwell with the children of Benjamin in
[1:16:46] Jerusalem unto this
[1:16:52] day
[1:16:56] what would make the
[1:16:58] difference in a person's
[1:17:01] life that if a book was written about
[1:17:05] me would it have more defeats than
[1:17:10] victories or would my book show more
[1:17:13] victories than
[1:17:16] defeats judges 1 and verse
[1:17:19] 27 we see what Benjamin did
[1:17:24] after he entered the
[1:17:25] land he didn't put out the inhabitants
[1:17:28] as as the law had called for and Joshua
[1:17:31] had called for him to
[1:17:35] do but that was just one
[1:17:38] tribe verse
[1:17:40] 27 neither did Manasses drive out the
[1:17:43] inhabitants of Bin and her towns nor
[1:17:46] tanak and her towns nor the inhabitants
[1:17:49] of door and her
[1:17:52] towns
[1:18:01] the inhabitants of IIM and her towns nor
[1:18:04] the inhabitants of Migo and her towns
[1:18:06] but the Canaanites would dwell in that
[1:18:19] land verse 28 and it came to pass
[1:18:23] when Israel was
[1:18:28] strong physically
[1:18:30] natur but not spiritually that they put
[1:18:33] the Canaanites what out of the
[1:18:38] land you know why they didn't put the
[1:18:40] Canaanites out of the
[1:18:42] land because they weren't that
[1:18:45] strong to stay with the
[1:18:47] word the word it takes a great
[1:18:51] strength it came to pass when Israel was
[1:18:56] strong that they put the Canaanites to
[1:19:01] Tribute and did and did not utterly
[1:19:04] drive them
[1:19:06] out somebody said wait a
[1:19:11] minute you know there's a lot of stuff
[1:19:13] that we don't like
[1:19:16] doing we don't like digging
[1:19:19] ditches we don't really like being a
[1:19:21] roofer
[1:19:23] we don't like all the manual
[1:19:26] labor why put the Canaanites
[1:19:30] out when we can make them our ditch
[1:19:33] diggers we can turn them into our
[1:19:37] roofers we can make them the
[1:19:40] Carpenters we can have them washing our
[1:19:44] chariots and we can pay them almost
[1:19:48] nothing matter of fact we will pay them
[1:19:51] nothing that will be the just just the
[1:19:54] fact to live here and stay here will be
[1:19:56] their
[1:19:58] payment why it's a money-making deal for
[1:20:03] us so why put them
[1:20:06] out because God said
[1:20:08] so that was the
[1:20:11] why verse
[1:20:13] 29 but Benjamin saw what Manasses
[1:20:17] did or Manassa saw what Benjamin
[1:20:21] did
[1:20:23] Manasses saw what Benjamin had
[1:20:26] done he was
[1:20:29] influenced now what about
[1:20:32] Ephraim verse
[1:20:33] 29 neither did Ephraim dri out the
[1:20:36] Canaanites that dwelt in
[1:20:42] gizer but the Canaanites dwelt in gizer
[1:20:45] among
[1:20:47] them you see how they started falling
[1:20:49] one by
[1:20:51] one
[1:20:55] well if that family does it that way why
[1:20:57] can't
[1:20:59] I that Dad let's let let's his daughters
[1:21:02] cut their
[1:21:06] hair they paint their faces why why
[1:21:09] can't we then they still come to
[1:21:15] church verse 30 neither did Zebulon
[1:21:19] drive out the inhabitants of KRON nor
[1:21:21] the inhabitants of Nal but the
[1:21:24] Canaanites dwell among them and became
[1:21:37] tributaries you know what tributaries
[1:21:40] means it means if you're going to stay
[1:21:44] here in the
[1:21:46] land you got to pay
[1:21:49] us money we want money for you to
[1:21:54] stay but God said don't cut a deal with
[1:21:57] the don't cut a deal with the
[1:22:04] devil put him out of your
[1:22:07] house put him out of your
[1:22:09] cars put them out of your
[1:22:12] life no
[1:22:15] deal no deal I'm applying the token in
[1:22:20] my so that my children can be born
[1:22:24] again and have a victory in
[1:22:29] Christ in this life and in the one to
[1:22:35] come verse
[1:22:37] 31 neither did Asher drive out the
[1:22:40] inhabitants of AO nor the inhabitants of
[1:22:43] zidon nor of alab nor of as nor of Elba
[1:22:48] nor of aik nor of
[1:22:51] rehab
[1:22:59] there's all these tribes
[1:23:02] now they're all following what the first
[1:23:04] one did
[1:23:07] Benjamin well if Benjamin could do it
[1:23:11] and he's still part of the
[1:23:13] church why not me too why do I have to
[1:23:17] live a strict
[1:23:18] life you don't have to and if you've
[1:23:21] been born again
[1:23:23] it's not a strict life it's a life of
[1:23:26] victory in
[1:23:27] Christ verse 31 neither did Asher drive
[1:23:31] out the
[1:23:36] inhabitants in verse 32 it says but the
[1:23:41] asites dwell among the
[1:23:43] Canaanites then Habit to the land for
[1:23:47] they did not drive them
[1:23:49] out and what was the message to
[1:23:53] Israel God gave us a land we're going
[1:23:57] into the land and we're putting
[1:23:59] everybody
[1:24:00] out and the land will be a holy
[1:24:04] land and our lives will be a holy
[1:24:07] life and they entered into the
[1:24:10] land it was a rich
[1:24:12] land flowing with milk and
[1:24:17] honey but for but you know what they
[1:24:20] thought as a billionaire once said when
[1:24:23] he was
[1:24:27] asked in an interview oh way back in the
[1:24:30] late
[1:24:32] 60s they asked them they asked him if
[1:24:36] you spent millions of
[1:24:38] dollars a
[1:24:42] month at the age you are
[1:24:45] now you'd never spend all the money you
[1:24:49] have so how much is enough
[1:24:54] and the billionaire just
[1:24:56] smiled and he said just a little bit
[1:24:59] more that's all I want that was Israel
[1:25:04] that was human nature that was Fallen
[1:25:07] man no matter what the word of
[1:25:11] God told them that would give them a
[1:25:16] victory with great
[1:25:19] reward verse 33
[1:25:24] here's the last
[1:25:25] tribe 11 out of
[1:25:28] 12 already living in
[1:25:31] Disobedience it says neither did naali
[1:25:34] drive out the inhabitants of B nor the
[1:25:37] inhabitants of bethan but he dwelt among
[1:25:40] the Canaanites and inhabitants of the
[1:25:42] land nevertheless the inhabitants of
[1:25:44] bames and of bethan became tributaries
[1:25:48] unto
[1:25:51] them
[1:26:01] we know God told us through the mouth of
[1:26:04] Moses and
[1:26:06] Joshua put them out of the land do not
[1:26:10] dwell together with
[1:26:15] them how can two walk together L they be
[1:26:21] agreed
[1:26:23] they
[1:26:26] didn't they said they
[1:26:29] would but they didn't they were in total
[1:26:34] Disobedience to thus sayith the
[1:26:37] Lord what have we received in this age
[1:26:39] we're
[1:26:41] living thus sayith the Lord oh may God
[1:26:45] not find us in
[1:26:48] Disobedience even as Israel
[1:26:51] was watch now in
[1:26:55] Judges chapter
[1:26:57] 2 and verse
[1:27:00] one and an angel of the Lord came up
[1:27:03] from gilgal to bosim and said I made you
[1:27:07] to go up out of Egypt and have brought
[1:27:10] you unto the land which I swear unto
[1:27:13] your fathers and I said I will never
[1:27:16] break my Covenant with
[1:27:21] you
[1:27:29] for then this
[1:27:31] Angel which when you read the word angel
[1:27:33] in the
[1:27:35] Bible simply means a
[1:27:39] messenger he says verse two and you
[1:27:43] shall make no league with the
[1:27:44] inhabitants of this
[1:27:51] land
[1:27:52] you'll make no league with
[1:27:55] them you won't make a deal where we
[1:27:57] where you'll say you'll be tributaries
[1:27:59] to
[1:28:01] us he said ye shall make no league with
[1:28:04] the inhabitants of this land you shall
[1:28:06] throw down their altars but ye have not
[1:28:09] obeyed my voice why have you done this a
[1:28:12] messenger
[1:28:21] said
[1:28:23] a messenger in our day
[1:28:25] came and spoke to the denominations of
[1:28:28] this Modern
[1:28:30] Age asked them to throw down their
[1:28:32] denominational
[1:28:34] altars he told them you haven't obeyed
[1:28:37] the voice of
[1:28:38] God from the Catholic to the
[1:28:41] Pentecostal to a socalled message
[1:28:44] movement and he why have you done
[1:28:48] this listen to the tapes she'll hear him
[1:28:51] crying out
[1:28:54] out because you won't drive them
[1:29:00] out then I won't override your
[1:29:03] will and drive them out
[1:29:09] either God said if you won't do your
[1:29:14] part repent and be
[1:29:17] baptized how can I do my
[1:29:20] part and and give you the
[1:29:23] victory Judges
[1:29:26] chapter 2 and verse
[1:29:30] three wherefore I also said I will not
[1:29:33] drive them out from before you but they
[1:29:36] shall be as thorns in your side and
[1:29:39] their gods shall be a snare unto
[1:29:50] you but in the midst of this time of the
[1:29:53] judges in
[1:29:56] Israel when the church was
[1:29:59] continually
[1:30:02] cycling in a in a cycle of
[1:30:07] rebellion
[1:30:09] retribution
[1:30:11] repentance restoration under the
[1:30:14] law in a time when they couldn't keep a
[1:30:18] victory from one day to the next in this
[1:30:22] same time
[1:30:23] period while the judges were
[1:30:27] struggling when where they had turned
[1:30:29] their back on thus sayith the
[1:30:31] Lord and they were paying a price for it
[1:30:35] because all the nations that have paid
[1:30:37] tributary to
[1:30:39] them had now risen
[1:30:42] up fighting
[1:30:45] them killing them destroying their
[1:30:49] homes but in the midst of this time of
[1:30:51] judges
[1:30:53] in a time of great defeat for
[1:30:57] Israel there was a little elect
[1:31:01] lady whom the spirit of the Lord was
[1:31:04] moving
[1:31:06] upon not the church the bride her name
[1:31:10] was
[1:31:10] Ruth she was a
[1:31:13] moabit she wasn't coming under the
[1:31:17] law it was her love for
[1:31:20] Naomi that was was bringing her to to
[1:31:23] her
[1:31:24] Boaz she didn't know
[1:31:29] it but her love from
[1:31:32] Naomi made her to forsake her own Pagan
[1:31:40] religion and she tells
[1:31:43] Naomi where you go I'll
[1:31:45] go your God will be my
[1:31:49] God so I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:31:52] forsake
[1:31:56] you this little
[1:31:58] bride Ruth was a MOAB
[1:32:02] moabit and she wasn't coming in under
[1:32:04] the
[1:32:06] law it was her love for
[1:32:09] Naomi Ruth lived during the time of
[1:32:12] these
[1:32:14] judges so while Israel was falling to
[1:32:18] pieces a little Gentile bride was being
[1:32:21] lifted up
[1:32:23] and through the troubles and
[1:32:26] trials the woes and misfortunes of
[1:32:34] Life the woes and misfortunes of
[1:32:40] life this little
[1:32:42] Ruth her love didn't wax
[1:32:45] cold it grew stronger and
[1:32:48] stronger for the testimony of Naomi
[1:32:52] and her love for
[1:32:54] Jehovah in the Book of Ruth a time
[1:32:57] period of the judges
[1:33:00] also so in the time of Judges God lifts
[1:33:03] up a little
[1:33:05] Ruth in the time when Israel is at
[1:33:10] War they're being
[1:33:12] killed Hamas is killing them Arabs are
[1:33:16] battling them it seems like the world is
[1:33:19] falling
[1:33:20] apart the midst of all that
[1:33:23] war there's a little Ruth rising up oh
[1:33:27] somebody say I'm that little Ruth
[1:33:36] today in the Book of Ruth chapter
[1:33:40] 1 verse
[1:33:42] 16 and Ruth
[1:33:45] said entreat me not to leave
[1:33:50] thee or to return from following after
[1:33:54] thee for whether thou goest I will go
[1:33:58] and where thy lodges I will Lodge thy
[1:34:02] people shall be my people and thy God my
[1:34:12] God what's Ruth
[1:34:15] saying I'm giving everything
[1:34:18] up to follow
[1:34:20] you
[1:34:22] my family my country my people my gods I
[1:34:29] give it all up to follow
[1:34:33] you that should be the little attitude
[1:34:35] of every Ruth here
[1:34:39] tonight there is nothing in this world
[1:34:43] more
[1:34:44] precious and to serve the Lord
[1:34:47] Jesus with a reward of eternal
[1:34:50] life
[1:34:52] what reward does the devil give
[1:34:55] you
[1:34:57] death a lake of
[1:34:59] fire a devil's hell a prison
[1:35:04] house verse 17
[1:35:08] of Ruth says where th where thou dest
[1:35:12] will I
[1:35:13] die and there will I be buried the Lord
[1:35:17] do do so to me and more
[1:35:20] also if ought but death part the and
[1:35:29] me a
[1:35:31] daughter that feels that way about her
[1:35:34] mom when she gets
[1:35:37] married she'll feel that way about her
[1:35:43] husband think about that that was extra
[1:35:47] it wasn't written
[1:35:49] down there's so much more more to
[1:35:54] say and we will say it on Sunday the
[1:35:57] Lord willing to continue finishing this
[1:36:01] thought behold what man manner of
