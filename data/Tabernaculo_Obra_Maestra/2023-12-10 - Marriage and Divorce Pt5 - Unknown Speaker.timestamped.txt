[54:55] [Music]
[54:58] me
[55:10] [Music]
[55:23] with God bless bless you all this
[55:26] morning we certainly appreciate the
[55:30] worship because it's the
[55:33] worship that brings him
[55:35] down into our
[55:37] presence into our
[55:40] congregation into our
[55:43] lives you can be
[55:46] somewhere and be the only one
[55:48] worshiping don't worry he'll honor
[55:53] that maybe no one one else will he come
[55:56] down to
[55:58] visit but if you
[56:00] worship he'll come down and visit
[56:04] you we first we want to make welcome our
[56:07] brother
[56:09] Enrique and uh Enrique Jr I remember
[56:15] Enoch
[56:18] same and uh so we make you all welcome
[56:20] here and we welcome all of our regulars
[56:23] everyone
[56:26] for your
[56:27] support for being here for without you I
[56:32] would just be preaching to
[56:35] Karen but we're thankful for each and
[56:37] every one
[56:38] of we want to
[56:40] continue we've been speaking on this
[56:43] subject marriage and divorce in our
[56:47] day and and and the title in the mouth
[56:51] of two or three
[56:53] Witnesses because the
[56:56] Revelation which which and the truth
[56:59] actually lays in the mouth of two or
[57:01] three
[57:03] Witnesses and when a prophet preached
[57:06] marriage and
[57:08] divorce he brought out these three
[57:11] Witnesses but many times our eyes are
[57:14] clouded
[57:16] over and and instead of seen these three
[57:21] Witnesses we we just see the man that
[57:24] was
[57:26] preaching so we completely lose the
[57:29] truth of what he was
[57:32] saying because we're looking at a man
[57:36] singular but if we look at the holy
[57:38] spirit that was speaking through the
[57:40] mouth of a
[57:43] prophet and was bringing the loose ends
[57:49] together he was just the mouth
[57:53] piece so we want to get past the
[57:57] mouthpiece and see what was
[58:00] spoken and what was spoken for
[58:02] us was a
[58:04] reminder that the truth lays in these
[58:09] three
[58:10] Witnesses one being Jesus one being the
[58:13] Apostle Paul one being the prophet
[58:18] Moses and when you bring together what
[58:20] they
[58:22] said not what William brandham said
[58:25] because he didn't say it he was
[58:28] reminding us of what was
[58:30] said he was reminding of us what was in
[58:33] the
[58:34] Bible he was reminding us what was in
[58:36] the Lamb's Book of
[58:39] Life no book
[58:42] himself he was given a book and you and
[58:45] I are given a book and it's the same
[58:48] book that he was given we are given
[58:52] also John in Revelations 10
[58:55] he took the
[58:57] book from him from the mighty
[59:02] angel in Revelations
[59:05] 108 John took the
[59:07] book from that strong
[59:10] Angel the one with the rainbow over his
[59:13] head he didn't take the book from the
[59:15] seventh
[59:17] angel because the seventh angel has no
[59:20] book except the the same book that was
[59:23] given to him
[59:25] is given to us he was he was simply
[59:30] sent to tie together all the Loose
[59:33] Ends that were in this book called the
[59:37] Lamb's Book of Life bring together all
[59:40] the
[59:41] witnesses that have that have witnessed
[59:44] in this
[59:46] book and bring us a
[59:48] truth that in the mouth of two or three
[59:51] Witnesses all the teachings of the Bible
[59:55] can become a revelation to
[59:57] us the Born Again
[59:59] experience justified by faith Sanctified
[1:00:03] by the spirit the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:06] Ghost
[1:00:08] predestination Sons and Daughters of God
[1:00:10] being adopted by the
[1:00:13] father changes in our lives coming
[1:00:18] daily the refilling of the Holy
[1:00:21] Ghost why they're given what they do for
[1:00:25] us each and every time all these things
[1:00:29] in the mouth of two three Witnesses and
[1:00:32] marriage and divorce this
[1:00:34] truth is also in the mouth of two or
[1:00:38] three wi turn with me we're going to
[1:00:40] read once again in first Thessalonians
[1:00:44] 4 verses 1
[1:00:48] through and then we'll turn and read to
[1:00:51] Matthew
[1:00:53] 19
[1:00:56] verses 8 to
[1:00:58] 10 first
[1:01:00] Thessalonians 4 and verse
[1:01:04] one furthermore then we beseech you
[1:01:07] Brethren and exhort you by the Lord
[1:01:11] Jesus that as ye have received of us how
[1:01:15] ye ought to walk to please God so ye
[1:01:18] would abound more and
[1:01:23] more
[1:01:30] for you know what Commandments we gave
[1:01:32] you by the Lord
[1:01:35] Jesus for this is the will of
[1:01:38] God even your
[1:01:41] sanctification that you should abstain
[1:01:43] from
[1:01:44] fornication that every one of you should
[1:01:47] know how to possess your vessel in
[1:01:49] sanctification and
[1:01:53] honor
[1:01:55] not in the lust of
[1:01:57] concupiscence even as the Gentiles which
[1:02:00] know not
[1:02:03] God that no man go beyond and defraud
[1:02:07] his brother in any
[1:02:11] matter because the Lord is the Avenger
[1:02:13] of all
[1:02:15] such as we also have forwarned you and
[1:02:20] testified for God ha not called us unto
[1:02:23] uncleanness
[1:02:26] but unto
[1:02:28] Holiness Matthew
[1:02:30] 19 vers 8 to
[1:02:35] 10 Jesus
[1:02:37] speaking to a
[1:02:39] multitude and answering the
[1:02:44] question that uh Ministers of this great
[1:02:48] denomination his
[1:02:51] day were asking him to find fault with
[1:02:53] him
[1:02:56] but they didn't
[1:02:57] know that they didn't know the
[1:03:01] scripture that that they didn't have
[1:03:04] thus sayith the
[1:03:05] Lord that they simply had a
[1:03:08] proverb and they didn't know why the
[1:03:10] proverb had been given to
[1:03:13] them they thought this
[1:03:15] proverb was thus sayith the Lord and it
[1:03:19] could not be
[1:03:20] changed and anyone who tried to change
[1:03:23] it
[1:03:25] was a
[1:03:26] blasphemer and thus they could put that
[1:03:28] person to
[1:03:30] death that's what they were looking to
[1:03:32] do for
[1:03:33] Jesus and that's why they asked him the
[1:03:37] question but he caught them in their own
[1:03:41] trap verse
[1:03:43] eight they they they asked them they
[1:03:46] verse seven let's start there they say
[1:03:48] unto him why did Moses then command to
[1:03:50] give a writing a divorcement and to put
[1:03:53] her away
[1:03:58] he saith unto them Moses because of the
[1:04:02] hardness of your hearts suffered you to
[1:04:05] put away your
[1:04:11] wives but from the beginning it was not
[1:04:16] so and I say unto you whosoever shall
[1:04:19] put away his wife except it be for
[1:04:23] fornication
[1:04:27] this is where Jesus mixed the word
[1:04:32] wife with
[1:04:34] fornication and thus he hid a great
[1:04:37] mystery from the
[1:04:39] world and it actually seems to have
[1:04:42] brought great confusion to
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:04:46] all because they say if it's his
[1:04:49] wife wouldn't it be
[1:04:51] adultery even though fornication is the
[1:04:54] the same
[1:04:57] act he says and he says and whosoever
[1:04:59] shall put away his wife except it be for
[1:05:02] fornication and shall marry another
[1:05:04] committeth
[1:05:08] adultery so now Jesus has told
[1:05:12] them Moses gave you writing of
[1:05:15] divorce so you can put your wives away
[1:05:17] for any
[1:05:19] reason it was a proverb it wasn't thus
[1:05:22] sayith the Lord
[1:05:25] he said but he says unto her but except
[1:05:27] it be for
[1:05:29] fornication so now jesus takes away all
[1:05:32] the reasons to put away their
[1:05:36] wife any reason and he brings it down to
[1:05:40] one reason
[1:05:42] now they hadn't had this kind of a Stern
[1:05:45] message in 4,000
[1:05:50] years this for them this was this was
[1:05:53] crazy
[1:05:55] how dare you change the way we've been
[1:05:59] living in the so-called
[1:06:02] message for the last 6070
[1:06:07] years because they'd been living a
[1:06:10] proverb and not thus sayth the
[1:06:13] Lord statements had been become
[1:06:16] Doctrine and doctrines had become
[1:06:20] propaganda to the people to the churches
[1:06:24] and they were too blinded to see
[1:06:27] it it was a proverb that Moses had gave
[1:06:32] them God had said in the
[1:06:35] beginning and wrote with his finger on
[1:06:39] Stone Thou shalt not commit
[1:06:44] adultery and then Moses added all the
[1:06:48] different reasons why
[1:06:52] perhaps but Jesus Jesus tells
[1:06:55] him he said he he they asked him didn't
[1:06:59] Moses say we could give her a writing of
[1:07:03] divorce and put her
[1:07:06] away for any
[1:07:08] reason he said he said Moses verse eight
[1:07:11] because of the hardness of your heart
[1:07:13] suffered you to put away your
[1:07:17] wives from the beginning it wasn't
[1:07:20] so and Jesus had come
[1:07:24] God who sat on the
[1:07:27] throne the father had descended in a
[1:07:31] body of Flesh for what reason to take us
[1:07:35] all back to how it was in the
[1:07:39] beginning that was the purpose that God
[1:07:42] came
[1:07:43] down that's why he became
[1:07:46] flesh that's why he had a supernatural
[1:07:49] birth so he could offer us a
[1:07:52] supernatural birth
[1:07:54] and that Born Again
[1:07:58] experience to the
[1:08:00] beginning verse N9 I say unto you
[1:08:04] whosoever shall put away his wife except
[1:08:06] it be for this one reason
[1:08:10] now
[1:08:12] fornication and shall marry another
[1:08:15] committeth adultery and whoo Marth her
[1:08:18] which is put
[1:08:19] away do commit
[1:08:21] adultery his disciples say un to
[1:08:25] him the Pharisees didn't say
[1:08:27] it the Sadducees didn't say it they
[1:08:31] didn't believe it they didn't want
[1:08:35] it his
[1:08:37] disciples say unto him if this be the
[1:08:41] case of a man with his
[1:08:45] wife in this message
[1:08:47] today it's not good to
[1:08:50] marry the thought is with us with man
[1:08:53] yet today you
[1:08:56] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:09:00] we give you honor and
[1:09:01] glory and we ask that you bring forth
[1:09:04] your
[1:09:08] Witnesses in Jesus name amen amen you
[1:09:11] may be
[1:09:17] seated we had also read in Matthew
[1:09:22] 5 there where Jesus was
[1:09:25] speaking and he repeats the same thing
[1:09:28] again in verse
[1:09:30] 31 he said been said unto you that
[1:09:32] whosoever shall put away his wife saving
[1:09:35] for the cause of
[1:09:41] fornication verse 30 30 I'm sorry verse
[1:09:44] uh verse 31 Matthew
[1:09:51] 5 but I say to you that whosoever shall
[1:09:54] put away his wife saving for the cause
[1:09:57] of
[1:10:04] fornication a change had
[1:10:06] come because that's what the New
[1:10:08] Testament was
[1:10:10] about that's what the Lamb's Book of
[1:10:13] Life was
[1:10:15] about this new
[1:10:17] testament this New Covenant that we have
[1:10:20] written in a
[1:10:22] book this is the L's Book of
[1:10:25] Life it spoke to us of the Lamb's
[1:10:28] life in Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:10:32] John and it spoke to us of how we could
[1:10:35] have the Lamb's
[1:10:37] life so this New
[1:10:39] Testament written from Matthew to
[1:10:42] Revelation this is the Lamb's Book of
[1:10:46] Life but yet it was all spoken in
[1:10:49] Parables but
[1:10:51] today the Holy Spirit
[1:10:54] using a prophet to bring the loose ends
[1:10:58] together to give us a revelation
[1:11:01] of so then we could live by faith
[1:11:05] because the prophet told us faith is the
[1:11:08] Revelation in verse 32 Jesus said but I
[1:11:12] say unto you that whosoever shall put
[1:11:15] away his wife saving for the cause of
[1:11:19] fornication causes her to commit
[1:11:22] adultery
[1:11:24] it's a serious
[1:11:26] matter it's like if you would cause
[1:11:28] someone to commit
[1:11:32] murder or you you cause someone to to to
[1:11:36] Rob for
[1:11:38] you or you cause someone to lie for
[1:11:43] you it's a serious thing for you to be
[1:11:46] the cause of something like
[1:11:48] this he says causes her to commit
[1:11:51] adultery and whosoever shall marry her
[1:11:53] that his divorce committeth
[1:11:58] adultery brother Bram said in marriage
[1:12:00] and
[1:12:01] divorce now many of you this might be
[1:12:05] Greek to
[1:12:06] you he says but my church
[1:12:10] understands he said he says now that our
[1:12:14] Lord has opened the seven seal mystery
[1:12:17] of his word to
[1:12:20] us and in this last days he says now
[1:12:24] many of you this might be Greek to
[1:12:27] you but my church understands so there
[1:12:30] will be a
[1:12:32] church understands this Bible This
[1:12:37] Promise of
[1:12:38] Salvation this quickening power because
[1:12:42] they'll they will understand that
[1:12:45] they're looking at a book that's been
[1:12:47] opened that the seven seal mystery have
[1:12:50] been
[1:12:51] opened because of this opening
[1:12:54] we can understand what
[1:12:57] Jes but you must have a
[1:13:00] revelation that the book is
[1:13:04] open so Jesus in the text we wrote we
[1:13:08] read invited us to go back to the
[1:13:11] beginning for the true scriptural
[1:13:15] answer because he told us what you're
[1:13:18] telling me now it wasn't so in the
[1:13:22] beginning
[1:13:24] and I'm here present the Lord Jesus
[1:13:26] telling
[1:13:28] us to take us all back to that
[1:13:32] beginning when we walked with God when
[1:13:35] we talked with God when we still had a
[1:13:38] friendship with the
[1:13:41] father he goes on to
[1:13:44] say at the
[1:13:46] beginning there was only one pair of
[1:13:50] anything one pair of any species
[1:13:55] was God's perfect order at the
[1:13:58] beginning multiple
[1:14:01] partners between male and
[1:14:03] female was not in the
[1:14:06] beginning before the fall of God's
[1:14:10] children in Genesis
[1:14:12] 31 and Genesis
[1:14:15] 3 was the seventh day the seventh day
[1:14:20] began in chapter 2
[1:14:23] of
[1:14:24] Genesis the seventh day
[1:14:27] continued all the way into Genesis
[1:14:31] 3 more was
[1:14:33] spoken of the seventh
[1:14:36] day than was of all the other
[1:14:40] days Genesis 1 was
[1:14:44] dedicated to the
[1:14:46] prophecy of what would take
[1:14:49] place in six days one chapter
[1:14:54] but God
[1:14:56] dedicated two
[1:14:58] chapters to the seventh day did you know
[1:15:02] that did you realize that he gave he he
[1:15:06] he said he said more about the seventh
[1:15:09] day than he did of the other six
[1:15:12] days because it was in the seventh day
[1:15:16] that he brought forth his
[1:15:18] son a spoken word son it was in the
[1:15:22] seventh day
[1:15:23] that he was tutoring his son to do the
[1:15:26] works that he was
[1:15:29] doing to be a spoken word
[1:15:33] Creator to for Adam to be a participant
[1:15:36] in bringing forth the family of
[1:15:40] God by the spoken word more was said on
[1:15:44] the about the seventh
[1:15:46] day all the other days and I want to
[1:15:49] tell you this
[1:15:51] morning more is said about this seven
[1:15:55] seal than all the other
[1:15:57] seal the pattern of God's word it's
[1:16:01] laying in the word it's laying in this
[1:16:04] message but we've got to learn to look
[1:16:07] at the
[1:16:09] word the way God wants us to see
[1:16:13] it a
[1:16:15] revelation
[1:16:17] now multiple
[1:16:19] partners between male and female was not
[1:16:22] in the beginning before the
[1:16:25] fall of God's
[1:16:27] children in Genesis 3 having multiple
[1:16:31] partners is what brought the
[1:16:34] fall the serpent introduced
[1:16:37] Eve to polygamy and when she partook of
[1:16:41] this
[1:16:43] act of
[1:16:45] fornication it broke her
[1:16:48] harmony with God and threw the whole
[1:16:51] world out of cater
[1:16:56] all Humanity out of
[1:16:59] CER her fall her her taking the
[1:17:03] reasoning of the
[1:17:06] serpent over the prophetic word of
[1:17:09] God the serpent threw all the animal
[1:17:12] kingdom out of
[1:17:16] cader but even more than that the
[1:17:19] serpent mixed his seed with the seed of
[1:17:22] man
[1:17:25] and It produced a hybrid man and
[1:17:29] woman that we are today with a
[1:17:32] polygamous
[1:17:35] inclination towards
[1:17:38] foration adultery and multiple
[1:17:42] partners because that was the nature of
[1:17:45] the
[1:17:46] serpent that's the DNA that was in this
[1:17:50] serpent that was the mentality of of
[1:17:53] this
[1:17:54] serpent that's why Satan wanted to use
[1:17:57] this most subtle beast of the
[1:18:01] field to genetically
[1:18:04] modify the children of God you thought
[1:18:08] GMOs was just a modern
[1:18:12] thing no it's it's been since the
[1:18:17] beginning it was said Lucifer's
[1:18:19] Lucifer's trick in the
[1:18:21] beginning
[1:18:24] and that's the nature of the
[1:18:26] serpent that's in this
[1:18:29] body
[1:18:30] today because of the sex
[1:18:33] birth it was that was not God's
[1:18:38] plan he gave Adam and Eve free moral
[1:18:42] agency they knew they would bring forth
[1:18:45] the family of
[1:18:47] God so Lucifer didn't change
[1:18:51] that no no he perverted it he said yes
[1:18:57] he'll bring forth the family of
[1:18:59] God but isn't it taking a long
[1:19:02] time isn't it a real
[1:19:05] struggle has he actually told you what
[1:19:08] day you'll have this this this
[1:19:11] incredible Supernatural
[1:19:15] experience he said well no no we don't
[1:19:18] have a
[1:19:20] date we don't know when he's coming
[1:19:24] he says how if I tell
[1:19:27] you I can get you to that spot where he
[1:19:30] wants
[1:19:32] you but I can give you a
[1:19:35] date right
[1:19:39] now that's why we must be born
[1:19:43] again to receive a new
[1:19:46] nature spirit that won't take the
[1:19:49] devil's
[1:19:51] shortcut so we can practice our
[1:19:55] courtship unto marriage and
[1:19:59] Holiness and keep a vow till death do us
[1:20:04] part otherwise you'll play The Dating
[1:20:09] Game through the lust of the
[1:20:11] flesh you mean only the young people
[1:20:13] brother
[1:20:15] Daniel well it really happens kind of
[1:20:18] between the age of
[1:20:20] about 12 and 100 years
[1:20:25] old
[1:20:27] unless you're born
[1:20:30] again you'll play the You'll Play The
[1:20:33] Dating
[1:20:34] Game without the Born Again
[1:20:37] experience through the lust of the flesh
[1:20:40] defiling each other in filth and
[1:20:50] immorality having multiple
[1:20:55] Partners you mean you mean the Catholics
[1:20:57] brother the
[1:20:58] Daniel not only them you mean the
[1:21:03] lutherans no not only them you mean the
[1:21:07] Baptist not only them do you mean in the
[1:21:10] message
[1:21:11] too yes they're
[1:21:14] included because every human being on
[1:21:16] the face of the
[1:21:18] Earth if you don't belong to the
[1:21:20] mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:21:24] if you hav't been born again you are
[1:21:27] subject to this fall in your life
[1:21:32] too
[1:21:34] God rich in
[1:21:37] Mercy giving us his
[1:21:41] truth so in the
[1:21:43] beginning this is what brought the
[1:21:45] fall God's children had
[1:21:48] fallen remember that before the
[1:21:50] fall the woman was quot equal in all
[1:21:55] creation men stand up
[1:21:59] today
[1:22:00] pagans religious men denominational
[1:22:06] people and they they want they think
[1:22:09] that
[1:22:10] they know how to make the woman
[1:22:17] co-equal he says the woman can do things
[1:22:21] just as good as a man this
[1:22:24] they can preach too why don't you have
[1:22:27] them preaching in your
[1:22:31] church you see man through his carnal
[1:22:37] [Music]
[1:22:38] ways he he wants to bring forth the
[1:22:42] woman and make her
[1:22:46] co-equal without her being born
[1:22:48] again and
[1:22:50] men who haven't been Born Again standing
[1:22:54] in the
[1:22:57] pulpits fall for the devil's
[1:23:01] [Music]
[1:23:02] lie it wasn't God that that in the
[1:23:07] beginning had the the man to rule over
[1:23:10] the
[1:23:15] woman beginning God made them
[1:23:19] coequal it was disobedience
[1:23:23] it was
[1:23:24] unbelief that brought this
[1:23:27] curse upon the
[1:23:29] woman you say a
[1:23:32] curse that a man would rule over
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:37] her a beastly
[1:23:39] Man Without Christ in his life all of a
[1:23:43] sudden he's the
[1:23:46] boss you don't have to look back too
[1:23:49] many
[1:23:51] years to see what what the man has
[1:23:54] done to his family to his wife to his
[1:23:58] children the men who haven't been born
[1:24:02] again the men who haven't given their
[1:24:04] lives to
[1:24:07] Christ the men who who who when they
[1:24:09] make a
[1:24:11] mistake there's no Holy Spirit there to
[1:24:14] to to to tap them on the
[1:24:17] shoulder say you shouldn't have said
[1:24:19] that you shouldn't have talked to her
[1:24:21] that way
[1:24:24] you shouldn't have pushed your son to
[1:24:25] the wall and knocked him
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:30] down and that kind of man was given the
[1:24:33] headship over the
[1:24:35] woman and the family oh my goodness man
[1:24:40] you have nothing to brag
[1:24:44] about unless you've been born
[1:24:47] again and you can stand up and
[1:24:50] say I'm not that way no more
[1:24:53] I want to do my family
[1:24:55] Justice I want to treat my wife with
[1:24:58] respect and
[1:25:01] love in the
[1:25:04] beginning God made them
[1:25:06] coequal after the
[1:25:08] fall each must have a separate
[1:25:15] Covenant there in Genesis
[1:25:18] 3 a great white Throne
[1:25:21] judgment you remember begins about verse
[1:25:27] 14 God curses The
[1:25:30] Serpent and it goes upon its
[1:25:33] belly because it wasn't that way
[1:25:36] before so Prophecy in the word of
[1:25:39] God is very
[1:25:43] telling that that it reveals to us that
[1:25:47] if the curse was it went up is is that
[1:25:49] it went upon its
[1:25:51] belly
[1:25:55] and that was the
[1:25:57] curse then that means prior to that
[1:26:01] stood on two feet he walked around it
[1:26:05] was a
[1:26:05] man then in verse 15 then he brings
[1:26:09] judgment upon the
[1:26:11] woman he said I will put Amity between
[1:26:13] thee and the
[1:26:15] woman speaking to the
[1:26:17] serpent and between thy
[1:26:20] seed this is the first time the
[1:26:24] mentions the serpent
[1:26:26] seed that was planted in the
[1:26:30] woman that brought
[1:26:32] forth a beastly man whose name was
[1:26:36] Cain remember in the Book of
[1:26:39] John John says and
[1:26:41] Cain was of that Wicked
[1:26:45] one Malo Malo and he says he says and I
[1:26:50] will put enmity between thee and the
[1:26:51] woman between thy seed and her seed it
[1:26:54] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:26:55] bruise his
[1:27:02] heel it was a prophecy the woman's seed
[1:27:07] was to be the spoken
[1:27:09] word that would
[1:27:11] create a seed and place it in a little
[1:27:16] girl it was a prophetic
[1:27:19] word but the woman fell and the judgment
[1:27:22] That Came Upon
[1:27:24] her I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:27:27] and thy
[1:27:30] conception it wasn't going to be that
[1:27:32] way it would have been the spoken
[1:27:35] word it would have been a spoken word
[1:27:39] seed there would have been no sorrow in
[1:27:42] this
[1:27:44] conception he said in sorrow th shall
[1:27:46] bring forth
[1:27:48] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:27:51] husband
[1:27:53] and believe it or
[1:27:55] not from this day
[1:27:57] forward because of
[1:28:00] Disobedience he shall rule over
[1:28:03] thee but he's really not fit to rule
[1:28:06] over
[1:28:09] you because he's as Fallen as you are
[1:28:13] Fallen the
[1:28:19] man the woman no longer co-equal with
[1:28:21] the man
[1:28:23] and God changes her
[1:28:26] Covenant and it's this change in
[1:28:28] Covenant for the
[1:28:31] woman that now determines this
[1:28:33] permissive
[1:28:36] will this was not God's perfect
[1:28:40] will for the
[1:28:42] Believers
[1:28:44] concerning how we approach
[1:28:50] marriage until
[1:28:52] we are restored to the
[1:28:55] beginning that once again we'll be Co in
[1:28:58] co-equal
[1:29:00] covenants with Jesus
[1:29:05] Christ a Christian
[1:29:09] lady with a Godly
[1:29:13] husband she is living as close as a
[1:29:16] woman has ever
[1:29:19] lived to be co-equal with her
[1:29:25] husband not living with a religious
[1:29:29] man that doesn't mean you're getting
[1:29:31] close to this co-equal
[1:29:36] experience no it's living with a man
[1:29:38] who's been born
[1:29:40] again that the Holy Spirit checks
[1:29:48] him you
[1:29:50] know when as man
[1:29:53] we get up on the wrong side of the
[1:29:57] bed and the first thing out of our
[1:30:01] mouth is something
[1:30:07] rude but if you've been born
[1:30:09] again the Holy Spirit tells
[1:30:12] you as you're washing your face off in
[1:30:15] the
[1:30:16] bathroom you shouldn't have said
[1:30:19] that now go back outside
[1:30:23] and make that
[1:30:27] right marriage and
[1:30:30] divorce in our
[1:30:34] day in verse
[1:30:37] 17 in this white Throne
[1:30:41] judgment here in
[1:30:43] Genesis he speaks to the man
[1:30:47] Adam and he does not curse Adam
[1:30:52] like he did the
[1:30:55] serpent the serpent the curse affected
[1:30:57] it
[1:31:02] physically the woman when God judged her
[1:31:06] she was affected
[1:31:08] physically but he doesn't touch
[1:31:10] Adam in verse 17
[1:31:13] 18 God says for thy sake he says I'm
[1:31:18] going to curse the
[1:31:20] ground
[1:31:22] he says in sorrow Thou shalt eat of it
[1:31:24] all the days of their
[1:31:26] life he says because of what you've
[1:31:29] done this Earth is now going to bring
[1:31:32] forth thorns and
[1:31:36] thistles and thou shalt eat the herb of
[1:31:38] the
[1:31:39] field how will you eat it in the sweat
[1:31:43] of thy face Thou shalt eat
[1:31:46] bread prior to
[1:31:48] that they didn't know what it was to
[1:31:51] perspire
[1:31:54] that's an
[1:31:56] attribute of a Dying
[1:31:57] [Music]
[1:31:59] World and not a son of
[1:32:02] God in the presence of God God made the
[1:32:06] Earth his
[1:32:08] Target to receive his
[1:32:10] wrath so that his so that his son would
[1:32:13] not be
[1:32:15] cursed we walk on a cursed
[1:32:18] Earth thorns and thistles remind us
[1:32:21] daily
[1:32:23] of the grace of God and the curse on
[1:32:27] planet
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:28] Earth wrath of God on every coast of
[1:32:32] this
[1:32:33] planet Paul said in Romans
[1:32:36] 8:22 we know that the whole
[1:32:39] creation grth and travaileth in pain
[1:32:43] together until
[1:32:49] now 8:22
[1:32:57] Adam's Adam's
[1:33:00] Covenant did not
[1:33:02] change but his personal
[1:33:05] tutorship and
[1:33:07] adoption with and by the father had been
[1:33:12] indefinitely
[1:33:14] postponed he G the spirit of
[1:33:17] God he walked out from behind the Seal
[1:33:20] of God
[1:33:22] when he listened to Eve's
[1:33:27] deception on her
[1:33:30] shortcut on how they could be like
[1:33:33] God through this polygamy
[1:33:37] Act of adultery and
[1:33:41] fornication now polygamy is
[1:33:45] introduced not only to
[1:33:47] Eve by the serpent but all creation is
[1:33:51] affected
[1:33:53] prior to the coming of
[1:33:56] Christ polygamy was a
[1:33:58] covenant in which man had fallen
[1:34:01] into and all the animal
[1:34:04] kingdom through
[1:34:06] Lucifer anointing the serpent to hybrid
[1:34:10] Adam's
[1:34:12] race with the seed of the
[1:34:15] serpent we this
[1:34:18] body is
[1:34:19] fallen and mixed
[1:34:22] with the seed of the
[1:34:26] serpent this body cannot be born
[1:34:29] again what is Born
[1:34:32] Again is the seed of God the soul that's
[1:34:36] laying in
[1:34:38] here the inner
[1:34:42] you the real
[1:34:45] you who who was who wandered in
[1:34:48] spiritual
[1:34:50] amnesia
[1:34:52] who am I where am I
[1:34:56] going then one day the light struck the
[1:35:01] seed one day the washing of the water of
[1:35:04] the word anointed the
[1:35:08] seed and you were born
[1:35:14] again and now when you threw
[1:35:17] yourselves to the lust of the
[1:35:20] flesh through a born again
[1:35:23] experience Supernatural
[1:35:25] birth now we begin to mortify the Deeds
[1:35:28] of the
[1:35:32] flesh we're
[1:35:34] overcoming we're being
[1:35:36] molded we're baptized with the Holy
[1:35:39] Ghost and in great struggles that we
[1:35:43] have you say I thought I had the Holy
[1:35:47] Ghost why am I struggling so much with
[1:35:50] this
[1:35:52] then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:35:55] down with a refilling of the Holy
[1:35:59] Ghost once again and he lifts you
[1:36:05] up as I've told you
[1:36:07] before the refilling of the holy
[1:36:12] spirit is not a reward for your good
[1:36:17] behavior there's no such thing no no
[1:36:22] the refilling of the holy
[1:36:24] spirit is
[1:36:26] strength to
[1:36:28] overcome the trial you find yourself
[1:36:31] in the refilling of the Holy
[1:36:34] Ghost is
[1:36:37] strength to live a life worthy of the
[1:36:41] Gospel the refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:45] is strength to say
[1:36:48] no when someone wants you to say yes
[1:36:52] and you know it's the devil
[1:36:57] speaking the refilling of the Holy
[1:37:00] Ghost is strength to
[1:37:03] overcome once
[1:37:14] again prior to the coming of
[1:37:18] Christ polygamy was the Covenant
[1:37:22] given to Fallen man and all the animal
[1:37:25] kingdom
[1:37:26] too but at the coming of Jesus
[1:37:29] Christ Jesus
[1:37:31] ANS Moses's writing of
[1:37:37] divorcement because that wasn't thus
[1:37:39] sayith the
[1:37:41] Lord that was just a
[1:37:43] proverb and Proverbs can be
[1:37:47] aned so Jesus anuls Moses writing of
[1:37:50] divorce
[1:37:55] and the Covenant of
[1:37:57] polygamy can now be
[1:38:00] overcome you can now as an an individual
[1:38:03] you can abandon that way of
[1:38:06] life you can Ann that style of
[1:38:10] living it's for the believer to have a
[1:38:14] closer
[1:38:15] walk with his
[1:38:17] creator that's why Jesus came as
[1:38:22] was a son being adopted by the
[1:38:25] father now Jesus is making an
[1:38:29] invitation to return to how it was in
[1:38:33] the
[1:38:34] beginning so you and I can be sons and
[1:38:38] daughters being adopted by the father
[1:38:41] again because he wants to take us back
[1:38:44] to how it was
[1:38:46] beginning so that we can live that way
[1:38:50] now
[1:38:51] today as sons and daughters being
[1:38:55] restored and given strength to
[1:39:01] overcome God the
[1:39:04] the rich in
[1:39:20] Mercy
[1:39:39] as we know
[1:39:41] Solomon had a thousand
[1:39:43] wives and David
[1:39:46] 500 because they had
[1:39:49] fallen they were falling en
[1:39:52] men to a fallen
[1:39:54] Covenant the entire Animal Kingdom had
[1:39:59] fallen when Adam
[1:40:02] fell all fell with
[1:40:06] him there was there was no Escape in
[1:40:10] it for the human race when Adam
[1:40:14] fell all creation fell with
[1:40:17] him the animal kingdom the bird
[1:40:23] kingdom the the the fish
[1:40:27] Kingdom everything fell the insect
[1:40:32] Kingdom when Adam and Eve
[1:40:34] fell everything fell with
[1:40:37] them that's why when Jesus
[1:40:40] came he he
[1:40:43] died he was
[1:40:45] buried he rose again the third
[1:40:48] day if you accept Jesus Christ
[1:40:52] as your personal
[1:40:53] savior repent or you're baptized in his
[1:40:58] name because he rose
[1:41:01] again if you accept him if you follow
[1:41:06] him if you love
[1:41:08] him you will not fall because we're not
[1:41:11] following a fallen ad following a fallen
[1:41:15] Adam We are following a risen
[1:41:19] Adam never fall and if you follow him
[1:41:24] you cannot fall again he'll raise you
[1:41:28] up the message marriage and
[1:41:31] divorce Madam says
[1:41:34] this noce don't fail this
[1:41:38] now take it all down in your
[1:41:41] hearts speaking of Solomon
[1:41:44] davidon he said but not not one of those
[1:41:47] women could even have one more
[1:41:49] husband
[1:41:53] he is the original cre
[1:41:56] creation not her not one of those women
[1:41:59] could have one more
[1:42:01] husband but that one
[1:42:03] husband could have a thousand
[1:42:06] wives but remember in in the
[1:42:10] beginning neither could Adam have
[1:42:12] another
[1:42:16] wife but in the
[1:42:18] beginning neither could Adam
[1:42:21] take another wife take
[1:42:24] another neither could Eve take another
[1:42:28] husband in the
[1:42:31] beginning before the fall neither did
[1:42:33] they want
[1:42:35] to because they had a holy
[1:42:38] Veil and that's what the Born Again
[1:42:41] experience is bringing back to
[1:42:44] us as men and women to place a holy Veil
[1:42:49] before us
[1:42:51] you won't desire another husband you
[1:42:54] won't desire another
[1:42:56] wife you'll desire to be like it was in
[1:42:59] the beginning once
[1:43:02] again only death will ever separate
[1:43:06] you brother Bram says he says that's
[1:43:10] thus sayith the
[1:43:12] Lord that's the Bible now I've went back
[1:43:17] took my
[1:43:19] time showed you where it
[1:43:22] started what Jesus
[1:43:25] said he said he said when Abraham took
[1:43:29] Sarah down into the Philistine
[1:43:32] country there was a king down there
[1:43:35] named
[1:43:37] aimc and Sarah was 100 years
[1:43:40] old or 90 years old but she had been
[1:43:43] changed back to a young
[1:43:45] woman and been made beautiful did you
[1:43:49] know that and aik wanted her for
[1:43:53] wife aik wanted to take Sarah for a
[1:43:58] wife he probably had a herum
[1:44:02] already but he could but he could not
[1:44:05] take her if she was married to
[1:44:08] Abraham it was a
[1:44:11] truth back then even amongst the Pagan
[1:44:15] kings that it was considered
[1:44:19] wrong wickedly wrong to take another
[1:44:23] man's
[1:44:25] wife oh we've lost that today that's for
[1:44:29] [Music]
[1:44:32] sure so
[1:44:35] Abraham said to
[1:44:37] Sarah say that you are my say that you
[1:44:41] are my my
[1:44:44] sister because he'll kill
[1:44:46] me say that we're brother and
[1:44:49] sister because he'll kill me so that he
[1:44:52] can have
[1:44:54] you why didn't he just Chase Abraham out
[1:44:57] of the
[1:45:00] country and take his wife and go
[1:45:05] on one
[1:45:19] moment
[1:45:23] why why didn't
[1:45:24] he why didn't he Chase Abraham out of
[1:45:27] the
[1:45:30] country and take his wife and go go
[1:45:33] on not only Allah was it with
[1:45:38] Believers but to all people in the
[1:45:42] creation or
[1:45:43] Saint you are responsible
[1:45:46] man for these acts there was a heathen
[1:45:50] King
[1:45:51] how many knows that story is
[1:45:53] true the Bible there in about Genesis
[1:45:58] 16 you notice
[1:46:00] aik would have took her for a
[1:46:03] wife he fixed himself to have this new
[1:46:06] Hebrew
[1:46:09] girl and she said well Abraham he's my
[1:46:13] brother Abraham said she's my
[1:46:17] sister AB said no problem
[1:46:20] I'll just take her for a wife
[1:46:23] then could you imagine a man doing a
[1:46:26] thing like
[1:46:28] that but he did could you imagine woman
[1:46:32] being put and made subject for men to
[1:46:35] rule over
[1:46:39] them but it is because of the Fall oh
[1:46:44] everything got turned upside
[1:46:47] down between husband and wife
[1:46:51] between God and
[1:46:56] man and then that
[1:46:59] night while
[1:47:02] slept the Lord
[1:47:05] appeared to a pagan
[1:47:09] King in a
[1:47:11] dream and said
[1:47:13] aimc you're as good as a dead
[1:47:17] man how much more if we're born again of
[1:47:22] the
[1:47:23] spirit should we expect God to come on
[1:47:27] the scene and lead us and talk to us and
[1:47:31] give us dreams and teach us how to
[1:47:36] live we should expect
[1:47:39] it if he did it for a pagan
[1:47:43] King he'll do it for you he'll answer
[1:47:47] all your
[1:47:48] questions and he'll give you strength
[1:47:51] strength as the head of every
[1:47:53] home to do justice to your
[1:47:56] family not
[1:47:59] violence Justice in the love of
[1:48:04] God and you'll start to treat
[1:48:10] her like it was in the
[1:48:17] beginning God said bik
[1:48:21] you're as good as a dead
[1:48:23] man he was
[1:48:26] protecting that stream of Jewish blood
[1:48:29] there you're as good as a dead
[1:48:33] man you've got another man's wife you're
[1:48:36] fixing to
[1:48:40] marry and if you go through with
[1:48:42] it I'll destroy your
[1:48:45] kingdom I'll destroy everyone in it I'll
[1:48:50] destroy your
[1:48:53] life
[1:48:56] says you you know if I knew I wouldn't
[1:48:58] have do that they lied to
[1:49:01] me they lied to
[1:49:05] me why those message folks they lied to
[1:49:09] me I can't believe they did
[1:49:17] it even under the Covenant of polygamy
[1:49:21] it was absolutely a
[1:49:24] sin to take another man's wife because
[1:49:28] that's what
[1:49:30] brought the fall of Man in the beginning
[1:49:34] and to practice that continues to bring
[1:49:37] the
[1:49:38] fall of men women Children and Families
[1:49:43] yet
[1:49:46] today but at the coming of Jesus
[1:49:49] Christ thus sayith the Lord he tells
[1:49:52] Israel in Matthew
[1:49:55] 19 you'll not have
[1:49:58] occasion use this
[1:50:00] proverb of one man and many and many
[1:50:05] wives a proverb was that a
[1:50:09] proverb it was and it would change
[1:50:13] because Proverbs can be
[1:50:15] changed Proverbs can be
[1:50:19] uned
[1:50:20] a proverb is a
[1:50:23] saying that gives
[1:50:25] advice usually as a a
[1:50:30] metaphor a simple traditional
[1:50:35] saying that
[1:50:37] expresses uh a perceived
[1:50:41] truth based on common
[1:50:45] sense or
[1:50:47] experience that's what Israel was full
[1:50:49] of
[1:50:52] and God would change
[1:50:53] it that was the purpose of him
[1:50:57] coming God through the ministry of the
[1:50:59] first
[1:51:01] Elijah had five things he wanted to do
[1:51:04] for
[1:51:06] Israel it's written in Isaiah
[1:51:09] 40 the five things that God was going to
[1:51:13] do for Israel when he
[1:51:14] came and it was going to begin with the
[1:51:17] ministry of John the
[1:51:18] Baptist
[1:51:21] and the Bible tells us that John would
[1:51:23] bring these five
[1:51:25] things the first thing he would
[1:51:28] bring is change the second thing we
[1:51:31] would bring was change third thing we
[1:51:33] would bring to Israel is change the
[1:51:35] fourth thing he was bringing his change
[1:51:38] the fifth thing he was bringing his
[1:51:39] change Jesus Christ came to change us so
[1:51:44] they were nothing at all like we've
[1:51:47] been they came to change his
[1:51:51] Israel rejected the
[1:51:53] change Israel rejected the open
[1:51:56] world Israel rejected the revelation
[1:52:01] of and a New Testament
[1:52:04] Church
[1:52:07] inherited the portion that was for the
[1:52:10] firstborn son
[1:52:12] Israel now it's
[1:52:14] ours if you can if you'll receive it if
[1:52:18] you'll believe it it's laying in the
[1:52:23] Bible this new
[1:52:25] testament it is the Lamb's
[1:52:28] Book of
[1:52:31] Life the
[1:52:33] book that is so despised in this last
[1:52:37] day you know what the title of it
[1:52:41] is the closing
[1:52:44] book of this new
[1:52:46] testament it's called The Book of the
[1:52:50] revelation of Jesus
[1:52:52] Christ and men don't want nothing to do
[1:52:56] with what are they
[1:52:58] rejecting they're rejecting the
[1:53:02] revelation of Jesus Christ in their
[1:53:06] lives where will that take you that
[1:53:10] rejection to a devil's
[1:53:13] hell to a polygamous
[1:53:16] lifestyle foration and
[1:53:18] adultery
[1:53:21] a
[1:53:22] proverb Israel was given many
[1:53:28] Proverbs let me read you just a
[1:53:31] few or just even
[1:53:34] one in Exodus
[1:53:37] 20 verse 4 and
[1:53:41] 5 this was not thus sayith the
[1:53:44] Lord this was a proverb it reads like
[1:53:48] this EX
[1:53:50] 20 and verse 4 he said Thou shalt not
[1:53:55] make unto thee any Graven
[1:53:58] image or any likeness of anything that
[1:54:01] is in heaven
[1:54:03] above or that is in the earth
[1:54:06] beneath or that is in the water under
[1:54:08] the
[1:54:09] Earth he said Thou shalt not bow down
[1:54:12] thyself to
[1:54:14] them
[1:54:16] nor nor serve them for I the Lord thy
[1:54:20] God am a jealous
[1:54:23] God visiting the iniquity of the
[1:54:26] fathers upon the children unto the third
[1:54:30] and fourth generation
[1:54:38] of and
[1:54:41] today we have a
[1:54:43] proverb that one
[1:54:46] person in the
[1:54:48] congregation
[1:54:50] can bring a curse on the whole
[1:54:54] church and everyone will be part of that
[1:55:02] iniquity if you make it a
[1:55:05] Doctrine you go way far
[1:55:11] off it was a
[1:55:13] proverb it would
[1:55:15] change when did it
[1:55:17] change in the days of Ezekiel
[1:55:21] Ezekiel
[1:55:23] 18 beginning at verse
[1:55:25] one and it says here the word of the
[1:55:29] Lord came unto me
[1:55:31] again saying that means thus saith the
[1:55:36] Lord what mean ye that you use this
[1:55:41] proverb concerning the land of
[1:55:44] Israel saying that the fathers have
[1:55:46] eaten sour
[1:55:48] grapes and the children's teeth are set
[1:55:51] on
[1:55:53] edge in other words the fathers have
[1:55:56] committed
[1:55:58] sin I visit the sin on the
[1:56:04] children that's where it was saying
[1:56:06] verse three as I as I live sayth the
[1:56:10] Lord
[1:56:11] God he shall not have occasion
[1:56:14] anymore to use this proverb in
[1:56:18] Israel he said
[1:56:20] behold All Souls are
[1:56:22] mine as the soul of the father so also
[1:56:26] the soul of the son is
[1:56:28] M now the soul that
[1:56:32] sinth it shall
[1:56:34] die you
[1:56:36] see what sometimes things that we make
[1:56:40] laws and doctrines in our
[1:56:44] churches are not thus sayith the lord
[1:56:48] it's a proverb and many of them we
[1:56:50] should
[1:56:53] change we should we
[1:56:57] must
[1:56:59] Ezekiel 18
[1:57:02] ver4
[1:57:04] now if he beg get a
[1:57:07] son that seeth all his father's sins
[1:57:10] which he has
[1:57:13] done and
[1:57:15] consider and do it not such
[1:57:18] like
[1:57:19] that hath not eaten up
[1:57:22] mountains neither hath lifted up his
[1:57:24] eyes to
[1:57:26] Idols of the House of Israel had not
[1:57:29] defiled his neighbor's
[1:57:31] wife neither have oppressed
[1:57:34] any not withholding The
[1:57:37] Pledge neither have spoiled by
[1:57:40] violence but had given his bread to the
[1:57:43] hungry and covered the naked with a
[1:57:47] garment that had not taken off his hand
[1:57:50] from the
[1:57:51] poor did not receive Usery nor
[1:57:55] increase as executed my
[1:57:58] judgments and walked in my
[1:58:01] statutes he shall not die for the
[1:58:04] iniquity of his father he shall surely
[1:58:10] live Ezekiel
[1:58:12] saying the
[1:58:14] proverb that I'll visit this
[1:58:18] iniquity to the third and fourth
[1:58:22] generation he says no
[1:58:26] more no more thus saith the Lord the
[1:58:31] soul that
[1:58:32] sinth that Soul shall surely die that's
[1:58:35] the one I'll
[1:58:38] judge that's the one I'll
[1:58:48] judge
[1:58:53] like all truths of the
[1:58:56] Bible they all come
[1:58:59] together they all
[1:59:03] inter so when you speak on the Born
[1:59:06] Again
[1:59:07] experience you get to
[1:59:10] speaking on things on marriage and
[1:59:13] divorce when you speak on the refilling
[1:59:15] of the Holy
[1:59:17] Ghost it brings in so many
[1:59:20] things because the book has been
[1:59:23] open and now we see everything's
[1:59:26] connecting now when God gives us a
[1:59:29] revelation we put a comma because we
[1:59:32] understand there's
[1:59:34] more of the Revelation he gives us that
[1:59:38] we get excited
[1:59:41] about what's even more exciting and
[1:59:45] wonderful is to say if I understand this
[1:59:48] much more
[1:59:51] more how much more is there yet to
[1:59:54] understand and
[1:59:55] see because it's an eternal
[1:59:58] word it's God's
[2:00:01] word and Jesus
[2:00:06] declares the New
[2:00:08] Covenant For All
[2:00:10] Mankind sinner
[2:00:13] saint belever
[2:00:15] unbeliever but only the believer cares
[2:00:20] enough to
[2:00:22] want to put the
[2:00:24] revelation of marriage and
[2:00:27] divorce for our day in practice remember
[2:00:33] polygamy was us was a
[2:00:39] sinful was a sinful and Fallen
[2:00:46] lifestyle introduced to Eve by the
[2:00:48] serpent
[2:00:52] and injected into all
[2:00:54] Humanity an attribute of the seed of the
[2:00:59] serpent it complicated and brought pain
[2:01:02] and
[2:01:04] sorrow and
[2:01:06] separation to that first
[2:01:08] marriage and it does it every marriage
[2:01:11] since
[2:01:13] then the type of
[2:01:15] Christ his wife being a many membered
[2:01:18] body
[2:01:20] doesn't translate down to Fallen
[2:01:24] man giving giving him a Godly
[2:01:29] right to have more than one
[2:01:32] wife or Jesus was wrong when he said one
[2:01:37] exception no no longer for any
[2:01:41] reason he brought change to Israel from
[2:01:45] any
[2:01:46] reason to just one reason
[2:01:50] and his disciples
[2:01:53] said you should have warned
[2:01:56] us before you preach this series on
[2:01:58] marriage and
[2:02:00] divorce this is you just caught us by
[2:02:03] surprise this
[2:02:05] morning if that be the case of a
[2:02:08] man why even get
[2:02:15] married
[2:02:17] so
[2:02:20] the type of
[2:02:21] Christ his wife being a many membered
[2:02:26] body doesn't translate to Fallen
[2:02:30] man giving him a Godly
[2:02:33] right to have more than one wife or
[2:02:37] Jesus was
[2:02:38] wrong when he said one
[2:02:41] exception for
[2:02:43] remarriage and that was
[2:02:46] fornication not adultery
[2:02:49] because then it would
[2:02:51] be two
[2:02:54] exceptions when it's just
[2:02:57] one and men say no no brother
[2:03:01] Daniel fornication or adultery either
[2:03:04] one now you make it two
[2:03:08] exceptions Jesus said
[2:03:13] one Matthew 19 once
[2:03:17] again we begin at verse one
[2:03:21] and it came to pass that when Jesus had
[2:03:24] finished these Saints he departed from
[2:03:27] Galilee and came into the coast of Judea
[2:03:29] Beyond
[2:03:36] Jordan and great multitudes follow him
[2:03:39] and he healed them
[2:03:42] there a healing
[2:03:44] campaign of the ministry of the son of
[2:03:47] man catching the attention of the
[2:03:51] people so they could have confidence in
[2:03:54] him when they seen the great
[2:03:58] miracle that his word was as good as his
[2:04:03] miracles verse
[2:04:05] three the Pharisees also came unto him
[2:04:08] tempting him tempting
[2:04:10] him tempting
[2:04:13] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[2:04:16] a man to put away his wife for every
[2:04:18] cause
[2:04:21] they thought they had the
[2:04:24] answer that would shut his
[2:04:27] mouth and find him
[2:04:31] guilty to be put to death verse four and
[2:04:35] he answered and said unto them have ye
[2:04:37] not read that he which made them at the
[2:04:40] beginning made them male and
[2:04:46] female or he put him on the spot
[2:04:50] I thought you guys were Bible
[2:04:54] readers what are you doing every
[2:04:57] evening what are you doing every
[2:05:00] weekend what are you doing in your spare
[2:05:05] time oh now I know too many
[2:05:13] videos that's what God's coming to
[2:05:15] change
[2:05:17] also the
[2:05:23] Temptation that robs us of our
[2:05:26] time to meditate on
[2:05:29] him blessed is the
[2:05:32] man in
[2:05:35] 2023 that meditates on my
[2:05:39] word day and
[2:05:42] night and he answered and said unto them
[2:05:45] verse four have ye not read that he
[2:05:47] which made them at the beginning made
[2:05:48] them male and
[2:05:52] female and said for this cause shall a
[2:05:55] man leave father and mother and shall
[2:05:57] cleave to his wife and they twain shall
[2:06:00] be one
[2:06:04] flesh wherefore they are no more Twain
[2:06:08] but one flesh what
[2:06:10] therefore what therefore God hath joined
[2:06:14] together let no man put
[2:06:17] aunder
[2:06:22] not even
[2:06:24] Moses they say unto him why did Moses
[2:06:29] then command to give a writing of
[2:06:31] divorcement and put her
[2:06:36] away Jesus said I was hoping you would
[2:06:40] ask that
[2:06:43] question because that's the one you
[2:06:45] really need answer
[2:06:47] to
[2:06:53] he said unto
[2:06:55] them
[2:06:58] Moses Moses your
[2:07:01] prophet in this day because of the
[2:07:05] hardness of your
[2:07:06] hearts suffered you to put away your
[2:07:10] wives but from the
[2:07:13] beginning it was not so and the reason
[2:07:16] I've
[2:07:17] come Lion of the tribe of
[2:07:20] Judah
[2:07:21] Messiah God made
[2:07:24] fresh is to take you
[2:07:27] back me in the beginning it has
[2:07:32] begun the
[2:07:34] restoration of the Bride tree the
[2:07:37] restoration of the Fig Tree the
[2:07:41] restoration Daniel FR and
[2:07:45] kenth Lopez it has begun
[2:07:50] restoration this is the day that the
[2:07:52] Lord has made to change you and
[2:07:56] I do you see
[2:08:01] it he saith unto them
[2:08:05] Moses because of the hardness of your
[2:08:10] heart suffered you to put away your
[2:08:13] wife because he was
[2:08:16] unable to give you a born again
[2:08:20] experience but I
[2:08:22] jesus I can do
[2:08:25] that that's why I'm telling you you can
[2:08:28] be changed
[2:08:30] now I'm offering you a born again
[2:08:34] experience the changing power of the
[2:08:37] Lamb of
[2:08:39] God that's why he shed his blood on
[2:08:43] calary that's why Blood fell on the
[2:08:46] earth s ify that's why the blood wants
[2:08:50] to fall on you this
[2:08:52] morning sanify
[2:09:00] you he said unto them
[2:09:03] Moses because of the hardness of your
[2:09:06] hearts suffered you to put away your
[2:09:12] wives but from the
[2:09:14] beginning it was not so so why would
[2:09:19] someone finally come to a
[2:09:23] place of
[2:09:26] divorce I'm not judging no
[2:09:28] one but it's because Hearts have become
[2:09:34] hardened and you can say wait a minute
[2:09:36] brother but I had a
[2:09:39] reason for all your
[2:09:41] reasons the heart still became
[2:09:46] hardened God wants to give you
[2:09:49] he wants to soften the
[2:09:52] heart with oil verse
[2:10:07] n and I say unto you whosoever shall put
[2:10:11] away his
[2:10:13] wife not for any
[2:10:15] reason but except it be for for
[2:10:20] and shall marry
[2:10:21] another committeth
[2:10:23] adultery and whosoever marri
[2:10:26] her that is put
[2:10:28] away that commit
[2:10:31] adultery once the ball of sin starts
[2:10:36] rolling it's a
[2:10:38] mess his disciples say unto him if the
[2:10:42] case of man be so with his
[2:10:46] wife it's not good to marry
[2:10:49] it's not good to
[2:10:51] marry and I
[2:10:53] agree until you've been born
[2:10:56] again it's not good it's not good for a
[2:10:59] young
[2:11:00] lady to marry a young man who hasn't
[2:11:04] been born again who hasn't received the
[2:11:07] Holy Ghost in his
[2:11:08] life not good for a young man to marry a
[2:11:12] young
[2:11:13] woman who hasn't been born again who
[2:11:17] hasn't received the baptism
[2:11:22] because the young
[2:11:24] lady through a born-again
[2:11:27] experience who's who's learned to be
[2:11:30] faithful to Jesus
[2:11:32] Christ serving the lord for years
[2:11:35] now guess what she knows what it takes
[2:11:40] to remain faithful to
[2:11:43] someone only death can part
[2:11:47] you that's
[2:11:49] why young man you want a young
[2:11:54] lady that loves God and has been
[2:11:58] faithful to
[2:12:00] him young lady that's why you want a
[2:12:02] young
[2:12:03] [Music]
[2:12:05] man who's proved his faithfulness to
[2:12:10] God because in doing
[2:12:12] so he is
[2:12:15] showing that he can be faithful
[2:12:19] to a young
[2:12:30] lady now the truth of marriage and
[2:12:34] divorce is found in the
[2:12:36] mouth of three
[2:12:38] Witnesses Jesus Christ the Apostle
[2:12:42] Paul Moses an Old Testament
[2:12:46] Prophet brother Bram
[2:12:49] tied the loose ends
[2:12:51] together of what Jesus
[2:12:54] said what Paul said what Moses
[2:12:58] said all three of these
[2:13:01] men were
[2:13:03] prophets thus sayith the
[2:13:06] Lord and it required a prophetic
[2:13:10] Ministry to tie them together for
[2:13:13] us and the revelation of marriage and
[2:13:16] divorce has come to us in the mouth of
[2:13:20] these three
[2:13:22] Witnesses here is our first witness this
[2:13:26] morning it's Jesus Christ
[2:13:32] himself Jesus said the Pharisees also
[2:13:36] came unto him tempting
[2:13:41] him trying to find
[2:13:44] fault think thinking they'd been in the
[2:13:47] message a long time
[2:13:50] and that they had all the answers to
[2:13:53] everything what they had was
[2:13:56] Proverbs with
[2:14:00] periods you know that's what we have
[2:14:04] today in this message we've been taught
[2:14:08] Proverbs with periods instead of thus
[2:14:11] sayth the
[2:14:13] Lord the Pharisees also came unto him
[2:14:16] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[2:14:18] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[2:14:20] for every
[2:14:26] cause they they they were thinking he
[2:14:29] would say yes of course Moses said
[2:14:33] it yeah it's a quote in the message I'll
[2:14:36] read it for
[2:14:38] you and he answered and said unto them
[2:14:41] have you not
[2:14:43] read aren't you Bible
[2:14:45] readers that he which made them at the
[2:14:48] beginning made them male and
[2:14:51] female and he said for this cause shall
[2:14:55] a man leave father and
[2:14:56] mother and cleave to his wife and they
[2:15:00] twain shall be one
[2:15:02] flesh cleave here is the Greek
[2:15:10] word it means to join
[2:15:14] oneself
[2:15:16] closely so so close you become one
[2:15:22] flesh verse six says wherefore there are
[2:15:25] no more Twain but one
[2:15:30] flesh what therefore God hath joined
[2:15:35] together let no man put us
[2:15:39] under everything had
[2:15:42] changed it was a drastic
[2:15:45] change it was thus sayith the
[2:15:49] Lord it wasn't for
[2:15:52] everyone only the
[2:15:54] believer only the man and woman that
[2:15:56] loved
[2:15:58] God embraced the
[2:16:02] change only the man and woman that love
[2:16:06] God took the fire of God into their
[2:16:10] bosom and said yes
[2:16:16] I
[2:16:18] Jesus
[2:16:21] said they say unto him why did Moses
[2:16:24] then command to give a writing a
[2:16:26] divorcement and put her
[2:16:32] away he said I'm glad you asked that
[2:16:35] question I've got another answer for
[2:16:38] you he said
[2:16:41] Moses of the hardness of your
[2:16:44] heart the same hardness in your heart
[2:16:47] that you're coming here to tempt me with
[2:16:49] the
[2:16:51] word it's the same hardness in your
[2:16:54] hearts for your for your marriage
[2:16:59] vow Moses because of the hardness of
[2:17:02] your
[2:17:03] hearts suffered you to put away your
[2:17:06] wives instead of kill them instead of
[2:17:10] doing them
[2:17:11] violence instead of being
[2:17:14] abusive but from the beginning was not
[2:17:20] so it wasn't so from the
[2:17:33] beginning verse
[2:17:35] n and I say unto you who shall ever
[2:17:39] shall put away his
[2:17:41] wife he didn't say
[2:17:44] adultery he said
[2:17:46] fornication now mixes the word
[2:17:50] wife with the word
[2:17:52] fornication and shall marry another
[2:17:55] committeth adultery and whosoever
[2:17:58] marrieth
[2:18:00] her which is put away does commit
[2:18:04] adultery his disciples said unto him if
[2:18:08] the case of the man be so with his
[2:18:12] wife it's not good to
[2:18:14] marry you know what caused them to make
[2:18:17] that statement
[2:18:21] even after that wonderful service that
[2:18:25] day their hearts were still
[2:18:29] hardened to hear the truth didn't soften
[2:18:32] the
[2:18:34] heart to hear the
[2:18:36] truth said well if that's the way you're
[2:18:38] going to be in this church I'll go
[2:18:39] somewhere
[2:18:44] else God never changed
[2:18:48] the one
[2:18:49] Commandment that he left for sinner or
[2:18:53] Saint to abide
[2:18:55] by so even under
[2:18:59] polygamy there might be order and mercy
[2:19:02] for the
[2:19:05] woman you cannot take another man's
[2:19:10] wife has been something that God has
[2:19:12] told
[2:19:15] man ever since the beginning
[2:19:19] when a man called The
[2:19:21] Serpent took another man's
[2:19:24] wife
[2:19:28] Eve that still applies
[2:19:31] today and here's the Bible reason
[2:19:34] why and this is the woman's New Covenant
[2:19:37] after the
[2:19:39] fall a woman is bound to her
[2:19:45] husband as long as as he
[2:19:49] lives that's the that's what that's that
[2:19:51] was the New
[2:19:53] Covenant that is what she felt him
[2:19:56] remember Genesis
[2:19:58] 3:16 unto the woman he
[2:20:01] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[2:20:05] and thy
[2:20:15] conception sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[2:20:19] children if they had done it God's way
[2:20:22] they wouldn't be going through
[2:20:25] that then God tells them and thy desire
[2:20:29] shall be to thy
[2:20:31] husband because her desire at
[2:20:35] first for a moment had been to another
[2:20:40] man you see the language God uses
[2:20:44] what he said and he shall rule over
[2:20:49] thee it wasn't so it wasn't that way
[2:20:53] till after the
[2:20:55] fall when a man when a woman accepts a
[2:20:59] man's proposal for
[2:21:03] marriage if she has a father at
[2:21:07] home he should have helped her to
[2:21:12] choose rightous God-fearing
[2:21:16] man
[2:21:18] as fathers we must help our daughters
[2:21:22] choose we want them to marry a man they
[2:21:25] love of
[2:21:28] course but as fathers we must be
[2:21:32] involved to
[2:21:34] judge if the man is
[2:21:38] worthy if he's ready to be a husband to
[2:21:42] any
[2:21:43] woman when our daughters
[2:21:46] marry we turn
[2:21:48] over full
[2:21:50] headship to another
[2:21:53] man once you give her
[2:21:56] away you have no right to go over there
[2:21:59] and tell them how to
[2:22:01] live you have no right to go to your
[2:22:04] daughter and tell her how you want her
[2:22:05] to be
[2:22:08] acting no you should face the husband
[2:22:12] now to whom you gave all this full
[2:22:14] headship
[2:22:16] to and if you don't like it you
[2:22:19] shouldn't have given him full headship
[2:22:21] over that girl
[2:22:26] daughter oh husbands men in the house we
[2:22:30] need a real Holy Ghost
[2:22:35] backbone the love of God standing in the
[2:22:39] gap for our
[2:22:42] girls did you hear
[2:22:46] that
[2:22:47] we want to them to marry a man they
[2:22:51] love but we as
[2:22:55] fathers we must be
[2:22:57] involved to judge if the man is
[2:23:00] worthy for when our daughters
[2:23:03] marry we turn
[2:23:06] over full
[2:23:08] headship to another man and she is bound
[2:23:12] to that
[2:23:14] man as long as she lives
[2:23:19] if they
[2:23:20] divorce dear
[2:23:22] sister you cannot by the word of
[2:23:26] God
[2:23:27] remarry unless he
[2:23:32] dies is it
[2:23:35] fair no it's not but God but God Made
[2:23:40] You coal with man in the
[2:23:44] beginning Lucifer through the serpent
[2:23:48] beguiled Eve with his
[2:23:50] words just as many serpents are
[2:23:52] beguiling young women today
[2:23:56] with and Disobedience to God's
[2:24:00] word uned her first
[2:24:02] Covenant and gave her a
[2:24:05] covenant I hate to say it but equal to
[2:24:09] her
[2:24:10] conduct the Bible says all that we
[2:24:16] s
[2:24:20] and
[2:24:23] yet God promises us
[2:24:27] change through a born again
[2:24:34] experience Matthew
[2:24:37] 19:7 they say unto
[2:24:39] him why did Moses then command to give a
[2:24:43] writing a divorcement and put it away
[2:24:50] remember it was a
[2:24:53] proverb he saith unto
[2:24:56] them
[2:24:57] Moses because of the hardness of your
[2:25:01] hearts suffered you to put away your
[2:25:04] wives from the
[2:25:06] beginning it was not
[2:25:09] so and I say unto you whosoever shall
[2:25:12] put away his
[2:25:14] wife except it be for for
[2:25:18] fornication and shall marry
[2:25:21] another committeth adultery and who so
[2:25:24] Marth her which is put
[2:25:26] away do commit
[2:25:29] adultery his disciples say unto him if
[2:25:32] the case of the man beow with his wife
[2:25:35] it's not good to
[2:25:38] Mar and they said the
[2:25:40] statement because one service had not
[2:25:43] changed their
[2:25:44] hearts there was still a Harden
[2:25:49] remember it's one cause not two
[2:25:54] fornication not fornication and
[2:25:58] adultery that would be two
[2:26:01] causes so Jesus is now opening the
[2:26:05] book been sealed with Seven
[2:26:08] Seals and it's telling you now the truth
[2:26:11] of marriage and
[2:26:15] divorce verse nine he said again in
[2:26:19] closing now I say unto you whosoever
[2:26:23] shall put away his
[2:26:25] wife except that be for
[2:26:29] fornication this is Jesus talking this
[2:26:32] is God made
[2:26:34] flesh and shall marry
[2:26:36] another commit adultery and who so marri
[2:26:40] her which is put
[2:26:42] away does commit adultery Jesus now
[2:26:45] tells us
[2:26:47] there's only
[2:26:49] one
[2:26:50] exception for a man to put away his
[2:26:53] wife and Mar
[2:26:56] another that's
[2:26:59] fornication no brother what if she cuts
[2:27:02] her
[2:27:06] hair can I leave her for
[2:27:08] that if your heart is that hardened I
[2:27:11] guess you
[2:27:13] could but you cannot remarry her and be
[2:27:17] just before
[2:27:19] God because there's only one
[2:27:22] cause and trimming the
[2:27:24] hair wasn't that
[2:27:30] cause what if she's a terrible
[2:27:34] cook send her to get
[2:27:38] lessons don't leave her go with
[2:27:42] her we're closing with this Jesus
[2:27:47] our first witness as we stand to our
[2:27:55] feet it was part
[2:27:57] five part six is
[2:28:00] coming with the other
[2:28:02] witnesses as we bow our
[2:28:04] heads Heavenly
[2:28:06] Father we thank you

[2:28:21] men asking for
[2:28:23] Revelation and this is an eternal
[2:28:26] word and you will be the final
[2:28:31] judge on Judgment
[2:28:34] Day we're not bringing
[2:28:37] judgment we're trying to share with your
[2:28:41] people and trying to share with young
[2:28:44] people a better way
[2:28:47] a more excellent
[2:28:52] way but for many of us who have made
[2:28:57] mistakes the Born Again

[2:29:05] Grace as we as we humbly bow on our
[2:29:11] knees and say Lord in our
