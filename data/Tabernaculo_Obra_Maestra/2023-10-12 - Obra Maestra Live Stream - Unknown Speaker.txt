on Bel God bless you it's going to be the house of the Living God I don't know about you but I'm happy to be in the house of God it's it's cool we can go to the there there's fairs there's things you can do as a family but there's nothing like going to the house of God there's a problem when you can have Joys more so much more somewhere else than here oh that you can go to a to to a fair or you can go to a place and you can just have a good time and and get into a spirit of that that that atmosphere but how much more should we get in the spirit of God's atmosphere when it comes to worshiping the Lord or we go out there and we we we sure have a smile on our faces oh we sure are shouting we are sure happy what about in the house of the Lord what about coming to the house of the Lord what about hearing his word oh we can sit somewhere be so awake amen but what about in the house of the Lord that's just something extra I just feel that in my heart amen amen amen I believe that we should come to Worship the Lord I I believe we should come with the expectation amen amen right I believe in this last day because of the Revelation that we have have because a prophet came in this day amen amen the more Revelation that you have the more attacked you get by the devil he doesn't like it when you have more Revelation why because he's scared of Revelation because brother brandham said that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail why because a church is built on Revelation amen he said Peter who do you say that I am amen what do he say thou Christ the son of the Living God Amen he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which are in heaven on this will I build my church amen when he said I'll build my church on that he had me and you in his thoughts he wanted to build us on that on that Foundation why because heaven can pass away Earth can pass away but God's word will never that's why he wants to build us on his word because the word won't move though these things happen in this earth though the things happen in Israel right now thr all the wars and wars and rumors of [Applause] wars yet when it comes to a Believer they're not worried about these things around them but yet the only thing that's on their mind the only thing that's in their heart is getting prepared to get out of here why because we're not staying here we shouldn't plan on staying here I'm not waiting for a big nuclear attack to happen the prophet said that the Rapture will happen before that happens so I'm not waiting for that to happen amen but I'm getting ready now because God has given us his word to be able to prepare to be able to get ready amen because he's the prophet said the bride has made herself ready through the sufferings through the trials through all the hardship amen this is a character building process amen but let me tell you we have to let him build us up amen amen we have to be the Lord tells us to be strong and of good courage amen that's uh my thought for today is be strong amen amen we could all stand up and in Joshua the first chapter and the fifth verse this might be lengthy but I'll try to see if I can stop somewhere says uh now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses ministering [Music] saying he said Moses my servant is dead and now therefore arise and go to the Jordan thou and all the people unto the land which I do give unto them even to the children of is every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that I have given unto you I said unto Moses from the Wilderness of the libon Lebanon Lebanon Lebanon unto the Great River of Euphrates and unto the land of hites hites and unto the great sea toward towards the going down of the sun shall be your Coast says there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake [Music] thee that that's a promise to me and you amen because God don't have a favoritism amen amen so he didn't just favor Joshua and said guess what Joshua I'm I'm going be with you I'll never forsake you that only that wasn't only to him but that was to you and I that's why this this was written in the Book of Life to give us life amen amen now look what the next verse says after he says I won't forsake thee he says be strong and of good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for inheritance of the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them he says only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do all thing according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it right hand or the left thou mayest Prosper whatsoever thou goest now in verse n it says haven't I not commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with the whever thou goest you see he wanted Joshua to to know he didn't want Joshua to forget he reminded him like three times be strong be courageous haven't I not told you be strong and of good courage that's what he's telling us tonight to be strong and courageous and then what does he tell us he says hav I not commanded thee be strong in a good courage it says Be not Afraid neither be thou dismay why because where he goes where you go he goes also right let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your presence Lord we're praying Lord God and we come here we come here for one purpose and is to whack this enemy Lord God give us your word Lord Jesus show us Lord God in the scriptures oh that we can be encouraged today Lord be with everybody that's watching watching in Lord God everybody that's here Lord for your Omni presentent Lord God you're everywhere Lord Lord be with brother Daniel as he's going to be resting sister Karen too Lord God gives her strength Lord we thank thee we can go through a lot of things Lord God but that we can live leave here Lord with the burn in our heart heart saying did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way help us Lord in Jesus name amen amen you may uh have your seats in Joshua 21 it says and Joshua the son of nun sent out to him two men to spy out secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and came into the harlot's house named Rahab and there they had to LOD there because the king found out that they're in town and the King he wanted to interrogate them why because all of Jericho were they were scared of they seen that two men came and they're going to check out the land and they knew what that meant but as they came to rahab's house and asked for them amen RAB just told him that they went somewhere else amen and she begins to talk to these Messengers and she says in verse n and she said unto the men I know that the Lord has given you the the land and the terror is Fallen upon us that all the inhabitants of the land Fain Because of You amen it says for we have heard how how the Lord dried up the Waters of the Red Sea for you and when ye came out of Egypt and when ye did unto the two kings of the amorites and when on the other side of Jordan Sion and ogi whom ye utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did Mount neither did they remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God is he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath what an amazing thing amen how uh how someone that was just thrown out for prostitution because her looks her parents they gave her up could be able to receive Messengers that just goes to show you see this message which is Christ it's for everyone amen don't matter what you did amen Rahab she went out and she was just messing around with the whole world but God sent Messenger to her house to be able to speak to her heart why because he seen a faith that didn't need to see any signs oh I believe if I see a miracle I'll believe if I see someone else healed I'll believe if I see someone dead rise up but she didn't need to see none of that she simply said I heard I heard the god that is with you matter of fact we all our hearts are all scared everyone here is defeated the Bible says that Joshua got up early in the morning Amen in Joshua 3 verse 5 it says and Joshua said unto the people people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you and Joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant and pass over the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to to magnify thee in the sight of Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee and thou shalt command the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when ye come out to brink of the water of Jordan ye shall stand in stand still in Jordan why did the ark need to go first before the children of Israel turn me to second Samuel verse 11 the Bible says that the Ark of the Lord continued in the H House of what does that say right there obededom obededom and uh G giti three months and the Lord blessed obededom and his household and it was told to King David saying the Lord has blessed the house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him why was his house so blessed the Bible says it was because of the Ark of the god it's because the Ark of the God was in his house that's why his house was blessed you see so David he went up and brought the Ark of God from the house of obededom into the city of David with gladness and so that's why they put the ark first that's why they wanted to Arc around the children of Israel because wherever the ark was whoever was there was blessed amen now in Joshua 3 back to Joshua 3 and 13 it says and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the of the priest bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down above and they shall shall stand upon a heap amen and it says and and it and it and it came to pass when the people removed their tents to pass over the Jordan that the priest bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as they bear the ark were come as they be the ark were come unto Jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for Jordan overfloweth at the banks all the time at Harvest amen so you know that bank it was must have been really overflowed you can go to Waters and when you see that it's overflowed you know it's overflowed then when the water gets too low you'll know when it when when it's overflow how high it [Music] is and the 17 it says and the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan and all the Israelites passed over the dry ground until the people were passed clean over Jordan you see the Ark of God was right there and and and stayed right there until everybody got past amen so everyone that went past were blessed amen and and as soon as everybody went and they removed it that's when the water will all come back in Joshua 4 verse 21 says and he spake unto the children of Israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in the time to come saying what mean is these Stones then ye shall let your children know saying Israel came over this Jordan on dry land amen that was a memorial for their children amen amen oh that we could leave such a memor a memorial for our children it was a memorial for their children their children's children how God himself was in their midst and that they can pass through a dry ground that was with that was overflowing with water in verse 23 it says for the Lord your God dried up the Waters of Jordan from before you until ye passed over as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea which he dried up before us until we were gone [Music] over amen it says that all the people of the earth might know that the hand of the Lord that is mighty that ye might fear the lord your God forever amen in Joshua chapter 5 in verse 13 says and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as a captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face on the earth and did worship and said unto him what sayith my Lord unto his servant amen he says and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoes from thy foot for the place whereon thy standers is holy and Joshua did so my amen he just he just looked and he seen the captain of the Lord's host with the sword pull out sword I like how brother Bram said says has his take on this he said walking along there he seen a man and a man stood with his with Drew his sword just a man looked like a man it said and Joshua perhaps being a chief Warrior Drew out his sword too walking to meet him and said who are you are you for us or are you for the our adversaries and he said the man I could see lift his sword high and say no I'm the captain of the host of the Lord the god of Israel and brother BR says that the captain of the of the host who was this captain of the host see Joshua said he reached down and un loosed in his shoes and found his face before him and said what would you what would the Lord have me do amen you see after after he was getting in in his position he was you see he was a greatest military man that there ever was on the face of the Earth there has never been a general like Joshua no time no age amen has there ever been someone compared with Joshua he said that Joshua the word Joshua means a a savior or deliverer and so we see that this man this man was a that that it was a captain in other words he was a leader of the of the host of Israel and the leader was no other no other than Christ himself and what was his what was his what was his first seen how was he first seen in the pillar of fire he said and now the pillar of fire had become a man had changed into another form he said I hope hope you know what I'm talking about he had become a man but you see he says don't be troubled he says I believe here tonight amen how how I love that that I believe that the pillar of fire is with us tonight do we believe that amen amen truly we have to ask oursel in our heart we believe that captain of the Lord's host is here tonight with his sword pulled amen he may be with a sword pulled you see uh the medical field they try to make cures for cancer but you see the Devil he's just a bluff you see brother says but when the sword of Christ comes down he will never withstand that he can't come against that he will chop through every Cancer he will CH through every Blind [Music] Eye you see I like how he says that how Joshua he seen that he said he seen the captain of the Lord's House with the sword in his [Music] hand but now brother Brandon saying that the Lord has a sword out amen and he has it out tonight here too amen amen to cut every Cancer to cut through every unbelief to cut through every half walk Halfway Christian to cut through all that you see he's here tonight great Supernatural Lord Jesus Christ The Great I Am the alpha the Omega the beginning and the end amen amen but you see there is a sword in the the the Lord's hand I like how Joshua seen that there was a sword and he had it out but see at Ephesians 6:17 it says take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God right see not only did not only is that sworded in Jesus's [Music] hand but he said the things that I do you shall do also and greater things not that we would be better but that we do more so see that sword that Joshua seen in that in the the Lord's hand but the Lord is telling us here take the sword of the spirit amen what is the sword of the spirit it is the word of God take the word of God Jesus now brother Brown said he hasn't sword out he's cutting through the cancer he's cutting through the Blind Eye when he said he had his sword out amen it was a sword of the spirit it wasn't a natural sword but it was the word of God amen amen what do you want to do then you take the word of God what is the word the Bible said here for the sword of the spirit is God's word amen you take the Hammet of Salvation the sword of the spirit the spirit that comes is it the spirit that comes through your mind and enter enters into you the sword of the spirit is the word of God it's not intellectually what does the spirit fight with he said what does the Holy Spirit fight with Sensations feelings amen amen no no we don't fight with feelings and Sensations amen what does he fight with amen he fights with the word he doesn't fight with feelings the enemy can make you feel a lot of things he can make you feel like this brother's talking about about you that sister's talking about you and that's how he can make people feel but that's see the the Bible the Bible says we need to fight with the sword of the spirit not fight with our feelings not fight with Sensations if there's one thing we're going to fight here with tonight it's going to be the word of the Living God amen amen amen amen you see the spirit of God walks right up to the devil and say it is written just like as he did in the desert amen it is written man shall not live by bread of but by every word of God not just some things not just the ones that you like the most amen amen but all of it amen the whole word of God Amen and that's how the devil gets away amen amen that's how we can get him get him to go away see what do we do we have to take that sword amen with the hand of Faith a strong hand of Faith it's a two-edged sword the Bible said in Hebrews 4 it's a two-edged sword it cuts both coming and going amen see brother what does he do you take the word of God you take the spirit let the Spirit come into your heart open your mind and say Thy word is true amen the word is the truth you see Lord I ain't going to pay attention how I feel or what any anybody anybody else says amen or I'm not I'm not going to get mad at everything I'll get all frustrated all the doubts and and unbelief every feeling I ever had all the sicknesses I ever had everything else I ever had I'm blowing them all up out of the way amen he said I'm coming right straight to my spirit he said come down you made you made me a free moral agent you are my son all right I open my heart I'll open my mind come in Lord Jesus you see you had to grab that faith that sword of the spirit and say thus sayth the Lord amen scream out Hallelujah they cut down every enemy that's in front of you cut every enemy out that spooky Spirits oh that spooky Spirit likes to come amen amen in your health amen gets each other fighting gets it frustrated you see and what the enemy wants is is for us to think so much and dwell on the problem amen he wants us to just we we we find oursel amen just instead of going to pray really fast we get frustrated and keep keep dwelling on the problem instead of letting go and let God having it but then the enemy comes and he he comes and he comes and pours more things in pours more things but I believe that the word of God cuts through all of that that same sword that was in the the the the the the captain of the Lord's host which was Jesus Christ is that same sword that will cut through every problem you have that will cut through through every unbelief that we have amen amen it's our strength the joy of the Lord is our strength we just got to whack that demon with the word we said if it don't go away the first time you whack him again you whack him again and you whack him again what if you still don't want to go away you keep whacking him amen amen and he goes and you say Glory Hallelujah Glu where's the next one oh when you go through a sickness in a problem who wants to go to the next one you're like almost within yourself say I just need a break let me just get a week a week just just everything perfect but see the Bible says that a Christian Life is longsuffering amen amen it's like that song said he never promised that cross would not get heavy he didn't offer any Victory without fighting but he did say help will come in time amen amen you see we got to knock every enemy out amen the Bible says in Exodus 23:22 it says it says uh but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then will I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and adversary unto thy adversar amen amen he says for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the am amorites and thees hites and the parites parasites and the Canaanites and thees hites and the jeites jebusites and I will cut them [Music] off oh I like that the Lord says if you obey my voice I will be an enemy to your enemies I will be an adversary to your adversar not only that I will cut them off amen I tell you what there's an enemy we have here tonight it's Satan in his army but the Bible says if you obey his voice your enemy will be his enemy and that your adversary will be his adversary amen you see the devil's a good adversary amen amen but he ain't stronger than God amen amen why because the Bible says I will cut them off didn't say I might cut him off maybe I'll cut him off no but the promise right here say I will cut them off amen I got some things I want to cut off right now I don't know about you if you got things you want to cut off I got things I want to cut off amen amen but if we just take him at his word the word is sharper than a two-edged sword he said if we obey his word then those things that we need cut off he promised he would cut them off amen amen amen just like like David amen what a remember that time when when Goliath comes amen and he sees and he and he and he sees sa and all the the the army man all Israel and he sees that they're they're afraid amen and he told them that uh aren't you guys Servants of sa you see the reason why he said that because he seen that they're following a man amen amen like I said before if if if they had been following something they believed in they would have been willing to die for that and see Goliath he was a champion they said the Bible says he was a champion so he can tell when someone was afraid and when he seen fear in all their faces he's like oh they're not fighting for what they believe they're saying they believe but they're not fighting so he goes and he calls him out but no one wanted to go out and you see David come along he was only supposed to bring food to his brothers and Goliath got on the way you see he was just going he was going to bring food to his brothers and see that's when Goliath came and and and and made his big boast again which one of you is going to come and fight me amen he he was looking at their faces and seeing oh they're all scared oh but then he saw one he was little he comes out I can see that these men are all taller than him and David comes out he's all like you know what like get get get out of my way comes right out amen amen he says you mean to tell me you'll let this man defile the armies of [Music] God he said I'll go fight him oh Saul said oh you're going to need my helmet you're going to need my shield you need my armor but David started I can't move in this it's too big but you see uh that doctor in that SA in it didn't work for David David was feeding on something else and that very thing he was feeding on was God's word amen and he had an experience so he didn't need all those other things he didn't need someone else's unbelief amen amen why because he knew his defense was the Lord and what happened if sa and Goliath and everybody there would have looked with their spiritual eyes amen amen they would have seen what Joshua saw they would have seen the C of Lord's host with the sword out his hand right there going with his servant David amen and what happened he got some stones and he slayed that that giant that everybody else saw that was a giant not not to David though he's seen it like it was a piece of cake amen he's seen it as a victory amen that didn't come to David that way amen because he knew that the Lord was with him amen because what did he say that Goliath says I come I come with the sword amen and then here comes a captain of The Lord of host Jesus tell tell him who you come by he said I come to you in the name of the Lord amen amen you see it then he went straight up to Goliath and he cut his head off it's pretty graphic but that's what happened the Bible says that it's like shamard they will steal his food every year I worked in the fields with my brother-in-law when you get mud that's blocking the way that the water is supposed to go all the work that you have to do to just get that mud out of the way and that's not even it they have to do everything else amen but when I went with him in that time it was difficult amen I wasn't used to it so Shamar he dealt with all of that having to prepare his Fields all the time have to take time water it fertilize it get it ready amen and then every year they would come and take it amen you see Shar got tired of it he got tired of losing he got tired of being defeated and I believe that's what we need to be we have to be tired of losing tired of being defeated he prayed to the Lord every year say protect me this year you see and it's good to wait on the Lord but see there's times the Lord is waiting on you to go into action and that's what he was waiting for shamard to get into action see Samar started to realize I'm an Israelite God is my God and there goes the lord of the captain of the host again Jesus sword his hand every swung that shangar took amen you could just see the Lord hitting them with them amen he gave Shamar the strength and Peter Peter was a changed man let me tell you they thought they had Peter defeated when they were going to crucify him people many people probably knew Peter wanting to cut the head off of a Roman cuz you know when he was going to cut when he cut the ear on the Roman really he was trying to cut the head off of the Roman so people that that I have to know that was a rumor going around something like that just don't H just just don't happen and it just goes away it's like as that happened in our day the whole entire Phoenix knows about it so in that time everybody knew about it when they see him coming again when they're getting ready to crucify him oh this is the same Peter that denied him three times oh this is the same Peter that almost cut someone's head off but you see Peter he didn't have the same the same the same attitude no more Peter said put me upside down I ain't worthy like he is he didn't say stop it stop it no I don't believe in what you claim me to believe in but something happened to Peter you see Peter he was very encouraged am man he had a lot of Courage you know courage it takes Amen to be able to go go to a place where they're going to crucify you amen and just say don't don't no no don't thing I ask don't crucify me like that if you guys G to crucify me do it upside down amen amen you see how his attitude changed and Paul he said I fight the good good fight I finished my course I kept my faith you see how he can look at that grave and say oh death where is I sting oh grave where is thy Victory amen see the grave said I'll hold you I'll mold you I'll canker I you the worms will eat you up the bones will turn you into dust but Paul said look at that empty tube out y I'm in him amen he said I'm in him and I'll rise on that morning and receive that crown that the Lord the righteous judge will give me amen amen he wasn't scared of the Grave he wasn't scared of death amen but he says grave where is your sting death where is your Victory amen see he was encouraged in his heart he knew inside of his heart amen that if that when he leaves this life he's only changing bodies that this one that's in flesh is done away with and he's going to one that's like [Music] his amen we could all stand up amen amen yeah I won't be able to finish this but one time uh there was a a man amen I believe he was a Catholic boy growing up brother Brandon prayed for his baby amen and and uh a doctor and a and a and a priest came inside the room amen and uh when brother Brandon was saying that you know the praying that the Lord would heal this uh believe it was a [Music] child he says I prayed about 10 times and I said raise I I raised up and I said Lord don't let this poor little mother die he said I got up from off the floor where I was praying for her and I got up just kind of with my wife with my eyes wiped and he says the vision left me he said I walk out the door kind of smiling my overcoat and my arm he said there stood the father and all them out there the priest rather the doctor and all them standing out there and and said amen amen I believe this guy's wife was dying amen and uh while he walked down the husband said Reverend brandom he said have you have any use [Music] news he said yes sir I have some good news for you he said thus say the Lord your wife is going home well he said that she was going to get worse for a bit but before the night's over amen that they're going to put her in this certain thing cuz she was going to be so slow but he said I said he said after that she's going to come out and by this time in the morning and the night your wife will go home this sayth the Lord you see the priest was was praying you know cuz and he was like they like sprinkling like water or oil when someone dies and while the priest was wanting to do that brother Brandon was wanting to bring life back into her you see what a difference when someone has thus say the Lord amen every all these people could tell him what they want to tell her tell this Dad that his your wife is going to die but brother Bron broke out in a vision and the Lord show him that she was going to live that she was going to get worse you know so sometimes it gets worse before it gets better that's with sickness is amen amen man he says that the people began to rejoice and the priest just shook his head and the doctors just shook his head then they they looked at him they looked at they they walked down like he was gone crazy she says so I looked at them until they passed on by and the father of that boy went up and said look son he says haven't we got enough nonsense he said look daddy he said I took my first baby over there to brother Brandon and he prayed for it amen and the baby was healed it had some Clump feet his feet were crooked I'm assuming I said one day I was over there and someone else said while I was sitting in the room brother Bram told me within 24 hours my baby's feet would be straight straightened and the next morning the wife and I jumped up that same time run to the cradle and said both the feet were just normal amen and he said if brother brandham says thus sayith the Lord he got they got the priest negative report they got the doctor's negative report they got a father's NE negative report but this husband said if if brother Brown says thus sayith the Lord that my wife is going home in 24 hours I like this brother's Faith he says good goodbye I'm going home to straighten up the house to get her home and the way he went he went and straightened up that house and in 24 hours she she she was home and been there ever since but what was it am you see the same Lord that was right there with Joshua had took out his sword amen Amen brother ra said in the meeting said that the Christ had has a sort out cutting through cancer cutting through all that things you see this man believed if God said it was going to come to pass thus said the Lord what God Said is going to pass amen amen it didn't matter what anybody else said it didn't matter it didn't matter what anybody could try to convince someone but you see while while while he was told this am man he just took off just flat out said oh I'm going home I'm going to cuz he believed with all his heart that it was Happ God wants us to to to to be strong and courageous amen I believe that we can believe for big things amen we think that someone's blind we need to believe that they can receive their sight if someone's de we need to believe that they can hear amen if someone's dying we need to believe that God can rise them up you see I agree I agree and I I know that doctors are good they can help but it's like uh I was talking with uh brother Kenny one time says you know what the problem is we don't wait long enough amen amen we we got to wait on the Lord and wait to to actually have him come down amen amen and perform something that needs to be performed amen amen ever since that day I've been wanting to do that brother just letting you know that God uses anyone to come speak to us amen if you believe on the Lord the very need that's on your heart that same sword is here to cut through any hole that the devil has amen amen there's no one like my God that's right amen amen he can free anybody he can heal anybody amen amen amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank
