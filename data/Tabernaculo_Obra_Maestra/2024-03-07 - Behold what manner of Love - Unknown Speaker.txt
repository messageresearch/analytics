[Music] amen in be you Hu [Music] you we you we we you we the [Music] [Music] be is [Music] God bless you all to tonight it's good to be back amongst uh Saints of light precious faith and um certainly appreciate the song specials this evening that were sung our brother Jonathan or brother Ken sometimes it takes a mountain he saying and um I've I've certainly am a witness of that um in my stubbornness it's taken more than one mountain in my life and uh it's also taken more than one Valley in my life for me to surrender as I should and maybe for some of you it just took one mountain or maybe it just took one Valley but I went from a mountain to a valley to a mountain to a valley and all I can say now is Amazing Grace How Sound Saed a rich like me I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see we appreciate the song that brother Kenny sang but there was there was something that he said just before he sang I I think referring to the song that brother Jonathan had sang he said he said there there's a message in that song he says of the love of God and tonight unknowing to brother Ken unknowing to brother Jonathan we have a message tonight that we've entitled behold what manner of love so I I think it's it was appropriate I think it was they were LED of God to sing the songs they sang and share that with us because I think it was right in line and I feel that God was just speaking on every side and speaking through the Brethren with their songs and preparing our hearts so as we turn in our Bibles tonight to first John in chapter 3 and we'll be begin reading at verse one and again the title tonight behold what manner of love First John 3 and verse one behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is verse three and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure verse vers 9 of First John 3 whosoever is born of God does not commit sin whosoever is born of God does not commit sin because it's the Born Again experience that annuls the curse in our life that we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and came into this world speaking for his seed remain in him and he cannot sin why because he is now a born again believer in Christ the Bible says John said because he is born of God let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for the love with which you loved us and that same love that calls us to surrender all we thank you now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated God's love was from Genesis to Revelations God's love love was was from Adam it'll go all the way to 144,000 who will give their life in a Great Tribulation God's love was from the beginning of time all the way to this seventh Millennium in which we live 7,000 years of man's existence and the measure and the true test of God's love it's not just the promises he's made that he's chosen us before the foundation of the world that he said he that we would be holy and Without Blame in his presence because of the blood he shed for us in Cal it's not just because he said that we would be Sons and Daughters adopted by Jesus Christ Bible says if you love the world and the and the things of the world the love of God is not in you but but even so you may feel his love around you you may feel it from your parents you may feel it from your brothers and sisters you may feel his love all around you you may even feel that love of God pulling at your heart from time to time but you can't change yourself you must be born again the true measure of his love if we were to of all the things that we could say is a measure of his love I chose this one tonight his long sufferings second Peter chapter 3 and verse 9 and it reads like this the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering towards us not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance until a man a woman a child any person com comes to True repentance and not under the law for repentance under the law is just realizing I've been caught there there's a penalty to pay if I tell them I'm I'm repented maybe my pay the maybe the price I have to pay will be less that's repentance under the law but under Grace but until you repented under grace then God can't begin to reward you or restoring your life all that the Palmer worm had eaten all that the Locust has eaten all that the canker worm has eaten all that the caterpillar has eaten that Joel spoke of Prophecy chapter 1 verse 4 but from the day you're born you and I both this worm is in US waiting to devour but the ministry of the Lamb of God and the book that he opened and and and it Reve and and the revealed word that was brought to us brings us rewards Matthew said in Matthew 5 and verse 12 he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted the prophets which were before you so no repentance no Supernatural reward of God but repentance through love when you repent because you love Christ your lord and savior then what's the reward in St John 3 verse 3 Jesus tells us the great reward in s John 3 and 3 Jesus speaking to a Pharisee a teacher of the law he Nicodemus he said Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God except a person be born again they cannot see why Holiness should be part of their lifestyle they cannot see why honesty but we should be honest in all things unless we be born again we cannot see why we should be faithful to our spouses unless we be born again we cannot see what the importance is is of meditating on his word day and night unless we unless unless we can be born again we we won't be able to see or be convinced why being modestly dressed is the way we should [Music] live unless we be born again we cannot see why we should be the people Peacemaker instead of the warmonger it's the Born Again experience it's to bring you into his presence it's the first step to walk into his presence coming to church and walking through that door it's a good step but it's not the step that's really needed the step that's really needed and the first one is a born experience it brings you into his presence and it makes you perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect Paul spoke of it this Born Again experience unto Perfection and added details to what Jesus had already said there in Ephesians chapter 1 is Paul expressing details of the Born Again experience Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 17 Paul says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him in other words Paul is saying if you've been born again you'll see this kingdom of God he'll give you a spirit of wisdom when you're born again he you a spirit of Revelation he'll even give you the revelation of Jesus Christ when you've been born again but outside of the born again again experience it will not come Verse 18 speaking on the Born Again experience and he said this Born Again experience this is what it will bring in your life also that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of inheritance in the Saints John said it this way John the Baptist he said I baptize you with water unto un unto salvation the Forgiveness of your sins but there cometh one after me that will give you a born again experience and he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire a supernatural fire that will be a cleansing From the Inside Out in Ephesians 4 and verse 30 Paul said this concerning the Born Again experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says and grieve not this experience of being born again grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption when you've been born again when the fire has cleansed your heart and mind verse 31 then he says when you've had this Born Again experience he said let then remember all the bitterness you felt remember all the Wrath that you've had remember the anger that you've been trying to get rid of remember the evil speaking that you that that you wish you wouldn't use anymore Paul says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice he says now that you've been born again you can choose to exchange bitterness for kindness you can exchange wrath and anger for being tenderhearted you can exchange the clamor and even speak evil speaking and ask God to give to give you forgiveness one for another Ephesians 4 32 Paul says concerning the Born Again experience and the details of what it does in our lives and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake have forgiven you through the blood of Christ what he did on Calvary he placed our sins in the sea of his forgetfulness he not only forgave us he forgets but he doesn't forget that we need to be changed and the blood of Jesus places a barrier where the holy God doesn't look down upon us and see our condition but the blood gives us a space to repent and be changed that's where we're at today in a space of time that he has given us so that we can be changed from all the wickedness of this World Paul was adding details to the Born Again experience he was telling you what the baptism of the Holy Spirit and what it will take away from you and what it will give you to replace that evil conduct to to replace when he's when he's put out the demon power in our life then the holy Spirit comes in if we give him full control here in second Peter chapter one Peter is speaking also on the Born Again experience and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he is adding more detail as the Holy Spirit anoints and inspires him it's the divine power of tutorship through total obedience and Peter was saying now that you've been born again now add to your faith he said add to your faith virtue add to your faith knowledge add to your faith self-control add to your faith patience add to your patience godliness add to your godliness brotherly kindness Peter here speaking this is the Born Again experience these are the steps that that Peter was anointed to outline for us but it's the same thing that Jesus said he's just spoke it in in a very simple form there in there in Matthew chapter 5 it was Jesus teaching on Perfection Perfection is the end result but to begin to be able to get to Perfection the first step is to be born again that's the beginning and Jesus spoke on Perfection he was really speaking on the Born Again experience and the steps that we should take to get get into his presence Jesus said blessed are they that mourn Peter said add to your faith virtue they were speaking on the very same thing he said Jesus said blessed are they that mourn that's not a weakness when you've been born again that's a strength to be able to weep before God and say Lord I need you to have victory in my life Jesus said blessed are the meek because it takes strength to be meek when you really want to display anger it takes great strength oh I've fallen short many of times inde because it felt like it was easier to get angry it felt like showing anger would would would put the situation in my control the reality is and the Holy Spirit revealed it that had I displayed meekness he would have come into took control of that situation my anger made it further out of control blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness is what Jesus said Peter said add to your faith self-control Jesus said blessed are the merciful Peter said add to your faith patience they were saying the same thing God through His prophets God through his Apostles had them say the same thing in so many different ways not even a fool would a so that if your personality can't clash with [Music] Paul or maybe Peter's personality fits you better and if you felt you couldn't trust Peter or Paul you could go direct to Jesus but it's still the Holy Spirit work through all these Messengers it's the same message it's the Plan of Redemption coming from the Lamb's Book of Life to bring Salvation and change to our lives Jesus said blessed are the pure in heart Peter said add to your faith godliness both were speaking of the Born Again experience and the steps that takes us to be like Jesus in these bodies of flesh on this Earth so that we can receive our last change through rapture in faith the change of these bodies Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers Peter said add to your faith brotherly kindness this this work of God in our lives it's begun in love the love of God it will end with the love of God in our hearts the songwriter once wrote oh love of God so rich and pure so measureless and strong it shall forever more endure the Saints and Angels song God wanted Israel to love him serve him even under the law heed but Israel had a fourfold fourfold cycle that they lived under Mankind and the human race is in that same cycle yet today the church in the wilderness or the church through seven Church ages is in that same cycle all the people that are that are called the message people are in the same cycle today because what makes up the members of the Catholic Church makes up the members of everyone in this message we're all human beings born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies we were needing a savior we were needing a redeemer Jesus Christ the Lamb of God in the Book of Joshua chapter 23 beginning at verse one and it reads like this and it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies roundabout that Joshua Joshua waxed old and stricken in age and Joshua called for all Israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them I am old and stricken in age and you've seen all that the Lord your God ha done unto all these nations because of you for the Lord your God is he that ha fought for you now what Joshua is doing he's getting ready to tell Israel how to keep the victory that they've had under his ministry which really was the ministry of Jehovah God a vessel of clay called Joshua the son of nun in verse six he says be ye therefore very courageous to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses that she turn not aside there from to the right hand or to to the left that you come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them in other words Joshua is saying if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God won't be inside of you it won't be a part of you you won't have a Victorious Life in verse eight he says but cleave unto the Lord your God as you have done unto This Day verse 11 take good heed therefore unto yourselves that you love the Lord your God that statement there that's how you keep the victory if that's how the victory was kept under the law that's how the victory will be kept in the grace of God it's an unchanging declaration for the believer the believer 4,000 years ago or the believer in 2024 take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the Lord your God and that's how we keep the victory don't let your love for god grow cold that's how you keep the victory don't let your love for your wife grow cold that's how you keep the victory don't let your love for your husband grow cold that's how you keep the victory don't let your love for your children grow cold that's how you keep the victory don't let the love for your parents grow cold that's how you keep the victory don't let your love for the household of faith grow cold let's reach out to one another always Matthew 24 verse 11 he says and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and people get a hold of that and they say he Jesus said that the law and the prophets were until John so that means there's no more prophets then they go to Matthew 24 they say Jesus also said that many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many so then they say you see there's either going to be no prophets or the ones that come will all be false it's in the Bible they say but in between those two verses in Matthew 23 and verse 34 Jesus said to the Pharisees this was long after John had been had had been killed this is long after John had been beheaded Jesus told them Jesus said I will send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and you'll continue to persecute them but nonetheless the prophetic ministry will continue because it's been since Eden the proph prophetic Ministry was through the law the prophetic Ministry it crossed over into the New Testament with John a prophet of the New Testament and if you go to the Book of Revelations practically every chapter speaks of re of prophets Apostles Messengers that God would send all the way to the end as a matter of fact long after the bride of Christ is gone and God comes down to deal with the Jews what's the first thing he does he sends two witnesses prophets all the way to the end God never changed his mind about his word but unless you're born again you won't see it you'll put a period on the word of God instead of a comma where he also said Matthew 24 and2 it says this it was Jesus speaking on the Seven Seals he says and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold remember Joshua 20 23 11th verse that we just read where Joshua finishes telling them to Israel take heed to yourselves that you love the Lord your God because that how you're going to keep the victory in your lives Joshua 24:14 Joshua speaking to Israel he said now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth uh Joshua 24 and verse 14 and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and serve ye the Lord if there was one thing I could finish with tonight to everyone I would say serve him with all your heart your soul all your [Music] mind Joshua 245 and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose e day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were under on the other side of the flood for the gods of the amorites in whom land you dwell but Joshua then says but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord because that's the way me in my house we keep the victory Joshua 24 and verse 16 and the people and an answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods for the Lord Our God he it is that brought us up that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved Us in all the way wherever we went and among all the people through whom we passed they said you think we'll stop serving him you you think we're going to stop being obedient to his word after all he's done for us they tell Joshua no way not us no Verse 18 and the Lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land Israel speaking here therefore we will also serve the Lord for he is our God now the Book of Joshua is called a book of Victory the Book of Joshua was Victory through love the Book of Joshua was Victory through faith the Book of Joshua was Victory through obedience but what follows the Book of Joshua is the Book of Judges and it records 12 men and one woman designated of God to deliver Israel and deliver Israel they did through a fourfold fourfold cycle that repeated over and over and over again in a in a 3 to 400 year period they lived there that's that's what when you look at the book of The Book of Judges it was a period of three or 400 years there and it was a period in Israel where they never had the victory again over their enemies it was a cycle of rebellion retribution repentance restoration and then they started all over again Rebellion retribution repentance restoration under the law the cycle of mankind a cycle of a people lost in sin who just couldn't get the victory over it judges This Book of Judges is a book of defeat and not of Victories why go with me to judges CH 1 and verse 21 judges 1 and verse 21 it says and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day what would make the difference in a person's life that if a book was written about me would it have more defeats than victories or would my book show more victories than defeats judges 1 and verse 27 we see what Benjamin did after he entered the land he didn't put out the inhabitants as as the law had called for and Joshua had called for him to do but that was just one tribe verse 27 neither did Manasses drive out the inhabitants of Bin and her towns nor tanak and her towns nor the inhabitants of door and her towns the inhabitants of IIM and her towns nor the inhabitants of Migo and her towns but the Canaanites would dwell in that land verse 28 and it came to pass when Israel was strong physically natur but not spiritually that they put the Canaanites what out of the land you know why they didn't put the Canaanites out of the land because they weren't that strong to stay with the word the word it takes a great strength it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to Tribute and did and did not utterly drive them out somebody said wait a minute you know there's a lot of stuff that we don't like doing we don't like digging ditches we don't really like being a roofer we don't like all the manual labor why put the Canaanites out when we can make them our ditch diggers we can turn them into our roofers we can make them the Carpenters we can have them washing our chariots and we can pay them almost nothing matter of fact we will pay them nothing that will be the just just the fact to live here and stay here will be their payment why it's a money-making deal for us so why put them out because God said so that was the why verse 29 but Benjamin saw what Manasses did or Manassa saw what Benjamin did Manasses saw what Benjamin had done he was influenced now what about Ephraim verse 29 neither did Ephraim dri out the Canaanites that dwelt in gizer but the Canaanites dwelt in gizer among them you see how they started falling one by one well if that family does it that way why can't I that Dad let's let let's his daughters cut their hair they paint their faces why why can't we then they still come to church verse 30 neither did Zebulon drive out the inhabitants of KRON nor the inhabitants of Nal but the Canaanites dwell among them and became tributaries you know what tributaries means it means if you're going to stay here in the land you got to pay us money we want money for you to stay but God said don't cut a deal with the don't cut a deal with the devil put him out of your house put him out of your cars put them out of your life no deal no deal I'm applying the token in my so that my children can be born again and have a victory in Christ in this life and in the one to come verse 31 neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of AO nor the inhabitants of zidon nor of alab nor of as nor of Elba nor of aik nor of rehab there's all these tribes now they're all following what the first one did Benjamin well if Benjamin could do it and he's still part of the church why not me too why do I have to live a strict life you don't have to and if you've been born again it's not a strict life it's a life of victory in Christ verse 31 neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants in verse 32 it says but the asites dwell among the Canaanites then Habit to the land for they did not drive them out and what was the message to Israel God gave us a land we're going into the land and we're putting everybody out and the land will be a holy land and our lives will be a holy life and they entered into the land it was a rich land flowing with milk and honey but for but you know what they thought as a billionaire once said when he was asked in an interview oh way back in the late 60s they asked them they asked him if you spent millions of dollars a month at the age you are now you'd never spend all the money you have so how much is enough and the billionaire just smiled and he said just a little bit more that's all I want that was Israel that was human nature that was Fallen man no matter what the word of God told them that would give them a victory with great reward verse 33 here's the last tribe 11 out of 12 already living in Disobedience it says neither did naali drive out the inhabitants of B nor the inhabitants of bethan but he dwelt among the Canaanites and inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of bames and of bethan became tributaries unto them we know God told us through the mouth of Moses and Joshua put them out of the land do not dwell together with them how can two walk together L they be agreed they didn't they said they would but they didn't they were in total Disobedience to thus sayith the Lord what have we received in this age we're living thus sayith the Lord oh may God not find us in Disobedience even as Israel was watch now in Judges chapter 2 and verse one and an angel of the Lord came up from gilgal to bosim and said I made you to go up out of Egypt and have brought you unto the land which I swear unto your fathers and I said I will never break my Covenant with you for then this Angel which when you read the word angel in the Bible simply means a messenger he says verse two and you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you'll make no league with them you won't make a deal where we where you'll say you'll be tributaries to us he said ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why have you done this a messenger said a messenger in our day came and spoke to the denominations of this Modern Age asked them to throw down their denominational altars he told them you haven't obeyed the voice of God from the Catholic to the Pentecostal to a socalled message movement and he why have you done this listen to the tapes she'll hear him crying out out because you won't drive them out then I won't override your will and drive them out either God said if you won't do your part repent and be baptized how can I do my part and and give you the victory Judges chapter 2 and verse three wherefore I also said I will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your side and their gods shall be a snare unto you but in the midst of this time of the judges in Israel when the church was continually cycling in a in a cycle of rebellion retribution repentance restoration under the law in a time when they couldn't keep a victory from one day to the next in this same time period while the judges were struggling when where they had turned their back on thus sayith the Lord and they were paying a price for it because all the nations that have paid tributary to them had now risen up fighting them killing them destroying their homes but in the midst of this time of judges in a time of great defeat for Israel there was a little elect lady whom the spirit of the Lord was moving upon not the church the bride her name was Ruth she was a moabit she wasn't coming under the law it was her love for Naomi that was was bringing her to to her Boaz she didn't know it but her love from Naomi made her to forsake her own Pagan religion and she tells Naomi where you go I'll go your God will be my God so I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you this little bride Ruth was a MOAB moabit and she wasn't coming in under the law it was her love for Naomi Ruth lived during the time of these judges so while Israel was falling to pieces a little Gentile bride was being lifted up and through the troubles and trials the woes and
