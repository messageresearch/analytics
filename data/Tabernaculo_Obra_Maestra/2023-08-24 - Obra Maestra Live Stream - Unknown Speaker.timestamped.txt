[46:04] to see is more than willing

[46:14] I'll carry that heavy load
[46:17] you don't have you don't have to bear it
[46:20] no more
[46:21] unless you choose
[46:24] because to serve the Lord Jesus
[46:27] is to choose for him to lighten our
[46:30] loads
[46:32] we reach you all this this morning this
[46:36] evening
[46:37] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:39] and uh want to make welcome all our our
[46:43] visitors
[46:46] good to see Reuben here once again
[46:48] tonight
[46:52] we have two visitors
[47:00] and uh
[47:02] we pray something will be said that'll
[47:04] touch and bless everyone's heart
[47:09] we've been preaching on a series
[47:13] we entitled it the white horse rider
[47:27] so we're not repeating ourselves
[47:30] but it's Bible prophecy
[47:33] and it speaks of the first coming of
[47:36] Christ
[47:37] and it speaks of the second coming
[47:40] and of course the Bible readers know
[47:45] that these these this white horse rider
[47:49] Blanco is part of the Prophecies of the
[47:52] Book of Revelations
[47:54] and when it speaks of these writers
[47:58] included in the writers is is the
[48:01] Prophecies of Seven Seals
[48:04] in Revelation six
[48:07] and of course the book is a book of
[48:09] visions
[48:11] and
[48:13] chapter 6 speaks of the first six seals
[48:36] that John had saw the disciples the
[48:39] apostles
[48:41] it and he some of the things that he saw
[48:44] were future events
[48:47] some of the things he saw in the visions
[48:51] that he spoke of were things passed
[48:54] things that had already come to pass
[48:57] even before he was ever born
[49:00] and things that he was speaking of in
[49:03] the Book of Revelations
[49:05] those were things that were present
[49:08] there were happening as he was speaking
[49:11] them
[49:12] and though John was a apostle
[49:17] he didn't understand the Visions he was
[49:20] seen
[49:22] they would be revealed later
[49:25] many and most of them
[49:28] were going to be revealed in our days
[49:32] it's from this inspiration
[49:34] that we that we speak on these subjects
[49:38] but as as we're speaking on it thank you
[49:43] the Bible it all ties together
[49:48] from the Old Testament
[49:51] and I want to take and begin reading
[49:54] here this evening in Psalms 37.
[50:09] Psalms 37
[50:15] and we'll be begin in verse one
[50:19] this is a Psalm of David
[50:22] the king he wrote many of the Psalms
[50:26] but he didn't write all of this
[50:29] many were written by by other writers
[50:33] but this one is a Psalm of David
[50:36] it says fret not thyself because of evil
[50:39] doers
[50:40] neither be thou envious against the
[50:43] workers of iniquity
[50:49] shall soon be cut down like the grass
[50:51] and wither is the green herbs
[50:57] then the Lord and do good
[51:00] so shall thou dwell in the land and
[51:03] verily Thou shalt be fed yeah
[51:09] it's a promise that God was going to
[51:11] watch over you and take care of you is
[51:14] [Music]
[51:16] a delight thyself also in the Lord and
[51:20] He Shall give Thee the desires of thine
[51:22] heart
[51:26] commit thy way unto the Lord trust also
[51:30] in him and he shall bring it to pass
[51:34] it's a positive message
[51:37] even in the Old Testament
[51:40] and as we as we speak on it more tonight
[51:44] you don't see why this was such a
[51:46] positive song
[51:49] and verse 6 and he shall bring forth thy
[51:52] righteousness as the light and thy
[51:55] judgment as the Noonday
[52:09] and the Holy Spirit through David says
[52:12] and he the almighty God shall bring
[52:15] forth thy righteousness as the light is
[52:22] sunlight because
[52:25] you're gonna have to believe me but they
[52:27] didn't have LEDs
[52:32] they didn't have electric lights when
[52:35] David was speaking of Life
[52:39] of how it rises how it starts just
[52:42] barely breaking out in the morning
[52:45] and it gets greater and greater and
[52:48] greater
[52:50] and upon that inspiration he said and he
[52:53] God shall bring forth thy righteousness
[53:00] in other words he'll bring he'll cause
[53:03] you to do the right thing
[53:09] until until your light your
[53:11] righteousness is shining so bright
[53:15] people say how can you live that life is
[53:25] and I didn't even realize how bright my
[53:27] light was shining us
[53:30] but everyone else
[53:35] sorry shall bring forth thy
[53:37] righteousness as the light and thy
[53:39] judgment as the Noonday
[53:42] then he says rest in the Lord
[53:45] and wait patiently for him
[53:47] fret not thyself because of him to
[53:50] prospereth in his way because of the man
[53:53] who bringeth Wicked devices to pass
[54:04] cease from anger
[54:07] forsake Wrath
[54:10] fret not thyself in any wise to do evil
[54:17] for evil evil doers shall be cut off
[54:21] but those that wait upon the Lord
[54:24] they shall inherit the earth
[54:29] Heavenly Father we ask your blessing
[54:33] upon thy words
[54:35] Lord we know there's something for
[54:37] everyone
[54:39] and it may not be the same expression or
[54:42] the same word
[54:44] the great Holy Spirit
[54:47] you know how to speak speak a little
[54:50] here and a little there
[54:53] that everyone can be touched
[54:55] and go out in Courage tonight
[54:59] that they've been in your presence that
[55:02] you led them here tonight
[55:05] we thank you now in Jesus name amen
[55:13] verse 10 says for yet a little while and
[55:17] the wicked shall not be yea Thou shalt
[55:20] diligently consider his place and it
[55:22] shall not be
[55:25] nice
[55:29] but the meek shall inherit the earth and
[55:32] shall Delight themselves in the
[55:34] abundance of peace
[55:38] pass
[55:39] the wicked planteth against the just
[55:42] just and Nash upon him with his teeth
[55:49] the Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth
[55:52] that his day is coming
[55:56] the wicked have drawn out the sword
[55:59] and have been their bow because the
[56:02] wicked are the ones that are ready to do
[56:04] violence
[56:07] but not the born-again believer
[56:15] the wicked have drawn out the sword so
[56:19] Espada and have been their bow
[56:24] to cast down the poor and needy to slay
[56:29] such as be of upright conversations
[56:46] verse 15 their sword shall enter into
[56:49] their own heart and their bows shall be
[56:51] broken
[56:55] a little that a righteous man hath is
[56:58] better than the riches of many Wicked
[57:02] oh God's reminding us of many things
[57:05] here
[57:07] in our daily walk for the arms of the
[57:11] wicked shall be broken but the Lord
[57:13] upholdeth the righteousness
[57:18] the Lord knoweth the days of the upright
[57:21] and their inherit irritants shall be
[57:23] forever
[57:27] there was a Psalm of inheritance
[57:31] it was a Psalm of how he would bless the
[57:34] righteous
[57:35] and how he would bring righteousness to
[57:38] you
[57:39] in verse 19 they shall not be ashamed in
[57:43] the evil time and in the days of famine
[57:45] they shall be satisfied
[57:50] but the wicked Shall Perish and the
[57:53] enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat
[57:55] of lambs they shall consume into smoke
[57:57] shall they consume away
[58:06] the wicked borroweth
[58:09] verse 21. how is that different from a
[58:13] righteous one borrowing
[58:17] it says the wicked borrowers and payeth
[58:21] not again
[58:23] but the righteous showeth mercy and
[58:26] giveth
[58:28] give us even more than he borrowed at
[58:31] times
[58:33] verse 22 for such as be blessed of him
[58:36] shall inherit the earth and they that be
[58:39] cursed of him shall be cut off
[58:44] the steps of a good man
[58:47] are ordered by the Lord
[58:51] and he delighted in his way
[58:55] it's these steps that we want to speak
[58:58] of tonight
[59:00] these steps were all made possible to us
[59:04] by a book that was opened
[59:06] the Bible a book that was open
[59:10] the Lamb's Book of Life
[59:15] turn with me to Revelations chapter six
[59:25] and verse 1.
[59:28] the visions of John
[59:30] here in Revelation six
[59:33] it was the time of the opening of these
[59:37] Seven Seals
[59:39] you say what is Seven Seals brother
[59:41] Daniels
[59:43] Seven Seals in this new testament
[59:47] there's a new covenant
[59:49] made possible by the blood of Jesus
[59:52] Christ is
[59:53] seven parts
[59:55] of one divine plan
[1:00:19] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:00:22] the seals
[1:00:24] and I heard as it was the noise of
[1:00:26] thunder
[1:00:27] one of the four be sane come and see
[1:01:20] a great Plan of Redemption of
[1:01:24] restoration how we can be born again how
[1:01:28] we can be changed from these natural men
[1:01:31] and women that we are somos
[1:01:35] in Revelations chapter five
[1:01:38] and verse 5.
[1:01:41] John again seen all these visions
[1:01:46] and in this Vision
[1:01:49] in chapter five
[1:01:51] John sees one that's sitting on a throne
[1:01:56] so it must be a king
[1:01:58] and it is a king yes but it's the King
[1:02:02] of Kings it's the father
[1:02:06] and he's holding a book in his hands
[1:02:09] and this book that he has
[1:02:12] sealed with Seven Seals the back side of
[1:02:16] the book
[1:02:17] and the reason it's hit it's on the back
[1:02:19] side of the book
[1:02:21] because in the days of John
[1:02:24] they didn't have a book like this
[1:02:28] no no no
[1:02:30] they had Scrolls
[1:02:32] and the Scrolls would roll up
[1:02:37] that was their book and the way they
[1:02:40] would close the books
[1:02:42] they maybe wrap a piece of leather on it
[1:02:47] they might even take and pour wax over
[1:02:50] the top of that
[1:02:52] and if it was a king he'd push his ring
[1:02:55] into the rat wax
[1:02:58] that means that this Scrolls
[1:03:04] and there would be a time and a certain
[1:03:07] person
[1:03:14] alone
[1:03:16] would be given the the Revelation
[1:03:19] and the ability to lose the seals
[1:04:01] and the next thing that happens is
[1:04:03] there's a strong angel proclaiming with
[1:04:05] a loud voice
[1:04:09] this book must be open yesterday
[1:04:14] this is the book of Salvation
[1:04:17] on the prophets were until John
[1:04:21] divine grace
[1:04:23] and God wanted to extend his grace
[1:04:30] extend the born-again experience
[1:04:34] to be able to overcome
[1:04:37] every strong Temptation
[1:04:40] and a strong angel said
[1:04:44] and to take the seal off
[1:04:48] because there's a message on the inside
[1:04:53] and the by and the Bible tells us
[1:04:55] no man on Earth
[1:05:06] and read the message that was given
[1:05:09] the Bible says that John went much
[1:05:13] when he found that no man was worthy to
[1:05:16] open foreign
[1:05:39] foreign
[1:06:03] who was it beginning he said behold he
[1:06:06] said in verse 5. The Lion of the tribe
[1:06:09] of Judah
[1:06:11] that's Jesus Christ in his Earthly
[1:06:14] Ministry the root of David that's Jesus
[1:06:18] Christ
[1:06:24] [Music]
[1:06:26] so then what was the ministry of Jesus
[1:06:29] Christ
[1:06:31] they come to to the human race with an
[1:06:35] open book in his head a book that was in
[1:06:38] the hands of the Kingdom
[1:06:41] descended from the throne
[1:06:43] that he gave to his son the Lord Jesus
[1:06:48] that was a book of Salvation that's the
[1:06:52] book you hold in your hands tonight
[1:06:55] a book that teaches you how to live um
[1:07:03] Israel
[1:07:28] no more under the laws he was extending
[1:07:32] to them Grace
[1:07:35] salvation how to be changed and have
[1:07:40] overcoming pounds
[1:07:44] we read out of the book of Psalms
[1:07:47] 37.
[1:07:49] is really the inspiration
[1:07:52] from which the Lord Jesus himself
[1:07:59] perfect
[1:08:06] so we want to share that tonight
[1:08:11] because the book is open to us
[1:08:17] what part what was the seal part
[1:08:20] the sealed part
[1:08:23] watch how God writes his Bible
[1:08:26] is the part that's discarded
[1:08:32] it's not the keeping parts
[1:08:36] it's the part that's discarded
[1:08:39] the part you want
[1:08:41] once the seal is loose
[1:08:44] is you want a book you want to scroll
[1:08:48] you want you want the ability to be able
[1:08:50] to open it
[1:08:52] you want the ability to be able to read
[1:08:55] it
[1:08:56] and not just be readers of the world but
[1:09:00] for God to give you a revelation
[1:09:02] you can be a doer of the word
[1:09:05] that they can live a life worthy of the
[1:09:08] Gospel
[1:09:12] we'd like to entitle this portion
[1:09:18] of the white horse riders
[1:09:22] yes and the pale horse riders
[1:09:27] and for a subject Perfection perfection
[1:09:32] and the minute you talk to people about
[1:09:34] Perfections
[1:09:38] he said no we'll never be perfect
[1:09:46] not only did he say we could
[1:09:48] he gave us reasons why we should because
[1:10:02] the adoption is the process
[1:10:05] spiritual adoption
[1:10:08] not not
[1:10:10] carnal adoption
[1:10:14] me and my wife were to adopt the child
[1:10:17] right now
[1:10:19] it'd be a little late in life for us for
[1:10:22] sure
[1:10:24] but we would be taking a child
[1:10:30] that wasn't a product of our Union
[1:10:40] the child of some other people
[1:10:43] and we bring him in to be part of our
[1:10:47] family
[1:10:49] that's adoption on the Earth
[1:11:00] are those who were in his mind before
[1:11:03] the foundation of the world
[1:11:06] as he told the Prophet Jeremiah
[1:11:10] process
[1:11:48] Cinco
[1:12:04] and we've spoken on it many times before
[1:12:09] but I can only follow as the Lord leads
[1:12:14] and sometimes he changes the thought
[1:12:17] yeah
[1:12:18] as I walk in the front room
[1:12:21] so Matthew chapter five
[1:12:25] Jesus speaking here
[1:12:27] Jesus if we can't believe Jesus
[1:12:31] who can we believe
[1:12:34] Matthew 5 48.
[1:12:36] Jesus says Jesus therefore perfect said
[1:12:41] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:12:46] which father the one in Revelations
[1:12:57] that father that father who had a
[1:13:00] message
[1:13:05] that father who it says in verse 5 of
[1:13:08] that same chapter
[1:13:11] that he became flesh and he loosed the
[1:13:16] seals
[1:13:17] open the Scrolls it was the New
[1:13:20] Testament because
[1:13:23] it was the grace of God
[1:13:26] and now Jesus is
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:41] and the first thing people think
[1:13:44] just one problem brother Daniel
[1:13:48] we can't be perfect
[1:13:56] but what did Jesus say
[1:13:58] he said be ye therefore
[1:14:03] even as your father
[1:14:05] which is in heaven
[1:14:08] is perfect
[1:14:13] where he said biggie therefore
[1:14:16] you know why he started the sentence
[1:14:19] that way
[1:14:22] and finished
[1:14:25] to be perfect as the father which is in
[1:14:28] heaven is perfect
[1:14:30] think about this it's because of the
[1:14:34] other 47 verses
[1:14:38] prior to this one verse
[1:14:40] because that's how God writes his Bible
[1:14:44] when you come to a place in the
[1:14:46] scriptures
[1:14:47] and you read one verse and you say no
[1:14:50] that can't be you said he said
[1:14:53] it may be that you that you didn't
[1:14:55] understand the first 47 verses
[1:15:00] so how will you understand
[1:15:02] this statement this conclusion
[1:15:06] verse 48
[1:15:09] conclusions
[1:15:13] you started in the first verse
[1:15:16] 47 verses
[1:15:20] that God wants you to understand
[1:15:22] so when you get to 48.
[1:15:26] you can say Lord if you want me to enter
[1:15:31] into Perfection
[1:15:33] now I understand the steps
[1:15:36] now I understand
[1:15:57] and verse 39.
[1:16:01] Hebrews 11 is called the chapter of
[1:16:05] Faith The Heroes of Faith
[1:16:08] is
[1:16:12] a fail and in verse 39 the closing
[1:16:17] statements on this chapter the
[1:16:18] Declaration the Apostle Paul speaking
[1:16:22] he says in all these
[1:16:25] having obtained a good report through
[1:16:27] faith
[1:16:32] received not the promises
[1:16:38] like the Father in Heaven is perfect
[1:16:41] God having provided some better things
[1:16:44] for us
[1:16:54] because we're made
[1:16:56] perfectos as a body of Christ as a
[1:17:00] many-membered body
[1:17:02] is the Perfection is
[1:17:10] Hebrews chapter 6.
[1:17:15] Apostle Paul says
[1:17:17] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:17:19] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[1:17:22] Perfection
[1:17:27] not laying again the foundation of
[1:17:30] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[1:17:33] toward God
[1:17:39] it's a theme in the Bible
[1:17:43] that stretches forth
[1:17:45] throughout all the New Testaments
[1:17:49] the word
[1:17:50] Perfecto it means to make something
[1:17:54] complete is that means to bring
[1:17:57] something to an end
[1:17:59] it means to bring uh to an end like a
[1:18:02] goal that you might have
[1:18:05] a means to bring to a close or
[1:18:08] fulfillment is
[1:18:13] like the Prophecies of the
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:26] tribulation Romans 5 3 says tribulation
[1:18:29] worketh patience
[1:18:33] how highly God regards this outworking
[1:18:36] of our patients
[1:18:41] it's seen in James
[1:18:46] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:18:51] that you may be perfect an entire
[1:18:54] lacking nothing
[1:18:58] so then we realize in this new testament
[1:19:00] Covenant
[1:19:03] for us
[1:19:23] and how highly God has commended the
[1:19:26] Saints
[1:19:31] they were patient as Lambs
[1:19:37] lovingly Faithfully they serve God
[1:19:42] somebody wanted out of life
[1:19:45] just to serve their lord
[1:19:47] and how great was the reward
[1:19:51] so Perfection has a process
[1:19:54] and the Lord Jesus was the first yes to
[1:19:58] bring us a teaching
[1:20:00] of all of all the parts of every step
[1:20:04] that takes us to Perfection as I told
[1:20:08] you the process is called adoption
[1:20:10] of sons and daughters
[1:20:13] the process to arrive to adoption
[1:20:17] in the Bible in this new testament it's
[1:20:21] called the three steps
[1:20:27] Jesus preached it begins with being
[1:20:31] justified by faith
[1:20:34] it goes to being Sanctified by the
[1:20:37] spirit
[1:20:38] and being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:20:41] and Fire
[1:20:43] this Holy Ghost and Fire baptism
[1:20:49] it's the beginning of a born-again
[1:20:52] experience
[1:20:54] after God has Sanctified your vessels
[1:20:59] he's poured out all the trash that that
[1:21:02] you built up in your life
[1:21:06] he's cleanse heart and mind
[1:21:11] Sanctified
[1:21:16] in Matthew chapter 3
[1:21:19] and verse 11 verse John was at the River
[1:21:23] Jordan baptized me is
[1:21:29] and as many came to his baptism
[1:21:33] he dropped a revelation
[1:21:37] of this of this beginning this
[1:21:40] Foundation of an of a new covenant
[1:21:47] he said I indeed baptize you with water
[1:21:50] unto repentance
[1:21:54] it was the first coming of Christ
[1:21:57] John was a prophet Jesus said he was
[1:22:00] more than a prophet for he was a
[1:22:03] forerunner he was the Elijah Ministry
[1:22:06] that was going to introduce the Lamb of
[1:22:09] God
[1:22:10] he said I indeed baptize you with water
[1:22:13] unto repentance but he that cometh after
[1:22:16] me is mightier than I am
[1:22:23] whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear he
[1:22:26] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:28] and with fire
[1:22:34] that was the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:22:38] it's the beginning of a born-again
[1:22:41] experience
[1:22:43] it's when you've repented of all your
[1:22:46] sins
[1:22:48] and you have a revelation of The Next
[1:22:52] Step that God wants you to take
[1:22:54] to be baptized in water it's a symbol
[1:22:59] under repentance that brings you to this
[1:23:02] baptism of fire that the holy spirit
[1:23:05] gives you
[1:23:08] John said I indeed baptize you with
[1:23:11] water
[1:23:13] but there cometh another one
[1:23:17] almighty God
[1:23:19] flesh in this Lord Jesus is
[1:23:51] it's different it's different from the
[1:23:54] gift of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:55] In the book of Acts in Libre chapter 2
[1:23:59] and verse 38. so then Peter said unto
[1:24:03] them repent and be baptized every one of
[1:24:07] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:24:10] remission of sins
[1:24:18] the book
[1:24:20] the scroll that had been loosed and
[1:24:22] unfolded
[1:24:24] day by day more detail was being added
[1:24:30] and here in Acts 2 38
[1:24:33] another detail had been added to the
[1:24:36] baptism
[1:24:39] now the baptism
[1:24:41] included a name to be baptized in the
[1:24:46] name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:55] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:24:58] baptized for one of you in the name of
[1:25:01] Jesus Christ
[1:25:03] for the remiss
[1:25:06] and he shall receive the gift of the
[1:25:09] Holy Spirit
[1:25:11] how is the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:14] how is it the same or how is it
[1:25:18] different
[1:25:19] it all works together
[1:25:23] turn with me to the book of Ephesians
[1:25:27] Ephesians chapter 2 .
[1:25:30] the Apostle Paul speaking here
[1:25:33] the book of Ephesians was written to the
[1:25:37] Ephesian Church
[1:25:39] they were a spiritual church
[1:25:43] they had they caught the Revelation in
[1:25:46] their days
[1:25:48] they were a mature Church
[1:25:50] a mature group of people
[1:25:53] [Music]
[1:25:54] they only started with 12 of them in the
[1:25:57] church
[1:25:58] now watch this
[1:26:03] and the Apostle Paul saying but God
[1:26:08] who is rich in Mercy for his great love
[1:26:12] wherewith he loved us
[1:26:14] even when we were dead in sins
[1:26:18] has quickened us together with Christ
[1:26:22] by grace
[1:26:26] and had raised us up together and made
[1:26:29] us sit together in Heavenly places
[1:26:52] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[1:26:58] and that not of yourselves
[1:27:01] it is
[1:27:03] the gift of God
[1:27:06] did you see it for by grace
[1:27:13] and that not of yourself
[1:27:16] the faith that you need for this journey
[1:27:20] is the gift of God
[1:27:24] and as you surrender to him daily
[1:27:27] and the trials and troubles you go
[1:27:30] through
[1:27:33] your faith increases
[1:27:37] day by day
[1:27:39] and Peter said next 2 38.
[1:27:44] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:27:47] Spirit
[1:27:50] faith faith the faith of God the
[1:27:53] failures
[1:27:54] what The Heroes of Faith had
[1:27:57] from Abraham
[1:28:00] to everyone here in this room
[1:28:04] they had Faith by faith they overcome
[1:28:09] and their faith increased
[1:28:12] and God gave him strength
[1:28:15] the baptism of fire it's the beginning
[1:28:19] of a born-again experience
[1:28:22] then through every trial and struggle
[1:28:24] you go through
[1:28:26] you receive a refilling of that Holy
[1:28:29] Spirit
[1:28:30] the refillings
[1:28:35] are to help you overcome
[1:28:38] every strong temptation
[1:28:41] justified by by justification by faith
[1:28:44] crucification
[1:28:46] sanctification by the spirit
[1:28:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fires
[1:28:53] and these three bring us to a restored
[1:28:56] friendships
[1:29:01] it's called adoption
[1:29:05] Paul told us in the book of Hebrews
[1:29:09] Hebrews
[1:29:12] 18. he says for there is
[1:29:16] veriling of the Commandment
[1:29:21] going before for the weakness and
[1:29:24] unprofitableness
[1:29:28] in other words The Ten Commandments
[1:29:31] there was a weak Link in them
[1:29:36] you know what it was
[1:29:40] the woman we are the weak Link
[1:29:44] in the Ten Commandments
[1:29:48] are they killing yet today
[1:29:50] thou shall not commit adultery are men
[1:29:54] and women being unfaithful in their
[1:29:56] relationships today
[1:30:00] are they stealing yet today
[1:30:03] so there's no strength in the
[1:30:05] Commandments
[1:30:08] because
[1:30:16] verse 19. for the law
[1:30:20] made nothing perfectly
[1:30:25] but the bringing in of a better hope did
[1:30:31] did you see it
[1:30:33] the law made nothing perfect
[1:30:37] but the bringing in of a better hope did
[1:30:42] what was that better hope is
[1:30:56] a new message
[1:30:59] of
[1:31:02] a life-changing experience
[1:31:09] for the law made nothing perfect but the
[1:31:11] bringing in of a better hope did by the
[1:31:14] which we draw near unto God
[1:31:22] through the old Covenant of the Old
[1:31:24] Testament
[1:31:39] by the sacrifice of the Lamb of God
[1:31:42] foreign
[1:31:44] and through the love of God yes
[1:31:47] he draws us closer to himself
[1:31:50] so yes Paul here in Hebrews 7. as you
[1:31:54] can see
[1:31:55] was speaking of all Ten Commandments
[1:31:59] and Jesus in his Parable Jesus for he
[1:32:02] spoke everything in prayer
[1:32:06] Jesus in his Parable on adoption
[1:32:10] and Perfection imperfections also
[1:32:13] mentions them and tells us how they're
[1:32:16] being disannowed
[1:32:20] so here is the admonition of God
[1:32:24] when he was opening the book
[1:32:27] that Adam lost in Genesis
[1:32:31] and telling us things that had been hid
[1:32:34] since the foundation of the world
[1:32:37] for the first time
[1:32:40] since the father spoke to Adam
[1:32:44] and the things that he was teaching him
[1:32:46] in Eden
[1:32:48] once again God is speaking to us
[1:32:53] through Adam's Fallen race
[1:32:56] we have in our possessions
[1:33:01] that Adam once had yeah and this is what
[1:33:05] Adam heard that day in Eden
[1:33:08] just before the fall
[1:33:31] because the Bible tells us that Jesus
[1:33:35] Christ is the same yesterday in Genesis
[1:33:39] today boy
[1:33:43] president
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:34:17] these are not just New Testament
[1:34:19] admonitions
[1:34:21] this was in the mind of God before the
[1:34:23] foundation
[1:34:26] justification by faith
[1:34:29] brings peace
[1:34:31] it's when you know it's when you get a
[1:34:35] revelation
[1:34:36] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and
[1:34:41] what he did on the cross
[1:34:43] he gave his life
[1:34:46] that he became your sins
[1:35:28] filthy movies
[1:35:36] if you can sit down and watch a vulgar
[1:35:39] movie
[1:35:40] with half-naked men and women
[1:35:44] I'm not even sure if you're justified by
[1:35:47] faith
[1:35:48] you sure haven't been Sanctified by the
[1:35:50] spirits
[1:35:57] it's Unholy yes
[1:36:00] it's vulgar yes it Grieves the Holy
[1:36:04] Spirit
[1:36:21] social media
[1:36:24] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:27] restores a friendship
[1:36:30] and the refillings of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:34] increase our love and faith
[1:36:37] unto Perfection
[1:36:39] the refillings of his spirits
[1:36:45] is not a reward
[1:36:48] for being a good
[1:36:50] Persona no no the refillings of the Holy
[1:36:53] Spirit
[1:36:57] to overcome temptation
[1:37:03] Matthew 5 6 and 7.
[1:37:06] is Jesus teaching on Perfection
[1:37:11] the process to take us there is
[1:37:14] again I say is adoption
[1:37:19] Holy Spirit adoption
[1:37:24] justification by faith
[1:37:27] sanctification by the spirit
[1:37:29] of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:37:33] restoring a friendship with the father
[1:37:36] like Adam had in Eden
[1:37:39] where the Bible says God would come down
[1:37:42] in the evening times
[1:37:47] and God would be a student
[1:37:50] and God would be his mentor and God was
[1:37:54] teaching him
[1:37:56] how to handle something the spoken word
[1:38:00] for the spoken word that was the
[1:38:03] original series
[1:38:05] brought forth every other scene
[1:38:07] you say what do you mean by that is
[1:38:44] what the spirit is saying
[1:38:55] Jesus
[1:39:08] as my Father which is in heaven is
[1:39:10] perfect
[1:39:11] the reason he said that in verse 48.
[1:39:15] because of the other 47 verses
[1:39:20] that we have read past for many years
[1:39:25] you see how the how the churches have
[1:39:28] taught us to read the words
[1:39:30] if you read past the 47 verses
[1:39:35] we don't understand them
[1:39:46] did you catch it look at that how we
[1:39:48] read the word we read 47 verses
[1:39:53] and the closing conclusions
[1:39:58] that Jesus was capping off his teaching
[1:40:00] with Jesus
[1:40:07] say we can't be perfect
[1:40:09] how can we be because of the first 47.
[1:40:14] that showed us
[1:40:17] so foreign
[1:40:22] perfection
[1:40:32] and seeing the multitudes we went up
[1:40:35] into a mountain and when it was said he
[1:40:38] said
[1:40:41] and he opened his mouth
[1:40:43] that means the spoken word
[1:40:47] he was about to do what he did in
[1:40:50] Genesis
[1:40:51] speak the word
[1:40:55] give the people the original seat
[1:41:00] it's a teaching
[1:41:03] the spoken word is a teacher
[1:41:07] can he opened his mouth and taught them
[1:41:10] saying
[1:41:13] the first step
[1:41:19] s for theirs is the kingdom
[1:41:28] you're
[1:41:31] a broken human being
[1:41:37] anybody like that in this room
[1:41:40] because if you are
[1:41:42] you're a candidate candidate
[1:41:46] for Perfection by the grace of God
