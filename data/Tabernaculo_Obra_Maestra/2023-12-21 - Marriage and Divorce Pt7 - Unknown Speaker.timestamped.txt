[46:37] God bless you all this
[46:39] morning this evening
[46:42] rather it's good to be back
[46:45] again uh we had a good time there
[46:48] visiting my son
[46:51] Jordan and uh we ministered for the
[46:55] Saints there there in
[46:58] Minnesota and had a good time with the
[47:01] church
[47:03] there uh visiting with uh the brother
[47:05] the pastor Brother Juan
[47:10] BL BL BL I think Brother Juan is uh it's
[47:16] not Juan like Juan it's it's it's a he's
[47:20] from
[47:22] Liberia one is one that's right
[47:27] and uh we had a good time with our
[47:29] brother and a good time of Fellowship
[47:31] around the word of God
[47:35] and and uh had opportunity to share a
[47:39] few things with the church
[47:44] there uh and it was cold and Minnesota
[47:47] is definitely
[47:50] cold although when we arrived uh we were
[47:52] expecting like last time to see three
[47:54] and four feet of
[47:59] snow and uh there wasn't any snow on the
[48:02] ground it it was
[48:05] cold so you know me and Karen thought
[48:09] wow this is going to be very nice you
[48:14] know it'll just be 20 and 30 degrees and
[48:17] no
[48:20] snow and we woke up the next morning it
[48:22] was covered with snow everywhere till
[48:24] the day we left
[48:28] but we knew we were going to
[48:32] Minnesota but um if you're ever in
[48:34] Minnesota there's a fine little church
[48:36] and some wonderful people there to
[48:44] visit and the best time to visit is
[48:47] summer and spring of
[48:52] course we we have our some Services here
[48:55] here this uh this Saturday and
[48:59] Sunday December the
[49:02] 23rd uh
[49:04] Saturday uh six service begins at 6:
[49:09] p.m then Sunday morning we'll be having
[49:12] a service a regular service at 10:00
[49:17] a.m. the uh young a young man A Young
[49:20] Brother by name of brother Cosman Stefan
[49:22] will be ministering for
[49:24] us
[49:27] Cosman Cosman Stefan Stefan uh he's
[49:30] originally from um Romania I
[49:34] believe Roman and uh we he is from uh
[49:40] Dallas Fort Fort Worth Dallas
[49:44] Texas and uh I'm sure he'll uh he'll be
[49:46] a blessing for all of
[49:49] us as we stand to our feet this
[49:54] evening
[49:56] and we'll be ministering part
[50:00] seven marriage and
[50:03] divorce I believe we'll be we'll be
[50:06] putting a comma on this on on on on this
[50:10] uh subject for
[50:16] now of of marriage and
[50:19] divorce and the and the key thought to
[50:22] understanding marriage and
[50:24] divorce
[50:29] the the subject I chose was in the mouth
[50:31] of two or three
[50:36] Witnesses because when uh William
[50:39] Brandon preached marriage and
[50:43] divorce he brought up these three
[50:47] Witnesses and of course it's it's not
[50:50] common for for people to for people to
[50:53] catch that that was the found Foundation
[50:56] of this
[51:06] teaching but it's a Bible
[51:10] principle that in the mouth of two or
[51:13] three
[51:15] Witnesses let everything be
[51:18] established and it holds very true to
[51:21] this teaching
[51:24] here
[51:26] let me also say that this teaching on
[51:28] marriage and
[51:32] divorce there is not a big back a big
[51:35] black period when we're done speaking on
[51:44] it we are not a
[51:47] denomination uh in what we believe and
[51:50] what we stand
[51:53] on the the the local assembly with its
[51:56] Pastor is
[51:59] Sovereign the local
[52:01] assembly and its
[52:03] Pastor is
[52:06] Sovereign so so the things that would
[52:08] take place in a local
[52:12] church and and what a pastor uh seeking
[52:18] seeking the truth from God's
[52:23] word can and every every every incident
[52:27] has details that are that are particular
[52:30] just to that group to that
[52:38] couple so then as a pastor you're trying
[52:41] to
[52:45] help those who are members of that
[52:48] little
[52:50] assembly and and the decision that he
[52:53] might he might make to help that
[53:00] couple may not be the same decision for
[53:03] each couple having
[53:08] issues because there may be details in
[53:12] in their
[53:15] lives one or two little different
[53:23] angles that that would call for for for
[53:27] some other little different
[53:37] advice so so for us to think we could
[53:42] judge another church or a pastor
[53:44] whatever decision they have made on a on
[53:46] a on a couple
[53:54] or
[53:57] we we we really wouldn't know the
[54:00] details of what's happening
[54:05] there and because we're not a
[54:09] denomination then we don't have laws
[54:13] that apply to
[54:15] everyone
[54:20] period so when we begin to understand
[54:22] the sovereignty of our little group here
[54:28] and and the sovereignty of every
[54:29] believing little groups or large
[54:35] groups then then we
[54:38] realize we we we might have an
[54:43] opinion uh but but in
[54:47] reality uh we should leave that to the
[54:51] local assembly and their
[54:54] pastors
[54:58] for they'll be the ones to answer for
[55:00] their
[55:04] conclusions and their
[55:06] decisions and above
[55:08] all there's no way for us to know the
[55:15] details have the mechanics and the
[55:20] Dynamics of every
[55:23] assembly so
[55:26] the ministering and the truths of
[55:28] marriage and
[55:31] divorce so so the the
[55:35] the the the truths of marriage and
[55:41] divorce wasn't to turn us into a
[55:49] denomination where everyone in this
[55:51] denomination must do the same
[55:54] thing
[55:57] or else you'll excommunicated from your
[56:02] denomination aren't you glad that aren't
[56:05] you
[56:06] glad that we can't be excommunicated
[56:09] from any
[56:12] denomination we we are
[56:15] free we are free to follow the leading
[56:18] of the Holy
[56:23] Spirit
[56:25] so marriage and
[56:29] divorce the help that that and the
[56:32] correction that was
[56:36] brought was to correct all the Proverbs
[56:40] of the Old
[56:44] Testament and to understand that under
[56:46] the Old
[56:49] Testament that that that their their
[56:51] rules and their laws of marriage and
[56:53] divorce
[56:58] it didn't fix
[56:59] anything it it didn't help uh I won't
[57:03] say it didn't
[57:06] help but it didn't change
[57:11] people the way a born again experience
[57:15] was supposed to change
[57:18] us for for a man and a woman who have
[57:21] not been born
[57:23] again
[57:26] no matter how good advice or a proverb
[57:29] you might give
[57:34] them if they cannot apply it by a
[57:37] revelation that has struck their
[57:42] hearts then there'll be no
[57:44] change in that
[57:47] relationship in that
[57:49] family there won't be a
[57:51] change it takes a
[57:53] revelation
[57:55] through a born again
[57:59] experience and the leadership of the
[58:01] Holy
[58:03] Ghost that will lead
[58:05] you to do all
[58:09] righteousness in all your
[58:13] relationships what of all the broken
[58:15] ones and the those married two and three
[58:17] and four
[58:23] times there there's a judgment
[58:27] day and and Jesus Christ will be the
[58:35] judge he's the Supreme
[58:39] judge he's the best
[58:41] judge he's the only righteous
[58:45] [Music]
[58:48] judge he he will judge
[58:51] us he will judge us according to our
[58:57] hearts you might see someone and say
[59:00] that man is the worst I've ever
[59:05] known had you known
[59:09] Saul had had had you known Saul of
[59:15] Tarsus if you would have known
[59:19] him as Saul of
[59:21] Tarsus and you were a new believer
[59:24] believe beling that Jesus was was the
[59:30] Christ that man was persecuting
[59:34] you that man was putting you in
[59:38] jail that man was killing the
[59:42] Believers not with his bare
[59:44] hands not with his bare hands but but by
[59:48] ordering others to do
[59:51] so so you would have judged them
[59:55] according to his actions and
[59:58] behavior but God rich in
[1:00:02] Mercy judge them according to a seed
[1:00:04] that was laying in his
[1:00:07] heart later Paul told
[1:00:10] us I am the chiefest of Sinners I'm the
[1:00:17] worst because because I persecuted the
[1:00:21] Church of
[1:00:22] God because I persecuted Ed the Church
[1:00:25] of
[1:00:27] God he says but God had
[1:00:32] mercy you know why he says God had mercy
[1:00:36] on me because I did it in
[1:00:41] ignorance now that's not a doctrine of
[1:00:43] all ignorance is
[1:00:48] blessed but it was his personal
[1:00:51] testimony that God Made Real to him
[1:00:56] turn turn with me to First
[1:01:00] Corinthians chapter
[1:01:04] 6 verse 15 and
[1:01:10] 16 we have brought forth the witness of
[1:01:13] Jesus
[1:01:15] Christ we brought forth the
[1:01:19] witness we brought forth the witness of
[1:01:23] Moses and now the third
[1:01:26] witness the prophet and Apostle
[1:01:30] Paul 1 Corinthians
[1:01:33] 6 15 and
[1:01:37] 16 know ye not that your bodies are the
[1:01:40] members of
[1:01:44] Christ shall I then take the members of
[1:01:47] Christ and make them the members of an
[1:01:53] harlot that can be applied spiritually
[1:01:56] and
[1:01:59] naturally verse 16 what he says what
[1:02:05] know ye not that he which is joined to
[1:02:07] an Harlot is one
[1:02:14] body for the two saith he shall be one
[1:02:20] flesh who said
[1:02:22] that almighty God
[1:02:25] God in the beginning for the two saith
[1:02:28] he shall be one
[1:02:32] flesh let's pray Heavenly Father we give
[1:02:36] you honor and glory and praise ask your
[1:02:39] blessings
[1:02:41] tonight in Jesus
[1:02:44] name amen amen you may be
[1:02:49] seated
[1:02:51] so the question the
[1:02:58] argument many times has been that if you
[1:03:02] are engaged to be
[1:03:06] married then you have made a
[1:03:10] vow and as far as God is concerned you
[1:03:13] are married
[1:03:18] already so then in this message it has
[1:03:21] been
[1:03:22] said that if you're
[1:03:26] engaged to
[1:03:28] someone then and the engagement is
[1:03:30] broken
[1:03:35] off a a and and that that you don't have
[1:03:38] a right to marry to marry to marry
[1:03:43] again for you've for in the eyes of God
[1:03:46] you've already been
[1:03:50] married so then we have men that hold to
[1:03:54] this very
[1:03:59] firm and there has and there has been
[1:04:02] men I'm going to say it for this little
[1:04:05] church
[1:04:06] ministers ministers who have lived very
[1:04:11] who have lived lives of
[1:04:14] fornication they never
[1:04:17] married they never made a marriage vow
[1:04:20] never were
[1:04:23] engaged but but prior to giving their
[1:04:27] hearts to Christ they had many intimate
[1:04:41] Partners sexual
[1:04:48] relationships and and and they they
[1:04:50] believe because they were never married
[1:04:52] or engaged
[1:04:58] despite the many people they were
[1:05:04] with that they have a right to
[1:05:08] preach because now that they've come
[1:05:10] into the
[1:05:12] gospel they they married one time and
[1:05:15] and they're the husband of one
[1:05:19] wife but before that they lived in
[1:05:23] fornication
[1:05:26] now the truth of marriage and
[1:05:31] divorce and and God calling us to live a
[1:05:34] holy
[1:05:36] life is is not just God's word for
[1:05:42] believers it's for the unbeliever
[1:05:46] too the same word will judge the
[1:05:49] believer and the
[1:05:53] unbeliever
[1:05:54] it's not a different measuring
[1:05:58] stick every human being will be judged
[1:06:01] by Christ The Living
[1:06:06] Word it's just that the believer wants
[1:06:08] to
[1:06:12] know and the unbeliever doesn't
[1:06:16] care and yet on the day of
[1:06:19] judgment they'll both be judged by the
[1:06:22] same word sure
[1:06:26] so here we have
[1:06:28] Paul saying
[1:06:31] this know ye not that your bodies are
[1:06:34] the members of
[1:06:38] Christ shall I then take the members of
[1:06:40] Christ and make them the members of an
[1:06:42] Harlot God
[1:06:49] forbid now listen to verse
[1:06:51] 16 Paul says what
[1:06:57] know ye not that he which is joined to a
[1:06:59] harlot is one
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:05] body he meaning
[1:07:11] what does he mean a
[1:07:15] Believer or does or does the he mean an
[1:07:21] unbeliever he means a man
[1:07:26] sinner or
[1:07:29] Saint believer or
[1:07:33] unbeliever know he not that he which is
[1:07:36] joined to a harlot is one
[1:07:39] body
[1:07:46] verse whether you're claim to be a
[1:07:48] believer or an
[1:07:51] unbeliever he is simply a man
[1:07:56] know ye not that he this a man which is
[1:08:00] joined to a harlot is one
[1:08:06] body Paul doesn't care if you go to
[1:08:08] church or don't go to
[1:08:11] church he's talk he's talking to the
[1:08:14] man then he says for
[1:08:18] two sayith
[1:08:21] he shall be one flesh
[1:08:26] now that he is talk that he's talking
[1:08:30] about is almighty
[1:08:33] God so God is
[1:08:35] saying that when you enter into a
[1:08:41] union
[1:08:44] physical you become one
[1:08:48] body and then he said for the two now he
[1:08:51] saith
[1:08:52] he
[1:08:54] shall be one
[1:08:59] flesh does that
[1:09:02] constitute before
[1:09:05] God your wife
[1:09:07] now in the Old Testament it
[1:09:14] did when a a a man could actually sell
[1:09:17] his
[1:09:19] daughter in the old in the Old Testament
[1:09:22] a father could actually sell his
[1:09:24] daughter another
[1:09:27] man and though the man bought her as a
[1:09:32] slave and
[1:09:34] though and though the man bought her as
[1:09:36] a
[1:09:43] slave if he became intimate with
[1:09:47] her it was his wife
[1:09:52] now
[1:09:54] you see what Paul is saying
[1:09:59] here you see how this book was written
[1:10:04] Old
[1:10:08] Testament you see how Paul is speaking
[1:10:13] here if this is a Bible
[1:10:17] truth then the mess of marriage and
[1:10:20] divorce
[1:10:21] is incredible
[1:10:27] then men who claim that they've only had
[1:10:30] one
[1:10:34] wife but lived in
[1:10:38] fornication then the first woman he was
[1:10:43] with whether he made her a promise with
[1:10:46] his mouth or
[1:10:52] not because because they were joined
[1:10:58] together though he joined himself to a
[1:11:02] harlot that first woman he joined
[1:11:04] himself
[1:11:08] to Paul is saying for the two he saith
[1:11:11] now are one
[1:11:15] flesh that first
[1:11:19] one is your
[1:11:22] wife
[1:11:28] and there are many men
[1:11:31] today that that that
[1:11:36] uh that preach that if you've been
[1:11:42] engaged and the engagement was
[1:11:45] broken before God you were
[1:11:49] married even though you're both clean
[1:11:51] and you never touched each other
[1:11:56] because they
[1:11:58] say the engagement was a
[1:12:01] vow but Paul is saying
[1:12:04] here if you're joined to an
[1:12:08] Harlot and he which is joined to a
[1:12:10] harlot is one
[1:12:14] body then we say explain that
[1:12:18] Paul let me explain it to you he
[1:12:20] says what I meant by that
[1:12:24] for two saith God shall now be one
[1:12:32] flesh so it's not only just The Vow
[1:12:41] perhaps but it's also the
[1:12:45] ACT if you've lived and practiced
[1:12:50] fornication you say I did it in
[1:12:52] ignorance
[1:12:56] our
[1:12:58] ignorance doesn't unnal the truth of
[1:13:00] God's
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:05] word his blood May forgive
[1:13:12] us but it doesn't change the truth of
[1:13:15] God's
[1:13:18] word a woman or a man who's lived as a
[1:13:22] prostitute or
[1:13:26] the blood can cleanse them
[1:13:30] and and give them
[1:13:34] salvation and you can be justified
[1:13:36] before
[1:13:39] God in the spirit man or
[1:13:44] woman but you will never be justified in
[1:13:47] this flesh
[1:13:50] body in which you committed the sins
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:56] amen because people just simply don't
[1:14:00] forget
[1:14:03] that and and
[1:14:06] God until you're born
[1:14:09] again and washed in the blood of
[1:14:14] Jesus he doesn't forget
[1:14:17] that but
[1:14:19] nonetheless Paul is saying
[1:14:22] here
[1:14:23] in First Corinthians
[1:14:26] 6 15 and
[1:14:30] 16 that the
[1:14:34] ACT also
[1:14:36] commits the two
[1:14:40] parties and the two are now one
[1:14:46] flesh the man or the woman could
[1:14:50] say well that was just a one night stand
[1:14:52] I didn't even love him and she didn't
[1:14:54] love me and and we've never spoken or
[1:14:57] seen each other again for the last 30
[1:14:59] years
[1:15:08] so and I've been married to this other
[1:15:10] woman now for all those for all these 30
[1:15:16] years but Paul is
[1:15:18] saying but you first joined
[1:15:22] yourself
[1:15:24] to a
[1:15:25] harlot and when you
[1:15:27] did you were one
[1:15:31] flesh you were husband and
[1:15:37] wife just a strong
[1:15:42] statement just as the vow and the
[1:15:52] engagement
[1:15:56] is there any forgiveness for all of
[1:16:00] it there
[1:16:04] is but for the that person that couple
[1:16:08] that those men those
[1:16:13] women when you know they're
[1:16:18] forgiven they cease to practice that
[1:16:22] lifestyle
[1:16:37] they first Corinthians 7
[1:16:41] now Apostle Paul 1 Corinthians 7 and
[1:16:45] verse
[1:16:50] one now concerning the things whereof ye
[1:16:54] wrote unto me it is good for a man not
[1:16:57] to touch a
[1:17:04] woman not not talking about a man's wife
[1:17:07] but any other
[1:17:14] woman never nevertheless to avoid
[1:17:17] fornication let every man have his own
[1:17:22] wife
[1:17:25] and let every woman have her own
[1:17:29] husband you know in in in holy
[1:17:33] matrimony in santoo
[1:17:38] matmon now Moses had given Israel a
[1:17:41] writing of
[1:17:45] divorcement but you know he never gave
[1:17:47] them a marriage license to
[1:17:52] sign
[1:17:54] mm to
[1:17:56] sign no they just had they could just
[1:17:59] they had the right to to to write up a
[1:18:02] divorce
[1:18:11] paper but in the Old
[1:18:15] Testament few if any ever had a writing
[1:18:20] of
[1:18:21] marriage
[1:18:31] or a marriage
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:37] certificate a vow was
[1:18:42] made then there was a time where that
[1:18:47] that woman now was already the man's
[1:18:51] wife
[1:18:54] she was a
[1:18:55] bride and as we said she was also his
[1:18:58] wife
[1:19:01] already so the bride was really the
[1:19:06] wife who was who was adorning herself
[1:19:09] and preparing her wedding
[1:19:14] garments for the day when there would be
[1:19:16] a public
[1:19:19] ceremony and they would
[1:19:21] celebrate now that her husband her the
[1:19:26] bridegroom would have the right to carry
[1:19:29] her and take her
[1:19:33] away and the father had to had to let go
[1:19:36] of all of his authority over the
[1:19:42] woman and now the man had full authority
[1:19:46] over this
[1:19:50] woman it was his wife
[1:19:53] up until the time of that of that public
[1:19:59] ceremony taking
[1:20:05] place the father could unn that
[1:20:11] wedding he could unn know the
[1:20:17] engagement for though she was under the
[1:20:19] vow she was already the man's wife
[1:20:27] he didn't have full authority over her
[1:20:33] completely the father
[1:20:36] did and the father could unn know
[1:20:39] that before the public
[1:20:44] ceremony so that was another
[1:20:49] difference a woman betrothed or engaged
[1:20:57] the
[1:20:58] woman and the woman who was now
[1:21:02] wife she had had the public ceremony the
[1:21:05] wedding day and the husband now took her
[1:21:12] away when that public ceremony took
[1:21:18] place the wedding
[1:21:21] day
[1:21:23] a a union between the two of them was
[1:21:25] was was was
[1:21:31] finished Not only was she the man's wife
[1:21:37] now but he now had all authority and
[1:21:40] power over the
[1:21:43] woman and the father now had none it was
[1:21:47] all
[1:21:49] gone another
[1:21:51] point between a woman
[1:21:56] betr and a woman
[1:22:00] married both were considered
[1:22:05] wife so this bride this
[1:22:09] wife once The Vow is
[1:22:13] made she's adorning
[1:22:16] herself preparing preparing her wedding
[1:22:20] garment for for the public
[1:22:24] ceremony of that wedding
[1:22:27] day when the husband would now take her
[1:22:31] away to live with him
[1:22:36] eternally speaking spiritually now a
[1:22:39] spiritual
[1:22:41] type so the Rapture is the
[1:22:45] type of this wedding
[1:22:48] day when the when the husband Jesus
[1:22:51] Christ
[1:22:53] takes his bride
[1:22:56] away and where does where do they go
[1:22:59] after the marriage the
[1:23:02] wedding to the wedding supper of the
[1:23:06] Lamb the husband has taken her
[1:23:09] away to live with him now
[1:23:13] eternally so Paul here in 1 Corinthians
[1:23:18] 7 verse two he said nevertheless to
[1:23:21] avoid fornication let every man have his
[1:23:23] own wife and let every woman have her
[1:23:25] own
[1:23:31] husband let the husband Render unto the
[1:23:34] wife do
[1:23:39] benevolence and likewise also the wife
[1:23:41] unto the
[1:23:44] husband what what's happening now in
[1:23:47] this new
[1:23:50] testament God is making them close
[1:23:52] closer to coequal than they have ever
[1:23:54] been in the
[1:24:01] last under the law they were never close
[1:24:04] to being
[1:24:06] co-equal under the Old
[1:24:09] Testament but under the New
[1:24:12] Testament God is bringing them more
[1:24:15] co-equal than they've ever been in
[1:24:17] thousands of
[1:24:21] years
[1:24:24] verse four then he says the wife hath
[1:24:27] not power over her own body but the
[1:24:35] husband there went the thought of being
[1:24:44] co-equal but and likewise also the
[1:24:47] husband hath not power of his own body
[1:24:50] but the wife
[1:24:55] now we're back to being
[1:24:56] co-equal we just by just by going past
[1:24:59] the
[1:25:02] comma then he says verse five defraud ye
[1:25:05] not one another except it be with
[1:25:07] consent for a
[1:25:13] time that you may give yourself to
[1:25:16] fasting and prayer and come together
[1:25:21] again
[1:25:27] that Satan tempt you not for your
[1:25:35] incontinency then he says but I speak
[1:25:38] this by permission and not by
[1:25:45] commandment in other words what Paul is
[1:25:47] saying in verse
[1:25:50] six Paul says the thing I'm telling you
[1:25:54] now I ask permission to give you this
[1:26:05] advice he says and God has given me
[1:26:08] permission to say what I'm going to tell
[1:26:17] you to help you it's not thus sayith the
[1:26:21] Lord
[1:26:23] but in another place he says but I
[1:26:24] believe I have the Holy
[1:26:28] Spirit so now verse
[1:26:31] S for I would that all men were even as
[1:26:34] I
[1:26:40] myself but every man hath his proper
[1:26:43] gift of God one after this manner and
[1:26:45] another after
[1:26:51] that
[1:26:53] it's
[1:26:56] it's it's not thus sayith the
[1:26:58] Lord though it's laying in the
[1:27:02] Bible but it's
[1:27:04] advice that Paul asked almighty
[1:27:11] God to to be able to give us this
[1:27:17] advice to help us in these
[1:27:21] situations of marriage
[1:27:25] divorce and family
[1:27:31] relationships verse eight I say
[1:27:34] therefore to the unmarried and widows
[1:27:37] it's good for them if they abide even as
[1:27:45] I he's not saying you must do
[1:27:49] this he's not he's not saying this is
[1:27:52] this is the new
[1:27:55] law there is no such thing as a new
[1:27:59] law it was law back
[1:28:02] then it's Grace
[1:28:07] today verse n but if they cannot contain
[1:28:12] let them marry for it is better to marry
[1:28:15] than to burn
[1:28:21] verse
[1:28:24] verse
[1:28:26] 10 and unto the married I command yet
[1:28:30] not I but the
[1:28:35] Lord he's telling us let me remind you
[1:28:39] this is not thus saith the
[1:28:43] Lord It's but but I ask God permission
[1:28:47] to tell you these things I'm going to
[1:28:49] conso you
[1:28:51] on
[1:28:53] and and the Holy Spirit gave me that
[1:28:57] permission that's why I'm saying what
[1:28:59] I'm saying to you
[1:29:01] he so un verse 10 and unto the married I
[1:29:05] command and then he then they reflects
[1:29:07] for a minute wait a minute they're going
[1:29:09] to misunderstand
[1:29:14] me and unto the married I command then
[1:29:18] he thinks for a second yet not I but the
[1:29:21] Lord
[1:29:22] let not the wife depart from her
[1:29:34] husband said let not the wife depart
[1:29:37] from her
[1:29:40] husband that's not a period he put at
[1:29:42] the end of
[1:29:45] that because the next verse reveals
[1:29:49] it then Paul says but
[1:29:52] and if she
[1:29:55] depart so that his advice was to the
[1:29:58] wife don't leave your
[1:30:03] husband but if you do leave
[1:30:07] him remain
[1:30:12] unmarried or be reconciled to your
[1:30:19] husband then he says
[1:30:23] and let not the husband put away his
[1:30:28] wife the the the the the the marriage
[1:30:33] the the the the the the marriage between
[1:30:36] a man and a
[1:30:39] woman has never been more closer to
[1:30:42] being
[1:30:46] co-equal as it is as it's as it's taught
[1:30:50] in this new testament
[1:30:54] this New
[1:30:57] Covenant this New and Living
[1:31:02] Way verse 12 says but to the rest speak
[1:31:07] I not the
[1:31:10] Lord the third time
[1:31:13] now he's he he he's telling us
[1:31:17] again I asked permission to tell you
[1:31:20] these things
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:24] and God has given me that
[1:31:27] permission to tell you and speak to
[1:31:30] you things that will help
[1:31:33] you in your in your marriages in your
[1:31:37] union verse 12 but to the rest speak I
[1:31:40] not the Lord if any brother hath a wife
[1:31:44] that believeth
[1:31:50] not
[1:31:54] if any brother has a wife that believeth
[1:32:00] not apply the
[1:32:02] token apply the
[1:32:05] token and get her out of your
[1:32:08] home he didn't say
[1:32:11] that but many do say
[1:32:14] that knowing nothing about the man or
[1:32:17] the woman the husband and
[1:32:20] wife they make that
[1:32:22] statement they put a period on
[1:32:25] it and they make a
[1:32:29] Doctrine that's that's up to
[1:32:31] them but that's not the advice that Paul
[1:32:36] gave someone might say well there's a
[1:32:38] lot of reasons why you
[1:32:43] would but let's keep
[1:32:46] reading if any brother have a wife that
[1:32:48] believeth
[1:32:50] not
[1:32:53] and she is pleased to dwell with
[1:32:57] him that's a large that's a big
[1:33:02] statement and she is pleased to dwell
[1:33:05] with
[1:33:07] him let him not put her
[1:33:12] away let him not put her
[1:33:16] away we're learning things now about
[1:33:18] marriage and
[1:33:20] divorce
[1:33:25] that you couldn't
[1:33:27] know unless you
[1:33:32] understand that the truth is in the
[1:33:34] mouth of these three
[1:33:38] Witnesses the greatest advice is in the
[1:33:40] mouth of these three
[1:33:48] Witnesses verse
[1:33:50] 13 and the
[1:33:52] woman which hath an husband that
[1:33:54] believeth
[1:33:58] not and if he be pleased to dwell with
[1:34:04] her let her not leave
[1:34:09] him for the unbelieving husband is
[1:34:12] Sanctified by the
[1:34:16] wife let her not leave
[1:34:20] him let her
[1:34:23] if he be pleased to dwell with her let
[1:34:25] her not leave
[1:34:29] him what if he's not
[1:34:35] pleased what if he's
[1:34:38] abusive
[1:34:41] verbally
[1:34:43] physically
[1:34:45] emotionally then Paul said the woman
[1:34:49] doesn't have to stay with that kind of
[1:34:50] man
[1:34:55] and yet he says but if you leave
[1:34:59] him remain
[1:35:02] unmarried and remember all this that
[1:35:04] he's
[1:35:07] saying he's saying by
[1:35:10] permission that he asked
[1:35:13] God to give him
[1:35:16] permission to say these
[1:35:18] things this cel
[1:35:22] everything he's
[1:35:23] saying has a
[1:35:25] comma he's laying nothing down with the
[1:35:30] period three times he tells
[1:35:34] us I'm saying this by
[1:35:38] permission it's not thus sayith the
[1:35:43] Lord but I have asked God to let me tell
[1:35:46] you
[1:35:49] something to teach te you how to live at
[1:35:54] peace and how to be co-equal in your
[1:35:58] marriage
[1:36:03] Affairs closer to the beginning than
[1:36:06] it's ever been
[1:36:10] before is what the
[1:36:15] advice of these three Witnesses is
[1:36:18] giving
[1:36:20] us
[1:36:24] Jesus brought the
[1:36:29] change
[1:36:30] Paul explained the
[1:36:33] change in more
[1:36:37] detail watch verse 13 now once again and
[1:36:41] the woman which ha a husband that
[1:36:43] believeth not and if he be pleased to
[1:36:46] dwell with her if he be pleased or if
[1:36:50] she be pleased Paul was saying when he
[1:36:51] turned it around if he be pleased to
[1:36:53] dwell with her let her not leave
[1:37:04] him so even if a pastor would tell the
[1:37:09] woman your husband's not a
[1:37:12] Believer you need to leave
[1:37:15] him that's not what Paul
[1:37:17] said that's not the conso in the Bible
[1:37:22] all she has to say but he's pleased to
[1:37:25] dwell with
[1:37:31] me he'll take me to
[1:37:34] church he picks me up from
[1:37:37] church he encourages me to keep going to
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:42] church he just tells me this ain't for
[1:37:44] me he
[1:37:50] says don't leave
[1:37:54] him because of the bad advice of some
[1:38:02] Minister verse 14 for the unbelieving
[1:38:05] husband is Sanctified by the wife and
[1:38:08] the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by
[1:38:11] the husband else were your children
[1:38:13] unclean but now are they
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:20] holy
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:28] but if the unbelieving depart let him
[1:38:36] depart but if the unbelieving depart let
[1:38:40] him
[1:38:43] depart a brother or a sister is not
[1:38:46] under bondage in such
[1:38:50] cases
[1:38:54] but God hath called us to peace verse
[1:38:59] 15 a brother or sister is not under
[1:39:02] bondage in such cases but God hath
[1:39:05] called us to
[1:39:16] peace the wisdom of
[1:39:20] Paul
[1:39:21] by the Holy
[1:39:23] Spirit has has given him these words for
[1:39:29] us though he told us it's not thus saith
[1:39:32] the
[1:39:33] Lord but I have asked permission of
[1:39:37] God to share these things with
[1:39:40] you and God has given me permission to
[1:39:43] say it to
[1:39:46] you verse 16 for what knowest thou oh
[1:39:50] wife whether Thou shalt save thy husband
[1:39:53] or how knowest thou oh man whether Thou
[1:39:55] shalt save thy
[1:40:06] wife Mark
[1:40:08] 10 Mark 10 and verse
[1:40:14] 6 Mark 10 and verse
[1:40:18] 6 and it reads like this verse 6
[1:40:21] but from the beginning of the creation
[1:40:24] God made them male and
[1:40:33] female Mark 10 and
[1:40:36] chapter
[1:40:44] six Mark 10 and verse 6 but from the
[1:40:48] beginning of the creation God made them
[1:40:50] m male and
[1:40:55] female for this cause shall a man leave
[1:40:58] his father and mother and cleave to his
[1:41:04] wife and they twain shall be one
[1:41:09] flesh so then they are no more Twain but
[1:41:12] one
[1:41:16] flesh what therefore God had joined
[1:41:19] together let no man put us
[1:41:25] under but what if you become one with a
[1:41:31] harlot didn't you also just become one
[1:41:36] flesh regardless of the poor choice that
[1:41:39] you
[1:41:42] made what therefore God had joined
[1:41:45] together let no man put us
[1:41:48] under verse n
[1:41:54] and in the house his disciples asked him
[1:41:56] again of the same
[1:42:01] matter this is Jesus
[1:42:04] speaking and he saith unto him whosoever
[1:42:07] shall put away his wife and marry
[1:42:10] another committeth adultery against
[1:42:18] her he's talking about a married man
[1:42:22] man married to to to the to his first
[1:42:28] wife which is his true
[1:42:34] wife he says can he sayth unto them
[1:42:37] whosoever shall put away his wife the
[1:42:40] wife of thy youth thy first
[1:42:46] wife can and marry another committeth
[1:42:49] adultery against her
[1:42:53] that's the man and if a woman shall put
[1:42:56] away her
[1:43:00] husband because really in
[1:43:04] scripture you will have one husband and
[1:43:07] one
[1:43:10] wife and that'll be the husband of thy
[1:43:13] youth or the wife of thy
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:19] youth
[1:43:21] your first the first man or
[1:43:24] woman the first man or
[1:43:28] woman in with which you have a
[1:43:34] union in intimacy
[1:43:37] together and if a woman shall put away
[1:43:39] her husband verse 12 and be married to
[1:43:41] another she committeth
[1:43:48] adultery first Corinthians 7
[1:43:51] and verse
[1:43:57] 39 First Corinthians
[1:44:01] 7:39 the wife is bound by the law as
[1:44:05] long as her husband
[1:44:08] liveth
[1:44:11] 39 First
[1:44:19] Corinthian she is at Liberty he says but
[1:44:23] if her husband be dead she's at Liberty
[1:44:25] to be married to whom she will only in
[1:44:28] the
[1:44:47] Lord under the Old Testament
[1:44:51] if a woman was put
[1:44:54] away for
[1:44:57] uncleanness accused of her
[1:45:01] husband uh that she was
[1:45:04] unclean which was a a very general
[1:45:09] term basically it was saying I don't
[1:45:12] want you
[1:45:15] anymore and he gave her a writing of
[1:45:19] divorce that that woman under the law
[1:45:23] could marry
[1:45:26] again for she
[1:45:29] was for she was lawfully but unjustly
[1:45:34] rejected for she was
[1:45:38] lawfully but unjustly
[1:45:41] rejected the law allowed
[1:45:45] it but it was
[1:45:48] unjust the the law may allow allow
[1:45:52] it but it was
[1:45:55] unethical the law may allow
[1:45:59] it but that didn't make it righteous or
[1:46:04] holy The Ten
[1:46:06] Commandments were Proverbs given to
[1:46:11] Israel not thus sayith the
[1:46:14] Lord that's why when we read in the New
[1:46:18] Testament and Jesus said
[1:46:21] you have heard it said by them of old
[1:46:27] time that thou shalt not
[1:46:30] kill but I say unto you you see it was a
[1:46:36] proverb it was subject to
[1:46:39] change and thus saith the Lord changed
[1:46:43] it because Jesus said but I say unto you
[1:46:47] now th sayith the Lord
[1:46:51] I'm not going to give you a
[1:46:52] law but I'm going to give you something
[1:46:54] that you can live
[1:46:57] by you can stand
[1:47:01] by and and you can achieve it through a
[1:47:04] born again
[1:47:10] experience so you can live by the
[1:47:14] law and still be living in
[1:47:18] sin so the man
[1:47:21] of the Israelites of the Old
[1:47:25] Testament though they were living by the
[1:47:28] law and the proverb that Moses gave
[1:47:34] them they were every one of them still
[1:47:37] living in
[1:47:40] sin but from the
[1:47:43] beginning it wasn't
[1:47:45] so here the proverb of the Jeremiah
[1:47:49] quotes in Jeremiah
[1:47:52] Jeremiah chapter
[1:47:58] 3 and verse
[1:48:02] one Jeremiah chter 3 and verse
[1:48:14] one Jeremiah 3:1 they
[1:48:18] say if a man put a way his wife and she
[1:48:21] go from him and become another man's and
[1:48:25] become another man's shall shall he
[1:48:29] return unto her again shall not the land
[1:48:32] be greatly polluted he said but thou H
[1:48:35] has played the harlet with many lovers
[1:48:38] yet return again to me sayeth the
[1:48:49] Lord
[1:49:03] so here Jeremiah is quoting from the
[1:49:06] words of
[1:49:14] Deuteronomy Moses Moses he said about a
[1:49:18] man who has put away his wife
[1:49:22] wife not for
[1:49:24] adultery not for
[1:49:26] fornication not for anything she's done
[1:49:30] wrong simply because he has declared her
[1:49:35] unclean because he doesn't want her no
[1:49:38] more you see they could put their wives
[1:49:40] away for what
[1:49:45] reason any
[1:49:48] reason and when they they weren't guilty
[1:49:50] of any
[1:49:56] wrongdoing they would simply declare
[1:49:59] them
[1:50:02] unclean and give her a writing of
[1:50:04] divorce and put her
[1:50:07] away and that woman could remarry
[1:50:12] again but she could never return if her
[1:50:15] second husband
[1:50:18] died if okay if he put her
[1:50:22] away she could never return back to her
[1:50:25] first
[1:50:27] husband or marry
[1:50:29] again under the
[1:50:32] law in the message marriage and divorce
[1:50:35] we're going to be closing
[1:50:38] now paragraph
[1:50:41] 311 to
[1:50:44] 3:14 I want to read you this
[1:50:46] quote brother brandom is is closing now
[1:50:50] the message he
[1:50:52] preached on marriage and
[1:50:55] divorce he says in First Corinthians the
[1:50:59] 7th
[1:51:02] chapter 12th and 15th
[1:51:05] verse in the New Testament Pro in the
[1:51:08] New
[1:51:09] Testament Paul a
[1:51:13] prophet who met the same thing in the
[1:51:18] church and spoke this
[1:51:21] this is I not the
[1:51:24] Lord is that
[1:51:26] right because of divorce
[1:51:30] conditions it wasn't so from the
[1:51:34] beginning but Moses was permitted was
[1:51:37] was permitted it or allowed
[1:51:40] it and God recognized it
[1:51:46] righteousness and Paul also had a right
[1:51:51] when he found his church in that
[1:51:54] condition and he asked God for
[1:51:59] permission to try to help the people in
[1:52:03] this condition of divorce and
[1:52:08] marriage broken
[1:52:11] families like Satan had done to the
[1:52:14] first family in
[1:52:17] Eden and it's and it's been a problem
[1:52:20] through through the history of
[1:52:25] mankind and Moses tried to help the
[1:52:29] people and ask God for
[1:52:32] permission and Paul tried to help the
[1:52:35] people and ask God for permission to
[1:52:37] give him this
[1:52:40] advice he said now you now you believe
[1:52:44] if you believe this to be
[1:52:47] true and believe it come from God
[1:52:51] God and by the Vindication of his cloud
[1:52:54] and his
[1:52:57] message that's brought that's brought me
[1:52:59] this
[1:53:01] far should not
[1:53:05] God should not God upon the mountain
[1:53:08] permit me to do the same
[1:53:15] thing to to suffer you or to allow you
[1:53:20] to go on to go on the way you
[1:53:26] are and do it no
[1:53:28] more go with your wives and live in
[1:53:33] peace for the hour is
[1:53:35] late the coming of the Lord is at
[1:53:39] hand we haven't got
[1:53:42] time to break these things
[1:53:45] up don't dare try to do it
[1:53:48] again I'm speaking only to my
[1:53:54] congregation but if you are
[1:53:57] married and God bore me witness of that
[1:53:59] on the
[1:54:06] mountain that I could say this to
[1:54:10] you a supernatural
[1:54:14] Revelation because of the opening of The
[1:54:18] Seven Seals
[1:54:21] in other words he's telling us I
[1:54:23] wouldn't have the permission to tell you
[1:54:25] what I'm telling you right
[1:54:28] now if it wouldn't be for the opening of
[1:54:31] The Seven
[1:54:33] se he said it
[1:54:37] 1965 February the
[1:54:40] 24th he says the
[1:54:42] 21st he says and this is the question in
[1:54:46] God's
[1:54:48] word
[1:54:51] he said let them let them go on as they
[1:54:54] are this is what he's telling us that
[1:54:56] God told him that he could
[1:55:01] say to his
[1:55:03] congregation let them go on in as they
[1:55:07] are and sin no
[1:55:13] more it wasn't so from the
[1:55:16] beginning that is
[1:55:18] right wasn't
[1:55:20] so and it will not be at the
[1:55:24] end but under modern
[1:55:29] conditions as God's
[1:55:32] servant I won't call myself his
[1:55:36] Prophet but I
[1:55:38] believe
[1:55:40] maybe if I wouldn't be sent for
[1:55:48] that I'm laying a ground for them when
[1:55:52] he does
[1:56:01] come so so so under the modern he says
[1:56:06] he
[1:56:08] says so under the modern
[1:56:12] conditions I command you to go to your
[1:56:18] home with your wife
[1:56:21] now if you are happy with
[1:56:24] her live with her raise your children in
[1:56:28] the admonition of
[1:56:34] God but God be merciful to
[1:56:41] you if you ever do that
[1:56:46] again you teach your children
[1:56:50] to never do a thing like
[1:56:52] that bring them up in the admonition of
[1:56:57] God and now that you are as you
[1:57:03] are let us go
[1:57:06] now at the late evening hour that we're
[1:57:09] living
[1:57:11] in and press towards the mark of the
[1:57:14] high calling in
[1:57:18] Christ

[1:57:55] permission for them to speak to the
[1:58:00] people and judge these
[1:58:06] matters let's pray Heavenly
[1:58:11] Father it was the family that Satan
[1:58:15] divided in the
[1:58:18] beginning
[1:58:22] it it was the relationship between a man
[1:58:25] and his
[1:58:32] wife that Lucifer attacked
[1:58:36] first and he's used and he's played the
[1:58:40] same game for thousands of
[1:58:45] years and the only way that you can get
[1:58:48] off of playing that game
[1:58:53] of fornication and
[1:58:55] adultery is you
[1:58:57] must be born
[1:58:59] again without the Born Again
[1:59:05] experience without the Born Again
[1:59:10] experience you're
[1:59:11] lost in sin and
[1:59:16] fornication in adultery and
[1:59:22] idolatry Lord help
[1:59:24] us to be born
[1:59:27] again and when Temptation

[1:59:40] refilling of your Holy
[1:59:43] Spirit to give us the
[1:59:46] victory the victor over every strong
[1:59:54] Temptation making us
[1:59:57] Overcomers that's the way we're adorning
[2:00:00] ourselves as the
[2:00:02] bride and preparing our wedding
[2:00:05] garment with the baptism of the Holy
[2:00:09] Ghost and refilling after
[2:00:13] refilling that gives us a
[2:00:15] victory in Christ Lord we thank you
[2:00:20] bless your people here

[2:01:58] problem in having something to minister

[2:02:06] children because it's an eternal book
[2:02:08] that's been open to
[2:02:11] us no our
