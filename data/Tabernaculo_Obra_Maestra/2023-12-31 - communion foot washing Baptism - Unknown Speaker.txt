us and to give us a victory every day every morning every evening we're looking for a victory through Christ Jesus our lord and savior we stand to our feet this morning it's it's New Year's Eve and uh new a new year will begin in the next TW less than 24 hours at least that's what they want us to believe but if if we didn't have days and and months to to to gauge anything by we we might live a little more peaceful but science has given us a clock that is ticking and and because of that sometimes we come to a place where we start believing that our clock began ticking the day we were born and the day we die it t the clock stops but that's just speaking humanly but if but if we what if we desire not to fall into that belief and yet we take God's word instead then we realize that our clock never had a beginning and our clock will never have an end end because in US is a gene of God because we're Sons and Daughters of God because we were in his thoughts before the foundation of the world because we're as Eternal as he is eternal and he's come to take us back to that beginning we can't die we'll only be changed from from this Earthly Tabernacle to a Heavenly Tabernacle that awaits us but we must lay this one down to get the other one and not only will a day come for us to do that and partake of it literally but spiritually he wants us to lay this down every day this fleshly body with with with all the lust of the Flesh of the eye the pride of life lay it down daily and know that this this this Earthly Tabernacle will not control us but we've been given the Holy Spirit to mortify the Deeds of the Flesh and Quicken the things of the spirit the spirit of Christ if you turn with me in your Bibles to Genesis 14 the title this morning is communion foot washing and baptism three ordinances left to us to a New Testament Church to a group of Believers in Christ to those who are born again to those who have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ three simple ordinances have been left Genesis 14 verse 16 to 20 and it reads like this and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the woman also and the people and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of shador Lamar and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shave which is the King's Dale and MDC king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God it was Christ himself it was that Mighty Angel he said and he was the priest of the most high God and he was the verse 18 okay and mzc king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and and he was the priest of the most high God and and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which has delivered thy enemies into thy hand and he gave them tithes of all let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this morning may your word be a blessing to each and everyone May Open the Eyes of our understanding that we might see things we've never seen before Lord that make our journey lighter for you said your burden was light and thy yoke is easy so we thank you for this yoke of a supernatural marriage covenant and we thank you Lord Jesus for blessing us in Jesus name amen am you may be seated three ordinances left to a New Testament Church communion the Lord's Supper foot washing and baptism by submerging in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all of all three of these have been perverted in one way or another the Lord's Supper the partaking of the bread and the wine the what it represents to the believer and yet the churches turned it into something perverted and by perverting it they've made it a mockery to the to to the people of God in the days of the apostolic church when I was a young man a young boy there were those Apostolic churches that that believed in partaking of the bread and the wine then within the same denomination there were those that believed it was spiritual only and and those that that partook of the of the supper they they didn't do it in a sacred way they they'd go to the back and washing the feet you you you'd see the Brethren some of them the younger the younger men tickling each other's feet it it it be it it became something something of wickedness in the churches those that tried to partake of it and keep it something something sacred then they they were mocked of those that said it was only spiritual and they would call those that partook of it they'd call them wios and this is something that's written in the Bible that we're told to partake of and yet it's become something that is not partaken of very often anymore I think it's because the sacredness of God's word is leaving the churches I think it's because Holiness is not being practiced and and preached in the churches the first time Bread and Wine was served or one of the first times was after Abraham returned when he returned after a great battle he had gone to bring back a brother he had gone to bring back the families he had gone to bring back all their possessions they had been taken captive they had been taken slaves they were now the prisoners of another nation and Abraham rose up with those men who had been trained in his house to go bring back the lost to go bring back their possessions to set his children free again and God gave him the victory to do this and when he came back the Bible says melchisedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine he prepared a supper in honor of what Abraham had done to celebrate the freedom and the salvation of these [Music] people it represented something this was a special supper the wine represented something the bread represented something what they were celebrating was Freedom was Deliverance was salvation here in this day in St John chapter 6 verse 53 here Jesus was speaking to his disciples St John 6 53-58 and verse 53 reads like this then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you we re we realize now that Jesus was not speaking literally but that he was speaking in a parable and in this Parable his the eating of his flesh represented something and in this Parable the drinking of his blood represented something and in this Parable if you failed or refused to eat the flesh or drink the blood he he said you have no life in you because he is the only life we must receive him we must accept him who 54 who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day this was prophecy this was a parable this was things hidden within the [Music] lines for my flesh is meat indeed verse 55 and my blood is drink indeed then he says he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in oh he is just emphasizing he says he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him now he's talking about an invisible Union that's going to happen in your life when you become a partaker he says verse 57 as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me he's persisting in this Parable he's insisting you flesh he's not backing off and explaining it this is this verse 58 this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever Jesus the Lamb of God was now both Bread and Wine flesh and blood under the Old Testament type the lamb was something that Israel had to slay the bread was something that Israel had to make but the day would come when the Lamb of God would be a man and the bread of God would be a man and the blood of God would be a man St John 13 beginning at verse one one Jesus himself ordaining this ritual of foot washing uh my grandfather his name was Francisco Francisco a Portuguese man his father and mother were from Portugal my my great-grandparents to miss they he he had a he had a journey in life he came from not being any kind of a Believer he later he later converted to the Baptist Church back in the 1930s or so by the 19 1940s he had moved on and and and and found the Pentecostal people when the when the when the Pentecostal Church became a denomination in 1946 1948 he left the Pentecostal church he told me they should have never done that says they left God so I left them he said this was the late 1940s from from that day forward everywhere he lived in here in Poria he he would build a little building put a sign over the door Iglesia he would open the church churches the two doors up wide he was a carpenter and he began preaching his wife would be there his kids would be there he'd open the doors the windows and he'd preached into the neighborhoods I I remember talking to him and and he W he was exhorting me about about partaking of the bread and the wine and the Lord's supper and he says you shouldn't do that he said it's spiritual he would tell me he said it's wrong he' tell me I was I had just given my heart to the Lord I was 18 19 years old and I read him the scripture I said grandfather I love being with you cuz you tell me about the Lord Jesus he says and you tell me to stay with the word and I read to him where Jesus said I give you an example you do likewise I said if he said that and you're telling me I shouldn't who should I obey I said I'd never seen a look on that man's face like I did that [Music] morning he he didn't answer me but the look on his face was a look of I don't know what to call it shock because even he in the Holiness groups he belong to had accepted that propaganda and though he was a man that read his Bible night and day somehow the old teaching of the denominations he was in didn't allow him to read the Bible and see what he was reading though he would read it over and over the eyes of his understanding were clouded and with shock in his face he just got up and walked out of the room and he never spoke to me of that again I could see it had become in his life a great struggle now cuz I told him you see Grandpa Jesus said so and he's looking at his bible and he sees it but he'd been so long believing it a different way St John 13 and verse one now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour has come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them un the end [Music] put your name there that's you he's speaking of that's me he's speaking of verse two and supper being ended the devil having put into the heart of Judas scariot Simon's son to betray him say Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God this describes every son and daughter of God who's been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and is born again that you come from God and you're returning back to God verse four he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself almighty God he rises from supper laid his laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself to and GED himself verse four you might say but that was Jesus he could humble himself that way after that verse five he porth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherein he was girded almighty God made flesh washing the feet of his disciples then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter say unto him Lord does thou wash my feet in other words Peter saying you're not going to wash my feet no no you're the boss around here you don't have to do that no don't worry about that uh I'm fine Jesus answered and said unto him verse 7 what I do thou knowest not now Jesus is saying when you have a foot wash Wasing service maybe many of you won't understand what you're doing at the moment but Jesus said but Thou shalt know Hereafter it would be revealed in our day what that ordinance would would would think would mean it would reveal in our days what it would do for us when we partake of it three ordinances left to the church but their life shaking ordinances verse eight Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet I want to read that again Peter a man born in sin shaped in iniquity all of a sudden he's feeling more righteous than Jesus himself and he says oh no that ain't right you will never wash my feet never he said to Jesus he drew a line in the sand don't cross that line Jesus you're not washing my feet night Jesus answered him verse eight if I if I Jesus wash thee not thou H has no part with me and the only Jesus that anyone has a chance to see that anyone has a chance to see on planet Earth is you and I verse n Simon Peter saith unto him Lord if there's something I want is to be part of you and if this is what it'll take Lord not my feet only but my hands and my head he said Jesus Jesus saith unto him verse 10 he that is washed needeth not to needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wi and ye are clean but not all for there was one who would partake of that supper in that night that when he went to grab the bread Jesus's hand was in the bread with him it was Judas and he was not clean neither would he be cleansed he was not clean nor verse 11 for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his and had taken his garments and was sit down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you they didn't know they didn't understand even the action not only his words but his action was a parable a mystery a prophecy verse 13 ye call me master and Lord can you say well for so I [Music] am for if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet when I read it to my grandfather something I knew he had read hundreds of times and I asked him who should should I believe you or Jesus he he didn't know what to say he knew what he wanted to say always believe Jesus but now it had become something between believing him or Jesus he realized where he had placed himself in a spot where he never thought he would go that he would stand between a young man and the words of Jesus himself he didn't answer me a word he just got up quietly with head bowed and walked out of the room verse verse 15 Jesus speaking for I Jesus have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye just to know them he didn't say that if you know these things you only be happy if you do them right in the book of Exodus Israel in Egypt and God had planned a great day of Deliverance God had planned a great day of Deliverance and in verse in Exodus 12:3 was a was a night to be remembered so so much of a remembrance of it would be that a memorial would be placed for Israel forever it would be called the Passover supper he says and in verse 13 of Exodus 12 it reads like this and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are the blood is still a token today to be placed on the door of this house this Earthly Tabernacle he says and when I see the blood I will pass over you verse 13 and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord Lord throughout your generations and you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever the Bible said the Lord said it's a feast that you'll keep throughout your generations and someone said brother Daniel that Generations that was Jews not Gentiles so maybe that doesn't apply to us listen to Matthew 1 and verse one when Matthew is is opening this gospel and he says the book of the generation of Jesus Christ now he's going to start naming this generation of Jesus Christ and it begins by saying the son of David the son of Abraham so the it's Matthew 1:1 the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham and he goes down the list naming Isaac and Jacob and abinadab naming all the names of the tribe of Judah until he gets to Joseph down to the end so who is this generation are we not the generation of Jesus Christ is not Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham God is claiming them as the generation of Jesus Christ so here in Exodus when it and the Lord said verse 14 Exodus 12 and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your Generations what Generations a Generation of Vipers no a generation of Jesus Christ beginning from Adam going down to the very last you and I this morning were the same generation of Jesus of Jesus Christ verse 15 of Exodus 12 seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leaven bread from the first day until the day that Soul shall be cut off from Israel and from this day forward they partook of this ritual called the Passover it was a supper but they were never understanding the prophetic significance that that that it what it represented that one day a man would be God's lamb these ordinances that are left to us communion foot washing baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus the revelation of it is that one day a man would be God's lamb Israel partook of the Passover as a memorial of what had God had done for them when they had become enslaved so the partaking of the Passover was a memorial of the power of God to set his people free it still represents that today partaking of the bread and the wine today when we partake of it it is a memorial of the day that God set you [Music] free it's mesc priesthood serving you a memorial supper of the freedom that he has given you of the Deliverance of the hope that you'll be free forever in Christ now but for Israel it was only a memorial they didn't understand it they didn't see it was just a shadow of something to come they didn't realize that this Shadow would come into a reality one day and the day would come when they would kill God's lamb on a Passover feast and totally blind that once again like the first lamb that was ever killed in Egypt was shadow of one day of a lamb they would kill in Jerusalem the day would come again when they would kill God's lamb on Passover but the wickedness this time is they would refuse to put his blood on the door of their hearts they would refuse to eat his flesh the revealed word of God they would they would refuse to partake of the Lord's Supper for to partake of the the Lord's Supper today is to is to annal the Proverbs of an old Covenant and receive the revelation of The Parables of Jesus wherein lays the revelation of those Seven Seals or the seven parts of his great Plan of Redemption to save you to heal you to change you to Quicken you to transform you by the power of the Holy Spirit communion foot washing baptism three ordinances they mean more to you and they mean more to me then I think we really understand may God give us a revelation of this 1 Corinthians 11 the Apostle Paul Prophet Apostle Pastor did the work of an evangelist a great teacher he played the role of the of all five places of the fful ministry he set the New Testament Church in order he was the very scribe of the Bible he wrote almost half of the New Testament and in 1 Corinthians 11 Paul speaking to the Corinthians a very troubled group of people in verse 17 he says this now in this that I declare unto to you I praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse what what church what group of people would do that many today for first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I part believe it for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you when ye come together therefore more into one place th this is not to eat the Lord's Supper as I've instructed you but instead you're coming together just for a great religious social program time when you come together into one place he said he says you're not coming together to celebrate the Lord's Supper for then it would be a sacred moment for you then it would be a holy Union coming together this says this is not to eat the Lord's Supper though that's what you've called it in your denominations but you've turned it into a wickedness in in in into carnality verse 21 for in eating everyone taketh before others his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken verse 22 what have ye not houses to eat and drink in he is rebuking them he says what have ye not houses to eat and drink in will you turn the sacred ordinances of God into another religious social program what have ye not houses to eat and drink in or despise ye the Church of God and shame them that have not what shall I say to you shall I Praise You In This I praise you not they would say we're going to have the Lord's supper tonight and one would come and say look at my Wine's better and uh my wine is 500 years old how about yours no no a brother made it just maybe a year ago look at the bread that my wife baked doesn't it look better than yours they said well tonight at this supper I'm just going to eat my own bread you guys eat what you brought cuz mine is better than yours that's what the Corinthians were doing that's what this sacred ordinance had come to and Paul's rebuking them for it verse 22 what have ye not houses to eat and drinken or despise ye the Church of God and shame them that have not verse 22 what shall I say to you shall I Praise You In This I praise you not I will not praise you for I have received something of the Lord he says verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you and you haven't been doing it the way the order that I set for you that the Lord Jesus Paul's saying listen close that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me let's read it again after and when he had given thanks Jesus he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me the words of Jesus after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had St saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you this do ye as of as ye drink it in remembrance of me this bread and this wine the very ordinance the very act to partake of it in sincer and sincerity it's in remembrance of him that you stand before the supper thanking him for all that he's done for you it's a time of Thanksgiving when we rise up above all our complexes and say I'm going to give glory to the God who has kept me who has saved me who has cleansed me who is delivering me verse 26 for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come for as often as you eat this bread verse 26 for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come verse 26 that's 276 as until he comes into your heart into your life wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord as guilty as you as as if you would have been a Jew on that day and you shouted crucify him that's how guilty that's how unworthy to partake of it unworthily but let a man examine himself verse 28 and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drth Damnation to himself Judas partook of that supper of the bread and the wine his hand bumped the hand of Jesus as he went for the bread but he ate and drank of it unworthily and it brought damnation because he didn't discern the Lord's body he says for this cause because of partaking of these ordinances in the wrong wrong way for this cause many are weak and sickly among you for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep in other words the eyes of their understanding is blinded many are weak to live a life worthy of the Gospel many are sick with sin sickness verse 31 for if we would judge ourselves we we should not be judged in other words Lord I realized in the past I didn't realize the great significance what it means to take those steps and partake of your supper but I know now of the sacredness and you said that we should partake of it verse 32 but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one one for another If any man has the idea that if he's hungry he'll be able to eat a little tonight Paul said I'd rather you just eat at home verse 34 and if any man hunger let him eat at home the the the Lord's Supper isn't for take away your natural hunger the Lord's Supper is for you can come in remembrance of the great things God has done for you of the things he the dangers he delivered you from of the revelation he has given you oh he said partake of it happy are ye if you do these things happy are ye if you do these things has happiness been escaping you maybe you haven't been partaking and if any man hunger verse 34 let him eat at home that you come not together into unto condemnation and the rest I will set in order when I come there's more order that needs to come to the church Paul said I I don't have time just now but I'll come again in Matthew 22 and verse one this this here also was a communion supper this was a communion supper it was a celebration of a union of a man and a woman in holy matrimony listen close Matthew 22 beginning at verse one and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by Parables and said the kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son now let your thoughts go all the way back to Genesis when a king there was planning a marriage for his son to his daughter Eve to bring forth the family of God in Holiness you see how deep his thoughts run it says and sent forth his servant to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come in Genesis those who he bid and didn't come was the groom and the bride themselves and they wouldn't come they didn't come they didn't come God's provid Ed way verse four again he sent forth other servant saying tell them which are bidden behold I prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage it was going to be a great wedding supper it was going to celebrate an a union in Holiness but they made light of it verse 5 and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and entreated them sply and slew them now Jesus in a parable was speaking to Israel the church the Pharisees of not something future but it was actually a prophecy unfolding right before them what he was talking about wasn't past though had been spoken in the past and what he was talking about wasn't future as he was talking about this is what Israel was guilty of right then in that [Music] moment that day this scripture was this Parable was unfolding before Israel and the remnant he says and they made verse five and they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and entreated them sply and slew them now he's speaking of the prophets that Israel themselves had killed the prophets but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies the Philistines the amorites all the Pagan Nations and destroyed those murderers and burned up their City verse seven verse seven but when the king heard their of he was wroth and he sent for his armies and destroyed those murders and burnt up their City then said he to his servants these seven verses I've been talking to you about this wedding I've been talking to you about in a parable then in verse eight he says guess what he says the wedding is ready verse eight the wedding is ready some said well I thought you were talking about something past another said I thought you were talking about something F Future No I'm talking about the word right now in your lives the wedding is ready he said says but they which were bidden were not worthy Israel You're the fig tree with no figs on you and when I came to you you had no fruit you weren't ready I invited you to be the bride I invited you to be my wife and you've refused verse n Go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage in other words I will take this marriage to a gentile people I'll invite a people who have been living in sin I I'll invite a people who have been living on the streets I'll invite them to come to this marriage to be my wife Jesus says Oh Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved the rich like me I once was lost but now I'm found and invited not only to the wedding but to be the Bride of the groom Glory so those servants verse 10 so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guest and when the king came in to see the guest he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the king to the servants bid him bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer Darkness where there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen to partake of the bread and the wine in remembrance of the great things God has done for you and for us in the message the God of this evil age brother brandham says this she is a part of the groom the bride true to him in every Point waiting for the wedding the wedding day a uniting time not at The ecumenical council but in the sky at the wedding supper now now this is for our own church she has been given and it's been revealed to her the seven seal Mysteries of the Bible 1965 August this is for our own church she has been given and it's been revealed to her the seven seal mystery of the Bible she sees the Folly of the deceiver so very close to the truth that almost would deceive the elected she sees it he says see the two opposing Spirits at work in this evil age can you see it each is very religious Cain and Abel the spirits again coming to their heads still same as they started out it's still the same as when they started out one is worshiping by Beauty and by knowledge and by education and by science and by ethics and the other one by faith of a revelation of the word of God he was preaching in Jeffersonville Indiana and then he says to the church both both of them is standing right in this building this morning brandom Tabernacle wow he says that's right and the message doors in door he saids see but see it's like the church has to pass through the Hall of critics we we go through that you're you're going to be called a Holy Roller you're going to be called Everything But If You Could Only Hold Your Position in Christ someday he'll take us to the Hall of Fame but first we've got to stand criticism is this there is where the littleness of us stands there is where it shows he that cannot stand chastisement is an illegitimate child and not a child of God no matter how much he's joined church and whatever he's done if he cannot stand chastisement he's an illegitimate he's not a real child of God but a real genuine child of God don't care what the world says everything else is secondary he's got his mind on Christ that settles it yes whatever Christ says do whatever Christ says to do he'll do it wherever the lamb goes they're with him and then you see his appearing his presence and what he does he's always with his people his bride he is courting her someday there's going to be a wedding and a wedding supper that wedding is represented by a Rapture you see the bride of Christ is us now is us now the Bride of we are the bride of Christ already and yet we are also his wife already because the bride is his wife adorning her herself preparing her wedding dress for the wedding day but under the Jewish Traditions when a woman accepted a man's request for her to be his wife when a woman accepted the man's request to be his wife then she was then when she accepted it she was wife already and yet she was just the bride because the wedding day was still in the future but they had made a vow that could not be broken that should not be broken so now this bride this wife there's a time of preparation adorning herself preparing the wedding dress for the wedding day when when her and the bridegroom would be would would after that wedding day he would take his wife with him to live with him eternally in the heavens above a Rapture represents the wedding day when the groom takes his wife to the wedding supper and now to live together eternally St John 6:47 Jesus said in these verses we're going to read Jesus said in these verses we're going to read whoo eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood ha eternal etal life it's a serious thing to partake of this supper for it could be damnation but it also can be eternal life St John 6:47 verely verely I say unto you he that believeth on me ha everlasting life he said I am the bread of life that they broke back there in Egypt your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove amongst themselves saying how can this man give us flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood we have you have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him the partaking of this ordinance of the blood blood and of of the bread and the wine the bread unleavened bread even as his word has no leaven it's all true and the Wine Not Just fruit juice for fruit juice if you leave it out a few days it perishes it corrupts but the wine the longer it's kept the Richer it gets it never perishes it represents the blood of Jesus Christ the bread and the wine the supper it represents a testimony as the bride of Christ as Believers he says who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood verse 54 hath eternal life and I'll raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed it's the revealed word my blood is drink inde deed it's the life quickening this word to our hearts verse 56 he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him to partake of this supper is to declare publicly he dwells in me and I dwell in him I I am in in an invisible Union I am in an invisible Union with my husband the Lord Jesus Christ and I am not ashamed of this gospel or to partake of these ordinances baptize in the name of Jesus Christ is an outward expression and if and if you're sincere you know when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you came out of those Waters brother Daniel I I didn't I was happy but I didn't I didn't really feel anything that's it that's it for happy are you how are you when you do these things when you fulfill these ordinances baptism baptism if you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then it's just as important to partake of the bread and the wine because you're declaring who you are who you are Bram gave a very simple story I believe it was during the time of the Civil War and they were gathering men to go fight that they had all these young men standing up with rifles in their hands and the officer the sergeant is walking up and down making sure they all have what they need and as he's going down the line he finds a little mother with a broom in her hand standing shoulder to shoulder with all these soldiers and he comes walks up to her he says ma'am he says you can't go out there and fight with these men in the battle she says of course not sunny I just want to show you all whose side I'm on tonight we'll partake of a wedding supper and I invite you all to come and show me who side you're on tonight and this will do this sacred act this sacred ordinance this will we do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as we stand to our feet communion communion foot washing baptism three ordinances that were left to the generation of Jesus Christ to encourage ourselves to bring us to remembrance of the great things he's done for us and to testify it publicly that we're being delivered from all our shortcomings from all our transgressions from all our complexes and as we come tonight and partake and you drink of the wine and you eat the bread in your heart say say Lord I remember all the great things and all the battles you've helped me overcome you've helped me over overcome let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again for your word for your admonishment and yet the Apostle Paul said and yet I have many more things to put in order and we ask you in the coming year we ask you in the year to come we ask you in the year to come that you'll place all things in order in our little church in our lives
