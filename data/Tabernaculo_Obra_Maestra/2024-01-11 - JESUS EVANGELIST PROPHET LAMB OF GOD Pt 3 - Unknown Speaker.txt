the more to [Music] in [Music] love be in my me I see [Music] see [Music] I just wanted to uh read this scripture um you know it's amazing how the Holy Spirit forget about doing that um it's amazing how the holy spirit is you know brother Jonathan is talking about the love of God and you know I that's what's been on my heart you know except today I I was just thinking about Lord How can I how can I have more of your love you know and I was and I and I started to hear this song and I [Music] was and it talks about you know nothing's impossible with God and I I said Lord I I need more of your faith because sometimes I mean in my heart I believe that with God everything is possible but sometimes the flesh you know we all go through different things and whatnot but you know I just I was thinking thinking about just faith and how powerful faith is not just any faith but the faith of God and that faith we don't I don't think we understand how how great it is that it's so great that when a son or daughter of God God is thinking on the Lord and no matter what they're going through they believe and you know that's what that's what makes the difference you know we're Believers I want to read this scripture first and then we're going to praise the Lord and the Book of Luke it says Luke 17:5 it says and the apostles said unto the Lord increase our faith and then in the Book of Mark chapter 11 I believe it's 11 um it says uh verse 22 to 24 it says and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that what who soever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he sayth therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe see what it says there believe that you receive them and you shall have them praise [Applause] God we've sang this song many times but I believe there's something about this song at least for me when I when I start to sing this song I just I just feel God's presence and we just pray that it'll be a [Music] blessing [Music] [Applause] [Music]

[Music] is via EIC [Music] [Music] the [Music] for [Music] know a a [Music] for [Music] for [Music] Gra amen amen [Music] Gra how many know that there's times where we feel like there's nothing we have nothing left maybe like that Widow where she felt like there was nothing left well the Bible teaches that God heard her desperate cry he seen how desperate she got and heard the cry of his own for the Cry of his child for a desperate cry in her heart the worries that she had and he hears our cry this night [Music] amen there was nothing left [Music] oh just a little bit of oil that was all she had her situation looked hopeless light seemed empty the fire that she had was gone and she could no longer sustain her family a widow with nothing she was a w little with nothing that was a story with the Creditor [Music] approaching in her most desperate time of need she's still on no friends no family and they read these charges you cannot pay your G your children will become a aome and they shall be taken she cried Lord I have nothing left I'm a widow with nothing that was her testimony oh God Amen when God heard her desperate cry he came down for his own he came to her as he heard the Cry of his oil he led her to find Elijah the prophet for that hour he said go the save the Lord God had already told me your troubles will be gone the story of your life will be different from now on bring every day you can find God will transform your life the little oil you have will be scified even now right now you're CH ways and you will never be into anymore God has chosen you and your hope be the world the house that was empty now has everything the Widow who was weep can rejoice and sing where there was nothing today you can have it all step out by faith and see God multiply your Ro now your Fire's BL he Shine Your Light St you touch the head of His Garment as he passed your way all who saw you suffer at the hands of death now sees the blessings of the Lord right now right [Music] now God bless you all this evening the Widow who had nothing now has everything by Grace God once again he sweeps down and he supplies our needs sometimes we just ask him just just Supply the needs Lord but in most cases we've always we always find we always find out that he did more than just Supply the need he went above and beyond and and I believe we could all have this testimony that whatever we've asked he's always given more you can't out give the Lord the song said you you you can out give the Lord you can you can you can never give too think you've given too much to God he'll always out give you has been my experience we are thankful once again this evening and uh I want to remember our brother Joshua who's not feeling well tonight uh for a healing touch once again every time we we ask he he's always answered and he is a [Music] Healer and and I am a witness that he's a Healer more than once he's Lifted Me from a hospital bed more than once he's put food on my table more than once he supplied a job yeah of course only once he gave me a wonderful lady Karen that's only once so we're thankful for that also we're going to continue ministering tonight on this uh on this text in this theme Jesus evangelist prophet and Lamb of God if you'll turn with me to Matthew chapter 8 and we'll begin reading at verse 28 we began in Matthew 4 and the ministry of Jesus Christ he began as an evangelist praying for the sick doing Miracles healing people with diseases healing people from being demon possessed he he healing people who were vexed with a a lunatic spirit and so he began and he and and and he didn't Minister and preach much he simply said repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand but more would be added every the people needed to put a comma on that repent and those that went on to the next level they were looking for more so when he said repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand there was always a little group a little Remnant that said but is there more Matthew 8:28 and when when he was come to the other side into the country of the ganes there met him two possessed with Devils coming out of the tombs exceeding Fierce so that no man might pass by that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do Jesus thou Son of God Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time let's pray Heavenly Father may you continue to Open the Eyes of our understanding as we let our fingers do the walking through through your Bible Pages and with everything everything we read may we give you thanks and always remember to say Lord I know there's more please let me see more we ask all this in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated Matthew 28 Jesus an evangelist praying for the sick Healing The Sick the blind seen the the deaf hearing those that were crippled walking he got to a place where not only did he heal the sick not only did he rebuke devils and sicknesses uh but he got to a place where was he was in a boat with the disciples in a boat and a and a storm began to blow a storm so so [Music] Fierce that that that that even these these experienced seamen were scared these experience these experience they even they were scared of this storm but he he rose up from the ship he made like he was asleep but the Bible says that God neither sleeps nor slumbers [Music] he says and they thought he was asleep but he was testing them he says and they and they and he they called for him to rise up and he says why are you fearful oh ye of little faith then he arose and he rebuked the winds and the Sea and there was a great calm then then he arose and rebuked the wind and there was a great calm and the men marveled though they had seen him healed the sick though they had seen him give sight to the blind though they had seen him raise up those that were crippled and when they seen him speak to the storm the Bible says they marveled at him what manner of evangelist is this that even the winds and the waves of the sea obeys him then then it's in verse 28 when he said he came to the other side of the country and there he met with two possessed with Devils coming out of the tombs Fierce fears so that no man might pass by that way he said and they and when they saw him those demons recognized him most of the people weren't recognizing him they didn't really know who he was they thought he's just an evangelist doing great Miracles but when the dis IES saw him speak to the storm and the storm stopped it was like a waking up this is this is more than just an evangelist this is more than just a man that prays for the [Music] sick and is trying to lift up our faith these two demons these two men possessed with Devils the Devils recognized them immediately he said what have we to do with with thee Jesus thou Son of God they didn't have any theology they didn't have any teachings of a denomination that they didn't have a problem calling him the son of God they recognized him immediately you see you you might say well didn't he look like a common Jew he did but that's not what they saw they they saw the inner man they saw it was Jehovah God [Music] himself he said Art Thou come to torment us before the time and there was a good way off from them and heard of swine of many swine feeding verse 30 so the Devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine in other words they they they didn't know what he was going to do they just knew what he was capable of they knew he had the power to do it and they knew when God comes down walking in our midst that he's come walking for a purpose it's not a vacation it's not a time of rest he's putting footprints on the earth for a purpose they didn't know what it was they just knew that if he commanded them they had to move verse 32 and he said unto them go and when they were come out and when they went into the herd of swine and they went into the herd of swine and behold a whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep Place into the sea and perished in the waters and they that kept them fled and went their ways into the City and told everything and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils the people of the city had long known about these two men and the whole city knew of these two men that they were possessed with Devils that they couldn't pass by that way for those for those men would surely do them harm because were possessed of demon power and the and and and the people who were taking care of this herd of swne they told them the story of what had happened and verse 34 and after they heard the testimony the whole city came out to meet Jesus everybody wanted to see him but they too had a purpose once they had heard the testimony and when they saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their Coast while healing and Deliverance was free while while healing and deliverance was free that costed them nothing they welcomed it they welcomed it but once there was a a price to pay they said we can't have you in our city your marri Miracle you may have delivered two men but you know what you cost our city economy you have cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars with this miracle they were business people though they were religious but they weren't really interested in seeing God do things not if there was a price to be paid not if there was a life to be lived not if there was convictions to have in our hearts no that's too much religion for this city here that's too much religion for the City of Phoenix but yet there's Believers here in this city God has a bride a many membered body the the mystical body of Jesus Christ in verse 10 in verse n it says and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own City chap Matthew chapter 9 verse1 and behold they brought him a man sick of the py laying on a bed and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the py son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee Jesus the Evangelist was about to have a ministerial change from evangelist to Prophet verse three and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemeth and Jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk Jesus was entering Jesus was entering to the second pole the second phase of his ministry the prophetic part Discerning the thoughts and in and intents of the heart just four Jesus knowing their thoughts say where say said wherefore think he evil in your hearts verse four of Matthew 9 turn with me to Hebrews chap chapter 4 and verse 12 Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of suer of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's what the word of God is so who was this in Matthew chapter n Discerning the hearts of these men it was Jesus Jesus the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Jesus is that word he's the Living Word in verse four of Matthew 9 and Jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts he had entered he was now entering into the second pole of his ministry from evangelist to a prophet or whether is he easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk they didn't know what to say because they they would neither say thy sins are forgiven neither could they say because they didn't have the faith arise and walk to anyone he said but that you might know that the son of man ha power on Earth to forgive sins you see the son of man a prophet Ministry had begun from evangelist entering out to the prophetic Ministry going higher all the time to draw us closer all the time but he would just be drawing closer a little flock because because as as his ministry went higher as his ministry went deeper the crowds would get smaller and smaller and smaller till that day on Calvary it was as small as it had ever been and there was only one man on that day on Calvary who with his mouth stood up for him you know who it was the thief on the cross he was the last one he had nothing to lose he had everything to gain and in him was a seed of God and he rebuked the other Thief he rebuked the other Thief he said he said you ought to be ashamed of yourself you and I are here because we deserve to be here but this man has done nothing he said Lord remember me he said this day you'll be with me in Paradise verse six but that you may know that the son of man hath power on Earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the py arise take up thy bed and go into thy house and he arose and departed to his house but when the multitude saw it they marveled but this time they glorified God remember the disciples in the ship it says they marveled but it didn't say they glorified him at that time they just marveled that he could speak to the storm and the storm would obey but the multitude when they saw this they said they Marvel and glorified God which had given such power unto men and as Jesus passed from forth from thence he saw a man verse nine of Matthew named Matthew at the second poll of his ministry Jesus begins to set the church in order now this happened at the first coming but I'll also tell you this happened at the second coming that at the second poll of the ministry of a of a god-sent prophet the prophetic Ministry began setting the church in order not as an evangelist but as a prophet now just as it happened at the first coming and as he says sitting and as Jesus passed from then he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the re seat of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed [Music] him he was beginning to set the church in order a new testament church he was going to establish a new ministry the old priesthood would be annuled and God would raise up a new ministry it would be a fful Ministry but the restoration of God began with the apostolic Ministry of Apostles the rest would follow later and it came to pass as Jesus said at meet in the house Matthew 10 not verse Matthew 9:10 it came to pass that Jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples and when the Pharisees saw it they said un to his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners in other words we would never do what he's doing we would never preach the way he preaches and when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that behold need not a physician but they that are sick always speaking in Parables and in the parable lay a mystery in the parable lay a prophecy in the parable lay lay a new testament admonition verse 13 but go ye and learn what that meanthe and not sacrifice for I am not come to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance they never did understand it because it was going to require a revelation from the Holy Spirit himself to reveal these Parables then came to him the Disciples of John the men that were following the Elijah Ministry elas saying why why do we and the Pharisees fast off but thy disciples fast not why don't you do it the way we do it because that's the way we've done it for hundreds of years years why are you doing it so differently because something very different was happening upon the face of the Earth the old Covenant would be un olded the old priesthood would be aned the old ways were going to be unowned the way they raised their kids was going to be changed the way they treated their wives was going to be different it was now going to be better and greater and more righteousness and in Holiness because under the law they didn't have any of that Jesus said in verse 15 can the children of the Bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with him but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast verse 15 is a prophecy in a parable concerning Israel the Jewish people you see Jehovah God came down in flesh and he first offered to Israel to be wife to be his bride and Israel rejected Jesus said unto them can the children of the Bride chamber mourn as long long as the bridegroom is with them what he was saying is when a woman becomes a bride and and the bride under this Jewish [Music] culture she was the wife already but the bride was a wife [Music] adorning herself and preparing her her her wedding dress for that wedding day when the husband would come they would unite together and he would carry her away to live together eternally with your heavenly bridegroom no celes no Cel and Jesus said unto him can the children of the Bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them no she she will not mourn because for the bride it's a Time who is who is the wife is a time of adorning and preparation and thinking of that day he's he promised me to be his wife I am his wife and he said on such and such a time and such a day he's coming back to take me away so can the can the bride chamber mourn it's not a time of mourning as as long as the bridegroom is with him but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them on the cross of Calvary and they'll have them no more then shall they fast they'll fast throughout seven Church ages they'll they'll fast through the Dark Ages they'll fast for 2,000 years and be scattered the world over this Jewish people when one time God offered to offered them to be bride and they rejected that's why you and I are the bride today because what they rejected was given to us to be the bride of Christ so what are we as the bride what are we as the bride we are the wife we are already his wife because the bride is just his wife the bride is his wife preparing for her catching away preparing change after change after change adorning herself with the character of Jesus Christ adorning herself with a born again experience adorning herself with the baptism of the Holy Ghost adorning herself with refilling after refilling adorning herself and all of these adorning makes up her wedding dress and when her bride is fully dressed in the word the groom who has made her a promise I shall return and I'll catch you away the wedding day is the catching away when the bridegroom is now husband and the bride is now wife and he descends Catches Us away he takes us to live with him eternally then Jesus says because they didn't understand it they didn't get it they they didn't get the revelation of these Parables so he continues in another Parable he said if you didn't understand that let me say the same thing this way no man putteth a piece of new cloth into an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the Garment and the rent is made worse in other words this Old Testament these Ten Commandments all of these Proverbs on how you should conduct yourself in the Book of Leviticus Deuteronomy I'm going to add nothing to it I'm not going to put a a a a new piece of cloth on an old garment no it's just going to make everything worse I'm going to make you new again you're going to be a new creature in Christ Jesus no longer the Old Testament no longer Ten Commandments but with a revelation we'll take one of them Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and the next love thy neighbor as thyself and Jesus said on these two Commandments I hang all the law and give you a new covenant then he said he says you didn't catch that did you let me give you another Parable verse 17 he says neither do men put new wine into Old bottles else the bottles break and the and the wine run out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved here the English put down bottles but in the original Greek in Hebrew it wasn't a bottle what they used were animal skins it was skins and an old skin would get old and hard and crack so they have to discard it at some time they understood this concept but they thought it was just something natural no neither do men put new wine into Old skins else these old skins will break and the wine runneth out and the and the Skins perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved God was going to bring Revelation but he couldn't put Revelation in a man under the law it had to be a man or a woman who'd been born again that that that the soul was now a living soul because now you had broken out of your Amnesia now you've been born again now God is going to fill you with a new wine of Revelation you said but this skin of Flesh this is this is the old skin won't it Bur verse fourth it will that's the whole purpose of God now because he's provided for you a new body and the revelation will cause this whole flesh to fall away and be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye if this Earthly body Fall Away Paul said he has one already waiting for us and it's the Revelation that'll break away this Old Shell and it's already preparing for you a new body a new skin that that's that's what's holding the Revelation today it's your the offer growing within you a prophet of God said one day you'll realize that that Soul was your theophany is your theop how can it be because that soul is the seed and in that seed is everything you need not only the very nature of God but a new body already being formed you get a seed an app an apple seed and you plant it your son might say Dad you put a little seed in the ground where will the tree come from from the seeds H what about the leaves where are the leaves they're in the seeds what about the branches they're in the seed too are you going to tell me the fruits and the seed already also it's all there when God sees the seed he sees a man he sees a woman he sees a son he sees a daughter already standing in His image statures of a perfect man Christ Jesus Verse 18 while he spake these things unto them these parables behold there came a certain ruler and the first thing he did is he worshiped him then he said after he had worshiped him see how important worship is before the word comes then he said you know what my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live and Jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples so as they're going focused following this man going to go to his house they know that little girl's already dead and on their Road there to Behold a woman at verse 20 Behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood for 12 years came behind him and touched the Hem of His Garment touch Touch the Hem of His Garment not his hand not his foot Touch the Hem of His Garment for she said within herself this is why she did it this was her hope this was her faith if I may but touch His Garment I shall be whole I'll give you a little testimony very simple years ago we were in South Africa AFA and uh the pastor a very fine man going on to be with the Lord going on to be with the Lord our brother Gideon r r he had told me brother Daniel take a few extra days because when when you're done ministering and preaching I want to take you to Krueger National Park he said krer National Park it's a 3 million acre Reserve where no hunting is allowed and all the big five animals and all the African animals run wild in this Reserve and they've created roads through all this through through all of this jungle and you can drive and once you go through the main gates they tell you don't get off your cars for any reason because many people have been eaten by lions leopards killed by elephants this is a wild country African animals run wild here so as we go driving there passes of hyenas and circle around the car we keep driving more we're surrounded by baboons look like a hundred of them [Music] baboon the male baboon was almost as big as brother Leo and they're three and four and five times stronger than a man we'd pass by little ponds and and and alligators would come out of the water then we would go through another one and a hippopotamus came out a big male opened up his Jaws big and wide because we had gotten too close and we drive away some lions come by I say wow wow the brother says don't open your window to take a picture brother Daniel because in doing so have lost their lives they don't realize maybe there's a lion behind the car they open the windows and a lion has reached in and grabbed them and pulled them out I said I'm not doing that the we had seen every animal you could see all except for the AR rhino and he and he says I hope we get to I hope you get to see a a real live full-size Rhino here and I told the brother you know I'm happy with just a little Rhino so the trip went on we never saw r big or small and the brother just kids with me he says where's your faith for a big Rhino I said no no it say my faith is just in a little one I said so later that day we pulled into this reserve a private private reserve called mahaha and and there was a brother who was the who was the chief manager of this reserve and he says brother Daniel I'd like to take you behind the scenes where no visitor goes and he takes us into this enclosed all fenced area we walk into it and then he says on the other side he's about 100 feet away you see those Gates he says we're going to let a rhino come
