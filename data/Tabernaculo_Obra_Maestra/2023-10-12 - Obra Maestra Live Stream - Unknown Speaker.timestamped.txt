[51:41] Living
[51:42] God I don't know about you but I'm happy
[51:44] to be in the house of
[51:47] God it's it's cool we can go to the
[51:50] there there's fairs there's things you
[51:52] can do as a
[51:54] family
[51:56] but there's nothing like going to the
[51:58] house of
[52:00] God there's a problem when you can have
[52:03] Joys more so much more somewhere else
[52:05] than
[52:08] here oh that you can go to a to to a
[52:11] fair or you can go to a place and you
[52:13] can just have a good time
[52:17] and and get into a spirit of that that
[52:20] that
[52:24] atmosphere but how much more should we
[52:26] get in the spirit of God's
[52:29] atmosphere when it comes to worshiping
[52:31] the
[52:33] Lord or we go out there and we we we
[52:35] sure have a smile on our
[52:38] faces oh we sure are shouting we are
[52:41] sure
[52:43] happy what about in the house of the
[52:46] Lord what about coming to the house of
[52:48] the
[52:49] Lord what about hearing his
[52:53] word oh we can sit somewhere be so awake
[52:57] amen but what about in the house of the
[53:01] Lord that's just something extra I just
[53:03] feel that in my
[53:06] heart amen amen amen I believe that we
[53:09] should come to Worship the
[53:13] Lord I I believe we should come with the
[53:17] expectation amen amen right I believe in
[53:20] this last
[53:22] day because of the Revelation that we
[53:25] have
[53:26] have because a prophet came in this
[53:29] day amen amen the more Revelation that
[53:33] you
[53:34] have the more attacked you get by the
[53:38] devil he doesn't like it when you have
[53:40] more
[53:41] Revelation why because he's scared of
[53:44] Revelation because brother brandham said
[53:46] that the Gates of Hell cannot
[53:51] Prevail why because a church is built on
[53:54] Revelation
[53:56] amen he said Peter who do you say that I
[53:59] am amen what do he say thou Christ the
[54:03] son of the Living
[54:06] God Amen he said flesh and blood has not
[54:09] revealed this to
[54:11] you but my Father which are in
[54:14] heaven on this will I build my
[54:17] church amen when he said I'll build my
[54:20] church on
[54:22] that he had me and you in his thoughts
[54:27] he wanted to build us on
[54:29] that on that
[54:32] Foundation why because heaven can pass
[54:34] away Earth can pass away but God's word
[54:38] will
[54:39] never that's why he wants to build us on
[54:42] his
[54:43] word because the word won't
[54:46] move though these things happen in this
[54:50] earth though the things happen in Israel
[54:52] right
[54:54] now
[54:55] thr all the wars and wars and rumors of
[54:57] [Applause]
[54:59] wars yet when it comes to a
[55:03] Believer they're not worried about these
[55:05] things around
[55:07] them but yet the only thing that's on
[55:10] their
[55:11] mind the only thing that's in their
[55:13] heart is getting prepared to get out of
[55:17] here why because we're not staying
[55:20] here we shouldn't plan on staying here
[55:23] I'm not waiting for a big nuclear attack
[55:25] to
[55:27] happen the prophet said that the Rapture
[55:30] will happen before that
[55:33] happens so I'm not waiting for that to
[55:36] happen amen but I'm getting ready
[55:39] now because God has given us his
[55:42] word to be able to

[56:35] up and in
[56:38] Joshua the first chapter and the fifth
[56:45] verse this might be lengthy but I'll try
[56:48] to see if I can stop
[56:50] somewhere says uh now after the death of
[56:53] Moses the servant of the Lord it came to
[56:54] to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua
[56:56] the son of nun Moses ministering
[57:02] [Music]
[57:07] saying he said Moses my servant is dead
[57:10] and now therefore arise and go to the

[1:06:03] all
[1:06:06] scared everyone here is
[1:06:10] defeated the Bible says that Joshua got
[1:06:13] up early in the
[1:06:16] morning Amen in Joshua
[1:06:18] 3 verse
[1:06:21] 5 it says and Joshua said unto the
[1:06:23] people people sanctify yourselves for
[1:06:26] tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among
[1:06:33] you and Joshua spake unto the priest
[1:06:35] saying take up the Ark of the Covenant
[1:06:38] and pass over the people and they took
[1:06:40] up the Ark of the Covenant and went
[1:06:42] before the
[1:06:49] people and the Lord said unto Joshua
[1:06:52] this day will I begin to to magnify thee
[1:06:55] in the sight of
[1:07:01] Israel that they may know that as I was
[1:07:04] with Moses so I will be with
[1:07:09] thee and thou shalt command the priest
[1:07:12] that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying
[1:07:14] when ye come out to brink of the water
[1:07:17] of Jordan ye shall stand in stand still
[1:07:21] in
[1:07:22] Jordan
[1:07:32] why did the ark need to go first before
[1:07:34] the children of
[1:07:36] Israel turn me to second
[1:07:43] Samuel verse
[1:07:47] 11 the Bible says that the Ark of the
[1:07:49] Lord continued in the H House of what
[1:07:53] does that say right there obededom
[1:07:54] obededom and uh G giti three months and
[1:07:59] the Lord blessed obededom and his
[1:08:08] household and it was told to King David
[1:08:11] saying the Lord has blessed the house of
[1:08:14] obededom and all that pertaineth unto
[1:08:22] him why was his house so
[1:08:26] blessed the Bible says it was because of
[1:08:29] the Ark of the
[1:08:33] god it's because the Ark of the God was
[1:08:35] in his
[1:08:37] house that's why his house was
[1:08:41] blessed you see so David he went up and
[1:08:44] brought the Ark of God from the house of
[1:08:46] obededom into the city of David with
[1:08:52] gladness
[1:08:55] and so that's why they put the ark
[1:08:59] first that's why they wanted to Arc
[1:09:01] around the children of
[1:09:03] Israel because wherever the ark was
[1:09:06] whoever was there was
[1:09:11] blessed
[1:09:13] amen now in Joshua 3 back to Joshua
[1:09:18] 3 and
[1:09:19] 13 it says and it shall come to pass as
[1:09:22] soon as the souls of the of the priest
[1:09:25] bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all
[1:09:27] the Earth shall rest in the waters of
[1:09:29] Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall
[1:09:32] be cut off from the waters that come
[1:09:35] down above and they shall shall stand
[1:09:38] upon a
[1:09:51] heap amen and it says and and it and it
[1:09:55] and it came to pass when the people
[1:09:56] removed their tents to pass over the
[1:09:59] Jordan that the priest bearing the Ark
[1:10:00] of the Covenant before the people and as
[1:10:03] they bear the ark were come as they be
[1:10:07] the ark were come unto Jordan and the
[1:10:10] feet of the priests that bear the ark
[1:10:12] were dipped in the brim of the water for
[1:10:15] Jordan overfloweth at the banks all the
[1:10:18] time at
[1:10:22] Harvest
[1:10:38] amen so you know that bank it was must
[1:10:42] have been really
[1:10:48] overflowed you can go to Waters and when
[1:10:50] you see that it's overflowed you know
[1:10:51] it's
[1:10:52] overflowed
[1:10:58] then when the water gets too low you'll
[1:10:59] know when it when when it's overflow how
[1:11:01] high it
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:07] is and the 17 it says and the priests
[1:11:10] that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the
[1:11:11] Lord stood firm on the dry ground in the
[1:11:14] midst of the Jordan and all the
[1:11:16] Israelites passed over the dry ground
[1:11:18] until the people were passed clean over
[1:11:22] Jordan
[1:11:32] you see the Ark of God was right there
[1:11:34] and and and stayed right there until
[1:11:36] everybody got
[1:11:40] past amen so everyone that went past
[1:11:42] were
[1:11:44] blessed amen and and as soon as
[1:11:46] everybody
[1:11:47] went and they removed it that's when the
[1:11:51] water will all come back
[1:11:54] in Joshua 4 verse
[1:11:59] 21 says and he spake unto the children
[1:12:01] of Israel saying when your children
[1:12:03] shall ask their fathers in the time to
[1:12:05] come saying what mean is these
[1:12:13] Stones then ye shall let your children
[1:12:16] know saying Israel came over this Jordan
[1:12:18] on dry
[1:12:22] land
[1:12:24] amen that was a memorial for their
[1:12:27] children amen amen oh that we could
[1:12:30] leave such a memor a memorial for our
[1:12:35] children it was a memorial for their
[1:12:38] children their children's
[1:12:41] children how God
[1:12:43] himself was in their
[1:12:45] midst and that they can pass through a
[1:12:48] dry ground that was with that was
[1:12:49] overflowing with
[1:12:52] water
[1:12:54] in verse
[1:12:56] 23 it says for the Lord your God dried
[1:12:58] up the Waters of Jordan from before you
[1:13:01] until ye passed over as the Lord your
[1:13:04] God did to the Red Sea which he dried up
[1:13:07] before us until we were gone
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:19] over amen it says that all the people of
[1:13:22] the earth might know that the hand of
[1:13:24] the Lord that is mighty that ye might
[1:13:26] fear the lord your God
[1:13:35] forever amen in Joshua chapter
[1:13:39] 5 in verse
[1:13:52] 13 says and it came to pass when Joshua
[1:13:56] was by Jericho that he lifted up his
[1:13:59] eyes and looked and behold there stood a
[1:14:01] man over against him with his sword
[1:14:03] drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto
[1:14:06] him said unto him art thou for us or for
[1:14:09] our
[1:14:20] adversaries and he said nay but as a
[1:14:22] captain of the host of the Lord am I now
[1:14:25] come and Joshua fell on his face on the
[1:14:27] earth and did worship and said unto him
[1:14:30] what sayith my Lord unto his
[1:14:44] servant amen he says and the captain of
[1:14:47] the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose
[1:14:49] thy shoes from thy foot for the place
[1:14:52] whereon thy standers is holy and Joshua
[1:14:55] did
[1:15:02] so my
[1:15:05] amen he just he just looked and he seen
[1:15:08] the captain of the Lord's host with the
[1:15:10] sword pull out
[1:15:15] sword I like how brother Bram said says
[1:15:19] has his take on
[1:15:21] this he said walking along there he seen
[1:15:24] a man and a man stood with his with Drew
[1:15:26] his sword just a man looked like a
[1:15:35] man it said and Joshua perhaps being a
[1:15:38] chief Warrior Drew out his sword
[1:15:46] too walking to meet him and said who are
[1:15:49] you are you for us or are you for the
[1:15:51] our
[1:15:52] adversaries
[1:15:58] and he said the man I could see lift his
[1:16:00] sword high and say no I'm the captain of
[1:16:03] the host of the Lord the god of
[1:16:10] Israel and brother BR says that the
[1:16:12] captain of the of the host who was this
[1:16:15] captain of the
[1:16:19] host see Joshua said he reached down and
[1:16:22] un loosed in his shoes and found his
[1:16:24] face before him and said what would you
[1:16:27] what would the Lord have me
[1:16:37] do amen you see after after he was
[1:16:41] getting in in his
[1:16:44] position he was you see he was a
[1:16:46] greatest military man that there ever
[1:16:48] was on the face of the
[1:16:52] Earth
[1:16:53] there has never been a general like
[1:16:56] Joshua no time no
[1:16:59] age amen has there ever been someone
[1:17:02] compared with
[1:17:05] Joshua he said that Joshua the word
[1:17:08] Joshua means a a savior or
[1:17:14] deliverer and so we see that this man
[1:17:17] this man was a that that it was a
[1:17:20] captain in other words he was a leader
[1:17:22] of the of the host of
[1:17:30] Israel and the leader was no other no
[1:17:33] other than Christ
[1:17:36] himself and what was his what was his
[1:17:39] what was his first seen how was he first
[1:17:41] seen in the pillar of
[1:17:43] fire he said and now the pillar of fire
[1:17:46] had become a
[1:17:48] man had changed into another
[1:17:51] form he said I hope hope you know what
[1:17:53] I'm talking
[1:17:55] about he had become a
[1:17:57] man but you see he says don't be
[1:18:01] troubled he says I believe here
[1:18:04] tonight amen how how I love
[1:18:07] that that I believe that the pillar of
[1:18:09] fire is with us
[1:18:12] tonight do we believe
[1:18:15] that amen amen truly we have to ask
[1:18:18] oursel in our
[1:18:19] heart we believe that captain of the
[1:18:23] Lord's host is here
[1:18:27] tonight with his sword
[1:18:31] pulled amen he may be with a sword
[1:18:36] pulled you see uh the medical field they
[1:18:39] try to make cures for
[1:18:44] cancer but you see the Devil he's just a
[1:18:49] bluff you see brother says but when the
[1:18:52] sword of Christ comes down he will never
[1:18:54] withstand
[1:18:57] that he can't come against
[1:19:00] that he will chop through every
[1:19:04] Cancer he will CH through every Blind
[1:19:07] [Music]
[1:19:09] Eye you see I like how he says
[1:19:12] that how Joshua he seen that he said he
[1:19:14] seen the captain of the Lord's House
[1:19:16] with the sword in his
[1:19:19] [Music]

[1:19:50] tonight great Supernatural
[1:19:54] Lord Jesus Christ The Great I Am the
[1:19:59] alpha the Omega the beginning and the
[1:20:02] end amen amen but you see there is a
[1:20:05] sword in the the the Lord's
[1:20:09] hand I like how Joshua seen that there
[1:20:12] was a sword and he had it
[1:20:16] out but see at Ephesians
[1:20:20] 6:17 it says take the helmet of
[1:20:22] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:20:25] which is the word of God
[1:20:33] right see not only did not only is that
[1:20:36] sworded in Jesus's
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:39] hand but he said the things that I do
[1:20:41] you shall do
[1:20:46] also and greater things not that we
[1:20:48] would be
[1:20:50] better but that we do more
[1:20:53] so see that sword that Joshua seen in
[1:20:56] that in the the Lord's
[1:21:00] hand but the Lord is telling us
[1:21:03] here take the sword of the
[1:21:06] spirit amen what is the sword of the
[1:21:09] spirit it is the word of God take the
[1:21:13] word of God

[1:21:17] sword
[1:21:19] out he's cutting through the cancer he's
[1:21:23] cutting through the Blind
[1:21:24] Eye when he said he had his sword
[1:21:28] out amen it was a sword of the

[1:21:34] sword but it was the word of
[1:21:37] God amen
[1:21:39] amen what do you want to do
[1:21:42] then you take the word of
[1:21:44] God what is the word the Bible said here

[1:21:56] of

[1:22:16] fight
[1:22:18] with he said what does the Holy Spirit
[1:22:20] fight with
[1:22:25] Sensations
[1:22:27] feelings amen amen no no we don't fight
[1:22:31] with feelings and
[1:22:34] Sensations amen what does he fight
[1:22:39] with amen he fights with the
[1:22:43] word he doesn't fight with
[1:22:45] feelings the enemy can make you feel a
[1:22:47] lot of
[1:22:49] things he can make you feel like this
[1:22:51] brother's talking about about
[1:22:54] you that sister's talking about
[1:22:57] you and that's how he can make people
[1:23:01] feel but that's see the the Bible the
[1:23:03] Bible says we need to fight with the
[1:23:05] sword of the
[1:23:07] spirit not fight with our
[1:23:10] feelings not fight with
[1:23:12] Sensations if there's one thing we're
[1:23:14] going to fight here with
[1:23:16] tonight it's going to be the word of the
[1:23:18] Living
[1:23:20] God amen amen
[1:23:23] amen amen you see the spirit of God
[1:23:26] walks right up to the
[1:23:28] devil and say it is
[1:23:31] written just like as he did in the
[1:23:34] desert amen it is written man shall not
[1:23:38] live by bread
[1:23:40] of but by every word of
[1:23:42] God not just some things not just the
[1:23:46] ones that you like the
[1:23:48] most amen amen but all of it amen the
[1:23:53] whole word of
[1:23:54] God Amen and that's how the devil gets
[1:23:58] away amen amen that's how we can get him
[1:24:02] get him to go
[1:24:04] away see what do we do we have to take
[1:24:08] that
[1:24:09] sword amen with the hand of
[1:24:12] Faith a strong hand of
[1:24:14] Faith it's a two-edged
[1:24:16] sword the Bible said in Hebrews
[1:24:19] 4 it's a two-edged sword it cuts both
[1:24:23] coming and
[1:24:25] going amen see brother what does he
[1:24:28] do you take the word of God you take the
[1:24:33] spirit let the Spirit come into your
[1:24:35] heart open your mind and say Thy word is
[1:24:40] true amen the word is the
[1:24:44] truth you see Lord I ain't going to pay
[1:24:47] attention how I
[1:24:50] feel or what any anybody anybody else
[1:24:54] says amen or I'm not I'm not going to
[1:24:57] get mad at
[1:24:59] everything I'll get all
[1:25:01] frustrated all the doubts and and
[1:25:05] unbelief every feeling I ever
[1:25:08] had all the sicknesses I ever
[1:25:11] had everything else I ever
[1:25:14] had I'm blowing them all up out of the
[1:25:18] way amen he said I'm coming right
[1:25:22] straight to my
[1:25:25] spirit he said come
[1:25:28] down you made you made me a free moral
[1:25:33] agent you are my son all right I open my
[1:25:39] heart I'll open my mind come in Lord
[1:25:43] Jesus you see you had to grab that
[1:25:47] faith that sword of the spirit and say
[1:25:50] thus sayth the Lord
[1:25:52] amen scream out
[1:25:55] Hallelujah they cut down every enemy
[1:25:58] that's in front of
[1:26:00] you cut every enemy
[1:26:02] out that spooky
[1:26:05] Spirits oh that spooky Spirit likes to
[1:26:09] come amen
[1:26:12] amen in your
[1:26:14] health amen gets each other
[1:26:19] fighting gets it frustrated
[1:26:23] you see and what the enemy wants is is
[1:26:26] for us to think so much and dwell on the
[1:26:31] problem amen he wants us to just we we
[1:26:34] we find
[1:26:37] oursel amen just instead of going to
[1:26:40] pray really
[1:26:42] fast we get frustrated and keep keep
[1:26:44] dwelling on the
[1:26:47] problem instead of letting go and let
[1:26:50] God having
[1:26:51] it
[1:26:53] but then the enemy comes and he he comes
[1:26:55] and he comes and pours more things in
[1:26:57] pours more
[1:27:00] things but I believe that the word of
[1:27:02] God cuts through all of
[1:27:05] that that same sword that was in the the
[1:27:08] the the the the captain of the Lord's
[1:27:13] host which was Jesus Christ is that same
[1:27:17] sword that will cut through every
[1:27:18] problem you
[1:27:20] have that will cut through through every
[1:27:22] unbelief that we
[1:27:24] have amen amen it's our
[1:27:27] strength the joy of the Lord is our
[1:27:30] strength we just got to whack that demon
[1:27:33] with the
[1:27:35] word we said if it don't go away the
[1:27:38] first
[1:27:39] time you whack him again you whack him
[1:27:43] again and you whack him
[1:27:45] again what if you still don't want to go
[1:27:48] away you keep whacking him amen amen and
[1:27:52] he goes and you say Glory Hallelujah Glu
[1:27:55] where's the next
[1:27:57] one oh when you go through a sickness in
[1:27:59] a
[1:28:01] problem who wants to go to the next
[1:28:04] one you're like almost within yourself
[1:28:07] say I just need a
[1:28:10] break let me just get a
[1:28:13] week a week just just everything
[1:28:17] perfect but see the Bible says that a
[1:28:19] Christian Life is
[1:28:21] longsuffering
[1:28:26] amen
[1:28:28] amen it's like that song said he never
[1:28:31] promised that cross would not get
[1:28:36] heavy he didn't offer any
[1:28:40] Victory without
[1:28:42] fighting but he did say help will come
[1:28:44] in
[1:28:46] time
[1:28:48] amen amen you see we got to knock every
[1:28:50] enemy out
[1:28:55] amen the Bible says in Exodus
[1:29:04] 23:22 it
[1:29:06] says it says uh but if Thou shalt indeed
[1:29:09] obey his voice and do all that I speak
[1:29:12] then will I will be an enemy unto thine
[1:29:16] enemies and adversary unto thy
[1:29:20] adversar
[1:29:25] amen amen he says for my angel shall go
[1:29:29] before thee and bring thee unto the am
[1:29:33] amorites and thees hites and the parites
[1:29:37] parasites and the Canaanites and thees
[1:29:40] hites and the jeites jebusites and I
[1:29:43] will cut them
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:50] off
[1:29:54] oh I like that the Lord says if you obey
[1:29:56] my
[1:29:57] voice I will be an enemy to your
[1:30:01] enemies I will be an adversary to your
[1:30:05] adversar not only that I will cut them
[1:30:08] off amen I tell you what there's an
[1:30:11] enemy we have here
[1:30:15] tonight it's Satan in his
[1:30:18] army but the Bible says if you obey his
[1:30:22] voice your enemy will be his
[1:30:26] enemy and that your adversary will be
[1:30:29] his
[1:30:30] adversary amen you see the devil's a
[1:30:33] good
[1:30:35] adversary amen amen but he ain't
[1:30:38] stronger than
[1:30:39] God amen amen why because the Bible says
[1:30:43] I will cut them
[1:30:46] off didn't say I might cut him
[1:30:49] off maybe I'll cut him off
[1:30:52] no but the promise right here say I will
[1:30:55] cut them
[1:30:57] off amen I got some things I want to cut
[1:31:00] off right
[1:31:02] now I don't know about you if you got
[1:31:05] things you want to cut
[1:31:08] off I got things I want to cut
[1:31:11] off amen amen but if we just take him at
[1:31:16] his
[1:31:17] word the word is sharper than a
[1:31:19] two-edged sword
[1:31:24] he said if we obey his
[1:31:27] word then those things that we need cut
[1:31:32] off he promised he would cut them
[1:31:35] off amen amen amen just like like
[1:31:41] David amen what a remember that time
[1:31:44] when when Goliath
[1:31:47] comes amen and he sees and he and he and
[1:31:50] he sees sa and all the the the
[1:31:54] army man all
[1:31:57] Israel and he sees that they're they're
[1:32:00] afraid amen and he told them that uh
[1:32:03] aren't you guys Servants of
[1:32:06] sa you see the reason why he said
[1:32:09] that because he seen that they're
[1:32:11] following a
[1:32:13] man amen amen like I said before if if
[1:32:17] if they had been following something
[1:32:19] they believed
[1:32:20] in
[1:32:23] they would have been willing to die for
[1:32:26] that and see Goliath he was a champion
[1:32:29] they
[1:32:30] said the Bible says he was a
[1:32:33] champion so he can tell when someone was
[1:32:37] afraid and when he seen fear in all
[1:32:39] their
[1:32:41] faces he's like oh they're not fighting
[1:32:43] for what they
[1:32:46] believe they're saying they
[1:32:48] believe but they're not fighting so he
[1:32:52] goes and he calls him
[1:32:54] out but no one wanted to go out and you
[1:32:57] see David come
[1:32:59] along he was only supposed to bring food
[1:33:01] to his
[1:33:04] brothers and Goliath got on the
[1:33:07] way you see he was just going he was
[1:33:09] going to bring food to his
[1:33:12] brothers and see that's when Goliath
[1:33:14] came and and and and made his big boast
[1:33:19] again which one of you is going to come
[1:33:21] and fight
[1:33:23] me amen he he was looking at their faces
[1:33:26] and seeing oh they're all
[1:33:28] scared oh but then he saw one he was
[1:33:32] little he comes out I can see that these
[1:33:36] men are all taller than
[1:33:38] him and David comes out he's all like
[1:33:41] you know
[1:33:42] what like get get get out of my
[1:33:46] way comes right
[1:33:48] out amen amen he says you mean to tell
[1:33:51] me you'll let this man defile the armies
[1:33:53] of
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:57] God he said I'll go fight
[1:34:01] him oh Saul said oh you're going to need
[1:34:03] my
[1:34:05] helmet you're going to need my
[1:34:08] shield you need my
[1:34:11] armor but David started I can't move in
[1:34:15] this it's too big but you see uh that
[1:34:19] doctor in that SA
[1:34:23] in it didn't work for
[1:34:25] David David was feeding on something
[1:34:30] else and that very thing he was feeding
[1:34:33] on was God's
[1:34:35] word amen and he had an
[1:34:38] experience so he didn't need all those
[1:34:41] other
[1:34:42] things he didn't need someone else's
[1:34:46] unbelief amen amen why because he knew
[1:34:49] his defense was the Lord
[1:34:52] and what happened if sa and Goliath and
[1:34:55] everybody there would have looked with
[1:34:56] their spiritual
[1:35:00] eyes amen amen they would have seen what
[1:35:03] Joshua
[1:35:04] saw they would have seen the C of Lord's
[1:35:07] host with the sword out his
[1:35:12] hand right there going with his servant
[1:35:15] David amen and what happened he got some
[1:35:20] stones
[1:35:22] and he slayed that that giant that
[1:35:24] everybody else saw that was a
[1:35:28] giant not not to David though he's seen
[1:35:31] it like it was a piece of
[1:35:34] cake amen he's seen it as a
[1:35:38] victory amen that didn't come to David
[1:35:41] that
[1:35:42] way amen because he knew that the Lord
[1:35:44] was with
[1:35:46] him amen because what did he
[1:35:48] say that Goliath says I come I come with
[1:35:52] the
[1:35:54] sword
[1:35:55] amen and then here comes a captain of
[1:35:57] The Lord of host
[1:36:00] Jesus tell tell him who you come
[1:36:03] by he said I come to you in the name of
[1:36:06] the
[1:36:07] Lord amen amen you see it then he went
[1:36:11] straight up to
[1:36:13] Goliath and he cut his head off it's
[1:36:16] pretty graphic but that's what happened
[1:36:18] the Bible says
[1:36:20] that it's like
[1:36:22] shamard they will steal his food every
[1:36:26] year I worked in the fields with my
[1:36:32] brother-in-law when you get mud that's
[1:36:34] blocking the way that the water is
[1:36:35] supposed to
[1:36:40] go all the work that you have to do to
[1:36:42] just get that mud out of the
[1:36:45] way and that's not even it they have to
[1:36:48] do everything
[1:36:50] else amen but when I went with him in
[1:36:52] that
[1:36:53] time it was difficult amen I wasn't used
[1:36:57] to
[1:36:58] it so Shamar he dealt with all of
[1:37:03] that having to prepare his Fields all
[1:37:05] the
[1:37:07] time have to take time water
[1:37:11] it fertilize it get it
[1:37:14] ready amen and then every year they
[1:37:17] would come and take
[1:37:19] it amen
[1:37:22] you see Shar got tired of
[1:37:26] it he got tired of
[1:37:29] losing he got tired of being
[1:37:32] defeated and I believe that's what we
[1:37:35] need to
[1:37:36] be we have to be tired of
[1:37:39] losing tired of being
[1:37:42] defeated he prayed to the Lord every
[1:37:44] year
[1:37:46] say protect me this year you see and
[1:37:49] it's good to wait on the Lord
[1:37:52] but see there's times the Lord is
[1:37:53] waiting on you to go into
[1:37:56] action and that's what he was waiting
[1:37:58] for shamard to get into
[1:38:01] action see Samar started to realize I'm
[1:38:03] an
[1:38:06] Israelite God is my God and there goes
[1:38:09] the lord of the captain of the host
[1:38:11] again
[1:38:14] Jesus sword his
[1:38:17] hand every swung that shangar took
[1:38:27] amen you could just see the Lord hitting
[1:38:29] them with
[1:38:31] them
[1:38:32] amen he gave Shamar the
[1:38:37] strength and
[1:38:39] Peter Peter was a changed
[1:38:42] man let me tell you they thought they
[1:38:45] had Peter defeated when they were going
[1:38:46] to crucify
[1:38:50] him
[1:38:51] people many people probably knew Peter
[1:38:54] wanting to cut the head off of a
[1:38:59] Roman cuz you know when he was going to
[1:39:01] cut when he cut the ear on the
[1:39:04] Roman really he was trying to cut the
[1:39:07] head off of the
[1:39:09] Roman so people that that I have to know
[1:39:12] that was a rumor going
[1:39:15] around something like that just don't H
[1:39:19] just just don't happen and it just goes
[1:39:22] away it's like as that happened in our
[1:39:26] day the whole entire Phoenix knows about
[1:39:29] it so in that time everybody knew about
[1:39:32] it when they see him coming
[1:39:35] again when they're getting ready to
[1:39:37] crucify
[1:39:38] him oh this is the same Peter that
[1:39:40] denied him three
[1:39:42] times oh this is the same Peter that
[1:39:44] almost cut someone's head
[1:39:47] off but you see Peter he didn't have the
[1:39:50] same the same
[1:39:51] the same attitude no
[1:39:53] more Peter said put me upside down I
[1:39:56] ain't worthy like he
[1:40:01] is he didn't say stop it stop it no I
[1:40:04] don't believe in what you claim me to
[1:40:05] believe
[1:40:09] in but something happened to
[1:40:12] Peter you see Peter he was very
[1:40:17] encouraged am man he had a lot of
[1:40:19] Courage you know courage it
[1:40:23] takes Amen to be able to go go to a
[1:40:28] place where they're going to crucify
[1:40:30] you amen and just say don't don't no no
[1:40:34] don't thing I ask don't crucify me like
[1:40:39] that if you guys G to crucify me do it
[1:40:41] upside
[1:40:43] down amen amen you see how his attitude
[1:40:47] changed and Paul he said I fight the
[1:40:50] good good
[1:40:52] fight I finished my
[1:40:57] course I kept my faith you see how he
[1:41:00] can look at that
[1:41:02] grave and say oh death where is I
[1:41:06] sting oh grave where is thy
[1:41:09] Victory amen see the grave said I'll

[1:41:21] you the worms will eat you
[1:41:24] up the bones will turn you into
[1:41:28] dust but Paul said look at that empty
[1:41:31] tube out

[1:41:36] him amen he said I'm in him and I'll
[1:41:40] rise on that morning and receive that
[1:41:46] crown that the Lord the righteous judge
[1:41:48] will give
[1:41:49] me
[1:41:51] amen amen he wasn't scared of the
[1:41:55] Grave he wasn't scared of
[1:41:58] death amen but he says grave where is
[1:42:00] your
[1:42:03] sting death where is your
[1:42:06] Victory amen see he was encouraged in
[1:42:09] his
[1:42:10] heart he knew inside of his
[1:42:13] heart amen that if that when he leaves
[1:42:17] this
[1:42:18] life he's only changing bodies

[1:55:18] for
[1:55:20] I like what brother Jonathan said
[1:55:25] that for us to be strong
[1:55:29] and be strong and of good courage you
[1:55:33] know
[1:55:37] I I remember years ago I was going
[1:55:39] through something and and I was
[1:55:43] um
[1:55:44] [Music]
[1:55:48] um I was struggling through something
[1:55:51] and I remember the lord gave me a
[1:55:56] song and the name of the song that he
[1:55:59] gave me was called be strong and of good
[1:56:04] courage
[1:56:07] um and I I I looked up that I for some
[1:56:11] reason it came on my phone and the the
[1:56:14] Bible says that that verse that to be
[1:56:17] strong to be not afraid to be strong and
[1:56:20] encourage it's written in the
[1:56:23] Bible 365
[1:56:25] [Music]
[1:56:31] times I wasn't looking for
[1:56:34] it but the
[1:56:36] Lord somehow or another I looked on my
[1:56:39] phone and it was
[1:56:40] [Music]
[1:56:42] there so it was telling me that every
[1:56:48] day be strong and of good
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:52] courage that's what that's what the Lord
[1:56:54] was trying to tell me and
[1:56:58] uh and and and I believe it with all my
[1:57:03] heart God doesn't want us to he he wants
[1:57:06] us to to be strong in his
[1:57:09] word him his
[1:57:11] word strong
[1:57:14] us the holy spirit in US be strong in
[1:57:18] his word taking his
[1:57:21] word no matter
[1:57:23] what that's where he wants us to be
[1:57:28] strong God bless our brother
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:37] jonath let's sing that that song
[1:57:40] [Music]
[1:57:46] um know everything that we go through no
[1:57:49] matter what what we go through if we're
[1:57:51] just if we'll just be persistent with
[1:57:54] the Lord and and no matter what we go
[1:57:56] through the lord always lifts us back up
[1:57:59] we might we might fall and we fall we do
[1:58:03] we might get discouraged but he always
[1:58:05] brings us back up I praise God for that
[1:58:09] because there's been many times where
[1:58:11] I've been
[1:58:13] discouraged but he always lifts me
[1:58:16] up that's why I can count on his word
[1:58:18] because I know his word is
