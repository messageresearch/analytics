[38:49] all our praise
[38:57] grateful to be here
[39:01] among Saints of like Precious faith
[39:05] so
[39:11] we'd like this morning once again
[39:12] continuing and begin reading there in
[39:17] Revelations chapter one
[39:20] Mr manana and
[39:24] verse one
[39:28] foreign
[39:31] The Book of Revelations
[39:33] it's the it's the whole book in symbols
[39:38] but it's it's the whole book of uh of a
[39:42] new
[39:44] testamento it's the it's a whole book of
[39:47] a divine plan of God
[39:50] to save us to restore us to take us back
[39:56] to Eden
[39:59] of course the Old Testament spoke of it
[40:02] also
[40:06] had many of these things written within
[40:09] the pages
[40:13] but it was written in in the allegories
[40:17] It Was Written In in metaphors
[40:22] and the lives of the Old Testament
[40:24] Patriarchs
[40:27] and the lives and the
[40:32] of the Old Testament Patriarchs
[40:38] they they were actually living out a
[40:41] part of this you can see
[40:43] they didn't realize it
[40:47] and and we didn't realize it
[40:51] until God sent a prophet in this 20th
[40:54] century
[40:57] and begin to point out the the small
[41:00] details
[41:04] and can and what those times and the
[41:07] lives of these Old Testament Patriarchs
[41:09] represented
[41:14] and he spoke to us of the life of Joseph
[41:18] which was also he said a type of Christ
[41:23] he was loved of his father
[41:26] and hated of his Brethren
[41:29] it was representing the life of Jesus
[41:33] who his Brethren the Jewish Community
[41:38] they would hate him but the father loved
[41:42] him
[41:43] and his life continued to to unfold
[41:51] showing forth the Life of Christ
[41:54] and as many times as a child as I read
[41:57] it
[42:01] and my mother would read it to me
[42:05] we thought it was just a story
[42:08] of a man that lived thousands of years
[42:11] ago
[42:13] but it was really the story
[42:16] of a man that would actually come and
[42:18] live in us
[42:22] it was the story of Jesus Christ
[42:26] he was falsely accused
[42:30] he was he was he was sold by his
[42:33] Brethren bendito for a few pieces of
[42:36] silver
[42:39] he was falsely accused and put in prison
[42:41] foreign
[42:44] but there in in the time that he was in
[42:46] prison
[42:49] the prison was blessed
[42:52] the prisoners were blessed
[42:56] the the man in charge of the prison was
[42:59] blessed
[43:01] because he was represented the Prince of
[43:04] Peace
[43:19] and and one was the one that served wine
[43:22] to the pharaoh of Egypt
[43:26] they too were in this prison
[43:29] they had dreams
[43:32] in the dreams he told one of them he
[43:36] would he would he would again again be
[43:38] restored
[43:41] to the right hand of pharaoh
[43:43] but he told the other one he says your
[43:47] dream represents
[43:49] and you'll be lost
[43:52] you'll be put to death
[43:57] it represented two thieves on the cross
[44:01] one would
[44:03] be given life
[44:06] one would be given death
[44:08] oh the simple details but the details
[44:15] that's why a prophet said if you read
[44:17] your Bible
[44:19] and you can't see Christ
[44:22] go back and read that part again
[44:26] because this entire Bible
[44:30] from Genesis to Revelations
[44:33] it's all about the revelation of Jesus
[44:36] Christ
[44:39] oh you need a revelation of the
[44:42] messenger for your day
[44:45] you need a revelation to be able to know
[44:48] if the man's a prophet or not
[44:52] but if he is
[44:55] that's all he is
[44:57] he's God's Prophet he's God's Pastor
[45:02] he's God's Apostle he's God's evangelist
[45:07] but it's none of us were God made flesh
[45:22] but not just for the prophet himself
[45:27] but you and I
[45:30] God in US Open the hope of glory
[45:34] but there's only one man
[45:37] the diet and the cross for us
[45:40] and rose again
[45:43] and it's the revelation of him
[45:46] that will bring us salvation
[45:49] and when you can have a revelation of
[45:52] Jesus Christ
[45:55] then by Revelation you can see who his
[45:59] Faithful Servants are Revelations
[46:08] and appreciate whom God sends
[46:12] to to help you
[46:15] look through the details in the
[46:18] scriptures
[46:20] and catch the revelation
[46:25] for we don't follow a man
[46:28] we follow the lamb
[46:30] and the only man we follow
[46:34] is the man Christ Jesus Christ but with
[46:38] a revelation of Jesus Christ
[46:42] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[46:46] you learn to appreciate
[46:50] your brothers and sisters
[46:52] in Christ
[46:55] regardless of whatever title they might
[46:57] have
[47:01] you simply appreciate the body of Christ
[47:07] from the prophet to the janitor
[47:14] because you have a revelation
[47:17] of Jesus Christ
[47:19] who your lord and savior is
[47:22] Salvador is
[47:25] and you just start treating everybody
[47:28] the same
[47:30] with the love of God in your heart
[47:33] Revelations chapter 1 and verse one
[47:37] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[47:41] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[47:44] things which will shortly come to pass
[47:45] and he sent and signified it by his
[47:48] Angel unto his servant John revelation
[48:02] who bear record of the word of God and
[48:05] of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[48:08] all things that he saw
[48:17] blessed is he that readeth
[48:20] and they that hear the words of this
[48:22] prophecy and keep those things which are
[48:24] written therein for the time is at hand
[48:29] [Music]
[48:33] there's
[48:35] no blessing for not reading
[48:40] no there is only a blessing for reading
[48:44] and there's no blessing for for not
[48:48] hearing
[48:50] there's only a blessing for hearing
[48:54] and there's blessings for hearing the
[48:57] words of this prophecy
[49:01] everything else you might hear
[49:06] doesn't carry a blessing of
[49:11] eternal life so then we got to consider
[49:14] what we're hearing
[49:16] and how much we're hearing of all the
[49:19] different things we do here
[49:30] some we have to say I'm going to hear
[49:33] this lesson
[49:38] until we finally get to the word of God
[49:42] and with the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:47] you'll have to say I need to hear this
[49:49] the most
[49:54] I need to read this the most
[49:58] because this is where the blessings of
[50:01] eternal life lay okay
[50:04] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[50:08] once again this morning
[50:10] and we truly ask your blessings
[50:14] we come as worshipers first of all
[50:21] and and pray that you have received our
[50:24] worship and praise from our hearts
[50:29] and if you have
[50:32] then come and speak something to every
[50:34] heart
[50:36] [Music]
[50:38] something to encourage us
[50:41] to keep pressing on
[50:45] following the lamb
[50:47] and this we ask in the name of the Lord
[50:51] Jesus Christ
[50:53] amen amen you may be seated
[50:57] we'd been speaking on this first chapter
[51:02] in the first chapter of Revelations
[51:05] is lifting up Jesus Christ
[51:09] King of Kings Lord of lords
[51:13] the great high priest
[51:19] it's tell it told us in here how that
[51:21] how he would return
[51:24] at his second Communists and it says in
[51:28] verse seven
[51:29] it said behold he cometh with clouds
[51:33] and throughout the years and the
[51:35] hundreds of years
[51:37] people have tried to discern what that
[51:40] meant
[51:43] and most of the time they take it
[51:46] literally
[51:47] so they were they're actually waiting
[51:50] for him to come in clouds
[51:55] clouds that bring rain water
[52:00] clouds that give us shade naturally
[52:05] but when he cometh when these clouds
[52:10] it says every eye shall see him
[52:14] now as you know
[52:17] if you're watching and looking at a
[52:19] cloud
[52:21] straight up from this from from Phoenix
[52:24] Arizona
[52:27] there's no way the brothers in Congo
[52:29] Africa can see the same clouds
[52:34] but when it comes in these clouds at his
[52:38] at his second coming it's at every I
[52:41] would see
[52:43] so now we realize
[52:45] by the witness can the testimony of a
[52:49] prophetic Ministry is
[52:55] that these clouds were not natural
[52:58] clouds
[53:00] that this part of the Book of
[53:03] Revelations
[53:05] is like every part of the Book of
[53:07] Revelations
[53:10] it's a symbol these clouds here that
[53:14] it's speaking of it is
[53:17] that every eye would see him
[53:20] so he says behold he cometh with clouds
[53:25] and every eye shall see him
[53:28] now now it's calling the clouds him
[53:33] now it's calling the clouds him
[53:38] so this clouds were exactly what we call
[53:41] a revelation of today
[53:46] these clouds were seven angels
[53:49] and these clouds were there were taking
[53:52] a picture in the Life Magazine
[53:59] okay and and this magazine went around
[54:02] the world
[54:06] and every eye saw this Cloud
[54:09] but it wasn't a cloud
[54:12] it wasn't a mystery it was a mysterious
[54:15] Cloud
[54:16] because there were seven angels and when
[54:20] you turned that picture of that cloud
[54:23] and you turn it to the right
[54:27] who do you see okay look away we see him
[54:31] this was written in prophecy
[54:35] about 80 90.
[54:37] [Music]
[54:43] and in 1963
[54:46] over 1900 years later
[54:50] this prophecy is fulfilled in scripture
[54:56] this now is history for us
[54:59] when John saw it in a vision he saw it
[55:05] coming he said behold he comes with
[55:09] clouds
[55:11] how does he come with clouds
[55:14] he was one of those angels
[55:18] he was the one that was most notable
[55:22] he was the one with the swept back wings
[55:30] he was in the
[55:33] photography he came down with this cloud
[55:36] of Angels
[55:40] In This Cloud he was the same one that
[55:43] spoke to Moses
[55:45] In This Cloud he was the same one that
[55:48] spoke to to to Paul on the road to
[55:51] Damascus
[55:54] In This Cloud he's the same one that
[55:57] spoke to a 20th century Prophet is
[56:02] verse 7 was prophecy
[56:28] so now we have a date for verse seven
[56:32] that it was 1963.
[56:37] in Life magazine
[56:40] in the in the March issue
[56:49] This Cloud
[56:52] was shown
[56:54] no more prophecy
[56:57] but verse 7 become history
[57:01] in 1963. when seven angels came down
[57:07] and every eye saw it
[57:10] because Life Magazine was an
[57:12] International magazine
[57:17] and it went it would go to every country
[57:20] in the world
[57:22] and every eye saw him
[57:26] but they didn't know what there was him
[57:29] we know it's him
[57:31] a little flock knows it's him
[57:36] Believers know it's him
[57:39] and Believers are still seeking him
[57:43] behold he cometh with clouds
[57:47] in 1963
[57:50] and every eye saw him
[57:53] and they also which
[58:01] um
[58:04] and they also which pierced him
[58:09] Israel the Jewish people
[58:13] and all kindreds of the Earth shall wail
[58:15] because of him
[58:20] a future prophecy
[58:22] at the end time
[58:25] then he says I'm Alpha and Omega the
[58:27] beginning and the ending
[58:32] who was the alpha omega
[58:34] this one he that came with these clouds
[58:39] he that was the seventh angel in this
[58:42] constellation
[58:44] he is
[58:47] the beginning and the end
[58:49] saith the Lord which is which was which
[58:53] is to come
[58:57] the Almighty
[59:00] then verse 9. then John begins to
[59:04] declare and give his own testimony
[59:08] he says I'm your brother
[59:11] I'm your companion and tribulation
[59:15] and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[59:18] Christ
[59:20] I'm your brother in Christ I'm just like
[59:23] you are
[59:25] but but I've been called
[59:28] to be placed on this on this island
[59:31] called Patmos
[59:34] and I was placed here for the word of
[59:36] God yes
[59:39] and I realized that I was placed on this
[59:42] deserted island for the testimony of
[59:44] Jesus Christ
[59:48] for the life I was living
[59:51] and and for wanting to put all the
[59:54] writings of the Apostles in a book okay
[59:59] and and I was placed here
[1:00:02] because I was trying to put all the
[1:00:05] writings of the new
[1:00:07] testamentos
[1:00:10] so that all the world could have it
[1:00:14] for they could have the plan of God
[1:00:17] the Plan of Salvation
[1:00:20] so they could have the plan of how to
[1:00:23] how to go on to perfection
[1:00:28] so they could understand that when it
[1:00:31] comes to Perfection
[1:00:32] that we all begin at the same place
[1:00:36] and that is blessed are the porn spirit
[1:00:39] amen
[1:00:42] in other words when it comes to
[1:00:44] Perfection
[1:00:45] we all started in the same spot
[1:00:49] born in sin
[1:00:51] shaped in iniquity come into this world
[1:00:55] speaking lies
[1:00:57] oh but it's the soul that's in you
[1:01:01] it is a child of God
[1:01:04] then you're ordained to come into
[1:01:06] perfection
[1:01:15] John in verse 10 says
[1:01:19] the Visions had begun
[1:01:22] he had been he broke into another
[1:01:24] dimension
[1:01:27] he was he was now unconscious that he's
[1:01:30] sitting on a rock
[1:01:32] there they're next to the ocean
[1:01:37] in an island called Patmos
[1:01:40] because now he's entered into the spirit
[1:01:43] now he's catching Visions
[1:01:46] it's just like you and I when we come to
[1:01:48] church
[1:01:50] we can also get lost in the spirit
[1:01:53] we can also come here and
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:27] as a trumpet to me
[1:02:31] and he was speaking to me of his of the
[1:02:33] deity of Christ
[1:02:36] and I understood that he's Alpha he's
[1:02:39] Omega
[1:02:40] I understood he was he's the first he's
[1:02:43] the last
[1:02:45] I understood that what I was looking at
[1:02:48] the writings in the book
[1:02:50] is
[1:02:52] something that God ordained
[1:02:55] it's something that God sent to me
[1:03:00] you see you got to make it personal
[1:03:04] John said I said John said he heard a
[1:03:07] voice of a Greek trumpet
[1:03:09] verse 10.
[1:03:16] saying I'm Alpha and Omega
[1:03:20] the first and the last
[1:03:22] and what thou see is
[1:03:28] verse 11 can what thou see is write in a
[1:03:32] book
[1:03:33] they say
[1:03:48] send it unto Kenny send it to Jonathan
[1:03:51] send it to Leo
[1:03:54] send the two Ismail I smile
[1:03:58] send it to my children
[1:04:01] send it to a little flock through seven
[1:04:04] Church ages
[1:04:06] send it to the Saints and Ephesus
[1:04:11] all the seven Church ages send it to the
[1:04:15] Believers
[1:04:18] but God makes it personal
[1:04:21] because God wants you to understand
[1:04:24] that if you get in the spirit
[1:04:27] that is sent it directly to you
[1:04:32] then John says in verse 12.
[1:04:36] I turn to see the voice that spoke with
[1:04:39] me
[1:04:41] I'm being turned I saw seven golden
[1:04:45] candlesticks
[1:04:48] and in the midst of the seven
[1:04:50] candlesticks
[1:04:52] one like unto the son of man
[1:04:56] what John meant
[1:04:59] is that this man that I saw
[1:05:03] was like unto Jesus of Nazareth yes
[1:05:10] it looked like him
[1:05:12] but he was clothed with the Garment to
[1:05:15] the foot
[1:05:17] verse 13.
[1:05:20] listen
[1:05:22] um
[1:05:25] and gird about the paps with a golden
[1:05:27] girdle foreign
[1:05:36] but he was dressed differently
[1:05:40] and his hair wasn't what what wasn't
[1:05:43] dark hair like it used to be is
[1:05:46] his head and his hairs were a white like
[1:05:52] Woolen as white as snow
[1:05:55] and his eyes were a flame of fire
[1:05:59] and his feet like into fine brass
[1:06:04] they burned in a furnace
[1:06:07] and his voice is the sound of many
[1:06:10] Waters
[1:06:12] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[1:06:16] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[1:06:18] two-edged sword
[1:06:20] and his countenance was the sun shineth
[1:06:23] in his strength
[1:06:27] it was Jesus but John had never seen him
[1:06:31] dressed and looking this way
[1:06:35] because now he was dressed as a judge
[1:06:41] now he was dressed as Supreme deity
[1:06:48] to judge the whole world
[1:06:51] now he was now he was going to be moving
[1:06:55] throughout seven Church ages
[1:06:58] in the form of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:01] where he could speak and talk
[1:07:05] so he could speak and talk
[1:07:10] and speak to his people
[1:07:12] lip to ear
[1:07:15] and everyone could have a personal
[1:07:17] relationship
[1:07:21] with the son of man
[1:07:26] in verse 18.
[1:07:28] verse 17. and when I saw him I fell at
[1:07:32] his feet as dead
[1:07:34] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:07:36] saying unto me fear not I'm the first
[1:07:38] and the last piece
[1:07:52] this Jesus of Nazareth
[1:07:55] was the same God that sat on the throne
[1:08:00] it was this is the same Creator this is
[1:08:05] the created heavens and earth
[1:08:08] the same one that said let there be
[1:08:10] light
[1:08:12] the same the same one that made Adam in
[1:08:16] His image and likeness
[1:08:22] this same God
[1:08:24] became the second Adam
[1:08:27] and here
[1:08:29] he's the great Holy Spirit now
[1:08:32] he's going to be moving
[1:08:35] in the midst of these seven churches
[1:08:41] and in these seven churches
[1:08:46] they actually existed in the days of
[1:08:49] Jesus
[1:08:50] in the day in the days of the Apostle
[1:08:53] Paul and John apostle Paul some of these
[1:08:57] places still exist today
[1:09:00] they're outside of Israel in a place
[1:09:03] called Asia Minor is
[1:09:07] they they they they were literal places
[1:09:12] and churches and groups of Believers
[1:09:16] but they were really used here
[1:09:18] symbolically
[1:09:21] they were also representing
[1:09:24] the Bride of Jesus Christ a gentile
[1:09:28] people
[1:09:29] whom God by the Holy Spirit
[1:09:33] would be moving amongst his people
[1:09:37] amongst throughout seven Church ages
[1:09:41] today for over 2 000 years
[1:09:45] the Holy Spirit
[1:09:48] moving and there's been a remnant of
[1:09:51] believers
[1:09:55] so the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:58] is not just us here in the time of
[1:10:01] laodicea no no no
[1:10:04] the Bride of Jesus Christ is made up of
[1:10:08] all the Believers
[1:10:10] from the days of Jesus from the days of
[1:10:14] John the Baptist
[1:10:17] when the message of the hour began began
[1:10:22] to be preached
[1:10:23] and John began that message
[1:10:26] with the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[1:10:31] it was the first coming of Christ
[1:10:34] it was his it was the first coming of
[1:10:37] Elijah
[1:10:39] it was the opening of the first seal
[1:10:44] the opening of this first seal
[1:10:47] it is the first coming of Christ
[1:10:50] and the white horse rider yeah
[1:10:54] and the white horse rider
[1:10:56] Blanco began in the days of John the
[1:11:00] Baptist
[1:11:01] oh you can read it in the Bible
[1:11:04] in Matthew 11. when Jesus said
[1:11:08] that in the days of John
[1:11:11] is when this white horse rider begin to
[1:11:14] ride
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:17] and the plan of God of Salvation
[1:11:21] and to restore his family
[1:11:25] back into his presence
[1:11:28] it had begun
[1:11:31] but the white horse rider began writing
[1:11:36] because the lion had began
[1:11:42] had brought the message of Salvation
[1:11:47] and of change to Israel for Israel
[1:11:53] because it was the opening
[1:11:56] of the first seal because it was the
[1:12:00] opening of part one part
[1:12:04] one of God bringing
[1:12:09] Gathering back his family
[1:12:12] you see do you see the first coming of
[1:12:15] Christ
[1:12:18] it began the Gathering time
[1:12:23] you say how do we know that because
[1:12:26] Jesus said to Israel
[1:12:35] as a hand gathers her brood
[1:12:40] s
[1:12:42] so I've tried to gather you
[1:12:45] so the opening of the first seal
[1:12:49] part one of restoration and salvation
[1:12:54] was God coming to gather his children
[1:13:00] back into his presence
[1:13:04] like he had tried to gather Adam and Eve
[1:13:09] and they fell from his from his presence
[1:13:12] because they walked out of his presence
[1:13:15] but it's always been God's desire
[1:13:19] to be gathered with his children the
[1:13:22] father with his daughter
[1:13:25] the father with his son the Father the
[1:13:29] husband with his bride
[1:13:31] oh it's a great plan to gather you back
[1:13:35] to himself
[1:13:38] don't get so busy and
[1:13:44] that you haven't got time
[1:13:47] to let God gather you in your prayer
[1:13:50] closet
[1:13:53] to enter into a fellowship Divine with
[1:13:57] him
[1:14:05] part one part one had begun
[1:14:09] in the days of Jesus and we emphasize
[1:14:13] part one
[1:14:15] because it's a pattern of how part seven
[1:14:18] would unfold
[1:14:22] part one would unfold with a forerunner
[1:14:28] of John the Baptist who would forerun
[1:14:31] the first coming of Christ
[1:14:35] part one is the opening of this first
[1:14:37] steal
[1:14:40] it was the lamb who opened up okay
[1:14:43] foreign
[1:14:46] because the book that the lamb was
[1:14:48] opening
[1:14:51] this book sealed with Seven Seals
[1:14:56] this book of redemption this book of
[1:15:00] Salvation this is the the Lamb's Book of
[1:15:03] Life
[1:15:04] the lamb is the only one that can open
[1:15:07] it
[1:15:11] because it's a it's a book of redemption
[1:15:16] he was the one that opened it
[1:15:18] and when this book opened
[1:15:24] was in the days of Jesus
[1:15:28] the first coming of Christ
[1:15:31] is the opening
[1:15:35] of This Book of Salvation
[1:15:38] the first coming of Christ
[1:15:40] is the loosing and opening of the first
[1:15:43] seal is
[1:15:47] Seven Seals seven parts of one divine
[1:15:51] plan that God wants us to put our vision
[1:15:55] on okay
[1:15:58] that he can reveal it to us
[1:16:01] word by word and Page by Page
[1:16:04] and we can see
[1:16:07] his plan for our lives
[1:16:11] so Revelation 6 1
[1:16:15] unfolded and happened
[1:16:19] Revelation 6 1 is the prophecy
[1:16:23] but the manifestation
[1:16:26] where it opened
[1:16:28] and Jesus himself declares it
[1:16:32] was Matthew 11.
[1:16:34] so in Matthew 11.
[1:16:37] we can say
[1:16:39] that day this scripture of Revelation 6
[1:16:44] 1.
[1:16:45] came to pass
[1:16:48] it manifested
[1:16:51] it happened
[1:16:53] the vision unfolded in reality
[1:16:58] it says in Revelation 6 1 the first seal
[1:17:02] we've read it often
[1:17:04] because it's a pattern of our day of
[1:17:07] things to come
[1:17:10] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:17:14] the seals
[1:17:18] and I heard as it were the noise of
[1:17:21] thunder
[1:17:23] and I heard as it was the noise of
[1:17:26] thunder
[1:17:27] foreign
[1:17:32] and a prophet tells us what is a thunder
[1:17:35] okay in the Bible
[1:17:38] a thunder
[1:17:40] is the voice of God when a seal is open
[1:17:46] so it sounds redundant here
[1:17:52] can I solve when the lamb opened one of
[1:17:55] the seals
[1:17:58] and I heard as it were the noise of
[1:18:01] thunder
[1:18:08] um
[1:18:13] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:18:16] the seals and I heard as it were the
[1:18:17] noise of thunder so the noise of Thunder
[1:18:20] was the opening of one of the seals
[1:18:25] that's why a prophet told us
[1:18:28] what is the thunder it's the voice of
[1:18:32] God when a seal opens
[1:18:35] and what is this first talent what is
[1:18:37] this first verse telling us
[1:18:40] that the noise of Thunder
[1:18:43] represents the opening of one of the
[1:18:45] seals
[1:18:47] it was there all the time
[1:18:50] so simple but yet God used the way it
[1:18:54] was written to hide it from the eyes of
[1:18:57] the wise included
[1:18:58] Israel
[1:19:10] so who took it to Israel
[1:19:14] Israel was not waiting for for the Lamb
[1:19:17] of God
[1:19:20] Israel was waiting for messiah Israel
[1:19:24] Israel was waiting for the king of the
[1:19:27] Jews
[1:19:30] that's who that's the prophecies that
[1:19:32] Israel was waiting on
[1:19:35] but it's the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:19:39] that was going to be presented to them
[1:19:43] but it had to be the lamb presenter it
[1:19:46] had to be the lion presenting it to them
[1:19:51] it couldn't be the lamb
[1:19:53] it was the Lion's Ministry
[1:19:57] and he was going to take the Lamb's part
[1:20:01] Israel Israel God's people
[1:20:05] and he was going to present to them
[1:20:08] the kingdom of God
[1:20:11] the kingdom the kingdom of heaven
[1:20:15] that John the Baptist had already been
[1:20:18] preaching to them
[1:20:21] calling them to repent
[1:20:25] and be baptized
[1:20:28] that thy sins would be forgiveness
[1:20:34] that being baptized in water okay
[1:20:37] and submerged in water
[1:20:41] represented
[1:20:43] a supernatural baptism
[1:20:46] um
[1:20:51] John said I will baptize you with water
[1:20:57] but when he comes
[1:21:01] he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:03] and Fire
[1:21:07] the water baptism was just an outward
[1:21:10] expression
[1:21:15] of an inward work
[1:21:19] of this son of man
[1:21:40] of the pride of life
[1:21:42] that allow you to put your life in order
[1:21:48] and Revelation 6 1. the lamb opened the
[1:21:53] seal
[1:21:54] but it was one of the four beasts that
[1:21:57] said
[1:22:00] come and see Ben it was the lion
[1:22:04] because of the four beasts because of
[1:22:08] the four beasts
[1:22:11] because of the four beasts
[1:22:17] the first was the lion
[1:22:20] you can read it in Revelation
[1:22:27] this was the first seal it was the
[1:22:30] opening of The Plan of Redemption
[1:22:33] this was the first coming of Christ
[1:22:36] and the first Beast was the lion the
[1:22:41] lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:22:44] Messiah was going to take
[1:22:48] the the Lamb's Book of Life to Israel
[1:22:53] no more the law on the prophets
[1:22:56] he was bringing a life-changing book to
[1:22:59] them
[1:23:05] under the law they were not changed
[1:23:08] so under the law they were penalized
[1:23:13] [Music]
[1:23:14] they were chastened
[1:23:20] even unto death thou shall not kill
[1:23:25] if you kill the penalty was death
[1:23:37] or anything in his home
[1:23:40] don't cover his house don't cover his
[1:23:43] wife don't covet his children don't
[1:23:45] covet his work
[1:23:50] the penalty was always death
[1:23:55] but Jesus of Nazareth as line of the
[1:23:59] tribe of Judah
[1:24:00] he takes the open book
[1:24:05] the Lamb's Book a book of life
[1:24:09] not a book of law
[1:24:12] a book of redemption
[1:24:16] for God's children
[1:24:19] and the lion begins to teach it to
[1:24:22] Israel
[1:24:25] in Matthew 11. Jesus begins to share
[1:24:29] with them
[1:24:31] the opening of this book
[1:24:34] we've read it often
[1:24:38] because we want you to to catch it
[1:24:42] because the the opening of the first
[1:24:45] seal
[1:24:46] the first coming of Christ
[1:24:48] the the Forerunner Elijah Ministry
[1:24:53] it was all to repeat
[1:24:57] it would be a pattern again in our day
[1:25:01] that once again God would bring a
[1:25:04] forerunner
[1:25:06] an Elijah Ministry
[1:25:09] to reintroduce us to the Lamb of God
[1:25:13] reintroduce us to the Lamb's Book of
[1:25:16] Life
[1:25:17] because there's far too many legalists
[1:25:20] today in this message already
[1:25:25] amen
[1:25:28] that means they don't have a revelation
[1:25:30] of this Lamb's Book of Life
[1:25:34] that means they don't have a revelation
[1:25:36] of Jesus Christ
[1:25:38] because a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:25:42] brings you hope of salvation
[1:25:47] for you for your wife for your children
[1:25:51] because it's the Lamb's Book of Life is
[1:25:54] being revealed to you
[1:25:55] a book of life not a book of letters
[1:26:02] but the spirit give us life
[1:26:07] God yes
[1:26:11] took the book
[1:26:12] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:26:17] opened the first seal
[1:26:19] what does that mean he opened part one
[1:26:25] Redemption salvation and restoration had
[1:26:31] begun
[1:26:34] for God's family
[1:26:49] and where do we all begin yeah
[1:26:52] blessed are the porn spirit
[1:26:57] because we've all been born in sin
[1:27:02] shaped iniquity and we've come into this
[1:27:05] world speaking lies
[1:27:08] the soul that's laying within you
[1:27:12] is a child of God
[1:27:15] then this book is for you
[1:27:18] then you are part of this Kingdom then
[1:27:21] you have a promise of eternal life
[1:27:26] then you can go on to Perfection
[1:27:30] yeah it's 48 verses away
[1:27:34] but all you have to do is take God in
[1:27:37] his word
[1:27:39] and take the first step and take the
[1:27:43] second step and the third and the fourth
[1:27:45] and the fifth because there was 47
[1:27:48] verses
[1:27:49] of Jesus teaching us
[1:27:53] that will arrive into Perfection meaning
[1:27:58] eternal life
[1:27:59] meaning Rapture in faith
[1:28:03] thank you
[1:28:04] so Revelation 6 1
[1:28:07] was the beginning of a Teaching Ministry
[1:28:11] and the lion saying
[1:28:18] I know if you've had problems in your
[1:28:20] life
[1:28:21] I know you've had struggles in your life
[1:28:25] I know you've got complexes in your life
[1:28:29] and and the lion said to Israel
[1:28:33] all I want you to do
[1:28:36] is
[1:28:38] all I want you to do is get into the
[1:28:42] spirit
[1:28:43] all I want you to have is an ear
[1:28:48] to hear what the spirit is saying to you
[1:28:51] this morning
[1:28:54] and the Teaching Ministry
[1:28:57] begins at the first coming of Christ at
[1:29:01] the opening of the first seal
[1:29:03] where did it begin
[1:29:06] where did it open
[1:29:08] the prophecy was revelation 6.
[1:29:13] of this first seal that opened
[1:29:17] of this part one of seven parts
[1:29:22] that's where the prophecy is written
[1:29:26] but where did it actually happen and
[1:29:29] open
[1:29:32] Matthew Matthew 11.
[1:29:35] Jesus begins
[1:29:38] and it says that it came to pass
[1:29:40] Matthew 11 1.
[1:29:45] and it came to pass when Jesus made an
[1:29:49] end of commanding his twelve disciples
[1:29:52] and what did he command them
[1:29:56] go ye to the house of
[1:29:59] Israeli Don't Take This Book of Life to
[1:30:03] the Gentiles or don't take it to the
[1:30:05] Samaritans this ministry
[1:30:12] this message
[1:30:14] first is going to the firstborn Israel
[1:30:20] it must go to him first
[1:30:24] and it must be Messiah the lion that
[1:30:28] takes it
[1:30:30] because he's King of the Jews
[1:30:34] and this Lamb's Book of Life was first
[1:30:37] presented to the Jews
[1:30:40] and when the Jews rejected the Lamb's
[1:30:43] Book of Life
[1:30:46] when they rejected it then the Lamb's
[1:30:50] Book of Life
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:30:55] when they rejected it the Lamb's Book of
[1:31:00] Life
[1:31:04] was given to a gentile people
[1:31:13] do you see it
[1:31:17] but Matthew 11.
[1:31:19] Jesus begins teaching the ministry of
[1:31:23] John is over
[1:31:25] the Elijah Ministry is done
[1:31:31] the Baptist is now sitting in a Roman
[1:31:35] prison
[1:31:39] waiting to be executed
[1:31:43] he's done his work
[1:31:46] he's finished his ministry
[1:31:49] he will not come back again
[1:31:52] because he did what he had to do okay
[1:31:56] he introduced Jesus Christ
[1:31:59] to the world
[1:32:00] whether you accepted him or rejected him
[1:32:07] this Lamb of God
[1:32:09] John the Baptist introduced him
[1:32:13] the word living
[1:32:16] the word made flesh
[1:32:19] and he was done
[1:32:21] he was finished
[1:32:23] God took him off the scene
[1:32:26] then Begins the Teaching Ministry
[1:32:29] of
[1:32:30] Jesus Christ
[1:32:32] in the lion Ministry
[1:32:36] and it came to pass when Jesus made an
[1:32:38] end of commanding his twelve disciples
[1:32:41] he departed then to teach and preach in
[1:32:44] their cities
[1:32:53] the opening of the first seal
[1:32:57] is a Teaching Ministry
[1:33:01] teaching us
[1:33:04] about this Plan of Redemption
[1:33:07] it says verse 2 now when John had heard
[1:33:10] in the prison The Works of Christ he
[1:33:13] sent two of his disciples
[1:33:28] just a few months prior
[1:33:32] this
[1:33:33] John had had openly baptized Jesus in
[1:33:37] the Jordan
[1:33:41] saw a supernatural manifestation take
[1:33:44] place there
[1:33:47] he heard a voice
[1:33:53] saying this if my beloved Son and who
[1:33:56] I'm well pleased
[1:34:00] John himself said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:34:05] who take it away the sins of the world
[1:34:08] but now John's in prison
[1:34:11] he's been sitting there for days or
[1:34:13] months
[1:34:15] foreign
[1:34:37] did I just dream all of this
[1:34:41] did I give my life for nothing
[1:34:48] unto them go show John again these
[1:34:51] things which you do hear and see
[1:34:54] verse 4.
[1:35:02] this is how you'll know
[1:35:06] this is the details of the opening of
[1:35:09] the first seals
[1:35:12] of how the opening would begin
[1:35:15] did you catch it
[1:35:17] these are details that Jesus is giving
[1:35:20] us
[1:35:21] at the opening of the first year
[1:35:25] then wouldn't it also be details
[1:35:28] then then wouldn't it also be details
[1:35:35] of the same pattern
[1:35:38] that when we see it happen in our day
[1:35:42] to show that the seven seal is opened
[1:35:47] Jesus says the blind received their
[1:35:51] sight
[1:35:51] when the first seal opened
[1:35:55] the lame walked when the first seal
[1:35:58] opened the leopards were cleansed when
[1:36:03] the first seal opened the deaf here when
[1:36:07] the first seal opened the dead or raised
[1:36:10] up when the first seal opened the poor
[1:36:14] had the gospel preached to them
[1:36:19] then how would it be when the seven seal
[1:36:22] opens
[1:36:23] seventh second coming of Christ
[1:36:28] then what would it be
[1:36:31] will it be Christ
[1:36:35] Ed
[1:36:38] if in our date
[1:36:40] if we could say
[1:36:42] we've seen a Revival
[1:36:46] in the 20th century we're blind received
[1:36:50] their sight
[1:36:52] we're lame
[1:36:54] where lepers were cleansed
[1:36:57] were deaf heard where the dead were
[1:37:01] raised up
[1:37:05] I talked to brother Edmund way
[1:37:09] an Englishman
[1:37:17] he was the man that dropped dead in the
[1:37:20] prophet there in Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:37:24] well brother Brandon was preaching
[1:37:27] his wife Ruth
[1:37:32] screamed out
[1:37:37] you see sister Ruth was a registered
[1:37:40] nurse
[1:37:43] she saw his eyes roll back
[1:37:47] where it was just nothing but white
[1:37:50] she took his pulse
[1:37:52] and there was none the Breath of Life
[1:37:58] brother Edmund way was dead
[1:38:04] okay
[1:38:06] he said brother Edmond what do you
[1:38:07] remember
[1:38:10] just when brother Branham said
[1:38:13] brother Edmond just quietly
[1:38:17] and he called back to life
[1:38:21] and he opened his eyes he's laying on
[1:38:24] the ground
[1:38:25] and he sees brother Branham over and
[1:38:27] praying
[1:38:31] in this 20th century
[1:38:33] we've seen the blind receive their sight
[1:38:38] we watched the lame walk
[1:38:43] we've seen lepers cleansed
[1:38:47] we've seen the death here
[1:38:52] in in
[1:38:56] in a message brother Branham gives a
[1:38:58] testimony
[1:39:00] of a very young lady comes up to be
[1:39:03] prayed foreign
[1:39:30] and he says I sense there's a deaf
[1:39:33] Spirit did you say
[1:39:36] um
[1:39:39] and the young lady tells them
[1:39:42] she says I am they said see in one ear
[1:39:48] I've been deaf since I was a little girl
[1:39:53] and he goes on to discern foreign
[1:40:15] and she had been married once
[1:40:18] she has been married twice she had been
[1:40:21] married three times
[1:40:26] and her life hadn't been Pleasant at all
[1:40:30] then the gospel was preached unto her
[1:40:35] revealed to her condition
[1:40:39] and a prophet said is this true
[1:40:43] and she said it's all true
[1:40:46] and she was about to faint and fall down
[1:40:53] and a prophet said
[1:40:55] your sins which are men
[1:40:58] are all forgiven and he says at that
[1:41:02] moment
[1:41:03] he said God healed her deafness
[1:41:08] and she began to scream and shout out
[1:41:14] with a joy unspeakable
[1:41:18] he says not only did God heal her
[1:41:20] deafness
[1:41:23] and forgive all her sins
[1:41:26] he says but right there on that platform
[1:41:30] he baptized her with the Holy Ghost
[1:41:36] so here at the opening of the first seal
[1:41:40] these are details
[1:41:43] of this pattern that was to follow
[1:41:46] that when the first seal opened
[1:41:50] there was a healing Revival Ministry
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:58] and the blind received their sight
[1:42:02] and the lame walked and the lepers were
[1:42:06] cleansed foreign
[1:42:48] follow the pattern
[1:42:51] of God's word and while Jesus is
[1:42:55] revealing these details Jesus
[1:42:59] there are people in this multitude that
[1:43:01] he's preaching to
[1:43:04] um
[1:43:06] many are being offended
[1:43:13] because then he says in verse 6 and
[1:43:16] blessed is he
[1:43:18] is whosoever shall not be offended in me
[1:43:25] because he was sensing that many were
[1:43:28] being offended by this
[1:43:32] because they said he's making himself
[1:43:36] God
[1:43:38] he's making himself
[1:43:42] that's who he's making himself to be
[1:43:52] the multitude
[1:43:55] the multitude
[1:43:57] as they departed
[1:43:59] because they have become offended
[1:44:02] they couldn't take the preaching of the
[1:44:06] seals
[1:44:08] they can't take it today
[1:44:11] they'd rather walk away
[1:44:15] then hear about this Plan of Redemption
[1:44:18] salvation
[1:44:22] an overcoming power in our lives
[1:44:27] of how to get into Perfection
[1:44:30] What are the steps Where Do We Begin
[1:44:35] you begin with repent
[1:44:38] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:44:41] Jesus Christ
[1:44:42] it's how the first seal began
[1:44:45] it's the foundation Stones even of the
[1:44:48] Seven Seals
[1:44:52] and as they departed Jesus began to say
[1:44:54] unto the multitudes concerning John what
[1:44:57] went down to the Wilderness to see a
[1:44:59] reed shaken with the Wind
[1:45:02] um
[1:45:10] Jesus is unfolding to them
[1:45:15] the first coming of Christ
[1:45:20] and yet it's not history no more
[1:45:23] what he's unfolding
[1:45:26] is happening right before their eyes
[1:45:30] how many things in this Bible
[1:45:33] have happened right before our eyes
[1:45:38] and we fail to see it
[1:45:43] because we must be in the spirit
[1:45:47] to see spiritual things
[1:45:55] now Jesus
[1:45:57] begins
[1:45:59] speaking of the Forerunner
[1:46:04] Elijah yes
[1:46:07] at the first coming of Christ
[1:46:09] at the opening of the first scene
[1:46:13] as they departed Jesus began to say unto
[1:46:16] the multitudes concerning John verse 7
[1:46:18] what went down to the Wilderness to see
[1:46:21] a reed shaken with the Wind
[1:46:23] Raymond
[1:46:56] Israel hadn't seen a prophet in over 500
[1:46:59] years
[1:47:03] they didn't hardly know what a prophet
[1:47:05] looked like
[1:47:08] they couldn't hardly believe that God
[1:47:11] still had Prophets
[1:47:32] for this is he of whom it is written
[1:47:35] behold I send my messenger before thy
[1:47:38] face which shall prepare thy way before
[1:47:40] thee is
[1:47:52] now Jesus is bringing in scriptures
[1:48:04] and he puts John's name into this
[1:48:07] scripture
[1:48:10] if there's something that's offensive to
[1:48:13] the religious people of this world
[1:48:16] is when you put a name
[1:48:20] on the scriptures whether it's John's
[1:48:25] whether it's yours
[1:48:27] or whether it's William Branham
[1:48:30] even the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:33] is not popular in religion today
[1:48:38] oh they'll say oh no no we believe in
[1:48:40] Jesus
[1:48:42] ask them how were you baptized
[1:48:49] and why won't you be baptized in the
[1:48:51] name of Jesus
[1:48:54] watch the anger raise up
[1:48:58] because there's something they lack
[1:49:01] there's something
[1:49:05] they lack
[1:49:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:49:16] verse 11.
[1:49:19] verily I say unto you among them that
[1:49:21] are born of women there have not risen a
[1:49:24] greater than John the Baptist
[1:49:31] now we're standing he that is least in
[1:49:33] the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he
[1:49:36] is
[1:49:39] here Jesus was speaking of the wheat
[1:49:45] and the tears
[1:49:47] amongst the tears
[1:49:51] amongst the seed of the serpent
[1:49:54] is
[1:49:57] there's not a greater man than John
[1:49:59] Mayor
[1:50:06] even the little Grandma
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:11] it's greater than John yes for John was
[1:50:15] sent to serve God's people
[1:50:18] and he is the first fruits of a faithful
[1:50:21] Ministry
[1:50:25] who are sent to serve God's people
[1:50:30] not to be Lords over God's people
[1:50:35] but to be Servants
[1:50:40] of things to come under the opening of
[1:50:44] the seventh seals
[1:50:46] when the seven seal would also open
[1:50:51] with those same details
[1:50:54] as when the first seal opened
[1:50:58] Muertos
[1:51:08] it was the first coming of Christ
[1:51:11] it was the opening of the first seal
[1:51:14] and the seventh
[1:51:16] unfolded exactly in the same way
[1:51:20] but it'll be just a little flop that
[1:51:23] catches
[1:51:25] it'll just be a little group of
[1:51:27] Believers that a Remnant
[1:51:31] that will catch the revelation of Jesus
[1:51:35] Christ
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:37] and can see him in his word
[1:51:42] verse 12.
[1:51:45] now Jesus is teaching
[1:51:48] he's teaching about his first coming
[1:51:52] but it isn't coming
[1:51:55] it's there already it's in the midst of
[1:51:59] Israel
[1:52:00] it's first coming it was made flesh
[1:52:05] the plan of unfold or the plan of
[1:52:07] redemption's unfolding
[1:52:10] grace and mercy and changes being is
[1:52:14] being given to Israel
[1:52:17] that's what Israel rejected
[1:52:20] they rejected the opening of the Lamb's
[1:52:22] Book of Life
[1:52:25] they rejected these seven parts of
[1:52:28] redemption and salvation
[1:52:33] and the Bible says in verse 12.
[1:52:36] John has now first Jesus spoke of
[1:52:40] himself
[1:52:42] did you see the teach in Matthew 11 is
[1:52:45] mainland
[1:52:46] John comes his disciples come
[1:52:51] they say John wants to know are are you
[1:52:54] Messiah are you the king of the Jews
[1:52:59] so on the teaching of his first coming
[1:53:04] Jesus declares first
[1:53:08] I am the Christ
[1:53:10] I am the alpha
[1:53:12] I am the Omega I am the king of the Jews
[1:53:17] go tell John
[1:53:20] what the men how the ministry has begun
[1:53:24] and by these details foreign
[1:53:43] [Music]
[1:53:49] leaving now
[1:53:54] then he begins to speak on the
[1:53:57] Forerunner
[1:54:00] of how this seal would open up
[1:54:03] and it would begin with the ministry of
[1:54:06] John yeah
[1:54:08] who was going to be told
[1:54:12] who was going to be told
[1:54:16] you'll no longer preach the law
[1:54:20] but now the prophets
[1:54:22] under a New Covenant
[1:54:25] under a new testament
[1:54:29] Al we preach the kingdom of heaven
[1:54:33] will preach the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:54:38] people begin with Divine Healing for the
[1:54:41] body
[1:54:47] so that we can get the attention of the
[1:54:50] people
[1:54:51] who have been living in so much carnal
[1:54:54] paganism for so long
[1:55:00] so the thing God could deliver to them
[1:55:06] just like I have a healing for your body
[1:55:11] I want what I really want to give you
[1:55:15] is healing for the soul yes
[1:55:20] amen because the fullness of healing for
[1:55:23] the soul is
[1:55:27] eternal life
[1:55:28] that's Perfection
[1:55:31] and from the Day verse 12 of Matthew 11
[1:55:33] and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:55:36] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:55:39] suffereth violence and the violent take
[1:55:42] it by force
[1:55:50] now Jesus brings in
[1:55:55] the ride of the white horse rider
[1:55:59] Lucifer Lucifer Satan satanas
[1:56:03] so in Matthew 11
[1:56:05] Jesus identifies himself
[1:56:09] as the Christ the son of God
[1:56:14] then he identifies John
[1:56:17] in the scripture as Elijah
[1:56:21] then he tells us that in the days of the
[1:56:25] Elijah
[1:56:27] the white horse rider would begin right
[1:56:31] from the days of John the Baptist
[1:56:35] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:56:38] suffereth violence
[1:56:41] the Kingdom of Heaven is what okay
[1:56:48] the Kingdom of Heaven is the children of
[1:56:50] God
[1:56:52] who are watching the ministry of Jesus
[1:56:56] and we're catching a revelation of Jesus
[1:56:59] Christ
[1:57:01] that this was Messiah that this was
[1:57:04] Jehovah being flesh
[1:57:07] oh it was just a little handful of
[1:57:10] people
[1:57:16] and this Kingdom of Heaven
[1:57:18] this little group of Believers
[1:57:22] in the days when John the Baptist was
[1:57:25] still alive
[1:57:27] we're suffering violence
[1:57:31] and these violent ones yes we're taking
[1:57:35] the Believers by force
[1:57:39] and placing them in prisons
[1:57:42] and feeding them to the Lions
[1:57:45] and burning them at Stakes
[1:57:49] it had begun
[1:57:51] the right of the Antichrist
[1:57:55] this is the Fulfillment
[1:57:57] of Revelations
[1:58:02] let's read it just for a moment as we've
[1:58:06] read it many times before but I want to
[1:58:09] say it over and over till you catch the
[1:58:11] pattern
[1:58:17] because it's verse one and two
[1:58:20] that is the unfolding of part one
[1:58:24] the first seal and in verse verse 2 that
[1:58:30] says John says and I saw him Behold a
[1:58:32] white horse
[1:58:34] and he that sat on him had a bow
[1:58:40] and a crown was given unto him
[1:58:43] and with this bow in this Crown yes
[1:58:47] and with this bow can with this crown
[1:58:53] the writer on the White Horse
[1:58:56] when forth conquering and to conquer
[1:59:01] in other words he went out he went out
[1:59:04] causing violence
[1:59:07] and taking the children of God by
[1:59:11] violent Force
[1:59:14] how was he doing it with this bow with
[1:59:19] this bow and with this crown
[1:59:22] but the bow had no arrows
[1:59:26] and the crown he was not crowned with
[1:59:29] his crown
[1:59:31] no he just possessed this Crown
[1:59:36] well the bow was the Jewish Church
[1:59:43] and the Jewish church had no arrows
[1:59:47] because they were dominated by Rome
[1:59:51] can Rome took away all their rights
[1:59:57] to put anyone to death
[2:00:01] by the cross
[2:00:04] and the crown was Pagan Rome
[2:00:09] and in Pagan Rome
[2:00:12] and this big denomination
[2:00:16] even though they were enemies
[2:00:20] Lucifer used them both
[2:00:25] you know Lucifer can use enemies
[2:00:31] Kings of the earth
[2:00:34] residents of Nations
[2:00:36] they hate each other but he'll use all
[2:00:41] the nations of the world and the people
[2:00:45] to come forth as a flood to persecute
[2:00:48] this little bribe
[2:00:52] to come forth as a flight
[2:00:55] to persecute this little bride is the
[2:00:59] revenue and he's not changed his ways
[2:01:02] today
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:05] the countries of the world and the
[2:01:07] nations of the world
[2:01:09] our enemies
[2:01:11] the religious denominations of the world
[2:01:15] don't kid yourself they're not friends
[2:01:24] is not in love with the Pentecostal
[2:01:26] people
[2:01:29] they don't like they don't love the
[2:01:31] lutherans
[2:01:33] the Presbyterians or any of the others
[2:01:37] but through flattery they're going to
[2:01:39] try to bring them all together under
[2:01:41] their domain
[2:01:44] Dominion
[2:01:45] right here verse two
[2:01:48] this was Lucifer
[2:01:50] in the Days of Elijah
[2:01:53] and and Satan had Israel Israel the
[2:01:56] church
[2:01:58] and Rome the Pagan nation in his hands
[2:02:04] and you know well
[2:02:07] that the Jewish Church in the days of
[2:02:10] Jesus we're a violent people
[2:02:15] and you know well that Pagan Rome
[2:02:18] in the days of Jesus was a violent
[2:02:21] Nation
[2:02:23] but Israel
[2:02:27] had no arrows to put Jesus to death but
[2:02:31] uh
[2:02:34] but then you roam
[2:02:37] had many arrows
[2:02:41] and Israel the high priest
[2:02:45] Lucifer was anointing him Lucifer Long
[2:02:48] Hill to take get one Arrow from Rome
[2:02:53] do you remember where they got it
[2:02:56] they're at that Tribunal
[2:03:02] before Pontius Pilate
[2:03:05] when pilate after four days
[2:03:09] out of interrogating Jesus
[2:03:13] he comes out before Israel
[2:03:17] he comes out before the high priest
[2:03:21] and he says what shall I do with Jesus
[2:03:25] who's King of the Jews
[2:03:29] and the high priest said don't say that
[2:03:32] he's King of the Jews
[2:03:35] say that he said it
[2:03:38] hello punches finally says no what shall
[2:03:42] I do with Jesus king of the Jews
[2:03:47] and Lucifer Lucifer Whispers in the year
[2:03:51] of the high priest
[2:03:54] this is your chance
[2:03:56] to get the arrow that you want
[2:04:00] tell them really say it out loud before
[2:04:05] Pontius Pilate and the Roman people
[2:04:07] and
[2:04:10] he whispers Lucifer Whispers in the
[2:04:14] caiapha's ear
[2:04:18] and the high priest is Anointed
[2:04:22] he thinks it's a personal revelation
[2:04:26] he thinks
[2:04:28] that it's a personal revelation and it
[2:04:32] was but it came from Lucifer it came
[2:04:36] from Satan and the high priest says this
[2:04:51] that's it
[2:04:53] sold himself
[2:04:55] to the devil's bidding
[2:04:58] were they the Church of God
[2:05:01] were they all holy
[2:05:05] holy they were not
[2:05:07] they sold their soul to the devil Diablo
[2:05:13] and Lucifer helped the bow get the one
[2:05:15] Arrow they thought they wanted
[2:05:18] um
[2:05:21] they thought when they got that arrow
[2:05:25] that it would give them more power in
[2:05:28] Israel
[2:05:32] that they thought killed Jesus
[2:05:36] was the arrow that scattered Israel for
[2:05:39] 2 000 years
[2:05:47] don't let anger get get in your life to
[2:05:50] such a place
[2:05:56] that you feel like if I can just tell
[2:05:58] this person such and such a thing put
[2:06:00] them in their place
[2:06:27] destroys your relationship with Jesus
[2:06:30] Christ
[2:06:32] Israel was the bone
[2:06:37] and when they finally got the arrow they
[2:06:39] thought would give them power
[2:06:44] and they got it from their enemy Rome
[2:06:50] and Luther Lucifer was using both of
[2:06:53] them
[2:06:57] they were all puppets the Nations that
[2:06:59] were all puppets in the hands of Satan
[2:07:06] and God is using them
[2:07:09] to bring violence to the Christians
[2:07:13] even today in this 21st century God is
[2:07:17] still anointing the rulers and the kings
[2:07:19] of the earth
[2:07:24] to persecute a little flock called The
[2:07:27] Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:07:39] the Jewish Church
[2:07:45] the Jewish church when Jesus came
[2:07:49] was in the hands of Lucifer
[2:07:52] did you catch that the Jewish church
[2:07:56] when Jesus came was in the hands of
[2:07:59] Lucifer
[2:08:01] and Jesus came he Jesus to break the
[2:08:05] chains
[2:08:08] and they rejected their freedom
[2:08:14] this morning
[2:08:19] Jesus wants to break your chains
[2:08:26] from the power of Satan
[2:08:30] and make you free yes sir Libre in
[2:08:32] Christ Jesus Christ Jesus
[2:08:36] you don't have to be a bow
[2:08:43] you don't have to be a bow
[2:08:46] with no arrows in the hands of Lucifer
[2:08:50] anymore
[2:08:52] you can be free
[2:08:54] for all that the spirit has set free
[2:09:00] or free indeed is Libre
[2:09:04] in the vision
[2:09:07] John said and I saw and behold a white
[2:09:10] horse and he that sat on him had a bow
[2:09:12] had the Jewish church and a crown had
[2:09:16] the Pagan Rome in his hand and was given
[2:09:19] and they were given unto him and with
[2:09:21] the and with Israel the church and Pagan
[2:09:24] Rome he went forth conquering and to
[2:09:27] conquer
[2:09:32] and I saw a white horse
[2:09:39] provincial
[2:09:43] Israel was the bow
[2:10:13] the family of God
[2:10:19] that was the vision
[2:10:21] where did it come to pass
[2:10:26] Matthew 11.
[2:10:32] in verse 12.
[2:10:35] is where this prophecy this Vision
[2:10:38] happened
[2:10:40] and from the days of John the
[2:10:44] Baptista that's Elijah this is Elias
[2:10:47] until now
[2:10:49] the day that he's preaching the
[2:10:51] revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:10:55] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[2:11:00] and the violent take it by foreign
[2:11:34] also
[2:11:41] these things have already happened
[2:11:45] Elijah has come
[2:11:47] Elias avenido there was a great healing
[2:11:50] Revival we did see it
[2:11:58] and we've also seen
[2:12:00] just as the white horse rider began in
[2:12:03] the days of this Elijah
[2:12:07] guess when the pale horse riders started
[2:12:10] writing
[2:12:12] foreign
[2:13:22] we believe God sent a prophet
[2:13:25] they say no no the law and the prophets
[2:13:28] prophesied until John they say he said
[2:13:30] no no no no
[2:13:32] you should say
[2:13:35] what does that have to do with God
[2:13:37] having sent another prophet
[2:13:43] because immediately in the 14th verse
[2:13:47] verse 13 says for all the prophets in
[2:13:50] the law prophesied until John
[2:13:55] and if you'll receive it
[2:13:59] in verse 14
[2:14:01] this is another Prophet I'm sending you
[2:14:06] which is to come
[2:14:08] this is the Elijah Ministry
[2:14:11] now Jesus is connecting John
[2:14:14] Jesus
[2:14:21] behold I send you Elijah
[2:14:24] before the great and terrible day of the
[2:14:27] Lord
[2:14:31] so Jesus in the teaching of the first
[2:14:34] coming
[2:14:37] declares John and Malachi 3.
[2:14:41] declares John and Malachi 4.
[2:14:46] then he says ears to Here
[2:14:53] let him hear
[2:14:57] it was the first time that phrase was
[2:14:59] ever spoken hardly in the Bible
[2:15:04] but it would be spoken
[2:15:07] throughout seven Church angels
[2:15:10] and this morning
[2:15:16] let him here okay
[2:15:32] do you love them this morning
[2:15:34] God's been so good to us
[2:15:39] open in the eyes of our understanding
[2:15:43] so we could see how great his grace and
[2:15:47] his Mercy has actually been in our lives
[2:15:52] to see when we were once lost in sin
[2:15:55] [Music]
[2:15:57] like the songwriter wrote
[2:16:02] we were like that little girl
[2:16:05] dead in all our sins
[2:16:10] till Jesus touched This Heart of mine
[2:16:15] and gave me life again
[2:16:18] I'm just a house of clay
[2:16:23] ever since that blessed day
[2:16:29] there's a light that shines on me
[2:16:40] in the chorus of the song says
[2:16:45] he's in the house
[2:16:47] death had to flee
[2:16:57] where Darkness used to be
[2:17:01] now there is hope
[2:17:04] there's no more doubt
[2:17:06] praise His name
[2:17:09] he's in the house
[2:17:13] or that house you are the Temple of the
[2:17:17] Holy Spirit
[2:17:19] and at the opening of the seventh seals
[2:17:29] and he said he said blessed are the porn
[2:17:36] Spirits is the kingdom of heaven
[2:17:42] and he wants to take you
[2:17:45] I'm a person repenting of all these
[2:17:48] things
[2:17:51] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:18:01] the changes our appetite
[2:18:04] and places the love of God in our hearts
[2:18:09] you said if you love the world and the
[2:18:12] things of the world
