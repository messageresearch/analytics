this morning just as brother uh Kenny called me up I realized I'd forgotten to put on the microphone that hooks on here um I I do I do know it works better so I'm going to ask brother Kenny to go in the back it's in the office there sitting on the table and it uh it works better for uh the Saints on YouTube and also here it's a help to to our brother Leo or whoever's or the brother's interpreting that way if I move around a little bit so if I move around a little bit then they can still hear they don't lose the voice so this morning we we'd uh had Upon Our Hearts uh to speak on a subject um and I I entitled it let us speak so they will follow Jesus and and uh the subject taking sides with Jesus so if you'll turn with me in your Bibles to St John chapter 1 there in uh verse 35 St John chapter 1 and verse we'll begin right there again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he say he saith Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye then then Jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said un to him Rabbi which is to say being an interpreted Master where dwellest thou and he saith unto them come and see and they came and saw where he dwelt and Abode with him that day for it was about the 10th hour the 10th hour for us would have been about 400 [Music] p.m. verse 40 and one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this morning we ask your blessings upon your word as it goes to every heart may they be may they may there be something may may there be something that will speak to their hearts and encourage them to press forward in Jesus name amen am you may be seated I believe it's the desire I believe it is the desire I believe of every sincere [Music] minister to hear someone say when I heard you speak about the Lamb of God since then I've turned to follow Jesus and now I'm taking sides with Jesus that's our desire when we preach the gospel for the people to say now that I've heard the gospel preached I decided that I too I'm taking sides with Jesus so if we stand for Jesus does does that mean we that we have to openly take a stand against somebody in Acts chapter 5 if if you remember it began with ananas and saf but what followed that was a Revival an explosion of a church being birthed with signs and wonders following them but moving in parallel with his great Revival was a great persecution it's the same pattern that is repeated from the first coming of Christ to the day we're living today there is a revival going on right now under this third pole Ministry not under the first and second Pole that was to catch the attention of those who were honest in their hearts of those who wanted real change in their lives and families so here there had begun a great Revival at the first coming of Christ but moving in parallel with this great Revival a great persecution a persecution on on Israel and a persecution of the Believers in Christ that were following Jesus now it was a persecution by the Romans it was a persecution on the church by the Jews who had no confession of faith and even those Jews who claimed to follow Moses and the law so it was Pagan Rome and the Jewish Orthodox Church became the violent ones that were persecuting the the followers of Jesus A New Testament Church a New Testament Church no no a new testament it was the followers of Jesus it was rising up rising up and they were trying to and and and and the this persecution of Rome and the Jewish Church against the followers of Jesus in other words it was the state and the government and the denomination of that day there was persecuting this Born Again Church and and it repeats again today and it's repeated through all the ages church and state against a little group mystical body of Jesus Christ and this Jewish church and Pagan Rome they were trying to convince all Israel the high priest that the Disciples of Jesus were blasphemers J were Blas fers if you're for us you must openly declare that you're against them and join in an open persecution and be with us a participator in this boycott in the message the handwriting on the wall brother says now I want you to notice now I want you to notice as soon as the king saw this Vision speaking of the Nebuchadnezzar as soon as the king saw this vision and he made it he forced every person in his kingdom to worship this image to this Pagan King he made an image he says and it's believed by Scholars and I do believe that a Spirit-filled person would see it he worshiped Daniel is what they did and he made an image to Daniel and he called it belar and then he called Daniel belar which was the name of his God and he made an image and forced every person to worship that image a prophet says I want you to notice that at the beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt dealt with them they got hotti arrogantes in in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man and the Gentile age was issued in with that and it will go out the same way in other words today saying it will happen again that they will raise up the worship of a holy man and we're seeing it in this day not only with a man that God sent a prophetic Ministry but it'll go to the next level with a one world global leader with a one world lead the pope of Rome and it'll become church and state again Rome and the great denomination at the second coming it will happen like it happened at the first coming when Pagan Rome and the Orthodox Jewish Church though they were enemies they came they they came in a union together how do enemies come together they have one leader Lucifer Lucifer and the same leader anoints them both ano two enemies to work to his goal to crucify the word made flesh it happened at the first coming it will happen at the second coming it is happening so a prophet says I want you to notice that the beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt with them they got hotty in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man and the Gentile age was issued in with that and it'll go out the same way the same way a boycot of the mark of the beast that will force people to worship images and to do things that we've been taught that was contrary to the word of God and brother it will be so slick and Sly until it will deceive the very elect if possible so where would this great deception be right within the ranks of what's called this end time message it will deceive the very elect if possible so you better purpose in your heart tonight and be filled with God's holy spirit that you'll be able to discern the right and wrong thing when that Proclamation is issued for the worship of a holy man I believe that a born again believer will take sides with Jesus and he won't be persuaded to boycott against any brother any sister churches or Minister listen to this what if your best friend your mom your dad your brother your sister your uncle your aunt would come and tell you we need to talk because they have some grievances against somebody some church some Minister it's a spirit of boycott and it's working in an infancy stage infancia so that so so what we do so what do we do this is your mother this is your father this is your uncle this is your Aunt perhaps even another Minister and yet it's not them it's Satan trying to divide us to scatter us to scatter us and and aim our guns at each other what do we say in these situations the Bible holds our answer we don't want to get caught up in just getting in just agree in just helping someone's anger build by getting angry with them we want to stand for the word because when you stand for the word you can help that angry brother you can help that angry sister by taking sides with Jesus Acts chapter 5 and verse 12 and Luke giving his witness and testimony in this book of Acts and it says and by the hands of the Apostle were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in in Solomon's porch and of the rest there there's no man join himself to them but the people magnified them and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women a great Revival in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them there ALS there came also a multitude out of the Cities round about into Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone who could be angry at this kind of a Revival you would think everyone would receive it you see so many being blessed but there were those who had did anger because it wasn't happening in their Church in their group verse 17 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in common prison in the message Serv we would see Jesus the prophet says now notice these same disciples and how Petty people can be how Petty these people can be how juvenile that grown-ups can be how grownups in our organizations and in our denominations and our affili ation and our Creeds we end them with a period when we ought to end them with a comma and say we believe this plus as much more as God will let us know but if we end it with a period that settles it that's all we don't care about what God wants to let us know we're saying this is all we want right here and that's what we've done when we made a mistake in the message Serv we would see Jesus Prophet continues to say he said now watch the same disciples a few days later they met a man casting out Devils you'll read it in Mark chapter n matter of fact let's read it right now Mark chapter [Music] n and it'll be verse 38 and 39 Mark 9 verse 38 and John answered him saying Master we saw one casting out Devils John said we saw this man casting out devils and in your name he was doing it listen to what John said now and he followeth not us and we forbade him because he followeth not us and Jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me now this quote again in the message we would see s we would see Jesus now watch the same disciples a few days later they met a man casting out Devils he was getting the job done and so they were very jealous they were very jealous so he goes down and he said now here you so John went down and he said now here you either join our ranks or or or don't you do that no more and the man let them know that he didn't need to join their denomination their ranks he went up there and he heard Jesus saying whosoever will so he just received it and went on and he was getting the job done well the disciples said we forbid you the disciples Peter John and Matthew the disciples said we forbid you in other words we'll boycott you well we'll do all this if you don't do as we [Music] say so if you take sides with Jesus you don't have to boycott someone or some church to prove it you just stand on the word on Truth when you stand on the word you're not angry angry at anyone no because the word that you're standing on will set the slaves free if they'll receive it if they'll take the key unlock their chains are you saying brother Daniel the same thing is trying to get amongst us today in s we would see Jesus Prophet said he said John John said we forbid you in other words we'll boycott you we'll do all of this if you don't do it so he went back and told Jesus about it and Jesus said now don't you do that don't you do that there was a time a prophet in a message he preached in 1963 after the seals I'm trying to remember the name of the message right now and and he said the Lord had told him to stop calling the people Ricky and Ras from the and he told them why because there's still a lot of my children in those denominations and he told them you're hurting them he said I got a complex and I I said well if the people won't hear the message I'll preach it harder than ever and God told him don't do that don't be name calling don't call them Ricky and Ras the prophet had built up a complex a feeling so rejected and he realized it because God spoke to him and it was a great struggle in his life that was 1963 and from 63 to 65 I went and looked and I said I wonder if he was still struggling or or if he overcame it immediately when God spoke to him and as I went to search from the time the L he the he said said the Lord rebuked them to stop there's over 40 times that he continued to do it why because he was a man feeling broken rejected feeling without friends and it was a great struggle for him and yet he God's prophet and that might be happening to some of you struggling with feelings of rejection feelings of anger feelings of the past that it hasn't given you the future you're looking for it's okay to struggle but God is speaking to our hearts this morning don't do that no more what if I do do it again just say Lord I'm sorry forgive me every time it happens and keep walking forward in the name of Jesus till the love of God Pours Down into our hearts he said you see what it is it's little petty jealousy of those disciples it was in men then it's still in men today you say where and what man starting with this man it's there it's part of the Fallen nature it's why I needed a born again experience to mortify the Deeds of this flesh brother says that's right because the man was getting the job done and many times you find people who are getting the job done that don't belong to our ranks then we want to fly up about it but it's just the same element listen to this and if it was in the Church of 12 that walked with Jesus he says it's bound to be in this one brandom Tabernacle and all the rest of them that's right so brethren we are here present we are here we are here to represent the Lord Jesus Christ and his resurrection and we pray that you'll Fellowship around the word with us then he says shall we pray just a moment so by the Bible when folks you love and respect by the Bible when folks you love and respect so the Bible when folks you love are trying to get you to take sides with them what do you do are you angry are you now Angry against the same person can't look that person person in the eyee you have just become part of a personal boycott like the disciples like the high priest like the Pharisees and a prophet said if it was in the Church of 12 that walked with Jesus it's bound to be in this one and all the rest of them that's right because there's because there is a certain element that's in every Church you know what it is human beings that need to be born again acts 5 and verse 27 the father was about to turn the tables the acts 5:27 the father was about to turn the tables on his children to turn the hearts of the old ways verse 27 and when they had brought them they sent them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in his name and behold you have filled Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood Upon Us yeah what what are they doing to the disciples here they're forbidding them to talk about Jesus remember what the disciples said in Mark 9 the disciples said to the man who was getting the job done we forbid you in other words we'll boycott you we'll do all this if you don't do it the Pharisees were now doing it to them they had done it they had done it themselves to another man and yet a New Testament Church had been born but people needed a born again experience on the day of Pentecost 120 people poor in spirit like Sarah they needed that experience but that one time experience wasn't enough they would need a refilling every day like you and I a one time experience is enough you and I need a refilling of the Holy Spirit to overcome this kind of Temptation verse 29 then Peter and the other Apostles answered and said we ought to obey God rather than men the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree he's now speaking by Revelation not trying not trying to make them feel bad or accuse them this had happened it was real him ha God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God had given to them that obey him a principle in the scripture obedience restores a friendship with the father when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them in the midst of this Angry [Music] Crowd and this growing boycott in the Church of Jerusalem there stood a man who took sides with Jesus he didn't take sides with the council he didn't voice himself against the disciples Acts 34 534 then stood there up one in the council a Pharisee named Gia a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space Gia was a wise man Gia was an elder in the Church of Jerusalem Gia was respected because he always stood on the words Gia sees here a different scene because he wasn't getting angry with all the other ministers so he was looking at the same people very differently he was looking at them through the word theia sees here are the children of the assembly he he says here are are the fathers of the assembly fighting each other in the name of the same father Jehovah and said unto them ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men for before these days rose up thus boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to not after this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing and Drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed and in this message there's also risen up all kinds of men with all kinds of followings so Gia is giving us wisdom here for our day too don't worry about all that that's happened but look at it through the eyes of the word verse 38 and now I say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone you see the wisdom in this man refrain from these men and let them alone but the Pharisees that rose up with violence against them if if for if this counil or this work be of men it will come to not but if it be of God you cannot overthrow it lest happily ye be found even to fight against God even if they had at that moment killed the apostles even if at that moment if they had killed the apostles it would not have stopped God like that he would have rose up more men if I die tomorrow don't worry God if God is in it God will raise up another man help you push forward Gia didn't take sides with his church or his friends or [Music] family Gia didn't take sides with the disciples he took sides with God Gia was a man who was who was who absolute was God Gia what kind of man is absolutely a pillar in the church Gia that kind of man is the best of fathers that kind of man is the best of friends that kind of man when he's done preaching will convince you to say I pledge allegiance to the Lamb of God with all my heart with all I am I want to be that kind of a man the men of this assembly the you should be that kind of man I should be that kind of man a man that when you get home your wife and family are so happy to see [Music] you I missed you I haven't seen continue in over eight and a half hours First Corinthians verse 10 the Apostle Paul speaking to the Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 10 now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind in the same judgment I've been I have been in churches of four and 500 people where the word is not preached and though there's hundreds there the church is filled with little groups clicks clicks because the word isn't preached they're scared to leave the church so they find safety in in binding themselves to little groups of the same mind so that they can speak their their thoughts and it won't get back to the pastor and the deacons who will they who will then visit them in their homes just to rebuke them and Hammer them rebuke them and Hammer them so four 500 people you you get to those churches you say wow God must be here look at all the people but if you could see it spiritually you see 400 people divided in this church no Harmony and yet they all stay because of fear because though the word isn't preached fear is preached and inject it into the hearts of the people if you leave this church you're not leaving God you're leaving the word that statement has been around for thousands of years it's not new to the day we're living it's what Lucifer puts in the hearts of nian leaders but in the midst of this this Jewish Church men hardened by the law there was one man called Gia who didn't take sides the church do didn't even take sides with the disciples he took sides with God he warned the Pharisees if this is of god you find yourself fighting against God didn't take sides with this church and and he said to the disciples but if this isn't of God you men will come to nothing and Gia said what I will do I will wait on God In Prayer because the word and God will manifest himself and I'm willing to wait for that manifestation of Truth First Corinthians 1:10 now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing and there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and the same judgment why did Paul make this statement he's going to tell us the reason for him making this statement for it had been declared unto unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the House of Khloe that there are contentions among you now this I say verse 12 now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul I am of Apollos I am of sephus and I of Christ you see what was happening they were beginning to enter into the worship of holy men they were taking sides with men no it's all about Jesus our savior our Lord Our Redeemer Paul didn't preach Paul Paul preached Jesus Christ in us the hope of glory First Corinthians 113 is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul in Acts chapter 7 you'll remember Steven A Man full of the Holy Ghost and Faith with signs and wonders preaching repentance and forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ he preached to the high priest and Council a long and scorching message finally inditing them for the first crucifixion of Christ he was trying to turn their hearts to repentance that all their sin could be forgiven he wasn't taking sides against them he never cursed them just the contrary and at the end of his message in Acts 7:59 they they stoned stepen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice father curse them these men these evil Wicked Violent Men he didn't say that and he kneel down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he said this he fell asleep verse 60 of Acts 7 16 and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep it would be a good practice for all of us starting with me that as I kneel down in the evenings to go to bed that I could cry with a loud [Music] voice remembering all the wrong that I think people did me and say Lord as I go to bed lay not this sin to their charge then lay my head down and sleep Ste Steven had taken sides with Jesus that was the very Spirit of Christ in Sten lay not this sin to their charge crying out for the Lord to give them crying out to the Lord to give them or someone in that murderous crowdin a space to repent even after his death let me say it again Steven had taken sides with Jesus that was the very Spirit of Christ in stepen he said lay not this sin to their charge crying out for the Lord to give them or someone in that murderous crowd a space to repent even after his death Steven was speaking hoping someone would stand up in the midst of them all and say I'll follow Jesus I'll take my stand with the Lord's despise few taking sides with Jesus doesn't mean you're against other human beings on the contrary you're for one particular race not the black race not the brown not the white not the yellow or red the human race because in that human race are Sons and Daughters of God that's why that's why God told the prophet don't call them rickes and Ras no more my children are still in those systems and when you do that you hurt them you stunt their growth St John 3:16 scripture well known to all of us for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God Lord let us Speak Lord let us speak so that all that hear will follow Jesus and they will want to know where he dwells in the father's house and they delivered of this old pest house ptil Luke 15 and verse one the testimony of Luke a gospel that he gave then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the Pharisees and Scribe murmured saying this man receiveth Sinners and eateth with them they were murmuring but speaking just loud enough so all could hear them what were they doing provoking the People by laying seeds in the hearts of the people that would ultimately bring forth the crucifixion the fullness of their boycott let me read it again what were these Pharisees doing and the scriptures they were provoking the People by laying seeds in the hearts of the people that would ultimately bring forth the crucifixion no no that would ultimately bring forth the crucifixion uh-huh the fullness of their boycott for every boycott that comes comes to bring a final end and result don't get involved in the boycotts of this world it's not of God it's not for you God has something better for you God has something more excellent for you God has a character building process for you and me Luke 1511 this is a parable of a father who stood with arms outstretched towards the younger and the Elder out stretched towards the younger and the Elder not taking sides with either one of them but realizing that neither the younger or the [Music] Elder understood the value the power the glory of the inheritance that the father had for them neither the younger or the Elder appreciated or understood the value of the inheritance that the father had for both of them each one wanted give me what's mine verse 11 and he said a certain man had two sons it's a parable not to be taken literally there's a mystery laying in it Beyond just that a young man threw himself to the world and that the older be be be became a denominational believer full of full of anger and yet religious no it goes beyond that verse 12 and the Young of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all [Music] together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with Riot his living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine now listen close he joined himself to a man who had a a herd of swine that tells us that this man was not a Jew this man was not a Believer this one this man was a pagan ungodly Gentile and this Jewish boy who had been taught that this was blasphemy for him to touch this joined himself to this man got a job feeding the swine verse 16 and he would Fain have filled his belly with the hus that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him the young man with a Jewish upbringing Jewish father who taught him the law he he is now committing for Israel an unpardonable sin this young man to return to his father natural to return to return to a natural Jewish father that if he would return the father would be obligated to Stone this son to death not receive him for he crossed the line but Jesus wasn't speaking naturally it was a parable he was speaking Supernatural and the younger son living living in sin represented a New Testament Church rising up a gentile people as brother br says carrying clubs a violent people no God in their lives the younger son represented a New Testament Church verse 17 and when he came to himself he said how many hired Servants of my father fathers have bread enough even to spare and I perish with Hunger I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee he knew what the he knew what the what what he had done he' had enough of that life he was practicing what to say to his father when he got there he he didn't want to take any chances that he would say the wrong thing I've got to I got to practice what I'm going to tell the father and and am no more worthy vers 19 to be called thy son he knew the penalty under the law he said make me as one of thy hired servants I know I can't be your son no more I know the penalty of it it's for me the penalty is now death so can please consider me dead and let me be just a servant he practiced it what he would say because he was coming repented step one if you want God on the scene repent don't be part of boycotts verse 20 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him our father saw us when we were all a great way off when we were in sin when we were stealing when we were living when we were lying when we were when we were drunken when we were smoking when we were doing all these things yet because we were Sons and Daughters of God God saw us when we were that far away and then his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him this is a parable verse 20 and verse 20 is the day of P Pentecost when the father saw 120 in the upper room shaking hiding from the Romans hiding from the from the Jewish Orthodox church because the Believers of Jesus were being killed and persecuted and he arose and came to his father verse 20 but when he was yet a great way off his father's St had compassion and ra and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father I know I haven't been such a good boy but you know what you're not such a great dad either that's not the way a son or a daughter should return who are repented a son or a daughter a father or mother when they're repented they come back and say I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight 21 and am no more worthy to be called thy son repentance this man was ready for a baptism of the Holy Ghost repentance opens the doors of Heaven for the fire of the Holy Ghost to come down verse 22 but the father said to his servants that's not good enough if you think you're fooling me no no one fools the father he knew he was repented he knew he was sorry for all he had done but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on them put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet oh a church was being born on the day of Pentecost here it was a prophecy bring and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it let us eat and be married for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be mared a church is born on the day of Pentecost it was a parable of the younger and older son brother Daniel proved that prove by the word that a young that two boys represented two churches because I've only heard said the woman represents the churches okay go back in your minds to the Old Testament go with me to the Book of Genesis and let's see Joseph bringing his two sons the younger and the older Ephraim and Manasses to his Prophet father Jacob k a prophet and he wants for Jacob to pray for his two sons as was the custom and tradition of Israel is he wants them he wants him to to bless the firstborn because and the firstborn gets all of the father's Goods those and the younger would just get a blessing you've been a good boy and uh I'm I'm happy to have you as a son but you're going to have to go out and get a job your older brother is the firstborn and he gets everything and he puts the elders at Jacob's right hand and the youngest at his left and he says we're ready father bless them and Jacob is blind now remember that and Jacob crosses his hands and he gives the inheritance of the firstborn to the youngest to the youngest girl no no no no no they were boys he gives the inheritance of the firstborn the youngest boy he gives the youngest The Inheritance that belonged to the firstborn and to the firstborn just gives a simple blessing and Joseph opens his eyes a little and he sees his dad crossed his hands he said no father I've already placed them the way they should be I have scripturally placed these two boys you messed it up you crossed your hands Jacob didn't understand it but being prophet he just obeyed what God told cross your hands and give the inheritance to the younger what was it an allegory that at the cross of Calvary The Inheritance that belonged to Israel would be given to a New Testament Church born at the opening of the first seal at the first coming of Christ what Israel rejected what Israel rejected the opening of the book the Lamb's Book and the loosing of the Seven Seals that's what Israel rejected that's what was was given to a New Testament Church on the day of Pentecost verse 22 but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet verse 22 Luke 15 who is the young man A New Testament Church born the day of Pentecost and bring and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry the fatted calf represents Christ we are eating today of the body word we're partaking of this fatted cab for this is my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be married that that represents every Born Again believer verse 25 now his Elder son was in the field this is the Jewish church this was an allegory a parable that Jesus was giving to the Jews and he was letting them know that they're the Elder son and the now this now his Elder son was in the field and as he came and Drew night to the house he heard music and dancing that was Israel when Jesus came had great campaigns praying for the sick thousands were healed thousands were were delivered of demon power the blind saw the lame walk they saw this Israel the church they heard the music that God was playing through the ministry of Jesus his first and second pool verse 2 and he called the eldest son he called he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant what is this that's taken this is the Prophecies of the prop coming to pass when they asked you what is this a message has come on the on the Earth what is this that God has opened his book and Loos the Seven Seals this is the prophecy of the prophets coming to pass and this day these scriptures are alive amongst us today verse 27 and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because Heath received them safe and sound and the elder brother and the Orthodox Church of Israel with their high priest and the denomination of that day and he was angry and would not not go in verse 28 and would not go in to this revival to recognize that Jesus was the Christ they would not go in and receive Jesus of Nazareth as Messiah they would not go in and be born again therefore came his father out and intreated them what just happened here the the boycott of the Elder had just begun verse 29 and he answering said to his father Lo these many years do I serve Thee the Jewish church is saying Lo these many years I serve thee how many years about 2,000 at least since the days that the church got established under Moses under Abraham and lo these many years do I serve thee this verse 29 the Jewish church had they they claimed they've served him for thousands of years neither transgressed I at any time thy [Music] commandment and yet they had broken all the Commandments through the years and then he said and yet thou never gavest me a kid and yet thou never gavest me a [Music] kid you never gave me a sacrifice that would bring me happiness with my friends and yet the sacrifice Jesus I'll not give you a kid I'll give you a lamb they didn't want the lamb so they haven't been married ever since they haven't been happy from the days that Israel rejected Messiah now they rejected the joy unspeakable and full of Glory that comes by receiving Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and staying away from boycotting the boycotts of this world Luke 15 and verse 30 but as soon as this thy son was come which ha devoured thy living with harlots thou has killed for him the fatted calf and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that I have is thine God ordained it to Israel from the days of Abraham and thy s and thy seed shall be as the sand upon the Earth and when and when they fall into bondage under a great nation I will deliver them verse 32 he said it was meat that we should make Merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and lost and is found it was two churches the younger boy and the older that represented a New Testament Church and a church under the law the father rejoices the father rejoices in raising the dead in Saving the lost in Healing The Sick restoring your joy lifting and enriching your spirit by causing you to be born again the father rejoices in changing your mourning into rejoicing the father rejoices in taking our misguided anger and giving you meekness a father rejoices in changing our hardness into Mercy Our Father rejoices in taking warmongers in and making you a peacemaker and when these changes come upon you Matthew 5:12 says rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven the burden of the Lord is that I'll leave 99 and go to the one that's here I'll leave the 99 and go to those who are predestinated Sons and Daughters of God to be raptured to be quickened changed and translated by the power of the Holy Ghost God rich in Mercy is looking not for a big group he's not looking for us to have ch to to have churches of 10 and 12 and 20,000 that's fine but he's looking for those who are honest in their hearts who are willing to repent who want to be changed daily who aren't putting periods on their Revelation but a comma God wants you and I to overcome our past how we grew up where our fathers and mothers were he wants now to look up my father who are in heaven Hallowed be thy name and thank him for the victory that he promised you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I may not know the details of what you've gone through in your life but he knows and because of what he knows

where I've preached to thousands and the pastor came after the service crying and he gives me an offering 60 pesos pesos you know what those 60 pesos were do you know what they were it was the money
