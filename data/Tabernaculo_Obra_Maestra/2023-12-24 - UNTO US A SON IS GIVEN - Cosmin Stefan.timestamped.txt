[1:04:36] good uh mentor to
[1:04:39] me you know he's an elder in the
[1:04:42] message and so sometimes um you know I
[1:04:46] I'm I'm just in the beginning stages of
[1:04:50] preaching I don't know much but that
[1:04:53] doesn't matter
[1:04:55] you know the Bible brother Bram said he
[1:04:59] was asked the question how much of the
[1:05:01] Bible he
[1:05:02] knew and his response was it doesn't
[1:05:05] matter how much of the Bible I know I
[1:05:07] know real
[1:05:10] well that's my heart's desire
[1:05:13] amen so my name is brother
[1:05:16] Cosman I have my my lovely wife here we

[1:05:55] and and and so my wife is is is pregnant
[1:05:58] at the
[1:06:00] moment and and the Lord's given me a
[1:06:04] boy I already know his name his name is
[1:06:07] goingon to be

[1:06:18] always faithful to
[1:06:21] me she's always been the love of my
[1:06:25] life and you know sometimes um you
[1:06:30] realize after a
[1:06:32] while that the the more you grow
[1:06:35] together the more you love each other
[1:06:38] because love is a
[1:06:40] relationship so I just thank her for
[1:06:42] just being here with me I know it's not
[1:06:45] easy so I wanted to speak a little bit I
[1:06:49] know that we have Christmas
[1:06:53] time and this is what the world says
[1:06:55] it's Christmas
[1:06:56] time it's not really Christmas time
[1:07:00] because brother Bram said that Jesus was
[1:07:03] born somewhere around April or
[1:07:07] May but it's it's the
[1:07:11] season this is the this is the way
[1:07:13] people
[1:07:14] celebrate and you know it's
[1:07:17] never late or not too much to talk about
[1:07:22] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:24] he should be our Our Testimony every
[1:07:28] day amen amen so we're just going to
[1:07:30] take an opportunity
[1:07:32] tonight and talk to you about unto us a
[1:07:37] son is
[1:07:39] given unto us a son was
[1:07:42] given so let's just stand stand
[1:07:45] tonight and turn to Isaiah chapter
[1:07:49] 7 is there going to be familiar
[1:07:51] scriptures to
[1:07:52] you
[1:07:54] and so um I just want you to walk along
[1:07:57] with us
[1:08:00] tonight and enjoy the word of
[1:08:03] God the word of God is made for us to
[1:08:05] enjoy
[1:08:07] it it's peace it's love it's it's all
[1:08:11] these attributes of God that he wants to
[1:08:13] express to
[1:08:15] us and so just follow along try to try
[1:08:19] to try to uh dine in
[1:08:22] together
[1:08:25] all that we
[1:08:26] know is open we're just sharing it
[1:08:31] there's nothing new everything's already
[1:08:33] been
[1:08:34] accomplished it just takes this time for
[1:08:38] us to walk into and fulfill the Plan of
[1:08:42] Redemption so what we're doing is
[1:08:45] fellowshiping the word that we're
[1:08:48] supposed to
[1:08:49] fulfill it's our time it's our hour it's
[1:08:54] it it's the time we're living
[1:08:56] in so Isaiah
[1:08:58] 7 ver 13-
[1:09:04] 16 and he
[1:09:07] said verse 13 and he said hear ye now oh
[1:09:11] House of
[1:09:15] David it is a small thing for you to
[1:09:17] weary
[1:09:20] me will ye weary My God also
[1:09:26] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:09:28] you a
[1:09:31] sign Behold a virgin shall
[1:09:35] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:09:38] his name
[1:09:40] Emmanuel butter and honey shall he
[1:09:43] eat that he may know that refuse to
[1:09:46] refuse the
[1:09:48] evil and to choose the
[1:09:50] good for the child for before before the
[1:09:54] child shall
[1:09:55] know to Res to refuse the evil and
[1:09:59] choose the
[1:10:01] good the land that thou up horest shall
[1:10:04] be forsaken of both her
[1:10:09] Kings so we now realize that Isaiah just
[1:10:12] spoke a
[1:10:15] word it was the word of of
[1:10:18] Prophecy it was the word that God has
[1:10:21] spoken through the mouth of a prophet
[1:10:25] which is the word of
[1:10:26] God let's keep walking let's go to
[1:10:28] Isaiah chapter
[1:10:31] 9 verses 2 to
[1:10:38] 7 the people that walked in darkness
[1:10:41] have seen a great
[1:10:44] light they that dwell in the land of the
[1:10:47] shadow of
[1:10:49] death upon them had the light shine
[1:10:55] thou Hast multiplied the
[1:10:58] nation and not increased the
[1:11:01] joy they Joy before thee according to
[1:11:05] the joy and
[1:11:09] harvest as me and as men rejoice when
[1:11:13] they divide the
[1:11:16] spoil for thou has broken the Yoke of
[1:11:19] his
[1:11:22] burden staff of
[1:11:24] shoulder the rod of his
[1:11:27] oppressor as in the day of the
[1:11:30] Midian now keep walking with us chap
[1:11:32] verse five just just pay attention real
[1:11:36] closely for every battle of the warrior
[1:11:39] is with confused
[1:11:44] noise and garments rolled in
[1:11:48] blood but there shall be with burning
[1:11:51] and fuel of Fire
[1:11:55] now look at the words that Isaiah is not
[1:11:59] prophesying here six For unto us a child
[1:12:03] is
[1:12:05] born unto us a son is
[1:12:09] given and the government shall be upon
[1:12:12] his

[1:12:23] father ET the Prince of
[1:12:26] Peace of the increase of his government
[1:12:29] and peace there shall be no
[1:12:32] end upon the throne of
[1:12:35] David and upon his kingdom to order it
[1:12:39] and to establishment to establish
[1:12:42] it with judgment and with Justice from
[1:12:45] henceforth forever ever even
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:51] forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts
[1:12:54] will perform
[1:12:57] this I'm going to read that one more
[1:12:59] time the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[1:13:02] perform
[1:13:05] this so you see whose hand whose hand is
[1:13:08] in on in and
[1:13:10] on it's God
[1:13:13] himself it's his plan he's the one doing
[1:13:17] that amen amen God bless you you can
[1:13:19] have your seats Lord we just ask a
[1:13:22] blessing upon the reading of your word
[1:13:24] bless one more time tonight in Jesus
[1:13:27] Christ name amen amen so we're
[1:13:31] approaching Christmas
[1:13:34] time excuse me I want to take this off
[1:13:39] Amen brother Daniel gave me the
[1:13:43] liberty so we're we're
[1:13:46] family we're just fellowshipping around
[1:13:49] the word of
[1:13:51] God so
[1:13:54] Isaiah
[1:13:56] prophesied and now the word of God as
[1:14:00] the
[1:14:01] logos is now hoovering upon the
[1:14:06] world 400
[1:14:10] years 400
[1:14:13] years it just Hoovers around and waits
[1:14:16] for this prophecy to be
[1:14:19] fulfilled and God finds the time
[1:14:24] come down now listen to what brother
[1:14:26] brandom says
[1:14:28] here
[1:14:32] because the nature of the
[1:14:35] word was always to take
[1:14:40] flesh the nature of the
[1:14:42] word was always to take
[1:14:47] flesh brother bam says this in
[1:14:51] 1963 he says the Holy Ghost is the
[1:14:54] father of Jesus
[1:14:56] Christ Matthew the 2 chapter 20th verse
[1:15:00] says it says Mary his
[1:15:03] mother when she was espoused to
[1:15:07] Joseph she was found with the child of
[1:15:10] the Holy
[1:15:11] Ghost the Holy Ghost is the father of
[1:15:14] Jesus
[1:15:15] Christ and when the Holy Ghost
[1:15:18] comes and reveals the
[1:15:22] word and it makes it live just
[1:15:28] exact then it's a revelation to
[1:15:32] you you see it it's
[1:15:36] unfolded it's promised for the
[1:15:41] hour Joseph seen
[1:15:44] that that was Isaiah's prophecy
[1:15:48] fulfill he said unto us a son is
[1:15:52] born a child is
[1:15:55] given He Shall be Called
[1:15:57] counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God
[1:16:01] Everlasting father and his kingdom there
[1:16:05] shall be no
[1:16:06] end he knew who that would
[1:16:10] be because he saw the whole thing when
[1:16:13] the angel of the Lord told him
[1:16:16] this he said that which is conceived in
[1:16:20] her is of the Holy
[1:16:22] Ghost
[1:16:24] see now that was a great
[1:16:27] mystery imagine how many people were
[1:16:30] poking at
[1:16:31] it imagine all the Theologian all the
[1:16:35] Pharisees how they would have their own
[1:16:37] interpretation of what Isaiah n
[1:16:42] was but they never had the
[1:16:45] Revelation but they were
[1:16:47] guessing they didn't know now God
[1:16:51] himself by the Zeal that he he had he
[1:16:54] came down and he revealed his
[1:16:58] word the angel to
[1:17:01] Mary a revelation of the
[1:17:04] word that word was revealed to
[1:17:08] her her womb
[1:17:11] conceived thing that she
[1:17:15] believed amen amen that's the word of
[1:17:17] God at that time it took 400 years this
[1:17:23] for this logos to
[1:17:25] fall for Mary to believe so his word
[1:17:29] could come
[1:17:37] down amen amen that was a
[1:17:42] sign that was the sign that was given to
[1:17:45] Mary so we're moving into a
[1:17:48] Direction I want you to catch a
[1:17:52] vision this son was not just an ordinary
[1:17:56] son so the promise was
[1:17:58] given this is going to be the
[1:18:01] counselor his name is going to be
[1:18:04] wonderful Mighty God Everlasting
[1:18:08] father this is the
[1:18:11] son this is the very thing that was
[1:18:15] prophesied so brother bam says this in
[1:18:18] 1964
[1:18:21] identification we I want to pay
[1:18:23] attention who this son
[1:18:25] is what this son
[1:18:28] does because this is not just a
[1:18:32] son that the denominational system
[1:18:35] today lives in a
[1:18:38] manger and says this is baby
[1:18:42] Jesus and he died for the whole
[1:18:44] world oh and praise
[1:18:47] God where where is the life
[1:18:51] now is he is he just is 2,000 years
[1:18:54] old have we left them
[1:18:57] outside right it's the way of the world
[1:19:01] what they believe today it's among
[1:19:04] us but we know that this son is the life
[1:19:10] tonight amen amen because of the name of
[1:19:13] the Lord Jesus
[1:19:15] Christ so brother brandham is taking
[1:19:18] this in a character and let's watch what
[1:19:19] he says
[1:19:21] here he says what present character do
[1:19:24] you
[1:19:27] have where would you be placed at back
[1:19:30] in them
[1:19:33] days put yourself in that
[1:19:35] picture where would you be placed that
[1:19:38] back in them
[1:19:40] days when Jesus was on
[1:19:44] Earth when the big denominations in
[1:19:47] Theologian was all against
[1:19:50] him and all the teach teachers and
[1:19:53] theologians of that
[1:19:56] day was against
[1:19:58] him all the Bible teachers against
[1:20:03] him against what against the clearcut
[1:20:07] word of that
[1:20:11] age it says being made
[1:20:15] manifest being
[1:20:18] identified God himself
[1:20:21] identified his name Shall be Called
[1:20:25] counselor Prince of
[1:20:27] Peace Mighty
[1:20:29] God the Everlasting father a father it
[1:20:33] says a virgin shall conceive and bear a
[1:20:36] son the government shall be as over his
[1:20:42] shoulders of his kingdom there is no
[1:20:47] end now listen to this who is this
[1:20:51] person it says a baby
[1:20:54] God and then God come becomes a
[1:20:59] man so this word that was
[1:21:02] prophesied the mouth of a prophet he had
[1:21:06] to take
[1:21:08] flesh because God is a respector of
[1:21:11] persons Sorry God is a respector of his
[1:21:15] word not a respector of
[1:21:18] person and when he speaks
[1:21:20] something it's coming to path
[1:21:24] the human mind might not understand
[1:21:26] it the human mind might not catch what
[1:21:28] that
[1:21:30] is but by the revelation of the
[1:21:33] word now we can take
[1:21:37] flesh so he says and then becomes a
[1:21:41] man God becoming a
[1:21:44] man could you imagine Jehovah crying
[1:21:47] like a
[1:21:50] baby could you imagine Jehovah born in a
[1:21:57] barn can you imagine Jehovah playing
[1:21:59] like a
[1:22:01] boy could you imagine a church that's
[1:22:04] claimed to worship Him crucify
[1:22:12] him now what side would you be
[1:22:14] identified
[1:22:16] on now think about what brother brandham
[1:22:18] is
[1:22:21] saying we worship the word the Lord
[1:22:26] God but then by not being submissive to
[1:22:29] the
[1:22:31] word we crucify the
[1:22:34] word and you're no longer worshiping
[1:22:37] him you're bound by a
[1:22:39] Creed you're bound by a
[1:22:42] denomination B by something that's
[1:22:44] keeping
[1:22:46] you cing the very
[1:22:51] word okay it's the same a word was
[1:22:56] spoken God was now manifesting
[1:22:58] it could you imagine a church that's
[1:23:01] claimed to worship Him crucify
[1:23:06] him what side would you be identified
[1:23:10] on it says what the true cut clean cut
[1:23:14] word was was saying
[1:23:19] itself or or says or would you have two
[1:23:22] took your
[1:23:25] Creed your present
[1:23:28] character where would you be
[1:23:31] at now that's it says now that's right
[1:23:35] where you have been seen you have been
[1:23:38] been it says wherever you are right
[1:23:42] now that's what you've been back
[1:23:46] there that's exactly the clearly
[1:23:50] cut so brother brother vam is
[1:23:52] identifying the very
[1:23:55] word and now is is
[1:23:58] given that that it would take flesh it'
[1:24:01] be it'd be clear and
[1:24:03] cut it will not be influenced by so and
[1:24:07] so it will not be influenced by so and
[1:24:09] so but they'll stay with the
[1:24:12] word because they were made that
[1:24:15] way you can't make you can't make a goat
[1:24:19] a
[1:24:21] sheep
[1:24:23] you can't make a dog a
[1:24:27] sheep they're amongst
[1:24:31] USS cheap
[1:24:37] clothing could
[1:24:39] devour think about
[1:24:42] it it's here and God wants a clearcut
[1:24:47] word he doesn't want us to
[1:24:50] waver take one side
[1:24:52] side the other believe
[1:24:56] Genesis and and and and and and not
[1:24:58] believe
[1:25:00] Revelation or or maybe not even believe
[1:25:02] the Testament whatever the excuse may
[1:25:06] be so we know the word of God has is an
[1:25:09] has an
[1:25:11] inheritance if it's
[1:25:13] spoken it has to take flesh and
[1:25:17] somebody there's a lot of ways that the
[1:25:20] word of God takes flesh
[1:25:24] remember there's a
[1:25:26] bride and she has a word that's
[1:25:28] prophesied over
[1:25:31] her and it's that word that actually
[1:25:33] takes her into the condition she needs
[1:25:35] to
[1:25:37] be but then there's this other side
[1:25:40] which are being
[1:25:42] disobedient which are always stepping on
[1:25:44] the word of
[1:25:46] God and they also have a
[1:25:49] promise and the Bible talks about them
[1:25:51] too
[1:25:53] so it's because the word of God already
[1:25:55] knows based upon his
[1:25:58] sovereignty the choice says he's they're
[1:26:00] going to
[1:26:01] make what word applies to
[1:26:04] them okay let's turn to Isaiah
[1:26:08] 11 we're just walking through
[1:26:11] scriptures this is nothing new this is
[1:26:14] something that the prophet
[1:26:16] teaches we're just enjoying the word of
[1:26:21] God
[1:26:22] let's turn to Isaiah
[1:26:34] 11 now this is
[1:26:37] all
[1:26:39] scripture being
[1:26:42] fulfilled this is all scripture being
[1:26:44] fulfilled in the
[1:26:47] sun verse 1 through five and there shall
[1:26:50] come forth a rout out of the stem of
[1:26:55] Jessie and a branch shall grow out of
[1:26:58] his
[1:27:00] roots and the spirit of the Lord shall
[1:27:03] rest upon
[1:27:07] him the spirit of
[1:27:09] wisdom and understanding the spirit of
[1:27:14] counsel and might the spirit of
[1:27:17] knowledge and of fear of the
[1:27:21] Lord
[1:27:23] and shall make him a quick understanding
[1:27:26] in the fear of the
[1:27:29] Lord and he shall not judge after the
[1:27:33] sight of his
[1:27:35] eyes neither reprove after the hearing
[1:27:38] of his
[1:27:40] ears but with
[1:27:42] righteousness shall he judge the
[1:27:45] poor prove with
[1:27:48] equity for the meek of the
[1:27:51] Earth
[1:27:52] and he shall Smite the Earth with the
[1:27:54] rod of his
[1:27:56] mouth and with the breath of his lips
[1:27:59] shall he slay the
[1:28:03] wicked I'm sorry that sounds
[1:28:09] overcoming this is
[1:28:12] overcoming and righteousness shall be
[1:28:15] the girdle of his
[1:28:18] Lo and and and faithfulness the G of his
[1:28:24] rain
[1:28:27] amen but the right he came verse four
[1:28:30] with righteousness shall he judge the
[1:28:33] poor and reprove with equity for the
[1:28:36] meek of the
[1:28:41] earth and he shall Smite the Earth with
[1:28:44] the rod of his
[1:28:46] mouth and with the breath of his lips
[1:28:48] shall he slay the
[1:28:50] Wicked the word of God
[1:28:54] does let's go down to verses 10 to
[1:28:57] 13 we're walking towards the direction I
[1:29:00] want you to see the I want you to see
[1:29:02] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:29:04] and
[1:29:05] forever he never changes he's the same
[1:29:09] so if he did it one way with his word
[1:29:13] for him to be
[1:29:15] just lie he has to do the same
[1:29:19] thing so we have to keep him at his word
[1:29:22] this the word of God
[1:29:25] Amen verse 10 and in that day there
[1:29:29] shall be a root of
[1:29:32] Jesse which shall stand for INS sign of
[1:29:35] the
[1:29:37] people it says to it the Gentiles shall
[1:29:41] seek and his rest shall be
[1:29:45] glorious and it shall come to pass in
[1:29:47] that
[1:29:49] day that the Lord shall set his his
[1:29:52] right hand his right uh his hand again
[1:29:56] on the second time to
[1:30:00] recover the remnant of his
[1:30:03] people which shall be left from Assyria
[1:30:07] and from Egypt and from patrus and from
[1:30:10] Kush and from Elam and from Shar and
[1:30:13] from Hamad and from from the islands of
[1:30:16] the
[1:30:17] sea and he shall set up an insight for
[1:30:20] the Nations
[1:30:23] and shall assemble the outcast of
[1:30:26] Israel and gather and gather together
[1:30:29] the dispersed of
[1:30:32] Judah from the four corners of the
[1:30:36] Earth the Envy of
[1:30:40] Ephraim shall
[1:30:42] depart and the adversaries of Judah
[1:30:44] shall be cut
[1:30:46] off shall not envy
[1:30:50] Judah Judah shall not Vex
[1:30:54] ephra so the word of God is a seed and
[1:30:57] he possesses
[1:31:01] inheritance as we were just reading the
[1:31:03] word of God is
[1:31:05] poken there a group of people that have
[1:31:07] been predestinated to catch
[1:31:11] that to catch the word
[1:31:13] seed to believe upon it and to come into
[1:31:17] the very
[1:31:19] image of that word was to produce
[1:31:23] the word was given about
[1:31:25] Jesus that that a virgin shall
[1:31:30] conceive I'm sure people were thinking
[1:31:32] that was going to be
[1:31:35] impossible it never been has never been
[1:31:39] done in the whole creation of the world
[1:31:42] how can somebody become
[1:31:47] impregnated without a
[1:31:50] relation impossible
[1:31:52] how can we have a transformation of our
[1:31:56] body how is it that we could have a
[1:31:59] Rapture something that our minds cannot
[1:32:03] understand but a word has been
[1:32:05] spoken his expression has already been
[1:32:09] said and now there's a bride and this
[1:32:13] bride catches the seed of the
[1:32:16] word and she manifestes that very
[1:32:20] word because it for
[1:32:23] her it was only for
[1:32:25] her it was for nobody else but for
[1:32:29] her so when the angel came to
[1:32:33] her she believed them upon his
[1:32:36] word that's where the word of God
[1:32:39] does the prophecy was
[1:32:41] given it took that
[1:32:44] long for that word to become
[1:32:47] flesh 50 60 100
[1:32:50] 200 300 nothing happened
[1:32:54] 400 people were already becoming
[1:32:58] religious
[1:33:00] true I mean they might have read the
[1:33:02] word of God they might have read the
[1:33:04] message of the
[1:33:06] hour but they were just
[1:33:08] religious they were doing things because
[1:33:10] they were told
[1:33:12] to motivating them to do what was given
[1:33:15] to them to
[1:33:17] do because God is love
[1:33:23] am and God is
[1:33:26] love because of this
[1:33:29] promise that's why God is
[1:33:32] love he promised the
[1:33:35] son the first one fell the second the
[1:33:38] second one came to redeem
[1:33:40] us and he says I'm not trusting nobody
[1:33:44] else coming down I coming down in the
[1:33:49] Sun and this is not just for for me but
[1:33:53] this is also for the ones that are
[1:33:54] inside of
[1:33:56] me because the same spirit that he had
[1:33:59] he gave to his
[1:34:01] bride the Holy Ghost overshadowed
[1:34:06] Mary God that created himself life
[1:34:09] inside of
[1:34:11] Mary it was God that created himself
[1:34:14] into part of the Bride of who she
[1:34:18] is this is not no man's work
[1:34:22] there's no man involved in this this is
[1:34:25] not God and God is a spirit and they
[1:34:29] that worship Him worship Him in spirit
[1:34:32] and in
[1:34:34] truth he's a
[1:34:38] spirit amen Amen brother bam says this
[1:34:43] adoption I want you to catch the vision
[1:34:45] of the
[1:34:47] word this is
[1:34:50] sunship
[1:34:53] this is
[1:34:55] sunship he came down to live in a
[1:34:59] son to find pleasure to live inside of
[1:35:04] him you know Hebrews 116 says
[1:35:10] this for it is impossible to please
[1:35:14] God without
[1:35:17] faith God wants to be faithful to you
[1:35:22] he wants you to to depend and be
[1:35:24] faithful to
[1:35:26] him two-way
[1:35:28] relationship don't expect for him to
[1:35:30] give you
[1:35:31] everything and now there's no dedication
[1:35:34] on your
[1:35:35] side that's
[1:35:37] religion that's religion Lord I I I'm
[1:35:42] sorry can you give me today uh maybe I'm
[1:35:46] too
[1:35:48] busy I'm sorry a lot of people pray
[1:35:52] we have to be real with ourself with
[1:35:53] ourselves
[1:35:55] Saints there's a lot of there's a lot of
[1:35:58] traditions
[1:35:59] outside there's a lot of lies
[1:36:02] outside there's a lot of ways of
[1:36:05] deception
[1:36:06] outside the way is
[1:36:08] Big there's a lot of
[1:36:11] followers but few are there that find a
[1:36:14] path and it's the one that leads to
[1:36:18] life and it creates sacrifice
[1:36:22] that's right it's a daily
[1:36:24] sacrifice it's a daily
[1:36:30] death it says
[1:36:33] now it says but it was it says it was
[1:36:36] such a great thing in that
[1:36:40] inheritance how it was an inheritance of
[1:36:43] the
[1:36:44] land that no one else but a close
[1:36:48] kidsman could redeem that inheritance
[1:36:55] he says now let us drop a little token
[1:36:57] here that I touched on the other
[1:37:03] night how many of you has prayed for
[1:37:05] your loved
[1:37:07] ones it says all right there you are
[1:37:10] again your
[1:37:12] inheritance Paul the old
[1:37:15] Roman says believed on the Lord Jesus
[1:37:20] Christ it says and thou and thy house
[1:37:23] shall be
[1:37:25] saved if you've got enough faith enough
[1:37:28] for your own
[1:37:31] self have enough Faith No matter how
[1:37:34] Wayward that boy
[1:37:36] is or that girl is will be saved
[1:37:42] anyhow God somehow if he has to lay them
[1:37:46] on their
[1:37:47] back laying there in the hospital dying
[1:37:51] be saved God promises The
[1:37:56] Inheritance and it says and they shall
[1:37:58] be there said Isaiah as all their
[1:38:03] offsprings with
[1:38:06] them they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[1:38:09] all the Holy Mountain sayth the
[1:38:15] Lord the protection of the
[1:38:18] word the inheritance of the word
[1:38:24] good amen amen
[1:38:27] hallelujah we're inheritors
[1:38:30] Saints it's time to play games it's it's
[1:38:33] time to stop playing
[1:38:35] games the Lord is really looking for a
[1:38:39] genuine bride that wants to be word of
[1:38:42] his word Spirit of spirit of his flesh
[1:38:47] light of his
[1:38:48] light he she needs to be the light of
[1:38:51] this
[1:38:53] hour before you know it you see all
[1:38:55] these goats just started getting into
[1:38:57] the
[1:38:59] message and you realize it just made
[1:39:01] things just traditional
[1:39:04] anymore and there's no more
[1:39:06] sincerity there's no more
[1:39:09] sincerity if people were to be sincere
[1:39:11] with
[1:39:15] themselves oh my where would we be this
[1:39:18] day but the pride of a man
[1:39:21] could always stop a man from seeing the
[1:39:23] revelation of the
[1:39:28] word a son was
[1:39:30] given unto us a son was
[1:39:34] given now this is an eternal
[1:39:38] son he's a
[1:39:40] Kinsman so the very word that now has
[1:39:43] already been fulfilled by the prophet
[1:39:46] Isaiah remember you were in
[1:39:49] it you were already there
[1:39:52] you might have not been born but you
[1:39:54] were already there because it was a
[1:39:57] promised
[1:39:58] word and and brother brandham draws a a
[1:40:01] beautiful
[1:40:05] description on the place where this son
[1:40:07] was
[1:40:10] born and he I just listened to this the
[1:40:12] other night and it was such a blessing
[1:40:14] for
[1:40:16] me he he preaches this in Phoenix pH
[1:40:21] why little
[1:40:24] Bethlehem and just listen to this this
[1:40:26] is it says and the name Bethlehem
[1:40:30] [Music]
[1:40:31] means now just think about this this
[1:40:35] word this very
[1:40:38] promise this very promise that has been
[1:40:41] just traveling over and over and
[1:40:44] over now was taking
[1:40:47] flesh and it was more than just a place
[1:40:51] listen to this it says the name
[1:40:53] Bethlehem
[1:40:56] means the house of God's
[1:40:59] bread how fitting that is with
[1:41:03] Jesus it says the bread of eternal
[1:41:06] life Christ is the bread of
[1:41:09] life we all believe that don't
[1:41:12] we feeding Bethlehem
[1:41:15] there the bread center of the
[1:41:18] world was the bread Center of eternal
[1:41:22] life that's why the king had to be born
[1:41:26] there John 3
[1:41:29] 6:35 I am the bread of life that come
[1:41:32] out from from God out of
[1:41:35] Heaven your fathers did eat man in the
[1:41:39] wilderness
[1:41:40] all but this bread if a man eats of this
[1:41:45] bread he shall live
[1:41:48] forever then Jesus is the bread of
[1:41:52] life so the bread of life had to come at
[1:41:57] Bethlehem he is our bread of life for
[1:42:01] the journey like Israel God gave Israel
[1:42:05] bread out of the
[1:42:07] sky for their Journey at their Journey
[1:42:10] from the left of
[1:42:12] Egypt the promised
[1:42:14] land it says bread
[1:42:18] nightly rain down from the skies
[1:42:22] and God gave us the bread of life for
[1:42:24] our
[1:42:26] journey come at
[1:42:28] Bethlehem the it says God's house
[1:42:32] bread it must be where that name is
[1:42:35] called
[1:42:37] Bethlehem the house of God's
[1:42:40] bread amen amen amen so now it was just
[1:42:44] more than just a place of him being
[1:42:49] born
[1:42:52] this was the bread of
[1:42:54] life this son was going to be more than
[1:42:59] just a little baby that was just born
[1:43:02] that lived in their
[1:43:04] midst this was God humbling
[1:43:08] himself that he didn't even have a place
[1:43:11] to lay his
[1:43:13] head
[1:43:15] man and to overcome this
[1:43:18] world a perfect sacrif
[1:43:22] a perfect
[1:43:23] word submissive to the word of
[1:43:26] God God by his word will found pleasure
[1:43:29] to live inside
[1:43:32] of the bread of
[1:43:34] life amen amen so let's turn to Luke
[1:43:38] chapter
[1:43:39] 1 we're walking we're walking into a
[1:43:43] direction and I want I want you to see
[1:43:46] what this bread
[1:43:47] is how this bread came
[1:43:51] how the word was now
[1:43:54] fulfilling because we have to see that
[1:43:57] Jesus Christ is the same yes today today
[1:43:59] and
[1:44:01] forever so I'm sure we all know the
[1:44:08] story I believe from from verses 2 to
[1:44:11] about 10 the angel comes to
[1:44:15] zachari he reveals to him that he's
[1:44:17] going to have a son he was a priest
[1:44:21] he was doing his
[1:44:22] duty and the angel came to him Angel
[1:44:26] Gabriel and gave him a
[1:44:29] promise and Zachariah believed that
[1:44:31] promise for six
[1:44:34] months he didn't tell nobody he held it
[1:44:38] his wife Elizabeth was
[1:44:40] pregnant she was already now six months
[1:44:44] nobody knew about
[1:44:45] it the word of God coming individually
[1:44:48] to every believer
[1:44:52] and think about this because this was at
[1:44:54] the same
[1:44:55] time that the very word the very
[1:44:59] son is coming to fulfillment at the same
[1:45:03] time they're right behind each
[1:45:06] other so John the Baptist was
[1:45:09] prophesied he already took
[1:45:12] flesh and now here comes the son
[1:45:15] following
[1:45:17] him and and they they Elizabeth the Mary
[1:45:20] were
[1:45:22] cousins so let's just let's just walk
[1:45:24] through this beautiful story as we're
[1:45:25] just
[1:45:26] walking what sunship
[1:45:30] means
[1:45:32] amen verse
[1:45:34] 10 and the whole multitude of the people
[1:45:37] were praying without at the time of the
[1:45:40] in
[1:45:44] incense and there appeared unto him an
[1:45:47] angel of the lower standing at the right
[1:45:49] side of the altar of in
[1:45:54] and when Zarah saw
[1:45:56] him he was
[1:45:58] troubled and fear fell upon
[1:46:02] him you know Saints I was talking to
[1:46:04] brother Daniel
[1:46:06] today it's coming to a point where
[1:46:09] people don't have fear of the word of
[1:46:11] the Lord
[1:46:14] anymore of the
[1:46:17] word because God has a fear like that
[1:46:21] and look at this it says when Zachariah
[1:46:24] saw
[1:46:26] him were troubled and fear fell upon
[1:46:29] him but the angel said unto him fear not
[1:46:34] Zarah for thy prayer is
[1:46:37] heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear
[1:46:40] thee a
[1:46:42] son and thou shalt call his name
[1:46:46] John and thou sh have joy and
[1:46:49] gladness and many shall rejoice of his
[1:46:55] birth and that was the
[1:46:57] truth can we testify that about John the
[1:47:00] Baptist his
[1:47:03] commission but there came a point where
[1:47:05] John the Baptist
[1:47:07] said I must
[1:47:09] decrease so he can increase you
[1:47:13] recognize the word on the
[1:47:16] scene he was a great he he had a great
[1:47:19] ministry and it says and many shall
[1:47:21] rejoice at his
[1:47:24] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[1:47:27] of the
[1:47:28] Lord and shall drink neither wine nor
[1:47:32] strong
[1:47:33] drink and he shall be filled with the
[1:47:36] Holy
[1:47:37] Ghost even from his mother's
[1:47:41] womb and many of the children of Israel
[1:47:44] shall be turned to the Lord their
[1:47:49] God
[1:47:52] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[1:47:54] and power of
[1:47:58] Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:48:00] to the
[1:48:02] children and the disobedient to the
[1:48:05] wisdom to of the
[1:48:08] just and make ready a people prepared
[1:48:11] for the
[1:48:15] Lord okay so this was the ministry of
[1:48:17] John the
[1:48:18] Baptist this was the the ministry of the
[1:48:21] restoration of the faith
[1:48:24] again the spirit of Elijah was always a
[1:48:26] spirit of
[1:48:29] restoration once the children of God
[1:48:31] started going
[1:48:34] astray here comes the spirit of
[1:48:36] Elijah turning them right
[1:48:39] back turning them right
[1:48:43] back and so the ministry of John the
[1:48:48] Baptist he was to prepare a people for
[1:48:51] for it says to make ready a people
[1:48:54] prepared for the
[1:48:57] Lord and Zachariah said unto the
[1:49:00] angel whereby shall I know
[1:49:04] this here here he is just like Abraham
[1:49:07] Saints he was an old
[1:49:10] priest he was stricken in
[1:49:12] age he he you know his his health might
[1:49:15] have been probably not so
[1:49:19] good in
[1:49:22] age here comes another
[1:49:24] promise now let me ask you
[1:49:27] this Zacharias
[1:49:29] knew the story of Abraham he was a
[1:49:33] priest he knew who the faith of his
[1:49:35] father
[1:49:37] was so he had in his heart that if he
[1:49:40] did it with Abraham which was the word
[1:49:43] yesterday he can do it today
[1:49:46] too because it was by a divine
[1:49:49] revelation
[1:49:50] an angel came down and gave him a
[1:49:54] promise and he knew amen he
[1:50:00] knew it says for I am an old man and my
[1:50:04] wife was stricken in
[1:50:06] years and the angel answering said unto
[1:50:09] him I am
[1:50:13] Gabriel that stand in the presence of
[1:50:16] God and I am sent to speak unto thee
[1:50:21] and to show thee these Glad
[1:50:25] Tidings and behold Thou shalt be
[1:50:28] dumb and not be able to speak until the
[1:50:32] day that these things shall be
[1:50:36] performed because thou believest not my
[1:50:39] words which shall be fulfilled in their
[1:50:44] season my and the people waited for
[1:50:49] Zacharias
[1:50:51] and marveled that he carried so long in
[1:50:53] the
[1:50:55] temple and when he came out he could not
[1:50:59] speak unto them and they perceived that
[1:51:02] he had not he had seen a vision in the
[1:51:06] temple for he beckoned unto them and
[1:51:10] remained
[1:51:13] speechless and remain
[1:51:15] speechless so you see now the word came
[1:51:17] to
[1:51:18] Zachariah
[1:51:20] the prophet was now being fulfilled in
[1:51:22] Zacharias and his
[1:51:24] wife the word was now taken
[1:51:27] flesh was bringing the spirit of
[1:51:30] restoration it was now bringing the the
[1:51:34] preparation the the the the the to make
[1:51:37] her
[1:51:37] ready to restore her faith so that way
[1:51:41] when he's on the
[1:51:42] scene Ministry was to
[1:51:45] start would already be
[1:51:48] prepared
[1:51:50] because now she was the word of
[1:51:52] God she knew the truth she knew him by
[1:51:56] his
[1:51:58] attributes knew him by who he
[1:52:01] was amen amen he was revealing to
[1:52:10] her verse
[1:52:13] 23 and it came to pass that as soon as
[1:52:17] the days of his Min ministration were
[1:52:20] accomplished he departed to his own
[1:52:25] house and after those days his wife
[1:52:27] Elizabeth
[1:52:30] conceived and H hid herself five months
[1:52:37] saying thus had the Lord dealt with me
[1:52:39] in the days wherein he looked on
[1:52:45] me to take away my reproach among men
[1:52:51] and in the sixth
[1:52:53] month the angel
[1:52:56] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[1:52:59] Galilee named
[1:53:01] Nazareth here comes the ministry of
[1:53:05] Jesus here's the introduction now of
[1:53:07] this son being
[1:53:10] born so now the spirit of restoration
[1:53:14] came the prophecy took flesh it was in
[1:53:18] the process of manif
[1:53:21] estation it had to obey every
[1:53:24] footstep it had to follow every word it
[1:53:27] had to manifest what he was
[1:53:29] from and here comes the ministry of
[1:53:38] Jesus and he departed to his own house
[1:53:41] okay verse 24 and after those days his
[1:53:44] wife Elizabeth
[1:53:46] conceived I'm sorry here we
[1:53:48] go
[1:53:52] thus
[1:53:53] 26 and in the sixth month the angel
[1:53:57] Gabriel was sent from God into a city of
[1:53:59] Galilee named
[1:54:03] Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man
[1:54:07] whose name was
[1:54:09] Joseph of the House of David and the
[1:54:12] virgin's name was
[1:54:14] Mary and the angel came in unto
[1:54:18] her said hail thou are highly
[1:54:24] favored the Lord is with youe blessed
[1:54:28] are thou among
[1:54:29] women I want to tell you
[1:54:32] tonight that thou are heartly favored
[1:54:37] bride don't ever let go of the position
[1:54:39] and who you
[1:54:41] are you are the very thing he came for
[1:54:45] you are his very life that he identified
[1:54:48] with
[1:54:50] identify with the word of God that was
[1:54:53] highly
[1:54:56] favored and the Lord is with thee
[1:54:59] blessed are thou among
[1:55:02] women and when she saw
[1:55:06] him she was troubled at his
[1:55:08] saying and cast in her mind what matter
[1:55:12] of salutation this should
[1:55:15] be and the angel said unto her if Fe not
[1:55:19] married
[1:55:20] for thou Hast found favor with
[1:55:23] God and
[1:55:25] behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:55:29] womb and bring forth a
[1:55:33] son and shall call his name
[1:55:36] Jesus and he shall be great and he shall
[1:55:40] be called the son of the
[1:55:42] highest and the Lord shall give unto him
[1:55:45] the Throne of his father
[1:55:48] David
[1:55:50] confirming
[1:55:51] scripture and he shall reign over the
[1:55:54] house of Jacob
[1:55:56] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[1:55:59] be no
[1:56:01] end then said Mary unto the
[1:56:05] angel now imagine at all these
[1:56:09] sayings it troubled Mary she probably
[1:56:12] didn't understand
[1:56:15] it it was probably too much for her she
[1:56:18] was probably trying to
[1:56:20] understand oh what's going
[1:56:22] on how is this going to come to pass how
[1:56:25] is this word going to be fulfilled
[1:56:27] inside of
[1:56:29] me how am I going to go to this body
[1:56:32] change how am I going to be able to
[1:56:34] overcome all these all these things
[1:56:36] around
[1:56:37] me how am I going I ever come out of the
[1:56:40] condition that I'm
[1:56:41] in but she had the right
[1:56:45] attitude and she
[1:56:47] said it says
[1:56:54] verse
[1:56:56] 34 then said Mary unto the angel thou
[1:56:59] shal thou thou how sh this be saying
[1:57:03] that I have seen no
[1:57:06] man and the angel answered and said unto
[1:57:10] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[1:57:15] thee and the power of the highest shall
[1:57:17] overshadow thee
[1:57:20] therefore also the holy thing which
[1:57:23] shall be born of the shall be called The
[1:57:27] Son of
[1:57:28] God and behold that cousin
[1:57:32] Elizabeth she had also conceived the son
[1:57:35] in her old
[1:57:37] age so look he's making the Revelation
[1:57:41] to her of what just happened six months
[1:57:44] ago that nobody
[1:57:47] knew this was between Zachariah and
[1:57:50] Elizabeth but the angel revealed to her
[1:57:54] what was
[1:57:55] coming amen
[1:58:00] amen she had also conceived the son in
[1:58:03] her old
[1:58:05] age and this is the sixth month with
[1:58:08] her who was called
[1:58:11] Barren for it for with God nothing shall
[1:58:15] be
[1:58:17] impossible and Mary said
[1:58:20] behold the handmade of the
[1:58:22] Lord look at her
[1:58:24] attitude be it unto me according to Thy
[1:58:29] word and the angel departed from
[1:58:32] her
[1:58:34] amen she was given a
[1:58:37] promise the word of God revealed to her
[1:58:40] what was
[1:58:41] coming now she knew and she was going
[1:58:44] now back to to to her cousin
[1:58:48] Elizabeth and she already knew now
[1:58:51] remember this was with the
[1:58:55] purpose this was with a purpose and look
[1:58:58] at the power of the
[1:59:00] word because if you follow the story all
[1:59:02] the way
[1:59:04] through as soon as this promise now was
[1:59:07] coming upon
[1:59:08] Mary as soon as the son now was going to
[1:59:11] come into the image that he was needing
[1:59:12] to come
[1:59:15] under God was confirming it bringing it
[1:59:19] to pass so she now goes to her cousin
[1:59:25] Elizabeth and she starts
[1:59:27] testifying and starts saying the angel
[1:59:30] visited
[1:59:31] me and I should tell you oh the son of
[1:59:35] God's coming his name's going to be
[1:59:38] Emmanuel you see maybe like I was saying
[1:59:40] in
[1:59:42] Isaiah be that I see no
[1:59:46] man God's bringing his promise to pass
[1:59:51] and I said let Let It Be according to
[1:59:54] the um and and and I said let it be let
[1:59:58] it be unto me according to Thy
[2:00:02] word and his name Shall be Called
[2:00:07] Jesus now remember when that name was
[2:00:11] called John the
[2:00:13] Baptist started
[2:00:16] moving he was baptized with the Holy
[2:00:18] Ghost
[2:00:19] life gave inside of him because that's
[2:00:22] what the prophecy was that from his
[2:00:25] mother's womb he shall already have the
[2:00:26] Holy
[2:00:28] go so it took the it took the name of
[2:00:32] Jesus it took the name of the son that
[2:00:34] was
[2:00:35] coming to be able to to be able to
[2:00:37] fulfill the promise to John the
[2:00:40] Baptist he can fulfill the word of the
[2:00:44] hour think about
[2:00:47] that every every knee shall

[2:00:58] Christ
[2:01:00] amen Jesus Christ is the word he's the
[2:01:06] same yesterday today and forever there's
[2:01:09] no other
[2:01:10] way so now this word was
[2:01:13] coming in
[2:01:16] fulfillment every day that word had to
[2:01:21] believe that that was its
[2:01:25] manifestation could you imagine like the
[2:01:28] could you imagine like the prophet was
[2:01:29] reading
[2:01:31] earlier Jehovah God as a child scraping
[2:01:34] his
[2:01:37] knee Jehovah God like a man being
[2:01:43] hungry he knew what it was like to be
[2:01:46] bound by the by the things of this world
[2:01:50] but he overcome them because he was a he
[2:01:53] was a full
[2:01:55] son the fullness of God was already in
[2:01:59] him he was the one that was
[2:02:02] overcoming amen amen now remember this
[2:02:07] as all this was
[2:02:09] happening you the Bride of Jesus
[2:02:12] Christ in the same
[2:02:14] promise that's why it's a finished
[2:02:17] work you were already in that
[2:02:20] promise it might have been happening
[2:02:22] 2,000 years
[2:02:24] ago but we were already in that
[2:02:27] promise we're just waiting for our
[2:02:31] hour so we can fulfill the
[2:02:34] word we be obedient to the word of
[2:02:37] God we be that sunship that he wants us
[2:02:39] to
[2:02:40] [Music]
[2:02:41] be amen that's what Mary did she
[2:02:45] believed the
[2:02:47] Lord now could you imagine imagine how
[2:02:49] many people were were were looking down
[2:02:51] on
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:55] her imagine imagine this baby boy
[2:02:58] running
[2:03:00] around going into the temple coming into
[2:03:03] a church
[2:03:05] service and all of a sudden they like
[2:03:07] yeah that's that son man he was the one
[2:03:09] that was born of the
[2:03:11] Virgin imagine the attitude of the
[2:03:14] people they were so
[2:03:16] religious that the act that God decided
[2:03:19] to come
[2:03:20] in they miss that that was the very
[2:03:23] thing that happened in the
[2:03:26] beginning they were so ound by the
[2:03:29] laws and so
[2:03:32] traditionalized that they missed
[2:03:35] him the simple word come in the
[2:03:38] past the small things of God for the
[2:03:43] elect are very
[2:03:46] important because she walks by the word
[2:03:48] of God
[2:03:50] she does nothing until she has the sayth
[2:03:52] the
[2:03:53] Lord now she can have that
[2:03:56] individual that's individual because the
[2:03:59] word of God is
[2:04:01] personal he reveals to you
[2:04:05] personally we can be here preaching the
[2:04:07] gospel for hours we can to 1 2 3:00 in
[2:04:11] the
[2:04:12] morning if there's not something inside
[2:04:14] of you like a connection like a receiver
[2:04:19] that will be able to connect to God and
[2:04:22] receive the life of the revelated word
[2:04:25] it does Nothing To Us Saint it has to be
[2:04:28] revealed it has to be
[2:04:31] shown and once that word takes
[2:04:34] flesh now we manifest
[2:04:37] it
[2:04:42] amen The First Time The Name of Jesus
[2:04:44] was
[2:04:46] used life took place
[2:04:52] life took
[2:04:58] place I want to read some
[2:05:00] quotes I I hope I hope I hope this is a
[2:05:03] blessing for you
[2:05:06] tonight this is just the ABC
[2:05:09] Saints this is what I love I love I love
[2:05:13] the pure
[2:05:15] gospel if I want if I want to Fellowship
[2:05:18] on something I wanted to be the pure
[2:05:20] gospel it's already here for us all we
[2:05:23] have to do is look in between the
[2:05:26] lines we have to look in between the
[2:05:28] lines because there's a
[2:05:30] relationship once we look between the
[2:05:33] lines we understand God now we can now
[2:05:37] we can understand what God is expecting
[2:05:39] of
[2:05:40] us and I want to do all that God has
[2:05:43] planned for me to
[2:05:45] do if it's for me to be a
[2:05:47] doorm that's what I want to
[2:05:50] be because I find pleasure being that
[2:05:54] door what God created me to
[2:05:59] be
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:03] amen so this sunship unto us a son was
[2:06:07] given son Eternal
[2:06:11] son and you were there remember that six
[2:06:16] months before brother Braham says this
[2:06:18] here 19 59 we're just going to walk
[2:06:20] through a few paragraphs of brother Bram
[2:06:22] just describing
[2:06:25] a six months before that he met
[2:06:28] Zacharias the priest at the
[2:06:32] temple and he was an aged
[2:06:34] man and had read the
[2:06:37] scriptures and he had taught the
[2:06:40] scriptures and because he was an old and
[2:06:43] his wife was
[2:06:45] Barren the angel the same Ang told him I
[2:06:51] love
[2:06:53] that because brother brandham here
[2:06:56] sometimes speaks in that Dimension
[2:06:59] right he says the angel and then he says
[2:07:02] the same
[2:07:03] Angel this is the same Angel he
[2:07:06] recognizes told him that after the days
[2:07:09] of his ministration at the
[2:07:13] altar waving the incense over the
[2:07:16] people's
[2:07:17] prayers
[2:07:20] that when he went home his wife would
[2:07:22] conceive and bear
[2:07:28] child and that preacher questioned the
[2:07:32] angel how can it be I'm old and my wife
[2:07:37] is
[2:07:39] old he had plenty of examples in the
[2:07:43] Bible there had been Hannah at now think
[2:07:46] about
[2:07:46] this because the word word of God is the
[2:07:51] same he had a testimony he already had a
[2:07:54] word that was already
[2:07:57] accomplished so here he is he says there
[2:08:01] had been Hannah at the
[2:08:03] temple they had Samuel the prophet after
[2:08:06] was
[2:08:07] old and there had been
[2:08:10] Sarah brought for Isaac after she was
[2:08:13] nearly a hundred years
[2:08:16] old and here this little woman had had
[2:08:18] to believe something that had never
[2:08:22] happened a woman having a baby without
[2:08:25] knowing any
[2:08:28] man she said how shall these things be
[2:08:31] my
[2:08:33] Lord he said the Holy Ghost shall
[2:08:36] overshadow
[2:08:38] thee and the holy ghost thing that will
[2:08:40] be born from
[2:08:42] you will be called The Son of
[2:08:45] God it says watch her she didn't
[2:08:49] question
[2:08:50] that she said behold the handmaids of
[2:08:53] the
[2:08:55] Lord be unto me according to Thy
[2:08:58] word if we can just do
[2:09:02] that you see that's the only thing
[2:09:05] that's what God
[2:09:06] loves that's the only way to get right
[2:09:10] with
[2:09:12] God to take him at his
[2:09:15] word the only way that there is to
[2:09:17] please God is to take his
[2:09:22] word don't trust your
[2:09:24] knowledge your reason how can it be done
[2:09:28] cannot be done when you reason then you
[2:09:32] lose the
[2:09:33] victory we must cast down all
[2:09:39] reasoning and believe what God has said
[2:09:41] to be the
[2:09:43] truth Mary took him at his
[2:09:46] word and he changed changed the whole
[2:09:48] course of her natural
[2:09:51] life
[2:09:54] amen Mary took him at his word and he
[2:09:58] changed the whole nature of her
[2:10:01] life and he will change the course of
[2:10:04] our
[2:10:06] life tonight if you just take him at his
[2:10:10] word says if you're sin get straighten
[2:10:13] with it says get straighten that crooked
[2:10:15] life out of
[2:10:17] yours
[2:10:19] if you're vile and
[2:10:21] immoral he will make you as pure as a
[2:10:23] lily if you just take him at his
[2:10:27] word it says the bi conscience that of
[2:10:30] sin that makes you look at immoral
[2:10:36] things and use the name of the Lord in
[2:10:39] vain have temper enough to fight above
[2:10:45] sa he will change the course of life
[2:10:50] for you and make you a new creature in
[2:10:53] his son Jesus
[2:10:56] Christ by just taking him as his
[2:10:59] word amen amen it says if you have
[2:11:02] cancer
[2:11:03] tonight he will change that and give you
[2:11:07] health if you have tubercules or
[2:11:11] sickness where the doctors cannot help
[2:11:15] you he will change that for you if
[2:11:17] you'll just take him at his
[2:11:20] word is
[2:11:22] word and I am the Lord thy God that
[2:11:25] heals all thy
[2:11:28] disease it says how glorious and
[2:11:30] marvelous our lord Jesus
[2:11:33] is now as soon as the angel told her
[2:11:37] about her
[2:11:39] cousin and she accepted the Lord the
[2:11:43] Lord's will to be
[2:11:45] done the only thing she know would
[2:11:50] happen listen to this that the Holy
[2:11:53] Spirit was going to do
[2:11:56] it she
[2:11:58] depended the word of
[2:12:03] God the Holy Spirit was going to do it
[2:12:07] the Zeal of
[2:12:10] God because he came god with
[2:12:15] us so God above us
[2:12:19] God With
[2:12:20] Us God in us this is what the prophet
[2:12:24] says above us God With Us and God in
[2:12:35] us the Holy Spirit was going to do
[2:12:38] it oh if we can get that settled in our
[2:12:43] hearts how can a cancer be cured when
[2:12:45] the doctors give it up
[2:12:49] it's not to me to try to figure it
[2:12:52] out it takes the word of the Holy
[2:12:56] Spirit he was the one who made the
[2:13:00] promise he's the one who confirms that
[2:13:03] promise he's obligated to keep that
[2:13:08] promise and I want you to notice another
[2:13:10] thing about
[2:13:12] Mary she did not wait till she was
[2:13:16] positive she didn't wait till she felt
[2:13:20] life or physical sign that she was going
[2:13:23] to have the baby before she said
[2:13:26] anything about it she just took
[2:13:28] it God's word was good enough for her
[2:13:32] and she started rejoicing right
[2:13:37] away the angel came gave her the promise
[2:13:41] she accepted the promise she said let it
[2:13:44] be to me according to thy
[2:13:46] will from moment on she was obedient to
[2:13:49] the word of
[2:13:50] God nothing would take her out of the
[2:13:53] way she stayed with the word of
[2:13:56] God
[2:13:58] Amen and she started rejoicing right
[2:14:03] away 1962 the spoken word is the
[2:14:06] original
[2:14:09] SE so I want you to catch this you see
[2:14:12] how beautiful the word
[2:14:13] is he's always been the same yesterday
[2:14:16] today and
[2:14:18] it's
[2:14:19] simple but people sometimes just
[2:14:21] complicate
[2:14:23] it it they they take it out of
[2:14:26] context they start they start messing
[2:14:28] with that and and and just put their own
[2:14:30] thoughts in
[2:14:31] it but the word of God is
[2:14:36] simple the word of God is simple take
[2:14:39] him at his word if he said it he will do
[2:14:44] it because he has an infallible record
[2:14:47] he never
[2:14:49] failed he's always accomplished his
[2:14:54] word spoken word is the Original
[2:14:56] Seed it says the first
[2:14:59] son was the is a spoken seed words of
[2:15:08] God the first son was a spoken seed word
[2:15:13] of
[2:15:16] God
[2:15:19] he was given a
[2:15:20] bride I'm just reviewing the
[2:15:26] spirit and I and I was just picking that
[2:15:28] up here as I
[2:15:31] said it says a bride to produce
[2:15:36] himself see that's what the bride was
[2:15:41] given to produce himself again another
[2:15:45] Son of God but she fell by
[2:15:51] hybriding produced
[2:15:54] himself but she fell she caused him to
[2:15:59] die okay so we're walking
[2:16:01] together you understand what the prophet
[2:16:04] saying
[2:16:06] here oh amen amen the Second
[2:16:10] Son a spoken seed word of God was given
[2:16:14] a bride like
[2:16:16] Adam
[2:16:19] before he could marry
[2:16:21] her she had fallen
[2:16:24] also for she was put to a free moral
[2:16:27] agency like Adam's wife
[2:16:30] was to believe God's word and
[2:16:35] live or she doubted and
[2:16:39] die and she and and she
[2:16:41] did now listen to
[2:16:44] this then from a little group of a true
[2:16:47] seed of of the word of
[2:16:51] God it says God will present Christ a
[2:16:54] beloved
[2:16:58] bride a virgin a virgin of his
[2:17:03] word it says and through
[2:17:06] them and by them will be fulfilled all
[2:17:11] that he has promised for his word in the
[2:17:16] virgin
[2:17:20] who knows no manmade Creeds of
[2:17:24] dogmas it says the Word of Promise in
[2:17:27] her in himself as it was in
[2:17:33] Mary God made
[2:17:35] himself God himself made
[2:17:40] manifest he will act
[2:17:43] himself by his own Word of Promise
[2:17:48] so to fulfill that all that has been
[2:17:51] written of
[2:17:53] him amen we catch that amen it says and
[2:17:58] as he did when she when he came from the
[2:18:00] Virgin
[2:18:04] womb type of the spirit womb
[2:18:08] now so will the Virgin now accepting his
[2:18:13] word be it unto me as thou Hast said
[2:18:18] though it was said by an
[2:18:20] Angel it was written
[2:18:23] word Isaiah 96 they will love
[2:18:27] him and will his
[2:18:30] potentials and he is their
[2:18:33] head and they are his
[2:18:36] subject subjects to his head headship of
[2:18:40] Christ was
[2:18:41] his now notice what
[2:18:45] Harmony Jesus never did anything
[2:18:47] anything until he has seen the father
[2:18:50] show him
[2:18:53] first Harmony between God and
[2:18:57] Christ John
[2:19:00] 519 so will the
[2:19:04] bride that he shows her his word of
[2:19:09] life he shows
[2:19:12] her and she receives it and she never
[2:19:16] doubts it nothing can harm
[2:19:19] her not even death for if the seed be
[2:19:23] planted of the water will raise it up
[2:19:27] again now think about
[2:19:30] that because the seed of God is the word
[2:19:34] of God and if you are the word of God
[2:19:38] you will receive nothing but the word of
[2:19:42] God that's why it's important to stay in
[2:19:44] the word of
[2:19:46] God if you're in the word of God you
[2:19:49] start identifying with the
[2:19:51] truth and your life starts
[2:19:53] changing and all of a sudden you don't
[2:19:56] you no longer have
[2:19:57] hatred you no longer have bitterness you
[2:20:01] no longer have all these ways that that
[2:20:03] may be able to climb on
[2:20:07] you but you live in another
[2:20:10] dimension and by prayer and
[2:20:12] supplication and by the watering of the
[2:20:14] word of
[2:20:16] God
[2:20:20] grow remember the the the the the rain
[2:20:23] falls on the just and the
[2:20:25] unjust and it's very important that we
[2:20:28] are the word of
[2:20:30] God we stay balanced in the word of
[2:20:32] God amen amen I want to be the one that
[2:20:35] says Lord let it be unto me as you as
[2:20:38] your word
[2:20:39] says I'm not going to
[2:20:42] question I'm not going to question it it
[2:20:45] doesn't matter what people say about
[2:20:47] about it I'm going to believe your word
[2:20:51] and if it's impossible to my eyes to see
[2:20:54] it it doesn't matter I'm going to
[2:20:57] believe it because as I'm walking with
[2:21:00] you every day as your word now starts
[2:21:04] impregnating my
[2:21:06] heart I now start maturing into this
[2:21:10] sunship and I asked I start getting to
[2:21:13] know
[2:21:14] you so I can find the life that you
[2:21:18] predestin me for me to
[2:21:22] have this is the this is the point of
[2:21:25] sunship for you to come to your
[2:21:29] identity not this fleshly identity of
[2:21:33] Cosman the identity that he had of you
[2:21:36] in the beginning of his
[2:21:38] mind and the only way that you could
[2:21:41] come to that
[2:21:43] sunship is to accept the
[2:21:46] sunship that's right the only way to
[2:21:49] come into that that
[2:21:52] sunship is to accept the
[2:21:55] sunship and there's only one
[2:21:58] sunship and that's the Lord Jesus
[2:22:02] Christ a lot of times we like to take
[2:22:05] things out of
[2:22:08] context John the Baptist had a great
[2:22:12] ministry John the Baptist had a had a
[2:22:15] Ministry of restoration
[2:22:18] his word was
[2:22:19] accomplished but then Jesus came upon
[2:22:22] the scene the word of God came into the
[2:22:25] into the into the
[2:22:27] world and he recognized the word of God
[2:22:30] amongst
[2:22:32] them he was sitting in prison he was
[2:22:36] doubting himself a little bit go ask
[2:22:41] him is this truly
[2:22:45] he is this really
[2:22:50] him my but then he came to the
[2:22:53] Revelation that it
[2:22:55] was and then he had to go off the
[2:22:59] S and when he went off the
[2:23:01] S now Jes was one on the
[2:23:05] S butam says that there's only there
[2:23:07] could only be one Prophet on in in in in
[2:23:11] an age at one
[2:23:14] time so now one has to decrease so that
[2:23:17] way Christ can
[2:23:19] come and the fullness of the bod of the
[2:23:22] godhead bodily dwell in this
[2:23:26] flesh to be such a living
[2:23:30] vessel to be able to live a life
[2:23:32] submissive to the word of
[2:23:35] God and the Bible says that he learned
[2:23:38] obedience by the things he
[2:23:42] suffered that's true he learned
[2:23:44] obedience by the things he suffered
[2:23:47] perect
[2:23:50] son Saints this is who we
[2:23:54] are we might have been born in the
[2:23:57] manger we might have been born in the
[2:24:00] Kingdom but that doesn't matter what
[2:24:03] matters is your identity not the
[2:24:06] identity of this
[2:24:07] flesh but the identity of what God had
[2:24:10] predestinated into your
[2:24:14] spirit that's the way he deals with the
[2:24:16] IND
[2:24:19] idual came an Elijah Ministry in our
[2:24:22] day and by the restoration of the
[2:24:25] word William brandham introduced
[2:24:28] Christ and he showed truly what a life
[2:24:31] of Christ
[2:24:35] was he came to the Statue of a perfect
[2:24:39] man he came to the stature of a
[2:24:42] perfect where now the sunship was
[2:24:45] restored the restoration of the word now
[2:24:48] was restored into
[2:24:51] man of the son of man
[2:24:55] now where now a son of
[2:24:57] man the son of man able to bring more
[2:25:01] sons of man after

[2:25:32] it it's got to be chopped off for it to
[2:25:36] bring the
[2:25:37] light when the light's upon it and now
[2:25:41] you can see through the
[2:25:42] diamond but it has to be chopped it has
[2:25:46] to be a master
[2:25:47] piece it has it has to be dressed into

[2:28:44] the
[2:28:44] end he's the star of death
[2:28:47] David he's all of it because he always
[2:28:52] was and so were you because you are part
[2:28:55] of that same
[2:28:58] body never underestimate your
[2:29:02] identity if the devil's trying to fight
[2:29:06] anything he will always come at your
[2:29:09] identity you're not worthy
[2:29:12] enough you're not worthy
[2:29:14] enough you don't even have the right to
[2:29:16] ask
[2:29:18] God that's the
[2:29:20] Devil he's an accuser he always comes in
[2:29:24] accuse you of doing
[2:29:25] something but you know what there is
[2:29:28] there's a Bible there's a word of God
[2:29:31] and the word of God life of God that has
[2:29:34] been shed for me on
[2:29:37] Calvary and now by the name of Jesus
[2:29:40] Christ we can live a life in love and
[2:29:45] have a relationship
[2:29:47] and express the image of the word of God
[2:29:50] in this
[2:29:51] generation not by a Creed
[2:29:55] or Not by a creat or a
[2:29:58] Dogma not just by me saying I'm a
[2:30:00] message
[2:30:04] believer I have to live the life of
[2:30:06] Jesus
[2:30:09] Christ every day of my
[2:30:11] life because to live is gain sorry to to
[2:30:17] live is to
[2:30:19] die we have to die to ourselves so we
[2:30:22] can live truly the life that he wanted
[2:30:25] us to
[2:30:26] live because from the
[2:30:28] beginning that's what happened to
[2:30:31] life it had to
[2:30:35] die it had to die this flesh had to die
[2:30:40] so that with the true life the true
[2:30:43] identity the one that was given in the
[2:30:46] beginning
[2:30:47] could come to
[2:30:49] shine amen amen let's
[2:30:55] stand I want to read this in
[2:31:02] closing he says nothing can harm
[2:31:05] her not even
[2:31:07] death for if the seed be planted the
[2:31:10] water will raise it up
[2:31:14] again it says here's the
[2:31:17] secret now when brother brandom says
[2:31:20] this I cling to
[2:31:23] it because it rings in my heart I
[2:31:26] identify with
[2:31:27] this it says the word it says here's the
[2:31:30] secret paragraph 3 355 it says the the
[2:31:35] word is in the bride and the mind of
[2:31:38] Christ to know what he wants done with
[2:31:41] the
[2:31:45] word
[2:31:47] so the word is in the
[2:31:49] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[2:31:53] what he wants done with the
[2:31:57] word she does it in his
[2:32:00] name she has th sayth the
[2:32:03] Lord then it is
[2:32:06] gered and so the Holy Spirit Waters it
[2:32:10] let us grown and it serves its
[2:32:13] purpose they only do his will
[2:32:18] amen amen no one can persuade them
[2:32:22] different they have sayth the Lord or
[2:32:26] they keep
[2:32:27] still then they will do the works of
[2:32:32] God for it is himself in
[2:32:35] them continuing his word to fulfill as
[2:32:39] he did complet in in his
[2:32:43] day it says all things when he was
[2:32:48] here he did not complete all when he was
[2:32:51] here for it was not yet
[2:32:55] time amen amen but the bride now
[2:32:59] has amen amen by receiving the
[2:33:04] sunship the son unto us a son is
[2:33:10] given one fell in the
[2:33:13] beginning and brought death into the
[2:33:15] life
[2:33:17] right he was a living
[2:33:19] soul and the second one came and that
[2:33:23] one was a quickening
[2:33:25] spirit he was the very restoration of
[2:33:27] life back into the
[2:33:31] individual because by him we have
