the next service on Sunday and uh and the Wednesday in between God will provide a a minister doesn't he always provide one very good we'd like this uh this evening we're going to be reading from a starting at Psalms 34 and verse 7 and brother Joshua I sent you some emails there some quotes for tonight's service Psalms 34 and verse 7 and it reads like this see the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them and the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver him and I and I am a witness that he's done just that and I'm sure if you look at your lives you can say you too are a witness of his presence of this Angel of the Lord that he's been with you and now even in you to the ends of the Earth let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence ever with us and we ask your blessings now upon your word may something be said to bless the hearts to encourage your children to press forward with a Victorious Life In Christ we thank you now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated tonight like to speak on a on a thought and we've shared it before but I thought it was timely to share it once again because there's many things that go that go into this thought that will share with us more than what the title reveals and the title is the Angel With The Sweep back Wings many of you have seen the the Life Magazine it was from 1963 I I have one I have two of them and in 1963 Life Magazine their photographers they took a picture of a mysterious Cloud that appeared uh in the heavens in in in this area of the world where we live uh from Tucson Arizona you could see it people in Flagstaff could see it people who lived out towards Willcox Arizona could see it they said people could see it from a radius of 200 miles around and this picture of this mysterious ring Cloud as they called it they they they they never could figure out what it was and yet we know what it was because it was a prophetic sign and it was a sign of the second coming of the Lord and it was a sign of the opening of part seven of the Lamb's Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life is exactly what it says it is it is a book of life it's this new testament in the Bible this is the Lamb's Book of Life because the Lamb's Book of Life Begins how any how shall we say biography would begin speaking about the person that the biography is writing of and the New Testament in the Book of Matthew begins and this is the generation of Jesus Christ the lamb and and and it's going to and he's going to display and he's going to tell us who his generation is and that's where the New Testament started the Holy Spirit through Matthew declaring you read this you read this book of the Lamb's Book of Life and you'll find out who you are brother Bram says I found out that I wasn't a son of Charles and Ella Branham not just that I was more I was a son I was a daughter of God in the mind of God for the foundation of the world so in in the I would say it was about the late 70s early 80s when I first began to here of of uh of men speaking that the that the angel in the cloud picture the one who who when you look at the picture that Life Magazine took you can see this Angel and his wings are swept back and uh so there was raising up a a teaching I guess you could say that the angel in the cloud picture was William brandom's theop or Celestial body they they took one quote and of course they've added more out of the Feast of the trumpets to prove their Revelation but with one quote of whether it be what William brandham said or or be one quote in the Bible you cannot prove it to be a truth you can prove that's the way you see it but you can't prove that it's a that it's a truth a Biblical truth because it must be word upon word and line upon line you can take one thought of anything and and run often say it means this and this and this and this and the further you go with your human reasoning the further you get away from the truth and of course one of the first times I heard a man speaking on this they went to this scripture the one we just read Psalms 34 it said the angel of the Lord encampeth round the about them that fear Him and deliver them they read the scripture then they make the statement they say you see that's your theophany that's your Celestial body and then they go on speaking for 30 minutes an hour but that's not Bible teaching that's building your own Doctrine or Creed because you're not going from scripture upon scripture line upon line here a little in the Bible and there's some more in the Bible so so First Corinthians 2 Corinthians 5 the Apostle Paul said this for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so God doesn't build natural buildings he's building Supernatural buildings and Paul is speaking here of our celestial bodies and this body that he's speaking of is what it's called our theophany a Celestial body now a theophany it's a body Celestial body that doesn't have a spirit in it listen to this quote 1957 1 for life he said and the lust which was the son of God created by these great Fountains of Purity God as those Spirits went out and they created the logus and it was a body it was in the form of what we are now which is called in the clergy way of speaking it a theop it's a body that doesn't have a spirit in it it's a body that's waiting for you Christians as soon as the life leaves this this body you go into that body when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting a theop but a theophany remember what he said it's a body that doesn't have a Spirit they call it a theophany but it's our Celestial body Paul spoke of it brother bam says in the message in tment uh he says he says as job of old when we hear that ashes to ashes dust to dust it reminds me of Long Fellow the poet he said tell me not in Mor in mournful numbers life is just an empty dream and the soul is dead that Slumbers and things are not what they seem he said he he said this yay life is real life is earnest and the grave it's not is not its goal for dust Thou Art to dust returnest was not spoken of the Soul it has a different promise it has a greater promise they call it a theophany that when we leave here we go in somewhere else he said whatever it may be I take the apostles word when he said if this Earthly Tabernacle or Dwelling Place be dissolved we have one already waiting to move from this this flesh body into that into a theophany body remember we just read it in the message thirsting for life brother brandom says a theophany is a body that doesn't have a spirit in it he made a statement he said your spirit breaks up when you die it takes a flight just like your natural flesh body it breaks up and turns into the 16 different elements of the Earth and it's dust from where it came from and God's spoken word created these bodies well the spirit the human Spirit just like the human body will also break up when you die and it will be no more because it's that human Spirit and the and and and the Soul when it's born again that's the inner battle that's the battle of the Mind between this natural human spirit and a man and a woman that's been born again the soul is the seed that's the Son and Daughter of God the human spirit that we had was because of the fall this flesh body that'll die because of the Fall but but there is lays within us a soul that's a seed of God so he says in the message leadership 1965 he says if you believe me to be God's Prophet you listen to my words it was 1965 December the 7th so just about 20 just about 19 or 18 days before he passed away I would say he dared to say this you believe me to be God's Prophet you listen to my words he said that's a deception in this day didn't the Bible say it be so close it would deceive the elected of possible to the soul but if you dance in the spirit and still with the things of the world there's something wrong if you speak with tongues Paul said I can speak with tongues of man and angels and still not even be saved yes both kinds I can do all the emotions I can have faith I can preach the gospel El I can give all the goods to feed the poor I can carry the word in Mission fields and I'm still nothing see it's the inside of the inside brother see your spirit breaks up when you die so this human Spirit breaks up when you die this flesh body this human body breaks up when you die it takes its flight but your soul is the one that lives you see he made a statement the soul in a man is your theophany the soul in a woman is your theophany if you're a son and daughter of God it's already in you it's part of you it's who you are and it's all lay in the seed called the soul in the message Hebrews chapter 2 and it's uh 1957 it says now when man become into that body he had control of all the fishes and fowls and beasts of the field and then there was no man to till the soil because the first man was was that theophany and a theophany a Celestial body doesn't have hands to till the ground Genesis 2 he he had made them male and female but there there was no man to till the soil then God made Man Out of the Dust of the earth he gave him a hand like a chimpanzee he gave him a foot like a bear then God made Man Out of the Dust of the earth oh he made him on the image and this of this Earthly body is a image of animal life and it's made out of the same kind of material your body is made just the same kind of material as a horse or a dog anything like that in other words it's made out of it's made out of calcium as petroleum Cosmic Light Elements right from the dust of the Earth all All Flesh like that is not the same flesh it's different flesh but it's made out of the Dust of the earth that's that's where it come from but the difference between an animal and a man is God put a soul in a man that's the seed that's the spoken word seed God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul is the seed of God the soul is the gene of God the soul is what makes you a son and daughter of God and the animal doesn't have that because he's an animal because he's not a sin and daughter of God he says you see the soul that was in the man is that theop how is the soul in a believer also it's his or her theophany or Celestial body because one is the seed and the theophany is the body that the seed will finally manifest when you plant a seed in the ground and you let it grow first the the the ground and the chemicals and everything that's in the Earth with the water it actually makes the seed look like it's like like it's coming undone and it doesn't look very nice if you were to open it up to look at its condition but what's really happening is that seed is being born because it's been placed in the proper soil and the harsh conditions begin to break it down is actually a seed being born to bring forth the stature of what that seed is wheat corn an oak tree and yet it All Began from a little seed that's you and I that's the natural now what about the supernatural today in our hearts how is the soul in a Believer also his or her theop this Celestial body that will receive by rapturing faith Psalms 91 verse 11 the Bible says for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against a stone it's a promise and it's a promise for every believer but they've also used this scripture to say that these angels are your theop and they're alive somewhere in a different dimension and when you need help they come down to the Earth and help you that means they've got their own minds that means can make choices independent from you and when you and when you're in trouble here on planet Earth your angel your theophany who is really you comes down to help you on this Earth that's not true but they take one scripture and expound on it they don't connect it to the Bible neither do they connect it to what a prophet taught there's three principles that I want you to consider when we speak on this subject one is found in Genesis 1 and verse 12 if you'll turn with me to Genesis 1 you're all familiar with it but we'll read it just to remind us and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yelding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good so the principle in this scripture is let everything produce of its own kind every seed whether it be Botanical a beast of the field but every seed will produce of its own kind that's a principle laying in the Bible that applies both naturally and spiritually so Genesis 112 though it sounds like a very literal scripture and just a very natural point point that's been made Genesis 112 still requires Revelation and if God made us men and women that type of seed he won't change us to Wing Angels later you say why is that because winged angels are a different kind that every seed produce of its own kind here's something else amazing I'll tell you me and sister Karen had six children not one of them was a winged angel when they were growing up I wondered if they were Angels at all after a while but they were in their own way Matthew 13:34 a second principle laying in the word it says all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spoking not unto them in other words he was going to be speaking prophecy and hide it in statements that seemed very natural like genesis 11:12 it's a statement that seems very natural but it was really a prophetic word verse 35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world then then Jesus sent the multitude away after he spoke these Parables none of them understood the parable and it says and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field in other words what they were asking for and they didn't realize it but Jesus knew what they were asking you know sometimes we ask and we pray for things and we don't really know what what we're asking for and when the answer comes you can better understand what you prayed for by the answer he gave you you may have thought well I didn't think I asked it that way but nonetheless he gave you an answer to what you were asking and if you can see that you can realize what you really needed and he gave it remember the little story it was a little boy he' sit down and pray and and uh and every time he prayed he'd close his eyes put his hands together he'd say Lord ABC then he'd pause d f then he paused g i jkl and he pause and every time you can come to church he'd pray that way at the altar finally one day the pastor called him over and said son come here he says I don't think you know how to pray and I want to help you no he says no no no no I do know how to pray you're just reciting the alphabet he says I do know how to pray I just don't know how to say it but I know if I give God all the letters he'll put it together for me he'll send me just what I need so Matthew 13 Jesus is telling us that this Lamb's Book of Life that that Jesus was opening to Israel requires revelation and no one but the lamb can give it to you that's what was happening in Matthew 13 and then of course there's Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so that means that there's a pattern to God's word pattern to his teachings that means there's a pattern to how he redeems us and saves and Jesus said the Book of Matthew I think it's chapter 16 he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail and what was that rock Revelation again so now that we have these three principles set in our mind in the mouth of two or three witnesses that everything be established now we'll go forward and ask God for Revelation in the message Israel and the church in 1953 brother Brandon makes a statement you'll go back to a young man or woman again you'll go back to a young man or woman [Music] again so in the quote he says this here we here who are getting along past you see he too was speaking in Parables what he meant was we here who are getting older you didn't know he said that because he spoke it in a parable he said we here who are getting along past words we who are getting older how do you know that's what he meant then he says when a man and woman passes 25 years old you might as well face it your youthful days are finished and to think that glorious promise as we're facing the setting of the Sun what is is it is life finished oh no no life just hasn't begun yet oh we're just going I just wish that there was some way we could settle down till time didn't mean nothing and just stay in like that and get those things out of the scriptures before the people they are there friends I can prove it by God's Bible and the help of the holy spirit that every one of you that's in Christ born again that one of these days those gray hairs will change and the and the wrinkles will run from your face you'll go back to a young man or woman again and live forever with Christ Jesus I can show you where God proved it in the Bible showed the shadows and the marks of it and promised it and swore by it that he'd do it oh how marvelous that is then he goes on to say this mom used to tell me excuse me Mom that was before you knew better too that we'd have wings and fly around up there you know why I like to eat drink shake hands with people Fellowship I thought oh my that that'll all be finished then I found out God never did make me an angel he made me a man and I'll always be a man and never be an angel that's an error God's got Angels sure he made angels He made cherubims with wings and he made Angels without wings when I used to hear these old songs when I was a sinner and would go into them places brown eyed angel awaits me I thought oh my Me an Angel and I found out that's a lie of the devil never was such a thing see we are absolutely men and women and we'll return back to this earth men and women that's right that's God's teaching when you see those things it makes you appreciate Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever unchanging in all his ways and in the beginning he said let every seed produce of its own kind God rich in Mercy the message job preached in 1955 brother says this the statement is this he made us humans he ain't redeemed us back to Angels so here it begins the quote see the plan how God wants to redeem us when we left Eden it was a beautiful pair there in the Garden of Eden that lovely little sweetheart and the husband and then by Falling see God just brings us right back again through Redemption to to redeem us right back to our origin [Music] again we're he he's not taking us back to the angels and you'll go into restaurant and hear that old squeaky juice boxes or whatever you call it squeaking out a brown eyed angel waits for me nonsense if your beloved wife was gone or somebody she waits for you there as a human being Immortal God made Angels but he made us men he made us humans he hasn't redeemed us back to angels He redeemed us back to where we was in the first place where Adam and Eve were in the first place human beings eating drinking you see just the way of the Cross leads us back home in the message Hebrews chapter one brother says the logos of God had a theophany body and the body body was like a man now the quote in Hebrews 1957 he says now when these great lights went out or great rays of spirit love peace that's all there was there wasn't no suffering there wasn't no hate nor malice it couldn't come from this fountain that was Jehovah that was Jehovah God now as the theologians call it a theophany went from that which was called in the scriptures the logos the logos that went out of God it's hard to explain but it was a part of God now here is what happened oh this just gets me right where I love it the lust this great Fountain this great Fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit began to form in the creation and the logus went out from it it was the son of God it was the only visible form that the spirit had it was a theophany which means a body and the body of Jehovah was like a man Moses saw it when it passed by The Rock he looked at it and said it looked like the hind part of a man in the mind of God he always had a body and one day that body that Moses saw the back part one day that body that walked in the garden with Adam one day that body would come to Earth and become a flesh body you'd say how did become a flesh body just like Adam was first a spirit man and come into a flesh body so the body of Jesus before it ever became a flesh body it was a Celestial Supernatural body that God dwelt in one day God came down in that body the same one he used that Calvary but he came down and visited Abraham in that same body it was God in flesh speaking with his son bringing him a promise and swearing when he could swear by no greater Sarah is going to have a son and he'll represent the Son of God Christ himself this Isaac he said Moses saw it when it passed it looked like the hind part of the man it's the same type of body we receive when we die here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that was it and that was the theophany which was the son of God that logos became flesh because we're put in flesh and the theophany the logos became flesh here amongst us and it was nothing else but the dwelling place for the entire fountain dwelt in him oh do you see it there it is Exodus 33 and verse 20 the Bible says Moses asked God to see his glory in other words I want to see you face to face and he said in Exodus 33 and 20 he said thou can not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me that thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass and I will take away my my hand and thou shalt see my back part but my face shall not be seen it was a prophecy telling us the book has been sealed with Seven Seals no man can see it now but the day would come when the W the when the book would be open and you'd see me face to face you'd know exactly what I look like I'd reveal it you'd know me in all my glory in the message the seventh seal bam says this another thing I want you to notice the statement he made was one Angel was very notable to me you remember the quote and men will say well what could be more notable than if he saw himself his face in that angel why what could be more notable they said well I've got an answer for that to see Christ would be more notable look at our own image in a mirror Fallen image he says another thing I want you to notice what taken place and if you're listening to the tape what time is it sir you will notice that one Angel was very notable to me the rest of them just seem more ordinarily but this Angel was a noted Angel he was to my left in the constellation in a form of a pyramid you remember it was in the pyramid where the mysterious White Rock was not written on and the angels took me into that pyramid of themselves the the mysteries of God known only to them and now they with the messengers they come to interpret that pyramid that message of the secret of these Seven Seals which lays inside the pyramid now the angel was to my left he would really be the last or seventh angel if we would count them from left to right because he was on my left and me looking looking to him towards the West him coming towards the east would be on my left so that would be the last Angel's message very notable you remember how I how I said he he had his head back and his great sharp wings and he flew right to me now that is this seventh seal or that was this part seven of this Plan of Redemption in this Lamb's Book of Life he said still a notable thing then he said when he preached the seventh seal we don't know what it is as yet because it's not permitted to be broken but today in 2024 we do know what it is because he continued preaching on this seven seal on part seven and never stopped in 1964 and 1965 until God took him home and he made it clear to us what it was which we'll share another time in the mystery Christ The Mystery of God revealed paragraph 6 629 brother brandom says this Glory the great Angel of the Covenant the one who was with Moses in the wilderness listen close it's 1963 it's July 28th in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said Glory the great Angel of the Covenant the one who was with Moses in the wilderness the one who came to Paul on the road to Damascus that same one permitted his picture to be taken with us he's talking about the picture when he was in Dallas of the pillar of fire he said the same one that was in the picture in the Life Magazine the other day the same word by the same God through the same channels by the same way by the same promise wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'm there in the midst then here he then he is here did you hear it he said the great Angel of the Covenant who was with Moses in the wilderness the one who came to Paul on the road to Damascus he's lining this up in the mouth of two other Witnesses and what he says will be the third witness the same one who was with Moses in the wilderness he called him the great Angel of the Covenant the one who came to Paul on the road to Damascus the same one per permitted his picture to be taken with us there in Dallas then he says the same one that was in the picture in the Life Magazine so who was that one that whose picture was in the Life Magazine who was that angel with the sweep back Wings it was the angel of the Covenant it was Christ he's telling us the same word by the same God through the same channel by the same way by the same promis wherever two or three are gathered in my name you notice what he's saying here in the mouth of three Witnesses the one who spoke with Moses the one who spoke with Paul met him on the road to Damascus the one that met me on Sunset Mountain it's the same God it's Christ it's the angel of the coven it's God the pillar of fire he said the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him those that hang only to his word no man can respect that word without fearing God see and here he is here this morning with us as we worship Him Spirit who is here the great Angel of the Covenant the one that was with Moses in the wilderness the one that met Paul on the road to Damascus the one that caught William brandham up in this constellation of Angels the same God by the same channels by the same word and he's with us as we worship Him in spirit tonight in the message in questions and answers number four4 BR makes a statement you can't live in two bodies at the same time so for your theophany to be a body living somewhere else another dimension and then you're living in a flesh body that's living in two bodies at the same time he says you can't do that listen to this quote questions and answers 1964 this is a dying spirit in a dying body in other words this human spirit this flesh body one day will be no more but now he says but but you can't be in two bodies at one time there can be two Natures in you at one time now the nature of the spirit of the Lord when you're born again you're not born of physically like a baby is but what's happened the spiritual Birth has come to you and while the spiritual birth is growing in your heart there's a physical or Celestial body growing to receive that spirit and when the life leaves this body goes to that body just as when the body is presented to the earth a natural birth there's a spirit that comes in and when the spirit goes out of the body there's a body waiting for we know that after this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's it the spiritual body of the people a question on these seven angels that appeared on Sunset Mountain the question is did the seven angels in the Life Magazine that appeared there over sunset Mountain that they represent the seven Earthly Church age Messengers The answer is no and yet human reasoning has said well if there were seven angels in a constellation and there's and there was and there was seven Church age Messengers Ah that's easy 127 127 so one of those angels must have been Paul the next irus the next Martin the next Luther the next W and of course then that means the seventh angel was was William brandham human reasoning but the answer is did the seven angels in Life Magazine represent the seven Earthly Church Messengers The answer is no why is the answer no this is why in the message 1965 April the 18th brother brandham entitled it is the rising of the sun he said he is the one who opened those seals talking about Christ the lamb he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ seven parts that open up the Lamb's Book of Life Book of redemption and the Very seven Angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it we always think it's something else he said they did they took the picture not us the seven angels he's speaking of is the ones in the Life Magazine life took the picture of it it's these seven angels that the prophet is saying they represented the seven churches all completed he says and there he is standing there Supreme judge showing that he's alpha and omega beginning and the end oh what identification quickening power did that for us the message that was coming through the angel of the Covenant was Christ and the angel and and he and and was was given it to Moses and Moses gave it to the children of Israel on the road to the promised land we have experienced the same thing the angel of the Covenant give a message to another Exodus Prophet the Third Exodus Elijah and as this Angel of the Covenant is giving this message to this 20 Century Prophet then he's giving it to the children of God on their on our road to our promised land on our road to our rapture in our road being changed and being victorious in Christ 1965 the message does God change his mind he said and Moses was leading the children of Israel just as God would tell them where to go led by a pillar of fire and a supernatural being was leading the way and Moses was getting his information through the logos he's not just telling us a story the Old Testament he's hoping you'll you'll have eyes of understanding to see this day this scripture fulfilling in our lives also Mo he says and Moses Mo was leading the children of Israel just as God would tell them where to go led by a pillar of fire and a supernatural being that was leading the way and Moses was getting his information through the L that went out of God that Pillar of Fire the angel of the Covenant which was Christ the anointed one and he was getting his message through there and giving it to the children of Israel on the road to a Promised Land we too have received a message that the angel of the Covenant gave to a prophet on our road to our promised land in the message scriptural signs of the time brother says don't be ashamed if you're ashamed of him here he said I'll be ashamed of you before the father and the Holy Angels you're in his presence now he's here he's absolutely here the great Holy Spirit the pillar of fire was with MES is right here remember when he was here on Earth he said I come from God and I go to God they said Moses forsook the treasures of Egypt considering the treasures of Christ greater than all the reproach of Christ greater than all the treasures of Egypt he went in the wilderness with Christ and any Bible reader knows the pillar of the fire was the angel of the Covenant the logus that went out of God which was Jesus and then when he died he ascended up into heaven and when he met Saul on the road to Damascus he had done turned back to the pillar of fire again and even put Paul's eyes out with the brightness he says now he's here now he's here tonight the same yesterday today and for he said would you like to identify yourself before him and say Lord God I haven't got that kind of an experience I want to have it I'm not asking you to come up here I'm just asking you to raise your hand to him if you feel like that he says was there some that wasn't that haven't raised their hands he said God bless in the message does God change his mind the prophet said Moses was leading the children of Israel just as God would let him go led by a pillar of fire and a supernatural being that was leading the way and Moses was getting in his information through the logus of just as this end time Prophet did the same that Pillar of Fire which was the angel of the Covenant that angel in the Life Magazine the one that was the most notable to him a prophet told us clearly it was the angel of the Covenant that's why it meant so much to him he said which was Christ the anointed one in the message the fifth seal we'll close with this we won't finish tonight brother Bram speaks to us of the experience that he had when he went beyond the curtain at time he said it's been about a year ago or a little more this is 1963 he preaching the fifth seal it's been about a year ago or a little more I woke up one morning and I said sweetheart to my wife she didn't move uh I had to get the kids up take them to school right up there at the old place and I raised up out of bed you know and I leaned lean forward you know to sit up and I just lean and I just lean my head back against the headboard we got one of those oldfashioned beds so I so I just leaned back and I thought boy you're already 53 and and if you're going to do anything for God you better get doing it because you're you're going to just be too old after a while I was laying there thinking thinking that and all at once there was something happened now you know and all of you who are acquainted with the visions and if this was a vision never had one like it and and I've had them since I was a little bitty boy and all one something happened and I felt myself leaving I thought well I've already died I'm gone on see see I got a place uh I I was on the bed I was stretched out laying by the side of my wife I thought well it's probably a heart attack see I thought well I just died instantly which would be a fine way of going so I thought that's a heart attack I didn't have to suffer I looked and I thought well now that's strange there I lay right there in the bed and here I'm standing here he had left his body the body on the bed was what we would call dead he had left that body and God had allowed him to enter into that theophany he's going to take him on a trip he's going to go through dimensions he said well it's probably a heart attack see I just died instantly so I thought that's a heart attack I didn't have to suffer I thought well now that's strange there I'm laying right there he's seeing his body an old man it says and here I'm standing here so then we're going to jump up jump a few paragraphs ahead and then brother brandom is in this other dimension then he says so then but however there was Fritz standing there licking me on the hand that was his old dog he said I looked I couldn't cry no one could cry it was all joy you couldn't be sad because it was all happiness you couldn't die it was all life there see you couldn't get old there cuz it was all youth that's what it was just perfect I thought oh isn't this wonderful and the millions that were there oh Maya was right at home see and just then I heard a voice and it cried out and said all that you ever loved you know reward for my service he said I don't need no reward all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given to you I said praise the Lord I felt funny I thought what's the matter I feel funny I turned around and looked and on the bed my body was moving I said oh I don't have to go back surely don't let me go but the gospel had to be preached and just a second I was on the bed again like that the body he left was a man of 53 but you go back and read the fifth seal and it's and it's several pages that he's giving the account of what happened and in that account he he says he says when he arrived there he said I looked at my hands they were young I put my head up and touched my head I had a head full of hair everybody that was there no people there was no babies there was no elderly amen he said millions of sisters came up to him and embraced him and hugged him he and he said I Heard a Voice tell me did you recognize her he said no no he says you let her to Christ when she was 90 years old she wasn't 90 anymore and guess what nobody there in their theophany body had wings not a one there were young men and young women but you get off on a false teaching and the devil will take you further and further and further and you'll never see the truth may God have mercy on us I was hoping I'd finish but that would take another two hours tonight you're not busy tonight are you as we stand to our feet the musician would come or song leader would come up C and while they're coming we'll have
