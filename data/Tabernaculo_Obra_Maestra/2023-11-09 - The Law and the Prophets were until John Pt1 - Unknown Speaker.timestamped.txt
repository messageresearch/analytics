[52:04] incar
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:13] not and through
[52:19] [Music]
[52:24] f faithfulness has been great towards
[52:27] us since we were
[52:30] born as he's changing
[52:32] us and until he takes us from this world
[52:36] great is his faithfulness God bless you
[52:38] all this
[52:40] evening it's good to be back home
[52:44] again we we had a a good time with the
[52:47] Saints up in
[52:49] Albuquerque our brother uh Raul Gonzalez
[52:52] brother Gonzalez and all the saints
[52:56] they all send their
[52:59] greetings and
[53:01] um wishing that you could have all been
[53:04] there
[53:07] also so maybe sometime the Lord will
[53:10] permit
[53:12] that but uh we had a we had a wonderful
[53:16] time I believe God spoke to the hearts
[53:19] of his
[53:21] children Friday
[53:23] night we we he actually the brother has
[53:27] a white
[53:30] board and um so was more of a a bible
[53:33] study on
[53:36] Friday so we were uh not behind the
[53:40] pulpit but standing in front and and um
[53:43] making a few diagrams for the
[53:49] Brethren but because for most of them it
[53:51] was something very
[53:54] new
[53:55] The Book of Revelations is a book of
[53:58] mystery for
[54:00] most but we realize now by the grace of
[54:05] God God God sent a
[54:07] prophet and This Book of Revelation we
[54:10] realize now is more of a it's a book of
[54:15] history and the first three chapters of
[54:18] This Book of
[54:21] Revelations the first chapter is lifting
[54:23] up Jesus Christ
[54:27] that he's the alpha he's the Omega he's
[54:30] the beginning he's the he's the end he's
[54:34] our
[54:35] everything and and he's he's one he's
[54:38] likened unto one walking in the midst of
[54:40] these seven Church
[54:44] ages these seven
[54:47] candlesticks and it just
[54:49] represents Jesus Christ the Holy
[54:53] Spirit from the time of his death burial
[54:55] and
[54:58] resurrection that when he
[55:01] resurrected now the spirit of God was
[55:05] going to be moving from the days of
[55:08] Jesus to our day
[55:10] here until a Rapture takes
[55:13] place so seven Church
[55:16] ages is just the this Gentile
[55:22] dispensations because in the days of
[55:25] Jesus Israel rejected him so so he he
[55:31] was given now to to a gentile people
[55:37] us and Israel was
[55:39] blinded so that we our eyes could be
[55:43] open so we so that we as a gentile
[55:47] people would have the
[55:49] opportunity to receive Jesus Christ as
[55:53] our personal savior
[55:56] as as as our as the
[55:57] bridegroom as our husband as our Lord as
[56:01] our savior as our healer so chapter one
[56:06] of Revelations is lifting Jesus up to
[56:09] this
[56:10] position Lord of lords and King of Kings
[56:14] walking in the midst of his
[56:16] people these seven Church
[56:18] ages and then chapter two of Revelations
[56:23] goes on to to give the names of these
[56:25] seven
[56:27] churches and these seven
[56:30] churches they actually existed in the
[56:33] days of the
[56:34] disciples in the days of Jesus the
[56:37] Apostle Paul visited all these
[56:41] churches and he took the gospel to them
[56:44] these were Gentile
[56:46] churches and each each one had a
[56:49] characteristic to
[56:50] it but but but Revelations 2 wasn't just
[56:54] talking telling us about the history of
[56:59] churches because this is a prophetic
[57:02] book so that so this was
[57:05] prophecy so these churches were a
[57:08] symbol and each one had a certain
[57:11] characteristic that would be
[57:14] reflected throughout the time from the
[57:17] days of Jesus to right
[57:19] now and there's curses in the
[57:23] book and there's blings for the
[57:27] Overcomers so there were seven Church
[57:30] ages and the first church age the Church
[57:33] of
[57:34] Ephesus represented the days of
[57:38] Jesus it began in the days of of of John
[57:41] the Baptist
[57:43] Elijah and then we come to the last
[57:45] Church
[57:46] age which is called the age
[57:49] of and that's the day that we're living
[57:52] in
[57:53] today we're living in the day of
[57:57] leoda and the leodan church
[58:01] age there begins in Revelations 3 and
[58:06] verse4 and Revelations 3:14 says
[58:09] this and unto the angel of the Church of
[58:12] the leodan
[58:16] write so so the holy spirit is writing
[58:19] to an
[58:21] angel an angel is a
[58:23] messenger in the Bible whether you look
[58:26] in the Greek or you look in the Hebrew
[58:30] the word angel in the Bible it simply
[58:34] means a
[58:36] messenger so that messenger could be a
[58:38] Celestial
[58:40] being or that that angel could be a
[58:42] terrestrial
[58:45] being in other words a preacher of the
[58:49] Gospel a prophet of God an apostle the
[58:54] angel to the the church in
[58:56] Ephesus that that angel was the Apostle
[59:00] Paul because he said he said he told
[59:03] Peter just as you have been given the
[59:05] commission to go to the
[59:08] Jews and take this message of eternal
[59:11] life to
[59:13] them so I have been given a
[59:16] commission and I'm to take this message
[59:19] of
[59:19] Christ to the
[59:21] Gentiles and that's what he did so Paul
[59:24] was the first Messenger to the Ephesian
[59:27] Church age there in Revelations 2 verse
[59:30] one he was that angel and every age had
[59:34] an
[59:36] angel this is all symbolic here so that
[59:39] means every age had a
[59:42] messenger a man that God would raise up
[59:45] in that day and call the people out of
[59:48] dark
[59:50] denominationalism call them out of the
[59:52] world and call them back to to the
[59:55] word and leoda was was was no
[59:59] different and unto the angel of the
[1:00:01] Church of the leodan
[1:00:03] right these things saith the amen the
[1:00:07] faithful and true witness the beginning
[1:00:09] of the creation of God he says he's
[1:00:13] telling this church of
[1:00:15] leoda which these are the
[1:00:17] characteristics of the churches
[1:00:20] today I Know Thy works that that thou
[1:00:24] art neither cold nor
[1:00:27] hot he's saying
[1:00:29] today the churches the
[1:00:33] denominations they're neither
[1:00:35] cold nor hot they're just church
[1:00:40] members they're just there for
[1:00:43] programs they're just there for the
[1:00:45] bread and the
[1:00:46] fishes they're not really there to see
[1:00:50] to to look for a word that will change
[1:00:53] them
[1:00:56] he said and here the Holy Spirit speaks
[1:00:58] and says I would that thou w't cold or
[1:01:03] hot he said I'd rather you tell me
[1:01:06] you're an unbeliever or tell me you're a
[1:01:11] Believer and not be a make believer in
[1:01:13] the
[1:01:15] church so then because Thou Art
[1:01:18] lukewarm in the middle can neither cold
[1:01:22] nor
[1:01:22] hot I will peew the out of my
[1:01:26] mouth he's talking to the Church of
[1:01:30] leoda who is the Church of
[1:01:32] leoda from the Catholic
[1:01:35] denomination to the Pentecostal
[1:01:39] denomination is the Church of
[1:01:42] laa and the Holy Spirit is calling out
[1:01:46] come out of her my people and don't be
[1:01:49] partakers of
[1:01:51] their be a real believer Christ in
[1:01:55] Jesus he said so then because Thou Art
[1:01:59] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[1:02:02] spew thee out of my
[1:02:05] mouth verse
[1:02:10] 16 because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:02:13] increased with Goods this is the spirit
[1:02:16] in the churches
[1:02:20] today and have need of nothing and
[1:02:22] knowest not that thou are wretched and
[1:02:24] miserable and poor and blind and
[1:02:32] naked they're rich they're living the
[1:02:36] American
[1:02:37] dream but they don't know that they that
[1:02:41] they are
[1:02:43] wretched miserable poor blind and
[1:02:47] naked before God then the Holy Spirit
[1:02:51] speaks to this Leo desine Church
[1:02:56] we're living in this lean
[1:02:59] age I said I counsel thee to buy me gold
[1:03:02] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:03:05] rich and white
[1:03:11] rment this isn't
[1:03:13] literal this is
[1:03:15] spiritual that thou mayest be closed and
[1:03:18] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:03:23] appear
[1:03:24] remember what happened in
[1:03:27] Genesis Adam and Eve partook of the tree
[1:03:30] of the of the knowledge of Good and
[1:03:35] Evil and then something happened to
[1:03:38] them something terrible they'd never
[1:03:42] experienced
[1:03:43] before and they were filled with great
[1:03:46] shame because the holy Veil had been
[1:03:49] torn off their
[1:03:51] eyes and now they both
[1:03:53] realized that they were
[1:03:55] naked but here at
[1:03:58] Lea they are blind they're
[1:04:02] naked and they don't know it spiritually
[1:04:06] speaking but not only spiritually
[1:04:09] speaking speaking
[1:04:11] naturally because natural
[1:04:14] sometimes it's a shadow of the of the
[1:04:17] spiritual
[1:04:20] condition we're in
[1:04:22] Albuquerque and the and the the brother
[1:04:25] Raul a man had come and
[1:04:28] visited and he was a Catholic man and he
[1:04:31] enjoyed the
[1:04:33] services and he told brother rul he
[1:04:37] wasn't a young man he was a man already
[1:04:40] maybe 70 years
[1:04:42] old and he said you know in the Catholic
[1:04:44] church
[1:04:47] today he says I
[1:04:50] go but the women he said and I've gone
[1:04:54] all my
[1:04:55] life and the way they dress
[1:04:58] today to go to
[1:05:00] church is the way women dressed years
[1:05:05] ago but only the
[1:05:08] prostitutes this is a Catholic
[1:05:12] man who's lived long enough to
[1:05:15] see the change taking
[1:05:19] place and both their priest and the
[1:05:21] women and the men are what
[1:05:27] in this lean
[1:05:28] time they're wretched
[1:05:32] miserable they're poor blind and naked
[1:05:36] verse 19 says can as many as I love I
[1:05:39] rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
[1:05:42] and
[1:05:46] repent God speaks of their horrible
[1:05:50] condition and he says because I love you
[1:05:55] I will rebuke and chasen
[1:05:58] you he said be zealous
[1:06:01] therefore and repent don't get lifted up
[1:06:05] with
[1:06:06] pride don't say you can't talk to me
[1:06:08] that way
[1:06:11] preacher God is saying be zealous and
[1:06:15] repent and then baptize in the name of
[1:06:19] Jesus
[1:06:20] Christ verse 20 says behold
[1:06:24] I stand at the door and
[1:06:27] knock a prophet brother brandom told us
[1:06:31] he says watch verse
[1:06:32] 20 notice it says behold I stand at the
[1:06:35] door and
[1:06:37] knock he says it's the only church
[1:06:41] age as you read all seven of
[1:06:44] them from ver from chapter
[1:06:46] two where Jesus is on the outside of the
[1:06:51] church knocking asking them to let him
[1:06:55] back into their
[1:06:58] churches that's where we're at
[1:07:01] today behold I stand at the door and
[1:07:04] knock but the churches will not open up
[1:07:08] the door to
[1:07:10] Jesus so then he says if the churches
[1:07:15] won't if any
[1:07:17] man if if any woman if any young lady if
[1:07:22] any young man will hear my voice and
[1:07:26] open the door of your
[1:07:28] heart I'll come into to him I'll come
[1:07:31] into to her we'll up together we'll be
[1:07:36] one in an invisible Union with baptism
[1:07:40] of the Holy
[1:07:41] Ghost then he says to him that
[1:07:45] overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:07:47] thee in my throne in other words this is
[1:07:52] the last opportunity for
[1:07:56] individuals because the
[1:07:58] churches have rejected
[1:08:01] him you know there was a
[1:08:03] time this here is the second coming of
[1:08:08] Christ there was a time at the first
[1:08:10] coming of
[1:08:11] Christ when the
[1:08:14] church had rejected him when the high
[1:08:18] priest had publicly
[1:08:20] said we have no King but Caesar
[1:08:25] and that was the high priest of
[1:08:27] Israel what happened to
[1:08:30] Jehovah Israel was in a
[1:08:33] condition but they were wretched
[1:08:35] miserable blind naked rejected the Son
[1:08:38] of
[1:08:42] God the the people were
[1:08:45] lost but on the cross of
[1:08:49] Calvary there was two
[1:08:52] thieves
[1:08:54] and one of
[1:08:56] them despite his
[1:09:01] condition was an
[1:09:05] overcomer you say a
[1:09:07] thief on the
[1:09:09] cross just minutes from
[1:09:12] Death you would call him an
[1:09:18] overcomer he said to him that
[1:09:21] overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:09:25] my the thief on the cross
[1:09:29] said Lord remember me when you go into
[1:09:34] your
[1:09:35] kingdom Jesus said done as a matter of
[1:09:40] fact this day we're both walking off of
[1:09:44] this
[1:09:45] cross standing up out of the
[1:09:47] Grave we're going to go and the
[1:09:51] gospel that are in prison
[1:09:55] and we're going to bring forth a
[1:09:57] resurrection you and me are going to do
[1:10:00] this two seconds before he was a
[1:10:04] thief two seconds before he was a man
[1:10:06] condemned to
[1:10:09] death one second
[1:10:11] later hand in hand with
[1:10:14] Jesus great Holy
[1:10:16] Spirit preaching to the Lost bring for a
[1:10:21] resurrection pulling them out of Satan
[1:10:25] hand that was an
[1:10:27] overcomer that's what Jesus is doing
[1:10:30] today calling people come out of
[1:10:34] L come out of the every
[1:10:37] system come out of every
[1:10:39] bar out of every Wicked
[1:10:43] attitude no matter how low you
[1:10:46] are from that low point you can put your
[1:10:50] hands in the hands of
[1:10:52] Jesus will lift you
[1:10:58] up to him that
[1:11:01] overcometh like the thief on the
[1:11:04] cross will I grant to sit with me in my
[1:11:08] throne even as I also
[1:11:11] overcame and I'm sat down with my father
[1:11:13] in his
[1:11:16] throne where was he sitting at this
[1:11:19] time with his
[1:11:20] father there is an image as a lamb that
[1:11:24] is
[1:11:26] slain a bloody
[1:11:29] lamb that's where he sits
[1:11:32] now interceding for
[1:11:35] you stay standing in a place where
[1:11:39] Lucifer once accused
[1:11:42] us but now the lamb has taken that
[1:11:45] place and there are no
[1:11:48] accusations against you in that seventh
[1:11:52] dimension Before the Throne of
[1:11:58] God in the eyes of the
[1:12:00] father because of what the son
[1:12:03] did you are
[1:12:05] redeemed you are
[1:12:07] cleansed you are washed you are
[1:12:11] whole God looks down and he sees you
[1:12:14] you're
[1:12:17] overcoming and we might say he must have
[1:12:20] not saw me where I was
[1:12:22] today
[1:12:24] no he didn't he saw the blood that
[1:12:28] covers you and washes you quite as
[1:12:31] snow and gives you a chance
[1:12:35] da to repent every day every let's pray
[1:12:40] Heavenly Father we thank you ask your
[1:12:42] blessings upon your
[1:12:44] word upon your children in Jesus name
[1:12:48] amen amen you may be
[1:12:52] seated
[1:12:59] that really wasn't our message per
[1:13:04] se that's just
[1:13:06] extra and then as and as we all say many
[1:13:11] ministers no charge that was
[1:13:14] extra Matthew
[1:13:17] 11:13 we were there in
[1:13:20] Albuquerque and a brother asked me
[1:13:23] brother
[1:13:24] Daniel what do you say when someone
[1:13:26] tells
[1:13:28] you for all the prophets and the law
[1:13:32] prophesied until
[1:13:36] John and then they tell you that proves
[1:13:41] that there's no more prophets to come no
[1:13:44] more that was his
[1:13:46] question and I said well that's a good
[1:13:50] question I say first of all you ask
[1:13:54] them why they only read you half of a
[1:13:59] scripture and stopped in the middle
[1:14:02] because it's a great
[1:14:03] teaching and scripture connects with
[1:14:07] scripture in the Book of
[1:14:10] Luke it it reads like this Luke chapter
[1:14:15] 1 and verse
[1:14:19] 68 it says blessed be the Lord God of
[1:14:22] Israel
[1:14:23] for he had visited and redeemed his
[1:14:27] people this is Zachariah the father of
[1:14:30] John the Baptist can the holy spirit is
[1:14:33] coming down upon
[1:14:39] him the father of John the Baptist and
[1:14:42] the Holy Spirit is is blessing his
[1:14:46] heart and from his heart is Flowing
[1:14:48] forth prophetic
[1:14:51] word blessed be the the Lord God of
[1:14:54] Israel for he had visited and redeemed
[1:14:57] his
[1:14:58] people and has raised up and Horn of
[1:15:01] salvation for
[1:15:03] us in the house of his servant
[1:15:06] David as he spake by the mouth of his
[1:15:09] holy
[1:15:10] prophets which have been since the world
[1:15:13] beun so now we start getting an
[1:15:17] idea how long the prophetic Ministry has
[1:15:19] been
[1:15:22] around
[1:15:25] here here hear the Bible the Holy Spirit
[1:15:27] speaking through
[1:15:30] Zechariah tells us it has been since the
[1:15:33] world
[1:15:36] began
[1:15:37] Adam not only a Son of God a spoken word
[1:15:41] Son of
[1:15:43] God not born of a woman or have nothing
[1:15:46] to do with with with a man and a
[1:15:49] woman he he was a spoken word son
[1:15:54] God formed his body from the dust of the
[1:15:57] earth and he took that Spirit
[1:16:00] man that he created in Genesis
[1:16:04] 126 and there in Genesis 2 about verse 6
[1:16:07] or
[1:16:08] S God makes a body of of of of the Dust
[1:16:12] of the
[1:16:13] earth and he takes that Spirit man and
[1:16:17] places him into this
[1:16:19] body and now Adam becomes a living
[1:16:23] soul for the soul that was once spoken
[1:16:27] into
[1:16:29] existence in the mind of God now had
[1:16:32] been placed in a body of
[1:16:34] Flesh and it was alive it was living it
[1:16:38] was it's what was making that flesh body
[1:16:46] move so the holy prophets have been
[1:16:49] since the world
[1:16:52] began
[1:16:54] the Reason God rose up prophetic
[1:16:59] Ministries because he uses the prophets
[1:17:03] to reveal his
[1:17:04] Secrets unto unto his
[1:17:07] children so these prophets God's
[1:17:11] servants are revealers of the secrets of
[1:17:13] God's
[1:17:15] word it's not enough that I tell you
[1:17:18] that that's what it
[1:17:20] is but you should require me to tell you
[1:17:22] in the scripture where it's
[1:17:27] at are you requiring me to do
[1:17:30] that yes Jonathan said yes here it is
[1:17:35] Amos 3: 1
[1:17:38] to8 it said hear this word that the Lord
[1:17:41] has spoken against you oh children of
[1:17:44] Israel against the whole family which I
[1:17:46] brought up from the land of Egypt
[1:17:52] saying
[1:17:58] you only have I known of all the
[1:18:01] families of the earth therefore will I
[1:18:03] punish you for all your
[1:18:11] iniquities and if and and if you're
[1:18:13] wondering how the world is treating the
[1:18:15] Jews right
[1:18:17] now and can of and they're asking why do
[1:18:20] they think they're so special
[1:18:25] it says because God said you only have I
[1:18:27] known of all the families of the
[1:18:31] earth I'm sorry but God said they are
[1:18:35] special in my
[1:18:38] eyes just as the bride is special in his
[1:18:42] eyes verse two says can two walk
[1:18:45] together except they be
[1:18:48] agreed will a lion roar in the forest
[1:18:51] when he has no prey
[1:18:54] will a young lion cry out of his den if
[1:18:56] he have taken
[1:19:00] nothing listen what the word saying can
[1:19:03] a bird fall in a snare upon the Earth
[1:19:05] where no Jin is for
[1:19:09] him shall one take up a snare from the
[1:19:12] earth and have and have taken nothing at
[1:19:16] all question after question after
[1:19:20] question God's wanted the the holy
[1:19:23] spirit is wanting you to get in the
[1:19:26] spirit and catch how the spirit's
[1:19:29] moving and by the time you answer all
[1:19:32] these
[1:19:34] questions the last question will be easy
[1:19:37] do you see what the spirit's
[1:19:39] doing how how it's lining things up and
[1:19:43] lining up your thoughts of your
[1:19:46] heart verse three can two walk together
[1:19:48] except they be
[1:19:51] agreed no no will a lion roar in the
[1:19:54] forest when he has no
[1:19:57] prey no no will a young lion cry out of
[1:20:00] his den he have taken
[1:20:04] nothing no can a bird fall in a snare
[1:20:07] upon the Earth where no Jin is for
[1:20:12] him no no shall one take up a snare from
[1:20:16] the earth and have taken nothing at
[1:20:19] all no shall a trumpet be B blown in the
[1:20:23] city and the people be not
[1:20:27] afraid no no no they will be afraid that
[1:20:31] was the purpose of the
[1:20:33] trumpet to warn them that something was
[1:20:37] coming and shall there be evil in the
[1:20:40] city and the Lord ha not done
[1:20:45] it now the Lord doesn't do
[1:20:49] evil but he allows evil to come
[1:20:54] to test his
[1:20:57] children to turn them
[1:20:59] around to turn the hearts of the
[1:21:01] children to the
[1:21:03] father verse seven all of those
[1:21:08] questions you answer we just we
[1:21:11] answered then ver then verse seven God
[1:21:14] speaking through this
[1:21:16] Prophet Amos surely the Lord will do
[1:21:21] nothing but he revealeth his secret unto
[1:21:24] his servants the
[1:21:27] prophets the lion hath
[1:21:31] roared representing Jehovah
[1:21:33] God who will not
[1:21:37] fear and he actually answered that that
[1:21:40] that same
[1:21:42] question when it says the lion hath
[1:21:44] roared who will not
[1:21:46] fear your question is who is
[1:21:49] that well you keep reading and it says
[1:21:53] the Lord has
[1:21:55] spoken that's who has
[1:21:57] roared who can but
[1:22:00] prophesy but no
[1:22:03] longer would the law be
[1:22:06] preached now the prophets will preach
[1:22:08] the kingdom of
[1:22:12] God there was to be a
[1:22:14] change in the prophetic Ministry from
[1:22:17] Old
[1:22:18] Testament to new Luke 16
[1:22:24] and verse
[1:22:26] 16 it reads like
[1:22:30] this the law and the
[1:22:32] prophets were until
[1:22:35] John my Bible doesn't have a period
[1:22:38] there no this the word goes
[1:22:42] on the law and the prophets were until
[1:22:47] John since that time the kingdom of God
[1:22:51] is preached
[1:22:53] and every man presses into
[1:22:56] it the law and the
[1:22:58] prophets were until
[1:23:02] John they're connected
[1:23:05] together the law and the prophets of the
[1:23:08] old
[1:23:09] test until John and yet John was a
[1:23:13] prophet Jesus called him
[1:23:17] Elijah Malachi said that he came in the
[1:23:20] spirit and power of Elijah
[1:23:24] so John was a
[1:23:26] prophet after the law and the
[1:23:29] prophets it says since that
[1:23:34] time since the time of the law and the
[1:23:37] prophets the kingdom of God is
[1:23:40] preached so now the prophetic
[1:23:44] Ministry had completely
[1:23:47] changed the prophets under the law
[1:23:50] brought judgment brought
[1:23:54] chastening brought brought curses upon
[1:23:57] Israel brought judgment upon
[1:23:59] Israel every time they walked away to
[1:24:03] pagan
[1:24:05] gods a prophet would come out of the
[1:24:08] mountains screaming thus sayith the
[1:24:11] Lord you've left Jehovah you left his
[1:24:15] holy altar walk away from Jehovah's law
[1:24:20] and bring judgment upon them
[1:24:23] and they and they'd go into judgment for
[1:24:25] years and
[1:24:26] years and all the Pagan nations would
[1:24:29] beat them
[1:24:31] down until they would finally
[1:24:35] repent and then God would send another
[1:24:39] Prophet to tell them your
[1:24:42] iniquities are
[1:24:44] forgiven your Warfare time is over I'm
[1:24:48] I'm forgiving you of
[1:24:49] that to the law and the prophets
[1:24:53] until John and yet John was a prophet
[1:24:56] but this Prophet John the ministry was
[1:24:59] going to change he was no longer going
[1:25:01] to preach the
[1:25:02] law he was no longer bringing
[1:25:05] judgment now the prophetic
[1:25:08] Ministry would preach the kingdom of God
[1:25:11] is at
[1:25:13] hand now the prophetic Ministry would
[1:25:16] say Behold the Lamb of God is with is
[1:25:19] with
[1:25:20] us Matthew
[1:25:23] 11 verse
[1:25:28] 7 and as they departed Jesus began to
[1:25:32] say unto M the multitudes concerning
[1:25:37] John what went you out to the Wilderness
[1:25:39] to see a reed shaken With the
[1:25:45] Wind you see how God
[1:25:47] writes once again like he did in
[1:25:50] Amos he's giving us questions to
[1:25:54] answer and by the time you answer these
[1:25:56] questions in your
[1:25:59] heart guess what you've
[1:26:01] got you've got the answer to your
[1:26:05] questions see but what when you out to
[1:26:07] see a man clothed in soft rment behold
[1:26:10] they that wear soft clothing are in
[1:26:12] King's
[1:26:18] houses but what when y out to see a
[1:26:21] prophet yay
[1:26:25] I thought the law the prophets were
[1:26:27] until
[1:26:29] John Jesus is saying John is also a
[1:26:33] prophet and he's come after the
[1:26:36] law he said yay I say unto you and more
[1:26:39] than a
[1:26:41] prophet what could be more than a
[1:26:44] prophet a man with more than one
[1:26:48] Ministry Not only was he a
[1:26:51] prophet but he was a
[1:26:53] messenger he was
[1:26:55] Elijah that was
[1:26:58] prophesied that would turn the hearts of
[1:27:00] the fathers to the
[1:27:07] children for this verse 10 for this is
[1:27:09] he of whom it is written behold I send
[1:27:12] my messenger before thy face which will
[1:27:15] which shall prepare thy way before
[1:27:21] thee
[1:27:24] he was a
[1:27:25] forerunner to the first coming of
[1:27:27] Christ you know during the Vietnam
[1:27:31] war they had
[1:27:33] soldiers and and they called them
[1:27:36] forerunners they also called them tunnel
[1:27:41] rats they were the
[1:27:43] ones that would go out
[1:27:46] alone and and and they would and they
[1:27:49] were trained for to search for the Trap
[1:27:52] and and explosives laying in the
[1:27:59] jungles they would go first and they
[1:28:02] would clear a
[1:28:07] path and they didn't just go looking
[1:28:11] everywhere no they wanted to get the
[1:28:13] soldiers from point
[1:28:16] A and to get them to point B so these
[1:28:21] forerunners would go through the
[1:28:23] jungles and and and look for a
[1:28:27] path so wide and they would walk that
[1:28:31] path to make sure that every danger
[1:28:34] every
[1:28:36] explosive that it was clear and
[1:28:40] clean so that when the soldiers so that
[1:28:43] when the Squadron of soldiers would come
[1:28:47] behind they could pass
[1:28:50] safely they could full fulfill their
[1:28:54] mission that was a
[1:28:57] forerunner John was a
[1:28:59] forerunner spiritually speaking you know
[1:29:02] who else was a
[1:29:03] forerunner my uncle
[1:29:06] Zeke innam Vietnam he was stained to do
[1:29:11] just
[1:29:13] that he told us one time that he's
[1:29:16] walking through the
[1:29:18] jungle trying to clear a path
[1:29:22] for the rest to come
[1:29:24] behind and as he's
[1:29:26] walking he said I felt a hand grab my
[1:29:31] foot grabb my ankle and I couldn't move
[1:29:36] it I didn't I didn't think it was a hand
[1:29:40] that had grabbed my
[1:29:43] leg and when I looked down down in the
[1:29:47] grass lay a little
[1:29:50] trigger
[1:29:52] that the Viet had
[1:29:55] placed full of
[1:29:57] explosives one more
[1:29:59] inch I would have stepped on
[1:30:02] it that'd be the end a
[1:30:06] forerunner John the
[1:30:08] Baptist was a
[1:30:10] forerunner but one day he did step on a
[1:30:14] trigger and they cut off his
[1:30:18] head but he did it for the cause of
[1:30:20] Christ
[1:30:22] he he he did it to raise up the standard
[1:30:26] of marriage and divorce before the
[1:30:28] Jewish
[1:30:32] people he told Herod it's not right for
[1:30:36] you to take your brother's
[1:30:39] wife know that's wrong you know God
[1:30:42] hates that you know he hates adultery
[1:30:46] and
[1:30:48] fornication you know he hates you men
[1:30:50] messing around and being un
[1:30:54] faithful he was clearing the
[1:30:57] path for you and I to follow and stay
[1:31:01] true and faithful in in our
[1:31:06] marriages it's God's
[1:31:11] way this verse 10 this is he of whom it
[1:31:14] is written behold I send my messenger
[1:31:17] before thy face which shall prepare thy
[1:31:19] way before thee
[1:31:27] if you rejected John's
[1:31:30] Ministry you probably were going to
[1:31:32] reject Jesus
[1:31:34] Christ because John Was preparing the
[1:31:37] way and John was going to
[1:31:40] introduce Jesus of Nazareth and tell us
[1:31:45] Behold the Lamb of God who taketh away
[1:31:48] the sins of the
[1:31:50] world Amen
[1:31:53] verse 11 verily I say unto you among
[1:31:56] them that are born of women there had
[1:31:58] not risen a greater than John the
[1:32:06] Baptist no man greater than
[1:32:10] John amongst all the men born in the
[1:32:14] world Jesus says there has not risen a
[1:32:18] greater than John the
[1:32:20] Baptist but he also said But now that
[1:32:24] I've said that let me tell you he that
[1:32:28] is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:32:31] greater than
[1:32:32] he so was he the greatest or was he the
[1:32:36] least oh amongst the
[1:32:39] world he was the
[1:32:42] greatest but amongst the children of
[1:32:45] God who have repented and been
[1:32:50] baptized he was the least
[1:32:52] because those are the
[1:32:54] ones that the
[1:32:56] ministry is
[1:32:58] sent to
[1:33:01] serve and you that are the head of your
[1:33:06] house amongst all the husbands in the
[1:33:10] world you're the
[1:33:13] greatest but in your home you're the
[1:33:16] least for you've been
[1:33:19] sent to serve your family
[1:33:22] your wife and your
[1:33:29] children that was extra
[1:33:32] too verse
[1:33:35] 12 and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:33:39] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:33:41] suffereth violence and the violent take
[1:33:43] it by
[1:33:48] for it takes a revelation to catch this
[1:33:51] one
[1:33:53] because this one here is the Fulfillment
[1:33:56] or the beginning and the
[1:33:59] opening of part one the first seal
[1:34:04] Revelations 61
[1:34:05] and2 this is where it it opened up and
[1:34:09] and started coming to
[1:34:12] pass this is when the first seal
[1:34:15] opened this is where the white horse
[1:34:18] rider began his
[1:34:20] ride violence and the violence taken
[1:34:23] taken by
[1:34:25] force was was was the Church of of of
[1:34:32] Judaism and the p and Pagan
[1:34:35] Rome who were persecuting the Believers
[1:34:38] in
[1:34:40] Christ were persecuting those who were
[1:34:42] following John the
[1:34:45] Baptist they're persecuting those that
[1:34:47] were following
[1:34:49] Jesus great violence was was coming to
[1:34:52] the
[1:34:53] believer not the believer who believing
[1:34:56] in the law of
[1:34:58] Moses but the believer who was
[1:35:02] recognizing all the Prophecies of the
[1:35:05] prophets had now fallen on one
[1:35:09] man their name was Jesus Christ and that
[1:35:13] Jesus of Nazareth was mess that he was
[1:35:17] King of the Jews he was their lord he
[1:35:20] was their salvation
[1:35:22] and it's these
[1:35:24] people who are being
[1:35:26] persecuted and suffering
[1:35:29] violence and this was
[1:35:31] Lucifer the white horse
[1:35:33] rider of Revelation
[1:35:36] 62
[1:35:38] persecuting the Church of
[1:35:42] God for all the prophets and the law
[1:35:45] prophesied until
[1:35:49] John period
[1:35:52] but what comes
[1:35:54] next well we just have to read the next
[1:35:57] verse to know it and the next vers say
[1:36:00] and if you will receive this
[1:36:04] answer this is Elijah which was to
[1:36:08] come so the word goes
[1:36:11] on so if this was
[1:36:14] Elias then it's another
[1:36:16] Prophet so the prophetic
[1:36:19] Ministry is continuing
[1:36:22] but God is changing it changing what
[1:36:24] it's going to preach it's now preaching
[1:36:27] the Kingdom of
[1:36:29] Heaven it's now preaching repent and be
[1:36:33] baptized because repentance and baptism
[1:36:36] and
[1:36:37] water was a shadow a
[1:36:40] type it
[1:36:42] represented the washing of the blood of
[1:36:46] Jesus Christ that washes all your sins
[1:36:50] away
[1:36:51] be baptized in water is an outward
[1:36:56] expression an inward work of the spirit
[1:37:01] baptism of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:04] in
[1:37:06] fire god rich in
[1:37:10] Mercy for all the prophets and the laws
[1:37:12] prophesied until
[1:37:14] John and if you will receive it this is
[1:37:18] Elijah which was to come
[1:37:22] he that hath an ear to
[1:37:24] hear Let Him
[1:37:27] hear he that ha an ear to hear
[1:37:30] what what did you hear what did I hear
[1:37:33] when we as we read Matthew 11 here to
[1:37:38] 15 I heard that there was coming a
[1:37:41] drastic
[1:37:43] change to how God wanted the people to
[1:37:50] worship how go how God wanted the
[1:37:52] fathers to treat their
[1:37:55] children how God wanted the mothers to
[1:37:58] be in the
[1:38:01] home I heard that there was great
[1:38:04] changes
[1:38:05] coming even the prophetic
[1:38:09] Ministry if you thought you understood
[1:38:11] it
[1:38:12] well and you were you were a Jewish
[1:38:16] rabbi guess
[1:38:18] what Jehovah just changed everything
[1:38:22] about
[1:38:25] it change isn't
[1:38:29] easy Israel couldn't receive the
[1:38:33] change but that didn't stop
[1:38:35] God he went
[1:38:37] on with
[1:38:39] those with
[1:38:41] those who said change me
[1:38:44] Lord and those that said change me you
[1:38:47] know where they wound
[1:38:50] up 20 wound
[1:38:54] up in an upper room and receiv received
[1:38:57] the promise of
[1:38:59] God but it wasn't
[1:39:02] easy because violence had been taken up
[1:39:06] against
[1:39:11] them Matthew
[1:39:14] 23 and verse
[1:39:18] 34 this is Jesus
[1:39:22] go back and read the whole
[1:39:25] chapter Matthew
[1:39:27] 23 Matthew 23 Jesus is speaking to
[1:39:33] scribes he's speaking to the high
[1:39:37] priest he's speaking to
[1:39:40] lawyers he's speaking to a multitude and
[1:39:43] his
[1:39:45] disciples he's creeping he's speaking to
[1:39:49] Pharisees and and he's talking to them
[1:39:52] and rebuking
[1:39:54] them he's telling them how how they like
[1:39:57] to get be lifted up and be called
[1:40:02] Master then he rebukes them and he says
[1:40:05] but be ye but be not ye called
[1:40:09] Rabbi verse
[1:40:12] 237 but
[1:40:18] 238 for one is your master even Christ
[1:40:21] and all ye are
[1:40:25] brethren in another scripture the
[1:40:27] Apostle Paul says call no man
[1:40:31] father you only one father father which
[1:40:35] is in
[1:40:37] heaven and
[1:40:39] millions called their
[1:40:41] ministers father and even Holy
[1:40:45] Father Holy Father Dominic how are
[1:40:49] you God said don't do that he's your
[1:40:53] brother you want to call him brother
[1:40:55] call him
[1:40:57] brother call her sister call her
[1:41:02] sister so Jesus is here having these
[1:41:07] conversations in verse 13 he begins
[1:41:10] saying unto them woe unto you scribes
[1:41:12] and
[1:41:15] Pharisees he said
[1:41:17] Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom
[1:41:19] of Heaven against verse
[1:41:23] 13 for ye neither go in
[1:41:27] yourselves neither suffer ye them that
[1:41:29] are entering to go
[1:41:31] in in other words you're not hot you're
[1:41:33] not cold you're
[1:41:35] lukewarm I'm I'm going to spew you out
[1:41:37] of my
[1:41:39] mouth and he goes on whoo and whoo and
[1:41:42] whoo and whoo in those
[1:41:46] verses in 17 verse 17 he said he called
[1:41:49] them he fools and blind
[1:41:54] he goes on speaking to
[1:41:59] them and in verse
[1:42:01] 23 he says W one to you scribes and
[1:42:04] Pharisees
[1:42:06] Hypocrites for you pay tithe for you pay
[1:42:10] tithe of mint and anest and
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:17] coming in other words you're paying
[1:42:19] tithe of these little tiny
[1:42:23] things and have omitted the weier
[1:42:25] matters of the
[1:42:28] law judgment mercy and
[1:42:33] Faith these ought ye to have done and
[1:42:36] not to leave the other
[1:42:40] undone he tells them ye blind guides
[1:42:42] would strain at a net and swallow a
[1:42:48] camel and he goes on rebuking them over
[1:42:51] and over
[1:42:54] again Jesus it was we we call the second
[1:42:58] pool of his
[1:43:00] ministry part two Discerning the hearts
[1:43:04] of these religious
[1:43:06] leaders and prophesying over
[1:43:09] them judgment that would come upon
[1:43:12] them for blinding the people of
[1:43:17] Israel verse
[1:43:19] 31
[1:43:21] wherefore ye be Witnesses unto
[1:43:23] yourselves that ye are the children of
[1:43:25] them which killed the
[1:43:32] prophets ye are the children you Jews
[1:43:37] are the children of them that killed the
[1:43:41] prophets who killed God's
[1:43:44] prophets throughout the Old
[1:43:49] Testament the Jews
[1:43:52] killed the prophets of
[1:43:54] God that were sent to
[1:43:56] them if there's ever a
[1:44:00] Ministry that you want to ask the Lord
[1:44:02] not to give
[1:44:06] you it's a prophetic
[1:44:09] one you go through
[1:44:11] history and the prophets always went
[1:44:14] down as
[1:44:17] Martyrs their own people killed them
[1:44:21] because the message of the
[1:44:23] prophet in the Old Testament was always
[1:44:26] a chasing hand of
[1:44:30] God so every time a prophet came into
[1:44:32] their
[1:44:34] midst they knew judgment was
[1:44:37] coming but the law and the
[1:44:40] prophets were until
[1:44:42] John now the prophetic Ministry would
[1:44:46] change the prophetic
[1:44:49] Ministry was to in introduce the Lamb of
[1:44:52] God the
[1:44:54] people and to call the people to repent
[1:44:59] and be
[1:45:00] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:02] CH and you shall receive the baptism of
[1:45:07] the Holy Ghost and
[1:45:10] Fire Jesus in verse
[1:45:13] 33 he discerned the hearts of these
[1:45:15] religious
[1:45:18] leaders he tells them
[1:45:21] ye
[1:45:22] serpents ye Generation of
[1:45:25] Vipers how can you escape the damnation
[1:45:28] of
[1:45:30] hell they
[1:45:32] cannot because they're a
[1:45:34] generation they are the seed of the
[1:45:37] serpent just as sure as you and I are
[1:45:40] the seed of
[1:45:44] God remember the parable of the
[1:45:48] sewer Matthew 13
[1:45:51] it spoke of how many
[1:45:53] seeds two one was the
[1:45:57] wheat and one was the
[1:46:00] tears how do these two seeds
[1:46:04] grow the same water the same Earth the
[1:46:08] same the the the same vitamins in the
[1:46:11] earth it causes them both to
[1:46:14] grow but it doesn't change who they are
[1:46:18] it just manifests who they are
[1:46:22] that's why the Bible says book of
[1:46:25] Hebrews the rain falls on the just and
[1:46:28] the
[1:46:31] unjust there are two
[1:46:33] seeds there are two
[1:46:36] generations one is the generation of
[1:46:38] Jesus
[1:46:40] Christ children of God were in the mind
[1:46:43] of God before the foundation of the
[1:46:45] world the other is a Generation of
[1:46:49] Vipers see of the
[1:46:51] serpent children Cain's
[1:46:54] children and the Bible says in in the
[1:46:58] third Epistle of John Cain was of the
[1:47:01] evil
[1:47:03] one what does that mean a son of the
[1:47:08] devil but we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:47:12] God by his Amazing Grace after Jesus has
[1:47:15] done
[1:47:17] rebuking these ministers these pastors
[1:47:21] these evangelists these these these
[1:47:24] these prophets these
[1:47:27] Apostles he says this in verse
[1:47:31] 34 Jesus
[1:47:33] says and
[1:47:35] remember John has been dead now for more
[1:47:38] than a
[1:47:41] year he's been off the
[1:47:45] scene the law and the prophets were
[1:47:47] until
[1:47:48] John that doesn't have a a period
[1:47:53] no that wasn't the end of the prophetic
[1:47:56] Ministry that was the prophecy of the
[1:47:59] changing of the
[1:48:02] prophetic God would will continue to
[1:48:04] send us
[1:48:08] prophets he said so in verse 34 Jesus
[1:48:12] said wherefore
[1:48:16] behold I jesus send unto you
[1:48:20] prophets long after John is
[1:48:23] dead I'm going to keep sending you
[1:48:26] prophets I'm not going to change my
[1:48:29] program will the world love
[1:48:31] them no the world will hate them they
[1:48:35] always hated God's
[1:48:38] Prophet God has a purpose in sending
[1:48:41] them for they are a revealer of the
[1:48:45] word they help put the loose ends
[1:48:49] together so that we can see Jesus Christ
[1:48:51] in every
[1:48:54] verse wherefore behold I send unto you
[1:48:59] prophets and wise men and scribes and
[1:49:03] some of them you shall kill and
[1:49:07] crucify and some of them you shall
[1:49:09] scorge in your
[1:49:11] synagogues and persecute them from City
[1:49:15] to
[1:49:17] City the prophetic Ministry
[1:49:25] it was always a difficult
[1:49:28] Ministry a hard
[1:49:36] one verse
[1:49:42] 35 he says that upon you may come all
[1:49:45] the righteous blood shed upon the Earth
[1:49:47] from the blood of righteous Abel unto
[1:49:50] the blood of Zacharias son of barachias
[1:49:53] whom ye slew between the temple and the
[1:50:04] altar the Holy Spirit mentions these two
[1:50:08] men they lived thousands of years
[1:50:12] apart because both of
[1:50:15] them were
[1:50:18] prophets verely I say to you all these
[1:50:20] things shall come upon this
[1:50:25] generation then Jesus says verse 37 oh
[1:50:29] Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killest
[1:50:32] the prophets and stonest them which are
[1:50:34] sent unto thee how often would I have
[1:50:37] gathered thy children
[1:50:45] together how did God begin the Gathering
[1:50:48] of his children
[1:50:52] using a prophetic
[1:50:54] Ministry how often would I have gathered
[1:50:57] thy children together even as a h
[1:50:59] gathers her chickens under her wings and
[1:51:01] you would
[1:51:06] not here he is Jehovah God creator of
[1:51:11] heavens and
[1:51:12] earth typing himself to a
[1:51:16] hen Jehovah
[1:51:18] hen
[1:51:23] he's declaring the
[1:51:25] condition of the Church of
[1:51:28] Israel when he came to
[1:51:30] them they were a chicken
[1:51:33] yard pecking on the
[1:51:36] dirt trying to get the little they
[1:51:40] could that's all the religion they
[1:51:43] had when Jesus
[1:51:45] came and he says and I came to you to
[1:51:48] gather you
[1:51:51] to take you where eagles
[1:51:54] fly and you would
[1:51:57] not so then he
[1:52:00] turned at the cross of
[1:52:02] Calvary he gave the inheritance that was
[1:52:05] for
[1:52:06] Israel to a gentile
[1:52:09] people starting with
[1:52:12] 120 on the day of
[1:52:16] Pentecost acts 13 and verse one
[1:52:23] long after John is
[1:52:27] gone at Antioch in
[1:52:30] anti it says this now there were in the
[1:52:34] church that was at Antioch certain
[1:52:37] prophets and
[1:52:41] teachers John had been dead for years
[1:52:45] now as Barnabas and Simeon that was
[1:52:48] called Niger and Lucius of
[1:52:55] serene and man and man which had been
[1:52:59] brought up with Herod the Tetro and
[1:53:05] Saul and as they minister to the to the
[1:53:08] Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost
[1:53:14] said separate me Barnabas and Saul for
[1:53:17] the workto I have called them
[1:53:23] who were these men long after John the
[1:53:26] Baptist had
[1:53:28] died prophets and
[1:53:32] teachers of the
[1:53:35] Gospel preaching the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:53:37] is at
[1:53:39] hand repent and be
[1:53:42] baptized and I'll fill you with the Holy
[1:53:46] Ghost to cleanse you from all unbelief
[1:53:52] in Acts chapter
[1:53:54] 15 again long after John had died and
[1:53:58] passed
[1:54:01] away acts
[1:54:04] 15:30 so when they were dismissed they
[1:54:06] came to Antioch and when they had
[1:54:09] gathered the multitude together they
[1:54:11] delivered the
[1:54:17] epistle which when they had read they
[1:54:20] Rejoice for the
[1:54:23] consolation and Judas and
[1:54:27] Silas being prophets also
[1:54:31] themselves exhorted the Brethren with
[1:54:33] many words and confirmed
[1:54:38] them the law and the prophets were until
[1:54:43] John but that didn't mean that the God
[1:54:46] was ending the prophetic
[1:54:48] Ministry
[1:54:50] the law and the prophets were until
[1:54:53] John now John a prophet and all the
[1:54:56] prophets after him the ministry will
[1:55:00] change they will no longer be bringing
[1:55:04] judgment they will no longer be the
[1:55:06] chastening hand of God on the
[1:55:09] people no they will now preach repent
[1:55:12] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:55:16] Christ they will now preach you can
[1:55:18] receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:55:21] Ghost they will be preaching the Kingdom
[1:55:24] of Heaven is at
[1:55:27] hand because here they are years
[1:55:31] after Jesus had died on the cross was
[1:55:36] buried was resurrected was risen on
[1:55:42] high the day of Pentecost had already
[1:55:46] happened the church was being persecuted
[1:55:50] and Judas and Silas being prophets also
[1:55:54] themselves exhorted the Brethren with
[1:55:57] many
[1:55:58] words and confirmed
[1:56:01] them Acts chapter
[1:56:04] 21 and verse
[1:56:06] 8 he says and it reads like
[1:56:09] this and the next day we that were of
[1:56:12] Paul's company
[1:56:16] departed and came unto cesaria and we
[1:56:19] entered into the house of Philip the
[1:56:25] Evangelist which was one of the seven
[1:56:28] and Abode with him and the same man had
[1:56:31] four
[1:56:32] daughters virgins which did
[1:56:36] prophesy they were not
[1:56:38] propheus but they had a gift of
[1:56:41] Prophecy there's a difference and as we
[1:56:45] carried there many days there came down
[1:56:47] from Judea a certain Prophet named named
[1:56:56] agabus the Bible is full of
[1:56:59] prophets long after John has gone off
[1:57:02] the scene because the prophetic ministry
[1:57:05] didn't
[1:57:06] end God was going to change the way he
[1:57:09] was going to use these
[1:57:12] men verse 11 and when he was come unto
[1:57:15] us he took Paul's
[1:57:18] girdle
[1:57:20] and bound his own hands and feet and
[1:57:23] said this is what God gives his
[1:57:27] prophets whether it's a minor Prophet or
[1:57:30] a or major prophet it's this thus sayth
[1:57:35] the Holy
[1:57:37] Ghost prophets have thus saith the
[1:57:41] Lord in other words it's not them
[1:57:44] talking it's God using them and saying
[1:57:47] thus sayith the Lord
[1:57:50] he says so shall the Jews at Jerusalem
[1:57:52] bind the man that ownest this girdle and
[1:57:55] shall deliver him into the hands of the
[1:58:02] Gentiles this man
[1:58:05] agabus he didn't know who that girlle
[1:58:07] belonged
[1:58:10] to the Holy Spirit just told
[1:58:13] him pick up that girdle and tie your
[1:58:17] hands and feet with it and say thus
[1:58:20] sayith the Lord that the man that onth
[1:58:23] this
[1:58:24] girdle is going to be delivered into the
[1:58:27] hands of
[1:58:28] the into the hands of the
[1:58:31] Romans into the hands of Caesar
[1:58:34] himself thus sayith the
[1:58:37] Lord even Paul being a prophet
[1:58:40] himself couldn't change
[1:58:42] that because it wasn't agabus that
[1:58:47] said it was God that spoke
[1:58:50] through his Prophet
[1:58:53] agabus
[1:58:55] Ephesians chapter
[1:58:57] 3 verse 4 and
[1:59:01] six the prophetic Ministry never
[1:59:05] ended it
[1:59:09] changed by necessity it
[1:59:12] changed because now we had entered into
[1:59:14] a new
[1:59:15] covenant and Jesus Christ is a God
[1:59:19] Prophet he's the prophet of the
[1:59:22] prophets he is the voice of the
[1:59:25] prophets he is the one that spoke
[1:59:27] through the
[1:59:31] prophets Ephesians 3 verse 4 whereby
[1:59:36] when ye read May me understand my
[1:59:38] knowledge and the mystery of
[1:59:42] Christ which in other Ages was not made
[1:59:45] known Unto the Sons of
[1:59:48] men
[1:59:50] in other words the prophets as it is now
[1:59:53] revealed unto His Holy Apostles and
[1:59:55] Prophets by the Holy
[2:00:00] Spirit did you catch
[2:00:03] it that the Gentiles should be fellow
[2:00:06] Hees and of the same body and partakers
[2:00:09] of his promise in Christ by the
[2:00:18] gospel
[2:00:20] in the days of the Apostle
[2:00:22] Paul the the ministerial change of the
[2:00:27] Prophet was
[2:00:29] this to teach the
[2:00:31] Gentiles that they were fellow
[2:00:34] Hees and of the same body and partakers
[2:00:38] of his
[2:00:42] promise that's how God is using His
[2:00:47] prophets today
[2:00:52] 2023 how will you know the prophetic
[2:00:56] Ministry because of the message they
[2:00:59] bring introducing you to the Lamb of God
[2:01:04] how do you know he's a false
[2:01:06] prophet because he introduces you to
[2:01:10] himself because you see him chasing the
[2:01:13] money because you see him chasing
[2:01:16] popularity because you see that he wants
[2:01:18] a big television
[2:01:22] show because he's got to have a Lear jet
[2:01:25] that cost $25
[2:01:31] million God's
[2:01:33] prophets are
[2:01:35] teaching that the
[2:01:37] Gentiles should be
[2:01:39] fellars because of the Cross of
[2:01:41] Calvary and the blood that was shed for
[2:01:44] us and of the same body and partakers of
[2:01:47] his promis in Christ
[2:01:51] by the
[2:01:52] gospel which is the good
[2:01:54] news Malachi
[2:01:56] 4
[2:02:05] verse6 let's let's read verse
[2:02:08] five of Malachi 4 behold I'll send you
[2:02:12] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[2:02:14] the great and Dreadful day of the
[2:02:17] Lord
[2:02:19] so this is an end time
[2:02:23] Prophet this is a prophet that's
[2:02:26] coming not in the Old Testament time but
[2:02:30] he's coming under a new testament
[2:02:34] time and his ministry will be this and
[2:02:38] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[2:02:40] to the
[2:02:42] children remember we've read it in the
[2:02:45] Book of Luke chapter 1 about verse 14
[2:02:49] and
[2:02:50] on where the angel Gabriel who stands in
[2:02:54] the very presence of
[2:02:56] God brought a message to
[2:02:58] Zechariah and he told him Zechariah your
[2:03:01] son
[2:03:02] John he says he'll come in the spirit
[2:03:05] and power of
[2:03:07] Elijah and his ministry will be to turn
[2:03:10] the hearts of the
[2:03:12] fathers to the
[2:03:14] children and the angel Gabriel stopped
[2:03:17] right
[2:03:17] there only read half the
[2:03:21] scripture because the first
[2:03:23] half was to John the
[2:03:25] Baptist the Forerunner to the first
[2:03:29] coming of Christ and the second part is
[2:03:32] the second coming of Christ and there's
[2:03:35] to come an
[2:03:36] Elijah like John came to once again
[2:03:41] preach the kingdom of heav bring us the
[2:03:43] word of God sayth the Lord because the
[2:03:47] denomination
[2:03:50] have only produced
[2:03:51] Creeds produ dogas produce
[2:03:57] progams Holiness is not in the churches
[2:04:01] anymore from the Catholic
[2:04:04] Church to the
[2:04:06] Pentecostal Holiness is not required
[2:04:12] anymore and
[2:04:14] yet God is a god of
[2:04:17] holiness
[2:04:19] and he wants his people to be holy he
[2:04:23] hasn't changed his mind about who he is
[2:04:28] and who he wants you and I to
[2:04:31] be
[2:04:39] luke now I want to read a quote in
[2:04:42] closing I've kept you
[2:04:47] long
[2:04:50] but Karen said I kept the brothers in
[2:04:52] Albuquerque way too long
[2:04:56] too and um so let's I want to read this
[2:04:59] quote on the message standing on the
[2:05:02] Gap
[2:05:06] 1963 brother Bram says
[2:05:09] this he said I want to do something
[2:05:13] different but I was
[2:05:15] told that I'd been called to be a
[2:05:17] prophet he said and I wanted to go live
[2:05:20] in the wilderness like the
[2:05:23] prophets but I was using my own excuse
[2:05:25] so I could go hunt and do my own
[2:05:30] good and God told me but that was the
[2:05:34] prophets of the Old
[2:05:37] Testament you've been called to be there
[2:05:39] in a much higher office than
[2:05:42] that he said if you have more gifts
[2:05:44] besides
[2:05:45] that you was called to pray for the sick
[2:05:48] and to preach the
[2:05:51] gospel in the apostolic
[2:05:54] form you see the prophetic Ministry had
[2:06:03] changed never the same
[2:06:07] again God now was bringing
[2:06:10] us
[2:06:11] salvation and not
[2:06:14] judgment
[2:06:16] forgiveness for all our sins
[2:06:20] for every
[2:06:21] iniquity for all our
[2:06:30] shortcomings what would they be
[2:06:32] preaching Jesus answered verely verily I
[2:06:36] say unto
[2:06:38] you except a man be born of water and of
[2:06:41] the
[2:06:43] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[2:06:46] of
[2:06:47] God and that which is is born of the
[2:06:49] flesh is
[2:06:51] flesh but that which is born of the
[2:06:54] spirit is
[2:06:57] Spirit first John 5 and
[2:07:01] 7 it says this for there are three that
[2:07:04] bear record in heaven the Father the
[2:07:06] word and the Holy Ghost and these three
[2:07:09] are
[2:07:14] one and there are three that bear
[2:07:16] witness in Earth the spirit and the
[2:07:18] water and the blood and these three
[2:07:20] agree in
[2:07:26] one water
[2:07:29] baptism Spirit
[2:07:31] baptism
[2:07:33] represents that all our sins have been
[2:07:37] washed in the blood of
[2:07:39] Jesus and he's washed us white as
[2:07:43] snow what follows this water
[2:07:47] baptism what follows this Holy Ghost and
[2:07:50] Fire
[2:07:53] baptism is that all we need and we're
[2:07:55] good for the rest of our
[2:07:57] lives no no that's just the
[2:08:01] beginning then comes refilling after
[2:08:05] refilling of this blessed Holy
[2:08:08] Spirit what are the
[2:08:10] refilling
[2:08:12] refilling are a
[2:08:16] rescue it's God's holy spirit
[2:08:20] coming from the throne to give you
[2:08:23] strength to
[2:08:25] overcome tomorrow Thursday morning and
[2:08:30] the things you'll go
[2:08:33] through refilling are a
[2:08:37] rescue for a broken
[2:08:40] heart for
[2:08:42] depression for
[2:08:44] sadness for anger for disappointment
[2:08:56] for
[2:08:57] lies the ones we say and the ones that
[2:09:01] are said about
[2:09:03] us for anxieties for doubts for Fears
[2:09:09] for low
[2:09:11] self-esteem for
[2:09:13] rejection at home at
[2:09:17] work
[2:09:19] schol for
[2:09:21] vengeance for
[2:09:23] arrogance for
[2:09:25] complexes and there's more but all you
[2:09:28] need to
[2:09:30] know is there is a
[2:09:33] refilling and a
[2:09:35] renewing of the holy
