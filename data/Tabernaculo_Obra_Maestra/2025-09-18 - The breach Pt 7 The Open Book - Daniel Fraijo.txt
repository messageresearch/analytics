I'll see you all soon. Also in a great gathering time when the dead in Christ shall rise, those that we thought we lost, they'll rise first. The Bible says, "And we'll meet them all in the air, and Jesus will be present to take us to the wedding supper of the lamb." And guess who this wedding supper is in honor of? You and I. All his family. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

Cornelio Garcia. &gt;&gt; We leave Thursday again the 25th and we return again on Tuesday, September 30th. &gt;&gt; So keep us in your prayers. um in traveling. &gt;&gt; Um it's more for young men, &gt;&gt; but God has called this old man to go. So, so we certainly appreciate all your prayers. As we stand tonight for the reading of God's word, we're continuing &gt;&gt; in uh the breach. part seven &gt;&gt; and the subject the the open book. &gt;&gt; Turn with me in Genesis chapter 3 and verse 23. A breach occurred in the beginning. A code of conduct had been broken. And when it was God's son and God's daughter, God had to apply his word to them. He said, "In the day that you eat of that tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that day you'll surely die." And and it will and it will break a friendship that I have with you. it it it it will cancel a tutorship that I was tutoring you with. And when the breach occurred just as God said he would do, he did it. Genesis 3 and verse 22. He says, "And the Lord God said, behold, the man is become as one of us." So man had a choice. That's what this is telling us. &gt;&gt; God made him a free moral agent to make a choice between two things. And then God tells us the choice he made to know good and evil. That's what Adam chose. That's what Eve chose. And now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever. God said, "I won't let my children live. I won't let them live in sin." And partake of this tree of life also. He says um so he so so he said in verse 23 says &gt;&gt; therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden &gt;&gt; to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of go of of the garden of Eden cherubims. I believe it was the same seven angels that appeared on Sunset Mountain. For the ones on Sunset Mountain caught a prophet up in that constellation and they told him, "Go back to go back east and we're going to give you the revelation, the seven parts of redemption. These were the angels that were going to open the book. So if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, then I believe they're the same ones that closed it at the beginning because God is unchanging in all his ways. He says, "So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims. more than one, seven, and a flaming sword. But the sword was only one which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for opening, this book, this book of redemption, this book of salvation, this book of healing virtue, th this plan that makes us a new creation if we'll surrender our lives to the author of this book, you the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Revelations 5 1-3 is the vision in symbol form of how the throne of God stood immediately after the fall of man. Revelations 5 was the was the vision. But Genesis 3 &gt;&gt; was where John was looking to &gt;&gt; and what he saw when God opened it up to him, when God let him see some of what Moses had seen. And when he looked back all the way to Eden in a vision, that's when he saw what he wrote in Revelations 5:1. And I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne. That throne back in Eden, that throne back in Genesis, you say that was a throne. &gt;&gt; It was a judgment throne. And he was judging his children. He was judging the serpent. And I saw on the right hand of him that was back in Eden that sat on a throne and a book written within. And on the backside I saw it sealed with seven seals. John was looking back. God had opened his eyes to see that day in Genesis 3 when he put his children out of his presence. And I saw a strong angel verse two proclaiming with a loud voice. It was God now changing forms, descending, coming lower to get closer to you and I. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who was who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof to open this plan of redemption. There is the throne of God. And now it sat for 4,000 years of man's existence, waiting for a worthy one to to open the book, to open the plan of redemption that was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. his plan to save you and I, knowing that that what we would do, knowing that we would make the wrong choices. And yet in his mind was a plan to save you to redeem you to give you overcoming power. And that plan was in mind before the foundation of the world. Verse three, it says, "And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon." And John stopped for a minute. The vision broke. He come back to earth for a second. And when he did, he said, "And I wept much when I fell out from under that anointing. When the vision broke before me, &gt;&gt; when I wasn't seeing anything else, oh, he said, I wept because of what I did see, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. Even as John is seeing this vision and weeping at what he's seeing and hearing a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book and the angel made this proclamation looking for 4,000 years. And John says, "And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth. John in the vision was watching this angel, watching him look, watching him reject Moses, watching him reject Abraham, watching him reject David, watching him reject prophet after prophet. Check. No. No. Not worthy. Not worthy. Not worthy. man who John thought surely this one is worthy. Surely it's Abraham. Surely it's Moses. Surely it's Zerabel. Oh, why couldn't it be Samuel? Maybe Malachi. And he and he and he saw God reject them all. No. No. No man in heaven, nor in the earth, &gt;&gt; neither under the earth. No man in heaven, no man who had died and gone nor in the earth, no man who was still alive, neither under the earth. No one who had just recently died was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. But what John wasn't realizing that what he saw was past was history. It wasn't present nor was it future in the message. The breach paragraph 116. This is where I made this connection between Revelations 5 and Genesis 3. He says, "Now, oh my, the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner, Almighty God. The title deed to the earth and to eternal life." When Adam forfeited it, then Satan's dirty hands could not take it. &gt;&gt; So, it went back to its original owner. Oh, only someone with clean hands could handle this book. Only someone with clean with a clean heart could handle this book. Only someone with a clean life could take this book. that someone is Jesus Christ. And when he makes you a new creation, now that someone &gt;&gt; is you because he's given you a clean heart and clean hands because he has washed you with the blood of the lamb. So it went back to its original owner, God himself. He says, "We're going to find it in just a minute." There he sits on the throne with it in his hand. &gt;&gt; What throne? &gt;&gt; Oh, that throne back in Genesis. &gt;&gt; The title deed. Oh, that makes me feel religious, friends. The title deed to eternal life. The abstract title deed to eternal life. When Adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith, it went back to the hands of the owner. Almighty God, what a great thing. What's it doing? In the hands of God, God waiting for redemption claims. He made a way of redemption. He made a way back. Oh, and this morning he's still this evening he's still a redeemer. He's still making a way back tonight for his children. He made a way back and someday the redeemer is to take it back. Someday the redeemer will take back the earth. But before he takes back the earth, he's preparing you and I. He's taking us back. And when he takes us back, this world will follow a cleansing. Also, you see where we're getting to now? Then he says, "We'll watch this fella sitting upon the throne." So, what is Revelations 5 1-3? God waiting for the redeemer. And even as John is seeing this part of the vision, he he's weeping, not realizing that what he is seeing is history without a revelation. We'll read the Bible. We don't know if it's past. We don't know if it's present. We didn't know if it was future. But tonight, we're seen by the grace of God. We can live in the will of God. For we know this great plan of redemption. We've recognized our day. We've recognized our message. We've recognized our messenger, the Holy Spirit with us tonight. Redemption has come. He's done the work already. What John was seeing in those first three verses. &gt;&gt; It was even history for John when he was seeing it. &gt;&gt; It was Boaz. He had made redemption's claim on Naomi and Ruth. &gt;&gt; That's what was happening. For Boaz is Christ and Naomi represents a Jewish church and Ruth represents a Gentile church, the bride of Christ. In the book of Ruth, chapter 3 and verse 18, it reads like this. Then said she, [Music] "Sit still, my daughter, until thou know the matter how the matter will fall. For the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day." Naomi, &gt;&gt; the the Jewish church, &gt;&gt; Ruth, Ruth, &gt;&gt; a gentile bride, &gt;&gt; Boaz, &gt;&gt; Christ himself. &gt;&gt; He says, "For the man, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; will not rest until he has finished the thingless day." What day? That day on Calvary, what day? Those days he laid in the tomb. or his body did. What day? The day he rose again. He'll not rest until he's completed this work of redemption. He wouldn't rest until he's made a way back. Oh, through the sacrifice of his blood. &gt;&gt; Second Peter 3:9, &gt;&gt; it says, "The Lord," &gt;&gt; second Peter 3, and verse 9. &gt;&gt; The Lord is not slack. &gt;&gt; Second Peter 3 and verse 9. &gt;&gt; The Lord is not slack concerning his promise. When the angel of the covenant descended looking for someone who was worthy to open the book and 4,000 years passed, the Lord wasn't slack. No, the Lord was waiting for you and I to be born on the face of this earth. No, he was patient. He was waiting for you and I. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but is longsuffering to us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. Why has God waited all these thousands of years? because not willing that any should perish, knowing that the sin of Adam and Eve and had now commit committed every son and daughter of God to bypass the spoken word to be born through a natural birth. So God has been patient. God has been long-suffering. Revelations 5 and5 And one of the elders saith unto me, &gt;&gt; God was patient, &gt;&gt; waiting to become a man, &gt;&gt; a kinsman for you and me. And one of the elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe of Judah. The first three verses was history. &gt;&gt; And John couldn't see it. He didn't understand it. He had seen the vision. But God didn't give him the revelation of that vision. In verse five, he says, "Then one of the elders saith unto me, &gt;&gt; weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David have prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof." When John When John saw this, &gt;&gt; it was already history for John. But John had lived in this history [Music] and the revelation wasn't coming yet. &gt;&gt; To have a vision that God gives you is one thing, but if God doesn't give you the revelation of it, that's something else. He can give you a vision, but maybe he won't give you the revelation. At that time, someone might say, "I thought the lamb first opened the book." No, no, no. It was the lion of the tribe of Judah who first opened this sevensealed book of redemption and the book that was being opened to Israel by the line of the tribe of Judah. The book represents the relationship &gt;&gt; between you and God. &gt;&gt; The book represents represent &gt;&gt; the friendship we lost. The book represents &gt;&gt; the teaching and personal tutorship of the Holy Spirit. That's what this seven seal book represents for you and I. But the book also represents a son being asked of God. You have need of squirrels. Just speak it. What was it telling us? &gt;&gt; The book was open and the friendship had been restored. &gt;&gt; The book was open and the personal teaching of the Holy Spirit has been restored and God asked the son again in the 20th century, "Your hunting, you have need of squirrels. Where would you like them? If you've ever had an experience where you're praying, you really needed a job. You say, "Lord, I need a job today." And God gave you a job today. &gt;&gt; You know what you you know what you just experienced? A friendship has been restored with the father. A teaching and personal tutorship has begun. Go back and listen to that message. &gt;&gt; 1959, speak to this mountain. The Holy Spirit tells the prophet, &gt;&gt; it's the beginning of your new ministry. But he was a type and a shadow &gt;&gt; representing what God would do for every son and daughter in this day. He was a wave offering at harvest time. The first to have this experience, but he wouldn't be the last. Oh, someone tonight say, "I've had these experiences. &gt;&gt; I have, too. That's why we know it's real. When the magi came, they were following the star. That's what that's what we have done. We first began following this star, following this this messenger, following this prophetic manifestation. When the magi were following the star, which represents the messengers of the ages, which represents the forerunners at the first and second coming. And it entered and they entered into Jerusalem. And they couldn't see the star no more. But they thought, "But we're in Jerusalem, the holiest city in the world, the holiest people in the world. Surely this is where you'll be born. in this great city called Jerusalem. And they walked in and Matthew 2 and verse one tells us some of the story. Says, "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he? that is born king of the Jews. For we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him. Wise men today still understand because they seen the manifestation of Malachi 4. Because they seen the pattern of that same ministry. Wise men today, they still say, "Where is he? Messiah, &gt;&gt; King of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He came first as the lion of the tribe of Judah doing what? In Matthew 13 and verse 10, it says, "And the disciples came and said unto him, why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, &gt;&gt; because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it's not given. That was the reason for the parables. That was the reason for a prophet with a third grade education. That was the reason for a completely uneducated man to be the forerunner in this day. He said, "Why I speak in parables myself? I can hardly read my own writing. Sometimes God could have brought another apostle Paul, but it was the season when he was going to hide these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent. This revealed word is only for his children. This revealed word is only for the predestinated ones. This revealed word. You must be born again to even read your Bible to understand it. You don't need an education. We need a revelation. Verse 12. For whosoever hath to him shall be given. And he shall have more abundance. But whoever But whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away, even that he hath. He's speaking of revelation. He's not talking about money. He's not talking about cars. He's not talking about homes. He's talking of revelation. Matthew 13:34. Matthew says, "All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables, and while the parable spoke he not unto them, the parables were prophecies. The parables was the thoughts that was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. The parables was a plan of redemption &gt;&gt; hidden to all &gt;&gt; except his children. &gt;&gt; Verse 35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. Things that only Adam had heard, things that only Adam had parttook of had been lost. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came, &gt;&gt; he says, "I'm opening it back up. This plan &gt;&gt; for your salvation, and I'm going to tell you all about it, and it will change your lives. If you do as I say, &gt;&gt; if you're obedient &gt;&gt; and not disobedient, &gt;&gt; I'll cause you to grow &gt;&gt; unto the stature of a perfect man, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ our Lord. Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house. And his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field. They asked for revelation. Jesus, he was born the king of the Jews. &gt;&gt; And that's the line of the tribe of Judah. He told his disciples in Matthew 10 and verse 5, he said, "These 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them, saying, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into the city of the Samaritans, enter ye not." This was their ministerial commission. his 12 apostles. Don't do these two things because right now this message, this plan of redemption, I'm I want to offer it to the firstborn of Israel first. He says verse six, &gt;&gt; "But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel in Luke in Lucas chapter 19 and verse 29." It says this, "And it came to pass when he was come nigh to Beth Page and Bethany at the mount called the Mount of Olives, He sent two of his disciples, &gt;&gt; saying, "Go ye into the village over against you, &gt;&gt; in the which at your entering you shall find a colt tied. It was prophecies of the prophets unfolding, wherein yet never a man sat, loose him, and bring him hither. And if any man ask you, &gt;&gt; why you're stealing this donkey, &gt;&gt; why you why do you loose him? &gt;&gt; Thus shall ye say unto them, because the Lord hath need of him, there was an anointing on them to do this simple act. Go find this little donkey. You'll find him tied up in a certain place. Just untie it and take him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What if someone tries to stop us? The anointing of me will be upon you. &gt;&gt; And say these words that I'll tell you. &gt;&gt; The Lord has need of him. The anointing shook that owner. Take him then. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they that were sent went their way. and found even as he said unto them, it was thus saith the Lord. And as they were loosing the coat, the owners therefore said unto them, why loose ye the coat, why you taking him? That's my coat. And they said, "The Lord hath need of him." And they brought him to Jesus. and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set Jesus thereon. It was a tremendous anointing that day. That's the way kings came in. And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of olives, The whole multitude of disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying, "Blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and glory &gt;&gt; in the highest." They crowned their king. He He rode into Jerusalem. But it was going to be the beginning of the greatest ministry ever because he would give his life for you and I. We consider that the end of a ministry. &gt;&gt; We consider that all hope is lost. when someone dies. But when Jesus died, no one took his life, he gave it up for you and I. And when he laid in the grave for three days, no one gave him life. He raised himself up again to let us know. I hold the keys &gt;&gt; to life, to death, to heaven, to hell. The king of verse five of Revelations 5. And one of the elders saith unto me, &gt;&gt; weep not, behold a lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David hath prevailed to open the book. &gt;&gt; He opened it to Israel and to loose the seven seals thereof. And he preached them in a parable in Matthew 24. The king of the Jews, the lion of the tribe of Israel in the first coming of Christ, he came with the open book in his hand. and he loosed the seven seals thereof. &gt;&gt; Revelation six is a is a prophecy &gt;&gt; if you read it of six seals. &gt;&gt; But in that prophecy &gt;&gt; when that chapter unfolds it speaks that every seal is open. Do you know where Revelation 6:1 began? And the opening of every seal began in the days of Jesus in his earthly ministry. He opened that book to Israel first. Matthew 13:35. Matthew reaches back into the Old Testament prophets anointed of the Holy Spirit and he says, "Why the reason for all the parables? Why the reason for all the visions? Why? The reason for all the allegorories and the metaphors from Genesis to Revelations that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying, "I'll open my mouth in parables. I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world." The first thunder was loosed. said, "What is a thunder?" &gt;&gt; A thunder is the voice of God when a seal opens. When Jesus began speaking and opened that first seal, the first thunder sounded, the thunder was the symbol. It just meant the plan of redemption to take you back into my presence &gt;&gt; has begun in the days of Jesus. Verse 36 of Matthew 13. Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And his disciples came unto him, saying, &gt;&gt; Declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field. I say, "Lord, come into your house tonight and declare unto each and every person, both young and old, rich or poor, &gt;&gt; man or woman, as they pray in their hearts, and say, Lord, not my will, but thine be done." Revelations 5 verses 5 to 10. It shows the ministerial change from the lion of the tribe of Judah to the lamb of God as king. His ministry was only to the Jews. As lamb of God, it was to all the people. Revelations 5 verse 5 to 10. was the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ in the in these two climaxes &gt;&gt; of the beginning as lion of the tribe of Judah and at Gethsemane accepting &gt;&gt; his lamb ministry. So verses 5 to 10 measure a space of the three and a half years of Jesus ministry. Remember when the angel of the Lord came to the shepherds in Luke chapter 2 &gt;&gt; beginning at verse 10. He says, "And the angel said unto them, Fear not, &gt;&gt; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. And the angel said unto them, he was speaking to the shepherds. Now, fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which which will be to all people. It was a prophecy &gt;&gt; of the lamb ministry. &gt;&gt; And that ministry of the lamb was to be to all people, Jew and Gentile alike. For unto you, is born this day in the city of David, a savior which is Christ the Lord. That was speaking of the lamb ministry. When the when the wise men came, they said, "Where is he?" Born king of the Jews, but to the shepherds, he said, &gt;&gt; he says, "For behold, I'll bring you great tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people." &gt;&gt; The Magi spoke of his lying ministry, &gt;&gt; the shepherds, spoke of his lamb ministry. Both spoke of the same man who was worthy to open the book, Jesus Christ. Revelations 5:es 5 to10. It speaks of both and shows the order and reveals the change of the ministry of Jesus Christ from lion to lamb. And it happened in three and a half years. And it happened from verse 5 to verse 10 in Revelations 5. And one of the elders said unto me, "Weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe of Judah, the root of David hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. It had begun. the plan of redemption &gt;&gt; and the first seal had opened in the days of Jesus in the days of John the Baptist for 33 and a2 years of the ministry of Jesus. He was born king of the Jews. And on the cross of Calvary, it was written, "This is Jesus, &gt;&gt; King of the Jews." But he really died, the lamb of God at Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; He went in and accepted a ministerial change. &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; this cup if it's possible for it to pass from me. It was the man part but the lamb in him said but not my will but thine be done. The flesh part says Lord why do I have to be going through this problem right now? But the lamb nature within us. It says, "But Lord Jesus, not my will but thine be done." Verse six, it says, "And be and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth unto all the earth." The lamb ministry was now reaching out to everyone upon the face of the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne. Where did the lamb take the book from? From him that sat on the throne. It said the lion had the book. But he didn't go to the lion to take the book. He went back to the original holder, &gt;&gt; the original owner that sat on the throne. Remember this is symbols. But how did it really unfold? You can read it in Matthew 26 and Luke 22. But Jesus walked into the garden of Gethsemane, the line of the tribe of Judah, with the book he had opened in his hands. And he walked out the lamb of God with the same book in his hands to unfold the lamb part of the book. The book didn't really change hands. God simply changed his ministry. &gt;&gt; God and for you know and morphing &gt;&gt; changes forms but God in morphing &gt;&gt; also changes ministry and God immorph will also change our lives if we surrender to him. God simply changed his ministry. &gt;&gt; If you surrender the eye gate and the lamb will reveal to you things that your eyes have never seen. If you surrender the ear gate and you will hear the lamb tell you things that your ears have never heard. That's when you are eating the book. Now is the promise. When the book was to change hands again. Let's read it. Let's read it where another ministerial change was to take place. But in our day, Revelations chapter 10 and verse 8. &gt;&gt; John in a vision. And he says this, &gt;&gt; "Much is said of the first seven verses of Revelations 10. They are history, &gt;&gt; but we're really living in the in the fulfillment of Revelations 10:8-11. But the world and men have put a period like there's only seven verses in Revelations 10, but the first seven are history. But these are prophecies for you and I verse 8, Revelations 10. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said, "Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel, which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. Did you catch it? Where John was told to go get the book?" He didn't go to get the book from the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; That's verse seven. He was told, "Go and take the little book which is open &gt;&gt; in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. That angel is the angel of the covenant. That angel &gt;&gt; is Christ himself. Then John, &gt;&gt; a type of the bride, &gt;&gt; he says, "And I went unto the angel and said unto him, &gt;&gt; give me the little book." And he said unto me, take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth, sweet as honey." And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon I as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings. Long after &gt;&gt; the prophet of to the Leodysian church is off the scene. [Music] Long after the seventh angel is gone, God is calling you and I to take this book and to eat it. Why did John have to take it from the angel of the covenant himself, which is Christ himself? &gt;&gt; Because it's going to be &gt;&gt; and it must be a personal experience with Jesus Christ. Revelations 10 8-11 is the prophecy of the book changing hands &gt;&gt; from one man the seventh angel &gt;&gt; to a many membered body called the bride of Jesus Christ. Just like it happened when a one-man ministry called Jesus of Nazareth when he ascended on high, he said, "Go ye terry in Jerusalem not many days from today. You 120 will be endued with power from on high." Oh, we're here again. &gt;&gt; Where are you? Maybe just 20. God is saying, "I will endure you with power from on high. I'll do it again like I did it then." And you and I can have our Pentecost, a personal experience with Jesus Christ. Verse 9 of Revelations 10. And I went unto the angel and said unto me, Give me the book. And he said unto me, take it and eat it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter cuz it started to change my life &gt;&gt; immediately. And he said unto me, &gt;&gt; "Thou bride of Christ, &gt;&gt; thou lamb's wife, &gt;&gt; thou must prophesy again. You will now take this message to many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." Revelations 10:8-11 is the prophecy of this book changing hands from the hands of Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; to the hands of Revelations 19. Turn with me to Revelations 19 as we're closing tonight. Revelations 19 beginning at verse five and it says, "And a voice came out of the throne, saying, praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great, all the servants, all the ministries, all the prophets, all the apostles, all the Levites, all who have preached the gospel. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and the voice of many waters. A prophet said, "Those are his preachers. That is the voice of mighty thunderings, the preachers bringing the word of God, showing that a seal has been opened. What is a thunder? &gt;&gt; It's the voice of God. When a seal is open, &gt;&gt; what is the voice of mighty thunderings? &gt;&gt; It's all seven seals have been loose. Saying allelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent reignth. Then he says, "Let us be glad and rejoice &gt;&gt; and give honor &gt;&gt; for the book has changed hands now. For the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready." &gt;&gt; Eleazar brought her to the feet of Isaac. Rebecca, &gt;&gt; that's what's happening here. his servants, his voices, preaching the gospel, loosing seven thunders, the mysteries of God, salvation for all his children. &gt;&gt; And when they're done, &gt;&gt; they present Rebecca &gt;&gt; to Isaac, &gt;&gt; and they walk away for their ministry &gt;&gt; is done. &gt;&gt; Now it's Rebecca and Isaac, and &gt;&gt; now it's you and Jesus. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of you and I is come. [Music] The marriage of the lamb has come. And his wife, a many membered body, have made herself ready with a revealed word, with a book that was open. And to her was granted that she would be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me, write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb. Blessed are those that have eaten this book, that will sweeten their mouth like honey, that bitter in their bellies while you were on this earth because it'll give you a right to s with the king at the marriage supper of the lamb. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God is good. &gt;&gt; And the book has changed hands. &gt;&gt; It's in your hands. It's in my hands and Jesus himself has given it to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is finished. &gt;&gt; This is God's great desire to put the book back into the hands of another original owner, a son and daughter of God. You and I are original owners. And because of that, we have a God-given right to hold the book, to read the book, and to have revelation of this great plan of redemption. We're back now where Adam fell. The generation gap has been bridged. &gt;&gt; The friendship has been restored. &gt;&gt; Will you take the book tonight justification and surrender the flesh realm? Surrender your eyes, your ears, the touch, the smell, the taste. It's your first pool. to eternal life. &gt;&gt; Oh, will you take this book tonight of sanctification &gt;&gt; and surrender your spirit realm, &gt;&gt; memory, imagination, conscious affection, reason. It's your second pull to eternal life. Will you take the book &gt;&gt; this night directly from the hand of the angel of the covenant? Commit to a total surrender of all unbelief. say, "Not my will, but thine be done." And the baptism of the Holy Ghost places you right at that spot where Adam fell, a son being adopted, a friendship, &gt;&gt; restored the night. When you leave, that can be your testimony. You can say I have done what God has asked me to do. I take back the book. &gt;&gt; It's my book. I'm an original owner and I'm going to live a life worthy of the gospel. God is big enough to give you that ministry. &gt;&gt; How big is our God? Big enough to give us sound doctrine. Big enough to give us sound bodies. Big enough to give us sound minds in a time when the world is losing theirs. Big enough to give us sound churches. Big enough to give us sound families. giving us big enough to give us sound fellowship. He's big enough to give us friendships restored with one another. And I want to tell you tonight that these are the sounds of a rushing mighty wind that's with us today of the presence of Jesus Christ in the form of the comforter as we stand to our feet. [Music] the presence of Jesus Christ in the form of the comforter who has come, &gt;&gt; who is here, who wants to live in you tonight. All he's asking you is to is to acknowledge &gt;&gt; I'm an original owner. this book is mine and just like Jesus who prayed in the garden. He says life can be hard but Lord Jesus not my will thine be done in Jesus name. Let's pray. Heavenly father we thank you tonight. Lord for being here with us, for speaking to every heart. But more than speaking, I believe you're changing hearts little by little, one inch at a time, but you're making great changes in all our lives. And for this, we thank you for in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joseph had come a song like to try and sing. I'm not sure if we have this one. Uh Abby, &gt;&gt; soften my heart with oil.

It just keeps appearing to me. &gt;&gt; I'm not seeing I'm not seeing anything like a lamb or anything like that. &gt;&gt; It just it's in my heart &gt;&gt; because the the scripture says the lamb of God took the sins of away from us.
