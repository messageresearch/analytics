you and he's cleansing our hearts renewing our minds making us more like him giving us a life in in this body of Flesh just like the life he lived when he was here on Earth so we're thankful for that uh we've been speaking on the on a subject we started last Sunday what does Jesus really look like so we'd like to continue and we want to begin reading in in Ephesians 4:11 the Apostle Paul speaking to the Ephesian Church brother brandham said the Ephesian church was was a was a very dedicated church thean church was a very dedicated Church they were a spiritual church they had Revelation so that that's why Paul spoke to them the way he did in this epist and verse 11 says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this even we pray that something will be said for each and everyone that's here for not everyone is is needing the same thing but each and every one of us needs something from you tonight so you alone the great discerner of our hearts you can meet that need in our lives you can touch us so we won't go out the way we came in we'll go out better we we'll we'll go out Victorious we'll go out with more courage we'll go out with Greater Hope we'll go out with our faith being increased we thank you now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated what does Jesus really look like we we began on Sunday Sunday was Palm Sunday and Palm Sunday was the day that Jesus rode into Jerusalem and and by the end of the week on Friday uh uh would would begin the the Passover feast and and he would be arrested on that Friday he would be he would be taken before Pontius pilot now even even what they had done on that Friday the the the the Pharisees taken him captive into the night uh and then and then they took him before Pontius pilot but by that Sunday by by by the end of the Sabbath which I believe was was for us would be like Sunday morning J Jesus was on a cross he had given up his Spirit he had ascended on high he had paid the price that I owed but I couldn't pay it he died for me that day he shed his blood and by his stripes I am healed and he gave me a promise that because he unsent because he ascended on high that I could be born again because the natural be birth that's the curse on Mankind and the New Birth the Born Again experience that's the supernatural blessing that puts you back in fellowship with the father and what begins that new birth experience and what begins that experience is what the is what John the Baptist spoke to the people of without them knowing John was teaching them the very first step to get back into fellowship with God and he said repent and be baptized and but he gave them no name it was a detail that would come later that would complete this this beginning this first step it was it was prophecy being fulfilled but John didn't hold all the details he only had a portion and when he gave his portion his ministry was done but Revelation wasn't over though though Elijah would go off the scene Jesus would remain the Holy Spirit and add more detail to the prophecy repent and be baptized John said and under a great anointing Jesus one day in a parable added more detail to this Supernatural experience that takes us back into the presence of God where we can talk with him daily then and know that he hears us and Jesus said before he ascended on high he gave a Great Commission to the church he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel teaching them to be baptized in John's in John's baptism yes but more Jesus was going to add more detail to the prophecy that's how every Prophecy in the Bible is there was always more detail coming sometimes it would come a few months later sometimes it comes a few years later sometimes it comes hundreds of years later like Isaiah spoke a virgin shall conceive there was going to be more detail to that but it wouldn't come for another seven 00 years oh are we prepared to wait on God by faith tonight knowing he'll keep his word appointed season he'll add the details that we need so Jesus wasn't doing away with what John said he was going to add more detail to it so so what he said in Matthew 28 Jesus was speaking in a parable and in a parable he said teaching them to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit it was a prophecy it was a parable and it was 100% the truth but in the parable was hidden the name or does anyone think that Jesus told a lie for the first time careful watch out because once a man tells One Lie when will you know if he won't tell it the next time unless he's been born again but Jesus said teaching them to be baptized in the name of the father of the son and of the Holy Spirit and it was 100% the truth but he spoke it in a parable he spoke it in symbols so laying in this prophecy so laying so in this prophy was yet a revelation a supernatural understanding so we needed more detail and three years later in the day of Pentecost another Prophet rose up another one rose up the Apostle Peter both Apostle and prophet and on the day of Pentecost God gave him the revelation of what John was doing and what Jesus had added to it now Peter comes before them and Men ask him Peter what shall we do to be saved you see Peter was preaching to the masses and many of those had been at the crucifixion of Jesus some of them that were there had shouted crucify him at pilate's tribunal and and and and Peter's message convicted them and they said oh my goodness what have we done we've cried out to crucify our Messiah our Lord our King then they rose up and said Peter what what could we men and women like us what could we do to be saved Peter said nothing no hope for you no he didn't say that we might have said it but Peter even Peter before he was converted might have said it but under the anointing to the prophetic anointing to those who had cried crucify him he told them repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved and you'll receive the gift of the Holy Spirit the first step to many steps the first filling to many refilling oh hallelujah hallelujah feeling after feeling after that means trial after trial after trial that's why the refilling come the refilling of his spirit is not a reward no no no it's to help you overcome trials it's to help increase your faith it's to help you get closer to him it's not a reward for being good there's not one of us good no not one only him it's his goodness that we want we have none but when we have him we have everything we have peace we have joy we have longsuffering we have the love of God in our heart we have light instead of Darkness that's what Jesus really looks like who is he this Jesus he's a king he's the lion of the tribe of Judah he's the lamb of God he's a Prophet evangelist Apostle he was a teacher he is the chief pastor of this flock the fful ministry of Jesus is what he gave to to us it's what he gave to the church what he gave to this mystical body of Jesus Christ Ephesians 4 and verse one let's read that Ephesians 4 and 1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called how do we walk worthy how with all loneliness and meekness verse two with long suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace that's why Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers Paul was just saying amen and teaching the same thing Jesus taught what the Apostle Paul taught what pet taught what James taught joh taught Jesus said it all Jesus taught it all they just came behind him saying the same thing maybe in their own words Paul said it as a man with a great education Peter said it as a man with no education John said it as a man that would put his head on his bosom verse four there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one b baptism one message then the message is Christ William brandham the only message he hadam was Christ there's no such a thing as William bram's message if he was a prophet of God and he was then he brought to us God Christ he brought to us one Lord One Faith one baptism verse six he brought to us one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all then Paul says but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ to everyone he says he extends the grace of God no matter how low we have fallen right no matter if we spent a few nights in jail or a few years he extends Grace wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive what that means is the testimony of when Jesus died on the CR Cross of calv his body lay in a tomb on a stone slab but the spirit went in down to Hell to that Fifth Dimension but he took a friend with him the thief on the cross and both of them together descended and there in that Fifth Dimension half of that Dimension is hell it's a prison house where the Lost go to wait waiting for Judgment Day waiting for a great white Throne judgment but the other half of that Dimension was called Paradise you remember it's where Samuel was when when Saul went to the witch of Endor and and tried to summon up the spirit of Samuel it was there in that Fifth Dimension where Samuel was waiting but he wasn't waiting in torment they were the Old Testament Saints the righteous God gave him a place to wait until that day on Calvary when he would go down to this Fifth Dimension and take these that were in captivity the Old Testament Saints he would take them captive to himself and take them to a higher Dimension the sixth Dimension where they then would be called Souls under the altar what altar the altar where the Lamb of God is there interceding for you and I remember Revelations 5 verse 5 67 and 8 where John said and I saw a lamb as though it was slain with seven horns and seven eyes there interceding for you and I they're interceding for every son and daughter of God with the grace of God being extended from the Throne of God there there the Lamb of God sits John saw a lamb he didn't see Jesus he knew what Jesus looked like he saw a symbol on the altar of God that represented what Jesus did for us on the cross of Calvary when he said it is finished it is finished and whoever would like to stand up tonight he said and come before me I'll receive you I'll cleanse you I'll baptize you I'll change you I'll make you a new creation in Christ oh tonight's the night for a change for each and everyone I came tonight I came tonight to be changed once again I hope you did too verse S but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive that means he went to Paradise that means he descended to The Fifth Dimension that means there he gave the Old Testament Saints the baptism of the Holy Ghost he that means there it's where he gave the Old Testament Saints the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that he could take them to a higher Dimension that's what was holding them back the holy spirit in their hearts the Born Again experience in their lives a new mind the mind of Christ to go up higher from a lower Dimension to a higher Dimension oh and if you and I are ever going to go from this low Dimension if you and I are ever going to go to a higher dimension it's going to take more of Jesus Remember the little song mentioned and the songwriter said I want more of Jesus more and more and more I want more of Jesus so I'll give him more of me that's all if you leave tonight with that thought and go out that door then his grace will give you more because you have made a you will make a promise that I will give you more Lord because you've given me everything verse eight verse wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men what kind of gifts a Tesla Tesla a Mercedes Mercedes a 3,000 4,000 square foot home what kind of gifts it was none of those the Bible says now that he ascended verse n what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth so he said before before he went and ascended on high he first went down to Hell he first went down to The Fifth Dimension he says because where these people are at where these children of mine are at in this Dimension they're in a state of emergency I got to go where my kids are having the most problems I've got to fix that first and he descended down into hell and he took his children who couldn't get out of that Dimension he went down and took them in his arms and caused them to be born again and gave them the Holy Ghost and took him up to a higher Dimension that's why in The Book of Revelations under the fifth seal he said there was some people crying out and they were crying how Lord Lord how long till you avenge us how long till you avenge us and God said just a little while but your brethren will have to suffer and die just like you the Bible said these were the souls under the altar the altars in the seventh Dimension and they were under that altar in a sixth Dimension but they had been taken up up Jesus himself took responsibility to move them into the next Dimension oh how do you think you and I are going to make it to a Rapture to eternal life because Jesus is taking responsibility for your soul tonight he's going to assure you you're going to make it because on the cross of Calvary I've extended Grace all you got to do is take me by the hand and I'll walk you into eternity just like I did those millions of Old Testament Saints as a prophet would say my that ought to make a Baptist shout and if you've ever been in a Baptist Church you know what he means by that it ain't easy to make them shout the Bible says in verse 11 Ephesians 4:11 these are the gifts that and he gave some Apostles and some prophets some evangelist some pastors and teachers the reason he gave some because some of them he didn't give some are imposters some are unjust stewards some the Bible says are liars it's not easy to say unless the Bible says it and it still isn't easy but but God requires us to say it in Revelations chapter 2 and verse two the first church age the first church age the Apostle Paul being the messenger the angel to that age in verse two of chapter two John writes this he writes what the spirit is saying I Know Thy works and thy labor those who were working and laboring in the days of the Apostle Paul that's who he speaking to specifically but it but it's still for good for us today I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou can not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles why did they say they were Apostles these men because they were let's turn with me to Luke chapter 10 Luke chapter 10 beginning at verse one we'll see here why they said they were Apostles because these are the apostles that were found to be Liars after these things the Lord appointed other 70 also 70 more apostles being ordained by Jesus himself and he sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whether he himself would come verse two therefore said he unto them the Harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth labors into his Harvest he's ordaining 70 more men anointing them as Apostles he said go your ways verse three behold I send you forth as Lambs amongst wolves it was the same message of ordination the same message of ordination that he gave to the first 12 he said in verse four he says carry neither purse nor script nor shoes and salute no man by the way in other words if you're going to be my Apostle you're going to have to be focused and where I send you you have to go then he says in verse five and unto who whatsoever house he enter in first say peace be to this house and if the son of peace be there in other words if it turns out these are believers already where else would the son of peace be in a pagan home no he said when I send you out I'll send you to the homes of Believers you just keep walking remember the testimony of brother Bram when his when the flight he was taken had to have an emergency [Music] landing I believe it was in Memphis Tennessee Memphis Tennessee and they had to get everyone off the plane so he gets off the plane he goes walking around he got himself some postcards writing some letters to people he had to write to and then as he's walking down the street the holy spirit said keep walk and he says Lord is that true and the voice told him keep walking and he keep walking down the street and he realizes he's walking into some very poor neighborhoods and he's realizing the Holy Spirit tells him keep walking now he realizes he's in neighborhoods where all the people are black [Music] people and he's a white [Music] man down in the South it wasn't a comfortable feeling for him but the holy spirit said keep walking you see he was doing the work of an apostle he was focused God told him keep walking he he he didn't dare say unless you tell me where I'm going I'm not going another step no he had learned obedience through the things that he suffered we ought to be learning obedience through the things that we have suffered obedience to him obedience to the leading of the Holy Spirit obedience when we feeling pulling at our hearts and the Holy Spirit tells them keep walking now he's deep into these old neighborhoods now he's gone real far into these neighborhood he doesn't know where he's at and as he's passing by a little house there's a little black lady she's got a handkerchief wrapped around her head there probably hadn't been a white man in that neighborhood for 20 [Music] years and she looks up at him and she says good morning Parson you see what happened God led him to a place where the son of Peace was God the son of Peace God led him to a place where the Prince of Peace was in the heart of this little lady he said how' you know I was a Parson how' you know I was a Parson he says uh he told me you'd be coming she knew he was coming but he didn't know where he was going but he was going where there was a a daughter of God who by faith had reached out to the father and she said father send me Elijah because I got a dying son and I have faith like that shite woman and God said you do have the faith and there's a plane flying over right now and I'm going to stop that plane cause it to land in Memphis because on that plane is the Elijah you're asking for on that plane is a prophet with thus sayith the Lord on that plane is a man fulfilling the role of an apostle and you're going to get what you're asking for by Faith oh tonight hold in your heart by faith your petition holding your heart by faith and God will give you tonight the desire of your hearts the Bible says verse six and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again in other words Jesus was saying when you go to strange cities when you go to strange countries if I send you I will be I I will be sure to prepare a Godly home for you to stay where the Prince of Peace abides the Bible says verse seven in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as you demand of of those people no it do say that no that's what ministers like to do unjust stewards but that's not what Jesus told the fful Ministry Jesus told them these Apostles and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give whatever they give you eat that whatever they give you be happy with that this is another truth concerning tithing and offering and how the minister should receive it not demanding the best all the time but whatever God puts in the people's hearts that receive that's what's yours that's what's yours and nothing else to the ministers I say we got two young ones here in our midst I'm very proud of and I'll be even more proud to see them dig these nuggets out and hold to them uh it's a sign of a true Holy Ghost filled Minister it's a sign of a true of a true Holy Ghost filled Minister that keeps all these little things in their hearts you say but what if I go to preach brother Daniel and I travel hundreds of miles maybe into Mexico mexo and I preach in a little town in Mexico and they pick up an offering for me and it's 100 pesos and the pastor gives it to you crying because your ministry blessed them what do you do you take it and you say Lord reward them a million times more for they gave of the little they had they didn't give from their abundance they have no abundance but they gave from their hearts and Jesus tells the ministry accept it bless them honor them respect the children of God don't you dare ask for more ask for more revelation don't ask for more money to the ministers that's extra that's free not charging anything El verse seven and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the labor is worthy of his hire go not from house to house go not from house to house they're not giving me a lot in this house they are not so I think I'll see if if there's any more Brothers in this city and and see who has more money Jesus said don't you dare do that you better not because if you do that's why there's a lake of fire for that verse 8 and into whatsoever City enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you again he says it because if you don't because if you don't you won't be able to fulfill the second part you won't be you won't be a partaker of verse n but if you do as Jesus said in verse n God will give you the healing for the sick he said and heal the sick and that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you but into whatsoever city you enter and they receive you not go your way out of the streets and say streets of the same and say even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we wipe off against you not withstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of God has come nigh unto you verse 12 Jesus told them remember these are the instructions to the ministry to 70 more men that Jesus was ordaining as Apostles for the rest of their lives these 70 men would be privileged to say you know who ordained me in the ministry well have you ever heard of Jesus of Nazareth he said but I say unto you that it'll be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that City Jesus sent out the 70 but you know where the 70 wound up in Revelations 2 and 2 where the Holy Spirit speaking through John this Apostle and Prophet where the Holy Spirit speaking through John his Apostle and prophet and he says This I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou can not bear them which are evil he's talking to the church that was in the days of the Apostle Paul he's talking to the church for those first years of the Ephesian Church age he says and and thou has tried them which say they apostles you have tried those that said wait a minute I'm one of those 70 that Jesus ordained I am an apostle Jesus of Nazareth ordained me William Bram ordained me William I knew several men most have passed on now that were ordained by William brand well these 70 were ordained by Jesus of Nazareth the same one that ordained the first 12 but if we keep reading our Bibles when Jesus began to preach the revealed word out of the Lamb's Book of Life when Jesus opened up the Seven Seals when Jesus opened up this new testament book he said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me those 70 Apostles they said that's too much for for us why can't you just stay an evangelist praying for the sick why can't we just keep having a healing campaign for the people's bodies because he wanted to give us healing for our souls and the healing for the body as a prophet told us was just the bait on the hook in in the hook to get your attention to to to to give you words of eternal life that will cause you to be born again that'll cause you to be changing daily and receive the very mind of Christ receive the very character of Jesus Christ of Jesus Christ and John here in if in Revelations 2 and 2 the Ephesian Church age he said I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou can not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say we are Apostles Jesus ordained us and we are Apostles because Jesus ordained us and the Bible says and are not and has found them Liars you don't have to worry about taking away their title if they say they're Apostle let them be an apostle if they say I'm a prophet let them be a prophet they say I'm an evangelist a pastor or teacher don't try and take away their titles no find out what they're preaching and saying are they preaching Christ or are they lying Apostles are they lying pastors are they lying evangelists are they the ones that if you give them if they if you give them a $10 offering are they the ones that say why why can't you give me 50 don't you know I Don't Preach for less than $1,000 now you know what kind of apostle he is now you know what kind of Pastor he is now you know what kind of teacher He Is We need Jesus we need to be born again we need to be led can the church test the ministry yes how by the word as we stand to our feet T these lying Apostles remember Paul said and he gave some apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors he gave some because most of them he didn't give they can keep the title but they are not Christ fold Ministry Christ
