is by his stripes we are healed sickness comes but he sends healing sadness can come but he'll send Joy anxiety can come but he'll send peace and all these things we are subject to we we we go out on a hot summer day we we go out on a hot summer day and and we get hot we go out on a cold winter day and we get cold so we are subject to everything that every other person on the planet Earth is subject to every human being passes through these things but as a believer in Christ we have a hope if we weren't Believers I would have no hope that I'd ever see my son or my mom and dad again death would have become a very final thing but but but because of the hope we have in Christ because we can be serve him by faith because we believe everything he said is true and he told us that one day the Trump of God shall [Music] sound the dead in Christ shall rise and we which were alive and remain believing for this event to come to pass then it will come to pass and we will be part of that event we're already part of the the event the preparation part I I heard um there was a young boy asking his dad and he he heard in church about the coming of the Lord and he asked his dad he says Dad the coming of the Lord when is it going to happen uh what day is that is it tomorrow he says well son he said I don't know what day it is is because you see I'm not on the planning committee for that I'm not in the group of men that are planning I'm not on the planning committee no he says I am just on the welcoming committee so so so so my job to be ready heart soul mind and body to well to welcome him and you can welcome him now because he's come to our hearts and to our [Music] lives so we're not on the planning committee but but we are on the welcoming committee and that's what we want to do tonight as we stand to our feet we want to make him we don't want to leave him Jesus with dirty feet no we we want to we want to wash his feet with our tears and and wipe them clean with our with our hair just like that little woman who who snuck into into that dinner that they were having a Pharisee she had to break all the rules to do it all the church rules but she she took the risk because she was getting going to get close to Jesus and she had something in her heart of which she needed and wanted an answer yeah can let's turn with me in your Bibles first Thessalonians chapter 4 and as you're turning there we just like to remind you that uh this coming Saturday this Saturday uh Saturday at 6:00 p.m. uh we'll be having a service and Sunday also same morning same time on Sunday our brother uh our brother Raul Gonzalez will be here with us uh his s uh the sister's wife sister Maria I believe their daughter and her two boys are coming sister Arana coming with with him also so you'll get to meet our brother's daughter also we're in expectation for it I was thinking of calling him today and just that I was going to call him my phone rings and it's uh and and on the read out on the screen it says Raul Gonzalez I said oh look at that we're thinking the same but then when I greeted him I I I realized no one was talking so they must have bumped the phone number in their pocket I said no problem I'll just call him back so I just hit redial on that phone there and brother Raul Gonzalez answers but it turned out to be brother Leo's brother-in-law so we got to talk in a little bit we had a nice time of Fellowship so we may have a double portion this weekend because we invited him to come also so there may be two rul Gonzalez's this weekend I I think that's a good thing somehow God's wanting to say something to us and as soon as I get the answer you'll be the first to know first Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 1-7 we've read it uh when we preached the other two services so verse one furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God so ye could abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concupiscence even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified for God ha not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness but God hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness as we had mentioned before in this teaching of marriage and divorce there is a natural and a spiritual how God wants us to live in the natural the best plan for our lives and and also in the spiritual and one is a type and Shadow of the other but but they they they they the they they they don't they are not the same because because Jesus said that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born in the spirit is spirit so so there is a difference between the natural marriage between a man and a woman and the supernatural between God and his bride so so so they're they're they're not the same not even close to being the same there is a small shadow that one Shadows the other but one is natural and one is Supernatural and there's a great difference but but go but but but God wants you to learn to be faithful in both in both commitments in both marriages both natural and Supernatural let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you and ask Lord that you're the revealer of the word that you would once more go from Heart to Heart from youngest to oldest and bless us once again in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated there are three Witnesses in in this great truth and if you don't bring all three Witnesses together you'll you'll never have the complete truth first Moses gives us an account of what he saw by vision of what God did and said in Genesis then Jesus Christ himself and Jesus Christ himself El uh and he spoke in his Earthly Ministry of what this truth was so he added more details to this then in the form of the Holy Spirit he gives Paul a prophet and Apostle another portion then once again in the form of the Holy Spirit he shows William brandham how to bring all these loose ends together brother Bram was not one of the three [Music] Witnesses it was Jesus it was Moses it was Apostle Paul what what what the prophet in this last day did is what he told us that was the what was the ministry of the the seventh angel and it was to bring all the loose ends together so we could so we could see that the Bible is hidden in the mouths and and testimonies of of of God's prophets because Moses was a prophet Jesus was a prophet Paul was a prophet the prophetic word so to bring all these loose ends together it would take a prophet again to tie them all together for us then when a prophet brings it all the prophetic word together then God Can Open the Eyes of our understanding and we're not looking just for a definition in a dictionary but we're looking for patterns and examples in the Bible three Witnesses we read in Matthew 19 and 19 and or Matthew 19 is where Jesus was speaking and the Pharisees tried to Corner him on this subject on on on this teaching of marriage and divorce because they thought they had the answer from Jehovah through the mouth of Moses a Great and Mighty prophet they didn't realize they didn't have the answer they didn't realize that what they had they what what they had was not thus sayith the Lord no what what they had was something that Moses because of the hardness of their hearts you remember there in Matthew 19 Jesus was teaching he finished up these teachings and there were great multitudes that followed them there was a great healing campaign and despite all the healings the supernatural Miracles that the Pharisees saw all the great Miracles the Pharisees saw them also they were in that multitude but they were looking for an opportunity to find fault in him that the people would abandon him their hearts were so hardened it they it didn't matter to them that their moms their dads their cousins their grandchilden were being healed supernaturally it didn't matter so the law that they had was given to them to Israel as a nation because of the hardness of their heart and and the teachings of marriage and divorce laying within the within the law was also part of that given to them for the same reason because of the hardness of their hearts go through the through the prophet Moses god allowed Moses to tell the people to give them Ten Commandments Thou shalt not kill do you know why he gave them that because of the hardness of their hearts they were intent every time they became angry to kill somebody it might even be their own son it could be one of their wives because of the hardness of their hearts God gave them that commandment Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not commit adultery it was given to them because of the hardness of their hearts Thou shalt not covet Thy Neighbor House no uh I shall not cover he said you know why he gave him that because of the hardness of their heart The Ten Commandments from Thou shalt not kill to the Commandments on marriage and divorce were all given to Israel for this one key principle the hardness of the hearts of mankind and Jesus told them it wasn't so in the beginning in the beginning when it was just Adam and Eve they didn't need a commandment Thou shalt not kill they they didn't they they couldn't even spell the word much l do [Music] act so here we are in Matthew 19 Jesus is speaking with the Pharisees they're trying to find fault with him they they they think they know something but but what blinded them to make them think they knew something was the hardness of their hearts Amen in verse n Jesus said and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall Mar another committeth adultery and whosoever Marth her which is put away do commit adultery so this is where where God once again remember how he was speaking in a parable even this was in Parable for he mixed the word wife with the word fornication and it brought all this confusion that we have yet today because fornication we we understand is is something that is a is an immoral act between two single people whereas adultery is the same act but when it you that but it's you're in adultery when you are married and are Unfaithful so but here Jesus uses the word wife and he mixes it with the word fornication and then he says this is the only reason for which a man could leave his wife divorce her and marry another now he could divorce her two people can separate even two people who call call themselves Christians but for the man except it be for this one reason he might leave his [Music] wife but he claims to be a believer in Christ a Christian the Bible says you cannot remarry because because though you get divorced by the law before God you're still a married man you have a wife and your wife is still a married woman she has a husband and as long as her husband lives she's bound to the law of her [Music] husband but it's no longer that a man can divorce for any [Music] reason and remarry just one and and and when Jesus is bringing this mystery he mixes the word wife with the word fornication and everybody's saying well what does that mean in Matthew 5 and verse 32 remember Matthew 5 it was Jesus speaking on Perfection telling us where we start in our Christian walk and he said blessed are the poor in spirit we we all start in the same place broken Sinners and needing Christ to lift us up and then the promise and the goal from that first step is is to arrive and be be just like the father remember what Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as my Father which is in heaven is perfect so we begin sinners in a fallen condition and the goal that God promises to take us to is perfection is a perfection and the world says we can't be perfect it's not possible but to to the believer everything that Jesus said is possible but it was a parable also and Perfection doesn't mean what we think it means Perfection the goal as our father is perfect is to be as Eternal as he is eternal potentially we are Eternal already but there's a preparation that's what we need to do we need to get into this preparation we need to become part of this welcoming committee that's what God is calling us to so here in in Matthew 5 532 Jesus was speaking in verse 27 he tells us this and even in this Parable as he's speaking he's making things known to us ye have heard that that it was said by them of old time verse 27 ye have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery in English in English it it says ye have heard that it was said by them of old time you notice Jesus didn't say thus saith the Lord no no no he gives credit where credit was due he said them of old time said this I allowed them to say that because of the hardness of their hearts but now that I've come they said don't commit adultery but a New Covenant is coming God came down in flesh died on the cross and paid the price so that we could be born again to take away what to Deliver Us from the hardness of our hearts the thing that's plagued the human race since Genesis it was a plague Cain killed his brother why because of the hardness of his heart and God allowed Moses to give them a commandment Thou shalt not kill because of the hardness of your heart thou shal not commit adultery because of the hardness of your heart Thou shalt not cover thy neighbor's house because of the hardness of your heart th thou shall have no other God because of the hardness of your heart so you see what was taking place here the law was given to man because of the hardness of his heart Jesus told him it's written thou shall not commit adultery because of the hardness of your hearts that takes you to adultery that takes you to be covetous the hardness of the hearts takes you to fornication hardness of their hearts takes you to adultery the hardness of your heart takes you to other gods but I say unto you verse 28 so verse 28 is now becoming thus saith the Lord Jesus is speaking Jehovah is speaking but I say unto you thus saith the Lord that whosoever lookth on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in the hardness of his heart H how did he commit this through the eye gate Jesus Jesus knew he discerned the hearts and when he discerned the hearts all them men around there saying he says what what what do you want us to do we can see these people we have eyes to see don't we Jesus discerns their thought their thoughts and he looks to the congregation looks to the crowd and he says If thy right eye offend thee conviction strikes him whoa he knows what we're thinking he said if I right eye offend thee he said pluck It Out cast it from thee for it is profitable verse 29 for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell so Jesus tells us whosoever lookth on a Woman verse 28 then he catches their thoughts in the in amongst the amongst the multitude and they're thinking how how can we do that if we've got eyes to see don't we so he discerns what they're thinking in their hearts and he addresses that issue and he says If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out he says it's more profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell and his ministry was how in Parables he was speaking again in parables then he says If thy right I If thy right hand offend thee cut it off in other words he's telling don't look after them lustfully don't put your hands on a woman that's not your wife and the men are thinking yeah how do we do that Jesus catches through discernment once again and he says If thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it's profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell and men don't want to preach on it because they take it literal and they and they they they don't know how to how to relate to this they don't realize it's a parable there's a supernatural there's a mystery laying in it and If thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it's profitable profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell then he said because this is rolling around in the heads of the people he said it hath been said not not God told us in the old Testament not thus sayith the Lord no Jesus didn't say that do you think if if God would have said it Jesus would know because Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old he knows just what he said this is something he allowed Moses to to give the people because of the hardness of their hearts not just for a divorce but all Ten Commandments have been given to Israel because of the hardness of their hearts thou shallal not kill because of the hardness of your hearts and Jesus said in verse 31 it has been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement But A Change Is Coming the New Testament was a testament and a covenant of change how many changes five of them change change change change change everything was going to change the church worship was going to change the way we approached God was going to be changed the way we the the way we live at live at peace with our husbands and wives was going to change because under the old Old Testament all the Commandments had been given because of the hardness of the hearts of the human race but but the New Testament the promises that were given now and the requirements upon your life was because now you and I could be born again and Purge the hardness of our hearts and never be the same again and Jesus said but I say unto you uh verse 32 so Jesus speaking in Matthew 5 here in verse 27-32 is now Jesus making a distinction between the laws the the and the doctrines and rituals of men doctrines and teachings of men and what is now thus sayith the Lord do you see what we received in this last day the son of man coming to tell us you it has been said by old time Pentecostals if you speak in tongues you've got the Holy Ghost but now thus saith the Lord the baptism of the holy spirit is not an emotion it's the very life of God in and when you receive it you'll never be the same again Hallelujah you see how it repeats the pattern from you have heard what is said by them old time Pentecostals but God in this age came through the mouth of the seven angel with thus sayth the Lord but now I say unto you all that I allowed it because of the hardness of their hearts but I'm going to pull you out of denominationalism and bring you into the bride of Christ where you have thus sayith the Lord and by a born again experience now I'm going to purge you of the hardness of our hearts of my heart of your heart that's why we must be born again some of us were too long in a Catholic Church some of us were too long in an Apostolic Church some of us were too long in a Pentecostal Church some of us were way too long in a so-called message church and now God comes to pull us out of the hardness of our hearts so we won't say but that's the way they taught me but Jesus now is saying but I say unto you there's a better way but I say unto you verse 32 that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery so once again Jesus puts together the the word wife with a word fornication and the world is confused Jesus said father I thank you that you've hidden these things the eyes of the wise and prudent but you're revealing it unto babes such as would learn it takes a born again experience to put off the hardness of our hearts and the hardness of our hearts won't go away easy we've got to pray through we got to push it away we got to understand there's a hardness there and be born again and and have a baptism with fire take place then we're ready then we have have an ear to hear what Jesus is saying in this day now we're recognizing our day now we're recognizing our message our message isn't William brandham William brandham William brandom William Bram William Bram William brandham no it's what William brandham told us it was William br it's all about Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Savior Lamb of God our bridegroom the lover of our soul the changer of Our Lives he through he through a born again experience who has taking away the hardness from our hearts the message we read it last time I like to read it again marriage and divorce paragraph 57 Jesus brother brandham says this this scripture this question confronted Jesus at the very beginning of his ministry and it confronted Moses at the very beginning of his ministry it's it's it's a question in believer's Hearts The Sinner doesn't care but Believers because the believer is trying to do all that he knows to do to live right before God he says therefore if any question comes up on religion then the marriage and divorce case comes up then he asked why he said because it's the cause of the original sin so what's brother brandham telling us that the answer in a real live example of how a wife can commit fornication is laying in Genesis the answer why Jesus used the word [Music] wife with the word fornication the answer is laying in Genesis because it is the cause of the original sin paragraph 84 of marriage and divorce brother Bram says Jesus in our text he was referring to Matthew 19 and and Matthew 5 invites us to go back to the beginning for the true scriptural answer let me read that again Jesus in our text he had read Matthew 19 he says invites us to go back to the beginning for the true scriptural answer what was the question what was the answer brother brandom tells us it's laying in Genesis he said Jesus invited us to go back there to find the answer to this question he said now when he was confronted with this there was two things in view the priest the priest said to him can a man put away his wife and marry another for any cause m and Jesus said he he put it as a question to Jesus even though they felt they knew the answer already because Moses that's the Commandment that Moses had given them they liked it but they didn't know why he had given it to them because it eased for a moment because it it eased for a moment the hardness of their hearts under the Old Testament a a Jewish man he could be married for 24 hours and he could say I'm not living with this woman for one more hour what do I do remember Moses said you could you could divorce her for any reason oh great the hardness of his heart all of a sudden he felt relief it was given to bring down the the the action of the heart Ness of their hearts to help them so they could keep the other commandment Thou shalt not kill [Music] her see you see what Ten Commandments were for you think it's great now when you understand the reason why they were given because of the hardness of the hearts of the human race especially the man the book is open the lamb is revealing it details we never saw before today the world is still so happy for the Ten Commandments they they put them on the walls of Judges rooms and and cour houses they they they want it they want to have it in the halls of Congress and Senate they say oh look at these Ten Commandments that God gave us and when Jesus came he said I never gave you that I allowed Moses to give you that and there was a reason why because when they're hanging on the wall of your house or in your office or in the president's office it's to remind us of one great truth God had to give us that because of the hardness of our hearts that's what Ten Commandments should remind you of how hard and wicked the human heart can be but Jesus said If thy eye offend thee pluck it out if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and no one wants to preach on it they can't explain it it sounds too radical and yet it was the mercy of God calling us through a born again experience for a total separation from all unbelief that we could be purged of the hardness of our hearts when does it begin the hardness of a person's heart believe it or not about the time you change the first diaper in that little cute little baby because until that child is born again there's a hardness building up oh we're different personalities different levels of how we react but unless until you've been born again there is a hardness that's growing and the government by taking our boys into the Army and the navyy and the Marines and the Air Force and all the Special Forces you know what they're doing to men and women training them to be harder and harder and harder taking them farther and farther from the promise of God today and then they tell them you're Patriots you're Heroes but you know what you also become murderers and killers and adulterers and fornicators because all Ten Commandments were given because of the hardness of our hearts but Jesus came and told Nicodemus Nicodemus you must be born again you must be born again in Malachi chapter 2 and verse 14 we'll be closing here Malachi with thus sayith the Lord speaks to Israel he speaking mainly to the priesthood and to the head of every home and Malachi 2 and verse4 he says this to the men of Israel he said yet ye say wherefore because the Lord ha been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou has dealt treacherously verse 14 Malachi 2 and verse 14 through the mouth of Malachi change was beginning change was coming and God rebukes Israel for the hardness of their hearts he says yet she is thy companion and the wife of of thy Covenant and then verse 15 he says and did not he make one now now Malachi has taking them back to Genesis in the beginning God said let us make man in our image and he made them and he and he and he made Man In His Image male and female made he them and he called them Adam he said and did not he make one one what in the beginning one Adam yet in this Adam yet had he the resid do of the spirit speaking of the feminist spirit that was already in Adam that was part of him they were not Twain They were one in the beginning he saids yet had he the residue of the spirit and wherefore one this is why did he make them one in the beginning that he might seek a Godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit because your spirit is hard he's telling [Music] Israel and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth what's God telling them I hate the putting away I hate divorce verse 16 for the Lord for the Lord the god of Israel saith that he hateth putting away this was the sayith the Lord now he's bringing the change that's been promised a new testament a New Covenant to make you a new people to make you and your wife the wife of thy youth one again like it was in the beginning for the Lord the God of Israel saith that he hateth putting away for one coverthe of hearts for one coverthe the Lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal not treacherously Malachi told them take heed to your spirit because your spirit is full of hardness and if you lean to the hardness you will deal treacherously you'll be you'll deal treacherously with your wife of your youth you'll deal treacherously with your children you'll build treacherously at your jobs all because of the same reason

the first coming of Christ and in closing tonight and putting a comma thus saith the Lord again has has come at the second coming of Christ to help us put away the hardness of our hearts we're living in the day of a personal experience and it's the only thing that can take you and I to be quickened changed and translated by the power the holy spirit so we stand to our feet we continue Ten Commandments they're not as wonderful as they might seem because they were only given because of the hardness of our hearts we thought that when we tell our children Thou shalt not kill that we were sharing a great Revelation but we weren't we were just repeating what other men had said said and and until we came to this word and got a revelation we were repeating a lot of things that men said but but God now has brought us thus sayith the Lord so when you tell someone thou shallal not kill what you're really saying is the hardness of your heart was this commandment given by Moses indeed all Ten Commandments were given because of the hardness of men's Hearts the practice of marriage and divorce as it still is amongst the Jewish people was given to them because of the hardness of their hearts Malachi made it known and he told them he said the Lord have been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth your first wife your only wife your true wife and then he told them against whom you priest you heads of your home you have you have dealt treacherously with her yet he says yet she is thy companion the wife of your youth your first wife she is thy companion and the wife of th covenant not the second not the third not the fourth or the fifth and then Malachi told them thus sayith the Lord God hates the putting away of their wives and we're just scratching the of this
