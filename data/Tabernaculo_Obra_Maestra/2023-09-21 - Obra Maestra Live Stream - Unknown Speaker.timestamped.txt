[40:32] our brother Kenny has a special song
[40:33] this evening I'm coming
[40:58] [Music]
[41:09] I bless you tonight I want to read a
[41:12] scripture before we sing this song
[41:17] I don't know why but every time I sing a
[41:20] song Lord is always
[41:24] maybe not every time but I've always
[41:26] felt to read a scripture before I sing a
[41:28] song because
[41:30] I just feel that my life is
[41:38] tied to the word
[41:41] I feel like my heart is part of the word
[41:45] and uh
[41:51] it's a little bit nervous
[41:54] but I want to read this scripture
[41:56] because
[41:57] I feel that this scripture
[42:03] by God's grace he's allowed me to
[42:07] keep my mind on him
[42:11] and I remember years before I got
[42:13] converted
[42:15] my mind wasn't on the things of God
[42:18] and um
[42:21] but ever since the Lord changed my heart
[42:26] you know I may not
[42:29] there's there's times where I've you
[42:33] know I haven't been
[42:35] what I should be but my mind has always
[42:38] been on him
[42:40] I've always felt that my heart is
[42:43] only because of him because he put his
[42:46] mind in me That's why nothing of myself
[42:48] but I just want to read this scripture
[42:52] it's Isaiah 26 3.
[42:55] and it says
[42:57] thou will keep him
[42:59] imperfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[43:02] thee because he trusteth in the
[43:07] so I truly believe that
[43:09] that when we keep our minds
[43:12] on him
[43:14] we we if we keep our minds stayed on him
[43:17] he'll give us that perfect peace
[43:24] and I believe in a world that we're
[43:26] living in today we need a peace and it's
[43:29] not the peace that the world offers but
[43:32] it's the peace that the Lord Jesus gives
[43:34] us
[43:38] thank you
[43:41] Restless Hearts trouble Minds I try hard
[43:49] to find
[43:52] answers to why it's turned out this way
[44:00] but while my heart gripped with fear I
[44:06] can feel him draw near
[44:09] [Music]
[44:11] gently I hear
[44:14] my Lord says
[44:17] [Music]
[44:21] keep your mind
[44:25] stayed on me
[44:28] [Music]
[44:33] Faithfully
[44:37] and I will give you
[44:44] perfect peace
[44:47] sweet release
[44:50] if you'll just keep your mind staying on
[44:56] me
[44:59] it's evening time
[45:01] the hours late
[45:04] there's a pressure so great
[45:10] everywhere Hearts failed because of
[45:16] but when I think of lovely things
[45:21] for the peace his word
[45:26] is still Small Voice
[45:30] I can't hear
[45:32] [Music]
[45:36] your mind
[45:39] [Music]
[45:39] [Laughter]
[45:42] [Music]
[45:51] and I will give you
[45:57] perfect peace thank you sweetie

[46:54] completely to you Lord

[48:06] [Music]
[48:15] God bless you all
[48:18] it's good to be here with you all amen
[48:21] the song that I'm about to see
[48:23] the work truck today
[48:25] and was listening to it and touched my
[48:28] heart
[48:30] you know you know that portion of
[48:32] scripture in John work Mary Magdalene as
[48:35] she sees Jesus and he tells her don't
[48:38] touch me because I haven't ascended but
[48:40] he says go tell my disciples I will I am
[48:43] going to ascend to the father
[48:46] and when she when he when they are all
[48:49] gathered together
[48:51] he came he came down with them
[48:53] and they saw the scars that are on his
[48:56] his uh hands and his side amen
[49:01] but when they told Thomas because he
[49:02] wasn't there he didn't he didn't believe
[49:04] them
[49:05] and he said unless I can touch his hands
[49:07] and decide
[49:09] but see God came down to Thomas because
[49:12] he wanted Thomas to have faith
[49:15] he wasn't mean to him because you didn't
[49:17] believe this is what you got no he said
[49:19] even for you Thomas I'll come down and
[49:22] I'll let you do this but I say that to
[49:24] say this is that the only scars in
[49:27] heaven I heard this song it's called the
[49:29] only scars in heaven
[49:30] and uh it says it won't belong to me or
[49:33] new
[49:36] when we go there we won't have any scars
[49:39] anymore
[49:40] amen
[49:42] [Music]
[49:48] if I had only known the last time would
[49:52] be the last time
[49:56] I would have put off all the things I
[49:59] had to do
[50:03] I would have I would have stayed a
[50:06] little longer
[50:08] held on a little tighter now what I give
[50:14] for one more day with you
[50:19] cause there's a wound here in my heart
[50:23] where something's missing
[50:26] [Music]
[50:29] it's gonna heal with time
[50:35] but I know you're in a place where all
[50:39] your wounds have been erased

[58:55] hanging
[58:56] is known
[58:59] [Music]
[59:26] [Applause]
[59:43] [Music]
[59:48] imagine
[59:51] Jesus Christ
[59:58] [Music]
[1:00:07] and me
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:16] has risen
[1:00:19] from the dead
[1:00:34] [Music]
[1:00:51] [Music]
[1:00:59] God bless you all this evening
[1:01:03] back once again
[1:01:08] and uh we just
[1:01:14] okay
[1:01:16] we're just kind of in an expectation
[1:01:18] also the trip we'll be taking
[1:01:20] the expected
[1:01:23] I think I'm starting to count to days
[1:01:25] now
[1:01:27] so next week will be the last week and
[1:01:30] then we leave the following Monday
[1:01:34] so keep us in your prayers
[1:01:37] and we really believe God opened the
[1:01:40] door so we could be a blessing to the
[1:01:42] folks there in Congo and
[1:01:48] um so you just remember us in that trip
[1:01:53] I know I'm going to have a good time
[1:01:56] but we've traveled before
[1:02:01] so I also know that 30 hours of travel
[1:02:04] one way is going to be kind of tough
[1:02:10] it's 30 to 33 hours
[1:02:13] from the time that we leave here
[1:02:17] to the time that we arrive in Congo
[1:02:20] Congo so
[1:02:23] we anticipated it and we get there I
[1:02:26] think the day before the services
[1:02:31] so it'll give us a little chance to rest
[1:02:34] up a bit
[1:02:37] but not much because the brothers
[1:02:40] already said that they'll be meeting us
[1:02:42] at the airport
[1:02:44] this is a folks want to meet you
[1:02:49] it might be difficult to get any rest
[1:02:51] even the day before
[1:02:54] but we're grateful to God
[1:02:57] that he has he has a bride
[1:03:00] there's a mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:03:04] and she's worldwide yes and God's
[1:03:08] allowed us to go meet them in different
[1:03:10] places
[1:03:13] meet the Saints in South Africa
[1:03:16] I mean the Saints in Brazil
[1:03:19] Brazil meet the Saints in Venezuela
[1:03:23] meet the Saints from Argentina
[1:03:26] and many Believers around the world
[1:03:30] there of course in Congo
[1:03:33] the churches are some of the largest
[1:03:37] there with her brother
[1:03:40] the church will be dedicating
[1:03:44] it is now maybe about 5 000 people
[1:03:49] we prior to Landing in Brazil
[1:03:53] we land in the country of the Democratic
[1:03:57] Republic of Congo
[1:04:00] there's two Congos
[1:04:03] and we land in uh
[1:04:08] and and there there's a a few churches
[1:04:11] also
[1:04:14] a brother by the name of Brother Richard
[1:04:16] dioke
[1:04:19] he has a congregation about 16 000
[1:04:22] Believers
[1:04:25] and yet these are some of the poorest
[1:04:27] countries in the world
[1:04:31] Congo has been uh the two nations of
[1:04:34] Congo
[1:04:35] have been in Civil War for years and
[1:04:38] years and years
[1:04:41] so so the people live uh under a great
[1:04:45] stress the
[1:04:49] they're not worried about what
[1:04:50] restaurant they'll go to on Sunday
[1:04:53] restaurants
[1:04:54] they're just concerned whether they'll
[1:04:57] have something to eat on Sunday
[1:05:01] and and yet that may be the very thing
[1:05:05] that creates their dependence on the
[1:05:07] word of God
[1:05:10] it doesn't have to be that way
[1:05:13] but yet as human beings we realize
[1:05:17] sometimes it takes a little squeeze
[1:05:23] something that for us is difficult and
[1:05:26] very hard
[1:05:29] to bring us to a place
[1:05:32] where we can say Lord
[1:05:34] I surrender all but that's what the
[1:05:38] Christian life is about
[1:05:40] to finally answer the call of God
[1:05:44] say Lord I Surrender yes I remember
[1:05:48] myself as a young
[1:06:17] and that's been many years ago now yes
[1:06:21] I never have one regret
[1:06:27] I was never sorry I did it
[1:06:33] I just wish I would have done it sooner
[1:06:37] but that was kind of the hard-headed
[1:06:39] kind
[1:06:41] but by the grace of God
[1:06:44] his Mercy
[1:06:46] never quit reaching down to us
[1:06:50] if you'll turn in your Bibles
[1:06:54] and we've been reading from The Book of
[1:06:56] Revelations
[1:06:59] last week we took from Genesis one
[1:07:03] and and merged it and typed it with uh
[1:07:06] Saint John the first chapter
[1:07:10] and then we also read from Revelations
[1:07:13] uh
[1:07:19] the way that scriptures come together
[1:07:24] showing how the New Testament what
[1:07:27] happened there in in the Old Testament
[1:07:29] what happened there in Genesis
[1:07:33] was a pattern and it was a reflection of
[1:07:38] even of this Plan of Redemption of This
[1:07:41] Book of Revelations
[1:07:43] Genesis was a pattern of this to come
[1:07:47] and and Revelations was also the plan
[1:07:50] the divine plan of God
[1:07:53] to restore back God Sons and Daughters
[1:07:58] in the very same relationship
[1:08:01] that Adam and Eve had with the father
[1:08:05] before they made that crucial mistake in
[1:08:07] their lives
[1:08:10] and get put out of the presence of God
[1:08:14] foreign
[1:08:19] [Music]
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:11] and and that's what he's wanting to
[1:09:14] restore us back to yeah
[1:09:16] he's wanting to restore his back to have
[1:09:18] a relationship with the father
[1:09:21] where the father can instruct us
[1:09:24] and he's doing with us what he want to
[1:09:27] do with Adam
[1:09:29] he's teaching us how to handle and how
[1:09:34] to understand the spoken word the
[1:09:37] original series he's teaching us how to
[1:09:40] let our fingers do the walk into the
[1:09:42] Bible Pages
[1:09:44] so that all the symbols that lay in the
[1:09:47] Bible
[1:09:48] it'll come alive to us and we'll see how
[1:09:51] God chose
[1:09:53] to hide this book this Bible from the
[1:09:58] eyes of the wise
[1:10:05] they're not babes as in in small literal
[1:10:09] human children
[1:10:12] um
[1:10:14] adults
[1:10:16] that would be born again
[1:10:19] spiritual babes men and women Born Again
[1:10:24] baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:10:27] because that is the beginning of our
[1:10:30] Christian world
[1:10:32] is a baptism in water
[1:10:35] it can that is an outward expression
[1:10:39] of an inward work of a baptism of fire
[1:10:44] that God is doing in our hearts that
[1:10:47] cleanses us from the old appetite of the
[1:10:50] things of the world
[1:10:52] and we say I won't partake of this world
[1:10:55] no more
[1:10:57] I don't grow up Desiring it every
[1:11:00] morning anymore
[1:11:02] no the flesh is tempted
[1:11:05] but the inner man who's been born again
[1:11:08] he mortifies the Deeds of the Flesh
[1:11:12] and begins to do the will of
[1:11:15] Revelations chapter one
[1:11:18] and verse one
[1:11:20] this is what the whole Bible is about
[1:11:24] and it consummates and it comes to a
[1:11:27] point here in this first chapter of
[1:11:28] Revelations
[1:11:31] and it says the revelation of Jesus
[1:11:34] Christ
[1:11:36] that's what's needed
[1:11:38] God has had many apostles
[1:11:41] because that had many prophets God has
[1:11:45] had many true evangelists
[1:11:47] at least faithful pastors
[1:11:50] God has had some teachers in the mix of
[1:11:52] it God has a faithful Ministry
[1:11:56] but what the faithful Ministry has come
[1:11:59] to teach us
[1:12:01] and those that are are born again
[1:12:06] those ministers who have the baptism of
[1:12:09] the Holy Ghost ministers you'll know
[1:12:12] them because they will want to instruct
[1:12:14] you
[1:12:15] and bring you to the feet of the Cross
[1:12:18] well you too can have a river
[1:12:35] but none of them gave their life on the
[1:12:37] cross of California
[1:12:39] but they all pointed us to him the Lamb
[1:12:44] of God Jesus Christ
[1:12:47] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:12:50] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:12:52] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:12:54] and he sent and Sanctified it by his
[1:12:57] Angel unto his servant John Christ in
[1:13:49] you descended from the throne and you
[1:13:52] change forms many times
[1:13:54] and you change Ministries to get to this
[1:13:58] place tonight
[1:14:00] where you could have an encounter with
[1:14:02] us
[1:14:03] whereas the word is preached
[1:14:15] amen amen you may be seated
[1:14:20] we're just attempting here and maybe the
[1:14:22] next
[1:14:24] services
[1:14:25] to continue in This Book of Revelations
[1:14:31] and we will first kind of just go and
[1:14:34] and speak a general outline of it all
[1:14:39] um
[1:14:42] and and then later on back up again
[1:14:47] and and take each text more in great
[1:14:51] details
[1:14:52] the Lord willing so here in Revelations
[1:14:57] God is making himself known
[1:15:00] through his Apostle and profit
[1:15:03] also called John the Divine
[1:15:06] John was one of the 12 apostles
[1:15:10] John pastored the church in Ephesus
[1:15:14] but here as this Revelation is coming to
[1:15:17] him
[1:15:18] John was actually taken and put in
[1:15:21] prison
[1:15:24] in a remote island
[1:15:29] it was the Roman emperor that time
[1:15:33] they wanted to smash the influence of
[1:15:36] Jesus Christ
[1:15:39] they felt that this movement of this
[1:15:41] Nazarene was growing too big
[1:15:45] they found out that John is
[1:15:49] trying to compile
[1:15:51] all the writings
[1:15:54] of the New Testament author scribes
[1:15:58] Matthew Mark Luke and John Marcus wrote
[1:16:01] the Gospel and then all the Epistles
[1:16:05] pistols
[1:16:08] and of James and he was compiled them
[1:16:13] all together
[1:16:15] he had them all in his possessions
[1:16:18] but they had been written in in in the
[1:16:21] in the language of the Hebrews
[1:16:24] and John was trying to put it and
[1:16:27] translate it all into the Greek language
[1:16:31] because the Greek language
[1:16:33] was a universal language
[1:16:36] of that day no matter what language you
[1:16:40] spoke
[1:16:41] if you could speak Greeks you could
[1:16:44] always find someone somewhere
[1:16:47] because when the Greeks ruled the world
[1:16:51] they enforce the teaching of their
[1:16:54] language
[1:16:56] so the Greek was a universal language to
[1:16:59] everyone
[1:17:01] and that's why the original New
[1:17:03] Testament
[1:17:06] was originally placed in the Greek
[1:17:08] because John wanted to make it
[1:17:11] accessible
[1:17:12] to everyone but he was caught before
[1:17:44] but God needed to put him in a place
[1:17:47] because this was so sacred and so
[1:17:50] sovereign
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:52] I'm going to reveal to you this great
[1:18:55] Plan of Redemption
[1:18:57] it's a plan of Seven Seals which really
[1:19:01] is a plan of seven parts
[1:19:04] that was going to unfold on the days of
[1:19:08] Jesus to this day
[1:19:11] we are in the seventh part we are in the
[1:19:15] seventh seals
[1:19:17] much of it is all history already
[1:19:20] but the fifth seal the sixth seals
[1:19:24] they are running in parallel
[1:19:27] there is no overlap in these seals
[1:19:31] there's no overlap in these parts
[1:19:34] because in the last days God would make
[1:19:38] a quick short work
[1:19:40] so all three of these last seals are
[1:19:43] traveling in parallel unfolding at the
[1:19:46] same time
[1:19:48] and it began here when John the Lord
[1:19:53] appears to him his Angel
[1:19:56] and speaks to him in verse 3 he says
[1:19:59] blessed is he that readeth and there you
[1:20:02] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[1:20:04] those things which are written therein
[1:20:06] for the time is at hand
[1:20:15] and he knows that God has given him this
[1:20:18] Revelation
[1:20:20] in symbol forms unto these seven
[1:20:23] churches these were actual seven
[1:20:26] churches in the days of John
[1:20:28] and the Ephesian church was a church
[1:20:32] that John actually pastored
[1:20:35] they're at the end of time
[1:20:38] but these seven natural churches
[1:20:42] we're going to represent seven spiritual
[1:20:45] churches
[1:20:46] it was going to represent the Journey of
[1:20:49] a gentile people
[1:20:53] and the church in general from the days
[1:20:57] of Jesus to the end of a Great
[1:20:59] Tribulation and let me say again we're
[1:21:02] living in the last church
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:06] and we're living under the message of
[1:21:09] the last seals
[1:22:09] you say the prince of the Kingdom
[1:22:20] this world is still in the hands of
[1:22:22] kings of the earth
[1:22:25] and he is
[1:22:28] the heir to everything
[1:22:31] that every King that every dictator
[1:22:36] that every Earthly ruler thinks they own
[1:22:42] um
[1:22:43] but they don't own it he is the prince
[1:22:46] to all of us because the prince is the
[1:22:49] air when the King dies
[1:22:57] so he is right now waiting
[1:23:00] to take this Earth back
[1:23:03] and he's the heir to all of it he's the
[1:23:06] prince of the Kings
[1:23:09] verse 6 says Kings and have made us
[1:23:13] Kings
[1:23:16] unto God and his father
[1:23:18] then verse 7 says behold he cometh with
[1:23:22] clouds
[1:23:42] the Bible says in the book of Acts that
[1:23:46] he was amongst the Believers for a
[1:23:48] period of 40 days
[1:23:51] and in those 40 days
[1:23:54] he was testifying to the to the children
[1:23:58] of God
[1:23:59] he was with his disciples he was
[1:24:03] confirming who he was
[1:24:06] Messiah he was risen
[1:24:09] he kept his word to them
[1:24:11] Israel had rejected it as a nation they
[1:24:15] had rejected him
[1:24:17] they're kings
[1:24:21] through the gospel and the Plan of
[1:24:24] Salvation
[1:24:25] part one the first seal you know what
[1:24:29] God had revealed to Israel was given to
[1:24:32] a gentile people
[1:24:34] this book of this Revelations here
[1:24:37] now we remember that when he talked to
[1:24:40] his disciples
[1:24:42] and he gave him a commission they're in
[1:24:44] the books
[1:24:47] he says and you'll be endured
[1:24:50] he didn't tell him how long to stay he
[1:24:54] didn't tell them how long it would take
[1:24:57] but they went they went because they
[1:25:00] were all so hiding
[1:25:02] they were being persecuted they were
[1:25:05] scared they were running from the Romans
[1:25:09] they were running from the Orthodox
[1:25:11] Jewish Church
[1:25:14] oh we're persecuting them
[1:25:17] the Bible says and the days of Elijah
[1:25:21] kingdom of God suffereth violence
[1:25:24] and the violent takes them by force
[1:25:28] that that was the church
[1:25:32] persecuted Believers in Christ
[1:25:35] that was Pagan Rome
[1:25:38] persecuting the Believers in Christ that
[1:25:42] was the ride of the White Horse Riders
[1:25:45] Revelation 6 2.
[1:25:47] that's when it began so now we can take
[1:25:51] Revelation 6 2.
[1:25:53] and we can plug that into the days of
[1:25:56] Jesus
[1:26:07] and prophecy became history in the days
[1:26:12] oh look at this book over here
[1:26:27] and Jesus when he gave the commission to
[1:26:30] the to the the apostles
[1:26:33] suppose and 120 Believers the Bible says
[1:26:37] as they talk I was caught up into the
[1:26:40] heavens
[1:26:42] and while they see him go
[1:26:45] he said there's two men behind him
[1:26:48] that they hadn't noticed before it was
[1:26:51] two angels and they said why look you up
[1:26:55] into the heavens
[1:26:56] as though something strange is happening
[1:27:00] he said but the way you see him go
[1:27:03] at the first coming is the way you'll
[1:27:07] see him come again
[1:27:10] he'll come with clouds again but those
[1:27:13] weren't regular clouds this is a book of
[1:27:16] symbols what caught Jesus away the first
[1:27:19] time
[1:27:20] it wasn't clouds it was a host of angels
[1:27:26] it was the term was used clouds
[1:27:31] even the pattern
[1:28:19] and it was called a mystery ring clouds
[1:28:23] it's Life Magazine March of 1963.
[1:28:28] I have an original copy and when you
[1:28:32] open it up
[1:28:34] it looks like a strange
[1:28:39] the the the the scientists that looked
[1:28:42] at it
[1:28:44] they said the cloud was about 30 miles
[1:28:47] 30 miles high
[1:28:50] about 20 miles in diameter or more
[1:28:54] he said but it was at a height
[1:28:57] that clouds do not existence this is a
[1:29:02] mystery clouds
[1:29:04] no clouds are formed at this height
[1:29:10] because it was a sign on to us in 1963.
[1:29:16] behold they cometh with clouds again and
[1:29:20] when you take that picture in Life
[1:29:21] magazine
[1:29:25] and you turn the magazine to the right
[1:29:28] it is exactly the face of Christ
[1:29:33] and in this silhouette of this Cloud
[1:29:36] you see the tips of the Angels Wings
[1:29:41] we didn't take the picture
[1:29:43] no church took the picture
[1:29:46] no no no no no uh men who are
[1:29:49] photographers for magazines
[1:29:54] it was unusual to them and they put it
[1:29:58] in life magazines
[1:30:01] God had him to put it there to fulfill
[1:30:05] this worship number seven
[1:30:07] when he comes again
[1:30:10] he'll come again the second time just
[1:30:13] like he left the first time that's what
[1:30:16] the Angels told the apostles
[1:30:28] they use that language
[1:30:32] no the first time it was Angels
[1:30:35] Jesus ascended on high
[1:30:37] glorified Lord Jesus
[1:30:44] and once again he told them the way
[1:30:47] you've seen him go
[1:30:49] the way you'll see him
[1:30:51] and John confirms what those angels
[1:30:58] and 40 50 years later
[1:31:34] you know what he said and they also
[1:31:37] which pierced him
[1:31:39] Israel the Jews and all kindreds of the
[1:31:42] Earth
[1:31:43] shall will because of him even so amen
[1:31:48] amen this is Jesus speaking
[1:31:51] John was watching this Vision unfold
[1:31:54] he was both seeing the things that he
[1:31:57] wrote
[1:31:58] and hearing the voice yes
[1:32:06] estabiendo
[1:32:24] God had that for His prophets
[1:32:27] long before Satan perverted him
[1:32:30] to steal your hearts and Minds away
[1:32:34] God still wants to give you a vision
[1:32:37] and open Our Eyes Open the Eyes
[1:32:49] foreign
[1:33:40] [Applause]
[1:33:49] and when he says he wants to change it
[1:33:52] and we know that that changes
[1:33:56] Oh Glory I am Alpha and Omega yes
[1:34:02] which is which words
[1:34:14] he wanted to put that book back in the
[1:34:18] hand of a Son of God
[1:34:30] can he created by your spoken word
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:37] he created a spoken word
[1:34:41] a spirit man and he created a body from
[1:34:45] the clay for him
[1:34:46] now he come again and body
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:36:02] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:36:04] forever
[1:36:08] John is watching all this unfold foreign
[1:36:34] for the word of God and for the
[1:36:37] testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:36:42] so are we
[1:36:45] God has placed you where you are even
[1:36:47] tonight
[1:36:49] because he wants to bring you to a place
[1:36:52] to be a testimony of Jesus Christ then
[1:36:57] he says I
[1:36:59] was in the spirit
[1:37:02] on the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[1:37:06] great voice
[1:37:08] and he continues to say and the voice
[1:37:11] said I'm Alpha and Omega
[1:37:13] I'm the first and the last even John
[1:37:16] receives a commission now
[1:37:19] directly from almighty God
[1:37:26] the Visions I'm going to give you down
[1:37:29] to the very detail
[1:37:31] write it in a book
[1:37:33] and send it unto the seven churches
[1:37:36] which are in Asia and to Ephesus
[1:37:45] Philadelphia
[1:37:47] can you search the history
[1:37:49] you'll find that all of these churches
[1:37:52] existed
[1:37:54] in the days of Jesus
[1:37:59] Paul visited all these places
[1:38:03] took the gospel to a gentile people
[1:38:06] because he told Peter just as God has
[1:38:10] given to you this precious word to take
[1:38:14] to the Jews so God has called me to take
[1:38:19] the same gospel now that Israel has
[1:38:22] rejected to a gentile people to the
[1:38:25] Bride of Jesus Christ through the body
[1:38:27] of Christ
[1:38:31] I turned to see the voice that spake
[1:38:34] with me
[1:38:36] and being turned I saw seven golden
[1:38:39] candles
[1:38:41] it was a candle opera
[1:38:44] it was what the Jews called the menorah
[1:38:50] it had a basin of oil
[1:38:53] and it had seven branches
[1:38:56] and Israel had it since the beginning
[1:38:59] that God established the Jewish Church
[1:40:00] and then they'd blow it out
[1:40:12] and they would like another stick from
[1:40:15] the second lamp that was lit
[1:40:18] um
[1:40:21] the fire was lit for the next lamp from
[1:40:27] the previous land
[1:40:29] they didn't take the same the same the
[1:40:31] same fire that he split the first one
[1:40:34] with
[1:40:36] and then go live in all seven
[1:40:40] the fire had to go from one age to the
[1:40:43] next
[1:40:44] fire from one age
[1:41:19] I saw one
[1:41:22] like unto the son of man
[1:41:25] that John if you'll remember
[1:41:27] as an apostle he was the one that the
[1:41:31] Bible says
[1:41:33] that many times would lay his head in
[1:41:36] the bosomes
[1:41:38] of Jesus
[1:41:42] they were close
[1:41:44] he was the Beloved you might say
[1:41:49] he knew him very well
[1:41:53] his face his beard his his stature is
[1:42:00] he could spot him from from a mile away
[1:42:03] so that's Jesus over there
[1:42:08] he knew he was he knew Jesus was the
[1:42:11] ministry of the son of man
[1:42:14] the son of man
[1:42:16] represents a god Prophet
[1:42:20] a son of man
[1:42:22] represents a prophetic ministry that's
[1:42:25] the difference in the scriptures
[1:42:31] under the Jewish beliefs
[1:42:35] the Jews would turn their prophets call
[1:42:39] them son of man
[1:42:42] it was a title they had given them
[1:42:45] but in the judeo church
[1:42:48] it wasn't a title so much to lift them
[1:42:51] up
[1:42:53] but it was a title to remind the
[1:42:56] prophets
[1:43:00] that though they were born a prophet
[1:43:03] and God would use them to speak to
[1:43:07] Israel usually under the law it was for
[1:43:09] judgment and rebukes
[1:43:19] the term son of man
[1:43:22] that Israel and the priests used to them
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:29] God may speak to you foreign
[1:44:19] John was saying here I saw someone
[1:44:23] I'm seeing someone in this Vision
[1:44:27] that looks like Jesus
[1:44:31] but this time he's clothed with a
[1:44:33] garment to the foot
[1:44:35] and he's Gert about the paps with the
[1:44:38] Golden Girls
[1:44:40] that means it was at the shoulders
[1:44:45] all wrapped around him
[1:44:47] as as a judge would wear
[1:44:51] the priest would wear the the Priestly
[1:44:55] and levite girdles
[1:45:00] around the waist
[1:45:04] it would show that they were in service
[1:45:08] for Ministry foreign
[1:45:22] represents
[1:45:31] that's why John was wondering
[1:45:35] the man looks just like Jesus
[1:45:38] but his hairs are white like wool
[1:45:42] his eyes are like a flame of fire
[1:45:45] he's never seen Jesus like this before
[1:45:49] it looks like him but he's dressed
[1:45:52] differently his hair is different and
[1:45:55] his feet like unto fine breasts
[1:46:04] he's seen Jesus in a way that he's never
[1:46:08] seen him before in this Vision he says
[1:46:11] in his right hand he has seven stars
[1:46:14] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[1:46:16] two-edged sword
[1:46:18] its own symbols that would be revealed
[1:46:21] his countenance was as the sun shineth
[1:46:24] in his Straits
[1:46:27] and when he saw him
[1:46:29] I fell at his feet is dead
[1:46:33] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:46:36] saying unto me fear
[1:46:39] I jesus
[1:46:53] at this point
[1:46:57] I have the keys
[1:47:00] oh do we need to fear deaths
[1:47:06] no no not if you've given your life to
[1:47:09] Jesus Christ
[1:47:10] he holds those keys no man can put you
[1:47:14] in there he can take you there
[1:47:21] you come to be friend of Jesus and it's
[1:47:26] not a place you need to worry about it
[1:47:29] he said in verse 18.
[1:47:35] and behold I'm Alive forevermore
[1:47:39] and you have the keys
[1:47:44] then he goes on to tell him write the
[1:47:46] things which thou has seen
[1:47:48] and the things which are the things
[1:47:50] which shall be here after verse 19.
[1:47:55] and he begins to unfold some of the
[1:47:59] mysteries of these symbols
[1:48:02] this is the mystery of the Seven Stars
[1:48:04] which thou saw us in my right hand he
[1:48:06] said
[1:48:09] and the Seven golden candles
[1:48:12] first the Stars the stars are the Angels
[1:48:16] of the seven churches
[1:48:19] the word angel in the Bible
[1:48:22] means Messengers
[1:48:25] that's simply it means Messengers
[1:48:32] and the word angel in the Bible
[1:48:36] simply means a messenger
[1:48:38] so then you have to dig deeper
[1:48:41] is this a Heavenly Angel is
[1:48:44] this an Earthly messenger
[1:48:49] then you have to dig deeper
[1:48:51] and say Lord more Revelation please
[1:48:56] more detail please and he'll bring it
[1:48:59] because Upon This World
[1:49:02] in Matthew 16. I'll build this church
[1:49:06] of Hell will prevail against it
[1:49:11] it was when Jesus
[1:49:17] some think you're Jeremiah or one of the
[1:49:21] prophets
[1:49:28] because even if a prophet was to rise
[1:49:31] from the dead
[1:49:33] Remember The Parables
[1:49:36] of of that old beggar
[1:49:41] called Lazarus the Bible said he died in
[1:49:45] the streets and Angels came and picked
[1:49:48] him up
[1:49:49] and took him into the bosom of Abraham
[1:49:52] they also called Paradise
[1:49:56] also known as The Fifth Dimension
[1:49:59] because there's seven dimensions we live
[1:50:02] in the first three
[1:50:04] time matters
[1:50:06] the fourth dimension is the dimension
[1:50:10] elemention of Music a video the video of
[1:50:14] Internet the internet of all the I.T
[1:50:17] stuff that travels through the air
[1:50:19] Technologies
[1:50:24] the first part
[1:50:27] that was created for the devil in his
[1:50:29] angels
[1:50:31] there's a supernatural barrier
[1:51:01] for those who have rejected
[1:51:05] it's not the final judgment
[1:51:08] and people are there yet tonight
[1:51:12] awaiting a great white Throne judgment
[1:51:16] where the Bible says the bride and the
[1:51:19] groom
[1:51:22] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:51:24] the Bible calls the wise version
[1:51:28] those that are those that won't see
[1:51:30] death and be raptured
[1:51:32] those the queen will sit with the King
[1:51:35] and she'll judge the whole world
[1:51:40] so here it is which is the mysteries of
[1:51:43] the Seven stars without Solace and my
[1:51:45] right hand
[1:51:46] the Seven Stars are the Angels of the
[1:51:49] seven churches
[1:51:51] so these are Church age angels
[1:51:56] age Messengers
[1:51:59] these are these are these are are men
[1:52:03] these angels these Messengers and
[1:52:07] there's one to each Church age that was
[1:52:09] given yeah
[1:52:10] he said and the Seven Stars of the
[1:52:13] angels of the seven churches
[1:52:15] or The Messengers that God would say
[1:52:18] to each one of these ages
[1:52:24] and the Seven Candle ticks
[1:52:28] are there seven churches then the book
[1:52:31] goes into chapter two
[1:52:33] and here God begins speaking
[1:52:36] through every Church in Revelations 2
[1:52:44] of the fall of this church
[1:52:48] it warns them of how Satan's trying to
[1:52:51] deceive them
[1:52:55] it tells them of the patients also that
[1:52:58] some are having
[1:53:01] because in the midst of this Ephesian
[1:53:03] Church
[1:53:05] there's a little group of Believers that
[1:53:09] have been holding to the words
[1:53:13] and then it then it announces a blessing
[1:53:16] as in verse 7 of Revelations
[1:53:20] to the Church of Ephesus he says he that
[1:53:23] had an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:53:25] says unto the churches
[1:53:27] oh how we need to have an ear and be
[1:53:31] attentive to what the spirit says
[1:53:33] that's a that's a relationship that's a
[1:53:37] personal experience that we need that's
[1:53:40] what gives us an ear to hear
[1:53:42] it opens the eyes of our understanding
[1:53:46] when we're talking to Jesus
[1:53:51] every evening
[1:53:54] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:53:56] the church
[1:53:59] will I give to eat of the tree
[1:54:03] it's what Adam and Eve is
[1:54:10] they should have eaten
[1:54:30] the Bible even said of Jesus
[1:54:36] in Isaiah 7. that God would send forth
[1:54:41] his son
[1:54:42] he would give them a sign he would send
[1:54:45] forth his son
[1:54:49] and he would eat only butter and honey
[1:54:53] it's symbols
[1:54:56] that he might that he might not know how
[1:55:00] to receive the goodness
[1:55:05] so you don't have to partake of the evil
[1:55:12] no no bring up the kids in the way that
[1:55:16] they should grow the Bible says
[1:55:19] teaching the good things of God
[1:55:22] give him the good of the land of this
[1:55:25] word of God
[1:55:29] righteousness and Holiness
[1:55:32] that's what we'll teach them
[1:55:39] God rich in Mercedes
[1:55:45] but the spirit saith unto the church
[1:55:49] if you want to overcome
[1:55:52] Eater of the tree of life
[1:55:54] and reject and reject the tree the
[1:56:00] knowledge
[1:56:02] that goes on to the second Church in
[1:56:04] Smyrna International and to the angel of
[1:56:07] the church in Smyrna yesterday
[1:56:09] or unto the messengers
[1:56:14] unto the prophet that God's going to
[1:56:16] send to them
[1:56:18] write this thing say it the first and
[1:56:21] the last which which was dead and is
[1:56:23] alive
[1:56:27] and it goes on in its Church age
[1:56:30] and at the end of every Church age
[1:56:34] like in verse 11. of the age of Smyrna
[1:56:39] he says he didn't have an ear let him
[1:56:42] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:56:43] churches
[1:56:48] he says
[1:56:51] shall not be foreign
[1:57:10] and God told them
[1:57:15] he that overcome it
[1:57:18] the second death
[1:57:19] will not touch you
[1:57:23] because when you leave this whole body
[1:57:26] I'll Grant you eternal life
[1:57:28] and the second death will never touch it
[1:57:33] to leave this body is
[1:57:40] but do not come to a place
[1:57:43] where you've lived a life worthy of the
[1:57:45] gospel
[1:57:47] and worthy of that Celestial body
[1:57:51] that's the second day
[1:57:59] the Third Church
[1:58:04] to the angel to the messenger to the
[1:58:09] prophet of the church
[1:58:18] which had the sharp sword with two edges
[1:58:21] that represented the word of God that
[1:58:26] represented God's Plan of Redemption
[1:58:30] two-edged sword
[1:58:34] represented the revelation of these
[1:58:36] Seven Seals
[1:58:38] which is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:58:41] these seven Parts these Seven Seals it's
[1:58:45] the revelation of Jesus Christ that's
[1:58:49] what the book The Bible is all about
[1:58:52] that's why God has sent Faithful Men
[1:58:58] you might say
[1:59:00] well there's not a lot of them
[1:59:03] well the bride
[1:59:06] is not a big number
[1:59:13] in closing tonight turn with me to
[1:59:16] Ephesians
[1:59:19] Ephesians chapter four
[1:59:34] after Jesus
[1:59:36] is death burial and Resurrection yes
[1:59:46] let's re let's begin reading at verse 9.
[1:59:52] or verse
[1:59:53] speaking of Jesus now
[1:59:57] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[2:00:00] on high he led captivity captive
[2:00:04] foreign
[2:01:04] higher
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:02:27] [Music]
[2:02:48] [Music]
[2:03:02] foreign
[2:03:16] he set them free
[2:03:18] took him from a Fifth Dimension
[2:03:21] a waiting place
[2:03:23] to a sixth Dimension beyond the curtain
[2:03:27] of time
[2:03:29] because they're in the fifth Dimensions
[2:03:31] they could see the torment happening
[2:03:35] on those that had forsaken God
[2:03:40] that's why Lazarus could see that that
[2:03:43] rich man suffering in hell
[2:03:47] and that rich man could see Lazarus in
[2:03:50] the bosom in the arms of Abraham yes
[2:03:55] he said he said Lord let him dip his
[2:03:58] finger and just give me a little water
[2:04:00] to drink
[2:04:03] he was suffering in torments and now
[2:04:07] Lazarus was blessed
[2:04:09] No More Pain No More Death no more
[2:04:12] suffering
[2:04:13] now the rich man was suffering another
[2:04:16] rich man was in torment
[2:04:19] he says let him dip his finger and give
[2:04:22] me a little bit to drink
[2:04:25] no he said you cannot cross over to
[2:04:28] paradise and they cannot cross over into
[2:04:31] your toes
[2:04:33] but they could see each other
[2:04:36] they could see the great mistake they
[2:04:38] had made
[2:04:40] and those on the paradise side
[2:04:43] could see the great reward
[2:04:47] greater than all the suffering they
[2:04:49] suffered
[2:04:51] what's this reward foreign
[2:05:14] for a resurrection to go talk to my
[2:05:17] brother
[2:05:19] he said no no he's even if a prophet was
[2:05:22] to resurrect
[2:05:24] they would never believe him
[2:05:26] if they didn't believe him when they
[2:05:28] were on Earth
[2:05:35] I won't do that no no way I said I won't
[2:05:37] do it now I won't do it tomorrow I won't
[2:05:40] do whatever the only need for this
[2:05:43] private resurrection of one man
[2:05:47] there's a resurrection of Jesus Christ
[2:05:50] because that would mean he would he had
[2:05:53] overcome death
[2:05:59] he rose the third day to take a hold of
[2:06:03] this
[2:06:07] couldn't hold him
[2:06:18] he said now that he
[2:06:30] unto men
[2:06:33] now that he ascended what is it but that
[2:06:36] he also descended
[2:06:38] first into the lower parts of the earth
[2:06:42] you see where Jesus went you see where
[2:06:46] the father went as the body of Jesus
[2:06:51] the spirit of God
[2:06:54] and he went down into the lower parts of
[2:06:57] the earth
[2:06:58] to preach to the laws
[2:07:01] and to bring out the righteous of the
[2:07:03] Old Testament
[2:07:05] to give them an old-fashioned camp
[2:07:07] meeting
[2:07:10] with the Holy Ghost
[2:07:12] to give them a born-again experience
[2:07:16] they're in that Dimension so that from
[2:07:19] there he could pull them out
[2:07:21] because now it wasn't the blood of bulls
[2:07:24] and goats
[2:07:28] and washes away
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:36] descended is the same also that ascended
[2:07:39] or Above All The Heavens that he might
[2:07:42] feel
[2:07:44] and when he ascended
[2:07:47] these are the gifts that he sent down
[2:07:50] to the church he gave some Apostles
[2:07:54] and some prophets
[2:07:58] and some pastors and teachers it's
[2:08:02] called the faithful Ministry of Jesus
[2:08:04] Christ
[2:08:11] the law and the prophets
[2:08:15] but God wasn't annulling the prophetic
[2:08:18] Ministry
[2:08:19] God was going to change the way they
[2:08:22] preached
[2:08:23] he wasn't going to use the prophetic
[2:08:25] Ministries
[2:08:26] to bring judgment and Damnation
[2:08:30] no no they were going to come now and
[2:08:32] preach the kingdom of heaven
[2:08:41] and you shall receive the Holy Ghost on
[2:08:44] Fire
[2:08:47] and so were the apostles yes yes and so
[2:08:51] are the evangelists in the New Testament
[2:08:53] and so should the pastors and the
[2:08:55] teachers
[2:08:56] oh thou preaching the Kingdom of Heaven
[2:08:59] is at hand
[2:09:01] the foundation stone in your life
[2:09:08] and it's guaranteed I'll give you the
[2:09:11] Holy Ghost on Fire
[2:09:13] you'll never be the same again
[2:09:18] in the preaching of this foundation
[2:09:22] stone of a New Testament Church
[2:09:32] what was the purpose
[2:09:38] for the work of the ministry for the
[2:09:42] edifying of the body of Christ
[2:09:44] is this faithful Ministries
[2:09:53] that's what Paul taught
[2:09:57] that's what the Holy Spirit told them to
[2:09:59] teach
[2:10:00] then he says till we all come in the
[2:10:02] unity of the faith
[2:10:05] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[2:10:08] unto a perfect man
[2:10:10] unto the measure of the stature of the
[2:10:13] fullness of Christ
[2:10:15] Paul was a prophet
[2:10:18] Paul was an apostle Paul
[2:10:21] was an angel Messenger
[2:10:23] to the first church
[2:10:26] Paul preached perfection
[2:10:30] until you come to the measure
[2:10:33] of the fullness
[2:10:37] that's how you know
[2:10:45] how do you know when they say they're
[2:10:47] prophets
[2:10:50] because they Don't Preach
[2:10:52] Christo they preach themselves they
[2:10:55] build their own kingdoms
[2:10:57] they build their own churches they build
[2:11:01] their own denominations
[2:11:03] but when they preach Christ
[2:11:05] they're in the word
[2:11:07] be an anointed of the spirit
[2:11:11] bringing you to the to the unity of the
[2:11:14] faith bringing you and I to the
[2:11:17] knowledge of the Son of God
[2:11:20] in verse 14.
[2:11:23] the Apostle Paul said what was the
[2:11:26] purpose
[2:11:29] preaching the Kingdom of Heaven
[2:11:32] the purpose is this verse 14.
[2:11:37] we henceforth
[2:11:39] no more children
[2:11:43] and carried about with every wind of
[2:11:46] doctrines
[2:11:48] by the slide of men
[2:11:51] as we hear in this day
[2:11:53] all the ungodly doctrines
[2:11:56] and coming craftiness whereby they lie
[2:12:00] and wait to deceived
[2:12:03] but speaking the truth and love
[2:12:06] that we may grow up
[2:12:09] unto him and all things
[2:12:11] which is the head okay
[2:12:17] we thank God for his faithful Ministry
[2:12:20] but it's all about Jesus foreign
[2:12:51] but he has chosen you and he's chosen me
[2:12:57] that we follow God's program
[2:13:00] he would baptize us with his holy ghosts
[2:13:05] said in the message of the Patmos
[2:13:07] Visions
[2:13:09] he says the Bible said in Revelations
[2:13:13] that the Antichrist in the last days
[2:13:16] he says now look at these churches all
[2:13:18] getting together
[2:13:20] talking of all the denominations from
[2:13:23] the Catholic to the Pentecost
[2:13:25] the Antichrist in the last days
[2:13:28] would deceive all that was on the earth
[2:13:31] whose names were not written in the
[2:13:33] Lamb's Book of Life
[2:13:35] the foundation of the world when was
[2:13:39] your name put on The Book of Life
[2:13:43] we ever had a world
[2:13:51] in this age
[2:13:54] whereby you are sealed foreign
[2:14:01] but between your ceiling of the Holy
[2:14:03] Ghost
[2:14:05] in the end of this age God has promised
[2:14:09] refillings
[2:14:11] as I said before
[2:14:14] refillings of the Holy Spirit
[2:14:16] are not because you've been a good
[2:14:18] person
