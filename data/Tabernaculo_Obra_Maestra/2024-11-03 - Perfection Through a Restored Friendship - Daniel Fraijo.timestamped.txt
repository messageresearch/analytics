[47:15] thank you
[47:17] Lord for all that you have done for
[47:20] us we are
[47:23] thankful for all of the benefits
[47:29] what God did with us at the cross of
[47:32] Calvary he shed his Precious
[47:37] Blood not the the the blood cell
[47:40] natural even if he did
[47:43] it but what it
[47:46] represented it
[47:49] represented literal life of
[47:52] God that He gave for
[47:55] us and now we can receive the life of
[47:57] that
[47:59] lamb because this
[48:02] lamb was our kinsman
[48:06] redeemer it was not only a beast of the
[48:08] fields
[48:09] only that was the
[48:13] symbol what Jesus did at the cross of
[48:16] Calvary what the creator of the heavens
[48:18] and earth
[48:20] did it was the
[48:22] reality it was not the symbol it was
[48:25] which was real it was which was
[48:28] effective it was the promise made flesh
[48:31] God bless you all this
[48:33] morning to be here once
[48:36] again we'll be ministering in English
[48:39] this
[48:41] morning I told Brother
[48:43] Honan that this morning he's the
[48:48] Mexican so we'll change back and
[48:52] forth it'll be good for all of
[48:55] us and we'll read in in Matthew
[48:59] 5 verse
[49:01] three once again we're speaking on this
[49:06] subject
[49:07] Perfection through a restored
[49:11] friendship with the
[49:13] father Jonathan is it easier of this L
[49:17] slatter there you go
[49:19] thank Matthew chap
[49:22] 5 and verse
[49:24] three blessed are the porn in
[49:28] spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of
[49:32] Heaven let's pray Heavenly Father we
[49:36] thank you once again this
[49:39] morning Grace for your
[49:41] mercy for your loving
[49:44] kindness I ask your blessing upon your
[49:50] word that something can be
[49:52] said that will go to every
[49:55] heart that it bring us another
[49:59] change a change that draws us closer to
[50:02] you and we ask all these
[50:05] things in Jesus name amen am you may be
[50:11] seated in closing last
[50:16] service we read we we read Matthew
[50:22] 5:3 where it says blessed are the poor
[50:25] in spirit
[50:27] for theirs is the kingdom of
[50:30] heaven and we shared with you how these
[50:34] two
[50:35] words in
[50:37] spirit can also be used as one
[50:41] word and and when you put the two words
[50:45] together it gives it another
[50:47] meaning he in spirit when used as one
[50:53] word when you use it just as one word
[50:57] then it means to
[51:00] encourage it means to
[51:05] enliven and and so that's what was
[51:08] coming and Happening
[51:10] Here for Matthew Chapter
[51:13] 5 was Jesus
[51:16] preaching on
[51:18] Perfection Perfection being the
[51:23] Capstone Perfection being the Capstone
[51:27] of something God is going to want wants
[51:30] to begin in our
[51:33] lives and that's something that he wants
[51:35] to
[51:37] begin to to help you start your
[51:41] journey A Journey Back to
[51:44] Eden and I'm speaking
[51:47] symbolically A Journey Back to
[51:49] Eden which is the Born Again
[51:53] experience which takes you back to Eden
[51:57] it's the Born Again
[51:59] experience that takes you to the
[52:02] Capstone this Christian
[52:05] Life which is
[52:07] perfection which is which doesn't mean
[52:09] you can do something better than someone
[52:14] else no it means you arrive to eternal
[52:18] life it means you're as Eternal now as
[52:21] the father is
[52:24] eternal that's Bible per
[52:27] Perfection
[52:29] otherwise the way people think of
[52:33] perfection humanistic
[52:36] way arrives to this
[52:39] conclusion we cannot be
[52:44] perfect we can't be a perfect
[52:48] Mason someone will always find one
[52:50] little fault in what we
[52:53] did we can't be the perfect Carpenter
[52:58] another Carpenter can always find a
[53:00] little something
[53:02] there the day we think we're the perfect
[53:06] roofer someone will come and find a
[53:10] fault in our Roofing in our
[53:16] carpentry and when that
[53:19] happens we
[53:21] go see we we don't like it we thought we
[53:25] were perfect
[53:27] it upsets
[53:28] us and yet when we think about
[53:32] it sincerely we
[53:34] say well yeah that part wasn't so
[53:38] good so that kind of
[53:41] perfection it don't exist but Bible
[53:45] Perfection God given
[53:48] Perfection it's real it's
[53:52] quickening it's
[53:55] encouraging Bible
[53:57] Perfection it will
[54:02] Quicken it will Quicken us translate Us
[54:06] by the power of the Holy
[54:08] Spirit once again into the presence of
[54:10] the
[54:11] father that place where the first Adam
[54:14] once
[54:15] lived and where he fell from We're
[54:18] called to go back to that
[54:20] spot stand before almighty God
[54:27] and
[54:28] say our
[54:30] father who are no longer in
[54:33] heaven but now you stand at my
[54:36] side Hallowed be thy
[54:41] name we have five senses we spoke of
[54:45] it
[54:47] seeing
[54:49] hearing
[54:50] touching
[54:53] smell and taste and as we shared with
[54:56] you if you don't surrender these these
[55:00] senses to the Holy Spirit we then use
[55:04] them more
[55:06] often to to
[55:09] discourage than to encourage each
[55:12] other we have five senses of the
[55:16] spirit
[55:17] memory
[55:19] imagination conscience affections
[55:23] reasoning and if you don't surrender
[55:26] these senses to the Holy
[55:29] Spirit you will use these to
[55:33] discourage more often than to
[55:37] encourage and when through these senses
[55:39] of the
[55:40] body and of the
[55:42] spirit we can no longer even encourage
[55:47] ourselves we need God to take
[55:50] control we need to ask have I really
[55:52] been born again
[55:56] holy ghost or do I need a refilling and
[55:59] I need it today
[56:03] May and you know what it's a good place
[56:07] to
[56:08] be for a child of God because it's the
[56:12] beginning of your Exodus
[56:16] Journey out of all the Natural Things of
[56:19] this natural
[56:22] man and it's a
[56:25] journey that you'll take unto
[56:29] Perfection Matthew 5 verse 2 and
[56:34] 3 it says
[56:37] this and he opened his mouth and taught
[56:41] them
[56:43] saying because the ministry of
[56:47] Jesus was a teach Teaching
[56:51] Ministry because the ministry of
[56:54] Jesus was the lamb
[56:56] opening the Lamb's Book of
[56:59] Life teaching us
[57:02] everything that he had once tried to
[57:04] teach to
[57:06] Adam and to Eve but they
[57:10] fail so God has come back
[57:13] again in this in this
[57:16] Century because he's told us his word
[57:18] will not return
[57:21] void if he couldn't do it with Adam and
[57:24] Eve
[57:26] I'll do it in the days of
[57:29] L I'll create a whole new
[57:33] dimension I'll call it the bright
[57:36] age you can enter into this bright
[57:39] age I will
[57:41] Quicken I will transform you the power
[57:45] of the Holy
[57:46] Ghost take you into
[57:49] Perfection you can be
[57:51] Eternal just like I am eternal
[57:56] and he and he opened his mouth and
[57:58] taught them
[58:01] saying
[58:03] blessed are the poor in
[58:06] spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[58:10] heaven and though your poor in
[58:14] spirit in your
[58:16] heart is a
[58:18] seed a
[58:20] soul and you've always been a child of
[58:24] God you are in the mind Mind Of God
[58:27] before the foundation of the
[58:29] world that seed was placed in this in
[58:32] this earth and
[58:36] vessel God God sees that because of that
[58:41] you're born poor in
[58:43] spirit but because you're a
[58:46] child he says I'm going to bless you
[58:48] that are poor in
[58:50] spirit I'm going to give you a
[58:52] kingdom and I'm going to tell you the
[58:55] steps that you have to
[58:57] take to come out of that
[59:03] poorness and he opened his mouth and
[59:06] taught them
[59:08] saying blessed are the poor in
[59:10] spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of
[59:15] Heaven your natural birth on
[59:18] Earth it's not your end if you're a
[59:21] child of
[59:23] God it's your beginning
[59:28] if your serpent
[59:30] seed it is the beginning of your end but
[59:34] if you're a child of
[59:36] God it's the
[59:38] beginning of a
[59:41] restoration all that the Locust has
[59:45] eaten all that the canker worm has
[59:48] eaten all that those four worms have
[59:52] eaten all that those four horse riders
[59:54] have destroyed and killed
[59:59] I shall restore sayth the
[1:00:02] Lord and in Genesis
[1:00:05] 18 we're going to read a story that you
[1:00:07] know
[1:00:09] well of a daughter of
[1:00:11] God who was poor in
[1:00:14] spirit Genesis
[1:00:16] 18 and verses 1
[1:00:19] [Music]
[1:00:20] to3 and the Lord appeared to him in the
[1:00:23] plains of mamry the
[1:00:29] a few years back I had looked up the
[1:00:31] word
[1:00:33] mamre and and I found where where one
[1:00:37] definition of the
[1:00:39] word that the word
[1:00:42] mam also meant
[1:00:46] change and the Bible says and the Lord
[1:00:48] appeared to him in the Plaines of mamry
[1:00:51] and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat
[1:00:53] of the day
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:01:01] this was
[1:01:02] Abraham the time of a promise had
[1:01:05] come and the Bible said and the Lord
[1:01:09] appeared unto Abraham in the plains of
[1:01:14] mamry in other words the Lord appeared
[1:01:17] unto Abraham because now was the time he
[1:01:19] was going to bring
[1:01:24] change a great
[1:01:26] change a supernatural
[1:01:29] change a change that is humanly
[1:01:33] impossible but for God nothing is too
[1:01:37] great nothing is impossible nothing is
[1:01:40] too hard verse two and he lifted up his
[1:01:44] eyes and looked and low three men stood
[1:01:46] by
[1:01:50] him it was almighty God in a body of
[1:01:54] Flesh
[1:01:56] and he had given
[1:01:58] bodies to Gabriel and
[1:02:00] Michael and they stood there all
[1:02:04] three he said and when he saw them he
[1:02:07] ran to meet them from the tent door and
[1:02:09] bowed himself towards the
[1:02:16] ground and Abraham looked at the
[1:02:20] three but there was only
[1:02:22] one that meant the most to him
[1:02:26] and there
[1:02:27] was and and and and because there was a
[1:02:31] voice that he had
[1:02:34] heard and when he heard that
[1:02:36] voice he said that's
[1:02:38] him that
[1:02:40] man has the voice that has spoke to me
[1:02:45] all my
[1:02:47] life it's like when we first heard a
[1:02:51] message not to lift up a man but we said
[1:02:56] that man has a voice that that's been
[1:02:59] speaking to me all my
[1:03:01] life that's the voice of God the voice
[1:03:05] of the Holy
[1:03:06] Spirit
[1:03:08] glory and said my
[1:03:11] Lord if I have found favor in thy sight
[1:03:14] pass not away I pray thee from thy
[1:03:21] servant
[1:03:22] Abraham the time for change had come
[1:03:27] he'd been waiting for 25
[1:03:31] years Paul testified and said he never
[1:03:34] wavered
[1:03:38] once he NE never wavered once but
[1:03:42] believed
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:44] god let's go to verse
[1:03:50] n and they said unto
[1:03:52] him Sarah where is thy wife
[1:03:57] he said behold in the
[1:04:00] tent so
[1:04:02] Abraham was standing looking at almighty
[1:04:09] God and the Lord had his back to the
[1:04:14] tent just like you have your backs to
[1:04:16] that door that's behind
[1:04:20] you and that's where Sarah was behind
[1:04:22] the tent door in the tent
[1:04:25] and they said unto him where is Sarah
[1:04:27] thy wife he said behold in the
[1:04:32] tent and he said I will certainly return
[1:04:35] unto thee according to the time of
[1:04:39] life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a
[1:04:44] son and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:04:47] which was behind
[1:04:51] him thou Abraham and Sarah were well
[1:04:54] stricken in age
[1:04:58] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[1:05:00] manner of
[1:05:03] women
[1:05:05] therefore therefore Sarah had a right to
[1:05:11] laugh Sarah's back in the
[1:05:14] tent and here's Abraham
[1:05:18] outside she's she's thinking he's H in
[1:05:21] fellowship with a few Brothers again
[1:05:26] and for 25
[1:05:27] years he has sat with
[1:05:30] men outside of my tent door and they've
[1:05:34] all talked and laughed and he told them
[1:05:37] isn't it
[1:05:38] wonderful God told me Sarah's going to
[1:05:41] give me a
[1:05:42] son promise of
[1:05:45] God Sarah said that that was all right
[1:05:49] when I was
[1:05:51] 40 when I was
[1:05:53] 50 when I was 60 I thought okay
[1:05:57] all right then I turned
[1:06:00] 70 and he's still out there
[1:06:02] fellowshipping with the
[1:06:04] Brethren telling them we're going to
[1:06:06] have a
[1:06:08] child and then I turned
[1:06:11] 80 and he did it again he called it
[1:06:15] fellowship with the
[1:06:17] Brethren telling them we're going to
[1:06:20] have a child me and
[1:06:22] Sarah but I'm 90 years old now
[1:06:25] and she
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:27] laughed she laughed out of
[1:06:30] frustration she laughed out of
[1:06:33] anger she laughed because she said
[1:06:36] doesn't the man get it it's too
[1:06:41] late therefore Sarah laughed within
[1:06:44] herself
[1:06:46] saying after I am waxed
[1:06:49] old verse 12
[1:06:55] shall I have pleasure my Lord being old
[1:07:00] also here was a
[1:07:03] woman poor in spirit after having waited
[1:07:07] on Abraham's
[1:07:10] inspiration and hope for almost 25 years
[1:07:14] of
[1:07:15] waiting and it didn't happen and what
[1:07:18] she thought was a reasonable amount of
[1:07:23] time at this time
[1:07:26] Sarah was poor in
[1:07:28] spirit she needed God to encourage
[1:07:31] her she needed God to enliven
[1:07:36] her her
[1:07:38] memory was working against
[1:07:42] her I can't remember one
[1:07:46] woman and I'm 90 years
[1:07:49] old has ever had a
[1:07:51] child 0 years old
[1:07:56] Her
[1:07:58] Imagination told her don't even go there
[1:08:01] Sarah you don't want a baby at
[1:08:05] 90 her
[1:08:07] conscience told
[1:08:09] her this can't
[1:08:11] be her affections told
[1:08:15] her I'm
[1:08:17] 90 I'm a
[1:08:18] grandma I I want to hold
[1:08:22] grandchildren not my own children
[1:08:25] it's over for
[1:08:27] me her reasoning told
[1:08:30] her this is not
[1:08:33] reasonable for Abraham to keep having
[1:08:37] these times of
[1:08:39] fellowship and telling those
[1:08:41] men I'm going to have his
[1:08:46] child all of these
[1:08:50] senses were now taking
[1:08:52] her far from the promise
[1:08:56] not
[1:08:57] closer Sarah in her
[1:09:00] spirit had hit a poverty
[1:09:04] level she didn't
[1:09:07] feel that she was at the
[1:09:10] threshold of a
[1:09:13] promise but that this promise had passed
[1:09:15] her
[1:09:17] up the door had shut she was left
[1:09:22] outside I'm a laughing St so so
[1:09:31] and to all around
[1:09:36] me you know there was a
[1:09:39] man who also told us that a
[1:09:44] promise that a
[1:09:46] vision had passed him
[1:09:48] up he had told us that God had been
[1:09:53] faithful but he hadn't done what God
[1:09:56] told him to
[1:09:59] do and and God had done his
[1:10:02] part but he failed to do what God told
[1:10:05] him to
[1:10:07] see the Promise passed him
[1:10:09] up and it wasn't going to come back
[1:10:13] again in the message wisdom versus
[1:10:19] Faith a prophet said
[1:10:22] this just before I went out there
[1:10:27] how many remembers me repeating it
[1:10:29] here that a voice came to
[1:10:32] me in the room one morning after a
[1:10:37] vision and and told about the
[1:10:40] serpent and it had been
[1:10:43] bound and not to fear
[1:10:46] anything he he said do not
[1:10:48] fear he said haven't I
[1:10:51] proven to haven't I proven to be
[1:10:56] with you wherever you
[1:10:58] go haven't I proven to be with you on
[1:11:00] your hunting
[1:11:03] trips so what were the hunting trips
[1:11:07] about to to give William
[1:11:10] brandom the
[1:11:12] Assurance to to speak his
[1:11:15] word to show him I'm always going to be
[1:11:18] with you when I say I'm going to be with
[1:11:22] you he said remember when I told
[1:11:25] you about what I was going to
[1:11:29] get before I left and all of that see
[1:11:34] haven't I proved it haven't I proved to
[1:11:36] be with
[1:11:37] you then a real sweet voice came and
[1:11:41] said the never failing presence of Jesus
[1:11:46] Christ is with you wherever you
[1:11:50] go and I know by
[1:11:52] that that we're moving up to something
[1:11:56] I don't know what it is I can't say
[1:12:00] coming home the other night or the other
[1:12:03] day just before I came
[1:12:05] home I fell into a
[1:12:08] vision and I se some little
[1:12:11] fellas thin looked like young
[1:12:15] boys they had on caps and we were
[1:12:18] standing
[1:12:20] hunting and I had shot a mammoth big
[1:12:23] brown looking bear
[1:12:28] and then they turned around and said to
[1:12:31] me but there are some confusion about
[1:12:34] the
[1:12:36] meeting I I said no matter what the
[1:12:38] confusion
[1:12:41] is if I was supposed to
[1:12:43] go wherever it was I I'll go
[1:12:47] anyway see it doesn't
[1:12:50] matter and the vision stopped I don't
[1:12:53] know where that where that's at
[1:12:56] but this is on tape it's going to happen
[1:12:59] see remember it's going to happen it's a
[1:13:04] vision in the message possessing all
[1:13:07] things
[1:13:10] 1965 verse
[1:13:12] 11 brother bam
[1:13:14] says that was 1962 the quote
[1:13:19] before in in in April this is May
[1:13:23] now and he says many of you remember the
[1:13:26] vision that I
[1:13:28] had where I shot the grizzly
[1:13:33] bear N9 foot grizzly
[1:13:36] bear and the church remembers me telling
[1:13:38] it
[1:13:40] here and the
[1:13:42] Caribou he said I had another
[1:13:45] one remember it's on tape
[1:13:48] here I've seen a great huge brown
[1:13:52] bear that that might be a Cody
[1:13:58] and it wouldn't have worked down there
[1:14:00] in
[1:14:02] Canada because they're not there you
[1:14:06] see but wherever it will
[1:14:08] be it will be that's thus sayith the
[1:14:12] Lord it will be
[1:14:15] see he had a promise he had a vision it
[1:14:20] was thus sayith the Lord so it must come
[1:14:23] to pass
[1:14:25] now September of
[1:14:29] 1962 he had gone on that hunt
[1:14:32] already listen to what he says
[1:14:34] now in going on 32 years of
[1:14:41] ministry I've tried to stay true to the
[1:14:45] word I don't know of one thing I've ever
[1:14:48] had to alter
[1:14:51] on because I read it out of the Bible
[1:14:56] so if there's a
[1:14:57] Doctrine and you can't start by reading
[1:14:59] it out of the
[1:15:02] Bible it's not a Bible Doctrine
[1:15:05] then that's all he said so he says he
[1:15:10] says I don't know of one thing I've ever
[1:15:13] had to alter on because I read it out of
[1:15:15] the
[1:15:19] Bible said said said just what the Bible
[1:15:23] said
[1:15:25] and Let It Go like that so I haven't had
[1:15:28] to take back or
[1:15:33] rearrange because I just said it the way
[1:15:35] the Bible says
[1:15:38] it and I find out if God has spoken
[1:15:43] anything then we must go with that
[1:15:47] word in order to make it to be
[1:15:51] fulfilled we seen that as I told you
[1:15:54] last night
[1:15:56] of a vision just recently
[1:15:59] see that I had to be
[1:16:02] there and and warned to be
[1:16:05] there and and God told me six months
[1:16:08] before to be on that
[1:16:12] spot and and stand there and
[1:16:15] saying go down
[1:16:18] there three
[1:16:20] times with them he's speaking now about
[1:16:23] those young boys
[1:16:25] the
[1:16:26] hunt those young
[1:16:29] boys on this hunt telling me six months
[1:16:33] before to be on that
[1:16:36] spot and stand there and saying go down
[1:16:40] there three times with them and I just
[1:16:45] walked on with the other
[1:16:48] men because there was two hunting
[1:16:51] groups and the older brother
[1:16:55] insisted brother brandham come with
[1:16:58] me let the young boys go on their
[1:17:01] own and the vision passed right through
[1:17:07] exactly God's part and I was left
[1:17:12] standing brother Eddie bisc gives the
[1:17:16] testimony I believe he was one of those
[1:17:18] young
[1:17:20] boys and that mammoth
[1:17:25] the young boys found it they saw
[1:17:29] it and brother brandom and the vision
[1:17:31] was supposed to have gone with the young
[1:17:35] boys and that's where he would kill the
[1:17:38] bear but the other brother convinced him
[1:17:41] to go with
[1:17:45] him and he wasn't on that
[1:17:48] spot where God told him to
[1:17:50] be three
[1:17:53] times he said
[1:17:55] and he he was telling me six months
[1:17:58] before to be on that
[1:18:01] spot and stand there and
[1:18:04] saying go down there three times with
[1:18:09] them and
[1:18:11] I just walked on with the other
[1:18:15] men and the vision passed right through
[1:18:20] exactly God's part he did it didn't
[1:18:25] fail and I was left
[1:18:29] standing so we want to go right with the
[1:18:36] word and it will bring you out all right
[1:18:39] I'm
[1:18:44] sure the purpose of these
[1:18:48] hunts these
[1:18:49] Trophies the ones that God told
[1:18:52] him thus sayth the Lord
[1:18:55] you're going to kill a
[1:18:57] Grizzly kill
[1:18:59] aibou you're going to kill this gigantic
[1:19:02] brown
[1:19:05] bear a prophet told
[1:19:07] us God did his
[1:19:10] part and he told me three
[1:19:12] times where to go and who to go with and
[1:19:17] I didn't do
[1:19:19] it God did his part and I was left
[1:19:24] standing
[1:19:28] Vision
[1:19:32] fulfilled when he saw the vision it was
[1:19:35] thus sayith the
[1:19:37] Lord and when he told us that he that he
[1:19:40] missed
[1:19:41] it he did the wrong
[1:19:44] things isn't that th sayith the
[1:19:47] Lord then it's
[1:19:49] fulfilled it's
[1:19:51] done but this Vision it passed him
[1:19:56] up he failed to be where he was supposed
[1:19:59] to
[1:20:02] be it was a
[1:20:04] lesson that God was teaching
[1:20:07] him if I tell you to be in a certain
[1:20:11] spot and you fail to do
[1:20:14] that I kep my
[1:20:18] part but you must keep
[1:20:21] yours obedience to the word
[1:20:25] said entitles
[1:20:29] us to the
[1:20:32] Token obedience to the

[1:21:36] okay but Sarah laughed and God didn't
[1:21:40] even see a little
[1:21:42] grin because he's Hebrews
[1:21:44] 4:12 a discerner of the intense of the
[1:21:50] heart from heaven above from the throne
[1:21:53] he sees us
[1:21:55] he sees you when you laugh he sees you

[1:22:19] are a language he
[1:22:22] understands so when you cry out to him
[1:22:26] before you say a
[1:22:27] word he knows your
[1:22:30] need your
[1:22:31] desire oh and he's sweeping down to come
[1:22:34] down and comfort
[1:22:38] you Sarah laughed sah but she was really
[1:22:43] crying Genesis
[1:22:46] 18:13 and the Lord said unto
[1:22:51] Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh
[1:22:58] saying shall I of assurity bear a child
[1:23:01] who I'm
[1:23:05] old God was not Discerning her
[1:23:10] condition as a Stern
[1:23:14] rebuke he was telling
[1:23:17] Abraham my daughter is
[1:23:21] discouraged she's poor in spirit
[1:23:24] all her senses are telling her it's too
[1:23:28] late and that there's nothing she can do
[1:23:31] about
[1:23:32] it she's feeling
[1:23:35] helpless feeling
[1:23:37] broken feeling
[1:23:39] ashamed but it wasn't too late for
[1:23:43] God verse
[1:23:45] 14 is anything too hard for the
[1:23:49] Lord at the time
[1:23:52] appointed I will return unto to thee
[1:23:55] according to the time of
[1:23:58] life and Sarah shall have a
[1:24:00] son the Lord with a promise so
[1:24:05] close was reminding
[1:24:09] them even in their present
[1:24:13] condition
[1:24:14] blessed are the poor
[1:24:18] Spirits when you let
[1:24:20] me have full control
[1:24:24] of your
[1:24:27] situation verse
[1:24:30] 15 then Sarah
[1:24:34] denied saying I laugh
[1:24:38] not many of
[1:24:40] us were asked a strong
[1:24:44] question and we say no that's not how
[1:24:47] I'm
[1:24:51] feeling the reaction
[1:24:55] comes because we know our hearts are
[1:24:56] being
[1:25:00] discerned and we're
[1:25:03] afraid we're afraid
[1:25:06] people we are
[1:25:09] afraid that people will think we're not
[1:25:12] as strong as we want them to
[1:25:20] think and he
[1:25:22] said n but thou did did is
[1:25:27] laugh that would be the first
[1:25:30] time that this woman pour in
[1:25:33] spirit laughed and now we know that that
[1:25:38] laughter was full of
[1:25:40] fear now we know that that laugh was a
[1:25:42] laugh of
[1:25:46] defeat now we know that that laugh was a
[1:25:48] laugh saying I don't know what to do
[1:25:51] next
[1:25:55] but you know what it would not be the
[1:25:57] last
[1:25:59] time that Sarah
[1:26:01] laughed turn with me to Genesis
[1:26:05] 21 beginning at verse
[1:26:11] one
[1:26:13] Perfection through a restored
[1:26:17] friendship with the father and the
[1:26:20] father had descended in Genesis 18
[1:26:24] let Abraham and Sarah
[1:26:27] know fear not I come as a
[1:26:33] friend trust
[1:26:35] me I'm the creator of heavens and
[1:26:40] earth verse one of Genesis
[1:26:43] 21 and the Lord visited Sarah as he had
[1:26:48] said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he
[1:26:51] had spoken
[1:26:54] for Sarah
[1:26:56] conceived and be Abraham a son in his
[1:26:59] old
[1:27:01] age at the set time of which God had
[1:27:04] spoken to
[1:27:06] them and Abraham called the name of his
[1:27:09] son that was born unto him whom Sarah
[1:27:12] born to him
[1:27:17] Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son
[1:27:20] Isaac being 8 days old as God had
[1:27:23] commanded
[1:27:28] him and Abraham was 100 years old when
[1:27:31] his son Isaac was born unto
[1:27:36] him and Sarah said God had made me to
[1:27:42] laugh so that all that hear will laugh
[1:27:45] with
[1:27:47] me and not at me
[1:27:54] the first time she
[1:27:56] laughed full of
[1:27:59] fear she says
[1:28:01] Abraham everybody's laughing at
[1:28:05] me I'm tired of people laughing at
[1:28:08] me I'm tired of people blaming me for
[1:28:13] everything but
[1:28:15] now Sarah
[1:28:17] said God have made me to
[1:28:20] laugh something that happened in This
[1:28:22] Woman's life

[1:28:31] her she was born

[1:28:46] laugh so that all that hear will laugh
[1:28:49] with
[1:28:51] me and not at me
[1:28:54] and she said who would have said unto
[1:28:56] Abraham that Sarah should have given
[1:28:59] children suck verse

[1:35:13] somebody remember in the
[1:35:16] beginning Kan had a
[1:35:19] revelation that he could kill for his
[1:35:21] God
[1:35:23] but Abel's
[1:35:25] Revelation he was only willing to die
[1:35:28] for his
[1:35:30] God and Jesus said here blessed was
[1:35:36] Abel for his
[1:35:38] meekness that he was only willing to die
[1:35:41] for
[1:35:44] me and because of that he will inherit
[1:35:48] the
[1:35:51] earth the weakened cist
[1:35:55] inherit the
[1:35:57] earth not the not the
[1:36:00] killers not the warriors with swords and
[1:36:03] guns and
[1:36:05] bombs if they don't repent of that
[1:36:10] nature they will
[1:36:12] inherit a lake of
[1:36:15] fire but blessed are the meek Jesus
[1:36:19] said like
[1:36:21] Abel better yet
[1:36:24] like Jesus for they shall inherit the
[1:36:28] earth
[1:36:30] meekness is not
[1:36:32] weakness for without

[1:36:53] church age Angel to the to the Ephesian
[1:36:59] Church a pastor he pastored this
[1:37:01] Ephesian
[1:37:04] Church Paul unfolded the five full
[1:37:08] ministry in his ministry on the
[1:37:12] earth and in verse 16 he
[1:37:15] said this I say then walk in the
[1:37:19] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[1:37:22] lust of the flesh
[1:37:27] for the flesh lusteth against the
[1:37:31] spirit and the spirit against the
[1:37:33] Flesh and these are contrary the one to
[1:37:36] the
[1:37:39] other so that they cannot do the things
[1:37:42] that you
[1:37:44] would but if ye be led of the
[1:37:47] spirit you are not under the
[1:37:51] law now the works of the flesh are
[1:37:56] manifest in other words Paul said in
[1:37:58] verse 18 if you are led by the
[1:38:02] spirit you are not under the
[1:38:05] law what will the law bring
[1:38:08] us Paul said I'm glad you asked that
[1:38:12] question because now I'm going to tell
[1:38:14] you what are the works of the
[1:38:16] law and what the law will bring to
[1:38:20] you if you're a
[1:38:22] legalist in this
[1:38:24] message this is what you will
[1:38:28] manifest if you don't repent now the
[1:38:31] works of the flesh verse
[1:38:35] 19 which are these adultery

[1:39:08] past that they which do such
[1:39:12] things in this so-called
