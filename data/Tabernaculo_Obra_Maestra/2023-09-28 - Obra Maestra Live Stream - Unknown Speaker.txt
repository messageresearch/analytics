evening time good to be back in the house of the Lord good to see you all here also where two or three are gathered in my name there shall I be also and we certainly believe it because we've experienced it in our lives he's always been with us he promised to be in us he made these promises and he's kept his promises so how can we but keep believing him and holding to his word uh can I talked to my sister earlier today about two or three weeks ago she had had a real bad earache and she finally went into the doctor and they told her that she had a staph infection called MRSA in her ear canal so merca is a very um I'll have to say it's a very deadly bacteria and she doesn't like going to the doctor I think she refers death to go to the doctor but she was feeling real bad and that's when they she went to the doctor and this doctor told her that that's what she had yeah yeah and they've given her several different antibiotics nothing was working and I believe it was yesterday she went to an ear specialist and the doctor looked there he said well you do have a lot of infection so she was very happy and uh and we're grateful to God and the time will come but when we all have our time that God calls us home but as human beings we all fight for life also it's a very natural instinct we fight for life that's right when we get sick it might not be something very Grievous and yet we're looking for something that will help us and that's just the natural yes but God has provided for us in the Supernatural Divine Healing for the body and Divine Healing is the first fruits yes it's the first fruits of a promise that God has made us because as many times as God could heal this flesh body the Bible still tells us that flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of God our hope is a promise of God when this body of clay this vessel this Earthly house be dissolved he says I've already prepared for you a house not made from by hand it it'll it'd be it'll be just like stepping out of one house and stepping into another our eyes see a body stretched in a coffins [Music] God sees a man or a woman taking one more step from time into eternity yes tonight for a title on a Wednesday night I'd like to entitlement darkness is fast and True Light now shyness and for a subject I have a house not made with hands first John chapter 2. verse seven and eight and it reads like this as you return in your Bibles first John chapter 2. brethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which she had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which we have heard from the beginning again a new commandment I write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the True Light now shines True Light truly has Shine for us and it's made the Bible a new book and all the Loose Ends they've been put together turn to Second Corinthians verses one through four second Corinthians verses one through four and verse one reads like this for we know that of our Earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God can house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might swallow up might be swallowed up of Life Heavenly Father we thank you once [Music] Lord if it pleased then may you be pleased to come down and speak to our hearts we ask all this in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated second Corinthians 5 verse 1 said for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens is this house not made with hands is your Celestial body it's also called your theophany in First Corinthians 15 verses 39 and 40. it reads like this all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh amen another flesh of Peace another of fishes and another of birds there are also celestial bodies embodies but the glory of the celestial and the glory of the terrestrials First Corinthians 2.9 but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him there's a principle in God's word that we must hold in our hearts as we speak on the subject of a Celestial body before we have one it's called a theophany it's a supernatural body it's not natural at all and and he says this principle in God's word as we speak on this and our loved ones who have died in Christ in Genesis 1 and [Music] the Earth brought forth grass verse 12 Genesis 1. and Herb building seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good is and as you would keep reading you'd see the principle in Genesis is let every seed produce after its own kind of even even the word of God that created everything when God said in the beginning Let There Be lies it was a seed that brought that forth and the seed that brought that commandment forward for the spoken word was the original scene that birthed an entire world so everything that was set in God's word came forth from a seed even the light you might say well Adam was spoken into creation by God's spoken words yes and god-spoken word so there is a Supernatural seed there's a natural seed in second Corinthians chapter four number 16. Paul says for which cause we faint not but but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day important verse 17 of second Corinthians 4 for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory moment then he says here while we look not at the things which are seen that takes a born-again Believer to see to look at that because unless you're being because Paul had had an experience and Out of Body Experience he said he went into the third heaven he said he saw things that that that that no man could see he went beyond the curtain of time he says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved and it is possible Perfection is possible perfectionist promise and we all had the same beginning blessed is the porn Spirit when the world has beat you down but in your heart you say I don't want to live like this no more you take one step out of the pit and you take another step out of the peace so just as the inward man is renewed cuerto like you see here it didn't always look this way because this is the body of death and it develops and and one spiritual you know spiritual and the spiritual yeah Supernatural is developing a body as we look upon each other but as Believers in Christ that the body you're looking at with your eyes is not the body that's growing the body you're looking at with your eyes soul I saw [Music] and as you all know it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so if in the beginning it all began with the seeds and every seed produced of its kind and then if the soul in you be the seed of God it will produce a son and daughter of God even our soul so it's my desire to show our theophany our celestial bodies that begins and keep in mind the spoken words sometimes closer then we can even feel it they don't have to think about it I don't know if you've ever seen a sheep that's been sheared and when you see them it's like pulling a turtle out of the shell so they got a tiny little body little little gangly legs and the sheep look the same when they're sheared and they take all their walls they're one-fourth the size of what they were before but they're not worried they'll never have wool again it's something within them that produces the world they don't even have to think about it they just have to eat foods and if the Believers it's nothing but cheap food it will produce every promise of God in your life foreign [Music] spiritually speaking the soul is a seed and remember some is sweet seeds it was the voice of Jesus some are children of God and some are children of saint remember the Prince Jesus revealed it in Matthew 13. verses 24 to 30. turn with me there to Matthew 13. and it reads like this okay therefore speak I to them in parables because they see not and hearing they hear not foreign do they understand the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and see and you shall see and shall not proceed yes well there's people's heart is wax gross and their ears are full of our dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes here with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them is God blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they here in in verse in verse 24 universities Jesus says again another Parable putting forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field and you'll remember the revelation of this here in the parable the son of man was Jesus Christ verse 25 but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat is [Music] verse 26 but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the servants from the householder came and said unto him sir did us not thou so good seed in thy field from whence then hath that tears he said an enemy has done this the servant said unto him without them that we go and gather them up while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with him let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gathering together for stairs bind them in bundles to burn them foreign but gather the wheat into my barn yes there are two seeds the children of God the children of satanas and both have a soul because that soul is the seed in them but not every seed is a son and daughter of God not every seed is as in the as in the third Epistle of John where John and his epistle he says was of that evil one a son of the serpenter so they're children of God As We Are Tonight but in this city there are many men and women who are children of satanic when you wonder how men and women can do such Wicked and horrible things it's because that's the seed there is the nature that they have of their father the devil Diablo okay Matthew 10 28. the scriptures tells us and fear not them which killed the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body and in hell that reveals to us not every soul has eternal life many will be destroyed in a lake of fire the children of the wicked one the tears are deformed by the very nature of the Soul so foreign degeneration of vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell um so they will they will come to an end their nature will take them to the place of being eternally separated but the child of God the soul of a child of God will grow by entering into an invisible Union with the father called The born-again Experience man Jesus Christ where the father mentors May the Holy Spirit even tonight's disciple in you Jesus is tutoring you to live a life and he was here in a flesh and he mortified the Deeds of the flesh call us Born Again experience listen to Paul in Ephesians speaking on the born-again experience Ephesians chapter 2 Paul speaking on that Born Again experience and you hathy quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein time pass you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind can War by Nature the children of that wrath even as others by nature of the natural seed of our fathers and mothers Earthly fathers and mothers but laying within us that's really you okay that's the one that's part of God well verse verse 3 among whom also we all had our conversation and time passed in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and where by Nature the children of Wrath even as others who is rich in Mercy for his great love forwith he loved us because he looked down inside of you and you saw you were sweet like he said to Jeremiah the prophet I ordained you a prophet to the nation and before you were in your mother's womb I already knew you yes that's what makes you a son and daughter but not every seed is sweet is not every seed have God for their fathers some have Lucifer Lucifer for their father it's a Bible truth it can be followed from Genesis to Revelations even when we were dead in sins Grace you are born again now even satanas the soul allows the human being to be a free moral agent [Music] that's why Lucifer could choose to get lifted up above God himself that's why Judas Iscariot could choose to sell Jesus for the 30s pieces of silver that's why job could say though you slay me yet will I trust you we all had a soul but they did not have the same father because the seed wasn't from the same father one is a seed of God one is the seed of the serpenters hmm so even Satan has a soul but not every soul will produce that's been formed in the image of God foreign when Lazarus died the Bible says Angels came down and picked them and took him into the arms of Abraham to The Fifth Dimension there are seven dimensions the fourth dimension is the dimension of a radio TV internet television all these all this this cyber waves traveling through the air is a place the Bible calls hell that was created for the devil [Music] that's why when Jesus died his body laid in the grave for three days but the nature of God this very soon spirit of God rose up and the Bible tells the Apostle Paul tells us that he went to hell the 50 mentions right on the cross it was laid in the Tomb the spirit of God raised up went to this fifth Dimensions Paul said he said to preach to souls that were in prison and to go to the other side of this Fifth Dimension and take all the old new Old Testament sayings and give them a born-again baptism of the Holy ghosts you raise up to a higher demand [Music] but they couldn't cross over they each had a body no longer an Earthly one the rich men now had a body that could suffer in flames of torments and not be consumed waiting for Judgment Day and Lazarus now had a body that was no longer in torment and hunger but living in Paradise with Abraham and all the saints it was two different kinds of bodies okay so principle number one let every seed produce of its own kindness principle number two Jesus Christ Jesus Christ it's the same yesterday in a series brother Brandon preached called Hebrews chapter 2. he said this it was outstanding he said now when Adam came into that body the body that God had made for him he had control of all the fishes and fowls and beasts of the fields and there was no man to till the soil because you remember he first made man in Genesis 1 26 and he made a spirit man [Music] 126. and then God said there's no man to till the soil because uh because a flesh man doesn't have hands and feet and fingers so in Genesis 2 he had made them male and female but there was no man to till the soil and God made Man Out of the Dust of the Earth is and it's made out of the same kind of material your body is just the same kind of material as a horse or a dog anything like that in other words it's made out of it's made out of the 16 elements from the earth calcium potash Cosmic light petroleum is so so All Flesh like that it's not the same flesh it's different flesh but it's made out of the Dust of the Earth where it comes from but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animals because the soul that was in the man is that the orphanage is because the soul that is in the man is that the office we develop you see we develop from a seed called the soul and we develop develop into the full stature called our theophysics just another word for a Celestial body the veil and the Darkness that the Apostle Paul spoke of keeps us from knowing it because you see we were born in spiritual Amnesia but the new birth awakens us and the Holy Ghost baptism places your spiritual adoption and God begins to restore to you control over this flesh body uh in measures in Medina little by little one step at a time God helps you overcome your struggles yes I do that uh that's what the refillings of the Holy Spirit are about it's the sovereign operio can you imagine what he felt like when he lost it we were born in that lost condition but now God's taking us back giving us dominion over this place oh Hallelujah Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound save the rich life I once was lost because of loud I'm blind but now I see Adam from he had it from day one overcoming power and lost it we developed from a seed on the inner man called the soul and we develop into the full stature of a Celestial body just like Jesus one day we'll all live together in eternity and we'll have the same kind of body as our heavenly father it's the end goal it's where he was taking Adam and Eve you see Satan's Soul his nature was wicked and crooked from his beginning it was the same nature that was in the serpenter they're in Genesis 3. Lucifer entice he enticed to bring the fall of God's children the serpente God made it the serpent was a creation God's a Creator Lucifer was a creation God's the Creator he made them both like he made you an eye and in job 26 and verse 12. it tells us job 26 and verse 12. it says he divided the sea with his power and by his understanding he smiteth the proud by his Spirit he has garnished the heavens his hand hath formed the Crooked serpents job wasn't speaking about about every snake on planet Earth he is by his Spirit speaking of God he has garnished the heavens based on these two principles yes Ezekiel 18 and verse 1. the word of the Lord came unto me again saying what mean ye that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge as I live saith the Lord God you shall not have occasion anymore to use this proverb in Israel So what had been said hundreds of years before God was beginning to annoy things because he was moving from an old Covenant from an Old Testament to show us really who we are to bring us back into his presence as I live saith the Lord God you shall not have occasion anymore to use this behold All Souls are mine [Music] the soul is not Eternal unless you're a Son of God unless you're a daughter can a soul be destroyed like a flesh yes see but only God can destroy the souls will our human Spirit be destroyed will our human Spirit also be destroyed yes because because yes it is because of this human spirit that we have the sinner's struggle and the soul and the spirit wrestle together that's the greatest battle we fight in our hearts and minds and the soul is born again since I gave my heart to Jesus seems like the battle is greater than ever it's because it's because God has quickened you before you didn't fight the battle the devil just put a string around your neck and took you where he was breathe the things you didn't want to do no more but now you've been born again and you're telling the devil no no I'm not going there no more I'm not watching those movies I'm not listening to that music anymore Hebrews and verse 12. the Apostle Paul a great prophet of God he said for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to divide in asunder of soul and spiritu the human Spirit and the seed of God and of the joints and morals and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents Deuteronomy chapter five Moses says thou shall not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me nothing he didn't say he would visit the iniquity of the fathers and of the children of all ah until their third and fourth generation only of those that hate him and those that hate him yeah it's a generation the children of Lucifer verse 10. and showing Mercy come to thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments that's those that love him are the generation of Jesus Christ two different seeds a seed that loves him because that's their father hates him they have another father but was Israel under the law the generation of Jesus Christ hmm did you know that that Israel under the law the generation of Jesus Christ even in the old testamento it's in the Bible and God's teaching us how to read the Bible differently we're not we're not reading it no more to be able to say uh I read three books of the Bible this morning before going to work how many did you read it doesn't matter how many I read how many he read if we read without Revelation but God wants to reveal his word to us Israel under the law there was those of them that were the generation of Jesus Christ Matthew chapter 1 and verse it says this the book of the generation of Jesus Christ son of David the son of Abraham Israel Israel to Jewish men but what made them the generation of Jesus Christ what made them the very Gene of God that they're Souls they were Sons and Daughters All Souls are mine saith the Lord and I'll judge them as individuals because some are mine and all that the father has given I'm not losing one of them but what if you're not the fathers then God said there's a lake of fire for the seed of the serpenter the children of satanas General in Matthew 13. 36 to 38. share it once again Matthew 13 36. then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field yes the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked ones clearer no place and yet the teachings of the seed of the surface from Genesis to Revelations [Music] fight against it so hard no God wants everyone to be saved okay he does is he looking the Bible says that he gave his life on the curse of Calvary and whomsoever will come yeah but only his children will come surrender their lives to Jesus Christ you see he's given us the soul gives us free moral agencies it allows each and every one of us to choose between right and wrong yes good and bad hot or cold God gave you the right to choose because you have a soul you have that privilege but many because they're of a different seed they will only produce of their own the seed will only produce of its own kindness you cannot plant an apple seed and be angry when it comes up an orange tree when someone told you this is an apple seed brother Daniel is and if I treat it real nice maybe when it grows it'll give me oranges because I like orange is better than Apple it won't ever give me orange it won't ever give me what I what I foreign go act like God who will live like Jesus Christ but not a sin of the serpent you can never get him in the name of Jesus it's not in him but it is in you because you're a son and daughter where is it is it now living waiting somewhere even as the flesh body it begins as a as a super as a seed Supernatural remember a principle Jesus Christ yesterday today and foreign Genesis 1 11. and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so this was that was Botanical life verse 21 and God created great whales and every living creature that moves which the waters brought forth abundance after their kind and every winged foul after his kindness and God saw that it was good the trees produce after their income the whales the birds are they all produce after their own kinds and God said let the Earth bring forth verse 24 the living creatures after his kind cattle creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good and when a child is born and it's born a man it's born a male [Music] trying to destroy God's children but God's children won't be destroyed God's children live by revelations and there are two kinds one comes from the Tree of Life and one comes from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil one is a generation one is a generation of Jesus Christ in the message called adoption I'd like to read this is the naval was wandered wandered about it if I'd pass by I'd see a little Cloud floating by a spirit and say there goes brother and sister Charlie and Nelly and that's brother and sister Spencer going there that always puzzled me if my eyes are in the grave decaying and rotting if my ears is not here to hear anymore and if my blood has all gone back and they've embalmed it and it's in the waters or in the ground and my mental faculties my brain cells are all gone and then how would I be any more than just a spirit floating around can that worried me how would I like to say hello brother Pat or glad to see you brother Neville well how I'd like to see it but I thought well if I don't have anything to see with candy mouth to speak with it's rotten in the dust how would I able to say hello brother Pat hello brother sister brother Neville or hello Charlie but now I know that's wrong for it's written in the scriptures which as I say it's not contrary for if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting another Tabernacle that has eyes ears lips faculties if this Earthly Tabernacle will be dissolved it has a body that can feel that can talk and now it comes to me just now that Moses had been dead in an unmarked grave for 800 years and Elijah had went to heaven 500 years before but on Mount Transfiguration they were both found talking with Jesus is Celestia it's a real body it resembles this this Earthly one only far better in this body is you'll see farther you'll speak nicer in this body better in this celestial bodies God said he's provided a kingdom a Heavenly Kingdom right he said he'll cleanse us the Bible says the seat of the serpents Ephesians 2 and verse 1. um and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins that's a supernatural quickening The born-again Experience that's that's that's that soul that was Lane dormant that has been revived and you're not the same anymore you don't have the same desires for the things of this world you've been quickened when you were once dead in trespasses and sins you've been quickened now you'll never be the same you're walking in his presence we're in in times past he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh and the children of Disobedience but that spirit's no longer working in you because you've been born again among whom also we had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and where by Nature the children of Wrath even as others foreign and by Grace you are saved and had raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus Jesus for by grace through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God we're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ God gave you a gift every believer every son and daughter it's about if I'm not mistaken it's about the size of a mustard cheese and it places another seat growing down in the soul because that's what the soul needed to grow that's what every son and daughter God needs to grow we didn't have it because faith is a revelation so when we were born again when we repented and give our lives to Jesus faith in our hearts it is the gift of God remember Peter in the day of Pentecost they rose up and said men and Brethren Hombres what can we do to be saved Peter said repentance the gift of the Holy Ghost people thought it was speaking in tongues but that gift of God that Peter spoke of it and Paul here identified is Faith placed within us because when faith is laying down in the soul and that Faith seed begins to grow yeah that's when you become planet Earth a manifested son and daughter of God and the world sees have changed and you can tell them not only have I changed I'm going on to be like Jesus verse 9 not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship in other words when you've been born again God is working on you now where is workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God be which which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them Paul was telling us in simple language this Earthly body is shaped in iniquity we come into this world speaking lives it is the supernatural seed of God it's the very Gene of Jesus Christ it's what makes you and I the generation of Jesus Christ that's why David and Abraham what made them the generations for in it begins as the very attribute of God that means you are in his thoughts long before you are manifested in this Earth You are in the thoughts of God then you were born into this world and God places the attributes the supernatural seeds his DNA instead in a flesh body but remember flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of God yes because and God's coming back your attribute that means you're in his thoughts then you're born into this world a supernatural and it remains dormant until the light of the pillar of fires and the reign of the Holy Spirit Waters it and then you are born and the son or daughter of God on the inside begins to grow okay I still have two and a half hours more but I'm going to cut it short I'm going to make a statement first the soul and the man is that the orphanage is but random said but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man and he didn't put that in the animals because the soul that was in the man is so when you're born again it's God giving his child control you don't have to yield to the to the to the things of the flesh no more you now have the power to say no that doesn't please my Lord this seed this is and through the three steps the soul will development the control grows it's not total control for Adam came first and there was no evil carne Adam went through a body change Ken was in full control only for a season we are born out of control but through a born-again experience God starts taking us from this body of Flesh to a Celestial body and every step we take towards he gives us more control like that Jesus Jesus was never a problem child problematico because the seed had nothing to do with Mary or Joseph the seed that birth Jesus was the spoken word so in that body was no evil because that body is [Music] wrinkles because he was going to ask the father to take your place and become your sins could be his righteousness Jesus came through Immaculate Birth by the spoken word the original the Child Jesus Jesus I've said it before was not connected to Mary Maria because then the Blood of Mary and the Blood of Mary natural would have contaminated the body of Christ with sinful mankind pecadora and I've been asked then how in the world could the body have grown in marriage and my answer has always been I'll tell you how it got there yes and you tell me how it lived it got there through the spoken words [Music] and how did it live if it wasn't connected to Mary Maria by the spoken word it was an original series like Adam and Adam grew yeah and was a man and was never connected my first Adam too was a spoken word um but the first Adam the second Adam didn't fail no for you there has nothing to do with a man it's a personal experience between you and trusted and Jesus Christ he had an Immaculate birth so he could give you one he had an Immaculate birth and lived in a flesh body is a supernatural Born Again of Jesus Christ foreign Matthew 1 23. just behold the Virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us this is Jesus Christ foreign but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and to your father and to my God and your God Jesus now do you see what you had to be born again and if you haven't now do you see why you must be born again as Paul said we lived in sin but the soul in you that laid dormant was quickened by the Holy Ghost that's when you became a new Creator the soul is the seed then what will the seed produce a body what kind of body the same kind because thank you for coming excuse me for taking extra long but but just know this I wasn't finished and I could have taken longer but God rich in mercies let's pray heavenly father
