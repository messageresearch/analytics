amen God bless you all this morning the name of Jesus it's what lifted us it's what's picked us up it's what's giving us healing for our bodies and healing for our minds and we're thankful thankful to God for all of them this morning uh I want to pray for prayer although all the saints that are out visiting vacation traveling sister carmender in Mexico I think Esther's also with her um I'm going to remember them in prayer there where they're at and I also want to remember our brother Jonathan um this morning brother Jonathan is kind of an Ellie easer only he's not getting a bride for Isaac he's going to get his own bride and pick her up and he may be gone for I think it was the 17th was the actual date but he said they had many things they had to do prior I think medical tests and I'm not sure what else they had to take care of and everything and uh so Lord willing when all that's done and complete when he returns uh he'll be here with his little family his little daughter um and uh we want to kind of get together with them and have a little a little celebration a little Feast with them all brother Jonathan to give his wife and the girl up a little welcoming fiestas we would say and when they get back here Lord willing and just plan a little something for all of them there I also wanted to announce uh September the 9th and September the 10th we'll be having a visiting brother and uh and a good friend of mine brother Rafael Cabello that's September 9th and 10th it's a Saturday and Sunday whether Rafael Cabellas from uh Congo Africa Congo brazzaville they call it if you don't know there's actually two Congos two countries called Congo and one is just Congo and the other one is the Democratic Republic of Congo and the brothers when they refer to the Congo they're from they say I'm from Congo brazzaville where I'm from Congo kinchasa which is the capitals of those two countries so our brother Rafael is from Congo brazzaville and he has a church there that he's pastored for for many years and he just uh maybe less than a month ago he sent me some videos that they're building a new church and uh it's I don't know it's it's Warehouse size just as the videos were we were showing the videos of How It's coming along I guess they could probably see five six thousand people or more and uh he used to have a small church when he first started pastoring it was a church of about I think it was a thousand or fifteen hundred people and uh that's considered a small Church in Congo a modest congregation uh other brothers that we know there brother Richard nioka they have a Congregation of maybe ten thousand people seven thousand another brother that's in Congo kinchasa also Cabella uh has it one of them has a church of about 15 000 people and when you look at the churches they're they're warehouse warehouse size and usually when you see the videos you'll you'll see all the sisters are set on one side and and all the brothers are sat on another side and one of the reasons they do that is so they can pack them in tighter into the into the service so it's not a when you see it it's not some kind of a strange Doctrine or anything they have no it's it's for the purpose of being able to sit everyone a little closer and without it being inconvenient or awkward for the Brothers and Sisters in Christ but so brother Cabello be here he has always kept in touch with me for many years since he first came can we visit it he stayed in our home and we took the time to take him a few places and we have a friendship together that is has remained and so he uh he is in Dallas Texas he's been there for a few weeks has a daughter that's there and and he sent me some some texts and sent me the videos and he let me know I he was going to be in town till about September 13th before he leaves again so um I said wonderful have a great time in Dallas and I sent him a text to WhatsApp and and uh a couple of days later the Lord just put in my heart well he's here until September 13th um why not invite and I called up and invited him and and he's and he said and he tells me well I let you know how long I would be here just in case you wanted to invite me he said well I said but just in case it's come up we do wish to invite you and have you come down and share with us the word of God experiences and in the past in pastoring and what God puts whatever God would put on your heart so September the 9th and September the 10th as we get closer we'll give you the times the Sunday will not be a regular time that we start all the time and perhaps Saturday we'll start a little early maybe about six o'clock and you're certainly welcome to invite any and all that that you would like to invite for these for these Services I'm sure the brother does speak English he can communicate and have a conversation with you in English I don't know that he'll preach in English but but uh if not then I'm sure he'll have a a lot of brothers are living in Phoenix that that also knows in our cups the relatives of his wife that couldn't interpret I mean I'm sure you all remember brother Joshua mukabe that spoke for us a while back when I was when I was unable to him and uh I believe brother Joshua that's his brother-in-law isn't it so brother Joshua Bay is his brother-in-law in heed a very good interpreter from French French to English I asked Josh if he wanted to interpret for him uh French to English or French to Spanish but he hasn't told me yet that he wants to so I'm assuming that he doesn't want to even try so but uh we're thankful for all what God does for us we're thankful for for friends uh like brother Rafael we're thankful this morning for all of you that are here present the Bible says where two or three are gathered in my name there shall I be also so we're believing that this morning and uh I'm gonna turn here to we'll stand to our feet this morning we'll be reading from The Book of John John chapter 10. we'll read verses 1 to 7. and it's a lengthy subject this morning but we won't be lengthy this morning because we'll probably speak on this subject for for some time and uh I believe I spoke a little bit on it in the past and much what much of what will be saying here is things that I've said to you often and repeat often and I do that for the purpose of of it sparking an interest in your lives and hearts that when you get home um you'll start searching the word of God it's not so much the things that I'll say to you here but but it's the earnest desire to get into the word when you get home that's where you'll reap Revelation far beyond that I could share with you I'm sharing with you my Revelation my understanding but know this that and I know this that God has more Revelation understanding for you in your personal time with him that I could ever give you but what he has called me to do is to give you something to spark that interest in the word of God Beyond any other thing any other music or book or any thing that that interests you that this interest of the word to prepare our lives for rapturing Faith would be the greatest motivating factor in our lives as Believers in Christ because if you're in the word now and God is changing you from the inside out then the easiest change and the easiest thing you'll ever go through in life is a body change because you'll be ready when he calls you you won't think twice and we're gone Saint John chapter 10. verses one through seven it says this barely verily and I say unto you he that interest and not by the door into the Sheepfold but climeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the Sheep so in this Parable in verse 1 it sounds like it's talking about just the common lay member but let's read it again verse one it's merely verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold where the Sheep are at are a pasture for the Sheep to feed but climeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that enters by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep verse 2 reveals to us something about verse one and that is this thief and this robber that Jesus is speaking of is not the lay members not the Sheep it's the Shepherds Shepherds that are thieves and robbers because they come in the wrong way they don't come in through the door so he's speaking to the ministry here Pharisees scribes pastors evangelists that's a verse two reveals it but here that enters him by the door is The Shepherd of the Sheep to him to him the porter openeth who's the porter the father God the Father who is this Shepherd the chief Shepherd Jesus Christ he's speaking to ministry here not just the late members but he's a to him the porter God open it can the sheep hear his voice in other words the porter the father allows the shepherd to enter into his pasture into enters Green Fields enter into the open book enter into the revelation of these Seven Seals to him the border openeth and the sheep hear his voice can he calleth his own Sheep by name and leave them out and when he puteth forth his own sheep he goes before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice can a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strange Ministries this Parable it was a parable so in this things that he was speaking is a mystery hidden this Parable Jesus spoke unto him but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them because that was the purpose of the parable and reveal it unto babes such as Woodbury then said Jesus unto him again verily variation to you I am the door of the sheep I'm the shepherd I'm the door I'm the son of God follow me follow the lamb Don't Follow the Man let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning can we ask your blessings upon your word reveal it to us for we know you spoke everything in Parables for a purpose you even said at one time in Matthew 11 father I thank you that you have hidden these things from the eyes of wise and prudent and you've revealed it unto babes such as would learn that means it takes a born-again experience or we cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom of God we cannot see the opening of the word we cannot see the loosing of those Seven Seals and yet Seven Seals is just seven parts of one Divine Plan of Redemption to take us back into your presence to take us back to Eden can take us back and to where we can swap this life of time for a life eternal with you we thank you now bless the word for every heart in Jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated this morning just for a title The Pale Horse Rider in the Days of Elijah just as it was the white horse rider in the Days of Elijah so there was a white horse rider in the Days of Elijah and there was a pale horse rider in the Days of Elijah because there was there was in the opening of This Book of redemption this new testament two forerunners that were to come at the first coming of Christ and the second coming of Christ John the Baptist was this first Forerunner at the first coming of Christ the Elijah Jesus himself told us that in Matthew 11. the ain't the angel Gabriel spoke to Zachariah in Luke 1 and confirmed John the Baptist is the Elijah he's he's that Elijah of Malachi 3 he's also the first Elijah of Malachi 4 6. and Jesus confirmed that he was so in the days of this first Elijah Matthew 11 is where Jesus tells us that the white horse rider began his right that's where I get this thought that's where I get this Revelation with the pain that that the white horse rider began in the Days of Elijah it's Jesus himself that holds them can the pale horse rider began in the Days of Elijah but not John the Baptist the Elijah to the second coming of Christ a Prophet by the name of William Miriam Branham why because it's the pattern of God's word because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so if the white horse rider began in the days of Elijah's on the Baptist then when would the last writer begin in the Days of Elijah once again the same God doing the same things so his children can catch the same Revelation it is said that if you say the truth once you will have no problem saying it again and repeating it because you're because it's the truth and the truth can be said over and over again without any compromises in Revelations 5 it has been spoke much on it because for me it's a key scripture of this great Plan of Redemption we're told that Jesus Christ there in Revelations 5 open the book in the days of the Earthly Ministry and he did this throughout his Earthly Ministry and in Matthew 24 in a parable as Isaiah had prophesied and other scriptures tells us he loosed the Seven Seals Jesus Christ of Nazareth our Lord and savior in his Earthly Ministry he's the one that opened the book first and he's the one that loosed the Seven Seals Seven Seals seven parts to one Plan of Redemption to whom did he opened the book of redemption in the New Testament to Israel to the firstborn son he loosed the Seven Seals that means the Redemption plan was put in motion that's what it means that's what this book of this Seven Seals is all about brother Madam said that seven seal book it's not just the last book in the Bible it's the entire Bible it's the entire Bible that was sealed Isaiah even speaks of that book that was sealed and the Learned man said I cannot understand it it's clothed it's open and can the unlearned and ignorant said I can't understand it I can't read I can't write no one could understand it the prophets couldn't understand that God didn't give it but God rich in Mercy unfolding his word but even before Jesus loosed the Seven Seals in Matthew 24 he identifies in his day the beginning of that white horse rider in the opening of the first seal part one to take his family back to Eden to take his family back to the beginning before the fall to take his family where Adam and Eve were were being mentored by the father where they had a relationship like no other had ever had has ever had since and they fell from that close with the father but it's that but that's where God wants to take us back to that's where we're actually standing today by the revealed word of God we're standing in the same spot before the father like Adam and Eve being mentored being tutored the The Works that he did shall we do also and greater than these shall we you know he said because I go to the father and I come back as the Holy Spirit and it's by and and and by the Holy Spirit I can live in each and every one of you can be with you daily even with you and in you to the ends of the Earth So the plan of Eden God's original plan is back and forth enforced today in 2023 by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit that's amongst us when the lamb died was slain Revelations 5 you go back and read it can I saw a lamb as though it had been slain said it had seven horns it had seven eyes the Lamb of God where did God go from that spot he went back to Revelations one where John said can I seen one like unto the son of man walking in the midst of this seven candlesticks the sevens for changes in what form the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit the Son of God is what the holy spirit is called so brother Branham learned in his early Ministry that to see a vision come to pass it all the components of the vision must unfold they must be present even if it's just the last step maybe a hat being moved somewhere before he could pronounce the conclusion of that Vision before he could say thus saith the Lord you're healed can in a message wisdom versus Faith paragraph 33 is one of those places where brother Branham says this where he gives us more details is in the message where he tells us the importance of staying exactly with the vision because speaking of his own Ministry in the message God revealing himself to his people is where brother Brown speaks again Prince talks about an experience that he had where he got ahead of the vision and there were still lacking a hat that had to be moved from one spot in the in the room to another spot in the room he couldn't move it it had to be someone else that would walk in and do that and that was a sign that this is the moment this is the spot now you enter in and do the and and do the prophetic work and say thus saith the Lord she says got to be exactly with the vision and with that said we want to read in Revelations chapter six one and two again we did Wednesday and we'll do again now and it says this and I saw verse 1 revelation 6. and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it was the noise of thunder all symbols they all mean something one of the four be sane come and see it was to be a teaching for come and see it is not a rebuke come and see his is is not an Evangelistic message come and see just come and see something and you're going to learn this was a Teaching Ministry and in this Teaching Ministry the lamb had to be present the vision the vision says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals so the lamb must be present for this to come to pass then there was a noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying it was a teaching he was about to bring pertaining that day they were living in which one of the four beasts was present because it because because it says here in Revelation 6 2 and I saw him Behold a white horse and really six one I'm sorry and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four be saying come and see it was to be a teacher so which one of the four beasts was present because it doesn't tell us here in this scripture which one of the four beasts it was so then you have to go to another place in the Bible because the prophetic word something is spoken in this prophecy and something is spoken in this prophecy and something spoken this prophecy can you kind of blend them together with all the details to see this great Plan of Redemption if you stop with one scripture and put a period you're not really seeing anything it forces you to interpret that scripture then where do you place yourself if you're not a prophet to do so then you're bringing confusion to the people so so which one of the four beasts was present Revelations 4 gives us the order and it says Revelations 4 and verse 7 and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a cat can the third Beast had the face of a man can the fourth Beast with like a flying eagle so the lion must be present because he was the first and this was the first seal and this is the unfolding of the word and Jesus at the time of his characters coming was the lion of the tribe of Judah and he was the Lamb of God so both lion and lamb are present in this prophecy and and not only in the prophecy but in the reality when it comes to past lion and land must be present and yet lion and lamb were one man Jesus of Nazareth he was present so lion and lamb is a Ministry of one man and these four living creatures he's the ministry of one man Jesus Christ the son of man throughout seven Church ages the grave Holy Spirit these four living creatures is the ministry of Christ to his people throughout the ages for Redemption because part one had begun and part one was the Plan of Redemption put into motion so that you and I could be born again so true and I could be justified by faith so June I could be Sanctified by the spirit so June I could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you and I in great trials we go through could have a refilling of the Holy Spirit and as I shared before it formed the refilling of the holy spirit it's not a reward for being good that you did everything right the refilling of the holy spirit is power to overcome great trials you're going through in life because that's when you need the refilling that's when you're feeling empty Lord why me why is this trouble coming to me why does my car have to break and all four tires go flat what about the neighbor he's not even a believer nothing happens to him but it's God knowing you you you're you're you're you've been you're you're empty maybe you haven't been reading the word like you should maybe we haven't been praying like we should he knows you're kind of empty now but he wants to feel you he wants to give you a refilling because he's already given you the Holy Ghost it was already giving you a small measure in your cup now he sees the cups for going low he says I need to refill this person till this till the cup is overflowing he says you need to refill it we tell the angel go down and touch those four tires as they're going down I-17 it's 117 degrees refilling time of the Holy Spirit it's not a reward it's a need and he sees your name so Revelations The Lion and the lamb present verse 2 and I saw him Behold a white horse can he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him he went forth conquering and to conquer Revelation 6 1-2 was the vision that John thought was a future event when in fact the vision he was seeing of Revelation 6 1-2 was present tense and was happening even as he was seeing this vision and would continue to unfold for the next 300 years you see the mind of God in two verses of Revelation 6 1-2 in the mind of God was 300 years of unfolding of this vision and he was going to tell us a little bit at a time when was he going to tell us when the seven seal opened when the Elijah Ministry came when the pale horse rider began his ride he was going to this prophetic Ministry he was going to fill in all the details that were in the mind of God in these two verses of the opening of the first seal of part one of redemption to get you and I back into his presence not just here from time to time but eternally and forever so Revelation 6 1-2 was this Vision John thought was a future event when in fact it was present tense and happening as a matter of fact it started even before the Book of Revelations was written because before the Book of Revelations was written it was a spoken word and a plan in the mind of God it was present tense and was happening even as he was seeing the vision and would continue to unfold for the next 300 years because the first seal was from the church age of Ephesus all the way to perdimist part one the first seal covered three churches a prophet Senate who will touch it and share those quotes with a little later but it isn't one seal for church age no no that's not the way it is it's one living creep and even the living creatures travel with each one of those seals even the white horse rider so four seals really were unfolding throughout seven Church pages the firstborn and the first four writers rode the Antichrist throws seven through changes can the four living creatures from the minister the first The Pale Horse Rider and the horse riders were the ministry of Lucifer to try to to destroy the plan of God and God's children to give them eternal life because Satan the Bible says is a liar and a murderer from the beginning so here we have it 300 years this first seal this part one see Visions have a life span Revelations 5 when John saw it it had been unfolding for four thousand years and it has not expired it God still has a representation like a lamb slain forever interceding for our sins our healing our Salvation our joy our body change Revelation 6 is the vision but Matthew 11 is where the vision began to unfold in its reality which was more than 30 years prior to John seeing the vision of these events so in Matthew 11 was A.D 30-31 John was on the Isle of Patmos on ad67-69. so that means that when this first sealed part one of redemption begun to unfold The Book of Revelations was not even written yet what is what is the thunder of God president a thunder is the voice of God when the seal is open not when it's written when it opens a thunder is the voice of God when the seal is open God come on the scene Jesus of Nazareth God and flesh the son of God and he began to speak about his plan to redeem okay and when he spoke it opened that seal when he spoke it opened part one it didn't have to be a written word in Genesis when God created the heavens and the Earth you realize that it wasn't even written for almost 2500 years later when Moses God gave Moses the vision to write the Book of Genesis he didn't have to write it first to create heavens and earth no he had to speak it and if the spoken word that we have yet today that's the one that speaks to our hearts that's the one that gives us Revelation that's the one that changes Our Lives it's not the written word I think the Bible it may still be the most sold book in the world and the most misunderstood book in the world but though it's the most soul I don't think it's the most read and it certainly is the least understood because it requires a revelation Matthew 11 and verse 1. this is the beginning this is the opening for the first seal part one of a Plan of Redemption Jesus Christ the son of God opening the word opening this great Plan of Redemption to restore us to give us a different kind of birth of birth like his birth the born-again experience is a supernatural experience with the father and when you're born again of the spirit of God your appetite changes the way you talk changes the things the music you listen to Changes Everything Changes because you've been born again of the spirit God and you put the carnal and flesh things you push them to one side and you say I'm following Jesus from this day forward so Matthew 11 1 it says and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his 12 disciples he departed then to teach and to preach in their cities the Teaching Ministry of the Seven Seals had begun and Jesus with the teacher here he is both The Lion and the lamb and his Thunder is that he is now going to teach them by the spoken word because the things he's going to start teaching were not written yet he is teaching by the spoken word before it had not been written yet he's teaching them how to recognize their day and and the message of Elijah in Matthew 11. oh you'll have to go back and make time to read it slowly verse by verse and recognize that's the opening of the first seal that's the beginning of part one there's the lamb and the lion right there there's the Thunder of God going forth what is the thunder but it says a thunder is the voice of God so let me ask you is was Jesus the voice of God he was gone the Thunder is the voice of God when a seal is open the Thunder is the voice of God when part one started unfolding for our salvation for our healing for our deliverance for our strength to live a life worthy of the Gospel a Christian Life thank you so here Matthew 1 11 1 and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed then to teach and to preach in their cities in other words Jesus the line of the tribe of Judah he said he's telling everybody come and see come and see I'm in Biden this morning come into the word come and see here he's both The Lion and the lamb and his Thunder is because he's now going to teach by the spoken word for as I said it hadn't even been written yet the things he was going to teach he's teaching them how to recognize their day their message of Elijah and Elijah who was to introduce to them Christ and yet here he is Jesus himself is going to introduce Elijah because they missed it they didn't know who John was but Jesus is going to make it plain and yet the Bible says and the multitudes walked away and they didn't get it what was Jesus speaking of in Matthew 11 his first coming and tell me as he spoke about his first coming was it a future prophecy what is it was it a past prophecy it was happening right as he was speaking about it it was present tense this prophecy that this teaching he was teaching them about it was happening right in front of their eyes and they couldn't get it so Jesus is teaching here in Matthew 11. on Malachi 4 5 and 6. he's connecting it to Malachi 3. he's connecting so many scriptures here showing them that this day this scripture is fulfilled that John is this Elijah and that the Lord Of Glory has come this is Revelation 6 1-2 unfolding Jesus patting more detail to the opening of this verse Seal because when John saw the vision it was just two verses where did he say there was going to be a forerunner where did he say there was coming in Elijah in Revelation 6 1-2 it didn't say it but when Jesus grabbed the hold of that scripture and pulled it down from his mind now he begins to add to it when this first seal opens it's going to open because a forerunner is coming behold I'll send you lies with the prophet for the great and terrible day of the Lord and He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the ministry of John comma and turn the hearts of the children to the father and that comma represented a time of tooth over 2 000 years from his first coming to the second coming from the first Elijah to the second Elijah from from part one the first seal to part seven the seventh seal in a single comma he divided it oh it takes Revelation and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail it'll take a revelation it'll take you having a conversation with almighty God on a regular basis at home when I'm washing dishes of course I've only done that like four times in 40 years since I got married but some of you wash dishes more often and it's right there where he can speak to you and bring down Revelation to your hearts that not even theologians and doctors of divinity come this close to understanding what God can give you so Jesus Matthew 11 he begins teaching on Malachi 4 5 and 6. he connects it with Malachi 3 showing them this day these scriptures I'm talking about are happening right now that John is this Elijah and that the Lord Of Glory is come him the Lord Of Glory has come whisper he probably said me so Revelation 6 1 is unfolding in Matthew 11. it's happening in real time can Jesus is adding more detail to the opening of part one of seven parts of a great Plan of Redemption verse 2 of Matthew 11 now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples the ministry of John had ended he had fulfilled everything he needed to fulfill God could have let him die a simple death out in the woods go off and lean against a tree in his heart stopped but John died a Vine of death but John died for the gospel that he preached now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples true he knew Christ he knew that that was his cousin they had met they had talked they've had private conversations that aren't read that aren't that aren't written in the Bible John knew him well John saw the mighty works that he did and the Miracles of his first full ministry as an evangelist praying for the sick but now John's thrown into prison a prophet tells us the eyes of this Prophet had dimmed over he was feeling rejected he was feeling alone he was doubting his own Ministry who he was attending when he would doubt when you doubt yourself you start doubting who others are in your life but when the Holy Ghost comes into our lives and starts lifting us up when we see who we are then once again we can look around and see who our friends and brothers and sisters in the Christ really are that's a refilling of the Holy Ghost when we once again see I'm a Son of God I'm A Daughter of Zion that's who I am plan seven of the Seven Seals revealed it to me that's where I'm living I'm being mentored by the Father the holy spirit being prepared for Rapture in faith Matthew 3. after after John who's in the prison he sent two of his disciples and in Matthew 11 3 and said unto him to Art Thou he that should come or do we look for another a prophet a mighty prophet but he's just a prophet who's just a man he was having doubts because he would because he was in a tough situation he knew his days were numbered maybe two or three days maybe a day maybe the next 24 hours maybe another week in prison and they'd behead him in verse 4 Jesus answered and said unto him go and show John again those things which you do here and see take John a testimony tell them this is what we heard this is what we saw with our own eyes details that are under the opening of the first seal take John these details it's the same things that would repeat under the opening of the seven seal the pattern of God's word God's word has a pattern in everything because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever because God is unchanging in all of his ways oh if you catch the pattern from Genesis you'll see it all the way to the end and you'll see the pattern of how he's working in your own life and how he's working in my life verse 5 Jesus said this is what I want you to tell John it'll wake him up it'll encourage him it'll know he's he's done everything correctly and right and his reward stands before him the blind received their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf here the dead are raised up it's almost like we're talking of the ministry of this end time Prophets but he wasn't the first to display this it was this Prophet the prophet of prophets a god Prophet Jesus Christ so the pattern had to follow it's the pattern the blind received their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the death here the dead are raised up and the poor at the gospel preached to him Jesus is now adding detail again to the opening of the first seal and detailed to the opening of the seventh Year ah they can't miss it doesn't miss but men trained in seminaries and Bible schools they're not taught the pattern of God they're taught propaganda they're taught they're taught Church catechisms they're taught Godless and when presented with this message they go where in the world we say we get it from the Bible the word they can't see it because what they received is dogmas and propaganda of denominations from the Catholic to the Pentecostal but God has taken us back into his room the blind received their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them when at the opening River seal at part one of seven parts of a Plan of Redemption to redeem Israel the Fig Tree and to redeem the bride tree of gentile people you and I this happened at the opening of the first seal so it's the pattern of redemption at the opening of The Seven seal and we can say we saw it we believe it it happened God rich in Mercy Jesus Matthew 11 preaching of his first coming giving us detail opening the first seal here part one it's opening right here before our eyes is adding detail telling us the the process of the opening of this seal part one of the Plan of Redemption salvation restoration healing virtue Minds being healed hearts that are hard being softened salvation being extended to all in this great plan Elijah the Forerunner Messiah the king of the Jews and the Antichrist ride has begun right here in Matthew this is where it started we can put our finger on it now where it started it's right here in the word and it's right here in the Bible verse 6 of Matthew 11. and blessed is he magazine or the sports page or some form of entertainment don't read it like a non-fiction book because as you read one verse you don't understand it many times you know where the answer and Revelations for that please in the next two or three verses sometimes in the very next verse so Jesus is speaking to the people and in verse six he said and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended he's speaking to a multitude of people you know what he's doing he's earning the hearts of that crowd knowing that many are being offended with what he is saying can you catch that he caught that spirit and he says okay let me say let me exhort and rebuke you in a positive way how shall I start this yes I know how because he's God he said and blessed is he takes the pressure up okay oh he's blessing us now and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended why he's even teaching us how to talk in tough situations when people offend you at work say something nasty to you can tell them you know what blessed are you if you could understand what I understand instead of misinterpreted all the things that God teaches us in every verse verse 8 he said about what verse 7 and as they departed Jesus and as they're getting up and leaving Jesus begins to send to the multitudes that are all walking away from me concerning John what went into the Wilderness to see because for people that have followed John in these multitudes were people that John were people that John had baptized but now they're walking away from the Living Word they're walking away from from the one that John identified as the Lamb of God and as they departed Jesus began to begin to turn you John what went ye out into the Wilderness to see a reed shaken With the Wind he's and he's speaking all of this in parables this is the parable of the first coming of Christ this is the parable of the opening of the first seal this is the parable of part one of a plan to redeem it to save you to baptize you with his holy spirit a plan to offer you the born-again experience you need only say I accept it Lord if you need only repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went me out to the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what when you out for you to see a man clothed in soft Raymond behold they that wear soft clothing are in King's houses but what when you're out to see a prophet yes he says a prophet and I say unto you more than a prophet the Elijah of the first coming he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet before he was a forerunner to the first imminent person so what about the Elijah of the second coming will he be a prophet he'll be a prophet and he'll be more than a prophet it's because he will be a forerunner to the second coming of Christ verse 10. for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee now he's sharing with them a revelation he's unfolding the word right Revelation 6 1 the lion said come and see we're going to have a teaching a Teaching Ministry for this is Hume king of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy Wayne before thee now he's going to connect John to this prophecy of Malachi 3. Jesus was quoting The Book of Malachi Jesus is quoting the prophet Malachi because it was God that gave Malachi these words to say and put in a book of Prophecy Malachi 3 1 said behold I send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me can the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom he Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts hmm Jesus was identifying John in the scriptures Jesus was saying to this to to Israel who believed the Old Testament who believed Malachi 3 1 he's saying Malachi 3 1 behold I send my messenger you know who that is that that Malachi spoke of 400 years ago it's this man John that's sinning in herod's prison cell waiting to be executed he is this man and this day this scripture is fulfilled unfolded it's finished and John fulfilled it all all the things that he was revealing to the multitudes and the multitudes has just gotten bored we liked you better when you were evangelist just praying for the sick and the dead were being raised and the blind eyes were seen my cousin who was deaf he can hear again and my mother's best friend Rosie who had terminal cancer and a lump on her neck and the doctors had given her up go home and die you might have a week two weeks three weeks and she got a prayer card in California they went to the service and a prophet and more than a prophet prayed for Rosie and the lump fell off when the cancer was gone and yet that was just to catch the attention of the honest and hard of sons and daughters that were lost in the world lost in denominations Creeds Darkness Seminary teachings with no hope till God opened part seven because in the Days of Elijah the pale horse rider began and part seven opened the seventh seal Matthew 11 verse 11 11. Verity I say unto you he's emphasizing the ministry of John he's identifying who John is because John publicly identified who he was if they can believe that John is this Malachi 3 if they can believe that John is the Elijah the first Elijah of Malachi 4 5 and 6. then they will believe him he's trying to get the people to see the ministry of John that believed in John because if they believed in John then they'll believe one said but this man behold Jesus Nazareth he's the Lamb of God you see it verily I say unto you among them that are born of women verse 11. there have not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he as we've said before Lord Jesus is he the greatest or he's not the greatest just tell us one thing which one is he he told us both he's the greatest and he's the least watch how he said it barely I sent you among them that are born of women everyone on planet Earth is born of a woman amongst them that are born of women there had not risen a greater than John the Baptist Sinners and Saints alike's presidents and and the bums on the street it says amongst them that are born of women there had not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than you he's speaking of two kingdoms the Earthly carnal Kingdom and the family of God in this Earthly carnal Kingdom there's not a greater man than than John he's the greatest but in the Kingdom of Heaven John was called to be a servant to God's people and he said and he said and he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he for I've sent this faithful Ministry to serve my people and not be Lords over them for they for my children my family has one Lord one Christ one savior one Redeemer one Healer and it's not the ministry of faithful Ministry they are the sermons to God's people and we are the least so when you see someone acting contrary to that you know you know where they are spiritually you know the condition of their hearts verse 12. and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven set for the violence and the violent take it by force if you grew up Pentecostal you grew up in the Apostolic Church the Jesus name denomination they all taught this that this scripture was the followers and Believers of Jesus that were rising up with great Valor and courage and they're going to fight for what they believe in that is wrong that is a denominational dogma and not a scriptural truth I know it's hard to hear because I heard it all my life as a kid too that's what it meant I've heard I've heard people ministers who were in apostolics all their lives come into the message and they still say it that way but it's not true that's human reasoning and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven the Kingdom of Heaven God's kingdom God's children are suffering violence and the violent take them by force taku the children of the Kingdom in other words Israel was in a great persecution everyone that was following Jesus of Nazareth was being persecuted at this time by the Jewish Orthodox church and by the Pagan Roman government everyone had their guns set on the believer that was following John it was following Jesus remember Isaiah 53 which Isaiah 53 is also a scripture that adds detail to the opening of the first seal it's an Old Testament Prophecy of the opening of the first seal part one hmm showing us more detail to the same event let's read Isaiah 53 and verse 9. because it's going to connect us with what we just read in verse 12. it's going to give us understanding and verse 9 of Isaiah 53 it says and he made his grave with the wicked talking about Christ because Isaiah 53 is all about Christ from the first verse to the last Isaiah 53 starts talking about Jesus when he's a 12 year old boy all the way to the time he's crucified so let's read it it's Isaiah 53-9 can he made his grave with the wicked that was Jesus it was a prophecy and with the rich in his death remember it was Joseph of aramethia that would take him a rich and prominent man in Israel at the time and a follower and believer of Christ asked for the body of Jesus from Pontius Pilate an influential man Pontius Pilate knew him this man's got money okay what's it worth to you arametha you just say the price you just tell me what it's worth to you Pontius Pilate and it's I'll give it I'll give it to you right now they made a deal he said he's the body's all yours taken so that prophecy could be fulfilled and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth no bidens Matthew 11 verse 13. it says for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John so then what should we expect after John verse 14 says and if you will receive it this is Elijah which was to come he plainly puts in John in the prophecy this is Elijah John which was to come Malachi 4 1-6 you should expect this Elijah John to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and he did in verse 15. he said he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear this statement is used at the end of every Church age in the Book of Revelations but The Book of Revelations hadn't been written yet so this was the spoken word that would be written seven times in every age so what was beginning the first church age an overlap of Jewish age and Gentile ages what was what was unfolding the first steal part one of redemption and the line of the tribe of Judah extended the open book and the revelation of the of these Seven Seals seven parts of redemption first to Israel he ordained his ministers the twelve go only to the house of Israel and when Israel rejected at the cross of Calvin the open book and the revelation of the Seven Seals was given to a gentile bride but was given to a New Testament Church was given to you and I it's the parable of the Old Testament we've said it many times we'll say it again when Joseph came to offer his two sons to Jacob that he would pray for them and give the patriarchal oh patriarchal blessing to the two boys so he put his eldest boy at Jacob's right hand between the youngest has his right the boys not two girls the boys in this instance represented two churches the Jewish orthodox and the Gentile Church a New Testament Church but the eldest son to him belonged The Lion's Share of all the inheritance of his father and Jacob knew this well and he was supposed to give it all to the eldest boy and just pronounce a blessing on the youngest he was blind he's dying what does he do he's going to do what he knows is the custom in Israel now when he goes to put his hands on the boys who already placed perfectly placed by his son Joseph he crosses his hands and he gives the Lion's Share to the youngest boy the New Testament Church because the Elder boy was going to reject it at the coming of Christ the two boys were two churches the hands were the cross of Calvin and at the cross of Calvary The Lion's Share that was first shared with Israel would be given to this New Testament Church called The Bride of God Jesus Christ The Lion's Share will be given to a man called Kenny and a sister called Rachel The Lion's Share would be given to a man called Orly and sister Orly The Lion's Share would be given to us for a chance of redemption salvation to be able to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the lion shall be given us before we could have Rapture in faith in this last hour this last day seven parts of a Plan of Redemption because the only way for his sons and daughters to be born now is through a woman it was going to take time for his millions and millions of children to be born on the Earth but God said I can wait and as each one is born I'll pluck them up and no one will take him out of my hand I'll wait for this slow process till they're all born but when the last one comes in I'll wrap this whole world up and as I've been cleansing your lives with Holy Fire I'll clean this Earth with Holy Fire and we'll all come back one day and divine indeed amen God the rich in Mercy verse 14 Matthew 11 and if you will receive it this is Elias John the Baptist which was for it to come and John fulfill this ministry and he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children verse 15. he that hath hears to hear him let this statement is used at the end of every Church age and he uses it here for it's the opening of the first seal and it's the overlap of the Ephesian Church age and the white horse rider in its reality form begins his ride in the Days of Elijah John the Baptist now the pattern is set now we understand one seal doesn't open for each Church age but instead the first four seals and Riders unfold throughout seven Church ages God rich in Mercy his word unfolding before our very eyes and where did we see it unfold and God is speaking here of John the Baptist I want to just pick up this one scripture just one moment so Matthew 11. is Jesus speaking on his first coming but it isn't prophecy no more as he's speaking to them on this first coming as he's speaking on the Elijah Ministry because he's speaking on the right of the Antichrist the white horse rider as he's speaking about it it's happening right as he's saying it it's not something future and yet the entire multitude walked away from him offended because they couldn't understand and yet there must have been someone when the multitudes walked away I don't doubt for one minute that of those thousands as Jesus seen him walk away and everyone pulled away from him that maybe there was five six seven left standard and Jesus might have told them you go also and maybe some little fella said to him Lord whom will we go to although we can't understand all your telliness we believe only you have words of eternal life and in due time we are sure that you'll reveal it to us if we keep pressing if we keep reading if we keep asking if we keep praying if we keep believing Uber partakers of this seventh seal part seven on how to get out of this world and how to live a life Victorious while we're here and when the trials just seem too heavy we know a refueling is promised because of refills you is for the hard trials we go through it's not a reward for being being a good boy yeah I I couldn't even be a good boy when I was just a boy they took Jesus and the refilling to assure me that despite my shortcomings and complexes I'm a son of God despite your shortcomings you're a daughter of God rich in Mercy first we read Isaiah 53 verse 9 where we're setting he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth okay because verse 12 of Matthew 11 says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violence take it by force but Isaiah 53 says this Christ this Lord Jesus it said it said and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth so the followers of Jesus were not violent people neither did they do violence John the Baptist when he was when he was baptized in there on the Jordan and the people would come and be baptized they would repent and be baptized that their sins might be forgiven that their sins might be remitted and as he was baptizing people came to him publicans publicans were Jews who had forsaken their religion For the Love of Money and got a job with the Roman government to attack to be to be the tax collectors for Rome they were hated of the Jewish people absolutely hated because they were Jews to as far as they were concerned were blasphemers Republicans Matthew was a publican and yet God changed his life gave him a Supernatural Ministry and the pumpkins came to John they and said Republicans you know you know what what all our Jewish people think of us we got a lot of enemies in Israel what can we do to be saved do we have to quit our job he says take only the taxes and the amount that Rome tells you to charge and don't take any more extra and put it in your pocket stop doing that stop doing that then the soldiers came to him Roman soldiers Temple guards and they and the Roman soldiers said what can we do to be saved we're soldiers of Rome he says this is what you do he says uh be happy with the wage they give you and do harm to no man how do you do that and remain a soldier of Rome you've got to quit you've got to walk away so what was John saying John was not a vine man of violence neither did he want men to be violent he wanted you rather to be a man who was willing to give his life for the gospel and for truth so this here where the Bible speaks that in the Days of Elijah what would take place let me just find that I keep touching the screen and it grows all over the place verse 12 and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffeth violence and the violent take it by force the followers of Jesus were not by new people the followers come John the Baptist were not lighted people but the Jewish Orthodox Church was violent man and Rome was a nation of violence so this isn't believers they were bringing this persecution on the Kingdom of Heaven God's children this was the ride of the Antichrist anointing Israel and anointing Rome to persecute the Believers in Christ remember the second part of Revelation 6 1 and 2. how it read let's read it together Revelation 6 the first seal we read the first one first seal the first verse and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the first be sane come and see fulfilled in Matthew 11. fulfilled in Matthew 11. again in Matthew 11 Jesus adds more detail to this verse now verse 2 the second part and I saw and behold a white horse can he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth concrete and to conquer he went forth creating violence and with violence taken by force Matthew 11. this scripture opened up in reality the white horse rider began in the days of John the Baptist the first Elijah God rich in Mercy Matthew 11. Jesus speaking in his first coming not that it was passed not that it was future it was happening right then as he was speaking about it the first seal opening the ephesianage unfolding and in our day and Elijah come on the scene speaking of the second coming like it was future but you know what it was happening as he was speaking and it's happening today there is prophecy and word of God unfolding as we're speaking this morning hmm his angels are encamped upon us giving us strength for this journey we'll stop there and I just want to say God's plan is taking us back God's plan is turning our hearts God's plan is working God's plan is changing us day by day God's plan is increasing our faith God's plan is to be the family of God together with him again eternally we thank you for coming to stand to our feet this morning we we tried something new we were doing the zoom for a few families that are listening I think this morning uh who I know this morning Joshua had changed it over to uh working through YouTube to broadcast the services and I hope it was a blessing to those that are listening um I hope it was got over nice and clear they've all expressed their desire to hear the services and and I pray it was a blessing for them and this is just part one of many parts of this this message the white horse rider in the Days of Elijah and because it's a pattern of God's word the pale horse rider in the Days of Elijah we stay with the pattern of the word and we can make all the Bible scriptures come together and it blesses our heart to see that this book is a book of Truth and a book of salvation and a book of eternal life we thank you for coming home as we pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning we ask your blessings Lord Upon This Day and upon everyone who is present Lord everyone here was predestinated before the foundation of the world to be here you they were in your mind that they would be here and even hear this message surely it's because everyone here is a son and daughter of God at different stages we know at different levels we see it some 30 some 60 some 100. but every one of us ordained to grow in Christ to come to the Statue of a perfect man Lord the foundation statement of this seven seal is this repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of this Holy Ghost and Fire Lord we thank you for bless your children here now each and everyone the remainder of mistake and Lord to me the things I've said only urge them to go and have a personal experience with you to get back into this blessed book called The Bible where you can give them more Revelation at home that I could ever give them in a week open to them this open book in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you all this morning the Lord be with you but can you take this place thank you mm-hmm I just wanted to say that um I I believe that with brother Daniels was saying this is the truth and how that um the Lord wants to reveal himself to us on a daily basis and you know this came across my heart and I'm sure I'm human I'm sure it may have maybe come across yours but you know we I believe that we're a special people upon the face of the highest not that we're something but just because the Lord called us and that I just want to say that we Are Who We Are by the grace of God and I I believe that if we're not careful we can forget that you know it's a relationship we we are a special people are called people and so we don't want to fall into that that rut that you know the Lord has revealed himself to us that's true and he's made himself to us but we want to we want it to be a constant a revelation because the Lord is continually revealing himself and we want to we want to be sure that make our calling and election sure on a daily basis and uh the Lord just spoke to my heart saying you know you are a special people but we need to be seeking his face daily not it isn't just the Lord is revealed itself to you and and we've received the message of the hour and we know what we know and that's it nope then we put a period on it right we don't want to do that I'm just I'm I'm just sharing this from my heart because I I believe I've experienced that and I don't want to experience that no more I want to I want to I want the Lord to reveal himself to me on a daily basis because that's what we're called for it's a revelation that's the church built upon Jesus said Upon This Rock although my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against so God bless you and we just want to sing a couple songs um I've just been thinking about a touch from the Lord you know when I first came to the Lord I remember before I come to the Lord and I he allowed me to come into His
