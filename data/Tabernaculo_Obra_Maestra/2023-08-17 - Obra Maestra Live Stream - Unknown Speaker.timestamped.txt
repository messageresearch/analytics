[43:39] [Music]
[43:50] [Music]
[44:01] [Music]
[44:03] Jesus
[44:09] [Music]
[44:24] [Music]
[44:35] foreign
[44:49] [Music]
[44:57] [Music]
[45:03] [Music]
[45:13] [Music]
[45:17] in the name of
[45:19] the Lord
[45:21] [Music]
[45:38] [Applause]
[45:45] [Music]
[45:56] and we
[46:00] [Music]
[46:03] were Thanksgiving
[46:07] [Music]
[46:32] see you all this evening
[46:34] it's good to be back once again
[46:37] with Saints of light precious faith
[46:40] it's good to hear the testimony
[46:43] of God's healing power and his virtue
[46:46] for brother canning
[46:49] talking to brother Angel he'd been sick
[46:51] for a while also quite a few days and by
[46:54] the grace of God he pushed that aside
[46:56] and he came to service tonight and I'm
[46:58] sure there's a great blessing for him
[47:00] here because that's what faith is about
[47:03] faith moves us when our body don't want
[47:07] to move
[47:09] so we are thankful he was able to make
[47:12] it tonight
[47:15] and he and if he couldn't have made it
[47:17] God knows that too but he also knows
[47:21] that he did make it
[47:23] God is a God uh he's a Healer the Bible
[47:28] says that by his stripes
[47:31] in the Book of Matthew of course it
[47:34] documents the great healing revivals
[47:40] and that's the way the first seal opened
[47:43] up
[47:44] part one was with a great healing
[47:48] Revival
[47:58] and of course for us now it's history
[48:01] and we don't see the pattern of both of
[48:04] them
[48:08] Jesus when he came when the Bible says
[48:11] that his Fame went throughout all Syria
[48:13] Jesus
[48:16] and they brought the sick people to him
[48:20] those with diverse diseases and torments
[48:25] problems in their minds
[48:29] depression depression they had PTSD back
[48:33] then too
[48:37] only they didn't know what to call it
[48:40] but Jesus knew what you call it
[48:43] he says you're possessed and tormented
[48:46] with devils
[48:48] and then it says and he healed them
[48:52] the Centurion came to him
[48:55] and approached him he was a gentile
[48:58] it wasn't time for the Gentiles to
[49:01] approach him
[49:03] he said I'm not worthy for you to come
[49:06] under my roof
[49:08] but I've been watching you
[49:11] and and and uh I don't want to brag or
[49:14] anything
[49:16] but I I understand how Authority works
[49:25] when I tell someone to do something
[49:29] if it's one man or a thousand men they
[49:34] better do it and you know what I can
[49:55] you don't have to come to my house
[49:57] you just speak the word
[50:01] Because by the time I get home
[50:05] if I'm right about you
[50:10] then when I get home
[50:15] he's going to be healed because you can
[50:19] command okay
[50:24] just speak the words
[50:27] Jesus Jesus a healing Revival
[50:31] the Bible says he says that Jesus they
[50:34] brought great multitudes followed them
[50:38] and it says and he healed them all
[50:42] thousands and thousands like the
[50:45] meetings in Durban Africa
[50:49] 30 40 100
[50:51] 000 people
[50:54] and Jesus Again
[50:59] by his stripes
[51:12] healing for the church
[51:20] and and what if you get sick brother
[51:22] Daniel Lane God takes you home
[51:27] the greatest healing
[51:29] you see the healing in this flesh is
[51:34] just a sign of a greater healing
[51:39] Divine Healing for this flesh
[51:44] the body can get sick again
[51:47] but it speaks of the greatest healing
[51:51] a body change
[51:55] so we're thankful to God
[52:00] turn with me once again
[52:03] and we'll be reading from Saint John 10
[52:07] yes
[52:10] and this would be part six I believe
[52:15] of the white horse rider in the Days of
[52:18] Elijah
[52:46] one through seven
[52:49] again a parable
[52:52] for the prophecy was that Jesus would
[52:55] speak everything in a parable
[52:58] and without a parable he wouldn't
[53:01] but when he spoke
[53:04] he would be speaking things to us
[53:11] in other words he'd be revealing to us
[53:14] how how Adam and Eve failures
[53:19] so that you wouldn't have to follow the
[53:21] same way
[53:23] but it also revealed
[53:26] that the Adam and Eve were in a process
[53:29] of a son and a daughter
[53:32] being trained
[53:36] on how to handle the spoken word
[53:40] so we know how they felt yes
[53:45] and we know the purpose why God's
[53:47] revealing that to us
[53:50] again enter into this friendship with
[53:53] the father
[53:55] and have the same relationship
[53:58] that the Holy Spirit can
[54:09] [Music]
[54:18] and he gave us the exam
[54:22] of the power of God
[54:25] but in total holy control in total
[54:29] control
[54:33] verily verily I say unto you he that
[54:36] entereth not by the door into the
[54:38] Sheepfold but climeth up some other way
[54:40] the same is a thief and a robbery
[54:49] so we have a door
[54:52] we've got a sheep
[54:56] and we and we have a shepherd
[55:00] verse two but he that enters in by the
[55:03] door is The Shepherd of the sheep
[55:09] through him the porter openness
[55:12] so now we've got a door we've got a
[55:16] Corral
[55:17] there's a thief
[55:21] and now there is a door to come in
[55:24] through
[55:26] and he that enters
[55:28] is The Shepherd of the sheep says to him
[55:32] the porter openness
[55:35] another position could it be someone
[55:38] else and the sheep hear his voice
[55:43] listen to him the Border openings
[55:54] of the Sheepfold
[55:57] do better pastors
[55:59] out of an enclosed area
[56:03] to total freedom
[56:06] and verse 4 and when he put it forth his
[56:09] sheep he goeth before them
[56:14] and the Sheep follow him for they know
[56:18] his voice
[56:40] and a stranger they will not follow but
[56:43] will flee from him for they know not the
[56:46] voice of strangers
[56:51] this Parable Jesus spoke unto them
[56:54] Jesus
[56:56] they understood not what things they
[57:00] were which he spake unto them
[57:06] and remember when Jesus said father I
[57:08] thank you
[57:10] that there's great teaching that I just
[57:12] taught
[57:15] no one understood
[57:20] that's not your average teacher
[57:23] the average teacher wants to do teaching
[57:25] and everyone say I got it it was perfect
[57:27] I was understandable
[57:32] then then Jesus said unto number seven
[57:35] again verily verily I say unto I am the
[57:38] door of the sheep and he said
[57:46] he was the door
[57:48] in this Parable he was also the Shepherd
[57:51] in this person
[57:53] it was also the porter
[57:56] he was also the voice
[58:00] just like he was God on the throne
[58:03] [Music]
[58:05] just like he would just like he was the
[58:08] lion of the tribe of Jesus
[58:11] just like he was the Lamb of God
[58:14] just like he's the great Holy Spirit
[58:17] once I come to the son of man
[58:25] all for one purpose
[58:29] to get closer to you
[58:31] change forms and change forms keep
[58:36] descending don't get closer to you so
[58:40] that you could learn
[58:43] to hear his voice
[58:46] regardless
[58:47] of what role he was unfolding
[58:51] but you could look through the Bible
[58:55] God
[59:02] who gave instructions
[59:11] says read your Bible
[59:13] and if you don't see Jesus Christ
[59:17] some forms
[59:18] go back and read it again
[59:21] let's pray heavenly father thank you we
[59:25] give you honor and God bless your word
[59:28] to the hearts of your children
[59:30] in Jesus name amen
[59:39] the white horse rider in the Days of
[59:42] Elijah
[59:44] and the pale horse rider in the Days of
[59:47] Elijah
[59:48] and our subject is who has believed our
[59:52] reports
[59:56] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[59:59] revealed
[1:00:01] I know you understand that's Isaiah 53.
[1:00:06] so Isaiah 53 is what then
[1:00:11] part one the opening of the first season
[1:00:14] a new testament a new covenant
[1:00:20] the white horse rider was the first
[1:00:23] coming of Christ
[1:00:24] and that Elijah was John the Baptist yes
[1:00:28] we've read in Matthew where Jesus
[1:00:30] identified
[1:00:32] and the other prophecies that identified
[1:00:34] John also
[1:00:37] so we realize that the Bible has
[1:00:40] patterns in it
[1:00:42] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:00:44] yesterday today and forever
[1:00:47] so that the first coming of Christ
[1:00:51] Jesus himself in Matthew 11.
[1:00:55] reveal to us that the writer began then
[1:01:01] this white horse riders
[1:01:05] and he said it began in the days of John
[1:01:08] the Baptist
[1:01:11] that's exactly the pattern of today
[1:01:44] this is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:01:49] how did this book begins
[1:01:53] well throughout the Old Testament
[1:01:55] it was foreshadowed
[1:02:02] it was it was it was foreshadowed
[1:02:06] with the with the sacrifice of every
[1:02:08] single lamp
[1:02:12] it was foreshadowed with a sacrifice of
[1:02:16] a of an innocent lamb once a year all
[1:02:19] the sins of Israel foreign
[1:02:37] [Music]
[1:03:15] and now how God is revealing it to our
[1:03:18] hearts
[1:03:20] you take away all our doubts
[1:03:23] that he has done a work on Calvary
[1:03:27] there was prophesied throughout the Old
[1:03:30] Testament foreign
[1:03:47] foreign
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:49] because you know what
[1:04:52] on the other side
[1:04:54] even the animals
[1:05:02] where the ram gave the testimony
[1:05:04] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[1:05:07] and they wrote it up in a magazine
[1:05:11] Christian magazine
[1:05:13] and a man a brother sent him a little
[1:05:17] note
[1:05:18] I was really enjoying your testimony
[1:05:23] until you said you had a horse
[1:05:27] you said you felt something lick your
[1:05:29] hand and it was your dog
[1:05:33] he said in heaven where is scripture for
[1:05:37] that I hope you know dogs
[1:05:40] he says well brother
[1:05:42] he says you know in the Book of
[1:05:45] Revelations
[1:05:47] that God came with all his Saints
[1:05:51] on white horses and they came from
[1:05:55] Heaven he said so
[1:05:58] to say it's not in the Bible
[1:06:01] it is in the Bible
[1:06:04] you see okay
[1:06:07] we read the Bible but we don't
[1:06:09] understand
[1:06:18] this new testament this New Testament is
[1:06:22] the Lamb's Book of Life is
[1:06:26] in Saint John chapter one in San Juan
[1:06:29] Capitol Uno you turn with me
[1:06:41] Saint John 1 and verse 35.
[1:06:46] and it reads like this
[1:06:51] and again the next day after John
[1:06:53] Stewart and two of his disciples and
[1:06:56] looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith
[1:06:58] Behold the Lamb of God he said yes
[1:07:20] so then what's this book all about
[1:07:24] this New Testament is then the Lamb's
[1:07:26] Book is it is
[1:08:02] so we we must come to a place
[1:08:07] where we can understand this this book
[1:08:11] we see that Jesus Christ was God's land
[1:08:15] in Luke chapter two in Lucas
[1:08:21] beginning at verse 8.
[1:08:27] Luke 2 and verse 8. look as those it
[1:08:30] says like this and you've all read it
[1:08:33] and they were in the same country
[1:08:35] Shepherds abide in the field keeping
[1:08:38] watch over their flock by night
[1:08:45] and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[1:08:48] them and the glory of the Lord Shone
[1:08:49] round about them and they were sore
[1:08:51] afraid yes
[1:08:57] and the angel said unto them fear not
[1:08:59] behold I bring you good tidings of great
[1:09:03] joy which shall be to all people so
[1:09:12] foreign well he he was coming in this
[1:09:16] ministry
[1:09:17] as the Lamb of God
[1:09:19] for all people
[1:09:21] the Jews the Gentiles
[1:09:26] white black brown Blanco this was the
[1:09:30] ministry of the Lamb of God
[1:09:35] and that Ministry it came only for
[1:09:39] Israel
[1:09:40] but when they rejected it a new ministry
[1:09:44] would rise
[1:09:45] to take the message and bring Salvation
[1:09:49] the Jews rejected
[1:09:52] now would be offered to all people
[1:09:58] he says For unto you is Born This Day in
[1:10:02] the city of David a savior which is
[1:10:04] Christ the lord
[1:10:10] okay Jesus Christ the Lamb of God the
[1:10:15] Savior to all people Salvador the Lamb's
[1:10:19] Book of Life
[1:10:23] did not Jesus bring life
[1:10:28] wasn't it life that they rejected
[1:10:32] then what happened the
[1:10:38] eternal life that had been offered
[1:10:42] was given to a gentile people
[1:10:45] a New Testament Church
[1:10:52] to be a savior to all people
[1:10:56] but not all would receive would we would
[1:10:59] would receive it
[1:11:01] so this New Testament is
[1:11:05] indeed the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:11:09] because it's the it's the lamb who
[1:11:13] is the only one that can reveal it
[1:11:17] remember Revelations
[1:11:22] let's turn for a momentum
[1:11:26] foreign
[1:12:34] El Cordero
[1:12:36] who was it that opened this book
[1:12:40] Jesus Christ the Lamb of God in that
[1:12:45] form
[1:12:46] they changed forms many times
[1:12:54] but when when he when he went from the
[1:12:57] angel of the Covenant
[1:12:59] and change forms
[1:13:02] and and God placed a dermatized seed in
[1:13:06] the womb of a little virgin
[1:13:11] um
[1:13:15] and Christ was born
[1:13:21] it transforms once again
[1:13:28] and when he becomes
[1:13:30] he started a Ministry of the Lion of the
[1:13:34] tribe of Jesus
[1:13:44] that was the plan they rejected
[1:13:47] that was the tree that was rejected
[1:13:53] okay
[1:13:55] but when Jesus goes to Gethsemane
[1:13:59] he didn't change forms again foreign
[1:14:26] you might think what was wrong with them
[1:14:30] would you believe me that they were
[1:14:33] living under a lot of stress tired
[1:14:47] and in one hour he went in King of the
[1:14:50] Jews
[1:14:51] and it came out
[1:15:14] but when the pastors
[1:15:18] that had this encounter with these
[1:15:20] angels
[1:15:22] they said where is he
[1:15:25] that's born
[1:15:32] what was it a new testament was being
[1:15:36] written
[1:15:37] this was the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:46] the world knows in the New Testament
[1:15:50] the world thinks it's just history
[1:15:53] no but this book is
[1:15:56] this book is the Lamb's Book
[1:16:00] Parables is hidden a revelation
[1:16:04] a revelation that takes us back into his
[1:16:07] presence
[1:16:09] a revelation that reveals a plan for me
[1:16:15] a revelation that restores
[1:16:21] it's called being born again
[1:16:25] the father
[1:16:27] looks forward
[1:16:31] the father looks forward
[1:16:36] a very child to be born
[1:16:39] so he can have
[1:16:41] start so he can start unfolding and
[1:16:44] growing in a relationship with that one
[1:16:47] that's just been born
[1:16:51] so even after we're born again
[1:16:56] it takes a while to understand
[1:17:00] how special you really are in the eyes
[1:17:03] of God
[1:17:10] I had my first person
[1:17:13] when he was born
[1:17:15] oh my goodness
[1:17:18] it was just so wonderful
[1:17:22] of course I didn't change most of the
[1:17:24] diapers
[1:17:29] and then about the first six or seven
[1:17:31] months
[1:17:32] they don't really know they have a dad
[1:17:36] are they just looking for Mama
[1:17:38] yeah yeah and I'd feel bad I said this
[1:17:42] guy doesn't like me don't judge on a man
[1:17:45] I didn't know no no no
[1:17:46] I didn't realize that I have to I had to
[1:17:49] nurture him and let him grow up
[1:17:54] at times I would forget that I'm the
[1:17:56] adult in this relationship
[1:18:06] and then about 9 10 months 12 months
[1:18:10] 12 years 12 months old all of a sudden
[1:18:13] he wakes up and it's like hey
[1:18:16] you're you're a lot of fun to be with
[1:18:19] yeah
[1:18:25] I'm feeling better I said finally he
[1:18:28] loves me
[1:19:01] um
[1:19:02] foreign
[1:19:05] this
[1:19:07] is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:19:10] this new testament
[1:19:13] no testamento is the opening of the
[1:19:15] first sealed
[1:19:17] and it holds the Revelation revelation
[1:19:21] of all seven parts
[1:19:24] we read it in Matthew 11.
[1:19:26] we're Jesus himself Jesus
[1:19:30] declared part one open declaration
[1:19:37] and the Elijah Ministries had finished
[1:19:41] already
[1:19:42] John was in prison but he said this John
[1:19:45] that's in prison
[1:19:49] he says a prophet I say to you and more
[1:19:52] than a problem
[1:19:53] because he was a forerunner he was the
[1:19:57] Elijah that Malachi for spoken
[1:20:00] the first Elijah because Malachi
[1:20:05] 4.6
[1:20:06] speaks of both the first and second
[1:20:09] coming um
[1:20:21] Elijah would turn the hearts
[1:20:24] of the fathers back to the children
[1:20:28] first it was turning the hearts of the
[1:20:30] fathers to the children
[1:20:34] the Jewish Orthodox church
[1:20:37] trying to turn its heart to
[1:20:40] a new testamental
[1:20:51] a man in the spirit and power of Elijah
[1:20:55] who revealed that detail
[1:20:58] you didn't read that in Malachi foreign
[1:21:19] Juan
[1:21:28] he says he's going to fulfill Malachi
[1:21:30] foreign
[1:21:50] always place a comma and be patient with
[1:21:54] God because every question you have
[1:21:57] foreign
[1:22:20] it began with the opening of the first
[1:22:22] seal
[1:22:25] it begins with part one
[1:22:27] of a great restoration
[1:22:30] but laying within this new testament
[1:22:33] place all seven Parts
[1:22:36] not just the present but the future
[1:22:42] and the Revelation to be able to see it
[1:22:46] with eyes of understanding
[1:22:50] Matthew 11. Jesus taught us Jesus
[1:22:56] about his first coming
[1:22:58] but he wasn't teaching us I am coming
[1:23:01] here
[1:23:04] he was teaching I am here
[1:23:08] so this Parables
[1:23:12] what's happening as Jesus was speaking
[1:23:16] about it
[1:23:17] and they couldn't see it
[1:23:20] it wasn't revealed to them no foreign
[1:23:58] and how he raked those churches over the
[1:24:01] coals he said
[1:24:05] we're looking for another Elijah to come
[1:24:07] yes
[1:24:09] people are screaming amen
[1:24:12] and they don't realize he's not talking
[1:24:15] future
[1:24:16] he's telling you it's happening right
[1:24:19] now
[1:24:24] it took a revelation
[1:24:26] to push away the man and see the pattern
[1:24:29] of God's word
[1:24:32] and we caught it wait a minute
[1:24:38] that's you brother Brian
[1:24:42] the denomination said
[1:24:45] just like in the days of Jesus
[1:24:49] wait a minute yes
[1:24:52] you're trying to say you're that man
[1:24:54] ain't you
[1:24:57] and they close their doors to him like
[1:25:00] they did to Jesus see how the patterns
[1:25:11] you've shown us the sign of the promise
[1:25:17] yes
[1:25:22] God rich in Mercy
[1:25:24] but Matthew 11 wasn't the only place
[1:25:29] where Jesus spoke of this first seal
[1:25:31] that opened
[1:25:33] Saint John 12.
[1:25:38] Saint John chapter 12.
[1:25:49] and we'll jump ahead to verse 26.
[1:25:57] and again Jesus speaking in parables
[1:26:05] let's start at verse
[1:26:08] 23.3 he said Philip cometh and tells
[1:26:11] Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell
[1:26:14] Jesus
[1:26:18] and Jesus answered saying The Hours come
[1:26:21] that the son of man should be glorified
[1:26:27] in other words death burial Resurrection
[1:26:33] verily verily I sent you except the corn
[1:26:36] of wheat fall on the ground and die it
[1:26:39] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[1:26:41] forth much fruit is
[1:26:48] talking about himself
[1:26:50] and it was going to happen real soon
[1:26:54] just days or weeks away
[1:26:59] present truth happening as he was
[1:27:01] speaking
[1:27:04] he's the love of his life
[1:27:07] he that hateth is life in this world
[1:27:10] shall keep it
[1:27:12] unto life eternal
[1:27:15] the end of this plan of God
[1:27:19] he said If any man serve me
[1:27:22] then let him follow me
[1:27:25] servitude
[1:27:29] will cause you to follow him
[1:27:32] and where I am going to show also my
[1:27:36] servant Beast
[1:27:37] If any man serve me
[1:27:40] him will my father honor me padre then
[1:27:44] he says now is my soul trouble
[1:27:48] and what shall I say father
[1:27:50] save me from this hour
[1:27:53] but for this cause
[1:27:58] he said father glorify thy name
[1:28:03] then came there a voice from Heaven
[1:28:07] saying I have both glorified it and will
[1:28:10] glorified it again
[1:28:14] John heard the voice
[1:28:19] the people therefore that stood bye
[1:28:23] they said it thundered
[1:28:26] John said no it was a voice
[1:28:30] the multitudes around there just the
[1:28:33] religious people said no no it sounded
[1:28:34] like it thundered
[1:28:43] Jesus answered and said this voice came
[1:28:47] not because of me
[1:28:49] but for your sakes
[1:28:55] what is the thunder okay
[1:29:00] it's the voice of God
[1:29:04] that's what a prophet told us in this
[1:29:06] day
[1:29:07] adding detail to this scripture
[1:29:17] they said
[1:29:18] the people therefore that stood by and
[1:29:20] heard it said it thundered
[1:29:27] that's how God hit it but how you
[1:29:31] revealed it was once again
[1:29:35] to the voice of a prophet and more than
[1:29:38] a prophet a forerunner Elijah
[1:29:43] he said of course we all know what a
[1:29:46] thunder is
[1:29:49] foreign
[1:30:08] salvation
[1:30:12] for all people
[1:30:15] through Jesus Christ
[1:30:17] The Curse had been broken
[1:30:24] we're all born under that curse
[1:30:27] it is a natural birth
[1:30:34] that's the curse this is
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:58] changes the way we've been reading our
[1:31:01] Bibles
[1:31:05] Deliver Us delivers us from all fears
[1:31:10] this new testamental this New Testament
[1:31:13] is the Lamb's books
[1:31:16] this New Testament is the is the book of
[1:31:19] the savior of the whole world
[1:31:25] and Jesus came and he spoke at all in
[1:31:28] Parables
[1:31:29] and in Matthew 11 25
[1:31:32] he said father I thank you that you have
[1:31:36] hidden these things
[1:31:45] makes us to believe that these are
[1:31:53] you wouldn't think of a child as this
[1:31:56] this little baby here is wise improved
[1:32:02] no you wouldn't refer to it like that
[1:32:06] neither would you say it it's dumb and
[1:32:09] irresponsible
[1:32:14] it's a child so why isn't Prudence
[1:32:19] men and women he says and he said father
[1:32:22] I thank you he has hidden this from the
[1:32:25] eyes of the wise
[1:32:27] men and women but you're revealing it
[1:32:32] but he's not talking babes Naturals
[1:32:36] he's talking babe Supernatural
[1:32:39] he's talking about people who have been
[1:32:41] born again
[1:32:44] a supernatural birth an experience with
[1:32:48] Jesus Crystal
[1:32:51] he said I thank you
[1:32:54] but there is
[1:33:02] that you're gonna that you're revealing
[1:33:04] your word too
[1:33:06] and even though Jesus was one of the
[1:33:08] greatest teachers Jesus
[1:33:20] they didn't understand them
[1:33:23] but he later reveals to us why
[1:33:26] that it was already written in the word
[1:33:29] that he would speak in Parables
[1:33:32] and that these Parables would actually
[1:33:36] be prophecies
[1:33:38] and many of these Parables
[1:33:43] when he was here in his fleshly boss
[1:33:47] many of The Parables as he spoke them
[1:33:50] much
[1:33:56] very moment
[1:34:01] hmm
[1:34:03] the very minute the moment he was
[1:34:05] speaking in Parables
[1:34:08] he was teaching them things
[1:34:11] that were happening right there
[1:34:15] and in every Parable he was revealing
[1:34:18] something
[1:34:19] there was there was a divinely revealed
[1:34:22] mystery Truth for us there
[1:34:27] in the parable of the sower
[1:34:29] he taught us in great details
[1:34:32] that this human race has two fathers
[1:34:36] one is
[1:34:39] one is
[1:34:47] he was really teaching us of two
[1:34:49] churches
[1:34:55] really represented a young Church rising
[1:34:58] up a gentile Church
[1:35:03] and the older son that had been there
[1:35:05] all his life
[1:35:08] represented the Jewish Orthodox Church
[1:35:11] that though they were in the father's
[1:35:14] house
[1:35:15] all the way from the days of Moses to
[1:35:18] the days of Jesus
[1:35:20] claiming to be Abraham
[1:35:23] yet the parable revealed to us
[1:35:27] they were never able to take the fatted
[1:35:30] calf
[1:35:33] and have a good old-fashioned
[1:35:35] Pentecostal Revival
[1:35:40] true worship and praise
[1:35:44] to recognize himself
[1:35:56] and when the father went to the eldest
[1:35:58] son
[1:35:59] and he told them
[1:36:33] all these years I've labored
[1:36:36] under ten commandments
[1:36:39] and and I've actually helped kill people
[1:36:43] that were in adultery just for you
[1:36:48] I've helped persecute the liarsos
[1:36:54] all this I did for you
[1:36:58] you never killed the fatty cat for me
[1:37:00] and had a big Revival
[1:37:03] he said
[1:37:05] you've been with me all this time
[1:37:10] he says and all that I have is yours
[1:37:15] and you could have taken it anytime you
[1:37:17] wanted
[1:37:19] and had an old-fashioned Revival
[1:37:24] but the parable was really
[1:37:26] of the old Orthodox church
[1:37:29] and a New Testament Church
[1:37:34] at the opening of part one
[1:37:39] and it all been prophesied
[1:37:44] with types
[1:37:49] Shadows
[1:37:57] Saint John chapter 3.
[1:38:07] beginning at verse 1.
[1:38:15] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[1:38:18] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews foreign
[1:38:32] we know it was so it's more just than
[1:38:35] just him but there was many of the
[1:38:37] priests now
[1:38:43] the teacher come from God
[1:38:46] for no man can do these Miracles that
[1:38:49] thou doest except God be with him
[1:38:52] [Music]
[1:38:56] we know that God sent you that you're a
[1:39:02] prophet
[1:39:03] men like demons
[1:39:07] who were
[1:39:10] high-ranking members of the Pentecostal
[1:39:13] movement
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:19] one of them
[1:39:35] [Music]
[1:39:43] they couldn't see the pattern of God's
[1:39:46] word
[1:39:48] they wanted him to continue healing the
[1:39:51] people
[1:39:53] so that so that America could be great
[1:39:56] again
[1:39:57] so that no one would ever get sick again
[1:40:04] but it wasn't God's plan
[1:40:07] God wants us to be born again
[1:40:10] so he can take us out of this body
[1:40:14] this is a body of death
[1:40:17] the Bible says Flesh and Blood this
[1:40:23] Israel what will inherit it
[1:40:27] you the person on the inside you the
[1:40:31] predestiness
[1:40:37] foreign
[1:41:04] brings your inheritance right to your
[1:41:07] feet
[1:41:13] Jesus answered and serum to verily
[1:41:15] verily I say unto you verse 3 except a
[1:41:19] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:41:22] kingdom of God
[1:41:29] Nicodemus was still at another level
[1:41:34] a legal level um
[1:41:41] and yet he was a ruler he was considered
[1:41:45] a great teacher in Israel
[1:41:48] and yet he was a very carnal man
[1:41:53] but he was be but he had just been given
[1:41:55] an opportunity
[1:41:58] how can a man be born when he is old
[1:42:05] he was speaking of himself
[1:42:08] can he enter the second time in his
[1:42:11] mother's womb and be born
[1:42:15] Jesus answered verily verily I sin to do
[1:42:18] except the man be born of water and of
[1:42:22] spirit Jesus
[1:42:29] and and baptized
[1:42:33] and you come out of that one
[1:42:36] repented your life surrendered to Jesus
[1:42:39] Jesus
[1:42:41] and then God gives you the Holy Spirit
[1:42:44] and it begins a born-again experience
[1:42:50] it happened right there
[1:42:55] went in sincerely repentance
[1:42:59] and I want to tell you sincerely
[1:43:02] that you came out a born again
[1:43:11] baby videos
[1:43:13] God heals rich in Mercy
[1:43:19] he said except come man be born of water
[1:43:22] and of the spirit
[1:43:25] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[1:43:27] is
[1:43:31] Jesus realized Nicodemus still wasn't
[1:43:35] getting it
[1:43:38] so he says okay let me tell you this I
[1:43:42] said listen now
[1:43:44] more details
[1:43:47] want you to understand this Nicodemus
[1:43:52] he said
[1:43:55] that which is born of the flesh
[1:44:03] anybody here ever been born in the flesh
[1:44:06] like maybe everybody
[1:44:10] and that which is born of the spirit is
[1:44:32] how God is drawing us back into
[1:44:34] expressions
[1:44:38] without a spirit or birth
[1:44:41] a born-again experience
[1:44:44] you cannot see the kingdom
[1:44:48] but to be born again
[1:44:49] then God begins opening the eyes
[1:45:00] if you're there while the babies
[1:45:07] it's going to open its eyes
[1:45:15] he opened his eyes
[1:45:19] he's alive
[1:45:23] and God will continue videos
[1:45:41] he said all that the father has given me
[1:45:49] then Jesus tells us
[1:45:53] Marvel not that I said unto me
[1:45:57] shall be born again
[1:46:03] he said the wind bloweth where it listed
[1:46:07] so now he's trying to explain to
[1:46:10] clinical demons
[1:46:18] Marvel not that I said unto you must be
[1:46:21] born again
[1:46:28] now what about this born-again
[1:46:30] experience
[1:46:32] add some more detail for me
[1:46:36] he said okay he said okay listen this
[1:46:39] the wind bloweth
[1:46:41] in other words where it wants to go
[1:46:45] you hear the sound of it
[1:46:49] but but yet you can't tell from where it
[1:46:52] comes
[1:46:53] and by the sound of it you can't tell
[1:46:56] where it's going to
[1:46:59] then he says
[1:47:01] remember it's a parable
[1:47:03] but I'm trying to explain it so everyone
[1:47:06] will catch it
[1:47:08] he's saying
[1:47:18] foreign
[1:47:44] they can't tell you
[1:47:48] one word came
[1:47:49] they can't tell you
[1:47:52] where it's going
[1:47:55] if the born-again believer can just tell
[1:47:56] me
[1:47:59] I got it
[1:48:02] I've been born again
[1:48:06] where did it come from I don't know
[1:48:11] but I've heard that certain sound
[1:48:14] and I'll never forget that voice
[1:48:17] I'll never forget the first time God
[1:48:20] called me and I heard
[1:48:24] and I've been born again
[1:48:28] Nicodemus answered verse 9 and said unto
[1:48:31] him
[1:48:31] and these things
[1:48:36] Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:48:40] a master
[1:48:42] it is
[1:48:49] barely verily I say unto you
[1:48:52] we speak that we do know
[1:48:56] and testify that we have seen
[1:49:00] and ye receive not our Witnesses
[1:49:05] if I'd have told you Earthly things and
[1:49:07] you believe not
[1:49:09] um
[1:49:11] how shall ye believe if I tell you have
[1:49:14] anything
[1:49:16] and hidden in all the Parables of Jesus
[1:49:20] that the world takes literally naturally
[1:49:26] in there then today is here in the
[1:49:29] Heavenly things
[1:49:33] and there is the voice of God
[1:49:37] speaking to his children
[1:49:43] speaking to us of a better world
[1:49:49] God's Gathering his family
[1:49:51] and he's doing it by Revelation and he's
[1:49:55] doing it by causing us to be born again
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:05] that many are still not being born
[1:50:10] in what's called this message
[1:50:21] this new testament
[1:50:26] more testamental
[1:50:28] that's written is the Lamb's Book of
[1:50:31] Life is
[1:50:34] and in these seven parts of this book is
[1:50:41] revealed to us
[1:50:43] all the small steps
[1:50:53] many of them no one will see you take
[1:50:56] them muchos
[1:50:58] they're so small
[1:51:00] but they're so powerful
[1:51:03] when you take one
[1:51:05] take another use
[1:51:19] we're being changed
[1:51:20] to go back
[1:51:22] to
[1:52:48] turn with me to Luke chapter 2.
[1:53:03] Luke chapter 2 verse 10.
[1:53:09] once again
[1:53:10] and the angel said unto them fear for
[1:53:15] behold I bring you good tidings
[1:53:19] of great joy
[1:53:21] which shall be bring us to all people it
[1:53:25] was the ministry of the Lamb of God
[1:53:27] and yet it was the lion that was
[1:53:30] speaking on it
[1:53:34] Jesus Jesus was prophesying
[1:53:38] the Angels were speaking Los Angeles
[1:53:41] this ministerial change that would take
[1:53:44] place
[1:53:45] they said For unto you is Born This Day
[1:53:48] in the city of David
[1:53:50] a savior
[1:53:54] which is Christ the lord
[1:54:10] would wash away the curse
[1:54:13] of the flesh birth
[1:54:17] in everyone who could release
[1:54:19] and then and now you're you are born
[1:54:22] again
[1:54:24] I'm the spirit of God
[1:54:26] you were always a son and daughter
[1:54:29] you're always a seed of God
[1:54:32] but the born-again experience
[1:54:35] makes you a manifested son and daughter
[1:54:38] of God
[1:54:41] now the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:54:44] it's not only a book of Salvation
[1:54:47] it's also a book of wrath
[1:54:51] for all who would choose to reject
[1:54:56] this Lamb of God the sacrifice made for
[1:55:00] all people is
[1:55:04] turn with me to Revelations chapter 6.
[1:55:11] and verse 15.
[1:55:16] this is the Sixth Seal
[1:55:18] which began in verse 12.
[1:55:22] so we're going to jump to verse 15.
[1:55:25] and it says in the kings of the earth
[1:55:27] and the great men and the rich man and
[1:55:30] the chief captains can the Mighty Men
[1:55:32] And every Bond Man and every free man
[1:55:34] hid themselves in the dens and in the
[1:55:37] rocks of the mountains
[1:55:46] this is speaking of of of every King
[1:55:50] a very PR a very president a very prime
[1:55:54] minister of of every uh of every
[1:55:59] billionaire on planet Earth
[1:56:02] and the kings of the earth and the great
[1:56:04] men and the rich men and the chief
[1:56:06] captains and the Mighty Men And every
[1:56:09] Bond Man and every free man hid
[1:56:11] themselves in the dens and the rocks of
[1:56:13] the mountains
[1:56:23] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[1:56:25] on us
[1:56:27] and hide us from the face of him yes
[1:56:37] for the great day of his wrath is
[1:56:54] and she's in the wedding supper of the
[1:56:56] Lamb yes
[1:57:01] while the world is in a Great
[1:57:04] Tribulation
[1:57:09] like the world has never seen
[1:57:16] Revelation 6 15-17
[1:57:20] the Wrath of the Lamb comes down upon
[1:57:22] the Earth
[1:57:25] because the people who who are still
[1:57:28] here
[1:57:32] with their lifestyle
[1:57:35] they say listen we have no King but
[1:57:40] Lucifer
[1:57:45] even like the high priest of Israel
[1:57:49] that day before Pontius Pilate
[1:57:53] they so wanted Jesus dead
[1:57:58] Jesus muerto that he rose up in toe
[1:58:01] Pontius Pilates
[1:58:03] don't call him the king of the Jews
[1:58:07] for we have no kids
[1:58:17] and it repeats again
[1:58:25] God yes
[1:58:29] Opening Our Eyes
[1:58:33] to recognize
[1:58:35] are they in its message
[1:58:38] and to recognize
[1:58:40] the simple steps
[1:58:43] of how we can grow
[1:58:46] and be like Jesus
[1:58:54] foreign
[2:00:06] Lord Jesus
[2:00:09] Jesus walk us back into your
[2:00:11] interview
[2:00:12] but we know that these little steps is
[2:00:15] changing US foreign
[2:00:28] and we change from Mortal to immortality
[2:00:33] well we won't see death
[2:00:37] but in reality our eyes have been fixed
[2:00:40] on life
[2:00:43] because we've been partaking of the tree
[2:00:45] of life
