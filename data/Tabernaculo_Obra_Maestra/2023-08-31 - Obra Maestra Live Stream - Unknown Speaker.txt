opened the door in the back he was smiling he usually does smile but it was extra big smile and then of course his wife walked in and the baby and I'm sure he's feeling really good good about that it's been several years I'm sure it's been a real trial for them but all these trials work for our good because we're in a a character building process that's what the Lamb's Book is all about that's what this new testament is all about preparing God preparing his children for a new world a better world a better place an eternal place so we're thankful to God that he finally uh brought this little family here together and we extend our warmest welcome to all I bring also greetings from my brother Raul Gonzalez Pastor in Albuquerque New Mexico where we were there this uh this weekend they were uh having a anniversary meetings and uh and also kind of uh rededicating because they got a a new little church building so uh we were very grateful to see that they have a little nicer place now the brothers the Saints all their greetings we had a good time of Fellowship good food good times but it's always good to be back home again also it was all good and coming back home is good being in care and enjoy our time but we also missed every one of you uh I have a short little video I'd like to play you may be seated for a moment uh sent to us from our brother rapael brother Rafael Caba was going to be with us to ministering on September the 10th 9th and 10th but they had a death in their family I believe it was his W her his uh his wife's uh brother he he was a uh he was a high ranking official I believe a general in the congales Army so it was a very sudden death and uh so they had to go back and they won't be here in September but he did send us a video they've been building a new church there to fit everybody in I believe it may be already finished by now the video is probably a couple of months old and uh they they're going to have also a dedicational service they're in the country of the African country of Congo and they've invited us to come down to to minister at the dedicational services the the the the church name a French name of course it means end time Tabernacle and we like to play this little video for youur us to we could continue in prayer for them and for the completion of the church so the services they the dedicational services are in October October um I think it's the 5th 6th sth and eth and nth three or four days and uh so Lord willing if it's God's will we would be heading up there for these dedicational Services cono is one of the poorest countries in Africa and yet in Congo they have some of the largest churches brother Rafael's church here as uh you see the video unfolding here in plane he has a Congregation of maybe 6,000 people that gather every Sunday we we there are some other brothers in in Congo also that we know when we've met Brother Richard diok richarda is in the country of the democratic Republican of Congo there there's two Congos in Africa they are two separate countries they're divided by a large river so brother Rafael is in Congo they call it Congo brail and the other Congo is called Congo kinasa so this is Congo Braille and you can see the type of construction very similar to what you see in uh in Mexico or even South America or we've been down into the islands of uh the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and the style of building is also very similar so they I I say this video is is a few months old and they've just about got it all finished up they it will hold probably five or 6,000 people and they've already filled this one up our brother who is in Congo kinasa Brother Richard diok Richard he has a congregation uh that gathers every Sunday of 16 ,000 our brother Cabella is also in in in kinasa and I believe he had a Congregation of about 10,000 it's it's very impactful to be in a service and in their worship Services of course the colored people they they they they worship freely and as I said the Congo is of one of the poorest countries in all of Africa so it's not like they have any anywhere to go after service is over so their services can last three four five six hours in length because it's really their whole lives and and uh so there's a a great sincerity amongst the people and despite the fact of how poor the country [Music] is yet the people are very giving and they they really give of their need and not what they have extra for for they in a country like this you're the average person doesn't have have a lot extra the little they make is what they need to live on and yet they they give of that it was just like the woman that that gave a in the parable of Jesus and she gave a might she gave a penny maybe it was and and Jesus said she gave more than than all because she gave of what she needed to live on not of what was excess not of extra money that she had that she goes every Friday and uses to go to the restaurant with but these people give they give their all and and uh and and they and they give from what they from what they have need of even to live on so if it be the Lord's will uh these these Services take place the first week in October we had been invited before to go to Congo which was uh quite a few years back maybe oh five six seven years ago and uh we weren't there some circumstances didn't allow us to go then but if it's the Lord's will we we'd like to be there this time and fellowship there with some old friends we have been to Africa before but we were down in the southern tip of Africa which is the country of South Africa we were invited then a few years just before Co I think it was and and we ministered about six services for some Easter [Music] meetings there in just outside of Johannesburg South Africa and we had a wonderful time with God's people there and and Believers from all different parts of Africa had come from Congo from South Africa uh from the different countries that border South Africa and uh we had a great time there with all the saints but it is a long and tiring trip the the trip to South Africa the flying time one way is probably about 20 22 24 hours and the trip one way to Congo is about 30 to 36 hours so it makes me think because we've been on long trips before but but never at 68 years of age but we we know it will be a blessing and uh so we're looking forward to God's Will and to be there with the Saints there in in Congo um Congo is a French speaking country so I would be speaking through an interpreter when we were in France a few years back preaching in Paris France our brother Abel mango went with us so he was our interpreter then back then so there is a brother brother here that lives in Phoenix and he's ministered for us hereos and um he he might be going to be the interpreter but I'm sure they have others but uh we pray that uh he would be able to make it he's an excellent interpreter from uh from the from French to English so we're praying that uh if we if God opens his doors to be there that that brother Joshua could also make it and be there with us we thank you all for coming tonight and as we'll stand with to your feet and uh we'll read the word of God brother Bram used to say he says he says it's customary to stand uh when when when when the when they raise up the flag and we put our hands to our hearts and we pledge allegiance whether whether it be to the United States or whatever country you're from when I was a young boy in a elementary school every morning began there would be a flag hanging in the corner of the room and they would stand all us children up and we all put our hands on our hearts and we would recite the pledge of the allegiance and to to to the nation and to its people to The Republic and it was done every single day every morning I don't think that's practiced anymore but there's a lot of things that were allowed in school when I was a child that aren't allowed anymore but a prophet would say we we stand and put our hands in our hearts to to a nation how much more should we not stand when we read our Bibles and pledge our hearts to the Lamb of God turn with me to Luke Chapter turn with me to to Matthew chapter 11 and verse 7 Matthew 11 starting with verse 7 and it reads like this and as they departed Jesus began to say in the unto the multitudes concerning John what went ye out into the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind and what went ye out to see a man clothed in soft rment behold they that wear soft rment soft clothing are in King's houses but what went you out to see a prophet yes and I say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you now for your word is truth your word sets us free your word changes Our Lives your word makes us better husbands and better wives and better sons and better daughters Lord It's Your word that you we want in our hearts Quicken it to us Lord and Lord help us to believe every word we ask all this in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated we've been preaching on a little series and as you know we had entitled it the pale the the the white horse rider in the Days of Elijah and the pale horse rider in the Days of Elijah and you might ask well which one is it and I would say it's both can we we get this this phrase from The Book of Revelations in chapter six where it begins when the lamb opened one of the seals The Book of Revelations the book of prophecies end time prophecies and and not everything in the Book of Revelations is in the future to happen but many of the visions that John saw for he was the prophet that saw these visions and God had him to write them down but many of the things that the Visions he saw were already passed they were history they they were they already happened and some of the things that he saw that he wrote in symbols happened in the day that he lived so the Book of Revelations was a book of things past was a book of things present and was a book of things future and even today it's still a book of things past but now much of This Book of Revelations almost all is is history some of it is present tense and some of it is in the future and in the very near future and and uh this first seal that began is really the Bible uses the term the Seven Seals but what Seven Seals are in This Book of Revelation it was seven parts of one Divine Plan of Redemption for the Jewish people and for a gentile people and where it begins here on these Seven Seals is in Revelations chapter six the Bible says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals so the lamb here in this prophecy is Jesus Christ if you'll remember in the Book of John I believe it's in chapter three the Gospel of John John is with two of his disciples and he sees Jesus coming and he said Behold the Lamb of God you see John was a was a messenger John John was a forerunner to the first coming of Christ John was was was a prophet of God but he was a whole new line of prophets John was going to be not under the old order of prophets and priests in the law but John would be a prophet a messenger uh under no law introducing the grace of God introducing great changes that would come to Israel the ministry of John would change everything about how Israel worshiped Jehovah first of all John would bring in and Usher in the new name it would no longer be Jehovah the Jews never even mentioned the name of God that the name of God to the Jews couldn't be pronounced in the Old Testament even today the Orthodox Jews when if if you're in contact with one and they send you a text speaking about God they they don't even spell the word god completely spell g capital G they leave an underline no letter and then they spell d because for them just to mention the name and and to take the risk of saying it wrong under the law is blasphemy even yet today but so that's why John's ministry as a prophet to Israel was so controversial because he was going to bring total change to the way Israel would worship he was he was going to tell Israel that they could now approach this God the Jews didn't believe that a man could approach God it all had to be through the high priest had to be in that secret little room called the holies of holies and the people never entered there the high priest alone would enter and he had to be dressed a certain way he would have bells on the Hem of His Garment and when he those bells had to make a certain tone accepted when he would walk behind the the bells every time he moved when he went behind the Cur let them know that he was still alive but when they could no longer hear the bells they know that he had crossed the line and and he had offended Jehovah that done something contrary to how Moses had taught them to enter so on top of all the bells on their garment and and the robes that they wore they were covered from neck to toe nothing could show of their bodies but when the bells were silent behind the veil then they know that God had struck the high priest down he also was a rope tied to his foot so that so that if the bells didn't move ring anymore then they could pull him out of of the holies of holies without anyone entering in for it was death for anyone to enter but John brought a change where he dared the people now when he said from to the poorest to the most vile he was preaching that that that the people could now enter in John was preaching an invitation that you could walk and talk with Jehovah God oh it was so contrary everything was changing from the Old Testament under the law to the New Testament a new book was being written a new testament was being written this this book was the Lamb's Book of Life and only the lamb could open this and and John was the prophet who would be introducing the Lamb of God to the people of God oh it shook that denomination and as you know they couldn't accept the change John was bringing change after change that was what the prophecy said we've read it before in Isaiah 40 turn with me it was a prophecy foretelling the coming of of this Prophet The Coming of this Forerunner John the Baptist who would introduce the Lamb of God Isaiah 40 verse one Isaiah prophesying about John the Baptist this Mighty Prophet but his name isn't written in here 600 years later you'd have to get a revelation that the ministry of John was the prophecy of Isaiah John the Baptist's name is not in this prophecy and yet the Bible identified him but the only way you knew it the only way they believed it here is they saw his testimony they saw his ministry they saw was a prophet the in Isaiah 40 And1 says God speaking to his people Comfort ye Comfort ye my people saith your god listen to the grace of God in this prophecy it's not a rebuke it's not legalism it's grace and mercy being extended vers two speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her Warfare is accomplished it was a time when God was going to bring peace to their hearts peace to their lives because as we know in the days of John the Baptist it was a wicked time it was a time Israel was in slavery to Rome physically literally they were at War but God saying right here speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem WR unto her that her Warfare is accomplished listen to this that her iniquity is pardon you all know what iniquity is Iniquity is when you know the right thing to do do and you choose to do the wrong thing yet it says that her iniquity is pardoned for she has received of the Lord hands double for all her sins it was a time of grace and mercy being extended to Israel because what John would extend to them would be the Lamb's Book of Life John would extend to them would be the new name of God what John would extend to them was to point to a man Jesus of nazare and say behold this man is now your lamb verse three the voice of him that crith in the wilderness this is John prepare ye the way of the Lord listen listen to this his ministry what he's going to do make straight in the desert a highway for our God number one John would do this every Valley shall be exalted number two Every Mountain and Hill shall be made low number three then the Crooked shall be made straight number four and the rough places plain five things was the was the five things of John's Ministry and yet as you know five represents the grace of God it's his number of Grace and as a young man I took this prophecy believing this was John and I went to the New Testament and read the life of John the Baptist and the things that he did and as I looked at it I said the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord then it says make straight in the desert a highway for our God and the more I read the New Testament the less I could see that John had done any work on a highway that he had made any road straight then it said every Valley shall be exalted I couldn't see where John had done that either Every Mountain and Hill shall be made low and I look at how the land is in Israel as you know Jerusalem is in a Valley surrounded by high mountains and it says every Valley shall be exalted I couldn't see where he did that either and every mountain and Hill shall be made low I couldn't see it and I said well let's go to the next one and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough place is plain and I couldn't see where John had done any of this and he didn't literally but prophetically he did everyone because the language is in symbol the language is allegory it's not literal I want you to see what each one of these things were to make straight in the desert a highway for our God even to do that literally even to do it here in the valley we live that would bring a great change every Valley shall be exalted oh to to literally take a valley and make it a mountain that would also be a great change to take every Mountain around Jerusalem and heal and bring it down low that would be a great and tremendous change if they could but they didn't even have the equipment to do that in that day and the Crooked everything crooked made straight would be a great change and the rough place is plain think of everything that's rough roads mountains rocks build roofs and he would make everything rough make him complain I said Lord this is written in symbols it's not it doesn't have a literal interpretation and as I looked at it more I realized every one of these things that the voice of him that crith in the wilderness would do to make something straight a desert in the highway it was change for every Valley to be exalted it was a change for Every Mountain and Hill to be made low it was a change the Crooked to be made straight it was a change for the places to be made plain it was a change so what was this ministry of this Forerunner at the first coming of Christ who was into who was to go introduce Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God as the king of the Jews what was his ministry of John doing it was going to bring to Isel five things change change change change change change he wanted to bring change to Israel no more under the law no more the killing of animals over and over again once and for all the greatest change to introduce Jesus he would be the lamb that would wash away your sin he would be the lamb that take the curse away from you what was that curse we're born in sin shaped in iniquity we come into this world we're born through the sexual desire of our mother and father that's the curse it wasn't so in the beginning God didn't mean it to be that way that's what the woman fell into Eve and it brought the whole human race into this curse that's why we must be born again because a natural birth the natural birth is the curse but to be born again of the spirit of God oh that's the lamb washing our sins away causing us to be born again that we can be baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire and begin a new life in oh hallelujah hallelujah the new order the new min Ministry prophets and priests in the law but John was not a prophet under the law John's prophetic Ministry was under a new book John's prophetic Ministry was under a new testament John's prophetic Ministry was going to change everything about how Israel worshiped their God they were in legalism the Apostle Paul said the law made it made no one perfect but the ushering in of a new hope the ushering in of a new testament the fullfillment of scriptures of Isaiah 7 of Isaiah 9 and6 this unto us a child is born unto us a son is given joh was introducing this child John was introducing this son this Jesus was the son of God this Jesus was the Lamb of God this Jesus was your lamb this Jesus his blood washes every stain from the day you're born to the day you die this Blood doesn't cover your sin this blood takes your sins away as far as the East is from the West this Blood remits this Blood pays a price this Christ he became sin that that you and I would become his righteousness a change was prophesied in the prophetic ministries of John the Baptist who was to introduce Messiah the lion of the tribe of Judah the Lamb of God and a prophet is required and more than a prophet Matthew [Music] 11:10 for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which will shall prepare thy way before thee John was a forerunner to the first coming of Christ John had more than one ministerial gift he was a messenger to a new dispensation he was a forerunner to introduce Christ at his first coming and he was a prophet to the nation of is and he was the order of a new prophetic Ministry John didn't come to introduce Moses in the law no no John came anointed to introduce Jesus Christ and the name of Jesus Christ wasn't written in the Old Testament and the name of John the Baptist wasn't written in the old test it would have to be a revelation that when they came on the scene you as a child of God you could catch that revelation God would reveal it to you remember Peter Jesus was there with the disciples and he said unto them who do men say that I the son of man am the gospel of Matthew some of the disciples said some say you're Jeremiah one of the prophets he asked Peter but who do you say that I am Peter said th are the Christ that means Messiah that means God made flesh Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus said Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against it flesh and blood has not revealed this you my father which is in heaven you heard from Heaven Peter and this is a revelation Holy Spirit has given you who I am oh we need Revelation about God's word recognize our day our message Matthew 111 verely I say unto you among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the B not withstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than thee verse 12 and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent taken we've shared it here with the church many times verse 11 and verse 11 11 and 12 and also the the the chapter of Matthew 11 the chapter of Matthew 11 is a direct fulfillment right out of the Book of [Music] Revelations this is the Fulfillment and the beginning of that first seal what is the first seal it's part one of seven part so when you go and read that book of Revelations and you read on the these Seven Seals just remember say this Seven Seals it's seven parts of one divine plan of restoration of Salvation beginning with Jesus in his Earth Ministry taking us all the way to the end when the Trump of God should sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and we which are alive and will be caught up together in a meeting in the air in the second coming and we're living in that day the second coming of Christ and Matthew 11 was the Fulfillment of Prophecy the first coming of Christ the unfolding of the first seal part one the ver and 12 and and verse 12 of Matthew 11 Jesus we'll share more later but this is the ride of the Antichrist this is the white horse rider beginning his ride Lucifer and it said of this white horse rider he had a bow in his hand but the bow had no arrows and he had a crown in his hand he wasn't crowned but he had these two things in his hand it was the ride of the Antichrist the bow was Israel the denominational Church of that day and the crown was Pagan Rome and both both Israel the church and Rome the Pagan Nation were in Satan's hands in Lucifer's hands and they both worked together that day to cry out and say crucify him that's this coming to pass Matthew 11 is Jesus declaring that this day that scripture was coming to pass Matthew 11:13 for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John in the Book of Luke verse 16 and 16 it's it's Luke pretty much saying the same thing and giving witness of this of what was spoken in Matthew 11:13 and Luke 16 and 16 it says the law and the prophets were until John and many times we think we hear that statement we say okay okay no more law no more prophets that's not what the scripture is saying the law and the prophets were since that time the kingdom of God is preached in other words from this day on beginning with John was he a prophet Jesus said he was so then he is so this was a a ministerial change for the prophets ending the Old Testament beginning a new testament a New Covenant a new book this is this new testament this is the Lamb's Book of Life because remember we just readel 61 and when the lamb opened the seal when did the lamb do this when the the lamb was on the earth when this book was getting written it was an Unwritten book at one time it was just a plan in the mind of God of how he was going to save you but his grace he allowed it to be written he used men as scribes to write it so that you would have a chance to read it so he could give you a re you could recognize the L of God in this day in 2023 he's here today with he just back 2,000 years ago his holy spirit is with he said in his word I will be with you in you to the ends of the world that's a personal promise for you tonight God rich and mercy the law the prophets were until John since that time since the time of John John would begin preaching the the kingdom of God and causing every man and asking you to press into it what was John bringing five things were the five the Five Points of his ministry for Israel that he was going to bring Israel John said I'm ordained of God to bring you five things change change change change change nothing will ever be the same in your life again guess what John John was this Elijah Prophet that Jesus also called him so John wasn't just the voice of one crying in the wilderness in Isaiah 40 John also fulfilled Malachi 4 verses five and six but he only fulfilled half of it because the second half was for the second coming of Christ and Jesus Christ yesterday today and for unchanging in all his ways then the way he ushered in his first coming a prophet in the spirit and power of Elijah then the prophecies tells us that at the second coming of Christ that there would have to be a prophet the spirit and power of el to once again remind us of all the changes that were made for God's people the first coming it's not a different word same word the promises they were lost through the were lost when the Roman Catholic Church rised up took the Bible away from the people they had no book to read so how did they manage they had revelation of a plan that was in the mind of God you see it and today it still takes a revelation like Peter had and the father gave it to him and the father is still practicing to get close to his children and give you a revelation of his Plan of Redemption for you you see this book is personal this book wasn't written for for groups this book is written to individuals and you've got to take and reach out by faith and say this book is my book this Plan of Salvation is my plan you've got to own it and make it what was what was being preached Mo Moses and the law was about to change no more law John had come at the end of the Jews ages Daniel had spoken that the Jewish people had 70 weeks accomplished unto them and at the time of when Jesus came those prophetic weeks were counting [Music] down and when Jesus had come there was one week left for the Salvation of Israel Jesus preached for three and a half years he fulfilled the first half week and when he did Israel rejected the Plan of Salvation Israel rejected the Lamb's Book of Life Israel rejected Redemption and when they did they crucified him in the midst of the week and and God's timetable for Israel stopped and the Lamb's Book of Life and the Plan of Redemption was given to another people a gentile people on the day of pentec at the cross of Calvary when Israel rejected this seven seal Plan of Redemption then the plan came to you and I salvation came to you and I then the then then the opportunity to be born again came to you and I then the possibility to live a life worthy of the Gospel you and I that's what Israel rejected that's what we have received and when God takes a little bride off this Earth who been fully redeemed then Jesus messah the Bible tells us goes back to Israel and he reveals himself he appears unto them he shows them his hand hands they say where did you get that in the house of my friend then revelation will strike their hearts they realize that just Jesus of Nazareth it was their lord God made flesh it was their savior the Bible says to sackcloth and Ashes weeping understanding what their ancestors did C the Revelation and receive Jesus salvation and Redemption for the Fig Tree God rich in Mercy the law and the prophets were until John John was the beginning of a new ministry a new message and once he came out of the Wilderness he never went back again again as did the Old Testament prophets the Old Testament way had changed now it was a new testament made in Matthew 11:14 it says and if you will receive it this is Jesus speaking in Matthew 11:14 and if if you will receive it this is Elias which was for to come I thought John was a voice crying in the wilderness he was but now Jesus is telling us taking us to another prophecy identifying John again and if you will receive it this is Elias which was for to come Jesus is now including John in the scripture of Malachi 4 and6 for Malachi 46 is his first coming but it's also his second coming just like Isaiah 61 verse 1 and two if you'll remember in the Book of Luke in chapter 4 the Bible says Jesus was back in Nazareth and he went to the synagogue on a day of worship as was his custom and when he went into the synagogue the Bible tells us that the priest handed him the scroll of Isaiah and Jesus took that scroll and he began to unfold that scroll and he finally stopped at a now remember they didn't have books as we have today no it was a scroll it was a paper that's all rolled up it was animal skins of some kind and they would write messages in there and the Old Testament was written like that and the book of Isaiah was one long scroll that could reach from that wall to this wall and when they handed Jesus that scroll in that scroll that would go from wall to wall he knew just where to open it to he knew just where he wanted to read from and he stopped in the prophecy of Isaiah 61 and he read the first half only and he stopped and he said this day this something that had been written 7 800 years ago that day in the lives of those people in that Church of Nazareth that day prophecy was becoming history oh but they didn't recognize their day they didn't recognize that and Jesus stopped in the middle of the verse because the second part was for his second coming and Malachi 46 is the same it's a prophecy of first and second coming and what divides this prophecy is a Comm so what would it take to understand that in one verse his first and second coming a revelation by the Holy Spirit showing you that the comma represents a difference of 2,000 years God rich and mercy in Matthew 11 Jesus said father I thank you that you've hidden these things from the wise and prudent and will reveal it unto babies such as would learn he didn't mean little babies little children he meant adults who could now be born again of the spirit of CH Christ and receive spiritual understanding of this word of God not only had the message changed from law to Grace John's Ministry had changes in it also John fulfilled Isaiah 40 John fulfilled Malachi 3125 John fulfilled Malachi 45 and six the first [Music] half and in none and in none of these scriptures was John's name mentioned when he came upon the earth when he was born when at the age of eight nine years old the Holy Spirit took him to live Into the Wilderness because his because his ministry would be so important that he couldn't afford to let John to get involved without huge Jewish denomination for they had all the word twisted up they had the writings of the prophets but they had no Revelation John the Holy Spirit was going to take him wildness to give him what no man could give him a revelation of this Lamb's Book of Life that brings change to you and I that helps us to be better parents better fathers better wives better Sons had I been born again when I was just a young man I wouldn't have brought so much anguish upon my parents so much trouble wouldn't have brought the police knocking on their door had I been born again when I was just a boy so to the young people I say as Jesus said to Nicodemus though Nicodemus wasn't a young man he was an old man he said Nicodemus you must be born again that for Nicodemus was a great Challenge and a great change it was Jesus speaking in a parable it wasn't literal Nicodemus took it literally I must be born again how can I go back into my mother's [Music] womb you realize I'm 68 years old who's ever done that before what kind of a Preacher are you he said Nicodemus unless you're born again you cannot see the kingdom of heaven but if you want to see the kingdom of we're stopping here at this spot right now come Sunday and I'll tell you how do you love him as our brother comes forward whoever be taking this
