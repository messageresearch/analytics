all this morning this morning this Sunday is called Palm Sunday and it it it is in in history it is the Sunday before the resurrection before the crucifixion of Jesus Christ so would like if you turn with me to Zechariah Chapter n and verse it was a prophecy uh Zariah spoke this was anointed of God it was thus saith the Lord it would come to pass and he spoke at 500 years it sat for 500 years years and came to pass one day there in the city of Jerusalem Isaiah 9 and verse 9 Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of Zion Oh daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a cult and the fo of an ass it was a prophecy that one day the King of Kings would ride into Jerusalem and the people would throw Palms down down down before him on the road into Jerusalem and the same Palms they would take and wave them before him it was a a symbol it was a tradition in those days it's what people did when they were honoring giving respect to to to a great conqueror that was coming back home a great conqueror or they would do it to honor a king coming into the city and this truly was a king was the King of Kings he was the king of Jerusalem he was the king who would have a bride and a wife verse n again Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of Zion shout oh daughter of Jerusalem behold behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a CT the F of an ass and the prophecy sat for 500 years and the unbeliever said you see it hasn't come to pass it must not be true no no doubt they said it on a Saturday and Sunday Jesus rides into Jerusalem and a prophecy that sat for 500 years sayth the Lord it come to pass let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning we ask you to add your blessings to your word and may it not just be a story but may it be a revelation May someone believe this report and may the arm of the Lord be revealed to everyone in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated this this morning we'd like to speak on a subject of what does Jesus really look like this is as many of you know it's it's called Palm Sunday the the world celebrates it as Palm Sunday Palm Sunday was the Sunday before the crucifixion the next Sunday would be the crucifixion on on this day on a Sunday that we now celebrate as Palm Sunday on that day over 2,000 years ago the Common People heard Jesus gladly and that particular day he asked his disciples to do something for him he chose two of them he said I have a job for you to do this morning I want you to go down to such and such a corner and there you're going to find an ass and the cult of an ass and I want you to bring both of them back to me what was happening was thus sayth the Lord been spoken 500 years ago they didn't know it but they were in the vision it was happening that moment oh in this morning there's many prophecies for the Bride of Jesus Christ and if you don't know it I'm here to tell tell you that as you sit on these benches this morning sayth the Lord is unfolding oh if we had the time the future will take it to see the prophecies that are happening that are anointing us there should be anointing us that should be giving us courage that should be giving us strength prophecies oh that should be restoring the joy of our Salvation to our hearts so here they were it was Palm Sunday and Jesus the anointing came down of thus sayth the Lord of what Zachariah had said turn with me to Matthew 21 you remember the scripture it's when Jesus is riding in Matthew chapter 21 we'll start at verse one and it reads like this and when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem and were come to Beth Page unto the Mount of olive then sent Jesus two disciples two chosen men they didn't know what they were doing they they didn't understand what was going to happen that morning in the Simplicity of what they were asked to do they were fulfilling thus saith the Lord did you catch that in the Simplicity Jesus asking them there's a couple of donkeys and they're tied somewhere they're right there they're they're tied on a post at the 67th in Glendale and I want you to go untie them and bring them to me they didn't know that they were walking in the power of the spoken word SP 500 years before they thought they were just doing something nice they they they said well if we find them um who are they it doesn't matter who they are but the owner will come out and he'll say what are you doing with my donkeys you tell him the master has need of them you won't you don't know him he doesn't know you but you tell him the master has need of them and he'll smile SM and he'll say of course take it was [Music] Supernatural they were walking into a supernatural scene and none of them knew it they couldn't even feel it perhaps they just thought it's something strange oh maybe you feel it's something strange this morning walked into a scene predestinated before the foundation of the world the Holy Spirit wants to speak to your heart he wants to share something with you thus sayth the Lord for a need you have or something you're struggling with sickness something tormenting you this morning the king wants to walk into your life verse two he sends two of his disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straight way you shall find an ass tide and a cold with her loose them and bring them unto me so now the word is unfolding and Jesus is adding [Music] details that Zachariah didn't speak of that's the way prophecy works you can't take just one prophecy put a period on it and then say what it means or what you think it means Bible prophecy interprets Bible prophecy you add prophecy upon prophecy word upon word line upon line that's how God interprets his own word so now Jesus is adding detail to the prophecy of Zariah that's unfolding here part of the prophecy was that Zechariah didn't say was that this man Jesus would send two disciples to go get those two donkeys part of the prophecy what Jesus added that they would go to the Village next to them which Isaiah didn't mention so this was Jesus now this is Jehovah this is the creator of heavens and earth adding more detail to the prophecy and he said unto them and if any man verse three say ought unto ye you shall say the Lord hath need of them and straight way he will send them how can you just get up one morning and the Holy Spirit anoints you to go somewhere and go and speak to someone and then and them fulfill a need that you have and and and they thus sayth the Lord God ordained it in your life before the foundation of the world you go because he sends you but you don't know what's happening next but if God is in the mix it's because he's going to bring something to pass and verse four it tells us why all this was happening it says all this was done the two disciples the two the two donkeys going off into a little village somewhere what was the purpose what was anointing this to happen all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Z who said tell ye the daughter of Zion Behold thy King cometh unto thee like no other king is Meek sitting upon an ass and the cult of an ass and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them even though they didn't understand even though they didn't remember the prophecy of Zechariah verse seven says and they brought the ass and the cold and put and put them and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon they decorated it they decorated as when a king or a great conqueror his horse comes decorated with beautiful robes and then this conqueror this King rides into the city with it and the disciples anointed of God not knowing why they took off their robes and they draped it over this donkey they said Lord now you can ride on it on it Andrew said to John why' you do that I don't know it just seemed like the right thing to do have you ever done anything that seemed like the right thing to do and it was it was God anointing you to bring something to pass in your life never be afraid of doing something that'll help someone because it's God anointing no they might say it's none of your business what if they don't like at me helping them oh put away the feeling of rejection and be anointed of the Holy Spirit do something for a fellow member of the Bride of Jesus Christ verse six says and the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them there's many things and Commandments in the Bible that Jesus has given you do them do them stand for his word never be ashamed of the Gospel do good and not evil separate yourself from all the things of this world from the dirty filthy music from the inmod dress tight clothing earrings strange ha strange hair dudes I'm talking to the men right now yeah tattoos tattoos if you've got one don't get two if you've got four don't get five you see what I'm saying and if you have them God has washed you but if you can't stop getting them it's the mark of the serpent you don't want that Mark that Mark is death Hallelujah the Bible says verse verse S they brought the ass in the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and straw them in the way and the multitudes multitudes is thousands of people that went before and that followed behind they cried saying hosana to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lordana in the highest oh they were honoring him because he's our King because he's our healer Our Savior they'd been in his meetings they had seen the blind see they had seen the lame walk so to throw their coats down so he could walk on them was an honor for those people the Common People heard him and loved him but the church people hated him the common people loved him but the church people crucified and when he was come verse 10 unto Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee those that were lifting him up those who weren't to ashamed of publicly praising and worshiping him they knew who he was but those in the city those in the churches they didn't know him who is this man man that you're lifting up on high it's Jesus of Nazareth oh no don't you mean William brandham oh William Bram no we don't mean William brandham no no we don't mean the Apostle Paul we don't mean the Apostle Peter God bless every Godly Man Minister that has given their life for the gospel but there is only one mediator between you and God that's the man Christ Jesus that's the Holy Spirit who's here this morning the one who's wanting to turn your hearts back to Jesus back to Christ to our Lord and Sai am and the multitude said verse 11 this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee and Jesus went into the temple of God and the Pharisees received him and the Pharisees received him and he preached them a wonderful sermon no he didn't he was done he had enough of what they had done in the church he wasn't going to preach them a sermon he was going to live them a sermon and Jesus went into the temple and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and over through the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves he set the doves free because there was doves in the house of God that men had put into [Music] bondage there was Lambs in this house of God that were in cages and Jesus said no one in my house will be in a cage no Dove of mine no Dove of mine no no lamb of mine will sit in What's called the house of God and be a prisoner to men and he come and he turned over the table he opened the cages he set the doves free he let the ls go outu and he said unto them as he's bringing freedom to doves to Lambs of God to his people why did he do it because it was written my house shall be called The House of Prayer not a house of debate a House of Prayer not a house of sin not a house of buying and selling my house will be a House of Prayer did you know God wants you to be his house did you know that you are a temple of the Holy Ghost don't buy and sell in that Temple don't let doves and Lambs be in bondage in that Temple verse 13 and he said unto them it's written my house shall be called The House of Prayer but you the evangelists but you the pastors but you the apostles but you the prophets but you the teachers you have made it a and of Thieves no wonder a prophet said there'll be a lot of ministers that won't make it that'll wind up in a lake of fire instead of God's Millennium because of what they have done to the doves to the Lambs of God verse 14 and the Blind and the lame came to him in the temple because he had lived them a sermon instead of preaching one that day and the Blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them that's what the temple was for not for selling not for buying not to make merchandise of the people but that God's people could come in that he might heal the lame that he might give the blind sight that he might give those that are depressed joy that he could take away the arrogance from some and give them a spirit of meekness so that you could come to God's house and learn that you can be a peacemaker in your home it doesn't have to be a home where you fight with your sons and daughters all day it shouldn't be it should be a temple it should be a house of prayer you say you you you mean the church here brother Daniel no I mean your home I mean your apartment I mean the car that you drive in and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things he did verse 15 and the children crying in the temple oh it was a holy ghost that place had turned into a holy ghost meeting the blind were seen the lame were walking the sad had their Joy restored to them children were crying and repenting saying hosana to the son of David and the Pharisees and the scribes and the evangelists and the pastors and the apostles the prophets and the teachers of this denomination were sore displeased verse 16 ver and when Jesus discerned their hearts that that seen the goodness of God made them angry he said unto them hearest thou what these say and Jesus saith unto them yay have you never read aren't you reading your Bibles aren't you meditating on the scriptures night and day aren't we on our knees asking for [Music] Revelation he says have you never [Music] dead out of the mouth of babies and sucklings thou has perfected praise oh Lord the message this morning what does Jesus really look like what does Jesus really look like Jesus had a five full ministry it's the five full ministry of Jesus Christ and his ministry also includes a many membered body the ministry of Jesus Christ is not just the pastor it's not just the prophet it's not just the Evangelist teacher but it's the entire body of Jesus Christ if Jesus has a fightful Ministry it's because he has someone that he wants to help for you to grow unto the stature of a perfect man Jesus Christ is a Fountain of Life Jesus Christ is a fountain of Ministry Jesus Christ is a fountain of Joy Jesus Christ is a fountain of peace Jesus is the Fountain of Love he's the Fountain of longsuffering he's a fountain of gentleness he's a fountain of goodness he's a fountain of Faith Jesus Christ Our Lord is an inexhaustible Fountain he had certain characteristics that he displayed Jesus was a prophet Jesus was Apostle Jesus was a teacher Jesus unfolded the work as an evangelist Jesus was Pastor turn with me to acts 3:22 in the book of Acts Acts chapter 3 Bible readers you'll remember it and beginning at at at verse 22 it was the day of Pentecost and Peter anointed of the Holy Spirit was unfolding and bringing great Revelation to the people it says and he said for Moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people that Prophet is Jesus yay and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have like why for told of these days then Peter said ye are children of the prophets and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers saying unto Abraham in thy seed shall all the K of the earth be blessed unto you first God having raised up his son Jesus sent him to bless you in in turning away every one of you from his iniquities Jesus alone Jesus alone can turn you from your iniquities no man can do that God can use men but it wasn't the man that turned you if your heart was turned it's a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit here Jesus tells us this Prophet is Jesus in Hebrews chapter 3 Jesus's prophet Hebrews chapter 3 beginning at verse one the Apostle Paul once again a great man of God he wrote almost half of the New Testament he wrote it but he didn't make it up no God told told him what to say to write because it was God's word verse one wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession who is it Christ Jesus so Jesus Peter said he's a prophet Paul said he's Apostle he he he is Apostle and high priest of our profession he's Prophet so Jesus is both Prophet Apostle long before anyone else could fulfill these Ministries Jesus these are the ministries of Jesus Christ in St John chapter 3 St John chapter 3 you remember the story Jesus goes to Nicodemus uh Jesus goes and in and in verse one of John 3 Bible says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night you know why he came because the Holy Spirit pulled him it may have looked to people like he went to Jesus no doubt he thought about it day after day weeks passed months passed finally something gave him the courage it was the Holy Spirit that gave him the courage has there ever been something in your life that you know you knew you had to make right with somebody and days passed and weeks pass and it won't leave you maybe a year passed and you say no I can't take it no more finally you go and ask for forgiveness because it was God that pulled you finally it was the spirit that gave you the courage that you didn't have within that was Nicodemus verse two says the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know me and other rabbis me and other denominational preachers me and other me other pastors in the message we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can these Miracles th doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him oh well thank you I'm glad you can recognize my Ministry and and how great I am how great I am he didn't say that he didn't have time to waste words he knew who he was what he wanted that morning he wanted Nicodemus to recognize who he was and the opportunity that laid before him of a born again experience of a refilling of the Holy Ghost he wanted Nicodemus to see what was before him the opportunity he had this morning Jesus answered and said unto him verely verely I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingom who was Jesus a teacher Peter said he's a prophet Paul said he's a chief Apostle Nicodemus said he's a teacher Prophet Apostle teacher Matthew chapter 4 and verse 12 now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee the ministry of Elijah the Forerunner had ended he was going off the scene God was successful in the ministry of the first Elijah and when that first Elijah went off the scene it's because he had done everything God wanted him to do now maybe John had things he wanted to do but God said no it's over it's done you have done everything I wanted you to do Elijah I'm taking you home now and the pattern of the first Elijah at the first coming is the pattern of the second Elijah at the second coming because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's unchanging in all his ways if Jesus God was successful in the ministry of John the Baptist first Elijah because it wasn't John's it wasn't John in control God in control of John then God was successful again coming in the second Elijah's Ministry to introduce the Lamb of God Jesus Christ to us and when and when the second Elijah went off the scene killed in an automobile accident in December 19 1965 it's because God in control of all things amen had his Prophet say everything he wanted him to say and if we're still not understanding what that Prophet said we don't need him to come back we need Jesus to come to us and reveal to us what he said through the mouth of a prophet or else we break the pattern of God's word because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so when John went who did the poor people have to lead them Jesus and when William brandham left who did all these poor people us have to lead us you and I who will lead us the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ the Lamb of God the one who died on the cross of Calvary for you and me Matthew 4 and verse 12 now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee you know why John was finally cast into prison because God allowed it CU he was going to take him home he had said everything that he wanted him to say he had suffered long enough in his short life of 30 years and God was taking him home verse 13 and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of Zebulon and nephthalim all this was happening John going off the scene being cast in prison was going to be beheaded Jesus was beginning his ministry and it was all happening happing verse 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebon and the land of Naim by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time Jesus began to preach to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and Jesus began his ministry as an evangelist praying for the sick calling soul to come and repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Jesus J Prophet Propet Apostle AP teacher evangelist turn with me to First Peter first Peter chapter 5 and we'll be begin reading at verse one and it says like this the Apostle Peter Apostle Prophet the elders which are among you I exhort it was a calling that few men had it was a calling and that was an elder who God would use to exort Elders it says who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a part partaker of the glory that shall be revealed he's saying there's great Revelations coming because Jesus died was buried and he is risen and he's opening the Lamb's Book of Life to us he's Ling the seals that have it shut he's opening our blinded eyes and giving us understanding so that we can know what he once done with his word verse two feed the flock of God which is among you who is Peter speaking to to the elders don't make mer merchandise of the flock don't be a dictator over the flock don't tell them where to live and what to do and where to go no tell them you're praying for them that if they think they have to go somewhere else you'll be praying for him that God takes them where he wants them to be for a pastor to tell you you can't leave here you can't go nowhere you got to stay right here that's a dictator you know a prophet said that he said I'm not a dictator to tell you where to live and where to go you ask God to lead you and I'll pray that the leading of the Holy Spirit comes to your life but today men practice they've actually been practicing for the last 7,000 years men controlling people Cain when he realized he couldn't control Abel he killed him men in their pulpits today when they realize they can't control you they try to kill your testimony it's been happening for 7,000 years you say why do they do that brother Daniel because even though they're in the Pulpit they're not in Christ ministers not all of them have been born again ministers not all of them have the baptism of the Holy Ghost how will you know them because they'll feed the flock of God Peter said to them speaking to the elders in verse two of Peter 5 feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight there of not by constraint but willingly not for filthy looker in other words don't be a minister because you're gonna because you're GNA make a lot of money doing it don't do it he said don't do it for the money do it cuz you're called of God feed the flock of God to make the house of God a House of Prayer not a den of Thieves and the larg and the biggest thieves are in the pulpits not for filthy ler but of a ready mind neither as being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock and when the chief Shepherd shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fth not away Peter in the book of Acts he said Jesus was that Prophet Paul in the book of Hebrews he said Jesus was our Apostle Nicodemus in the Book of John he said Jesus we know thou art a teacher come from God in Matthew 4 Matthew writes down the ministry of an called Jesus of Nazareth and Peter tells us here Jesus he's the chief Shepherd so the five full ministry was the was the gifts that God sent down from his very own lifeu so God has taken his five full ministry it's the characteristics of his nature that he manifested when he first opened the Lamb's Book of Life you know he was also the Lamb of God you know what book he was was opening he was opening his book to us so if the lamb is opening his book to us then isn't that the Lamb's Book and if his life isn't his book A book of life so isn't that the Lamb's Book of Life then turn with me to Revelations chapter one chapter 6 excuse me Revelations chapter 6 and verse one it's it's known to Bible readers as the first seal and the first seal is part one of seven parts that reveal to us the Lamb's Book of Life so it's the Lamb's Book of Life that was sealed with Seven Seals those seven seals are seven Parts unfolding A Plan of Salvation of redemption of how you can be justified by faith how you can be Sanctified by the spirit how you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost how all the these three things is the Born Again experience how then after this Born Again experience you can be a son and daughter being adopted to be to be Eternal as imperfect as the father is imp perfect oh that's what these Seven Seals held that's what these seven parts were all about it was it's about getting you back into his presence living daily in his presence being sensitive to his presence saying Lord I need more of you so now I realize to get more of you then I have to give you more of me I need more of him I'm not going to get it if I don't give him more of me I need more time on my knees I need more time asking him for Revelation to feed the flock of God I need to be led of his spirit I need to be a better husband to this fine little lady that she you know where the answer lays in the revelation of these Seven Seals and we're not waiting for these seals to be open we're waiting for this word of God to be revealed to me and each and every one of you Jesus Apostle AP Prophet propeta teacher evangelist evangelist these are the attributes and fivefold characteristics of the very nature of God it was to restore Fallen man it was how how to teach us how to act in his presence so we wouldn't grieve him not here in the church building oh no we all behave ourselves here but when you get home when you're with your husband when you're with your wife when you're with your children it's there in the those moments that's when we need to learn not to grieve him and he wants to teach us how not to grieve him if you want it and he wants it he wants to teach us how to act in his presence so we won't grieve him when he the holy spirit is wanting to pour out rivers of Living Waters to wash us with the washing of the water of his word and to do this he uses these five trumpets in our lives this fivefold ministry to sound an alarm that the devil as a roaring lion who seeking to devour you God wants to bring you to a son and daughter passing through the rights of adoption even as Peter said Peter in second Peter 1 verses 1 to 10 you go back and read it when you have a chance but God is a fountain of ministry Minister not only five Ministry but nine spiritual gifts an innumerable helps in the body as Paul spoke of in 1 Corinthians 12 in Romans 12 in Ephesians 4:11 Apostle Paul said this Ephesians 411 we'll be closing with this scripture and continue in the next service and Paul said and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers he gave some because some of them he didn't give some are Impostors imp some are unjust stewards some are liars the Bible says in Revelations 2 2 and two in the Ephesian Church age he says I Know Thy works and thy labor Revelations 22 and thy patience and how thou can not bear them which are evil you cannot bear them which are evil he's telling the church who are these evil ones and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and and has found them Liars they asked brother brandom a question can the church test the Ministry he said oh yes you know how by the word by the word these evil ones were right in the church and they were Apostles or so they said they were but by the word the church at Ephesus found them to be Liars instead of those that feed the flock instead of those that feed the flock they were making merchandise of the flock they had the Love of Money and not the love of God Jesus doesn't look like that I see as we stand our feet thank you for your attention let's pray Heavenly Father celes we thank you once again thank you for the attent the attention of your little flock each and everyone and may you reward them with Revelation with courage with the love of God in their hearts and may they be able to turn away from all iniquity and give you more more of themselves we ask all this now in Jesus name amen amen God bless you all as our brother would come to take
