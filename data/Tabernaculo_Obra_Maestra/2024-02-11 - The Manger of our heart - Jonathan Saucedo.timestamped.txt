[56:20] him not me not a
[56:23] man but to hear him
[56:26] we can all stand
[56:28] up amen my thought here this
[56:32] morning brother Kenny was singing a
[56:35] song and I know in the lyrics it said
[56:38] the major of our
[56:42] hearts and that whole song when it began
[56:45] to speak about the major of our
[56:50] heart something happened inside
[56:53] me amen amen because I
[56:57] recognized that that
[57:00] major those
[57:02] tables it represented
[57:04] sin you see that major it was
[57:08] filthy all the animals were in
[57:11] there they were pooping on the
[57:16] ground and our Lord he didn't have a
[57:19] roof over his
[57:21] head am man it could have been cold
[57:26] amen but yet he was born in a
[57:30] major and now we have a
[57:32] major there's a major in our hearts here
[57:36] and Jesus came and he went into a
[57:39] major
[57:41] amen that's why that
[57:46] song Amen he came to the
[57:49] maor went to the cross and came inside
[57:53] us you believe that that this
[57:56] morning we can turn to
[57:58] Revelations 3 and verse
[58:16] 20 and we can bow our heads for a word
[58:19] of
[58:20] prayer Heavenly Father Lord

[59:39] 3:20 it says behold I stand at the door
[59:43] and knock and if any man will hear my
[59:45] voice and open the door I will come in
[59:48] to him and will sub with him and he with
[59:53] me
[59:59] you may have your
[1:00:00] seats you see us up with him that means
[1:00:03] to have
[1:00:06] Fellowship to have communion
[1:00:10] individual before in the Old
[1:00:12] Testament you see when the children of
[1:00:15] Israel when they were in the land of
[1:00:17] Egypt you know many plagues had
[1:00:20] happened God was showing that there was
[1:00:22] a
[1:00:23] difference
[1:00:25] they in the Egypt they believed in their
[1:00:28] gods and then one day we'll get into
[1:00:31] that now each one of those
[1:00:35] plagues if you look back in and and you
[1:00:38] dig into
[1:00:40] there um they they represent a God that
[1:00:43] they
[1:00:44] serve and at the end the death angel
[1:00:49] comes God gave a commandment to his
[1:00:52] children they had to get a lamb
[1:00:56] that lamb couldn't have a spot or
[1:00:59] blemish cuz that Death Angel was coming
[1:01:01] to go to all the firstborn
[1:01:05] babies amen the boy
[1:01:08] babies but they had to keep they they
[1:01:11] had to they had to get everybody
[1:01:14] inside amen all the firstborn
[1:01:18] baby amen they had to get everybody
[1:01:23] inside had to apply the blood of Jesus
[1:01:25] Christ on the
[1:01:29] doorpost that blood represented Jesus
[1:01:32] Christ that door was Jesus
[1:01:35] Christ when they got behind the
[1:01:37] door when they got behind the
[1:01:40] blood they were getting behind the Lord
[1:01:43] Jesus
[1:01:45] Christ but everybody that was outside of
[1:01:47] the
[1:01:48] blood outside of that
[1:01:51] protection amen that Death Angel was was
[1:01:54] going to come then when it came the time
[1:01:57] to The
[1:01:58] Exodus amen God was bringing his
[1:02:01] children
[1:02:02] out he brought them a message and in
[1:02:06] Exodus
[1:02:08] 13:21 amen the Lord says that he went
[1:02:12] before them in the day in the pillar of
[1:02:14] a cloud and to lead them in the way and
[1:02:17] by night in the pillar of a fire to give
[1:02:19] them light to go by day and
[1:02:23] night
[1:02:31] and he took not away the pillar of cloud
[1:02:33] by day nor the pillar of cloud By Night
[1:02:36] from before the
[1:02:42] people how amazing it is that when they
[1:02:44] went through the
[1:02:46] Exodus God was on the front of them and
[1:02:49] the Lord was behind them watching them
[1:02:50] guiding
[1:02:53] them
[1:02:54] had not matter if the person behind was
[1:02:57] a very old
[1:02:59] person maybe they couldn't walk
[1:03:02] good but see when that pillar of cloud
[1:03:04] was
[1:03:06] there when that Pillar of Fire was
[1:03:09] there no matter how much of the army of
[1:03:12] pharaoh was
[1:03:14] there behind
[1:03:16] them each and every one of those people
[1:03:18] had a
[1:03:20] cross because God was bringing them
[1:03:23] out and one of those not one of the
[1:03:27] enemy could have touched even the one
[1:03:29] behind in the very behind of the
[1:03:32] line why because Jesus Christ was
[1:03:35] watching
[1:03:36] them he was guiding them and then they
[1:03:41] cross and the waters was closed on
[1:03:43] Pharaoh's
[1:03:45] Army they started to get a tambourine
[1:03:47] they started to
[1:03:49] worship and it was amazing amen that was
[1:03:52] a miracle but you see then things
[1:03:55] started to
[1:03:57] happen they were they get to a place
[1:03:59] where where there's bitter
[1:04:02] Waters they couldn't drink the water
[1:04:05] they started to murmur against
[1:04:07] Moses and you know Moses was the type of
[1:04:10] Christ many people M murmur against
[1:04:13] Jesus Christ this
[1:04:15] day maybe they don't say it in their
[1:04:18] mouth but many times things can happen
[1:04:20] to
[1:04:22] us and we go around saying Lord why Lord
[1:04:26] why but see in that time when they seen
[1:04:29] the waters were
[1:04:31] bitter if they had seen what God did
[1:04:34] before if they realized God can do that
[1:04:39] again it wouldn't matter if those Waters
[1:04:41] were
[1:04:42] bitter it wouldn't matter what they
[1:04:44] could see with their natural
[1:04:47] eyes because they know that the god am
[1:04:51] man that could protect him through that
[1:04:52] whole way out of of Egypt
[1:04:56] is the same God that can change these
[1:04:58] Waters to be
[1:05:01] purified amen then they got to a
[1:05:04] point where they they said it'd be
[1:05:08] better if we were in
[1:05:11] Egypt oh we could have ate good in
[1:05:14] Egypt see there were slaves in
[1:05:17] Egypt see God promised them a
[1:05:21] land and they wanted to go back to to
[1:05:23] the worldly
[1:05:26] life they wanted to look
[1:05:28] back when God's promise to
[1:05:31] them was before not
[1:05:34] behind amen amen and they wanted to go
[1:05:37] back the Egypt never left their
[1:05:40] mind and each time the Lord kept doing
[1:05:43] things for
[1:05:45] them doing things for
[1:05:48] them amen even there was a time they
[1:05:53] seen everybody else had a
[1:05:55] king amen they wanted a king
[1:05:58] too says they wanted to be just like the
[1:06:03] world and the Lord told Samuel tell him
[1:06:06] that this king would he would be over
[1:06:10] them he'll make your daughters
[1:06:14] Cooks amen he'll he'll send your
[1:06:16] children to
[1:06:17] battle but it didn't matter they still
[1:06:19] wanted a
[1:06:20] king but he told
[1:06:23] Samuel to their voice but they didn't
[1:06:26] reject you
[1:06:27] Samuel they reject me and all throughout
[1:06:31] that time they rejected
[1:06:34] him then comes to Exodus
[1:06:42] 338 it says and it came to pass when
[1:06:46] Moses went out unto the
[1:06:51] Tabernacle that all the people rose up
[1:06:54] up and stood every man at his tent door
[1:06:56] and looked after Moses until he was gone
[1:07:00] into the
[1:07:07] Tabernacle and it came to pass as Moses
[1:07:10] entered into the Tabernacle a cloudy
[1:07:12] pillar descended and stood at the door
[1:07:15] of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked
[1:07:16] with
[1:07:22] Moses and all the people saw the cloud
[1:07:25] cloudly pillar stand at the Tabernacle
[1:07:28] door and the people rose up and
[1:07:30] worshiped every man at his
[1:07:39] tent ain't this
[1:07:41] something how the Lord would come down
[1:07:45] he would talk to his servant
[1:07:46] Moses but yet all those people had to
[1:07:49] stand at the tent
[1:07:51] door maybe they had to see from afar off
[1:07:55] and they had to stay right there
[1:07:57] behind but does the scripture say he
[1:08:01] tells
[1:08:02] Joshua Joshua I'll be with you as I was
[1:08:04] with
[1:08:06] Moses amen then he tells a
[1:08:10] Believer amen and not only will I be
[1:08:12] with you I'll even be in
[1:08:15] you you see before they had to stand
[1:08:19] from
[1:08:21] afar they were looking at their tent
[1:08:23] door
[1:08:26] watching the Lord come down and talk to
[1:08:28] his
[1:08:29] servant but see they had to look from
[1:08:33] afar but see God wanted to have
[1:08:35] communion with
[1:08:36] them and they rejected it you see it
[1:08:40] came to the
[1:08:41] Gentiles amen amen and no more we would
[1:08:44] have to look from
[1:08:46] afar we didn't have to we wouldn't have
[1:08:48] to stand outside of our
[1:08:51] doors we wouldn't have to look to see a
[1:08:53] cloud fall
[1:08:56] down because this time Jesus wants to
[1:08:58] dwell in the
[1:09:01] heart amen but the Bible says that
[1:09:04] behold I stand at the door and
[1:09:08] knock amen amen Jesus wants to come
[1:09:11] inside the
[1:09:13] door he wants to come and
[1:09:17] commune to have
[1:09:19] Fellowship we seeing the children of
[1:09:21] Israel amen he wanted to eventually go
[1:09:25] inside of their
[1:09:27] hearts but they rejected it but see God
[1:09:31] knew that there was going to be a people
[1:09:32] that he could dwell
[1:09:35] in that he could come inside
[1:09:38] in and he would tell them you don't got
[1:09:41] to look from a far off
[1:09:43] anymore because I'll come inside your
[1:09:47] heart amen amen I won't just speak to
[1:09:51] the messenger of that
[1:09:52] hour but I'll speak to you
[1:09:56] directly cuz Moses was a messenger of
[1:09:59] that
[1:10:00] hour amen but see brother Brandon was a
[1:10:02] messenger of this
[1:10:04] hour but see he wants to come and speak
[1:10:07] to us
[1:10:09] directly inside of our prayer
[1:10:12] closets amen when we're in a desperate
[1:10:16] need when we're in a
[1:10:19] desperation God wants to come down you
[1:10:22] see he wants to come down as he came
[1:10:24] down with
[1:10:26] Moses but he's coming down to our
[1:10:29] hearts before there was a
[1:10:33] tabernacle now there's a tabern not
[1:10:35] built with any man's
[1:10:38] hands but it's a temple that God dwells
[1:10:42] in before he would come down to that
[1:10:45] Tabernacle but here is the Tabernacle of
[1:10:48] God this
[1:10:50] day it's you and I we are the Tabernacle
[1:10:53] of
[1:10:54] God that he wants to come down and dwell
[1:10:58] in to tell his messages
[1:11:01] to amen amen that time when he was
[1:11:04] talking with
[1:11:06] Moses that was us
[1:11:09] amen he wants to come down and talk to
[1:11:13] us have fellowship with
[1:11:16] us Amen to give us
[1:11:20] encouragement when I see that how they
[1:11:23] had to stand
[1:11:24] outside of the tent of the
[1:11:28] door they would have to watch it from
[1:11:31] afar amen you know I started to
[1:11:35] weep and I was like thank God thank you
[1:11:38] Lord I don't got to watch nothing from
[1:11:41] afar but I can just pray and you'll come
[1:11:45] down amen he is a mighty
[1:11:49] conqueror amen it's like Rahab the Lord
[1:11:54] was knocking at her
[1:11:56] door he wanted to come and talk to
[1:11:59] Rahab and by her helping those two
[1:12:04] Messengers she was opening the
[1:12:06] latch and going and and talking with the
[1:12:10] Lord by helping those two
[1:12:13] servants amen he gave her a
[1:12:17] token while everything around her fell
[1:12:21] apart amen all the houses fell
[1:12:24] down the Walls fell
[1:12:27] down but where she dwelt nothing
[1:12:29] happened
[1:12:31] there why because there was a token
[1:12:33] covering that
[1:12:36] home amen cuz she wanted a real
[1:12:40] token I like rahab's
[1:12:43] attitude amen because she was
[1:12:45] seeking amen she wanted
[1:12:48] protection she seen that God could lead
[1:12:50] the children of Israel out of Egypt
[1:12:56] she didn't tell those two
[1:12:58] Messengers show me a
[1:13:00] miracle no but she said I've
[1:13:03] heard that there's a God a real God not
[1:13:07] a God that I pray to see Rahab she was
[1:13:11] sold as a prostitute by her by
[1:13:15] parents she was a beautiful
[1:13:18] woman am man how much complex Rahab
[1:13:21] could have built
[1:13:25] how many times men treated her
[1:13:28] bad yeah but when she seen these two
[1:13:31] servants she knew that they were from
[1:13:34] God she would pray all the time to all
[1:13:38] these the gods that they had
[1:13:40] there but they never would
[1:13:42] answer and she was tired of
[1:13:45] that she saw all these other gods
[1:13:47] weren't doing
[1:13:49] nothing but then she heard that there
[1:13:51] was a real God
[1:13:54] one that was helping his
[1:13:56] people one that was giving them
[1:14:03] breakthroughs and you know what I
[1:14:05] believe I believe when she let those
[1:14:07] servants
[1:14:09] out and when she had time
[1:14:11] alone she was crying out to the
[1:14:15] Lord she was crying out to the Lord she
[1:14:18] said oh Lord I've been in
[1:14:22] prostitution I've been all these things
[1:14:24] in my
[1:14:25] life and Lord I have a token that can
[1:14:29] protect my
[1:14:31] home amen amen why because the Lord was
[1:14:35] Knocking At rahab's
[1:14:38] Heart amen amen she was knocking at her
[1:14:42] heart amen she could have looked at
[1:14:45] those two
[1:14:46] men said I ain't even talking to you I
[1:14:49] want no nothing to do with
[1:14:52] you and helping those two
[1:14:55] men her whole house they could have
[1:14:57] killed them
[1:15:00] all but she believed that God could
[1:15:02] protect
[1:15:04] them that he will protect her and her
[1:15:08] family she wasn't thinking like oh what
[1:15:11] would happen What would this
[1:15:14] happen but she said no the
[1:15:16] Lord that brought the children of Israel
[1:15:19] from
[1:15:20] Egypt they gave me a token
[1:15:24] that when they come
[1:15:25] across nothing will happen to my
[1:15:28] house and she believed in that
[1:15:31] token amen
[1:15:33] amen but a door there was a knocking at
[1:15:36] that door of Raab rahab's
[1:15:40] heart but RAB all along in her life she
[1:15:43] had a desperation inside
[1:15:46] her searching and
[1:15:48] searching but yet when she finally
[1:15:52] met
[1:15:54] the one that can fulfill her
[1:15:57] needs the one that can take her
[1:15:59] throughout all her
[1:16:01] problems that she didn't need to be a
[1:16:03] prostitute no
[1:16:05] more but one that would free her from
[1:16:10] that amen there's a joy that touched
[1:16:13] your
[1:16:14] heart it's like the woman at the
[1:16:17] well am man she only had a a little bit
[1:16:20] of things to make some

[1:16:46] prophet
[1:16:48] first she was serving the
[1:16:50] lord am man it was the Lord first
[1:16:54] amen and you could
[1:16:56] imagine when she would pour out that
[1:16:59] oil and see that just wouldn't run
[1:17:02] out when she would make all these these
[1:17:05] cakes when she would just make and make
[1:17:08] them and it wasn't running
[1:17:11] out you see I believe she was a gentile
[1:17:15] woman amen but seeing that wasn't
[1:17:18] running

[1:17:22] existed

[1:24:43] inside amen amen he said the person on
[1:24:46] the inside must lift up that
[1:24:51] latch said that's the way it is with
[1:24:55] Jesus with all of his
[1:24:58] mercy and all of his
[1:25:00] compassion yet you are the
[1:25:04] person that has to let him

[1:25:13] latch on your
[1:25:15] side amen amen that critic said oh well

[1:25:23] you didn't put a
[1:25:25] latch you see the latch was on the
[1:25:28] inside he tells
[1:25:30] them you see that painting was Jesus
[1:25:33] knocking on the
[1:25:35] door said I don't see a
[1:25:38] latch but see that painter said the
[1:25:40] latch was on the
[1:25:43] inside that the
[1:25:45] individual has to let the one on the
[1:25:48] outside
[1:25:51] in amen
[1:25:53] and Jesus is
[1:25:55] knocking amen
[1:25:58] amen amen uh let me find out where I was
[1:26:01] at right here it
[1:26:03] says what would a man knock at another
[1:26:06] man's door
[1:26:09] for what would be the
[1:26:12] reason why it's to gain
[1:26:16] entrance is to come
[1:26:18] inside amen he wants to come
[1:26:22] he's got something he wants to talk to
[1:26:24] you
[1:26:26] about or something he wants to show
[1:26:29] you when someone knocks at your
[1:26:32] door they're wanting to gain an
[1:26:36] entrance or a little
[1:26:39] fellowship or something to talk to you
[1:26:42] about he said that's the reason why
[1:26:45] Jesus knocks at the
[1:26:49] door amen the church just shut him
[1:26:53] out they want they didn't want him
[1:26:56] coming inside and talking to
[1:26:59] them or
[1:27:02] fellowshipping because their own ideas
[1:27:04] came
[1:27:05] in they made a
[1:27:09] denomination but Jesus said I'll come to
[1:27:11] that
[1:27:13] individual and I'll come and
[1:27:17] knock amen amen and all through the
[1:27:19] church
[1:27:20] ages says here he that has an ear to
[1:27:25] listen what the spirit
[1:27:27] says amen amen now for in order to
[1:27:31] listen to what the spirit
[1:27:33] says you got to open the door for that
[1:27:36] Spirit which is a spirit of
[1:27:39] Christ amen it's not any other spirit
[1:27:42] it's a spirit of Jesus
[1:27:45] Christ
[1:27:47] amen it says uh what would you think
[1:27:51] that down through the age ages that many
[1:27:53] call um why many people while many
[1:27:58] people would come to a
[1:28:03] door he talks about
[1:28:05] Caesar and the day days of Roman
[1:28:09] Empire he said what if a foot
[1:28:13] soldier living down say in a little in a
[1:28:18] little
[1:28:20] place and somewhere where
[1:28:23] Caesar would have come from he would
[1:28:26] have came from his
[1:28:28] Palace and say he went down to that
[1:28:30] little
[1:28:33] place of his foot
[1:28:35] soldier amen where he
[1:28:38] lived and he would have knocked on that
[1:28:42] door that fo Soldier would have been
[1:28:47] thrilled he would have been
[1:28:49] happy because they're King
[1:28:53] their
[1:28:53] Emperor would have came down to his
[1:28:57] door amen and say he had opened that
[1:29:02] door you see he was knocking on that
[1:29:05] door because he wanted to tell something
[1:29:08] that man would have been so
[1:29:10] happy amen he would have said great
[1:29:15] emperor enter into my
[1:29:18] house and what whatever you see that you
[1:29:22] want it's
[1:29:24] yours he'd been thrilled to have such a
[1:29:27] privilege to entertain the Emperor
[1:29:34] of but you see it depends on the
[1:29:37] importance of that person that knocks on
[1:29:39] your
[1:29:43] door says I want to ask you
[1:29:46] something who is most who is more
[1:29:49] important to knock on your door than
[1:29:51] Jesus Jesus
[1:29:54] Christ where is there a greater person
[1:29:57] that can knock on your door than
[1:30:01] him and he's knocked on more doors than
[1:30:05] all these Kings and more than ever and
[1:30:08] has been turned away
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:17] more say many of these Kings can go
[1:30:20] knock on their servants doors
[1:30:24] brother Brown is saying that the Lord
[1:30:26] has knocked on more doors than they
[1:30:27] would ever knock
[1:30:32] on he's knocked on more doors than we
[1:30:34] ever knocked
[1:30:36] on and yet he was turned away more than
[1:30:39] anybody else
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:44] was that's a sad thing ain't
[1:30:47] it but he says behold I stand at the
[1:30:50] door
[1:30:52] Brown says he says say I come to your
[1:30:55] house and I knock at your
[1:31:01] door this one's the door to your
[1:31:04] heart and uh verse 20 says say if I come
[1:31:08] to your house and knock at your
[1:31:11] door and you give me the right hand of
[1:31:15] fellowship and told me to come
[1:31:18] in and then said stand right there
[1:31:23] don't don't you go meddling around my
[1:31:28] house don't you go check out what I have
[1:31:33] inside just stand at the
[1:31:35] door well that's about the way it is

[1:39:57] say like I'm Mr Perfect anything no this
[1:40:00] message spoke to

[1:41:10] verses talks about when the Lord is in
[1:41:13] control of
[1:41:15] you
[1:41:18] amen because when someone speaks
[1:41:20] something against
[1:41:22] when the
[1:41:24] Lord has lordship over
[1:41:28] you instead of speaking something
[1:41:31] back you get down on your knees you
[1:41:34] start praying for that
[1:41:37] individual but you see Satan comes in
[1:41:41] the
[1:41:43] midst and many times what
[1:41:45] happens when that individual speaks
[1:41:47] something bad about
[1:41:49] you say comes in the
[1:41:52] midst then you go on and talk about that
[1:41:56] individual to everybody
[1:41:58] else oh this person did this to
[1:42:01] me that person's this and that person's
[1:42:06] that instead of going to that
[1:42:09] person amen amen whether if it's a
[1:42:12] brother or a
[1:42:15] sister amen amen going to getting their
[1:42:19] hands say brother we're close to the end
[1:42:23] time I don't want nothing to do with
[1:42:26] none of this stuff that's
[1:42:28] happening you're my brother I love
[1:42:32] you it's too late for all this
[1:42:35] stuff come on let's pray together let's
[1:42:39] love each other let's forget all these
[1:42:41] diff
[1:42:43] indifferences but let's look to the
[1:42:45] Cross where we both were
[1:42:49] saved many times times that doesn't
[1:42:52] happen you
[1:42:54] see that's
[1:42:57] why we need him to be the one in control
[1:43:00] the control
[1:43:04] tower
[1:43:06] amen give him full lordship of the
[1:43:09] control
[1:43:13] tower when he's ruling in our
[1:43:17] lives where he's taking everything out
[1:43:24] amen where he's taking everything
[1:43:27] out no I thank God one of the best
[1:43:31] things that that he can give us power
[1:43:36] over is to be able to get out of the
[1:43:40] way amen healing speaking healing to
[1:43:42] existence is
[1:43:45] nice but for me I rather get out of the
[1:43:49] way I'd rather have the power to get out
[1:43:52] of the
[1:43:54] way to let Jesus in than to receive
[1:43:58] healing from my
[1:44:00] body because we can get receive healing
[1:44:02] for our
[1:44:04] body but if we Let Jesus
[1:44:07] in we receive healing for our
[1:44:11] soul what's more better to be healed the
[1:44:14] body or the
[1:44:16] soul
[1:44:18] amen this body this flesh was
[1:44:21] stay but the soul will not
[1:44:24] stay that theop will will go and will be
[1:44:31] changed and that body won't have
[1:44:35] sin represent
[1:44:37] sin amen
[1:44:39] amen what's more
[1:44:41] better
[1:44:43] amen many
[1:44:45] times people just don't open the door
[1:44:49] to when the Lord is just
[1:44:52] knocking amen he's knocking because he
[1:44:55] wants to come
[1:44:57] in
[1:44:58] Amen to have that door
[1:45:02] opened you see that
[1:45:05] latch that critic of that paint painter
[1:45:08] said that that you didn't put no
[1:45:13] latch the latch is on the
[1:45:16] inside amen amen you see there a of a
[1:45:21] parable
[1:45:23] painting there's a hidden message
[1:45:27] inside amen amen but you see the
[1:45:30] individual has to open the door to the
[1:45:33] Lord amen amen when you read that verse
[1:45:38] when you see that the Lord says behold I
[1:45:40] stand and
[1:45:42] knock and you see that he's on the
[1:45:44] outside of the door that was
[1:45:47] open amen it caused cuses you to want to
[1:45:51] surrender
[1:45:53] everything and say Lord though many
[1:45:56] people close you
[1:45:57] out I won't I'll let you
[1:46:00] in I want you to speak to me I want you
[1:46:04] to encourage me I want you to change me
[1:46:08] Lord these complexes that I
[1:46:10] have Lord come inside and take them
[1:46:13] away this attitude I have come inside
[1:46:17] and change my
[1:46:19] attitude I don't have to treat other
[1:46:21] people like
[1:46:23] this amen amen our mouth is used as a
[1:46:28] powerful
[1:46:30] weapon many people speak so bad about
[1:46:34] others and then the individuals commit
[1:46:39] suicide because of words that come out
[1:46:41] of people's
[1:46:44] mouth
[1:46:46] amen that's why we need God to come
[1:46:49] inside
[1:46:51] take control of our
[1:46:53] hearts amen that what comes out of our
[1:46:56] mouth is not us
[1:46:58] anymore amen I thank God that Paul says
[1:47:03] not more no no more that I
[1:47:06] live but it's Christ that lives inside
[1:47:08] of
[1:47:09] me that the words that I speak are not
[1:47:12] my words
[1:47:14] anymore but they're his words that speak
[1:47:17] through
[1:47:19] me amen
[1:47:21] amen thank God we all got a a race to
[1:47:26] finish we're all running this
[1:47:29] race but we have to have our hearts open
[1:47:31] to the
[1:47:34] Lord amen or we're never going to finish
[1:47:37] that
[1:47:38] race amen amen it's good to accept the
[1:47:42] Lord as our
[1:47:44] savior we have to accept him as our
[1:47:48] Lord when I I heard brother BR speak
[1:47:53] that I wanted to
[1:47:56] cry because I was like Lord there's a
[1:47:59] lot of there's things that I can already
[1:48:02] see in my life that I need to surrender
[1:48:04] to
[1:48:06] you Lord forgive me I need to make you
[1:48:09] Lord of everything in my
[1:48:12] life not just open one
[1:48:15] door and say be lordship over
[1:48:19] this and be lordship over
[1:48:22] that no but when the Lord comes inside
[1:48:25] the
[1:48:26] heart just like brother Brown was
[1:48:28] tapping when someone comes inside your
[1:48:32] house when they welcome
[1:48:34] in they're welcomed
[1:48:36] in that's how we want to welcome
[1:48:40] Jesus come
[1:48:42] inside fill at
[1:48:44] home amen amen take
[1:48:48] control you know all the things in my
[1:48:51] heart you know all the things I go
[1:48:55] through I don't want to have an attitude
[1:48:59] anymore amen amen amen there's
[1:49:03] times you
[1:49:05] see I
[1:49:07] believe that when the Lord has lordship
[1:49:10] over
[1:49:12] you you're able to say
[1:49:16] sorry amen amen I met and known people
[1:49:20] people that say they're in the message
[1:49:21] for how many
[1:49:26] years not many people but the people
[1:49:28] I've
[1:49:31] met they have a problem saying
[1:49:36] sorry when they do something and it
[1:49:39] bothered me so
[1:49:41] much why can that
[1:49:44] be because they haven't made the
[1:49:48] Lord the leader of their
[1:49:51] heart if the Lord took headship of their
[1:49:57] heart when they know they're
[1:49:59] wrong or even if the other if they know
[1:50:01] they're right and the other person's
[1:50:04] wrong they would be humble and say I'm
[1:50:09] sorry and take that other person and say
[1:50:11] forgive
[1:50:13] me amen there's times when I have a
[1:50:18] little little little say a
[1:50:24] fit if I don't
[1:50:27] agree
[1:50:28] amen when my wife is telling me
[1:50:31] something and it's something that I
[1:50:33] think that's right in my
[1:50:36] eyes later I realized that I was
[1:50:39] wrong I'll go to my wife I say you know
[1:50:42] I'm
[1:50:43] sorry forgive me you didn't deserve that
[1:50:47] and it's not
[1:50:48] right amen amen but how many people are
[1:50:51] doing that these
[1:50:53] days man how many people are forgiving
[1:50:56] truly
[1:50:59] forgiving amen someone does something
[1:51:01] bad to
[1:51:03] you someone it can be someone that did
[1:51:06] something bad that you seen that they
[1:51:09] did that was
[1:51:12] ungodly and you forgive them and you go
[1:51:15] and try to talk to them about the Lord
[1:51:17] to save them from going to
[1:51:18] hell
[1:51:22] but when someone does something bad to
[1:51:24] you knows if we
[1:51:27] forgive you know how because watch when
[1:51:31] you run into that
[1:51:33] person at the store you try to go the
[1:51:36] other
[1:51:38] way you don't want to even you don't
[1:51:40] even want to run into
[1:51:44] them you can't even you don't even want
[1:51:46] to shake their hand you don't want to
[1:51:47] say
[1:51:48] hi
[1:51:51] I've always asked myself what is
[1:51:53] forgiveness to the
[1:51:57] Lord what is love to the
[1:51:59] lord it's easier to say that we
[1:52:03] forgive it's easier to say that we
[1:52:07] love but what is it to the
[1:52:10] Lord amen amen words are
[1:52:14] words but see God doesn't look at the
[1:52:17] outward
[1:52:18] appearance he knows the very things in
[1:52:21] the
[1:52:23] heart and that should cause us to
[1:52:25] examine
[1:52:27] ourselves amen
[1:52:29] amen I believe Billy Paul Billy Paul he
[1:52:33] couldn't tell who was brother bram's
[1:52:37] enemy he just couldn't
[1:52:40] tell maybe he would know people would
[1:52:42] talk bad about his
[1:52:45] dad but he said that brother
[1:52:47] brandom we treat everybody the same
[1:52:52] that's how he carried
[1:52:55] himself couldn't be someone that talked
[1:52:57] bad about
[1:52:59] him but see when the Lord dwells in the
[1:53:05] heart when you shake someone's
[1:53:08] hand see if you ever if you ever have
[1:53:12] something with
[1:53:14] somebody it was an argument or
[1:53:17] something shake their hand
[1:53:20] and feel some kind of tension
[1:53:23] there go to that
[1:53:25] person and talk with them don't let it
[1:53:29] just go like that cuz we're brothers
[1:53:32] amen amen we're in the same
[1:53:36] body
[1:53:38] amen we have to open our door to the
[1:53:41] Lord and keep it
[1:53:43] open not just open and that Lord I'm
[1:53:46] done get
[1:53:48] out
[1:53:50] then we shut it on the door remember the
[1:53:53] door was the Lord was inside in the
[1:53:57] beginning but then he was on the outside
[1:54:01] so that means that he can be on the
[1:54:02] outside
[1:54:04] again that's why we have to continue and
[1:54:07] die every
[1:54:10] day that's why Paul said he died
[1:54:14] daily he repented
[1:54:16] daily he asked for forgiveness daily
[1:54:20] because we all come short of the glory
[1:54:21] of
[1:54:23] God so we have to pray daily so brother
[1:54:27] Brown said the best thing a Christian
[1:54:28] can
[1:54:30] do pray and read their Bible every
[1:54:34] day and then one thing I would say I
[1:54:37] even say Worship the Lord every
[1:54:41] day amen amen whether it's with a
[1:54:44] song cuz I I tell you what I could be
[1:54:48] going through a lot that day
[1:54:51] and I'll just turn on one
[1:54:53] hymn and have a
[1:54:56] breakthrough but we have to worship Him
[1:54:58] in spirit and
[1:55:00] Truth many churches these
[1:55:03] days they Worship the
[1:55:06] Lord do you see but there where's the
[1:55:10] truth they just jump and they scream and
[1:55:13] they
[1:55:14] shout running up and down the
[1:55:18] altar don't get me wrong WR I'm not
[1:55:20] against those things if it comes from
[1:55:22] the spirit of
[1:55:24] God because I believe there's there's a
[1:55:27] real and then there's a fake amen i'
[1:55:31] I've been to churches where people are
[1:55:33] running
[1:55:35] around and they're hitting each other
[1:55:38] and they're throwing things on the
[1:55:39] ground the Lord won't cause you to hurt
[1:55:43] yourself amen
[1:55:45] amen he won't cause you to hurt yourself
[1:55:49] he don't want you have a broken
[1:55:51] nose there's no way you come out of a
[1:55:53] church with a broken nose because you
[1:55:54] guys running in the
[1:56:00] spirit no amen no that doesn't happen
[1:56:04] amen
[1:56:05] amen but thank
[1:56:07] God for those that worship Him in spirit
[1:56:10] and
[1:56:11] truth I believe if there's something
[1:56:13] that ever causes you to jump and
[1:56:18] Shout because you have received
[1:56:22] Revelation from Jesus Christ and that's
[1:56:25] what caused you to jump and
[1:56:27] Shout not because people are promoting
[1:56:31] it because many churches promote
[1:56:34] it
[1:56:36] amen but because the spirit of God
[1:56:39] dwells in
[1:56:40] you amen amen we can all stand
[1:56:45] up
[1:56:47] amen amen amen than we all
[1:56:51] surrender
[1:56:53] amen it's like that song I surrender
[1:56:58] all and many churches can see that
[1:57:01] song but are they
[1:57:06] surrendering is the Lord the Lord over
[1:57:08] their
[1:57:11] hearts we got to cry out
[1:57:14] amen and said Lord take Lord lordship
[1:57:17] over my heart
[1:57:19] [Music]

[1:57:23] struggling I can't do it on my own
[1:57:27] Lord the Lord take
[1:57:30] control amen amen and you'll see what
[1:57:33] the Lord
[1:57:34] does
[1:57:36] Amen let's
[1:57:39] pray Heavenly Father Lord you are a
[1:57:45] guide a guide through this

[1:57:59] there and Lord we're here right now we
[1:58:04] go through many problems every day
