December 23rd and 24th would be uh Saturday and Sunday we will we will have our brother cosmin Stefan Stan will be ministering for us he is uh from Fort Worth Texas is the Fort Worth Texas originally from Romania but he's been in Fort Worth Texas for some time now we had met him a a couple of years ago but recently we were with him in in Congo and he also ministered there with uh with brother Rafael the church there so so his enjoyed his ministry it seems It's focused it's moving in the right direction I felt it'd be a blessing for all of us if he came and visited so Lord willing December 23rd and the 24th which is Saturday at 600 p.m. and Sunday morning morning at 10 you're all welcome and uh you're all welcome to invite somebody so as we stand to our feet tonight read from God's word as children uh at least myself growing up here in the United States from the time I was in first grade the first thing the teacher would do and she stand us she'd ask us all to stand up then she'd say put your hand on your heart and we would write uh and we would recite I pledge allegiance to the the United States of America and we would PR when we would pledge allegiance we didn't understand exactly what we were doing but but something was being placed in our hearts uh to be proud of the place that God had allowed us to live and we're still happy to be living here in these United States we've had the opportunity to travel many places and and and and and and come and meet many wonderful people people in Germany people in France people in Canada people in Congo con people in South Africa Africa Venezuela Venezuela Brazil Brazil all these different places wonderful Christian people but they don't have the privilege of living in a country that that that offers them as many freedoms and opportunities as the United States it did but all those freedoms are quickly Vanishing and Bible prophecy is coming to pass but but but the kingdom where most uh proud of saying we're a part of we're thankful to live in this nation we you it's it's the best life that a human P human beings could have so we're thankful but we are proud to be part of a supernatural Kingdom proud to be a part of a mystical body proud to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and who is the bride the bride is the wife who is preparing herself adorning herself getting the wedding dress ready for that wedding day for a great ceremonial day when the bridegroom it's on that day where he catches her away to live with him eternally so we are we are proud to be part of that kingdom kingdom of God and his Christ that's an eternal Kingdom this one will end it is ending we see it the handwriting is written on the wall judgment has been pronounced to to the world but but to the of Jesus Christ God has given her a plan to escape the wrath of the lamb and instead be the Lamb's wife and be caught away from this life to life eternal so as we read once more as we continue with this thought marriage and divorce in our day part four and and and the way we approach it this subject will be in this way in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let everything be established as you know the truth of marriage and divorce is established in the mouth of three Witnesses and if you don't bring those three Witnesses forward we will never come even close to the truth and even when we come to the full truth we we realize that the permissive will is something that that most people will will only be able to have until God takes us from this world so in first Thessalonians chap chapter 4 and once again we'd like to read the first seven verses 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse one furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God so ye would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification the will of God your holy living then he says that ye should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concupiscence even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and Def frud his brother in any matter because the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified for God ha not called us unto uncleanness yes God is good God is merciful but God has not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you bless the reading of your word to our heart you the Lamb of God are the revealer for for the book we've opened tonight is the Lamb's Book of Life so it's the lamb who will reveal it Lamb of God Open the Eyes of our understanding and tenderize our hearts to receive it in Jesus name we ask it amen amen you may be seated so as we said there are three Witnesses in this great truth and if you don't bring all three Witnesses together you'll not have the complete truth first Moses gave us an account of what he saw by vision of what God did and said in Genesis then Jesus Christ himself he spoke to us in his Earthly Ministry concerning this truth then in the form of the Holy Spirit he gives Paul a prophet and Apostle another portion and more detailed to the subject then once again the Holy Spirit comes down and he shows a prophet in our day brother William brandham how to bring all those loose ends together he wrote nothing new because the book has already been written he was just to show us and bring us the Revelation and bring these three Witnesses together so we could see the truth for we've had the Bible for hundreds of years and and and the longer we have it we have thousands of interpretations but God must have one voice to Proclaim his truth and that one voice since the beginning has been the prophets of God the prophets of God the Bible said the law and the prophets were until John and then it says and since then the kingdom of God is preached yeah the revelation of the word so God didn't put an end to the prophetic Ministry at the New Testament no no he changed the ministry he changed the style of Ministry of the prophets of a New Covenant they wouldn't be coming out of the mountain speaking judgment but they were to live amongst the people and and and preach the kingdom of heaven and and and point out where the Lamb of God was even as John did in the beginning from Genesis to Revelations the truth has always been in the Bible it simply took a prophetic gift to pull them together for the Bride of Jesus Christ and it'll take a prophetic Insight in your life to catch it Matthew 19 verse 8 and9 Jesus speaking in Matthew 19 Jesus had finished some sayings Proverbs and Parables he'd been speaking to the people praying and Healing The Sick great multitudes that followed him in this great multitude was Pharisees and Sadducees and and Priests trying to find fault with him so they asked them the great question is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause verse three and he answered them and said have you not been reading the message of the hour that he which made them from the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a manly father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh and and then he tells him what therefore God has joined together how dare you man put it aunder for any reason they said unto him well why did Moses give us a writing of divorcement to put her away he says oh yes he did didn't he mes that great prophet who who walked in the in in the Mountain of God and the fire and the lightning was up there you mean that Moses he he gave you a writing a divorcement they said yeah that's the one why did he do it then great man of God he says Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it wasn't so verse eight he saith and he says Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it wasn't so so Jesus had taken them back to the beginning Jesus was connecting scriptures Jesus was bringing the loose ends together Jesus was showing him the reason for what Moses had done in Matthew 5 Jesus said it had been said who's verse 31 it had been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorce but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery the words of Jesus the words of God and he hasn't changed his mind about his word the prophet said this scripture this question confronted Jesus at the very beginning of his ministry he said it confronted Moses at his ministry he said where whenever a question of religion comes up the marriage and divorce question comes up he says because it's the original sin so Jesus in our text invited us to go back to the beginning for the true scriptural answer but the final answer is in three parts the final answer is in three Witnesses so Jesus invites us to go back to the beginning for the true scriptural answer the priest said to him can a man put away his wife and marry another for any cause Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning Jesus had opened the book at his first coming the book he opened was the Lamb's Book of Life it it was a book on teaching us how to get back to the beginning how to get back in a friendship with the father of how to get back into the presence of God that's what the Lamb's Book of Life was about that's this new testament the Lamb's Book of Life is not an abstract thought somewhere we've had it we've carried it in our hands all our lives this new testament this is the Lamb testifying of how you and I can have the life of the Lamb yet it a fallen condition because that's what will take us back to the beginning lamb life will take us back to to to a place where the lamb will live forever with us God never did change his mind about it we read Malachi 2 where God spoke to Israel and and and and and Malachi under the anointing the prophetic anointing he he pounded the priesthood and the head of every home of Israel and Malachi 2:14 says yet ye say wherefore because the Lord have been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth because the wife of thy youth she is thy wife that's her he says the Lord has witnessed between thee and the wife of thy youth listen to Malachi speak to the men and the priest of Israel against whom thou has dealt treacherously and even though you've mistreated her yet she is thy companion not the second third fourth and fifth no the wife of thy youth she is thy companion before God and the wife of thy Covenant God didn't change his mind Malachi the prophet 400 years before the coming of Christ preparing the way so Jesus first took them back to the beginning and at the beginning there was only one pair of anything Jesus if Jesus said go back to the beginning and there was only one pair of anything on the earth there was one Adam one Eve one Eve they were joined by God Alone one female horse one male one female parrot one male at the beginning as he told us to go back there there was only one pair of [Music] anything this is true then we find out that everything in the beginning was running in perfect order and harmony with God nothing was out of cater one pair of of any species ma in for life was God's perfect order at the beginning multiple partners between male and female was not in the beginning before the fall of God's children in Genesis 3 having multiple partners is what brought the fall it's what brought sin the the serpent introduced Eve to polygamy and when she partook of this act of fornication it broke her harmony with God it broke her harmony with her husband and threw the whole world out of cater Eve through Eve by her Disobedience to the word of God all the humanity out of CER and and and and with man Fallen the animal kingdom fell out of cater and when and when the animal kingdom fell out of cater all of the all of the plant life fell out of cater what happened is death struck every everything that once had life but even more than that that that serpent mixed his seed with the seed of man and It produced a hybrid man and woman that we are today with a polygamy polygamous inclination towards [Music] fornication multiple sex partners and murders and lying that's the nature of the serpent that's in you and I today because of a sex birth that was that's the curse that's upon the human [Music] race that's why we must be born again to receive a new nature a new spirit so they can so that we can practice our courtship unto marriage in Holiness and keep a vow until death do us part otherwise you will play the dating game that that's that the serpent presented to the human race through the lust of the flesh defile in each other in filth and immorality having multiple sex partners just like all the Beast of the field just like all the animals in the forest proving once again that a man without the holy spirit is just another brute Beast so in the beginning this is what brought the fall God's children had fallen the continuity was broken the lifeline was broken the timeline was broken the Covenant was broken everything shattered The Vessel of clay Adam and Eve that the that the that the master Potter was forming he had left it for a moment and Satan came the Great Dragon and he used this Beast to shatter that clay product Eve and Adam and separate them from their God from their promise the Covenant was broken everything shattered what caused it a woman that's what broke the Covenant now if you want to read that you can read it in Genesis 3 it was then man was it was then that man was made to rule over the woman that's part of the curse that's part of the Fall she was she was now no more co-equal with her Adam she was co-equal in nature you know that's how God made them in the beginning but when she broke God's word God made a man to be a ruler over her you can read it in Genesis 3:16 and she was no more equal with the man she was the breaker of God's word that's not how God wanted it to be that's not how God made the woman in the beginning in the beginning God made Eve coequal with Adam it's what he wanted for his daughters it's what he wanted the helpmate for his son to be go equal but sin destroyed God's desire for them they broke God's word before the fall the woman was coequal in all creation and he and he made her for and he made her for man and not man for her did you know that woman was made for man and not man for woman how many knows that the Bible teaches that she was given a place in man before the fall equal over all creation but after the fall now here we bring the subject up after the fall he was now her ruler she must kept silent in all matters now after the original beginning is over and now after the fall each must have a separate Covenant they didn't in the beginning they were under one they were under one message they were under one promise man and the woman but after the fall each must have a separate Covenant but Jesus on the cross of Calvary died to take his sons to take his sons and his daughters back to how it was in the beginning you can even have that kind of relationship with your wife now it's what God wants us to go to it's the goal that he wants us to have but one day we'll be fully restored we will not wrestle with this flesh anymore we'll be free and one day in God's King again you'll meet up with your companion and you'll be coequal in the very presence of God Genesis 3:14 is God on his throne judging everyone on the earth it's a white Throne judgment it's unfolding and here in Genesis 3:14 this is where God took back the book from Adam the book yes John saw what happened here in Genesis 4,000 years later and fills in the detail that Moses didn't see that Moses didn't write and Revelations 51 because Revelations 51 was John seeing God putting Adam and Eve out of his presence with a book in his hand sealed with Seven Seals it was the plan to restore Adam and Eve as he's putting Adam and Eve out of his presence God is holding in his hand the plan to restore Resto them but before he can restore them we must be born All God's Children on the Earth but we've been compromised we can't we were not we're not coming by the spoken word now now we must come by a process that the serpent gave to Eve a slow process a fallen process an animal process and all must be born that way now that's what Eve sold us out to that's what Adam sold us out to so now God has been waiting for 7,000 years for his last son his last daughter to be born so he can take the book and put put it in their hands a book that will change them Quicken them and finally translate us back to the beginning by the power of the Holy Spirit Genesis 3 and verse 14 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field listen to The Curse the curse was upon thy belly shall thou go because he wasn't upon his belly because the serpent wasn't a reptile the serpent was a mammal the serpent was the most subtile beast of the field the curse put put him on his belly and thus sht thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put emnity between thee and the woman and between thy seed what would the Serpent's Seed be serpent seed the Bible couldn't say it any clearer I I will put enity between the serpent seed and her seed the woman seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel it was a prophecy the woman's seed would be the Original Seed it would be the spoken word seed it's how all the family of God should have come in the beginning God was tutoring Adam and Eve to bring forth the family of God even as the father had created from the dust of the earth a body for his son Adam and then called that spirit and put that Spirit into that body of clay and and Adam and Eve together should have been partakers in bringing forth the family of God by the Spoken Word by The Original Seed by watching the example of how the father did it bring forth the family of God that way the woman seed was the original seed Eve failed to get it but God made a promise my word my word shall not be returned to me void and 4,000 years passed and God chose a little lady a Virgin Mary and he chose her to be the vessel where the spoken word seed would be placed and from that spoken word seed would come forth the Son of God he would be the beginning of the creation of Sons and Daughters of God who would come by the spoken word to a supernatural birth called Born Again experience that's why Jesus said you must be born again to be loosed of the curse of this flesh birth Eve failed to get it God had provided it for them and Lucifer using the serpent said I've got a shortcut for you that'll take you where God said he would take you but I can get you there right now you don't know when God going to bring this to pass in your life do you she said no he hasn't told you has you he says well I can get you there I can make you a Creator and do it right now he didn't he twisted the promise of God he corrupted the promise of God and when Eve received it Eve was corrupted verse 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception it wasn't to be that way in the beginning it wouldn't be in sorrow it wouldn't be in pain in sorrow th shall bring forth children it was the curse it wasn't so in the beginning and thy desire shall be to thy husband because you allowed your desire to be to another man first and he shall rule over Thee the curse what fell upon the woman the woman no longer longer co-equal with a man and God changes her Covenant and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and it's this change in Covenant for the woman that now determines his permissive will for the Believers concerning how we approach marriage also divorce until we are restored to the beginning again in coequal covenants with Jesus Christ God's desire is to restore the man and the woman his son and his daughter in co-equal covenants and the devil again has approached the church he says I can get you there quicker I can get you there faster you don't have to wait that's why he's got into the churches and brought the fall of all the churches that's why fornication and adultery runs like a plague through churches because they haven't seen it's the same plan of Lucifer Satan to destroy the nation to destroy the churches to destroy the marriage covenant to destroy the family Satan desire is to destroy the family of God again but because he doesn't know who is who he's content on destroying every one of planet Earth it's the cycle we're in now wars and rumors of wars every everyone's got their finger on a bomb all over the world everyone's got their finger on a trigger all over the world men have their finger on nuclear weapons Lucifer Lu anointing the world he's the Pale Horse Rider and the pale horse rider began at the beginning of the 20th century 1900 the pale horse rider began his ride and when he began one of the first things he did was begin a World War to get that woman who is great with child called The Bride of Jesus Christ it's Revelations 12 And1 and I saw a woman that was about to Bear a child the sun was at her head that's the grace of God the moon was at her feet that's the law she stepping upon the law and living by faith she's a woman with child tells you she's a married woman she's a woman with a covenant she's bringing forth her husband's seed he's about to be born Satan wants to destroy that seed woman seed that's been placed in the womb of this bride and bringing forth Christ in her the hope of glory god here he is judging the man judging the woman judging The Serpent and now the woman in Genesis 3:16 no longer coequal with a man God changes now now for this woman it's the permissive will of God no longer co-equal no longer in a co-equal covenant with Genesis 317 and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice voice of thy wife in this tribunal in this white Throne judgment he judged The Serpent and cursed it he brings a curse upon the woman and in verse 17 now he going to deal with Adam the man and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life he didn't touch Adam in his physical body but he cursed the ground for Adam's sake he said he says thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread thou return unto the ground for for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust shalt thou go this physical body now in a fallen condition has no promise of eternal life but it's the soul the Son of God this this has been perverted this word that we see is is a fallen image these bodies are no longer in the image of God but the soul the seed that was placed that lays within the one that can be B Born Again The Flesh cannot be born again but when the soul is born again then it gives you the strength to mortify the the Deeds of this flesh to overcome the flesh desires God made the Earth his Target to receive his Wrath so that his son would not be cursed we walked on a cursed Earth thns and thistles remind us daily of the grace of God and the curse on the planet the wrath of God on every Coast on planet Earth Romans 8:22 says for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth and pain together until now and has been groaning and travailing since that day in Eden since that tribunal since Earth since God cursed the Earth for Adam's sake thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee that day on Calvary God paid the price to take away the curse the crown of thorns he wore that Crown of Thorns making us a promise that he would take away that curse the Bible says the sweat like blood ran down his face he was paying the price for that curse that today by the sweat of your brow will you eat from this cursed ground everything there was Redemption on the cross of Calvary the blood of Jesus Christ it was the seal it was the promise in the Lamb's Book of Life that he said I shall restore I shall restore all that the canker worm has eaten all that the Palmer worm has eaten all that the Locust has eaten all that these four worms have eaten from Genesis to today all these four stages of this of this Rider the white horse the red horse the black horse horse I'll take away the curse I'll take away death and place life within you Adam's Covenant did not change but his personal tutorship and adoption with and by the father had been indefinitely postponed the friendship with God had been broken he had grieved the spirit of God he walked out from behind the Seal of God when he Le when he listened to Eve a deceived Church on her shortcut on how they could be like God through their polygamous Act of fornication and adultery now polygamy is introduced not only
