reminder to continue praying for uh our brother Glenn tamlins Glen Tomlinson um God's will be done the the Physicians the doctors have pretty much told there's nothing more that they can do he still says he was believing for a miracle and uh he had one already they they were about to move him from One hospital to the next and he had a u internal aneurism [Music] bleeding and um they had to rush him into the emergency services but the hospital they were moving him to had they move had it been an hour sooner and they would have moved him that hospital wasn't prepared to deal with his emergency but because it happened there the Thunderbird Banner a yeah and Thunderbird Banner they were they had the they were a trauma 2 or trauma One hospital so they carry large supplies of of blood for surgery and that's what he was needing at the moment so they were able to stop the bleeding and pretty much give them an entire blood transfusion that was necessary but but because of the problems that that he's having the doctors have pretty much said they will not touch him for any kind of surgery he said some of the tumors or the cyst are too large it's amongst too many blood vessels and so they basically have let him know that there's nothing more that they can do so keep pray for the family remember to pray for our brother Glenn one thing we know that until that's our time to go God will keep us here but when it's our time to go the world and all its armies cannot keep you here we are in God's hands uh I thought it was my time to go just a few years ago one of the doctors felt that way too but it wasn't my time God still wanted me here and um he has a purpose he's got a purpose for each and every one of us but we do want to pray for the family um death is never an un death is always an unwelcome guess and so so there's always many human emotions that that are involved with sickness accidents and and everything else but then that's why Jesus told us it's it's it's for all those many reasons that we must be born again because that's what gives us the victory in every human situation work fun play or War we must be born again that's the key that's the secret of the mystery in Christ in us the hope of glory if you'll turn with me this morning to the Book of Matthew Matthew chapter chapter 2 and verse one contining here this morning part eight Jesus evangelist Prophet also teacher Lamb of God so in Matthew chap 2 and verse one now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him when Herod the King Herod was the [Music] self-proclaimed King of the Jews so for him to hear that some Supernatural thing was happening and bringing in a new king of the Jews the Bible says when Herod the king heard these things he was troubled he wasn't happy he wasn't excited he wasn't in great expectation great this load can be taken away from me of of of dealing with all these people he was troubled he said oh no no they're not taking my kingship away I don't care what the scripture say he says and all Jerusalem with him was troubled everyone was troubled the the Levites were troubled the high priest was trouble because this was going to change their religion this was going to take away their power and authority because in the old world when a new king came in he put to death the family of the Old King he put to death all the soldiers that weren't behind him 100% the new king would would clean the house and start all over again this was the mentality of the people then so when the Magi came and said where is he that's born King of the Jews we have come to worship the whole world Pagan and Rel and religious they said what in their mind that triggered something if this is true great change is coming and we're not ready for change the human beings are never ready for change but when God comes on the scene to keep his word to his people he's bringing change great change let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you now we give you honor and Glory ask your blessings upon the word in Jesus name amen amen turn with me to the book of Samuel 1 Samuel chapter 8 and as many of you might remember here in chapter 8 of 1 Samuel the prophet had two sons Samuel is is is an old man now and he's foreseeing the the the truth that one day soon he'll go home that death is knocking at his door but but he doesn't want to leave Israel without a leadership so in in math in Samuel 81 you may be seated in Samuel 81 it says and it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel it tells us the name of his ser first son and his second son Joel and abah the scripture goes on to tell us that his sons didn't walk in a Godly way as a matter of fact they walked in a very ungodly way they chased the money they took bribes the Bible says they perverted judgment he says and all the Elders of Israel in verse four they gathered themselves together and came to Samuel unto Rama to complain verse five says and said unto him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the king but the thing displeased Samuel when they said give us a king to judge us just like when the wise men came they said where is he that's born King of the Jews we followed a supernatural light for thousands of miles to get here to worship this King was going to be born somewhere in this land the Bible says they were troubled at it and here the people of Israel tell Samuel you're getting old you'll die soon so give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel verse 7 hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee was it something good no no and yet God said to Samuel hearken to the voice of the people and for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them so the principle being laid here in the scriptures the people thought God's Prophet is going home what will we do when he goes what are we going to do when he dies in that car accident we have nothing we can't trust in his sons we need a king or maybe we need for him to return but God said to Samuel Samuel they haven't rejected you they rejected me because when you leave the scene I was coming on the scene for them and instead they said give us a king they've rejected not you because you're leaving they've rejected me because as soon as you leave I was coming to them I would descend amongst them I would keep my word to them I'll be I'll be with you even in you to the ends of the Earth and instead they chose they wanted to go from a god- sent Prophet to a King and skip the moving of the Holy Ghost in their life because you God people in prayer in your little prayer closet you can be led of the Holy Spirit you can be changed by the power of God we don't have to live carnally and when a prophet leaves a scene it's your opportunity and mine to be sure that we've received a born again experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost God With Us God in us not a king the prophet's gone he said Sam give them the king but they jumped over something they skipped the step of what God was wanting to do the plan was Samuel when you go off the scene I'll be with the people I'll never leave them I'll be with them I'll be in them the ends of the world when the prophets leave the scene you know what you've got left church the Holy Ghost the King of Kings the king of the Jews the Bride of the bridegroom the husband and you're the wife when the prophet leaves listen verse seven again and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people and all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should Reign Over them they had a prophet Samuel they loved him they respected him they saw him getting old they knew he'd be leaving the scene soon what was to follow when he left the scene is the king would Reign Over Israel but before he could do that they told the prophet give us a king and the prophet Samuel's thinking well that's what I've been given you is a king why do you think I preach 1,200 messages so when I leave the scene you'll have a king you'll have the king of the Jews you'll have the king and you'll be the [Music] queen you'll have more than hope you'll have Divine leadership of the Holy Ghost in your life verse eight according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee from the days of Egypt they couldn't shake they couldn't shake their denominational thinking they remained carnal believers and yet they were in the message following Moses but they never understood Moses they never understood his ministry they never understood what he was trying to take him to to a land of promise where the king would be Jehovah verse n now therefore hearken unto their voice how be it yet protest solemnly unto them can show show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them a prophet in this day protested solemnly to the people because they wanted a king they wanted a denomination they're now they're wanting one world global leader they will get a king but he'll do to them and worse than what God told Samuel and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king because it wasn't 100% % of the people that wanted that it never is there's always one little percent that are saying I don't want a king I don't want a denomination I want Jesus I want a personal experience with Jesus Christ and I need it every day I need it every moment amen and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king and he said verse 11 this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you and this was the manner of Kings since since time began and this is what Kings and dictators will do when this world finally ends this is the characteristics of Kings flesh men and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you verse 11 he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots to be his Horsemen and Sh and some shall run before his chariot and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over 50s and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his Harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of Chariots that sounds like the Kings we serve today that sounds like the presidents of Nations we serve today that sounds like the prime ministers of Nations we serve today that sounds like all the global leaders of today and they're all doing the same thing because without a born again experience this is what Kings will do and verse 13 he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be Bakers and he will take your fields and your Vineyards and your Olive yards verse 14 even the best of them you've got two Vineyards one's not doing too good The Vines are dying the other ones has these marvelous Thompson grapes growing as as big as an orange and the King will say Kenny I'll tell you what I'll take this one you can keep the other one and you're supposed to like it you're supposed to say thank you King that was aw nice of you keep one of them that's what Kings do he will take your Fields your Vineyards your Olive yards even the best of them and give them to his servants his yes men and he will take the tenth of your seed verse 15 and of your Vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants and he will take your men's servants and your maid servants and your goodliest young man and your asses and put them to his work but King I actually needed that ass to to to to plow with this week too bad I want him this week Kings church leaders pastors evangelists Apostles the same mentality in their minds they become Kings they aren't servants to the people no more they have made themselves Kings watch their characteristics and he will take your men servants verse 16 and your M man servants and your goodliest young man and your asses and put them to his work and he will take the tenent of your sheep and ye shall be his servants he will not serve you you will serve him and you shall cry out in that day because because of your king which ye shall have chosen you and the Lord will not hear you in that day nevertheless the people refus to obey the voice of Samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the nations and that our King May judge us and go out before us and fight our battles but the Kings didn't always go out before them and at some point all Kings ceased to go out to battle and would send only the people would only send your young men to battle would only send your your sons to battle would only send your daughters to battle does that sound like America and Mexico and all the other nations of 2023 when politicians rise up and they say you can't talk to me that way I'll draft 10,000 young men 18 years old and I'll teach you guys a lesson and he sends them to battle Vietnam Africa Germany Israel the Middle East look what Kings do and they haven't stopped doing it since the day that their characteristics were identified Kings Apostles pastors evangelists teachers if they tell you they are then they are but watch their characteristics and you'll know who's leading them the Holy Spirit or a devil Spirit the pattern of what king are they following Kings of the Earth or King Jesus we've been following a star the wise men said and where is he that is born King of the Jews verse 20 that we also may be like all the nations and that our King May judge us and go out before us and fight our battles and heard all the words of the people he re rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord and the Lord said to Samuel hearken unto their voice and make a king and Samuel said unto the men of Israel go ye every man unto his City and as you keep reading you'll see they picked the king and you'll see the king that they picked he stood head and shoulders of above everyone big tall handsome fell seemed to have had a great start in his kingship but as all of these types of Kings he had a very bad ending and so so did Israel the Kings let's go back to Matthew Chapter 2 and verse one now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him if they only knew that this was the king that they'd always wanted if they only knew that this was the only true king that came to serve and not to be served he was born King of the Jews but he didn't run to be on a throne on the contrary this King when he came he humbled himself he was born in a humble little manger in a barn unlike most other net Kings he grew up in a place called Nazareth if we were living in Phoenix Pho we'd say this guy was born in South Phoenix Phoenix and he and he roamed around Maryville can anything good come out of these places a king was coming but this King came to serve and not to be served he had the power he could have spoke a mansion into existence but instead he was born in a manger that it might be fulfilled was spoken of the the prophets in Matthew chapter 1 it begins with the generation of Jesus Christ it comes through Abraham then it follows down and and and it goes through the tribe of [Music] Judah Abraham David the tribe of Judah they were all carriers of this Gene that was coming that would be the king of the Jews and the and the gene finally came to rest promised from from all the way in Genesis 1 this Gene had been promised it came through Abraham Matthew began following this Gene with Abraham with David with Isaac with Jacob with Judah with AB with Salon with Solomon with Uzziah with with ezekias with Josiah he's following the gene Matthew anointed of the Holy Spirit he's following that Gene as it's coming through this lineage of people this lineage of the tribe of Judah and the gene finally finds a resting place in a young lady's womb called Mary of the tribe of Judah the Jean finally finds a resting place where it will grow to the stature of a perfect man Mary a type of the church a type of the bride and the gene has been coming down but it's found a resting place in The Bride of Jesus Christ the gene that Matthew was following from Abraham all the way down through all of these all of these people once again if you can believe it the gene has found a resting place in the womb of your heart you and I become a resting place of this Gene the king of Israel the king of the Jews the bridegroom to his bride oh you and I are this little Mary this where this King has decided to settle in will let him if will receive him you and I can become pregnated with word the word of God this Gene as as Matthew saw it coming down from Abraham finally gets down and he says and elud in verse 15 beg got Eleazar and elazar beg got mathan and mathan beg got Jacob and Jacob beg got Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus was called Christ the book of the generation of Jesus Christ and how this Gene finally came to be born in a little young girl called Mary were following the Journey of how that seed of God made it to Mary and where it traveled for hundreds of years looking for little Mary and he's been traveling for thousands of years looking for you he wants to be born in you he wants your heart to be his manger he wants you to to claim this scripture he wants you to catch the Revelation wait a minute I'm that little Mary it's me in the mirror of the word now I see who I am I am that little Mary and in me is that very Gene we are this young church called the bride of Christ that's what the scriptures represent oh written in Parables written in metaphor written so that you need a revelation to catch it so it does just doesn't become a story in Spanish you say so it doesn't become just another NOA no Jesus Christ chapter 2 from birth to Nazareth is what chapter two covers where he lived until he began his ministry at about 30 years of age in but in Matthew 3 John begins John begins his ministry just before the ministry of Jesus begins for Elijah the prophet was to come on the scene a forerunner to introduce the Lamb of God to introduce Jesus Christ to Israel to tell them behold the Lamb of God behold the king of the Jews behold what Israel once rejected he's here again to give you another chance he rejected him in the days of Samuel the prophet but will you receive him today in the ministry of John the Baptist ofet and many rejected in that time God rich and mercy come down again in the mouth of another Elijah to give you and I a chance to make Jesus our King not the prophet the Lord Jesus king of Our Lives king of our hearts king of our minds oh he's come back again to extend his scepter to you a little Mary will you take me as your husband will you take me as your Lord will you receive my salvation then you receive healing from My Touch come back again because in you I followed that J that's how I know my children when I look at them I look at you I see the gene of Jesus Christ in you that's me that's what makes you my daughter that's what makes you my son God rich in Mercy and Matthew 3 Elijah the prophet comes on the scene a forerunner introducing the Lamb of God to Israel so before Jesus begins John comes on the scene behold I send Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord and He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the ministry of John the Baptist John was born to a priest John was of the tribe of Levi John's father Zachariah was a well-respected priest amongst Israel so it it it would fall John's lot and opportunity he too was born to the priesthood now because his father was a ranking m member of the [Music] church John you listen to me and you'll be in the ministry too because you're my son you're already accepted no worries but John was born for a greater Ministry John was born to be Elijah and to introduce Israel to the Lamb of God to identify the king of the Jews but as a young boy his parents being great in age when he was born the only son to this elderly couple history says that his mom and dad they passed away and as a young boy the Holy Spirit almighty God takes John to live in the wilderness he didn't grow up like other children he never had a childhood as a young boy he never he never had a mom to to to to hold him and keep him warm on the cold nights of Judea he didn't have a dad to teach him the things that he knew no no his ministry was so important that God separated him even from mother even from father even from all his relatives and took him into the Wilderness God became his mom God became his dad God became his guide God was the one anointing him and when he come to be a young man 29 30 years old God calls him he says your hours come you're to go to You're to go out to Israel now I want you to preach the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand I want you to start baptizing the people unto repentance I want you to preach Heaven high and Hell hot but through repentance and water baptism we could now begin a journey a journey to those very Heights of Holiness of Integrity of honesty of fidelity to God in chapter three John is baptizing and the River Jordan the people are coming they' never heard a message like this they'd never heard a man preach like John they never been invited to be baptized unto repentance they never had the opportunity to do an outward work to show that there was something on the inside moving them to show something was being changed within them just being baptized in water doesn't save you or every time people go swimming in the ocean they'd be saved no it was the attitude no it's the conviction no it's the reason no it's the leading of the Holy Ghost leading you that makes this baptism submer in this water different from any other time that you could be submerged in water repentance made the difference repentance made it something sacred repentance made the Holy Ghost come down it was the ministry of John and while he's preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand repent and be baptized but he also told them my Ministry I baptize you with water but this is to prepare you for something Supernatural there's another step there's more things to be added because there's coming one after me who will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire I'm preparing your hearts I'm preparing your minds I'm laying a gospel seed that if there's something that we need Israel is to be baptized but I baptize with water the next baptism your second pull is to Long and look for a supernatural baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire if this water baptism made you feel good made you feel clean give you hope oh wait till you get the Holy Ghost in fire that baptism will give you more than hope it'll give you courage it'll give you strength it'll give you overcoming power for every strong Temptation the fire of God will keep you hold you lift you up he give you the victory that's what this King was coming we've been following a star to this spot where is he that'll be born King of the Jews a king that'll Serve the People a king that'll love the people a king that that'll let you keep the nicest property a king that'll let you keep the best Vineyard then he'll take the Old Vineyard and when he cleanses it and makes it fruitful he'll give you that one back too because you can't outgive the Lord no matter what you do cuz you'll find that in the end this King King Jesus has outen you an eye a million times over John in verse 13 of Matthew 3 Jesus comes to him he's going to begin his ministry but before he begins he is our sacrifice and the sacrifice must always be washed the sacrificial Lambs had to be washed first then cometh Jesus from G to Jordan and to John to be baptized of him but not for repentance but John forbade him saying you don't have to repent of anything it's I need to repent of you I Elijah I the great prophet I the human being I the one that needs to repent why don't you baptize me instead Jesus said unto him suffer it to be so I know you need me to baptize you more than I need to be baptized of you speaking just naturally he says but suffer it to be so for there's a prophetic word that needs to be fulfilled in my life right now and you're the one that I'm calling to help me fulfill this prophetic word and no matter how short you feel no M no matter how how you feel that you are not worthy do you know there's a prophetic word in the scriptures concerning you and I that God needs and wants you to help him fulfill oh God rich in Mercy loves you wants you needs you calling you the king of the Jews the king of Heaven the King of Kings he needs you because he loves you if he didn't love you he wouldn't feel he needed you but because he loves you he tells you this morning I need you and if you'll meet me in the prayer closet I'll show you why I need you and why I want you and why I love you Jesus verse 15 he tells John suffer it to be so for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness then John being a prophet he said I don't really understand what you said and yet I get it and yet I do understand another words to you I surrender all obedience Lord I don't really understand and yet I do understand why I need to put my house in order why we should put the church in order I don't understand and yet it's way deep inside you do understand and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased now he was ready to begin his ministry now the lamb had been washed to prepare for a great sacrifice that was coming up then he enters on Matthew 4:1 Mount Temptation and there we see where Jesus defeated Lucifer by simply telling him it's also written Satan quoted Him scripture with a period Jesus said let me take that period off put it here put a comma and show you where it's also written and after about three tries said you know that's enough this man's playing with me he messing me up I ain't talking with you no more Jesus I'll just make a plan to get rid of you I'll anoint Israel and the high priest I'll anoint Pontius Pilate Caesar of Rome I'll anoint the Pagan world and I'll anoint the religious world and even if they hate each other I am leading both of them I anointing both of them and I'll anoint them both bring them into an invisible Union finally agree on one thing put Jesus to death crucify him and those that follow him oh it was all going to repeat again in our day once again the story repeats for a short time both John and Jesus were on the field preaching to Israel at the in Matthew 4 it's when Jesus begins his ministry as an evangelist praying for the sick and the more he prayed for the more people came until there was thousands upon thousands that would come together in big Open Fields and he'd pray for them he'd touch them he would heal the lame he was raising the dead he was giving sight to the blind he had caught the attention of the people they were following him for the Miracles they saw it's what he wanted them to do he wanted to get the attention of every little Mary that was in the crowd in whom was the very Gene of God Sons and Daughters of God living in spiritual Amnesia like you and I but now our eyes of our understanding is being opened we see the pattern of God's word we see our place in the scriptures we see how how he's calling us to live we see how he's calling us to talk we see how he's asking us to think because he wants to be born in the manger of our hearts if he hasn't already that's what he's asking this morning it's in chapter four he begins his ministry the Bible says in chapter 4 verse 12 now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee that means the prophetic Ministry had ended and now God was giving Israel another chance John was also a rejected Prophet John was a prophet that gone was leaving the scene like Samuel was a prophet God wanted to be Israel's King once Samuel when Samuel was off the scene they could take their eyes off the man and that and see that God had been leading them all the time to the prophet but now God wanted to lead each and every one of us no mediator between you and God no mediator between you and the Holy Spirit yes the fightful ministry is supposed to help you help you come to perfection but they shouldn't get in the way of a personal experience between you Jesus Christ Our Lord no King but Jesus now no King but Jesus in our hearts Jesus begins he says and leaving Nazareth verse 13 he came to dwell in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in the bird in the borders of Zebulon and Naim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet the land of Zebulon and the land of neth by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles and one of his first meetings was amongst the gentile people they saw the Miracles Pagan gentile people and then he went to Israel the king of the Jews the lion of the tribe of Judah was to take the Lion's part first Israel his people and he was going to give them the book that Adam had lost and he was going to open up for them a plan a seven-part plan you know it as the Seven Seals but Seven Seals are seven parts of one divine plan for Jesus to come and be born in the manger of your heart and lift you up to a place of rapturing Faith verse five chapter five of Matthew the Evangelist goes into a Teaching Ministry in Matthew 56 and 7 Jesus is teaching on Perfection what is biblical perfection when you and I finally break from these creatures of time into eternity and we are as Eternal as the father in Heaven not potentially Eternal Matthew 548 be ye therefore perfect Eternal even as your father which is in heaven is an eternal being that was verse 48 so the question is so how do we become perfect well you start by going back and studying these first these first these last 47 verses because if you got to 48 and you say we can't be perfect you completely missed the first 47 verses of all the baby steps to be perfect even as the father which is in heaven is perfect he spoke it in a parable so in order to understand it you'll need to have have a restored friendship with the father and when you have that called the baptism of the Holy Ghost Fire he'll give you Revelation and when you see it you'll go wow that was simple that's God in Simplicity when you're born again when you're speaking when you're in speaking terms with the father and he's revealing to his word you're getting it straight from the author Mary we look to see her on the other side Maria but we don't need her as a secretary to know Jesus but we do love the example that she left us and the life she led and the faith she had and the price she paid for what she believed Prophet preached a little message Mary's belief go hear it chapter 5 6 and 7 Jesus preaching on Perfection giving us the steps of how to get there and in chapter eight of the Book of Matthew he returns back to doing the work of an evangelist Healing The Sick casting out Devils he cast out the spirits with his word the Bible says he says and he healed all that were sick all that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying he himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses oh everybody loved him he was healing the people he was healing your mom he was healing your dad he was healing your children they followed him by the thousands now then people said Lord I'll follow you wherever you go he said the foxes have dens and the birds have Nest but the son of man hath not where to lay his head yet because you see where I'm going to place my head is I'm going to give my head chip on a body called The Bride of Jesus Christ and when she's finally formed when she's fully born on the day of Pentecost I'll then have a place to lay my head you see he wasn't speaking literally he was speaking in a parable not literally he had many places to lay his head one time he laid his head in a ship the Bible says he fell asleep or the apostles thought he slept we know that for his children he neither sleeps nor Slumbers in chapter nine this evangelist he takes on two more attributes of his Ministry in chapter n he discerns the thoughts of the scribes dising a prophetic Ministry and in chapter nine Jesus he forgives for the first time he makes a statement to someone who was sick someone who needed healing in the body they brought to him a man laying sick of the py he's trembling shaking lying on a bed and Jesus says seeing their faith he said unto the sick of the py he saw the faith of the people that brought this man saw their faith there was people that loved this man they saw hope for him they said let's four or five of us pick up this bed and take him to Jesus we can only get him there he'll be healed we know he will Jesus seen their Faith said unto the sick of the FY who also had a greater need a greater healing Jesus said Son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven him and the scribes said this man Blas blasphemeth no no he wasn't blaspheming he had just entered in to a Ministry of the Lamb of God and they didn't see it they didn't catch it they didn't see the ministerial change they didn't see the attribute of God the Lamb of God they said blasphemer when it was really the Lamb of God and the Lamb's Book was opening and a Plan of Salvation first for Israel but Israel was rejecting already as the multitudes followed him for the Miracles that big denomination of that day was rejecting him more and more with every Miracle with every sin he forgave every good deed he did they despised them more and more because the people had stopped going to synagogues and they'd rather be at one of his healing meetings theyd rather hear him preach than the rabbis cuz they said no man teaches the way you teach we know you're a teacher come from God Nicodemus said I wish I could hear you preach more often but but you know I'm a associate minister in this church over here so I can't leave my place of Duty even even though their preaching is boring me and I see that your message I see you've got a message I see you putting the scriptures together it's like I'm getting Revelation but you know I belong to the certain church and I you know Matthew 9 Jesus displays two more attributes one he discerns the thoughts and intents of the hearts men declares him a prophet two he forgives sins he's entered into the ministry of the lamb in Matthew 10 he now sets the the New Testament Church in order with apostles he didn't start the New Testament Church with prophets of course John was a prophet but John was a prophet to introduce the Lamb of God but now the men that are going to be on the streets walking preaching the revealed word he brings Apostles first they're a rare breed of men Apostles they go in places and they begin setting God's people in order though they might be hated despised and never invited back they're that kind of men that do just exactly what God tells them he begins with 12 Simon Andrew James Ze John Philip phip barom Thomas Thomas Matthew thean James lius Simon the Canaanite and Judas scariot and to all 12 he gives a gift of healing and to preach the gospel including Judas because gifts and callings are without repentance and Judas had a role to play and that role had been spoken of since the beginning in the Old Testament remember the Book of Ruth when Boaz was going going to redeem Naomi but to redeem Naomi he had to take Ruth to wife then Boaz finds out that Naomi has a nearer Kinsman than him Boaz a type of Christ and that and that nearer Kinsman represents the devil because we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity all come to this world speaking lies we're in a high bread flesh body the body is a nearer kin so Boaz can't do the work of redemption he has to address this problem and he calls forth a meeting and in that meeting he has to call by by the tradition of the elders he must call 10 Elders to be Witnesses he has to be present and then this other man 12 of them and when Boaz tells this other Kinsman will you take Naomi to be your wife and thus redeem all of eliminex air to all this land sure I'll do that he's got a lot of land Naomi's old she'll be dead soon I don't have to deal with her no more and I get the land I'll I'll do it he says but in order to have Naomi you must take Ruth to wife he goes a gentile nah I don't do that I can't do that I won't do it I'm not able to do that he said I I'm not a redeemer Bo says I am I'm able both to redeem Israel and a gentile bride Ruth I have the power I have the means I have the ability I have the love to stand in the bridge for both a gentile bride and a Jewish church I'll redeem them all so in this meeting of 12 one of them was a devil and one was a redeemer in the days of Ruth we fast forward to this day there's 12 one of them was a devil one was a redeemer a type a shadow a metaphor unfolding sometimes you read something in the Bible and we think wowow this isn't written in anywhere in the Bible just wait keep putting commas you'll find the pattern of God's word Genesis to Revelations but when you can see the pattern of God's word in your life then you're really seeing something cuz then you're seeing your Change Daily every hour every minute then you can say you know what I can be a better father you know what I can be a more patient mom you know what we can set our house in order because in this womb is the very Gene of God been coming down all the way from Abraham and where did the gene finally rest that brought forth a man perfect man in the womb of little Mary is where that Jee finally rested you're that little Mary this morning Jesus Christ in you of Glory hallu chapter 10 he chooses a Ministry and then he tells them what they're going to go through he tells them where to go to these Apostles verse six but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel preach the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely you have received freely give a man that's preaching for tithing is a man who's never been born again and never had the baptism of the Holy Ghost verse n provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses wasn't talking to the Ley he was talking to the ministry nor script for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the Workman is worthy of his meat and into whatsoever city or town you shall enter inquire who in it is worthy and there abide till we go then he's telling these ministers is Apostles you don't need to chase the money but when you need it I'll bring it to you you need to preach the Kingdom of Heaven you need to be a servant to the people and as I take care of the people I'll take care of you but you need to be a servant not a lord not a king not a dictator in Clos him I want to read a quote for you in the message questions and answers number one in English it's paragraph 30 301 Joshua brother brandham says this it's 1964 it's August the 23rd it's a morning service and a prophet in closing says this dear God so many of these questions here about the people coming to Arizona oh dear God let those dear precious people they'll listen to this tape out there let them know that I am no dictator to tell them where to live what to do and may they clearly understand then who will then who can tell you where to live and what to do as we stand to our feet dear God so many of these questions here about the people coming to Arizona you know like instead of staying in California oh dear God let those dear precious people they'll listen to this tape out there let them know that I'm no dictator to tell them where to live what to do and may they clearly understand but there has been men raised up who have tried to tell you where to live and what to do you know them you've heard them but that's the voice of a dictator but a prophet said let them know that I'm not a dictator to tell them where to live what to do and that may they clearly understand so then who after the prophet Samuel went off the scene who would tell the people where to live and what to do the people said we know if we have a king he'll tell us here's the prophet here's the king they jumped over from a prophetic Ministry to a King to a dictator to an abusive Ministry when they could have gone the prophetic Ministry to Jehovah God Christ in you the hope and Glory the baptism of the Holy Ghost let them know that I'm no dictator to tell them where to live and what to do and may they clearly understand but there is someone who wants to have a great influence in your life who wants to tell his sons and his daughters where to live and what to do that somebody is the holy spirit that somebody is Jesus Christ if you're not praying daily asking him to lead you that you could wind up with a king let him be your guide let him be the one that leads you pray ask knock and it shall be open to you and you shall find ask and he'll give it to you as we bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you once again be our leader be our guide help us to receive you and have a
