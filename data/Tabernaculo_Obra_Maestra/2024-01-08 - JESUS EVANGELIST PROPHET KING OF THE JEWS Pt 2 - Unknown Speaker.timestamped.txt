[56:23] first
[56:26] that's what brings him on the
[56:28] scene his hearts that are being
[56:32] tenderized lives that are being

[57:00] glory thinking of what he's done for
[57:03] you looking
[57:06] back 50
[57:10] years well some of you aren't old enough
[57:12] to think back 50
[57:16] years but as I think back 50
[57:19] years I see the amazing grace of
[57:23] God that lift stood up a young
[57:26] boy lost in
[57:28] sin
[57:30] wandering no
[57:32] directions no there was a direction it
[57:35] was it was and I was pointing straight
[57:37] to the pit of
[57:40] Hell God rich in
[57:44] Mercy his
[57:46] eyes were upon me every moment and I
[57:51] didn't know it he was watching for me
[57:55] and I didn't know it he he was he was he
[57:59] would walk by my
[58:01] side and I couldn't feel him but one day
[58:06] by his Amazing Grace he came down he
[58:10] stirred my
[58:11] heart and he wasn't going to leave me
[58:14] until I could
[58:18] recognize but why
[58:20] me he says because you're my son because
[58:24] you're my daughter cuz I won't let you
[58:27] wander in sin no
[58:29] more I'm going to make a
[58:32] way and he
[58:34] did he made a way on the cross of
[58:38] Calvary he made a way for
[58:42] healing most important the healing of
[58:45] our
[58:47] hearts and he come that we could be born
[58:51] again that that just like Adam in the
[58:54] beginning
[58:56] he placed that Spirit man in a flesh
[58:59] body the Bible says and he became a
[59:02] living
[59:04] soul and he would have continued being a
[59:07] living
[59:08] Soul broken to
[59:12] Eternity but they chose because God
[59:15] because God gave them free moral
[59:19] agency and they didn't choose and and
[59:22] Satan didn't present them with a
[59:24] different
[59:27] no no he just presented Eve with a
[59:32] shortcut claiming that this
[59:35] shortcut will actually take you to the
[59:38] presence of God and his plan
[59:42] faster because you don't know how soon
[59:45] he's going to
[59:48] come but I can take you there
[59:51] faster it's the same plan same
[59:55] Bible the serpent said trust
[1:00:00] me she
[1:00:02] did but he lied to
[1:00:05] her because the serpent was the devil's
[1:00:08] first
[1:00:10] Apostle the the serpent was the devil's
[1:00:13] first
[1:00:15] Pastor the serpent was the devil's first
[1:00:19] evangelist the serpent was the with the
[1:00:21] de was the devil's first
[1:00:23] teacher
[1:00:27] but when you're taught of
[1:00:30] Lucifer you're taught to speak
[1:00:33] lies you're taught to teach
[1:00:37] violence because he himself is a
[1:00:40] murderer and a liar from the
[1:00:44] beginning so when he is your
[1:00:46] teacher guess what it'll make you
[1:00:51] like you say I see now
[1:00:55] I see why now there's message churches
[1:01:00] and that are acting a certain
[1:01:03] way because they're not
[1:01:06] listening they've been told by the lies
[1:01:09] of the
[1:01:11] devil I can get you where you where
[1:01:13] you're going
[1:01:15] quicker I'll give you a
[1:01:18] shortcut but the shortcut is
[1:01:21] death there's only life through Jesus
[1:01:24] Christ
[1:01:25] as we stand to our feet this

[1:02:59] 4 and Ma Matthew 4 began the ministry of
[1:03:03] Jesus
[1:03:05] Christ as an
[1:03:07] evangelist praying for the
[1:03:09] sick
[1:03:11] healing healing all kinds of
[1:03:14] sickness all kinds of
[1:03:17] torments all kinds of
[1:03:21] infirmities all types of serious
[1:03:28] diseases and he began there as a as an
[1:03:33] evangelist it was part one of his
[1:03:36] ministry but and his ministry would have
[1:03:39] three changes in
[1:03:41] it he would
[1:03:43] unfold the the role of an
[1:03:46] evangelist and his only message that he
[1:03:48] would preach during this
[1:03:51] time was
[1:03:53] repent that was
[1:03:55] all but more would be
[1:03:58] added as the ministry went
[1:04:01] on but he cried out to the people
[1:04:05] repent and seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:04:09] heaven then he would pray for the
[1:04:11] sick and thousands begin to
[1:04:15] gather a multitude is thousands of
[1:04:19] people and he and he had healing
[1:04:21] campaigns in the different cities
[1:04:25] throughout all
[1:04:27] Judea all
[1:04:29] Galilee praying for the sick and just
[1:04:33] simp simply ministering and
[1:04:35] praying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:04:40] it was hand he was doing the work of an
[1:04:44] evangelist this is the first coming of
[1:04:47] Christ and this would repeat at the
[1:04:49] second coming of
[1:04:51] Christ because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:04:55] yesterday today and forever and changing
[1:04:58] in all his ways so when you see the
[1:05:00] pattern of the first
[1:05:02] coming you can be sure it'll be the
[1:05:04] pattern of the second
[1:05:07] coming God won't change what he's
[1:05:10] done he's unchanging in all his
[1:05:13] ways we read that in chapter five of
[1:05:17] Matthew the Bible says that he went up
[1:05:19] into a
[1:05:20] mountain and there his disciples all sat
[1:05:23] with him
[1:05:25] and he now began teaching them he went
[1:05:28] beyond just
[1:05:31] repent but the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:05:34] hand but once he had caught the
[1:05:36] attention of the
[1:05:38] people with the
[1:05:40] Miracles with the healing where the
[1:05:43] blind
[1:05:45] saw and the lame
[1:05:48] walk and the death were
[1:05:51] hearing Miracles that the people could
[1:05:53] see
[1:05:56] knowing that no man could do this to be
[1:06:00] God bring this miraculous things to
[1:06:04] pass he had caught their
[1:06:07] attention now the thousands were
[1:06:09] flocking to
[1:06:11] him they would sit in Open Fields just
[1:06:14] waiting for him to do his
[1:06:18] work and when they began coming and
[1:06:21] coming and he caught the attention of
[1:06:23] the
[1:06:24] people it was the first pool of his
[1:06:27] ministry but he had a purpose he wanted
[1:06:30] them to get
[1:06:32] accustomed to trust
[1:06:34] him to follow him and once they were
[1:06:38] following
[1:06:39] him they it's true they were following
[1:06:42] him for the bread and the fishes and the
[1:06:47] Miracles but in chapter five he does
[1:06:50] something different
[1:06:52] now the multitudes gather
[1:06:55] and he stands before them and he begins
[1:06:58] to
[1:06:59] teach blessed are the born
[1:07:02] Spirits the teaching was a teaching like
[1:07:06] they had never heard
[1:07:08] before no Rabbi had ever spoke like this
[1:07:12] man
[1:07:14] spoke for he was taking them beyond the
[1:07:17] law
[1:07:18] now he was taking them into the grace of
[1:07:22] God and the grace of God can change a
[1:07:25] man the grace of God can change a
[1:07:29] woman that it can change the way you
[1:07:32] talk it can change the way you
[1:07:35] think it can change your
[1:07:38] behavior that's what the grace of God
[1:07:41] can do for
[1:07:42] us the law could never change
[1:07:46] you the law could only say we find you
[1:07:52] guilty the s for you and this guilt is
[1:07:57] death the grace of
[1:07:59] God though it finds you
[1:08:03] guilty the gra says but you know
[1:08:06] what I'm going to take your place I'm
[1:08:09] going to pay your price I'm going to set
[1:08:12] you free and mercy says no I'm not going
[1:08:16] to let you go you won't die like men
[1:08:20] died
[1:08:21] before you be born again if you receive
[1:08:24] my Amazing
[1:08:26] Grace So chapter five 6 and
[1:08:30] seven was Jesus
[1:08:32] preaching on
[1:08:35] Perfection they'd never heard something
[1:08:38] before in that
[1:08:40] day under the
[1:08:43] law they didn't
[1:08:45] believe that man could be made
[1:08:50] perfect they don't believe it today
[1:08:56] I spoke to a man a fine man I've shared
[1:09:00] it
[1:09:01] before he was uh one of the
[1:09:03] pastors for a denomination called the
[1:09:08] CCV here in the valley they have several
[1:09:13] churches each church has five 4,000
[1:09:18] members and I was doing some work for
[1:09:20] him in his home a few years
[1:09:22] ago
[1:09:24] and we got to speak in a little
[1:09:26] bit I began sharing some things with
[1:09:30] him of this open book of this revealed
[1:09:35] word of these Seven
[1:09:37] Seals don't let Seven Seals scare
[1:09:42] you you see God just used those
[1:09:46] terms to hide his word from the eyes of
[1:09:49] the wise and
[1:09:52] prudent but as I told told you before
[1:09:55] Seven Seals is just seven parts of one
[1:09:59] divine plan to
[1:10:02] restore Israel the Fig
[1:10:06] Tree and restore you and
[1:10:09] I
[1:10:11] tree it's seven parts of this one
[1:10:16] plan in the mind of God for him to sweep
[1:10:20] down great Jehovah eagle spread as we
[1:10:26] in this 20th century in the days of
[1:10:29] Jesus at his first coming he was flying
[1:10:33] down to pull all his children out of the
[1:10:36] chicken
[1:10:39] houses Catholic Baptist Pentecostal
[1:10:44] Nazar and the list goes
[1:10:47] on even message
[1:10:52] chickes
[1:10:54] he's come to pull us out to set us free
[1:10:58] to give us two
[1:10:59] Wings the
[1:11:01] revelation of old and new
[1:11:05] testament which is really the revelation
[1:11:08] of Jesus
[1:11:10] Christ it's really about Jesus the
[1:11:15] message that's always been the
[1:11:18] message Christ in us the hope of glory
[1:11:22] so in Matthew 5
[1:11:24] Jesus is bringing a
[1:11:26] teaching to the people who had really
[1:11:30] who had really gathered that
[1:11:33] day to see the
[1:11:35] Miracles but God was going to do
[1:11:37] something
[1:11:39] greater he was going to give them his
[1:11:41] word that would change their
[1:11:44] hearts and change their minds and make
[1:11:47] them a different
[1:11:49] people this word that he would give
[1:11:52] them would open a door so that they
[1:11:56] could be born
[1:11:57] again so they could receive the baptism
[1:12:00] of the Holy
[1:12:02] Ghost so that every day of their life
[1:12:04] had that if they needed it they could
[1:12:06] receive a refilling of that Holy
[1:12:10] Spirit so that we could
[1:12:12] grow in the very character of Jesus
[1:12:16] Christ to the stature of a perfect
[1:12:20] man so Revelations 5
[1:12:24] as we've shared before verse
[1:12:28] 48 Jesus said to the
[1:12:31] multitude he says be ye therefore
[1:12:35] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:12:40] heaven I shared that with this with this
[1:12:43] one
[1:12:44] brother a pastor from this
[1:12:48] church he says he smiles he
[1:12:51] says oh Daniel he says
[1:12:54] you don't you don't understand we cannot
[1:12:57] be
[1:12:58] perfect in this body in this life his
[1:13:02] name was Bert I said Bert you tell me
[1:13:07] you're a pastor you share the
[1:13:11] gospel who should I
[1:13:13] believe should I believe what I just
[1:13:16] read that Jesus
[1:13:20] said or should I just believe what you
[1:13:22] told me
[1:13:24] that what he said is
[1:13:28] impossible maybe we're looking at this
[1:13:31] can the wrong
[1:13:34] way CU Jesus said be ye therefore
[1:13:39] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:13:43] heaven and he goes we can't be
[1:13:47] perfect it's like he wanted to believe
[1:13:49] we could we there's a there's a a hope
[1:13:52] and a chance but he just could
[1:13:57] because his denomination and and and his
[1:14:00] theology had told him different for
[1:14:02] years and
[1:14:05] years he was a man my very same
[1:14:08] age we were one day apart in
[1:14:12] age I was one day older than
[1:14:16] him so I would tell
[1:14:19] him you see what I'm telling you
[1:14:22] today within 24 hours I'm praying that
[1:14:27] you'll be where I
[1:14:30] am he says you got 24
[1:14:34] hours and you'll be right where I am he
[1:14:36] said I don't know about that
[1:14:39] Daniel but Jesus said be ye therefore
[1:14:44] perfect I shared them I said do you know
[1:14:47] why Jesus
[1:14:52] said he says no he says but I sense
[1:14:57] you're going to tell
[1:14:58] me I am going to tell you he say it's
[1:15:02] because of the other previous 47
[1:15:08] verses and we've read past it all our
[1:15:14] lives we didn't understand it we didn't
[1:15:18] understand the Bible but when we got to
[1:15:20] verse
[1:15:22] 48 all of a sudden we think we
[1:15:26] understand we don't understand 47
[1:15:29] verses but we go to
[1:15:32] 48 I know one thing for
[1:15:34] sure we can't be this that Jesus said we
[1:15:38] could
[1:15:40] be but the other 47
[1:15:43] verses that he preached on
[1:15:46] it you ask what does that
[1:15:49] mean well it's I don't
[1:15:51] know but I'm I'm pretty sure that
[1:15:56] 48 doesn't mean what he said it
[1:16:01] means but Jesus
[1:16:03] said be ye
[1:16:06] therefore
[1:16:07] perfect because of the other 47
[1:16:11] verses that I've been teaching
[1:16:15] you but it'll require a
[1:16:18] revelation see and Jesus preaches on
[1:16:22] perfection
[1:16:24] verse 5 verse six and verse S he's on
[1:16:29] this
[1:16:29] Mount and verse
[1:16:32] 81 is where we left off last in chapter
[1:16:37] 8 Matthew 8 verse
[1:16:40] one it says and when he was come down
[1:16:43] from the
[1:16:45] mountain great multitudes
[1:16:48] followed they had been waiting for the
[1:16:52] Miracles
[1:16:54] and he kept them
[1:16:56] waiting and instead he gave them his
[1:17:00] word instead he gave them a word that
[1:17:03] was a character building
[1:17:07] word instead he gave them a word on how
[1:17:10] they should conduct
[1:17:13] themselves instead he gave them a word
[1:17:15] of how to apply Faith to their
[1:17:21] Revelation and verse 81
[1:17:27] Matthew
[1:17:29] 81 he finished his
[1:17:32] teaching on
[1:17:34] Perfection for a New Testament
[1:17:36] Church for the Bride of Jesus Christ for
[1:17:40] those that would follow him and his
[1:17:43] divine
[1:17:45] grace instead of Moses and the
[1:17:48] law verse two says and behold
[1:17:53] there came a leper who' been
[1:17:56] listening to his teaching on
[1:18:01] Perfection a
[1:18:04] leper is a
[1:18:06] person whose
[1:18:09] body is being
[1:18:14] deformed and the sickness is eating away
[1:18:17] at his
[1:18:20] flesh it's possible for a leper
[1:18:23] a person who becomes a
[1:18:26] leper to live as long in misery and pain
[1:18:30] for 50
[1:18:34] years it was a
[1:18:37] miserable it was a miserable wretched
[1:18:40] way to
[1:18:42] die it was a slow death but a sure
[1:18:48] death there was no healing there was no
[1:18:52] herbs
[1:18:53] there was no
[1:18:54] incantation that once you got
[1:18:59] leprosy it was a miserable death
[1:19:03] sentence it was a constant
[1:19:07] torment but this
[1:19:09] leper had sat and
[1:19:12] listened to the word
[1:19:15] preached this leper had listen to those
[1:19:17] 47
[1:19:20] verses and when he heard Jesus said
[1:19:24] therefore perfect of the thousands that
[1:19:27] were
[1:19:28] listening this divinely revealed mystery
[1:19:33] truth one man full of leprosy that had
[1:19:38] to stand apart way away from
[1:19:41] everyone he couldn't get close to the
[1:19:44] Thousand he could barely hear
[1:19:47] Jesus but he listened to every word from
[1:19:50] a
[1:19:51] distance and this leper who had been
[1:19:55] listening to the
[1:19:56] word who for the
[1:19:59] moment while he was
[1:20:01] listening forgot about his
[1:20:03] troubles forgot about his
[1:20:06] leprosy forgot about his
[1:20:08] rejection forgot how everybody shunned
[1:20:11] him forgot how he had been put out of
[1:20:14] the church and out of the
[1:20:18] synagogue he
[1:20:20] believed in perfection and he looked at
[1:20:23] his
[1:20:24] body he says I
[1:20:27] need what he's talking
[1:20:31] about and the first thing he
[1:20:34] did he says and behold there came a
[1:20:38] leper and worshiped
[1:20:41] him you see what worship
[1:20:44] does you see what a genu wine heart
[1:20:47] that's been broken and contrite how it
[1:20:51] responds
[1:20:55] if we're not
[1:20:56] worshippers don't
[1:20:59] expect to receive
[1:21:02] Revelation and behold there came a leper
[1:21:05] and worshiped
[1:21:08] him saying Lord if thou
[1:21:12] will thou can makes me
[1:21:15] clean he says you said we could be
[1:21:20] perfect and I believe you
[1:21:24] and if you want
[1:21:26] to you can make me
[1:21:28] perfect even in this flesh
[1:21:31] body but Perfection was beyond the flesh
[1:21:36] body but sometimes that's where God
[1:21:38] starts with
[1:21:40] us he does something
[1:21:43] special he gives you a job you were
[1:21:45] praying
[1:21:47] for he gives you a wife you were praying
[1:21:50] for he gives you a husband you were
[1:21:52] praying
[1:21:53] for he raises you up off of a death bed
[1:21:57] in a
[1:21:59] hospital he does something that you can
[1:22:02] see with your eyes that you can hear
[1:22:05] with your ears so that you'll have faith
[1:22:08] to ask for something that no one can see
[1:22:12] that you're struggling with that no one
[1:22:14] can see the inner torment of
[1:22:18] heart so you can have faith that he can
[1:22:21] heal that part
[1:22:27] now this
[1:22:29] leper came and worshiped him it it
[1:22:32] wasn't something to brag
[1:22:37] about the to be a
[1:22:40] rabbi and to say guess
[1:22:42] what the lepers are worshiping
[1:22:46] me that was nothing to wor to to to to
[1:22:49] brag about in the days of Jesus
[1:22:53] that was nothing to brag about under the
[1:22:56] law on the
[1:22:58] contrary the lepers had their own
[1:23:02] colony the priests were sure to push
[1:23:04] them there and keep them
[1:23:07] there don't come close to the
[1:23:11] congregation don't you dare try and open
[1:23:13] come to the
[1:23:15] synagogue you live far away from
[1:23:19] us don't touch me and I won't touch
[1:23:24] they were a rejected
[1:23:26] people because of this sickness that was
[1:23:29] in their body that could be
[1:23:32] seen on their
[1:23:34] faces on their
[1:23:36] hands and the moans of their constant
[1:23:39] suffering could be
[1:23:42] heard and here comes this
[1:23:47] leper to
[1:23:49] Jesus and he worships him
[1:23:53] and
[1:23:54] Jesus did what no Rabbi had ever
[1:23:58] done Jesus did what no Minister had ever
[1:24:03] done Jesus did what no Apostle Prophet
[1:24:09] priest had ever
[1:24:12] done Jesus put his put forth his
[1:24:16] hand this man full of
[1:24:19] leprosy and he touched him
[1:24:23] and everybody
[1:24:25] goes he's going to have leprosy now he's
[1:24:28] contaminated
[1:24:30] now no not when he touches
[1:24:33] you him touching you doesn't hurt him
[1:24:38] him touching you saves you and healers
[1:24:42] you oh we need a touch from him this
[1:24:47] morning and Jesus put forth his hand and
[1:24:51] touched him saying
[1:24:53] I
[1:24:55] will every one of you are here this
[1:24:58] morning because Jesus is touched
[1:25:01] you and he said I
[1:25:04] will I
[1:25:08] will I'll heal your
[1:25:11] complexes I'll heal your inner
[1:25:14] struggles I'll heal the torment that's
[1:25:17] in your
[1:25:18] mind he's telling you this
[1:25:20] morning I Jesus
[1:25:23] I
[1:25:24] will I
[1:25:28] will and Jesus put forth his hand and
[1:25:31] touched
[1:25:32] him saying I will be thou
[1:25:37] clean and two weeks
[1:25:40] later no and one year later and it took
[1:25:45] a whole 24
[1:25:47] hours and
[1:25:49] immediately his leprosy
[1:25:52] was cleansed by faith this
[1:25:56] morning whatever is the burden in your
[1:26:01] heart you can say
[1:26:03] Lord I
[1:26:05] know that thou can make me
[1:26:08] clean from things on the
[1:26:11] inside that no one
[1:26:14] knows and no one can see the torment I'm
[1:26:18] in but if thou
[1:26:20] will you can make me
[1:26:23] clean if you let him touch you this
[1:26:26] morning the effects of his touch this
[1:26:30] morning will be
[1:26:32] immediate it'll be right now it'll be
[1:26:35] yay and
[1:26:39] amen and Jesus saith unto
[1:26:41] him see thou tell no
[1:26:46] man but go thy
[1:26:48] way show thyself to the priest
[1:26:53] and offer the gift that Moses
[1:26:56] commanded for a testimony unto
[1:27:01] them and when Jesus entered into
[1:27:06] Capernaum they came unto Centurion
[1:27:08] beseeching
[1:27:10] him let's go back to verse
[1:27:13] four and Jesus said to this
[1:27:17] leper who had been
[1:27:20] cleaned there wasn't a spot of leprosy
[1:27:23] left on this
[1:27:27] person he told them see thou tell no
[1:27:31] man but go thy way show thyself to the
[1:27:35] priest and offer the gift that Moses
[1:27:39] command for a
[1:27:44] testimony as far as we
[1:27:47] know this is the first time in Jewish
[1:27:51] history
[1:27:53] in perhaps 1500
[1:27:55] years that a leper who was a
[1:27:59] Jew had been
[1:28:04] healed Jesus told
[1:28:07] him go and go to the
[1:28:10] priest show thyself that you've been
[1:28:14] cleansed and offer the gift that Moses
[1:28:16] commanded
[1:28:18] for the gift he was to

[1:28:23] it was in three parts but the first part
[1:28:27] he was to take two turtle
[1:28:30] doves before the
[1:28:32] priest the priest would take one of the
[1:28:34] doves and put it in an earn
[1:28:41] vessel and they would kill the one the
[1:28:44] one the one turtle
[1:28:47] dove in this earn
[1:28:51] vessel
[1:28:52] you know what it
[1:28:54] represented this dying
[1:28:56] Dove this bird killed in an earth
[1:29:01] vessel it represented Jehovah
[1:29:05] God that came and dwelt in a vessel of
[1:29:09] clay and in that vessel of clay will die
[1:29:14] for you and I to cleanse our
[1:29:18] leprosy this is what this this this
[1:29:23] represented these two living
[1:29:26] birds to be a
[1:29:28] testimony of the cleansing
[1:29:31] power the blood of the
[1:29:34] Lamb amen the

[1:30:05] me I'm the
[1:30:10] leopard then they would take the blood
[1:30:13] of that dead
[1:30:14] bird that one that died on Calvary that
[1:30:18] one that died in a vessel of
[1:30:20] clay

[1:32:12] was ashamed of the
[1:32:18] Gospel that living bird that was spr
[1:32:23] sprled the sprinkling of that living
[1:32:27] bird was the
[1:32:29] washing of the water of the word in your
[1:32:34] life and
[1:32:35] mine and the bird in the earth and
[1:32:40] vessel was Jehovah
[1:32:44] God he
[1:32:45] died
[1:32:48] God gave his life for you
[1:32:52] in an earn
[1:32:54] vessel called Jesus of

[1:33:03] said go offer the
[1:33:07] gift
[1:33:10] commanded that was
[1:33:13] testifying that the man that he that had
[1:33:15] cleansed
[1:33:16] him was actually God in an earn vessel
[1:33:22] and they didn't know
[1:33:24] it they couldn't figure out the
[1:33:28] mystery it wasn't the proverb and and
[1:33:31] the ritual was not revealed to
[1:33:34] them they did it
[1:33:39] literally and didn't understand what
[1:33:41] they were
[1:33:42] doing didn't understand what it
[1:33:45] represented didn't understand that that
[1:33:49] day ritual was being
[1:33:54] fulfilled no longer a
[1:33:57] mystery no longer a
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:34:00] ritual the manifested word of
[1:34:06] God and Jesus had told
[1:34:08] them see thou tell no
[1:34:12] man and he goes and
[1:34:14] offers this man is
[1:34:16] happy this man is
[1:34:19] excited this man is emotional
[1:34:24] because to whom much is
[1:34:28] given or to whom much is
[1:34:32] Forgiven to whom much is
[1:34:36] Forgiven that
[1:34:39] one will be very
[1:34:43] happy his happiness will flood
[1:34:48] over and he's thinking
[1:34:53] I feel like I want to scream and tell
[1:34:54] the
[1:34:55] [Music]
[1:34:57] world but Jesus told me tell no
[1:35:03] man maybe he meant I shouldn't just tell
[1:35:06] one
[1:35:08] man I know I'll tell the world what
[1:35:12] Jesus did for
[1:35:13] me instead of one man I'll tell every
[1:35:17] man I come
[1:35:19] to I'll tell my family
[1:35:22] I'll tell my father I'll tell my mother
[1:35:25] I'll tell my children that Jesus
[1:35:32] heals and he's coming back for you and
[1:35:37] I and when Jesus was entered into
[1:35:41] Capernaum there came unto him a
[1:35:45] centurion a
[1:35:47] Roman a Roman
[1:35:49] soldier a Roman ROM Man
[1:35:54] Captain he was in charge of 100 Roman
[1:35:59] soldiers by the time you got to the
[1:36:02] place in the Roman
[1:36:07] army you were a well trained
[1:36:13] soldier you were a man with a lot of
[1:36:16] blood on your
[1:36:17] hands you were a man that had killed
[1:36:20] many
[1:36:23] you are a powerful man
[1:36:26] physically and this Roman
[1:36:29] Centurion he must have
[1:36:31] been he must have been listening to this
[1:36:35] message on
[1:36:37] Perfection he must have seen Jesus when
[1:36:40] he touched and healed this
[1:36:45] leper he must have known this leper he
[1:36:48] had seen him wandering the streets
[1:36:50] before
[1:36:53] and now he sees them
[1:37:00] clean and he comes to
[1:37:02] Jesus and saying
[1:37:04] Lord my servant lith at home sick of the
[1:37:12] py grievously
[1:37:17] tormented he shakes
[1:37:20] uncontrollably
[1:37:21] he can't talk clearly no
[1:37:23] more he's getting worse by the
[1:37:27] day this man has served me
[1:37:31] well he says my and Lord my servant lith
[1:37:35] at home sick of the pully grievously
[1:37:42] tormented Jesus saith unto
[1:37:45] him I will come and heal
[1:37:49] him the Centurion answered and
[1:37:53] said he's a Roman he's a gentile he's a
[1:38:00] pagan all his life he's been saying
[1:38:04] Caesar is my
[1:38:06] king Cesar is my
[1:38:08] God Rome is who I
[1:38:12] serve and now for a
[1:38:15] moment Faith Rises
[1:38:18] up in this pagan
[1:38:25] pag a persecutor of
[1:38:28] Israel a killer of
[1:38:33] Jews but he
[1:38:35] heard and he saw a leper
[1:38:41] healed this man knows about
[1:38:45] power or he thinks he
[1:38:49] does the Centurion answer answered and
[1:38:51] said Lord I'm not worthy that thou
[1:38:53] should us come under my
[1:38:57] roof but speak the word only and my
[1:39:01] servant shall be
[1:39:03] healed you know how this Centurion got
[1:39:06] things
[1:39:09] done he'd say to his
[1:39:12] soldiers you and you go over there you
[1:39:16] two go over there the rest of you stand
[1:39:20] right in this place and don't move the
[1:39:22] rest of the
[1:39:24] day and he' turn around walk
[1:39:28] away knowing that every
[1:39:31] man would do exactly what he
[1:39:37] said and he makes it known in verse
[1:39:41] n he says for I am a
[1:39:44] man under
[1:39:47] authority of the Caesar of
[1:39:50] Rome of of men that are called Roman
[1:39:56] perfects a Roman
[1:39:58] perfect was another level of authority
[1:40:01] in the Roman
[1:40:03] army a Roman
[1:40:05] perfect was in charge of many
[1:40:09] centurions so he had authority over
[1:40:11] thousands of
[1:40:14] soldiers and then and the Centurion
[1:40:16] answered and
[1:40:18] said I am a man under Authority
[1:40:22] and I have soldiers under
[1:40:24] me and I say my voice my word my
[1:40:30] commandment I say to this man go and he
[1:40:33] goeth to another come and he
[1:40:36] cometh and to my servant do this and he
[1:40:40] do
[1:40:41] it when Jesus heard it he
[1:40:45] marel and he said to them that
[1:40:49] followed barely I say unto you I have
[1:40:53] not found so great a
[1:40:55] Faith No not in
[1:40:57] Israel that this man isn't waiting for
[1:41:01] Jesus to discern
[1:41:04] him this man is saying just speak the
[1:41:09] word you don't have to do any anything
[1:41:13] else a prophet said I should have
[1:41:16] discerned one or two
[1:41:19] persons
[1:41:22] and the rest of you should have just
[1:41:25] believed that he's here that he's
[1:41:28] present that he's able that he's willing
[1:41:32] but no he said one and another another
[1:41:39] another and instead of people grabbing
[1:41:41] the word by
[1:41:45] faith and their hearts are saying now
[1:41:47] discern me brother
[1:41:49] brandom
[1:41:53] he says I should have never have done
[1:41:55] that the Holy Spirit told me you did
[1:42:00] wrong he said when we went to
[1:42:03] Africa Durban South Africa
[1:42:06] dur God did some
[1:42:09] Miracles you should have seen the
[1:42:11] thousands
[1:42:13] come when that blind man was healed on
[1:42:15] the
[1:42:17] platform he was a worshiper of the Sun
[1:42:21] his eyes were burned
[1:42:22] out and God gave him
[1:42:25] sight he said you should have seen the
[1:42:29] thousands run to
[1:42:32] Christ when they saw
[1:42:37] that and when Jesus heard it verse 10 he
[1:42:42] mared and said to them that
[1:42:45] followed verely I say unto you I have
[1:42:49] not found so great faith not in
[1:42:53] Israel because when Jesus came to
[1:42:56] Israel Israel was a chicken house a
[1:43:02] house Israel was as far away from God as
[1:43:06] the Roman nation
[1:43:12] was but Israel was God's
[1:43:17] people but when he came to them he said
[1:43:21] how
[1:43:22] often have
[1:43:25] I Jehovah
[1:43:28] Jesus tried to gather
[1:43:31] you as a
[1:43:33] hen gathers her
[1:43:35] brood and you would not you've heard
[1:43:39] that he's Jehovah
[1:43:41] Eagle but to the
[1:43:44] Jews it sounds awful to say
[1:43:48] it but the god of Heaven came
[1:43:52] he said because where you're
[1:43:54] at in the chicken yard of
[1:43:59] ungodliness I've come down to become
[1:44:02] Jehovah
[1:44:05] hen to enter into your chicken
[1:44:08] yard to to draw you out of
[1:44:11] that and you would
[1:44:15] not I left the king I left the Throne of
[1:44:19] Glory to enter your chicken
[1:44:24] yard
[1:44:26] Catholic Baptist
[1:44:29] Pentecostal message chicken
[1:44:32] yard he left the Throne of Glory to
[1:44:36] come yet we would
[1:44:38] not leave the chicken yard we wouldn't
[1:44:42] stop pecking on the
[1:44:44] dirt when the heavens are full of the
[1:44:47] rations
[1:44:49] of
[1:44:52] and they say no it's too
[1:44:55] controversial and I don't need that for
[1:44:57] my
[1:44:59] salvation so Book of
[1:45:02] Revelations no don't need it don't read
[1:45:06] it no more not
[1:45:09] necessary so all of a
[1:45:11] sudden they have enough
[1:45:14] Revelation to tell us what
[1:45:16] part of this book of the
[1:45:19] Bible they don't need need no
[1:45:21] more that's denominational
[1:45:26] thinking that's taking on the the lies
[1:45:28] of the
[1:45:35] devil when God is
[1:45:38] offering
[1:45:40] Revelation from Genesis
[1:45:43] toyp and the revelation of this
[1:45:45] Bible is the
[1:45:47] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:45:55] Jesus says in verse 11 of Matthew
[1:45:58] 8 and I say unto you that many shall
[1:46:02] come from the East and
[1:46:06] West and shall sit down with Abraham and
[1:46:09] Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of
[1:46:14] Heaven why not the North and
[1:46:17] South because East is the rising of the
[1:46:23] sun his first
[1:46:28] coming West is the setting of The
[1:46:31] Sun East is the
[1:46:34] beginning of a plan of
[1:46:37] Restoration West is the setting of the
[1:46:41] sun god comes and finally takes his
[1:46:44] little bride
[1:46:46] home when the dead in Christ shall
[1:46:49] rise which are alive and remain at the
[1:46:53] time of the setting of The sun will be
[1:46:56] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:46:59] an
[1:47:00] eye and I say unto you that many shall
[1:47:04] come from the East and the
[1:47:07] west and shall sit down with Abraham
[1:47:10] and and Jacob in the Kingdom of
[1:47:17] Heaven verse 12 but the Children of the
[1:47:21] Kingdom shall be cast
[1:47:24] out notice as he's speaking here in
[1:47:26] verse
[1:47:28] 11 he says and many shall come from the
[1:47:31] East and West and shall sit down with
[1:47:34] Abraham Isaac and
[1:47:37] Jacob this was a
[1:47:39] prophecy of the Jewish
[1:47:43] people of a Plan of
[1:47:45] Redemption of a Plan of
[1:47:47] Salvation of a plan of Jesus coming back
[1:47:52] back for his for these Jewish
[1:47:55] people his children also the generation
[1:47:59] of Jesus
[1:48:01] Christ he says and shall sit down with
[1:48:04] Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom
[1:48:06] of
[1:48:09] Heaven Abraham Isaac Jacob all
[1:48:14] Jews verse 12 is also
[1:48:18] Jews but the children of of the
[1:48:21] Kingdom what kingdom the kingdom of
[1:48:25] Abraham Jacob speaking it's a prophecy
[1:48:30] it's a parable he's speaking about the
[1:48:32] Jewish
[1:48:34] people but the children of the
[1:48:37] Kingdom shall be cast out into outer
[1:48:40] Darkness there shall be weeping and
[1:48:43] nashing of te it was the first coming of
[1:48:47] Christ Jesus was prophesying
[1:48:51] that Israel these children of the
[1:48:54] Kingdom that had to be
[1:48:57] blinded for you and I to be
[1:49:01] saved they will be cast
[1:49:05] out outside of
[1:49:07] Jerusalem outside of the promised land
[1:49:10] from the days of
[1:49:12] Jesus the Jews were scattered the world
[1:49:16] over the Promised
[1:49:19] Land by by 135
[1:49:25] ad there wasn't hardly a Jew left in the
[1:49:28] promised
[1:49:31] land and for almost 2,000
[1:49:33] years they were scattered the world
[1:49:37] over that's what the scripture is
[1:49:39] speaking of the children of the Kingdom
[1:49:41] shall be cast out into outer
[1:49:45] Darkness the darkness of an ungodly
[1:49:49] world
[1:49:52] the darkness of the Roman Catholic
[1:49:56] Church persecuting them chasing them
[1:50:00] down like
[1:50:01] dogs for 2,000 years there wasn't a Jew
[1:50:06] left in the promised
[1:50:08] land but the promise was still that they
[1:50:11] would be
[1:50:13] there God didn't put his promise
[1:50:17] away he blinded them so you could
[1:50:22] see what a shame it
[1:50:25] is for a gentile
[1:50:27] people for for Israel to pay this
[1:50:31] price for God to Blind his
[1:50:34] children for you and I can
[1:50:37] see and then we don't
[1:50:40] seek
[1:50:41] Revelation then we don't seek for the
[1:50:45] eyes of our
[1:50:46] understanding to be made
[1:50:49] known
[1:50:51] we put a period on the word of God
[1:50:55] instead of a Comm so that we can keep
[1:50:58] growing glory
[1:51:02] glory and Jesus said unto the Centurion
[1:51:05] verse
[1:51:07] 13 go thy
[1:51:09] way and as thou Hast
[1:51:12] believed a
[1:51:14] centurion a
[1:51:16] Roman a persecutor of the Jewish people
[1:51:20] the man
[1:51:23] believed when he heard Jesus
[1:51:26] preach he believed when he seen the
[1:51:29] power of God before his very
[1:51:32] eyes he
[1:51:35] believed I thought I had
[1:51:38] Authority but I just boss men
[1:51:42] around but this man with the power of
[1:51:45] His
[1:51:46] word he healed he saved he delivers he
[1:51:51] changes he molds the
[1:51:54] clay by the spoken
[1:51:58] word he can do it for you
[1:52:03] today you're the live
[1:52:06] bird full of the leprosy of
[1:52:09] sin he was the
[1:52:12] bird placed in an earth and
[1:52:15] vessel they killed him that bird they
[1:52:18] killed it in the Earth
[1:52:22] vessel you see who it was it was
[1:52:26] Jehovah in
[1:52:28] flesh who
[1:52:30] died for
[1:52:33] you someone say he did it for
[1:52:37] me he did it for me he did it for
[1:52:42] me you got to make it personal what he's
[1:52:46] done he did it for me
[1:52:54] and Jesus said unto the
[1:52:58] Centurion and as thou has believed so be
[1:53:01] it done unto thee and his servant was
[1:53:05] healed in the self same
[1:53:10] hour and when Jesus came into Peter's
[1:53:14] house and he saw his wife's mother laid
[1:53:17] sick of a fever
[1:53:24] he' healed
[1:53:26] lepers he healed men of the
[1:53:31] pulsing he had given sight to the
[1:53:36] Blind and
[1:53:37] Peter's Peter's his wife's
[1:53:42] mom she just had a
[1:53:46] fever a
[1:53:48] cold
[1:53:53] covid-19 the Bible says and he touched
[1:53:57] her
[1:54:00] hand he didn't say a
[1:54:03] prayer he just touched her
[1:54:06] hand that's
[1:54:08] all didn't say a
[1:54:10] word he just touched her the leper he
[1:54:15] didn't pray he just touched
[1:54:18] him but the Centurion
[1:54:21] said you don't have to touch
[1:54:24] me you don't have to touch my
[1:54:26] servant you don't even have to go where
[1:54:29] he is because I know that you know
[1:54:33] exactly where he is I know that you know
[1:54:37] exactly where I live I know that you
[1:54:41] know everything that you are a discerner
[1:54:45] of the heart and the
[1:54:48] intents
[1:54:51] all you have to
[1:54:52] do because I've been
[1:54:54] watching I've been listening I heard you
[1:54:57] preach on
[1:55:02] Perfection all I want you to
[1:55:06] do is just tell
[1:55:08] me he's

[1:56:45] 15 and the fever left her and she arose
[1:56:50] Rose and ministered unto
[1:56:52] them when the evening was come they
[1:56:56] brought unto him many that were
[1:56:58] possessed with
[1:57:00] devils and he cast out the spirits with
[1:57:03] his
[1:57:05] word and healed all that were
[1:57:08] sick that it might be fulfilled which
[1:57:10] was spoken by Isaiah the
[1:57:13] prophet saying
[1:57:15] himself took our
[1:57:18] infirmities
[1:57:20] and bear our
[1:57:22] sickness now when Jesus saw great
[1:57:24] multitudes about
[1:57:27] him he gave commandment to depart unto
[1:57:29] the other
[1:57:31] side the first poll of his
[1:57:35] ministry he was doing the work of an
[1:57:38] evangelist he was catching the attention
[1:57:42] of the
[1:57:43] people and he was catching the
[1:57:47] hearts of those you are the generation
[1:57:50] of Jesus
[1:57:54] Christ because long after the Miracles
[1:57:57] were
[1:57:59] over his children would bond with a love
[1:58:03] to
[1:58:07] him and they would follow him all the
[1:58:10] days of his
[1:58:16] life now when Jesus saw the Great
[1:58:19] multitudes about him he gave commandment
[1:58:22] to depart unto the other
[1:58:26] side and a certain scribe came and said
[1:58:29] unto him
[1:58:31] Master I'll follow thee whatsoever thou
[1:58:35] goest and Jesus saith unto
[1:58:37] him the foxes have
[1:58:41] holes the birds of the air have
[1:58:44] Nest but the son of man hath not to lay
[1:58:48] has hath not wear to lay his
[1:58:52] head he was speaking
[1:58:55] again in a
[1:58:58] parable you
[1:59:00] see he had come searching for a
[1:59:04] body of where to lay his
[1:59:07] head that
[1:59:09] body was the Bride of Jesus
[1:59:12] Christ and he wanted to place his
[1:59:17] headship but they thought it was literal
[1:59:21] they thought he really was talking about
[1:59:23] foxes and
[1:59:25] birds and Nest they thought he really
[1:59:28] didn't he really did mean his natural
[1:59:32] head no it was beyond
[1:59:36] that it was a
[1:59:38] prophecy and another of his disciples
[1:59:41] said unto him Lord suffer me first to go
[1:59:44] and bury my
[1:59:48] father
[1:59:50] and Jesus said unto him follow me and
[1:59:54] let the
[1:59:55] dead bury their
[2:00:00] dead the
[2:00:02] man was being
[2:00:05] tested we don't know if he passed the
[2:00:11] test but God tests us the same
[2:00:14] way he said Lord I'll follow you
[2:00:18] wherever thou goest
[2:00:20] I'll follow
[2:00:22] you I'll never forsake
[2:00:26] you Jesus
[2:00:28] said he says I believe you'll be able to
[2:00:31] do
[2:00:33] that when I come to
[2:00:35] you when you're born again when you
[2:00:38] receive the baptism of the
[2:00:40] Holy you'll put me
[2:00:42] first you'll follow me to the
[2:00:45] end because I'll be with you even in you
[2:00:52] and when he was entered into a
[2:00:55] ship his his disciples followed
[2:00:59] him and
[2:01:01] behold there Rose a great Tempest in the
[2:01:06] sea could he had stopped that Tempest
[2:01:09] before it even
[2:01:11] started did he know the storm was
[2:01:15] coming did he know it was going to shake
[2:01:17] his disciples
[2:01:19] shake their very
[2:01:21] Faith he knew all of that and behold
[2:01:25] there arose a great Tempest in the sea
[2:01:27] and so much that the ship was covered
[2:01:29] with the
[2:01:33] waves if you've ever been in a
[2:01:37] boat and the Sea starts getting
[2:01:41] rough I remember as a young
[2:01:44] man I was maybe 16 17
[2:01:51] and we went with some friends I was
[2:01:54] invited to go fishing down into Mexico
[2:01:58] an area an area called Puerto
[2:02:00] [Music]
[2:02:02] Loos back in the
[2:02:04] 1970s you gone pass and you'd hit the
[2:02:11] sand there was no more
[2:02:13] roads there was no stores there was
[2:02:17] nothing out there you just had to aim
[2:02:19] for the for the
[2:02:21] ocean and we get there and they had a
[2:02:25] boat about 20 foot long had a an out a
[2:02:30] motor on
[2:02:32] it 85
[2:02:35] horsepower seemed like it was powerful
[2:02:38] enough and it was we get in the boat he
[2:02:43] says we're going
[2:02:45] fishing got up early in the
[2:02:47] morning I said how long will will be out
[2:02:51] there till the sun goes down I said oh
[2:02:54] my I'd never been in a boat in the
[2:02:58] ocean and we head out we head out into
[2:03:01] the
[2:03:03] ocean I'm looking all
[2:03:06] around and I see no
[2:03:09] land I said this this doesn't feel
[2:03:12] good no
[2:03:14] land
[2:03:15] close and they're
[2:03:17] fishing
[2:03:19] and all of a sudden the waves start
[2:03:21] getting
[2:03:23] rough two or three foot
[2:03:25] high three or four feet high they get up
[2:03:29] to about five or six
[2:03:31] feet and that boat that seem
[2:03:34] safe it just feels like it's being
[2:03:36] thrown up and
[2:03:40] down and I'm begging them let's go back
[2:03:45] no no we're fishing but at some point
[2:03:49] the man who owned the
[2:03:50] boat a wave comes and lifts us
[2:03:54] up and he said pull up the anchor we're
[2:03:57] leaving and we get on that boat we're
[2:04:00] hitting the
[2:04:01] waves and it Lift us up and the wave
[2:04:05] would go we slam back
[2:04:09] down
[2:04:11] impossible to
[2:04:14] sleep I was scared to
[2:04:17] death I was I hadn't given my life to
[2:04:21] Christ but I'm saying Lord Jesus get me
[2:04:24] out of this one I
[2:04:27] promise we make it back to
[2:04:30] shore but that shook us and here the
[2:04:34] Bible says a great Tempest in the
[2:04:37] sea in so much that the ship was covered
[2:04:40] with the
[2:04:42] waves when we' hit a way and that came
[2:04:46] over the
[2:04:47] ship and it fall all over
[2:04:50] us I'm hanging on I'm saying can't you
[2:04:53] make this boat go faster get me out of
[2:04:57] here they giv it all that all it has to
[2:05:02] go and we're not moving fast
[2:05:07] enough the Bible says and his disciples
[2:05:10] came to him
[2:05:12] and saying
[2:05:15] Lord these are experienced fish F
[2:05:20] men they've been on boats since they
[2:05:23] were
[2:05:25] babies they've been in rough Seas all
[2:05:28] their
[2:05:31] lives but this
[2:05:34] storm is scaring these
[2:05:36] men who have years of
[2:05:42] experience and the ship's covered with
[2:05:47] waves but he Jesus the Bible
[2:05:51] says was
[2:05:53] asleep or so they thought that's what
[2:05:57] that's what Matthew thought in the boat
[2:06:00] so he writes it when I was in that boat
[2:06:04] we were fearing for our
[2:06:06] lives looks to me like Jesus was
[2:06:09] asleep how could he sleep in a storm
[2:06:12] like
[2:06:13] this and his disciples came to him and
[2:06:17] awoke him saying
[2:06:19] Lord save
[2:06:21] us we
[2:06:24] perish they were the
[2:06:26] fishermen they were the
[2:06:29] boatmen they were the ones with
[2:06:33] experience and they came to the
[2:06:36] Carpenter and said could you save
[2:06:42] us they came to the
[2:06:46] carpenter they said could you say save
[2:06:53] us you can go to the carpenter this
[2:06:57] morning and whatever need you
[2:06:59] have whatever desires on your
[2:07:03] heart you talk to the
[2:07:05] carpenter you ask him he's
[2:07:09] willing and if you can
[2:07:11] believe all things are
[2:07:14] possible to them that
[2:07:16] believe even the calming of a
[2:07:21] storm he spoke to the
[2:07:23] Storm at his first coming he spoke to
[2:07:27] the Storm at his second
[2:07:31] coming and a storm was rising up in the
[2:07:33] mountains of
[2:07:36] color within a few
[2:07:39] minutes it could dump 10et of
[2:07:43] snow and a prophet was out in that
[2:07:46] weather he says you
[2:07:49] speak you say it I'll back it up we've
[2:07:54] got to get to that
[2:07:56] place where we
[2:07:58] believe that if we express our
[2:08:02] faith Jesus can back it
[2:08:10] up he saith unto
[2:08:13] them why are you
[2:08:17] fearful
[2:08:19] you would think well it's obvious isn't
[2:08:21] it
[2:08:23] Jesus why are you
[2:08:26] fearful oh ye of little
[2:08:29] faith then he arose and rebuked the
[2:08:32] winds and the
[2:08:35] Sea and there was a great
[2:08:40] calm like
[2:08:44] that they're soaking
[2:08:47] wet they're
[2:08:49] shaking and all of a
[2:08:51] sudden the sea is as still as
[2:08:58] glass and even though they asked him to
[2:09:01] do
[2:09:02] it when he did it the Bible says but the
[2:09:06] men
[2:09:08] marveled saying what manner of man is
[2:09:13] this that even the winds in the sea
[2:09:17] B
[2:09:19] you know what kind of man he
[2:09:22] was he was a
[2:09:24] bird in the earth
[2:09:28] vessel that's the kind of man he was he
[2:09:32] was God in
[2:09:33] flesh that's the kind of man he
[2:09:37] was he was one who could open the book
[2:09:40] and loose the Seven Seals that's the
[2:09:43] kind of man he was what manner of man is
[2:09:47] this it was God made flesh amongst
[2:09:54] us verse 28 says and when he was come to
[2:09:58] the other
[2:10:00] side into the country of the
[2:10:04] gesus there met
[2:10:06] him two possessed with
[2:10:09] Devils two of them coming out of the
[2:10:13] tombs exceeding
[2:10:15] Fierce so that no man might pass by that
[2:10:20] way and behold they cried out
[2:10:23] saying what have we to do with thee
[2:10:26] Jesus th Son of
[2:10:30] God the first time any anyone ever
[2:10:34] recognized
[2:10:35] him when the disciples saw him calm the
[2:10:40] sea they said what kind of a man is
[2:10:44] he when the when the devils and these
[2:10:46] men saw him
[2:10:50] they said
[2:10:51] Jesus Son of God Art Thou come hither to
[2:10:56] torment
[2:10:58] us we're the we're the
[2:11:01] tormentors we specialize in tormenting
[2:11:06] people but when you come around we
[2:11:09] realize you're getting ready to torment
[2:11:13] us and you're going to set these two men
[2:11:17] free they were
[2:11:20] scared not
[2:11:22] Jes but they recognized him
[2:11:27] immediately what it will what will it
[2:11:30] take in our
[2:11:32] lives for us to
[2:11:37] recognize and that he wants to wash
[2:11:43] us that bird two turtle doves those
[2:11:52] Tas handed over to the
[2:11:54] priest the priest would lay them on the
[2:11:59] table two live
[2:12:01] Birds he would take the
[2:12:04] one and place it in thisn
[2:12:09] vessel what was it that was the
[2:12:13] immaculate birth of Jesus
[2:12:17] Christ
[2:12:18] God being placed in a vessel of
[2:12:24] clay and in that vessel of
[2:12:27] clay the priest would reach
[2:12:31] in and kill the
[2:12:34] bird that bird died in The Vessel of
[2:12:42] clay he died on the cross of
[2:12:45] Calvary in that vessel of clay
[2:12:50] so that you and I could be
[2:12:53] sprinkled with the blood of
[2:12:58] Jesus and the sprinkling of of the
[2:13:01] blood has the power to wash us to
[2:13:06] cleanse us to make us white as
[2:13:11] snow the sprinkling of the
[2:13:13] blood has the power to take away any ly
[2:13:20] Spirit take away the lust of the flesh
[2:13:24] the lust of the eye and the pride of
[2:13:27] life the sprinkling of the
[2:13:30] blood has the
[2:13:33] power to make you
[2:13:37] willing to go the extra mile with your
[2:13:41] brother the sprinkling of the
[2:13:44] blood has the power to convict
[2:13:46] him
[2:13:48] convict
[2:13:57] you the sprinkling of the
[2:14:00] blood does all of this for you and more
[2:14:05] for the sprinkling of the
[2:14:08] blood of that bird that died in an earn
[2:14:13] vessel the man that died on the cross of
[2:14:16] calv
[2:14:19] the body of
[2:14:21] Jesus was that Earth
[2:14:25] vessel and the life that died in that
[2:14:29] body was God's
[2:14:31] son
[2:14:33] Jehovah paid a
[2:14:38] price he paid a
[2:14:40] price he did not
[2:14:42] owe we owed a
[2:14:45] price we could not pay
[2:14:48] he came to wash our sins
[2:14:52] away and take away from
[2:14:55] us the
[2:14:57] curse of our sex
[2:15:00] birth and cause us to be born again the
[2:15:04] Born Again experience is a supernatural
[2:15:09] birth it's an Immaculate birth it's a
[2:15:13] spoken word
[2:15:14] birth it's not natural at all
[2:15:20] Supernatural how do I get it then
[2:15:24] repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:15:27] the Lord
[2:15:29] Jesus and when you genuinely
[2:15:33] repent like little Joseph
[2:15:36] did and was baptized in
[2:15:39] water that day that morning God baptized
[2:15:44] him with the Holy
[2:15:45] Ghost now he's growing
[2:15:49] little by
[2:15:50] little inch by
[2:15:53] inch Jesus is taking him
[2:15:57] higher and he wants to do that for every
[2:15:59] one of
[2:16:02] us be
[2:16:05] sprinkled with the
[2:16:07] blood of this bird that died in an earth
[2:16:14] vessel it was a type it was a shadow
[2:16:19] it was
[2:16:20] Jesus on the cross of Calvary as we
