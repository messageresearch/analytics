bless you all this morning thank God for the worship we thank him for those those Praises coming forth from the hearts of his children and and he's pleased and when he's pleased with our worship then he comes down and he visits us and he speaks to our hearts but there must come a a worship first that's what brings him on the scene his hearts that are being tenderized lives that are being changed thoughts that are being renewed people who are thinking on him meditating on him night and day oh blessed is that people meditate upon his word word he is his word night and day every moment thinking about him thinking of his glory thinking of what he's done for you looking back 50 years well some of you aren't old enough to think back 50 years but as I think back 50 years I see the amazing grace of God that lift stood up a young boy lost in sin wandering no directions no there was a direction it was it was and I was pointing straight to the pit of Hell God rich in Mercy his eyes were upon me every moment and I didn't know it he was watching for me and I didn't know it he he was he was he would walk by my side and I couldn't feel him but one day by his Amazing Grace he came down he stirred my heart and he wasn't going to leave me until I could recognize but why me he says because you're my son because you're my daughter cuz I won't let you wander in sin no more I'm going to make a way and he did he made a way on the cross of Calvary he made a way for healing most important the healing of our hearts and he come that we could be born again that that just like Adam in the beginning he placed that Spirit man in a flesh body the Bible says and he became a living soul and he would have continued being a living Soul broken to Eternity but they chose because God because God gave them free moral agency and they didn't choose and and Satan didn't present them with a different no no he just presented Eve with a shortcut claiming that this shortcut will actually take you to the presence of God and his plan faster because you don't know how soon he's going to come but I can take you there faster it's the same plan same Bible the serpent said trust me she did but he lied to her because the serpent was the devil's first Apostle the the serpent was the devil's first Pastor the serpent was the devil's first evangelist the serpent was the with the de was the devil's first teacher but when you're taught of Lucifer you're taught to speak lies you're taught to teach violence because he himself is a murderer and a liar from the beginning so when he is your teacher guess what it'll make you like you say I see now I see why now there's message churches and that are acting a certain way because they're not listening they've been told by the lies of the devil I can get you where you where you're going quicker I'll give you a shortcut but the shortcut is death there's only life through Jesus Christ as we stand to our feet this morning want to make everybody welcome brother Enrique family welcome this morning and we're going to turn to the Book of Matthew and Matthew chapter 8 this is part two last service was part one we entitled it Jesus evangelist Prophet Mighty Angel this morning it's still about Jesus evangelist Prophet King of the Jews Matthew chapter 8 and verse one when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this morning add your blessings this morning by giving us by opening the understanding of our eyes for when our eyes are open our hearts are changed and we can never be the same again we thank you now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated we began last service speaking there in Matthew chapter 4 and Ma Matthew 4 began the ministry of Jesus Christ as an evangelist praying for the sick healing healing all kinds of sickness all kinds of torments all kinds of infirmities all types of serious diseases and he began there as a as an evangelist it was part one of his ministry but and his ministry would have three changes in it he would unfold the the role of an evangelist and his only message that he would preach during this time was repent that was all but more would be added as the ministry went on but he cried out to the people repent and seek ye first the kingdom of heaven then he would pray for the sick and thousands begin to gather a multitude is thousands of people and he and he had healing campaigns in the different cities throughout all Judea all Galilee praying for the sick and just simp simply ministering and praying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven it was hand he was doing the work of an evangelist this is the first coming of Christ and this would repeat at the second coming of Christ because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and changing in all his ways so when you see the pattern of the first coming you can be sure it'll be the pattern of the second coming God won't change what he's done he's unchanging in all his ways we read that in chapter five of Matthew the Bible says that he went up into a mountain and there his disciples all sat with him and he now began teaching them he went beyond just repent but the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand but once he had caught the attention of the people with the Miracles with the healing where the blind saw and the lame walk and the death were hearing Miracles that the people could see knowing that no man could do this to be God bring this miraculous things to pass he had caught their attention now the thousands were flocking to him they would sit in Open Fields just waiting for him to do his work and when they began coming and coming and he caught the attention of the people it was the first pool of his ministry but he had a purpose he wanted them to get accustomed to trust him to follow him and once they were following him they it's true they were following him for the bread and the fishes and the Miracles but in chapter five he does something different now the multitudes gather and he stands before them and he begins to teach blessed are the born Spirits the teaching was a teaching like they had never heard before no Rabbi had ever spoke like this man spoke for he was taking them beyond the law now he was taking them into the grace of God and the grace of God can change a man the grace of God can change a woman that it can change the way you talk it can change the way you think it can change your behavior that's what the grace of God can do for us the law could never change you the law could only say we find you guilty the s for you and this guilt is death the grace of God though it finds you guilty the gra says but you know what I'm going to take your place I'm going to pay your price I'm going to set you free and mercy says no I'm not going to let you go you won't die like men died before you be born again if you receive my Amazing Grace So chapter five 6 and seven was Jesus preaching on Perfection they'd never heard something before in that day under the law they didn't believe that man could be made perfect they don't believe it today I spoke to a man a fine man I've shared it before he was uh one of the pastors for a denomination called the CCV here in the valley they have several churches each church has five 4,000 members and I was doing some work for him in his home a few years ago and we got to speak in a little bit I began sharing some things with him of this open book of this revealed word of these Seven Seals don't let Seven Seals scare you you see God just used those terms to hide his word from the eyes of the wise and prudent but as I told told you before Seven Seals is just seven parts of one divine plan to restore Israel the Fig Tree and restore you and I tree it's seven parts of this one plan in the mind of God for him to sweep down great Jehovah eagle spread as we in this 20th century in the days of Jesus at his first coming he was flying down to pull all his children out of the chicken houses Catholic Baptist Pentecostal Nazar and the list goes on even message chickes he's come to pull us out to set us free to give us two Wings the revelation of old and new testament which is really the revelation of Jesus Christ it's really about Jesus the message that's always been the message Christ in us the hope of glory so in Matthew 5 Jesus is bringing a teaching to the people who had really who had really gathered that day to see the Miracles but God was going to do something greater he was going to give them his word that would change their hearts and change their minds and make them a different people this word that he would give them would open a door so that they could be born again so they could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that every day of their life had that if they needed it they could receive a refilling of that Holy Spirit so that we could grow in the very character of Jesus Christ to the stature of a perfect man so Revelations 5 as we've shared before verse 48 Jesus said to the multitude he says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven I shared that with this with this one brother a pastor from this church he says he smiles he says oh Daniel he says you don't you don't understand we cannot be perfect in this body in this life his name was Bert I said Bert you tell me you're a pastor you share the gospel who should I believe should I believe what I just read that Jesus said or should I just believe what you told me that what he said is impossible maybe we're looking at this can the wrong way CU Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven and he goes we can't be perfect it's like he wanted to believe we could we there's a there's a a hope and a chance but he just could because his denomination and and and his theology had told him different for years and years he was a man my very same age we were one day apart in age I was one day older than him so I would tell him you see what I'm telling you today within 24 hours I'm praying that you'll be where I am he says you got 24 hours and you'll be right where I am he said I don't know about that Daniel but Jesus said be ye therefore perfect I shared them I said do you know why Jesus said he says no he says but I sense you're going to tell me I am going to tell you he say it's because of the other previous 47 verses and we've read past it all our lives we didn't understand it we didn't understand the Bible but when we got to verse 48 all of a sudden we think we understand we don't understand 47 verses but we go to 48 I know one thing for sure we can't be this that Jesus said we could be but the other 47 verses that he preached on it you ask what does that mean well it's I don't know but I'm I'm pretty sure that 48 doesn't mean what he said it means but Jesus said be ye therefore perfect because of the other 47 verses that I've been teaching you but it'll require a revelation see and Jesus preaches on perfection verse 5 verse six and verse S he's on this Mount and verse 81 is where we left off last in chapter 8 Matthew 8 verse one it says and when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed they had been waiting for the Miracles and he kept them waiting and instead he gave them his word instead he gave them a word that was a character building word instead he gave them a word on how they should conduct themselves instead he gave them a word of how to apply Faith to their Revelation and verse 81 Matthew 81 he finished his teaching on Perfection for a New Testament Church for the Bride of Jesus Christ for those that would follow him and his divine grace instead of Moses and the law verse two says and behold there came a leper who' been listening to his teaching on Perfection a leper is a person whose body is being deformed and the sickness is eating away at his flesh it's possible for a leper a person who becomes a leper to live as long in misery and pain for 50 years it was a miserable it was a miserable wretched way to die it was a slow death but a sure death there was no healing there was no herbs there was no incantation that once you got leprosy it was a miserable death sentence it was a constant torment but this leper had sat and listened to the word preached this leper had listen to those 47 verses and when he heard Jesus said therefore perfect of the thousands that were listening this divinely revealed mystery truth one man full of leprosy that had to stand apart way away from everyone he couldn't get close to the Thousand he could barely hear Jesus but he listened to every word from a distance and this leper who had been listening to the word who for the moment while he was listening forgot about his troubles forgot about his leprosy forgot about his rejection forgot how everybody shunned him forgot how he had been put out of the church and out of the synagogue he believed in perfection and he looked at his body he says I need what he's talking about and the first thing he did he says and behold there came a leper and worshiped him you see what worship does you see what a genu wine heart that's been broken and contrite how it responds if we're not worshippers don't expect to receive Revelation and behold there came a leper and worshiped him saying Lord if thou will thou can makes me clean he says you said we could be perfect and I believe you and if you want to you can make me perfect even in this flesh body but Perfection was beyond the flesh body but sometimes that's where God starts with us he does something special he gives you a job you were praying for he gives you a wife you were praying for he gives you a husband you were praying for he raises you up off of a death bed in a hospital he does something that you can see with your eyes that you can hear with your ears so that you'll have faith to ask for something that no one can see that you're struggling with that no one can see the inner torment of heart so you can have faith that he can heal that part now this leper came and worshiped him it it wasn't something to brag about the to be a rabbi and to say guess what the lepers are worshiping me that was nothing to wor to to to to brag about in the days of Jesus that was nothing to brag about under the law on the contrary the lepers had their own colony the priests were sure to push them there and keep them there don't come close to the congregation don't you dare try and open come to the synagogue you live far away from us don't touch me and I won't touch they were a rejected people because of this sickness that was in their body that could be seen on their faces on their hands and the moans of their constant suffering could be heard and here comes this leper to Jesus and he worships him and Jesus did what no Rabbi had ever done Jesus did what no Minister had ever done Jesus did what no Apostle Prophet priest had ever done Jesus put his put forth his hand this man full of leprosy and he touched him and everybody goes he's going to have leprosy now he's contaminated now no not when he touches you him touching you doesn't hurt him him touching you saves you and healers you oh we need a touch from him this morning and Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will every one of you are here this morning because Jesus is touched you and he said I will I will I'll heal your complexes I'll heal your inner struggles I'll heal the torment that's in your mind he's telling you this morning I Jesus I will I will and Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean and two weeks later no and one year later and it took a whole 24 hours and immediately his leprosy was cleansed by faith this morning whatever is the burden in your heart you can say Lord I know that thou can make me clean from things on the inside that no one knows and no one can see the torment I'm in but if thou will you can make me clean if you let him touch you this morning the effects of his touch this morning will be immediate it'll be right now it'll be yay and amen and Jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thy way show thyself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony unto them and when Jesus entered into Capernaum they came unto Centurion beseeching him let's go back to verse four and Jesus said to this leper who had been cleaned there wasn't a spot of leprosy left on this person he told them see thou tell no man but go thy way show thyself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses command for a testimony as far as we know this is the first time in Jewish history in perhaps 1500 years that a leper who was a Jew had been healed Jesus told him go and go to the priest show thyself that you've been cleansed and offer the gift that Moses commanded for the gift he was to take it was in three parts but the first part he was to take two turtle doves before the priest the priest would take one of the doves and put it in an earn vessel and they would kill the one the one the one turtle dove in this earn vessel you know what it represented this dying Dove this bird killed in an earth vessel it represented Jehovah God that came and dwelt in a vessel of clay and in that vessel of clay will die for you and I to cleanse our leprosy this is what this this this represented these two living birds to be a testimony of the cleansing power the blood of the Lamb amen the bird that was placed in the earth and vessel represented God in and while in this earth and vessel it was in this earth and vessel killed the bird it represented God made flesh and in that flesh he would die someone say for me I'm the leopard then they would take the blood of that dead bird that one that died on Calvary that one that died in a vessel of clay they would take his blood and they would sprinkle it on the live bird seven times for the blood of Jesus Christ through seven Church ches would be sprinkled on his bride sprinkled on his children sprinkled on you and I then the living bird the priest would take it walked into an open field and set it free guess who the living bird sprinkled with the blood of the Dead one guess who it is somebody say it's me I'm that one sprinkled with the blood of this bird that died in an earth vessel Jesus Christ made flesh do you see it God hiding in Simplicity in two birds and one dies in an earn vessel and his blood is sprinkled on the living bird the living bird was full of leprosy the living bird that was full of complexes the living bird that was sick in body the living bird that had problems living for Christ the living bird that at one time was ashamed of the Gospel that living bird that was spr sprled the sprinkling of that living bird was the washing of the water of the word in your life and mine and the bird in the earth and vessel was Jehovah God he died God gave his life for you in an earn vessel called Jesus of Nazareth and Moses said go offer the gift commanded that was testifying that the man that he that had cleansed him was actually God in an earn vessel and they didn't know it they couldn't figure out the mystery it wasn't the proverb and and the ritual was not revealed to them they did it literally and didn't understand what they were doing didn't understand what it represented didn't understand that that day ritual was being fulfilled no longer a mystery no longer a [Music] ritual the manifested word of God and Jesus had told them see thou tell no man and he goes and offers this man is happy this man is excited this man is emotional because to whom much is given or to whom much is Forgiven to whom much is Forgiven that one will be very happy his happiness will flood over and he's thinking I feel like I want to scream and tell the [Music] world but Jesus told me tell no man maybe he meant I shouldn't just tell one man I know I'll tell the world what Jesus did for me instead of one man I'll tell every man I come to I'll tell my family I'll tell my father I'll tell my mother I'll tell my children that Jesus heals and he's coming back for you and I and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion a Roman a Roman soldier a Roman ROM Man Captain he was in charge of 100 Roman soldiers by the time you got to the place in the Roman army you were a well trained soldier you were a man with a lot of blood on your hands you were a man that had killed many you are a powerful man physically and this Roman Centurion he must have been he must have been listening to this message on Perfection he must have seen Jesus when he touched and healed this leper he must have known this leper he had seen him wandering the streets before and now he sees them clean and he comes to Jesus and saying Lord my servant lith at home sick of the py grievously tormented he shakes uncontrollably he can't talk clearly no more he's getting worse by the day this man has served me well he says my and Lord my servant lith at home sick of the pully grievously tormented Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said he's a Roman he's a gentile he's a pagan all his life he's been saying Caesar is my king Cesar is my God Rome is who I serve and now for a moment Faith Rises up in this pagan pag a persecutor of Israel a killer of Jews but he heard and he saw a leper healed this man knows about power or he thinks he does the Centurion answer answered and said Lord I'm not worthy that thou should us come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed you know how this Centurion got things done he'd say to his soldiers you and you go over there you two go over there the rest of you stand right in this place and don't move the rest of the day and he' turn around walk away knowing that every man would do exactly what he said and he makes it known in verse n he says for I am a man under authority of the Caesar of Rome of of men that are called Roman perfects a Roman perfect was another level of authority in the Roman army a Roman perfect was in charge of many centurions so he had authority over thousands of soldiers and then and the Centurion answered and said I am a man under Authority and I have soldiers under me and I say my voice my word my commandment I say to this man go and he goeth to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do it when Jesus heard it he marel and he said to them that followed barely I say unto you I have not found so great a Faith No not in Israel that this man isn't waiting for Jesus to discern him this man is saying just speak the word you don't have to do any anything else a prophet said I should have discerned one or two persons and the rest of you should have just believed that he's here that he's present that he's able that he's willing but no he said one and another another another and instead of people grabbing the word by faith and their hearts are saying now discern me brother brandom he says I should have never have done that the Holy Spirit told me you did wrong he said when we went to Africa Durban South Africa dur God did some Miracles you should have seen the thousands come when that blind man was healed on the platform he was a worshiper of the Sun his eyes were burned out and God gave him sight he said you should have seen the thousands run to Christ when they saw that and when Jesus heard it verse 10 he mared and said to them that followed verely I say unto you I have not found so great faith not in Israel because when Jesus came to Israel Israel was a chicken house a house Israel was as far away from God as the Roman nation was but Israel was God's people but when he came to them he said how often have I Jehovah Jesus tried to gather you as a hen gathers her brood and you would not you've heard that he's Jehovah Eagle but to the Jews it sounds awful to say it but the god of Heaven came he said because where you're at in the chicken yard of ungodliness I've come down to become Jehovah hen to enter into your chicken yard to to draw you out of that and you would not I left the king I left the Throne of Glory to enter your chicken yard Catholic Baptist Pentecostal message chicken yard he left the Throne of Glory to come yet we would not leave the chicken yard we wouldn't stop pecking on the dirt when the heavens are full of the rations of and they say no it's too controversial and I don't need that for my salvation so Book of Revelations no don't need it don't read it no more not necessary so all of a sudden they have enough Revelation to tell us what part of this book of the Bible they don't need need no more that's denominational thinking that's taking on the the lies of the devil when God is offering Revelation from Genesis toyp and the revelation of this Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ Jesus says in verse 11 of Matthew 8 and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven why not the North and South because East is the rising of the sun his first coming West is the setting of The Sun East is the beginning of a plan of Restoration West is the setting of the sun god comes and finally takes his little bride home when the dead in Christ shall rise which are alive and remain at the time of the setting of The sun will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and the west and shall sit down with Abraham and and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven verse 12 but the Children of the Kingdom shall be cast out notice as he's speaking here in verse 11 he says and many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob this was a prophecy of the Jewish people of a Plan of Redemption of a Plan of Salvation of a plan of Jesus coming back back for his for these Jewish people his children also the generation of Jesus Christ he says and shall sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven Abraham Isaac Jacob all Jews verse 12 is also Jews but the children of of the Kingdom what kingdom the kingdom of Abraham Jacob speaking it's a prophecy it's a parable he's speaking about the Jewish people but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of te it was the first coming of Christ Jesus was prophesying that Israel these children of the Kingdom that had to be blinded for you and I to be saved they will be cast out outside of Jerusalem outside of the promised land from the days of Jesus the Jews were scattered the world over the Promised Land by by 135 ad there wasn't hardly a Jew left in the promised land and for almost 2,000 years they were scattered the world over that's what the scripture is speaking of the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness the darkness of an ungodly world the darkness of the Roman Catholic Church persecuting them chasing them down like dogs for 2,000 years there wasn't a Jew left in the promised land but the promise was still that they would be there God didn't put his promise away he blinded them so you could see what a shame it is for a gentile people for for Israel to pay this price for God to Blind his children for you and I can see and then we don't seek Revelation then we don't seek for the eyes of our understanding to be made known we put a period on the word of God instead of a Comm so that we can keep growing glory glory and Jesus said unto the Centurion verse 13 go thy way and as thou Hast believed a centurion a Roman a persecutor of the Jewish people the man believed when he heard Jesus preach he believed when he seen the power of God before his very eyes he believed I thought I had Authority but I just boss men around but this man with the power of His word he healed he saved he delivers he changes he molds the clay by the spoken word he can do it for you today you're the live bird full of the leprosy of sin he was the bird placed in an earth and vessel they killed him that bird they killed it in the Earth vessel you see who it was it was Jehovah in flesh who died for you someone say he did it for me he did it for me he did it for me you got to make it personal what he's done he did it for me and Jesus said unto the Centurion and as thou has believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self same hour and when Jesus came into Peter's house and he saw his wife's mother laid sick of a fever he' healed lepers he healed men of the pulsing he had given sight to the Blind and Peter's Peter's his wife's mom she just had a fever a cold covid-19 the Bible says and he touched her hand he didn't say a prayer he just touched her hand that's all didn't say a word he just touched her the leper he didn't pray he just touched him but the Centurion said you don't have to touch me you don't have to touch my servant you don't even have to go where he is because I know that you know exactly where he is I know that you know exactly where I live I know that you know everything that you are a discerner of the heart and the intents all you have to do because I've been watching I've been listening I heard you preach on Perfection all I want you to do is just tell me he's healed and I'll go walking home knowing he's he just say it you've got a need this morning you've got a desire in your heart say Lord I know that thou can heal me of this torment and you know what he say he wants to he's willing and he's speaking to your heart this morning he says I will you can be free of every complex of every struggle I'll give you the petition of your heart whatever it might be a relationship problem a job issue a sickness in our body whatever it is a loved one needs Christ say Lord just say it and I'll believe it and I'll wait and watch it happen he touched her hand verse 15 and the fever left her and she arose Rose and ministered unto them when the evening was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our sickness now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart unto the other side the first poll of his ministry he was doing the work of an evangelist he was catching the attention of the people and he was catching the hearts of those you are the generation of Jesus Christ because long after the Miracles were over his children would bond with a love to him and they would follow him all the days of his life now when Jesus saw the Great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart unto the other side and a certain scribe came and said unto him Master I'll follow thee whatsoever thou goest and Jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes the birds of the air have Nest but the son of man hath not to lay has hath not wear to lay his head he was speaking again in a parable you see he had come searching for a body of where to lay his head that body was the Bride of Jesus Christ and he wanted to place his headship but they thought it was literal they thought he really was talking about foxes and birds and Nest they thought he really didn't he really did mean his natural head no it was beyond that it was a prophecy and another of his disciples said unto him Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father and Jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead the man was being tested we don't know if he passed the test but God tests us the same way he said Lord I'll follow you wherever thou goest I'll follow you I'll never forsake you Jesus said he says I believe you'll be able to do that when I come to you when you're born again when you receive the baptism of the Holy you'll put me first you'll follow me to the end because I'll be with you even in you and when he was entered into a ship his his disciples followed him and behold there Rose a great Tempest in the sea could he had stopped that Tempest before it even started did he know the storm was coming did he know it was going to shake his disciples shake their very Faith he knew all of that and behold there arose a great Tempest in the sea and so much that the ship was covered with the waves if you've ever been in a boat and the Sea starts getting rough I remember as a young man I was maybe 16 17 and we went with some friends I was invited to go fishing down into Mexico an area an area called Puerto [Music] Loos back in the 1970s you gone pass and you'd hit the sand there was no more roads there was no stores there was nothing out there you just had to aim for the for the ocean and we get there and they had a boat about 20 foot long had a an out a motor on it 85 horsepower seemed like it was powerful enough and it was we get in the boat he says we're going fishing got up early in the morning I said how long will will be out there till the sun goes down I said oh my I'd never been in a boat in the ocean and we head out we head out into the ocean I'm looking all around and I see no land I said this this doesn't feel good no land close and they're fishing and all of a sudden the waves start getting rough two or three foot high three or four feet high they get up to about five or six feet and that boat that seem safe it just feels like it's being thrown up and down and I'm begging them let's go back no no we're fishing but at some point the man who owned the boat a wave comes and lifts us up and he said pull up the anchor we're leaving and we get on that boat we're hitting the waves and it Lift us up and the wave would go we slam back down impossible to sleep I was scared to death I was I hadn't given my life to Christ but I'm saying Lord Jesus get me out of this one I promise we make it back to shore but that shook us and here the Bible says a great Tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the waves when we' hit a way and that came over the ship and it fall all over us I'm hanging on I'm saying can't you make this boat go faster get me out of here they giv it all that all it has to go and we're not moving fast enough the Bible says and his disciples came to him and saying Lord these are experienced fish F men they've been on boats since they were babies they've been in rough Seas all their lives but this storm is scaring these men who have years of experience and the ship's covered with waves but he Jesus the Bible says was asleep or so they thought that's what that's what Matthew thought in the boat so he writes it when I was in that boat we were fearing for our lives looks to me like Jesus was asleep how could he sleep in a storm like this and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying Lord save us we perish they were the fishermen they were the boatmen they were the ones with experience and they came to the Carpenter and said could you save us they came to the carpenter they said could you say save us you can go to the carpenter this morning and whatever need you have whatever desires on your heart you talk to the carpenter you ask him he's willing and if you can believe all things are possible to them that believe even the calming of a storm he spoke to the Storm at his first coming he spoke to the Storm at his second coming and a storm was rising up in the mountains of color within a few minutes it could dump 10et of snow and a prophet was out in that weather he says you speak you say it I'll back it up we've got to get to that place where we believe that if we express our faith Jesus can back it up he saith unto them why are you fearful you would think well it's obvious isn't it Jesus why are you fearful oh ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the Sea and there was a great calm like that they're soaking wet they're shaking and all of a sudden the sea is as still as glass and even though they asked him to do it when he did it the Bible says but the men marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds in the sea B you know what kind of man he was he was a bird in the earth vessel that's the kind of man he was he was God in flesh that's the kind of man he was he was one who could open the book and loose the Seven Seals that's the kind of man he was what manner of man is this it was God made flesh amongst us verse 28 says and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gesus there met him two possessed with Devils two of them coming out of the tombs exceeding Fierce so that no man might pass by that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee Jesus th Son of God the first time any anyone ever recognized him when the disciples saw him calm the sea they said what kind of a man is he when the when the devils and these men saw him they said Jesus Son of God Art Thou come hither to torment us we're the we're the tormentors we specialize in tormenting people but when you come around we realize you're getting ready to torment us and you're going to set these two men free they were scared not Jes but they recognized him immediately what it will what will it take in our lives for us to recognize and that he wants to wash us that bird two turtle doves those Tas handed over to the priest the priest would lay them on the table two live Birds he would take the one and place it in thisn vessel what was it that was the immaculate birth of Jesus Christ God being placed in a vessel of clay and in that vessel of clay the priest would reach in and kill the bird that bird died in The Vessel of clay he died on the cross of Calvary in that vessel of clay so that you and I could be sprinkled with the blood of Jesus and the sprinkling of of the blood has the power to wash us to cleanse us to make us white as snow the sprinkling of the blood has the power to take away any ly Spirit take away the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life the sprinkling of the blood has the power to make you willing to go the extra mile with your brother the sprinkling of the blood has the power to convict him convict you the sprinkling of the blood does all of this for you and more for the sprinkling of the blood of that bird that died in an earn vessel the man that died on the cross of calv the body of Jesus was that Earth vessel and the life that died in that body was God's son Jehovah paid a price he paid a price he did not owe we owed a price we could not pay he came to wash our sins away and take away from us the curse of our sex birth and cause us to be born again the Born Again experience is a supernatural birth it's an Immaculate birth it's a spoken word birth it's not natural at all Supernatural how do I get it then repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when you genuinely repent like little Joseph did and was baptized in water that day that morning God baptized him with the Holy Ghost now he's growing little by little inch by inch Jesus is taking him higher and he wants to do that for every one of us be sprinkled with the blood of this bird that died in an earth vessel it was a type it was a shadow it was Jesus on the cross of Calvary as we stand to our
