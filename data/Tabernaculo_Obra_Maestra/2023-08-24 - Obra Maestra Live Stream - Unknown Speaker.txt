Psalms 37 and we'll be begin in verse one this is a Psalm of David the king he wrote many of the Psalms but he didn't write all of this many were written by by other writers but this one is a Psalm of David it says fret not thyself because of evil doers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither is the green herbs then the Lord and do good so shall thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed yeah it's a promise that God was going to watch over you and take care of you is [Music] a delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass it's a positive message even in the Old Testament and as we as we speak on it more tonight you don't see why this was such a positive song and verse 6 and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the Noonday and the Holy Spirit through David says and he the almighty God shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light is sunlight because you're gonna have to believe me but they didn't have LEDs they didn't have electric lights when David was speaking of Life of how it rises how it starts just barely breaking out in the morning and it gets greater and greater and greater and upon that inspiration he said and he God shall bring forth thy righteousness in other words he'll bring he'll cause you to do the right thing until until your light your righteousness is shining so bright people say how can you live that life is and I didn't even realize how bright my light was shining us but everyone else sorry shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the Noonday then he says rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him to prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass cease from anger forsake Wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil for evil evil doers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the earth Heavenly Father we ask your blessing upon thy words Lord we know there's something for everyone and it may not be the same expression or the same word the great Holy Spirit you know how to speak speak a little here and a little there that everyone can be touched and go out in Courage tonight that they've been in your presence that you led them here tonight we thank you now in Jesus name amen verse 10 says for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea Thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be nice but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of peace pass the wicked planteth against the just just and Nash upon him with his teeth the Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming the wicked have drawn out the sword and have been their bow because the wicked are the ones that are ready to do violence but not the born-again believer the wicked have drawn out the sword so Espada and have been their bow to cast down the poor and needy to slay such as be of upright conversations verse 15 their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many Wicked oh God's reminding us of many things here in our daily walk for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the Lord upholdeth the righteousness the Lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inherit irritants shall be forever there was a Psalm of inheritance it was a Psalm of how he would bless the righteous and how he would bring righteousness to you in verse 19 they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied but the wicked Shall Perish and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume away the wicked borroweth verse 21. how is that different from a righteous one borrowing it says the wicked borrowers and payeth not again but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth give us even more than he borrowed at times verse 22 for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighted in his way it's these steps that we want to speak of tonight these steps were all made possible to us by a book that was opened the Bible a book that was open the Lamb's Book of Life turn with me to Revelations chapter six and verse 1. the visions of John here in Revelation six it was the time of the opening of these Seven Seals you say what is Seven Seals brother Daniels Seven Seals in this new testament there's a new covenant made possible by the blood of Jesus Christ is seven parts of one divine plan and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it was the noise of thunder one of the four be sane come and see a great Plan of Redemption of restoration how we can be born again how we can be changed from these natural men and women that we are somos in Revelations chapter five and verse 5. John again seen all these visions and in this Vision in chapter five John sees one that's sitting on a throne so it must be a king and it is a king yes but it's the King of Kings it's the father and he's holding a book in his hands and this book that he has sealed with Seven Seals the back side of the book and the reason it's hit it's on the back side of the book because in the days of John they didn't have a book like this no no no they had Scrolls and the Scrolls would roll up that was their book and the way they would close the books they maybe wrap a piece of leather on it they might even take and pour wax over the top of that and if it was a king he'd push his ring into the rat wax that means that this Scrolls and there would be a time and a certain person alone would be given the the Revelation and the ability to lose the seals and the next thing that happens is there's a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice this book must be open yesterday this is the book of Salvation on the prophets were until John divine grace and God wanted to extend his grace extend the born-again experience to be able to overcome every strong Temptation and a strong angel said and to take the seal off because there's a message on the inside and the by and the Bible tells us no man on Earth and read the message that was given the Bible says that John went much when he found that no man was worthy to open foreign foreign who was it beginning he said behold he said in verse 5. The Lion of the tribe of Judah that's Jesus Christ in his Earthly Ministry the root of David that's Jesus Christ [Music] so then what was the ministry of Jesus Christ they come to to the human race with an open book in his head a book that was in the hands of the Kingdom descended from the throne that he gave to his son the Lord Jesus that was a book of Salvation that's the book you hold in your hands tonight a book that teaches you how to live um Israel no more under the laws he was extending to them Grace salvation how to be changed and have overcoming pounds we read out of the book of Psalms 37. is really the inspiration from which the Lord Jesus himself perfect so we want to share that tonight because the book is open to us what part what was the seal part the sealed part watch how God writes his Bible is the part that's discarded it's not the keeping parts it's the part that's discarded the part you want once the seal is loose is you want a book you want to scroll you want you want the ability to be able to open it you want the ability to be able to read it and not just be readers of the world but for God to give you a revelation you can be a doer of the word that they can live a life worthy of the Gospel we'd like to entitle this portion of the white horse riders yes and the pale horse riders and for a subject Perfection perfection and the minute you talk to people about Perfections he said no we'll never be perfect not only did he say we could he gave us reasons why we should because the adoption is the process spiritual adoption not not carnal adoption me and my wife were to adopt the child right now it'd be a little late in life for us for sure but we would be taking a child that wasn't a product of our Union the child of some other people and we bring him in to be part of our family that's adoption on the Earth are those who were in his mind before the foundation of the world as he told the Prophet Jeremiah process Cinco and we've spoken on it many times before but I can only follow as the Lord leads and sometimes he changes the thought yeah as I walk in the front room so Matthew chapter five Jesus speaking here Jesus if we can't believe Jesus who can we believe Matthew 5 48. Jesus says Jesus therefore perfect said even as your father which is in heaven which father the one in Revelations that father that father who had a message that father who it says in verse 5 of that same chapter that he became flesh and he loosed the seals open the Scrolls it was the New Testament because it was the grace of God and now Jesus is [Music] and the first thing people think just one problem brother Daniel we can't be perfect but what did Jesus say he said be ye therefore even as your father which is in heaven is perfect where he said biggie therefore you know why he started the sentence that way and finished to be perfect as the father which is in heaven is perfect think about this it's because of the other 47 verses prior to this one verse because that's how God writes his Bible when you come to a place in the scriptures and you read one verse and you say no that can't be you said he said it may be that you that you didn't understand the first 47 verses so how will you understand this statement this conclusion verse 48 conclusions you started in the first verse 47 verses that God wants you to understand so when you get to 48. you can say Lord if you want me to enter into Perfection now I understand the steps now I understand and verse 39. Hebrews 11 is called the chapter of Faith The Heroes of Faith is a fail and in verse 39 the closing statements on this chapter the Declaration the Apostle Paul speaking he says in all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promises like the Father in Heaven is perfect God having provided some better things for us because we're made perfectos as a body of Christ as a many-membered body is the Perfection is Hebrews chapter 6. Apostle Paul says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God it's a theme in the Bible that stretches forth throughout all the New Testaments the word Perfecto it means to make something complete is that means to bring something to an end it means to bring uh to an end like a goal that you might have a means to bring to a close or fulfillment is like the Prophecies of the [Music] tribulation Romans 5 3 says tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards this outworking of our patients it's seen in James but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire lacking nothing so then we realize in this new testament Covenant for us and how highly God has commended the Saints they were patient as Lambs lovingly Faithfully they serve God somebody wanted out of life just to serve their lord and how great was the reward so Perfection has a process and the Lord Jesus was the first yes to bring us a teaching of all of all the parts of every step that takes us to Perfection as I told you the process is called adoption of sons and daughters the process to arrive to adoption in the Bible in this new testament it's called the three steps Jesus preached it begins with being justified by faith it goes to being Sanctified by the spirit and being baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire this Holy Ghost and Fire baptism it's the beginning of a born-again experience after God has Sanctified your vessels he's poured out all the trash that that you built up in your life he's cleanse heart and mind Sanctified in Matthew chapter 3 and verse 11 verse John was at the River Jordan baptized me is and as many came to his baptism he dropped a revelation of this of this beginning this Foundation of an of a new covenant he said I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance it was the first coming of Christ John was a prophet Jesus said he was more than a prophet for he was a forerunner he was the Elijah Ministry that was going to introduce the Lamb of God he said I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I am whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire that was the baptism of the holy spirit it's the beginning of a born-again experience it's when you've repented of all your sins and you have a revelation of The Next Step that God wants you to take to be baptized in water it's a symbol under repentance that brings you to this baptism of fire that the holy spirit gives you John said I indeed baptize you with water but there cometh another one almighty God flesh in this Lord Jesus is it's different it's different from the gift of the Holy Spirit In the book of Acts in Libre chapter 2 and verse 38. so then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins the book the scroll that had been loosed and unfolded day by day more detail was being added and here in Acts 2 38 another detail had been added to the baptism now the baptism included a name to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized for one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remiss and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit how is the gift of the Holy Ghost how is it the same or how is it different it all works together turn with me to the book of Ephesians Ephesians chapter 2 . the Apostle Paul speaking here the book of Ephesians was written to the Ephesian Church they were a spiritual church they had they caught the Revelation in their days they were a mature Church a mature group of people [Music] they only started with 12 of them in the church now watch this and the Apostle Paul saying but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with Christ by grace and had raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God did you see it for by grace and that not of yourself the faith that you need for this journey is the gift of God and as you surrender to him daily and the trials and troubles you go through your faith increases day by day and Peter said next 2 38. you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit faith faith the faith of God the failures what The Heroes of Faith had from Abraham to everyone here in this room they had Faith by faith they overcome and their faith increased and God gave him strength the baptism of fire it's the beginning of a born-again experience then through every trial and struggle you go through you receive a refilling of that Holy Spirit the refillings are to help you overcome every strong temptation justified by by justification by faith crucification sanctification by the spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fires and these three bring us to a restored friendships it's called adoption Paul told us in the book of Hebrews Hebrews 18. he says for there is veriling of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness in other words The Ten Commandments there was a weak Link in them you know what it was the woman we are the weak Link in the Ten Commandments are they killing yet today thou shall not commit adultery are men and women being unfaithful in their relationships today are they stealing yet today so there's no strength in the Commandments because verse 19. for the law made nothing perfectly but the bringing in of a better hope did did you see it the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did what was that better hope is a new message of a life-changing experience for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw near unto God through the old Covenant of the Old Testament by the sacrifice of the Lamb of God foreign and through the love of God yes he draws us closer to himself so yes Paul here in Hebrews 7. as you can see was speaking of all Ten Commandments and Jesus in his Parable Jesus for he spoke everything in prayer Jesus in his Parable on adoption and Perfection imperfections also mentions them and tells us how they're being disannowed so here is the admonition of God when he was opening the book that Adam lost in Genesis and telling us things that had been hid since the foundation of the world for the first time since the father spoke to Adam and the things that he was teaching him in Eden once again God is speaking to us through Adam's Fallen race we have in our possessions that Adam once had yeah and this is what Adam heard that day in Eden just before the fall because the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday in Genesis today boy president [Music] these are not just New Testament admonitions this was in the mind of God before the foundation justification by faith brings peace it's when you know it's when you get a revelation that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and what he did on the cross he gave his life that he became your sins filthy movies if you can sit down and watch a vulgar movie with half-naked men and women I'm not even sure if you're justified by faith you sure haven't been Sanctified by the spirits it's Unholy yes it's vulgar yes it Grieves the Holy Spirit social media the baptism of the Holy Spirit restores a friendship and the refillings of the Holy Ghost increase our love and faith unto Perfection the refillings of his spirits is not a reward for being a good Persona no no the refillings of the Holy Spirit to overcome temptation Matthew 5 6 and 7. is Jesus teaching on Perfection the process to take us there is again I say is adoption Holy Spirit adoption justification by faith sanctification by the spirit of the baptism of the Holy Spirit restoring a friendship with the father like Adam had in Eden where the Bible says God would come down in the evening times and God would be a student and God would be his mentor and God was teaching him how to handle something the spoken word for the spoken word that was the original series brought forth every other scene you say what do you mean by that is what the spirit is saying Jesus as my Father which is in heaven is perfect the reason he said that in verse 48. because of the other 47 verses that we have read past for many years you see how the how the churches have taught us to read the words if you read past the 47 verses we don't understand them did you catch it look at that how we read the word we read 47 verses and the closing conclusions that Jesus was capping off his teaching with Jesus say we can't be perfect how can we be because of the first 47. that showed us so foreign perfection and seeing the multitudes we went up into a mountain and when it was said he said and he opened his mouth that means the spoken word he was about to do what he did in Genesis speak the word give the people the original seat it's a teaching the spoken word is a teacher can he opened his mouth and taught them saying the first step s for theirs is the kingdom you're a broken human being anybody like that in this room because if you are you're a candidate candidate for Perfection by the grace of God 46 more verses foreign we thank you all for coming tonight we will continue this Sunday our brother Jonathan will be ministering for you Myanmar and Karen will are
