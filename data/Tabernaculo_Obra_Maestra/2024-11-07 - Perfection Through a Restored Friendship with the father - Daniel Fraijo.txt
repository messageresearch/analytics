to do that with all of you just before we leave yeah the following week there up to to Minnesota um if you all stand with me tonight we'd like to read from the word of God and uh we'll begin reading in Matthew 13 Matthew 13 as a as a reminder how this gospel came to us how this Lamb's Book of Life came to us what was the style of Ministry of Jesus Christ why was it that way and how did God work it for our good Matthew 13 and verse 34 he says all these things spoke Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spoke he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world Messiah King of the Jews the Lamb of God the prophets of the Old Testament had prophesied of him since the Book of Genesis and in the Book of Psalms D David prophesied of of his style of Ministry of the Lord Jesus and he said that it might be fulfilled verse 35 which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables that means he was going to speak in a mystery that means it was going to be a prophetic word but hidden to the to the eyes of the wise and prudent so so that he could reserve for his children a re reation that he could say father I thank you that you're hidden my words the eyes of the wise and prudent will reveal it unto babes such as would learn and again he was speaking in a parable he didn't mean babes natural he mean babes Supernatural Sons and Daughters those that could be born again to them he would reveal it he says and I will utter things everything that will come out of my mouth I will utter things which have been set secret from the foundation of the world I will utter things that at one time only only the ears of Adam have ever heard and I'll say it again to you now my word will not return void men and women that can live it that can speak it that will believe it that will hold to it Matthew 28 now we know that everything that Jesus said in his Earthly Ministry in his Earth Ministry was a parable in other words it was a prophetic word and the words he was using were not literal they were symbolic of something that he was hiding from everyone except you you he wanted you to know it but not through education through Revelation Matthew 28 verse 18 as you remember this chapter starts off there at the end of the Sabbath day and Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to the Seiler magd and while they're there there's a great earthquake and the earthquake was that the angel of the Lord had descended down and he rolled back the stone and there was a resurrection that took place Jesus rose that moment that and he said to the women fear not it is I so the angel told told him he is risen and tonight I can tell you he is risen beginning at Verse 18 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth all power so he says so go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing in the name baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost Jesus said it do you believe it and will you follow it and yet it wasn't a parable and without a revelation you'll you'll stay with the symbols but you won't won grow you'll be baptized in titles but you won't be born again you won't go from poor in spirit unto Perfection you may start the journey absolutely but without a revelation you might be justified by faith you might even be Sanctified by the spirit but without Revelation you can't go further into a restored friendship with the father there's got to be a revelation of this book called The Bible or else this message movement will just be another denomination or else you and I will just become denominational minded without revelation will hold to the symbols but this but we won't know what they represent won't change our lives but the revealed word that changes our lives for the revealed word is a personal experience holy spirit amen verse 19 again go you therefore and teach All Nations baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost and without revelation we say I'd rather do what Jesus said than what Peter said a backslid fisherman who denied my Jesus three times without Revelation that's the thought verse 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I'm with you always even until the end of the world Amen and how did Jesus speak it what was his style of ministry thus saith the prophets of old he speak in Parables and in Parables he'll utter things that have been hidden since the foundation of the world he bring through to us things that he wanted Adam to to fulfill and Adam didn't the first Adam but the second Adam did because of what the second Adam did for us he was a man that could take God at his word now in Christ we can also take him at his word faith believing on the finished work on the price of the blood that he paid for us so Acts 2 acts 289 18 to 20 excuse me Matthew 28 verse 18 to 20 was once again Jesus speaking in a parable and the words that we all understand father son Holy Ghost were symbolic he hid it in the eyes of the wise and PR but in Acts 238 he raised up another Prophet an apostle the Apostle Peter beginning at verse 36 Acts 2 and 36 therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God had made that same Jesus whom ye crucified both Lord and Christ it's not acts right uh Acts 2:36 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do let's read 36 again remember it's the day of Pentecost 120 had descended from an upper room pour out into the streets of Jerusalem and they begin to speak in tongues tongues of fire were upon them and the Bible says that all that heard them heard them speaking in their native languages because there was people from all over the world there in Jerusalem spoke hundreds of different dialects it wasn't a day of confusion it was a day when everyone heard these men speaking in a tongue that they understood and they were shocked because it was their native dialect from far away lands where they had come it wasn't a time of confusion it wasn't just bring dragging someone to the front and shaking them to make him speak in tongues and then there's no message no no this was the power of God that fell down this was the a restoration of what the prophet Joel had spoken verse 36 therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God had made that same Jesus listen to this whom ye crucified Peter is speaking to a crowd of people that had gathered and in that crowd of people were men and women who that day before Pontius Pilate before that Jud judgement Hall tribunal they were screaming along with the high priest of Israel crucify him and Peter discerned the hearts that multitude of people there that's why when he said therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God had made that same Jesus and the word a discerner of the hearts whom ye crucified made him both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they knew they were guilty and they were pricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren you know we were part of that crowd you know we were part of that church that screamed to Pontius pilot that Roman Governor when he said who will I give you Jesus or Barabas and I and we screamed crucify Jesus and now the Holy Spirit has convicted them and they're saying what shall we do now did we go too far is it too late what will we do now then Peter said unto them it's too late for your kind no he didn't say that and yet they were they had screamed crucified one time but in that crowd that screamed crucified he knew there were Sons and Daughters of God that had gotten caught up with that system with that denomination with w w with with that nian spirit and Peter said to the Sons and Daughters of God who were poor in spirit he said repent what you've done wrong what you've said wrong the the the the the wrong way you've treated people just repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again again add your blessings to your word in Jesus name amen you may be seated we left off in the last service and I think the last statement we made from the book of Acts acts 238 repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you will see the hand of God working in your life every step of the way as long as you give him full control but anytime you turn away from God's word then your life and mine will go out of control you walk out from the protection of the Holy Spirit his word you you no longer give almighty God for [Music] control then your life will spin out of control there Comes A Time in this character building process and at any time we can walk away from it grieve the Holy Spirit but then there Comes A Time in this character building process the hunger and thirst for righteousness meekness to be a peacemaker to be pure of heart to be merciful for this is the attitude of men and women young and old if they have begun this character building process unto Perfection those that are looking to be changed the holy spirit is impressing upon their hearts we seek conso we seek prayer we don't hide our iniquity but we put it before God as the scripture says be not as Adam who hid his iniquity Matthew 53 and remember Matthew 5 what was Jesus teaching on how to go from a person Bor in spirit a person born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies all the way to perfection even as the father which is in heaven is perfect Matthew 5 was Jesus speaking on Perfection how to get there the Little Steps we're going to take where we all started and where he wants to take each and every one of us back into his presence in verse 13 of Matthew 5 he says you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its Savor if you pull away from God if you if you walk away from his presence if you stop reading your Bible if you stop praying you've lost your savior you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its Savor wherefore shall it be salted in other words if you walk away from God how can you walk with him anymore he says it is therefore then good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trotten under foot of man how do we lose our Savor once we started this walk we repented we were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ now you're the salt of the earth but what if you lose your savior what takes place when you you grieve the Holy Spirit though you've been baptized though you used to go to church Gans 5:19 these are the things it says now the works of the flesh are manifest when you grieve the Holy Spirit are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies envies murders both natural and spiritual drunkenness rings and such like of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God Matthew 5:14 Jesus speaking of how to go from porn spirit all the way to be perfect as Our Father which is in heaven is perfect ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid ye are the light of the world it's a great thing what a calling to be called to be a light of the world verse 15 he says neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel this is a small light but it's a light neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it give it light light unto all that are in the house that's the that's that's the children in the home that's the sons in the home that's the daughter in the home that's in our home is we're where Jesus speaking on Perfection is asking you be a light first be a light in your home before you try to be a light all over the world first have a testimony that your life is a light onto your house verse 15 verse 16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works the light here has a manifestation of good works and yet we don't live by works but our works are just an expression of what God is doing in our lives let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven Jesus is telling us this Christian walk is out is about being Epistles read of all men if you believe your light is shining bright and no one sees your good works at home at work at church then who you think you are does not have the same outward expression and you must ask yourself have I really been born again have I got that Holy Ghost that urges me to do good and to do good starting first in my home starting first with my family starting first with my wife Star first with my husband the manifested light shows and it brings good works Matthew 5:17 Jesus says think not that I am come to destroy the law of the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill for that was a shadow of things to come and and when prophecy is full fulfilled it becomes history and the Mana of a day pasted and man so what do we do now with the Old Testament fulfilled and passed we go on to Perfection through a restored friendship under a new covenant not under the blood of bulls and goats but under the blood of a better Covenant the blood of the Lamb of God oh what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can take away the iniquity nothing but the blood of Jesus and when we are washed then Begins the friendship with the father then we then when we confess our shortcomings not when we say I know I make mistakes but Jonathan's worse than me did you catch that the spirit's flowing here yes no that's not repenting that's not being washed you haven't begun a friendship with the father yet then Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as as Our Father which is in heaven is perfect and when you approach anybody on the topic of perfection they might smile but then they say we can't be perfect we can't be perfect Jesus used the word perfect it was part of the parable it's how he it's how he hid in the eyes of the wise and prudent where he really wanted to take us the Perfection that he was speaking of was to be eternal as he is eternal that's where he wants to take us back Perfection is our Capstone of a character building process that begins with you and I at the at the very lowest time in your life you remember that day when you were lost in sin perhaps lost in religion that day Jesus looked down from heaven saw you and he said blessed is that young man that girl though she's poor in spirit because I see an attribute there I see a daughter the woman at the well a prostitute Jesus saw something in her he saw a daughter he said I have a need to go to Samaria he sent his Apostles to go on go down and get us something to eat he was a Jew and he entered amongst the Samaritans the Jews had nothing to do with Samaritans but the father has everything to do with his children a father will never abandon his children he didn't abandon me he didn't abandon you oh love of God so rich and pure maybe may we be that kind of fathers that kind of mothers that kind of sons and daughters Matthew 5:18 for verely I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one jot or one t shall on no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled and when was it fulfilled turn with me to St John chapter 19 beginning at verse 28 John an eyewitness of the life of Jesus he says after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be f filled saith I thirst even the phrase I thirst had to be said on the cross of Calvary for it was thus sayth the Lord now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon his up and put it to his mouth now when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it's finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost God needed a man that would take him at his word the first Adam couldn't do it but the second Adam did and here he was on the cross of Calvary and he said it's finished the work of redemption the price has been paid oh Rejoice church for the price of your salvation the price of your deliverance the price for the joy of your salvation the price has been paid in Matthew 19 now he's speaking to the ministry and he says whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven he was talking to the teachers he was talking to the ministers let's read it again whosoever therefore shall break one of these these Commandments it's one thing to break a commandment another level to teach people to break his Commandments he's talking to the teachers now who will pay the greater Price He says and and those that teach men so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven Matthew 5 and verse 20 now he's speaking to the lay member in verse 20 he says for I say unto you ex that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of Heaven because their righteousness was self righteous but the righteousness that exceeds this is you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior he became your sin so that you and I can be a partaker his righteousness for I say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of God and now the Lord Jesus he took the your discipleship to a Next Level other words don't just discuss it but be the light of the world let your light shine brother Daniel do you mean obey all Ten Commandments I mean more than that the Bride of Jesus Christ is called to go beyond thou sht not kill the bride of Jesus Christ is called to go beyond th shall not commit adultery it's greater today now here's Paul speaking on Perfection adding more detail to Perfection through a restored friendship Hebrews chapter 7 and verse 18 the Apostle Paul speaking to the Hebrews men who were well studied in the law men who held the Ten Commandments in high esteem he says here in verse 18 of Hebrews 7 for there is for there is verely a disannulling in other words a cancelling of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof in other words Ten Commandments would be cancelled because we're born in sin we're shaped in iniquity that's the weak link that keeps us from living Ten Commandments it's we're the weakling we're the weak Ling that's why we must be born again but brother Daniel what's wrong with Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not commit adulter should not cover thy neighbor's house and home verse 19 for the law made nothing perfect for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God when there is a dis ing of the law in your life then your tutorship begins your discipleship just went to the next level in Christ when you get to this level you've come a long way from blessed are the porn spirits blessed are they that mourn watch now here is a higher level of Christianity of Holiness no legal no legalism instead Perfection through a restored friendship with the father that's where we want to live like Abraham who was called to a friend of God not even a servant not even a high priest a friend Matthew 5 and verse 21 ye have heard that it was said by them of old time did you hear the way he said Jes this is remember this is Jesus speaking and he's speaking in a parable so it symbols the word he using it's a Myster he unfolding to us have heard that was said by them of old time I thought I thought Ten Commandments was thus sayith the Lord but the Daniel no it was a proverb that would be enough that would be disan will be canell for a better hope ye have heard that it was said by them of old time like Moses and the Levites Thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the Judgment God gave men of old time a proverb that they could repeat to others but them of old time added to the proverb what they felt was was just a justifiable reason to kill under the law the Commandment was given thou sh not kill but Israel and Men of old they said I believe that but but if that man steals my cow the only way I can stop him is to kill him so that kind of killing that's different that's a different kind of killing that's okay but the original proverb and commandment was Thou shalt not kill it had a period so no one could keep it no one could fulfill it what do we do God gave men of old this proverb and they repeated it to themselves and others but those of old time added to all of these Ten Commandments what they felt was a good reason to kill what they felt was a good reason to divorce their wies making the Commandment of no effect and thus the Jews the Jewish book called the Torah expanded and and expanded and added and added Dogma after Dogma until when Jesus arrived on the scene and they had turned the house of God into a den of Thieves and completely blinded and it was the blind leading the blind when Jesus arrived that was a condition of the church what else was the condition of the church Jesus said how often as a hen gathers her brood I've tried to gather you he said something with that statement he said now that I'm here with you you've turned this house of God into another chicken yard you realize God compared himself to a h Jehovah H and he made that comparison because of the condition of the hearts of the people the ministry the leaders the preachers pastor the prophets and apostles where they had fallen to Matthew 157 Jesus speaking on Perfection how do we arrive he said ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of you saying this people people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me every Revival that God's ever brought it's come to this place and to this point but yet in the midst of this falling away in the midst of this falling away in there is a Remnant there is a mystical body of Jesus Christ this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men these statements were written over over 2200 years ago and they perfect identifying the day we're living [Music] today verse 10 and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defile a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying don't you know that the way you preach is offending ministers Apostles prophets teachers evangelist don't you know it's offensive the way you're saying and preaching but he answered and said he didn't respond to what they said carnally but supernaturally and spiritually when they told him don't you know that the Pharisees are offended that the teachers of Israel are offended the high priests and Levites are offended verse 13 but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father had not planted shall be uprooted if they're not mine if they're not wheat they're tears it's going to happen he he's told us I'm only interested in the wheat in the bride in a little Remnant in a mistical body of Believers and the people who want to repent and be baptized with the Holy Ghost in fire with the people who want refilling and refilling of that Holy Ghost for the refilling is not a reward for being good the refilling is power to overcome the every Temptation that comes upon you Perfection through a restored friendship with the Father Joseph would come brother Kenny Joseph Kenny you know that song At The Cross at the cross pleas just play that for us Psalms 51 as we stand to our [Music] feet David a man seeing his errors man who had hid his iniquities and yet a son of God [Music] when the Holy Spirit when the word came to him and spoke to him of a great error and of how and how wicked men would act and the prophet said David what would you do with this kind of a man who would take one little lamb from a man when he had hundreds David said and as I mentioned I don't doubt when he said it he put his hand on his sword he said that man is worthy of death he should have never done that how dare him be so abusive and the prophet looked him in the face and he said David you're that man and it struck him revelation of his [Music] iniquity and he repented he saw the weed thing he done and he said wash me from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin oh Lord I need to be born again or I'll keep repeating the same terrible life and tonight I tell what David asked for he couldn't get it but tonight you ask for be born again if you ask for the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say by his grace I have that brother Daniel then ask for a refilling tonight David said behold I was shapen in iniquity verse five and in sin did my mother conceived me in other words Lord I was born poor in spirit what can I do you can be born again you can be born [Music] again in verse S he said Purge me with is and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow tonight the washing of the water of the word through the sacrifice of the blood of Jesus washes each and every one of us and then he said make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May [Music] Rejoice he was speaking in a parable for this for he was speaking as Christ and what he would suffer in the cross of Calvary in vers 9 hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities do you realize tonight this is possible no matter where you what you've done where you've gone failed he pours that into the into the sea of his forgetfulness then he said in verse 10 create in me a clean heart we you a right Spirit within I want you to go home with this verse in Your Heart Lord Jesus create in me a clean heart and renew a right Spirit within me will you do [Music] it La Cru in La Cru at the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart roll away it was there myi I
