rest in our bodies healing for our bodies and and a family you're not familiar a family that loves God and a place where we can apply the token in our homes and and place our own homes in order an order that God's pleased with because we don't come here just to see this place put in order but it's just uh it should be just a small example of the same order that should follow into our own homes [Music] because your house is the house of God it's like I said your house is a house of prayers when Jesus came and you saw the Great temple in Jerusalem that Herod that a great ruler there had built and he looked at it saw they were selling sheep and doves and he said you've turned my house a house of prayers but there was to be a great change that was coming because the house of God would no longer be a building but the house of God would be the children of God you are the Temple of the Holy Spirit the body that God prepares that man called Jesus was really God Jesus never came Jesus to to glorify the synagogue that was built in that day he went and he looked at it and he said they told them this this this Temple was 40 years in the building and he's looking at the synagogue and as he's looking at the synagogue he said destroy this Temple and in three days yes they said didn't you hear me just took 40 years this took hundreds and hundreds of men hombres you said yes because see but didn't you hear me and in three days so when we read this glorious Bible we've got to get into the mind of God and once you see how God speaks then you can take scriptures there's no longer fight in our minds but God Can Open the Eyes of our understandings and scriptures now come together wow what a book that only a God the author because no one else writes a book like he writes for his book is a Book of Life all other books will eventually bring but none of those books as much as we could like to learn from them none of them are books of life there's just one that's the word of God is the only Book of Life I want to also ask you all to remember in prayer my uncle and my aunt Zeke and Jesse Zeke and Jesse some of you met them on a Sunday morning last Sunday he had a stroke and um it was very serious he was in the hospital and it was yesterday morning that the doctor said that the bleeding in the brain was more severe now and that there was nothing more they could do this last night they moved him to a hospice they feel it's just a matter of time hours days and Lord will take them home but he loved the Lord Jesus as to all that he knew and understand he gave his life to God so a Believer doesn't die a Believer changes dimensions [Music] and we won't see them as the old people that they were you know five hours to die tomorrow God give me a new body none of you would recognize me I'd be young again Karen might remember maybe but God is give us a promise and that is when this terrestrial body be dissolved yes he has another one waiting for him so if you remember the family in prayers they were married for 50 some years so um she'll certainly be missing him of course right now she's surrounded by family that support her but as you know when the family's all gone everyone's living the life their lives busy in the daily things then when then uh sometimes as as we as as we find ourselves alone at home then that's when the battle begins that's when folks really began missing their loved ones that's when we need to reach out by faith one day I'll see him again one day very soon very soon as we see this world falling apart then we know one day we'll see all our loved ones very soon as we turn in our Bibles here tonight we're speaking on a white horse rider and the pale horse riders in the Days of Elijah one speaks of the and today it's a very controversial subject even to believe that God sent a prophet it's very controversial but many of you testified and yeah they ask you what you believe because I believe God sent a prophet I believe it's a fulfillment of the scriptures and the minute they hear the word Prophet they've already turned you off and yet it's the truth and yet when you say it when you say it you're planting of seeds maybe somewhere down the road someone else will tell them maybe in that heart really is the seed of God foreign and the Fig Tree rejected what God had been teaching Adam that was the book that was opened that was the Lamb's Book of Life and as we spoke the other day about about a person person about my grandchildren why they begin with the day they're born I began speaking of a baby because this was the baby's book because this was a lamb you know a lamb is is a young sheep considered two years and younger concertos that's what a lamb is yes but it's a lamb because it's a yam sheep so this book the Lamb's Book of Life very birth of Christ the lamb himself we read through the scriptures in Isaiah 40. and they say yes Luke chapter one Lucas all of these scriptures are speaking of the ministry of John the Baptist who was to introduce and these were not all compiled to confuse you know foreign he would send Elijah to to open that first coming and because God is the same yesterday then it gives us it gives us some insights that that just as the first coming was introduced by Elijah foreign and we found that each one had a certain ingredient to it and that was each one contained a great change is what John was bringing to Israel yes by the grace of God foreign because Israel didn't know the name of God Israel didn't even pronounce the name is even to try to pronounce it was considered blasphemy but that was the old Covenant Uno okay Malachi 3 and verse one behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple yeah even the messenger of the Covenant whom you Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts not just comparing scripture with scripture your Holy Spirit going from Heart to Heart opening the eyes in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated behold I will send my messenger he'll begin with a foundational truth to this new testament to this to this new Plan of Redemption and that is repent and be baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ John said of Christ I hear I baptize you with water but there comes one after me who will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire he said I'll send my messenger he said he'll make the way before me and the Lord whom you seek because it was it it was Israel who always sought the Lord Jehovah foreign he said the and the Lord whom ye seek almighty God creator of heavens and earth shall certainly come to his Temple they thought it was literal they thought it would be a the temple that Herod made they thought it would be a great a great Cathedral temple in the wilderness no but it was spoken it was spoken in a mystery it was spoken in a metaphor it was spoken even here in a prophetic Parable so Jesus speaking in Parables it wasn't the wasn't the first time God creator of heavens and earth since the Book of Genesis Jesus in the beginning when he said let there be lies was speaking of a Time El Mundo here Malachi is speaking he says and he shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant now it's taken the Lord and the messenger of the covenants and as declaring their one and the same yesterday but he said when the Lord descends changing forms he took on the form as the messenger of the cup he took on the form of that strong angel and from that and from that and from that position when he was looking for a man who was worthy foreign and verse 19. Jesus was standing before the before a Congregation of people Jesus the Passover was at hand in Jerusalem and he went into the temple the internal Temple and he found them he was in control selling oxen selling dogs men who were there exchange of money and then Jesus made of whip it says Jesus and the sheep and The Oxen broke open their carried their their cages Cut the Ropes and held them ties he let the animals loose and chase them out took the money's Changers the tables and he threw them on the ground and then that sold doves Palomas well you would think any man who sold the dub was probably a pretty nice fella Pennsylvania disciples saw him turn into synagogue upside down they remembered because the Holy Spirit brought it to their memories seeing that thou doest these things tell us why you did this tell us what gives you a right to turn our church upside down and Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple destroy is the temple and in three days that'll be your sign of course they didn't understand it people read the Bible today how much more there in the day that that it happened when they were looking at the man with a whip in his hand then said the Jews 40 and six years was this temple in the building and well that will thou rear it up in three days foreign but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth before he's like a Refiner's Fire and like Fuller soap so he's coming in his Temple to bring a cleansing to bring up pureness to bring Holiness back to his church and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness the sons of Levi were the ministry the first thing he would do I'm going to clean up the ministry I'm going to clean up the minutes they're not going to live the way they used to learn they're going to be an example to the people that's the new ministry of a New Testaments the ministry he was speaking of for today oh he's bringing a change to the ministers the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost before before you ever get in the Pulpit before you ever stand before God's people the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord as in the days of old as in former years and it will come near to you to judgment and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers against the adulterers against the false swearers against those that oppress the hireling and his wages the Widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and fear not me saith the Lord is looking back at the condition of the priests looking back three four thousand years and he's speaking out against him and he's speaking out about the condition they had come to yeah and he calls them Sorcerers adulterers that was the ministry that's what it had come to you guys and that's what God had come to change because if you change the ministry you can change the church if you take the adulterers out of the pulpitas then you can preach marriage and divorce God wants us to live God yours was changing the ministry so we could bring the changes to God's people it was the second part of this new ministry of no more under the law we read in Luke chapter one Lucas Begin Again verse 13. it's the story of Zechariah and Elizabeth they were great they were great in age performing the duties of a priest in the burning of incense they're clearing that behind the curtain something takes place verse 13 of Luke 1. the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and the wife Elizabeth shall bear their son and El shall call his name John Cena we'd later found out that this John Was Elijah not the literal Elijah but he was coming in the spirit and power of Elijah verse 14 and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth where he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink foreign the angel Gabriel Gabriel is reinforcing what the prophet Malachi said he's purifying the sons of leaves it's going to change the ministry first so he can change God's people and it shall be filled with the Holy ghosts the ministry must be changed first stand before God's people must be changed first they must be born again they must have the Holy ghosts they must experience refillings see the order of the new ministry so they can take the head of every home into the same meaning for too long in this message foreign and they work 60 80 hours a week don't read their Bible till they come to church and then they only read the scriptures that the pastor reads if the pastor's even reading the words because they're falling into the same as the pastors that lead themes wants to bring change to each and every one of us and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children it's here that Gabriel stands in the seventh dimension in the presence of God it's here where he connects John is that he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children he doesn't read the other hand and then he says obedient the wisdom of the Justice Angel Gabriel was quoting the spoken word of God that Israel knew as the writings of the Prophet Malachi Israel then he says this Mighty Angel he then had ears to hear let him here that had never been said that way and when you read the seven churches there in Revelations every age ends with that declaration because a New Covenant was being ushered this was this this was the the words of a new book called the Lamb's Book of Life declaring the birth of them [Music] basically he says Matthew 11 16. but we're unto shall I like in this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling them to their fellas [Music] listen close now is unto you and you have not dancedocamos flautas we have more than to you and you have not lamented us for John came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath the devil the son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a gluttonous man and a wine River the same ones that accused John um the same ones that shouted out to him saying we've piped until you have not danced this is where John came neither eating or drinking is he says but wisdom is Justified of her children is at the end of these Jewish ages Forerunner videos John the Baptist came on the scene it was the beginning of the ride of the white horse in other words the first seals what is the first seal yes I've always told you before it's part one is so at the end of these Jewish ages it was going to be ushering Gentile churches it was here where the promise of a new ministry had risen up ministry who would forerun the coming of Christ we share the scriptures of John the Baptist this Forerunner who would introduce the Lamb of God but in Isaiah 7 and 4. then Isaiah is is here introducing this lamb and it starts verse Isaiah 7 and 14. therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel yeah the Jewish people knew what Emmanuel meant it meant God With Us it meant that this child would be God this would be Jehovah they weren't thinking two Gods thinking three three persons of the tree no they were seeing God changing forms to get closer to them but they didn't know how he would get closer John was going to tell them how Juan John gonna tell them Isaiah 14. therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold of Isaiah 7 14 Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and call his name Emmanuel he says butter and honey shall he eat that he may know how to refuse the evil and choose the goods did you see it love you it's how to raise your children you know our sons are daughters sometimes they got to go out in the world so they can appreciate God later you know what that is that's allowing them to do what he did the tree of knowledge it's destruction that will fill our hearts in mind is aiah 7. was a child being born Isaiah 9 6 the child is born to us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace foreign of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform as the angel of the Covenant looking for a man who was Worthy a child was born that you would be the Lamb of God both of these scriptures we're speaking of Jesus Christ and yet his name was never mentioned you know you share with his with people today God sent a prophet let's say where does it say his name there is aiah 7 Isaiah 9. where does it call this baby Jesus you'll never find the name of Jesus in there it took a revelation and if you lived in the days of this little married and she said an angel appeared to me and said this would be the son of God that this is Emmanuel and you know what his name is Jesus and in that day people will tell her where is that written in the Old Testament God's name is they were offended foreign [Music] he's the author he's the finisher of our faith he's the only one that can open them it's his book and when it speaks it just doesn't mean this it means a revelation you don't understand showing you your name and people can say can you think your name's in here I know it's in there show it to me no no you'll never see it it's just for me yes and it says who have believed our report and two and to whom is the arm of the Lord reveals watch Isaiah 40. speaking of the forerunners remember in verse 5. and it said and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and in Isaiah 53 and to whom is the arm of the Lord reveals for speaking of the same time a time of revealing Revelation a time of change a time of when God would be the would be the Lamb of God and Revelations is the same time it's the time of the book by Jesus Christ the Lamb of God now scriptures Revelations all of this is the same time all these scriptures come together oh go back and read it Roberto Isaiah 53 and verse 2. he's a 12 year old boy now for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and there's a root out of dry ground he has no form no comliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire here he looked like you're common every day 12 year old Jewish boys brown skin Morena we're in the same kind of clothing 12 year old boys and yet that was God in that boy you can be a 12 year old boy today and once again Los Angeles though thou be little amongst the thousands of Judah dejuda get out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel que sera senior in Israel whose going forth have been from from of old from Everlasting is another detail um about this child that would be born through a virgin about this child that would grow up now he adds and tells us where this child will be born [Music] because this Lamb of God and he would now be the king of Judah said he would now be the king of the Kings but the scripture the lion of the tribe of Jews the scriptures are coming together the way God wrote his Bible he says you bring the prophecies together they add more details but without Revelations even the things that William Branham they don't fit together not without Revelations without Revelation Revelation it looks like he's saying two different things without Revelations the Old Testament prophecies they don't seem to merge together God begins to Open the Eyes and his father Zachariah was filled with the Holy Ghost this was long before the day of Pentecost this was years before the day of Pentacles God had introduced a New Covenant and God was bringing change in the lives God was bringing them and they were they were receiving this Holy Spirit and his father Zechariah blessed be the Lord God of Israel he has visited and redeemed his people the time of revealing was the time of the opening of the book it's also the time of redemption and hath raised up an Horn of salvation for us in the house of his servantages as he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets which have been since the world began it's a divinely revealed mystery truth God ordained the prophetic Ministries that's that's where God is brought forth the prophetic Ministry in Luke 1 71 he did it for a purpose that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that haters to our fathers [Music] and to bring and to bring remembrance of his holy cows who is a man who lived by faith not under the law and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in the city and the Lord has not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing his servants is secret unto his servants the promise and then the prophets are to give it to the people now the people know the secrets they don't know the prophet secrets it's called Revelations verse 8 Mercy College the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God had spoken who can but prophesy when did the lion roar Jesus Jesus roared out to Israel to Israel Israel and the Bible says he loosed the Seven Seals that's what Israel rejected and when they reject that's what was given to us so that's what was given to a Gentiles on the day of Pentacles people who walked away from the law um that's what was given to them the open book it was the Lamb's books are you ready [Music] who is he that is Emmanuel King of the Jews The Greatest Secret ever revealed from the mind of God foreign [Music] tonight as we stay that's me so yo the opening of this book the first coming of Christ there was a time of revealing revelation it was a time of redemption it was the time of the opening of the Lamb's Book of Life with us being told and to us a child was born and in that book yeah it's your birth also Redemption and that book is your promise it's written in that book but if you can ever reach in and take it to your business B1 at the end of these Jewish ages a promise of a new ministry to introduce it and foreign Amos 3 6 and 7. a prophet must introduce because it's the time of the restoration of the Fig Tree so then what will his second coming in and we're living in them yes he's come and we need them Luke 167. and his father Zachariah was filmed with the Holy Ghost yeah what is this Holy Ghost feeling it's a personal experience and when you receive it you'll never be the same again you've been changed those are the refills and delivers you angels in Camp about you you are loose from all that vexes when the stress is all gone you say wow wow I didn't think I was going to make it for them you know what it was it was a refilling of the Holy Spirit you just pour it in a little more songwriter said yes Isaiah Luke 167. and his father Zachariah was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel has visited and redeemed his people and raised up an Horn of Salvation as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophet which have been since and the prophets came for a reason from Genesis the Genesis 21st century that he would grant them to us verse 74. that we would that we've been delivered that he would Grant unto us that we've been delivered out of the hands of our enemies might serve him without fear properties in Holiness and righteousness before him all the days you will still bring back Holiness to bring back righteousness he will be a man that could enter into a house [Music] this how this house is a house change is not easy but change is needed John was the prophet prophet Elijah Elias the Forerunner The only voice of God at that time ushering in a new age a New Testament no Testament if you rejected John you probably rejected Jesus when you reject the prophetic Ministry you reject all the benefits that it's designed to give questions John was the beginning of a new ministry no longer after the law and the prophets but the order of a new ministry was to present the way of perfection as Jesus said in Matthew 5 48. as Jesus said in Matthew 5. even as my father a prophet said if Jesus said it requires it in your life he must make a way for you to get there because Perfection as God wants it for us is different than what people think perfectionism then where do we go back to the world or Bible questions Hebrews 7 11 everyone if therefore Perfection or by the levitical pries what further need was there that another priest should rise up after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Errors for the priesthood he was coming first to change the priesthood people would have no hope nine prophets that dragged Israel down into his presence for the priesthood there is made a necessity a change also for three of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance in other words Jesus nowhere was it written that man of the tribe of Judah would give attendance at the altars as priests immaculous and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek there arises another priests who was made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life this is Verse 18 for there is verily a distance of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness for the law made nothing perfect well it's not a Perfection only but the bringing in of a better hope that's Christ this is Crystal that's this is by which we draw now man could never get close to God Alone he could never draw close to God but the revealed word the preaching Perfection it was a change in Ministry Luke 16 and 16. look as he says we read it and we'll read it once again on the prophets were until John and then people say you see no more profit professor who would continue now the law and the prophets the kingdom of God so the prophetic Ministry of prophetica wasn't being done away but the prophetic Ministry was being changed they had a new message now the grace of God ushering in a new kingdom Australian life John was a prophetic ministry under the order of melchized a priesthood that spoke Perfection and a relationship restored universe foreign and the love that was being expressed to him and the things that the father was teaching us then that's what the prophetic Ministry has come again but the things Jesus spoke things that have been hid since the foundation of the world but you've got to go read it and when you find it feel like you have found a pearl of great prices and you'll pay any price has to be paid to hold it so keep it in your house to keep it in your thoughts it's the price it's a pleasure of a dedicated life John what a prophetic Ministry a priesthood that spoke Perfection a relationship restored like it wasn't even tutorship begins Fellowship begins you're a son and a daughter what does that mean in a single word perfect and the first thing people say you don't understand but remember Matthew 5 48. was a closing statement that Jesus was preaching and had preached some Perfection yeah because for 47 verses you've been telling you how to get there and if it's and if you go back and read those 47 verses you say this is too simple I'll say it's Garden simply see that revealing himself but Jesus said your Perfection begins like this foreign start letting go a very complex say Jesus I can't deal with this Jesus you you wash me like a Refiner's fireworks from this first two verses so if you've read 48.48 no I can't do it it's simple yeah simply go back start at verse one again because those are the little steps thank you you're a son and daughter in the process of adoption god is perfect a prophet of God was thrown off a ship one time because he was headed the wrong direction himself going in the wrong direction but he wasn't the first Adam was the first to be thrown out of a ship you see Adam lost his Fellowship Adam lost his tutorship Adam lost his mentorship Adam was tossed off The Old Ship of Zion but what we're promised today is Stadium brother Brandon an old preacher once asked brother Branham um you know what Fellowship is and he was a he was a man who preached the gospel all his life goes well I think so I think so brother yeah for sure there's two fellows Muchachos he said and one you know if you if you did it right who would like to be there change there is made a necessity a change also of the laws what was the change of this new priesthood Prophets pastors teachers maestros evangelists and they must have the Holy Ghost they must be born again or they don't qualify to be part of this is perfection Perfection the born-again experience because they can't place before you what they've never experiences and their teachers and some say their prophets and is placed the promises sorry too much place the promises at the reach of the people we must Place Madison and Holiness at the reach of our sons we must Place Fidelity we must Place forgiveness who have been torn by sins no Creed but Christ and that's an open book yes since the opening of The Seven series has become a new book and he'd been preaching from it for 30 years and after 30 years he said the Bible they're going to preach Christ long after John had been beheaded foreign long after John is dead Jesus Jesus confirms but not under the law prophets that will preach the Kingdom of Heaven prophets like Peter Prophet is and apostles that worked with Paul while he was in prison there was many prophets you know what they
