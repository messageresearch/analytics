amen i m am [Music] glor [Music] let Mo the [Music] amen amen in a happy world we will reign with our Lord I would like to make a few announce announcement before saying the word firstly this Sunday we will have our missionary offering so your offerings on this Sunday there are a few envelopes in the back and you can mark them as missionary offerings and some brothers that have been with us now they know we have picked up those missionary offerings and we send them to the brothers in Mex in Mexico so Widow sister some old couples to help them and be an assist brothers that don't have any other resources or helps of any other family so we have a contact over there with the brother there Ina that he makes a missionary work there in yukatan and it's been a blessing for many already Widow sisters old couples brothers that went to the emergency room in the hospital help for brothers to finish the churches that they were edifying and even if we are small people here this small thing that we are able to do God will bless us greatly so this this this Sunday the missionary offering if you can write it down on the envelope and Mark it in in a way the missionary offer and we should know what it's signal for so that you you can all also be praying uh in in January we would like to have some services and invited a brother from New Mexico Albert from Albuquerque and also our brother Roberto to have a few services like between the middle or towards the end of January a Friday Saturday and and finishing a Sunday with the Holy supper participating of the Holy supper and the washing of the feet the the last promises that Jesus left the last rituals the last rituals that Jesus left for us to do and he placed in the word to be blessed in His holy name and to participate of this communion and the washing of the feet just those things and to keep them as something that's sacred something that is very sacred like just like the communion like the baptism like the cleansing of theet because the significance it is great for our lives the symbolism what it speaks to us it is great and most of the time a week or two before we preach over that subject to prepare our prayers to be participants of the word of God this is what the Lord Jesus left us this Friday the ones that can and would like to come we have a Bible study at 7 and the ones that could come may God bless you may you stand on your feet to read the word of God we were speaking over that subject before the brother Roberto came and we made the services and we would like to continue on that once again I'm going to begin in the beginning just like how some some time passed to bring it once again to our memory and the title Perfection through the a restored friendship with the father and the subject the process of adoption and Perfection the the crownstone Psalms 51 beginning with the first verse to verse 10 and it reads this wave this Psalm how you may know it was the time when Nathan came to David and Nathan came to David and told him he told him a parable a story of a rich man but even so he went to a poor man and he was going to throw a big feast and instead of getting his own sheep because he had lot instead of getting a goat or a lamb of his own flock he went he took a lamb of a man that only had one and he asked David what do you say oh King with all of your wisdom what is the man deserve that does such thing right away David Rose up and I believe he put his hand on his shoulder that man deserves death I'm sure that he he might have thought oh bring him to me I want to kill myself and Nathan with the prophetic eyes he said he said David you are that man and from there these words when he noticed right now the Holy Spirit it it moves us right away David did not yet have this new birth he reacted after many days many weeks months and a prophet had to come to him and Shak but you know now we have something greater we have a new birth of the holy spirit that marks you and it tells you to stop the thought just comes and it tells you it tells your hearts you know if you let let that thought out of what you're worthy of the man that is born again with the Holy Spirit he says forgive me Lord cast out that thought but David didn't have that but you and I do have this is available for us in this day Psalms 51 verse one have mercy upon me oh God according to thy love kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my [Music] transgressions Wash Me thoroughly wash me thly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shaped in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive [Music] me behold thou Desir is truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to the wisdom Purge me with h up and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou Hast broken May rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all of my iniquities create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me without knowing it D he was asking from the Lord for a new birth because only through a new birth this petition that could bring forth these attributes can be can be able to be made it's not possible it wasn't possible to live in that day but now in this night it is more than possible to receive it to live a life worthy of the Gospel let's pray Heavenly Father we give you thanks once again father bless your word just how you know how to do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Perfection for a friendship restored to the father in Matthew 548 how we how we spoke in the in this past service Jesus says [Music] this and it says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfectus it was a conclusion a statement to what he was speaking here a conclusion it is the last word that a person says after speaking for a certain amount of time the Lord Jesus he had spoken for 47 and here he revealed he was speaking on Perfection it says be ye therefore perfect be for us 47 verses in which through a parable I have hidden this mystery of how to come to the perfection in Hebrews chapter 6 Hebrews chapter 6 verse one therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of the faith toward God the word perfect or perfect it means to complete something to finish something to bring something forth to add to what is missing in order to surren to give up or something complete it brings to an end a Finish Line goal a goal to bring a closing a fulfillment of of an event like the Prophecies of the scriptures like when Jesus naare reading there in the synagogues in Nazareth of the prophet Isaiah and when he finished the priest had extended him the scroll of Isaiah he stood up and read a certain portion and he said this day this scripture filled before our eyes fulfilled before our eyes that was the perfection those were the the the pleasing words the precious words to be able to say to read the scripture and say today in this day it is fulfilled beautiful those are precious words that help us identify message and messenger in our day James says chapter 1 vers four but let patience have her perfect work and ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so the Perfection is a process and the Lord Jesus was the first one to bring us forth a teaching of all the components that bring us to Perfection the process is called the adoption of the children Sons and Daughters of God in that process to to come to the adoption it is called the three steps of Grace and these bring us toward the Perfection the AP chapter 4 beginning in verse 5 to redeem to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoptions of sons and because you are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of the son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore thou are not more servant but a son and if a son there an he of God through Christ the man that is born again the woman that is Born Again baptized with the Holy Spirit Paul says you receive the spirit of your son the Holy Spirit the holy spirit that is inside crying out to the father father always and of the crying out of crying out to the father and when the father hears that he identifies you look that is my son Ephesians 4 beginning with the verse 4 Ephesians 44 uh sorry it's Ephesians 1:4 according as he hath chosen us and be formed the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will how how Paul spoke here he chose us in him before the foundations of the world where the land Lamb of God was slain it was a great plan of God before there was anything here over the face of of the Earth the in the mind of God was a plan the the book of the Lamb's Book of Life your name and my name were already written he had already chosen us before the foundations of the world for a purpose or without blemish before him but of ministri that want want to maintain always feeling that you are dirty that you're filthy that you are weak that you need them they never lift you up any higher in the promis of but Paul brought forth to the heights some great Heights so we were holy and without blemish before the Lord father Romans 8 chapter 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage against fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father we are no longer slaves God has given us the freedom it is it is said in the old times here in the United States Abraham Lincoln when the President Abraham Lincoln he made a proclamation in such day in such day such hour the sun RIS all of the people of the of the black people they were no longer slaves and they were going to be free on the sunrise of the sun on a certain day all God prepared it says a great Farm of slaves of people of color some elderly people that can barely walk think may God bless you testing testing amen amen just a small disturbance Galatians 5 and beginning with the verse 19 and Paul says this way now the works of the flesh are manifest which are thou adultery fornication that was the falling in the beginning that was the act that that happened there that broke up the family of God the rest that I'm about to read that Paul placed in the Holy scri are the attributes of this act of the adultery and fornication exist in the lives of the men and women that practice these vices with that way of thinking we read it once again now the works of the flesh are manifest which are those adultery and fornication now the attributes of fornicating and adulter people IM uncleanliness lasia lishness idolatria idolatry witchcraft hatred Varian ulation wrath Strife sedition heres en EnV murders drunkness re and such like as I have also told you in the time of that they have wish I do such things that they which do such shall things not inherit the kingdom of God adultery and fornication it was the act in the beginning that brought forth all of these attributes that are connected to the infidelity being physical being spiritual but Paul says in verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentl goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with th affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of provoking one another envying one another what was Paul speaking about what the Lord Jesus spoke about a restored friendship with the father entering in a journey adoption but before we come to this relationship as children being adopted there are three steps three steps of Grace justification through the faith that signifies that you have the individual truly and sincerely has believed that the Lord Jesus Christ Christ has died for me not the recognition that he died for the world oh I believe Jesus was a slain lamb his his blood was shed to the world but when it's justification a personal experience you become the owner of that and you believe God Jesus Jesus died for me as an individual for me you remember Matthew verse 17 and it says and Jesus answered unto him and said blessed art thou Simon barah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in the heavens and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon the rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it here Peter he had received here a revelation but he still did not have the new birth he had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit he entered in a stage justified by the faith he was able now to see that by the law he was never going to be perfected by the law he can never have the rest that God was willing to give him because every error that he committed if before he was not worthy now less but a revelation captured his heart that he was Jesus that Jesus was his Savior and here Peter was justified if by the faith Sanctified by the spirit that begins to free us of the negative behavior of this flesh and we begin to dress in a different way speaking differently our walk is different the great holy spirit of God can change you in such a way that now your friends your family they no longer know you they tell you you are no longer the same what has is because you're passing through the the steps of the Fai justified by the Fai Sanctified by the spirit the prophet of God said this is God working with you freeing us of our characteristics of the sexual birth of the the birth of the flesh now now we ha to be aggressive AR to be arrogant bigant in bigoted FR blunt critic critical Egoista cynical dishonest distant envious greedy guarded because we say you know you don't know how much wrong they have done to me we come to be very guarded to the max and getting away from the True Fellowship of the brothers and sisters that can help us hle hostile indifferent in intolerant irresponsible jealous jealous to the negative things pessimistic prideful resentful the root of bitterness grows rude simply we we say because I can too sad skeptical uh suspicious thoughtless suspicious a thoughtless when we should consider ourselves if we have have been born again through a new birth these attributes that are here need to Surge we push him down once again because we've had a new birth the one that hasn't had it he lets loose with those attributes he he can't resist the devil because he has not been born again and the baptism of the holy spirit with fire and these three bring us with a restored friendship with the father that is called adoption it makes forth the Perfection Paul told the Hebrews in Hebrews chapter 7 verse 18 listen for there is verely a dising of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for there is verely dising in other words canel of the the Commandment before for the weakness and unpr profitableness for the law made nothing perfect Paul here reveals to us of the Commandment which he was speaking and not only one of the 10 because the Ten Commandments that God gave Israel it was a proverb that it was going to never bring it would count them as are guilty in every negative attribute for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing of inner hope better did by the which we draw nigh unto God correct correct Paul was speaking of the Ten Commandments and Jesus in the parable of adoption and Perfection which is Matthew 5 6 and he also mentions and tells us how they were going to be canell invalidated here it is the amation of God admonition admonition opening the book that Adam lost and telling us things that were hidden before the foundations of the world you know the prophecy in Revelation 5 it tells us the first one to open the book and let loose the Seven Seals it was the Lord Jesus Christ no no William Bram someone says no no it was William Bram no no no no the first one to open the book The Book of the the Lamb's Book of Life the book that was sealed with the Seven Seals it was the lion of the tribe of Judah and he opened this book of redemption to Israel because Israel was a son it was the elderly son and to him it pertained all the inheritance of father and God does not his word he fulfills his word so he firstly offered Redemption to Israel he opened the book and he let loose the Seven Seals of chapter 4 of Matthew to 23 in the Gospels the Lord Jesus was opening the book to Israel of the new birth of the Perfection of The Eternity of the predestination all everything the Lord Jesus in Parable everything that was in the book The Apostles came forth they added more details through the Same Spirit a a language that is more elevated Peter spoke of the same things that Jesus spoke so that the fishes would be able to understand rough strong men of strong characters God had an apostle for all personality there's a more bland person there is John the one that would put his head on the on the chest of the Lord Jesus Matthew 13 remembering the ministry of the Lord Jesus he did not preach Jesus opened the book he let loose the Seven Seals he did everything in par that is how it was spoken by the the prophets in the old times he was going to speak in Parables and without Parables he did not speak but in Parables he was going to R his entire book and let loose what is a parable it is a prophetic word speaking in symbols are common things that you and I know but they were symbols and not L Matthew 13 verse4 all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spake he not unto them but why Lord that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of of the world it says I will bring things say I will bring forth things that only the ears of Adam have heard then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field between the great multitudes the one that the Lord Jesus Christ expressed the words through Parables thousands 8 20,000 they would just go and just a handful will just return still even not understanding but Lord we we didn't understand you either explain to us the parable of the tears of the field give us the revelation of your book he answered and said unto them he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man in many ways the good seed is seed when we go to visit someone when someone comes to our homes they begin to speak you say that doesn't appears correctly to me that doesn't look right so we know it's not the son of man speaking to him he has to be in the word so that when somebody comes to have fellowship and have something of the Bible and it says you know that today this day in in in our in our time the scripture has been fulfilled the seed of God for the first time god father spoke to his son Adam lip to ear lip to ear now speak to the Fallen race of Adam you and I the same way that he spoke to Adam speaking to us today and this is what Adam heard in the day of Eden before his fall God spoke to him the because the word of God is an eternal word if you read it in the New Testament it's not that it's a new thought of God this word of God was in his mind before the foundation of the world he does not have a new thought so when Jesus said be their perfect even as your father which is in the heaven is perfect it was something that he told Adam before the creation and this is the admonition and the Divine teaching of which Adam and Eve fell these are not admonitions of only a new testament this was in the mind of God before the foundations of the world be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that is a parable it is written it's a mystery the Revelation is required to what the Lord Jesus said and the Revelation is required when he said be ye it is because of the 47 verses before that for years we read the Bible like reading an newspaper and magazine and we come to the verse 48 be therefore perfect in our hearts we say it sounds good but we can't be perfect can you imagine that is the man of Flesh he read the 47 verses in the Bible just to read verse 48 and say it's not possible it's not possible and the Lord Jesus for 47 vers telling us it's possible and these are the small steps to come to it justification by faith brings peace peace with God it is the beginning of what we call the Born Again experience that is the beginning of a change sanctification by the spirit it brings forth strength to abstain from fornication immoralities a filthy life to be abusive have a toxic personality sanctification through the spirit brings forth more change how he spoke it changes us we're no longer aggressive with their wife with children with brothers in Christ with our mother and father we are no longer arrogant we're no we're no longerot we are no longer so blunt that we cause problems at our homes God is changing us through a new birth for the three steps of Grace by the baptism of the holy spirit because refilling after refilling of after of his Spirit Psalms 51:2 it says David restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will I teach the transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee the soul of this man was crying out for a new birth because he said if I can if I'm able to receive this then only then I will teach the trans transgressors the way I'm going to be able to tell them did you know me before now you can see I'm no longer the same come and receive what I have received and sinners shall be converted unto thee because I am also a person Lord Jesus that you have converted the baptism of the Holy Spirit it restores a friendship with the Father the refilling of the holy spirit that increases our our loving Faith taking us to Perfection the baptism of the Holy Spirit it is another change A Change Is to grow and growing towards Perfection Matthew 5 verse 6ap the chapters 5 six and seven it is Jesus teaching us on Perfection it is a process that takes us to the adoption through the Holy Spirit and the adoption it is a friendship restored with the father what are our three steps justification by faith sanctification by the spirit the baptis the baptism of the Holy Spirit through a restored friendship with the father but it does not end there because after you receive the Holy Spirit of of fire you will come out to this world and you will be tested every day the devil will attack you so if you you have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit what's next with each test each hard battle that you can see look back that the Lord has set you free it gave you strength to overcome like a true gentleman like a true daughter of God in truth and you thought oh I'm never going to get out of this this trial it will finish me and we all look back and we say glory to the Lord I have been set free you know what that was what gave you the freedom what gave you the strength what gave you the encouragement it was a refilling of the Holy Spirit the refilling are not given because we behave a good for an entire week no no the refilling of the Holy Spirit the Lord gives you them to overcome a new battle overcome a new tribulation to overcome a sickness to overcome to overcome a STP a cold Matthew 8 and verse one are now closing in this evening and it says when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him and he was preaching to them the Redemption he was the Lamb of God but the lamb people people did not understand anything he spoke it in Parables but the season would come when God was going to bring them the Revelation through a ritual to be born again and receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit here in Matthew 8 he brought forth his teaching with a few State statements to close but he did not place he placed a comma because men of God were Anointed with the holy men that were born again to also bring word over word line over line how like Peter in Paul that were going to continue to add even more details to this Plan of Redemption through the anointing of the Holy Spirit and where Jesus began his teaching in the Perfection it was in Matthew Chapter 5 in verse one and here it says this way and seeing the multitudes he went up into the mountain and when he was said his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit not in money not in invest not in in cars not in a new vehicle blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven There we all begin poor in spirit we are born in sin formed in iniquity to this world we
