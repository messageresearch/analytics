[36:13] special bless our brother
[36:29] praise the
[36:30] Lord presence
[36:34] already I just want to read a
[36:38] scripture and um if you want to turn to
[36:42] it because that way we can save some
[36:45] time that we don't have to read it in
[36:47] Spanish or say it in
[36:49] Spanish but it's going to be in the book
[36:52] of Hebrews chapter
[36:55] 10 and uh it's starting at
[36:59] verse
[37:01] 12 and I believe this will encourage
[37:06] you and uh I just believe that the word
[37:09] of God is everything we have need
[37:13] of so it' be uh Hebrews 10 verse 12 and
[37:18] we're going to read a few a few uh
[37:20] verses but I think it's to uh to help
[37:24] us so it says uh verse 12 but this this
[37:27] man after he had offered one sacrifice
[37:30] for sins forever sat down on the right
[37:37] hand right hand of
[37:44] God verse 13 from henceforth expecting
[37:48] till his enemies be made his
[37:54] footstone for by one offering he hath
[37:56] perfected forever them that are
[38:02] Sanctified verse 15 whereof the Holy
[38:05] Ghost also is a witness to us for after
[38:08] that he had said
[38:14] before this is the Covenant that I will
[38:18] make with them that after those days
[38:20] sayeth the Lord I will put my laws into
[38:22] their hearts and in their minds will I
[38:24] write them
[38:31] and their sins and iniquities will I
[38:33] remember no more
[38:39] yeah now where remission of these is
[38:42] there is no more offering for
[38:46] sin verse 19 having therefore Brethren
[38:50] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[38:52] the blood of Jesus
[38:58] and we'll go skip down to 22 and
[39:02] 23 and it says let us draw near with a

[58:37] be able to follow everything that the
[58:39] man of God was saying but everything
[58:42] that he said there was something in it
[58:44] for each and every one of you and if and
[58:47] if you're sincere and and you wait on
[58:50] God God has something for
[58:55] you for
[59:28] am
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:21] God bless you all this morning
[1:00:27] you may be seated for a few
[1:00:29] moments I I wanted to give a testimony
[1:00:32] this
[1:00:34] morning and I I labeled it the figeroa
[1:00:40] testimony and it's uh healings that took
[1:00:43] place in our
[1:00:46] family through through the ministry of
[1:00:49] brother brother
[1:00:51] Branham and this testimony begins back
[1:00:54] in the end of World War I
[1:00:59] my father went to war against the
[1:01:04] Germans and in
[1:01:06] Europe and an uncle of mine a brother of
[1:01:09] my
[1:01:10] dad's his name was Julio J and he went
[1:01:14] to war against the
[1:01:18] Japanese uh in the in the uh in the uh
[1:01:22] Pacific pacif and when they came back
[1:01:26] from the
[1:01:28] war this was
[1:01:32] 1945 uh my Uncle Julio came back very
[1:01:36] very
[1:01:40] sick uh
[1:01:42] mentally for all the things he had seen
[1:01:45] in
[1:01:47] war you know the movies they they they
[1:01:50] paint it up make it look
[1:01:54] nice but War is
[1:01:57] ugly you can when you're standing there
[1:02:00] and and someone next to you is blown to
[1:02:08] pieces you pick them up and put them in
[1:02:11] a
[1:02:13] bag covered in
[1:02:16] blood it's not a pretty
[1:02:19] thing and that war in the Pacific was an
[1:02:22] awful awful War
[1:02:26] and about the time that he came back
[1:02:29] from war my dad was was searching for
[1:02:34] God uh he was a
[1:02:37] Catholic but he KN he knew there was
[1:02:41] more and he began to
[1:02:43] look and he was living with his mother
[1:02:46] at that time my
[1:02:50] grandmother and and they began to have a
[1:02:55] uh Bible studies with the Jehovah's
[1:02:59] Witnesses and also there was uh some uh
[1:03:04] Apostolic
[1:03:06] ministers that were also giving them
[1:03:08] Bible
[1:03:10] studies and they saw there were two
[1:03:11] different
[1:03:15] gospels and and it was my dad and
[1:03:18] another brother of his my uncle
[1:03:23] Fred Fred Fred Figo he's still
[1:03:27] I think you might know brother
[1:03:29] Fred and uh so they were they were
[1:03:32] having these Bible studies there in the
[1:03:35] home and the apostolic one of the
[1:03:37] apostolic Brothers uh came to them one
[1:03:41] day and he says we know we're going to
[1:03:44] Phoenix Phoenix this was about
[1:03:48] 1948 47
[1:03:51] 48 and he said there's a brother who's
[1:03:53] coming to Phoenix he's got a gift of
[1:03:55] healing
[1:03:58] and would you like to go with us and
[1:04:01] they said yeah so they went to Phoenix
[1:04:03] and my dad told
[1:04:06] me he said I've never seen such a
[1:04:10] thing and he says there were people
[1:04:12] laying in CS dying of
[1:04:16] cancer raised
[1:04:18] up the blind would see the deaf would
[1:04:22] hear it was back in the day when not a
[1:04:25] single person went went through the
[1:04:26] platform without being
[1:04:30] healed they saw people come off of
[1:04:35] wheelchairs and Miracle after
[1:04:38] Miracle when they came back from Phoenix
[1:04:43] saido they were completely
[1:04:45] changed they knew God was
[1:04:49] alive brother Brandon brought a a
[1:04:52] historical God
[1:04:55] many churches and denominations had him
[1:04:58] painted on the
[1:05:02] wall he took this word and made it
[1:05:06] live and so they said goodbye to the
[1:05:09] Jehovah's
[1:05:11] Witnesses and they began to attend the
[1:05:13] apostolic
[1:05:16] church and uh and about that time my
[1:05:19] father was
[1:05:22] married and so they uh began to uh build
[1:05:28] a
[1:05:30] home and so in 1953 I was
[1:05:35] born my father at that time was working
[1:05:38] at the
[1:05:40] mines of s
[1:05:42] Manuel and he would work uh morning
[1:05:45] shifts day shifts night
[1:05:51] shifts they called a swing shift
[1:05:56] and that grandmother of mine my dad's
[1:05:59] mother they were they came to Phoenix
[1:06:02] because brother bam was going to be be
[1:06:04] preaching
[1:06:06] again and I was it was probably about
[1:06:09] 1955
[1:06:11] sometime I was about two years
[1:06:14] old I was born very
[1:06:18] sick I had problems with my
[1:06:21] intestines and I couldn't have a normal
[1:06:23] bowel movement because of that
[1:06:28] and so they had to take me to the
[1:06:29] clinics and wash me
[1:06:33] out and doctors wanted to operate on me
[1:06:35] back in
[1:06:39] 1955 and back in 55 it it probably
[1:06:42] wouldn't have been very
[1:06:46] good and so uh they they took
[1:06:49] me and my mother was born in Mexico
[1:06:57] and she didn't know
[1:06:59] English she understood it but she didn't
[1:07:01] speak
[1:07:02] it and I don't know what servant brother
[1:07:04] brand preached we don't
[1:07:07] know but at the end of the service he
[1:07:10] began to pray for the
[1:07:15] sick and my mother understood he said
[1:07:18] put your hand upon anyone is near you
[1:07:20] that sick
[1:07:27] I'm going to pray over the
[1:07:29] audience and U my mother put her hand
[1:07:33] over my
[1:07:35] stomach as brother BR
[1:07:38] prayed and he
[1:07:41] prayed and the next
[1:07:43] day I was completely
[1:07:46] healed never had to go back to a doctor
[1:07:48] ever
[1:07:50] again my mother was in the backyard
[1:07:55] those old washing machines with the
[1:07:59] rollers they they would they would uh
[1:08:02] rinse out the clothes
[1:08:05] and she was washing clothes in the
[1:08:09] backyard and we lived outside in the
[1:08:12] outskirts of the city in the
[1:08:15] desert and there were snakes
[1:08:18] obviously and my my older brother he was
[1:08:21] about about about seven or eight
[1:08:26] uh came running to my
[1:08:27] mom he said come see Bobby they call me
[1:08:31] Bobby and she got scared she comes
[1:08:34] running and there was a faucet that was
[1:08:36] sticking out of the
[1:08:39] ground and I and I had a hold of that
[1:08:44] faucet and that was a complete
[1:08:51] mess completely
[1:08:54] healed and that was the first miracle
[1:08:56] took place in our life through brother
[1:08:58] br's
[1:09:00] Ministry in 1957 my parents went to
[1:09:03] Phoenix
[1:09:05] again phoen and there was a place called
[1:09:08] Madison Square
[1:09:09] Garden Madison Square Gardens it had
[1:09:12] been a a a a a place for for
[1:09:19] fighting and uh and brother Bram said
[1:09:22] that this place had balconies
[1:09:26] and I was giving this testimony inalis
[1:09:28] one day and brother Billy Paul was
[1:09:33] present afterwards we went to eat
[1:09:36] somewhere and brother Billy Paul told
[1:09:39] me that brother BR had told him that was
[1:09:42] the hardest place for him to
[1:09:46] preach it took three days to get all the
[1:09:48] evil spirits out of that
[1:09:54] building he said he said he could see
[1:09:56] them hanging like bats hanging from the
[1:10:02] balcony and uh and so that was the place
[1:10:06] that they that they
[1:10:07] went and there were three things that
[1:10:09] were going on in the family at that
[1:10:12] time my mother had a a growth on her
[1:10:15] left
[1:10:18] breast and she it was very
[1:10:21] painful and my dad working in the minds
[1:10:26] H he used to use use those rubber boots
[1:10:28] all the way up to the
[1:10:31] knees because
[1:10:33] water and it caused a skin
[1:10:39] disease and he would scratch in in in
[1:10:41] his
[1:10:44] sleep and he would end up with scabs and
[1:10:49] bleeding and my oldest brother my older
[1:10:52] brother his name was Julio like my uncle
[1:10:57] uh he was about eight nine years
[1:10:59] old every night he would get up and his
[1:11:04] sleep and they had to be watching him
[1:11:06] every
[1:11:08] night because he might go
[1:11:11] outside he would turn on the stoves and
[1:11:15] things and we lived in a small
[1:11:18] house it was a living
[1:11:20] room and it was a
[1:11:23] kitchen and between the kitchen and and
[1:11:25] and and there was a doorway to a
[1:11:29] bedroom and my brother would lay out a c
[1:11:32] a folding
[1:11:34] C and right there in the doorway so my
[1:11:37] parents could be watching him during the
[1:11:40] night so so they went to to Madison
[1:11:43] Square Garden that
[1:11:45] night Madison Square Garden and brother
[1:11:47] bran preached the message what think he
[1:11:49] of
[1:11:52] Christ and I've heard this many times
[1:11:56] and I and I got it
[1:11:58] memorized and and brother Ram is as they
[1:12:01] playing only believe in the
[1:12:06] organ they they they come to the
[1:12:09] platform and he first thing he says a
[1:12:14] lady uh I thought she was
[1:12:18] deaf but she can't speak
[1:12:22] English and you are her husband
[1:12:26] and you come to speak for
[1:12:29] her he says speak to her as I
[1:12:33] speak he said you're coming here asking
[1:12:35] prayer for
[1:12:38] yourself for a growth on your left
[1:12:43] breast if that is true raise up your
[1:12:46] hand and she raised up her hand before
[1:12:48] thousands
[1:12:50] of giving testimony that was the
[1:12:54] truth and and and then he said and
[1:12:56] you're asking prayer for your
[1:12:59] husband my dad standing there didn't
[1:13:01] know she was praying for
[1:13:06] him and this total
[1:13:10] stranger it tells him you're you're
[1:13:14] praying for your
[1:13:15] husband because he's got a skin
[1:13:19] disease and then he about a moment goes
[1:13:23] by and when oh I forgot to say that when
[1:13:26] they when they began to call out their
[1:13:30] number my brother was laying asleep at
[1:13:32] their
[1:13:34] feet way in the
[1:13:37] back and and they were trying to wake
[1:13:39] him
[1:13:40] up and when he was asleep they couldn't
[1:13:42] wake him
[1:13:44] up and finally my dad stood
[1:13:46] up he said let's leave him here God
[1:13:49] knows our
[1:13:51] need so they went and then brother Bram
[1:13:55] says and you have a
[1:13:58] son that gets up in his
[1:14:01] sleep with his eyes
[1:14:04] open my mother understood
[1:14:07] that there's 1100
[1:14:11] tapes there's not a scream like the
[1:14:13] scream that she
[1:14:15] screams a wailing
[1:14:18] scream and even even in the computer it
[1:14:21] says the editor says the lady screams
[1:14:27] and when she screams You Hear the
[1:14:31] People pring
[1:14:33] God and and brother Bram
[1:14:36] says he says receive it in the name of
[1:14:38] the Lord
[1:14:40] Jesus as my father passed before
[1:14:43] them as they going to the other side my
[1:14:46] dad said brother BR patted him on the on
[1:14:48] the
[1:14:51] shoulder and he said just believe
[1:14:55] everything's going to be all
[1:14:57] right they came
[1:14:59] home instantly
[1:15:02] healed my dad was instantly
[1:15:05] healed and they came home telling all
[1:15:07] the apostolic
[1:15:10] people the
[1:15:12] testimony they were so
[1:15:15] happy but you know Satan all always try
[1:15:17] to come and try
[1:15:20] you he'll try to steal your faith
[1:15:25] my my brother had not been prayed
[1:15:28] for and I and I believe he had an evil
[1:15:30] spirit in
[1:15:32] him and it had to had to be had to be
[1:15:35] cast
[1:15:38] out but brother Bram told my
[1:15:41] dad everything's going to be all
[1:15:44] right and so they came home and the next
[1:15:48] night my dad was asleep he was a light
[1:15:53] sleeper and he hurt a noise and he
[1:15:56] immediately woke
[1:15:58] up like 2:00 in the
[1:16:01] morning and he was wide
[1:16:04] awake you know how sometimes you wake up
[1:16:06] you're going like
[1:16:09] this completely
[1:16:12] away and he lay there for a moment maybe
[1:16:14] a Prowler or someone was
[1:16:20] outside and he waited nothing
[1:16:23] happened so he went to put his feet on
[1:16:26] the
[1:16:28] floor and as he was putting his feet on
[1:16:30] the
[1:16:33] floor my brother is is right there in
[1:16:35] that c and he's getting
[1:16:38] up he's getting up and his sleep
[1:16:41] again my dad
[1:16:43] said he he told me
[1:16:46] this he says I didn't even I didn't even
[1:16:49] think of what I was going to
[1:16:52] say but I pointed my finger
[1:16:56] and I said
[1:16:58] Satan I rebuke you in the name of
[1:17:01] Jesus my brother stopped in
[1:17:05] midair fell back on that
[1:17:07] bed never got up
[1:17:10] again God took care of it care he takes
[1:17:13] care of all the
[1:17:15] details we don't have to worry about
[1:17:17] whether God's going to do this God's
[1:17:19] going to do
[1:17:21] that he takes care of the details
[1:17:25] hallelujah hallelujah and now we fast
[1:17:28] forward from 57 to
[1:17:34] 1965 brother

[1:17:56] dad about the about the
[1:18:00] sermons that's brother Daniel's
[1:18:04] father and my dad was already hearing
[1:18:06] the
[1:18:08] sermons and we heard we heard a
[1:18:11] rumor there was a brother coming to
[1:18:13] start a
[1:18:15] church the very first service we were
[1:18:19] there and we were there in other
[1:18:22] services as well
[1:18:24] Bram was still
[1:18:26] there remember this was in November
[1:18:31] 65 Bram went to the L went to be with
[1:18:34] the Lord in
[1:18:35] December of the 24th of SE
[1:18:42] December the following
[1:18:44] month dur during that time one of those
[1:18:47] times brother bam was was coming down
[1:18:50] the
[1:18:53] aisle at the end of one of the
[1:18:56] services and we had the short benches
[1:18:59] over on the side next to the
[1:19:03] windows my sister was here I was 12
[1:19:06] years old I standing
[1:19:09] here and my mother and then my dad
[1:19:11] against
[1:19:13] wall and brother started just greeting
[1:19:15] everybody as he as he
[1:19:18] came when he came to our
[1:19:21] bench he greeted my my my my sister
[1:19:26] he shook my
[1:19:27] hand I didn't know a lot about
[1:19:31] prophets I was just 12 years old but I
[1:19:34] heard a lot of things about this
[1:19:37] man and and I remember looking into his
[1:19:39] eyes when he shook my
[1:19:42] hand these deep set
[1:19:46] eyes and I thought he just looked right
[1:19:48] into my
[1:19:51] soul I I thought he saw every sin I ever
[1:19:54] committed
[1:19:57] I feared
[1:19:59] him but it was a
[1:20:02] respect I remember he reached over and
[1:20:04] he shook my mother's
[1:20:07] hand and my dad was so excited he's
[1:20:09] clear over he's
[1:20:15] reaching shook
[1:20:18] his and one of those Services it was a
[1:20:23] it was a Sunday morning
[1:20:26] that grandmother the one that my dad's
[1:20:30] mother she was a
[1:20:32] Believer and and she was
[1:20:35] dying time she her heart was giving
[1:20:39] out the doctors had given her
[1:20:43] up she had another son he was not a
[1:20:45] figuro but a
[1:20:50] DTE and he never
[1:20:52] married Ju
[1:20:56] and and he uh he took care of his
[1:20:59] mom and brother green told the
[1:21:02] church let brother brandham come and
[1:21:05] don't be bothering him for
[1:21:10] interviews I want him to feel
[1:21:12] comfortable here in the
[1:21:15] church so my dad obeyed the
[1:21:19] pastor he didn't bother brother
[1:21:22] brown but I I remember that Sunday
[1:21:25] morning service was
[1:21:28] over it was the old synagogue on Stone
[1:21:34] Avenue and on Stone Avenue Stone and
[1:21:39] they're in Tucson and uh we were all
[1:21:41] standing in front of the church after
[1:21:43] the
[1:21:45] service and there were two entres in the
[1:21:48] church there were seven steps and seven
[1:21:50] steps to The Landing
[1:21:55] and brother Bram we knew always came out
[1:21:57] this
[1:21:59] side so everybody was kind of talking
[1:22:02] but they were
[1:22:04] looking and brother Brandon stepped out
[1:22:06] of the
[1:22:08] church he had his Bible under his under
[1:22:11] his
[1:22:13] arm and he had a
[1:22:15] hat when he stepped when he stepped out
[1:22:17] of the
[1:22:18] church he put his head
[1:22:21] on he was on the landing
[1:22:25] and he was about to come down the
[1:22:28] steps when my uncle John ran up the
[1:22:31] steps to
[1:22:35] meet to speak to brother
[1:22:37] brandham and I remember
[1:22:40] thinking oh oh brother green is going to
[1:22:42] get
[1:22:44] mad because he's not supposed to be
[1:22:45] bothering
[1:22:47] brother but I knew he was going to ask
[1:22:50] prayer for my
[1:22:53] grandmother and I was too far away to
[1:22:57] hear but I could see him moving his
[1:22:59] hands as he spoke to brother
[1:23:03] BR I seen brother Bram take off his
[1:23:07] hat his his Bible under his
[1:23:10] arm he put his head over his
[1:23:13] heart and they both bowed their
[1:23:16] heads and he said a little
[1:23:19] prayer God extended her life 12 more
[1:23:22] years
[1:23:25] she went to be with the Lord in
[1:23:30] 1977 when these things that I saw I
[1:23:32] never thought that I'd be telling people
[1:23:35] and giving this
[1:23:39] testimony it was it was in my heart all
[1:23:42] this
[1:23:44] time when my uncle John
[1:23:49] died the pastor that he was that was
[1:23:51] over him didn't want to preach his
[1:23:53] funeral
[1:23:58] something that he was not paying his
[1:23:59] ties or
[1:24:02] whatever so we call Brother green
[1:24:04] brother green would you pre preach his
[1:24:08] funeral brother green said sure I
[1:24:12] will and his burial

[1:33:08] 2 speaking about this word that's
[1:33:14] unadulterated in second Corinthians 3:2
[1:33:17] it says ye are our epistle written in
[1:33:20] our hearts
[1:33:26] known and read of all
[1:33:30] men you are our epistle written in our
[1:33:36] hearts known and read of all

[1:33:52] think it's so real
[1:33:56] tonight that we should live the right
[1:33:58] kind of
[1:34:00] life because you see there's many people

[1:34:14] you he says they'll read
[1:34:17] you see you are a written Epistle of
[1:34:22] God a real real true born again
[1:34:27] Christian is the word expressed
[1:34:32] again because your written Epistles of
[1:34:37] God read of all

[1:34:56] unbeliever to express God in our own

[1:35:04] God is surrendered to to
[1:35:07] God and they're living their
[1:35:10] life they're living this

[1:42:33] revealing or the opening
[1:42:35] up of the
[1:42:37] Bible and what we call the spoken
[1:42:41] word it came to bring
[1:42:44] light upon this
[1:42:47] Bible you know that the without the
[1:42:50] Bible the message brother Bram has
[1:42:54] would have no

[1:43:07] manmade
[1:43:09] Theory some manade do IDE
[1:43:14] ored it's got to come back to the

[1:43:42] the poers god power of God to

[1:43:49] 65 paragraph 77
[1:43:53] now it's hard to say
[1:43:55] this it's very hard because speaking to
[1:43:58] people who feel the same way I
[1:44:01] do and the way I've been for
[1:44:04] years but since the opening of those
[1:44:06] Seven

[1:44:19] book
[1:44:21] friends because they didn't exist
[1:44:23] then he didn't pick up anything he he
[1:44:26] picked up his
[1:44:28] Bible since seven
[1:44:31] seal the opening of the
[1:44:34] word s the revealing of the
[1:44:38] words this book Hallelujah has become a
[1:44:42] new
[1:44:43] book glory to God it's the things has
[1:44:47] been
[1:44:48] hid is being
[1:44:51] revealed as God promised in Revelations
[1:44:54] 10 hallelujah hallelujah he would do it
[1:44:58] and we are the privileged
[1:45:01] people that God has
[1:45:04] chosen hallelujah
[1:45:06] hallelujah oh he chose me
[1:45:10] brother I wasn't looking for
[1:45:13] him but he came looking for
[1:45:15] me he came looking for
[1:45:18] you hallelujah hallelujah we are a
[1:45:22] privileged people brother
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:24] say that God has
[1:45:27] chosen of the
[1:45:29] earth why did he choose us because he
[1:45:33] knew that this word was going to live in
[1:45:38] us that we were going to be the Living
[1:45:42] Word
[1:45:44] people
[1:45:46] manif the word of God in
[1:45:49] this hallelujah hallelujah am
[1:45:56] that we might see and understand these
[1:46:01] things which is not some mythical
[1:46:05] fleshly Mind of a
[1:46:08] person trying to make it
[1:46:10] up it's a word of God made
[1:46:14] manifest where brother BR sure was
[1:46:18] manifested in him but that was not the
[1:46:21] purpose
[1:46:23] that there would be a
[1:46:24] people that would hear the Cry of the
[1:46:28] eagle amen something was stir by the
[1:46:33] inside Hallelujah when the Bible begins
[1:46:35] to say
[1:46:37] things start saying he's talking about
[1:46:40] me that word is talking about
[1:46:43] me I'm stepping into
[1:46:46] that by
[1:46:48] faith that I am a child of God there is
[1:46:52] a Pur for
[1:46:54] me in this
[1:46:56] life in this
[1:46:58] world to
[1:47:01] manifest the word of God in this hour
[1:47:05] hallelujah
[1:47:06] hallelujah
[1:47:09] amen it's the word of God made manifest
[1:47:12] and
[1:47:15] proven that it's right proven not by
[1:47:19] science but by God that's
[1:47:23] right God as I have said before in the
[1:47:28] message God doesn't need anyone to
[1:47:30] interpret his
[1:47:31] word hallelujah hallelujah he is his own
[1:47:37] interpreter he says it'll
[1:47:40] happen and it happens he confirms
[1:47:44] it and that interprets it right
[1:47:47] there when Christ comes you know he's
[1:47:51] coming for his word
[1:47:54] let me tell you something he's not
[1:47:55] coming for a spoken word
[1:47:59] book he's not coming for a
[1:48:02] tape he's not even coming for this Bible
[1:48:04] he's sitting
[1:48:05] here the Bible says that every
[1:48:08] everything in this world is going to
[1:48:11] burn but he's coming for his
[1:48:13] word hallelujah I said he's coming for
[1:48:16] his
[1:48:17] word where is his
[1:48:19] word where is the word of God
[1:48:24] is living in his
[1:48:26] bride we've been set upon this Earth for
[1:48:28] a
[1:48:30] purpose
[1:48:33] manifest every bride
[1:48:36] failed but this
[1:48:39] bride
[1:48:41] this this
[1:48:43] day will not
[1:48:45] fail she will manifest his
[1:48:48] word hallelujah
[1:48:51] hallelujah glory to God
[1:48:56] God doesn't need anyone he to interpret
[1:48:57] his
[1:49:00] word that's where we get into
[1:49:03] trouble when they start making up
[1:49:07] things start putting out things that are
[1:49:10] lies and then their life becomes a
[1:49:13] lie I was telling the brother last
[1:49:17] night I read somewhere where there was a
[1:49:20] pastor he was not a message pastor
[1:49:24] but but he he started preaching in his
[1:49:28] home to about 10
[1:49:30] people and it began to
[1:49:32] grow and in 10
[1:49:34] years he ended up with a Congregation of
[1:49:37] over 8,000
[1:49:44] people and everybody was
[1:49:47] happy it seemed like everything was
[1:49:49] going really
[1:49:50] well so one day he stood behind the
[1:49:54] pulpit and he said today this morning I
[1:49:56] resign as pastor of this

[1:58:08] God the Bible says they're a
[1:58:11] liar they're they're lying they're
[1:58:13] bringing
[1:58:15] untruths he said thou has found them
[1:58:18] Liars my that is a blunt statement
[1:58:23] thou has tried them who call themselves
[1:58:27] Apostles they call themselves
[1:58:30] apost isn't that
[1:58:33] presumptuous what right has a man to try
[1:58:36] those who call themselves
[1:58:40] Apostles you would say who am I to to
[1:58:43] question the
[1:58:45] apostles we're not talking about the
[1:58:47] Apostles of the Bible we talking

[1:59:18] gospel unto you that which we have
[1:59:20] already preached unto you

[1:59:27] cursed it was the apostles who brought
[1:59:29] the original word to the
[1:59:33] people that original word could not
[1:59:38] change Daniel it does change it remains
[1:59:42] ever the same the same yesterday today
[1:59:45] and
[1:59:46] forever God doesn't do one thing and

[2:00:22] even if I come and try if I come and try
[2:00:25] to give a second
[2:00:27] Revelation try to make one little
[2:00:30] chain in what I gave originally I gave
[2:00:34] originally let me be a
[2:00:37] cursed you see Paul

[2:00:56] correct hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[2:01:02] God can't give a first
[2:01:04] revelation and then a second
[2:01:07] Revelation if he
[2:01:09] did he would be changing his
[2:01:11] mind he could give a
[2:01:14] revelation he can give a
[2:01:17] revelation and then add to
[2:01:20] it as he did in in the Garden of Eden
[2:01:24] when he promised the seed to the
[2:01:26] woman then later designated that seed
[2:01:29] had to come through

[2:01:35] that just offered more
[2:01:39] information amen am and then later said
[2:01:43] it would come by the same Bloodlines in
[2:01:47] David it but it was the same revelation
[2:01:53] it never
[2:01:54] changed that
[2:01:56] Revelation cannot
[2:01:58] change it only gave the
[2:02:01] people more
[2:02:03] information to help them receive and
[2:02:07] understand brother BR says but God's
[2:02:10] word can't
[2:02:12] change the seed came exactly as
[2:02:17] revealed remember the seed there's
[2:02:18] nothing wrong with the
[2:02:20] seed perfect every

[2:12:15] Christ is come in the
[2:12:18] flesh is of God
[2:12:23] and every
[2:12:24] spirit that
[2:12:27] confesses
[2:12:29] not that Jesus Christ is come in the
[2:12:32] flesh is not of
[2:12:34] God and this is the spirit of the
[2:12:38] Antichrist whereof ye have heard that it

[2:13:02] well Jesus Christ prais
[2:13:06] God that he was the word made
[2:13:11] flesh we can take the scripture in the
[2:13:13] beginning with the
[2:13:16] word and the Word was with God and the
[2:13:19] Word was God
[2:13:21] and the word became
[2:13:24] flesh we can say praise God the word
[2:13:28] became
[2:13:29] flesh what about
[2:13:31] today what about you and
[2:13:34] I can you believe this
[2:13:36] morning and you take a step of faith and
[2:13:39] say praise
[2:13:40] God the word has become flesh
[2:13:43] again it's living in me that word is in
[2:13:48] me a living God
[2:13:51] with a spoken Living
[2:13:53] Word in a living
[2:13:57] being and he
[2:13:59] says if you don't believe that that is
[2:14:04] Antichrist we must
[2:14:07] believe that Christ the
[2:14:10] word is becoming flesh
[2:14:15] again praise be to
[2:14:17] God I'm going to finish with this quote

[2:16:07] way when so the Bible is manifested
[2:16:12] again like in the early days of the
[2:16:16] disciples just like the
[2:16:18] disciple the Bible is living living

[2:16:59] a
[2:17:01] church it's going to be born of the word
[2:17:04] of
[2:17:05] God because it is a Living Word of
[2:17:10] God do you see

[2:17:29] where did CL where did it class
[2:17:32] him a fanatic a crazy
[2:17:36] man yeah they found fault with a man who
[2:17:39] was the
[2:17:41] word don't think they're gonna find
[2:17:43] fault with
[2:17:44] you my I he was the
[2:17:49] word St John first chapter proves
[2:17:53] it in the beginning was the word and the
[2:17:57] Word was with God and the Word was made
[2:18:01] flesh and dwelt among
[2:18:03] us he was the Living Word of
[2:18:07] God because he was expressing God
[2:18:11] through
[2:18:12] himself so what are
[2:18:14] we when we become the Living Word of
[2:18:17] God expressing the same thing Jesus
[2:18:20] Christ did
[2:18:24] he was so completely surrendered to the
[2:18:27] word of
[2:18:29] God till he and the Word was the
[2:18:34] same that's exactly what the church TR
[2:18:36] to be
[2:18:38] today that the word of God is the
[2:18:43] same Christ is the the mystery of God
[2:18:46] [Music]
[2:18:48] revealed think by the living presence of
[2:18:51] the living
[2:18:53] Christ by The Living
[2:18:55] Word oh living
[2:18:58] Christ Living
[2:19:00] presence Living
[2:19:02] Word watch by his own

[2:19:09] Vindication proves his
[2:19:11] church not members he never done it in
[2:19:15] the days of
[2:19:16] Moses he never done in the days of
[2:19:18] anybody
[2:19:19] else the end of the world when it come
[2:19:22] to the place where it was the
[2:19:25] destruction the days of lot it wasn't
[2:19:30] membership me it was personal
[2:19:35] Vindication God in
[2:19:37] flesh see personal
[2:19:40] Vindication amen remember think of it
[2:19:44] that people born of his
[2:19:46] spirit in a day like this oh my
[2:19:51] in this great denominational age that we
[2:19:56] live and the Living God takes his living
[2:20:00] word and vindicates it
[2:20:04] personally this life that's in the
[2:20:07] word The Germ that's in the
[2:20:10] seed and the word is a
[2:20:13] seed that sorrow went forth to
[2:20:16] sow and the life is
[2:20:19] Christ in the world
[2:20:22] personally in
[2:20:24] you can you say
[2:20:26] amen hallelujah hallelujah vindicating
[2:20:29] something to you that you cannot
[2:20:32] do proving
[2:20:34] himself that it's not you it's by
[2:20:39] him the burden is on
[2:20:42] him all I got to do is
[2:20:45] surrender here am I
[2:20:47] Lord here am I Lord where where is the
[2:20:51] house that you built unto
[2:20:53] me and where is the place of my
[2:20:56] rest even to this man will I
[2:20:59] look or we can stand this morning say
[2:21:03] Lord where's a where is a where is a
[2:21:07] house that I can live in Here I Am
[2:21:12] Lord here I
[2:21:14] am come to me
[2:21:16] Lord me
[2:21:18] Lord word upon me
[2:21:21] let your word be
[2:21:22] manifested to this
[2:21:27] world of this last day hallelujah
[2:21:30] hallelujah
[2:21:31] GL there's so much
[2:21:39] more find that
[2:21:41] once one more quote I'm trying to
[2:21:49] find per
[2:21:51] Church
[2:21:55] age notice the harmony of the father and
[2:21:58] the
[2:21:59] son and this I'll be finishing with
[2:22:02] this Jesus never did anything until it
[2:22:05] was first showed him by the
[2:22:08] father 5 John
[2:22:11] 5:19 this harmony is now to
[2:22:14] exist between the groom and his
[2:22:18] bride he shows her his word of
[2:22:21] life she receives it she never doubts it
[2:22:27] Hallelujah therefore nothing can harm
[2:22:29] her not even
[2:22:32] death for if the seed be
[2:22:37] planted the water will raise it up
[2:22:41] again this is what I want to focus
[2:22:44] in here is the secret of
[2:22:47] this the word is in the bride
[2:22:52] as it was in
[2:22:54] Mary be it done unto me Lord as I will
[2:22:58] she surrendered herself she surrendered
[2:23:00] her body and the word came and formed in
[2:23:05] her and brother Brandon says the word is
[2:23:08] in the
[2:23:09] bride as it was in Mary the
[2:23:12] bride has a mind of
[2:23:15] Christ for she knows what he wants
[2:23:19] done the word
[2:23:22] she knows what he wants done with the
[2:23:26] word she perform the command of the word
[2:23:29] in his
[2:23:32] name for she has thus saith the
[2:23:38] Lord then the word is quickened by the
[2:23:41] spirit and it comes to
[2:23:44] pass like a seed that is planted in
[2:23:48] water it comes to full
[2:23:51] Harvest serving his
[2:23:54] purpose if you could bring this with
[2:23:56] what I spoke last
[2:23:59] night of breaking up the fellow
[2:24:02] ground get this ground
[2:24:05] ready for the
[2:24:07] receiving of that
[2:24:09] word the word in the spirit
[2:24:13] brother we become one with
[2:24:16] word
[2:24:18] Spirit blessed be his name father this
[2:24:21] morning
[2:24:22] Lord as we finish this this morning take
[2:24:26] all these broken words
[2:24:28] Lord father and deposit it in every
[2:24:32] heart to receive this
[2:24:35] Lord the importance of what our mission
[2:24:39] is here upon the Earth
[2:24:42] today you didn't call us to be another
[2:24:44] church
[2:24:46] Lord you didn't call us just to be
[2:24:48] another member
[2:24:51] to be a Pew
[2:24:53] warmer oh Lord you called us father
[2:24:55] because there's a word that you want us
[2:24:57] to

[2:25:08] all you're looking
[2:25:09] for is a house that will say here am
