[46:58] evening it's good to be back once
[47:01] again here in the presence of the Lord
[47:05] Jesus and in each other's
[47:08] presence here with Saints of light
[47:10] precious
[47:12] Faith washed in the blood of
[47:16] Jesus
[47:17] preparing we we are the bride of
[47:21] Christ and the bride of Christ is his
[47:24] wife and the bride is the wife adorning
[47:31] herself getting her wedding garment
[47:35] ready for for that day of the of a
[47:38] catching
[47:39] away so the marriage is taking place
[47:43] here even
[47:45] now but but as as as as the bride of
[47:49] Christ as the body of
[47:52] Christ it's it's a many membered body
[47:56] because his bride is
[47:59] Supernatural it's not just one person
[48:03] it's everyone who can
[48:06] believe and and surrender their lives to
[48:09] Jesus Christ through a born again
[48:13] experience it makes you part of that
[48:16] number part of the Bride of Jesus
[48:20] Christ and yet God doesn't deal with his
[48:23] bride as a group
[48:27] she she's identified as a
[48:30] group but he deals with you as an
[48:33] individual because he wants you to have
[48:36] a personal experience with
[48:40] him not not a group
[48:43] experience that uh that I belong
[48:52] toab or I'm a Catholic and I'm part of
[48:55] the Catholic
[48:56] church or I'm Pentecostal I'm part of
[48:59] this Pentecostal
[49:02] denomination no no no go God God doesn't
[49:04] see any of
[49:06] that he looks past all of
[49:09] that and he's looking in your
[49:12] heart your heart is surrendered to him
[49:17] not surrendered to a
[49:20] denomination not surrendered to to a
[49:22] certain
[49:23] church but a heart fully given to
[49:27] him one that's
[49:29] repented that that has
[49:33] repented and been
[49:35] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:37] Christ and then he said when you come
[49:41] out of that
[49:42] water a heart truly
[49:45] repented there is a supernatural baptism
[49:48] that takes
[49:50] place it's called the baptism of the
[49:52] Holy
[49:53] Ghost that's why you're still serving
[49:56] him
[49:58] today because of that Supernatural
[50:03] baptism and he said I'll give you
[50:06] refilling after refilling after
[50:09] refilling that'll help you to
[50:12] grow unto the stature of a perfect man a
[50:16] perfect
[50:17] woman and Perfection is the end
[50:21] goal and we all
[50:24] begin bless said are the poor in
[50:28] spirit that come to the feet of
[50:31] Jesus a broken human
[50:34] being and he lifts us up when we
[50:39] repent you love him this

[51:32] tonight bless their
[51:34] hearts brother joh Jonathan mentioned to
[51:37] me
[51:39] tonight that we probably won't be seeing
[51:42] him too much on Sundays between now and
[51:44] January
[51:48] sometime uh he's had some
[51:51] invitations the
[51:53] go so if you don't see

[51:58] ministering the
[52:00] gospel prayers with with him and his
[52:02] family
[52:05] God um turn with me in your
[52:14] Bibles and we'll be
[52:16] [Music]
[52:19] reading we'll be reading in first
[52:24] Thessalonians chapter
[52:28] 4 and we'll be beginning at at verse
[52:32] one 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse
[52:37] one and it reads like
[52:41] this furthermore then we beseech you
[52:44] Brethren and exhort you by the Lord
[52:46] Jesus that as he have received us of of
[52:50] us how ye ought to walk and to please
[52:53] God so ye would abound more and
[53:05] more for you know what commandment we
[53:08] gave you by the Lord
[53:12] Jesus for this is the will of
[53:16] God even your sanctification that you
[53:19] should abstain from
[53:23] fornication that every one of you should
[53:26] know how to possess his vessel in
[53:29] sanctification and
[53:33] honor Holiness was a huge struggle in
[53:37] the days of
[53:40] Paul Holiness was a huge struggle in the
[53:43] days when John the Baptist was on the
[53:49] scene you might say they had ceased to
[53:54] struggle
[53:57] they they had ceased to struggle for
[54:02] Holiness and they were living in
[54:04] fornication and
[54:06] adulter and Paul a great prophet of
[54:10] God sees the great need in the
[54:14] people not only the Pagan
[54:17] world but but the the but the Jewish
[54:21] people and he begins to address this
[54:24] issue this Grievious problem amongst the
[54:28] people verse four that every one of you
[54:31] should know how to possess his vessel in
[54:34] sanctification and
[54:38] honor not in the lust of
[54:41] concupisent even as the Gentiles which
[54:44] know not
[54:47] God that no man go beyond and defraud
[54:50] his brother in any
[54:54] way in other words he's talking about a
[54:57] man taking another man's
[55:01] wife he said because that the Lord is
[55:04] the Avenger of all
[55:06] such as we also have forewarned you and
[55:12] testified and then in verse seven he
[55:14] says for
[55:17] God hath not called us unto
[55:21] uncleanness but un to holiness
[55:26] a
[55:27] message to the world
[55:30] today because the world is
[55:35] unclean
[55:37] vulgar
[55:39] Wicked fornication and adultery runs in
[55:44] every
[55:46] home in every Church in every
[55:52] place let's pray heavenly father we
[55:56] thank you
[55:57] now that you're setting us free and
[56:00] opening the eyes of our
[56:03] understanding that we might give our
[56:05] lives to
[56:06] the we ask it now in Jesus name amen
[56:11] amen you may be
[56:15] seated for a title that we'd like to
[56:18] speak on for the next few
[56:21] Services marriage and
[56:23] divorce
[56:25] in our day and the
[56:28] subject to address
[56:31] this in the mouth of two or three
[56:35] Witnesses because it's a it's a it's a
[56:38] Bible
[56:39] principle and it's it was it was from
[56:42] the Old
[56:44] Testament and it carries over this Bible
[56:49] principle into a new
[56:51] testament into a new covenant there's
[56:54] there's few things in the Old
[56:57] Testament there there's few
[57:01] things that there's few things that
[57:03] carry
[57:06] over there's few there's few of
[57:11] them
[57:12] few there are there are a few things in
[57:15] the Old
[57:16] Testament that that carry over into the
[57:19] new from old to
[57:21] new but this is the
[57:23] principle this is one of those things
[57:26] that was thus saith the Lord in the Old
[57:29] Testament thus sayith the Lord in the
[57:31] New
[57:33] Testament marriage and
[57:36] divorce this message that brother
[57:38] Brandon
[57:39] preached has 326
[57:43] paragraphs and you can you can you
[57:45] cannot take one sentence or one
[57:49] paragraph and and think you have a true
[57:53] Revelation this message
[57:55] as all
[57:57] messages that were
[57:59] ministered by this Prophet were to
[58:02] provoke you and I to go back to the
[58:04] scriptures the
[58:08] Bible because the Bible is God's
[58:11] book The Bible and the Bible
[58:14] alone where the mysteries of God are
[58:17] laying where truth alone can be
[58:21] found in this subject using a Bible
[58:26] principle a truth once more is in the
[58:31] mouth of two or three
[58:33] witnesses there are three
[58:35] Witnesses in this great
[58:38] truth and if you don't bring up all
[58:40] three Witnesses
[58:43] together you'll not have the complete
[58:46] truth if we were to be standing before a
[58:50] in a in a in a
[58:53] courtroom
[58:55] and and and a trial was taking
[59:00] place and and and there is a person who
[59:03] is the
[59:05] accused they call it the
[59:08] defendant then they have the
[59:14] prosecutors and and uh the
[59:19] defendant and the one who's defending
[59:21] this
[59:23] person they we have three
[59:28] Witnesses by which we can
[59:30] prove that this man is
[59:34] innocent now if they don't allow these
[59:36] three witnesses to come
[59:40] forward three
[59:43] eyewitnesses then then they'll never
[59:45] know the truth of what took
[59:48] place so that's what we have
[59:50] here in in in this in this uh teaching
[59:55] of of marriage and
[59:57] divorce we have three
[1:00:00] Witnesses three witnesses can this great
[1:00:04] truth and we must bring them all
[1:00:07] together to have the complete
[1:00:10] truth Jesus Christ
[1:00:13] himself is one of those
[1:00:15] Witnesses and what he spoke in his
[1:00:18] Earthly
[1:00:19] Ministry then in the form of the Holy
[1:00:23] Spirit he gives
[1:00:25] Paul a great
[1:00:27] prophet an apostle another
[1:00:30] portion then once again the great Holy
[1:00:34] Spirit Jehovah God also uses
[1:00:39] Moses as one of these
[1:00:42] Witnesses then he brings forth a prophet
[1:00:45] in this 20th
[1:00:48] century to take all these loose ends and
[1:00:51] bring them
[1:00:53] together to bring together all these
[1:00:55] Bible
[1:00:57] truths that have been lay in the Book of
[1:01:00] Genesis that have been laying in this
[1:01:02] new
[1:01:04] testament things that Jesus said things
[1:01:07] that Moses said things that Paul said to
[1:01:11] give us the understanding
[1:01:16] truth and and yet even with this truth
[1:01:19] of marriage and
[1:01:23] divorce it it allows us to share with
[1:01:26] young
[1:01:28] couples how to have a better
[1:01:32] beginning so they can have a better
[1:01:35] end but of course people who have
[1:01:38] compromised their
[1:01:41] lives then then the the the the
[1:01:45] answer the answer is still God's
[1:01:50] word and the true answer makes them to
[1:01:54] understand and the the mess that their
[1:01:56] lives are
[1:02:03] in but
[1:02:06] nonetheless it it doesn't fix what
[1:02:09] they've already
[1:02:11] done but there can be forgiveness of
[1:02:15] course there is
[1:02:18] forgiveness so a man and a woman that
[1:02:20] their lives have been destroyed
[1:02:26] with foration and
[1:02:28] adultery there's there's definitely
[1:02:30] forgiveness
[1:02:33] available there's salvation
[1:02:36] available but all that a man and a woman
[1:02:41] soul that shall they
[1:02:44] reap so they they can come back to God
[1:02:48] if their lives to
[1:02:50] God but the things that they've done
[1:02:54] will have a longlasting negative effect
[1:02:57] on their
[1:02:58] lives and if they have children on their
[1:03:01] children's
[1:03:03] lives that is
[1:03:05] inevitable for the seeds that we
[1:03:08] plant once they grow and give
[1:03:11] fruit we've got to deal with that
[1:03:15] fruit and sometimes that's not
[1:03:18] pleasant so so the truth of marriage and
[1:03:22] divorce is is first and
[1:03:24] foremost for those who have yet not
[1:03:28] tangled up their lives with all kinds of
[1:03:33] ungodliness and of course when you
[1:03:36] preach that
[1:03:38] truth then it makes those whose lives
[1:03:41] have been
[1:03:44] compromised uncomfortable to hear the
[1:03:48] truth but those whose lives are
[1:03:52] compromised you must let us as ministers
[1:03:55] preach the
[1:03:57] truth to save an upcoming Young
[1:04:02] Generation so they don't have to suffer
[1:04:04] the
[1:04:06] consequences that many men and women
[1:04:08] today are still
[1:04:10] suffering so it's not
[1:04:13] said to hurt
[1:04:17] people who have made terrible
[1:04:20] mistakes but said to
[1:04:23] save and teach a younger
[1:04:26] generation how to have a better
[1:04:28] beginning
[1:04:30] in so that they can have a better ending
[1:04:32] in their
[1:04:35] relationship so it must be
[1:04:38] said it must be
[1:04:40] spoken from Genesis to
[1:04:43] Revelations the truths have always been
[1:04:46] in the
[1:04:47] Bible it simply took a prophetic
[1:04:52] gift to pull them together
[1:04:55] for the Bride of Jesus Christ for
[1:04:59] believers and it will take a prophetic
[1:05:04] Insight in your own life
[1:05:07] personally to catch
[1:05:10] it Revelations 2 and verse 7
[1:05:13] says he says it's it was the end of the
[1:05:16] Ephesian Church
[1:05:18] age and this is a statement that's used
[1:05:21] at the end of each Church
[1:05:23] age
[1:05:25] and the first time this this statement
[1:05:27] was
[1:05:29] used was Jesus in Matthew
[1:05:32] 11 when Jesus was
[1:05:35] preaching the opening of the first
[1:05:38] seal the ride of the first
[1:05:42] Rising his first
[1:05:45] coming and the opening of Gentile Church
[1:05:51] ages and Jesus made this statement
[1:05:55] and this statement is
[1:05:57] placed in Revelations
[1:06:00] 2 in every Church
[1:06:02] age from Ephesus to LA and Revelations
[1:06:07] 2:7
[1:06:08] says he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:06:13] what the spirit saith unto the
[1:06:16] churches to him that
[1:06:18] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[1:06:21] tree of life which is in the mid of the
[1:06:24] paradise of
[1:06:26] God so who is the revealer
[1:06:30] then the Holy Spirit the Lamb of God
[1:06:34] Jesus Christ the son of
[1:06:39] God William brandham Willam didn't add
[1:06:43] anything
[1:06:44] new as he told us himself for the Bible
[1:06:48] was a complete book
[1:06:50] already he said the ministry of the
[1:06:52] seventh angel was to bring all these
[1:06:55] loose ends
[1:06:57] together that are already written in the
[1:07:01] Bible but it took someone God sending a
[1:07:05] prophet and he told us he would send
[1:07:09] prophets we we read it last
[1:07:12] service in Matthew 23 about verse
[1:07:18] 3435 long after John the Baptist was
[1:07:22] dead it could have been months a year
[1:07:26] later John John had been beheaded by
[1:07:29] Herod the
[1:07:32] Great and Jesus said long after John is
[1:07:37] dead I will send you
[1:07:39] prophets wise men
[1:07:42] scribes because every time the devil
[1:07:45] kills one of God's
[1:07:48] men God's raising up another
[1:07:51] one to keep the word flowing to his
[1:07:55] people to inspire them to seek
[1:07:59] Revelation Matthew
[1:08:01] 19 let's read we're going to read from
[1:08:04] verse 1 to verse
[1:08:07] 12 bear with us in this
[1:08:10] reading Matthew
[1:08:12] 19 and verse
[1:08:14] one and it reads like this and it came
[1:08:18] to pass that when Jesus had finished
[1:08:21] these
[1:08:22] sayings
[1:08:25] he departed from Galilee and came into
[1:08:28] the coast of Judea Beyond
[1:08:35] Jordan and great multitudes followed
[1:08:38] him and he healed them there it was a
[1:08:42] great healing
[1:08:44] Revival that Jesus had
[1:08:46] begun and it was prophesied it would be
[1:08:50] so in Matthew 4 Jesus's Ministry
[1:08:54] begins and he's an
[1:08:56] evangelist praying for the sick and
[1:08:59] thousands are coming to his prayer
[1:09:02] meetings thousands are being
[1:09:05] healed it was the beginning of the
[1:09:08] ministry of the son of
[1:09:10] man Jesus a prophet a god Prophet Jesus
[1:09:16] a prophet of the
[1:09:19] prophets that's what the term son of man
[1:09:22] implied
[1:09:24] that when God came in
[1:09:27] flesh and made himself a body of
[1:09:31] Flesh it would be God living in this
[1:09:34] body not three Gods one God with three
[1:09:40] manifestations the son the Father the
[1:09:44] Holy Spirit but not three
[1:09:46] people that's Pagan belief to believe in
[1:09:49] many
[1:09:50] God but one God with three
[1:09:54] manifestations three distinct
[1:09:57] Ministries but the same person so
[1:10:01] here in Matthew
[1:10:04] 19 and the and verse two and great
[1:10:07] multitudes followed him and he healed
[1:10:09] them
[1:10:12] there the Pharisees also came unto
[1:10:16] him but for a different reason it says
[1:10:19] to tempt
[1:10:21] him to try to find fault in
[1:10:24] him that they could accuse him of
[1:10:27] something that would Mark him as a
[1:10:30] blasphemer of the
[1:10:32] law so that they could try to put him
[1:10:35] away and have him
[1:10:37] killed so he says and say and they came
[1:10:40] saying unto
[1:10:42] him is it lawful for a man to put away
[1:10:46] his wife for every
[1:10:50] cause they were trying to think of a
[1:10:53] subject
[1:10:55] that was highly
[1:10:57] controversial that would turn the tide
[1:10:59] of the Jewish people against
[1:11:03] Jesus and one of them said I've got
[1:11:06] it marriage and divorce he says anything
[1:11:10] different than what Moses
[1:11:13] said we've got him he'll be a
[1:11:17] blasphemer before Jehovah God
[1:11:20] himself and yet they didn't know it was
[1:11:23] Je
[1:11:25] that had come according to the
[1:11:28] Prophecies of the
[1:11:30] prophets to bring change to
[1:11:33] Israel who was living how in fornication
[1:11:37] in adultery and their prophets and their
[1:11:40] priests were
[1:11:43] drunken it was a vile horrible
[1:11:47] time the church was a chicken
[1:11:51] yard the people were pecking on the
[1:11:55] ground no one was looking up to
[1:11:59] heaven for messiah to
[1:12:01] come they were all pecking on the
[1:12:07] ground
[1:12:10] listen when the Pharisees came to him
[1:12:13] they said is it lawful for a man to put
[1:12:15] away his wife for every
[1:12:21] cause they asked him a question
[1:12:24] for which they thought they already had
[1:12:26] the
[1:12:29] answer he said and said and and he says
[1:12:32] he says and he answered and said unto
[1:12:35] them have ye not
[1:12:38] read that he which made them at the
[1:12:41] beginning made them male and
[1:12:45] female and said for this cause shall a
[1:12:49] man leave father and mother and cleave
[1:12:52] to his wife and then and they twain
[1:12:55] shall be one
[1:13:00] flesh that was that was a
[1:13:03] sermon at the high points of a
[1:13:07] sermon that the
[1:13:09] Pharisees and the
[1:13:11] Sadducees had never heard
[1:13:14] before that was not something that was
[1:13:16] preached under the
[1:13:19] law and yet it was in their Bibles it
[1:13:23] was in what the it was what in what they
[1:13:25] called the
[1:13:27] Torah the bonding books of Judaism the
[1:13:32] Torah it was laying right
[1:13:35] there and Moses had also said this
[1:13:39] part that wasn't being preached to the
[1:13:41] congregation
[1:13:43] so oh they heard of the first and second
[1:13:47] poll but who preached the third
[1:13:49] anymore and yet it was laying in there
[1:13:53] he says and he answered and said unto
[1:13:56] them have ye not read because he knew
[1:13:59] they
[1:14:03] hadn't that he which made them at the
[1:14:05] beginning made them male and
[1:14:08] female and said for this cause shall a
[1:14:11] man leave father and mother and shall
[1:14:14] cleave to his
[1:14:17] wife and they twain shall be one
[1:14:21] flesh then he says
[1:14:24] wherefore because it's written that way
[1:14:28] they are no more
[1:14:29] Twain but one
[1:14:32] flesh then he
[1:14:36] said he said thus saith the
[1:14:39] Lord they couldn't deny it he's quoting
[1:14:43] to them right from their own
[1:14:45] book but they never touched that part
[1:14:49] because they had no revelation of that
[1:14:51] part and then he tells tells
[1:14:54] him thus saith the
[1:14:58] Lord what God hath joined
[1:15:02] together let no man put us
[1:15:05] under their question
[1:15:08] was can we as
[1:15:12] men put put our marriage under and and
[1:15:16] divorce for any
[1:15:20] cause and he brought him down he took
[1:15:23] him back to the
[1:15:26] word and let them know can we he says is
[1:15:30] it lawful for a man to put away his wife
[1:15:32] for any
[1:15:35] cause and the and the final the final
[1:15:38] statement to them
[1:15:40] was what therefore God has joined
[1:15:45] together let no
[1:15:48] man thus sayith the
[1:15:52] Lord they say unto
[1:15:54] him if what you're telling us is really
[1:15:57] in the
[1:15:59] message why did Moses then command to
[1:16:01] give a writing of
[1:16:04] divorce to put her away the same thing
[1:16:08] to the same reason many men today can
[1:16:10] rise up and say I heard the prophet say
[1:16:12] this and this and
[1:16:19] this Jesus told these
[1:16:22] ministers there was evangelist there
[1:16:25] might have even been a prophet
[1:16:27] there an apostle a teacher a pastor the
[1:16:33] ministry was was was was grinding him
[1:16:36] down he saith unto them Moses let me
[1:16:41] tell you why the prophet said that
[1:16:45] Moses Moses the prophet said
[1:16:49] that because of the hardness
[1:16:55] of your hearts he suffered you to put
[1:16:58] away your
[1:17:00] wives but from the
[1:17:03] beginning it was not
[1:17:05] so and you know why Jesus had come you
[1:17:09] know why God had come in
[1:17:12] flesh you know why God had spoken the
[1:17:15] word and put a seed in this little
[1:17:17] virgin called
[1:17:21] Mary so that the son of God God could be
[1:17:24] born so that Jehovah Emmanuel could live
[1:17:27] in that
[1:17:29] body because he was coming to bring
[1:17:33] change change to
[1:17:35] Israel change to the
[1:17:37] Romans change to the
[1:17:40] Philistines change to
[1:17:42] everyone change to the black
[1:17:46] people change for the white people
[1:17:49] change for the colored
[1:17:52] people bring them
[1:17:54] change regardless of your color
[1:17:57] regardless of your
[1:17:59] nationality regardless of your
[1:18:02] ethnicity there was coming one change to
[1:18:05] deliver
[1:18:07] Mankind from the forication the adulter
[1:18:10] the uncleanness that they were all
[1:18:12] living
[1:18:13] in from the Kings to to the poorest
[1:18:17] bigger on the
[1:18:19] street God was bringing change and he
[1:18:22] want wanted to take us back to the
[1:18:25] beginning the way it
[1:18:28] was the original
[1:18:30] thought the original
[1:18:33] life the original family
[1:18:37] structure oh we're going
[1:18:39] back by the grace of God because he's
[1:18:43] here with us
[1:18:45] tonight to illuminate us to give us
[1:18:49] Revelation to recognize the day that
[1:18:52] we're living living was a day like it
[1:18:55] wasn't the days of
[1:18:56] Jesus our world was falling
[1:19:00] apart violence was
[1:19:02] everywhere morality was
[1:19:05] everywhere nakedness was
[1:19:08] everywhere but Jesus came and he said
[1:19:12] from the
[1:19:13] beginning it wasn't
[1:19:15] so and
[1:19:17] Moses gave you this writing of
[1:19:21] divorce not because it was thus saith
[1:19:23] the
[1:19:24] Lord and this is the way we'll always do
[1:19:27] it
[1:19:29] no Moses because of the hardness of your
[1:19:33] hearts suffered you to put away your
[1:19:37] wives but from the beginning it was not
[1:19:40] so verse n but I say unto you whosoever
[1:19:46] shall put away his
[1:19:48] wife
[1:19:51] except prior to this
[1:19:55] statement the men of
[1:19:57] Israel could put their wife
[1:20:01] away for any
[1:20:04] reason they could get up in the
[1:20:08] morning and he could
[1:20:11] say woman I've told you this is the
[1:20:15] third
[1:20:16] time don't earn the
[1:20:20] bacon I've had it
[1:20:23] grabs his napkin that the wife gave
[1:20:26] him your
[1:20:29] divorcees it to her doesn't say nothing
[1:20:33] points to the
[1:20:35] door and she was
[1:20:40] divorced and he'd go to the side door
[1:20:43] open it bring another one
[1:20:47] in just like
[1:20:49] that and there there was no price for
[1:20:51] the man to pay
[1:20:55] Moses told us we could do
[1:20:59] this it wasn't much better than
[1:21:02] before than they had the
[1:21:05] law and it got even
[1:21:08] worse as the years
[1:21:10] passed and when Jesus
[1:21:13] came it was a world falling
[1:21:16] apart it was a religious world falling
[1:21:19] apart it was a denominations falling
[1:21:22] apart
[1:21:23] it was Pagan Rome falling apart it was
[1:21:26] the world falling
[1:21:28] apart they said the fall of
[1:21:31] Rome one of the greatest Empires that
[1:21:34] ever ruled the
[1:21:37] world they didn't fall because other
[1:21:41] nations were so much
[1:21:43] stronger they fell from
[1:21:46] within their decadent and filthy
[1:21:51] lifestyles
[1:21:54] imal it is what brought the fall of
[1:21:57] Rome it's what brought the fall of the
[1:21:59] Jewish
[1:22:05] people verse
[1:22:07] n and I say unto you whosoever shall put
[1:22:10] away his wife except it be for
[1:22:13] fornication and shall marry another
[1:22:15] committeth adultery and whosoever Marth
[1:22:18] her which is put away doth commit
[1:22:21] adultery
[1:22:29] God was bringing great
[1:22:32] change from a time when the man could
[1:22:35] put away his wife for any
[1:22:39] reason to Jesus now coming he said we're
[1:22:43] going to start walking you people
[1:22:50] back to how it wasn't needen
[1:22:54] we're going to start even up evening up
[1:22:56] the score between the man and the
[1:23:00] woman when in the
[1:23:02] beginning the man and the woman were
[1:23:05] equal and when Jesus came he says I'm
[1:23:09] going to make it that way
[1:23:11] again I'm going to make the man as
[1:23:15] responsible for this Covenant for this
[1:23:20] relationship can he says at this time
[1:23:24] I'm giving you only one
[1:23:28] reason verse
[1:23:30] 10 it says his disciples say unto him
[1:23:34] his disciples mind
[1:23:36] you not the Pharisees not the scribes
[1:23:40] not his
[1:23:41] enemies he shocked his
[1:23:44] disciples because they weren't Bible
[1:23:47] readers they didn't hardly have and
[1:23:49] hardly any most of them didn't even know
[1:23:51] how to read
[1:23:55] his disciples saying unto him if the
[1:23:58] case of man be so with his
[1:24:03] wife then we as reasonable
[1:24:07] men we got to tell
[1:24:09] you it's not good to
[1:24:13] marry the change is too
[1:24:18] great one of them might have said I got
[1:24:21] four wives now what am I going to do
[1:24:23] with them with this change that's
[1:24:26] come it was a
[1:24:29] mess but he said unto
[1:24:33] them listen to
[1:24:36] this it's a
[1:24:38] revelation all men cannot receive this
[1:24:46] saying brother Daniel why won't all the
[1:24:49] men in this message line up to this
[1:24:51] truth
[1:24:54] because all
[1:24:56] men can all men cannot receive the
[1:25:01] same save
[1:25:04] they to whom it's
[1:25:06] given and it becomes a
[1:25:09] revelation that this is the best way to
[1:25:13] live man who will say teach
[1:25:16] us how to choose a bride teach us how to
[1:25:21] choose a group
[1:25:24] teach us how to have the right kind of a
[1:25:26] holy
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:35] courtship teach us
[1:25:38] Lord Revelation was just now starting to
[1:25:41] come
[1:25:44] up then Jesus
[1:25:46] said for there are some
[1:25:49] Unix verse
[1:25:51] 12
[1:25:53] which were so bornn from their mother's
[1:25:56] womb and there are some
[1:25:58] Unix which were made unic of
[1:26:02] men and there be
[1:26:04] Unix which have made themselves
[1:26:07] Unix for the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:26:10] sake he that is able to receive
[1:26:13] it let him receive it and
[1:26:17] remember Jesus was
[1:26:19] speaking in a parable so about the time
[1:26:23] you finish reading a
[1:26:25] sentence and you think I got
[1:26:28] it get it with a
[1:26:31] comma and don't get it with a
[1:26:34] period because there's
[1:26:36] more Matthew 5 and verse
[1:26:41] 27 Jesus
[1:26:44] speaking Matthew 5 was called the the
[1:26:51] Beatitudes um and but Matthew
[1:26:54] 5 is really
[1:26:58] Jesus speaking on
[1:27:00] Perfection and when and Perfection is
[1:27:03] the end
[1:27:05] result of a work that God has come to do
[1:27:08] in our
[1:27:10] lives Matthew
[1:27:12] 548 you all
[1:27:14] remember Jesus said be ye therefore
[1:27:19] perfect even as my Father which is in
[1:27:21] heaven is
[1:27:23] perfect so that is a closing
[1:27:28] statement on something Jesus was
[1:27:32] teaching and the be
[1:27:35] therefore
[1:27:37] represented the 47 verses
[1:27:41] before laying in those 47 verses
[1:27:45] prior is the mystery of a born again
[1:27:50] experience of a baptism of the Holy
[1:27:53] Spirit of refilling
[1:27:56] after laying in those
[1:27:59] 47s is the holy spirit wanting to teach
[1:28:03] you how to be sensitive to God to grow
[1:28:07] onto the stature of a
[1:28:09] perfect to to go from blessing of the
[1:28:12] porn
[1:28:14] Spirit to enter into
[1:28:16] Perfection the end goal the Capstone of
[1:28:20] a believer's life
[1:28:23] that's the wedding
[1:28:25] day Rapture time we're caught up in the
[1:28:29] A and the
[1:28:31] Perfection is eternal life to be as
[1:28:35] Eternal as the father which is in heaven
[1:28:37] is
[1:28:38] ET potentially you and I are
[1:28:42] Eternal not this body of fles but the
[1:28:46] seed of God the soul of God the man the
[1:28:50] man the woman you really are on the the
[1:28:53] inside that's where Perfection
[1:28:56] lays that's where eternal life is
[1:29:01] Promised in the
[1:29:04] message marriage and
[1:29:07] divorce says
[1:29:09] this he says this
[1:29:12] scripture this
[1:29:14] question confronted Jesus at the very
[1:29:16] beginning of his
[1:29:19] ministry and it confronted Moses at the
[1:29:22] very beginning of his
[1:29:25] ministry it's a foremost question in
[1:29:29] believer's
[1:29:31] Hearts The Sinner doesn't
[1:29:34] care but it's to Believers because the
[1:29:38] believer is trying to do all that he
[1:29:40] knows how to
[1:29:42] do to live right before
[1:29:44] God
[1:29:46] therefore if any question comes up on
[1:29:50] relation and the marriage and divorce
[1:29:53] case comes
[1:29:57] up because it's the cause of the
[1:30:00] original
[1:30:02] sin that's where sin
[1:30:04] started and that's the reason it's
[1:30:07] brought
[1:30:10] up every time because it's the very
[1:30:13] beginning of
[1:30:16] sin when Jesus spoke in Matthew
[1:30:20] 19
[1:30:22] in verse
[1:30:24] n and he and he said I say unto you
[1:30:28] whosoever shall put away his wife except
[1:30:30] it be for
[1:30:37] fornication now in one place brother Ram
[1:30:39] says of course fornication and
[1:30:45] adultery if you want to put one
[1:30:48] definition to
[1:30:50] both it's unclean
[1:30:54] living it's immoral
[1:30:56] living it's it's having it's it's having
[1:31:00] uh intimate Affairs when you're not
[1:31:03] married to that
[1:31:06] person
[1:31:07] fornication adultery both represent the
[1:31:10] same
[1:31:12] thing but
[1:31:14] fornication when you when you start to
[1:31:17] to to to place it more by
[1:31:20] itself then he said he says
[1:31:25] fornication is is
[1:31:27] is is what Young is what people who are
[1:31:31] not
[1:31:33] married single
[1:31:36] people who who enter into an intimate
[1:31:39] act
[1:31:40] together they're not husband and
[1:31:42] wife that's
[1:31:44] fornication now the same
[1:31:46] act between two people married people
[1:31:51] but there but but the ACT is not with
[1:31:53] their husband or their
[1:31:55] wife it's adultery so it's that's the
[1:31:59] same act but one is identifying people
[1:32:05] unmarried living
[1:32:07] unclean the others identifying married
[1:32:11] people living unclean but here in verse
[1:32:15] 9 Jesus mixes up the word
[1:32:20] fornication with a woman being a man's
[1:32:24] wife with a woman being
[1:32:29] a and that as and that in
[1:32:33] itself has brought a lot of
[1:32:36] confusion so then they say well if Jesus
[1:32:39] said it that way and brought
[1:32:42] confusion how will we understand
[1:32:45] it Jesus said go into all the world and
[1:32:50] preach the gospel baptizing them in the
[1:32:53] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:32:56] the Holy Spirit and that's brought a lot
[1:32:59] of
[1:33:00] confusion because Jesus was speaking in
[1:33:03] a parable the prophetic word that would
[1:33:07] be revealed later to his children so
[1:33:10] what's Jesus doing in Matthew
[1:33:13] 19 Jesus is speaking the prophetic word
[1:33:17] in a
[1:33:20] parable and the way we get it is exactly
[1:33:23] the
[1:33:24] same he hasn't changed his mind about
[1:33:27] how he's going to teach his children it
[1:33:30] has to be a
[1:33:32] revelation so here Jesus
[1:33:35] says and I say unto
[1:33:38] you
[1:33:40] whosoever shall put away his
[1:33:42] wife accept it before
[1:33:45] fornication and shall marry another
[1:33:49] committeth adultery so now he mixes up
[1:33:52] you're putting away your
[1:33:57] wife if she committed
[1:34:00] fornication so how do we bring this
[1:34:04] together because if it's your wife then
[1:34:08] wouldn't it be
[1:34:09] adultery but Jesus didn't say
[1:34:14] adulter so the
[1:34:18] definition we can look to dictionaries
[1:34:22] but the best way that God Reveals His
[1:34:26] word is by going back and here in
[1:34:29] Matthew
[1:34:30] 19 Jesus went back to the
[1:34:33] beginning so then that means that the
[1:34:37] answer lays back in the beginning but I
[1:34:41] want to tell you it's not only back in
[1:34:42] the
[1:34:43] beginning there's also examples in the
[1:34:46] New
[1:34:47] Testament but back in the
[1:34:50] beginning Eve
[1:34:53] was Adam's
[1:34:55] wife and yet they had never come
[1:35:00] together so when Eve had an
[1:35:04] encounter when Eve Adam's
[1:35:07] wife had an encounter with the serpent
[1:35:10] in the
[1:35:13] garden Eve was still a
[1:35:16] virgin and yet she was Adam's
[1:35:19] wife remember Mary
[1:35:21] when she was found with
[1:35:25] child of the Holy
[1:35:31] Ghost was she Joseph's wife
[1:35:35] then she
[1:35:37] was she was so much Joseph's
[1:35:41] wife but the Bible says they had never
[1:35:43] been
[1:35:46] together so she was
[1:35:48] Joseph's a virgin wife
[1:35:53] because of the vow under Jewish
[1:35:56] tradition when you made a
[1:35:58] vow of
[1:36:00] marriage you were husband and
[1:36:03] wife but she was also Joseph's
[1:36:06] Bride for there was a date set for the
[1:36:09] marriage to take
[1:36:11] place the marriage as in as in the as in
[1:36:14] the public
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:20] ceremony so so Mary Joseph's
[1:36:24] bride Joseph's
[1:36:27] wife she was given a time sometimes as
[1:36:29] much as a
[1:36:33] year and and though it was his wife he
[1:36:37] would never touch her until the wedding
[1:36:40] day until that public
[1:36:43] ceremony so Mary was the
[1:36:47] Bride of Joseph but even though she was
[1:36:51] was the
[1:36:52] bride she was his wife so what was the
[1:36:55] bride under Jewish
[1:36:58] tradition the bride was the
[1:37:01] wife adorning herself preparing her
[1:37:05] wedding
[1:37:07] garments for that for that day that
[1:37:10] wedding day that wedding
[1:37:14] ceremony where the husband the
[1:37:16] bridegroom would
[1:37:18] come and catch her away
[1:37:22] to supper of the
[1:37:24] Lamb the types the shadows of it
[1:37:27] here
[1:37:29] so when Mary was found with
[1:37:33] child then Jose the Bible says
[1:37:37] Joseph felt he had to put her
[1:37:42] away divorce her how could he divorce
[1:37:47] her if she wasn't considered his
[1:37:50] wife she was considered his
[1:37:53] wife but because he's a just man the
[1:37:56] Bible
[1:37:57] says he had planned to put her away
[1:38:04] privately that
[1:38:06] circumstance Joseph's
[1:38:08] wife
[1:38:10] Mary they were thinking she had
[1:38:12] committed
[1:38:14] fornication because prior to the wedding
[1:38:19] day she had given away her virginity to
[1:38:22] another
[1:38:24] man so under that
[1:38:27] circumstance Joseph could not only
[1:38:30] divorce Mary and put her
[1:38:34] away but he could also M take to himself
[1:38:37] another wife
[1:38:40] immediately that was the
[1:38:43] fornication that Jesus was talking to
[1:38:45] the Jewish men
[1:38:48] about and for that reason
[1:38:51] you could put your wife
[1:38:55] away now you can still put your wife
[1:38:59] away or your husband for any
[1:39:02] reason because the big question is
[1:39:05] today if you're a
[1:39:08] Believer can I remarry
[1:39:11] now and will God recognize
[1:39:15] that will I be still considered
[1:39:19] righteous and clean before
[1:39:23] side Jesus gave them one
[1:39:26] reason if the wife commits
[1:39:31] fornication which means that before the
[1:39:34] wedding
[1:39:35] day that this woman who took a
[1:39:40] vow gives her virginity to another
[1:39:43] man and is found with child with another
[1:39:47] man then her
[1:39:49] husband has has a right to put her
[1:39:54] away and marry
[1:39:56] another
[1:39:58] one
[1:40:01] reason why a
[1:40:04] Believer because the unbeliever don't
[1:40:07] care they most of them don't even marry
[1:40:12] today they just live in in they just
[1:40:17] live as
[1:40:19] prostitutes and hor
[1:40:30] mongers they're harsh
[1:40:33] words but it's
[1:40:36] true only the
[1:40:39] believer wants to
[1:40:41] know the
[1:40:43] details of how
[1:40:46] God wants us to live to line up to truth
[1:40:52] because the end result
[1:40:56] will as Jesus
[1:40:59] said be ye therefore
[1:41:03] perfect even as my Father which is in
[1:41:07] heaven is
[1:41:08] per and the
[1:41:11] believer in his
[1:41:13] heart he
[1:41:15] says that's what I want Lord Jesus where
[1:41:21] do I
[1:41:23] start where do I start throwing all the
[1:41:27] garbage out of my
[1:41:30] Life Cleanse me
[1:41:33] Lord make me
[1:41:35] whole give me a born again
[1:41:38] experience baptize me with the Holy
[1:41:41] Ghost and
[1:41:43] Fire change
[1:41:45] me because remember Isaiah
[1:41:48] 40 what was the ministry of John the
[1:41:50] Baptist is going to
[1:41:52] bring what did Isaiah
[1:41:55] prophesy five things that would
[1:41:59] come that when the first seal
[1:42:02] opened five
[1:42:04] things
[1:42:06] change change change change
[1:42:10] change as we stand to our
[1:42:19] feet and as we
[1:42:21] pray I
[1:42:25] ask is there something in your life
[1:42:29] in for which you want
[1:42:33] change because if there
[1:42:35] is change is
[1:42:37] available change is
[1:42:39] available let's pray Heavenly Father we
[1:42:43] thank you for this first
