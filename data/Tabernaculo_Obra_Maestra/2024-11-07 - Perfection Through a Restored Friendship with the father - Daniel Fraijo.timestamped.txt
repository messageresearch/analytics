[14:05] tonight we'd like to read from the word
[14:07] of
[14:09] God and uh we'll begin reading in
[14:14] Matthew
[14:22] 13 Matthew
[14:25] 13 as a as a
[14:27] reminder how this gospel came to
[14:31] us how this Lamb's Book of Life came to
[14:36] us what was the style of Ministry of
[14:38] Jesus
[14:41] Christ why was it that
[14:43] way and how did God work it for our
[14:47] good Matthew
[14:49] 13 and verse
[14:52] 34 he says all these things spoke Jesus
[14:55] unto the multitude in Parables and
[14:57] without a parable spoke he not unto
[15:05] them that it might be fulfilled which
[15:07] was spoken by the prophet saying I will
[15:10] open my mouth in Parables I will utter
[15:13] things which have been kept secret from
[15:15] the foundation of the
[15:25] world Messiah King of the Jews
[15:30] the Lamb of
[15:31] God the prophets of the Old
[15:34] Testament had prophesied of him since
[15:37] the Book of
[15:39] Genesis and in the Book of
[15:42] Psalms D David
[15:45] prophesied of of his style of
[15:49] Ministry of the Lord
[15:52] Jesus and he said that it might be
[15:54] fulfilled verse 35 which was spoken by
[15:57] the prophet
[16:02] saying I will open my mouth in
[16:07] Parables that means he was going to
[16:09] speak in a
[16:12] mystery that means it was going to be a
[16:15] prophetic
[16:17] word but hidden to the to the eyes of
[16:20] the wise and
[16:22] prudent so so that he could reserve for
[16:25] his
[16:27] children a re
[16:31] reation that he could say
[16:33] father I thank you that you're hidden my
[16:37] words the eyes of the wise and
[16:41] prudent will reveal it unto
[16:44] babes such as would
[16:47] learn and again he was speaking in a
[16:50] parable he didn't mean babes
[16:54] natural he mean babes Supernatural
[17:00] Sons and
[17:01] Daughters those that could be born
[17:04] again to them he would reveal
[17:08] it he says and I will utter
[17:12] things everything that will come out of
[17:15] my
[17:16] mouth I will utter things which have
[17:19] been set secret from the foundation of
[17:21] the
[17:24] world I will utter
[17:26] things that at one time only only the
[17:29] ears of Adam have ever
[17:33] heard and I'll say it again to you
[17:36] now my word will not return
[17:40] void men and women that can live it that
[17:45] can speak it that will believe it that
[17:48] will hold to
[17:51] it Matthew 28
[17:59] now we
[18:01] know that everything that Jesus
[18:04] said in his Earthly
[18:06] Ministry in his Earth
[18:09] Ministry was a parable in other words it
[18:12] was a prophetic
[18:14] word and the words he was
[18:17] using were not
[18:19] literal they were
[18:21] symbolic of something that he was hiding
[18:25] from
[18:27] everyone except you
[18:29] you he wanted you to know
[18:33] it but not through
[18:35] education through
[18:38] Revelation Matthew
[18:41] 28 verse
[18:43] 18 as you remember this chapter starts
[18:47] off there at the end of the Sabbath
[18:51] day and Mary Magdalene and the other
[18:54] Mary came to the Seiler
[18:57] magd and while they're there there's a
[18:59] great
[19:01] earthquake and the earthquake was that
[19:03] the angel of the Lord had descended
[19:07] down and he rolled back the
[19:11] stone and there was a resurrection that
[19:13] took
[19:15] place Jesus rose that moment
[19:19] that and he said to the women fear
[19:24] not it is I so the angel told told him
[19:30] he is
[19:31] risen and tonight I can tell
[19:34] you he is
[19:36] risen beginning at Verse
[19:39] 18 and Jesus came and spake unto them
[19:42] saying all power is given unto me in
[19:45] heaven and in
[19:51] Earth all
[19:53] power so he says so go ye therefore and
[19:57] teach All Nations baptizing in the name
[20:00] baptizing them in the name of the father
[20:02] and of the son and of the Holy
[20:11] Ghost Jesus said it do you believe it
[20:16] and will you follow
[20:17] it and yet it wasn't a
[20:20] parable and without a
[20:23] revelation you'll you'll stay with the
[20:27] symbols but you won't won
[20:29] grow you'll be baptized in
[20:33] titles but you won't be born
[20:35] again you won't go from poor in
[20:40] spirit unto
[20:42] Perfection you may start the
[20:45] journey
[20:47] absolutely but without a
[20:50] revelation you might be justified by
[20:54] faith you might even be Sanctified by
[20:58] the spirit
[21:01] but without
[21:02] Revelation you can't go
[21:05] further into a restored friendship with
[21:08] the
[21:09] father there's got to be a
[21:13] revelation of this book called The
[21:16] Bible or else this message
[21:20] movement will just be another
[21:23] denomination or else you and I will just
[21:27] become denominational
[21:31] minded without
[21:33] revelation will hold to the
[21:37] symbols but this but we won't know what
[21:39] they
[21:41] represent won't change our
[21:43] lives but the revealed
[21:46] word that changes our
[21:48] lives for the revealed
[21:51] word is a personal
[21:54] experience holy
[21:57] spirit amen
[22:02] verse 19
[22:04] again go you therefore and teach All
[22:06] Nations baptize them in the name of the
[22:09] father and of the son and of the Holy
[22:17] Ghost and without
[22:19] revelation we
[22:21] say I'd rather do what Jesus
[22:26] said than what Peter said
[22:29] a backslid
[22:32] fisherman who denied my Jesus three
[22:40] times without
[22:42] Revelation that's the thought verse
[22:46] 20 teaching them to observe all things
[22:49] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo
[22:51] I'm with you always even until the end
[22:54] of the world Amen
[23:05] and how did Jesus speak
[23:07] it what was his style of
[23:10] ministry thus saith the prophets of
[23:14] old he speak in
[23:16] Parables and in Parables he'll utter
[23:20] things that have been hidden since the
[23:22] foundation of the
[23:24] world he bring through to us things
[23:28] that he wanted Adam to to
[23:32] fulfill and Adam didn't the first
[23:35] Adam but the second Adam
[23:38] did because of what the second Adam did
[23:40] for
[23:42] us he was a man that could take God at
[23:45] his
[23:47] word now in Christ we can also take him
[23:51] at his
[23:52] word faith
[23:54] believing on the finished
[23:57] work on the price of the blood that he
[23:59] paid for
[24:02] us so Acts 2 acts 289 18 to
[24:10] 20 excuse me Matthew
[24:14] 28 verse 18 to
[24:16] 20 was once again Jesus speaking in a
[24:22] parable and the words that we all
[24:26] understand father son
[24:29] Holy Ghost were
[24:32] symbolic he hid it in the eyes of the
[24:35] wise and
[24:37] PR but in Acts
[24:40] 238 he raised up another
[24:43] Prophet an
[24:46] apostle the Apostle
[24:50] Peter beginning at verse
[24:56] 36 Acts 2 and
[25:05] 36 therefore let all the house of Israel
[25:09] know assuredly that God had made that
[25:12] same Jesus whom ye crucified both Lord
[25:15] and Christ it's not acts right uh Acts
[25:18] 2:36
[25:34] now when they heard this they were
[25:36] pricked in their heart and said unto
[25:38] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[25:40] men and Brethren what shall we
[25:47] do let's read 36
[25:50] again remember it's the day of
[25:54] Pentecost 120 had descended from an
[25:57] upper room
[26:00] pour out into the streets of
[26:04] Jerusalem and they begin to speak in
[26:07] tongues tongues of fire were upon
[26:11] them and the Bible says that all that
[26:15] heard
[26:16] them heard them
[26:19] speaking in their native
[26:22] languages because there was people from
[26:24] all over the world there in Jerusalem
[26:28] spoke hundreds of different
[26:31] dialects it wasn't a day of
[26:34] confusion it was a day when
[26:38] everyone heard these men
[26:43] speaking in a tongue that they
[26:46] understood and they were
[26:48] shocked because it was their native
[26:51] dialect from far away lands where they
[26:54] had
[26:55] come it wasn't a time of confusion
[26:59] it wasn't just bring dragging someone to
[27:01] the front and shaking them to make him
[27:02] speak in
[27:06] tongues and then there's no
[27:09] message no no this was the power of God
[27:12] that fell
[27:14] down this was the a
[27:17] restoration of what the prophet Joel had
[27:21] spoken verse
[27:23] 36 therefore let all the house of Israel
[27:26] know assuredly
[27:30] that God had made that same
[27:34] Jesus listen to this whom ye
[27:38] crucified Peter is
[27:40] speaking to a crowd of people that had
[27:45] gathered and in that crowd of
[27:48] people were men and
[27:51] women who that day before Pontius
[27:56] Pilate before that Jud judgement Hall
[28:01] tribunal they were
[28:04] screaming along with the high
[28:07] priest of
[28:08] Israel crucify
[28:11] him and Peter discerned the
[28:14] hearts that multitude of people
[28:17] there that's why when he said therefore
[28:21] let all the house of Israel know
[28:22] assuredly that God had made that same
[28:25] Jesus
[28:30] and the word a discerner of the
[28:35] hearts whom ye
[28:38] crucified made him both Lord and
[28:42] Christ now when they heard this they
[28:45] knew they were
[28:47] guilty and they were pricked in their
[28:51] heart and they said unto Peter and to
[28:54] the rest of the
[28:55] Apostles men and brethren
[28:58] you know we were part of that
[29:02] crowd you know we were part of that
[29:06] church that
[29:08] screamed to Pontius pilot that Roman
[29:12] Governor when he said who will I give
[29:15] you
[29:16] Jesus or
[29:19] Barabas and I and we
[29:22] screamed crucify Jesus
[29:28] and now the Holy Spirit has convicted
[29:32] them and they're
[29:34] saying what shall we do now did we go
[29:38] too far is it too late what will we do
[29:42] now then Peter said unto
[29:45] them it's too late for your
[29:50] kind no he didn't say
[29:54] that and yet they were they had screamed
[29:57] crucified one
[30:00] time but in that crowd that screamed
[30:04] crucified he knew there were Sons and
[30:07] Daughters of
[30:08] God that had gotten caught up with that
[30:13] system with that
[30:15] denomination with w w with with that
[30:18] nian
[30:20] spirit and Peter said to the Sons and
[30:24] Daughters of
[30:25] God who were poor in spirit
[30:29] he said
[30:30] repent what you've done wrong what
[30:33] you've said wrong the the the the the
[30:36] wrong way you've treated
[30:39] people just
[30:41] repent and be
[30:43] baptized every one of you in the name of
[30:45] Jesus
[30:46] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[30:50] receive the gift of the Holy
[30:53] Ghost let's pray Heavenly Father we
[30:57] thank you once again again add your
[30:59] blessings to your
[31:00] word in Jesus name amen you may be
[31:14] seated we left off in the last
[31:18] service and I think the last statement
[31:20] we
[31:23] made from the book of Acts
[31:28] acts
[31:30] 238 repent and be baptized in the name
[31:32] of the Lord Jesus
[31:36] Christ and you will see the hand of God
[31:39] working in your
[31:41] life every step of the way as long as
[31:44] you give him full
[31:48] control but anytime you turn away from
[31:50] God's
[31:53] word then your life and
[31:55] mine will go out of control
[32:00] you walk out from the
[32:02] protection of the Holy Spirit his
[32:06] word you you no longer give almighty God
[32:11] for
[32:12] [Music]
[32:14] control then your life will spin out of
[32:17] control there Comes A Time in this
[32:21] character building
[32:24] process and at any time we can walk away
[32:27] from it
[32:30] grieve the Holy
[32:32] Spirit
[32:34] but then there Comes A Time in this
[32:37] character building
[32:40] process the hunger and thirst for
[32:44] righteousness
[32:46] meekness to be a
[32:48] peacemaker to be pure of heart to be
[32:53] merciful for this is the attitude of men
[32:55] and women
[32:58] young and
[32:59] old if they have begun this character
[33:02] building
[33:05] process unto
[33:08] Perfection those that are looking to be
[33:12] changed the holy spirit is impressing
[33:14] upon their
[33:17] hearts we seek
[33:19] conso we seek
[33:21] prayer we don't hide our
[33:24] iniquity but we put it before God
[33:28] as the scripture says be not as
[33:31] Adam who hid his
[33:34] iniquity Matthew

[34:11] Perfection how to get there the Little
[34:14] Steps we're going to

[34:19] started and where he wants to take each
[34:21] and every one of
[34:22] us back into his
[34:25] presence in verse 13 of Matthew 5
[34:29] he says you are the salt of the
[34:32] earth but if the salt has lost its
[34:38] Savor if you pull away from
[34:43] God if you if you walk away from his
[34:47] presence if you stop reading your
[34:51] Bible if you stop
[34:53] praying you've lost your savior
[34:59] you are the salt of the
[35:02] earth but if the salt has lost its
[35:06] Savor wherefore shall it be
[35:10] salted in other words if you walk away
[35:13] from
[35:14] God how can you walk with him
[35:18] anymore he says it is therefore then
[35:20] good for
[35:22] nothing but to be cast out and to be
[35:26] trotten under foot of man
[35:30] how do we lose our
[35:34] Savor once we started this
[35:38] walk we
[35:40] repented we were baptized in the name of
[35:42] Jesus
[35:44] Christ now you're the salt of the
[35:47] earth but what if you lose your
[35:53] savior what takes

[36:58] as I have also told you in time
[37:01] past that they which do such
[37:05] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[37:11] God Matthew
[37:14] 5:14 Jesus
[37:18] speaking of how to go from porn
[37:22] spirit all the way to be
[37:24] perfect as Our Father which is in heaven
[37:27] is perfect
[37:30] ye are the light of the world a city
[37:32] that is set on a hill cannot be
[37:40] hid ye are the light of the
[37:47] world it's a great
[37:49] thing what a
[37:51] calling to be called to be a light of
[37:54] the
[37:56] world verse
[37:58] 15 he says neither do men light a
[38:03] candle and put it under a
[38:07] bushel this is a small
[38:10] light but it's a light neither do men
[38:13] light a candle and put it under a bushel
[38:15] but on a
[38:20] Candlestick and it give it light light
[38:23] unto all that are in the house
[38:31] that's the that's that's the children in
[38:32] the
[38:34] home that's the sons in the
[38:36] home that's the daughter in the
[38:39] home that's in our
[38:42] home is we're where
[38:44] Jesus speaking on
[38:47] Perfection is asking
[38:49] you be a
[38:51] light first be a light in your home
[38:57] before you try to be a
[39:00] light all over the
[39:03] world
[39:05] first have a
[39:07] testimony that your life is a light onto
[39:12] your
[39:19] house verse
[39:25] 15 verse 16
[39:28] let your light so shine before
[39:34] men that they may see your good
[39:38] works the light
[39:41] here has a
[39:44] manifestation of good
[39:46] works and yet we don't live by
[39:50] works but our works are just an
[39:55] expression of what God is doing in our
[39:58] lives let your light so shine before
[40:03] men that they may see your good
[40:06] works and glorify your father which is
[40:08] in
[40:11] heaven Jesus is telling
[40:13] us this Christian
[40:16] walk is out is about being
[40:20] Epistles read of all men
[40:27] if you believe your light is shining
[40:32] bright and no one sees your good
[40:36] works at home at work at church then who
[40:42] you think you
[40:44] are does not have the same outward
[40:48] expression and you must ask yourself
[40:52] have I really been born
[40:54] again have I got that Holy Ghost
[40:58] that urges
[41:00] me to do
[41:03] good and to do good starting first in my
[41:08] home starting first with my
[41:11] family starting first with my wife Star
[41:14] first with my
[41:19] husband the manifested
[41:22] light
[41:24] shows and it brings good works
[41:29] Matthew
[41:31] 5:17 Jesus
[41:32] says think not that I am come to destroy
[41:36] the law of the
[41:41] prophets I am not come to
[41:44] destroy but to
[41:46] fulfill for that was a
[41:48] shadow of things to
[41:54] come and and when prophecy is full
[41:58] fulfilled it becomes history and the
[42:02] Mana of a day
[42:04] pasted and
[42:06] man so what do we do now with the Old
[42:11] Testament fulfilled and passed we go on
[42:16] to
[42:18] Perfection through a restored
[42:21] friendship under a new
[42:23] covenant not under the blood of bulls
[42:26] and goats
[42:29] but under the blood of a better
[42:32] Covenant the blood of the Lamb of
[42:35] God oh what can wash away my
[42:39] sins nothing but the blood of
[42:42] Jesus what can take away the
[42:46] iniquity nothing but the blood of
[42:49] Jesus and when we are
[42:52] washed then Begins the friendship with
[42:54] the father
[42:57] then we then when we confess our
[43:05] shortcomings not when we
[43:08] say I know I make
[43:11] mistakes but Jonathan's worse than
[43:17] me did you catch that the spirit's
[43:20] flowing
[43:21] here yes no that's not
[43:25] repenting that's not being
[43:28] washed you haven't begun a friendship
[43:30] with the father
[43:33] yet then Jesus said be ye therefore
[43:38] perfect even as as Our Father which is
[43:41] in heaven is
[43:44] perfect and when you approach anybody on
[43:46] the topic of
[43:50] perfection they might
[43:52] smile but then they say we can't be
[43:58] perfect we can't be
[44:03] perfect Jesus used the word
[44:06] perfect it was part of the
[44:09] parable it's how he it's how he
[44:13] hid in the eyes of the wise and
[44:16] prudent where he really wanted to take
[44:19] us the Perfection that he was speaking
[44:23] of was to be eternal
[44:27] as he is
[44:29] eternal that's where he wants to take us
[44:33] back Perfection is our
[44:37] Capstone of a character building
[44:42] process that begins with you and
[44:45] I at the at the very lowest time in your
[44:51] life you remember that
[44:53] day when you were lost in sin perhaps
[44:58] lost in
[45:02] religion that day Jesus looked down from
[45:07] heaven saw
[45:09] you and he said
[45:13] blessed is that young man that
[45:17] girl though she's poor in
[45:21] spirit because I see an attribute there
[45:27] I see a
[45:29] daughter the woman at the
[45:31] well a
[45:34] prostitute Jesus saw something in
[45:38] her he saw a daughter he said I have a
[45:42] need to go to
[45:48] Samaria he sent his Apostles to go
[45:51] on go down and get us something to eat
[45:57] he was a
[45:58] Jew and he entered amongst the
[46:02] Samaritans the Jews had nothing to do
[46:04] with
[46:05] Samaritans but the father has everything
[46:08] to do with his
[46:10] children a father will never abandon his
[46:15] children he didn't abandon me he didn't
[46:18] abandon
[46:19] you oh love of God so rich and
[46:24] pure maybe may we be that kind of
[46:27] fathers that kind of mothers that kind
[46:30] of sons and
[46:32] daughters Matthew
[46:35] 5:18 for verely I say unto
[46:38] you till Heaven and Earth
[46:41] pass one jot or one t shall on no wise
[46:46] pass from the law till all be
[46:52] fulfilled and when was it
[46:55] fulfilled turn with me to St John
[46:58] chapter
[47:01] 19 beginning at verse
[47:10] 28
[47:12] John an
[47:16] eyewitness of the life of
[47:19] Jesus he says after this Jesus knowing
[47:22] that all things were now accomplished
[47:25] that the scripture might be f filled
[47:28] saith I
[47:38] thirst even the phrase I
[47:42] thirst had to be said on the cross of
[47:46] Calvary for it was thus sayth the
[47:49] Lord now there was set a vessel full of
[47:52] vinegar and they filled a sponge with
[47:54] vinegar and put it upon his up and put
[47:57] it to his
[48:08] mouth now when Jesus therefore had
[48:11] received the vinegar he said it's
[48:13] finished and he bowed his head and gave
[48:16] up the
[48:22] ghost God needed a
[48:25] man that would take him at his
[48:28] word the first Adam couldn't do
[48:31] it but the second Adam
[48:34] did and here he was on the cross of
[48:39] Calvary and he said it's
[48:42] finished the work of
[48:44] redemption the price has been
[48:47] paid oh Rejoice
[48:51] church for the price of your
[48:54] salvation the price of your deliverance
[48:57] the price for the joy of your
[49:00] salvation the price has been
[49:03] paid in Matthew
[49:05] 19 now he's speaking to the
[49:09] ministry and he says
[49:11] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[49:13] these least
[49:17] Commandments and shall teach men
[49:20] so he shall be called the least in the
[49:23] Kingdom of
[49:25] Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach
[49:29] them the same Shall be Called
[49:32] great in the Kingdom of
[49:35] Heaven he was talking to the
[49:38] teachers he was talking to the
[49:42] ministers let's read it again whosoever
[49:45] therefore shall break one of these these
[49:51] Commandments it's one thing to break a
[49:53] commandment
[49:56] another level to teach people to break
[49:59] his
[50:02] Commandments he's talking to the
[50:04] teachers
[50:05] now who will pay the greater
[50:09] Price He says and and those that teach
[50:13] men
[50:15] so he shall be called the least in the
[50:19] Kingdom of
[50:22] Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach
[50:25] them the same Shall be Called great in
[50:27] the Kingdom of
[50:31] Heaven Matthew 5 and verse
[50:34] 20 now he's speaking to the lay
[50:39] member in verse
[50:41] 20 he says for I say unto
[50:44] you ex that except your righteousness
[50:47] shall exceed the righteousness of the
[50:49] scribes and
[50:52] Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into
[50:55] the kingdom of
[50:59] Heaven because their
[51:02] righteousness was self
[51:05] righteous but the righteousness that
[51:07] exceeds
[51:10] this is you
[51:12] accept Jesus Christ as your personal
[51:16] savior he became your
[51:19] sin so that you and I can be a
[51:24] partaker his righteousness
[51:34] for I say unto you that except your
[51:36] righteousness shall exceed the
[51:38] righteousness of the scribes and
[51:40] Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[51:43] into the kingdom of
[51:50] God and now the Lord
[51:52] Jesus he took the your discipleship
[51:59] to a Next
[52:00] Level other words don't just discuss
[52:04] it but be the light of the
[52:07] world let your light
[52:10] shine brother Daniel do you mean obey
[52:13] all Ten
[52:16] Commandments I mean more than
[52:19] that the Bride of Jesus
[52:22] Christ is called to go beyond
[52:27] thou sht not kill the bride of Jesus
[52:30] Christ is called to go
[52:33] beyond th shall not commit
[52:36] adultery it's greater
[52:39] today now here's Paul
[52:42] speaking on
[52:44] Perfection adding more
[52:46] detail to Perfection through a restored
[52:50] friendship Hebrews chapter
[52:53] 7 and verse 18
[52:58] the Apostle Paul speaking to the
[53:04] Hebrews men who were well studied in the
[53:10] law men who held the Ten Commandments in
[53:13] high
[53:18] esteem he says here in verse 18 of
[53:21] Hebrews
[53:24] 7 for there is for there is verely a
[53:30] disannulling in other words a
[53:33] cancelling of the
[53:35] Commandment going before for the
[53:39] weakness and unprofitableness
[53:43] thereof in other words Ten Commandments
[53:47] would be
[53:49] cancelled because we're born in sin
[53:52] we're shaped in
[53:55] iniquity that's the weak
[53:59] link that keeps us from living Ten
[54:04] Commandments it's we're the
[54:09] weakling we're the weak
[54:12] Ling that's why we must be born
[54:18] again but brother
[54:21] Daniel what's wrong with Thou shalt not
[54:24] kill Thou shalt not commit adulter
[54:27] should not cover thy neighbor's house
[54:29] and
[54:30] home verse
[54:33] 19 for the law made nothing
[54:37] perfect for the law made nothing
[54:41] perfect but the bringing in of a better
[54:43] hope
[54:49] did by the which we draw nigh unto
[54:53] God when there is a dis ing of the law
[54:58] in your
[55:03] life then your tutorship
[55:08] begins your
[55:12] discipleship just went to the next level
[55:14] in
[55:16] Christ when you get to this
[55:19] level you've come a long way from
[55:22] blessed are the porn
[55:25] spirits blessed are they that
[55:28] mourn watch now here is a higher
[55:32] level of
[55:34] Christianity of
[55:36] Holiness no legal no
[55:40] legalism
[55:41] instead
[55:43] Perfection through a restored friendship
[55:46] with the
[55:47] father that's where we want to
[55:50] live like Abraham who was called to a
[55:53] friend of God
[55:56] not even a
[55:58] servant not even a high
[56:00] priest a
[56:04] friend Matthew 5 and verse
[56:09] 21 ye have heard that it was said by
[56:12] them of old
[56:15] time did you hear the way he said Jes
[56:18] this is remember this is Jesus speaking
[56:21] and he's speaking in a
[56:23] parable so it symbols the word he
[56:27] using it's a Myster he unfolding to
[56:30] us have heard that was said by them of
[56:33] old
[56:37] time I thought I thought Ten
[56:40] Commandments was thus sayith the Lord
[56:42] but the
[56:44] Daniel no it was a
[56:47] proverb that would be enough that would
[56:49] be
[56:51] disan will be
[56:53] canell for a better hope
[56:57] ye have heard that it was said by them
[56:59] of old
[57:02] time like Moses and the
[57:06] Levites Thou shalt not
[57:09] kill and whosoever shall kill shall be
[57:12] in danger of the
[57:16] Judgment God gave men of old
[57:20] time a proverb that they could repeat to
[57:24] others but them of old
[57:27] time added to the
[57:29] proverb what they
[57:31] felt was was just a justifiable reason
[57:35] to
[57:37] kill under the
[57:40] law the Commandment was
[57:42] given thou sh not
[57:46] kill but
[57:48] Israel and Men of
[57:50] old they said I believe
[57:53] that but
[57:58] but if that
[58:00] man steals my
[58:04] cow the only way I can stop
[58:07] him is to kill him so that kind of
[58:11] killing that's
[58:14] different that's a different kind of
[58:17] killing that's
[58:21] okay but the original proverb and
[58:23] commandment
[58:26] was Thou shalt not
[58:28] kill it had a
[58:31] period so no one could keep
[58:34] it no one could fulfill
[58:37] it what do we
[58:44] do God gave men of
[58:47] old this
[58:49] proverb and they repeated it to
[58:51] themselves and
[58:53] others but those of old time
[58:57] added to all of these Ten
[59:01] Commandments what they felt was a good
[59:04] reason to
[59:05] kill what they felt was a good reason to
[59:09] divorce their
[59:12] wies making the Commandment of no
[59:17] effect and thus the Jews the Jewish book
[59:20] called the
[59:23] Torah expanded
[59:27] and and
[59:28] expanded and
[59:30] added and added Dogma after Dogma until
[59:36] when Jesus arrived on the
[59:39] scene and they had turned the house of
[59:42] God into a den of
[59:45] Thieves and completely
[59:48] blinded and it was the
[59:51] blind leading the
[59:53] blind when Jesus arrived
[59:56] that was a condition of the
[59:59] church what else was the condition of
[1:00:01] the
[1:00:02] church Jesus said how
[1:00:08] often as a hen gathers her
[1:00:14] brood I've tried to gather
[1:00:18] you he said something with that
[1:00:21] statement he
[1:00:23] said now that I'm here with you
[1:00:27] you've turned this house of
[1:00:29] God into another chicken
[1:00:32] yard you realize God compared himself to
[1:00:36] a
[1:00:38] h Jehovah
[1:00:41] H and he made that
[1:00:44] comparison because of the condition of
[1:00:46] the hearts of the
[1:00:49] people the
[1:00:51] ministry the leaders the preachers
[1:00:55] pastor
[1:00:58] the prophets and
[1:01:01] apostles where they had fallen
[1:01:04] to Matthew
[1:01:07] 157
[1:01:10] Jesus speaking on
[1:01:13] Perfection how do we
[1:01:16] arrive he said ye
[1:01:18] Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of
[1:01:21] you
[1:01:24] saying this people people draweth nigh
[1:01:27] unto me with their mouth and honor me
[1:01:30] with their lips but their heart is far
[1:01:32] from
[1:01:37] me every Revival that God's ever
[1:01:40] brought it's come to this place and to
[1:01:44] this
[1:01:45] point but yet in the midst of this
[1:01:47] falling
[1:01:51] away in the midst of this falling away
[1:01:55] in
[1:01:58] there is a
[1:02:00] Remnant there is a mystical body of
[1:02:02] Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ this people draweth nigh unto me
[1:02:08] with their mouth and honor me with their
[1:02:09] lips but their heart is far from
[1:02:16] me but in vain do they worship
[1:02:19] me teaching for doctrines the
[1:02:21] Commandments of men
[1:02:26] these statements were written over over
[1:02:28] 2200 years
[1:02:31] ago and they perfect identifying the day
[1:02:35] we're living
[1:02:36] [Music]
[1:02:38] today verse 10 and he called the
[1:02:42] multitude and said unto them hear and
[1:02:50] understand not that which goeth into the
[1:02:53] mouth defile a man
[1:02:57] but that which cometh out of the
[1:02:59] mouth this defileth a
[1:03:06] man then came his disciples and said
[1:03:09] unto
[1:03:11] him knowest
[1:03:13] thou that the Pharisees were
[1:03:17] offended after they heard this
[1:03:20] saying don't you know that the way you
[1:03:23] preach is offending ministers
[1:03:29] Apostles prophets teachers
[1:03:33] evangelist don't you know it's offensive
[1:03:35] the way you're saying and
[1:03:39] preaching but he answered and
[1:03:44] said he didn't respond to what they
[1:03:48] said
[1:03:50] carnally but supernaturally and
[1:03:52] spiritually
[1:03:57] when they told him don't you know that
[1:04:01] the Pharisees are
[1:04:03] offended that the teachers of Israel are
[1:04:07] offended the high priests and Levites
[1:04:09] are
[1:04:11] offended verse 13 but he answered and
[1:04:16] said every

[1:05:04] refilling of that Holy

[1:06:18] errors man who had hid his
[1:06:22] iniquities and yet a son of God
[1:06:25] [Music]

[1:06:29] Spirit when the word came to
[1:06:32] him and spoke to him of a great
[1:06:36] error and of how and how wicked men
[1:06:39] would
[1:06:40] act and the prophet said
[1:06:43] David what would you do with this kind
[1:06:45] of a
[1:06:46] man who would take one little lamb from
[1:06:49] a
[1:06:52] man when he had hundreds
[1:06:57] David said and as I mentioned I don't
[1:07:01] doubt when he said it he put his hand on
[1:07:02] his
[1:07:04] sword he said that man is worthy of
[1:07:07] death he should have never done that how
[1:07:11] dare him be so
[1:07:13] abusive and the prophet looked him in
[1:07:15] the face and he said David you're that
[1:07:20] man and it struck
[1:07:23] him revelation

[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:30] iniquity and he

[1:09:35] gladness that the bones which thou has
[1:09:38] broken May
