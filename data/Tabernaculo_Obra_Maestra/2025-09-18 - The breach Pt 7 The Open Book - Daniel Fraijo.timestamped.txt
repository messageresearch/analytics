[41:01] "And we'll meet them all in the air,
[41:05] and Jesus will be present
[41:08] to take us to the wedding supper of the
[41:10] lamb."
[41:14] And guess

[42:19] it's more for young men,
[42:22] &gt;&gt; but God has called this old man to go.
[42:24] So,
[42:27] so we certainly appreciate all your
[42:28] prayers.
[42:31] As we stand tonight
[42:35] for the reading of God's word,
[42:38] we're continuing
[42:41] &gt;&gt; in uh the breach.
[42:44] part seven
[42:45] &gt;&gt; and the subject
[42:48] the the open book.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Turn with me in Genesis chapter 3
[42:56] and verse 23.
[42:59] A breach occurred in the beginning.
[43:03] A code of conduct had been broken.
[43:07] And when it was God's son and God's
[43:10] daughter,
[43:12] God had to apply his word to them.
[43:16] He said, "In the day that you eat of
[43:18] that tree,
[43:20] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[43:22] evil,
[43:25] that day you'll surely die."
[43:28] And and it will and it will break a
[43:31] friendship
[43:33] that I have with you.
[43:35] it it it it will cancel a tutorship that
[43:38] I was tutoring you with.
[43:43] And when the breach occurred
[43:45] just as God said he would do,
[43:49] he did it. Genesis 3 and verse 22.
[43:54] He says, "And the Lord God said, behold,
[43:56] the man is become as one of us."
[44:02] So man had a choice.
[44:06] That's what this is telling us.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; God made him a free moral agent
[44:14] to make a choice
[44:17] between two things. And then God tells
[44:19] us the choice he made to know good and
[44:24] evil.
[44:26] That's what Adam chose. That's what Eve
[44:28] chose.
[44:30] And now lest he put forth his hand
[44:36] and take also of the tree of life and
[44:38] eat and live forever.
[44:43] God said, "I won't let my children live.
[44:47] I won't let them live in sin."
[44:51] And partake of this tree of life also.
[44:55] He says um so he so so he said in verse
[44:58] 23 says
[45:01] &gt;&gt; therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[45:03] from the garden of Eden
[45:06] &gt;&gt; to till the ground from whence he was
[45:09] taken.
[45:12] So he drove out the man
[45:14] and he placed at the east of go of of
[45:17] the garden of Eden cherubims.
[45:22] I believe it was the same seven angels
[45:26] that appeared on Sunset Mountain.
[45:30] For the ones on Sunset Mountain
[45:34] caught a prophet up
[45:37] in that constellation
[45:39] and they told him, "Go back to go back
[45:41] east
[45:43] and we're going to give you the
[45:45] revelation,
[45:47] the seven parts of redemption.
[45:51] These were the angels that were going to
[45:54] open the book.
[45:56] So if Jesus Christ is the same
[45:57] yesterday, today, and forever,
[46:01] then I believe they're the same ones
[46:02] that closed it at the beginning
[46:06] because God is unchanging in all his
[46:08] ways.
[46:10] He says, "So he drove out the man
[46:14] and he placed at the east of the Garden
[46:16] of Eden cherubims.
[46:20] more than one, seven,
[46:23] and a flaming sword.
[46:25] But the sword was only one
[46:28] which turned every way
[46:31] to keep the way of the tree of life.
[46:35] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank
[46:39] you for opening,
[46:41] this book, this book of redemption,
[46:45] this book of salvation,
[46:48] this book of healing virtue,
[46:51] th this plan that makes us a new
[46:53] creation
[46:56] if we'll surrender our lives
[46:59] to the author of this book,
[47:02] you the Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:05] Amen.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Revelations 5
[47:14] 1-3
[47:16] is the vision in symbol form
[47:21] of how the throne of God stood
[47:25] immediately after the fall of man.
[47:29] Revelations 5 was the was the vision.
[47:33] But Genesis 3
[47:35] &gt;&gt; was where John was looking to
[47:39] &gt;&gt; and what he saw when God opened it up to
[47:43] him,
[47:45] when God let him see some of what Moses
[47:48] had seen.
[47:51] And when he looked back all the way to
[47:53] Eden in a vision,
[47:56] that's when he saw what he wrote
[48:00] in Revelations 5:1.
[48:02] And I saw on the right hand of him that
[48:04] sat on the throne.
[48:08] That throne back in Eden,
[48:11] that throne back in Genesis, you say
[48:14] that was a throne.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; It was a judgment throne. And he was
[48:18] judging his children. He was judging the
[48:21] serpent. And I saw on the right hand of
[48:24] him
[48:27] that was back in Eden
[48:30] that sat on a throne and a book written
[48:33] within.
[48:35] And on the backside I saw it sealed with
[48:37] seven seals.
[48:40] John was looking back. God had opened
[48:43] his eyes
[48:45] to see that day in Genesis 3 when he put
[48:49] his children out of his presence. And I
[48:54] saw a strong angel verse two
[48:57] proclaiming with a loud voice.
[49:00] It was God now changing forms,
[49:04] descending, coming lower
[49:07] to get closer to you and I.
[49:10] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[49:12] with a loud voice,
[49:15] who was who is worthy to open the book
[49:19] and to loose the seals thereof
[49:22] to open this plan of redemption.
[49:25] There is the throne of God. And now it
[49:28] sat for 4,000 years of man's existence,
[49:34] waiting for a worthy one
[49:37] to to open the book,
[49:40] to open the plan of redemption
[49:43] that was in the mind of God before the
[49:46] foundation of the world.
[49:49] his plan to save you and I,
[49:52] knowing that that what we would do,
[49:55] knowing that we would make the wrong
[49:57] choices.
[49:59] And yet in his mind was a plan to save
[50:04] you to redeem you to give you overcoming
[50:07] power. And that plan was in mind before
[50:10] the foundation of the world.
[50:14] Verse three, it says, "And no man in
[50:17] heaven nor in earth, neither under the
[50:19] earth
[50:22] was able to open the book, neither to
[50:25] look thereon."
[50:28] And John stopped for a minute.
[50:31] The vision broke.
[50:34] He come back to earth for a second.
[50:37] And when he did, he said, "And I wept
[50:40] much
[50:41] when I fell out from under that
[50:42] anointing.
[50:45] When the vision broke before me,
[50:48] &gt;&gt; when I wasn't seeing anything else, oh,
[50:52] he said, I wept because of what I did
[50:54] see,
[50:56] because no man was found worthy to open
[51:00] and to read the book,
[51:02] neither to look thereon.
[51:06] Even as John is seeing this vision
[51:10] and weeping at what he's seeing and
[51:13] hearing a strong angel proclaiming
[51:17] with a loud voice,
[51:19] who is worthy to open the book
[51:23] and the angel made this proclamation
[51:27] looking for 4,000 years.
[51:32] And John says, "And no man in heaven
[51:36] nor in earth,
[51:38] neither under the earth.
[51:40] John in the vision was watching this
[51:42] angel,
[51:45] watching him look,
[51:47] watching him reject Moses,
[51:49] watching him reject Abraham,
[51:52] watching him reject David,
[51:54] watching him reject prophet after
[51:57] prophet.
[51:59] Check. No. No. Not worthy. Not worthy.
[52:02] Not worthy.
[52:04] man who John thought surely this one is
[52:07] worthy.
[52:10] Surely it's Abraham.
[52:12] Surely it's Moses.
[52:15] Surely it's Zerabel.
[52:18] Oh, why couldn't it be Samuel?
[52:21] Maybe Malachi.
[52:25] And he and he and he saw God reject them
[52:28] all. No. No.
[52:31] No man in heaven,
[52:34] nor in the earth,
[52:36] &gt;&gt; neither under the earth.
[52:40] No man in heaven,
[52:43] no man who had died and gone
[52:47] nor in the earth, no man who was still
[52:49] alive,
[52:51] neither under the earth. No one who had
[52:55] just recently died
[52:57] was able to open the book, neither to
[53:00] look thereon.
[53:02] But what John wasn't realizing
[53:06] that what he saw was past was history.
[53:11] It wasn't present
[53:13] nor was it future
[53:16] in the message. The breach
[53:19] paragraph 116.
[53:22] This is where I made this connection
[53:26] between Revelations 5 and Genesis 3. He
[53:30] says, "Now, oh my,
[53:34] the forfeited title deed
[53:39] is now in the hands of the original
[53:41] owner,
[53:44] Almighty God. The title deed to the
[53:47] earth and to eternal life."
[53:51] When Adam forfeited it,
[53:54] then Satan's dirty hands could not take
[53:56] it.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; So, it went back to its original owner.
[54:04] Oh, only someone with clean hands could
[54:07] handle this book.
[54:09] Only someone with clean with a clean
[54:11] heart could handle this book.
[54:14] Only someone with a clean life could
[54:16] take this book.
[54:20] that someone
[54:22] is Jesus Christ.
[54:24] And when he makes you a new creation,
[54:28] now that someone
[54:30] &gt;&gt; is you
[54:33] because he's given you a clean heart
[54:36] and clean hands because he has washed
[54:39] you with the blood of the lamb.
[54:43] So it went back to its original owner,
[54:47] God himself. He says, "We're going to
[54:49] find it in just a minute."
[54:52] There he sits on the throne with it in
[54:54] his hand.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; What throne?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, that throne back in Genesis.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; The title deed.
[55:05] Oh, that makes me feel religious,
[55:06] friends.
[55:08] The title deed to eternal life.
[55:12] The abstract title deed
[55:15] to eternal life. When Adam forfeited it
[55:18] for wisdom
[55:20] instead of faith, it went back to the
[55:23] hands of the owner.
[55:26] Almighty God, what a great thing.
[55:31] What's it doing? In the hands of God,
[55:35] God waiting for redemption claims.
[55:39] He made a way of redemption.
[55:42] He made a way back. Oh, and this morning
[55:45] he's still this evening he's still a
[55:48] redeemer.
[55:50] He's still making a way back tonight for
[55:52] his children.
[55:55] He made a way back
[55:58] and someday the redeemer
[56:00] is to take it back.
[56:02] Someday the redeemer
[56:05] will take back the earth.
[56:08] But before he takes back the earth,
[56:11] he's preparing you and I. He's taking us
[56:14] back.
[56:16] And when he takes us back,
[56:19] this world will follow
[56:22] a cleansing. Also,
[56:25] you see where we're getting to now?
[56:29] Then he says, "We'll watch this fella
[56:32] sitting upon the throne."
[56:37] So, what is Revelations 5
[56:40] 1-3? God waiting for the redeemer.
[56:44] And even as John is seeing
[56:48] this part of the vision,
[56:50] he he's weeping,
[56:52] not realizing that what he is seeing is
[56:55] history
[56:58] without a revelation.
[57:00] We'll read the Bible. We don't know if
[57:02] it's past. We don't know if it's
[57:05] present. We didn't know if it was
[57:07] future.
[57:09] But tonight,
[57:11] we're seen by the grace of God.
[57:14] We can live in the will of God.
[57:17] For we know this great plan of
[57:19] redemption.
[57:21] We've recognized our day. We've
[57:24] recognized our message. We've recognized
[57:27] our messenger,
[57:29] the Holy Spirit with us tonight.
[57:33] Redemption has come.
[57:37] He's done the work already.
[57:40] What John was seeing in those first
[57:42] three verses.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; It was even history
[57:48] for John when he was seeing it.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; It was Boaz.
[57:54] He had made redemption's claim
[57:59] on Naomi and Ruth.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; That's what was happening.
[58:04] For Boaz is Christ
[58:07] and Naomi represents a Jewish church
[58:11] and Ruth represents a Gentile church,
[58:15] the bride of Christ. In the book of
[58:18] Ruth,
[58:20] chapter 3 and verse 18,
[58:24] it reads like this.
[58:33] Then said she,
[58:36] [Music]
[58:37] "Sit still, my daughter,
[58:40] until thou know the matter how the
[58:43] matter will fall.
[58:47] For the man will not be in rest
[58:52] until he have finished the thing this
[58:54] day."
[58:57] Naomi,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; the the Jewish church,
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Ruth, Ruth,
[59:02] &gt;&gt; a gentile bride,
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Boaz,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Christ himself.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; He says, "For the man,
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ,
[59:12] &gt;&gt; will not rest until he has finished the
[59:16] thingless day."
[59:19] What day? That day on Calvary,
[59:23] what day? Those days he laid in the
[59:25] tomb.
[59:27] or his body did. What day? The day he
[59:31] rose again.
[59:33] He'll not rest until he's completed this
[59:36] work of redemption.
[59:39] He wouldn't rest until he's made a way
[59:42] back.
[59:45] Oh, through the sacrifice of his blood.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Second Peter 3:9,
[59:51] &gt;&gt; it says, "The Lord,"
[59:54] &gt;&gt; second Peter 3,
[59:56] and verse 9.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; The Lord is not slack.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Second Peter 3 and verse 9.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; The Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:00:12] promise.
[1:00:16] When the angel of the covenant
[1:00:18] descended
[1:00:20] looking for someone who was worthy to
[1:00:24] open the book and 4,000 years passed,
[1:00:30] the Lord wasn't slack.
[1:00:33] No, the Lord was waiting for you and I
[1:00:36] to be born on the face of this earth.
[1:00:39] No, he was patient.
[1:00:42] He was waiting for you and I. The Lord
[1:00:45] is not slack
[1:00:47] concerning his promise, as some men
[1:00:50] count slackness,
[1:00:53] but is longsuffering to us,
[1:00:56] not willing that any should perish,
[1:00:59] but that all should come to repentance.
[1:01:04] Why has God waited all these thousands
[1:01:06] of years?
[1:01:08] because not willing
[1:01:11] that any should perish, knowing that the
[1:01:14] sin of Adam and Eve
[1:01:16] and had now commit committed every son
[1:01:19] and daughter of God
[1:01:22] to bypass the spoken word
[1:01:26] to be born through a natural birth.
[1:01:30] So God has been patient.
[1:01:32] God has been long-suffering.
[1:01:35] Revelations 5 and5
[1:01:38] And one of the elders
[1:01:41] saith unto me,
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; God was patient,
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; waiting
[1:01:47] to become a man,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; a kinsman for you and me. And one of the
[1:01:53] elders saith unto me,
[1:01:56] weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe
[1:02:00] of Judah.
[1:02:03] The first three verses
[1:02:07] was history.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; And John couldn't see it. He didn't
[1:02:12] understand it. He had seen the vision.
[1:02:17] But God didn't give him the revelation
[1:02:18] of that vision.
[1:02:23] In verse five,
[1:02:25] he says, "Then one of the elders saith
[1:02:27] unto me,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe
[1:02:32] of Judah,
[1:02:35] the root of David have prevailed to open
[1:02:38] the book,
[1:02:40] and to loose the seven seals thereof."
[1:02:44] When John When John saw this,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; it was already history for John.
[1:02:51] But John had lived in this history
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:57] and the revelation wasn't coming yet.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; To have a vision that God gives you is
[1:03:04] one thing,
[1:03:07] but if God doesn't give you the
[1:03:08] revelation of it,
[1:03:12] that's something else.
[1:03:15] He can give you a vision,
[1:03:18] but maybe he won't give you the
[1:03:20] revelation.
[1:03:23] At that time,
[1:03:27] someone might say,
[1:03:29] "I thought the lamb
[1:03:32] first opened the book."
[1:03:34] No, no, no. It was the lion of the tribe
[1:03:38] of Judah who first opened
[1:03:43] this sevensealed book of redemption
[1:03:47] and the book that was being opened to
[1:03:49] Israel
[1:03:51] by the line of the tribe of Judah.
[1:03:54] The book represents
[1:03:57] the relationship
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; between you and God.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; The book represents represent
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; the friendship we lost.
[1:04:06] The book represents
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; the teaching and personal tutorship of
[1:04:11] the Holy Spirit.
[1:04:14] That's what this seven seal book
[1:04:16] represents for you and I.
[1:04:20] But the book also represents
[1:04:23] a son being asked of God.
[1:04:27] You have need
[1:04:29] of squirrels.
[1:04:31] Just speak it.
[1:04:34] What was it telling us?
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; The book was open
[1:04:39] and the friendship had been restored.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; The book was open and the personal
[1:04:45] teaching of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:47] has been restored
[1:04:51] and God asked the son again
[1:04:54] in the 20th century, "Your hunting,
[1:04:58] you have need of squirrels.
[1:05:01] Where would you like them?
[1:05:08] If you've ever had an experience
[1:05:12] where you're praying,
[1:05:14] you really needed a job.
[1:05:18] You say, "Lord,
[1:05:20] I need a job
[1:05:23] today."
[1:05:24] And God gave you a job
[1:05:27] today.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You know what you you know what you just
[1:05:30] experienced?
[1:05:32] A friendship has been restored with the
[1:05:34] father.
[1:05:38] A teaching and personal tutorship
[1:05:43] has begun.
[1:05:45] Go back and listen to that message.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; 1959,
[1:05:50] speak to this mountain.
[1:05:53] The Holy Spirit tells the prophet,
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; it's the beginning of your new ministry.
[1:06:01] But he was a type and a shadow
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; representing what God would do for every
[1:06:07] son and daughter in this day.
[1:06:12] He was a wave offering at harvest time.
[1:06:16] The first to have this experience,
[1:06:19] but he wouldn't be the last. Oh, someone
[1:06:23] tonight say, "I've had these
[1:06:25] experiences.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; I have, too.
[1:06:30] That's why we know it's real.
[1:06:33] When the magi came,
[1:06:36] they were following the star.
[1:06:39] That's what that's what we have done.
[1:06:42] We first began following this star,
[1:06:46] following this this messenger,
[1:06:49] following this prophetic manifestation.
[1:06:53] When the magi were following the star,
[1:06:57] which represents the messengers of the
[1:06:58] ages,
[1:07:00] which represents the forerunners
[1:07:03] at the first and second coming.
[1:07:06] And it entered and they entered into
[1:07:08] Jerusalem.
[1:07:10] And they couldn't see the star no more.
[1:07:13] But they thought, "But we're in
[1:07:14] Jerusalem,
[1:07:17] the holiest city in the world,
[1:07:20] the holiest people in the world.
[1:07:24] Surely this is where you'll be born.
[1:07:27] in this great city called Jerusalem.
[1:07:31] And they walked in and Matthew 2 and
[1:07:35] verse one tells us some of the story.
[1:07:39] Says, "Now when Jesus was born
[1:07:42] in Bethlehem of Judea
[1:07:45] in the days of Herod the king,
[1:07:48] behold, there came wise men from the
[1:07:50] east to Jerusalem,
[1:07:54] saying, "Where is he?
[1:07:57] that is born king of the Jews.
[1:08:00] For we have seen his star in the east
[1:08:04] and are come to worship him.
[1:08:07] Wise men today still understand
[1:08:11] because they seen the manifestation
[1:08:15] of Malachi 4. Because they seen the
[1:08:17] pattern of that same ministry.
[1:08:21] Wise men today, they still say, "Where
[1:08:24] is he?
[1:08:26] Messiah,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; King of the Jews.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; He came first as the lion of the tribe
[1:08:36] of Judah
[1:08:38] doing what? In Matthew 13
[1:08:42] and verse 10,
[1:08:44] it says, "And the disciples came
[1:08:48] and said unto him,
[1:08:50] why speakest thou unto them in parables?
[1:08:57] He answered and said unto them,
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; because it's given unto you to know the
[1:09:03] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but
[1:09:05] to them it's not given.
[1:09:11] That was the reason
[1:09:15] for the parables. That was the reason
[1:09:20] for a prophet with a third grade
[1:09:22] education.
[1:09:25] That was the reason for a completely
[1:09:28] uneducated man
[1:09:30] to be the forerunner in this day.
[1:09:33] He said, "Why I speak in parables
[1:09:35] myself?
[1:09:38] I can hardly read my own writing.
[1:09:39] Sometimes
[1:09:42] God could have brought another apostle
[1:09:44] Paul,
[1:09:47] but it was the season when he was going
[1:09:50] to hide these things from the eyes of
[1:09:53] the wise and prudent.
[1:09:55] This revealed word is only for his
[1:09:59] children.
[1:10:00] This revealed word is only for the
[1:10:03] predestinated ones.
[1:10:06] This revealed word. You must be born
[1:10:09] again
[1:10:11] to even read your Bible to understand
[1:10:14] it.
[1:10:16] You don't need an education.
[1:10:20] We need a revelation.
[1:10:25] Verse 12. For whosoever hath
[1:10:29] to him shall be given.
[1:10:32] And he shall have more abundance.
[1:10:35] But whoever But whosoever hath not
[1:10:39] from him shall be taken away,
[1:10:42] even that he hath.
[1:10:44] He's speaking
[1:10:46] of revelation.
[1:10:49] He's not talking about money.
[1:10:52] He's not talking about cars.
[1:10:54] He's not talking about homes.
[1:10:57] He's talking of revelation.
[1:11:00] Matthew 13:34.
[1:11:05] Matthew says,
[1:11:07] "All these things spake Jesus unto the
[1:11:10] multitude in parables,
[1:11:14] and while the parable spoke he not unto
[1:11:16] them,
[1:11:18] the parables
[1:11:20] were prophecies.
[1:11:22] The parables
[1:11:24] was the thoughts that was in the mind of
[1:11:26] God
[1:11:28] before the foundation of the world.
[1:11:31] The parables
[1:11:33] was a plan of redemption
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; hidden to all
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; except his children.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Verse 35
[1:11:43] that it might be fulfilled
[1:11:46] which was spoken by the prophet saying
[1:11:50] I will open my mouth
[1:11:53] in parables.
[1:11:55] I will utter things which have been kept
[1:11:58] secret from the foundation of the world.
[1:12:03] Things that only Adam had heard,
[1:12:07] things that only Adam had parttook of
[1:12:12] had been lost.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came,
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; he says, "I'm opening it back up.
[1:12:20] This plan
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; for your salvation,
[1:12:24] and I'm going to tell you all about it,
[1:12:28] and it will change your lives.
[1:12:32] If you do as I say,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; if you're obedient
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; and not disobedient,
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; I'll cause you to grow
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; unto the stature
[1:12:45] of a perfect man,
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:12:50] Then Jesus sent the multitude away,
[1:12:54] and went into the house.
[1:12:57] And his disciples came unto him, saying,
[1:13:02] Declare unto us the parable of the tears
[1:13:05] of the field.
[1:13:10] They asked for revelation.
[1:13:13] Jesus,
[1:13:15] he was born the king of the Jews.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; And that's the line of the tribe of
[1:13:20] Judah.
[1:13:22] He told his disciples
[1:13:25] in Matthew 10 and verse 5,
[1:13:28] he said, "These 12
[1:13:30] Jesus sent forth and commanded them,
[1:13:34] saying,
[1:13:36] "Go not into the way of the Gentiles,
[1:13:41] and into the city of the Samaritans,
[1:13:44] enter ye not."
[1:13:48] This was their ministerial commission.
[1:13:52] his 12 apostles.
[1:13:54] Don't do these two things
[1:13:57] because right now this message, this
[1:14:01] plan of redemption,
[1:14:03] I'm I want to offer it to the firstborn
[1:14:06] of Israel first.
[1:14:09] He says verse six,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; "But go rather to the lost sheep of the
[1:14:14] house of Israel
[1:14:18] in Luke in Lucas chapter 19
[1:14:24] and verse 29."
[1:14:26] It says this, "And it came to pass when
[1:14:30] he was come nigh to Beth Page and
[1:14:32] Bethany
[1:14:36] at the mount called the Mount of Olives,
[1:14:40] He sent two of his disciples,
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; saying, "Go ye into the village over
[1:14:46] against you,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; in the which at your entering you shall
[1:14:51] find a colt tied.
[1:14:55] It was prophecies of the prophets
[1:14:58] unfolding,
[1:15:01] wherein yet never a man sat,
[1:15:06] loose him, and bring him hither.
[1:15:09] And if any man ask you,
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; why you're stealing this donkey,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; why you why do you loose him?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Thus shall ye say unto them, because the
[1:15:22] Lord hath need of him,
[1:15:26] there was an anointing on them
[1:15:29] to do this simple act.
[1:15:32] Go find this little donkey.
[1:15:35] You'll find him tied up in a certain
[1:15:36] place.
[1:15:38] Just untie it and take him.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What if someone tries to stop us?
[1:15:45] The anointing of me will be upon you.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; And say these words that I'll tell you.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; The Lord has need of him.
[1:15:56] The anointing shook that owner.
[1:16:00] Take him then.
[1:16:02] Hallelujah.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And they that were sent went their way.
[1:16:08] and found even as he said unto them,
[1:16:12] it was thus saith the Lord. And as they
[1:16:15] were loosing the coat,
[1:16:19] the owners therefore said unto them,
[1:16:22] why loose ye the coat,
[1:16:25] why you taking him? That's my coat. And
[1:16:29] they said, "The Lord hath need of him."
[1:16:34] And they brought him to Jesus.
[1:16:36] and they cast their garments upon the
[1:16:38] colt
[1:16:41] and they set Jesus thereon.
[1:16:44] It was a tremendous anointing that day.
[1:16:49] That's the way kings came in.
[1:16:54] And as he went,
[1:16:56] they spread their clothes in the way.
[1:17:00] And when he was come nigh,
[1:17:02] even now at the descent of the mount of
[1:17:04] olives,
[1:17:07] The whole multitude of disciples
[1:17:10] began to rejoice and praise God with a
[1:17:14] loud voice
[1:17:17] for all the mighty works that they had
[1:17:18] seen
[1:17:21] saying, "Blessed be the king that cometh
[1:17:23] in the name of the Lord.
[1:17:27] Peace in heaven
[1:17:29] and glory
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; in the highest."
[1:17:34] They crowned their king.
[1:17:37] He He rode into Jerusalem.
[1:17:42] But it was going to be
[1:17:45] the beginning of the greatest ministry
[1:17:48] ever
[1:17:51] because he would give his life
[1:17:54] for you and I.
[1:17:56] We consider that
[1:17:58] the end of a ministry.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; We consider that all hope is lost.
[1:18:04] when someone dies. But when Jesus died,
[1:18:09] no one took his life, he gave it up for
[1:18:12] you and I.
[1:18:14] And when he laid in the grave for three
[1:18:16] days,
[1:18:19] no one gave him life.
[1:18:23] He raised himself up again
[1:18:26] to let us know.
[1:18:29] I hold the keys
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; to life, to death, to heaven, to hell.
[1:18:38] The king of verse five of Revelations 5.
[1:18:43] And one of the elders saith unto me,
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; weep not, behold a lion of the tribe of
[1:18:50] Judah,
[1:18:53] the root of David hath prevailed
[1:18:56] to open the book.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; He opened it to Israel and to loose the
[1:19:02] seven seals thereof.
[1:19:04] And he preached them in a parable
[1:19:07] in Matthew 24.
[1:19:10] The king of the Jews, the lion of the
[1:19:13] tribe of Israel
[1:19:15] in the first coming of Christ,
[1:19:18] he came with the open book in his hand.
[1:19:22] and he loosed the seven seals thereof.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Revelation six
[1:19:30] is a is a prophecy
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; if you read it of six seals.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; But in that prophecy
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; when that chapter
[1:19:41] unfolds
[1:19:44] it speaks that every seal is open.
[1:19:48] Do you know where Revelation 6:1 began?
[1:19:52] And the opening of every seal began
[1:19:56] in the days of Jesus in his earthly
[1:19:59] ministry.
[1:20:01] He opened that book to Israel first.
[1:20:05] Matthew 13:35.
[1:20:09] Matthew
[1:20:11] reaches back into the Old Testament
[1:20:12] prophets
[1:20:15] anointed
[1:20:17] of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:19] and he says, "Why the reason for all the
[1:20:22] parables?
[1:20:24] Why the reason for all the visions?
[1:20:27] Why? The reason for all the allegorories
[1:20:31] and the metaphors from Genesis to
[1:20:34] Revelations
[1:20:36] that it might be fulfilled
[1:20:39] which was spoken by the prophet saying,
[1:20:42] "I'll open my mouth in parables.
[1:20:47] I will utter things which have been kept
[1:20:49] secret from the foundation of the
[1:20:50] world."
[1:20:54] The first thunder was loosed.
[1:20:57] said, "What is a thunder?"
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; A thunder is the voice of God when a
[1:21:04] seal opens.
[1:21:08] When Jesus began speaking
[1:21:11] and opened that first seal,
[1:21:13] the first thunder sounded,
[1:21:16] the thunder was the symbol.
[1:21:19] It just meant
[1:21:21] the plan of redemption
[1:21:24] to take you back
[1:21:26] into my presence
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; has begun
[1:21:30] in the days of Jesus. Verse 36 of
[1:21:33] Matthew 13.
[1:21:36] Then Jesus sent the multitude away
[1:21:39] and went into the house. And his
[1:21:42] disciples came unto him, saying,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Declare unto us the parable of the tears
[1:21:47] of the field.
[1:21:50] I say, "Lord, come into your house
[1:21:54] tonight
[1:21:56] and declare unto each and every person,
[1:22:00] both young and old, rich or poor,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; man or woman, as they pray in their
[1:22:07] hearts,
[1:22:09] and say, Lord, not my will,
[1:22:12] but thine be done."
[1:22:15] Revelations 5
[1:22:18] verses 5 to 10.
[1:22:21] It shows the ministerial change
[1:22:25] from the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:22:28] to the lamb of God as king. His ministry
[1:22:33] was only to the Jews.
[1:22:36] As lamb of God, it was to all the
[1:22:39] people.
[1:22:41] Revelations 5 verse 5 to 10.
[1:22:45] was the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:22:50] in the in these two climaxes
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; of the beginning as lion of the tribe of
[1:22:57] Judah
[1:22:59] and at Gethsemane
[1:23:01] accepting
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; his lamb ministry.
[1:23:06] So verses 5 to 10
[1:23:09] measure a space
[1:23:12] of the three and a half years
[1:23:14] of Jesus ministry.
[1:23:18] Remember when the angel of the Lord
[1:23:22] came to the shepherds
[1:23:25] in Luke chapter 2
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; beginning at verse 10.
[1:23:36] He says, "And the angel said unto them,
[1:23:39] Fear not,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[1:23:45] great joy, which shall be to all people.
[1:23:53] And the angel said unto them,
[1:23:57] he was speaking to the shepherds. Now,
[1:24:00] fear not, for behold, I bring you good
[1:24:04] tidings of great joy,
[1:24:08] which which will be to all people.
[1:24:11] It was a prophecy
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; of the lamb ministry.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And that ministry of the lamb was to be
[1:24:19] to all people, Jew and Gentile alike.
[1:24:24] For unto you,
[1:24:26] is born this day
[1:24:29] in the city of David, a savior which is
[1:24:32] Christ the Lord.
[1:24:35] That was speaking of the lamb ministry.
[1:24:39] When the when the wise men came,
[1:24:42] they said, "Where is he?" Born king of
[1:24:45] the Jews,
[1:24:47] but to the shepherds, he said,
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; he says, "For behold,
[1:24:55] I'll bring you great tidings of great
[1:24:58] joy,
[1:25:00] which shall be to all people."
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; The Magi
[1:25:05] spoke of his lying ministry,
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; the shepherds,
[1:25:10] spoke of his lamb ministry.
[1:25:14] Both spoke of the same man
[1:25:17] who was worthy to open the book,
[1:25:20] Jesus Christ.
[1:25:22] Revelations 5:es
[1:25:25] 5 to10.
[1:25:27] It speaks of both
[1:25:29] and shows the order and reveals the
[1:25:32] change of the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:25:37] from lion to lamb. And it happened in
[1:25:40] three and a half years.
[1:25:43] And it happened from verse 5 to verse 10
[1:25:48] in Revelations 5. And one of the elders
[1:25:51] said unto me,
[1:25:53] "Weep not.
[1:25:55] Behold, the line of the tribe of Judah,
[1:25:59] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[1:26:02] the book,
[1:26:04] and to loose the seven seals thereof.
[1:26:07] It had begun.
[1:26:09] the plan of redemption
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; and the first seal had opened
[1:26:15] in the days of Jesus
[1:26:17] in the days of John the Baptist
[1:26:22] for 33 and a2 years
[1:26:25] of the ministry
[1:26:27] of Jesus. He was born king of the Jews.
[1:26:32] And on the cross of Calvary, it was
[1:26:35] written, "This is Jesus,
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; King of the Jews."
[1:26:42] But he really died,
[1:26:44] the lamb of God
[1:26:47] at Gethsemane.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; He went in and accepted a ministerial
[1:26:52] change.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord,
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; this cup
[1:26:59] if it's possible
[1:27:01] for it to pass from me.
[1:27:04] It was the man part
[1:27:08] but the lamb in him said but not my will
[1:27:12] but thine be done.
[1:27:15] The flesh part says
[1:27:17] Lord why do I have to be going through
[1:27:20] this problem right now?
[1:27:24] But the lamb nature
[1:27:28] within us.
[1:27:30] It says, "But Lord Jesus,
[1:27:33] not my will but thine be done." Verse
[1:27:37] six, it says, "And be and I beheld and
[1:27:39] lo in the midst of the throne
[1:27:44] and of the four beasts
[1:27:46] and in the midst of the elders
[1:27:49] stood a lamb as had been slain,
[1:27:52] having seven horns
[1:27:55] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[1:27:57] spirits of God
[1:28:00] sent forth unto all the earth."
[1:28:04] The lamb ministry
[1:28:06] was now reaching out
[1:28:09] to everyone upon the face of the earth.
[1:28:13] And he came and took the book
[1:28:15] out of the right hand of him that sat on
[1:28:17] the throne.
[1:28:20] Where did the lamb take the book from?
[1:28:25] From him that sat on the throne.
[1:28:28] It said the lion had the book.
[1:28:31] But he didn't go to the lion to take the
[1:28:33] book.
[1:28:35] He went back to the original holder,
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; the original owner that sat on the
[1:28:41] throne.
[1:28:43] Remember this is symbols.
[1:28:45] But how did it really unfold?
[1:28:50] You can read it in Matthew 26 and Luke
[1:28:54] 22.
[1:28:55] But Jesus walked into the garden of
[1:28:58] Gethsemane,
[1:29:00] the line of the tribe of Judah,
[1:29:03] with the book he had opened in his
[1:29:05] hands.
[1:29:07] And he walked out the lamb of God
[1:29:10] with the same book in his hands
[1:29:13] to unfold the lamb part of the book.
[1:29:18] The book didn't really change hands.
[1:29:21] God simply changed
[1:29:24] his ministry.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; God and for you know and morphing
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; changes forms but God in morphing
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; also changes ministry
[1:29:37] and God immorph
[1:29:40] will also change our lives
[1:29:43] if we surrender to him.
[1:29:49] God simply changed his ministry.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; If you surrender the eye gate
[1:29:58] and the lamb will reveal to you things
[1:30:03] that your eyes have never seen.
[1:30:06] If you surrender the ear gate
[1:30:10] and you will hear the lamb tell you
[1:30:12] things
[1:30:14] that your ears have never heard.
[1:30:17] That's when you are eating the book.
[1:30:21] Now is the promise. When the book was to
[1:30:24] change hands again.
[1:30:28] Let's read it.
[1:30:30] Let's read it where another ministerial
[1:30:32] change was to take place.
[1:30:37] But in our day, Revelations chapter 10
[1:30:42] and verse 8.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; John in a vision.
[1:30:47] And he says this,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; "Much is said
[1:30:52] of the first seven verses
[1:30:55] of Revelations 10.
[1:30:57] They are history,
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; but we're really living
[1:31:02] in the in the fulfillment
[1:31:05] of Revelations 10:8-11.
[1:31:10] But the world and men have put a period
[1:31:15] like there's only seven verses in
[1:31:16] Revelations 10,
[1:31:20] but the first seven are history.
[1:31:23] But these are prophecies
[1:31:26] for you and I verse 8, Revelations 10.
[1:31:31] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:31:34] spake unto me again
[1:31:36] and said, "Go and take the little book
[1:31:38] which is open in the hand of the angel,
[1:31:43] which standeth upon the sea
[1:31:46] and upon the earth.
[1:31:50] Did you catch it? Where John was told
[1:31:54] to go get the book?"
[1:31:56] He didn't go to get the book from the
[1:32:00] seventh angel.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; That's verse seven.
[1:32:11] He was told,
[1:32:13] "Go and take the little book
[1:32:17] which is open
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; in the hand of the angel
[1:32:22] which
[1:32:24] standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:32:26] earth.
[1:32:29] That angel is the angel of the covenant.
[1:32:33] That angel
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; is Christ himself.
[1:32:37] Then John,
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; a type of the bride,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; he says, "And I went unto the angel
[1:32:43] and said unto him,
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; give me the little book."
[1:32:49] And he said unto me, take it and eat it
[1:32:52] up,
[1:32:54] and it shall make thy belly bitter,
[1:32:58] but it shall be in thy mouth,
[1:33:00] sweet as honey." And I took the little
[1:33:03] book
[1:33:05] out of the angel's hand
[1:33:08] and ate it up. And it was in my mouth
[1:33:11] sweet as honey.
[1:33:13] And as soon I as I had eaten it,
[1:33:17] my belly was bitter.
[1:33:20] And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[1:33:23] again
[1:33:26] before many peoples and nations and
[1:33:30] tongues and kings.
[1:33:32] Long after
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; the prophet of to the Leodysian church
[1:33:38] is off the scene.
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:42] Long after the seventh angel is gone,
[1:33:48] God is calling
[1:33:50] you and I
[1:33:52] to take this book and to eat it.
[1:33:58] Why did John have to take it
[1:34:02] from the angel of the covenant himself,
[1:34:05] which is Christ himself?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Because it's going to be
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; and it must be a personal experience
[1:34:15] with Jesus Christ.
[1:34:21] Revelations 10
[1:34:24] 8-11
[1:34:26] is the prophecy
[1:34:28] of the book changing hands
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; from one man
[1:34:34] the seventh angel
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; to a many membered body
[1:34:39] called the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:42] Just like it happened when a one-man
[1:34:45] ministry
[1:34:47] called Jesus of Nazareth
[1:34:50] when he ascended on high, he said, "Go
[1:34:53] ye terry in Jerusalem
[1:34:56] not many days from today.
[1:34:59] You
[1:35:01] 120
[1:35:04] will be endued with power
[1:35:06] from on high." Oh, we're here again.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Where are you? Maybe just 20. God is
[1:35:14] saying, "I will endure you with power
[1:35:17] from on high.
[1:35:19] I'll do it again like I did it then."
[1:35:23] And you and I can have our Pentecost,
[1:35:28] a personal experience with Jesus Christ.
[1:35:32] Verse 9 of Revelations 10. And I went
[1:35:36] unto the angel and said unto me, Give me
[1:35:40] the book. And he said unto me, take it
[1:35:43] and eat it up,
[1:35:45] and it shall make thy belly bitter, but
[1:35:48] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[1:35:52] And I took the little book out of the
[1:35:55] angel's hand, and ate it up, and it was
[1:35:59] in my mouth sweet as honey.
[1:36:02] And as soon as I had eaten it,
[1:36:05] my belly was bitter
[1:36:07] cuz it started to change my life
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; immediately.
[1:36:15] And he said unto me,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; "Thou
[1:36:18] bride of Christ,
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; thou lamb's wife,
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; thou must prophesy again.
[1:36:27] You will now take this message
[1:36:30] to many peoples and nations and tongues
[1:36:32] and kings."
[1:36:35] Revelations 10:8-11
[1:36:38] is the prophecy of this book changing
[1:36:40] hands
[1:36:43] from the hands of Malachi 4
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; to the hands of Revelations 19.
[1:36:51] Turn with me to Revelations 19
[1:36:56] as we're closing tonight.
[1:37:01] Revelations 19
[1:37:04] beginning at verse five
[1:37:07] and it says, "And a voice came out of
[1:37:10] the throne,
[1:37:13] saying, praise our God,
[1:37:16] all ye his servants,
[1:37:18] and ye that fear him, both small and
[1:37:21] great,
[1:37:23] all the servants,
[1:37:25] all the ministries,
[1:37:27] all the prophets,
[1:37:29] all the apostles,
[1:37:31] all the Levites,
[1:37:34] all who have preached the gospel.
[1:37:37] And I heard as it were the voice of a
[1:37:39] great multitude
[1:37:42] and the voice of many waters.
[1:37:45] A prophet said, "Those are his
[1:37:47] preachers.
[1:37:49] That is the voice of mighty thunderings,
[1:37:53] the preachers bringing
[1:37:55] the word of God, showing that a seal has
[1:37:59] been opened.
[1:38:01] What is a thunder?
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; It's the voice of God.
[1:38:06] When a seal is open,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; what is the voice of mighty thunderings?
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; It's all seven seals have been loose.
[1:38:17] Saying allelujah,
[1:38:20] for the Lord God omnipotent reignth.
[1:38:25] Then he says, "Let us be glad
[1:38:28] and rejoice
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; and give honor
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; for the book has changed hands now.
[1:38:37] For the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:38:40] and his wife hath made herself ready."
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Eleazar
[1:38:46] brought her to the feet of Isaac.
[1:38:49] Rebecca,
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; that's what's happening here.
[1:38:53] his servants, his voices, preaching the
[1:38:56] gospel, loosing seven thunders, the
[1:39:00] mysteries of God, salvation for all his
[1:39:04] children.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; And when they're done,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; they present Rebecca
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; to Isaac,
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; and they walk away for their ministry
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; is done.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Now it's Rebecca and Isaac,
[1:39:20] and
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; now it's you and Jesus.
[1:39:23] Let us be glad and rejoice
[1:39:26] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:39:31] of you and I is come.
[1:39:33] [Music]
[1:39:36] The marriage of the lamb has come.
[1:39:39] And his wife, a many membered body,
[1:39:43] have made herself ready
[1:39:46] with a revealed word, with a book that
[1:39:49] was open. And to her was granted
[1:39:53] that she would be arrayed in fine linen,
[1:39:57] clean and white. For the fine linen is
[1:40:00] the righteousness of saints.
[1:40:04] And he saith unto me, write blessed
[1:40:08] are they which are called unto the
[1:40:11] marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:40:14] Blessed are those that have eaten this
[1:40:17] book, that will sweeten their mouth like
[1:40:20] honey,
[1:40:22] that bitter in their bellies
[1:40:25] while you were on this earth
[1:40:27] because it'll give you a right to s with
[1:40:31] the king at the marriage supper of the
[1:40:33] lamb. Hallelujah.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, God is good.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; And the book has changed hands.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; It's in your hands. It's in my hands and
[1:40:45] Jesus himself has given it to us.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; It is finished.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; This is God's great desire
[1:41:02] to put the book back into the hands of
[1:41:06] another original owner,
[1:41:09] a son and daughter of God.
[1:41:12] You and I
[1:41:14] are original owners.
[1:41:17] And because of that, we have a God-given
[1:41:20] right
[1:41:22] to hold the book,
[1:41:24] to read the book, and to have revelation
[1:41:29] of this great plan of redemption.
[1:41:33] We're back now
[1:41:36] where Adam fell.
[1:41:38] The generation gap
[1:41:42] has been bridged.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; The friendship has been restored.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Will you take the book tonight
[1:41:52] justification
[1:41:54] and surrender the flesh realm?
[1:42:01] Surrender your eyes, your ears, the
[1:42:05] touch, the smell, the taste.
[1:42:08] It's your first pool. to eternal life.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, will you take this book tonight
[1:42:16] of sanctification
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; and surrender your spirit realm,
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; memory, imagination, conscious
[1:42:25] affection, reason. It's your second pull
[1:42:30] to eternal life.
[1:42:33] Will you take the book
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; this night
[1:42:41] directly
[1:42:43] from the hand of the angel of the
[1:42:45] covenant?
[1:42:48] Commit to a total surrender
[1:42:52] of all unbelief.
[1:42:54] say, "Not my will, but thine be done."
[1:42:59] And the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:02] places you right at that spot
[1:43:05] where Adam fell, a son being adopted,
[1:43:10] a friendship,
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; restored
[1:43:14] the night. When you leave,
[1:43:17] that can be your testimony.
[1:43:21] You can say
[1:43:23] I
[1:43:25] have done what God has asked me to do.
[1:43:29] I take back the book.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; It's my book. I'm an original owner
[1:43:36] and I'm going to live a life
[1:43:38] worthy of the gospel.
[1:43:41] God is big enough
[1:43:44] to give you
[1:43:46] that ministry.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; How big is our God?
[1:43:51] Big enough to give us sound doctrine.
[1:43:56] Big enough to give us sound bodies.
[1:44:01] Big enough to give us sound minds
[1:44:04] in a time when the world is losing
[1:44:07] theirs.
[1:44:09] Big enough to give us sound churches.
[1:44:14] Big enough to give us sound families.
[1:44:19] giving us big enough to give us sound
[1:44:21] fellowship.
[1:44:24] He's big enough to give us friendships
[1:44:28] restored with one another.
[1:44:31] And I want to tell you tonight
[1:44:34] that these are the sounds
[1:44:36] of a rushing mighty wind
[1:44:40] that's with us today
[1:44:43] of the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:44:47] in the form of the comforter
[1:44:50] as we stand to our feet.
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:45:02] the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:45:05] in the form of the comforter
[1:45:08] who has come,
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; who is here, who wants to live in you
[1:45:15] tonight.
[1:45:16] All he's asking you
[1:45:19] is to
[1:45:21] is to acknowledge
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; I'm an original owner.
[1:45:27] this book is mine
[1:45:29] and just like Jesus
[1:45:32] who prayed in the garden.
[1:45:34] He says life
[1:45:36] can be hard but Lord Jesus
[1:45:40] not my will
[1:45:42] thine be done
[1:45:45] in Jesus name.
[1:45:47] Let's pray. Heavenly father
[1:45:51] we thank you tonight.
[1:45:54] Lord for being here with us,
[1:45:58] for speaking to every heart.
[1:46:01] But more than speaking,
[1:46:03] I believe you're changing hearts
[1:46:06] little by little,
[1:46:09] one inch at a time, but you're making
[1:46:12] great changes
[1:46:15] in all our lives. And for this, we thank
[1:46:18] you
[1:46:23] for
[1:46:25] in Jesus name.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Joseph had come
[1:46:47] a song like to try and sing.
[1:47:20] I'm not sure if we have this one. Uh
[1:47:22] Abby,
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; soften my heart with oil.

[1:50:20] cuz I want all that you have
[1:50:26] for me.
[1:50:29] You can have your seat.
[1:50:34] I want to sing that song. Um,
[1:50:40] I'm sorry. Um,
[1:50:46] you know, I just want to say that as
[1:50:48] brother Daniel ministers the word of
[1:50:51] God,
[1:50:57] there's something about the lamb of God.
[1:51:03] It just keeps appearing to me.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not seeing I'm not seeing anything
[1:51:08] like a lamb or anything like that.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; It just it's in my heart
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; because the the scripture says the lamb
[1:51:17] of God took the sins of away from us. He
[1:51:22] took our sins away.
[1:51:25] It means something to me, brother,
[1:51:27] sister. It should mean something.
[1:51:31] Hallelujah.

[2:00:24] that it's not by works.
[2:00:27] It's not because of something good.
[2:00:30] It's only by your grace, Lord.
