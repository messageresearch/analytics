[47:49] it's good to be here once again
[47:52] Christmas in the presence of like people
[47:54] of like Precious faces
[48:00] so make everybody Welcome this morning
[48:06] want to especially make welcome my
[48:08] cousin this morning Reuben Ferreira
[48:13] oh may God Comfort his heart
[48:17] and that's why we come to God's house
[48:20] we're just looking for one more touch
[48:23] foreign
[48:41] we had coming in September
[48:44] it was I think it was the ninth and the
[48:47] 10th
[48:48] uh our brother Rafael Cabello
[48:52] from uh from Congo Africa the Africa Del
[48:56] Congo but they had a sudden death in
[48:59] their family
[49:04] I believe it was uh his wife sister God
[49:07] live it was her her brother
[49:11] and uh he he didn't die he didn't die a
[49:15] natural death
[49:17] and so it kind of took them all by
[49:20] surprise
[49:22] he was her brother was a general
[49:26] in the Congolese Army
[49:29] so he held a high ranking position
[49:34] so it was a bit of a shock not only for
[49:37] the family
[49:41] it was a bit of a shocking joke
[49:45] not just for the family but uh for the
[49:48] government there in Congo
[49:51] so they they had to leave and go back to
[49:54] Congo
[49:56] and Lord willing sometime in the future
[50:00] you'll be able to be back here
[50:06] um this this next week here is
[50:11] Mr Karen leave Thursday
[50:15] through some dedicational services
[50:21] [Music]
[50:23] in Albuquerque New Mexico
[50:26] so they're having a Friday service
[50:30] Friday night
[50:33] Saturday morning and evening
[50:36] they leave Sunday morning and evening
[50:40] everybody
[50:44] and uh
[50:46] to we are we we will be ministering the
[50:50] Saturday night and Sunday services
[50:56] and Friday Saturday morning there's a
[50:58] couple of other brothers ministers it'll
[51:00] be Ministries
[51:03] and we look forward to be able to sit
[51:06] down in the benches there and listen
[51:07] also
[51:10] I'd like to think I'm still a teachable
[51:14] students
[51:17] but I do enjoy sitting down and hearing
[51:19] the word preached
[51:24] when we have that opportunity
[51:27] and
[51:28] we've been ministering on a on a subject
[51:33] the white horse riders in the Days of
[51:37] Elijah and the pale horse riders
[51:40] in the days of our lives and we come to
[51:44] find out
[51:45] it was a profit to see in the Book of
[51:47] Revelations
[51:49] the white horse rider Blanco is spoken
[51:53] of in the first seals
[51:55] and the pale horse riders
[51:58] was actually
[52:00] was also the last writer
[52:03] for there was only four Riders
[52:06] and we realize it's just one great big
[52:09] Plan of Salvation
[52:13] this uh this new testamento so we're
[52:16] coming to to realize also that this new
[52:19] testamento is is the Lamb's Book of Life
[52:24] because the lamb was the is the savior
[52:27] of the whole world
[52:29] he's the Savior it gives salvation to
[52:32] all
[52:34] and it was the lamb who opened this
[52:37] great Plan of Salvation
[52:38] plan and we realized the plan that he
[52:42] opened
[52:43] is this new testament book it says
[52:46] formado
[53:15] and I came into this world speaking lies
[53:18] so he realized David realized that he
[53:21] needed a change
[53:23] but that's the old nature of the curse
[53:28] and the curse that falls on every human
[53:31] being is
[53:33] that we're born through a sexual
[53:36] relationships
[53:39] that was that was given down to the
[53:42] human race
[53:46] called the serpent in the garden
[53:50] so how can we escape it
[53:53] if we're born in this flesh bodies
[53:57] the DNA the characteristics of the
[54:00] serpents characteristics
[54:04] but Jesus gave us an answer
[54:06] he says it's easy he says you simply
[54:10] must be born again
[54:13] that's the answer is
[54:15] so this morning
[54:20] continuing on this same subject
[54:24] because because the ride of these horse
[54:27] riders
[54:30] and the presence of the four living
[54:32] creatures
[54:35] underneath those two Ministries
[54:38] the ministry of Christ and the ministry
[54:41] of Lucifer Lucifer is a great Plan of
[54:45] Salvation
[54:47] and the rider of these horses
[54:50] is trying to keep as many people as
[54:54] possible
[54:56] from surrendering their lives to Jesus
[54:59] Christ
[55:01] and experiencing this born-again
[55:03] experience
[55:06] but there is a plan that I plan
[55:10] there is a planet and and God has
[55:12] unfolded that plan
[55:15] he had it written in a book
[55:18] it was in the Old Testament but it was
[55:22] in types and shadows
[55:24] and then he wrote it in a new testamento
[55:29] to make the types and shadows clearly
[55:32] and yet he said it first in Parables
[55:39] but in this plan he promised
[55:42] the second coming of Christ
[55:44] he would make this Plan of Salvation
[55:47] he would give us not only the
[55:50] understanding
[55:51] but he would give us the personal
[55:53] experience
[55:56] so we could really understand
[55:59] the value of this quickening power
[56:06] to give us an overcoming life
[56:09] through Jesus Christ
[56:13] it would turn in our Bible to
[56:14] Revelations
[56:25] Revelations 5.
[56:29] is this story of Salvation
[56:33] with just mentioning the major parts
[56:39] for us
[56:41] but but throughout the Bible
[56:45] at the prophets of old
[56:48] the disciples the men like the Apostle
[56:51] Paul
[56:53] they added more details to this plan
[56:57] as a matter of fact the new the Bible
[57:00] itself
[57:02] fills the gaps
[57:04] here in Revelations
[57:07] because Revelations
[57:09] it begins in Genesis
[57:12] and where it comes to an end
[57:15] is for a gentile bride is
[57:19] raptured where it comes to an end that's
[57:24] where the prophecy that Paul spoke to us
[57:26] is
[57:28] it the dead in Christ shall rise first
[57:32] and we were sure alive and remains
[57:39] so so this this is a brief summary is
[57:47] and the New Testament adds details
[57:50] between the lines
[57:54] so when we're reading when you when
[57:57] you've heard the term you have to learn
[57:58] to read between the lines
[58:02] that doesn't mean we're putting
[58:04] something into the Bible that isn't
[58:06] there
[58:08] that means you're taking all the
[58:10] scriptures from the Old and New
[58:11] Testaments
[58:13] and you're finding their place between

[58:39] remembrance we'll bring it all back

[58:58] [Music]
[59:00] and it goes beyond 2023.3
[59:06] that goes beyond December that's coming
[59:08] up
[59:10] these nine verses
[59:14] and the rest of the details between the
[59:17] verses
[59:22] from Genesis to the last book in the
[59:26] Bible
[59:26] revelations
[59:29] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[59:31] sat on the throne a book written within
[59:34] and on the backside sealed with Seven
[59:37] Seals
[59:44] Heavenly Father Celestial you alone can
[59:48] open the book
[59:50] you're the revealer of your own words
[59:58] go from heart to heart
[1:00:03] and Open the Eyes of our understanding
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:10] you may be seated
[1:00:16] Revelations 5 1
[1:00:18] .
[1:00:20] and I saw on the right hand of him that
[1:00:22] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:00:24] and on the back side sealed with Seven
[1:00:27] Seals
[1:00:32] counting from the birth of Christ
[1:00:38] that day in Genesis
[1:00:41] chapter 3 and verse 21.
[1:00:45] where the father is dressing Adam and
[1:00:48] Eve
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:50] in Lamb skins
[1:00:55] Revelations 5 1.
[1:00:58] begins about 4000 BCS
[1:01:02] that's that day in Genesis
[1:01:06] God was dressing Adam and Eve
[1:01:10] because they had chosen something to
[1:01:13] cover their themselves
[1:01:16] the Bible said it was fig leaves
[1:01:20] covering just the most personal Parts
[1:01:24] but God who's a god of Holiness
[1:01:28] he says I won't have my children
[1:01:30] dressing that way in public
[1:01:34] and he created the Bible says he created
[1:01:37] skins
[1:01:38] and he covered them completely because
[1:01:42] God from the beginning in Genesis
[1:01:45] was a god of Holiness and he wants his
[1:01:48] children to live in Holiness
[1:01:53] Revelation 5 1.
[1:01:55] begins about 4 000 BC comments
[1:02:00] this is John having a vision
[1:02:03] and see him all the way back to Genesis
[1:02:07] a vision of that day in Eden unavision
[1:02:11] when Adam and Eve were put out of the
[1:02:14] presence
[1:02:16] and as you know when you read the last
[1:02:19] chapter of Revelation
[1:03:17] that was in the hands of Adam
[1:03:33] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:03:36] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:03:39] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:03:41] is
[1:03:46] what's happening here
[1:03:48] this is the ministry of the Lion of the
[1:03:52] tribe of Jews
[1:03:55] and this ministry of the line of the
[1:03:58] tribe of Judas
[1:04:00] was all the way from the beginning
[1:04:03] and would be with Israel for four
[1:04:05] thousand years
[1:04:08] but there would be a change
[1:04:13] when Israel would no longer take the
[1:04:15] kingship
[1:04:47] it says and I saw a strong angel
[1:04:49] proclaiming with a loud voice
[1:04:59] there were seven seals on this book
[1:05:03] it was all it was it was all in types
[1:05:06] and shadows
[1:05:09] it's not it's not literal though it's
[1:05:14] written and it sounds like it's
[1:05:15] something literal foreign
[1:05:33] Revelations 5 2 says and I saw a strong
[1:05:36] angel proclaiming with a loud voice
[1:05:38] who's worthy to open the book and to
[1:05:41] loose the seals thereof is
[1:05:45] foreign
[1:06:45] a pale horse rider is given a name
[1:06:49] he's always been there so the pale horse
[1:06:53] rider sweeps through Egypt
[1:06:58] and everything that isn't under the
[1:07:00] blood of the Lambs
[1:07:04] all the first born
[1:07:08] women
[1:07:11] the angels of the Covenant a strong
[1:07:15] Angel Fuerte now leads them out of
[1:07:18] bondage
[1:07:19] and Israel has entered into a journey
[1:07:23] but this journey is not a journey just
[1:07:26] to get from point A to point
[1:07:29] Bunch this journey isn't just to leave
[1:07:33] Egypt and get into a Promised Land
[1:07:38] Journey it's a character building
[1:07:40] process
[1:07:43] this journey
[1:07:45] it's Jerusalem or Bust it is
[1:07:54] over and over again the children of
[1:07:58] Israel
[1:07:59] but remember you're recording it was a
[1:08:01] character building process
[1:08:06] and there was an entire generation of
[1:08:08] those that had come out of Egypt
[1:08:12] who would not accept change
[1:08:20] they brought all the Pagan ways of those
[1:08:23] old denominations with them
[1:08:27] could it be happening again today
[1:08:33] but the angel of the Covenant
[1:08:35] was looking for a worthy one
[1:08:38] how long was he looking for brother
[1:08:40] Daniel
[1:08:42] from Genesis until the first coming of
[1:08:45] Christ Angel The Covenant was looking
[1:08:48] for a worthy one
[1:08:50] for four thousand years
[1:08:53] one who could open the book
[1:08:56] that Adam lost that God had written and
[1:09:00] loose the seven Parts
[1:09:02] the Seven Seals Revelations
[1:09:16] because God had changed forms
[1:09:19] from God on the throne
[1:09:21] Miranda
[1:09:57] no
[1:09:59] we have just fast forwarded in this
[1:10:01] Vision
[1:10:03] to another time zone
[1:10:06] here to this next verse
[1:10:12] it's about 60 years after the death
[1:10:16] burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:10:26] and that this Mighty Angel said that no
[1:10:29] man has been found worthy
[1:10:33] then the Bible says in verse 4.
[1:10:39] John says
[1:10:44] I cried like I've never cried before
[1:10:49] John was already a man about 80 90 years
[1:10:53] old
[1:10:54] he said he said have I labored all my
[1:10:58] life preaching the gospel that Jesus
[1:11:00] taught me in Tennessee house
[1:11:10] have I done it in vain
[1:11:13] because no man is
[1:11:16] to open and to read the book
[1:11:20] not even to look
[1:11:24] Revelations 5 4.
[1:11:26] is John imprisoned on the idol of Patmos
[1:11:31] and the year is about 90 A.D yeah
[1:11:34] you could say brother Daniel you're
[1:11:37] putting gears on this is
[1:11:40] no man knoweth the date or the time
[1:11:47] not the future
[1:11:51] but modern events
[1:11:53] that have passed already in our history
[1:11:56] have been made clear to us
[1:12:04] and the things that have happened
[1:12:08] and put our finger on a day
[1:12:11] and say this day yes
[1:12:17] So Not only was this strong Angel
[1:12:19] leading Israel out of Egypt
[1:12:23] he was also simultaneously looking for a
[1:12:27] man who is worthy foreign
[1:13:30] for
[1:13:36] you and me
[1:13:40] and this Mighty Angel yes proclaims I've
[1:13:44] been looking for four thousand years
[1:13:47] and found no man
[1:13:50] who was this Mighty Angel
[1:13:52] it was almighty God
[1:13:56] which was changing forms
[1:14:01] and looking for a kinsman redeemer
[1:14:14] and loose the seven parts
[1:14:18] that we might be cleansed and washed
[1:14:24] now to open the book and to lose the
[1:14:28] Seven Seals it's not two separate things
[1:14:32] no it sounds that way
[1:14:35] but even though it uses the word book in
[1:14:39] the English
[1:14:43] it was really a scroll
[1:14:46] for at the time of the writings
[1:14:50] they didn't have books as we have them
[1:14:54] today
[1:14:55] they didn't have a book like this that
[1:14:59] would that would open up
[1:15:01] everything was written
[1:15:07] it might have been an animal skin of
[1:15:09] some kind
[1:15:11] they would write messages in it
[1:15:14] then they would take they would seal
[1:15:16] that scroll up
[1:15:18] they might take another piece of leather
[1:15:21] and tie around it
[1:15:24] if I was Kings of the earth
[1:15:27] they would take and and put wax all over
[1:15:30] that leather leather string
[1:15:35] then they would take their rings and
[1:15:37] press it into the wax
[1:15:41] and it was death for anybody to open
[1:15:44] that scroll
[1:15:46] unless you were the one the message was
[1:15:49] foreign
[1:16:31] to get to to open it up to see what's
[1:16:34] written within
[1:16:37] there was a process to get
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:37] of Jesus Christ continue
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:50] but when no one was found worthy
[1:17:53] to open the book
[1:17:56] and God in the form of the Angel of the
[1:18:00] covenants
[1:18:02] he testified
[1:18:04] he said I've been looking
[1:18:07] since Adam and Eve
[1:18:11] all the way to this time
[1:18:29] that is the curse on Mankind
[1:18:32] and that's why we must be born again
[1:18:37] for that for that curse
[1:18:40] to be washed away
[1:18:42] for that curse will lose its control
[1:18:46] over our mortal bonds
[1:18:50] Psalms chapter 8
[1:18:53] verses five through nine
[1:18:57] and it reads like this
[1:18:59] for thou has made him a little lower
[1:19:02] than the angels
[1:19:06] and has crowned him with Glory and Honor
[1:19:11] now matters him to have dominion over
[1:19:14] the works of thy hands
[1:19:17] thou has put all things under his feet
[1:19:22] all sheep and oxen
[1:19:25] and the Beast of the field yes
[1:19:32] and whatsoever passes through the paths
[1:19:35] of the scene
[1:19:37] oh Lord
[1:19:40] how excellent is thy name in all the
[1:19:43] Earth
[1:19:45] do you see it here and within the words
[1:19:48] of the Old Testament
[1:19:50] Jesus Christ
[1:19:54] now inherits all dominions
[1:19:58] so the first Adam lost
[1:20:00] where did we hear these words
[1:20:04] God spoke them to Adam and Genesis
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:13] no no
[1:20:18] Hebrews and verse 9.
[1:20:22] Hebrews 2.
[1:20:25] [Music]
[1:20:28] who was this
[1:20:30] but we see Jesus Jesus Remember verse 5
[1:20:34] of Psalms
[1:20:36] but thou has made him a little lower
[1:20:39] than the Angels
[1:20:41] it didn't mention the name of Jesus
[1:20:44] but now we're going to read between the
[1:20:46] lines
[1:20:47] and between verse 5 and 6 of the Psalms
[1:20:53] we're going to place Hebrews 2 9.
[1:20:56] now we're reading between the lines
[1:20:59] and Paul says but we see Jesus who was
[1:21:04] made a little lower than the angels
[1:21:13] He by the grace of God
[1:21:17] for every man
[1:21:19] that means
[1:21:23] from the time we're born
[1:21:25] we're on death row
[1:21:34] from the time
[1:21:38] but by the grace of God foreign
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:22:33] and one of the elders said unto me
[1:22:39] weep not no yores Behold The Lion of the
[1:22:43] tribe of Jesus
[1:23:02] was written
[1:23:04] a plan of God
[1:23:07] this book was called the Lamb's Book of
[1:23:10] Life
[1:23:12] and then it was seven parts
[1:23:14] of how we would be restored
[1:23:18] how he would bring Salvation to all his
[1:23:21] children
[1:23:23] salvation to the wheat seed salvation
[1:23:28] but judgment to the seed of the serpente
[1:23:33] and one of the elders verse five and
[1:23:35] five and one of the elders said unto me
[1:23:37] weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[1:23:40] Judah the root of David have prevailed
[1:23:43] to open the book and loose the Seven
[1:23:45] Seals around
[1:23:48] he
[1:24:29] salvation to that great denomination
[1:24:34] and when Israel rejected
[1:24:37] then this great Plan of Redemption
[1:24:40] the seven seal books this book with
[1:24:44] seven parts
[1:24:45] from the days of Jesus to the day we're
[1:24:49] living now
[1:24:50] seven parts
[1:24:55] so the first time the book was opened
[1:24:58] the Lamb's Book
[1:25:00] it was open to Israel
[1:25:03] to the Jewish people
[1:25:05] to them alone
[1:25:10] but when they rejected it
[1:25:12] once again
[1:25:14] the word of God says
[1:25:17] my word shall not return unto me voice
[1:25:25] everything that I wanted to fulfill
[1:25:29] in your life because you realize the
[1:25:33] Lamb's Book of Life is
[1:25:35] a book written to individuals it's a
[1:25:40] book written is
[1:25:44] the revelation of this Bible
[1:25:48] wasn't given to any denomination
[1:25:51] it's given to individuals
[1:25:54] who will be born again
[1:26:00] and the born-again children of God
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:04] to them it gives Revelation
[1:26:07] Jesus told Nicodemus
[1:26:11] unless you be born again you cannot see
[1:26:16] this Plan of Salvation
[1:26:19] you cannot see it is
[1:26:31] and one of the elders saith unto me
[1:26:33] verse 5.
[1:26:35] we've not behold the line of the tribe
[1:26:37] of Judah
[1:26:39] ese
[1:26:42] had prevailed to open the book
[1:26:45] that's true
[1:26:47] and to lose the Seven Seals
[1:26:52] verse five and five
[1:26:54] verse 5 of Revelations
[1:26:59] the year in this verse
[1:27:02] is about 30 A.D is
[1:27:08] Jesus begins his ministry
[1:27:11] at 30 years of age
[1:27:13] as the lion of the tribe of Jesus
[1:27:16] as king of the Jews and the lion first
[1:27:20] takes the Lion's Share
[1:27:24] Israel Israel the Fig Tree the Jewish
[1:27:28] people and he's opening the book and
[1:27:32] he's losing the seals to Israel yes
[1:27:36] but Israel rejected will be given to a
[1:27:41] gentile church
[1:27:42] at the cross of Calvary Revelations
[1:27:57] what Israel rejected
[1:27:59] would be given to a gentile church
[1:28:03] and the Old Testament shared that many
[1:28:07] times
[1:28:08] held the the allegory
[1:28:12] to the the shadow La Sombra that this
[1:28:16] would come to pass
[1:28:17] in the life of Joseph
[1:28:20] in the life of Jacob and Joseph's two
[1:28:24] sons
[1:28:27] go back and read it in the Old Testament
[1:28:30] the story very clear in your mind
[1:28:34] because there was a prophetic Shadow
[1:28:37] what would happen thousands of years
[1:28:40] later when Jesus would come when Israel
[1:28:45] would rejected the seven part is
[1:28:50] to restore them again
[1:28:55] where they were going to be scattered
[1:28:57] esparcidos
[1:29:08] for his father the old patriarch Jacob
[1:29:13] would give them the patriarchal
[1:29:16] blessings
[1:29:19] Jacob being a prophet
[1:29:22] and Joseph also Jose tambien brings his
[1:29:25] two sons
[1:29:26] now the custom was that the Elder son
[1:29:30] would be put at Jacob's right hand
[1:29:34] and the youngest son at his left
[1:29:37] then Jacob was to pray for the two boys
[1:29:41] but the eldest son
[1:29:44] would get the Lion's Share
[1:29:47] of all the wealth of the father
[1:29:52] and the youngest one he would just ask a
[1:29:55] blessing
[1:29:56] the Elvis would get everything
[1:30:02] your dad has one million dollars
[1:30:06] that's yours son your dad has 1 000 head
[1:30:10] of cattle
[1:30:13] you're the firstborn
[1:30:16] that's yours son if your dad has
[1:30:20] ten thousand acres of land
[1:30:24] that's yours the son the Elder son goes
[1:30:28] thank you
[1:30:29] I like it me gusta and then to the
[1:30:32] younger son he would say
[1:30:35] younger son
[1:30:37] your dad loves you
[1:30:39] and uh he knows you're a smart
[1:30:42] intelligent young man
[1:30:44] and you'll make it out in life
[1:30:51] and uh good luck
[1:30:53] that was it
[1:30:55] so Joseph lines up his two boys
[1:30:59] remember these two boys
[1:31:02] represents
[1:31:04] the eldest boys
[1:31:06] represents the Church of Israel
[1:31:10] the Jews the youngest boys
[1:31:14] represents a younger Church
[1:31:36] because his father Jacob is blind
[1:31:41] he don't know who is who
[1:31:47] Joseph knows that so no worries
[1:31:51] I got this taken care of
[1:31:55] they're here go ahead yes
[1:32:01] and as Joseph goes to pray for them
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:05] Jacob goes to pray
[1:32:11] he crosses his hands
[1:32:13] and he gives the Lion's Share to the
[1:32:17] younger boys
[1:32:21] this was custom and rituals
[1:32:24] do you realize what Jacob did
[1:32:28] was binding
[1:32:32] that Joseph would have to live by this
[1:32:36] that the two boys would have to go with
[1:32:39] this plan
[1:32:42] old patriarch was doing
[1:32:45] and Joseph said Dad don't do it
[1:32:50] I've already put the elders at your
[1:32:52] right hand
[1:32:54] Jacob said no Joseph
[1:32:58] don't you get it
[1:33:01] Hallelujah
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:34:05] so Revelations
[1:34:08] the years 30 ads
[1:34:11] Jesus begins his ministry
[1:34:14] Stadium at 30 years of age
[1:34:17] as the lion of the tribe of Jews
[1:34:21] King of the Jews
[1:34:23] and the lion is taking the Lion's Share
[1:34:28] which is Israel because it's Israel the
[1:34:31] fig tree
[1:34:34] and is opening the book
[1:34:36] and loosen the seals to Israel Israel
[1:34:42] and what Israel rejected
[1:34:44] it will be given to a gentile Church
[1:34:52] because though Jesus was the line of the
[1:34:54] tribe of Jews
[1:34:59] he changed Ministries
[1:35:02] when Jesus
[1:35:06] walked into the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:35:10] to pray for one hour
[1:35:13] he walked in King of the Jews
[1:35:29] he was now the Lamb of God
[1:35:33] the Savior Salvador
[1:35:37] changed
[1:35:41] but the plan hadn't changed
[1:35:44] that was a plan in the mind of God
[1:35:48] since the foundation of the world
[1:35:54] Revelations 5 6.
[1:35:56] and I beheld and low in the midst of the
[1:36:00] throne
[1:36:34] represents the prophetic Ministries that
[1:36:37] God rose up in every age
[1:36:40] and it says the seven eyes
[1:36:42] which are the seven spirits
[1:36:45] in other words the Holy Spirit working
[1:36:48] in every messenger and every age
[1:36:57] Revelations 5 6.
[1:37:01] is about three and a half years later
[1:37:06] from Revelations
[1:37:11] three and a half year difference
[1:37:14] watch how God wrote his book
[1:37:16] from verse
[1:37:22] it is over 2500 years
[1:37:28] and all the details of that lays in the
[1:37:31] Old Testament
[1:37:34] then from the angel of the Covenant
[1:37:37] to the days of Jesus is about another 2
[1:37:42] 000 years
[1:37:44] then from the days of the ministry of
[1:37:46] Jesus is the line of the tribe of Jews
[1:37:52] enters into the lamb Ministry
[1:37:56] it's only about three and a half years
[1:37:58] later
[1:38:00] verse 5 and 5 verse 5 of Revelations 5.
[1:38:05] the beginning of the Ministries
[1:38:11] verse six Mexico says this is Ministry
[1:38:16] finishing up is
[1:38:17] the Lamb of God and he's going soon
[1:38:22] to die on the cross cross of calves
[1:38:30] to give his life
[1:38:33] foreign
[1:38:35] God has accepted
[1:38:39] the life of Jesus Jesus and his death is
[1:38:50] he was only thinking about you so I mean
[1:38:53] this is
[1:39:01] in his mind was a plan
[1:39:03] he spoke his plan was the spoken word
[1:39:09] he wrote it in the book
[1:39:12] that he might reveal it to us later
[1:39:17] but he doesn't have to write things down
[1:39:21] to bring it to pass
[1:39:28] I've given you the example in the Book
[1:39:30] of Genesis
[1:39:33] Genesis 1 begins with in the beginning
[1:39:43] he did but you know when that was
[1:39:46] written
[1:39:47] about 1400 years after it was done
[1:39:51] so God brought this Earth to pass by his
[1:39:55] Spoken Word
[1:39:58] by his written word he let you know what
[1:40:00] happened
[1:40:04] and some people without Revelations
[1:40:07] they still don't know what happened
[1:40:09] living in 2023
[1:40:13] but his children
[1:40:18] because the god that created Heavens
[1:40:21] through a born-again experience
[1:40:31] Revelations five and six
[1:40:34] and I beheld and low in the midst of the
[1:40:37] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:40:40] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:40:42] had been slain
[1:40:51] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:40:54] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:40:56] into all the earth
[1:41:02] now
[1:41:04] prophecya isn't always future
[1:41:08] neither is Visions
[1:41:10] sometimes God allows us to see things
[1:41:13] that have already passed
[1:41:17] when John was seeing this Vision
[1:41:19] Revelations
[1:41:23] it was about 60 years
[1:41:27] after the death burial and resurrection
[1:41:30] of Jesus Christ
[1:41:33] you understand what that means
[1:41:36] that means what he was seeing is
[1:41:40] history it had already happened
[1:41:45] he was also there when it happened
[1:41:48] but though he was there okay
[1:41:54] between what he saw and experience
[1:41:58] and the vision he was seen
[1:42:01] he couldn't put them together
[1:42:06] he had been there in reality
[1:42:09] he was been given the vision
[1:42:15] but he thought the vision was something
[1:42:16] Future
[1:42:19] No John no one you were living the
[1:42:22] vision yourself
[1:42:24] as we are this morning
[1:42:31] right now
[1:42:32] in your life
[1:42:38] we can see ourselves
[1:42:47] repent and be baptized
[1:42:49] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:53] and you shall receive yes
[1:43:04] or Can someone say
[1:43:08] that's me it's right now it's all that
[1:43:12] means
[1:43:14] I am a manifestation of that spoken word
[1:43:18] so Revelations five and five
[1:43:23] Revelations five and six
[1:43:27] it's three and a half years later
[1:43:30] after Revelation is
[1:43:33] Jesus is now in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:43:37] to pray for one hour
[1:43:39] he entered the garden as king of the
[1:43:42] Jews
[1:43:45] and in one hour he came out the Lamb of
[1:43:49] God
[1:43:50] it was God in morphine it's a Greek word
[1:43:55] it means changing forms
[1:43:59] but he was not changing forms as before
[1:44:06] [Music]
[1:44:10] to a seed that was placed in the womb of
[1:44:13] a virgin
[1:44:14] and
[1:44:16] God created a body to live
[1:44:24] he was not changing forms
[1:44:27] but here he was changing Ministries
[1:44:30] from here is taken to Calvary
[1:44:34] to crucifixion days
[1:44:40] he rises the third day
[1:44:43] as it was spoken in the mouth of the
[1:44:45] prophets
[1:44:47] and is amongst his disciples for 40 days
[1:44:54] Revelations
[1:44:57] is about the year 33 34.
[1:45:03] and we now have a symbol yeah
[1:45:10] with seven horns
[1:45:12] seven
[1:45:15] spirits it's a symbol it's a symbol of a
[1:45:19] sacrifice don't sacrificial a slain lamb
[1:45:22] before the altar of God
[1:45:30] they're in that Dimension where God
[1:45:32] Alone dwells
[1:45:36] for the symbol of the lamb now lays
[1:45:39] is where for 4 000 years
[1:45:45] Lucifer would come into the presence of
[1:45:47] God
[1:45:48] and would stand to accuse the sons and
[1:45:52] dogs
[1:45:58] he was cast down
[1:46:00] never again to enter the Before the
[1:46:04] Throne of God
[1:46:06] never again to bring accusations
[1:46:10] about URI before the father
[1:46:14] and in that spot where the devil once
[1:46:17] stood
[1:46:19] now lays the Lamb of God
[1:46:27] a healing bomb
[1:46:30] um
[1:46:35] perfection
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:46:56] and the year
[1:46:57] was about 35 A.D foreign
[1:47:08] Israel
[1:47:27] Revelations 5 7.
[1:47:29] reads like this
[1:47:31] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:47:34] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:47:36] throne
[1:47:38] Revelations 5 7. I'm going to dare to
[1:47:42] say is the year 1963.
[1:47:46] between verse 6 and 7.
[1:47:49] it's over 1900 years
[1:47:55] we're now in the 20th century
[1:47:59] he took the book
[1:48:01] it's now February the 28th 1963.
[1:48:07] in a mountain called Sunset
[1:48:11] that's where it was opened
[1:48:13] not the first time
[1:48:18] not that it was closed in between either
[1:48:23] but what was open in this 20th century
[1:48:27] it's our understanding
[1:48:29] of this divine plan
[1:48:32] that got lost for for about over 1500
[1:48:36] years
[1:48:38] you realize from the days of the
[1:48:41] crucifixion
[1:48:44] that the New Testament didn't even get
[1:48:47] written
[1:48:52] for 50 or 60 years later
[1:48:55] and it didn't stay in the hands of God's
[1:48:58] children very long
[1:49:01] because then there began to rise up
[1:49:05] Constantine
[1:49:07] a pagan Roman Emperor um
[1:49:13] who wanted to merge
[1:49:17] Pagan Rome with this new release
[1:49:20] and make it work better for him
[1:49:23] and it finally came to be the Roman the
[1:49:26] Roman Catholic Church
[1:49:32] took away the writings
[1:49:36] they took away this new testament
[1:49:38] writings
[1:49:41] Peter and John de Pablo
[1:49:45] John had given his life
[1:49:48] to put together this new testimony
[1:49:53] this Lamb's Book of Life is
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:02] when Rome became a powerful Church
[1:50:08] they
[1:50:11] gave them creeds
[1:50:15] they gave him one little verse and said
[1:50:17] it means this is
[1:50:20] and for 1500 years
[1:50:23] God's children
[1:50:25] had no books
[1:50:37] throughout those Dark Ages when they
[1:50:39] were being fed to the Lions
[1:50:42] when they were being sawn in half
[1:50:46] when they were being killed is
[1:50:53] how did they make it
[1:50:58] they were born again
[1:51:01] they received the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:03] ghosts
[1:51:05] because being born again and receiving
[1:51:08] the Holy Ghost
[1:51:09] doesn't require you to even know how to
[1:51:12] read
[1:51:15] it just requires
[1:51:19] um
[1:51:22] blessed are the poor and Spirits
[1:51:26] in Matthew 5.
[1:51:30] the blessed are they that mourn
[1:51:31] International
[1:51:36] for they shall be confident
[1:51:42] IAL
[1:51:44] inherit the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:51:52] it's good to know how to read and write
[1:51:54] is
[1:51:57] but as Jesus was preaching here in
[1:51:59] Matthew 5.
[1:52:01] and you know it was his teaching on how
[1:52:04] to get to Perfection
[1:52:09] blessed are those
[1:52:13] who learned how to read and write
[1:52:15] because they will
[1:52:18] what
[1:52:20] I don't know I haven't read that in the
[1:52:22] Bible yet
[1:52:25] now there is a scripture in Revelations
[1:52:32] and read the Prophecies of this book
[1:52:38] but when they didn't have a bookness
[1:52:44] Peacemaker Pacifica
[1:52:48] and when your troubles
[1:52:50] bring great grief to you
[1:52:55] he said that's okay
[1:53:06] I don't know how to read Lord you don't
[1:53:08] have to you just know how to lay down
[1:53:11] you just have to know how to lay down
[1:53:13] quietly in my presence here
[1:53:20] you just have to know how to open the
[1:53:22] door
[1:53:30] Revelations 5 and 8.
[1:53:40] the years 1963.
[1:53:44] and when he had taken the book
[1:53:47] The Four beasts this is the Lambos
[1:53:51] and the 420 Elders fell down before the
[1:53:56] Lambs
[1:53:58] having every one of them Harps and
[1:54:01] golden vials full of Voters which are
[1:54:04] the prayers of the Saints
[1:54:07] did you notice
[1:54:09] Revelation 5 8.
[1:54:12] repeats again
[1:54:14] this time it's the lamb who's taken the
[1:54:17] book
[1:54:19] the years 1963.
[1:54:22] lamb is once again opening the book
[1:54:27] revealing the Seven Seals
[1:54:30] so between verse seven
[1:54:35] Ocho verse seven we read verse and he
[1:54:39] came and took the book even in the right
[1:54:41] hand of him that sat upon the throne
[1:54:46] verse 8 says
[1:55:02] Los Santos
[1:55:07] so between verse 7 and verse 8.
[1:55:14] about 17 days passed come on
[1:55:19] see how this Bible's written
[1:55:22] between verse
[1:55:26] close to 2500 years
[1:55:29] but what what happened in between
[1:55:33] you have to go back regular
[1:55:37] I'm sorry reading from Genesis on
[1:55:41] between verse two and three and four
[1:55:43] four
[1:55:47] all the way to verse five
[1:55:49] another almost 2 000 years
[1:56:03] Revelations
[1:56:28] and they sung a new song
[1:56:31] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:56:35] and to open the seals
[1:56:38] you know who that is
[1:56:40] essay once the book was opened again in
[1:56:43] this 20th century
[1:56:57] and they sang a new song
[1:57:00] Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:57:04] and to open the seals around
[1:57:06] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:57:15] they not only see that the lamb has
[1:57:18] taken the book
[1:57:20] but they believe is able to open this
[1:57:24] Plan of Salvation
[1:57:27] there's seven part plans
[1:57:33] because that was slain
[1:57:36] and has redeemed us
[1:57:42] and people with revelation
[1:57:46] we believe
[1:57:47] there's power okay
[1:57:54] we believe it's wonderful working power
[1:57:57] milagross
[1:58:03] and we believe that there isn't anything
[1:58:05] that God can't do
[1:58:10] he says and the Bible says then he has
[1:58:11] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:58:15] every kindred
[1:58:16] tongue and people and Nations
[1:58:25] it's Revelations 5 9.
[1:58:30] is 2023. yes I know
[1:58:35] the day is a Sunday
[1:58:40] and it happens to be 11 48 now
[1:58:43] in Revelations
[1:58:55] we are in a bribery
[1:58:59] someone would say no no no no no brother
[1:59:03] Daniel there's only seven churches
[1:59:05] Philadelphia
[1:59:07] [Music]
[1:59:16] to a bright age
[1:59:19] in a message called modern events
[1:59:29] with patience we have to wait for this
[1:59:34] for the prophecies that's promised
[1:59:36] foreign
[2:00:25] and write it in a book for us
[2:00:31] he says the author has done this before
[2:00:35] we wait to see him do it again
[2:00:41] you look at the calendar
[2:00:43] to find out the day of year you're
[2:00:46] living
[2:00:49] at what age we're living here
[2:00:57] we're living in the brightness
[2:01:14] second hand
[2:01:16] is the blood that was shed for us
[2:01:29] and sending Daughters of God
[2:01:33] if you have Revelations
[2:01:35] are saying Worthy is
[2:01:39] Jesus Christ
[2:01:41] not worthy is any man
[2:01:45] not worthy is the man
[2:01:47] not worthy is a prophet
[2:01:54] God has called has called men to these
[2:01:57] to these Ministries
[2:02:02] Worthy is the Lamb of God
[2:02:05] Jesus Christ Our Lord
[2:02:08] savior Salvador
[2:02:11] baptized he was lying he's King of Kings
[2:02:19] indeed has sent us
[2:02:23] as Paul thought as taught in Ephesians
[2:02:26] 4.
[2:02:28] and God didn't make the Apostle Paul
[2:02:31] didn't make up this fightful ministry
[2:02:35] he saw these characteristics in the life
[2:02:38] of Jesus Christ
[2:02:40] and he said these are the gifts that God
[2:02:43] has that the father sent down to his
[2:02:45] children
[2:02:47] the gifts of his own Ministry
[2:02:50] when he was here on the Earth
[2:02:54] he said I give you Apostles
[2:02:59] prophets evangelists pastors
[2:03:06] to help you in your Christian world
[2:03:12] to get advice
[2:03:19] in your daily life and overcome every
[2:03:23] strong temperature
[2:03:25] because apostles
[2:03:29] prophets revealed
[2:03:31] evangelists
[2:03:33] a pastors nurture Los pastures
[2:03:38] explained those maestros explicative we
[2:03:40] need them all but only the Holy Spirit
[2:03:46] revelation
[2:03:49] but he did choose to use these
[2:03:51] Ministries
[2:03:55] so you don't come to church
[2:03:58] to be saved
[2:04:00] that's something Jesus did for you on
[2:04:03] the cross
[2:04:04] Jesus is
[2:04:11] to be encouraged
[2:04:13] [Music]
[2:04:15] so that once you are discipled into this
[2:04:18] glorious Faith
[2:04:20] as a disciple of Christ
[2:04:23] you can help build somebody else
[2:04:27] you can help bring Revelation to someone
[2:04:29] else
[2:04:32] you can help families gather together
[2:04:36] you can be the pastor in your home
[2:04:39] and nurture your children
[2:04:45] revelation
[2:05:02] we love them this morning
[2:05:07] God by his infinite Mercy Infinity
[2:05:12] is is teaching us how to read between
[2:05:15] the lines
[2:05:19] but what you see between the lines
[2:05:25] everything is laying in this blessed
[2:05:27] words
[2:05:32] you need to grab a prophecy here
[2:05:35] an example there then they start
[2:05:38] blending together
[2:05:41] this fits between that is
[2:05:44] then as you start reading it
[2:05:47] then you see this great plans
[2:05:52] and the Revelation strikes
[2:06:00] welcome
[2:06:02] you know why even David a man after
[2:06:04] God's Own Heart Is
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:10] because it wasn't available for him
[2:06:13] to be born again and he was still living
[2:06:16] under the old under the under the old
[2:06:20] birth
[2:06:23] and the old bird came all the way down
[2:06:25] from Adam to him
[2:06:28] I am the first Adam had fallen
[2:06:31] so if we stay under that old birth
[2:06:34] anointing
[2:06:38] we will fall to the same sin they fell
[2:06:41] in the beginning
[2:06:46] but if we're born again
[2:06:51] thank you
[2:06:53] and take the advice of the second hand
[2:06:57] Jesus Christ
[2:06:59] when he tells us he didn't fall
[2:07:02] but he rose
[2:07:05] you're born again and follow him
[2:07:08] you won't fall into all the old
[2:07:11] Temptations
[2:07:26] and I'm going to read you once again
[2:07:30] if I can find it here
[2:07:45] I've read it before
[2:07:46] I'm going to read it again
[2:07:54] and uh it's meant a lot to me yes
[2:07:57] it was back April foreign
[2:08:03] and
[2:08:06] um
[2:08:07] I felt like
[2:08:09] I just wasn't getting anything
[2:08:12] no anointing I was tired I was falling
[2:08:17] asleep
[2:08:18] I wasn't feeling good about it
[2:08:21] I said Lord I need a message
[2:08:24] to share with for some services are
[2:08:27] coming up
[2:08:29] and I just felt like I couldn't break
[2:08:31] through and Touch the Hem of this gun he
[2:08:34] said
[2:08:41] just pray for a moment
[2:08:43] I was actually feeling kind of defeated
[2:08:46] and as I'm sitting there
[2:08:50] I felt like someone in my heart said
[2:08:52] pick up your pen since
[2:08:57] foreign
[2:09:56] [Music]
[2:10:27] [Music]
[2:10:44] and it's just you and him
[2:10:48] juntos

[2:10:57] Joshua he's in the house
[2:11:03] the song they would like to sing here
[2:11:06] before we close and her brother would
[2:11:08] come up and take this place
[2:11:11] it's entitled he's in the house
[2:11:15] it begins like this
[2:11:17] little girl was lying there
[2:11:20] people all were weeping
[2:11:23] they just laughed at Jesus
[2:11:27] said she's only
[2:11:29] as he took her by the hand she began to
[2:11:33] live again
[2:11:35] some began to praise the Lord
[2:11:38] some began to sing and then the chorus
[2:11:41] says
