precious faith it's good to hear the testimony of God's healing power and his virtue for brother canning talking to brother Angel he'd been sick for a while also quite a few days and by the grace of God he pushed that aside and he came to service tonight and I'm sure there's a great blessing for him here because that's what faith is about faith moves us when our body don't want to move so we are thankful he was able to make it tonight and he and if he couldn't have made it God knows that too but he also knows that he did make it God is a God uh he's a Healer the Bible says that by his stripes in the Book of Matthew of course it documents the great healing revivals and that's the way the first seal opened up part one was with a great healing Revival and of course for us now it's history and we don't see the pattern of both of them Jesus when he came when the Bible says that his Fame went throughout all Syria Jesus and they brought the sick people to him those with diverse diseases and torments problems in their minds depression depression they had PTSD back then too only they didn't know what to call it but Jesus knew what you call it he says you're possessed and tormented with devils and then it says and he healed them the Centurion came to him and approached him he was a gentile it wasn't time for the Gentiles to approach him he said I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof but I've been watching you and and and uh I don't want to brag or anything but I I understand how Authority works when I tell someone to do something if it's one man or a thousand men they better do it and you know what I can you don't have to come to my house you just speak the word Because by the time I get home if I'm right about you then when I get home he's going to be healed because you can command okay just speak the words Jesus Jesus a healing Revival the Bible says he says that Jesus they brought great multitudes followed them and it says and he healed them all thousands and thousands like the meetings in Durban Africa 30 40 100 000 people and Jesus Again by his stripes healing for the church and and what if you get sick brother Daniel Lane God takes you home the greatest healing you see the healing in this flesh is just a sign of a greater healing Divine Healing for this flesh the body can get sick again but it speaks of the greatest healing a body change so we're thankful to God turn with me once again and we'll be reading from Saint John 10 yes and this would be part six I believe of the white horse rider in the Days of Elijah one through seven again a parable for the prophecy was that Jesus would speak everything in a parable and without a parable he wouldn't but when he spoke he would be speaking things to us in other words he'd be revealing to us how how Adam and Eve failures so that you wouldn't have to follow the same way but it also revealed that the Adam and Eve were in a process of a son and a daughter being trained on how to handle the spoken word so we know how they felt yes and we know the purpose why God's revealing that to us again enter into this friendship with the father and have the same relationship that the Holy Spirit can [Music] and he gave us the exam of the power of God but in total holy control in total control verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold but climeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robbery so we have a door we've got a sheep and we and we have a shepherd verse two but he that enters in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep through him the porter openness so now we've got a door we've got a Corral there's a thief and now there is a door to come in through and he that enters is The Shepherd of the sheep says to him the porter openness another position could it be someone else and the sheep hear his voice listen to him the Border openings of the Sheepfold do better pastors out of an enclosed area to total freedom and verse 4 and when he put it forth his sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers this Parable Jesus spoke unto them Jesus they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them and remember when Jesus said father I thank you that there's great teaching that I just taught no one understood that's not your average teacher the average teacher wants to do teaching and everyone say I got it it was perfect I was understandable then then Jesus said unto number seven again verily verily I say unto I am the door of the sheep and he said he was the door in this Parable he was also the Shepherd in this person it was also the porter he was also the voice just like he was God on the throne [Music] just like he would just like he was the lion of the tribe of Jesus just like he was the Lamb of God just like he's the great Holy Spirit once I come to the son of man all for one purpose to get closer to you change forms and change forms keep descending don't get closer to you so that you could learn to hear his voice regardless of what role he was unfolding but you could look through the Bible God who gave instructions says read your Bible and if you don't see Jesus Christ some forms go back and read it again let's pray heavenly father thank you we give you honor and God bless your word to the hearts of your children in Jesus name amen the white horse rider in the Days of Elijah and the pale horse rider in the Days of Elijah and our subject is who has believed our reports and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed I know you understand that's Isaiah 53. so Isaiah 53 is what then part one the opening of the first season a new testament a new covenant the white horse rider was the first coming of Christ and that Elijah was John the Baptist yes we've read in Matthew where Jesus identified and the other prophecies that identified John also so we realize that the Bible has patterns in it because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so that the first coming of Christ Jesus himself in Matthew 11. reveal to us that the writer began then this white horse riders and he said it began in the days of John the Baptist that's exactly the pattern of today this is the Lamb's Book of Life how did this book begins well throughout the Old Testament it was foreshadowed it was it was it was foreshadowed with the with the sacrifice of every single lamp it was foreshadowed with a sacrifice of a of an innocent lamb once a year all the sins of Israel foreign [Music] and now how God is revealing it to our hearts you take away all our doubts that he has done a work on Calvary there was prophesied throughout the Old Testament foreign foreign [Music] because you know what on the other side even the animals where the ram gave the testimony when he went beyond the curtain of time and they wrote it up in a magazine Christian magazine and a man a brother sent him a little note I was really enjoying your testimony until you said you had a horse you said you felt something lick your hand and it was your dog he said in heaven where is scripture for that I hope you know dogs he says well brother he says you know in the Book of Revelations that God came with all his Saints on white horses and they came from Heaven he said so to say it's not in the Bible it is in the Bible you see okay we read the Bible but we don't understand this new testament this New Testament is the Lamb's Book of Life is in Saint John chapter one in San Juan Capitol Uno you turn with me Saint John 1 and verse 35. and it reads like this and again the next day after John Stewart and two of his disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the Lamb of God he said yes so then what's this book all about this New Testament is then the Lamb's Book is it is so we we must come to a place where we can understand this this book we see that Jesus Christ was God's land in Luke chapter two in Lucas beginning at verse 8. Luke 2 and verse 8. look as those it says like this and you've all read it and they were in the same country Shepherds abide in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid yes and the angel said unto them fear not behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people so foreign well he he was coming in this ministry as the Lamb of God for all people the Jews the Gentiles white black brown Blanco this was the ministry of the Lamb of God and that Ministry it came only for Israel but when they rejected it a new ministry would rise to take the message and bring Salvation the Jews rejected now would be offered to all people he says For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord okay Jesus Christ the Lamb of God the Savior to all people Salvador the Lamb's Book of Life did not Jesus bring life wasn't it life that they rejected then what happened the eternal life that had been offered was given to a gentile people a New Testament Church to be a savior to all people but not all would receive would we would would receive it so this New Testament is indeed the Lamb's Book of Life because it's the it's the lamb who is the only one that can reveal it remember Revelations let's turn for a momentum foreign El Cordero who was it that opened this book Jesus Christ the Lamb of God in that form they changed forms many times but when when he when he went from the angel of the Covenant and change forms and and God placed a dermatized seed in the womb of a little virgin um and Christ was born it transforms once again and when he becomes he started a Ministry of the Lion of the tribe of Jesus that was the plan they rejected that was the tree that was rejected okay but when Jesus goes to Gethsemane he didn't change forms again foreign you might think what was wrong with them would you believe me that they were living under a lot of stress tired and in one hour he went in King of the Jews and it came out but when the pastors that had this encounter with these angels they said where is he that's born what was it a new testament was being written this was the Lamb's Book of Life the world knows in the New Testament the world thinks it's just history no but this book is this book is the Lamb's Book Parables is hidden a revelation a revelation that takes us back into his presence a revelation that reveals a plan for me a revelation that restores it's called being born again the father looks forward the father looks forward a very child to be born so he can have start so he can start unfolding and growing in a relationship with that one that's just been born so even after we're born again it takes a while to understand how special you really are in the eyes of God I had my first person when he was born oh my goodness it was just so wonderful of course I didn't change most of the diapers and then about the first six or seven months they don't really know they have a dad are they just looking for Mama yeah yeah and I'd feel bad I said this guy doesn't like me don't judge on a man I didn't know no no no I didn't realize that I have to I had to nurture him and let him grow up at times I would forget that I'm the adult in this relationship and then about 9 10 months 12 months 12 years 12 months old all of a sudden he wakes up and it's like hey you're you're a lot of fun to be with yeah I'm feeling better I said finally he loves me um foreign this is the Lamb's Book of Life this new testament no testamento is the opening of the first sealed and it holds the Revelation revelation of all seven parts we read it in Matthew 11. we're Jesus himself Jesus declared part one open declaration and the Elijah Ministries had finished already John was in prison but he said this John that's in prison he says a prophet I say to you and more than a problem because he was a forerunner he was the Elijah that Malachi for spoken the first Elijah because Malachi 4.6 speaks of both the first and second coming um Elijah would turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children first it was turning the hearts of the fathers to the children the Jewish Orthodox church trying to turn its heart to a new testamental a man in the spirit and power of Elijah who revealed that detail you didn't read that in Malachi foreign Juan he says he's going to fulfill Malachi foreign always place a comma and be patient with God because every question you have foreign it began with the opening of the first seal it begins with part one of a great restoration but laying within this new testament place all seven Parts not just the present but the future and the Revelation to be able to see it with eyes of understanding Matthew 11. Jesus taught us Jesus about his first coming but he wasn't teaching us I am coming here he was teaching I am here so this Parables what's happening as Jesus was speaking about it and they couldn't see it it wasn't revealed to them no foreign and how he raked those churches over the coals he said we're looking for another Elijah to come yes people are screaming amen and they don't realize he's not talking future he's telling you it's happening right now it took a revelation to push away the man and see the pattern of God's word and we caught it wait a minute that's you brother Brian the denomination said just like in the days of Jesus wait a minute yes you're trying to say you're that man ain't you and they close their doors to him like they did to Jesus see how the patterns you've shown us the sign of the promise yes God rich in Mercy but Matthew 11 wasn't the only place where Jesus spoke of this first seal that opened Saint John 12. Saint John chapter 12. and we'll jump ahead to verse 26. and again Jesus speaking in parables let's start at verse 23.3 he said Philip cometh and tells Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered saying The Hours come that the son of man should be glorified in other words death burial Resurrection verily verily I sent you except the corn of wheat fall on the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit is talking about himself and it was going to happen real soon just days or weeks away present truth happening as he was speaking he's the love of his life he that hateth is life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal the end of this plan of God he said If any man serve me then let him follow me servitude will cause you to follow him and where I am going to show also my servant Beast If any man serve me him will my father honor me padre then he says now is my soul trouble and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause he said father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorified it again John heard the voice the people therefore that stood bye they said it thundered John said no it was a voice the multitudes around there just the religious people said no no it sounded like it thundered Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes what is the thunder okay it's the voice of God that's what a prophet told us in this day adding detail to this scripture they said the people therefore that stood by and heard it said it thundered that's how God hit it but how you revealed it was once again to the voice of a prophet and more than a prophet a forerunner Elijah he said of course we all know what a thunder is foreign salvation for all people through Jesus Christ The Curse had been broken we're all born under that curse it is a natural birth that's the curse this is [Music] changes the way we've been reading our Bibles Deliver Us delivers us from all fears this new testamental this New Testament is the Lamb's books this New Testament is the is the book of the savior of the whole world and Jesus came and he spoke at all in Parables and in Matthew 11 25 he said father I thank you that you have hidden these things makes us to believe that these are you wouldn't think of a child as this this little baby here is wise improved no you wouldn't refer to it like that neither would you say it it's dumb and irresponsible it's a child so why isn't Prudence men and women he says and he said father I thank you he has hidden this from the eyes of the wise men and women but you're revealing it but he's not talking babes Naturals he's talking babe Supernatural he's talking about people who have been born again a supernatural birth an experience with Jesus Crystal he said I thank you but there is that you're gonna that you're revealing your word too and even though Jesus was one of the greatest teachers Jesus they didn't understand them but he later reveals to us why that it was already written in the word that he would speak in Parables and that these Parables would actually be prophecies and many of these Parables when he was here in his fleshly boss many of The Parables as he spoke them much very moment hmm the very minute the moment he was speaking in Parables he was teaching them things that were happening right there and in every Parable he was revealing something there was there was a divinely revealed mystery Truth for us there in the parable of the sower he taught us in great details that this human race has two fathers one is one is he was really teaching us of two churches really represented a young Church rising up a gentile Church and the older son that had been there all his life represented the Jewish Orthodox Church that though they were in the father's house all the way from the days of Moses to the days of Jesus claiming to be Abraham yet the parable revealed to us they were never able to take the fatted calf and have a good old-fashioned Pentecostal Revival true worship and praise to recognize himself and when the father went to the eldest son and he told them all these years I've labored under ten commandments and and I've actually helped kill people that were in adultery just for you I've helped persecute the liarsos all this I did for you you never killed the fatty cat for me and had a big Revival he said you've been with me all this time he says and all that I have is yours and you could have taken it anytime you wanted and had an old-fashioned Revival but the parable was really of the old Orthodox church and a New Testament Church at the opening of part one and it all been prophesied with types Shadows Saint John chapter 3. beginning at verse 1. there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews foreign we know it was so it's more just than just him but there was many of the priests now the teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him [Music] we know that God sent you that you're a prophet men like demons who were high-ranking members of the Pentecostal movement [Music] one of them [Music] they couldn't see the pattern of God's word they wanted him to continue healing the people so that so that America could be great again so that no one would ever get sick again but it wasn't God's plan God wants us to be born again so he can take us out of this body this is a body of death the Bible says Flesh and Blood this Israel what will inherit it you the person on the inside you the predestiness foreign brings your inheritance right to your feet Jesus answered and serum to verily verily I say unto you verse 3 except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus was still at another level a legal level um and yet he was a ruler he was considered a great teacher in Israel and yet he was a very carnal man but he was be but he had just been given an opportunity how can a man be born when he is old he was speaking of himself can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I sin to do except the man be born of water and of spirit Jesus and and baptized and you come out of that one repented your life surrendered to Jesus Jesus and then God gives you the Holy Spirit and it begins a born-again experience it happened right there went in sincerely repentance and I want to tell you sincerely that you came out a born again baby videos God heals rich in Mercy he said except come man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God is Jesus realized Nicodemus still wasn't getting it so he says okay let me tell you this I said listen now more details want you to understand this Nicodemus he said that which is born of the flesh anybody here ever been born in the flesh like maybe everybody and that which is born of the spirit is how God is drawing us back into expressions without a spirit or birth a born-again experience you cannot see the kingdom but to be born again then God begins opening the eyes if you're there while the babies it's going to open its eyes he opened his eyes he's alive and God will continue videos he said all that the father has given me then Jesus tells us Marvel not that I said unto me shall be born again he said the wind bloweth where it listed so now he's trying to explain to clinical demons Marvel not that I said unto you must be born again now what about this born-again experience add some more detail for me he said okay he said okay listen this the wind bloweth in other words where it wants to go you hear the sound of it but but yet you can't tell from where it comes and by the sound of it you can't tell where it's going to then he says remember it's a parable but I'm trying to explain it so everyone will catch it he's saying foreign they can't tell you one word came they can't tell you where it's going if the born-again believer can just tell me I got it I've been born again where did it come from I don't know but I've heard that certain sound and I'll never forget that voice I'll never forget the first time God called me and I heard and I've been born again Nicodemus answered verse 9 and said unto him and these things Jesus answered and said unto him a master it is barely verily I say unto you we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our Witnesses if I'd have told you Earthly things and you believe not um how shall ye believe if I tell you have anything and hidden in all the Parables of Jesus that the world takes literally naturally in there then today is here in the Heavenly things and there is the voice of God speaking to his children speaking to us of a better world God's Gathering his family and he's doing it by Revelation and he's doing it by causing us to be born again [Music] that many are still not being born in what's called this message this new testament more testamental that's written is the Lamb's Book of Life is and in these seven parts of this book is revealed to us all the small steps many of them no one will see you take them muchos they're so small but they're so powerful when you take one take another use we're being changed to go back to turn with me to Luke chapter 2. Luke chapter 2 verse 10. once again and the angel said unto them fear for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be bring us to all people it was the ministry of the Lamb of God and yet it was the lion that was speaking on it Jesus Jesus was prophesying the Angels were speaking Los Angeles this ministerial change that would take place they said For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord would wash away the curse of the flesh birth in everyone who could release and then and now you're you are born again I'm the spirit of God you were always a son and daughter you're always a seed of God but the born-again experience makes you a manifested son and daughter of God now the Lamb's Book of Life it's not only a book of Salvation it's also a book of wrath for all who would choose to reject this Lamb of God the sacrifice made for all people is turn with me to Revelations chapter 6. and verse 15. this is the Sixth Seal which began in verse 12. so we're going to jump to verse 15. and it says in the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich man and the chief captains can the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains this is speaking of of of every King a very PR a very president a very prime minister of of every uh of every billionaire on planet Earth and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him yes for the great day of his wrath is and she's in the wedding supper of the Lamb yes while the world is in a Great Tribulation like the world has never seen Revelation 6 15-17 the Wrath of the Lamb comes down upon the Earth because the people who who are still here with their lifestyle they say listen we have no King but Lucifer even like the high priest of Israel that day before Pontius Pilate they so wanted Jesus dead Jesus muerto that he rose up in toe Pontius Pilates don't call him the king of the Jews for we have no kids and it repeats again God yes Opening Our Eyes to recognize are they in its message and to recognize the simple steps of how we can grow and be like Jesus foreign Lord Jesus Jesus walk us back into your interview but we know that these little steps is changing US foreign and we change from Mortal to immortality well we won't see death but in reality our eyes have been fixed on life because we've been partaking of the tree of life for this Lamb's Book of Life we can see our names we realize we're a part of you as Eternal as you are returning you said it was verse 48 of Matthew amen amen God bless you [Music] thank you missing this on peace of God cover me [Music] cover me covered me through the weather [Music] I'm figured [Music] I thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] cover me with my name is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] look over me when my faith is gone [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you for that [Music] for them [Music] [Music] leave your [Music] money [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] mess with our heads foreign thankful with you Lord [Music] because every day show us your greatness [Music] you've seen us [Music] look you're small folder help us Lord to remain faithful in your word Lord [Music] thank you Father thank you Lord because you've loved us since the foundation of the world and to this day you've kept us you've helped us till now [Music] bless every brother and every sister has been able to come with with the only intention of pleasing you [Music] to be able to learn more from you Lord [Music] thank you for your word Lord increase our faith [Music] like those great men of of the old [Music] was [Music] in this year divine plan that you've made for your children [Music] that have stood up for your word help us learn my brother Danny Lord help them renew his strengths and each and every one of us our brethren that weren't able to come you know every situation [Music] and we place everything in you that you take us with our well-being to our homes foreign [Music] we place everything in your hands [Music] we place everything in the new Lord Jesus Christ thank you Lord did I sing this last song will be dismissed it is [Music] all right [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it might have been married [Music] [Music] is [Music] me taking the name [Music] [Music] everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
