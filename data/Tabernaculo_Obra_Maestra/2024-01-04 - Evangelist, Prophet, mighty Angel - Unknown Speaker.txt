Year we're thankful once again and uh the world man science uh they've put us on a time a Time Clock uh we live by a watch they there's 24 hours in a day we're creatures of time until we're born again then then uh the light strikes us and we realize we're not creatures of time and and the more we hunger and thirst for his righteousness the the the more we have refilling after refilling then we actually have moments moments where we feel like maybe I'm not a creature of time maybe I don't have to yield myself uh to to a 24-hour day maybe I can find moments where I can get lost in his Pres presence where I don't know if it's a.m. I don't know if it's pm. I don't know if it's winter I don't know if it's summer I don't know if it's spring I don't know if it's fall we get we can get lost in the moment all we know at that moment is that we're in his presence and he's touching our hearts he's changing our minds he's here he in this house made of Flesh and he wants us to get into his presence let's begin this year with this desire Lord give me more moments where I get lost in your presence at church at home at work even if you're on vacation Lord give me more moments where I get lost in your presence tonight we begin this year speaking uh on a on a title Jesus evangelist prophet and mighty Angel turn with me to Matthew chapter 4 Matthew chapter 4 begins with the temptation of Jesus on Mount Temptation Jesus is led up by the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil now he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights as as a physical man the Bible says was a hungered great hunger great thirst then the tap then the tempter came to him but the tempter approached him thinking he would use the same method that he used on Adam and Eve and that is he used scripture but he twisted it he changed that one little word he he shares a portion to the comma but wouldn't read Beyond it that's why we must be Bible readers so that when the devil is trying to give you a scripture and he puts a period where there where the Bible has a comma you can catch who it is that's trying to talk to [Music] you because he too uses the same methods he's always used since the beginning and he began with Jesus he looks at him he says this man is hungry very hungry so I'm going to start there with him and in verse three he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for we realize that your Hebrews 13 and8 the same yesterday today and forever and we also realize that the devil he repeats the way he's always worked since the beginning and Open the Eyes of our understanding that we'll see when it's the devil talking and Lord catch when it's your Holy Spirit speaking to us too we thank you now continue to Open the Eyes of understanding in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated in verse four the Bible said but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so Satan recited a portion of the scripture but then God took him back to the original word The Original Seed and he told them but but man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Satan told him if thou be the Son of God the very way he answered him proved that he was the son of God that he was the word made flesh but the devil wasn't done he had took one shot at him then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and Seth him on a pinnacle of the temple and then again he says if thou be the Son of God in other words even though God even though Jesus had quoted him the word exactly and stayed on the word Satan was Satan wasn't convinced he said that doesn't prove to me that you're the Son of God if you're the Son of God cast thyself down who who who would listen to anyone that says if if you're who you say you are throw yourself off this Cliff [Music] here and then he says for it is written he shall give his angels car charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thy Dash thy foot against a stone it it was a prophecy of the prophets but it wasn't the prophecy so so it so that Jesus could be Reckless Reckless no No No Reckless he said so he saids so the scripture wasn't written so that we could tempt God no the scripture was written so that when trouble strikes when Trouble Comes you'll know that he'll be on the scene to protect you to lift you up to watch over you it's like those Cults P Pentecostal groups that that would actually in their services have deadly vipers in their hands poisonous snakes and they would handle them in the in in the front of the service and they still do it today and they quote Mark 16 they shall take up deadly serpents and it shall not harm them but the prophecy wasn't so we could be so we could be Reckless and tempt God no that's not where the prophecy was given no the prophecies were of the word of God were given so that by faith we could be assured that when trouble strikes when the devil brings a Temptation that God has promised that he'd be with you even in you at that moment Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God so Jesus is telling us that the that the Prophecies of the prophets where we're promis protection where where we are promised protection he it's not those prophecies are not given to us to tempt God those prophecies are given so that our faith can hold on to that prophecy so that our faith can anchor on something he said by my stripes you are healed he didn't say it so you could go go purposely and drink some kind of a poison to prove God but the prophecy is there so that if you were to drink something poisonous un knowing to yourself then God has made you a promise by his stripes we are healed again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain show them all the kingdoms of the world and Glory of them you see this tactic it worked in Eden and Eve fell to it and Adam fell to this this tactic worked for the prophet balam and he fell to this tactic so he figures I'll use it again and the devil say saith unto him all these things I will give thee if if thou will fall down and worship me [Music] Jesus saith unto him get thee hands Satan see the devil kept telling him if thou be the Son of God if thou be the Son of God he wasn't sure but after the the third Temptation Jesus saith unto him he discerned exactly who he was he says get the hand Satan for it is written verse 10 Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve the Bible says then the devil leaveth him Angels Came and ministered unto him there was going to be a change in his ministry you see he had been the son of a carpenter it was thought to be that Joseph was was his father he he was always an outstanding young man but now he was going to enter into a higher Ministry he was going to begin manifesting that he was the son of God and just and and and the manifestation of that was confirmed this ministerial change he says then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him because he was now going to start fulfilling Bible prophecies he was now entering into his ministry and right about that time after this Mount Temptation no sooner had he come down off this mount and Jesus heard that John was cast into prison then he knew it was his time the timing was perfect everything was falling exactly into place the Bible says and leaving Nazareth verse 13 he came and dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of Zebulon and neim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet now Bible prophecies are coming to pass one after another one on top of another malach 4 5 and 6 the first half had just finished coming to pass and as soon as it's fulfilled Jesus moves on the scene with his ministry because it was Bible it was a prophecy that had to come to pass even to the land that he went to zebon and Naim by the way of the sea Bible says Beyond Jordan it's at Galilee of the Gentiles these were two Gentile cities where he [Music] began he had begun as an evangelist he was going to do great Miracles and healings great healing campaigns and he began as an evangelist anyone could come anybody Jew Gentile sound of Mind demon possessed it didn't matter what church you belong to it didn't matter if you ever went to church or not this was the first poll of the of this evangelist Jesus of Nazareth and Jesus began to preach and to say exactly what John had been saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand more would be added there's a comma here repent we just have to repent Comm he's going to add more as the word unfolds more and the Bible says in verse 18 Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two Brethren Simon called Peter Andrew they were casting a net into the sea for obviously they were Fishers he saith unto them follow me and I'll make you Fishers of Men they didn't understand with that man but they followed him because they seen a powerful Ministry rising up and they straightway left their Nets and followed him and immediately he says he goes on a little further verse 21 and and and two other Brethren James the son of zebede and John his brother they were in a ship with their father they were mending their Nets and from there he called them they weren't in Bible School they they they they they weren't very good uh faithful Jewish boys because to be a fisherman in the days of Jesus was really considered a very low life he says and immediately says they left their ship and their father and followed him and then verse 23 says and Jesus went about all Gile Galilee teaching in their synagogues so as an evangelist who was who who was having who had a Healing Ministry all the churches wanted him the Baptist the Pentecostal the he could go amongst the Catholics in his early ministri in evangelist he was even welcome amongst the Jewish rabbis and he began preaching the gospel of the Kingdom the good news that Christ has come but he didn't identify himself as Christ yet and it says and and and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people verse 2 so this young evangelist his Healing Ministry caught the attention of the people he healed all manner of sickness and healing all manner of sickness verse 23 and healing sicknesses a cold uh your joints are hurting many sicknesses and and all manner of diseases diabetes cancer uh tumors leprosy well this caused his Fame to go throughout all Syria verse 24 and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with div diverse diseases so not only diseases but torments people tormented in their minds people tormented in their hearts people's emotional state in torment he he healed all of these troubles in the human race and those which were possessed with Devils the Bible says and those which were lunatic they'd get up one morning they'd shake your hand and say hello they'd smile then they go into the next room and they come back out the door they're not smiling no more now they're yelling at you now they're screaming at you now they're saying things that make no sense lunatic but he healed these types of people there was healing for them Bible says he healed them and there followed him great multitudes of people verse 25 there followed him great multitudes of people because because of the healing of diverse diseases because of the to healing of the torments of mind because they saw those that were possessed with Devils delivered and they saw those that were lunatic come back to their senses they saw thousands healed why the campaigns would be eight nine 10,000 people multitude stood before him oh the Evangelist Jesus of Nazareth the Evangelist the Evangelist Jesus of Nazareth because he was healing the the people and because anyone who wanted to come could come he would say doesn't matter what church you belong to he would even say you don't even need to belong to a church if you can have faith your faith will heal you that was Jesus's first poll that was the first phase of his ministry at the first coming of Christ would that be how he would display himself in the second coming because he's Hebrews 13 and8 the same yesterday today and forever in Matthew 5 Jesus Bible says and seeing the multitudes multitudes is thousands and thousands of people all waiting to be wanting to be prayed for also for healing for their physical bodies their ailment and the Bible says he went up into a mountain and he said and his disciples came unto him and this time he opened his mouth and taught them I don't bring you just healing for your body that was the first pull of the ministry but his ministry would have another another change in it his ministry would have a second phase so here Jesus went from just praying for the afflictions in the body so Jesus went to now praying for their for their afflictions of their mind Spirit teaching how to overcome their complexes of life passed on to them passed on to them by by their mothers by their mothers maybe their fathers maybe the lack of a mother maybe the lack of a father by their brothers by family members all these complexes of Life healing was going going to be not just for the physical body it was not just for the physical body it was going to be for the mind for the heart now he was speaking to them the ministry had now gone up a higher level but the people didn't understand it they wanted to see Miracles with their eyes they wanted to see Miracles that they could touch but Jesus wanted to take them higher increase their faith for more than just the healing of this body where are the thousands upon thousands where are the thousands and thousands that were healed in the ministry of William brandham not only William brandham Oral Roberts and many of the evangelists in that day they were healed of cancers they were healed of diabetes they were healed of the hundreds of disease that vexed the physical body were those that were that were brought back to life by the spoken word where are those I met a man his name was brother Edmund we Ed we an Englishman you you'll hear it on the tapes he was the brother that fell dead in the service in Jeffersonville Indiana his wife sister Ruth was a registered nurse he fell over she immediately went to check for his Vital Signs MH there was none his eyes had rolled black had rolled back there was no eye to look at it was all white and she said he's dead brother Bram says Be Still he says he says that if you do die there's no better place than in the church he said he was talking waiting to see how God would move him whether he would ask the deacons to pick the brother up or the Holy Spirit would tell him to go down there he got off the pulpit he walked down he went down where brother we was laying he says he realized he says now I've seen many people die and he says when your when your heart is shocked he says your the eyes will roll back just like brother WS were he realized he was dead and he prayed for him just then but he didn't pray a long long prayer he said brother way brother way and just a few seconds passed and the dead man said yes brother Bram the life had returned we met him back in the 70s uh he was very much alive he was given life again but he's in the grave today and so as his wife has passed on and all the thousands that were healed that God healed them they're all in the grave today but of all those that are in the grave the body how many allowed their faith to grow to be born again to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that when when the death finally takes his body we're not dead a Believer Never Dies by faith we just change dimensions in a moment we're in another world in a moment we're in a better place in a moment we're amongst friends like we've never been among friends so without faith to for the life to leave this body that's death indeed but to die in faith believing is not dying at [Music] all it's being absolutely changed for the last time it's to be in the presence of God forever more get to be the bride who was adorning herself and preparing her wedding gr gown and the bride while she's adorning herself and preparing her wedding ground she'll pass through troubles the bridal pass through sicknesses the bride will go through [Music] hardships the bride in this in this in this Earthly body will pass through great rejection all of those EXP experiences is her adorning and she's applying the word to the situations and overcoming these things verse five of Matthew it was God now praying for the afflictions in the minds of the people the affliction in their Spirits now teaching how to overcome complexes of Life how to overcome the feeling of rejection how to overcome sadness in your life how to overcome anger in your life how to learn how to hunger and thirst for righteousness instead of letting the the the the lustful hunger of a man and a woman take you instead of letting the lustful hunger take you away from his presence no now you're learning to to channel that hunger and and how to how to channel that thirsting for the things of God that'll give you a a a a victory a daily Victory how to overcome [Music] harshness harshness of hearts God began his ministry this first phase this first poll an evangelist praying for the sick in Matthew chapter 8 mat the mountain that that he went upon in Matthew 5 in chapter 5 the the mountain that he came that he went up on Matthew 5 he was now in Matthew 8 coming down that mountain and the great multitudes were still following this this this incredible evangelist people by the thousands were being healed daily and the Bible says when he came down off this mountain he had been what had he been preaching on he had gone from healing for the body now healing for the spirit now healing for the minds of the people and when he comes down from the mountain the Bible says that a leper came and worshiped him Matthew 82 and behold there came a leper and worshiped him saying Lord if thou can if thou will thou can make me clean Matthew 8 and verse 2 okay this this was not exactly a compliment for a for a Jewish rabbi this was not exactly a compliment for a minister in these in this in the days of Jesus that you could say you know who worships me the lepers worshiped me the lepers were despised of the world the leopards were shunned by all the people and now a leper comes to Jesus and he falls down and touches him he falls down and worships him but this leper was full of faith and belief his body was full of disease but his heart was full of Faith he may have been on his last weeks of life the flesh was already falling off of him he was in a horrible shape to look at him but he bowed down before the Lord Jesus and he said if thou will thou can make me clean and Jesus didn't say a word Jesus didn't pray a prayer Jesus simply laid his hand on the leper and touched him and saying I will be thou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed a reasonable man would have stood back from the leper and he says uh I'll pray for you you go ahead and go back to your leper colony and you can be sure that I'll be praying for you tonight that's okay that's fine but this was different this was a man who touched the Hem of the Garment of almighty God and Jesus said if you're willing to reach out if you're willing to reach out and and by faith and touch me I'm willing to touch you he said I will touch you as a matter of fact and when he put his hand on the leper the multitud went don't don't touch him it was too late he already had touched him and he said be thou clean and not a week later not 24 hours later the Bible says immediately his leprosy was cleansed he was entering into the second pole of his ministry this evangelist this Jesus of Nazareth this son of God in verse eight verse five Bible says and when Jesus had entered into capernium it was a lot like Los Angeles you know there came unto him a centurion a gentile a Roman a warrior a man with a lot of blood on his hands a man who even held the Jewish people captives and slaves the Bible says There came unto him a centurion beseeching him verse five and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the py grievously tormented Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said you won't have to come Lord for one thing you know what kind of man I am you can discern not only do you see my Roman my my my Roman dress as a centurion but you know my heart you you can discern it you know what kind of man I am and I'm not worthy that that you should come under my roof he said but speak the word only and my servant shall shall be healed he said you see I'm a man under Authority I am under what they call a Roman perfect I am under a a a a man that's called a Roman perfect that was that was a title of the next highest level of authority he said having sold I am Comm man under Authority but I have soldiers under me also and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it my word is law my word is such if they don't do it then they are put to death no one questions my authority when I tell them go they must go when I tell them come they must come and he says I perceive that you're that kind of man but in a supernatural realm I command men but I've seen you I've seen you command demons I seen you command demons I see you command sickness I've seen you command the Seas and the winds just speak the word this gentille said he wasn't a church [Music] goer it didn't belong to no certain [Music] denomination when Jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verely I say unto you I I Jesus have not found so great a Faith No not in Israel his first encounter as an evangelist he says this is the first time I see and have found so great a faith the healing campaigns and evangelists for the most part God was healing the people and they came to him the multitude they saw one healed they'd come to be healed by the thousands but it got to a place where the people couldn't receive their healing unless he discerned their heart unless he told them their name unless unless he unless he publicly told them where you live where your address is in the first po Ministry in the in the first po Ministry of Jesus into his second pool it was the same at his second com as it was at his first coming it got to a place where they couldn't just take it by faith they couldn't see the neighbor in the bench in front of them getting healed and believe that God was in the house and if he's being healed I too can receive my healing I too can receive my Deliverance I too can be changed because I seen him change another person and he's the same yesterday today and forever in verse 11 it says and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven one more time and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom he's talking about Jews now he's talking about the same Kingdom of Heaven in verse 11 and these are all Jews he says but the children of the Kingdom the Jewish people in in the first coming of Christ he said but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out in outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth he wasn't talking about hell here but this is the Jewish people and from the days of Jesus when they would reject when they would reject the open book and the the revelation of the Seven Seals they would be scattered for the next 2,000 years they would be scattered the world over into every nation Jerusalem and the promised land would be empty of all Jews until the 20th century this is that prophecy this is the this is the seven trumpets sounding of Revelations the this are the seven trumpets of the Book of Revelation sounding right here so not only did he prophesy and did he open the book and he and and and and brought us the revelation of Seven Seals but he brought into his preaching of the Gospel the seven trumpets how Israel would be scattered the world over but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth until Jesus comes again with another Elijah Ministry in the 20th century God rich and mercy seeing his ministry unfolding at the first coming if we can see it it will make more clear to us the ministry of Jesus at his second coming so we stand to our feet T Jesus evangelist prophet and mighty Angel he's the same yesterday today and forever he's unchanging in all his ways and may God Open the Eyes of our understanding to see him to recognize our day in its message to recognize that this gospel was not just for the healing of the body because as you know the thousands that were healed hundreds of thousands in the m in the ministry of the seventh angel they're all in the grave today but those who were baptized with the Holy Ghost those who were born again those they never died they changed Dimensions they changed bodies they're more alive tonight than they've ever been but not all who receive healing their body are that way only those whose Faith like the Centurion Jesus said your servant is sick I'll follow you to your house he said no no don't do that I'm not worthy for you to
