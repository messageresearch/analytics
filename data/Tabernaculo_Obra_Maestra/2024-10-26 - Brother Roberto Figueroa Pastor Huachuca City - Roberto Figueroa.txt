this evening we also have the privilege to have with us the brother Roberto figeroa a pastor there in a city in the city of wuka the Southeastern part of Tucson near s SI Vista we know him from many years ago my father introduced a message to the father of our brother Roberto in those years he was in the apostolic church we were Apostolic I know you forgive us for that right we're very thankful to have our brother here and we are certain that God will speak to us in this evening in Psalms 133 a song of David I have in Spanish behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head the Rand the that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments as a d of Herman and as the D that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life for every Morey in the Book of Revelations chapter 22 verse 16 John by a vision he says this speaking and repeating by inspiration the words of the Lord Jesus I Jesus have sent my angel to testify into the these things into the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life and with this we give up the place and I tell brother Roberto to come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well you know you're welcome when they say take your time I don't know what I can speak in okay I can speak in Spanish but my better language is English I don't speak as well as brother Daniel does I was thinking you may be seated for a few moments I've been battling this car for about four weeks now but I believe I got the victory right now am amen amen uh I was thinking about the similarities between myself and brother Daniel uh both of us came out of the apostolic church we grew up as young boys my parents and his parents were friends they knew each other before we were born I remember brother Angel and sister Francis they've already gone to be with the Lord as well as my own parents have gone to be with the Lord I remember Sister Francis being a real woman of faith brother Daniel couldn't had a better mother than sister Francis Francis and I remember how that U going back in time that coming out of the off church it was a brother Angel that came to my dad no brother Angel brother brother Daniel's father now our parents had been going and seeing the Evangelist during the 50s and and into the early 60s and and they had seen a lot of Miracles a Allen or Roberts Allan Roberts for the Jaggers and Jagger Tommy higs Tommy osbor Tommy brother Bram was always way above everyone else my parents had the uh had the opportunity of of being in the prayer line in in Phoenix Arizona in 1957 when brother Brandon preached the message what think he of Christ and and brother BR stood there and discerned their hearts and and this this put brother bradam way above all the rest he didn't pull for money he they would never ask for money and they knew there was something special about this man so my dad would leave the apostolic church and start following the evangelists and then time would pass he' get tired of that and he'd come back to the Apostolic Church after doing that several times he told my he told my mom let's go back to the apostolic church he says we're going to we're going to stay there till the Lord comes and my mother said I followed you I don't know how many times in and out you see they were thirsty they were looking for something and he said he said she said if you leave this time I'm not going to follow you well it wasn't very long one day outside the church there in Theos the First Apostolic Church in Tucson on 12th Avenue I know my dad and brother Angel brother his dad they they helped build that church and uh they they the ones that laid the brick and and built that church up and uh so brother Angels tells my dad hey have you heard brother brandham sermons on tape and my dad say he's got sermons on tape and he said yeah you want to come on the house come over to the house and you can I'll let you hear one that was it he went home he says brother Bram is is Malachi 45 he's a prophet of this age he got the Revelation like that and he was out of the Apostolic Church it took my mom a few months but she followed him too and so we have this uh similarities brother Daniel and I and we were both under brother Isaac Nora for for some years well until it was time to move on and then later on we find ourselves pastoring churches and another similarity one is it's a it's a hard one I know that sister Karen brother Daniel you lost lost a child there's no pain greater than that we lost our child to our our firstborn our our dear Ruth conine Ruth conad Ruth conad she died about three years ago during the covid so for some reason God has allowed this and here we are touching base again and I know this it's the Lord amen so I thank brother Dan having the confidence to invite me uh to to to preach in his church amen and I want brother Danny to know there's an open Pulpit there in wuka City whenever he wants and we'll keep in touch and I I want you coming back maybe sometime next year in January February whenever you can brother if you have your Bibles you'll stand with me tonight maybe tomorrow I'll take maybe a half an hour and give the testimony the figuroa testimony like call it six healings that took place in our family through brother Brandon's Ministry 1 Timothy V chapter 2 ver8 Paul writes here to a young man named Timothy he says I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting notice he says without wrath and doubting lifting up and praying everywhere lifting up our holy hands without any wrath in our hearts and without doubting father tonight we just want to give this this time to you Lord we we are inviting you as as a as a special guest tonight Lord Lord that maybe we could wash your feet tonight with our tears to serve you Lord there's no greater privilege there's no greater calling than to serve you and to be a servant of Christ and to be as far as Paul when he said I am a prisoner of Christ Lord here we are together to hear your word the word that you wrote and we ask that you will anoint everything we say tonight Lord that nothing will be said contrary to your word may you bless every heart tonight and anoint my lips to speak father and every heart to receive we be careful to give you the honor and the glory in Jesus name we pray and the C Church said God bless you may be seated this evening you want to hold this I'm GNA take off my coat you don't mind amen my message this this evening is a simple message I I I've titled it a call to prayer you know the the Muslims have what they call a call to prayer you probably hear them maybe in a video somewhere where they're wailing through some speakers throughout the whole city and the Muslims get on their knees and they face toward Mecca and they pray six times a day I wonder how many times we as Christians do we pray we don't have to be uh kneeling in in a secret place to pray although that has its place but Paul here said I would that men would pray everywhere I would that men would pray everywhere we can pray when we're driving you can pray when you're maybe a carpet or you're hammering away laying laying brick or driving down the road sisters can be praying while they're washing the dishes maybe they're vacuuming the floor I don't know but we can pray always there can be a prayer in our heart always and we are to pray and keep him in our mind and our heart throughout the day amen amen in Matthew chapter 6 verse 6 I'm going to have a few scriptures tonight so you might want to keep your Bible open blessed be the name of the Lord Matthew 66 Jesus says but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret go ahead and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly see there's a time of prayer that we as Christians need to be setting aside every day they asked brother bandam a question one time they said brother BR how can we become greater Christians how can we have a greater victory in our life surely they thought brother Brandon would have said or you got to fast 40 days you got to spend three days and shut up in the church Church no he said he said he said pray and read your Bible every day but for us it's too simple how can that give me that Victory try it and you'll see amen amen there's a time of prayer that we could lay aside when we close the door behind us by ourselves you know brother Brandon says when we pray at church many times or when we pray in public we our prayer is different but when we pray by ourselves and there's no one but God listening let me tell you your prayer becomes more personal because you're not saying that to bless somebody else but you're speaking from your heart and you're speaking to the heart of God there's something about the prayer the prayer of a saint In The Presence of Jehovah in the message faith that was once delivered to the Saints brother BR says he preaches in 55 he says don't you like to get alone with the Lord my my just be alone there's sometimes we used to sing a little song There's sometimes like I like to be all alone with Christ my Lord did you ever hear it I can tell him all my troubles all alone and that's the way he wants to get you Prophet God say that's what that's where God wants you he wants to get you all alone to himself your prayer is not so much as when you are or maybe coming you know for instance uh well out in the public where you're praying like in the church or around the altar you get alone you'll pray a different prayer when you're by yourself that you do when you're than when you do when you're in public sleep alone all of you go out and just have a real secret meeting place where you and the Lord meet several times a day and pray it's a little song that says if I can think of it in Spanish only with God amen forgive me for this thing it's the devil attacking me but we're going to keep on going forward in the message show was a father the prophet says notice any Divine promise of God is a seed and that's seed in the right ground now he said in the right ground he said well produce its kind corn will bring corn barley will bring barley wheat will bring wheat and any Divine promise of God will bring the results if it's placed in the ground and they watered with faith prayer and trust God shall bring it to pass I'm saying with experience I want you to notice he said in the right ground there's something in the ground is right here amen amen we we we been made from this Earth and this ground is was got to be prepared there's a way to come to God there's a way to approach the King of Kings when you come to church you don't come in chewing gum and just sit down and maybe never prayed all week didn't read your Bible all week and you sit down and you want God to do something in your life let me tell you there's a way to approach God even in the natural if you're going to approach the king of England they tell you how you got to dress you got to dress a certain way you got to walk through him a certain way when you leave him you got to leave him a certain way there's a protocol and and with God there is a way to approach it remember the prophet one time he was out there in the in the wilderness and he was seeking for for for the presence of the Lord and he sat on the log he began to pray took off his hat and nothing happened so then he he got off the log and he got on his knees lifted up his hands began to seek God nothing happened and then finally he lay himself prostrated on the ground and he spread out his arms and he began to call upon God and His presence came down God is looking for humility and this ground is got to be prepared it's got to we got to realize that what we are that we can't do anything without God that way God doesn't need anything that we've got he doesn't need our ability brother say he doesn't need our our our our knowledge or our ability he need he needs our availability he needs us to be there a present with for him giving over to him surrender to him amen amen there's nothing wrong with the seed that comes said that that seed in the right ground there's nothing wrong with the seed this seed is perfect amen this word of God is perfect if there's anything wrong it's in the ground if something's not if something's not connecting between the seed and the ground there something wrong with the ground we got to get this ground in the right place we got to prepare this ground the Bible says my word will not return but it shall accomplish that which I please and it will prosper to I sent it and that seed in the right ground I said that seed in the right ground listen in the right ground will produce its kind the problem is the soil it's the ground Hosea 10:12 it says soul to yourselves in righteousness give a brother a chance to find it here reap in Mercy break up your fellow ground for it is time to seek the Lord till he come and reing righteousness upon you soul to yourself in righteousness reap in Mercy he says break up your fellow ground what did the farmer do when he when he had the the mule pulling the plow what was the plow doing it was breaking up the ground because it was hardened sometimes our hearts get hardened and God can't penetrate that we got to prepare the heart and the ground is the heart of man that heart's got to be prepared it's got to lay before the sun yes amen it's got to it's got to be broken up many of us don't even know what it is to break up anymore we don't know what it is to a tear to come out of our eyes for our hearts say oh God I love you with all my heart for it to come out of your soul and the tears begin to flow why because sometimes our hearts get too hard the seed can't penetrate that if we want the blessings of God we want the promises of God to be fulfilled in our life we got work to do there's a sacrifice that's got to be paid brother green used to say this all the time he says salvation is free you can't buy it you can't pay for it you can't take all the gold in the world and buy salvation but let me tell you something it'll cost you everything I said it'll cost you everything it'll cost you your friends it'll cost you your popularity it will cost you your whole family sometimes it's going to hurt and there's sacrific involved when you break up the fellow ground it's not easy it might be hours on your knees they might be going to church service after service calling on the name of the Lord let me tell you you get that heart in the right place you break fellow ground that that heart becomes soft again that it can become begin to feel the presence of God again let me tell you the tears will begin to flow that's when that's when you know you've met with God that's when you know you've been in The Presence of Jehovah hallelujah hallelujah Isaiah 661 and 2 thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my rest we hear Jesus say come unto me all ye that are burdened and heavy laden and I will give you rest and we want that rest but here God turned it around he says where is a house where is a heart that you build unto me that I can come and live there I can abide hallelujah hallelujah where is the house we might say no verse two for all those things have my hand made everything that came out of this building came out of the earth God made it all these things have I made you know everything in here I made I made the medals the Sho Rock everything the the car everything amen amen and those things have been sayith the Lord here it is but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word that's a hard to surrendered friends that's a heart that's was true make my heart true Lord Jesus Hallelujah that you can come and abide in this heart glory to God first Peter 5: 4-7 and when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away now in First Corinthians hold your place there and turn toh 1 Corinthians 9:25 to 27 blessed be the name of the Lord hold your place in First Peter but turn to 1 Corinthians 9:25 and every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperate in all things what is tempered you know it comes is temperance to be able of temperance is a fruit of the Holy Spirit and with and with and Temperance where is where we control our passions we control our tempers we control this body the emotions we bring control over these things that's when you're you got Temperance the temperance of the Holy Spirit it says you're a man that's that's striving for a mastery like say uh uh the the can't think of it now the the world uh events that they run track and whatever and and they run for for for a crown and they're temperate if they're swimmers they swim every day of the year they do it every day day by day after day they breathe it they think it they live it they dream itall he says I therefore so run Paul said in verse 26 not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air this battle we're fighting we're not just beating the air we're not just playing a game this is life and death this is life and amen we come to fight a fight that will never end until we leave this earth but verse 27 says but I keep under my body what is he saying I keep this body under control I keep this mind under control hallelujah hallelujah and bring it into subjection lest by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away I take this body and I bring it in subjection to the word of God you've got to tell flesh flesh you're going to pray cuz let me tell you flesh don't want to pray flesh don't want to go to church brother Daniel Church doesn't want to study I mean excuse me the flesh can't doesn't want to study you got to say flesh you're going to church flesh I'm going to take time and read my Bible today cuz flesh don't want to do it you take flesh and you bring it into subjection by the Holy Spirit through the word of God Amen amen that's how we win the battles go back to First Peter verse 4-7 it says and when the chief Shepherd shall appear verse four you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto to the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another you know what that's talking about humility real humility when you don't think you're better than your brother or your sister even when you see them fail you know what a real true Christian says there go I but for the grace of God hallelujah hallelujah he says and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth Grace unto the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God and that he may exalt you in due time Cas in all your care upon him for he careth for you remember what he says here that he may exalt you in due time in the message thou knowest all things in 1952 brother Brandon says now see what prayer does prayer is not exactly bringing God down to man many times we say oh we were in service and God came down brother BR says it it doesn't bring God down here it's it says it's not exactly bringing God down to man he's talking about prayer is bringing man up to God see as you pray you lose sight of these Earthly things you sway out into somewhere else Way Beyond and on and on and on till you come into the presence hallelujah it's God bringing us up you want more scripture for that James 4:7 we we're speaking tonight about prayer and the importance of prayer tonight I hope when you leave you realize how important your prayer is to God submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw n to God number eight and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you Sinners purify your hearts what's that preparing the ground get away from sin get away from the thing if you're doing something you know is wrong get away from it amen amen purify your hearts your hands go cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts he says ye double-minded you know what a double-minded man is a double minded man is unstable in all his ways God we we as Christians we need to be disciplined in our life that's where the word disciple comes from discipline we discipline our lives pray before we start the day out put God first and when we lay our heads on the on the bed at night we come to God again and throughout the day there's got to be a discipline You' got to take the time to read your Bible you've got to take the time to pray if you leave it to whenever whenever whenever never happens a double minded man is unstable in all his ways he goes on he says in verse 9 be afflicted and mourn hallelujah hallelujah this is how we got to come to God saying Lord I'm sorry Lord oh God forgive me I'm So Unworthy Lord have mercy Lord on me and my family be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and what does he say he will lift you up in the pr of Je God Almighty that's the presence enter into that presence where everything blurs out all your problems begin blur all your heartaches begin to blur away you forget them as you enter as he lifts you up into the mighty Presence of Jehovah Ephesians 2:6 trying to show you where God brings us up into his presence Ephesians 2:6 and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places Hallelujah Hallelujah in Christ Jesus Hallelujah in In The

hallelujah hallelujah and don't ever Rise Above It hallelujah hallelujah for as soon as you rise above it you rise above God can you can you imagine what words brother Bram is saying here he says you got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to Damascus you've got to keep yourself off your high horses and that is for everyone for those that are here and everywhere these tapes go when you fall into the dust as Paul did and or sa and and and and and there he was in the dust thinking he was some great big somebody but God ducked him off his high horse and threw him into the dust and blinded him there and there he say Lord who are you who art thou Lord I am Jesus thou persecutest brother brand says we got to lay that that dust don't never rise from that dust the moment you rise from that dust risen above God look at the humility of our Lord and savior hallelujah hallelujah to stay in that presence to live in that presence daily that's where we need to be brother BR says in the message God keeps his word in 57 we should be unfolding God's spirit pouring out not just one gusher oh brother Robert had a gusher back in 1959 I felt the presence of God three years ago brother Brandon says not just one gusher not just one little baptism but baptism after baptism not a revelation the just should live by faith or sanctification or the gifts of the Spirit but revelation after Revelation power after power glory after Glory Hallelujah why we are to be lay up the road ready for translation and we're lingering back down in the old things saying well well keep going back let's go forward brother BR that's where we should be living we've left the presence of God we forgot we forgot what the presence of God is that first time you ever met him that experience that brought you in took all your sins off of you and washed you with the blood of the lamb and you entered into the presence of Mighty Jehovah where is his presence in your life today hallelujah hallelujah I read a book some time ago not a message book but it's a book written on a USA Street by Frank bartleman Frank I'm going to quote you a part of a few pages of that because we're talking about preparing the ground and before coming before the presence of the king he says he talking he's talking about that that building that they were in there in ausa Street the whole place was steeped in prayer God was in his holy Temple it was for man to keep silent the Shak Glory rested there in fact some claim to have seen the glory by night over the building a brother brother a brother that just passed on just a week ago brother Loreno anybody knew brother Loreno passed away he was my companion in in a lot of travels we made Venezuela in inene in Brazil and all through Mexico bra for many years and he he he told me once he was from cucamanga California back there in the 40s when he was a young man he said there was there was the that the presence from sua Street and the Revival was still going on and a few Believers had gotten together in a little church to pray and and began to pray in the power of God F that place and someone looked at the building and and they saw fire over the building and they called the fire department but that was a fire the fire department couldn't put out it was Pillar of Fire over that building and here he talks about that Pillar of Fire he says the Glory by night over the building I do not doubt it he says I have stopped more than once within two blocks of the place and prayed for strength before I dared go on what's the word dared to go on it's an important word because because this is how he was feeling and and he says he says the presence of the Lord was so real oh Hallelujah presumptuous men would sometimes come Among Us especially he says preachers it's going to come here especially preachers but their effort was shortlived the breath would be taken from them we're talking about The Presence of Jehovah their minds would wonder their brains would things would turn black Before Their Eyes they couldn't go on I never saw one get by with it in those days the the Holy Spirit did the rest we simply prayed no one cut them off uhuh did these preachers come in they thought they had something to tell the people and everybody's praying people the Holy Spirit people B being baptized in the Holy Ghost throughout the building he said we wanted the spirit to control and he wound them up and short order and they were carried out as dead they generally bit the dust in humility going through the process we had all all gone through in other words they died out came to see themselves in all their weakness then in childlike humility confession were taken up of God transformed through the mighty baptism in the spirit The Old Man Died with all pride arrogancy and good works these were not bad men these were men that had done things for God but when a man begins to do things for God he needs to remain humble well I preaching so so and I preach in this church all the hure was filled and I did this and I there were not bad Works friends but even our good works can hinder us you might think you did something for God and you don't realize it but that can hinder your your very walk with God what's hinder amen so it was not bad works that they were doing it was good works but even our good works when the Bible says our most righteous Deeds are as filthy rags in the sight of God we got to remain humble no matter what we've done I remember the prophet when he went beyond the curtain of time he said he was laying on his bed had his hands behind his head like this and he said to himself Billy you better get busy if you're going to do anything for the Lord that's the spirit that's the spirit of humility if we're going to do anything for the Lord Brother Daniel anything at all brother Let's Get Busy hallelujah hallelujah glory to God John 12:2 24-2 John 12 24 and 25 how many say glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise be His holy name amen John 12:24 verily verily as say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit Hallelujah he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life Heen in this world shall keep it until eternal life this man far Frank bartleman frankman he said in my own case I came to uphor myself I came to abhor when I would read with Jesus where he said this if you don't hate hate your life I how can we hate our life when God gave us I didn't understand that but when I read this he said I be I came to abhor myself I Begg the Lord to drop a curtain so close behind me and my past that it would hit my heels one days I was praying and I was entering into a prayer life and having a good time in the Lord fighting battles but I was I was trying to do the best I could to pray and I and I went through the day and I thought I I did pretty good I I think I I I kept my my temper I didn't lose it I didn't do any of this when I heard this other I didn't react wrong and you know you get to thinking like that and then I got down to praying and as I prayed the Lord brought to my memory this thought and what and what my motive was here he began to show me that my walk wasn't what I thought it was and I remember getting beside myself I I said Lord how can you even stand me how can you stand me Lord how can you stand this world how can you stand me I don't understand I don't deserve your mercy I'm a sinner Lord and I need you I to realize I had nothing good to bring him until you realize you got nothing good to bring him would you come to ask him Lord would you give me something Lord give something to me Lord my hands Lord are empty fill them Lord with your blessings hallelujah hallelujah I was praying there I was work I worked for 10 years as a bus driver driving a school bus if I ever thought I was getting hotti I to remember I'm a school bus driver and it was early in the morning one morning and and I and I was just meditating reading the Bible about 3:30 in the morning and and I was reading there in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 vers 3 to 5 it's a scripture that I memorize I know it in English and it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imag ations and everything that exalted itself against the knowledge of God which is what the word of God which is the word of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ now I've got this scripture memorized I know this scripture when I read it that morning I read it different for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh it says for the weapons weapons plural not just one weapon if you ever read heard the tape greatest battle ever fought you know this is a weapon brother BR said you take this weapon it's liken into a sword you cut that devil to Pieces by his stripes I am healed you're using a sword in the spirit realm and you cut that devil to pieces and he said you step forward and you say now where's the next one that's what he said about that and I knew this word was a weapon but I said what other weapons do we have and I began to think and as I thought that very moment the this thought came to my mind when the weakest Saint goes to his knees before God Satan trembles and I stood up said praise the Lord I got excited brother Daniel I got a revelation that morning my prayer is a weapon I've been struggling in my prayer and I began to remember what brother BR said about it we're going to quote him in a minute but I want you to know this this evening that the weapons of our Warfare are not caral it's not a it's not a M16 it's it's not a it's not a a k47 but it it is a it is a spiritual weapon and it's not carnal but it is mighty I said it is mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds hallelujah hallelujah glory to God around that time I saw I I do use Facebook but I had done but Christians Karen you're one of my friends and because I look at what what they're about before I even add them in and and so I was looking at that and the picture came up of a of a black sister and she was she was UPC or message I don't know she got long hair long dress she was kneeling her hands were lifted up and you could tell she was she was in she was in in another place she was in The Presence of Jehovah and that really impacted me but what really impacted me what it says beneath that picture he said this is how I fight my battles this is how I fight my battles where do you fight your battle up the street your battle is fought on your knees amen that's where you fight your battle that's where you're strengthened by by Jehovah God when you you get up full of the Holy Spirit and you walk out that door to start your day walking in the spirit of God anointing flowing all over you Hallelujah the Holy Spirit In Your Heart the holy spirit is on your mind the word of God is in your heart the word of God is in your mind hallelujah hallelujah this is how I fight my battles it may look like I'm surrounded but I am surrounded by God hallelujah in the message surrounded by God in the message greatest battle ever fought he says see his attack watch listen close his attack is what disbelieve God's word that's his attack there can you see the greatest battle was ever fought there's only two forces Satan and God what is Satan's weapon against you listen to what I'm going to say this this this is the Crux of the message right here what is Satan's weapon against you is to try you to get to disbelieve your weapon to get you to not believe that your weapon is good enough now brother bam is talking about the word here but I'm talking about another weapon tonight and your weapon is prayer and Satan has attacked you to make you believe that your prayer doesn't work if he gets you to believe that you've laid down your weapon brother BR say he disarms you listen real quiet now listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has has disarmed you amen what has he done with our prayer why don't we pray like we should because we don't think our prayer is going to be is going to be anything how many times are we KN and we're praying and the thought comes it's not going past the evening doesn't even go past the SE what's a what's the purpose of me praying if he gets you to disbelieve your weapon he says Oh Brother Neville I hope we never leave that look he's disarmed you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done hold that weapon hallelujah hallelujah my time is running out how much what time I'm going to give you some quotes of brother brandom because after I after I had got that Revelation that morning about prayer I began to teach it to my church and I only had the one quote that God gave me in my mind but sometime later I found in my shelf where all my books were at it was a little pamphlet and I pulled it out and it was called a call to prayer and if you read brother Daniel you know what brother Brown says there I didn't I didn't know about and I began to read all the things brother B said about prayer brother BR says blind blind B [Music] he says you know there's something about getting alone to yourself many people never pray till they come to church many people think that's the only place to pray is the church my but the Bible said that man to pray everywhere lifting up holy hands and then when we get by ourself we usually pray different amen we would if we prayed in church it's the secret prayer that Jesus spoke of saying enter into the secret closet and close the door and when you have did so pray to your father who sees in secret he that seeth in secret should reward thee openly and when we're praying like that there seems to be something to the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy when you're by yourself and you're pouring out your heart to God there's no hypocrisy it seems like we got we get a a better connection with God get alone he talks about how many many times you would go I'm not going to read it but he get in the car and just drive and go out and just drive and and just meditate on on God and the Holy Spirit would come and he'd find himself parked somewhere and didn't know how he got there it's those Precious Moments by myself there were times I was going to to work in the morning after having a time with God in the morning before leaving the house I I I know how I got from here to there I don't remember driving that brother Daniel I was under the spirit the Holy Spirit had a hold of me and I was praising God with everything I had how God kept me safe something about those moments alone with God secret he is listen the devil will try to limit your prayer because you're praying limits him the Muslims pray five times a day as a lifestyle you know the Jews they they pray three times a day as a lifestyle you pray when you feel like it or not you pray whether you're blessed or not whether you're happy or not pray our prayer must be consistently so you pray when you feel good you pray when you feel bad when you feel like praying or you don't feel like pray it's time to pray I'm going to go pray you pray when you're broke and you pray when you're blessed you pray when you're down and you pray when you're up because your prayer is for survival and for maintaining your daily Victory with God and I'm going to say something here this evening as I close this morning we cannot navigate through these end time storms these end time storms if we don't go back to a place of prayer we got to get back into that presence and begin to know him again in the power of his resurrection shed in with God in a SE R Place there in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power to run in the race how I love to be shut in with [Music] God in sec Bram he said brother Bram says if you don't get in the presence every day seek that presence your Christian experience with God will dry up and die sorry will dry up that experience we have to maintain that connection with Jehovah Our Savior glory to his I hope that something was said in this evening to bless you all may God bless everyone of you tonight the importance of prayer though we walk in the flesh our our Warfare is not it's not in flesh it's powerful It's mighty amen for the weapons because the weapons of of our militia Hallelujah they are powerful Almy God may you stand on in this evening in the beginning I pray that tonight tonight when you go home before you go to bed you'll kneel down say Lord I'm sorry I didn't realize how important it is for me to talk to you to have a conversation with him to feel his Spirit many times as we pray God will bring things to our memory maybe with some problem with so and so that he's doing that for a purpose because he wants us to go make it right that nothing will hinder our walk with God Amen Hallelujah [Music] [Music] Hallelujah for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hall hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah can [Music] for Hallelujah glor glor s Hallelujah [Music] there's someone entering in that presence in the from in the Lord Jesus Christ knowing that you have lifted up from there everything is well Hallelujah Hallelujah he's got my back he's got my back God is with me I know that's when you begin to know and realize every day you're walking in The Presence of Jehovah you know song In The Presence of Jehovah in [Music] the see if I can sing it in Spanish in [Music] [Music] I don't know I think you did with the [Music] music in the presence in the Pres of Je God Almighty Prince of Peace troubles vanish problem amen troubles vanish hearts are mened in the presence of the king father tonight as we as I leave this pit Lord I ask that you'll take these words put them in every heart Lord give us an understanding Lord tonight how important is that relationship with you how are things between me and God how are things between me and my savior thank you Lord for this place brother Daniel this little church here Lord these Believers may they may they receive a double portion of your Holy Spirit I pray tonight with you Lord God and know you and come closer to walk with you my prayer in Jesus name brother Hallelujah amen amen did you enjoy that tonight a call to prayer I feel the message was so timely tonight I feel the inspiration was just right I feel the passion that the brother delivered the message with was the Holy Spirit and I believe God spoke to every heart here tonight a call to prayer don't ever believe your prayer isn't Mighty to bring down strongholds or heal the sick or save the lost or repair a marriage no prayer can do all of these things prayer is a weapon prayer is your strength prayer is a channel to the father you ask him he answers he always answers God is so good the brother read a scripture in the Book of Matthew he said but when but thou when thou prayest Matthew 66 but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly you know the ministry of Jesus Christ he began as an evangelist there in Matthew 4 praying for the sick he move he moved into a second pole of his ministry he was still praying for the sick but now the prayer brought forth a gift of discernment but the second PLL of his ministry it was a prayer meeting also third pole of the ministry of Jesus Christ it was also about prayer and the last thing he did on the cross of Calvary he prayed because prayer was powerful and on the cross of Calvary his prayer was this I not just for Israel as he hung there and the blood dripped on the ground and the crown was on his head and the nails were through his hands in his feet he prayed he said father forgive them they don't know what they've done oh but I'm going to make a way for them way will be the way of this Blood issue that I'm giving oh prayer brought salvation PR brought healing prayer repairs our marriages prayer restores our families prayer still saves the lost from 1946 to 1949 the first poor Ministry at the second coming of Christ through a prophetic Ministry lasted about three years it was a prayer meeting his second poll to the ministry with the second coming of Christ from 1949 to 1963 came came to came to a transition about July 28th it was also a prayer meeting and in the third pole Ministry from 1963 to 1965 the public prayer meetings the the public prayer meetings the public prayer meetings went into the prayer closet it says it won't be for the public sorry it won't be a public show anymore but it'll be the greatest prayer meetings that have ever been on the face of the Earth it will be you and I in sincerity honest in our hearts looking for this revealed word to do what it's promised to do to change us to Quicken us to translate Us by the power of the Holy Ghost in the message what is a vision brother brandom said this he said notice close he says there's a difference between the angel of the Lord and that light he says I heard something moving and as it does when it comes here on the platform kind of like a woo woo like a fire whipping around licking blazes he says and it left me and it went right down over the top of that audience it was the tent vision and then went and stood over the top of that little building and went and stood over the top of that little building it's not the big buildings no more not the big tents anymore no it's you with a restored friendship with the Adam had an Eden before he fell but God's word won't return void you'll have a friend and that friend is you tonight want he says and it went over down over the top of that audience went went and stood over the top of that little building then settled down on top of it and when it did this one that was standing behind me the same voice the Angel's voice he said I'll meet you in there and this is the third pole but nobody will know nothing about it what was that third pole that little building not the great tents anymore that little building it was a symbol it was symbolic God speaking again in a parable and and brother bman says and I said well I don't understand why in there he said it will not be a public show this time and everyone's still trying to drum up some great public show and I said I don't understand going into that closet like that twice he's telling the angel I don't understand I don't get it I'm not seeing it then he the angel said he took him back where to the word is it not written by our Lord when thou prayest be not like the Hypocrites who like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to your father who seeth in secret and he who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly and brother brandom says it's perfectly to the scripture every time Matthew 66 a scripture laying in the word a parable that Jesus had spoke a parable is a mystery a parable is a prophecy and it's been read by millions but this day this scripture is fulfilled before your eyes and it's the place where God wants to take you tonight it's the place he wants to take you every day the place that he's called us to a call to pray pray that's this that's this third pole that's been so confusing to the people and yet tonight he's touched your heart with a call to prayer the third pool is preparing our hearts because he's coming back for the honest in heart brother Bram said the right seed in the wrong womb the right seed in the wrong room wom brought forth a wild man it was an it was Esau he lived by his bow and arrow a man of violence but he said it was the right seed but in the wrong womb he said the right seed in the right seed in in the right womb Sarah brought forth a gentleman but the spoken word seed in a predestinated womb for a perfect man Jesus Christ Christ in is the hope of glory oh God has been so good
