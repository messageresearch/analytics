[42:57] it's good to be here once
[43:01] again just to give him
[43:05] thanks for all he's done for
[43:07] us even just throughout this
[43:11] day just to know that the things we've
[43:14] asked
[43:16] him he's heard our
[43:20] prayer even
[43:22] today we don't have to look back too far
[43:26] to see he
[43:29] answers things that we've asked
[43:31] him you woke up this
[43:34] morning we ask God to be with
[43:39] us we asked Him to guide us and lead
[43:44] us we ask them to take care of each and
[43:46] every one of
[43:49] you and he did just
[43:52] that we appreciate that song brother
[43:55] Kenny
[43:57] and there is power in
[44:00] prayer when When sin when we do it
[44:05] sincerely and when we make our house a
[44:08] House of
[44:10] Prayer then God is a God who answers
[44:14] prayer he's always
[44:16] listening he he he's he's always
[44:22] attentive he is he is one of he is he is
[44:25] the best
[44:28] listener above
[44:31] everyone some folks might be able to
[44:33] boast they say you know I'm a pretty
[44:34] good
[44:37] listener and and that might be
[44:40] so but there is no one who is a better
[44:45] listener than our lord Jesus the holy
[44:49] spirit so we appreciate that
[44:52] song Matthew 24:35 says
[44:56] Heaven and Earth shall pass
[44:59] away but my words shall never pass
[45:03] away Jesus said in Luke
[45:08] 1946 he said my house is a House of
[45:13] Prayer that's how you
[45:15] know about about a house about a
[45:20] home and that is if it's a House of
[45:23] Prayer then that's a house that God
[45:26] dwells
[45:27] in and and we are God's house
[45:31] individuals and the homes that we live
[45:35] in made made of made of wood and and
[45:38] stone
[45:42] and we can make those
[45:45] houses a House of
[45:48] Prayer we never want to do what Israel
[45:51] did to
[45:53] God's Jesus said you have made it a den
[45:58] of
[45:59] Thieves he says but my house shall be a
[46:03] House of
[46:04] Prayer but he and he's always
[46:07] listening I remember testimony my dad
[46:11] told
[46:13] me when he when he had taken my uncle to
[46:17] to to um have a have an appointment with
[46:21] brother
[46:24] brandham personal
[46:27] interview and since it was not his since
[46:30] it was not his
[46:33] interview he he he he didn't feel to
[46:36] speak or ask anything or say
[46:40] anything but while brother brandham was
[46:42] speaking to my
[46:44] uncle in his heart he said I'd sure like
[46:48] to ask brother
[46:51] brandham how that gift in his hand
[46:54] works because they'd been in the
[46:57] meetings but they'd seen it from a
[46:59] distance sitting in the audience and now
[47:02] the man was this close to
[47:05] him and in his heart he's saying Lord
[47:10] I'd sure like to ask him how that gift
[47:11] in his hand
[47:13] works but he said I didn't dare do
[47:16] it because it wasn't my
[47:18] interview it was my uncles and he says
[47:22] as brother brandom and his uncle are
[47:24] speaking
[47:27] just
[47:29] fellowshipping because that was what my
[47:30] uncle had asked
[47:32] for he just wanted a few minutes of
[47:36] fellowship with brother brandom because
[47:39] he'd been in the meetings
[47:41] too and his prayer was
[47:44] answered now they're there at at the
[47:47] Ramada
[47:48] in they in Tucson Arizona and my
[47:52] father's just sitting
[47:54] quiet and and brother brandham and and
[47:57] and my uncle are
[48:00] speaking and brother brandham turns to
[48:03] my
[48:05] dad he doesn't know he's never met my
[48:07] dad
[48:09] before and he just said he told me
[48:13] brother would you like to
[48:15] see how that gift in my hand
[48:18] works but the M says
[48:22] yes you wouldn't believe it but I was
[48:24] just thinking that right now before the
[48:26] Lord you
[48:29] know he just thought it God heard it he
[48:34] says that's easy I'll just tell the
[48:37] prophet to show you how the gift
[48:40] works and he did
[48:43] prayer he's always
[48:45] listening he he'll always
[48:49] answer sometimes it's yes sometimes it's
[48:53] no but he's the best listener
[48:56] that's ever
[49:03] been turn with me to
[49:06] Matthew verse
[49:09] one and chapter
[49:17] one Matthew 1 and
[49:22] one the book of The Generation
[49:26] of Jesus
[49:29] Christ the son of
[49:31] David the son of
[49:34] Abraham let's pray Heavenly Father we
[49:38] thank you and we certainly
[49:41] believe what your disciple and Apostle
[49:46] wrote that this is the
[49:48] book of the
[49:50] generation of Jesus
[49:53] Christ his generation is his
[49:56] children his generation is his little
[50:00] bride his generation is both Jews and
[50:05] Gentiles and every one of them has their
[50:08] name
[50:09] written in this book the Lamb's Book of
[50:13] Life we thank you now in Jesus name amen
[50:18] you may be
[50:21] seated part
[50:23] nine of Jesus
[50:27] evangelist teacher Prophet Lamb of God
[50:32] the New
[50:33] Testament is the Lamb's Book of
[50:37] Life for many for many for a long time I
[50:41] wondered because I'd read the scriptures
[50:44] there in Revelations
[50:47] 138 Revelations
[50:51] 2127
[50:53] 2127 where it speaks of this l Book of
[50:57] Life and and the prophet would speak of
[51:01] it and sometimes it would sound like
[51:03] something
[51:05] abstract something that that that that I
[51:09] believed but something that maybe we
[51:11] couldn't touch we couldn't
[51:14] handle until I come to find
[51:17] out that I've been carrying the Lamb's
[51:20] Book of
[51:21] Life ever since I've carried a Bible in
[51:24] my arms
[51:26] this is the Lamb's Book of
[51:28] Life and the lamb was slain before the
[51:31] foundation of the
[51:33] [Music]
[51:36] world that's the book that Adam
[51:39] lost and it wasn't so much a written
[51:42] book we do have a written book
[51:46] today but then the book was a was the
[51:48] spoken
[51:50] word Adam's life was
[51:54] unfolding unto eternal life by the
[51:58] spoken word because he was in a personal
[52:01] relationship with the
[52:04] father he didn't need the written
[52:08] book he had he had god with him the
[52:11] living
[52:13] book the author walking him through the
[52:17] book chapter by
[52:20] chapter taking them unto
[52:23] Perfection and had they not Fallen
[52:26] they would have broken into eternal
[52:28] life because that's what Perfection
[52:32] is Bible
[52:35] Perfection human
[52:38] Perfection is is is is you doing
[52:41] something a
[52:43] carpenter and he finishes a a
[52:46] woodworking
[52:50] project and he says wow that's perfect
[52:53] wow and then and his family looks at it
[52:56] and
[52:57] friends they say that's
[53:00] perfect and then he gets a visitor
[53:02] that's another
[53:05] Carpenter maybe better than
[53:08] him and he goes That's
[53:10] nice but I'll tell you what that ain't
[53:14] perfect and there goes the
[53:16] Perfection that's human
[53:20] Perfection human
[53:22] Perfection is I just cooked
[53:26] the best
[53:27] pizza it's perfect Joseph's going to
[53:30] love this
[53:32] one and then Joseph eats it he says well
[53:35] it was good but it wasn't perfect you
[53:39] see so our Perfection has
[53:43] critics God's
[53:45] Perfection it's not natural It's
[53:49] Supernatural it's eternal life to be
[53:53] perfect as the father is perfect
[53:56] is to enter into eternal life with the
[53:59] father but the father had a
[54:02] plan of

[55:07] the book of the generation of Jesus
[55:12] Christ that means this is the this is
[55:14] the Lamb's Book of
[55:17] Life for if Jesus Christ had a
[55:21] generation that means he had children
[55:24] that means he has
[55:25] family that means he gave forth his life
[55:28] and he brought forth
[55:30] life oh this is the Lamb's Book of
[55:34] Life New Testament we have our hands on
[55:38] it and he's and he's opening the eyes of
[55:41] our
[55:42] understanding to see what his plan is
[55:46] and how to restore us how we can take
[55:49] little
[55:51] steps that will take us to to to the
[55:53] very Throne of God
[55:56] the Father which is in heaven is
[55:58] perfect it's not
[56:00] impossible but it is
[56:03] supernal nothing natural about it and
[56:07] yes we must yield to the
[56:10] moving of the Holy Spirit to enter into
[56:14] this Supernatural
[56:16] life that's how every biography
[56:20] began with the birth who were the
[56:23] parents who are his children what that
[56:27] person did with their
[56:29] life is that not what the what the
[56:31] writers of the gospels
[56:35] wrote because they were
[56:38] anointed to write this
[56:43] biography of the Lamb Jesus Christ this
[56:47] is his book and your name is in it and
[56:51] your life is in it because his life is
[56:55] your
[56:57] life we are his
[57:01] children in Revelations 13 and
[57:13] 8 it reads like
[57:16] this and all that dwell upon the Earth
[57:20] shall worship
[57:23] him but it wasn't was n talking about
[57:27] Christ it wasn't talking about the
[57:30] lamb no it was talking about the
[57:33] dragon it was talking about the
[57:36] Beast it was talking about that Harlot
[57:40] Church the Roman Catholic
[57:43] Church it was talking about her
[57:46] daughters the
[57:48] denominations in verse four it said or
[57:51] verse
[57:53] three and I saw one of his heads as it
[57:56] were wounded to
[57:58] death and his deadly wound was
[58:01] healed and all the world wondered after
[58:04] the
[58:07] Beast and they worshiped the dragon
[58:10] which gave power unto the
[58:13] Beast and they worshiped the Beast
[58:16] saying who is like unto the
[58:19] Beast and who is able to make war with
[58:22] him because he is now become the global
[58:27] leader of the whole
[58:29] world and everyone is and all the
[58:32] nations are pushing for
[58:34] this they don't know that they're being
[58:38] anointed and their names are in the book
[58:41] too but there are names that on the
[58:44] white Throne
[58:46] judgment they will be
[58:48] judged and be cast into a lake of
[58:51] fire but in verse 13 and 8
[58:55] it said and all that dwell upon the
[58:57] Earth shall worship
[59:00] Him worship who the dragon worship who
[59:06] the Beast whose
[59:09] names all were worship him except those
[59:13] whose names are written in the Book of
[59:15] Life of the
[59:19] Lamb the lamb that was slain on Calvary
[59:25] the lamb that was slain from the
[59:27] foundation of the
[59:29] world in other words God has a plan he's
[59:33] always been in control he's always known
[59:36] what's
[59:39] happening he W he didn't lose control in
[59:42] the Garden of
[59:43] Eden no Adam and Eve lost
[59:47] control God didn't lose
[59:49] control he knew when he gave them free
[59:51] moral
[59:53] agency
[59:55] they'd make the wrong choice and before
[59:58] they made the wrong
[1:00:00] choice the lamb had already been
[1:00:03] slain his sons for his daughters Lucifer
[1:00:09] was given free moral
[1:00:11] ageny the angels that fell with
[1:00:15] them because they had a
[1:00:19] soul a soul is a
[1:00:21] seed but not every soul is the seed of
[1:00:26] God some souls are the seed of the
[1:00:30] serpent we are not all
[1:00:33] one there are those there are the seed
[1:00:36] of The
[1:00:37] Serpent and there are those that are the
[1:00:40] seed of God
[1:00:42] predestinated unto eternal
[1:00:45] life all you've got to do is
[1:00:49] believe when you
[1:00:51] pray and God will give you
[1:00:55] and bring you to the
[1:00:58] stature of a perfect man that's spoken
[1:01:01] of in the Lamb's Book of
[1:01:04] Life this is what the gospels of
[1:01:08] Matthew Mark Luke and John were all
[1:01:12] about it was the beginning of the Lamb's
[1:01:15] Book of
[1:01:18] Life but the New Testament has 27
[1:01:22] books and each one
[1:01:25] gave more and more
[1:01:27] detail of this lamb of his life and how
[1:01:31] you and I can be blessed with this
[1:01:35] life you and I can return back into
[1:01:38] fellowship with this
[1:01:40] life the life of the
[1:01:43] father it's a plan it's it's it's it's
[1:01:46] little baby
[1:01:48] steps and how to get back into his pray
[1:01:51] into his
[1:01:52] presence and how to be a House of
[1:01:57] Prayer in Genesis
[1:02:00] 3:15 there was a
[1:02:03] prophecy and that
[1:02:05] prophecy was
[1:02:07] concerning this
[1:02:10] lamb it was concerning the the
[1:02:12] generation of this
[1:02:15] lamb Genesis
[1:02:18] 3:15 it reads like this and I the the
[1:02:23] the man and the woman had
[1:02:26] fallen this was a this was the first
[1:02:29] White Throne judgment that was taking
[1:02:33] place there'll be another one
[1:02:36] coming but this was the
[1:02:38] first God was judging everyone on the
[1:02:43] Earth all had
[1:02:45] fallen his sons his daughters the animal
[1:02:51] kingdom had fallen of course
[1:02:55] when I say all on Earth had
[1:02:58] fallen there was only his son and his
[1:03:01] daughter and the
[1:03:03] serpent the most subtle beast of the
[1:03:07] field and this was the Judgment going
[1:03:10] forth but in in verse
[1:03:14] 15 he had the the Lord was speaking to
[1:03:18] the
[1:03:20] serpent he had already cursed this
[1:03:22] serpent in verse 14
[1:03:27] because the serpent was a
[1:03:30] beast a single
[1:03:32] Beast that had been created for a single
[1:03:39] purpose I don't believe there was a a
[1:03:41] Mrs serpent a
[1:03:45] female Prophet said he he stood on his
[1:03:48] the Bible says he stood on his
[1:03:51] feet like a
[1:03:53] man Prophet said he looked like a
[1:03:56] man but he was all
[1:03:59] Beast someone would say well the Bible
[1:04:02] says that there was two of each kind
[1:04:05] that were
[1:04:09] made so how could you say that all of a
[1:04:12] sudden God breaks that
[1:04:16] pattern unless there's a pattern in the
[1:04:18] Bible to show us where he's did it
[1:04:20] before or repeated
[1:04:23] it
[1:04:27] brother
[1:04:27] brandham tells us of a time he had gone
[1:04:31] to a
[1:04:32] fair of some
[1:04:35] kind and or a museum
[1:04:38] maybe don't recall
[1:04:41] exactly but he said they were going on a
[1:04:43] tour with a
[1:04:48] guide and he showed them a great
[1:04:52] skeleton of it was supposed to be be one
[1:04:54] of the largest whales in the
[1:04:58] world and the entire skeleton is on this
[1:05:01] giant
[1:05:04] trailer and the man begins to tell him
[1:05:07] about the
[1:05:09] whale large it is how long they
[1:05:13] live then he says you've and you've
[1:05:16] probably and you've probably heard uh
[1:05:19] the the the old
[1:05:22] story that's written in the
[1:05:25] about how a whale swallowed
[1:05:28] Jonah he said I want you to notice that
[1:05:31] this whale that you're seen
[1:05:33] here is one of the largest whales in the
[1:05:37] world and if you look at its
[1:05:40] throat how small it is it would probably
[1:05:44] have trouble swallowing a
[1:05:49] grapefruit so we know that that was just
[1:05:51] a legend it's not true
[1:05:55] and brother bram's listening he said
[1:05:57] about that time I had heard all I could
[1:06:00] stand I said wa excuse me sir I don't
[1:06:03] needan to interrupt
[1:06:06] you I'm afraid you you've got that
[1:06:10] wrong because the Bible said that God
[1:06:13] created a
[1:06:15] fish to swallow
[1:06:18] Jonah if if God had wanted
[1:06:21] to he could have made a fish
[1:06:25] they could swallow this whole skeleton
[1:06:26] in the trailer
[1:06:29] too but this was a special
[1:06:32] fish that God had made just for this
[1:06:36] purpose just for this day just for This
[1:06:40] Man Called
[1:06:42] Jonah One of a Kind
[1:06:45] Beast that God made he didn't make two a
[1:06:50] male and
[1:06:51] female he made one that was it so now we
[1:06:56] go back to Genesis to the serpent he
[1:07:00] only made one and there was a purpose
[1:07:04] and there was a reason and we've spoken
[1:07:06] on it so we won't we won't go on that or
[1:07:09] I'll get off my subject all
[1:07:12] together even even though every subject
[1:07:15] of the Bible does this and it comes
[1:07:19] together and and in verse 15 it said I
[1:07:23] will put am between thee and the
[1:07:27] woman so so he said I will put enity
[1:07:31] between thee The Serpent and the
[1:07:35] [Music]
[1:07:37] woman and between thy seed who was he
[1:07:40] speaking to the
[1:07:43] serpent so the term being used here is
[1:07:46] what in the Book of
[1:07:49] Genesis the seed of the serpent because
[1:07:52] they ask us where do you get get that
[1:07:55] from serpent
[1:07:57] seed he says well it starts in Genesis
[1:08:01] and it goes all through the
[1:08:02] Bible and I will put enity between thee
[1:08:05] and the woman and between thy seed the
[1:08:08] serpent
[1:08:12] seed and her
[1:08:15] seed but he wasn't referring so much to
[1:08:20] Eve I will put City between thy seed and
[1:08:24] her
[1:08:26] seed and it shall bruise thy
[1:08:30] head and thou shal bruise his
[1:08:35] heel this
[1:08:39] seed was not the woman's
[1:08:42] seed and yet it says it
[1:08:47] was because that was the
[1:08:49] prophecy her seed but this woman was not
[1:08:52] Eve that the Bible was speaking
[1:08:55] of this was a
[1:08:58] prophecy this was a
[1:09:00] parable this was a metaphor this was the
[1:09:03] prophetic
[1:09:04] word this woman was not was not
[1:09:08] Eve and this woman was not
[1:09:11] Mary this woman was the mystical body of
[1:09:15] Jesus
[1:09:17] Christ and her seed is Christ
[1:09:21] himself Christ in you in me the hope of
[1:09:25] glory you say didn't didn't include Eve
[1:09:28] and Mary at
[1:09:31] all did they're included in this woman
[1:09:35] but the woman that the prophecy is
[1:09:37] speaking
[1:09:38] of the many membered body of Jesus
[1:09:41] Christ that's his wife they're included
[1:09:45] in the
[1:09:46] whole the prophecy wasn't about one
[1:09:49] specific Natural
[1:09:52] Woman prophecy was about the Bride of
[1:09:55] Jesus Christ about the Lamb's
[1:09:59] wife that's the woman the mystical body
[1:10:03] of Jesus
[1:10:05] Christ The Gospel of
[1:10:09] Matthew it showed us the everchanging
[1:10:13] ministry of
[1:10:16] Jesus king of the
[1:10:18] Jews the Bible tells us he was born the
[1:10:21] king of the
[1:10:22] Jews Magi came that was their
[1:10:26] question once they got this close
[1:10:29] they'll say surely everyone in Jerusalem
[1:10:31] knows about
[1:10:33] this they said where is he that's born
[1:10:36] King of the
[1:10:38] Jews they said
[1:10:41] what we ain't never heard that message
[1:10:44] before yeah it's it's on tape
[1:10:49] 1963 they said we' never heard the
[1:10:52] tape
[1:10:55] and yet he was
[1:10:57] there Jesus he had
[1:11:00] already made his tapes he had already
[1:11:04] recorded his
[1:11:05] voice in the hearts of the
[1:11:08] people and the church
[1:11:12] world didn't know it the prophets had
[1:11:15] spoken of
[1:11:17] it but they weren't waiting for it and
[1:11:21] even the Prophecies of today
[1:11:24] that have been brought to light for our
[1:11:27] day they've been
[1:11:29] spoken and people aren't looking for
[1:11:32] them people aren't waiting for them
[1:11:36] they'd rather wait on something that's
[1:11:37] not even written in the
[1:11:40] word and you know when that will come to
[1:11:43] pass don't
[1:11:44] you
[1:11:47] never only what God Said thus sayith the
[1:11:51] Lord will come to pass
[1:11:54] if it's not written in the word if it's
[1:11:57] not thus sayith the Lord it will not
[1:12:04] happen there are three
[1:12:06] parts in this plan of
[1:12:09] God at the first coming of
[1:12:12] Christ the first began with an
[1:12:14] incredible Supernatural healing
[1:12:19] campaign that gathered and and healed
[1:12:22] thousands
[1:12:25] the lamb was drawing the
[1:12:28] attention of the
[1:12:30] people they had never seen anything like
[1:12:33] this
[1:12:34] before they'd never seen the lame
[1:12:37] walk they'd never seen the blind to
[1:12:42] see they'd never seen the deaf
[1:12:46] here they certainly had never seen the
[1:12:49] dead
[1:12:51] rise it was the it was the first
[1:12:54] part of this plan of
[1:12:57] God unfolding from the Lamb's Book of
[1:13:01] Life it was the first poll of the
[1:13:05] ministry of this king of the
[1:13:07] Jews but he wouldn't come as a king he
[1:13:11] was a king but the king would
[1:13:15] descend and never declare himself
[1:13:18] King but rather he would declare himself
[1:13:21] a servant to the people
[1:13:25] and he come as an
[1:13:26] evangelist praying for the sick working
[1:13:30] night and
[1:13:31] day preaching the Kingdom of Heaven has
[1:13:35] come and I'm unfolding this Lamb's Book
[1:13:38] of
[1:13:41] Life as he prayed for the
[1:13:44] sick the second part of the
[1:13:47] ministry began to
[1:13:50] unfold part two second pool and while
[1:13:55] he's praying for the
[1:13:56] sick he begins at Discerning the intents
[1:13:59] of the
[1:14:01] hearts that in
[1:14:04] itself Vindicated Jesus to the
[1:14:09] people as a prophetic
[1:14:13] Ministry because only
[1:14:17] God knows the intents of the
[1:14:21] heart and then the Third part of his
[1:14:24] ministry he would begin unfolding to
[1:14:29] them and reveal to them the
[1:14:32] word his word his Plan of Redemption his
[1:14:37] Plan of Salvation his plan of how you
[1:14:41] can be born
[1:14:43] again and go from a natural
[1:14:46] birth to a supernatural
[1:14:49] birth go from a fallen
[1:14:52] birth an Immaculate
[1:14:55] birth the Born Again
[1:14:58] experience growing into the stature of a
[1:15:01] perfect man Jesus
[1:15:04] Christ these are the three
[1:15:07] parts of the plan of
[1:15:09] God as the Lamb's Book of Life is
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:14] opening the first coming of
[1:15:18] Christ and these three parts would
[1:15:22] unfold in a fful
[1:15:25] Ministry the fful
[1:15:28] ministry was the ministry of Jesus
[1:15:31] Christ as these three parts are
[1:15:35] unfolding and keep in mind this is a
[1:15:39] pattern of what's happened in our
[1:15:43] day in his first coming
[1:15:47] Jesus he was born King of the
[1:15:50] Jews that's how he came to the Earth
[1:15:54] he left as the Lamb of
[1:15:56] God that's how he left the Earth but he
[1:15:59] unfolded his
[1:16:00] plan to redeem to save to change you and
[1:16:06] I into his
[1:16:08] likeness to give us eternal
[1:16:12] life and through and he did this through
[1:16:15] his fful
[1:16:17] ministry Jesus was an
[1:16:20] evangelist a prophet an apostle
[1:16:24] a teacher a pastor in Matthew 4 you
[1:16:29] remember reading it in our last
[1:16:31] Services verses 12 to
[1:16:35] 25 the King of Kings begins his
[1:16:40] ministry not in a big
[1:16:43] castle but in the poorest
[1:16:46] neighborhoods in the streets of
[1:16:49] Judea in in in in the bad neighborhoods
[1:16:52] of Galilee
[1:16:55] born in one of the worst little cities
[1:16:58] called
[1:17:00] Nazareth to where even one of his
[1:17:02] disciples
[1:17:04] said when they told him come see a man I
[1:17:09] think he's a prophet I think he's
[1:17:12] Messiah where's he from he's from
[1:17:15] Nazareth
[1:17:17] oh can anything good come out of
[1:17:22] Nazareth
[1:17:24] that's like that's like me telling you I
[1:17:27] was born in e in Los
[1:17:29] Angeles is it
[1:17:33] really brother Kenny would tell Rachel
[1:17:36] watch him you know where he's came
[1:17:38] from because if you've ever been there
[1:17:41] you know the
[1:17:42] area anything good come out of Nazareth
[1:17:45] he
[1:17:48] said he said they and rather than argue
[1:17:51] the point with him
[1:17:55] the disciples said come
[1:17:57] see come see for
[1:18:01] yourself so he begins his ministry as
[1:18:04] evangelist matth 4:
[1:18:08] 12-25 But Not only was an
[1:18:11] evangelist but a prophet turn with me to
[1:18:14] Matthew
[1:18:16] 9 and we'll be reading in verse
[1:18:21] four
[1:18:27] we've gone through Matthew chapter 1 to
[1:18:30] chapter
[1:18:33] 10 and we found out that each chapter
[1:18:36] isn't an individual
[1:18:39] story we realize that every chapter is
[1:18:42] an exact walk letting our fingers do the
[1:18:45] walking through the Bible
[1:18:50] Pages we see it all connected just
[1:18:54] perfectly unfolding the ministry of
[1:18:56] Jesus Christ and showing us a
[1:19:00] pattern of things to come so that when
[1:19:03] he does these things
[1:19:05] again as he's done it in our time we
[1:19:09] could recognize him and see he's come
[1:19:12] again and he's appearing to us
[1:19:15] personally even now and he's opening the
[1:19:18] eyes of our
[1:19:20] understanding Glory
[1:19:23] and here in chapter
[1:19:24] nine
[1:19:27] Jesus still doing the work of an
[1:19:31] evangelist and he and someone a man sick
[1:19:35] of the py is brought to
[1:19:38] him and he sees the faith of the people
[1:19:41] that brought
[1:19:43] him and he says
[1:19:46] son be of good
[1:19:49] cheer thy sins be forgiven thee
[1:19:55] you say shouldn't
[1:19:56] he shouldn't he have healed him
[1:20:01] first because if you're really
[1:20:04] sick to tell someone don't
[1:20:08] worry your sins are
[1:20:10] forgiven is he telling me I'm going to
[1:20:14] die why doesn't he tell me I'm I'm I'm
[1:20:18] Healed there was a Divine
[1:20:21] reason because he was entering into
[1:20:23] another part of his
[1:20:26] ministry the prophetic part and he was
[1:20:29] going to provoke
[1:20:31] men to
[1:20:33] say and certain of the scribes said
[1:20:36] within themselves this man
[1:20:42] blasphemed and Jesus knowing their
[1:20:46] thoughts the prophetic
[1:20:48] Ministry had just
[1:20:51] begun
[1:20:53] the and Jesus knowing their thoughts
[1:20:56] where said wherefore think ye evil in
[1:20:59] your
[1:21:02] hearts it had begun Jesus the
[1:21:06] Evangelist in Matthew 5 6 and 7 it was
[1:21:10] Jesus the teacher here in Matthew
[1:21:14] 9 now it's Jesus the prophet and once he
[1:21:18] enters into that
[1:21:20] Ministry he hasn't lost the others
[1:21:23] they're all unfolding
[1:21:25] together but getting
[1:21:32] greater
[1:21:34] unfolding showing
[1:21:36] himself as the Lamb of God acts
[1:21:40] three and verse
[1:21:51] 22
[1:21:57] Peter on the day of
[1:21:59] Pentecost he says for Moses truly said
[1:22:02] unto the
[1:22:05] fathers a prophet shall the Lord your
[1:22:08] God raise up unto you out of your
[1:22:13] brethren like unto me him shall you hear
[1:22:16] in all things whatsoever he shall say
[1:22:19] unto
[1:22:21] you
[1:22:24] and it shall come to pass that every
[1:22:25] soul which will not hear that Prophet
[1:22:28] shall be destroyed from among the
[1:22:33] people what a Ministry this Lamb of God
[1:22:36] had what a Ministry this evangelist
[1:22:40] had what a Ministry this teacher had
[1:22:44] what a Ministry this Prophet
[1:22:47] had he says yay and all the prophets
[1:22:50] from Samuel and those that follow after
[1:22:52] as many as have spoken have likewise
[1:22:55] foretold of these
[1:23:01] days then Jesus says then Peter said ye
[1:23:06] are the children of the
[1:23:08] prophets and of the Covenant which God
[1:23:10] made with our
[1:23:12] fathers saying unto Abraham and in thy
[1:23:16] seed shall all the kindreds of the earth
[1:23:19] be
[1:23:21] blessed
[1:23:23] unto you first
[1:23:25] God having raised up his son
[1:23:28] Jesus sent him to bless
[1:23:31] you in turning away every one of
[1:23:34] you from his
[1:23:37] iniquities it's part of the
[1:23:39] plan for you in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:23:44] to turn our
[1:23:45] hearts Minds
[1:23:48] away from our
[1:23:51] iniquities Jesus the
[1:23:54] Evangelist Jesus the
[1:23:56] prophet Jesus the
[1:23:58] Apostle turn with me to
[1:24:06] Hebrews Hebrews chapter
[1:24:10] three verses 1 to
[1:24:14] 3 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of
[1:24:17] the Heavenly
[1:24:21] calling
[1:24:23] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[1:24:26] our profession Christ
[1:24:31] Jesus the fful ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:24:36] evangelist Prophet Apostle AP turn with
[1:24:41] me to Matthew chapter St John chapter
[1:24:51] 3
[1:25:01] St John chapter
[1:25:05] 3 and verse
[1:25:08] one there was a man of the Pharisees
[1:25:10] named
[1:25:13] Nicodemus a ruler of the
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:18] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[1:25:21] said unto
[1:25:25] him we know that th are a
[1:25:28] teacher come from God for no man can do
[1:25:32] these Miracles that thou doest except
[1:25:35] God be with
[1:25:39] him and then Jesus said a scripture
[1:25:42] we've all known and
[1:25:44] read Jesus answered and said unto
[1:25:47] him verely verely I say unto
[1:25:51] thee except a man be born
[1:25:54] again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:25:58] God Nicodemus had just told
[1:26:01] him we know you're a teacher sent from
[1:26:05] God and he begins teaching him
[1:26:10] immediately and Nicodemus
[1:26:12] says wait a
[1:26:14] minute um how can I be born again when
[1:26:18] I'm
[1:26:21] old
[1:26:24] you're a teacher sent from God
[1:26:27] Jes we can plainly see
[1:26:30] that then Jesus immediately begins
[1:26:32] teaching
[1:26:34] him and he throws the brakes
[1:26:36] on okay okay but maybe not this
[1:26:40] teaching I it's it's
[1:26:45] impossible but he was talking to a
[1:26:47] teacher who was more than a
[1:26:50] teacher and he did didn't realize the
[1:26:54] parable of the prophetic word that was
[1:26:57] being spoken to
[1:26:59] him had he said
[1:27:01] Lord I believe help by my
[1:27:06] unbelief would have been a better
[1:27:09] answer so
[1:27:11] Jesus his five full ministry evangelist
[1:27:15] Prophet Apostle teacher it's all in the
[1:27:19] word the Apostle Paul did did not invent
[1:27:23] the fivefold
[1:27:25] ministry he only got the
[1:27:28] revelation of the fful ministry of Jesus
[1:27:32] Christ and when Jesus said I'm going to
[1:27:34] send gifts unto
[1:27:36] Men book of
[1:27:38] Ephesians he caught the
[1:27:41] Revelation that these were the gifts
[1:27:44] they were Gifts of
[1:27:46] ministry so that the second coming would
[1:27:50] unfold for God's people just like the
[1:27:53] first coming did so that we at the
[1:27:56] second
[1:27:57] coming learn about this Lamb's Book of
[1:28:00] Life and hear the same things they heard
[1:28:04] at the first
[1:28:06] coming and hear the same things that
[1:28:09] were told to Adam in the
[1:28:12] beginning things that he didn't bring to
[1:28:15] pass things that he couldn't live but
[1:28:18] God said in his word my word will not
[1:28:22] return
[1:28:23] voidage I've got a people whose names
[1:28:26] are in my
[1:28:28] book and if you can believe it's your
[1:28:30] name in the
[1:28:32] book surely you can believe you're the
[1:28:35] one God will keep his word
[1:28:38] in you will be the sons and
[1:28:41] daughters manifested on the
[1:28:44] earth in this wicked
[1:28:49] generation but he was also a pastor
[1:28:53] not just evangelist not just Prophet not
[1:28:57] just
[1:28:58] Apostle not only a
[1:29:01] teacher but the pastor turn with me to
[1:29:04] First
[1:29:13] Peter First
[1:29:15] Peter chapter
[1:29:20] 5
[1:29:25] see is that
[1:29:30] right First Peter chapter 5 let's begin
[1:29:34] at verse
[1:29:36] one
[1:29:38] Peter speaking
[1:29:40] here the elders which are among you I
[1:29:45] exhort who am also an
[1:29:47] elder and a witness of the sufferings of
[1:29:50] Christ
[1:29:52] and also a partaker of the
[1:29:56] glory that shall be
[1:29:59] revealed feed the flock of God which is
[1:30:02] among
[1:30:03] you taking the oversight
[1:30:07] thereof Peter is speaking to the fful
[1:30:11] ministry to men who are
[1:30:14] called to keep a part of the ministry of
[1:30:17] Jesus
[1:30:20] Christ
[1:30:23] amongst the children of
[1:30:27] God he said feed the flock of God which
[1:30:29] is among you taking the oversight
[1:30:31] thereof not by constraint but willingly
[1:30:35] not for filthy looker but of a ready
[1:30:45] mind Peter is speaking to the fful
[1:30:49] ministry he says neither as being Lords
[1:30:53] over God's
[1:30:57] Heritage that means
[1:31:01] Ministry has no right to tell
[1:31:03] you where you have to live what church
[1:31:07] you must go to no you have to be led of
[1:31:10] the spirit for
[1:31:12] that brother Bram himself
[1:31:16] said I'm not a
[1:31:18] dictator to tell you where to live or
[1:31:22] where to go you seek God for those
[1:31:30] answers you can ask my
[1:31:33] advice we can
[1:31:35] share based on
[1:31:40] circumstances but the final
[1:31:43] decision is yours in prayer be a House
[1:31:48] of
[1:31:49] Prayer ask God because he's a listener
[1:31:54] he's the best
[1:31:58] listener he's not like
[1:32:01] us he is a true
[1:32:08] listener a gentleman once
[1:32:11] said my wife accuses
[1:32:14] me of being a very poor
[1:32:18] listener and uh and she's and and she
[1:32:22] she she said there's only two things she
[1:32:24] doesn't like about
[1:32:28] me one of them is I never match my
[1:32:31] clothes
[1:32:34] properly and the other one I don't
[1:32:36] remember I wasn't
[1:32:39] listening so as
[1:32:42] men we're not very good
[1:32:44] listeners but Jesus Christ listens to
[1:32:48] every word you
[1:32:50] say and he wants to answer
[1:32:53] you and he'll meet you in your prayer
[1:32:57] closet with an
[1:32:58] answer every
[1:33:01] time neither is being Lords over God's
[1:33:04] Heritage but being examples to the
[1:33:10] flock and when the chief Shepherd shall
[1:33:15] appear you shall receive a Crown of
[1:33:19] Glory that faded not not away
[1:33:22] he's speaking to the
[1:33:24] Ministries he's speaking to the fful
[1:33:27] ministry and if you do as he
[1:33:31] says when the chief chief Shepherd shall
[1:33:36] appear you shall receive a Crown of
[1:33:40] Glory that fadeth not
[1:33:43] away if you're an
[1:33:46] example if you're a
[1:33:48] servant if you're not being Lords over
[1:33:51] his heritage
[1:33:54] if you're unfolding the ministry I gave
[1:33:57] you if you're looking in the
[1:34:00] scriptures to see how I was an
[1:34:03] evangelist if you're looking in the
[1:34:05] scriptures to see how I was a
[1:34:08] pastor if you're look in the scriptures
[1:34:10] to see how I was a
[1:34:13] prophet if you're look in the scriptures
[1:34:15] to see how I was an
[1:34:18] apostle if you if you unfold the
[1:34:20] ministry just that
[1:34:23] way when I appear you'll receive a Crown
[1:34:27] of
[1:34:28] Glory fth not
[1:34:31] away that's eternal
[1:34:33] life the fightful
[1:34:36] ministry of Jesus Christ was is
[1:34:40] unfolding in this Lamb's Book of
[1:34:44] Life and it it unfolded all the way to
[1:34:47] chapter
[1:34:50] 10 of Matthew
[1:34:52] where God begins to put his church in
[1:34:57] order to send them
[1:35:00] out gives them a message to
[1:35:03] preach the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:35:06] hand gives them
[1:35:08] gifts along with their
[1:35:13] callings to display the Life of
[1:35:17] Christ and in verse
[1:35:20] 11 Jesus moves
[1:35:22] in to another part of his
[1:35:25] ministry the part that he would keep
[1:35:28] with
[1:35:29] him till he left the
[1:35:31] scene the
[1:35:34] lamb he would enter the lamb
[1:35:37] Ministry because the
[1:35:39] lamb is the
[1:35:41] revealer of the
[1:35:43] book it's in the Bible turn with me to
[1:35:49] Revelations chapter 6
[1:36:00] and it reads like this in closing
[1:36:02] now and I
[1:36:04] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[1:36:09] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[1:36:12] of
[1:36:13] thunder and one of the for be
[1:36:16] saying come and
[1:36:18] see and when this came to pass
[1:36:23] it happened in the Lamb's
[1:36:25] Book in the Book of Matthew chapter
[1:36:29] 11 this prophecy became history and it
[1:36:34] was there where the
[1:36:36] lamb Christ opened up his
[1:36:40] plan fully opened the
[1:36:43] book and was given it to
[1:36:47] Israel in parables in a prophetic word
[1:36:51] in
[1:36:53] Proverbs and they didn't catch it they
[1:36:56] didn't see it they weren't ordained to
[1:36:58] see
[1:36:59] it but you and I
[1:37:02] are and the lamb is still the revealer
[1:37:05] of the
[1:37:06] word and when you when you hear the
[1:37:10] sermons of a
[1:37:12] prophet when he preached the Seven
[1:37:16] Seals if I'm not
[1:37:18] mistaken in every ser
[1:37:22] first seal second
[1:37:25] seal he always says and now the lamb
[1:37:29] will open the
[1:37:31] book prophecy has become history before
[1:37:36] our very eyes as we stand to our feet
[1:37:40] Lord willing Sunday we'll enter into
[1:37:44] chapter
[1:37:46] 11 of the Book of Matthew because
[1:37:49] chapter 11 is chapter six of the Book of
[1:37:54] Revelations one is the
[1:37:56] prophecy written in
[1:37:58] symbols the other is the the symbols
[1:38:02] walking off the Bible
[1:38:06] Pages in the life of
[1:38:09] men like John the
[1:38:11] Baptist and Jesus Christ let's pray
[1:38:15] Heavenly Father we thank you once
[1:38:19] again that you the lamb
[1:38:21] you are still opening your book to
[1:38:24] us you're still revealing this great
[1:38:27] plan of how once again we can be
[1:38:32] restored how we can be perfect even as
[1:38:35] Our Father which is in heaven is
[1:38:39] perfect and Lord when you preached on
[1:38:41] this message of
[1:38:44] perfection you showed us in your in the
[1:38:46] Lamb's Book of
[1:38:48] Life every step that we need needed to
