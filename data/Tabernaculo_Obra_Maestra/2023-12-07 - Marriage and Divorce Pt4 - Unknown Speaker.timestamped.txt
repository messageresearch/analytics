[59:47] children uh at least myself growing up
[59:50] here in the United
[59:53] States from the time I was in first
[59:57] grade the first thing the teacher would
[1:00:01] do and she stand us she'd ask us all to
[1:00:04] stand
[1:00:05] up then she'd say put your hand on your
[1:00:10] heart and we would write uh and we would
[1:00:14] recite I pledge
[1:00:17] allegiance to the the United States of
[1:00:21] America and we would PR when we would
[1:00:23] pledge allegiance
[1:00:26] we didn't understand exactly what we
[1:00:28] were
[1:00:30] doing but but something was being placed
[1:00:33] in our
[1:00:35] hearts uh to be
[1:00:38] proud of the place that God had allowed
[1:00:41] us to
[1:00:43] live and we're still
[1:00:46] happy to be living here in these United
[1:00:50] States we've had the opportunity to

[1:01:16] Brazil Brazil all these different
[1:01:20] places wonderful Christian
[1:01:23] people
[1:01:25] but they don't have the
[1:01:27] privilege of living in a
[1:01:30] country that that that offers them as
[1:01:33] many
[1:01:34] freedoms and
[1:01:36] opportunities as the United
[1:01:38] States it
[1:01:40] did but all those freedoms are quickly
[1:01:46] Vanishing and Bible prophecy is coming
[1:01:48] to
[1:01:50] pass but but but the kingdom where most
[1:01:54] uh proud of saying we're a part
[1:01:59] of we're thankful to live in this
[1:02:03] nation we you it's it's the best life

[1:02:15] proud to be part of a supernatural
[1:02:20] Kingdom proud to be a part of a mystical
[1:02:23] body
[1:02:25] proud to be the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ and who is the bride the bride is
[1:02:31] the wife who is preparing
[1:02:35] herself adorning herself getting the
[1:02:38] wedding dress
[1:02:40] ready for that wedding
[1:02:43] day for a great ceremonial
[1:02:47] day when the
[1:02:48] bridegroom it's on that day where he
[1:02:52] catches her away to live with him
[1:02:56] eternally so we are we are proud to be
[1:02:59] part of that
[1:03:01] kingdom kingdom of God and his
[1:03:04] Christ that's an eternal
[1:03:07] Kingdom this one will
[1:03:09] end it is ending we see it the
[1:03:13] handwriting is written on the
[1:03:16] wall judgment has been
[1:03:19] pronounced to to the world but but to
[1:03:23] the of Jesus
[1:03:26] Christ God has given her a
[1:03:28] plan to
[1:03:31] escape the wrath of the
[1:03:33] lamb and instead be the Lamb's
[1:03:38] wife and be caught away from this life
[1:03:42] to life
[1:03:44] eternal so as we read once
[1:03:48] more as we continue with this
[1:03:52] thought marriage and divorce
[1:03:55] in our day part four and and and the way
[1:03:59] we approach
[1:04:01] it this subject will be in this way in
[1:04:06] the mouth of two or three
[1:04:08] Witnesses let everything be
[1:04:13] established as you know the truth of
[1:04:16] marriage and
[1:04:17] divorce is established in the mouth of
[1:04:20] three
[1:04:21] Witnesses and if you don't bring those
[1:04:23] three Witnesses
[1:04:25] forward we will never come even close to
[1:04:28] the
[1:04:30] truth and even when we come to the full
[1:04:33] truth we we realize that the permissive
[1:04:39] will is something that that most people
[1:04:43] will will only be able to
[1:04:46] have until God takes us from this
[1:04:50] world so in first Thessalonians chap
[1:04:54] chapter
[1:04:56] 4 and once again we'd like to read the
[1:04:59] first seven
[1:05:02] verses 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse
[1:05:07] one furthermore then we beseech you
[1:05:09] Brethren and exhort you by the Lord
[1:05:16] Jesus that as you have received of us
[1:05:18] how ye ought to walk and to please God
[1:05:21] so ye would abound more and more
[1:05:30] for you know what Commandments we gave
[1:05:32] you by the Lord
[1:05:36] Jesus for this is the will of God even
[1:05:40] your
[1:05:43] sanctification the will of God your holy
[1:05:48] living then he says that ye should
[1:05:50] abstain from
[1:05:53] fornication that every one of you should
[1:05:55] know how to possess his vessel in
[1:05:58] sanctification and
[1:06:02] honor not in the lust of
[1:06:06] concupiscence even as the Gentiles which
[1:06:08] know not
[1:06:10] God that no man go beyond and Def frud
[1:06:14] his brother in any
[1:06:18] matter because the Lord is the Avenger
[1:06:20] of all
[1:06:22] such as we also have forewarned you and
[1:06:27] testified for God ha not called us unto
[1:06:33] uncleanness yes God is
[1:06:36] good God is
[1:06:38] merciful but God has not called us unto
[1:06:43] uncleanness but unto
[1:06:46] Holiness let's pray Heavenly Father we
[1:06:49] thank
[1:06:51] you bless the reading of your word to
[1:06:53] our heart
[1:06:56] you the Lamb of God are the
[1:06:59] revealer for for the book we've opened
[1:07:03] tonight is the Lamb's Book of
[1:07:07] Life so it's the lamb who will reveal
[1:07:11] it Lamb of God Open the Eyes of our
[1:07:16] understanding and tenderize our
[1:07:19] hearts to receive it in Jesus name we
[1:07:24] ask it amen amen you may be
[1:07:27] seated so as we
[1:07:29] said there are three Witnesses in this
[1:07:31] great
[1:07:34] truth and if you don't bring all three
[1:07:36] Witnesses
[1:07:38] together you'll not have the complete
[1:07:41] truth first Moses gave us an
[1:07:44] account of what he saw by
[1:07:47] vision of what God did and said in
[1:07:51] Genesis then Jesus Christ
[1:07:54] himself he spoke to us in his Earthly
[1:07:58] Ministry concerning this
[1:08:00] truth then in the form of the Holy
[1:08:04] Spirit he gives Paul a prophet and
[1:08:09] Apostle another portion and more
[1:08:12] detailed to the
[1:08:14] subject then once again the Holy Spirit
[1:08:18] comes down and he shows a prophet in our
[1:08:22] day
[1:08:24] brother William brandham how to bring
[1:08:27] all those loose ends
[1:08:31] together he wrote nothing new because
[1:08:34] the book has already been
[1:08:37] written he was just to show us and bring
[1:08:40] us the
[1:08:43] Revelation and bring these three
[1:08:45] Witnesses
[1:08:47] together so we could see the truth for
[1:08:50] we've had the Bible for hundreds of
[1:08:52] years
[1:08:55] and and and the longer we have
[1:08:57] it we have thousands of
[1:09:01] interpretations but God must have one
[1:09:03] voice to Proclaim his
[1:09:06] truth and that one voice since the
[1:09:09] beginning has been the prophets of
[1:09:12] God the prophets of God the Bible said
[1:09:15] the law and the prophets were until
[1:09:19] John and then it says and since then the
[1:09:23] kingdom of God is
[1:09:25] preached yeah the revelation of the
[1:09:28] word so God didn't put an end to the
[1:09:31] prophetic
[1:09:33] Ministry at the New
[1:09:35] Testament
[1:09:37] no no he changed the
[1:09:40] ministry he changed the style of
[1:09:43] Ministry of the prophets of a New
[1:09:47] Covenant they wouldn't be coming out of
[1:09:50] the mountain speaking
[1:09:52] judgment but they were to live amongst
[1:09:55] the
[1:09:56] people and and and preach the kingdom of
[1:10:00] heaven and and and point out where the
[1:10:02] Lamb of God
[1:10:04] was even as John did in the
[1:10:09] beginning from Genesis to
[1:10:12] Revelations the truth has always been in
[1:10:14] the
[1:10:15] Bible it simply took a prophetic
[1:10:18] gift to pull them together for the Bride
[1:10:22] of Jesus Christ
[1:10:24] and it'll take a prophetic
[1:10:27] Insight in your life to catch
[1:10:32] it Matthew 19 verse 8
[1:10:36] and9 Jesus
[1:10:39] speaking in Matthew 19 Jesus had
[1:10:42] finished some
[1:10:46] sayings Proverbs and Parables he'd been
[1:10:48] speaking to the
[1:10:50] people praying and Healing The Sick
[1:10:54] great multitudes that followed
[1:10:56] him in this great multitude was
[1:11:00] Pharisees and
[1:11:02] Sadducees and and
[1:11:05] Priests trying to find fault with
[1:11:08] him so they asked them the great
[1:11:11] question is it lawful for a man to put
[1:11:14] away his wife for every
[1:11:19] cause verse
[1:11:22] three
[1:11:25] and he answered them and
[1:11:27] said have you not been reading the
[1:11:29] message of the
[1:11:32] hour that he which made them from the
[1:11:34] beginning made them male and
[1:11:38] female and said for this cause shall a
[1:11:40] manly father and
[1:11:43] mother and shall cleave to his wife and
[1:11:47] they twain shall be one
[1:11:49] flesh wherefore they are no more Twain
[1:11:52] but one flesh
[1:11:54] and and then he tells him what therefore
[1:11:57] God has joined
[1:11:59] together how dare you man put it
[1:12:03] aunder for any
[1:12:06] reason they said unto him well why did
[1:12:09] Moses give us a writing of divorcement
[1:12:11] to put her
[1:12:15] away he says oh yes he did didn't
[1:12:18] he mes that great
[1:12:21] prophet who who walked in the in in the
[1:12:24] Mountain of
[1:12:25] God and the fire and the lightning was
[1:12:28] up
[1:12:29] there you mean that
[1:12:31] Moses he he gave you a writing a
[1:12:34] divorcement they said yeah that's the
[1:12:37] one why did he do it then great man of
[1:12:41] God he says
[1:12:43] Moses because of the hardness of your
[1:12:47] hearts suffered you to put away your
[1:12:51] wives but from the beginning
[1:12:54] it wasn't
[1:12:59] so verse
[1:13:01] eight he saith and he says Moses because
[1:13:05] of the hardness of your heart suffered
[1:13:06] you to put away your wives but from the
[1:13:09] beginning it wasn't
[1:13:16] so so
[1:13:18] Jesus had taken them back to the
[1:13:22] beginning
[1:13:23] Jesus was connecting
[1:13:26] scriptures Jesus was bringing the loose
[1:13:29] ends
[1:13:31] together Jesus was showing him the
[1:13:33] reason for what Moses had
[1:13:44] done in Matthew
[1:13:46] 5 Jesus
[1:13:49] said it had been said who's verse 31 it
[1:13:53] had been said whosoever shall put away
[1:13:55] his wife let him give her a writing of
[1:14:00] divorce but I say unto you that
[1:14:03] whosoever shall put away his wife saving
[1:14:05] for the cause of
[1:14:08] fornication causes her to commit
[1:14:11] adultery and whosoever shall marry her
[1:14:13] that is
[1:14:15] divorced committeth adultery the words
[1:14:18] of Jesus the words of God and he hasn't
[1:14:22] changed his mind about his
[1:14:27] word the prophet said this scripture
[1:14:31] this question confronted Jesus at the
[1:14:33] very beginning of his
[1:14:39] ministry he said it confronted Moses at
[1:14:42] his
[1:14:44] ministry he said where whenever a
[1:14:47] question of religion comes
[1:14:50] up the marriage and divorce question
[1:14:52] comes up
[1:14:55] he says because it's the original
[1:14:59] sin so Jesus in our
[1:15:02] text invited us to go back to the
[1:15:05] beginning for the true scriptural
[1:15:09] answer but the final
[1:15:12] answer is in three
[1:15:14] parts the final answer is in three
[1:15:20] Witnesses so Jesus invites us
[1:15:24] to go back to the beginning for the true
[1:15:27] scriptural
[1:15:30] answer the priest said to him can a man
[1:15:32] put away his wife and marry another for
[1:15:35] any
[1:15:41] cause Jesus said it wasn't so from the
[1:15:45] beginning Jesus had opened the book at
[1:15:49] his first coming the book he opened was
[1:15:53] the Lamb's Book of
[1:15:55] Life it it was a book on teaching us
[1:15:59] how to get back to the
[1:16:02] beginning how to get back in a
[1:16:04] friendship with the
[1:16:06] father of how to get back into the
[1:16:09] presence of
[1:16:10] God that's what the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:13] was
[1:16:14] about that's this new
[1:16:17] testament the Lamb's Book of Life is not
[1:16:19] an abstract thought
[1:16:22] somewhere
[1:16:24] we've had it we've carried it in our
[1:16:27] hands all our
[1:16:29] lives this new
[1:16:31] testament this is the
[1:16:33] Lamb
[1:16:35] testifying of how you and I can have the
[1:16:39] life of the
[1:16:40] Lamb yet it a fallen condition because
[1:16:45] that's what will take us back to the
[1:16:48] beginning lamb
[1:16:50] life will take us back to to to a place
[1:16:54] where the lamb will live forever with
[1:16:59] us God never did change his mind about
[1:17:02] it we read Malachi
[1:17:05] 2 where God spoke to
[1:17:08] Israel and and and and and Malachi under
[1:17:12] the anointing the prophetic
[1:17:15] anointing he he pounded the
[1:17:19] priesthood and the head of every home of
[1:17:22] Israel
[1:17:24] and Malachi 2:14
[1:17:26] says yet ye say
[1:17:30] wherefore because the Lord have been a
[1:17:32] witness between thee and the wife of thy
[1:17:38] youth because the wife of thy
[1:17:41] youth she is thy
[1:17:44] wife that's
[1:17:49] her he says the Lord has witnessed
[1:17:53] between thee and the wife of thy
[1:17:57] youth listen to
[1:17:59] Malachi speak to the men and the priest
[1:18:02] of
[1:18:03] Israel against whom thou has dealt
[1:18:08] treacherously and even though you've
[1:18:10] mistreated
[1:18:12] her yet she is thy
[1:18:16] companion not the second third fourth
[1:18:18] and
[1:18:19] fifth no the wife of thy youth she is
[1:18:23] thy
[1:18:24] companion before God and the wife of thy
[1:18:29] Covenant God didn't change his
[1:18:32] mind Malachi the
[1:18:35] prophet 400 years before the coming of
[1:18:40] Christ preparing the
[1:18:42] way so Jesus first took them
[1:18:46] back to the
[1:18:48] beginning and at the
[1:18:51] beginning there was only one pair of
[1:18:55] anything Jesus if Jesus said go back to
[1:18:58] the
[1:18:59] beginning and there was only one pair of
[1:19:02] anything on the
[1:19:04] earth there was one Adam one Eve one Eve
[1:19:09] they were joined by God
[1:19:11] Alone one female
[1:19:14] horse one male one female
[1:19:18] parrot one male at the beginning as he
[1:19:23] told us to go back
[1:19:25] there there was only one pair of
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:29] anything this is true then we find out
[1:19:32] that everything in the
[1:19:35] beginning was running in perfect order
[1:19:38] and harmony with
[1:19:41] God nothing was out of
[1:19:44] cater one pair of of any
[1:19:48] species ma in for
[1:19:51] life
[1:19:55] was God's perfect
[1:19:57] order at the
[1:19:59] beginning multiple
[1:20:02] partners between male and
[1:20:07] female was not in the
[1:20:09] beginning before the fall of God's
[1:20:13] children in Genesis 3 having multiple
[1:20:18] partners is what brought the
[1:20:21] fall it's what brought
[1:20:23] sin the the serpent introduced
[1:20:27] Eve to
[1:20:29] polygamy and when she partook of this
[1:20:32] act of
[1:20:35] fornication it broke her harmony with
[1:20:38] God it broke her harmony with her
[1:20:42] husband and threw the whole world out of
[1:20:46] cater Eve through Eve by her
[1:20:49] Disobedience to the word of
[1:20:51] God
[1:20:53] all the humanity out of
[1:20:58] CER and and and and with man
[1:21:02] Fallen the animal kingdom fell out of
[1:21:07] cater and when and when the animal
[1:21:10] kingdom fell out of
[1:21:14] cater all of the all of the plant life
[1:21:17] fell out of
[1:21:19] cater what happened is death struck
[1:21:22] every everything that once had
[1:21:26] life but even more than
[1:21:29] that that that serpent mixed his
[1:21:33] seed with the seed of
[1:21:35] man and It produced a hybrid man and
[1:21:41] woman that we are
[1:21:43] today with a polygamy polygamous
[1:21:48] inclination towards
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:51] fornication
[1:21:53] multiple sex
[1:21:55] partners and murders and
[1:22:00] lying that's the nature of the
[1:22:03] serpent that's in you and I
[1:22:07] today because of a sex
[1:22:10] birth that was that's the curse that's
[1:22:13] upon the human
[1:22:15] [Music]
[1:22:16] race that's why we must be born
[1:22:19] again to receive a new nature
[1:22:23] a new spirit so they can so that we can
[1:22:26] practice our
[1:22:29] courtship unto marriage in
[1:22:32] Holiness and keep a vow until death do
[1:22:36] us
[1:22:38] part otherwise you will play the dating
[1:22:43] game that that's that the serpent
[1:22:45] presented to the human
[1:22:48] race through the lust of the
[1:22:50] flesh defile in each other in filth and
[1:22:57] immorality having multiple sex
[1:23:00] partners just like all the Beast of the
[1:23:05] field just like all the animals in the
[1:23:10] forest proving once again that a man
[1:23:14] without the holy
[1:23:16] spirit is just another brute
[1:23:19] Beast so in the beginning
[1:23:23] this is what brought the
[1:23:25] fall God's children had
[1:23:28] fallen the continuity was
[1:23:32] broken the lifeline was
[1:23:36] broken the timeline was
[1:23:40] broken the Covenant was
[1:23:42] broken everything
[1:23:45] shattered The Vessel of
[1:23:48] clay Adam and
[1:23:51] Eve that the that the that the master
[1:23:54] Potter was
[1:23:57] forming he had left it for a
[1:24:00] moment and Satan
[1:24:03] came the Great Dragon and he used this
[1:24:07] Beast to shatter that clay
[1:24:12] product Eve and Adam and separate them
[1:24:17] from their God from their
[1:24:21] promise
[1:24:24] the Covenant was
[1:24:27] broken everything
[1:24:29] shattered what caused
[1:24:32] it a
[1:24:34] woman that's what broke the
[1:24:38] Covenant now if you want to read that
[1:24:41] you can read it in Genesis
[1:24:45] 3 it was then man was it was then that
[1:24:49] man was made to rule over the woman
[1:24:55] that's part of the
[1:24:58] curse that's part of the
[1:25:01] Fall she was she was now no more
[1:25:04] co-equal with her
[1:25:07] Adam she was co-equal in nature you
[1:25:11] know that's how God made them in the
[1:25:14] beginning but when she broke God's
[1:25:17] word God made a man to be a ruler over
[1:25:21] her
[1:25:23] you can read it in Genesis
[1:25:25] 3:16 and she was no more equal with the
[1:25:29] man she was the breaker of God's
[1:25:33] word that's not how God wanted it to
[1:25:37] be that's not how God made the woman in
[1:25:40] the
[1:25:42] beginning in the beginning God made
[1:25:46] Eve coequal with
[1:25:50] Adam it's what he wanted for his
[1:25:53] daughters it's what he wanted the
[1:25:56] helpmate for his son to
[1:25:59] be go equal but
[1:26:02] sin
[1:26:04] destroyed God's desire for
[1:26:07] them they broke God's
[1:26:10] word before the
[1:26:12] fall the woman was
[1:26:15] coequal in all
[1:26:17] creation and he and he made her for and
[1:26:20] he made her for man
[1:26:22] and not man for
[1:26:24] her did you know that woman was made for
[1:26:29] man and not man for
[1:26:33] woman how many knows that the Bible
[1:26:36] teaches that she was given a place in
[1:26:40] man before the fall equal over all
[1:26:45] creation but after the
[1:26:48] fall now here we bring the subject up
[1:26:53] after the
[1:26:55] fall he was now her
[1:26:58] ruler she must kept silent in all
[1:27:02] matters now after the original
[1:27:07] beginning is
[1:27:10] over and now after the
[1:27:13] fall each must have a separate
[1:27:17] Covenant they didn't in the
[1:27:20] beginning they were under one
[1:27:23] they were under one
[1:27:25] message they were under one
[1:27:27] promise man and the woman but after the
[1:27:31] fall each must have a separate
[1:27:36] Covenant but Jesus on the cross of
[1:27:40] Calvary
[1:27:41] died to take his sons to take his sons
[1:27:46] and his
[1:27:47] daughters back to how it was in the
[1:27:51] beginning
[1:27:53] you can even have that kind of
[1:27:55] relationship with your wife
[1:28:00] now it's what God wants us to go
[1:28:04] to it's the goal that he wants us to
[1:28:08] have but one day we'll be fully
[1:28:12] restored we will not wrestle with this
[1:28:15] flesh
[1:28:16] anymore we'll be
[1:28:19] free and one day in God's King
[1:28:24] again you'll meet up with your
[1:28:29] companion and you'll be
[1:28:31] coequal in the very presence of
[1:28:34] God Genesis
[1:28:37] 3:14 is God on his
[1:28:39] throne judging everyone on the
[1:28:43] earth it's a white Throne
[1:28:46] judgment it's
[1:28:48] unfolding and here in Genesis 3:14
[1:28:52] this is where God took back the book
[1:28:54] from
[1:28:56] Adam the book yes John saw what happened
[1:29:01] here in Genesis 4,000 years
[1:29:05] later and fills in the
[1:29:09] detail that Moses didn't see that Moses
[1:29:13] didn't
[1:29:14] write and Revelations
[1:29:17] 51 because Revelations
[1:29:20] 51 was John seeing
[1:29:24] God putting Adam and Eve out of his
[1:29:30] presence with a book in his
[1:29:32] hand sealed with Seven
[1:29:35] Seals it was the
[1:29:37] plan to restore Adam and
[1:29:41] Eve as he's putting Adam and Eve out of
[1:29:44] his
[1:29:46] presence God is holding in his
[1:29:49] hand the plan to restore Resto
[1:29:52] them but before he can restore
[1:29:56] them we must be
[1:29:58] born All God's Children on the
[1:30:01] Earth but we've been
[1:30:04] compromised we can't we were not we're
[1:30:06] not coming by the spoken word
[1:30:10] now now we must come by a
[1:30:13] process that the serpent gave to
[1:30:17] Eve a slow
[1:30:20] process a fallen process
[1:30:23] an animal
[1:30:26] process and all must be born that way
[1:30:29] now that's what Eve sold us out
[1:30:33] to that's what Adam sold us out
[1:30:37] to so now God has been
[1:30:40] waiting for 7,000 years for his last son
[1:30:44] his last
[1:30:46] daughter to be born so he can take the
[1:30:50] book and put put it in their
[1:30:54] hands a book that will change
[1:30:57] them Quicken them and finally translate
[1:31:01] us back to the beginning by the power of
[1:31:05] the Holy
[1:31:06] Spirit Genesis 3 and verse
[1:31:10] 14 and the Lord God said unto the
[1:31:13] serpent because thou has done this Thou
[1:31:15] Art cursed above all
[1:31:20] cattle
[1:31:23] and above every beast of the
[1:31:26] field listen to The
[1:31:28] Curse the curse was upon thy belly shall
[1:31:32] thou
[1:31:35] go because he wasn't upon his
[1:31:39] belly because the serpent wasn't a
[1:31:42] reptile the serpent was a
[1:31:45] mammal the serpent was the most subtile
[1:31:48] beast of the
[1:31:50] field the curse put put him on his
[1:31:53] belly and thus sht thou eat all the days
[1:31:56] of thy
[1:31:57] life and I will put emnity between thee
[1:32:00] and the
[1:32:03] woman and between thy
[1:32:06] seed what would the Serpent's Seed
[1:32:09] be serpent
[1:32:12] seed the Bible couldn't say it any
[1:32:16] clearer I I will put
[1:32:19] enity between the serpent
[1:32:23] seed and her seed the woman seed and it
[1:32:27] shall bruise thy
[1:32:28] head and thou shalt bruise his heel it
[1:32:32] was a
[1:32:33] prophecy the woman's
[1:32:35] seed would be the Original
[1:32:37] Seed it would be the spoken word
[1:32:41] seed it's how all the family of God
[1:32:44] should have come in the
[1:32:48] beginning God was tutoring Adam and Eve
[1:32:53] to bring forth the family of
[1:32:56] God even as the father had created from
[1:32:59] the dust of the
[1:33:02] earth a body for his son
[1:33:05] Adam and then called that spirit and put
[1:33:08] that Spirit into that body of
[1:33:13] clay and and Adam and Eve
[1:33:16] together should have been partakers in
[1:33:19] bringing forth the family of God
[1:33:23] by the Spoken Word by The Original
[1:33:27] Seed by watching the example of how the
[1:33:30] father did
[1:33:31] it bring forth the family of God that
[1:33:35] way the woman seed was the original
[1:33:40] seed Eve failed to get
[1:33:44] it but God made a promise my word my
[1:33:48] word shall not be returned to me
[1:33:50] void
[1:33:52] and 4,000 years
[1:33:55] passed and God chose a little
[1:33:59] lady a Virgin
[1:34:02] Mary and he chose her to be the
[1:34:06] vessel where the spoken word seed would
[1:34:08] be
[1:34:11] placed and from that spoken word
[1:34:15] seed would come forth the Son of
[1:34:18] God he would be the beginning
[1:34:22] of the
[1:34:23] creation of Sons and Daughters of God
[1:34:27] who would come by the spoken
[1:34:29] word to a supernatural
[1:34:31] birth called Born Again
[1:34:35] experience that's why Jesus said you
[1:34:38] must be born
[1:34:40] again to be loosed of the curse of this
[1:34:43] flesh
[1:34:47] birth Eve failed to get
[1:34:50] it
[1:34:52] God had provided it for
[1:34:56] them and
[1:34:58] Lucifer using the
[1:35:01] serpent said I've got a shortcut for
[1:35:06] you that'll take
[1:35:08] you where God said he would take
[1:35:12] you but I can get you
[1:35:17] there right
[1:35:19] now you don't know when God going to
[1:35:21] bring this to pass in your life do
[1:35:25] you she said no he hasn't told you has
[1:35:30] you he says well I can get you
[1:35:35] there I can make you a
[1:35:38] Creator and do it right
[1:35:42] now he
[1:35:44] didn't he twisted the promise of
[1:35:48] God he corrupted the promise of
[1:35:52] God and when Eve received it Eve was
[1:35:59] corrupted verse 16 unto the woman he
[1:36:04] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:36:07] and thy
[1:36:10] conception it wasn't to be that way in
[1:36:13] the
[1:36:14] beginning it wouldn't be in
[1:36:17] sorrow it wouldn't be in
[1:36:19] pain in sorrow th shall bring forth
[1:36:24] children it was the curse it wasn't so
[1:36:28] in the
[1:36:29] beginning and thy
[1:36:31] desire shall be to thy
[1:36:34] husband because you allowed your
[1:36:37] desire to be to another man
[1:36:41] first and he shall rule over
[1:36:46] Thee the curse what fell upon the woman
[1:36:50] the woman no longer longer co-equal with
[1:36:52] a
[1:36:54] man and God changes her
[1:36:57] Covenant and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:37:00] husband and he shall rule over
[1:37:03] thee and it's this change in Covenant
[1:37:06] for the
[1:37:07] woman that now determines his permissive
[1:37:12] will for the
[1:37:14] Believers concerning how we approach
[1:37:18] marriage also divorce until we are
[1:37:22] restored to the beginning
[1:37:25] again in coequal
[1:37:28] covenants with Jesus
[1:37:31] Christ God's
[1:37:33] desire is to
[1:37:36] restore the man and the woman his son
[1:37:39] and his daughter in co-equal
[1:37:43] covenants and the devil
[1:37:46] again has approached the
[1:37:49] church he says I can get you there
[1:37:53] quicker I can get you there
[1:37:56] faster you don't have to
[1:37:58] wait that's why he's got into the
[1:38:01] churches and brought the fall of all the
[1:38:06] churches that's why fornication and
[1:38:08] adultery runs like a plague through
[1:38:13] churches because they haven't seen it's
[1:38:16] the same plan of Lucifer
[1:38:20] Satan to destroy the
[1:38:23] nation to destroy the churches to
[1:38:26] destroy the marriage
[1:38:28] covenant to destroy the
[1:38:35] family Satan
[1:38:38] desire is to destroy the family of God
[1:38:42] again but because he doesn't know who is
[1:38:46] who he's
[1:38:48] content on destroying every one of
[1:38:51] planet
[1:38:52] Earth it's the cycle we're in
[1:38:56] now wars and rumors of
[1:39:00] wars every everyone's got their finger
[1:39:03] on a
[1:39:05] bomb all over the world everyone's got
[1:39:07] their finger on a
[1:39:11] trigger all over the world men have
[1:39:14] their finger on nuclear
[1:39:20] weapons Lucifer Lu anointing the
[1:39:23] world he's the Pale Horse
[1:39:26] Rider and the pale horse rider
[1:39:29] began at the beginning of the 20th
[1:39:33] century
[1:39:35] 1900 the pale horse rider began his
[1:39:39] ride and when he began one of the first
[1:39:43] things he
[1:39:44] did was begin a World
[1:39:49] War to get that
[1:39:53] woman who is great with
[1:39:57] child called The Bride of Jesus
[1:40:00] Christ it's Revelations 12
[1:40:03] And1 and I saw a woman that was about to
[1:40:07] Bear a
[1:40:09] child the sun was at her
[1:40:12] head that's the grace of
[1:40:15] God the moon was at her
[1:40:18] feet that's the law she stepping upon
[1:40:21] the
[1:40:22] law and living by
[1:40:25] faith she's a woman with
[1:40:28] child tells you she's a married woman
[1:40:31] she's a woman with a
[1:40:33] covenant she's bringing forth her
[1:40:35] husband's
[1:40:37] seed he's about to be
[1:40:39] born Satan wants to destroy that
[1:40:43] seed woman seed that's been placed in
[1:40:46] the womb of this
[1:40:48] bride and bringing forth Christ in
[1:40:53] her the hope of
[1:40:56] glory
[1:40:58] god here he is judging the
[1:41:01] man judging the woman judging The
[1:41:09] Serpent and now the
[1:41:12] woman in Genesis
[1:41:15] 3:16 no longer coequal with a
[1:41:18] man God changes
[1:41:23] now now for this
[1:41:27] woman it's the permissive will of
[1:41:32] God no longer
[1:41:36] co-equal no longer in a co-equal
[1:41:39] covenant
[1:41:43] with Genesis
[1:41:46] 317 and unto Adam he said because thou
[1:41:49] has hearkened unto the voice voice of
[1:41:51] thy
[1:41:54] wife in this
[1:41:56] tribunal in this white Throne
[1:41:59] judgment he judged The
[1:42:01] Serpent and cursed it he brings a curse
[1:42:05] upon the
[1:42:08] woman and in verse 17 now he going to
[1:42:10] deal with Adam the man and unto Adam he
[1:42:14] said because thou has hearkened unto the
[1:42:16] voice of thy
[1:42:18] wife and has eaten of the tree of which
[1:42:21] I commanded thee
[1:42:24] saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed
[1:42:26] is the ground for thy
[1:42:31] sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
[1:42:34] the days of thy
[1:42:37] life he didn't touch Adam in his
[1:42:40] physical
[1:42:42] body but he cursed the
[1:42:44] ground for Adam's
[1:42:49] sake he said he says thorns and thistles
[1:42:52] shall it bring forth to
[1:42:55] thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the
[1:42:59] field in sweat of thy face shall thou
[1:43:02] eat
[1:43:04] bread thou return unto the ground for
[1:43:07] for out of it was thou taken for dust
[1:43:10] Thou Art and unto dust shalt thou
[1:43:16] go this physical body now in a fallen
[1:43:20] condition
[1:43:22] has no
[1:43:23] promise of eternal
[1:43:25] life but it's the
[1:43:27] soul the Son of God this this has been
[1:43:33] perverted this word that we see is is a
[1:43:35] fallen
[1:43:38] image these bodies are no longer in the
[1:43:40] image of
[1:43:42] God but the soul the seed that was
[1:43:46] placed that lays
[1:43:48] within the one that can be B Born
[1:43:51] Again The Flesh cannot be born
[1:43:54] again but when the soul is born
[1:43:57] again then it gives you the
[1:44:00] strength to mortify the the Deeds of
[1:44:03] this
[1:44:05] flesh to overcome the flesh
[1:44:10] desires God made the
[1:44:13] Earth his
[1:44:16] Target to receive his
[1:44:19] Wrath so that his son would not be
[1:44:23] cursed we walked on a cursed
[1:44:27] Earth thns and thistles remind us
[1:44:31] daily of the grace of God and the curse
[1:44:35] on the
[1:44:36] planet the wrath of God on every
[1:44:40] Coast on planet Earth Romans 8:22
[1:44:45] says for we know that the whole creation
[1:44:48] groaneth and travaileth and pain
[1:44:50] together until
[1:44:55] now and has been groaning and
[1:44:59] travailing since that day in
[1:45:02] Eden since that
[1:45:04] tribunal since Earth since God cursed
[1:45:07] the Earth for Adam's
[1:45:10] sake thorns and
[1:45:13] thistles shall it bring forth to
[1:45:16] thee that day on
[1:45:19] Calvary God paid the
[1:45:22] price to take away the
[1:45:25] curse the crown of
[1:45:27] thorns he wore that Crown of
[1:45:32] Thorns making us a
[1:45:34] promise that he would take away that
[1:45:38] curse the Bible says the sweat like
[1:45:41] blood ran down his
[1:45:45] face he was paying the price for that
[1:45:49] curse that today by the sweat of your
[1:45:55] brow will you
[1:45:59] eat from this cursed
[1:46:02] ground everything there was Redemption
[1:46:05] on the cross of
[1:46:07] Calvary the blood of Jesus
[1:46:13] Christ it was the
[1:46:15] seal it was the
[1:46:19] promise in the Lamb's Book of
[1:46:22] Life that he said I shall
[1:46:25] restore I shall restore all that the
[1:46:28] canker worm has
[1:46:30] eaten all that the Palmer worm has
[1:46:33] eaten all that the Locust has
[1:46:36] eaten all that these four worms have
[1:46:39] eaten from Genesis to
[1:46:43] today all these four stages of this of
[1:46:46] this
[1:46:48] Rider the white
[1:46:51] horse the red horse the black horse
[1:46:56] horse I'll take away the curse I'll take
[1:46:59] away death and place life within
[1:47:03] you Adam's
[1:47:06] Covenant did not
[1:47:08] change but his personal
[1:47:11] tutorship and
[1:47:13] adoption with and by the
[1:47:16] father had been indefinitely
[1:47:19] postponed
[1:47:21] the friendship with God had been
[1:47:24] broken he had grieved the spirit of
[1:47:28] God he walked out from behind the Seal
[1:47:31] of
[1:47:32] God when he Le when he listened to Eve a
[1:47:35] deceived
[1:47:38] Church on her
[1:47:40] shortcut on how they could be like
[1:47:43] God through their polygamous
[1:47:47] Act of
[1:47:49] fornication and
[1:47:51] adultery now
[1:47:53] polygamy is
[1:47:55] introduced not only to Eve by the
[1:48:00] serpent but all creation is
[1:48:04] affected not only man and
[1:48:09] woman but all the beasts of the
[1:48:12] field in the
[1:48:14] beginning it was one
[1:48:17] male and one
[1:48:19] female but after the
[1:48:22] fall everything
[1:48:24] fell when this son of God
[1:48:26] fell the first Adam and he brought down
[1:48:30] the entire Animal
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:36] Kingdom that's why now it's one
[1:48:42] bull one
[1:48:44] Bull and many
[1:48:47] cows one Buck a deer
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:52] and and many
[1:48:54] do it wasn't so in the
[1:48:57] beginning it all speaks of the
[1:49:02] fall of what this Beast was anointed to
[1:49:07] do to all of God's
[1:49:10] creation it brought death to
[1:49:13] everything even boty
[1:49:16] life that once
[1:49:19] lived now
[1:49:22] dies nothing has life
[1:49:26] eternal everything
[1:49:29] dies then Jesus
[1:49:33] came with the Lamb's Book of
[1:49:36] Life it's called the New
[1:49:39] Testament and it's a plan for you and
[1:49:42] I how to get
[1:49:44] back in co-equal

[1:49:55] God it's here it's
[1:49:58] arri the Plan of

[1:50:35] returning to our father as we stand to
[1:50:39] our
[1:50:48] feet prior to to the first coming of
[1:50:52] Christ polygamy was a
[1:50:55] covenant to which man fell
[1:50:59] into and all the animal kingdom through
[1:51:03] Lucifer anointing the
[1:51:05] serpent to hybrid Adam's
[1:51:10] race with the seed of the
[1:51:16] serpent but at the coming of Jesus
[1:51:18] Christ
