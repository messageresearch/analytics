[42:42] bring fourth brother Daniel Amen the
[42:45] song touched my heart just was going
[42:47] through the book and uh caught my
[42:50] attention you know decide to look up the
[42:53] words and hear the words you
[42:55] know
[42:57] [Music]
[43:06] when I
[43:10] first when I
[43:12] first heard of
[43:16] Jesus his
[43:18] love and his
[43:22] grace my
[43:24] heart was over
[43:27] overwhelm to
[43:29] think the king would take my
[43:33] place I CED
[43:36] Lord I'll go with you every
[43:42] step of the
[43:45] way that's all I can
[43:50] do my
[43:53] dead to repay
[43:56] I love him too much to
[44:02] fil him
[44:05] now
[44:08] too
[44:10] much too
[44:13] break my
[44:16] thou for I
[44:19] promise the Lord that I'll
[44:24] make it so
[44:27] somehow and now I love
[44:31] him too much to
[44:36] fail him
[44:40] now I told
[44:44] him I Lov him it was
[44:49] easy to
[44:52] say but
[44:54] harder
[44:56] to
[44:58] prove when
[45:00] Temptation came my
[45:03] way for what good all broken
[45:09] promises I
[45:12] counted but
[45:14] lost when I caught the glimpse
[45:20] of to
[45:23] love on that cross
[45:26] I love him
[45:29] too
[45:31] much to
[45:34] fail him
[45:37] now
[45:40] too
[45:42] much to
[45:45] Break My
[45:48] Vow for I
[45:51] promise the Lord that I'll make
[45:57] it
[45:58] somehow and now I love him to much to
[46:07] fail him
[46:10] [Music]
[46:12] now amen thank you brother
[46:18] Jonathan that's what it comes down
[46:21] to we love him too
[46:24] much to fail him
[46:27] now because we remember that he loved
[46:32] us before we loved
[46:35] him and when we were yet unlovable he
[46:38] loved
[46:41] us so that's why we now love him too
[46:46] much because he's done so much for
[46:51] us that's what a born again experience
[46:54] does
[46:58] it it it it causes you to be able to
[47:01] feel the love of
[47:05] God and and and and an appreciation for
[47:09] that
[47:11] love what he did for us on the cross of
[47:15] Calvary that's a
[47:17] revelation I wasn't there when it
[47:21] happened but since I've been born
[47:24] again I was there with when it
[47:27] happened yes so we're we're thankful for
[47:32] that but through a born again
[47:36] experience we can go back to where it
[47:40] happened and somehow we remember
[47:44] [Music]
[47:45] it by
[47:48] Revelation we'd like to speak
[47:52] tonight on tithing and offering
[48:01] tithing can we have some quotes that
[48:03] begin around
[48:07] 1955 to
[48:11] 1965 there are many different
[48:14] ones more than what we have even here
[48:17] tonight or we'll be able to
[48:20] read and uh we we will
[48:24] continue uh um we will continue on on
[48:28] Sunday on on
[48:30] this on this on this
[48:36] subject and and God help us to deliver
[48:40] it from the word of
[48:46] God I I think overall the the teaching
[48:49] and
[48:54] tithing
[48:57] uh it has
[48:59] been
[49:02] simplified and it is
[49:04] simple as as as is all the teachings of
[49:07] the
[49:09] Bible if you can go in and see the
[49:12] pattern of God's
[49:15] word if you if you can understand by
[49:18] Revelation that you must add word upon
[49:20] word and line upon
[49:24] line
[49:26] then then once we get that mind of
[49:28] Christ in our
[49:32] hearts then we approach all of God's
[49:34] truths on on that
[49:39] basis that it's not just one quote in
[49:42] the
[49:43] Bible and it's just not one quote of
[49:46] what William brandham
[49:49] said it must be word upon
[49:52] word and line upon line to to build a
[50:00] teaching upon one
[50:04] quote whether it's the
[50:06] Bible or whether it's William
[50:09] brandom or whether it's Billy Graham or
[50:11] any other
[50:13] minister is an
[50:16] error it's it's a
[50:18] mistake because the word is line upon
[50:22] line word upon word here a little and
[50:26] there a little the Bible
[50:28] says and every Revelation that we
[50:33] have uh we must put a comma at the end
[50:36] of
[50:38] it and say this is what I
[50:42] believe and if there's
[50:44] more may God continue to Open the Eyes
[50:47] of our
[50:51] understanding so we had uh several uh
[50:55] quotes today
[50:59] tonight and uh I was hoping to get it
[51:02] sent actually to brother uh Leo
[51:14] here send it to brother
[51:17] Leo but but
[51:21] uh in order to do
[51:24] that I was going to be needing to use my
[51:28] telephone to link my two iPads
[51:33] together uh to give one to brother
[51:36] Leo so it would have been easy to
[51:40] do if I would have remembered not to
[51:43] leave leave my phone at
[51:47] home so uh I told Leo I'd have it ready
[51:51] for him for service and and everything
[51:53] was ready to
[51:54] go
[52:00] and then he come to the front and I
[52:02] started looking for my
[52:07] telephone and uh that was the missing
[52:09] link right
[52:11] there so we'll we'll we'll do our best
[52:13] to share the one iPad and he for the
[52:20] Spanish and may God add the blessing to
[52:23] his word
[52:24] tonight
[52:25] turn turn with me to Hebrews chapter 7
[52:28] for scripture
[52:37] reading the Apostle
[52:40] Paul uh writing this book of
[52:45] Hebrews and even that is
[52:48] controversial amongst Church
[52:52] historians as to who wrote This Book of
[52:54] Hebrews
[52:59] as to who wrote as to who wrote
[53:02] it Paul wrote the
[53:05] book is what many historians
[53:09] believe and once again many historians
[53:13] of of uh that are are that that also
[53:15] believe that it was not
[53:19] Paul like everything in the
[53:22] Bible there are those that say yes I
[53:24] believe it this
[53:27] way and no I don't see it that
[53:31] way and can that's to be
[53:35] expected be because we're human
[53:38] beings but but overall Jesus
[53:43] said when he was asking the disciples
[53:46] who do men say that I
[53:51] am and they said well well some men say
[53:55] you're
[53:58] Jeremiah some some men think you're
[54:03] Elijah uh some think you're one of the
[54:05] prophets that's come back from the dead
[54:06] or
[54:09] something so it was easy for them to
[54:14] answer while while he was asking
[54:17] them it wasn't a personal question it
[54:20] was not a personal
[54:22] question it was who do men say that I
[54:26] am so everyone was ready to say what
[54:29] they heard men
[54:32] say but when he went to
[54:35] Peter and he said but who do you say
[54:37] that I
[54:40] am and Peter said Thou Art the
[54:45] Christ that's that's that's saying
[54:47] you're
[54:49] Messiah that's saying you're God in
[54:54] flesh because that's what that
[54:56] represented to the Jewish
[55:00] people he says Thou Art the Christ the
[55:03] son of the Living
[55:05] God and Jesus
[55:07] said Flesh and Blood hath not revealed
[55:10] this to
[55:13] you this isn't the opinion of the high
[55:16] priest or any of the
[55:19] Levites he says but my Father which is
[55:21] in
[55:23] heaven has given you this
[55:26] Revelation and Upon This Rock I'm going
[55:30] to build my
[55:31] church where where you need a personal
[55:35] experience with the
[55:39] father where where where you need a
[55:41] friendship restored with the
[55:50] father he says outside of because
[55:52] because it's on that basis
[55:55] that I'll build my
[55:57] church my family you've got to become
[56:01] part of the
[56:02] family through a born again

[56:23] you and take you baby steps at a
[56:29] time into
[56:31] Perfection to be
[56:33] perfect as the father in Heaven is
[56:37] perfect that's being
[56:40] Eternal Hebrews chapter 7 and verse
[56:45] one for this mzc king of Salem priest of
[56:49] the most high
[56:53] God
[56:56] who met Abraham returning from the
[56:58] slaughter of the Kings and blessed
[57:06] him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
[57:10] part of
[57:13] all first being by interpretation king
[57:16] of
[57:20] righteousness and after that also king
[57:22] of
[57:23] Salem
[57:25] which is king of
[57:27] Peace So
[57:29] Abraham he gave a 10th
[57:32] part to
[57:35] MDC king of
[57:38] righteousness king of
[57:40] Salem king of
[57:42] Peace King King King three
[57:47] times without
[57:50] father without
[57:53] mother like Jesus
[57:56] could have been Jesus could have been
[57:58] the same
[57:59] God without
[58:02] descent having neither beginning of days
[58:05] nor end of
[58:08] life but made like unto the Son of
[58:12] God in other words he's telling us MDC
[58:16] was like unto the Son of
[58:21] God how was he the
[58:23] same could if you would have been able
[58:25] to take mdc's picture for 3,000 years
[58:32] ago and then a picture of Jesus when he
[58:35] was on
[58:38] Earth we might have
[58:41] found that God
[58:44] used a body that looked
[58:49] identical
[58:51] simply because he's the same yesterday
[58:54] to today and
[58:57] forever I don't believe Jesus of
[59:01] Nazareth that the way he
[59:04] looked was the first time God ever used
[59:06] that
[59:16] look I believe he's a god of pattern and
[59:23] Order and he's the same yesterday today
[59:26] and
[59:27] forever let's pray Heavenly Father we
[59:31] thank you once again ask your blessings
[59:33] on your
[59:35] word and on your
[59:38] children in Jesus name amen you may be
[59:44] seated Tidings and
[59:53] offerings
[59:55] in the message enticing
[1:00:00] Spirits brother Bram says
[1:00:03] this this is
[1:00:07] 1955 and he and he says this today
[1:00:11] they're trying to take the place of
[1:00:13] God's tithing they're trying to adopt
[1:00:15] something else they're trying to make it
[1:00:18] different they go down and have Bunko
[1:00:20] games in the churches play Lottery
[1:00:23] lottery will never take the place of
[1:00:25] God's
[1:00:51] tithing he says the lottery will never
[1:00:54] take the place place of God's tithing
[1:00:55] suppers blankets selling picnics to
[1:00:58] raise money to different depths to for
[1:01:01] different depths off it'll never take
[1:01:03] the place of God's Eternal tithe and
[1:01:05] offering it'll never do it but yet we're
[1:01:07] trying to do it
[1:01:23] am
[1:01:28] I was told by a
[1:01:31] gentleman I was
[1:01:35] told he said what you ought to
[1:01:39] do since you have this big parking lot
[1:01:44] outside you you ought to have car
[1:01:49] washes and have all the church people
[1:01:51] come and wash
[1:01:53] cars
[1:01:57] and and that'll help pay for all the
[1:01:59] church
[1:02:03] expenses I told them thank you but we're
[1:02:06] not going to do that because God has a
[1:02:09] better
[1:02:10] way God has an
[1:02:14] order brother says what is it it's
[1:02:17] enticing Spirits coming down trying to
[1:02:20] substitute something for the word of God
[1:02:23] God has no sub substitute for his word
[1:02:25] it's Eternal and
[1:02:48] forever God has nothing to substitute
[1:02:50] faith faith has no
[1:02:53] substitute and and as we know the word
[1:02:55] says without faith it's impossible to
[1:02:58] please
[1:03:03] God
[1:03:22] God and without without
[1:03:30] faith it's impossible to please God to
[1:03:34] please
[1:03:39] God he said hope is the substance of
[1:03:43] things hope for the evidence of things
[1:03:46] not seen or faith is rather see hope is
[1:03:49] one thing faith is another hope hopes
[1:03:52] for it faith has got it one is
[1:03:54] intellectual Faith the other is direct
[1:03:56] revelation of God it'll never take its
[1:03:58] place we're trying but we're making all
[1:04:02] these
[1:04:23] substitutes
[1:04:35] so Prophet here was telling
[1:04:37] us that God has a way God has an
[1:04:42] order but the churches over the last 100
[1:04:47] years and even more than
[1:04:50] that the Catholic
[1:04:52] Church they've made
[1:04:56] substitutes instead of taking God at his
[1:05:00] word they' brought in
[1:05:09] substitutes in the message the second
[1:05:14] coming says this and now and then in
[1:05:20] finally we are not here to he says and
[1:05:23] now he says
[1:05:24] find we are finding we're not here to
[1:05:26] take up finances I says I wish we didn't
[1:05:29] even have to ask for one offering in the
[1:05:30] meeting but just he says in the meeting
[1:05:34] he said I never took an offering in my
[1:05:36] life never in my life did I ever take
[1:05:39] any offering uh and in my church when I
[1:05:41] was Pastor there Baptist Minister for 12
[1:05:44] years I never received one penny salary
[1:05:48] but I always thought the Lord had made
[1:05:50] me healthy and I could work so why not
[1:05:53] work and and Pastor now that's not an
[1:05:56] example for other pastors because
[1:05:58] learning later that a minister of the
[1:06:00] Gospel can't go out to
[1:06:03] work and and slave and then come in and
[1:06:06] do his church Justice he's got to visit
[1:06:10] among his members and so forth and the
[1:06:13] little Tidings and things from the
[1:06:14] members and offerings would certainly
[1:06:15] help take care of him and I think the
[1:06:18] labor is worthy of his hire but in my
[1:06:20] case I was working in conver
[1:06:22] conservation things that I like out in
[1:06:24] the woods and I like work so I
[1:06:53] work
[1:07:05] now brother brandom's here is
[1:07:11] relating what what he
[1:07:13] did and and why he did
[1:07:16] it he makes a statement
[1:07:19] here and and and he
[1:07:22] says
[1:07:28] he says he says
[1:07:30] now he says he says I never took an
[1:07:32] offering in my
[1:07:36] life that's because he didn't want
[1:07:39] to that's because he had a
[1:07:42] complex of asking people for
[1:07:46] money that's CU he felt I can I I'll
[1:07:48] work and make my own money and no one
[1:07:50] will will help help me make my way
[1:07:52] through life
[1:07:58] and and so it was a complex in his
[1:08:01] life he said I never took an offering in
[1:08:04] my
[1:08:05] life he said uh he said and in my church
[1:08:09] when I was Pastor
[1:08:12] there a Baptist Minister for 12
[1:08:16] years and now he's calling himself a
[1:08:19] Baptist Minister for 12
[1:08:22] years and he's pastoring brandom
[1:08:29] Tabernacle you you see how if we take
[1:08:31] things so literally and carnally all the
[1:08:34] different things that can be
[1:08:41] twisted what we're
[1:08:43] seeing is a man
[1:08:45] growing into his
[1:08:48] ministry and it was a difficult one for
[1:08:52] sure and and so does every Minister and
[1:08:55] every believer in Christ we're all
[1:08:56] growing unto the stature of a perfect
[1:09:05] man and just like every Christian man
[1:09:08] the head of his
[1:09:13] home it's it's easy for me to look
[1:09:17] back and say if I had a chance to do it
[1:09:22] again
[1:09:25] I would have been a different kind of a
[1:09:28] dad I can look
[1:09:31] back and say there's certain things that
[1:09:34] that I did out of
[1:09:39] anger it it wasn't
[1:09:42] right but I had began a
[1:09:45] journey with no
[1:09:47] experience if I could go go back
[1:09:50] again oh there's many things I would do
[1:09:52] different
[1:09:55] and the way I treated and spoke to my
[1:09:57] wife
[1:10:01] Karen but that's looking
[1:10:04] back so we were
[1:10:06] growing and William brandham was a man
[1:10:10] growing into his ministry as we're men
[1:10:14] growing into our
[1:10:18] ministry we hope that we can that we can
[1:10:21] pass
[1:10:22] on
[1:10:25] the things we've
[1:10:27] learned by the mistakes that we have
[1:10:31] made so I have I have many things I
[1:10:34] could share with
[1:10:37] you uh I'd like to call it
[1:10:41] wisdom but it came because of the
[1:10:44] mistakes that I
[1:10:48] made so here brother bam says I never
[1:10:51] took up an offering in my life
[1:10:56] I said when I he says in my church when
[1:10:58] I was a pastor
[1:11:00] there he a Baptist Minister for 12
[1:11:04] years I never received one penny of
[1:11:09] salary but I always thought that the
[1:11:11] Lord had made me healthy and I could
[1:11:15] work he's walking us through his
[1:11:21] reasoning he said so why not work at
[1:11:26] Pastor now that's not an example for
[1:11:29] other
[1:11:31] pastors because learning
[1:11:35] later that a minister of the
[1:11:38] Gospel can't go out and work and
[1:11:44] slave that you know that that's also
[1:11:46] human
[1:11:50] reasoning uh because if he has to
[1:11:55] he he he just has to go out and work and
[1:12:00] slave you know the the old Minister the
[1:12:04] Ministers of the Pentecostal
[1:12:06] movement the ministers
[1:12:10] Min or
[1:12:13] Min uh would have been men like my
[1:12:16] father and and my grandfather's
[1:12:20] age of all those men that I knew growing
[1:12:23] up
[1:12:27] evangelists they take the
[1:12:30] gospel through the West California
[1:12:32] Arizona to
[1:12:36] Mexico all of them
[1:12:38] worked labored
[1:12:40] hard I don't know of any of them they
[1:12:42] were educated they were all
[1:12:48] uneducated they were all bluecollar
[1:12:52] workers they were they were all laborers
[1:12:55] worked with their
[1:12:57] hands they would save every penny they
[1:13:01] could that they didn't need to feed
[1:13:03] their
[1:13:06] families then they would get up and go
[1:13:09] for weeks sometimes months to take the
[1:13:14] gospel they'd come back broke with no
[1:13:18] money and go back to work
[1:13:21] again so it's a it it it it to some
[1:13:24] degree it's a modern
[1:13:30] thought it's it's a it's a modern
[1:13:39] thought that a
[1:13:41] pastor shouldn't or can't
[1:13:46] work that a pastor
[1:13:52] shouldn't
[1:13:54] uh go out and work and slave as brother
[1:13:57] uses the the term
[1:14:02] here he said and and then come in and do
[1:14:06] his church
[1:14:18] Justice there there is a certain line
[1:14:20] there that that is a
[1:14:22] truth
[1:14:25] depending on the size of the
[1:14:26] congregation and the
[1:14:29] church men can be over involved in
[1:14:34] business man can
[1:14:39] be that take too much of their
[1:14:44] time that they're making more money than
[1:14:47] what they need to
[1:14:50] make and they're not putting enough time
[1:14:53] on their
[1:14:56] knees in the studying of the
[1:14:59] word in in the studying of the word
[1:15:04] and to do the church and the people
[1:15:09] justice so there is there is a there is
[1:15:12] a a line
[1:15:14] there that's
[1:15:16] correct but a pastor of a small
[1:15:20] group then then the pastor must be sure
[1:15:24] that there is money to pay the
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:29] expenses uh money to bring in ministries
[1:15:32] that will bless the
[1:15:37] people and that comes that comes way
[1:15:44] before that that before him even
[1:15:47] receiving any kind of a
[1:15:51] salary it's like the father in The the
[1:15:54] home and the mother in a
[1:15:57] home I remember sitting at our table as
[1:16:01] a as a
[1:16:03] boy and mom would feed all of our all of
[1:16:05] us
[1:16:09] kids and I asked her one
[1:16:12] time because we had all eat until we
[1:16:14] were
[1:16:16] full and I said Mom aren't you going to
[1:16:19] eat oh she says I'm not hungry tonight
[1:16:23] well I realized
[1:16:25] later that after she fed us
[1:16:28] all there wasn't anything left for
[1:16:32] Mom and she was good with that she made
[1:16:36] that
[1:16:38] decision and so is the
[1:16:42] church if in if in fact the pastor sees
[1:16:45] that the family the family's need should
[1:16:47] be met made
[1:16:51] first the needs of the
[1:16:54] family the church
[1:16:56] family must be met
[1:17:00] first above and
[1:17:04] beyond a a pastor receiving
[1:17:09] tithing now these are very personal
[1:17:12] statements so these
[1:17:16] are for this congregation because we're
[1:17:20] not a
[1:17:21] denomination but yet this is what I
[1:17:23] believe is a is a
[1:17:30] truth in the message the faith of
[1:17:37] Abraham sometime
[1:17:41] ago sometime ago I was going to give a l
[1:17:45] i was I was going they were going to
[1:17:48] give me a large
[1:17:52] offering
[1:17:53] he he said it was a
[1:17:58] tithing he said it was a tithing he said
[1:18:01] it was a
[1:18:04] tithing he said but it was too much for
[1:18:07] me and I told him I wouldn't receive an
[1:18:10] offering like
[1:18:13] that so brother brother brother brandom
[1:18:16] first said talks about it being a
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:21] tithing
[1:18:23] brother bam first said he says it said
[1:18:26] it was a
[1:18:29] tithing because he's because he's
[1:18:31] telling us the end of the story when he
[1:18:33] starts he already knows the end of the
[1:18:37] story so you he so you almost need a
[1:18:41] revelation just to listen to him
[1:18:45] speak so he's telling us at the
[1:18:48] beginning the end of the story because
[1:18:50] he knows the
[1:18:51] end
[1:18:55] and then he goes into the
[1:18:57] beginning so he says some time ago I I
[1:19:01] was they were going to give me a large
[1:19:09] offering he said it was a
[1:19:12] tithing the person giving it to
[1:19:15] him so that's the end of the story he's
[1:19:18] telling
[1:19:19] us now he's going to start to the
[1:19:21] beginning of it
[1:19:24] he said but it was too much for
[1:19:26] me but it was too much for
[1:19:29] me and I told them I wouldn't receive an
[1:19:32] offering like
[1:19:35] that so now he's telling us starting the
[1:19:38] story from from the
[1:19:42] beginning and he believing this brother
[1:19:44] was giving him an
[1:19:47] offering he said I I told him I wouldn't
[1:19:49] receive an offering like
[1:19:51] that
[1:19:54] he said but brother brandom I must give
[1:19:56] it to
[1:19:58] you he said then he said it's
[1:20:03] tithing I said well now if it's tithing
[1:20:06] it goes to God's
[1:20:12] Church no no no doesn't it goes all the
[1:20:15] tithing belong to the
[1:20:21] pastor the here is
[1:20:25] 1959 and he said I said well now if it's
[1:20:30] tithing it goes to God's
[1:20:33] Church you see in the Old
[1:20:36] Testament and we'll be reading more as
[1:20:38] we study this this
[1:20:41] message in this
[1:20:44] subject the the children of Israel would
[1:20:46] bring their Tidings and offerings to
[1:20:48] God's
[1:20:51] house he said the tidings the priest
[1:20:54] would take
[1:20:57] it the levit to make the the proper
[1:21:04] sacrifices and under the law in the Old
[1:21:08] Testament the levit received the
[1:21:16] 10th the 10th
[1:21:18] part of all the tidings that had come to
[1:21:21] the Lord
[1:21:24] not all the tithings that the people had
[1:21:29] brought because the tithings belong to
[1:21:33] God the offerings that the people bring
[1:21:36] belong to
[1:21:40] God so God says the
[1:21:44] Levites they can have a tenth of all the
[1:21:47] tidings that come
[1:21:51] in now the old Old
[1:21:53] Testament is a shadow of things to
[1:21:58] come so we must add more to this to
[1:22:01] really understand where we're at
[1:22:04] today but one thing for sure in the Old
[1:22:08] Testament type and
[1:22:11] Shadow of all the tithings and offerings
[1:22:14] that people would
[1:22:18] bring that all those Tidings were not
[1:22:21] 100% belonging to the Levites and the
[1:22:28] priests a
[1:22:30] tenth of all that was brought
[1:22:33] in was for the
[1:22:36] Levites to have to live
[1:22:44] by in the message the faith of
[1:22:51] Abraham
[1:22:54] let's keep no let's keep reading the the
[1:22:56] faith of ab say I said well now if it's
[1:22:58] tithing it goes to God's
[1:23:04] church so now we have two
[1:23:07] statements one where a prophet
[1:23:11] said the tithing belongs to the
[1:23:16] pastor and one where he says the
[1:23:21] tithing if if it's Tidings CS it goes to
[1:23:25] God's
[1:23:26] church so now we got two
[1:23:29] statements to find a
[1:23:32] balance to find the
[1:23:35] truth he said that's
[1:23:38] right I said well if the Lord is giving
[1:23:40] you those
[1:23:44] ties brother said I
[1:23:47] said well if the Lord is giving you
[1:23:50] those
[1:23:51] tithes
[1:23:53] he's got people somewhere to give it
[1:23:58] to now he's telling
[1:24:01] us one of the
[1:24:04] things that those Tidings can be used
[1:24:10] for he says he said if the Lord is
[1:24:12] giving you those
[1:24:15] ties he's got people somewhere to give
[1:24:18] it
[1:24:20] to they're all out on the field
[1:24:28] everywhere and when I when I know of
[1:24:30] missionaries preaching on the field with
[1:24:32] no shoes
[1:24:36] on in um may make two meals a
[1:24:42] week I can do without something
[1:24:48] myself I can do without you you
[1:24:57] and I think we all could do
[1:25:01] that to help those poor
[1:25:04] Brethren who are struggling for the
[1:25:06] cause of
[1:25:08] Christ so here the prophet tells
[1:25:11] us the
[1:25:13] tithing it goes to God's
[1:25:16] church not a building so much but a
[1:25:19] people a mystical body no no no
[1:25:27] and so the prophet lays
[1:25:34] down uh something that these Tidings can
[1:25:37] also be used
[1:25:40] for and and and how a pastor that has
[1:25:44] this these Tidings
[1:25:49] available that it was his opinion he
[1:25:51] should be helping missionaries who are
[1:25:53] preaching the
[1:25:58] gospel men who men who are struggling
[1:26:00] for the cause of
[1:26:04] Christ in the message the faith of
[1:26:08] Abraham also
[1:26:11] 1959 he says I believe it was some great
[1:26:16] man maybe TL
[1:26:21] Osborne
[1:26:22] or
[1:26:23] somebody that said one time that no one
[1:26:26] has the right to hear the gospel
[1:26:33] twice while one hasn't heard it even
[1:26:41] once and that's right he said but you
[1:26:44] see the American people has got the
[1:26:49] money and others
[1:26:51] don't I'm a poor
[1:26:55] man I haven't got no
[1:26:57] money and I go
[1:27:00] along uh I've never took I've never took
[1:27:03] an offering in my
[1:27:06] life now
[1:27:08] remember we're going to make put this
[1:27:12] statement you can go on tape and here
[1:27:15] brother
[1:27:17] brandom from time to time he is
[1:27:20] speaking and he says I think it's about
[1:27:23] time to take up the
[1:27:27] offering and he says and then he kind of
[1:27:29] laughs a little
[1:27:31] bit and he says um brother Neville would
[1:27:34] you come up and do that
[1:27:38] please so you keep that in your mind
[1:27:40] when he says I've never took up an
[1:27:45] offering he would call others to do
[1:27:49] it and most of the time he was coming up
[1:27:52] to preach the word the offering already
[1:27:53] been picked
[1:27:58] up it wasn't that that brother brother
[1:28:01] brandom Tabernacle did not pick up
[1:28:07] offerings it was it it wasn't that
[1:28:09] brandham
[1:28:13] Tabernacle that they that they didn't
[1:28:15] pick up
[1:28:16] offerings just brother Brandon was made
[1:28:19] sure that it was never him asking for
[1:28:21] the offering
[1:28:26] he said I'm a poor man I haven't got no
[1:28:29] no he says Capital but he meant
[1:28:33] money and I've never took an offering in
[1:28:36] my
[1:28:38] life never
[1:28:40] did just what people freely send
[1:28:46] me so he received
[1:28:48] offerings he just he was just always
[1:28:51] sure to do not ask for
[1:28:55] one he says then I take that and hold
[1:28:58] and and put it
[1:29:01] together he says and then as soon as I
[1:29:03] get enough built up or
[1:29:11] saved he said I would take right off to
[1:29:13] the heathens and preach the
[1:29:20] gospel he says so I'll have to answer
[1:29:23] for your
[1:29:26] tithing and the people that give it to
[1:29:30] me on
[1:29:33] tithing in the message here ye him
[1:29:39] 1959 he says tonight I sure appreciate
[1:29:42] your fine love offering which will be
[1:29:44] given to me after the
[1:29:50] service did did he receive
[1:29:53] offerings
[1:29:55] many throughout his ministry could we
[1:29:57] say he received millions of
[1:30:03] dollars yes it's a
[1:30:05] truth because when the
[1:30:08] government when the IRS uh came after
[1:30:16] him for for back taxes
[1:30:20] owed they said they were charging him
[1:30:24] $300,000 in taxes and
[1:30:30] penalties that was in the
[1:30:34] 1960s so it it was millions that they
[1:30:36] were charging him
[1:30:40] for he had never hid the
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:44] money he never hid the
[1:30:47] money he never did anything
[1:30:50] illegal he never did anything
[1:30:57] unethical but he did make a a
[1:31:00] mistake concerning the laws of the
[1:31:05] land and what he should have done when
[1:31:08] he received checks from
[1:31:12] people he should have never signed the
[1:31:15] back of those
[1:31:18] checks he should have simply deposited
[1:31:20] him as he did
[1:31:24] into the brandom Tabernacle organization
[1:31:27] the fund for missionary
[1:31:36] work without ever signing the back of
[1:31:38] the
[1:31:41] checks because when he signed the
[1:31:44] back and deposited the
[1:31:47] money the government the US government
[1:31:50] came after him
[1:31:53] they said the law is
[1:31:57] specific when you sign the back of the
[1:32:00] check that makes it your personal
[1:32:07] income he says and when you did
[1:32:11] that you then you deposited in into your
[1:32:15] missionary
[1:32:18] fund but when you sign the back
[1:32:22] it became your personal
[1:32:26] income he says and now you owe us taxes
[1:32:29] on
[1:32:31] that had he never signed the back of
[1:32:34] those
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:36] checks and just simply deposited them
[1:32:39] into the missionary
[1:32:43] fund the government could have never
[1:32:45] done anything to
[1:32:48] him so did he do something illegal
[1:32:54] yes but that doesn't make the law
[1:32:59] just did he do something unethical or
[1:33:05] wrong no he did nothing
[1:33:09] wrong but the way the government the
[1:33:12] laws are
[1:33:15] written when he signed that check it
[1:33:19] made it his personal income
[1:33:28] so you see but William Brandon wasn't
[1:33:30] the only one during that time that the
[1:33:32] government was
[1:33:37] chasing if you look into
[1:33:40] history it was a period of
[1:33:43] time it was a period of
[1:33:49] time when they were going after many EV
[1:33:53] traveling evangelists in that
[1:34:00] day that were praying for the sick and
[1:34:03] having campaigns of Divine
[1:34:07] Healing they weren't just chasing down
[1:34:09] William
[1:34:12] brandham the the government was going
[1:34:14] after all of these
[1:34:17] men at this
[1:34:19] time it wasn't just
[1:34:25] him brother manam says in the message
[1:34:27] hear ye
[1:34:30] him and tonight and
[1:34:34] tonight I sure appreciate your fine love
[1:34:40] offering which will be given me after
[1:34:43] the
[1:34:45] service I will promise
[1:34:48] you there won't be any cigarettes or
[1:34:50] whiskey anything anything
[1:34:55] wrong I'll go for preaching the gospel
[1:34:58] in
[1:35:01] Australia and wherever the Lord will
[1:35:03] send
[1:35:05] me and and when a soldier is born in the
[1:35:08] Kingdom
[1:35:12] there it'll be to your credit on that
[1:35:18] day I'm only following a leading of the
[1:35:21] spirit
[1:35:24] I must do that and you're sending
[1:35:27] me your money your
[1:35:31] tithing is sending
[1:35:33] me how he used the
[1:35:37] tithing to go himself to preach the
[1:35:42] gospel and to help others to go preach
[1:35:45] the
[1:35:47] gospel so the full sum of tithing coming
[1:35:50] in
[1:35:56] from the Old
[1:35:58] Testament we're told that the full sum
[1:36:01] didn't belong to the
[1:36:06] Levites but a tenth of the full
[1:36:11] sum was given to
[1:36:13] them that was the
[1:36:15] shadow that was the Old
[1:36:18] Testament we know many changes came when
[1:36:21] the New Testament came into
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:27] place so but under the
[1:36:32] old all the tithings and offerings that
[1:36:34] came
[1:36:38] in they belong to
[1:36:40] God the believer brought them to
[1:36:45] God then God told the
[1:36:48] Levites of all the offerings that bring
[1:36:51] come to
[1:36:52] me the tithes
[1:36:55] also I'll give you a
[1:36:58] tenth and as you
[1:37:01] know the Levites had no inheritance of
[1:37:06] land
[1:37:07] none God wanted them to be totally
[1:37:10] unburdened of those
[1:37:17] things so that they could fully give
[1:37:20] themselves
[1:37:22] in the offering of the offerings for
[1:37:25] Israel for the sins of the
[1:37:33] people in the message what is the Holy
[1:37:37] Ghost brother Bram said this when God
[1:37:41] was setting things in
[1:37:45] order he said all you
[1:37:49] Levites I've called you out and made you
[1:37:55] priests and all your
[1:37:57] brethren the other 11
[1:38:01] tribes will pay you
[1:38:04] tithing he says when you get a a nine
[1:38:08] when you get a nine bushels of apples or
[1:38:11] 10 bushels of
[1:38:17] apples uh give one bushel to the Levites
[1:38:23] when you run your sheep
[1:38:26] through when when you when you bring
[1:38:28] your sheep into out of the
[1:38:33] pastures uh he he he he says pick up the
[1:38:37] 10th
[1:38:40] sheep pick up the 10th
[1:38:46] sheep pick up the 10th
[1:38:50] sheep
[1:38:53] he says and I don't care if it's a
[1:38:55] little one or a big
[1:38:57] one a fat one or a poor
[1:39:01] one that belongs to the
[1:39:06] Levites now as time went
[1:39:11] on the Levites began to choose the
[1:39:16] biggest the
[1:39:20] best
[1:39:21] back in the Old
[1:39:23] Testament he says now
[1:39:27] Levites when you get all of
[1:39:31] this then you tithe
[1:39:34] also to the
[1:39:39] Lord so now it we realize it's the Old
[1:39:44] Testament we're not putting a period on
[1:39:49] anything but we want want to walk
[1:39:51] through the
[1:39:54] shadow to come to the reality of
[1:39:58] today he said now you Levites when you
[1:40:00] get all
[1:40:02] this your your 10th
[1:40:06] part of all that the other 11 tribes
[1:40:09] give
[1:40:12] you they've got 10
[1:40:15] sheep they pick one and they give it to
[1:40:17] you the 10th
[1:40:19] one
[1:40:22] so they line up the sheep and they start
[1:40:23] walking them
[1:40:28] through they count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine
[1:40:34] 10 the 10th one that's the
[1:40:38] Levites even if it was the
[1:40:41] smallest or if it was the biggest when
[1:40:44] they counted to 10 that was the
[1:40:48] one then the prophet says in this
[1:40:52] message 1959 what is the Holy
[1:40:56] Ghost now
[1:40:59] Levites when you get that 10th
[1:41:03] part then you tithe also to the
[1:41:08] Lord you make the wave
[1:41:14] offering the heave
[1:41:18] offerings the the different offerings
[1:41:22] you tithe to the
[1:41:25] Lord so under the Old
[1:41:30] Testament everyone
[1:41:33] tithed and everyone was tithing to the
[1:41:35] same
[1:41:38] person to the
[1:41:42] Lord the tithing and offerings have
[1:41:44] always been to the
[1:41:48] Lord so that if you're ever in a in an
[1:41:51] assembly a
[1:41:55] church and in your heart you've always
[1:41:58] brought your Tidings to the
[1:42:01] Lord if in your
[1:42:07] heart then even if that Pastor becomes
[1:42:10] an unjust
[1:42:18] Steward he says you never gave your
[1:42:21] tithes to the
[1:42:23] man if you give your tithing and
[1:42:26] offerings to
[1:42:29] God and you you'll never have to regret
[1:42:31] having paid your offerings and tithings
[1:42:33] to
[1:42:38] God because God will deal with that
[1:42:41] unjust
[1:42:45] servant that's God's
[1:42:47] business if he takes it all in
[1:42:51] and he never gives his offering and
[1:42:53] tithings unto the
[1:42:58] Lord you will still be blessed because
[1:43:01] from your heart you did the right
[1:43:07] thing for the right
[1:43:10] Reason by
[1:43:12] Revelation you brought your Tidings and
[1:43:16] offerings to the house of God you gave
[1:43:20] it to the the
[1:43:21] Lord now the stewards in that
[1:43:26] house the
[1:43:28] ministry is
[1:43:30] responsible to continue to do
[1:43:34] something in for the kingdom of
[1:43:40] God when God was setting in
[1:43:44] order he said all you
[1:43:48] Levites I've called you out and made you
[1:43:50] preach
[1:43:53] and all your
[1:43:54] brethren the other 11 tribes will pay
[1:43:57] you a
[1:44:00] tithing so when you have 10 bushels of
[1:44:05] apples one bushel will be to the
[1:44:08] Levites when you run your sheep and you
[1:44:10] have 10 of
[1:44:17] themas and you have 10 yes you give one
[1:44:20] to the
[1:44:21] Levites then he says now the
[1:44:25] Levites when you get this
[1:44:28] T then you tithe too to the
[1:44:32] Lord you make the wave
[1:44:39] offering the different
[1:44:42] offerings is how you tithe to the
[1:44:46] Lord the Levites the
[1:44:49] priests they should continually be
[1:44:51] working for the kingdom of
[1:44:59] God Lord willing will continue on
[1:45:05] Sunday Tidings and
[1:45:08] offerings we've just barely scratched
[1:45:11] the top of it
[1:45:13] tonight but we're already realizing a
[1:45:16] few
[1:45:19] things of the
[1:45:22] shadow that the tithings and
[1:45:26] offerings the people brought them unto
[1:45:28] the
[1:45:30] Lord they didn't bring them to the
[1:45:34] Levites and when they brought
[1:45:36] it the Levites were to take the tithings
[1:45:39] and
[1:45:42] offerings and make the different
[1:45:44] offerings before the
[1:45:48] Lord and sacrifices
[1:45:53] and
[1:45:55] theirs was
[1:46:00] one10 for them to make and to
[1:46:03] live but from the on10th that they
[1:46:08] received they too were to offer their
[1:46:11] tithing unto the
[1:46:13] Lord so here is a principle number
[1:46:19] one
[1:46:22] tithings and
[1:46:24] offerings whether it's a lay member or a
[1:46:29] minister we're to all bring
[1:46:32] it unto the house of
[1:46:35] God and lift it
[1:46:37] up before the
[1:46:39] Lord and see
[1:46:42] how we can use
[1:46:45] it to prosper the kingdom of
[1:46:48] God first the family of of
[1:46:52] God is to be used
[1:46:56] also the
[1:46:58] tidings to bring in just stewards of a
[1:47:01] of a fightful
[1:47:06] Ministry to be a
[1:47:09] blessing to God's
[1:47:12] people so one principle we we we come at
[1:47:18] tonight when you give your tithings and
[1:47:23] offerings never give it to a
[1:47:25] man only the man Christ
[1:47:30] Jesus the blessing
[1:47:33] in then is upon your
[1:47:38] life God said
[1:47:41] give and I will bless
[1:47:44] you I will out bless
[1:47:47] you I will out give you
[1:47:51] in so many
[1:47:53] ways and you will never
[1:47:56] regret having paid
[1:48:01] tithes you will never regret paying
[1:48:05] tithes if you always gave them to
[1:48:09] him to the
[1:48:14] Lord as we stand to our feet
[1:48:19] tonight
[1:48:31] Hebrews 71 once
[1:48:34] again for this mzed king of Salem priest
[1:48:38] of the most high God who met Abraham
[1:48:41] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:48:42] Kings and blessed
[1:48:49] him
[1:48:53] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[1:48:56] of all first being by interpretation
[1:48:58] king of righteousness after that also
[1:49:01] king of Salem which is king of
[1:49:13] peace without father without mother
[1:49:16] without descent have having neither
[1:49:18] beginning of days nor end of life but
[1:49:20] made like unto the Son of God abideth a
[1:49:23] priest
[1:49:35] continually now consider how great this
[1:49:37] man was unto whom even the patriarch
[1:49:40] Abraham gave the tenth of the
[1:49:42] spoils
[1:49:49] consider this is still the same great
[1:49:54] man to whom we ought to be giving our
[1:49:57] tithes and offerings
[1:50:01] too not just tithing physical
[1:50:06] money but our
[1:50:10] time but our time should be tithed unto
[1:50:12] the
[1:50:15] Lord he says and verily they verse five
[1:50:18] and verily they that are the sons of of
[1:50:20] Levi who receed the office of the
[1:50:22] priesthood have a commandment to take
[1:50:25] tithes of the people according to the
[1:50:27] law that is of their Brethren though
[1:50:31] they come out of the loins of
[1:50:48] Abraham but he who descend sent is not
[1:50:50] counted from them received tithes of
[1:50:54] Abraham and blessed him that had the
[1:51:05] promises and without all contradiction
[1:51:08] the less is blessed of the
[1:51:16] better when we pay our tithes and
[1:51:18] offering unto the Lord
[1:51:23] we are the
[1:51:25] less
[1:51:27] men but be but be
[1:51:30] assured we'll be
[1:51:33] blessed of the
[1:51:35] greater almighty God
[1:51:39] himself so the first
[1:51:45] principle is of all the tidings and
[1:51:48] offerings that came in to the church
[1:51:53] church only a tenth of that was for the
[1:51:56] levite the
[1:52:00] priesthood and the
[1:52:01] Levites must give an offering unto the
[1:52:04] Lord from their 10th
[1:52:09] part so who
[1:52:12] gave uh to
[1:52:14] whom was it told to pay offerings and
[1:52:18] tithing
[1:52:21] to
[1:52:22] all from the
[1:52:25] janitor to the high
[1:52:30] priest from the lay
[1:52:32] members to the
[1:52:35] priesthood let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:52:38] Father we thank
[1:52:39] you as we found this first
[1:52:45] principle in your word help us by the
[1:52:48] grace of God
[1:52:50] to build upon
[1:52:52] it Stone upon
[1:52:54] Stone Revelation upon
[1:52:58] Revelation till we come to the
[1:53:02] truth and it's in the truth where you
[1:53:05] bless
[1:53:06] us it's in the truth where we're set
[1:53:10] free for you said and you shall know the
[1:53:15] truth and the
[1:53:17] truth shall set you free
[1:53:22] amen am God bless you all
[1:53:25] tonight the musician comes and brother
[1:53:30] Jonathan sister Abby could you bring up
[1:53:33] that song the goodness of
[1:53:36] God I think that's what it's
[1:53:39] called as we begin to sing that and turn

[1:53:50] for your mercy never fails
[1:53:54] me all my
[1:53:57] days I've been held in your
