[54:18] desire Lord that you might touch
[54:22] us and change us
[54:26] make us more like
[54:29] you that day by
[54:32] day you'd be changing
[54:35] us that your quickening
[54:40] spirit would quicken in
[54:43] us your Your Word of
[54:46] Life your Plan of
[54:50] Salvation your plan to strengthen
[54:54] us
[54:55] and to give us a
[54:57] victory every day every morning every
[55:03] evening we're looking for a
[55:06] victory through Christ Jesus our lord
[55:09] and savior we stand to our feet this
[55:17] morning it's it's New Year's
[55:23] Eve and uh new a new year will begin in
[55:27] the next TW less than 24
[55:32] hours at least that's what they want us
[55:36] to
[55:39] believe but if if we didn't have days
[55:43] and and months to to to gauge anything
[55:50] by we we might live a little more
[55:54] peaceful
[55:57] but science has given us a clock that is
[56:03] ticking and and because of
[56:06] that sometimes we come to a
[56:10] place where we start believing that our
[56:13] clock began ticking the day we were
[56:20] born and the day we die it t the clock
[56:23] stops
[56:27] but that's just speaking
[56:31] humanly but if but if we what if we
[56:34] desire not to fall into that
[56:41] belief and yet we take God's word
[56:46] instead then we realize that our clock
[56:48] never had a
[56:52] beginning and our clock will never have
[56:54] an end
[56:56] end because in US is a gene of
[57:00] God because we're Sons and Daughters of
[57:03] God because we were in his thoughts
[57:05] before the foundation of the
[57:08] world because we're as Eternal as he is
[57:12] eternal and he's come to take us back to
[57:15] that
[57:17] beginning we can't
[57:20] die we'll only be
[57:23] changed from from this Earthly
[57:27] Tabernacle to a Heavenly Tabernacle that
[57:30] awaits
[57:31] us but we must lay this one down to get
[57:34] the other
[57:38] one and not only will a day come for us
[57:42] to do that and partake of
[57:47] it
[57:49] literally but

[1:00:04] of shave which is the King's
[1:00:18] Dale and MDC king of Salem brought forth
[1:00:23] Bread and Wine
[1:00:25] and he was the priest of the most high
[1:00:33] God it was Christ
[1:00:36] himself it was that Mighty
[1:00:40] Angel he said and he was the priest of
[1:00:43] the most high
[1:00:46] God and he was the verse 18 okay and mzc

[1:02:09] light and thy yoke is
[1:02:14] easy so we thank
[1:02:17] you for this
[1:02:19] yoke of a supernatural marriage
[1:02:23] covenant
[1:02:27] and we thank you Lord Jesus for blessing
[1:02:31] us in Jesus name amen am you may be
[1:02:37] seated three ordinances left to a New
[1:02:40] Testament
[1:02:45] Church communion the Lord's
[1:02:49] Supper foot
[1:02:51] washing and
[1:02:53] baptism by submerging in the name of the
[1:02:57] Lord Jesus
[1:03:00] Christ all of all three of
[1:03:05] these have been perverted in one way or
[1:03:10] another the Lord's
[1:03:12] Supper the partaking of the bread and
[1:03:14] the
[1:03:17] wine the what it represents to the
[1:03:22] believer and yet the churches turned it
[1:03:25] into something
[1:03:30] perverted and by perverting
[1:03:33] it they've made it a mockery to the to
[1:03:36] to the people of
[1:03:40] God in the days of the apostolic church
[1:03:43] when I was a young man a young
[1:03:47] boy there were those Apostolic churches
[1:03:50] that that believed in partaking of the
[1:03:53] bread and the wine
[1:03:58] then within the same denomination there
[1:03:59] were those that believed it was
[1:04:01] spiritual
[1:04:06] only and and those that that partook of
[1:04:09] the of the
[1:04:12] supper they they didn't do it in a
[1:04:15] sacred
[1:04:18] way they they'd go to the back and
[1:04:20] washing the
[1:04:23] feet
[1:04:26] you you you'd see the Brethren some of
[1:04:27] them the younger the younger men
[1:04:29] tickling each other's
[1:04:34] feet it it it be it it became something
[1:04:38] something of wickedness in the
[1:04:44] churches those that tried to partake of
[1:04:47] it and keep it something something
[1:04:53] sacred then they they were mocked of
[1:04:55] those that said it was only
[1:05:01] spiritual and they would call those that
[1:05:03] partook of it they'd call them
[1:05:10] wios and this is something that's
[1:05:12] written in the Bible that we're told to
[1:05:14] partake
[1:05:18] of and yet it's become
[1:05:23] something that is not partaken of very
[1:05:26] often
[1:05:30] anymore I think it's because the
[1:05:32] sacredness of God's word is leaving the
[1:05:40] churches I think it's because Holiness
[1:05:43] is not being practiced and and preached
[1:05:46] in the
[1:05:51] churches the first time Bread and Wine
[1:05:54] was
[1:05:55] served or one of the first
[1:05:58] times was after Abraham
[1:06:03] returned when he returned after a great
[1:06:08] battle he had gone to bring back a
[1:06:13] brother he had gone to bring back the
[1:06:18] families he had gone to bring back all
[1:06:21] their
[1:06:23] possessions
[1:06:24] they had been taken
[1:06:27] captive they had been taken
[1:06:30] slaves they were now the prisoners of
[1:06:33] another
[1:06:35] nation and Abraham rose
[1:06:39] up with those men who had been trained
[1:06:42] in his
[1:06:44] house to go bring back the
[1:06:48] lost to go bring back their
[1:06:51] possessions to set his children free
[1:06:58] again and God gave him the victory to do
[1:07:03] this and when he came back the Bible
[1:07:06] says
[1:07:08] melchisedek king of
[1:07:11] Salem brought forth Bread and
[1:07:14] Wine he prepared a
[1:07:17] supper in honor of what Abraham had
[1:07:22] done to celebrate
[1:07:24] the freedom and the salvation of these
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:31] people it represented
[1:07:34] something this was a special
[1:07:37] supper the wine represented
[1:07:41] something the bread represented
[1:07:45] something what they were
[1:07:48] celebrating was
[1:07:50] Freedom was
[1:07:52] Deliverance
[1:07:55] was
[1:07:57] salvation here in this
[1:08:00] day in St John chapter
[1:08:04] 6 verse
[1:08:07] 53 here Jesus was
[1:08:10] speaking to his
[1:08:17] disciples St John 6
[1:08:20] 53-58 and verse 53 reads like this
[1:08:24] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:08:27] I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh
[1:08:30] of the son of man and drink his blood
[1:08:33] you have no life in
[1:08:42] you we re we realize now that Jesus was
[1:08:46] not speaking
[1:08:50] literally but that he was speaking in a
[1:08:52] parable
[1:08:54] and in this
[1:08:56] Parable his the eating of his flesh
[1:09:00] represented
[1:09:03] something and in this Parable the
[1:09:05] drinking of his blood represented
[1:09:10] something and in this Parable if you
[1:09:12] failed or refused to eat the flesh or
[1:09:15] drink the
[1:09:22] blood he he said you have no life in
[1:09:28] you because he is the only
[1:09:32] life we must receive
[1:09:34] him we must accept
[1:09:37] him who 54 who so eateth my flesh and
[1:09:42] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:09:45] I will raise him up at the last
[1:09:52] day this was
[1:09:55] prophecy this was a
[1:09:57] parable this was things hidden within
[1:09:59] the
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:04] lines for my flesh is meat indeed verse
[1:10:08] 55 and my blood is drink
[1:10:15] indeed then he says he that eateth my
[1:10:17] flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in
[1:10:21] me and I in
[1:10:27] oh he is just
[1:10:30] emphasizing he says he that eateth my
[1:10:33] flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in
[1:10:36] me and I in
[1:10:42] him now he's talking about an invisible
[1:10:45] Union that's going to happen in your
[1:10:47] life when you become a
[1:10:52] partaker
[1:10:56] he says verse 57 as the living father
[1:10:59] has sent me and I live by the
[1:11:08] father so he that eateth me even he
[1:11:12] shall live by
[1:11:17] me he's persisting in this
[1:11:21] Parable he's insisting you
[1:11:24] flesh he's not backing off and
[1:11:26] explaining
[1:11:29] it this is this verse 58 this is that
[1:11:33] bread which came down from heaven not as
[1:11:36] your fathers did eat mana and are dead
[1:11:38] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[1:11:52] forever
[1:11:56] Jesus the Lamb of
[1:11:59] God was now both
[1:12:04] Bread and
[1:12:05] Wine flesh and
[1:12:09] blood under the Old Testament
[1:12:14] type the
[1:12:16] lamb was something that Israel had to
[1:12:22] slay the bread was something that Israel
[1:12:26] had to
[1:12:28] make but the day would
[1:12:33] come when the Lamb of God would be a
[1:12:38] man and the bread of
[1:12:41] God would be a
[1:12:43] man and the blood of
[1:12:45] God would be a
[1:12:48] man St John
[1:12:51] 13 beginning at verse one
[1:12:56] one
[1:12:58] Jesus himself ordaining this ritual of
[1:13:02] foot
[1:13:05] washing
[1:13:07] uh my
[1:13:09] grandfather his name was
[1:13:13] Francisco Francisco a Portuguese
[1:13:16] man his father and mother were from
[1:13:22] Portugal my my
[1:13:24] great-grandparents to
[1:13:27] miss they he he had a he had a journey
[1:13:30] in
[1:13:32] life he came from not being any kind of
[1:13:35] a
[1:13:39] Believer he later he later converted to
[1:13:42] the Baptist
[1:13:47] Church back in the 1930s or
[1:13:51] so by the 19 1940s he had moved on and
[1:13:55] and and and found the Pentecostal
[1:14:02] people when the when the when the
[1:14:04] Pentecostal Church became a
[1:14:09] denomination in 1946
[1:14:13] 1948 he left the Pentecostal
[1:14:17] church he told me they should have never
[1:14:19] done
[1:14:22] that says they left
[1:14:25] God so I left them he
[1:14:28] said this was the late
[1:14:30] 1940s from from that day
[1:14:34] forward everywhere he
[1:14:38] lived in here in
[1:14:40] Poria he he would build a little
[1:14:45] building put a sign over the door
[1:14:51] Iglesia he would open the church
[1:14:53] churches the two doors up wide he was a
[1:14:58] carpenter and he began
[1:15:00] preaching his wife would be
[1:15:03] there his kids would be
[1:15:05] there he'd open the doors the windows
[1:15:08] and he'd preached into the
[1:15:14] neighborhoods I I remember talking to
[1:15:19] him and and he W he was exhorting me
[1:15:24] about about partaking of the bread and
[1:15:27] the
[1:15:29] wine and the Lord's
[1:15:31] supper and he says you shouldn't do that
[1:15:34] he said it's spiritual he would tell
[1:15:38] me he said it's wrong he' tell
[1:15:41] me I was I had just given my heart to
[1:15:44] the
[1:15:45] Lord I was 18 19 years
[1:15:49] old and I read him the scripture
[1:15:54] I said
[1:15:56] grandfather I love being with you cuz
[1:15:58] you tell me about the Lord
[1:16:03] Jesus he says and you tell me to stay
[1:16:06] with the
[1:16:07] word and I read to him where Jesus said
[1:16:11] I give you an example you do
[1:16:18] likewise I said if he said
[1:16:22] that and you're telling me I
[1:16:26] shouldn't who should I obey I
[1:16:30] said I'd never seen a look on that man's
[1:16:33] face like I did that
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:16:39] morning he he didn't answer
[1:16:42] me but the look on his face was a look
[1:16:47] of I don't know what to call it
[1:16:52] shock
[1:16:57] because even he in the Holiness groups
[1:17:00] he belong
[1:17:03] to had accepted that
[1:17:08] propaganda and though he was a man that
[1:17:10] read his Bible night and
[1:17:14] day somehow the old teaching of the
[1:17:17] denominations he was
[1:17:22] in
[1:17:23] didn't allow him to read the Bible and
[1:17:26] see what he was
[1:17:29] reading though he would read it over and
[1:17:33] over the eyes of his understanding were
[1:17:40] clouded and with shock in his
[1:17:45] face he just got
[1:17:47] up and walked out of the
[1:17:50] room and he never spoke to me of that
[1:17:55] again I could see it had become in his
[1:17:58] life a great struggle
[1:18:04] now cuz I told him you see Grandpa Jesus
[1:18:09] said
[1:18:13] so and he's looking at his bible and he
[1:18:16] sees
[1:18:17] it but he'd been so long believing it a
[1:18:20] different
[1:18:21] way
[1:18:27] St John
[1:18:28] 13 and verse
[1:18:30] one now before the Feast of the Passover
[1:18:34] when Jesus knew that his hour has come
[1:18:37] that he should depart out of this world
[1:18:39] unto the father having loved his own
[1:18:42] which were in the world he loved them un
[1:18:44] the
[1:18:51] end
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:18:59] put your name
[1:19:01] there that's you he's speaking
[1:19:04] of that's me he's speaking
[1:19:06] of verse two and supper being ended the
[1:19:10] devil having put into the heart of Judas
[1:19:12] scariot Simon's son to betray
[1:19:21] him say Jesus knowing that the father
[1:19:25] had given all things into his hands and
[1:19:27] that he was come from God and went to
[1:19:38] God this
[1:19:41] describes every son and daughter of
[1:19:44] God who's been baptized in the name of
[1:19:47] Jesus
[1:19:48] Christ and is born
[1:19:51] again that you come from
[1:19:54] God and you're returning back to
[1:19:57] God verse four he rises from supper and
[1:20:00] laid aside his garments and took a towel
[1:20:03] and GED
[1:20:10] himself almighty
[1:20:13] God he rises from
[1:20:16] supper laid his laid aside his
[1:20:20] garments and took a towel
[1:20:24] and GED
[1:20:25] himself to and GED himself verse
[1:20:31] four you might say but that was
[1:20:35] Jesus he could humble himself that
[1:20:41] way after that verse five he porth water
[1:20:44] into a basin and began to wash the
[1:20:47] disciples feet and to wipe them with a
[1:20:50] towel wherein he was girded
[1:21:00] almighty God made
[1:21:04] flesh washing the feet of his
[1:21:08] disciples then cometh he to Simon Peter
[1:21:11] and Peter say unto him Lord does thou
[1:21:13] wash my
[1:21:20] feet in other words Peter saying you're
[1:21:23] not going to wash my
[1:21:26] feet no no you're the boss around here
[1:21:28] you don't have to do that no don't worry
[1:21:31] about that uh I'm
[1:21:35] fine Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:21:39] verse 7 what I do thou knowest not
[1:21:48] now Jesus is
[1:21:50] saying when you have a foot wash Wasing
[1:21:55] service maybe many of you won't
[1:21:58] understand what you're doing at the
[1:22:01] moment but Jesus said but Thou shalt
[1:22:04] know
[1:22:05] Hereafter it would be revealed in our
[1:22:09] day what that ordinance would would
[1:22:12] would think would
[1:22:14] mean it would reveal in our
[1:22:17] days what it would do for us when we
[1:22:20] partake of
[1:22:21] it
[1:22:23] three ordinances left to the
[1:22:27] church but their life shaking
[1:22:35] ordinances verse eight Peter saith unto
[1:22:38] him Thou shalt never wash my
[1:22:45] feet I want to read that
[1:22:47] again
[1:22:49] Peter a man born in sin
[1:22:54] shaped in
[1:22:56] iniquity all of a sudden he's feeling
[1:22:58] more righteous than Jesus
[1:23:03] himself and he says oh no that ain't
[1:23:08] right you will never wash my
[1:23:12] feet never he
[1:23:14] said to
[1:23:16] Jesus he drew a line in the sand don't
[1:23:19] cross that line Jesus you're not washing
[1:23:21] my feet
[1:23:27] night Jesus answered
[1:23:31] him verse
[1:23:33] eight if
[1:23:35] I if I
[1:23:37] Jesus wash thee
[1:23:40] not thou H has no part with
[1:23:47] me and the only
[1:23:51] Jesus that anyone has a chance to
[1:23:56] see that anyone has a chance to see on
[1:24:00] planet
[1:24:02] Earth is you and
[1:24:09] I verse n Simon Peter saith unto him
[1:24:17] Lord if there's something I
[1:24:20] want is to be part of
[1:24:23] you and if this is what it'll
[1:24:26] take Lord not my feet only but my hands
[1:24:30] and my head he
[1:24:34] said Jesus Jesus saith unto him verse 10
[1:24:37] he that is washed needeth not to needeth
[1:24:41] not saved to wash his
[1:24:47] feet but is clean every wi and ye are
[1:24:51] clean but not
[1:24:58] all for there was
[1:25:00] one who would partake of that supper in
[1:25:03] that
[1:25:05] night that when he went to grab the
[1:25:09] bread Jesus's hand was in the bread with
[1:25:16] him it was
[1:25:18] Judas and he was not
[1:25:20] clean neither would he be
[1:25:23] cleansed he was not clean
[1:25:27] nor verse 11 for he knew who should
[1:25:30] betray him therefore said he ye are not
[1:25:33] all
[1:25:39] clean so after he had washed their feet
[1:25:42] and had taken his and had taken his
[1:25:45] garments and was sit down again he said
[1:25:47] unto them know ye what I have done to
[1:25:51] you
[1:25:58] they didn't
[1:25:59] know they didn't understand even the
[1:26:03] action not only his words but his action
[1:26:06] was a parable a mystery a
[1:26:13] prophecy verse 13 ye call me master and
[1:26:17] Lord can you say well for so I
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:21] am
[1:26:24] for if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:26:26] washed your feet ye also ought to wash
[1:26:30] one another's
[1:26:39] feet when I read it to my
[1:26:43] grandfather something I knew he had read
[1:26:45] hundreds of
[1:26:48] times and I asked
[1:26:50] him who should should I
[1:26:54] believe
[1:26:55] you or
[1:26:58] Jesus he he didn't know what to
[1:27:02] say he knew what he wanted to
[1:27:05] say always believe
[1:27:09] Jesus but now it had become something
[1:27:13] between believing him or
[1:27:17] Jesus he realized where he had placed
[1:27:21] himself
[1:27:23] in a spot where he never thought he
[1:27:25] would
[1:27:28] go that he would stand between a young
[1:27:31] man and the words of Jesus
[1:27:36] himself he didn't answer me a
[1:27:39] word he just got up
[1:27:43] quietly with head
[1:27:46] bowed and walked out of the
[1:27:50] room verse verse
[1:27:53] 15 Jesus
[1:27:55] speaking for I Jesus have given you an
[1:28:01] example that you should do as I have
[1:28:04] done to
[1:28:11] you verily verily I say unto
[1:28:16] you the servant is not greater than his
[1:28:20] Lord neither neither he that is sent
[1:28:23] greater than he that sent
[1:28:27] him if you know these
[1:28:32] things happy are
[1:28:36] ye just to know
[1:28:38] them he didn't say
[1:28:40] that if you know these
[1:28:44] things you only be
[1:28:48] happy if you do
[1:28:51] them
[1:28:53] right in the book of
[1:28:57] Exodus Israel in
[1:29:01] Egypt and God had planned a great day of
[1:29:07] Deliverance God had
[1:29:09] planned a great day of
[1:29:14] Deliverance and in verse in Exodus
[1:29:20] 12:3 was a was a night to be
[1:29:25] remembered so so much of a remembrance
[1:29:28] of it would
[1:29:33] be that a memorial would be placed for
[1:29:36] Israel
[1:29:39] forever it would be called the Passover
[1:29:45] supper he says and in verse 13 of Exodus
[1:29:50] 12 it reads like this and the blood
[1:29:54] shall be to you for a
[1:29:58] token upon the houses where ye
[1:30:04] are the blood is still a token
[1:30:08] today to be placed on the door of this
[1:30:11] house this Earthly
[1:30:16] Tabernacle he says and when I see the
[1:30:19] blood I will pass over you
[1:30:23] verse
[1:30:26] 13 and when I see the blood I will pass
[1:30:30] over you and the plague shall not be
[1:30:32] upon you to destroy you when I smite the
[1:30:35] land of
[1:30:43] Egypt and this day shall be unto you for
[1:30:46] a
[1:30:48] memorial and you shall keep it a feast
[1:30:51] to the Lord Lord throughout your
[1:30:58] generations and you shall keep it a
[1:31:00] feast by an ordinance
[1:31:04] forever the Bible said the Lord
[1:31:07] said it's a feast that you'll
[1:31:11] keep throughout your
[1:31:15] generations and someone said brother
[1:31:18] Daniel that Generations that was Jews
[1:31:21] not
[1:31:24] Gentiles so maybe that doesn't apply to
[1:31:29] us listen to
[1:31:32] Matthew 1 and verse
[1:31:35] one when Matthew is is opening this
[1:31:40] gospel and he says the book of the
[1:31:44] generation of Jesus Christ now he's
[1:31:47] going to start naming this generation of
[1:31:49] Jesus Christ and it begins by saying the
[1:31:52] son of David the son of
[1:31:59] Abraham so the it's Matthew 1:1 the book
[1:32:03] of the generation of Jesus Christ the
[1:32:06] son of David the son of
[1:32:13] Abraham and he goes down the
[1:32:17] list naming Isaac and Jacob and abinadab
[1:32:28] naming all the names of the tribe of
[1:32:35] Judah until he gets to
[1:32:38] Joseph down to the
[1:32:41] end so who is this
[1:32:45] generation are we not the generation of
[1:32:48] Jesus
[1:32:50] Christ
[1:32:53] is not Jesus Christ the son of
[1:32:57] David the son of
[1:32:59] Abraham God is claiming them as the
[1:33:02] generation of Jesus
[1:33:09] Christ so here in
[1:33:12] Exodus when
[1:33:16] it and the Lord
[1:33:19] said verse 14 Exodus 12 and this day
[1:33:24] shall be unto you for a memorial and you
[1:33:26] shall keep it a feast to the Lord
[1:33:28] throughout your Generations what
[1:33:31] Generations a Generation of
[1:33:35] Vipers no a generation of Jesus
[1:33:40] Christ beginning from
[1:33:42] Adam going down to the very
[1:33:46] last you and I this morning were the
[1:33:51] same
[1:33:52] generation of Jesus of Jesus
[1:33:57] Christ verse 15 of Exodus 12 seven days
[1:34:01] shall ye eat unleavened bread even the
[1:34:03] first day you shall put away leaven out
[1:34:06] of your
[1:34:17] houses for whosoever eateth leaven bread
[1:34:20] from the first day until the day that
[1:34:22] Soul shall be cut off from
[1:34:31] Israel and from this day forward they
[1:34:34] partook of this
[1:34:39] ritual called the
[1:34:42] Passover it was a
[1:34:44] supper but they were never understanding
[1:34:46] the prophetic
[1:34:50] significance that that that it what it
[1:34:53] represented that one day a man would be
[1:34:57] God's
[1:35:00] lamb these ordinances that are left to
[1:35:04] us communion foot washing baptism in the
[1:35:09] name of the Lord
[1:35:11] Jesus the revelation of it is that one
[1:35:15] day a man would be God's
[1:35:20] lamb
[1:35:25] Israel partook of the
[1:35:29] Passover as a
[1:35:31] memorial of what had God had done for
[1:35:35] them when they had become
[1:35:40] enslaved so the partaking of the
[1:35:44] Passover was a
[1:35:46] memorial of the power of
[1:35:49] God to set his people free
[1:35:54] it still represents that
[1:35:57] today partaking of the bread and the
[1:35:59] wine
[1:36:02] today when we partake of
[1:36:06] it it is a
[1:36:08] memorial of the day that God set you
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:14] free it's mesc
[1:36:19] priesthood serving you
[1:36:22] a memorial
[1:36:25] supper of the freedom that he has given
[1:36:29] you of the
[1:36:32] Deliverance of the hope that you'll be
[1:36:35] free forever in Christ
[1:36:40] now but for Israel it was only a
[1:36:45] memorial they didn't understand it they
[1:36:48] didn't see it was just a shadow of
[1:36:50] something to come
[1:36:55] they didn't realize that this Shadow
[1:36:57] would come into a reality one
[1:37:02] day and the day would
[1:37:05] come when they would kill God's
[1:37:12] lamb on a Passover
[1:37:15] feast and totally
[1:37:18] blind that once again
[1:37:22] like the first lamb that was ever killed
[1:37:25] in
[1:37:28] Egypt was
[1:37:31] shadow of one day of a lamb they would
[1:37:34] kill in
[1:37:38] Jerusalem the day would come
[1:37:42] again when they would kill God's lamb on
[1:37:48] Passover but the wickedness this time
[1:37:53] is they would
[1:37:55] refuse to put his blood on the door of
[1:37:58] their
[1:38:02] hearts they would refuse to eat his
[1:38:06] flesh the revealed word of
[1:38:09] God they would they would refuse to
[1:38:12] partake of the Lord's
[1:38:18] Supper for to partake of the the Lord's
[1:38:21] Supper
[1:38:24] today is
[1:38:26] to is to annal the
[1:38:31] Proverbs of an old
[1:38:34] Covenant and receive the
[1:38:38] revelation of The Parables of
[1:38:42] Jesus wherein lays the revelation of
[1:38:45] those Seven
[1:38:48] Seals or the seven parts
[1:38:52] of his great Plan of
[1:38:55] Redemption to save you to heal you to
[1:38:59] change you to Quicken you to transform
[1:39:03] you by the power of the Holy
[1:39:08] Spirit
[1:39:10] communion foot
[1:39:13] washing
[1:39:16] baptism three
[1:39:19] ordinances they mean more to
[1:39:23] you and they mean more to
[1:39:26] me then I think we really
[1:39:30] understand may God give us a revelation
[1:39:33] of
[1:39:42] this 1 Corinthians
[1:39:47] 11 the Apostle
[1:39:50] Paul
[1:39:51] Prophet
[1:39:54] Apostle Pastor did the work of an
[1:39:58] evangelist a great
[1:40:01] teacher he played the role of the of all
[1:40:04] five
[1:40:05] places of the fful
[1:40:11] ministry he set the New Testament Church
[1:40:14] in
[1:40:19] order he was the very scribe of the
[1:40:22] Bible he wrote almost half of the New
[1:40:29] Testament and in 1 Corinthians
[1:40:33] 11 Paul speaking to the
[1:40:37] Corinthians a very troubled group of
[1:40:43] people in verse
[1:40:46] 17 he says this now in this that I
[1:40:50] declare unto to you I praise you
[1:40:57] not that ye come together not for the
[1:40:59] better but for the
[1:41:04] worse what what church what group of
[1:41:07] people would do
[1:41:09] that many
[1:41:13] today for first of all when you come
[1:41:15] together in the church I hear that there
[1:41:18] be divisions among you and I part
[1:41:21] believe
[1:41:30] it for there must be also heresies among
[1:41:34] you that they which are approved may be
[1:41:37] made manifest among
[1:41:47] you when ye come together therefore more
[1:41:51] into one
[1:41:59] place th this is not to eat the Lord's
[1:42:04] Supper as I've instructed
[1:42:07] you but instead you're coming together
[1:42:10] just for a great religious social
[1:42:12] program
[1:42:19] time when you come together into one
[1:42:22] place he
[1:42:26] said he says you're not coming together
[1:42:29] to celebrate the Lord's
[1:42:33] Supper for then it would be a sacred
[1:42:36] moment for
[1:42:38] you then it would be a holy Union coming
[1:42:46] together this says this is not to eat
[1:42:48] the Lord's
[1:42:49] Supper
[1:42:52] though that's what you've called it in
[1:42:53] your
[1:42:56] denominations but you've turned it into
[1:42:58] a
[1:43:01] wickedness in in in into
[1:43:05] carnality verse 21 for in eating
[1:43:09] everyone taketh before others his own
[1:43:17] supper and one is
[1:43:19] hungry
[1:43:21] and another is
[1:43:25] drunken verse
[1:43:27] 22 what have ye not houses to eat and
[1:43:31] drink
[1:43:35] in he is rebuking
[1:43:43] them he says what have ye not houses to
[1:43:47] eat and drink
[1:43:49] in
[1:43:52] will you turn the sacred ordinances of
[1:43:57] God into another religious social
[1:44:05] program what have ye not houses to eat
[1:44:08] and drink
[1:44:10] in or despise ye the Church of
[1:44:15] God and shame them that have
[1:44:19] not what shall I say to you shall I
[1:44:23] Praise You In
[1:44:25] This I praise you
[1:44:30] not they would say we're going to have
[1:44:33] the Lord's supper
[1:44:37] tonight and one would come and say look

[1:45:09] supper I'm just going to eat my own
[1:45:11] bread you guys eat what you
[1:45:13] brought cuz mine is better than
[1:45:17] yours that's what the Corinthians were
[1:45:20] doing
[1:45:22] that's what this sacred ordinance had
[1:45:24] come
[1:45:26] to and Paul's rebuking them for
[1:45:30] it verse 22 what have ye not houses to
[1:45:34] eat and drinken or despise ye the Church
[1:45:37] of God and shame them that have

[1:45:52] what shall I say to you shall I Praise
[1:45:54] You In This I praise you
[1:46:00] not I will not praise
[1:46:03] you for I have received something of the
[1:46:06] Lord he
[1:46:07] says verse 23 for I have received of the
[1:46:11] Lord that which I also delivered unto
[1:46:19] you and you haven't been doing it the
[1:46:22] way the order that I set for
[1:46:27] you that the Lord
[1:46:30] Jesus Paul's saying listen
[1:46:34] close that the Lord
[1:46:36] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:46:41] betrayed took
[1:46:43] bread and when he had given
[1:46:46] thanks he break it and said
[1:46:52] take eat this is my
[1:46:55] body which is broken for
[1:46:59] you this
[1:47:01] do in
[1:47:03] remembrance of
[1:47:06] me let's read it
[1:47:09] again after and when he had given thanks
[1:47:16] Jesus he break it and said take eat this
[1:47:20] is my body which is broken for
[1:47:27] you this do in remembrance of
[1:47:33] me the words of
[1:47:38] Jesus after the same manner also he took
[1:47:41] the
[1:47:43] cup and when he had St saying this cup
[1:47:46] is the New Testament in my
[1:47:49] blood
[1:47:53] this do you this do ye as of as ye drink
[1:47:56] it in remembrance of
[1:48:02] me this bread and this
[1:48:05] wine the very
[1:48:08] ordinance the very
[1:48:11] act to partake of it in sincer and
[1:48:16] sincerity it's in remembrance of him
[1:48:19] that you stand before the
[1:48:24] supper thanking
[1:48:26] him for all that he's done for
[1:48:31] you it's a time of
[1:48:34] Thanksgiving when we rise
[1:48:37] up above all our
[1:48:40] complexes and say I'm going to give
[1:48:42] glory to the God who has kept
[1:48:47] me who has saved me
[1:48:51] who has cleansed me who is delivering
[1:49:00] me verse
[1:49:03] 26 for as often as you eat this
[1:49:08] bread and drink this
[1:49:11] cup you do show the Lord's
[1:49:15] death till he
[1:49:19] come
[1:49:22] for as often as you eat this
[1:49:26] bread verse
[1:49:28] 26 for as often as you eat this
[1:49:32] bread and drink this
[1:49:35] cup you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:49:43] come verse
[1:49:46] 26 that's
[1:49:48] 276 as
[1:49:58] until he
[1:50:00] comes into your
[1:50:03] heart into your
[1:50:06] life wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:50:09] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:50:16] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:50:19] and blood of the
[1:50:22] Lord as guilty as you as as if you would
[1:50:26] have been a Jew on that
[1:50:31] day and you shouted crucify
[1:50:35] him that's how
[1:50:38] guilty that's how unworthy to partake of
[1:50:41] it
[1:50:44] unworthily but let a man examine
[1:50:48] himself verse 28
[1:50:52] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:50:54] drink of that
[1:50:57] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:51:02] unworthily eateth and drth Damnation to
[1:51:11] himself
[1:51:13] Judas partook of that
[1:51:16] supper of the bread and the wine
[1:51:20] his hand bumped the hand of Jesus as he
[1:51:22] went for the
[1:51:27] bread but he ate and drank of
[1:51:30] it
[1:51:33] unworthily and it brought
[1:51:37] damnation because he didn't
[1:51:40] discern the Lord's
[1:51:42] body he says for this
[1:51:46] cause because of partaking of these
[1:51:48] ordinances in the wrong wrong
[1:51:54] way for this
[1:51:57] cause many are
[1:51:59] weak and sickly among
[1:52:03] you for this cause many are weak and
[1:52:06] sickly among you and many
[1:52:14] sleep in other words the eyes of their
[1:52:18] understanding is
[1:52:21] blinded many are weak to live a life
[1:52:24] worthy of the
[1:52:28] Gospel many are sick with sin
[1:52:43] sickness verse
[1:52:46] 31 for if we would judge ourselves we we
[1:52:49] should not be
[1:52:56] judged in other words Lord I realized in
[1:53:00] the
[1:53:02] past I didn't realize the great
[1:53:08] significance what it
[1:53:11] means to take those
[1:53:13] steps and partake of your
[1:53:17] supper but I know now
[1:53:21] of the
[1:53:23] sacredness and you
[1:53:25] said that we should partake of
[1:53:29] it verse 32 but when we are judged we
[1:53:33] are chastened of the Lord that we should
[1:53:36] not be condemned with the
[1:53:44] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:53:47] come together to eat Terry one one for
[1:53:57] another If any
[1:53:59] man has the
[1:54:04] idea that if he's
[1:54:07] hungry he'll be able to eat a little
[1:54:12] tonight Paul said I'd rather you just
[1:54:14] eat at
[1:54:17] home verse 34 and if any man hunger let
[1:54:20] him eat at
[1:54:23] home the the the Lord's Supper isn't for
[1:54:26] take away your natural
[1:54:32] hunger the Lord's Supper is for you can
[1:54:35] come in
[1:54:38] remembrance of the great things God has
[1:54:40] done for
[1:54:42] you of the things he the dangers he
[1:54:45] delivered you
[1:54:47] from of the revelation he has given
[1:54:51] you oh he said partake of
[1:54:55] it happy are ye if you do these
[1:55:02] things
[1:55:05] happy are
[1:55:07] ye if you do these
[1:55:10] things has happiness been escaping
[1:55:17] you maybe you haven't been partaking
[1:55:22] and if any man hunger verse
[1:55:25] 34 let him eat at
[1:55:28] home that you come not together into
[1:55:31] unto
[1:55:34] condemnation and the rest I will set in
[1:55:38] order when I
[1:55:41] come there's more
[1:55:44] order that needs to come to the
[1:55:48] church Paul said I I don't have
[1:55:51] time just
[1:55:53] now but I'll come
[1:55:56] again in Matthew
[1:55:59] 22 and verse
[1:56:02] one this this here
[1:56:06] also was a communion
[1:56:09] supper this was a communion
[1:56:13] supper it was a
[1:56:16] celebration of a union of a man and a
[1:56:19] woman
[1:56:21] in holy
[1:56:23] matrimony listen close Matthew 22
[1:56:26] beginning at verse
[1:56:29] one and Jesus answered and spake unto
[1:56:32] them again by Parables and
[1:56:37] said the kingdom of God the Kingdom of
[1:56:41] Heaven is like unto a certain King which
[1:56:43] made a marriage for his
[1:56:48] son
[1:56:50] now let your
[1:56:52] thoughts go all the way back to
[1:56:56] Genesis when a king
[1:57:00] there was planning a marriage for his
[1:57:04] son to his daughter
[1:57:07] Eve to bring forth the family of God in
[1:57:13] Holiness you see how deep his thoughts
[1:57:16] run it says and sent forth his servant
[1:57:19] to call them that were bidden to the
[1:57:21] wedding and they would not
[1:57:29] come in
[1:57:31] Genesis those who he bid and didn't
[1:57:35] come was the groom and the bride
[1:57:42] themselves and they wouldn't come they
[1:57:45] didn't come they didn't come God's
[1:57:48] provid Ed
[1:57:53] way verse four again he sent forth other
[1:57:57] servant saying tell them which are
[1:57:59] bidden behold I prepared my dinner my
[1:58:02] oxen and my fatlings are killed and all
[1:58:05] things are ready come unto the
[1:58:18] marriage
[1:58:21] it was going to be a great wedding
[1:58:27] supper it was going to celebrate an a
[1:58:32] union in
[1:58:34] Holiness but they made light of it verse
[1:58:37] 5 and went their ways one to his farm
[1:58:40] another to his
[1:58:48] merchandise
[1:58:50] and the remnant took his servants and
[1:58:52] entreated them sply and slew
[1:58:59] them now Jesus in a
[1:59:03] parable was speaking to
[1:59:06] Israel the church the
[1:59:09] Pharisees of not something
[1:59:13] future but it was actually a
[1:59:16] prophecy unfolding right before them
[1:59:22] what he was talking about wasn't
[1:59:25] past though had been spoken in the
[1:59:28] past and what he was talking about
[1:59:31] wasn't
[1:59:33] future as he was talking
[1:59:36] about this is what Israel was guilty of
[1:59:39] right then in that
[1:59:42] [Music]
[1:59:43] moment that day this scripture was this
[1:59:46] Parable was unfolding before Israel
[1:59:52] and the remnant he says and they made
[1:59:55] verse five and they made light of it and
[1:59:57] went their ways one to his farm another
[1:59:59] to his
[2:00:05] merchandise and the remnant took his
[2:00:07] servants and entreated them sply and
[2:00:09] slew
[2:00:12] them now he's speaking of the prophets
[2:00:15] that Israel themselves had killed the
[2:00:18] prophets
[2:00:22] but when the king heard thereof he was
[2:00:26] wroth and he sent forth his
[2:00:30] armies the Philistines the
[2:00:34] amorites all the Pagan
[2:00:37] Nations and destroyed those murderers
[2:00:39] and burned up their
[2:00:44] City verse seven verse seven but when
[2:00:48] the king heard their of he was wroth and
[2:00:50] he sent for his armies and destroyed
[2:00:52] those murders and burnt up their
[2:01:01] City then said he to his
[2:01:04] servants these seven verses I've been
[2:01:07] talking to you
[2:01:10] about this wedding I've been talking to
[2:01:13] you about in a

[2:01:21] says the wedding is
[2:01:28] ready verse eight the wedding is
[2:01:33] ready some said well I thought you were
[2:01:35] talking about something

[2:01:45] right now in your lives the wedding is
[2:01:48] ready he said
[2:01:51] says but they which were bidden were not
[2:02:00] worthy
[2:02:02] Israel You're the fig
[2:02:04] tree with no figs on
[2:02:07] you and when I came to
[2:02:10] you you had no
[2:02:13] fruit you weren't
[2:02:15] ready I invited you to be the bride I
[2:02:20] invited you to be my
[2:02:23] wife and you've
[2:02:26] refused verse n Go ye therefore into the
[2:02:29] highways and as many as you shall find
[2:02:32] bid to the
[2:02:39] marriage in other words I will take this
[2:02:42] marriage to a gentile
[2:02:46] people I'll invite a people who have
[2:02:49] been living in
[2:02:51] sin I I'll invite a people who have been
[2:02:54] living on the
[2:02:58] streets I'll invite them to come to this
[2:03:00] marriage to be my wife Jesus
[2:03:05] says Oh Amazing Grace how sweet the
[2:03:09] sound that saved the rich like
[2:03:13] me I once was
[2:03:15] lost but now I'm found and invited not
[2:03:21] only to the wedding but to be the Bride
[2:03:24] of the groom
[2:03:28] Glory so those servants verse 10 so
[2:03:32] those servants went out into the
[2:03:34] highways and gathered together all as
[2:03:37] many as they found both bad and good and
[2:03:41] the wedding was furnished with
[2:03:47] guest
[2:03:54] and when the king came in to see the
[2:03:56] guest he saw there a man which had not
[2:03:59] on a wedding
[2:04:05] garment and he saith unto him friend how
[2:04:08] camest thou in hither not having a
[2:04:10] wedding garment and he was
[2:04:17] speechless
[2:04:23] then said the king to the servants bid
[2:04:25] him bind him hand and foot and take him
[2:04:28] away and cast him into outer Darkness
[2:04:31] where there shall be weeping and nashing
[2:04:33] of
[2:04:43] teeth for many are
[2:04:46] called but few are chosen
[2:04:49] to
[2:04:50] partake of the bread and the wine in
[2:04:56] remembrance of the great
[2:04:59] things God has
[2:05:01] done for you and for
[2:05:06] us in the message the God of this evil
[2:05:12] age brother brandham says
[2:05:17] this she is a part of the
[2:05:21] groom the
[2:05:24] bride true to him in every
[2:05:29] Point waiting for the
[2:05:32] wedding the wedding
[2:05:35] day a uniting
[2:05:38] time not at The ecumenical
[2:05:43] council but in the
[2:05:45] sky at the wedding supper
[2:05:51] now now this is for our own
[2:05:55] church she has been
[2:05:57] given and it's been revealed to
[2:06:00] her the seven seal Mysteries of the
[2:06:05] Bible 1965
[2:06:08] August this is for our own
[2:06:11] church she has been given and it's been
[2:06:15] revealed to her the seven seal mystery
[2:06:18] of the
[2:06:20] Bible she sees the Folly of the
[2:06:26] deceiver so very close to the
[2:06:31] truth that almost would deceive the
[2:06:35] elected she sees it he says see the two
[2:06:40] opposing Spirits at work in this evil
[2:06:47] age
[2:06:50] can you see
[2:06:52] it each is very
[2:06:56] religious Cain and Abel the spirits
[2:06:59] again coming to their
[2:07:03] heads still same as they started
[2:07:08] out it's still the same as when they
[2:07:10] started
[2:07:15] out one is worshiping by Beauty and by
[2:07:24] knowledge and by
[2:07:26] education and by science and by ethics
[2:07:31] and the other one by faith of a
[2:07:33] revelation of the word of
[2:07:39] God he was preaching in Jeffersonville
[2:07:43] Indiana and then he
[2:07:45] says to the church both both of
[2:07:49] them is standing right in this building
[2:07:52] this
[2:07:55] morning brandom
[2:07:57] Tabernacle
[2:08:00] wow he says that's
[2:08:06] right and the message doors in
[2:08:13] door he saids see but see it's like the
[2:08:17] church
[2:08:19] has to pass through the Hall of
[2:08:25] critics we we go through
[2:08:28] that you're you're going to be called a
[2:08:30] Holy
[2:08:32] Roller you're going to be called
[2:08:35] Everything But If You Could Only Hold
[2:08:37] Your Position in
[2:08:42] Christ someday he'll take us to the Hall
[2:08:45] of
[2:08:47] Fame
[2:08:51] but first we've got to stand
[2:09:05] criticism is this there is where the
[2:09:07] littleness of us
[2:09:11] stands there is where it
[2:09:14] shows he that cannot stand
[2:09:17] chastisement
[2:09:21] is an illegitimate
[2:09:23] child and not a child of God no matter
[2:09:27] how much he's joined
[2:09:29] church and whatever he's
[2:09:32] done if he cannot stand
[2:09:37] chastisement he's an
[2:09:39] illegitimate he's not a real child of
[2:09:42] God but a real genuine child of
[2:09:46] God don't care what the world
[2:09:50] says everything else is
[2:09:53] secondary he's got his mind on
[2:09:56] Christ that settles it yes whatever
[2:10:00] Christ says
[2:10:03] do whatever Christ says to
[2:10:09] do he'll do it wherever the lamb
[2:10:14] goes they're with
[2:10:17] him and then you see his
[2:10:21] appearing his presence and what he does
[2:10:25] he's always with his
[2:10:28] people his bride he is courting
[2:10:33] her someday there's going to
[2:10:37] be a
[2:10:39] wedding and a wedding
[2:10:43] supper that
[2:10:44] wedding is
[2:10:46] represented by a
[2:10:50] Rapture you
[2:10:52] see the bride of
[2:10:55] Christ is us
[2:10:57] now is us
[2:11:00] now the Bride of we are the bride of
[2:11:04] Christ already and yet we are also his
[2:11:08] wife
[2:11:12] already because the
[2:11:14] bride is his
[2:11:16] wife adorning her
[2:11:18] herself preparing her wedding
[2:11:25] dress for the wedding
[2:11:29] day but under the Jewish
[2:11:35] Traditions when a woman
[2:11:39] accepted a man's request for her to be
[2:11:42] his
[2:11:45] wife when a woman
[2:11:49] accepted the man's
[2:11:54] request to be his
[2:11:57] wife then she was then when she accepted
[2:12:00] it she was wife
[2:12:04] already and yet she was just the
[2:12:07] bride because the wedding day was still
[2:12:10] in the
[2:12:12] future but they had made a vow that
[2:12:15] could not be
[2:12:17] broken
[2:12:20] that should not be
[2:12:22] broken so now this bride this
[2:12:26] wife there's a time of
[2:12:30] preparation adorning herself preparing
[2:12:34] the wedding
[2:12:35] dress for the wedding day when when her
[2:12:39] and the
[2:12:45] bridegroom would be would would after
[2:12:47] that wedding
[2:12:50] day he would take his wife with him to
[2:12:53] live with him eternally in the heavens
[2:13:03] above a
[2:13:05] Rapture represents the wedding
[2:13:08] day when the groom takes his
[2:13:13] wife to the wedding
[2:13:16] supper and now to live together
[2:13:21] eternally St John

[2:13:31] going to
[2:13:33] read Jesus said in these verses we're
[2:13:37] going to

[2:13:53] thing to partake of this

[2:15:00] is my
[2:15:03] flesh which I will give for the life of
[2:15:06] the
[2:15:09] world the Jews therefore strove amongst
[2:15:16] themselves saying how can this man give
[2:15:19] us flesh to
[2:15:25] eat then Jesus said unto them verily
[2:15:29] verily I say unto

[2:20:50] mother with a broom in her
[2:20:52] hand standing shoulder to shoulder with
[2:20:55] all these
[2:20:58] soldiers and he comes walks up to
[2:21:01] her he says

[2:22:16] Christ
[2:22:19] to encourage
[2:22:21] ourselves to bring us to
[2:22:26] remembrance of the great
[2:22:29] things he's done for
[2:22:31] us and to testify it
