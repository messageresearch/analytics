presence into our congregation into our lives you can be somewhere and be the only one worshiping don't worry he'll honor that maybe no one one else will he come down to visit but if you worship he'll come down and visit you we first we want to make welcome our brother Enrique and uh Enrique Jr I remember Enoch same and uh so we make you all welcome here and we welcome all of our regulars everyone for your support for being here for without you I would just be preaching to Karen but we're thankful for each and every one of we want to continue we've been speaking on this subject marriage and divorce in our day and and and the title in the mouth of two or three Witnesses because the Revelation which which and the truth actually lays in the mouth of two or three Witnesses and when a prophet preached marriage and divorce he brought out these three Witnesses but many times our eyes are clouded over and and instead of seen these three Witnesses we we just see the man that was preaching so we completely lose the truth of what he was saying because we're looking at a man singular but if we look at the holy spirit that was speaking through the mouth of a prophet and was bringing the loose ends together he was just the mouth piece so we want to get past the mouthpiece and see what was spoken and what was spoken for us was a reminder that the truth lays in these three Witnesses one being Jesus one being the Apostle Paul one being the prophet Moses and when you bring together what they said not what William brandham said because he didn't say it he was reminding us of what was said he was reminding of us what was in the Bible he was reminding us what was in the Lamb's Book of Life no book himself he was given a book and you and I are given a book and it's the same book that he was given we are given also John in Revelations 10 he took the book from him from the mighty angel in Revelations 108 John took the book from that strong Angel the one with the rainbow over his head he didn't take the book from the seventh angel because the seventh angel has no book except the the same book that was given to him is given to us he was he was simply sent to tie together all the Loose Ends that were in this book called the Lamb's Book of Life bring together all the witnesses that have that have witnessed in this book and bring us a truth that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses all the teachings of the Bible can become a revelation to us the Born Again experience justified by faith Sanctified by the spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost predestination Sons and Daughters of God being adopted by the father changes in our lives coming daily the refilling of the Holy Ghost why they're given what they do for us each and every time all these things in the mouth of two three Witnesses and marriage and divorce this truth is also in the mouth of two or three wi turn with me we're going to read once again in first Thessalonians 4 verses 1 through and then we'll turn and read to Matthew 19 verses 8 to 10 first Thessalonians 4 and verse one furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk to please God so ye would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess your vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concupiscence even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forwarned you and testified for God ha not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness Matthew 19 vers 8 to 10 Jesus speaking to a multitude and answering the question that uh Ministers of this great denomination his day were asking him to find fault with him but they didn't know that they didn't know the scripture that that they didn't have thus sayith the Lord that they simply had a proverb and they didn't know why the proverb had been given to them they thought this proverb was thus sayith the Lord and it could not be changed and anyone who tried to change it was a blasphemer and thus they could put that person to death that's what they were looking to do for Jesus and that's why they asked him the question but he caught them in their own trap verse eight they they they asked them they verse seven let's start there they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication this is where Jesus mixed the word wife with fornication and thus he hid a great mystery from the world and it actually seems to have brought great confusion to [Music] all because they say if it's his wife wouldn't it be adultery even though fornication is the the same act he says and he says and whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery so now Jesus has told them Moses gave you writing of divorce so you can put your wives away for any reason it was a proverb it wasn't thus sayith the Lord he said but he says unto her but except it be for fornication so now jesus takes away all the reasons to put away their wife any reason and he brings it down to one reason now they hadn't had this kind of a Stern message in 4,000 years this for them this was this was crazy how dare you change the way we've been living in the so-called message for the last 6070 years because they'd been living a proverb and not thus sayth the Lord statements had been become Doctrine and doctrines had become propaganda to the people to the churches and they were too blinded to see it it was a proverb that Moses had gave them God had said in the beginning and wrote with his finger on Stone Thou shalt not commit adultery and then Moses added all the different reasons why perhaps but Jesus Jesus tells him he said he he they asked him didn't Moses say we could give her a writing of divorce and put her away for any reason he said he said Moses verse eight because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives from the beginning it wasn't so and Jesus had come God who sat on the throne the father had descended in a body of Flesh for what reason to take us all back to how it was in the beginning that was the purpose that God came down that's why he became flesh that's why he had a supernatural birth so he could offer us a supernatural birth and that Born Again experience to the beginning verse N9 I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for this one reason now fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoo Marth her which is put away do commit adultery his disciples say un to him the Pharisees didn't say it the Sadducees didn't say it they didn't believe it they didn't want it his disciples say unto him if this be the case of a man with his wife in this message today it's not good to marry the thought is with us with man yet today you let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you we give you honor and glory and we ask that you bring forth your Witnesses in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated we had also read in Matthew 5 there where Jesus was speaking and he repeats the same thing again in verse 31 he said been said unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication verse 30 30 I'm sorry verse uh verse 31 Matthew 5 but I say to you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication a change had come because that's what the New Testament was about that's what the Lamb's Book of Life was about this new testament this New Covenant that we have written in a book this is the L's Book of Life it spoke to us of the Lamb's life in Matthew Mark Luke and John and it spoke to us of how we could have the Lamb's life so this New Testament written from Matthew to Revelation this is the Lamb's Book of Life but yet it was all spoken in Parables but today the Holy Spirit using a prophet to bring the loose ends together to give us a revelation of so then we could live by faith because the prophet told us faith is the Revelation in verse 32 Jesus said but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery it's a serious matter it's like if you would cause someone to commit murder or you you cause someone to to to Rob for you or you cause someone to lie for you it's a serious thing for you to be the cause of something like this he says causes her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that his divorce committeth adultery brother Bram said in marriage and divorce now many of you this might be Greek to you he says but my church understands he said he says now that our Lord has opened the seven seal mystery of his word to us and in this last days he says now many of you this might be Greek to you but my church understands so there will be a church understands this Bible This Promise of Salvation this quickening power because they'll they will understand that they're looking at a book that's been opened that the seven seal mystery have been opened because of this opening we can understand what Jes but you must have a revelation that the book is open so Jesus in the text we wrote we read invited us to go back to the beginning for the true scriptural answer because he told us what you're telling me now it wasn't so in the beginning and I'm here present the Lord Jesus telling us to take us all back to that beginning when we walked with God when we talked with God when we still had a friendship with the father he goes on to say at the beginning there was only one pair of anything one pair of any species was God's perfect order at the beginning multiple partners between male and female was not in the beginning before the fall of God's children in Genesis 31 and Genesis 3 was the seventh day the seventh day began in chapter 2 of Genesis the seventh day continued all the way into Genesis 3 more was spoken of the seventh day than was of all the other days Genesis 1 was dedicated to the prophecy of what would take place in six days one chapter but God dedicated two chapters to the seventh day did you know that did you realize that he gave he he he said he said more about the seventh day than he did of the other six days because it was in the seventh day that he brought forth his son a spoken word son it was in the seventh day that he was tutoring his son to do the works that he was doing to be a spoken word Creator to for Adam to be a participant in bringing forth the family of God by the spoken word more was said on the about the seventh day all the other days and I want to tell you this morning more is said about this seven seal than all the other seal the pattern of God's word it's laying in the word it's laying in this message but we've got to learn to look at the word the way God wants us to see it a revelation now multiple partners between male and female was not in the beginning before the fall of God's children in Genesis 3 having multiple partners is what brought the fall the serpent introduced Eve to polygamy and when she partook of this act of fornication it broke her harmony with God and threw the whole world out of cater all Humanity out of CER her fall her her taking the reasoning of the serpent over the prophetic word of God the serpent threw all the animal kingdom out of cader but even more than that the serpent mixed his seed with the seed of man and It produced a hybrid man and woman that we are today with a polygamous inclination towards foration adultery and multiple partners because that was the nature of the serpent that's the DNA that was in this serpent that was the mentality of of this serpent that's why Satan wanted to use this most subtle beast of the field to genetically modify the children of God you thought GMOs was just a modern thing no it's it's been since the beginning it was said Lucifer's Lucifer's trick in the beginning and that's the nature of the serpent that's in this body today because of the sex birth it was that was not God's plan he gave Adam and Eve free moral agency they knew they would bring forth the family of God so Lucifer didn't change that no no he perverted it he said yes he'll bring forth the family of God but isn't it taking a long time isn't it a real struggle has he actually told you what day you'll have this this this incredible Supernatural experience he said well no no we don't have a date we don't know when he's coming he says how if I tell you I can get you to that spot where he wants you but I can give you a date right now that's why we must be born again to receive a new nature spirit that won't take the devil's shortcut so we can practice our courtship unto marriage and Holiness and keep a vow till death do us part otherwise you'll play The Dating Game through the lust of the flesh you mean only the young people brother Daniel well it really happens kind of between the age of about 12 and 100 years old unless you're born again you'll play the You'll Play The Dating Game without the Born Again experience through the lust of the flesh defiling each other in filth and immorality having multiple Partners you mean you mean the Catholics brother the Daniel not only them you mean the lutherans no not only them you mean the Baptist not only them do you mean in the message too yes they're included because every human being on the face of the Earth if you don't belong to the mystical body of Jesus Christ if you hav't been born again you are subject to this fall in your life too God rich in Mercy giving us his truth so in the beginning this is what brought the fall God's children had fallen remember that before the fall the woman was quot equal in all creation men stand up today pagans religious men denominational people and they they want they think that they know how to make the woman co-equal he says the woman can do things just as good as a man this they can preach too why don't you have them preaching in your church you see man through his carnal [Music] ways he he wants to bring forth the woman and make her co-equal without her being born again and men who haven't been Born Again standing in the pulpits fall for the devil's [Music] lie it wasn't God that that in the beginning had the the man to rule over the woman beginning God made them coequal it was disobedience it was unbelief that brought this curse upon the woman you say a curse that a man would rule over [Music] her a beastly Man Without Christ in his life all of a sudden he's the boss you don't have to look back too many years to see what what the man has done to his family to his wife to his children the men who haven't been born again the men who haven't given their lives to Christ the men who who who when they make a mistake there's no Holy Spirit there to to to to tap them on the shoulder say you shouldn't have said that you shouldn't have talked to her that way you shouldn't have pushed your son to the wall and knocked him [Music] down and that kind of man was given the headship over the woman and the family oh my goodness man you have nothing to brag about unless you've been born again and you can stand up and say I'm not that way no more I want to do my family Justice I want to treat my wife with respect and love in the beginning God made them coequal after the fall each must have a separate Covenant there in Genesis 3 a great white Throne judgment you remember begins about verse 14 God curses The Serpent and it goes upon its belly because it wasn't that way before so Prophecy in the word of God is very telling that that it reveals to us that if the curse was it went up is is that it went upon its belly and that was the curse then that means prior to that stood on two feet he walked around it was a man then in verse 15 then he brings judgment upon the woman he said I will put Amity between thee and the woman speaking to the serpent and between thy seed this is the first time the mentions the serpent seed that was planted in the woman that brought forth a beastly man whose name was Cain remember in the Book of John John says and Cain was of that Wicked one Malo Malo and he says he says and I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel it was a prophecy the woman's seed was to be the spoken word that would create a seed and place it in a little girl it was a prophetic word but the woman fell and the judgment That Came Upon her I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception it wasn't going to be that way it would have been the spoken word it would have been a spoken word seed there would have been no sorrow in this conception he said in sorrow th shall bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and believe it or not from this day forward because of Disobedience he shall rule over thee but he's really not fit to rule over you because he's as Fallen as you are Fallen the man the woman no longer co-equal with the man and God changes her Covenant and it's this change in Covenant for the woman that now determines this permissive will this was not God's perfect will for the Believers concerning how we approach marriage until we are restored to the beginning that once again we'll be Co in co-equal covenants with Jesus Christ a Christian lady with a Godly husband she is living as close as a woman has ever lived to be co-equal with her husband not living with a religious man that doesn't mean you're getting close to this co-equal experience no it's living with a man who's been born again that the Holy Spirit checks him you know when as man we get up on the wrong side of the bed and the first thing out of our mouth is something rude but if you've been born again the Holy Spirit tells you as you're washing your face off in the bathroom you shouldn't have said that now go back outside and make that right marriage and divorce in our day in verse 17 in this white Throne judgment here in Genesis he speaks to the man Adam and he does not curse Adam like he did the serpent the serpent the curse affected it physically the woman when God judged her she was affected physically but he doesn't touch Adam in verse 17 18 God says for thy sake he says I'm going to curse the ground he says in sorrow Thou shalt eat of it all the days of their life he says because of what you've done this Earth is now going to bring forth thorns and thistles and thou shalt eat the herb of the field how will you eat it in the sweat of thy face Thou shalt eat bread prior to that they didn't know what it was to perspire that's an attribute of a Dying [Music] World and not a son of God in the presence of God God made the Earth his Target to receive his wrath so that his so that his son would not be cursed we walk on a cursed Earth thorns and thistles remind us daily of the grace of God and the curse on planet [Music] Earth wrath of God on every coast of this planet Paul said in Romans 8:22 we know that the whole creation grth and travaileth in pain together until now 8:22 Adam's Adam's Covenant did not change but his personal tutorship and adoption with and by the father had been indefinitely postponed he G the spirit of God he walked out from behind the Seal of God when he listened to Eve's deception on her shortcut on how they could be like God through this polygamy Act of adultery and fornication now polygamy is introduced not only to Eve by the serpent but all creation is affected prior to the coming of Christ polygamy was a covenant in which man had fallen into and all the animal kingdom through Lucifer anointing the serpent to hybrid Adam's race with the seed of the serpent we this body is fallen and mixed with the seed of the serpent this body cannot be born again what is Born Again is the seed of God the soul that's laying in here the inner you the real you who who was who wandered in spiritual amnesia who am I where am I going then one day the light struck the seed one day the washing of the water of the word anointed the seed and you were born again and now when you threw yourselves to the lust of the flesh through a born again experience Supernatural birth now we begin to mortify the Deeds of the flesh we're overcoming we're being molded we're baptized with the Holy Ghost and in great struggles that we have you say I thought I had the Holy Ghost why am I struggling so much with this then the Holy Spirit comes down with a refilling of the Holy Ghost once again and he lifts you up as I've told you before the refilling of the holy spirit is not a reward for your good behavior there's no such thing no no the refilling of the holy spirit is strength to overcome the trial you find yourself in the refilling of the Holy Ghost is strength to live a life worthy of the Gospel the refilling of the Holy Ghost is strength to say no when someone wants you to say yes and you know it's the devil speaking the refilling of the Holy Ghost is strength to overcome once again prior to the coming of Christ polygamy was the Covenant given to Fallen man and all the animal kingdom too but at the coming of Jesus Christ Jesus ANS Moses's writing of divorcement because that wasn't thus sayith the Lord that was just a proverb and Proverbs can be aned so Jesus anuls Moses writing of divorce and the Covenant of polygamy can now be overcome you can now as an an individual you can abandon that way of life you can Ann that style of living it's for the believer to have a closer walk with his creator that's why Jesus came as was a son being adopted by the father now Jesus is making an invitation to return to how it was in the beginning so you and I can be sons and daughters being adopted by the father again because he wants to take us back to how it was beginning so that we can live that way now today as sons and daughters being restored and given strength to overcome God the the rich in Mercy as we know Solomon had a thousand wives and David 500 because they had fallen they were falling en men to a fallen Covenant the entire Animal Kingdom had fallen when Adam fell all fell with him there was there was no Escape in it for the human race when Adam fell all creation fell with him the animal kingdom the bird kingdom the the the fish Kingdom everything fell the insect Kingdom when Adam and Eve fell everything fell with them that's why when Jesus came he he died he was buried he rose again the third day if you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior repent or you're baptized in his name because he rose again if you accept him if you follow him if you love him you will not fall because we're not following a fallen ad following a fallen Adam We are following a risen Adam never fall and if you follow him you cannot fall again he'll raise you up the message marriage and divorce Madam says this noce don't fail this now take it all down in your hearts speaking of Solomon davidon he said but not not one of those women could even have one more husband he is the original cre creation not her not one of those women could have one more husband but that one husband could have a thousand wives but remember in in the beginning neither could Adam have another wife but in the beginning neither could Adam take another wife take another neither could Eve take another husband in the beginning before the fall neither did they want to because they had a holy Veil and that's what the Born Again experience is bringing back to us as men and women to place a holy Veil before us you won't desire another husband you won't desire another wife you'll desire to be like it was in the beginning once again only death will ever separate you brother Bram says he says that's thus sayith the Lord that's the Bible now I've went back took my time showed you where it started what Jesus said he said he said when Abraham took Sarah down into the Philistine country there was a king down there named aimc and Sarah was 100 years old or 90 years old but she had been changed back to a young woman and been made beautiful did you know that and aik wanted her for wife aik wanted to take Sarah for a wife he probably had a herum already but he could but he could not take her if she was married to Abraham it was a truth back then even amongst the Pagan kings that it was considered wrong wickedly wrong to take another man's wife oh we've lost that today that's for [Music] sure so Abraham said to Sarah say that you are my say that you are my my sister because he'll kill me say that we're brother and sister because he'll kill me so that he can have you why didn't he just Chase Abraham out of the country and take his wife and go on one moment why why didn't he why didn't he Chase Abraham out of the country and take his wife and go go on not only Allah was it with Believers but to all people in the creation or Saint you are responsible man for these acts there was a heathen King how many knows that story is true the Bible there in about Genesis 16 you notice aik would have took her for a wife he fixed himself to have this new Hebrew girl and she said well Abraham he's my brother Abraham said she's my sister AB said no problem I'll just take her for a wife then could you imagine a man doing a thing like that but he did could you imagine woman being put and made subject for men to rule over them but it is because of the Fall oh everything got turned upside down between husband and wife between God and man and then that night while slept the Lord appeared to a pagan King in a dream and said aimc you're as good as a dead man how much more if we're born again of the spirit should we expect God to come on the scene and lead us and talk to us and give us dreams and teach us how to live we should expect it if he did it for a pagan King he'll do it for you he'll answer all your questions and he'll give you strength strength as the head of every home to do justice to your family not violence Justice in the love of God and you'll start to treat her like it was in the beginning God said bik you're as good as a dead man he was protecting that stream of Jewish blood there you're as good as a dead man you've got another man's wife you're fixing to marry and if you go through with it I'll destroy your kingdom I'll destroy everyone in it I'll destroy your life says you you know if I knew I wouldn't have do that they lied to me they lied to me why those message folks they lied to me I can't believe they did it even under the Covenant of polygamy it was absolutely a sin to take another man's wife because that's what brought the fall of Man in the beginning and to practice that continues to bring the fall of men women Children and Families yet today but at the coming of Jesus Christ thus sayith the Lord he tells Israel in Matthew 19 you'll not have occasion use this proverb of one man and many and many wives a proverb was that a proverb it was and it would change because Proverbs can be changed Proverbs can be uned a proverb is a saying that gives advice usually as a a metaphor a simple traditional saying that expresses uh a perceived truth based on common sense or experience that's what Israel was full of and God would change it that was the purpose of him coming God through the ministry of the first Elijah had five things he wanted to do for Israel it's written in Isaiah 40 the five things that God was going to do for Israel when he came and it was going to begin with the ministry of John the Baptist and the Bible tells us that John would bring these five things the first thing he would bring is change the second thing we would bring was change third thing we would bring to Israel is change the fourth thing he was bringing his change the fifth thing he was bringing his change Jesus Christ came to change us so they were nothing at all like we've been they came to change his Israel rejected the change Israel rejected the open world Israel rejected the revelation of and a New Testament Church inherited the portion that was for the firstborn son Israel now it's ours if you can if you'll receive it if you'll believe it it's laying in the Bible this new testament it is the Lamb's Book of Life the book that is so despised in this last day you know what the title of it is the closing book of this new testament it's called The Book of the revelation of Jesus Christ and men don't want nothing to do with what are they rejecting they're rejecting the revelation of Jesus Christ in their lives where will that take you that rejection to a devil's hell to a polygamous lifestyle foration and adultery a proverb Israel was given many Proverbs let me read you just a few or just even one in Exodus 20 verse 4 and 5 this was not thus sayith the Lord this was a proverb it reads like this EX 20 and verse 4 he said Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth he said Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of and today we have a proverb that one person in the congregation can bring a curse on the whole church and everyone will be part of that iniquity if you make it a Doctrine you go way far off it was a proverb it would change when did it change in the days of Ezekiel Ezekiel 18 beginning at verse one and it says here the word of the Lord came unto me again saying that means thus saith the Lord what mean ye that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel saying that the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge in other words the fathers have committed sin I visit the sin on the children that's where it was saying verse three as I as I live sayth the Lord God he shall not have occasion anymore to use this proverb in Israel he said behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is M now the soul that sinth it shall die you see what sometimes things that we make laws and doctrines in our churches are not thus sayith the lord it's a proverb and many of them we should change we should we must Ezekiel 18 ver4 now if he beg get a son that seeth all his father's sins which he has done and consider and do it not such like that hath not eaten up mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to Idols of the House of Israel had not defiled his neighbor's wife neither have oppressed any not withholding The Pledge neither have spoiled by violence but had given his bread to the hungry and covered the naked with a garment that had not taken off his hand from the poor did not receive Usery nor increase as executed my judgments and walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live Ezekiel saying the proverb that I'll visit this iniquity to the third and fourth generation he says no more no more thus saith the Lord the soul that sinth that Soul shall surely die that's the one I'll judge that's the one I'll judge like all truths of the Bible they all come together they all inter so when you speak on the Born Again experience you get to speaking on things on marriage and divorce when you speak on the refilling of the Holy Ghost it brings in so many things because the book has been open and now we see everything's connecting now when God gives us a revelation we put a comma because we understand there's more of the Revelation he gives us that we get excited about what's even more exciting and wonderful is to say if I understand this much more more how much more is there yet to understand and see because it's an eternal word it's God's word and Jesus declares the New Covenant For All Mankind sinner saint belever unbeliever but only the believer cares enough to want to put the revelation of marriage and divorce for our day in practice remember polygamy was us was a sinful was a sinful and Fallen lifestyle introduced to Eve by the serpent and injected into all Humanity an attribute of the seed of the serpent it complicated and brought pain and sorrow and separation to that first marriage and it does it every marriage since then the type of Christ his wife being a many membered body doesn't translate down to Fallen man giving giving him a Godly right to have more than one wife or Jesus was wrong when he said one exception no no longer for any reason he brought change to Israel from any reason to just one reason and his disciples said you should have warned us before you preach this series on marriage and divorce this is you just caught us by surprise this morning if that be the case of a man why even get married so the type of Christ his wife being a many membered body doesn't translate to Fallen man giving him a Godly right to have more than one wife or Jesus was wrong when he said one exception for remarriage and that was fornication not adultery because then it would be two exceptions when it's just one and men say no no brother Daniel fornication or adultery either one now you make it two exceptions Jesus said one Matthew 19 once again we begin at verse one and it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these Saints he departed from Galilee and came into the coast of Judea Beyond Jordan and great multitudes follow him and he healed them there a healing campaign of the ministry of the son of man catching the attention of the people so they could have confidence in him when they seen the great miracle that his word was as good as his miracles verse three the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him tempting him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause they thought they had the answer that would shut his mouth and find him guilty to be put to death verse four and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female or he put him on the spot I thought you guys were Bible readers what are you doing every evening what are you doing every weekend what are you doing in your spare time oh now I know too many videos that's what God's coming to change also the Temptation that robs us of our time to meditate on him blessed is the man in 2023 that meditates on my word day and night and he answered and said unto them verse four have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore what therefore God hath joined together let no man put aunder not even Moses they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and put her away Jesus said I was hoping you would ask that question because that's the one you really need answer to he said unto them Moses Moses your prophet in this day because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and the reason I've come Lion of the tribe of Judah Messiah God made fresh is to take you back me in the beginning it has begun the restoration of the Bride tree the restoration of the Fig Tree the restoration Daniel FR and kenth Lopez it has begun restoration this is the day that the Lord has made to change you and I do you see it he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wife because he was unable to give you a born again experience but I jesus I can do that that's why I'm telling you you can be changed now I'm offering you a born again experience the changing power of the Lamb of God that's why he shed his blood on calary that's why Blood fell on the earth s ify that's why the blood wants to fall on you this morning sanify you he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so so why would someone finally come to a place of divorce I'm not judging no one but it's because Hearts have become hardened and you can say wait a minute brother but I had a reason for all your reasons the heart still became hardened God wants to give you he wants to soften the heart with oil verse n and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife not for any reason but except it be for for and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever marri her that is put away that commit adultery once the ball of sin starts rolling it's a mess his disciples say unto him if the case of man be so with his wife it's not good to marry it's not good to marry and I agree until you've been born again it's not good it's not good for a young lady to marry a young man who hasn't been born again who hasn't received the Holy Ghost in his life not good for a young man to marry a young woman who hasn't been born again who hasn't received the baptism because the young lady through a born-again experience who's who's learned to be faithful to Jesus Christ serving the lord for years now guess what she knows what it takes to remain faithful to someone only death can part you that's why young man you want a young lady that loves God and has been faithful to him young lady that's why you want a young [Music] man who's proved his faithfulness to God because in doing so he is showing that he can be faithful to a young lady now the truth of marriage and divorce is found in the mouth of three Witnesses Jesus Christ the Apostle Paul Moses an Old Testament Prophet brother Bram tied the loose ends together of what Jesus said what Paul said what Moses said all three of these men were prophets thus sayith the Lord and it required a prophetic Ministry to tie them together for us and the revelation of marriage and divorce has come to us in the mouth of these three Witnesses here is our first witness this morning it's Jesus Christ himself Jesus said the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him trying to find fault think thinking they'd been in the message a long time and that they had all the answers to everything what they had was Proverbs with periods you know that's what we have today in this message we've been taught Proverbs with periods instead of thus sayth the Lord the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause they they they were thinking he would say yes of course Moses said it yeah it's a quote in the message I'll read it for you and he answered and said unto them have you not read aren't you Bible readers that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and he said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh cleave here is the Greek word it means to join oneself closely so so close you become one flesh verse six says wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let no man put us under everything had changed it was a drastic change it was thus sayith the Lord it wasn't for everyone only the believer only the man and woman that loved God embraced the change only the man and woman that love God took the fire of God into their bosom and said yes I Jesus said they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and put her away he said I'm glad you asked that question I've got another answer for you he said Moses of the hardness of your heart the same hardness in your heart that you're coming here to tempt me with the word it's the same hardness in your hearts for your for your marriage vow Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives instead of kill them instead of doing them violence instead of being abusive but from the beginning was not so it wasn't so from the beginning verse n and I say unto you who shall ever shall put away his wife he didn't say adultery he said fornication now mixes the word wife with the word fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her which is put away does commit adultery his disciples said unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it's not good to marry you know what caused them to make that statement even after that wonderful service that day their hearts were still hardened to hear the truth didn't soften the heart to hear the truth said well if that's the way you're going to be in this church I'll go somewhere else God never changed the one Commandment that he left for sinner or Saint to abide by so even under polygamy there might be order and mercy for the woman you cannot take another man's wife has been something that God has told man ever since the beginning when a man called The Serpent took another man's wife Eve that still applies today and here's the Bible reason why and this is the woman's New Covenant after the fall a woman is bound to her husband as long as as he lives that's the that's what that's that was the New Covenant that is what she felt him remember Genesis 3:16 unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children if they had done it God's way they wouldn't be going through that then God tells them and thy desire shall be to thy husband because her desire at first for a moment had been to another man you see the language God uses what he said and he shall rule over thee it wasn't so it wasn't that way till after the fall when a man when a woman accepts a man's proposal for marriage if she has a father at home he should have helped her to choose rightous God-fearing man as fathers we must help our daughters choose we want them to marry a man they love of course but as fathers we must be involved to judge if the man is worthy if he's ready to be a husband to any woman when our daughters marry we turn over full headship to another man once you give her away you have no right to go over there and tell them how to live you have no right to go to your daughter and tell her how you want her to be acting no you should face the husband now to whom you gave all this full headship to and if you don't like it you shouldn't have given him full headship over that girl daughter oh husbands men in the house we need a real Holy Ghost backbone the love of God standing in the gap for our girls did you hear that we want to them to marry a man they love but we as fathers we must be involved to judge if the man is worthy for when our daughters marry we turn over full headship to another man and she is bound to that man as long as she lives if they divorce dear sister you cannot by the word of God remarry unless he dies is it fair no it's not but God but God Made You coal with man in the beginning Lucifer through the serpent beguiled Eve with his words just as many serpents are beguiling young women today with and Disobedience to God's word uned her first Covenant and gave her a covenant I hate to say it but equal to her conduct the Bible says all that we s and yet God promises us change through a born again experience Matthew 19:7 they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and put it away remember it was a proverb he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and who so Marth her which is put away do commit adultery his disciples say unto him if the case of the man beow with his wife it's not good to Mar and they said the statement because one service had not changed their hearts there was still a Harden remember it's one cause not two fornication not fornication and adultery that would be two causes so Jesus is now opening the book been sealed with Seven Seals and it's telling you now the truth of marriage and divorce verse nine he said again in closing now I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except that be for fornication this is Jesus talking this is God made flesh and shall marry another commit adultery and who so marri her which is put away does commit adultery Jesus now tells us there's only one exception for a man to put away his wife and Mar another that's fornication no brother what if she cuts her hair can I leave her for that if your heart is that hardened I guess you could but you cannot remarry her and be just before God because there's only one cause and trimming the hair wasn't that cause what if she's a terrible cook send her to get lessons don't leave her go with her we're closing with this Jesus our first witness as we stand to our feet it was part five part six is coming with the other witnesses as we bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you now Lord Jesus as we enter into your word with caution because we're just men asking for Revelation and this is an eternal word and you will be the final judge on Judgment Day we're not bringing judgment we're trying to share with your people and trying to share with young people a better way a more excellent way but for many of us who have made mistakes the Born Again experience and the scepter of Grace as we as we
