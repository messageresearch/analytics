[42:50] hundreds of years after the law
[42:54] uh hundreds of years before for the law
[43:01] sorry uh God instructed a order of of
[43:05] his Commandments of his
[43:09] word before he had a
[43:16] priesthood he ordered that those that
[43:18] were going to participate in the
[43:21] priesthood they were not only going to
[43:23] receive
[43:25] tithes
[43:29] that not only were they going to receive
[43:30] tithes but the the ministry was going to
[43:32] pay
[43:34] tithes that this
[43:37] Commandment that the Lord brought
[43:41] here it was before the
[43:46] law it was God putting everything in
[43:49] order and this
[43:51] commandment it was it was um firm
[43:58] and even before the
[44:02] law under the ministry of the Lord Jesus
[44:05] Christ in this new
[44:07] testament it it be it it it continues
[44:10] the
[44:11] same because it went before the
[44:14] law it went through during the

[49:19] Abraham that he paid tithes unto
[49:23] MHC even in the loins of Abraham
[49:28] this was a a principle that God was
[49:34] putting that each one that was going to
[49:36] receive
[49:37] tithes was also going to pay
[49:40] tithes even before the law it was

[52:22] press and these scriptures from verse 30
[52:25] 25 to 30 we uh
[52:29] recognize and the Lord being the same
[52:32] yesterday today and
[52:34] forever he never changed his
[52:36] mind when he spoke to
[52:40] Abraham through the voice of a prophet
[52:44] Apostle
[52:45] Paul when he
[52:50] said Levi was still in the loins of
[52:54] Abraham
[52:56] um Abraham was his grandfather great
[52:58] grandfather great grandfather
[53:05] sorry and that he he rece he paid ties
[53:08] of where unto
[53:15] Abraham Levi also paid ties unto Jehovah
[53:18] as
[53:23] well I always thought of this scripture
[53:26] before what it
[53:30] meant and I thought it's God putting a
[53:34] principle and this
[53:38] principle it was to those that were
[53:40] going to receive
[53:43] tithes it was also going to be for them
[53:46] to pay
[53:48] TI and for the tithing that came
[53:53] in one tenth of of those
[53:57] Heights was for the
[54:01] Levites in reality was for the
[54:05] ministry for Aaron and his
[54:10] sons and also for the ministers that
[54:12] would Minister for the
[54:14] Levites and
[54:17] all not just the the lay
[54:23] member all the lay member and the the
[54:27] ministers paid tithes to
[54:31] Jehovah
[54:33] remember the the people that had their
[54:37] tithes bring their
[54:41] tithes they wouldn't bring it directly
[54:43] to the
[54:45] ministry the tithes and the
[54:48] offerings it was unto
[54:51] Jehovah Jehovah gave
[54:54] commandment
[54:56] that he was going to give unto the
[54:58] ministry a portion of his
[55:01] tithes that those that had been brought
[55:04] to
[55:06] him yes
[55:10] amen the the tithing was for the
[55:17] ministry and the ministers were toay
[55:19] tithing of their me of their
[55:22] tithing that was the shadow
[55:27] it was what God put in his
[55:30] word and it was mandatory under the
[55:34] law if you were a
[55:38] Believer a
[55:41] Philistine he wasn't a part of this of
[55:46] this was a follower of
[55:50] Jehovah it wouldn't pertain to
[55:54] him
[55:55] he he wasn't tearing the word of
[56:00] God when he didn't fulfill
[56:03] [Music]
[56:06] it because it wasn't his portion to
[56:08] fulfill it he wasn't a
[56:11] Believer he wasn't a Son of
[56:17] God this was only to the
[56:20] Believers to the followers of
[56:23] Jehovah and it
[56:26] continu let's go to the book of
[56:33] Hebrews let's go to the book of
[56:36] Hebrews
[56:40] chapter and we're going to begin with
[56:42] verse
[56:46] one and this is where Paul um marvelous
[56:50] declaration marvelous
[56:53] declaration and he says that the
[56:56] priesthood
[57:02] unchangeable the priesthood being
[57:07] changed there's also a
[57:11] necessity that also be a change to the
[57:15] law read in verse
[57:17] one and this is what it
[57:23] says this mzc king of Salem priest of
[57:27] the most high
[57:32] God who met Abraham returning from the
[57:35] slaughter of the Kings and blessed
[57:40] him to whom all also Abraham gave a
[57:43] tenth part of
[57:48] all God is
[57:51] establishing a
[57:53] pattern and that is to to tie to
[58:10] tie verse Two To whom also Abraham gave
[58:13] a tenth part of all first being by
[58:15] interpretation king of righteousness and
[58:17] after that also king of Salem which is
[58:19] king of
[58:23] peace without father without mother
[58:25] without
[58:29] descent neither having beginning of days
[58:31] nor end of
[58:34] life but made like unto the Son of
[58:39] God abideth a priest
[58:43] continually if we could see
[58:46] it and we could look back to that day
[58:49] I'm I'm
[58:53] certain
[58:56] I'm certain that he would you would see
[58:58] as he was in flesh in the
[59:04] in he was going to be the same man
[59:08] MC as Jesus of
[59:11] Nazareth one time that God
[59:16] chooses how this man was going to look
[59:20] his face his his color of his his
[59:28] height I know that I believe that was
[59:31] the same it's exact
[59:36] same because the Bible
[59:39] say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[59:41] today and
[59:43] forever God was not going to
[59:50] choose the body of M MZ to descend
[59:57] a man that was dark with blue
[1:00:02] eyes with a man with blond blonde hair
[1:00:05] I'm sorry blue
[1:00:08] eyes with blue eyes and white
[1:00:14] skin and then and choose a a man Jesus
[1:00:17] of Nazareth Moreno
[1:00:21] dark dark
[1:00:23] haira uh brown eyes
[1:00:26] God wasn't going to do
[1:00:29] that once he chooses something he's the
[1:00:35] same when he chose to
[1:00:38] descend in the form of a
[1:00:41] man to to come in in the in the presence
[1:00:45] with
[1:00:47] Abraham he used the same
[1:00:51] form when he came through the uh Virgin
[1:00:54] Mary
[1:00:58] and when he uh came to grow as a man he
[1:01:01] was the same
[1:01:02] man that God had
[1:01:05] used
[1:01:07] before to have an encounter with
[1:01:10] Abraham
[1:01:23] continue verse three without father
[1:01:26] without mother without descent having
[1:01:28] neither beginning of days nor end of
[1:01:29] life but made like unto the Son of God
[1:01:31] abideth a priest
[1:01:39] continually now consider how great this
[1:01:41] man was unto whom even the patriarch
[1:01:43] Abraham gave tenth of the
[1:01:46] spoils it was God the same
[1:01:49] God that made himself flesh to
[1:01:53] descend
[1:01:55] to establish a principle in his
[1:01:59] people through his
[1:02:01] sons and through his
[1:02:03] family verse
[1:02:11] five and verely they that are of the
[1:02:13] sons of Levi who receiveth the office of
[1:02:16] the
[1:02:21] priesthood have a commandment to take
[1:02:23] tithes of the people according to the
[1:02:26] law that is of their
[1:02:30] Brethren Paul is making it very
[1:02:32] clear this
[1:02:34] commandment this
[1:02:37] principle that he began before the
[1:02:42] law that God had the same where God had
[1:02:46] the encounter with
[1:02:50] Abraham though they came out of the
[1:02:52] loins of Abraham
[1:02:55] one more
[1:02:56] time and
[1:03:02] certainly and verely they that are of
[1:03:04] the sons of Levi who receive the office
[1:03:06] of the
[1:03:11] priesthood have a commandment to take
[1:03:13] tithes of the people according to the
[1:03:17] law that is of their
[1:03:22] Brethren though they come out of the
[1:03:24] loins of
[1:03:29] Abraham but he whose descent is not
[1:03:31] counted from
[1:03:34] them received tithes of
[1:03:38] Abraham and blessed him that had the
[1:03:46] promises and but he whose descent is not
[1:03:50] counted he gave
[1:03:53] TI
[1:03:55] in
[1:03:56] truth in truth it was God
[1:04:02] himself and to give ties
[1:04:07] to the ties and
[1:04:10] offering our attitude should be
[1:04:14] this I bring to the house of
[1:04:17] God I give this to
[1:04:22] God God supplies our
[1:04:27] needs God gives me
[1:04:31] work everything that I have he gave to
[1:04:34] me and he tells
[1:04:37] me stay with the
[1:04:41] 90% And you just give me the
[1:04:45] 10 that's the attitude of the
[1:04:49] Christian that's not something that we
[1:04:52] demand or that we should
[1:04:55] demand in this time that we're
[1:05:01] living it's in one that a son has to
[1:05:04] have a
[1:05:07] revelation thankfulness to the blessings
[1:05:09] that God has given us he gives to God
[1:05:13] the
[1:05:23] tithe
[1:05:26] and without all contradiction the less
[1:05:28] is blessed of the
[1:05:30] better that's
[1:05:32] us the
[1:05:35] minor and the major is
[1:05:38] God that He
[1:05:44] blesses to to bring as as we we can
[1:05:49] see as we walk in this
[1:05:52] life we can look behind us where we
[1:05:59] were and we can see where we are right
[1:06:04] now and we can see how God has blessed
[1:06:06] us in a great man
[1:06:09] spiritually in our our income income
[1:06:15] sorry in everything God has blessed
[1:06:19] us everything that we
[1:06:21] have we receive from the hand of God
[1:06:28] if you really have a
[1:06:31] revelation and then bring to me this
[1:06:35] portion the tithes and your
[1:06:42] offerings
[1:06:48] verse and here men that die receive
[1:06:53] tithes
[1:06:56] but here he receiveth them of whom it is
[1:06:59] witness that he
[1:07:02] liveth because in in in
[1:07:05] truth the tithes and the
[1:07:08] offerings they they belong to
[1:07:11] him that
[1:07:13] lives our heavenly father
[1:07:17] Jehovah the Lord Jesus
[1:07:19] Christ he's the only worthy of tithes
[1:07:24] and
[1:07:25] offerings our attitude should
[1:07:28] be I bring my tithes and offerings to
[1:07:31] the
[1:07:35] Lord yes he yes we put him in the hands
[1:07:38] of a man a
[1:07:42] steward and that man is
[1:07:45] responsible God makes him
[1:07:48] responsible he he acts
[1:07:51] justly with the ties and the offerings
[1:07:53] of the people
[1:07:57] it
[1:07:58] said that the
[1:08:03] tithes it said that the ties belong to
[1:08:06] the
[1:08:07] pastor and they put a period
[1:08:10] there do a black
[1:08:15] period a black period and very
[1:08:18] large reality in
[1:08:22] truth it's not just to the
[1:08:24] Pastor to the
[1:08:26] ministry the fivefold
[1:08:31] ministry but the pastor is the one
[1:08:33] that's responsible unto
[1:08:37] God to justly divide those
[1:08:41] tithes to the fivefold
[1:08:46] ministry so that the local Ministry can
[1:08:48] be
[1:08:49] blessed I mean the local um people can
[1:08:52] be blessed people
[1:08:58] the ties are
[1:09:00] not
[1:09:01] 100% to the
[1:09:04] pastor the ties
[1:09:06] are
[1:09:08] 100% of
[1:09:10] God the
[1:09:12] offerings
[1:09:14] 100% to the
[1:09:19] Lord and the Lord puts it into a
[1:09:21] Steward's hands amen
[1:09:26] so it can be justly
[1:09:33] divided so the ministries of
[1:09:37] today they're going to pay a great
[1:09:40] price how they
[1:09:42] used the
[1:09:44] offerings and the tithes of the
[1:09:48] Lord because one under the
[1:09:52] law the TI and the offering
[1:09:55] and the
[1:09:57] sacrifices that the people would bring
[1:09:59] unto the
[1:10:02] Lord like a a cow
[1:10:06] or a ram like a
[1:10:11] ram like a calf goat a goat
[1:10:15] sorry a
[1:10:21] sheep a flow
[1:10:26] offering of two birds
[1:10:30] like everything would be brought to the
[1:10:32] altar
[1:10:33] of and there unto the altar of
[1:10:36] God God would
[1:10:38] choose of the
[1:10:41] offerings of the
[1:10:44] sacrifices of the Levites and the
[1:10:49] the which were going to receive the
[1:10:51] tithes of the the I'm sorry say that one
[1:10:54] more
[1:10:56] time they were going to receive the ties
[1:10:58] of
[1:11:04] them not everything that people bring of
[1:11:08] the ties where the ministry going to use
[1:11:10] all of
[1:11:11] it because if that's the way it
[1:11:15] was the the believer would bring his his
[1:11:21] lamp like a rope unto
[1:11:24] him and the levite would bring
[1:11:27] him the levite would take
[1:11:33] him and he would tell the believer
[1:11:38] there these ties the offerings that you
[1:11:40] gave these are mine
[1:11:44] now and the um the and the lamb ENT the
[1:11:48] lamb enters
[1:11:50] into through the door of a believer
[1:11:55] and the levite comes he turns over to
[1:11:59] the Prest he turn over to the
[1:12:01] priest okay and the levite
[1:12:05] say the the tides belong to
[1:12:09] me takes the
[1:12:13] sh he goes out he goes out the other
[1:12:15] door and and doesn't give the Lord an
[1:12:19] offering you see what we're doing when
[1:12:21] we
[1:12:22] say
[1:12:24] and you see what we say when the ties
[1:12:26] belong to the pastor and you put a
[1:12:28] period on it's not like
[1:12:31] that the Commandment wasn't like
[1:12:36] that but the
[1:12:38] levit he had the
[1:12:42] responsibility to put the Lamb on the
[1:12:46] altar this burnt offer this burnt
[1:12:49] offering to put on the
[1:12:52] altar
[1:12:54] that there was certain portions that
[1:12:56] were for the
[1:12:58] Levites and and
[1:13:00] certain and certain
[1:13:03] offerings he would on his
[1:13:06] shoulder he would take the shoulder of
[1:13:08] the the portion of
[1:13:12] the take the shoulder of the sacrifice
[1:13:14] the shoulder of the sacrifice of
[1:13:19] that for him
[1:13:21] and but but the rest of it
[1:13:25] it would stay on the
[1:13:29] altar because it was offering and tith
[1:13:31] unto the
[1:13:35] Lord and now to say in these days that
[1:13:38] we
[1:13:41] live that the ties belong to the pastor
[1:13:46] period that doesn't leave
[1:13:50] anything and the portion that we bring
[1:13:52] to Jehovah
[1:13:55] you see what we do with the
[1:13:58] shadow that should here to
[1:14:02] come there in that time it was it was
[1:14:05] you were
[1:14:08] obligated because it was part of your
[1:14:14] religion and the offerings and the
[1:14:16] tithes many
[1:14:18] times it was an animal it was a bird it
[1:14:23] was was
[1:14:24] flower different
[1:14:27] things it was a herb
[1:14:31] herb but now it's
[1:14:35] changed it's more modern
[1:14:39] times now but the principle the
[1:14:42] same firm the word of
[1:14:45] God and what we
[1:14:49] give in that
[1:14:52] time for the
[1:14:54] believer it was you were
[1:14:57] obligated because if you
[1:15:02] sinned in order to receive
[1:15:07] pardon you had to bring your offering
[1:15:10] your
[1:15:13] tithing to bring a sacrifice unto the
[1:15:20] Lord was the Lites that
[1:15:24] to unfold these
[1:15:28] sacrifices in in the way that Jehovah
[1:15:33] wanted your could be accepted unto the
[1:15:37] Lord forgiven of your
[1:15:39] sins that was the Shadow the
[1:15:43] type that of something that was
[1:15:47] coming let's continue
[1:15:52] reading
[1:15:54] uh we're going to read from chapter 7
[1:15:55] verse
[1:16:06] 9 and as I may so say Levi also who
[1:16:09] receiveth ties paay ties in
[1:16:13] Abraham one says what was the
[1:16:17] purpose to do to say this declaration
[1:16:20] for God for God to make this statement
[1:16:22] to make this statement
[1:16:27] and as I may so say Levi also receive
[1:16:30] tithe paid tithes and
[1:16:33] ab who receiveth the
[1:16:37] TI and God said this
[1:16:41] statement because he was putting
[1:16:43] everything in
[1:16:46] order years and years hundreds of
[1:16:51] years that the law was being brought
[1:16:55] to this
[1:16:57] truth this
[1:16:59] commandment it was before the
[1:17:01] law those that receive
[1:17:06] tithes that they God would bring that
[1:17:09] they would have to pay ties

[1:17:19] 10c for he was yet in the loin of his
[1:17:21] father when mzc met
[1:17:29] him if therefore Perfection were by the
[1:17:31] levitical
[1:17:35] priesthood for under it the people
[1:17:37] received the
[1:17:41] law what further need was there that
[1:17:43] another priest should
[1:17:46] Rise
[1:17:48] thec um Paul said uh to the and after
[1:17:51] the order of MDC

[1:19:09] ties also the lay
[1:19:12] member as the
[1:19:14] minister under the order of
[1:19:17] mzc and that
[1:19:19] order that is the fivefold ministry of
[1:19:23] the Lord Jesus
[1:19:29] Christ and verse 11 once
[1:19:37] more if therefore Perfection were by the
[1:19:40] levitical priesthood for under it the
[1:19:42] people received the
[1:19:47] law what further need was there another

[1:20:01] Aaron verse 12 Paul
[1:20:05] says for the priesthood being
[1:20:10] changed the completely changed the
[1:20:13] priesthood completely changed it was a
[1:20:16] it was a
[1:20:20] Shadle the priesthood was no longer
[1:20:22] going to be the same in this age in this
[1:20:27] age it was a New Testament
[1:20:31] law it was a new testament priesthood
[1:20:35] high priest high
[1:20:42] priest for the precept being changed
[1:20:45] there is made of a necessity a change
[1:20:48] also of the
[1:20:50] law today we want
[1:20:54] we want a new
[1:20:57] priesthood but we want to we want to
[1:20:59] follow in
[1:21:00] legalistic my
[1:21:03] brother it tears all scripture it breaks
[1:21:06] every
[1:21:09] scripture for the prood being
[1:21:17] changed there is made of necessity a
[1:21:19] change also of the
[1:21:21] law
[1:21:25] but he that receiveth
[1:21:27] tithes he also has to pay
[1:21:33] tithes that was under the the ministry
[1:21:36] of
[1:21:38] mzc a a PR
[1:21:42] unchangeable a PR
[1:21:48] Eternal and when God made this
[1:21:51] statement that Levi was in the Lo loins
[1:21:54] of
[1:21:56] Abra that he was going to receive
[1:21:59] tithes he was also going to pay
[1:22:02] them he was
[1:22:05] speaking a new a new
[1:22:09] priesthood that was going to
[1:22:12] come at the same as the Lord Jesus
[1:22:16] Christ he was going to be the high
[1:22:19] priest of
[1:22:21] mzc
[1:22:26] it was a law that was
[1:22:32] unchangeable the one that receives
[1:22:34] tithes that he also had to pay
[1:22:39] them many times as a
[1:22:42] minister many times as a minister we
[1:22:46] think I'm a
[1:22:48] minister I don't have to pay
[1:22:51] TI but that's not scriptural
[1:22:56] no that's not scriptural under the
[1:23:01] law under the um the priesthood of
[1:23:08] MC it's not scriptural during the law
[1:23:11] and the
[1:23:14] prophets it's not scriptural one once
[1:23:21] more
[1:23:26] when he has changed the priesthood of
[1:23:28] Aaron to
[1:23:31] MDC back back to the beginning once
[1:23:43] again for the priesthood being changed
[1:23:45] there is made of necessity a change also
[1:23:47] of the
[1:23:51] law
[1:23:56] for he of whom these things are spoken
[1:23:58] pertaineth to another tribe of which no
[1:24:00] man gave attendance at the
[1:24:03] altar now in this
[1:24:06] time our ties and
[1:24:08] offerings those are belong
[1:24:12] to to
[1:24:16] somebody somebody is said in the
[1:24:21] Bible that is it's not of the tribe of
[1:24:27] Levi the Lord Jesus was not of that
[1:24:30] tribe the Lord
[1:24:33] Jesus came out of the tribe of
[1:24:41] Judah that which no man gave attendance
[1:24:43] at the
[1:24:45] altar but it's him
[1:24:48] now that belong
[1:24:51] to
[1:24:53] belongs our ties and
[1:24:59] offerings and You by Revelation
[1:25:03] give and the minister Me by
[1:25:08] revelation we we we need to know how to
[1:25:10] apply
[1:25:11] it how divide it how to divide
[1:25:15] it what portion is
[1:25:20] ours and which portion we are to
[1:25:26] maintain so that when ministers come
[1:25:29] they can be a
[1:25:31] blessing through the
[1:25:37] tithing and
[1:25:40] so now the Apostle
[1:25:42] Paul we read the
[1:25:45] scripture and him
[1:25:49] speaking he would bring the gospel to
[1:25:51] the Corinthians
[1:25:53] I give thanks to
[1:25:56] God I haven't received one penny from
[1:26:03] you and I've invested more time with
[1:26:06] another
[1:26:09] people but he says I give thanks to
[1:26:13] God of the the brothers in
[1:26:17] Macedonia they saw the need
[1:26:20] here and those being
[1:26:23] poor and from their being
[1:26:28] poor and from them being poor they still
[1:26:31] gave their tithes
[1:26:33] from they've made me
[1:26:37] Rich so I could come to
[1:26:41] you Paul said I give thanks to
[1:26:44] God that I've work with my
[1:26:47] hands to sustain
[1:26:51] me but the time
[1:26:53] came Paul as he got
[1:26:56] older and Paul in his
[1:27:00] sickness Paul in the last days of his
[1:27:04] ministry in
[1:27:08] prison he was always before a tribunal
[1:27:11] judg like a judgment
[1:27:16] Hall and he would
[1:27:19] come and they would come to him
[1:27:25] bring him
[1:27:29] another they would bring him
[1:27:31] food they would take care of him the
[1:27:35] Saints brothers in
[1:27:38] Christ they would bring this offering
[1:27:40] and
[1:27:41] tithes so he could
[1:27:43] live and the majority of his his
[1:27:48] ministry and it it was writing the
[1:27:51] Epistles
[1:27:54] while he was in
[1:27:58] prison men would come to
[1:28:00] him
[1:28:03] many and they were lifting up God was
[1:28:06] lifting up as
[1:28:11] Apostles and these men these apostles
[1:28:13] were taking to
[1:28:16] Paul preaching the kingdom of
[1:28:20] God and Paul feeding them
[1:28:23] with
[1:28:25] Revelation from the
[1:28:29] Epistles you would take to Timothy you
[1:28:32] take these to
[1:28:40] Leia and to other Apostles he would say
[1:28:43] take this to the the brothers in
[1:28:45] Ephesus and like
[1:28:48] that and during this
[1:28:51] time
[1:28:53] in the days of
[1:28:58] Pentecost it was a great move at that
[1:29:01] time it was a grand a great
[1:29:08] Revival said that a th 3,000 Souls were
[1:29:11] added to the kingdom of
[1:29:14] God and at the same time there was a
[1:29:17] great persecution in
[1:29:20] Jerusalem
[1:29:22] a violence that came to the people of
[1:29:26] God through the midst of um the Orthodox
[1:29:33] Jews and also through the Rome the
[1:29:36] pagans in
[1:29:38] Rome everything was
[1:29:41] against the brothers in
[1:29:44] Jerusalem they couldn't look they
[1:29:45] couldn't find
[1:29:48] work nobody would give them
[1:29:50] work because they were followers of
[1:29:56] Jesus persecution and the violence was
[1:29:59] great the Bible doesn't
[1:30:04] say say that the people at that time
[1:30:06] were
[1:30:09] Rich recognizing the great need at that
[1:30:15] time they had resources to help to
[1:30:20] help
[1:30:23] they began to sell their own
[1:30:27] properties bring the money to the feet
[1:30:30] of the
[1:30:34] Apostles so they could divide everything
[1:30:37] that was needed for the the brothers
[1:30:41] there and with that said the
[1:30:46] tithes they not they don't all belong to
[1:30:50] to the apostle
[1:30:54] that's not
[1:30:56] scriptural that's not the
[1:31:00] truth if it's a
[1:31:03] portion if he receives a portion correct
[1:31:07] that's
[1:31:12] correct but now today how it's
[1:31:15] established the the the uh church is
[1:31:17] established
[1:31:20] today the ties come into the house of
[1:31:24] God the pastor receives
[1:31:29] them and he should be filled with the
[1:31:32] Holy
[1:31:34] Spirit how to divide
[1:31:36] them these
[1:31:39] tithes to the ministry or the work of
[1:31:43] God stewards just
[1:31:50] stewards ones that can Bless the people
[1:31:52] of God with the word of
[1:31:55] God word of God Apostolic word Apostolic
[1:31:59] word evangelist Evangelistic word
[1:32:02] Evangelistic
[1:32:05] word prophetic
[1:32:10] word um teaching word teaching
[1:32:13] word Pastor the
[1:32:18] pastor it is the responsible of the
[1:32:21] pastor in this
[1:32:22] day to
[1:32:25] justly to divide those
[1:32:30] ties to bring the fivefold
[1:32:33] ministry so it'll be a blessing to the
[1:32:40] people that we can be a people that are
[1:32:42] free in the Lord Jesus
[1:32:47] Christ it it's up to you it pertains to
[1:32:50] you
[1:32:53] bring your TI and
[1:32:54] offerings with the
[1:32:56] attitude
[1:32:59] Lord I bring this to
[1:33:04] you if if you are doubting of the just
[1:33:07] Steward in the
[1:33:09] Pulpit you need to find another one or
[1:33:12] search for another
[1:33:18] one if you believe that the pastor or
[1:33:20] another man is not
[1:33:24] just need you should look for one that
[1:33:28] is that his attitude is your attitude
[1:33:36] is that your attitude is I bring my
[1:33:39] tithes to you no
[1:33:42] no attitude is our attitude
[1:33:47] is not that I bring my Tidings or we
[1:33:50] bring our tidings to the
[1:33:54] pastor that I bring we bring our
[1:33:57] Tidings to the
[1:33:58] Lord to the Lord Jesus
[1:34:03] Christ and with that
[1:34:05] attitude you are
[1:34:08] just through
[1:34:12] Revelation and you never have to
[1:34:16] worry if you did it if you were right or
[1:34:20] wrong you don't have to
[1:34:23] worry if the
[1:34:25] pastor if he's using it right or wrong
[1:34:29] if he does it
[1:34:31] wrong he is required
[1:34:34] himself he's enriching himself if he's
[1:34:37] enriching
[1:34:40] himself he will have to answer in the
[1:34:42] day of
[1:34:47] judgment he'll have to be thrown into
[1:34:49] the Lake of Fire
[1:34:52] now you're not responsible for that
[1:34:54] you're not you're not guilty of
[1:34:57] that your responsibility of
[1:35:00] love it's
[1:35:03] only to take have that
[1:35:05] Revelation I give my tithes and my
[1:35:09] offerings I bring it to the house of
[1:35:12] God but Lord I give it to
[1:35:15] you and the the pastor the
[1:35:18] man
[1:35:20] and
[1:35:23] Lord give him
[1:35:25] Revelation how he's going to use that
[1:35:28] money for the glory of
[1:35:30] God for the blessings of
[1:35:34] the for the edification for the
[1:35:36] edification of the
[1:35:40] people
[1:35:48] continue chap uh Hebrews chapter 7 ver4
[1:35:59] for it is evident that our Lord sprang
[1:36:01] out of Judah of which tribe Moses spake
[1:36:03] nothing concerning
[1:36:07] priesthood and this is yet far more
[1:36:13] evident for that after the similitude of
[1:36:16] MDC there arises another
[1:36:20] priest
[1:36:24] and who is made not after the law of
[1:36:26] carnal
[1:36:27] commandment in other
[1:36:31] words God today is not lifting up a
[1:36:38] Ministry because your father is a
[1:36:41] minister because your father is a
[1:36:44] prophet because your father is an
[1:36:47] evangelist that doesn't qualify
[1:36:50] you
[1:36:52] or does it allow you to preach the
[1:36:54] gospel no no it
[1:36:58] doesn't changing the
[1:37:03] priesthood it's necessity there be a
[1:37:06] change of the
[1:37:11] law you no longer come to I'm sorry say
[1:37:14] that one more
[1:37:19] time you know Minister doesn't come
[1:37:22] because he pertains to the law of to a
[1:37:24] certain tribe of a certain
[1:37:30] tribe
[1:37:42] verse who is made not after the law of
[1:37:44] the Cardinal commandment but after the
[1:37:46] power of an endless
[1:37:50] life for he
[1:37:54] testifieth thou art a priest
[1:37:58] Forever After the order of
[1:38:03] mzc now the minister
[1:38:07] is if the minister is
[1:38:10] not in this order of
[1:38:13] mzc then you're not a priest in in this
[1:38:19] order Verse 18
[1:38:27] for there is verily a disannulling of
[1:38:28] the Commandment going before the
[1:38:30] weakness and unprofitableness
[1:38:33] thereof the the weakness was
[1:38:36] this that under the
[1:38:39] law that nobody could be perfect under
[1:38:42] the
[1:38:43] law NE the lay
[1:38:45] member or the
[1:38:48] minister person or the old person under
[1:38:52] the
[1:38:56] law verse
[1:39:03] 19 for the law made nothing
[1:39:10] perfect but the bringing out of a better
[1:39:13] hope did by the which we draw nigh unto
[1:39:18] God and as much not without an
[1:39:26] oath as an oath he was made verse 21 for
[1:39:29] those priests were made without an oath
[1:39:31] but this was an oath by him that said
[1:39:33] unto
[1:39:46] him the Lord swear and will not repent
[1:39:49] thou art a priest Forever After the
[1:39:51] order of mzc verse 21 verse 21 for those
[1:39:55] priests were made without an oath but
[1:39:57] this was an oath by him and said unto
[1:39:59] him the Lord swear and will not repent
[1:40:01] thou are a priest Forever After the
[1:40:03] order of
[1:40:05] mzc
[1:40:11] 22 by so much was Jesus made a shity of
[1:40:15] a better
[1:40:17] Testament and that's the P or The
[1:40:19] Testament that we're in
[1:40:23] and that's the Testament that we're in
[1:40:26] now it's the Testament of
[1:40:29] life it's the Lamb's Book of that's the
[1:40:33] the P The
[1:40:34] Testament verse
[1:40:39] 23 and they truly were many
[1:40:45] priests because they were not suffered
[1:40:47] to continue by reason of
[1:40:49] death
[1:40:53] but this man because he continueth
[1:40:56] ever have an unchangeable
[1:41:01] priesthood and under this ministry
[1:41:05] unchangeable there's a
[1:41:08] commandment those that receive
[1:41:10] ties pay
[1:41:13] ties not just the the lay
[1:41:16] member but also the
[1:41:19] ministry under this
[1:41:25] priesthood in this under this fivefold
[1:41:30] ministry to say I'm a
[1:41:33] minister and I don't have to pay
[1:41:35] TI that's not
[1:41:39] scriptural to say I'm the
[1:41:44] pastor that all to to say that I'm a
[1:41:47] pastor and I say that all the ties
[1:41:49] belong to me period
[1:41:51] that's not
[1:41:56] scriptural but I have a quote from some
[1:41:59] say I have a quote from the from the
[1:42:01] prophet and I
[1:42:03] have and I have many
[1:42:08] quotes like the devil said unto Jesus on
[1:42:11] the Mount of Temptation
[1:42:14] Temptation if you're the Son of
[1:42:18] God make turn these uh the stones into
[1:42:23] bread you know that that was a
[1:42:26] scripture in the Book of
[1:42:29] Psalms that was a
[1:42:31] prophecy and what did Jesus
[1:42:35] say when he gave him one scripture the
[1:42:38] the
[1:42:39] devil and he put a period
[1:42:42] there he
[1:42:44] said if you
[1:42:46] say that you
[1:42:49] are
[1:42:52] do what the scripture says
[1:42:56] here Jesus
[1:43:01] said said better that I I understand the
[1:43:04] the scripture than the
[1:43:07] devil and he
[1:43:11] said he said also it is
[1:43:14] written it is also
[1:43:17] written not only by Bread will the Man
[1:43:20] live
[1:43:22] William Bram brother Bram he
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:28] said I pastored a church for 17
[1:43:31] years and you know
[1:43:36] what he said I never received a salary
[1:43:38] through all that
[1:43:41] time because he was a St a just
[1:43:45] Steward he
[1:43:47] knew he knew it was a a people that were
[1:43:53] poor and he he knew that if he took all
[1:43:56] the money that was coming in for his his
[1:43:58] own
[1:43:59] life there would be no
[1:44:02] church where would the brothers be able
[1:44:04] to to
[1:44:08] gather he was he lived just he made he
[1:44:12] did righteousness he did
[1:44:16] righteously because he was a
[1:44:19] man he was uh filled with the holy
[1:44:24] spirit because he was a just
[1:44:27] Steward righteous Steward so Len because
[1:44:31] they they say William BR William Bram
[1:44:35] they say William Bram
[1:44:38] said they say that William brandham said
[1:44:41] the the ties belong to the
[1:44:43] pastor and they throw
[1:44:46] out the whole Bible
[1:44:49] out uh filled with shadows and
[1:44:54] types so that we can see our the truth
[1:44:57] in this
[1:45:00] day they don't want to speak of the
[1:45:06] Prophet they don't say anything about
[1:45:09] when brother Braham said I never
[1:45:10] received a
[1:45:11] salary for 17
[1:45:19] years theh
[1:45:21] the prophet
[1:45:23] said I tried at one
[1:45:28] time to give 90% of my
[1:45:33] income and that didn't work very well
[1:45:35] for
[1:45:38] me and then I began to give
[1:45:43] 10% and then I had I had
[1:45:49] problems at the end of at at the end of
[1:45:51] it all as a
[1:45:53] minister and now I

[1:47:42] this and this man of
[1:47:45] God he didn't need
[1:47:48] money he only needed to um commit his

[1:56:50] you see
[1:56:52] how you see how this subject is very
[1:57:01] big in all of our
[1:57:05] Lives now to
[1:57:09] finish Matthew chapter
[1:57:14] 10
[1:57:18] Matthew
[1:57:22] Matthew 10 verse
[1:57:26] 5 Lord Jesus was um uh sending out his
[1:57:32] disciples and it
[1:57:38] says these these 12 Jesus sent forth and
[1:57:40] commanded them saying
[1:57:44] inst it was not only going to be for the
[1:57:48] 12 for every every
[1:57:51] man under this new
[1:57:53] test under this new
[1:57:57] testament every man that finds himself
[1:57:59] as the head of the
[1:58:02] home every man that is the head of the
[1:58:06] church instructions for
[1:58:11] everybody these 12 Jesus sent forth and
[1:58:13] commanded
[1:58:17] saying go not in the way of the G
[1:58:22] and and into any city of the samarit
[1:58:25] Samaritans enter you
[1:58:27] not it's because when Jesus came in his
[1:58:30] first
[1:58:32] coming he came like the the king of the
[1:58:37] Jews and he only he came as the king of
[1:58:40] the
[1:58:41] Jews to fulfill
[1:58:43] prophecy to the
[1:58:46] firstborn it was given to him
[1:58:51] por of the Lion's tribe of the the
[1:58:54] Lion's portion the Lion's portion of
[1:58:56] inheritance of
[1:58:58] inheritance and and so
[1:59:01] Jesus was in his
[1:59:04] ministry like King of the
[1:59:07] Jews Like The Lion of the tribe of
[1:59:13] Judah this book the Lamb's Book of
[1:59:16] Life it had to be presented
[1:59:20] to the
[1:59:22] firstborn if not it breaks every
[1:59:25] scripture break every shadow and
[1:59:30] type and also the Shadow and
[1:59:34] types it was
[1:59:36] written in
[1:59:38] allegories in this
[1:59:41] day that the firstborn was going to re
[1:59:44] reject on the cross of
[1:59:48] calvary the son the younger
[1:59:54] son he was going to receive all the
[1:59:56] inheritance of the
[1:59:58] father you know the type in the
[2:00:00] shadow in
[2:00:03] Genesis and when um Joseph took both of
[2:00:07] his sons Ephraim Manasses Ephraim and
[2:00:13] Manasses and Jacob a prophet of God his
[2:00:16] father he was already blind
[2:00:20] close to
[2:00:25] dying and Joseph wanted the the um
[2:00:28] tradition to be
[2:00:30] fulfilled BR son to his father his
[2:00:33] Prophet that he would bless them like it
[2:00:36] was
[2:00:37] written like it is the C like it was the
[2:00:40] tradition of
[2:00:41] them and he brings a
[2:00:45] firstborn to the right of his
[2:00:48] father
[2:00:50] and the younger to his
[2:00:52] left it was proper it was
[2:00:57] correct but
[2:01:00] then the Holy Spirit comes
[2:01:04] down and when Jacob goes to put his
[2:01:07] hands on
[2:01:08] them he crosses his
[2:01:11] his and he
[2:01:14] gives the great
[2:01:16] inheritance the to the younger
[2:01:21] and the great blessing the great
[2:01:23] blessing to his
[2:01:26] younger and and Joseph
[2:01:29] recognized no
[2:01:33] father I put him right correctly one to
[2:01:36] the right and one to the
[2:01:38] left and Jacob said no no
[2:01:43] Joseph God has crossed my
[2:01:45] hands
[2:01:48] signifying in this beautiful
[2:01:53] allegory that one
[2:01:57] day the one day the lion the tribe of
[2:02:02] Judah and he was going to bring all of
[2:02:04] the inheritance to the
[2:02:06] firstborn the chur of the Jewish Church
[2:02:10] the
[2:02:13] Israel that when when they
[2:02:16] reject on the cross of calvary
[2:02:19] this
[2:02:21] inheritance this Lamb's Book of
[2:02:24] Life everything that God had for
[2:02:28] them it was going to be given to us a
[2:02:32] gentile
[2:02:34] people and the Book of
[2:02:38] Matthew it's unfolding this
[2:02:42] allegory and Jesus is is showing or
[2:02:45] sending out his 12
[2:02:47] disciples
[2:02:52] these 12 Jesus sent forth commanded them
[2:02:58] saying go not into the way of the
[2:03:00] Gentiles and into any city of the
[2:03:02] Samaritans enter you
[2:03:07] not but go rather to the lost sheep of
[2:03:10] the House of
[2:03:14] Israel but the king of the Jews it's
[2:03:18] verse five Matthew
[2:03:23] 5 that the king came only to the
[2:03:32] Jews the king of the Jews the king of
[2:03:34] the
[2:03:35] Jews only came to the
[2:03:37] Jews the firstborn
[2:03:42] son who he belonged to from the
[2:03:47] father he gave un to them the Lamb's
[2:03:49] Book of
[2:03:50] Life but they rejected it verse
[2:03:58] six but go rather to the lost sheep of
[2:04:00] the House of
[2:04:03] Israel not every sheep was
[2:04:07] lost not every human
[2:04:10] being was seed of
[2:04:17] God
[2:04:20] and as you go preach saying the Kingdom
[2:04:22] of Heaven is at
[2:04:23] hand and then he
[2:04:26] says heal the
[2:04:28] sick he gave them a gift of of
[2:04:32] healing cleanse the
[2:04:34] lepers raise the
[2:04:36] Dead cast out
[2:04:39] Devils freely you have
[2:04:41] received freely
[2:04:45] give this same
[2:04:47] Ministry
[2:04:50] that unfolded in the first uh
[2:04:52] coming it
[2:04:54] repeated to
[2:04:56] confirm to to confirm his second
[2:04:59] coming in this 20th century verse
[2:05:04] n he says to his
[2:05:07] Apostles under this new testament not no
[2:05:10] longer under the
[2:05:14] law to these ministers under the New
[2:05:17] Testament he says in verse
[2:05:21] n provide neither gold nor silver nor
[2:05:26] brass in your
[2:05:29] purses when you

[2:05:56] staves for the Workman is
[2:05:59] worthy of his
[2:06:05] meat Paul
[2:06:07] said to the
[2:06:10] Corinthians in First Corinthians chapter
[2:06:16] 4 1 Corinthians 4 4 verse
[2:06:21] 10 he
[2:06:25] says he says we are fools for Christ's
[2:06:30] sake but you are wise in
[2:06:32] Christ we are
[2:06:34] weak but you are
[2:06:37] strong you are
[2:06:39] honorable but we are
[2:06:44] despised now Paul saw the
[2:06:47] burden
[2:06:49] burden of this
[2:06:51] ministry he had complexes
[2:06:57] building even unto this present hour we

[2:07:38] Steward for the things through the
[2:07:40] things that happened to
[2:07:45] him it is also required of stewards
[2:07:50] of the fivefold
