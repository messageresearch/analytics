[Music] tonight it's good to be back it's good to be back in the main sanctuary and uh they've been having problems as brother Kenny mentioned with the air conditioning of course you can feel that uh and they told us it's going to be yet several more weeks so we'll have to be in contact with the property owner to see what the what the long delay has been here but Lord willing we will have service here on Sunday and uh We've lined up to have some uh portable portable air conditioner and we'll probably set it up in one of the back Corners over here and it should be enough to cool the building for us because it's it appears to be it's going to be a longer delay yet and we can continue having the our services now in the main sanctuary uh some of the brothers that listen online have been calling so we wanted to get back into the building here to be able to broadcast the services uh and uh let the folks uh the brothers that listen in be able to be blessed also uh we we we we we were speaking on uh the three steps of Grace and uh we want to continue on on that same subject and tonight it's a it's a message we've shared with the church before but it's a continuation of what we spoke on on Sunday and entitled it Perfection through a restored friendship and and and the subject is adoption adoption the process and Perfection is the Capstone and God has made it all possible through the blood of Jesus if you'll stand with me to your feet this evening and we'll be reading from Psalms 51 verses 1- 10 Psalms 51 and verse one it says have mercy upon me oh God according according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies Blood Out My transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin if you remember this Psalm that that David that David wrote it's when Nathan the prophet had come to him after he had gone and taken the wife of of Uriah a great mighty man in his army and he actually planned his murder he had planned his murder uh so because he had already committed adultery with the man's wife and this is David crying out to God after Nathan went to him and the prophet and called out his sins he said Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity verse two and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did not did my mother conceive me that's each and every one of us that's how we came into this world we were shaped in iniquity and in sin did our mother conceive us because what happened in the garden was the curse That Came Upon This human race it's the way we're born that's the problem God wanted us to come by the spoken word he wanted Adam Adam and Eve to bring a forth the family of God according to the pattern he set and the pattern he said was he took 16 elements from the ground and from the clay he made a man and then he called the life of that man Adam that Spirit man to come into that body he made and then he said then the word say and Man became a living Soul it was it was now man living in a flesh body verse six says behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Purge me with hisop hisop was a common plant you could find it anywhere in those in those areas they even used it to put the blood of the Lamb on on on on on on the on the door of the homes of the Israelites there there there in Egypt they use hop a common plant to apply blood of the Lamb on the on on on their doors so that when the death angel would walk would come through through the land they would see the blood innocent lamb it would see that you've been OB you've been obedient to God's word and death would pass it it wouldn't strike your home it wouldn't strike your family your firstborn son or daughter could live and it was a simple process David said Purge me with hisop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness and the and that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities and is you know what iniquities are it's when you know the right thing to do and yet you didn't do the right thing that's iniquity David said hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities verse n then he said create in me a clean heart knew he didn't have a clean heart he had a heart that was vexed and corrupt he said oh God and renew a right Spirit within me because he knew his Spirit had been polluted in other words without even no understanding he was asking to be born again though he didn't know about a new birth but he knew he needed something that he didn't have at the time we now know what that something is that the heart cries for and that's a born again experience let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again tonight and may your Holy Spirit help us to concentrate on your word bless us now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated in Matthew chapter 5 the scripture we' shared with you often because it's it's an important scripture as really is every scripture because the Bible all ties together there is no there is no scripture in the Bible that stands alone no this book all every word it's designed to be read line upon line here a little there a little and that's how the word is designed to be read not to take just one thing one scripture and put a period on it but but but to put a comma because God will add more to that a prophet said that the end time messenger was going to bring all the loose ends together that means he was going to tie scripture with scripture the book The Bible is a complete book so what's what's lacking for this book is we us having revelation of this word of God in Matthew 548 Jesus he was speaking in a parable because in Parables is how he always spoke it was the prophecy of the Old Testament and Matthew brought that test that that prophecy back to us there in Matthew 13 so Matthew 5:48 is is is a statement that Jesus made be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect it sounds like it's a one-time statement it sounds like it's a a an only statement but but it's but it's really a closing statement and it was closing off a thought that Jesus had he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and the first thing that most people will respond now you know that we can't be perfect and yet a prophet said if Jesus said it then he's got to make a way for us to get there it was a conclusion to what he was speaking on so when it says be ye therefore there's a reason to be perfect and the reason was the other 47 verses that Jesus was speaking on it was in those 47 verses that he that he unfolded a plan and at the end of these 47 verses in the mind of God he says I've told you enough that you can aspire to be perfect even as perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect because of the 47 verses of teaching that I've brought to you so what was his teaching on on the first 47 verses Perfection the statement told us it was a closing statement 47 verses was Jesus Christ preaching on how we could arrive at Perfection do you remember how the teaching started blessed are the poor in spirit remember what the psalmist David told us hide thy face from my sins blot out all my iniquities and create in me a clean heart that's what the 47 verses were about oh God and renew a right spirit in me that's what the 47 verses were about that's why when Jesus got to the 48th verse he was able to tell you with confidence You Walk This Way follow my plan and you'll be perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect the conclusion of perfection was speaking of a restored friendship with the [Music] father in Hebrews chapter 6 and verse one the Apostle Paul said this therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead Works in other words we're no longer under the law then he says not laying again the foundation of of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God the word perfect just from the dictionary it means it means to to make something complete to bring something to an end uh or to add to what is yet wanting in order to to render a full thing to bring to an end like a goal that you have and the last one says to bring to a close or F or fulfillment by event the Prophecies of the scriptures perfection is really only found in the word of God and what the word can do for you in this exposition of the seven Church ages brother brandom said this statement tribulation worketh patience that's a how highly regards how highly God regards this outworking of our patience is seen in James 1:4 it says but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire lacking nothing then he says God's will for us is perfection because that's what Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is is in heaven is perfect then a prophet tells us and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development so for so Perfection has a process and the Lord Jesus was the first to ever bring us bring us a teaching of all the components that take us to Perfection and the process is called the adoption of Sons and Daughters of God but there's a process to even to arrive to our adoption it's called the three steps of Grace if you'll turn with me to Galatians chapter 4 and verse 5 Galatians 4 and verse 5 the Apostle Paul says to the Galatians to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA Father which means my father my father like when Jesus cried on the cross of Calvary verse S says wherefore Thou Art no more a servant you see the relationship changes when you're born again when you're repent when you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the relationship changes you're no longer a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ a friendship with the father has been renewed the same kind of friendship that Adam had with the father in the beginning and God was taking him unto Perfection to be just like the father a son who knew how to use the spoken word The Original Seed by faith in his heart Ephesians chapter 1 and verse four the Apostle Paul speaking toian Church Paul founded this Ephesian Church Paul was the pastor of this Ephesian church until he passed away and verse four of Ephesians 1 says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world how could he choose us before the foundation of the world because he's God he knew all things and because he knew all things the Bible tells us that he slew the lamb before the foundation of the world he that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will in Romans 8 and verse 15 Paul speaking to the Romans he says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear when you give your heart to the Lord Jesus when you're baptized in his name then he takes away all fear and he tells you now that you've done this made this decision and it's the right decision he says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear no not when you've re not when you've surrendered your life to Jesus Christ but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father when do you receive this Spirit of adoption when you make a decision and you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you have nothing to fear anymore because the Holy Spirit has come to your house this house this house made of Flesh Galatians 5 and 19 Paul is going to tell us the things that we should look to and by these we'll know if if a person has given their life to the Lord Jesus or if they're just church members still living in sin hav't surrendered their lives now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these and we see them in unbelievers and we see it and make Believers and we see it in church members but the man in the woman that surrendered their life you won't see these attributes in their lives but the church member you will you mean even in the message brother Daniel Oh Yeah from the Catholic Church to this message movement if you haven't been born again these are the attributes that you will manifest it takes a humility surrendering like our little brother Eli did he surrendered his life he's free tonight like you and I now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication cleanness lusious idolatry witchcraft hatred variance demolitions wrath Strife seditions heresies envs murders drunkenness reings and such like of which I tell you before as I have also told you in the past ask that they that do these things shall not enter into the kingdom of God you see unless you be born again you cannot see this kingdom of God you cannot you have not entered into this kingdom of God you might be in a church but you're not in Christ no no I'm in a message Church no no but you're not in Christ until you've been born again but when you're in Christ here's the fruit of that Holy Spirit but the fruit of the spirit is love joy long peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are in Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust Paul is saying those that are in Christ The Works of the flesh don't manifest through them they they're not adulterers they don't live in for they don't live in uncleanness no for they that are are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust verse 24 and if we live in the spirit that's the Unseen realm that's what God is doing on the inside of for if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit in other words the inward work that Christ is doing in your life it will show on the outside the Holy Spirit on the inside will be declared because people will see your life they'll say you live different there's something about you you're not like the other people that work here no you're not cuz you've been born again before we come to this relationship as sons being adopted this relationship of adoption there are three steps to arrive to be sons and daughters being adopted with this incredible restored friendship with the father these three steps is justification by faith it's sanctification by the spirit it makes us dress different it makes us talk different it makes us walk different it makes a husband treat his wife differently it makes his wife the wife treat the husband differently it makes the husband even if the wife ain't acting so good that day it causes the husband to still treat her right because that's the power of the Holy Ghost justification by faith sanctification by the spirit the great Holy Spirit can change you so your own mother wouldn't even recognize you she say you ain't the same boy Something's Happened to you and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire these three bring us to a restored friendship with the father called adoption unto perfection in Hebrews chapter 7 Paul told the Hebrews listen close in verse 18 for there is verely a disannulling of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof in other words Paul's saying you remember those Ten Commandments that no one could live you know why no one could live them because of the weakness of our flesh as human beings in verse 19 he tells us for the law for the law made nothing perfect those 10 commandments didn't bring Perfection they weren't designed to bring Perfection they were designed to let you know that what you did is wrong but they couldn't stop you from doing it they couldn't help you to live a better life no no it was a proverb of what you shouldn't do but how can you stop doing what your flesh is pulling you to do for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God so yes Paul was speaking of all Ten Commandments and he and Jesus in his Parable on adoption and Perfection also mentions them there in chapter five of Matthew and tells us how they're being disowned here is the admonition of God I just mentioned that we'll be turning to 13 and here's the admonition of God when he was opening the book that Adam lost and telling us things that had been hid since the foundation of the world Matthew 34 we might have read it last Sunday we'll read it again Matthew 13:34 all these things spoke Jesus unto the multitude and Parables and without a parable spoke he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world then Jesus sent the multitudes away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field in parables in the style of ministry that Jesus spoke no one understood him that was the reason God chose to do it that way so we could hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent so we can hide it from from the seed of the serpent so he can hide it from the Devil Himself and just reveal it to his children Jesus said Jesus said reveal it unto babes such as would learn he wasn't talking about babies natural he was talking about babies Supernatural children who had been born again Sons and Daughters of God and the disciples said when Jesus sent the multitude away he they said declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field in other words we need a revelation and Jesus answered them and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man for the first time since he spoke it to Adam once again again the Holy Spirit lip to ear Adam's Fallen race you and I God is speaking to our hearts and opening his word to us and this is what Adam heard that day in Eden just before the fall you are privileged tonight to hear it but you're more privileged to understand when it was first spoken what I'm going to read you now was first spoken to Adam back in Eden and it says this the words of Jesus be ye therefore perfect verse 48 Matthew 5:48 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect the first time it was spoken was in the Garden of Eden the first one that ever heard it was Adam and tonight you're hearing it you've heard it before you've read it before but you never but you thought it was something new you thought it was a new testament saying none of it's new this was all in the mind of God before the foundation of the world if it's thus saith the Lord if it's the spoken word if if God said it then it was in his mind in his plan wait back and eeden even before Adam but he spoke it to Adam said Adam be ye therefore perfect as I am he said it was first spoken to Adam but Adam didn't keep it but tonight God has confidence in you to share it with you to Open the Eyes of your understanding so you can see the Promise he has for you so the answer to the devil's question can we be perfect the answer is yes can we will be because Perfection is the Capstone of these three steps of Grace perfection the Capstone Perfection is the Capstone of this Born Again experience be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect what is this Perfection how is the P the the father perfect he's an eternal being remember how Jesus started his teaching on Perfection how did it begin blessed blessed are the poor in spirit that's where perfection begins if you're a seed of God if you're a son and daughter of God Perfection starts in this Fallen condition in this in this old past house God made you a promise he's going to change you if you surrender your life he'll bring bring it to Perfection if you won't surrender your life then you and I will die in our sin but if we surrender we repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ The Promise is you will be perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect we put a common and God allow us
