[56:53] this morning we wanna
[56:58] and we've been speaking on the white
[57:01] horse rider um
[57:09] and it isn't just one Elijah says only
[57:14] yes but it was too Elijah
[57:17] and the white horse rider wrote the
[57:19] first coming of Christ
[57:25] and The Pale Horse Rider riding at the
[57:28] second coming of Christ
[57:31] I'm not a different personally
[57:36] I'm trying trying to upset the plan of
[57:42] God's wanting to give his children life
[57:46] and Satan is wanting to bring death is
[57:49] done it since the beginning
[57:52] God wanted to give Adam and Eve
[57:56] the spoken words
[57:59] teach them how to use it
[58:01] to bring forth life
[58:04] and satanas same with his plan being a
[58:08] conso plan and he gave them a lie
[58:11] and and you've believed the lies and the
[58:14] LIE always brings death
[58:16] it brings chaos it brings destruction
[58:21] divides the family
[58:23] that's what happened at the beginning
[58:25] it's what's happening even today
[58:28] it's what's happening throughout the
[58:30] ages
[58:32] but God hasn't changed his mind about
[58:34] his words
[58:37] he is still the tree of life
[58:39] and Satan hasn't yeah
[59:36] entitling it this morning
[59:45] respuestas
[59:53] but and today we have the answers to
[59:56] many questions
[59:59] many questions that throughout the ages
[1:00:05] some questions for over 2 000 years that
[1:00:09] people had
[1:00:13] the same questions and today we have the
[1:00:17] answers
[1:00:19] by the grace of God second Peter 1.
[1:00:28] second Peter chapter one and verse begin
[1:00:32] at verse 19.
[1:00:40] though he was an uneducated man
[1:00:44] who couldn't even write his own name
[1:00:48] as God brought to him more Revelation
[1:00:52] Revelation he increased an understanding
[1:00:57] to the place where he brought us great
[1:00:59] truths
[1:01:04] by Revelation does it sound like another
[1:01:07] man in this day
[1:01:09] a man with
[1:01:11] numbers
[1:01:15] not only did he have a better command of
[1:01:17] the English language
[1:01:21] in English
[1:01:23] but of Revelation
[1:01:27] had increased tremendous
[1:01:31] from 1946.
[1:01:33] in 1965.
[1:01:37] God kept giving him word upon words
[1:01:43] here a little in this message
[1:01:51] to hide it from the eyes of the wise and
[1:01:53] Prudence
[1:01:55] who would get bored with with this
[1:01:58] little Kentucky
[1:02:01] and right about the time they closed
[1:02:03] that message
[1:02:05] when the Holy Spirit would drop
[1:02:07] something down in the mouth of a prophet
[1:02:09] is
[1:02:20] God give us Revelation
[1:02:23] and a Victorious life
[1:02:25] through Jesus Christ so Christian Peter
[1:02:29] chapter 1 verse 19.
[1:02:33] we have also a more sure word of
[1:02:36] Prophecy we're unto ye do well that you
[1:02:40] take heed as unto a light that shineth
[1:02:43] in a dark place until the day Dawn and
[1:02:45] the day star arise in your hearts
[1:02:59] knowing this first that no Prophecy of
[1:03:03] the scripture is of any private
[1:03:05] interpretation
[1:03:08] foreign
[1:03:14] by the will of man
[1:03:16] but holy men of God spake as they were
[1:03:20] moved by the Holy Ghost foreign
[1:03:37] and beginning at verse 8.
[1:03:41] Galatians
[1:03:45] but though we were an angel from heaven
[1:03:48] reach any other gospel unto you than
[1:03:51] that which we have preached unto you let
[1:03:53] him be accursed
[1:04:02] as we have said before so say I now
[1:04:05] again if any man preach any other gospel
[1:04:08] unto you that ye have received let him
[1:04:12] be a curse
[1:04:19] or do I now persuade man or God or do I
[1:04:24] seek to please men forever yet please
[1:04:27] man I should not be the servant of
[1:04:30] Christ foreign
[1:04:39] but I certify you Brethren that the
[1:04:42] gospel which was preached of me is not
[1:04:45] after man
[1:04:50] Brian either received it of man neither
[1:04:54] was I taught it but by the revelation of
[1:04:57] Jesus Christ
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:01] it's the only way it comes to you it's
[1:05:05] God's provided
[1:05:07] Beyond this rock I'll build my church
[1:05:13] it's Revelation just to the minister no
[1:05:18] to the believer to grandpas
[1:05:22] to young children to young and old men
[1:05:26] and women alive
[1:05:33] for ye have heard of my conversation and
[1:05:36] time past in the Jews religion how that
[1:05:39] beyond measure I persecuted the Church
[1:05:42] of God and wasted it yes
[1:05:50] and profited in the Jews religion
[1:05:55] foreign
[1:06:26] I persecuted the Church of God and
[1:06:29] wasted it and profited in the Jews
[1:06:31] religion above many my equals in my own
[1:06:34] Nation being more exceedingly zealous of
[1:06:37] the traditions of my father Yes
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:54] who separated me
[1:06:57] when I was uh who separated me when on
[1:07:01] the road to Damascus
[1:07:04] no who separated me from my mother's
[1:07:07] womb
[1:07:08] and called me by his grace
[1:07:11] for one purpose and it's the purpose why
[1:07:15] he's called you yes
[1:07:49] to them which was Apostles before me
[1:07:53] Jerusalem
[1:07:56] because the apostles couldn't give him a
[1:08:00] revelation
[1:08:01] they could share their Revelations
[1:08:07] so he said I'll just skip that step
[1:08:10] then I'll go straight to the author
[1:08:15] but I went into Arabia and returned
[1:08:18] again unto Damascus
[1:08:21] then he says then after three years I
[1:08:25] went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and
[1:08:28] Abode with him 15 days
[1:08:34] then we all went on to say hello
[1:08:37] I had a good time of fellowship
[1:08:40] and some of the other Apostles
[1:08:43] including James the Lord's own brother
[1:08:47] but they didn't add anything
[1:08:51] more
[1:08:52] to my Revelation than what God had
[1:08:56] already
[1:08:58] it turned out that when we talked for
[1:09:01] the first time
[1:09:03] we had something in common that we had
[1:09:06] all been in a conversation with the Lord
[1:09:09] himself
[1:09:11] we realized we all had the same
[1:09:13] Revelations
[1:09:15] though we had never spoken
[1:09:18] because we were speaking to the absolute
[1:09:22] the author of the same books
[1:09:30] and we're speaking today
[1:09:33] questions
[1:09:41] May questions in our hearts truly be
[1:09:44] answered this morning
[1:09:59] you may be seated
[1:10:05] we'd like to do this morning
[1:10:08] we've done it once before
[1:10:11] I just have taken quotes of the Prophet
[1:10:14] but the universe
[1:10:17] and they're all on you could say
[1:10:21] different subjects
[1:10:23] different texts
[1:10:26] and even though it's all connected uh
[1:10:31] when you speak of justification
[1:10:34] and then you speak on Perfection
[1:10:37] they are absolutely linked together
[1:10:42] yeah even though you can speak of them
[1:10:45] individually
[1:10:47] but the greater truth
[1:10:50] always to connect these truths
[1:10:53] that's Revelations when you can see the
[1:10:57] bigger picture
[1:10:58] so we're going to start with a few
[1:11:00] quotes
[1:11:01] things that a prophet said
[1:11:04] speak a little bit on it and then go on
[1:11:08] to another quote
[1:11:10] can in can the message
[1:11:13] in the message God revealing himself to
[1:11:16] his people
[1:11:18] preached in 1950s Joshua
[1:11:25] and
[1:11:29] and it's it's an experience that he had
[1:11:31] yes
[1:11:34] when God called them to the ministry
[1:11:37] he says in an old traptor's cabin
[1:11:42] and I she said I seen the fear of a man
[1:11:45] walking in through a light
[1:11:50] you see me
[1:11:53] and beginning at verse paragraph 24 in
[1:11:56] that message
[1:11:57] he says now the night when it taken
[1:12:00] place when he called me to this ministry
[1:12:05] the year was 1946.
[1:12:09] I was sitting in the room being in
[1:12:11] prayer
[1:12:13] I've been praying all night burdened
[1:12:16] I got up I'd walk around the room again
[1:12:21] and I was a pretty successful Baptist
[1:12:25] preacher
[1:12:27] as Paul was a very successful Pharisee
[1:12:31] um
[1:12:32] that was a pretty successful Baptist
[1:12:34] priest
[1:12:35] I had audiences
[1:12:38] sometimes three thousand
[1:12:40] and had revivals thousands were saved at
[1:12:44] one time
[1:12:45] the early part of his ministry
[1:12:48] he was still claiming to be a Baptist
[1:12:51] I was sitting there can I seen a light
[1:12:54] flicker in the room
[1:13:02] I thought well where where I thought
[1:13:05] well here where I was going to pray and
[1:13:08] weigh in them Hills I know that no one
[1:13:11] was coming in there with a car I thought
[1:13:13] well where was that
[1:13:16] is
[1:13:22] I looked and here it was right up here
[1:13:25] above me
[1:13:28] was the same thing that you see in the
[1:13:30] picture
[1:13:33] he's talking about the light the pillar
[1:13:35] of fire that was photographed just above
[1:13:37] his head
[1:13:39] but now he said it was spread out on the
[1:13:42] floor yes
[1:13:44] getting larger and larger
[1:13:47] spreading out across the floor
[1:13:51] well I thought oh God
[1:13:54] and you know sometimes we get the idea
[1:13:56] that a Halo will only be seen over
[1:13:58] someone's head yes
[1:14:03] but he said no that same light now he
[1:14:06] was on the floor
[1:14:08] just imagine now how you would feel
[1:14:11] sorry
[1:14:13] now friends these things are not just
[1:14:15] something that you just imagined in your
[1:14:17] mind
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:22] can he speaks to me just as I'm talking
[1:14:25] to you now not just imagination
[1:14:34] and I look and I've seen the feet of a
[1:14:38] man
[1:14:42] come walking in through that life
[1:14:45] come into my right
[1:14:48] always comes from my right
[1:14:51] that's the reason I have the prayer line
[1:14:54] coming this way
[1:14:57] always comes to my right
[1:15:00] you see the angel of the Lord when he
[1:15:03] prayed for the sick
[1:15:05] he told us the angel always stands to my
[1:15:08] right and
[1:15:11] the reason I have the people come around
[1:15:13] to the on the right side
[1:15:17] is because I want every one of them to
[1:15:20] walk past the presence of that angel and
[1:15:22] feel his presence is
[1:15:29] he was wanting to let you know
[1:15:31] it just wasn't him that can feel his
[1:15:34] presence
[1:15:36] of God he wanted everyone to be able to
[1:15:39] feel that presence
[1:15:42] to live in that presence to believe that
[1:15:46] he's real
[1:15:49] and he says and I looked and I seen his
[1:15:52] face his feet
[1:15:55] and when he got to me he was a tall man
[1:15:59] he was heavy set
[1:16:01] weighed about 200 pounds
[1:16:06] but at one one place brother Brown says
[1:16:09] he was about six feet tall
[1:16:13] 200 pounds
[1:16:15] just like I was 15 years ago
[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:20] looked like just as natural as I'm
[1:16:23] standing here
[1:16:26] his arms folded like this
[1:16:29] arms
[1:16:31] first time I've ever seen him in that
[1:16:36] formed
[1:16:39] walked right up to where I was he looked
[1:16:42] down
[1:16:44] he had a smooth face
[1:16:51] to his shoulders
[1:16:55] he didn't have beard on his face
[1:16:58] he had a smooth face and he walked and
[1:17:01] looked up to me
[1:17:03] he kind he looked pathetic to look at
[1:17:08] him
[1:17:10] can he look like he was a man of well I
[1:17:14] I just could not picture his
[1:17:15] characteristics
[1:17:19] of his face he looked like a man that
[1:17:23] was sympathetic
[1:17:26] kind-hearted but yet he looked like a
[1:17:29] man
[1:17:32] it would be that way so I looked at him
[1:17:36] and he looked at me you know I was so
[1:17:39] scared I was biting my thumb
[1:17:42] till I was almost bleeding listen friend
[1:17:46] is
[1:17:52] and he said fear not for he sense the
[1:17:57] fear in William Branham
[1:17:59] he said fear not
[1:18:03] I knew that was the same voice that
[1:18:05] spoke to me all along
[1:18:09] that was the first time I've ever I'd
[1:18:11] ever seen it like that
[1:18:14] but I know but I know that voice
[1:18:18] say we've never seen him
[1:18:21] there's something he wants you to know
[1:18:24] he wanted to know his voice he wants you
[1:18:28] to know when he speaks to you
[1:18:31] and when you read your Bible
[1:18:37] you can know when it's his voice that
[1:18:39] speaks to you
[1:18:41] know that an answer is
[1:18:45] he says I knew that was the same voice
[1:18:47] that spoke to me all along
[1:18:51] that was the first time I'd ever seen it
[1:18:53] like this
[1:18:56] but I knew that voice
[1:19:01] from the presence
[1:19:05] you know when Zechariah was in the
[1:19:08] temple
[1:19:09] there in Luke chapter one
[1:19:11] offering incense before the God for the
[1:19:14] people
[1:19:16] an angel came down
[1:19:30] I believe it was the angel Gabriel again
[1:19:35] it was good in the very presence of God
[1:19:41] he said fear not nothing I'm sent from
[1:19:44] the presence of almighty God
[1:19:47] tell you that your peculiar birth
[1:19:52] your life
[1:19:55] has been misunderstood with men
[1:19:59] he said your peculiar life and peculiar
[1:20:02] Birth has been to indicate that you're
[1:20:05] to take a gift a Divine Healing to the
[1:20:07] peoples of the world
[1:20:15] William Branham William brand was being
[1:20:18] given a commission
[1:20:19] for a worldwide Ministry
[1:20:22] to introduce Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] The Living Word
[1:20:28] to the people of the world again
[1:20:31] not to the denominations not to the
[1:20:35] systems but to the people in those
[1:20:37] systems
[1:20:40] yes see he was going to break the
[1:20:43] churches to pieces
[1:20:45] you said no no he came to draw make the
[1:20:49] circle bigger
[1:20:53] the time came at the end of his ministry
[1:20:56] of her he said I am sent to the
[1:21:00] elected
[1:21:03] come out of her my people
[1:21:06] not partakers
[1:21:13] he said
[1:21:19] and I said sir I'm uneducated I could
[1:21:22] not go education
[1:21:26] the angel had heard that statement
[1:21:28] before
[1:21:29] when Moses said it it wasn't unusual
[1:21:34] he said I'll be with you
[1:21:37] and I said sir I'm uneducated I could
[1:21:40] not go the people wouldn't believe me
[1:21:45] he said because the prophet Moses was
[1:21:48] given two signs
[1:21:52] so will you be given two sons
[1:21:55] verse will be that you'll be able to
[1:21:57] detect diseases by your hands
[1:22:02] and they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:22:06] and God will heal them he said take in
[1:22:10] the patient by the right hand
[1:22:13] in your left hand
[1:22:15] and if you'll be sincere when you praise
[1:22:21] can be sincere when you pray
[1:22:25] nothing shall stand before your prayers
[1:22:31] Corazon
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:23:08] there's
[1:23:10] no sickness
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:15] he said he said as the prophet Moses was
[1:23:19] given two signs so will you be given two
[1:23:21] signs
[1:23:24] first will be that you'll be able to
[1:23:26] detect diseases by your hands
[1:23:35] and if you'll be sincere when you pray
[1:23:38] get them to believe and be sincere when
[1:23:42] you pray
[1:23:43] she'll stand before your prayer not even
[1:23:45] cancer
[1:23:48] he spoke cancer
[1:23:50] that's the only disease he said is
[1:23:57] it will come to pass
[1:24:00] that you will tell them the secrets of
[1:24:04] their hearts
[1:24:07] those will be the two signs
[1:24:10] it was a sign
[1:24:13] of the ministry
[1:24:15] prophetic Ministry
[1:24:18] declaring God
[1:24:20] present
[1:24:22] Moses had those two signs
[1:24:26] Jesus had the two sons
[1:24:28] he started out as an
[1:24:31] Evangelista then he began to discern the
[1:24:34] hearts of the people
[1:24:36] their very thoughts
[1:24:38] a woman touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:24:43] she might have reached through the crowd
[1:24:45] to touch it
[1:24:48] when healing came to her she Drew her
[1:24:50] hand back and got in the crowd again
[1:24:57] he knew where it was but he was looking
[1:25:00] for a public confession
[1:25:04] just like he wants us to make a public
[1:25:06] confession
[1:25:08] break things
[1:25:24] he said he said and I said I will go
[1:26:11] and it gathered up to the angels
[1:26:14] and it got into the angels and the angel
[1:26:18] went up in that light
[1:26:21] Pillar of Fire that you've seen tonight
[1:26:27] brother Brandon has this great
[1:26:29] experience
[1:26:35] I don't know
[1:26:37] what to do
[1:26:42] hmm
[1:26:43] have you ever felt you've had a real
[1:26:46] genuine experience with the lord
[1:26:52] it's so real
[1:26:54] I mean it's all over
[1:26:56] you feel like
[1:26:58] I don't know what to do
[1:27:01] you're not the first
[1:27:05] even God's prophets
[1:27:12] God feels rich in Mercy I hope there was
[1:27:16] answers there
[1:27:19] in this testimony
[1:27:21] and the message is this a sign of the
[1:27:24] answer is
[1:27:28] this with us
[1:27:31] what is revelation
[1:27:34] is revelation is
[1:27:37] it only quoting what William Branham
[1:27:40] says
[1:27:42] or has God been opening more of this
[1:27:45] word to us since he's gone
[1:27:50] paragraph 63 of is this the sign of the
[1:27:53] answer is
[1:28:00] now we want to read a text
[1:28:04] or or read a scripture reading
[1:28:08] um
[1:28:11] out of the book of the revelation of
[1:28:14] Jesus Christ
[1:28:17] it's not though we call it the Book of
[1:28:20] Revelations e
[1:28:22] is
[1:28:25] though we call it the Book of Revelation
[1:28:29] it's really the book of the revelation
[1:28:32] of a person Jesus Christ
[1:28:39] and I believe that this is the
[1:28:41] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:28:45] written in the book
[1:28:47] and any other Revelation that would be
[1:28:50] contrary to this Revelation foreign
[1:29:17] it can't be ten quotes of the Prophet no
[1:29:21] place
[1:29:22] that don't take you to the word and the
[1:29:25] word of Prophecy
[1:29:27] it must be quotes of the promise that
[1:29:31] point you to a more sure word of
[1:29:33] Prophecy
[1:29:36] um
[1:29:44] let him be a curse
[1:30:10] I wish to read the first few verses the
[1:30:12] first seven verses
[1:30:15] and listen close now and pray with me
[1:30:19] Revelations 10
[1:30:22] 1-70
[1:30:26] this is
[1:30:32] so when you think of the scripture in
[1:30:35] Revelations 8 1.
[1:30:38] and when the seventh seal was open
[1:30:41] because
[1:30:42] there was silence in heaven
[1:30:47] if you say one little verse how can we
[1:30:51] possibly know what that means one verse
[1:30:56] and just a few words
[1:31:06] is yes this is the seventh seal so now
[1:31:10] we got 11 more verses
[1:31:13] to give us revelation
[1:31:16] of what's happening and when it was
[1:31:20] happening here in Revelations 10. so now
[1:31:24] we got 11 verses
[1:31:28] one verse in Revelations
[1:31:31] now we got 12 verses
[1:31:36] there's more than 12 verses
[1:31:41] foreign
[1:32:16] says this
[1:32:19] I said Lord what does that mean
[1:32:25] let me read it again
[1:32:27] if it if it be you see foreign
[1:32:55] but it's by faith that we believe it
[1:32:58] he was talking about the first coming of
[1:33:01] Christ
[1:33:02] he was talking about the opening of the
[1:33:05] first seal
[1:33:07] he was talking about
[1:33:09] of a Plan of Redemption
[1:33:12] he was talking about Jesus Christ
[1:33:15] who would come with a plan to to save us
[1:33:19] to cleanse US foreign
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:34:13] you know here at the second coming of
[1:34:15] Christ
[1:34:19] of indicated messages
[1:34:25] and many are still trying to accept it
[1:34:28] by works
[1:34:35] we must take all the words
[1:34:37] you can't just take one quote
[1:34:40] just as the prophet said you just can't
[1:34:43] take one scripture
[1:34:46] in the message
[1:34:59] I've always taught
[1:35:03] I have always taught
[1:35:06] that in the mouth of two or three
[1:35:09] witnesses
[1:35:10] that every word be established
[1:35:17] because it's in the word
[1:35:20] it was an Old Testament principle
[1:35:27] and it continued to be a principle in
[1:35:29] the New Testament
[1:35:31] that makes it thus saith the Lord
[1:35:35] from Genesis to Revelations
[1:35:39] live this way
[1:35:41] now remember I've always thought that in
[1:35:44] the mouth of two or three Witnesses
[1:35:48] let every word be established
[1:35:51] and the scripture just like you can't
[1:35:54] take one scripture and prove nothing
[1:35:59] unless there's something else goes with
[1:36:01] it see
[1:36:04] I can take one scripture
[1:36:07] and say Judas went and hung himself
[1:36:11] then I can take another scripture
[1:36:15] and say you go do the same
[1:36:19] but it won't blend in with the rest of
[1:36:22] it
[1:36:29] Dios revealing his word to us
[1:36:35] answering our questions
[1:36:40] everything
[1:36:42] in the Visions
[1:36:44] a prophet Taurus
[1:36:46] must be just the way the vision was
[1:36:49] shown
[1:36:51] from Australia and in the message God
[1:36:55] revealing himself to his people
[1:36:58] it gives a example
[1:37:02] he said
[1:37:04] it's just like a while ago in my room
[1:37:12] and I can tell you something's going to
[1:37:15] happen tonight
[1:37:17] right here now
[1:37:19] it just come into my room a while ago
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:24] while I was alone
[1:37:27] and then it says and then when I'll be
[1:37:31] going down
[1:37:33] where I'll be going out
[1:37:37] maybe I'll have a sick call
[1:37:41] or going somewhere I'll be walking I'll
[1:37:46] say oh here's that gate
[1:37:50] that's right there
[1:37:53] I'll walk right up to that place
[1:37:57] somebody's with me
[1:37:58] I say Good Eagle Watch see what happens
[1:38:02] okay now go into the room and I'll lay
[1:38:07] my hat down here
[1:38:09] now everything is in the room
[1:38:12] according to the vision he saw
[1:38:16] but there's no woman there with a red
[1:38:18] sweater
[1:38:20] see I can't say a word yet
[1:38:24] that woman has to be sitting there with
[1:38:26] a red sweater
[1:38:29] maybe when she comes in
[1:38:33] uh another lady goes out
[1:38:36] is there isn't time yet
[1:38:38] I just keep on talking
[1:38:41] then I wait until then here they they
[1:38:45] all are in the room
[1:38:47] everyone that I saw in the room
[1:38:52] but my hat hasn't been moved
[1:38:55] from the radio to the bed
[1:38:58] everything has to be perfectly the way
[1:39:01] he showed it
[1:39:03] then the way he shows me that is
[1:39:07] and everything comes in perfect
[1:39:10] then I'll stand by that baby
[1:39:18] I've never seen it
[1:39:21] it's perfect that's the first way it
[1:39:23] works
[1:39:24] the second way is here on the platform
[1:39:29] that's the way that that takes place
[1:39:32] that's the way it works and happens is
[1:39:50] you know there was a time he gives this
[1:39:52] example
[1:39:54] because in this example
[1:39:58] he actually got ahead of the vision
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:02] and went to pray for the child foreign
[1:40:21] but he gives us a testimony
[1:40:24] of a hunting trip he went on
[1:40:26] [Music]
[1:40:28] um
[1:40:31] where God had told him he'd be killing a
[1:40:33] brown bear
[1:40:36] and he didn't go according to the vision
[1:40:41] and he lost an opportunity
[1:40:43] and he told us on tape you see he said
[1:40:47] you've got to stay with this is
[1:40:59] thank you
[1:41:00] the message and end signed
[1:41:05] as human beings
[1:41:09] we're always looking for a Superman
[1:41:13] always looking for a hero
[1:41:16] I was looking for someone to look up
[1:41:20] that's why sports and entertainment is
[1:41:23] such a big thing amongst the people
[1:41:27] that's why it's multi-billion dollar
[1:41:30] industry
[1:41:32] because of the spirit of idolatry
[1:41:34] foreign
[1:41:38] in the message and end sign
[1:41:43] says in paragraph 197.
[1:41:47] This is now friends on Divine Healing or
[1:41:50] Amigos
[1:41:52] there's no man that can heal you
[1:41:57] there's no more than any man can save
[1:42:00] you
[1:42:02] because both healing and salvation are
[1:42:05] past tense
[1:42:09] when Jesus Christ died at Calvary
[1:42:12] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:42:20] the only thing that you have to do
[1:42:25] either your salvation or you're here
[1:42:33] it's that simple
[1:42:40] to send forth yeah through the blood of
[1:42:44] Jesus Christ
[1:42:57] in the message
[1:42:59] the super signal
[1:43:03] Branham says
[1:43:11] he says
[1:43:14] I know I'm emotional
[1:43:20] [Music]
[1:43:24] Lord as I see these things go the way
[1:43:27] they do it wears me
[1:43:32] let people get back to the word
[1:43:36] and forget all these fantastic things of
[1:43:39] the hour is
[1:43:44] [Music]

[1:47:01] Paul met him on the road going down to
[1:47:03] Damascus
[1:47:05] a great light struck him down
[1:47:09] that Hebrew would have never called him
[1:47:12] Lord
[1:47:14] if he didn't know that was the same
[1:47:16] pillar of five
[1:47:19] who are you Lord and out of that Pillar
[1:47:22] of Fire
[1:47:26] and here you are tonight with us

[1:47:47] God together
[1:47:49] is the same sign that's among us tonight
[1:47:53] at the end of their age
[1:47:57] he said he said let it be once more
[1:48:00] father
[1:48:02] I pray through Jesus Christ's name
[1:48:05] he says
[1:48:08] he said a member of Branham says
[1:48:11] now I take every spirit in here under my
[1:48:14] control
[1:48:18] in moments like that
[1:48:21] you can find Salvation
[1:48:24] or be eternally

[1:48:46] face

[1:48:57] sitting right back here that's just
[1:49:00] bringing up her head yes

[1:49:13] back he says
[1:49:18] all right that's what you were praying
[1:49:20] about it is
[1:49:26] the lady right next to her had a back
[1:49:29] trouble too
[1:49:44] but that's what was right if that's
[1:49:48] right raise your hand
[1:49:50] is it now
[1:49:52] is that super sign now
[1:49:55] it is
[1:49:58] and God is still Discerning hearts
[1:50:02] and you can accept what God is one how
[1:50:05] God's wanting to speak
[1:50:09] your life can be changed
[1:50:13] a Victorious Life
[1:50:15] In Christ in Christ
[1:50:22] it's very true
[1:50:26] that we fail him many times
[1:50:29] not only we as as people
[1:50:33] as ministers as lay members
[1:50:37] but even as as God's prophet
[1:50:41] and he shares that with us
[1:50:44] in a message called
[1:50:49] in 1961
[1:50:53] he says this
[1:50:56] now in California here we have meetings
[1:50:58] or in California and here are some
[1:51:01] people been waiting as much as three
[1:51:03] years or more
[1:51:07] and then as soon as we can get to them
[1:51:11] we don't leave we stay right there until
[1:51:14] the Holy Spirit speaks
[1:51:17] and then they know what to do
[1:51:20] and tell them how to do it
[1:51:23] the way it is and it never has failed
[1:51:27] one time
[1:51:29] because we're gone
[1:51:41] we're thankful for that is
[1:51:46] and ministers by the hundreds
[1:51:50] so we we have a room we take them too
[1:51:54] and they know when that their their
[1:51:56] appointment is
[1:51:58] now sometimes I'll be walking around
[1:52:03] or maybe in prayer for somebody else
[1:52:07] and he'll show me a vision on where to
[1:52:10] go to find someone
[1:52:13] or do something then I take right off
[1:52:17] and do that right now
[1:52:19] because that's God speaking
[1:52:22] using it so I always do try to do as he
[1:52:27] tells me
[1:52:29] I'm sorry to say
[1:52:32] I failed him so many times
[1:52:35] I'm ashamed of myself before his church
[1:52:38] tonight
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:21] yes see

[1:53:58] eternity
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:03] God sent a prophet God sent reformers
[1:54:06] Through the Ages
[1:54:09] it wasn't to change the world
[1:54:14] just to call out the Believers
[1:54:18] in the message
[1:54:28] he says see that's the same thing
[1:54:31] speaking of his ministry Martin Luther
[1:54:35] had a real Revival
[1:54:37] when Luther was living he kept it
[1:54:40] straight
[1:54:42] keep that thought in mind when producer
[1:54:46] was living
[1:54:47] [Music]
[1:54:49] you know Martin Luther spoke in tongues
[1:54:53] yes sir and he had great signs
[1:54:58] but when Luther died
[1:55:03] the church organized and there she went
[1:55:06] another round come up through the
[1:55:09] incubator
[1:55:11] and all and and in all a way they went
[1:55:16] see Martin Luther Martin Luther he
[1:55:20] happened to see the great Pillar of Fire
[1:55:24] but what did he do or what did they do
[1:55:28] okay they organized right under this
[1:55:48] Lutheran movement foreign
[1:56:24] [Music]
[1:56:58] [Music]
[1:57:28] as few mistakes as human
[1:57:33] Jesus name
[1:57:39] then the Pentecostal saw it and the way
[1:57:42] they went after it
[1:57:44] what did they do the same thing the rest
[1:57:48] of them
[1:57:50] the same thing the West the the
[1:57:52] lutherans did the same thing the
[1:57:55] Wesleyan methodists
[1:57:58] with the very same thing
[1:58:01] moved away from the leading of the
[1:58:03] pillar of fires
[1:58:09] periods under Revelations
[1:58:19] he said but remember brother
[1:58:22] he said
[1:58:24] after the first round of the old fathers
[1:58:28] foreign
[1:59:16] and Men preaching this message
[1:59:19] that William Branham has to come back
[1:59:23] and and show this to the world
[1:59:28] when a prophet said this is only for the
[1:59:31] elected church
[1:59:34] and these signs and wonders
[1:59:44] they said
[1:59:46] it's supposed to change your life and
[1:59:49] mind
[1:59:50] not create another denomination
[1:59:54] but once again what the lutherans did
[1:59:58] okay
[2:00:02] there is another movement that's falling
[2:00:06] into the same track doing the same
[2:00:09] things
[2:00:32] she's a Missionary Alliance nomination
[2:00:39] and she was in one of the meetings
[2:00:41] she called brother Bros
[2:00:44] which was also of the Missionary
[2:00:47] Alliance
[2:00:49] said the thing of it is
[2:00:51] you're not letting that gift get started
[2:00:54] out

[2:01:10] bring the whole world to Christianity
[2:01:14] but you see it's not sent to the
[2:01:16] capitals of the nation

[2:04:50] Sinners and
[2:04:54] to wash your sins away
[2:04:59] all you have to say is
[2:05:12] he said it wasn't meant for that
[2:05:15] I was just sent to you foreign
[2:05:59] plowing away
[2:06:02] and just letting it fall anywhere it
[2:06:05] wants to
[2:06:06] get it he's talking about the gospel he
[2:06:09] was preaching but just staying true to
[2:06:12] the words
[2:06:13] I haven't said one word that I back up
[2:06:17] on
[2:06:18] I haven't said one word that the Bible
[2:06:21] doesn't say
[2:06:25] that's right I can prove it by the
[2:06:28] scriptures
[2:06:29] what's been right with the words
[2:06:38] right along just exactly
[2:06:41] can you dear people has come every night
[2:06:45] and practice
[2:06:49] he said I appreciate that
[2:06:52] I pray that not one of you will be lost
[2:06:56] every one of you would be in the kingdom
[2:06:58] of God
[2:07:03] God rich in Mercy
[2:07:08] it said that brother Branham said
[2:07:14] that the angel told them
[2:07:16] if you can get the people to believe you
[2:07:21] and they've made doctrines from that
[2:07:23] statement
[2:07:25] you see we have to believe him
[2:07:30] what about believing in Jesus Christ
[2:07:40] let's read this he says
[2:07:45] he said Now quickly before the time gets
[2:07:47] away
[2:07:49] now notice all right nothing I have
[2:07:53] appeared to you
[2:07:55] I'll put it in my own words
[2:07:58] and as I was quoting his words
[2:08:02] he said fear not I am sent from the
[2:08:05] presence of God
[2:08:07] will tell you that your peculiar birth
[2:08:10] in life
[2:08:13] to indicate you're to take a gift of
[2:08:16] Divine Healing as Indica is
[2:08:21] to the peoples of the world
[2:08:24] you be sincere when you pray
[2:08:27] and get the people to believe
[2:08:30] and nothing will stand before your
[2:08:33] prayers
[2:08:35] now watch the order
[2:08:38] God sent that gift nearly 40 40 about 40
[2:08:44] years ago
[2:08:46] [Music]
[2:08:54] now the thing I was to do
[2:08:58] was to pray for the sick and be sincere
[2:09:02] when I pray
[2:09:03] and nothing and nothing would stand
[2:09:06] before the prayers
[2:09:17] see the thing of it is
[2:09:19] the thing of it is
[2:09:21] to get the people to believe that this
[2:09:26] is the truth now
[2:09:30] he gave the interpretation
[2:09:33] many times he just said the angel said
[2:09:36] if you can get the people to believe
[2:09:42] and then two or three years later
[2:09:45] and another couple of years
[2:09:48] and here he was yes about five years
[2:09:52] later since he had that experience
[2:09:57] and he adds another detail yeah
[2:10:06] even everything he says
[2:10:11] he said the thing is he says you see the
[2:10:15] order now if you can get the people to
[2:10:18] believe you said
[2:10:23] see the order now see the thing of it is
[2:10:27] the thing is is to get the people to
[2:10:31] believe
[2:10:32] that this is the truth
[2:10:35] the message of Christ
[2:10:39] many times he would just say
[2:10:44] if you can get the people to believe
[2:10:51] and many people stop it
[2:10:53] and they put a period
[2:10:56] it's an error yes
[2:10:59] it's a human it's a human error
[2:11:03] Romano
[2:11:08] okay okay William Branham said Williams
[2:11:13] if you can get the people
[2:11:19] true
[2:11:20] what did that means
[2:11:23] is that drawing us away from Christ is
[2:11:27] then a few years later
[2:11:29] he says the angel said luckily if you
[2:11:33] can get the people to believe you see
[2:11:37] then he says see the order now
[2:11:41] well if I just say that no you don't see
[2:11:44] the order
[2:11:45] it's still an unanswered question what
[2:11:49] does it mean
[2:11:50] he says the thing of it is he said the
[2:11:54] thing is is to get the people
[2:11:57] to believe
[2:11:59] that this is the truth
[2:12:02] that's what the first statement meant
[2:12:04] yes
[2:12:06] if you can get the people to believe
[2:12:10] what does that mean
[2:12:13] and he finally gives us the answer
[2:12:16] years later
[2:12:21] it's written just like the Bible
[2:12:25] word upon words
[2:12:33] I can't believe
[2:12:37] people stay in the world
[2:12:41] if you don't understand
[2:12:48] but it all must be scriptures
[2:12:59] God is opened
[2:13:01] his word to us just like at the first
[2:13:05] coming of Christ
[2:13:08] again
[2:13:19] bring Salvation for all his elected
[2:13:24] from the days of Adam
[2:13:27] to our day today
[2:13:30] was the reason for the opening
[2:13:34] the opening of these seven seven parts
[2:13:38] from the first coming of Christ through
[2:13:41] the second coming of Christ
[2:13:43] it's a plan unfolding to save
[2:13:49] from the days of Adams to the days of
[2:13:53] when he goes to 144 000.
[2:13:58] it's a plan some plan in seven Parts but
[2:14:03] how how sure are you that it's open
[2:14:11] it's not revealed
[2:14:13] it's open but surely it's not revealed
[2:14:22] just because you wear a little pen pen
[2:14:24] on your ties
[2:14:27] a picture of the clouds
[2:14:32] that doesn't mean you have any
[2:14:34] Revelations
[2:14:38] that could mean significant that you're
[2:14:42] falling into the Trap
[2:14:44] that the lutherans is
[2:14:52] Revelation Revelation takes you back to
[2:14:55] the world
[2:14:56] Revelation is a personal experience
[2:15:02] and you appreciate your brother brother
[2:15:06] Branham and all the saints around
[2:15:09] but you worship one and one alone
[2:15:13] Jesus Christ Our Lord
[2:15:17] in this message ashamed of him will be
[2:15:19] closing with this
[2:15:22] it's 1965.
[2:15:25] it's July 11th Julio he's got this
[2:15:30] December of that year God takes him home
[2:15:34] five months before he got before God
[2:15:37] takes him
[2:15:39] he says this in paragraph 45. 1965.
[2:15:48] he says I left here by a vision
[2:15:51] he's talking about Jeffersonville
[2:15:54] Indiana
[2:15:55] go Yonder to Tucson
[2:15:59] to see what the Lord wanted me to do
[2:16:03] there he met me up there
[2:16:06] talking about Sunset mountains
[2:16:09] as he told you here what he would do
[2:16:15] and the form of seven angels
[2:16:18] and he said return back and the Seven
[2:16:22] Seals was to be opened
[2:16:25] it's 1965. it's
[2:16:30] July as Julio the 11th God will be
[2:16:34] taking him home in just a few months
[2:16:37] he says
[2:16:39] he says as he told you here that he
[2:16:41] would do and the form of seven angels
[2:16:44] and said to return back and the Seven
[2:16:46] Seals was to be opened
[2:16:54] [Music]
[2:16:56] so he's telling us what God said he
[2:16:58] would do
[2:17:00] and then he says that's just exactly yes
[2:17:07] not only is this book
[2:17:10] not only is this book
[2:17:13] called The Bible
[2:17:15] not only has God opened the books
[2:17:20] because the opening of the book
[2:17:23] starts unfolding the Prophecies of the
[2:17:26] Bible
[2:17:27] the opening of the book
[2:17:30] Rises up Nation against Nations
[2:17:39] the opening of the book brought forth
[2:17:43] the trumpets
[2:17:44] and and the woes and the wars they
[2:17:49] started Gathering Israel back
[2:17:52] the opening of the book
[2:17:55] revealed to you
[2:17:57] that we're part of this plan
[2:18:19] being made clear To Us by prophecies
[2:18:29] is
[2:18:37] we
[2:18:38] we are A peculiar people
[2:18:42] we are a saved people
[2:18:46] where God's holy people
[2:18:51] and the more we stay in the world
[2:18:54] the stranger we look to the world
[2:18:58] because the world is becoming more and
[2:19:01] more and more
[2:19:04] filthy
[2:19:07] there was a time when I was a young man
[2:19:11] you'd walk down the street
[2:19:14] and you could say
[2:19:16] woman over there
[2:19:23] well all the women of the world today
[2:19:37] speaking with a member one time
[2:19:41] years ago
[2:19:43] he was a he was a head gang member of
[2:19:48] the Crips the little strips
[2:19:57] speaking to him about the immorality
[2:19:59] there was vaccine his life
[2:20:04] I said the women of your gangs all
[2:20:08] dressed like prostitutes
[2:20:14] he says that and you men like warmongers
[2:20:23] he said prostitutes
[2:20:25] this is
[2:20:27] we don't even use that word
[2:20:35] we just go from woman to woman
[2:20:37] I never really thought of him as
[2:20:40] prostitutes
[2:20:43] that's just the way we live
[2:20:47] I said well let me go on record to tell
[2:20:49] you
[2:20:52] that you're living
[2:20:54] a filthy and moral life
[2:20:57] and God will judge you
[2:21:02] because the word of God isn't just to
