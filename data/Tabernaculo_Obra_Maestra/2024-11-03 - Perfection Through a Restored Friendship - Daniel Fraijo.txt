oh graas glor [Applause] [Music] thank you Lord for all that you have done for us we are thankful for all of the benefits what God did with us at the cross of Calvary he shed his Precious Blood not the the the blood cell natural even if he did it but what it represented it represented literal life of God that He gave for us and now we can receive the life of that lamb because this lamb was our kinsman redeemer it was not only a beast of the fields only that was the symbol what Jesus did at the cross of Calvary what the creator of the heavens and earth did it was the reality it was not the symbol it was which was real it was which was effective it was the promise made flesh God bless you all this morning to be here once again we'll be ministering in English this morning I told Brother Honan that this morning he's the Mexican so we'll change back and forth it'll be good for all of us and we'll read in in Matthew 5 verse three once again we're speaking on this subject Perfection through a restored friendship with the father Jonathan is it easier of this L slatter there you go thank Matthew chap 5 and verse three blessed are the porn in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this morning Grace for your mercy for your loving kindness I ask your blessing upon your word that something can be said that will go to every heart that it bring us another change a change that draws us closer to you and we ask all these things in Jesus name amen am you may be seated in closing last service we read we we read Matthew 5:3 where it says blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and we shared with you how these two words in spirit can also be used as one word and and when you put the two words together it gives it another meaning he in spirit when used as one word when you use it just as one word then it means to encourage it means to enliven and and so that's what was coming and Happening Here for Matthew Chapter 5 was Jesus preaching on Perfection Perfection being the Capstone Perfection being the Capstone of something God is going to want wants to begin in our lives and that's something that he wants to begin to to help you start your journey A Journey Back to Eden and I'm speaking symbolically A Journey Back to Eden which is the Born Again experience which takes you back to Eden it's the Born Again experience that takes you to the Capstone this Christian Life which is perfection which is which doesn't mean you can do something better than someone else no it means you arrive to eternal life it means you're as Eternal now as the father is eternal that's Bible per Perfection otherwise the way people think of perfection humanistic way arrives to this conclusion we cannot be perfect we can't be a perfect Mason someone will always find one little fault in what we did we can't be the perfect Carpenter another Carpenter can always find a little something there the day we think we're the perfect roofer someone will come and find a fault in our Roofing in our carpentry and when that happens we go see we we don't like it we thought we were perfect it upsets us and yet when we think about it sincerely we say well yeah that part wasn't so good so that kind of perfection it don't exist but Bible Perfection God given Perfection it's real it's quickening it's encouraging Bible Perfection it will Quicken it will Quicken us translate Us by the power of the Holy Spirit once again into the presence of the father that place where the first Adam once lived and where he fell from We're called to go back to that spot stand before almighty God and say our father who are no longer in heaven but now you stand at my side Hallowed be thy name we have five senses we spoke of it seeing hearing touching smell and taste and as we shared with you if you don't surrender these these senses to the Holy Spirit we then use them more often to to discourage than to encourage each other we have five senses of the spirit memory imagination conscience affections reasoning and if you don't surrender these senses to the Holy Spirit you will use these to discourage more often than to encourage and when through these senses of the body and of the spirit we can no longer even encourage ourselves we need God to take control we need to ask have I really been born again holy ghost or do I need a refilling and I need it today May and you know what it's a good place to be for a child of God because it's the beginning of your Exodus Journey out of all the Natural Things of this natural man and it's a journey that you'll take unto Perfection Matthew 5 verse 2 and 3 it says this and he opened his mouth and taught them saying because the ministry of Jesus was a teach Teaching Ministry because the ministry of Jesus was the lamb opening the Lamb's Book of Life teaching us everything that he had once tried to teach to Adam and to Eve but they fail so God has come back again in this in this Century because he's told us his word will not return void if he couldn't do it with Adam and Eve I'll do it in the days of L I'll create a whole new dimension I'll call it the bright age you can enter into this bright age I will Quicken I will transform you the power of the Holy Ghost take you into Perfection you can be Eternal just like I am eternal and he and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and though your poor in spirit in your heart is a seed a soul and you've always been a child of God you are in the mind Mind Of God before the foundation of the world that seed was placed in this in this earth and vessel God God sees that because of that you're born poor in spirit but because you're a child he says I'm going to bless you that are poor in spirit I'm going to give you a kingdom and I'm going to tell you the steps that you have to take to come out of that poorness and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven your natural birth on Earth it's not your end if you're a child of God it's your beginning if your serpent seed it is the beginning of your end but if you're a child of God it's the beginning of a restoration all that the Locust has eaten all that the canker worm has eaten all that those four worms have eaten all that those four horse riders have destroyed and killed I shall restore sayth the Lord and in Genesis 18 we're going to read a story that you know well of a daughter of God who was poor in spirit Genesis 18 and verses 1 [Music] to3 and the Lord appeared to him in the plains of mamry the a few years back I had looked up the word mamre and and I found where where one definition of the word that the word mam also meant change and the Bible says and the Lord appeared to him in the Plaines of mamry and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day [Music] this was Abraham the time of a promise had come and the Bible said and the Lord appeared unto Abraham in the plains of mamry in other words the Lord appeared unto Abraham because now was the time he was going to bring change a great change a supernatural change a change that is humanly impossible but for God nothing is too great nothing is impossible nothing is too hard verse two and he lifted up his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him it was almighty God in a body of Flesh and he had given bodies to Gabriel and Michael and they stood there all three he said and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground and Abraham looked at the three but there was only one that meant the most to him and there was and and and and because there was a voice that he had heard and when he heard that voice he said that's him that man has the voice that has spoke to me all my life it's like when we first heard a message not to lift up a man but we said that man has a voice that that's been speaking to me all my life that's the voice of God the voice of the Holy Spirit glory and said my Lord if I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant Abraham the time for change had come he'd been waiting for 25 years Paul testified and said he never wavered once he NE never wavered once but believed [Music] god let's go to verse n and they said unto him Sarah where is thy wife he said behold in the tent so Abraham was standing looking at almighty God and the Lord had his back to the tent just like you have your backs to that door that's behind you and that's where Sarah was behind the tent door in the tent and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him thou Abraham and Sarah were well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore therefore Sarah had a right to laugh Sarah's back in the tent and here's Abraham outside she's she's thinking he's H in fellowship with a few Brothers again and for 25 years he has sat with men outside of my tent door and they've all talked and laughed and he told them isn't it wonderful God told me Sarah's going to give me a son promise of God Sarah said that that was all right when I was 40 when I was 50 when I was 60 I thought okay all right then I turned 70 and he's still out there fellowshipping with the Brethren telling them we're going to have a child and then I turned 80 and he did it again he called it fellowship with the Brethren telling them we're going to have a child me and Sarah but I'm 90 years old now and she [Music] laughed she laughed out of frustration she laughed out of anger she laughed because she said doesn't the man get it it's too late therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old verse 12 shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also here was a woman poor in spirit after having waited on Abraham's inspiration and hope for almost 25 years of waiting and it didn't happen and what she thought was a reasonable amount of time at this time Sarah was poor in spirit she needed God to encourage her she needed God to enliven her her memory was working against her I can't remember one woman and I'm 90 years old has ever had a child 0 years old Her Imagination told her don't even go there Sarah you don't want a baby at 90 her conscience told her this can't be her affections told her I'm 90 I'm a grandma I I want to hold grandchildren not my own children it's over for me her reasoning told her this is not reasonable for Abraham to keep having these times of fellowship and telling those men I'm going to have his child all of these senses were now taking her far from the promise not closer Sarah in her spirit had hit a poverty level she didn't feel that she was at the threshold of a promise but that this promise had passed her up the door had shut she was left outside I'm a laughing St so so and to all around me you know there was a man who also told us that a promise that a vision had passed him up he had told us that God had been faithful but he hadn't done what God told him to do and and God had done his part but he failed to do what God told him to see the Promise passed him up and it wasn't going to come back again in the message wisdom versus Faith a prophet said this just before I went out there how many remembers me repeating it here that a voice came to me in the room one morning after a vision and and told about the serpent and it had been bound and not to fear anything he he said do not fear he said haven't I proven to haven't I proven to be with you wherever you go haven't I proven to be with you on your hunting trips so what were the hunting trips about to to give William brandom the Assurance to to speak his word to show him I'm always going to be with you when I say I'm going to be with you he said remember when I told you about what I was going to get before I left and all of that see haven't I proved it haven't I proved to be with you then a real sweet voice came and said the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go and I know by that that we're moving up to something I don't know what it is I can't say coming home the other night or the other day just before I came home I fell into a vision and I se some little fellas thin looked like young boys they had on caps and we were standing hunting and I had shot a mammoth big brown looking bear and then they turned around and said to me but there are some confusion about the meeting I I said no matter what the confusion is if I was supposed to go wherever it was I I'll go anyway see it doesn't matter and the vision stopped I don't know where that where that's at but this is on tape it's going to happen see remember it's going to happen it's a vision in the message possessing all things 1965 verse 11 brother bam says that was 1962 the quote before in in in April this is May now and he says many of you remember the vision that I had where I shot the grizzly bear N9 foot grizzly bear and the church remembers me telling it here and the Caribou he said I had another one remember it's on tape here I've seen a great huge brown bear that that might be a Cody and it wouldn't have worked down there in Canada because they're not there you see but wherever it will be it will be that's thus sayith the Lord it will be see he had a promise he had a vision it was thus sayith the Lord so it must come to pass now September of 1962 he had gone on that hunt already listen to what he says now in going on 32 years of ministry I've tried to stay true to the word I don't know of one thing I've ever had to alter on because I read it out of the Bible so if there's a Doctrine and you can't start by reading it out of the Bible it's not a Bible Doctrine then that's all he said so he says he says I don't know of one thing I've ever had to alter on because I read it out of the Bible said said said just what the Bible said and Let It Go like that so I haven't had to take back or rearrange because I just said it the way the Bible says it and I find out if God has spoken anything then we must go with that word in order to make it to be fulfilled we seen that as I told you last night of a vision just recently see that I had to be there and and warned to be there and and God told me six months before to be on that spot and and stand there and saying go down there three times with them he's speaking now about those young boys the hunt those young boys on this hunt telling me six months before to be on that spot and stand there and saying go down there three times with them and I just walked on with the other men because there was two hunting groups and the older brother insisted brother brandham come with me let the young boys go on their own and the vision passed right through exactly God's part and I was left standing brother Eddie bisc gives the testimony I believe he was one of those young boys and that mammoth the young boys found it they saw it and brother brandom and the vision was supposed to have gone with the young boys and that's where he would kill the bear but the other brother convinced him to go with him and he wasn't on that spot where God told him to be three times he said and he he was telling me six months before to be on that spot and stand there and saying go down there three times with them and I just walked on with the other men and the vision passed right through exactly God's part he did it didn't fail and I was left standing so we want to go right with the word and it will bring you out all right I'm sure the purpose of these hunts these Trophies the ones that God told him thus sayth the Lord you're going to kill a Grizzly kill aibou you're going to kill this gigantic brown bear a prophet told us God did his part and he told me three times where to go and who to go with and I didn't do it God did his part and I was left standing Vision fulfilled when he saw the vision it was thus sayith the Lord and when he told us that he that he missed it he did the wrong things isn't that th sayith the Lord then it's fulfilled it's done but this Vision it passed him up he failed to be where he was supposed to be it was a lesson that God was teaching him if I tell you to be in a certain spot and you fail to do that I kep my part but you must keep yours obedience to the word said entitles us to the Token obedience to the word entitles you to a refilling of the Holy Ghost Santo verse 13 Genesis 18 Sarah had laughed within herself not out loud you see someone you see them you say something there's a smile on their face you it's okay to go They're laughing you didn't hear it but you saw a grin he says they're laughing are they laughing with me are they laughing at me well just ask them that's okay but Sarah laughed and God didn't even see a little grin because he's Hebrews 4:12 a discerner of the intense of the heart from heaven above from the throne he sees us he sees you when you laugh he sees you when you're mad he sees you everything and every everything you do and everything you see he sees you when you cry the song writer wrote one time an emotion God understands the song writer said tears are a language he understands so when you cry out to him before you say a word he knows your need your desire oh and he's sweeping down to come down and comfort you Sarah laughed sah but she was really crying Genesis 18:13 and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of assurity bear a child who I'm old God was not Discerning her condition as a Stern rebuke he was telling Abraham my daughter is discouraged she's poor in spirit all her senses are telling her it's too late and that there's nothing she can do about it she's feeling helpless feeling broken feeling ashamed but it wasn't too late for God verse 14 is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto to thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son the Lord with a promise so close was reminding them even in their present condition blessed are the poor Spirits when you let me have full control of your situation verse 15 then Sarah denied saying I laugh not many of us were asked a strong question and we say no that's not how I'm feeling the reaction comes because we know our hearts are being discerned and we're afraid we're afraid people we are afraid that people will think we're not as strong as we want them to think and he said n but thou did did is laugh that would be the first time that this woman pour in spirit laughed and now we know that that laughter was full of fear now we know that that laugh was a laugh of defeat now we know that that laugh was a laugh saying I don't know what to do next but you know what it would not be the last time that Sarah laughed turn with me to Genesis 21 beginning at verse one Perfection through a restored friendship with the father and the father had descended in Genesis 18 let Abraham and Sarah know fear not I come as a friend trust me I'm the creator of heavens and earth verse one of Genesis 21 and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and be Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to them and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah born to him Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being 8 days old as God had commanded him and Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born unto him and Sarah said God had made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me and not at me the first time she laughed full of fear she says Abraham everybody's laughing at me I'm tired of people laughing at me I'm tired of people blaming me for everything but now Sarah said God have made me to laugh something that happened in This Woman's life Supernatural something that God did for her she was born again she was a young woman again and Sarah said God had made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me and not at me and she said who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck verse seven for I have borne him a son in his old age this day as I've shared it before without a doubt coming to this spot in ministering this morning I can tell you exactly each and every one where you are in your Christian walk and not just one but all Paul said in the book of Hebrews chapter 4 anointed of the Holy Ghost in verse 12 for the word of God is quick and Powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to dividing of Thunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart if i and as I've shared this message before I like to say who would like to volunteer this morning for their struggles to be made known to all while you're going to make me pick somebody to discern your hearts and pull everything out right here before everyone I'll start with brother Leo brother Leo Leo this is where you're at in your Christian walk you are between the first laugh and the last laugh be Eternal as God is eternal glory you were getting nervous on me I could tell but now do you see where you're at because you're a Believer because one day you were Po in spirit one day you laughed with fear but today this morning laughing and we're all laughing with you we're on a journey going back to Eden going back into his presence we got the courage to live a life of the Gospel with modest dress not cutting our hair no more high heels the men don't leave their shirts all un button Glory God is making us to laugh now because we have a courage to live a life worthy of the blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is justification by faith and sanctification by the spirit and the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost an adoption a friendship restored with the Father the process unto Perfection and all the kingdom of heaven and everything that offers the believer to bring you to Perfection it's now this morning God is putting it at the feet of the weakest one oh weak one this morning will you pick up the gift of God hold it to your bosom say Lord I accept you as my beloved husband this morning it's not he who willth or he that runneth but him to whom God showeth Mercy Let Me In the words of Jesus show you the steps so you can judge yourself to see where you are some where between the first laugh and the last it begins here Matthew 5 and verse four blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted verse four blessed are they that mourn for the loss of their children for the struggles in the family for the problems at work blessed are they that mourn you're not blessed because you're mourning but you're blessed because he's now made you a a promise I I will comfort you I don't feel the Comfort Yet brother Daniel neither did Sarah but it was coming blessed are the meek so Meek you wouldn't hurt a fly so Meek that you'd rather give your life than kill somebody remember in the beginning Kan had a revelation that he could kill for his God but Abel's Revelation he was only willing to die for his God and Jesus said here blessed was Abel for his meekness that he was only willing to die for me and because of that he will inherit the earth the weakened cist inherit the earth not the not the killers not the warriors with swords and guns and bombs if they don't repent of that nature they will inherit a lake of fire but blessed are the meek Jesus said like Abel better yet like Jesus for they shall inherit the earth meekness is not weakness for without weekness we will not inherit the earth Galatians 516 Apostle Paul a great man of God a prophet an apostle a messenger a church age Angel to the to the Ephesian Church a pastor he pastored this Ephesian Church Paul unfolded the five full ministry in his ministry on the earth and in verse 16 he said this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that they cannot do the things that you would but if ye be led of the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest in other words Paul said in verse 18 if you are led by the spirit you are not under the law what will the law bring us Paul said I'm glad you asked that question because now I'm going to tell you what are the works of the law and what the law will bring to you if you're a legalist in this message this is what you will manifest if you don't repent now the works of the flesh verse 19 which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft Varan ulations wrath strife seditions heresies envies murders drunkenness reings and such like of the which I tell you before as I told you in some time past that they which do such things in this so-called message shall not inherit the kingdom of God why will they not inherit the kingdom of God they have no weekness no Holy Spirit need Matthew 5 verse6 Jesus continues to give us the steps that lead us to be perfect even as the father which is in heaven is perfect he's teaching us step by step how to climb this mountain how to climb this seventh Peak sep he's teaching us how to climb it to the top blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness why is it good to be hungry for righteousness because if you're sincere God makes you a promise for they shall
