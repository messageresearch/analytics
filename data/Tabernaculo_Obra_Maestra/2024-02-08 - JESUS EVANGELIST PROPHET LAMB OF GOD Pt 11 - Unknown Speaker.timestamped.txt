[44:19] on we hope hopefully we we hope very
[44:23] much it's been a blessing for
[44:25] all
[44:28] we were we were speaking it's part 11
[44:32] now of uh the same theme that we've been
[44:36] teaching
[44:39] on part 11 of
[44:43] Jesus
[44:44] evangelist prophet and Lamb of God we
[44:49] left off about Matthew
[44:53] [Music]
[44:54] 11:2
[44:58] and uh it was
[44:59] Jesus telling us when the first seal
[45:05] opened part one of seven Parts had
[45:11] begun and and and the Seven seal had
[45:16] opened and the first seal
[45:20] opened in the days of John the
[45:22] Baptist it's what Jesus taught
[45:27] and who was John the
[45:29] Baptist he was
[45:31] Elijah of Malachi
[45:34] 46 he he was the first
[45:37] Elijah at the first coming of Christ you
[45:40] remember the prophecy there in
[45:43] Malachi of course go Jesus also
[45:46] identified him in Malachi
[45:50] 3 in Isaiah
[45:53] 40 so the ministry of John the Baptist
[45:57] Baptist was spoken in several places in
[45:59] the Old
[46:02] Testament but he was also the first
[46:08] Elijah of the first coming of
[46:11] Christ where the Bible says behold I'll
[46:13] send you
[46:17] Elijah before the great and terrible day
[46:20] of the
[46:22] Lord and he'll turn the
[46:24] hearts
[46:27] of the
[46:28] fathers to the children and there's a
[46:31] comma and then it says and the hearts of
[46:34] the of the of of the
[46:39] children back to the
[46:42] fathers so the K repres separated the
[46:46] first coming of
[46:50] Christ and the second coming of Christ
[46:53] in the same sentence both first and
[46:55] second coming coming was spoken
[47:01] of the first part was fulfilled by
[47:06] John and and and and the one and and the
[47:10] one that identified John not only
[47:16] Jesus but it was Gabriel the
[47:20] Angel when he went to Zariah his
[47:24] father as as as he was praying in the
[47:28] temple he was offering up incense of
[47:31] prayers before for the
[47:35] people and an angel appears unto
[47:39] him and he tells him I am
[47:42] Gabriel I come from the very presence of
[47:46] God here to tell you that your
[47:49] son is going to have a special
[47:53] Ministry he's going to introduce
[47:56] Messiah he's going to
[47:59] introduce the Lamb of
[48:02] God he's going to introduce the king of
[48:04] the Jews to
[48:08] Israel and Gabriel said he will turn the
[48:12] hearts of the
[48:14] fathers to the children and he stopped
[48:18] right there in the middle of the
[48:21] verse and he didn't he didn't quote the
[48:24] other part
[48:26] because the second part was for the
[48:28] second
[48:30] coming and John was not that Elijah to
[48:33] the second
[48:36] coming John was the Elijah to the first
[48:41] coming so if you turn with me to
[48:45] Matthew Matthew
[48:47] 11 and verse
[48:49] 12 this is Jesus in the lamb
[48:54] Ministry because he's is the only one
[48:56] that can open the book and reveal
[48:58] it and that's exactly what he was doing
[49:01] in Matthew
[49:04] 11 it was a teaching
[49:07] now he was teaching on the first coming
[49:10] of
[49:11] Christ he was teaching on this
[49:15] coming and he was telling them it's I am
[49:19] this Lamb of
[49:22] God John is this the Elijah min
[49:28] Min and the violence that you're
[49:32] seeing and the violence they're doing
[49:34] against the
[49:39] Believers the violence against John's
[49:41] believer John's
[49:45] followers and the violence against those
[49:48] who are following
[49:50] [Music]
[49:52] Jesus Jesus identifies it
[49:57] and it's the beginning of the
[50:01] ride of the white horse
[50:03] rider Lucifer luf he is the violent
[50:08] one he is a murderer and a liar from the
[50:12] beginning he's the
[50:16] murderer and
[50:18] liar from from the
[50:21] beginning so his
[50:24] children have those same
[50:27] characteristics they also are
[50:30] violent they also are
[50:33] liars they're also
[50:37] immoral so be we be read Matthew 11:1
[50:44] 12 and it says and from the days of John
[50:48] the
[50:49] Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[50:54] suffer violence
[50:56] and the
[50:56] violent take it by force turn with me
[51:00] now to
[51:04] Revelations chapter
[51:07] 6 verse 1 and
[51:15] two he says and I saw when the lamb
[51:17] opened one of the
[51:21] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[51:24] of thunder
[51:27] and if we and as we've shared with you
[51:29] what the Bible is saying
[51:32] that is that the noise of
[51:37] Thunder
[51:38] represents the opening of one of the
[51:42] seals by the Lamb of
[51:44] God because this seven sealed
[51:48] book this is the Lamb's Book of
[51:52] Life this seven sealed book
[51:56] that's the Lamb's Book of
[51:58] Life is another book called the New
[52:02] Testament because the New Testament
[52:05] begins in Matthew
[52:07] 1:1 and this is the
[52:11] generation of Jesus Christ it's the
[52:14] Lamb's
[52:15] Book we've had it in our hands all the
[52:20] time but the eyes of our understanding
[52:23] hadn't come
[52:24] open
[52:27] we didn't know what we
[52:29] had we didn't know how close he's always
[52:32] been to
[52:35] us we know now that's why it's made us
[52:41] grateful that's why it's made us
[52:44] Kinder that's why it makes us more
[52:48] honest that's why we can share the love
[52:50] of God one with
[52:52] [Music]
[52:54] another
[52:56] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[52:57] the seals and I heard as it were the
[52:59] noise of
[53:04] thunder and and one of the four be
[53:10] saying come and
[53:15] see and we realize that that fourth be
[53:18] that one of the four Beast that was
[53:19] talking
[53:24] about was the
[53:26] lion for he's the
[53:28] first of these four living
[53:31] creatures and we found that in
[53:33] Revelations chapter
[53:35] 4 in verse two and I saw and behold a
[53:39] white
[53:41] horse a
[53:43] power a power and he that sat on him had
[53:46] a
[53:48] bow we realized that this bow he
[53:52] had and he had no arrows
[53:57] and this bow was Israel the
[54:01] church a denomination in that
[54:04] day that wanted to put Jesus to
[54:09] death but they had no
[54:12] Arrow no power they were a deceitful
[54:20] bow they were a deceitful
[54:22] bow we found it in the psalm where
[54:25] that's what Israel was
[54:30] called a a a and they contined to be a
[54:34] deceitful
[54:39] bow and then it says and a crown was
[54:42] given unto
[54:46] him and a crown was given unto
[54:51] him and and the crown was Pagan Rome
[54:57] and Lucifer held in his
[55:00] hands the denominations of that
[55:03] day and the Nations and leaders of
[55:06] nations of that
[55:07] [Music]
[55:09] day and they fought and hated each
[55:13] other but they were both in the hands of
[55:18] Lucifer and Lucifer knows how to how to
[55:21] make enemies work together Lu
[55:28] to crucify Christ the
[55:32] word and Lucifer still has the churches
[55:36] and the Nations and leaders in his
[55:40] hands and they still hate each
[55:44] other and he's still going to cause
[55:49] them to crucify the word
[55:53] again and a prophet preached the
[55:58] message I indict this
[56:01] generation for the second
[56:04] crucifixion of Jesus Christ let's pray
[56:08] Heavenly Father we thank you ask your
[56:12] blessings on this
[56:14] word in Jesus
[56:16] name amen amen you may be
[56:22] seated and it says and he went forth
[56:26] conquering and to
[56:34] conquer in
[56:37] Matthew 11
[56:49] again and verse
[56:52] 12 and from the days of John the Baptist
[56:55] until
[56:57] now Jesus
[56:59] speaking and from the days of John the
[57:01] Baptist until
[57:04] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth
[57:09] violence and the
[57:12] violent take it by
[57:14] force do you see the
[57:18] similarity and he that went out
[57:22] conquering and to conquer Jesus said in
[57:26] the days of John the
[57:28] Baptist he's telling us that it's in the
[57:31] days of this first
[57:34] Elijah that the white horse rider began
[57:36] his
[57:40] ride to to to conquer through
[57:46] violence the church the mystical
[57:50] body those who were catching a re end
[57:53] time revelation
[57:58] of this end
[58:02] time recognizing their day and their
[58:07] message that's what was taking place
[58:09] here in Matthew
[58:12] 11 and and and
[58:15] Jesus the Holy Spirit was
[58:20] revealing the day and the
[58:23] message
[58:25] the Forerunner
[58:28] Elijah and his own
[58:31] Ministry for John had identified Jesus
[58:37] already and to his followers and to the
[58:40] world in that day he said Behold the
[58:42] Lamb of
[58:45] God now Jesus was identifying
[58:50] John and the masses were
[58:53] saying these two two cousins they sure
[58:55] know how to fix themselves up nice don't
[59:00] they one says he's
[59:03] Elijah the other one Pats his back and
[59:06] says he's the
[59:09] Christ that's what the Pharisees were
[59:12] saying that's what the doctors of
[59:14] divinity were
[59:16] saying that's what the denominations
[59:19] were
[59:20] saying but the but but it was
[59:23] true
[59:25] it was
[59:27] true this was the first coming of
[59:31] Christ and when the Holy Spirit went
[59:35] forth teaching as Lion of the tribe of
[59:40] Judah teaching
[59:43] Israel giving the
[59:47] firstborn giving given to the firstborn
[59:50] the oldest
[59:53] church
[59:56] the the king of the
[59:58] Jews opened
[1:00:00] up the the the Lamb's Book of
[1:00:04] Life and Loos the
[1:00:07] seals and the Plan of Redemption to
[1:00:11] Israel and that's what Israel was being
[1:00:13] judged
[1:00:16] for for rejecting
[1:00:19] salvation for rejecting
[1:00:23] Redemption for rejecting the Lamb of
[1:00:27] God they offered Lambs
[1:00:32] literally but they could never see the
[1:00:35] Revelation that what they were doing in
[1:00:38] the
[1:00:39] literal was only a
[1:00:41] shadow of a reality that was coming one
[1:00:45] day and when that day came they couldn't
[1:00:49] set they couldn't let go of the
[1:00:52] Shadow to grab a hold of the real
[1:00:58] lamb and and and of a truth you can't
[1:01:00] hold the
[1:01:04] shadow so they had
[1:01:10] nothing but when he the real lamb
[1:01:16] came and he offered to
[1:01:19] them a
[1:01:21] reality a god with skin on
[1:01:25] a god with
[1:01:28] skin they said
[1:01:30] no we'll keep trying to hold the
[1:01:35] shadow but the shadow meant nothing to
[1:01:38] them
[1:01:41] anymore it became a business for the
[1:01:46] businessmen they saw a way to make
[1:01:50] money with the law of
[1:01:52] Moses and they did
[1:01:55] and when Jesus came
[1:01:57] in the Bible says he took a
[1:02:02] whip and he started
[1:02:05] whipping and he turned over the tables
[1:02:08] of the money
[1:02:11] changers and coins and and money went
[1:02:13] all over the
[1:02:18] floor he probably started opening up
[1:02:20] cages and letting the Lambs run
[1:02:23] out
[1:02:27] he was fulfilling a
[1:02:31] prophecy and while he did it he
[1:02:34] said he said my house is a House of
[1:02:38] Prayer but you've turned it into a den
[1:02:41] of
[1:02:43] Thieves So what had been what was the
[1:02:46] anointing now on this Jewish
[1:02:52] religion Lucifer Lucifer
[1:02:55] had the bow in his
[1:02:57] hand but they had no
[1:03:00] Arrow they were wishing him
[1:03:04] dead they were wishing they could
[1:03:06] crucify him right
[1:03:11] then but Rome wouldn't allow
[1:03:15] it Rome didn't allow
[1:03:19] anyone to to to to display the this
[1:03:23] violence of a of
[1:03:24] of of of of a public destruction of
[1:03:27] someone on the
[1:03:31] cross they
[1:03:34] alone reserved that violence for
[1:03:42] themselves so here the
[1:03:47] Bible it says and from the days of John
[1:03:50] the
[1:03:52] Baptist until now
[1:03:55] the Kingdom of
[1:03:57] Heaven is being
[1:04:00] conquered and is and and the White Horse
[1:04:03] riter is
[1:04:07] Conquering the Believers of John and
[1:04:12] Jesus and because of his
[1:04:15] ride the Kingdom of Heaven is suffering
[1:04:20] violence and these violent ones are
[1:04:23] taking them by
[1:04:25] force they're killing them they're
[1:04:28] putting them in prison they they're
[1:04:31] breaking up
[1:04:35] families this was not the Disciples of
[1:04:39] John turn with me to Luke chapter
[1:04:44] 3 and verse
[1:04:49] 14 Luke 3 and verse1
[1:04:53] 14
[1:04:57] listen to the teachings of
[1:05:04] John he was baptizing on the River
[1:05:08] Jordan and many were coming to
[1:05:11] him many were
[1:05:14] believing many were
[1:05:16] repenting they seen that John was a
[1:05:21] prophet and even soldiers came to him
[1:05:25] Roman
[1:05:27] soldiers and they said and the soldiers
[1:05:30] likewise demanded him
[1:05:35] saying and what shall we
[1:05:38] do and he said unto them do violence to
[1:05:42] no
[1:05:45] man neither accuse any falsely and be
[1:05:48] content with your
[1:05:53] wages
[1:05:55] and the soldiers who had repented
[1:06:00] said we'll have to get another
[1:06:03] job because this job is all about
[1:06:09] violence they said I quit I ain't doing
[1:06:12] this no
[1:06:13] more I
[1:06:16] quit I'm I'm leaving this
[1:06:19] job I won't be a soldier to war why cuz
[1:06:23] they had
[1:06:25] repented and they asked for Holy Ghost
[1:06:29] advice because they
[1:06:31] asked Holy Ghost
[1:06:39] advice what will we do as
[1:06:43] soldiers and he said unto them do
[1:06:46] violence to no
[1:06:49] man so this is not the Disciples of of
[1:06:53] John
[1:06:55] that were bringing forth this
[1:06:58] violence but what of the Disciples of
[1:07:01] Jesus for the Ministries had
[1:07:06] overlapped of the of the
[1:07:10] Forerunner and and Messiah the Lamb of
[1:07:14] God turn with me to Isaiah
[1:07:19] 53 and verse
[1:07:22] 9
[1:07:24] Isaiah
[1:07:27] 53 is also the
[1:07:29] opening of the first
[1:07:32] seal you remember the first verse in
[1:07:34] Isaiah
[1:07:37] 53 who has believed our
[1:07:41] report in other words we're bringing you
[1:07:44] a
[1:07:45] message who's believed this message
[1:07:47] we're
[1:07:50] bringing and to whom is the arm of the
[1:07:53] Lord reveal
[1:07:56] revealed so what is Isaiah 53
[1:08:01] about
[1:08:02] prophecy of a message
[1:08:05] coming that can only be received by
[1:08:11] Revelation you see Isaiah
[1:08:15] 53 it starts with Jesus as a 12-year-old
[1:08:20] boy because at 12 years old a young boy
[1:08:24] in
[1:08:26] Israel was now considered a son of the
[1:08:31] Torah that means you're an
[1:08:34] adult that means you you you that means
[1:08:38] you can you're are held liable for
[1:08:40] everything you say and do
[1:08:44] now that means you're not a child no
[1:08:48] more and at 12 years old Jesus rises
[1:08:52] up goes into the temple in
[1:08:57] Jerusalem and begins to discuss the Deep
[1:08:59] things of
[1:09:01] God that not even the rabbis knew or
[1:09:07] understood that was Isaiah 53 and
[1:09:11] 1 there it was opening up in
[1:09:16] reality no more a
[1:09:20] prophecy but Isaiah 53 becoming history
[1:09:26] now that was the day that was the
[1:09:31] time that this that this scripture began
[1:09:34] to
[1:09:36] unfold that became
[1:09:39] flesh now Isaiah
[1:09:43] 539 so Isaiah 53 is Jesus from a 12year
[1:09:47] old
[1:09:50] boy all the way to his death on the
[1:09:53] cross
[1:09:56] and it says and he made his grave with
[1:09:58] the
[1:10:01] wicked and and with the rich in his
[1:10:05] death now in in English it it reads a
[1:10:09] little different than
[1:10:11] Spanish because he had done no violence
[1:10:14] neither was any deceit in his
[1:10:20] mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[1:10:23] him
[1:10:27] to put him to
[1:10:31] grief when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:10:34] offering for
[1:10:37] sin for he shall seek his seed he shall
[1:10:41] prolong his
[1:10:45] days and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:10:48] prosper his
[1:10:52] hand Isaiah
[1:10:56] 53 and he made verse n and he made his
[1:10:59] grave with the wicked and with the rich
[1:11:01] in his death because he had done no
[1:11:04] violence neither was any deceit in his
[1:11:09] mouth if Jesus does no
[1:11:14] violence if there's no deceit in his
[1:11:17] mouth his children will do no
[1:11:21] violence and there'll be no in their
[1:11:24] mouths or
[1:11:28] Hearts so who is it doing the violence
[1:11:30] in the Days of Elijah John the
[1:11:37] Baptist it's the bow and the
[1:11:40] crown who are in the hands of the white
[1:11:43] horse
[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:48] rider
[1:11:50] Lucifer they have not merged yet
[1:11:58] Rome and the
[1:12:00] church but Satan controls them
[1:12:04] both controls
[1:12:06] who in the days of Jesus
[1:12:09] here the Jewish Orthodox
[1:12:13] Church its high
[1:12:16] priest and and and levitical
[1:12:21] Priests and Pagan Rome
[1:12:24] with its
[1:12:26] Caesar and all its
[1:12:28] officers all its
[1:12:31] congressmen all its
[1:12:33] senators all the governors of
[1:12:36] States all the mayors of the
[1:12:41] Cities the white horse
[1:12:44] rider the white horse
[1:12:48] rider that Jesus spoke
[1:12:51] to in in Matthew
[1:12:54] four on Mount
[1:12:58] Temptation here he is
[1:13:00] now bringing forth
[1:13:03] violence and the kingdom of God was
[1:13:06] suffering
[1:13:09] violence do you
[1:13:11] see Jesus in Matthew
[1:13:14] 11 was
[1:13:16] declaring the first seal is
[1:13:20] open part one has begun
[1:13:25] of a seven-part
[1:13:27] plan to save
[1:13:30] you to save
[1:13:34] you to change you to mold you into His
[1:13:40] Image to give you now the power of a
[1:13:43] born again
[1:13:48] experience to give you a relationship
[1:13:51] with the father
[1:13:56] Pilot's judgment
[1:14:02] Hall St John 19 and verse
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:07] 11 this is judgment's pilot Hall Pilot's
[1:14:11] judgment
[1:14:13] Hall where Jesus was
[1:14:19] questioned St John 19 verse 11
[1:14:24] questioned and mocked for four
[1:14:29] days and it says in verse
[1:14:32] 11 Jesus
[1:14:34] answered thou couldest have no power at
[1:14:38] all against
[1:14:42] me except that were given thee from
[1:14:46] above therefore he that delivered me
[1:14:49] unto thee hath the greater
[1:14:52] sin
[1:14:56] and from then forth pilate sought to
[1:14:58] release
[1:15:01] him but the Jews cried out
[1:15:06] saying if thou let if thou let this man
[1:15:09] go thou are not Caesar's
[1:15:13] friend they were using political
[1:15:21] statements in order to for Force pilate
[1:15:24] to give him that
[1:15:27] arrow and whosoever maketh himself a
[1:15:30] king speaketh against
[1:15:38] Caesar this is the church using this
[1:15:44] language for
[1:15:47] violence when pilate therefore heard
[1:15:49] that
[1:15:51] saying he brought Jesus forth and sat
[1:15:54] down in the Judgment
[1:15:58] seat in a place that is called the
[1:16:04] pavement but in the Hebrew
[1:16:09] Gaba and it was the preparation of the
[1:16:14] Passover and this Lamb of
[1:16:17] God had been was being
[1:16:21] prepared was being interrogated
[1:16:25] was being checked to see if there's any
[1:16:27] flaw in
[1:16:32] him oh what perfect timing God
[1:16:37] has that it was in the Passover
[1:16:41] time in the preparation
[1:16:44] time where God had
[1:16:47] prepared a lamb for his children it says
[1:16:52] and about the six
[1:16:56] hour he saith unto the Jews behold your
[1:16:59] king verse
[1:17:08] 14 but they cried out anyway with him
[1:17:12] away with him away with him crucify
[1:17:17] him pilate saith unto them shall I
[1:17:20] crucify your king
[1:17:26] listen to the
[1:17:29] statement of the high
[1:17:32] priest of
[1:17:33] Israel and the chief priest
[1:17:38] answered we have no King but
[1:17:43] Caesar not
[1:17:45] Jehovah not
[1:17:47] Elohim not not MDC who met with
[1:17:52] Abraham we have no King but
[1:17:57] Caesar he sold out the Jewish
[1:18:03] Nation he rejected
[1:18:06] Jehovah made flesh in their
[1:18:10] midst he denounced
[1:18:14] Jehovah the God of
[1:18:17] Israel had once again been forsaken for
[1:18:21] a heathen God
[1:18:29] they had forsaken
[1:18:33] him for a heathen
[1:18:36] God there it is an invisible
[1:18:41] Union and by the mouth of the high
[1:18:45] priest both church and state came
[1:18:50] together they United they did they
[1:18:53] didn't like being
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:56] united but it was Lucifer who was
[1:18:59] anointing them both for this invisible
[1:19:05] Union to crucify Jesus their
[1:19:09] King the bow had no
[1:19:14] arrows to crucify
[1:19:16] Jesus but in a union in a
[1:19:21] merger with the crown
[1:19:24] Pagan
[1:19:26] Rome Rome became Israel's
[1:19:33] Arrow Roma and he Lucifer had used them
[1:19:39] both and
[1:19:41] together they crucified the Son of
[1:19:45] God King of the
[1:19:47] Jews Jesus of
[1:19:49] Nazareth and it was the Passover time
[1:19:54] and Jesus stood before the court of
[1:20:00] pilate four days you know in the Old
[1:20:05] Testament during the time of
[1:20:10] Passover they would gather all these
[1:20:13] Lambs
[1:20:17] together for the
[1:20:20] Passover and within 4 days
[1:20:24] a high priest and his
[1:20:27] sons had to find one perfect
[1:20:32] lamb that would be offered
[1:20:34] up for the sins of the
[1:20:40] nation my goodness and
[1:20:43] Jesus and Jesus four
[1:20:47] days
[1:20:49] interrogated by Pilot and by the Jewish
[1:20:58] church and they found no fault in
[1:21:06] him pilate
[1:21:09] himself after they screamed and screamed
[1:21:12] crucify
[1:21:15] him he says I want you to
[1:21:18] know after four
[1:21:21] days interrogating this
[1:21:25] man
[1:21:26] I find no
[1:21:29] fault in
[1:21:31] him he
[1:21:34] prophesied for a moment this Pagan
[1:21:41] ruler was anointed of God to
[1:21:45] prophesy and declare a
[1:21:48] truth this is the Lamb of
[1:21:50] God he will die this
[1:21:53] day but he is the perfect
[1:21:57] sacrifice there is no fault in
[1:22:00] him he was he had a birth an Immaculate
[1:22:05] birth he was our near
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:14] Kinsman but there was no flaw in
[1:22:19] him for the blood that was shed
[1:22:24] had nothing to do with
[1:22:26] Mary nothing to do with
[1:22:30] Joseph this was a spotless
[1:22:34] lamb it couldn't have been mixed with
[1:22:37] any part of Joseph or any part of
[1:22:44] Mary for then it would have been
[1:22:48] spotted because then one of the parents
[1:22:51] would have been a flawed human being
[1:22:53] born in sin under the curse that were
[1:22:55] all
[1:23:01] born born in
[1:23:07] sin but the Bible
[1:23:09] says it was an Immaculate
[1:23:13] birth a prophet said Mary was only an
[1:23:20] incubator there wasn't drop of blood
[1:23:23] that
[1:23:28] flowed the Catholic Doctrine is
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:32] this that that that they have found the
[1:23:35] blood of
[1:23:37] Jesus in
[1:23:39] Jerusalem underneath some caves
[1:23:42] underneath the Crucifixion
[1:23:47] site and the way they know it's the
[1:23:49] blood of
[1:23:51] Jesus dripped through the rocks and fell
[1:23:54] down into these
[1:24:00] caves is that when they tested it in a
[1:24:05] laboratory it only
[1:24:07] had 23
[1:24:11] chromosomes of the
[1:24:13] mother and they claim they claim that's
[1:24:16] the blood of
[1:24:19] Jesus if that's the blood of Jesus
[1:24:23] then Jesus was not the Lamb of
[1:24:27] God for he is
[1:24:30] flawed because he is because he is
[1:24:35] stained and he's stained with the
[1:24:40] curse that he was
[1:24:43] born through a sexual
[1:24:48] birth and if Mary was biologically the
[1:24:51] mother
[1:24:55] then the Catholics say that's why she is
[1:24:57] the mother of
[1:25:00] God but if she's the mother of
[1:25:03] God then her son is not the Lamb of
[1:25:07] God cuz he's
[1:25:11] flawed he's he's
[1:25:15] stained you see where they
[1:25:21] went why I know I'm criticized for
[1:25:26] it when I say the spoken word
[1:25:30] seed that God
[1:25:33] created both ovam and
[1:25:37] sperm had nothing to do with Mary and
[1:25:41] Joseph and as a prophet told us over and
[1:25:45] over she was just an
[1:25:49] incubator like you would take a chicken
[1:25:52] egg
[1:25:54] that's already
[1:25:57] fertilized and they place it in an
[1:26:01] incubator what does the incubator
[1:26:04] do just keeps it
[1:26:07] warm but the incubator provided
[1:26:12] nothing it was already a complete
[1:26:15] fertilized
[1:26:18] egg and in this
[1:26:21] case spoken
[1:26:23] word Original
[1:26:26] Seed
[1:26:28] created a perfect
[1:26:31] lamb without spot without wrinkle that
[1:26:36] the father would
[1:26:38] accept to intercede for you and
[1:26:41] I and the blood of this spotless
[1:26:45] lamb would wash us white as
[1:26:50] snow even in in this body it washes as
[1:26:54] white as
[1:26:55] snow and when the father looks down and
[1:26:59] sees you through the blood of this
[1:27:02] lamb he's pleased to
[1:27:06] say you're just
[1:27:09] perfect you're
[1:27:11] sinless under the blood of
[1:27:14] Jesus what does that do for us it it
[1:27:18] gives us a space of time to repent and
[1:27:21] be baptize in the name of Jesus and be
[1:27:25] born
[1:27:26] again and receive refilling after
[1:27:29] refilling through hard trials he places
[1:27:32] us
[1:27:33] to because he because he is shaping
[1:27:38] Us in the
[1:27:41] stature of a perfect
[1:27:43] man it's through this innocent
[1:27:47] sacrifice that that pilate said I find
[1:27:50] no fault in him
[1:27:52] after four days I find no fault in this
[1:28:00] man he paid a
[1:28:03] price we owed a price we could not
[1:28:09] pay he paid a price he did not
[1:28:13] owe we needed this
[1:28:17] Jesus to wash our sins
[1:28:21] away
[1:28:23] Matthew
[1:28:28] 11:13 it says for all the prophets and
[1:28:30] the law prophesied until
[1:28:38] John this is Jesus
[1:28:40] speaking you can believe what Jesus
[1:28:46] says and then he says if you'll receive
[1:28:49] it this is Elias which was for to
[1:28:57] come now people
[1:28:59] say verse 13 proves that there will be
[1:29:03] no more
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:06] prophets verse 13 the words of Jesus
[1:29:09] proves no more prophets for it says for
[1:29:12] all the prophets and the law prophesied
[1:29:14] until
[1:29:17] John but that's not what the scripture
[1:29:19] is
[1:29:20] saying Jesus said all the prophets and
[1:29:25] the
[1:29:27] law so all the prophets that were back
[1:29:30] under the
[1:29:35] law all and all the prophets and the law
[1:29:38] prophesied until
[1:29:44] John but if you'll receive
[1:29:47] it this is Elijah the
[1:29:50] prophet which was to come so the
[1:29:53] prophetic Ministry
[1:29:58] continues so what
[1:30:00] changed their
[1:30:02] message of the prophets now was no
[1:30:05] longer an an Old Testament
[1:30:09] message it was no longer the law of
[1:30:12] Moses now the prophetic Ministry had
[1:30:17] changed and they would preach the
[1:30:19] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[1:30:24] they would preach Behold the Lamb of God
[1:30:26] is
[1:30:27] here they would say it's Jesus of
[1:30:31] Naz he said he that have ears to
[1:30:34] hear Let Him
[1:30:37] hear brother says in the message the
[1:30:39] fifth
[1:30:46] seal fifth
[1:30:48] seal now in biblical terms
[1:30:53] these beasts are
[1:30:56] power he's speaking of this of the beast
[1:30:59] in
[1:31:00] Revelations he said I want you to notice
[1:31:03] the
[1:31:07] devil he had his four changing colored
[1:31:14] beasts that went
[1:31:18] forth he said that was all three of them
[1:31:22] was put into it was put into the color
[1:31:25] of
[1:31:27] one and that made a Pale
[1:31:31] Horse a white
[1:31:33] horse a red
[1:31:36] horse a black horse a Pale Horse and
[1:31:40] we've seen each one of those was a stage
[1:31:43] of his
[1:31:47] ministry a stage of the early
[1:31:50] church
[1:31:56] that had formed into a
[1:32:01] denomination at NAA
[1:32:04] Rome the original Pentecostal
[1:32:08] Church the original Pentecostal
[1:32:15] Church Upon whom the Holy Ghost was
[1:32:17] poured
[1:32:20] out took up an antichrist
[1:32:29] spirit and formed an
[1:32:32] organization gave birth to some
[1:32:34] Daughters of
[1:32:36] organization gave
[1:32:42] birth changing his power three
[1:32:47] times and put them in
[1:32:49] one and made a pale
[1:32:53] horse and then given a name called
[1:32:59] death and and and rode him into
[1:33:05] eternity in other words rode all the way
[1:33:08] to the end this Pale
[1:33:14] Horse so if the white horse
[1:33:18] rider so if the white horse rider
[1:33:24] Inon began in the Days of
[1:33:27] Elijah when did the palale horse rider
[1:33:30] begin his
[1:33:35] days in the Days of
[1:33:37] Elijah one is first
[1:33:40] coming one is the first coming
[1:33:44] un and one is the second
[1:33:47] coming white horse
[1:33:49] rider Lucifer
[1:33:52] began Jesus said in the days of John the
[1:33:58] Baptist who was
[1:34:00] Elijah the pattern of his
[1:34:02] word it will never be
[1:34:06] broken people might disbelieve
[1:34:10] it but they'll just miss a
[1:34:14] Rapture they'll just fail to be born
[1:34:17] again they just won't be
[1:34:20] changed so at the first
[1:34:24] coming if the if the first seal
[1:34:28] opened and the white horse rider was
[1:34:31] loosed in the days of John the
[1:34:37] Baptist now we know when the pale horse
[1:34:40] rider began his
[1:34:45] ride because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:34:49] yesterday today and forever unchanging
[1:34:52] in all his
[1:34:55] ways that's how we know the second
[1:34:58] coming has
[1:35:01] begun because Elijah came on the
[1:35:04] scene
[1:35:07] 1909 and the pale horse
[1:35:11] rider began his
[1:35:14] ride in the Days of
[1:35:16] Elijah and in
[1:35:19] 1914 what did this Pale Horse riter
[1:35:21] Called
[1:35:22] Death what did he
[1:35:27] do World War I
[1:35:33] began the first world war
[1:35:40] ever where this pale horse
[1:35:44] rider showed his first
[1:35:48] move and put the whole world
[1:35:53] fighting and
[1:35:55] killing and once again the kingdom of
[1:35:59] heaven was suffering
[1:36:02] violence and the violent were taking it
[1:36:04] by
[1:36:07] force and the Catholic
[1:36:09] Church entered into an invisible
[1:36:14] Union with Hitler with
[1:36:17] Germany with
[1:36:20] Nazis the pattern
[1:36:23] repeats where are we
[1:36:25] today we're in a time of
[1:36:29] preparation as
[1:36:34] individuals not as some
[1:36:37] denomination not as a
[1:36:40] group the
[1:36:43] preparation for your
[1:36:45] Passover is an is a personal
[1:36:48] relationship with the
[1:36:50] father
[1:36:52] for by one
[1:36:53] Spirit are you baptized into this one
[1:36:57] body of the Lamb of
[1:37:01] God that's made a way for
[1:37:04] you for your family children your
[1:37:08] husband for your
[1:37:12] wife in Matthew
[1:37:16] 11:16 Jesus
[1:37:20] said he had preached to
[1:37:23] them he was
[1:37:25] Messiah remember his disciples came to
[1:37:28] ask
[1:37:30] him the Disciples of
[1:37:33] John they came to ask
[1:37:36] Jesus you've probably
[1:37:39] heard John's in
[1:37:43] prison Herod has placed him in
[1:37:47] prison and they're going to be cutting
[1:37:49] his head off
[1:37:53] who was going to cut his head
[1:37:57] off
[1:37:59] Rome what was John
[1:38:03] suffering
[1:38:05] violence and who was causing the
[1:38:08] violence the
[1:38:11] crown and the
[1:38:16] bow and then Jesus
[1:38:19] says but where unto shall I liken this
[1:38:25] generation who has rejected the opening
[1:38:28] of the first
[1:38:32] seal who refu who refuses to see the
[1:38:35] Elijah
[1:38:39] Ministry that has introduced me the Lamb
[1:38:42] of God to you the people of
[1:38:47] Israel so now what but where unto shall
[1:38:50] I liken this generation that has
[1:38:52] rejected
[1:38:55] me that that's rejected the
[1:38:59] opening of the Lamb's Book of
[1:39:02] Life because the Lamb's Book of
[1:39:05] Life is is a book of
[1:39:12] life and the Old
[1:39:14] Testament was a book of
[1:39:17] death you say a book of death
[1:39:24] isn't wasn't that the penalty for almost
[1:39:26] everything they
[1:39:29] did Death you have a rebellious
[1:39:35] son bring him to the
[1:39:39] elders what do you do with him
[1:39:43] then we're going to Stone him and you
[1:39:46] the father will throw the first
[1:39:50] stone but this was the Lamb's Book of
[1:39:53] Life that Jesus had given to
[1:39:57] Israel the first born
[1:40:00] son but the firstborn
[1:40:05] rejected the firstborn
[1:40:10] rejected This Book of
[1:40:15] Life remember Joseph Crossing his
[1:40:19] hands
[1:40:24] it
[1:40:25] represented that at the cross of
[1:40:28] Jesus on that crucifixion
[1:40:32] day The Inheritance that belonged to
[1:40:37] Israel that the inheritance L belonged
[1:40:40] to is would be given to a gentile
[1:40:45] people that's what those two boys
[1:40:49] represented Joseph two
[1:40:54] sons the oldest
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:40:59] church and the younger church right
[1:41:03] now and this Lamb's Book of
[1:41:07] Life would be given to the younger
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:15] Church the bride of
[1:41:18] Christ on the day of Pentecost
[1:41:21] and Jesus as he's speaking and teaching
[1:41:26] this he says but where unto shall I
[1:41:28] liken this
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:31] generation it's like unto
[1:41:34] children sitting in the
[1:41:37] markets and calling unto their
[1:41:40] fellows saying we have piped unto
[1:41:45] you and you have not
[1:41:47] danced we have more done to you
[1:41:51] and you have not
[1:41:53] lamented we're doing certain
[1:41:56] things and you're not responding the way
[1:41:59] you should respond to
[1:42:02] us what in the world makes you
[1:42:13] tick why are you so different than the
[1:42:16] rest of
[1:42:19] us then he
[1:42:25] says for
[1:42:30] John let me catch that
[1:42:38] part for John came neither eating nor
[1:42:44] drinking and they say he hath a
[1:42:48] devil and the same people people and the
[1:42:52] same
[1:42:55] church say the son of man came eating
[1:42:58] and
[1:43:01] drinking and they say Behold a man
[1:43:04] gluttonous and a wine
[1:43:08] beber a friend of publicans and
[1:43:11] sinners but wisdom is Justified of her
[1:43:16] children the world will never accept
[1:43:19] you
[1:43:21] the world will always accuse
[1:43:25] you those who are religious and have not
[1:43:28] been born
[1:43:30] again you can't do anything to make them
[1:43:33] feel good about
[1:43:37] you because you've been born again of
[1:43:40] the Holy
[1:43:42] Spirit and there's another Spirit on
[1:43:46] them a spirit that would cause
[1:43:49] violence
[1:43:51] you see the
[1:43:53] difference in verse
[1:43:56] 20 then began he to upgrade the
[1:44:03] cities or scold them reprimand
[1:44:09] them then began he to upgade the cities
[1:44:12] wherein most of his mighty Works were
[1:44:14] done because they repented
[1:44:19] not
[1:44:26] and the Lamb's Book had opened up with
[1:44:28] this
[1:44:31] message and more would be
[1:44:34] added but it began with
[1:44:36] this
[1:44:38] repent and be
[1:44:42] baptized and you
[1:44:45] shall and you shall receive eternal
[1:44:49] life
[1:44:51] but he was speaking to all these
[1:44:54] cities because of all the mighty works
[1:44:57] that had been
[1:45:00] done and they repented
[1:45:03] not that's happened in our
[1:45:06] day when this gospel this message has
[1:45:08] gone around the
[1:45:10] world it's gone all through the United
[1:45:14] States it's gone to people that say
[1:45:17] they're in the
[1:45:19] message
[1:45:22] but they have not repented
[1:45:25] nonetheless and then Jesus says begins
[1:45:28] to name these cities verse 21 wo unto
[1:45:32] thee
[1:45:34] Chen wo unto
[1:45:37] thee for the mighty Works which were
[1:45:40] done in you had been done in Ty and
[1:45:45] sidon they would have repented long ago
[1:45:48] in sackcloth and Ashes
[1:45:57] what was Jesus telling us as time goes
[1:46:01] on the hearts of the people is becoming
[1:46:05] harder and
[1:46:07] harder because had I done these
[1:46:10] Works in these cities of the Old
[1:46:14] Testament they would have
[1:46:16] repented but I did them in your
[1:46:19] cities but I did these miracles in your
[1:46:23] churches and I sent a prophet unto
[1:46:27] you and you would not
[1:46:30] repent but I say unto you verse
[1:46:34] 22 it shall be more tolerable for Ty and
[1:46:37] siden at the day of judgment and for
[1:46:45] you then he goes on to speak of
[1:46:48] capernium and brings the same judg
[1:46:52] in verse
[1:46:54] 25 Jesus thanks the
[1:46:58] father that he has
[1:47:01] hidden the
[1:47:05] opening Jesus thanks the father that he
[1:47:08] has hidden the opening of the Lamb's
[1:47:10] Book of
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:19] Life the
[1:47:22] LI part one the first seal is
[1:47:27] loosed in verse
[1:47:30] 11 actually in the days of the ministry
[1:47:32] of John
[1:47:35] Elijah it's
[1:47:37] loosed from the wise and prudent of this
[1:47:42] world the first seal was
[1:47:45] loosed but it's
[1:47:48] hidden from the wise and prudent of this
[1:47:53] world of the wise
[1:47:57] and but it but it's but it but is re but
[1:48:01] he is revealing
[1:48:03] it but he is revealing
[1:48:06] it to those who are now being born
[1:48:15] again and entering into a personal
[1:48:19] relationship
[1:48:23] personal
[1:48:28] relationship
[1:48:30] Rel with the father in verse 25 Jesus
[1:48:36] said at that time Jesus answered and
[1:48:39] said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[1:48:43] Heaven and Earth because thou has hid
[1:48:45] these things from the wise and prudent
[1:48:49] and has revealed them
[1:48:51] unto those who are now being born
[1:48:56] again
[1:49:00] babes then he
[1:49:02] says this message that I've preached on
[1:49:04] the first
[1:49:07] seal this message that I preached part
[1:49:09] one of
[1:49:12] redemption this message of opening up
[1:49:15] the Lamb's Book of
[1:49:18] Life and everything that I just said he
[1:49:21] say even so father for so it seemed good
[1:49:26] in thy
[1:49:29] sight every message I've
[1:49:33] preached every message that I've
[1:49:38] preached in
[1:49:42] Parables those are the
[1:49:44] ones that only the born again can
[1:49:49] understand
[1:49:51] then he says all things are delivered
[1:49:53] unto me of my father verse
[1:49:56] 27 and no man knoweth the son but the
[1:50:01] father neither knoweth any man the
[1:50:03] father save the
[1:50:05] son then how will we ever know
[1:50:09] them he he said he said he he says no
[1:50:11] man knoweth the son but the
[1:50:15] father no man know the son but the
[1:50:19] father
[1:50:21] verse 27 okay and no man knoweth the son
[1:50:25] but the
[1:50:33] father neither knoweth any man the
[1:50:35] father save the
[1:50:38] son and he to whomsoever the son will
[1:50:41] reveal
[1:50:42] him there it is a a time of
[1:50:47] Revelation like never was before
[1:50:51] and you must be born
[1:50:53] again Jesus told
[1:50:57] Nicodemus unless you're born
[1:51:00] again you cannot
[1:51:02] see
[1:51:05] understand the Kingdom of Heaven won't
[1:51:07] be revealed to
[1:51:11] you the Lamb's Book of Life won't
[1:51:16] open if you're not born
[1:51:18] again you can't know the
[1:51:21] son or the
[1:51:24] father or the king of the Jews or the
[1:51:27] Lamb of God you won't know who's
[1:51:30] what you won't know who you
[1:51:34] are to know who they
[1:51:37] are in verse 28 he
[1:51:40] says come unto me all ye that labor and
[1:51:43] are heavy
[1:51:48] laden and I will give you you
[1:51:51] rest take my yoke upon
[1:51:54] you and learn of
[1:51:57] me what was this
[1:51:59] yoke it was a learning
[1:52:03] time what was this
[1:52:05] yoke it was a teaching
[1:52:08] time for who he said for
[1:52:13] you and what I'm going to teach you is
[1:52:16] this I'm going to start by telling you
[1:52:21] I am meek and lonly in
[1:52:26] heart are
[1:52:31] you am
[1:52:34] I and if you
[1:52:39] are you shall find rest unto your
[1:52:43] souls because you won't become part of
[1:52:45] that
[1:52:48] generation
[1:52:50] of the
[1:52:52] violent you won't be a
[1:52:55] religious and you won't be a
[1:52:59] politician you'll be a son and daughter
[1:53:01] of
[1:53:02] God meek and lowly in
[1:53:08] heart and your souls will find
[1:53:12] rest in
[1:53:15] Jesus then he
[1:53:17] says because he knew your question
[1:53:21] but won't it be hard to serve you in
[1:53:23] this wicked
[1:53:29] generation and he tells you listen
[1:53:34] close he says my yoke is
[1:53:38] easy verse 30 my yoke is
[1:53:43] easy the Yoke of Satan is
[1:53:48] hard
[1:53:50] because if you get
[1:53:52] married you'll be
[1:53:56] divorced if you drink too much you'll be
[1:53:59] an
[1:54:00] alcoholic if you start doing drugs and
[1:54:03] get
[1:54:04] addicted that'll kill you that yoke is
[1:54:11] hard that yoke will make you an
[1:54:13] Unfaithful
[1:54:16] husband that yoke will make you an
[1:54:19] unfaith ful
[1:54:23] wife that yoke will make you a
[1:54:25] rebellious
[1:54:28] child that joke will make you a
[1:54:31] rebellious young person in the
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:54:38] home that yoke is a hard life to
[1:54:43] live that's not the Yoke of the Holy
[1:54:47] Spirit that's not the Yoke of a born
[1:54:49] again
[1:54:51] person because the Yoke of God it's
[1:54:58] easy and the burden I will place on
[1:55:02] you it's
[1:55:04] light it's
[1:55:07] light so right
[1:55:09] now your burden feels way too
[1:55:14] heavy and your yoke is feeling way too
[1:55:18] hard
[1:55:23] I say go to
[1:55:26] Jesus I say go to
[1:55:29] Jesus on Your
[1:55:32] Knees and and say Lord I know I'm
[1:55:35] carrying things that I shouldn't
[1:55:42] carry would you take them
[1:55:45] off would you loose me of these heavy
[1:55:48] burden
[1:55:51] and give me your
[1:55:54] yoke and give me your
[1:56:00] burden for your yoke is
[1:56:04] easy and your burden is
[1:56:08] light so when it gets too
[1:56:11] heavy know that the
[1:56:15] devil has placed a burden on
[1:56:18] you
[1:56:20] and you need to recognize
[1:56:23] it so you can ask
[1:56:27] Jesus this serving you seems way too
[1:56:35] hard then what you
[1:56:37] need is another
[1:56:41] refilling of the Holy
[1:56:44] Ghost to loose
[1:56:46] you of that yoke and that heavy
[1:56:52] burden and take the Yoke of
[1:56:55] Jesus for his
[1:56:57] yoke is
[1:57:03] easy and his burden that he places on
[1:57:08] you is
[1:57:12] light not only light as not
[1:57:17] heavy but light as in
[1:57:22] loose loose
[1:57:24] loose loose loose
[1:57:28] loose my burden is easy my yoke is
[1:57:33] easy and my burden is the light of the
[1:57:37] Holy
[1:57:40] Ghost my burden is the pillar of
[1:57:45] fire you don't carry
[1:57:47] that it carries you you through every
[1:57:51] hard
