thank him tonight we want to continue praying for our brother Glenn tamlins tamlins tamson uh my son-in-law Ruben's dad and uh also for Reuben Candice and and their familyben C I believe some of his other brothers and sisters have been coming into town flying in so we'll keep lifting them up asking God to be with them and and God's will be done because we we pray for God to give us an answer in all our troubles and our trials and a prophet told us always remember this that when God gives you his answer whether it's a yes or a no it's still the perfect will of God even his nose is God's Will and it as much thus sayith the Lord to your life a no as a yes and a no doesn't mean he's with you no no if you pray and he answers that means you're still on talking terms with him that means you can still have a you're having a conversation with him that means he finds you worthy to give you an answer so his yeses are as good as his nose and his NOS are as good as his yes because it's an answer from God he hears us and he answers tonight we'd like to continue on part seven speaking on Jesus evangelist Prophet Lamb of God and we'll turn to Matthew chapter 1 and verse one the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham and it goes on telling us Abraham begot Isaac Isaac begot Jacob Jacob begat Judas and his Brethren you'll notice that the first one it mentions in this genealogy of Jacob is Judas and yet Judas was not his firstborn but he mentions Judas because that's the tribe that he's going to follow in the genealogy all the members that are being spoken of here is is of the tribe of Judah because he's line because the holy spirit is lining this all up and the the point of highlighting the tribe of Judah is to tell you that this Jesus that it's coming is now is the lion of the tribe of Judah and now that places him in a prophetic role this this this baby that's going to be born of this Virgin Mary she's bringing forth the woman's seed which woman the bride of Christ his church his body that is the woman and this is her seed Jesus Christ the son of God the Lamb of God let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you ask your blessings upon your word in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated as we've tried to background almost each Service uh chapter 4 as you remember was Jesus beginning his ministry as an evangelist praying for the sick when he came on the scene John the Baptist was also on the scene already he had already been introducing him he'd been preparing the ground to receive this seed and the ground he was [Music] preparing was the hearts of the people he was preaching things in a way that they've never heard this style of preaching before he was calling them out to repent the the the scribes the the the Levites they never called people out to repent no if they came to your house and knocked it was to bring judgment on you because you they had found you guilty of something in the law they didn't preach repentance they brought judgment but John came with a very different Ministry it was strange to Israel it was contrary to the to the Jewish religion the Levites didn't act this way the Levites didn't preach this way the Levites didn't have such a personal message for the people but John was the Forerunner to introduce this Lamb of God but before he came as Lamb of God he was really born upon the Earth as king of the Jews you remember in the scripture the Bible said as the Magi came before Herod we've been following a star that was John in the first coming we've been following a star that was a Prophet Elijah William brandham in the second coming and that star when it finally disappears we believe we'll be in the presence of the king that star is leading us to this man to this King to this savior to this Divine one that was the reason for the star for running that these three Magi would be coming and they're looking for this King so Jesus came upon the Earth he was born they said where is he that's been born King of the Jews and they found him in Bethlehem in Matthew chapter 4 Jesus begins his ministry as an evangelist praying for the sick first a few came then hundreds came then thousands came then there was a masses multitudes of people and being healed of all different diseases in MA in Matthew Chapter 5 the Evangelist Min Ministry takes a little change and now this evangelist is is is is displaying a Teaching Ministry in chapter five and his teaching is on Perfection but Perfection is the end goal eternal life walking in the presence of of the king himself Eternal beings with with so chapter five six and seven of the Book of Matthew Jesus is teaching onction in chapter8 he falls back into his Evangelistic role emphasizing for the people to have faith giving examples who can I make an example for for the Israel to see and while he's yet talking a centurion he says excuse me he's all dressed up in his in his Roman Roman armors he says I'm a Roman Centurion but one of my servants is very sick if he he says he's dying as a matter of fact he says but if you just speak the word he'll live he says no I'll go with you to see him I'll do as I've been doing for the Jewish people I'll lay my hand on him he says you don't have to do that not you maybe some other evangelist but you're different you just speak the word he said I'm a man with great Authority and and I can look in a crowd of people and see who the people of authority are in that crowd you don't have to tell me I can feel Authority in the air and you've got it all you have to do is speak and when I get back home he'll be healed Jesus said I've not seen Faith Like This in Israel no not in Israel no chapter 8 the Evangelist urging the people to have [Music] faith he he he's he's trying to get the people to have faith encouraging them to Faith but then he does something else they are in awe that he could speak sicknesses out of the bodies of human beings there they're in awe that he even raised the dead gyus daughter they were in awe that he could cleanse a leper they said wow what a manow but then he's on a ship with his disciples and a storm raises up a storm that has these men of the sea scared these seamen experienced they practically been born on the sea but the storm is so harsh so great they're they're fearful and but Jesus was in the ship they said he was asleep but we know that he neither sleeps nor Slumbers he was testing his children he wasn't worried he's in he's got every situation in full control even if he didn't tell you he does he still does you're not sure he does he is sure he does and they wake him and he speaks to the storm and the Sea and the wind OB Bas him this took them to another level they said wow wow I knew he could heal sickness and speak to demon powers that speak back to you but but how do you control something that doesn't speak that you can't touch that you only feel he spoke to the storm this was the king of the Jews who had descended down to lower Ministries to get closer to his people to display his power to display his mercy and his grace [Music] he wanted you and he wanted to do things in your life to teach you and me how to trust him than Lord so chapter 5 6 and 7 Jesus the teacher chapter four the Evangelist in chapter eight he once more enters into the Evangelistic Ministry trying to lift up the faith of the people to believe him so when the time comes that he brings them the word of God the word that will change their lives but a word that is that will seem so strange and radical to them that he wants to capture their hearts so they won't be scared to reach out and get a hold of the promises of God and how their lives can be changed when he starts speaking to them about supernatural things of a born again experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost of a fire that can cleanse you from the bottom of your feet the top of your head begin speaking this way he's trying to raise up their faith so that when they believe that he could heal they'll believe this part too of how he can heal the soul not just the body that will perish Jesus the Evangelist the teacher not only heals the not only raises the dead but he speaks to the wind and the Sea obey him in chapter nine he Jesus does two things number one he forgives sins he'd not done that before and number two he knows the thoughts of the scribes which is a characteristic of a prophetic Ministry it's the characteristic by which Israel would know when Messiah comes that he would know the thoughts and intents of the hearts of so now this Jesus of Nazareth in chapter n his ministry is unfolding to fulfill all that the prophets have spoken which is really what God had spoken through the through the mouthpiece of men whom he ordained anointed to speak these prophecies so in chapter nine this Jesus who was born King of the Jews is beginning to unfold Divine characteristics so the king had descended to be an evangelist what man natural man born a king would want to make his first role in life an evangelist a servant to the people who who would do that who could humble himself from the from the throne as a king and descend down to serve Humanity what king could do this God Alone that was the love of God that brought him down he came down Jesus born King of the Jews he came down with a book in his hand that was sealed and this Jesus was going to start unfolding this book to Israel the king descended to be evangelist to be teacher to be prophet and now the Lamb of God in chapter nine he forgives sins it is something that no man could do immediately when he when he when he told this leper your sins are forgiven all the religious people scribes that were there they said blasphemy only God can forgive sins yes that's it he was God he was the Lamb of God he was the sacrifice for sin his blood would wash us clean why sow right the lamb Ministry come into play unfold a new testament had begun unfolding from this book called the Lamb's Book of Life isn't that how Matthew 1:1 started book of the generation of Jesus Christ for you to better understand that statement I'll say it this way the book of The Life and family of Daniel fro that would be the book of my generation with stories and pictures in it that's what was unfolding here but this book of this generation of Jesus Christ generation comes from the word Gene seed children so this is the book of the children of the family of Jesus Christ so this is the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ this is the Lamb's Book of Life this is his book unfolding it's not an abstract somewhere no but because our eyes were blinded no because we were born in spiritual Amnesia we packed it in our arms for many years and we didn't know what we were hold B it's your family book it's your family tree I'm visiting with a pastor one time and he's relating a little bit of his past his family so I tell them I'll tell you a little bit of my family of all my brothers and sisters they've all been to prison federal prison matter of fact they were all killed even my sisters were in prison he says you got to be kidding me true every last one of them from the oldest to the youngest he said every every one of them wound up in prison one of them they even hung him upside down I said my brother Peter I told him he goes wait a minute brother Daniel you're just kidding with me I said I'm not kidding they really did hang my brother Peter upside down because this is my book this is my family this is the men that women that died their lives for this gospel this is the Lamb's Book of Life you and I are all his sheep his lamb that's what a born again experience does for you that makes an old sheep a new lamb because you've been born again God rich in Mercy the king descended to be evangelist to be a teacher to be a prophet to be the Lamb of God and from Matthew 1 to chapter n this child fulfilled all of these roles unfolding them but as he went from one Ministry to the next he never lost that Ministry that Ministry just became a minor and the next level was a major to be the Lamb of God did he still have the power in the office as Lamb of God to reach over and touch someone and say nothing and they were healed never Lo never lost it he has that power yet today and he wants to to work that gift in you and I that we can reach out by faith and some Lord got a terrible flu healed them not a big show just power and control through the character of Jesus Christ in you and I in Matthew 10 remember Jesus he begins placing this New Testament Church in order an arm is being built of men just like him called men of God and yet all that were called were not all called to the same Ministry to the same end they didn't all use the gift of God in the correct way because out of 12 one was a Judas you know Judas also was given a gift of healing to pray for the sick he had a gift in his life he'd been called of God chapter 10 God is setting this New Testament Church placing the order and the first thing he does is he places the ministry in order the ministers their lives must be in order because they're going to be servants to God's children not Lords over them they're to serve the people that has become a strange concept today but it wasn't when God established when Jesus established this new testament chur it wasn't that way he called Simon Andrew James John Philip phip Thomas Thomas Matthew m j s lius Simon the Canaanite and Judas scari and he said these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying Matthew 105 go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans it was prophecy being fulfilled because the Old Testament prophecy the metaphor the type the shadow is is is that the firstborn to him belonged all of his father's riches so to so to keep within the boundaries of his own word he first came to Israel the eldest Church to to give to them the Lamb's Book of Life to give to open to them this book and reveal to them the seven parts of a plan of a divine plan to restore Israel to save Israel to heal Israel to gather all the Jewish people and they rejected that plan it was called the seven seal plan of the Lamb of God written in the Lamb's Book of Life what they rejected was the Lamb's Book of Life what they rejected was the opening of this book what they re rejected was the revelation of these seven parts of one divine plan that would have saved them that would have given them back their land that would have healed all the nation this what they rejected and when they rejected at the cross of calv that's what Jacob's hands represented when he was praying for Joseph's two sons he crossed his hands and put his right hand on the younger son and he gave the younger son the firstborn blessing and a prophet tells us you know what that meant I didn't know I read it many times as my mom had read it to me many times it I didn't understand it it was just a story like Red Riding Hood in the wolf like the SE the seven dwarfs and Snow White and those two were kind of mysterious to me as a kid that didn't make sense to me either I was struggling as a boy books in general but this book be understood a revelation and the Revelation came one day that that that that that Jacob the crossing of his arms represented the cross of Calvary and that day on Calvary when this the king of the Jews would hang on the cross and everything he had offered to Israel that they had rejected would be given to you and I a gentile bride and he wouldn't return to the Jews till he's 100% done with you you're saying what's going to happen brother Daniel all this war in the Middle East Israel is fighting a a war on almost every border what's what's happening is that God is working on you and I and until he's done with you and me don't worry about Israel the time piece the prophet tolds many times you know what you want to know what day it is look and see Israel and Israel's been in her Homeland since 1946 and the unbeliever say you see nothing is happening 1946 to now Israel's in her Homeland where's the coming of the lord it's because they don't know the scripture turn with me in MA to Matthew 24 we're going to jump little bit out of our subject here and yet it all ties together a prophet when he preached The Sixth Seal he said I'm going to do something different because I want you to open your Bibles to Matthew 24 and then I also want you to open your Bibles to Revelations chapter 6 and Revelations chapter 6 is the first six seals he said I'm going to show you how Jesus preached the seals in Matthew 24 in a parable and he starts going down tying them together I won't do that tonight we'll do it for you another day BR it all together but in Matthew 24 in verse two he says and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily I say unto there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when these things shall be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world then in Matthew 24 and the 4th verse he begins to unfold it reads a couple of verses he that's the first seal and he goes down down the verses and and as he keeps going down the verses SE is is is telling us more and it gets longer the verses for each but when he gets into Matthew 24 and 14 so Jesus is preaching these Seven Seals to Israel and then in verse 14 he says and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come ask yourself now what was the Gospel that he was preaching when he made this statement he was bringing the Revelation the teaching of let's read it again and this and this teaching of the Seven Seals shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all the nations and then shall the End come so just to see Israel in the Homeland it it it it does reveal that they were living when you see Israel in her Homeland and that God sent a prophet and in 1963 the gospel of these Seven Seals was preached from 1963 to 1965 you say no no brother Daniel no it was it was just eight days and 10 Services it it wasn't didn't go all the way to 65 no no March 1963 he preached the Seven Seals and he didn't stop the Holy Spirit didn't stop opening the book to us till he said the last thing that he had to say in 1965 now this gospel these Seven Seals he says and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations then shall the End come the year is 2023 2024 and this gospel is just barely making its way around the world I mean the Revelation the truth is just making its way around the world so what was Redemption for Israel waiting for since 1946 for this to take place the revelation of the Seven Seals seven parts of a divine plan to rescue and save and change you and I the Bride of Jesus Christ the younger son to whom at the cross of C was given the the the lion shared to the hallelujah hallelujah this Lamb of God Matthew 10 God setting the church in order choosing the ministry giving them gifts to do what he did for the works that he did would this new ministry do they would pray they would preach the gospel their Ministries would change lives it would pull it would pull God's people out of dark denominationalism it would pull God's people out of legalism it would take away our arrogance it would give us meekness humility it would make us peacemakers instead of thinking I got to be a warrior and to be a warrior sometimes you got to be violent no no no no no no the law and the prophets were until John since then the Kingdom of Heaven is preached and the king of this kingdom is a peacemaker a matter of fact he's called The Prince of Peace his ways are not violence he changes people through a born again experience that's not available to legalist they can have it if they want but as long as you choose legalism you'll have a problem being born again you've got to mortify the Deeds of the flesh to man manifest the Deeds of the spirit Matthew 10 here he is the king of the Jews he entered into his lamb Ministry and as the Lamb of God he chooses 12 men to begin taking this preaching of the Gospel of the kingdom of heav to the Jewish people go only to the house of Israel go only to the eldest to the eldest son the first and when they reject it and he knew they would he showed it in a type Peter said I saw Jesus walk up to a fig tree it had many leaves it was it was Springtime all the trees were full of Liv and Jesus looked upon it and it looked like he was looking to see if there's any fruit on it he said and in my mind I thought well he won't find any the tree won't give fruit for a few more months it's not it's not time for it to give fruit yet but it's a but it's a beautiful tree leaves all over and then Jesus looked at the tree and he said you have no fruit on you and he cursed the tree and the and the tree died immediately the tree was Israel the prophecy was for that day that Israel would not give fruit at the first coming of Christ she would die in her sins but and a New Testament Church would rise up and God would have a wife a gentile bride he would take the same gospel to Israel again but not until this gospel was preached the world over seven times around the world God sent a prophet to take a message opening the Lamb's Book to the people and there would be a little flock who would surrender their lives and in that surrender God would give us a revelation to live a better life to have a better hope to have a stronger faith to be changed Glory upon glory to be changed in every way in our nature our character as men and women as husbands and wives as fathers and children using the wisdom of God and the Very nature of the Holy Spirit we would deal and treat each other in the love of God with great Mercy Jesus preached it it was his teaching on Perfection he told us step by step the steps that it would take to make it into eternal life the king Matthew 1 to10 he goes from being a child being born the king of the Jews drops down into this Earth and begins unfolding a Ministry a Ministry like the world has never known the second Adam the king says I'll be an evangelist first a teacher a prophet and a lamb of God by chapter n Jesus had entered in his prophetic ministry as Lamb of God one who could forgive sins in chapter 10 he sets the church in order he calls a Ministry to get ready then he starts unfolding in Matthew 11 this Lamb of God begins a teaching Matthew 11:1 and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his 12 disciples of putting the ministry in order for the church you see he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ this anointed man he sent two of his disciples and he said unto them art thou he that should come or do we look for another John was in prison John was locked up [Music] John John was just days away from being beheaded John wasn't feeling too good he was struggling as they say today his PTSD was kicking in he was in post he was in post stress traumatic syndrome he had been rejected by Israel now he was in prison because he had preached to Herod the truth of marriage and divorce and he said Herod publicly it ain't you it ain't right for you to take your brother's wife divorce doesn't make her your wife this is wrong and herod's new wife didn't like that and they had him imprisoned and he sitting there it's the end of his ministry he's not in prison because he couldn't escape he's in prison because he's fulfilled his ministry and God has taking him home for no man had power over John as long as God needed him yet and when God was done with him he he drew back his power he said John I'm going to bring you home no more suffering no more pain no more rejection the ministry is been hard on your life but fear not you'll suffer no more but as a man he was still in his mind troubled did I do the right thing am I really a prophet is my cousin who six months younger than me could he really be Messiah all these thoughts are going through this poor man's head and he sends two of his disciples now when John had now when John verse 4 Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see he didn't say has John lost all his Revelation what's wrong with John no he didn't say that no no cuz he knew who John was he was the Forerunner he was Elijah his present struggle did not anal the ministry that God had given him Jesus said Go and show John again those things which you hear and see that you've seen in this in in the healing campaigns the blind receive their sight it happened in our generation the lame walk it happened in our generation the lepers are cleansed and the deaf here it happened in our generation the dead are raised up happened in our generation and the poor have the gospel preach to them these Seven Seals and blessed is he because he was speaking to a multitude of people whosoever shall not be offended me because he was Discerning the people the crowd in front of him and as he was preaching on this the people were being offended he's talking about himself they said I think he means him he did mean him and he discerns the hearts of the people he said and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went you out to the Wilderness to see a read shaken with the wind but what went you out to see a man clothed in soft rment in Matthew 11 the lamb is opening the first seal and it's a Teaching Ministry that's what the prophecy said turn with me to Revelations Revelations apocalypsis chapter 6 and verse one Revelations 6 and 1 is Matthew 11 this is the prophecy Matthew 11 is where it happened is where this unfolded reality and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals in Matthew 11 and I heard as it were the noise of [Music] Thunder a prophet told us what is a thunder a thunder is the voice of God when a seal is open so the lamb opening and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals he saw the lamb a lamb open one of the seals and he and he heard and this opening had the sound of a Thunder God doubly vindicating that a thunder is the voice of God meaning the seal is opened and one of the four be saying come and see it doesn't say here that he was opening the first seal it says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seal so how do we know this was the first seal because in verse three it says this and when he had opened the second seal oh don't you love the way God writes his book if you put a period right there and say I'm not reading no more you're putting a period on God being able to reveal to you his gospel his word we can never put a period must always put a comma because it's an eternal book this Lamb's Book of Life when we keep reading that's when we realize that verse one was the first seal and one of the four be saying it doesn't tell us which one of the four beast but in the chapters prior it tells us which one was the first turn with me to Genesis chapter 4 Revelations chapter 4 Revelations chapter 4 is a scene of the Throne of God but but on this scene you go back and read the whole chapter you'll realize there's no lamb on the altar in this in in this part of the scrip in this Throne no lamb no blood that means Redemption is over and you've been reading the message you've heard where brother Brandon reads Revelations 41 he says and after after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven John speaking and the first voice which I heard was it is it worth of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in and one sat on the throne brother brandham says John is a type of the bride and this is the rapture taking place so what follows the bride who was he says and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was s set in heaven and one sat on the throne a raptured bride a wise virgin will sit on the throne with the king of kings and judge the whole world this is that Throne that's why there's no blood on this Throne because this is the white Throne Judgment at the end of time in verse S it begins to describe these living creatures each one represents the ministry of almighty God through seven Church ages just like the just like those four horses represent the ministry of Lucifer through seven Church ages he said and the first Beast was like a lion there's the answer to revelation 61 of who was that Beast say and I 61 I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four be saying come and see that Beast was the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah the lamb opened the Lamb's Book but under the ministry of The Lion King of the Jews because he had just told his his Apostles only to the house of Israel so as the lamb he must open the book but as the lion he does the Lion's part King of the Jews and offers Israel this book of redemption in Matthew 11 the first seal opens as we stand to our feet tonight Jesus born King of the Jews now we see him his his divine nature unfolding evangelist teacher Prophet Lamb of God but he was born King of the Jews and he opened this book and these Seven Seals to Israel and when they rejected this great inheritance to be the wife of the Lamb then at the cross of Calvary this inheritance went to you and I the younger Church a New Testament Church a gentile people pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord to see your word unfolding to see how perfectly it's written to be able to follow the mind of Christ and if this mind be in you it was told us it will Quicken your
