[25:56] song
[26:01] the trial of this world was getting
[26:08] closer the pull I fell was more than I
[26:13] could
[26:16] bear and when I was on the verge of
[26:21] giving
[26:25] over the strength Within in myself just

[27:54] trial thatting me constantly
[27:59] giving me
[28:02] Victory he's a
[28:05] reality cuz something keeps holding
[28:13] me there is none like
[28:21] you and no one else can touch my heart
[28:26] like you do
[28:30] and I can search for all
[28:34] eternity
[28:36] long and
[28:38] find there is none like
[28:46] you oh there is none like
[28:55] you and no one El else can touch my
[28:59] heart like you
[29:03] do and I can search for all

[29:51] [Music]
[29:55] you amen
[29:58] you believe that that there is nothing
[30:01] like him you know there's many things
[30:04] that can touch your heart that can bring
[30:06] you
[30:07] Joy but when the Creator comes in your
[30:11] midst
[30:12] amen there's something about it that you
[30:15] can be
[30:16] anywhere you can be in your closet you
[30:18] can be in your backyard cutting your
[30:20] grass or on a roof you can be anywhere
[30:24] and the Creator will just come down
[30:28] and touch your
[30:29] heart and no one could ever touch your
[30:32] heart like
[30:33] that many things can touch our heart but
[30:36] when Jesus touches the
[30:39] heart it's something totally different
[30:41] that we can't
[30:43] explain
[30:45] amen but what we can do is just give

[47:52] presence let's begin this
[47:54] year
[47:56] with this
[47:58] desire Lord give me more

[48:17] vacation Lord give me more
[48:21] moments where I get lost in your
[48:24] presence tonight we begin this
[48:29] year speaking uh on a on a
[48:34] title
[48:36] Jesus
[48:38] evangelist prophet and mighty
[48:44] Angel turn with me to Matthew chapter
[48:54] 4
[48:56] Matthew chapter
[48:58] 4 begins with the temptation of
[49:03] Jesus on Mount
[49:05] Temptation Jesus is led up by the
[49:10] spirit Into the
[49:12] Wilderness to be tempted of the
[49:16] devil now he had fasted for 40 days and
[49:19] 40
[49:22] nights as as a physical man the Bible
[49:25] says was a
[49:29] hungered great
[49:31] hunger great
[49:34] thirst then the tap then the tempter
[49:37] came to
[49:39] him but the tempter approached
[49:43] him thinking he would use the same
[49:50] method that he used on Adam and
[49:54] Eve
[49:56] and that is he used
[49:59] scripture but he twisted
[50:02] it he changed that one little
[50:05] word he he shares a portion to the
[50:12] comma but wouldn't read Beyond
[50:15] it that's why we must be Bible
[50:20] readers so that when the devil is trying
[50:23] to give you a scripture
[50:27] and he puts a period where there where
[50:29] the Bible has a
[50:33] comma you can catch who it is that's
[50:35] trying to talk to
[50:38] [Music]
[50:39] you because he too uses the same methods
[50:42] he's always used since the
[50:48] beginning and he
[50:50] began with
[50:52] Jesus he looks at him he says this man
[50:56] is
[50:58] hungry very
[51:00] hungry so I'm going to start there with
[51:03] him and in verse three he said if thou
[51:06] be the Son of God command that these
[51:09] Stones be made
[51:16] bread let's pray Heavenly Father we
[51:21] thank
[51:21] you for we realize that your Hebrews 13
[51:24] and8
[51:28] the same yesterday today and
[51:31] forever and we also realize that the
[51:37] devil he repeats the way he's always
[51:40] worked since the
[51:44] beginning and Open the Eyes of our
[51:49] understanding that we'll see when it's
[51:51] the devil
[51:54] talking and Lord catch when it's your
[51:57] Holy Spirit speaking to us
[52:02] too we thank you now continue to Open
[52:06] the Eyes of
[52:09] understanding in Jesus name amen amen
[52:13] you may be
[52:14] seated in verse
[52:16] four the Bible said but he answered and
[52:20] said it is written man shall not live by
[52:23] bread alone but by every word that
[52:25] proceedeth out of the mouth of
[52:35] God so Satan recited a portion of the
[52:42] scripture but then God took him back to
[52:44] the original word The Original
[52:52] Seed and he told them but but man shall
[52:55] not live by bread
[53:00] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[53:03] out of the mouth of
[53:07] God Satan told him if thou be the Son of
[53:12] God the very way he answered
[53:16] him proved that he was the son of
[53:19] God that he was the word made
[53:23] flesh but the devil wasn't
[53:27] done he had took one shot at
[53:32] him then the devil taketh him up into
[53:35] the holy city and Seth him on a pinnacle
[53:37] of the
[53:43] temple and then again he says if thou be
[53:46] the Son of
[53:50] God in other words even though God even
[53:53] though Jesus had quoted him the word
[53:56] exactly and stayed on the
[54:01] word Satan was Satan wasn't
[54:06] convinced he said that doesn't prove to
[54:08] me that you're the Son of
[54:11] God if you're the Son of
[54:14] God cast thyself
[54:18] down who who who would listen to anyone
[54:21] that says if if you're who you say you
[54:23] are throw yourself off this Cliff
[54:27] [Music]
[54:33] here and then he says for it is
[54:38] written he shall give his angels car
[54:41] charge concerning thee and in their
[54:43] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[54:46] any time thy Dash thy foot against a
[54:54] stone
[54:59] it it was a
[55:01] prophecy of the
[55:03] prophets but it wasn't the
[55:07] prophecy so so it so that Jesus could be
[55:17] Reckless
[55:23] Reckless no No No
[55:33] Reckless he said so he saids so the
[55:38] scripture wasn't
[55:40] written so that we could tempt
[55:44] God no the scripture was
[55:47] written so that when trouble
[55:52] strikes when Trouble Comes
[55:57] you'll know that he'll be on the scene
[55:59] to protect you to lift you up to watch
[56:02] over
[56:08] you it's like those
[56:12] Cults P Pentecostal
[56:16] groups that that would actually in their
[56:19] services have deadly vipers in their
[56:23] hands
[56:34] poisonous
[56:38] snakes and they would handle
[56:42] them in the in in the front of the
[56:45] service and they still do it
[56:50] today and they quote Mark
[56:53] 16 they shall take up deadly
[56:57] serpents and it shall not harm
[56:59] them but the prophecy
[57:03] wasn't so we could be so we could be
[57:06] Reckless and tempt
[57:14] God no that's not where the prophecy was
[57:20] given no the prophecies were of the word
[57:23] of God were given
[57:27] so that by faith we could be
[57:30] assured that when trouble
[57:34] strikes when the devil brings a
[57:38] Temptation that God has promised that
[57:40] he'd be with you even in you at that
[57:47] moment Jesus said unto
[57:51] him it is written
[57:53] again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[57:59] God so Jesus is telling
[58:02] us that the that the Prophecies of the
[58:07] prophets where we're promis
[58:12] protection where where we are promised
[58:20] protection he it's not those prophecies
[58:24] are not given to us to tempt
[58:28] God those prophecies are given so that
[58:31] our faith can hold on to that
[58:38] prophecy so that our faith can anchor on
[58:43] something he said by my stripes you are
[58:50] healed he didn't say it so you could go
[58:55] go
[58:58] purposely and drink some kind of a
[59:02] poison to prove God but the prophecy is
[59:07] there so that if you were to drink
[59:10] something
[59:12] poisonous un knowing to
[59:17] yourself then God has made you a
[59:21] promise by his
[59:23] stripes
[59:25] we are
[59:27] healed again the devil taketh him up
[59:30] into an exceeding high
[59:34] mountain show them all the kingdoms of
[59:37] the world and Glory of
[59:42] them you see this
[59:45] tactic it worked in
[59:49] Eden and Eve fell to
[59:52] it and Adam fell to
[59:56] this this
[59:58] tactic worked for the prophet
[1:00:02] balam and he fell to this
[1:00:05] tactic so he figures I'll use it
[1:00:13] again and the devil say saith unto
[1:00:16] him all these things I will give thee if
[1:00:21] if thou will fall down and worship me
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:33] Jesus saith unto
[1:00:35] him get thee hands
[1:00:41] Satan see the devil kept telling him if
[1:00:44] thou be the Son of
[1:00:48] God if thou be the Son of
[1:00:51] God he wasn't sure but after the the
[1:00:54] third
[1:00:56] Temptation Jesus saith unto
[1:00:59] him he discerned exactly who he
[1:01:03] was he says get the hand
[1:01:07] Satan for it is written verse 10 Thou
[1:01:11] shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him
[1:01:14] only shalt thou
[1:01:19] serve the Bible says then the devil
[1:01:21] leaveth
[1:01:23] him
[1:01:25] Angels Came and ministered unto
[1:01:29] him there was going to be a change in
[1:01:32] his
[1:01:34] ministry you see he had been the son of
[1:01:36] a
[1:01:39] carpenter it was thought to be that
[1:01:41] Joseph was was his
[1:01:45] father he he was always an outstanding
[1:01:47] young
[1:01:50] man but now he was going to enter into a
[1:01:54] higher
[1:01:57] Ministry he was going to begin
[1:02:01] manifesting that he was the son of
[1:02:05] God and just and and and the
[1:02:07] manifestation of
[1:02:09] that was
[1:02:11] confirmed this ministerial
[1:02:14] change he says then the devil leaveth
[1:02:17] him and behold Angels Came and
[1:02:20] ministered unto
[1:02:23] him because he was now going to start
[1:02:26] fulfilling Bible
[1:02:30] prophecies he was now entering into his
[1:02:36] ministry and right about that
[1:02:40] time after this Mount
[1:02:44] Temptation no sooner had he come down
[1:02:46] off this
[1:02:53] mount
[1:02:55] and Jesus heard that John was cast into
[1:03:02] prison then he knew it was his
[1:03:06] time the timing was
[1:03:09] perfect everything was falling exactly
[1:03:12] into
[1:03:15] place the Bible says and leaving
[1:03:19] Nazareth verse 13 he came and dwelt in
[1:03:22] capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in
[1:03:24] the borders of Zebulon and
[1:03:34] neim that it might be fulfilled which
[1:03:37] was spoken by Isaiah the
[1:03:41] prophet now Bible
[1:03:45] prophecies are coming to pass one after
[1:03:49] another one on top of
[1:03:52] another malach 4 5 and
[1:03:56] 6 the first half had just finished
[1:04:00] coming to
[1:04:05] pass and as soon as it's
[1:04:09] fulfilled Jesus moves on the scene with
[1:04:11] his
[1:04:13] ministry because it was Bible it was a
[1:04:17] prophecy that had to come to pass even
[1:04:21] to the land that he
[1:04:23] went to zebon and
[1:04:26] Naim by the way of the sea Bible says
[1:04:30] Beyond
[1:04:31] Jordan it's at Galilee of the
[1:04:35] Gentiles these were two Gentile cities
[1:04:38] where he
[1:04:39] [Music]
[1:04:41] began he had begun as an
[1:04:44] evangelist he was going to do great
[1:04:46] Miracles and
[1:04:49] healings great healing
[1:04:52] campaigns and he began as an
[1:04:57] evangelist anyone could
[1:05:00] come
[1:05:02] anybody
[1:05:04] Jew
[1:05:05] Gentile sound of
[1:05:09] Mind demon
[1:05:12] possessed it didn't matter what church
[1:05:14] you belong
[1:05:16] to it didn't matter if you ever went to
[1:05:19] church or
[1:05:20] not this was the first poll of the of
[1:05:25] this
[1:05:26] evangelist Jesus of
[1:05:29] Nazareth and Jesus began to
[1:05:32] preach and to
[1:05:35] say exactly what John had been
[1:05:40] saying
[1:05:43] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:05:47] hand more would be
[1:05:51] added there's a comma here repent we
[1:05:55] just have to
[1:05:56] repent Comm he's going to add more as
[1:06:01] the word unfolds
[1:06:04] more and the Bible says in verse 18
[1:06:07] Jesus was walking by the Sea of
[1:06:11] Galilee he saw two
[1:06:13] Brethren Simon called Peter
[1:06:17] Andrew they were casting a net into the
[1:06:20] sea for obviously they were Fishers
[1:06:24] he saith unto them follow me and I'll
[1:06:26] make you Fishers of
[1:06:29] Men they didn't understand with that
[1:06:34] man but they followed him because they
[1:06:38] seen a powerful Ministry rising
[1:06:44] up and they straightway left their Nets
[1:06:46] and followed
[1:06:51] him and immediately he says he goes on a
[1:06:54] little
[1:06:56] further verse
[1:07:00] 21 and and and two other
[1:07:03] Brethren James the son of
[1:07:06] zebede and John his brother they were in
[1:07:09] a ship with their
[1:07:13] father they were mending their
[1:07:16] Nets and from there he called
[1:07:20] them they weren't in Bible
[1:07:22] School
[1:07:25] they they they they they weren't very
[1:07:26] good uh faithful Jewish
[1:07:32] boys because to be a fisherman in the
[1:07:34] days of
[1:07:36] Jesus was really considered a very low
[1:07:43] life he says and immediately says they
[1:07:45] left their ship and their father and
[1:07:47] followed
[1:07:52] him
[1:07:54] and then verse 23 says and Jesus went
[1:07:56] about all Gile Galilee teaching in their
[1:08:05] synagogues so as an
[1:08:10] evangelist who was who who was having
[1:08:12] who had a Healing
[1:08:15] Ministry all the churches wanted
[1:08:19] him the Baptist the Pentecostal the he
[1:08:23] could go amongst the Catholics in his
[1:08:26] early ministri in
[1:08:31] evangelist he was even welcome amongst
[1:08:33] the Jewish
[1:08:37] rabbis and he began preaching the gospel
[1:08:40] of the
[1:08:43] Kingdom the good
[1:08:45] news that Christ has
[1:08:49] come but he didn't identify himself as
[1:08:52] Christ yet
[1:08:55] and it says and and and healing all
[1:08:57] manner of sickness and all manner of
[1:09:00] disease among the
[1:09:02] people verse
[1:09:08] 2 so this young
[1:09:11] evangelist his Healing Ministry caught
[1:09:14] the attention of the
[1:09:20] people he healed all manner of
[1:09:22] sickness
[1:09:28] and healing all manner of sickness verse
[1:09:34] 23 and
[1:09:38] healing
[1:09:41] sicknesses a
[1:09:44] cold uh your joints are
[1:09:48] hurting many
[1:09:50] sicknesses and and all manner of
[1:09:52] diseases
[1:09:55] diabetes
[1:09:57] cancer uh
[1:09:59] tumors
[1:10:01] leprosy well this caused his Fame to go
[1:10:04] throughout all
[1:10:09] Syria verse
[1:10:11] 24 and they brought unto him all sick
[1:10:14] people that were taken with div diverse
[1:10:22] diseases
[1:10:27] so not only diseases but
[1:10:31] torments people tormented in their
[1:10:36] minds people tormented in their
[1:10:40] hearts people's emotional state in
[1:10:46] torment he he healed all of these
[1:10:49] troubles in the human
[1:10:52] race and those which were possessed with
[1:10:55] Devils the Bible
[1:10:58] says and those which were
[1:11:03] lunatic they'd get up one
[1:11:07] morning they'd shake your hand and say
[1:11:11] hello they'd
[1:11:14] smile then they go into the next
[1:11:18] room and they come back out the
[1:11:21] door they're not smiling no more
[1:11:24] now they're yelling at you now they're
[1:11:27] screaming at you now they're saying
[1:11:30] things that make no
[1:11:33] sense
[1:11:34] lunatic but he healed these types of
[1:11:37] people there was healing for
[1:11:41] them Bible says he healed
[1:11:44] them and there followed him great
[1:11:47] multitudes of
[1:11:48] people verse
[1:11:52] 25
[1:11:55] there followed him great multitudes of
[1:11:59] people because because of the
[1:12:02] healing of diverse
[1:12:05] diseases because of the to healing of
[1:12:08] the torments of
[1:12:10] mind because they saw those that were
[1:12:12] possessed with Devils
[1:12:18] delivered and they saw those that were
[1:12:20] lunatic come back to their senses
[1:12:26] they saw thousands
[1:12:29] healed why the campaigns would be eight
[1:12:32] nine 10,000 people multitude stood
[1:12:35] before
[1:12:39] him oh the Evangelist Jesus of
[1:12:45] Nazareth the
[1:12:47] Evangelist the
[1:12:48] Evangelist Jesus of Nazareth because he
[1:12:52] was healing the the
[1:12:54] people and because anyone who wanted to
[1:12:57] come could
[1:13:00] come he would say doesn't matter what
[1:13:02] church you belong
[1:13:05] to he would even say you don't even need
[1:13:07] to belong to a
[1:13:11] church if you can have
[1:13:13] faith your faith will heal
[1:13:17] you that was Jesus's first
[1:13:22] poll that was the first phase of his
[1:13:29] ministry at the first coming of
[1:13:32] Christ would that be how he would
[1:13:34] display himself in the second
[1:13:40] coming because he's Hebrews 13
[1:13:44] and8 the same yesterday today and
[1:13:48] forever in Matthew
[1:13:50] 5 Jesus Bible says and seeing the
[1:13:57] multitudes multitudes is thousands and
[1:14:00] thousands of
[1:14:02] people all waiting to be wanting to be
[1:14:05] prayed for
[1:14:08] also for healing for their physical
[1:14:10] bodies their
[1:14:14] ailment and the Bible says he went up
[1:14:16] into a
[1:14:19] mountain and he said and his disciples
[1:14:22] came unto him
[1:14:26] and this time he opened his
[1:14:29] mouth and taught
[1:14:31] them I don't bring you just healing for
[1:14:35] your
[1:14:37] body that was the first pull of the
[1:14:42] ministry but his ministry would have
[1:14:44] another another change in
[1:14:47] it his ministry would have a second
[1:14:52] phase so here Jesus went from just
[1:14:55] praying for the afflictions in the
[1:15:00] body so Jesus
[1:15:06] went to now praying for their for their
[1:15:13] afflictions of their
[1:15:15] mind
[1:15:16] Spirit teaching how to overcome their
[1:15:20] complexes of
[1:15:22] life
[1:15:25] passed on to
[1:15:27] them passed on to
[1:15:30] them by by their
[1:15:35] mothers by their mothers maybe their
[1:15:39] fathers maybe the lack of a mother maybe
[1:15:42] the lack of a
[1:15:44] father by their brothers by family
[1:15:47] members all these complexes of
[1:15:51] Life healing was going going to be not
[1:15:53] just for the physical
[1:15:58] body it was not just for the physical
[1:16:01] body it was going to be for the
[1:16:04] mind for the
[1:16:07] heart now he was speaking to them the
[1:16:10] ministry had now gone up a higher
[1:16:15] level but the people didn't understand
[1:16:18] it they wanted to see Miracles with
[1:16:21] their eyes
[1:16:24] they wanted to see Miracles that they
[1:16:26] could
[1:16:28] touch but Jesus wanted to take them
[1:16:32] higher increase their
[1:16:35] faith for more than just the healing of
[1:16:38] this
[1:16:41] body where are the thousands upon
[1:16:47] thousands
[1:16:48] where are the thousands and
[1:16:52] thousands that were
[1:16:54] healed in the
[1:16:56] ministry of William
[1:16:58] brandham not only William brandham Oral
[1:17:02] Roberts and many of the evangelists in
[1:17:04] that
[1:17:06] day they were healed of
[1:17:09] cancers they were healed of
[1:17:12] diabetes they were healed of the
[1:17:14] hundreds of disease that vexed the
[1:17:17] physical
[1:17:21] body were those
[1:17:23] that were that were brought back to life
[1:17:26] by the spoken
[1:17:28] word where are
[1:17:36] those I met a
[1:17:38] man his name was brother Edmund
[1:17:41] we Ed we an
[1:17:46] Englishman you you'll hear it on the
[1:17:50] tapes he was the brother that fell dead
[1:17:53] in the service in Jeffersonville
[1:17:58] Indiana his wife sister
[1:18:02] Ruth was a registered
[1:18:05] nurse he fell
[1:18:07] over she immediately went to check for
[1:18:10] his Vital
[1:18:14] Signs
[1:18:15] MH there was
[1:18:17] none his eyes had rolled black had
[1:18:20] rolled
[1:18:21] back there was no eye to look at it was
[1:18:24] all
[1:18:27] white and she said he's
[1:18:30] dead brother Bram says Be
[1:18:36] Still he says he says that if you do die
[1:18:40] there's no better place than in the
[1:18:41] church he
[1:18:46] said he was
[1:18:49] talking waiting to see how God would
[1:18:51] move him
[1:18:54] whether he would ask the deacons to pick
[1:18:56] the brother
[1:19:00] up or the Holy Spirit would tell him to
[1:19:03] go down
[1:19:05] there he got off the pulpit he walked
[1:19:11] down he went down where brother we was
[1:19:16] laying he says he realized he says now
[1:19:19] I've seen many people
[1:19:21] die
[1:19:24] and he says when your when your heart is
[1:19:30] shocked he says your the eyes will roll
[1:19:33] back just like brother WS
[1:19:38] were he realized he was
[1:19:42] dead and he prayed for him just
[1:19:46] then but he didn't pray a long long
[1:19:51] prayer he said
[1:19:53] brother way brother
[1:19:56] way and just a few seconds
[1:20:00] passed and the dead man
[1:20:04] said yes brother
[1:20:06] Bram the life had
[1:20:11] returned we met him back in the
[1:20:18] 70s
[1:20:20] uh he was very much alive
[1:20:26] he was given life
[1:20:28] again but he's in the grave
[1:20:33] today and so as his wife has passed
[1:20:37] on and all the thousands that were
[1:20:44] healed that God healed
[1:20:49] them they're all in the grave today
[1:20:54] but of all those that are in the grave
[1:20:57] the
[1:21:01] body how many allowed their faith to
[1:21:09] grow to be born
[1:21:12] again to receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:16] Ghost so that when when the death
[1:21:19] finally takes his
[1:21:21] body
[1:21:25] we're not
[1:21:26] dead a Believer Never
[1:21:29] Dies by faith we just change
[1:21:34] dimensions in a moment we're in another
[1:21:38] world in a moment we're in a better
[1:21:42] place in a moment we're amongst friends
[1:21:45] like we've never been among
[1:21:51] friends
[1:21:54] so without
[1:21:57] faith to for the life to leave this
[1:22:03] body that's death
[1:22:08] indeed but to die in faith
[1:22:13] believing is not dying at
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:18] all it's being absolutely
[1:22:21] changed
[1:22:23] for the last
[1:22:26] time it's to be in the presence of
[1:22:30] God forever
[1:22:33] more get to be the
[1:22:36] bride who was adorning
[1:22:40] herself and preparing her wedding gr

[1:23:48] afflictions in the minds of the
[1:23:50] people the affliction in their
[1:23:55] Spirits now teaching how to overcome

[1:24:13] life how to overcome anger in your
[1:24:18] life how to learn how to hunger and
[1:24:21] thirst for

[1:24:32] woman take

[1:25:05] daily
[1:25:09] Victory how
[1:25:12] to overcome
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:17] harshness harshness of
[1:25:21] hearts
[1:25:24] God began his
[1:25:28] ministry this first
[1:25:31] phase this first
[1:25:33] poll an
[1:25:35] evangelist
[1:25:38] praying for the
[1:25:42] sick in Matthew chapter 8
[1:25:50] mat the mountain that that he went upon
[1:25:53] in Matthew
[1:26:00] 5 in chapter
[1:26:03] 5 the the
[1:26:06] mountain that he came that he went up on
[1:26:09] Matthew
[1:26:11] 5 he was now in Matthew 8 coming down
[1:26:15] that
[1:26:18] mountain and the great multitudes were
[1:26:20] still following this this
[1:26:22] this incredible
[1:26:28] evangelist people by the thousands were
[1:26:31] being healed
[1:26:35] daily and the Bible says when he came
[1:26:39] down off this
[1:26:41] mountain he had been what had he been
[1:26:44] preaching
[1:26:46] on he had gone from healing for the
[1:26:51] body now healing for the
[1:26:55] spirit now healing for the minds of the
[1:26:59] people and when he comes down from the
[1:27:02] mountain the Bible says that a leper
[1:27:05] came and worshiped
[1:27:09] him Matthew 82 and behold there came a
[1:27:13] leper and worshiped him saying Lord if
[1:27:15] thou can if thou will thou can make me
[1:27:21] clean
[1:27:23] Matthew 8 and verse 2
[1:27:33] okay this this was not exactly a
[1:27:38] compliment for a for a Jewish
[1:27:46] rabbi this was not exactly a compliment
[1:27:49] for a minister in these in this in the
[1:27:52] days of
[1:27:55] Jesus that you could say you know who
[1:27:58] worships
[1:28:00] me the lepers worshiped
[1:28:04] me the lepers were despised of the
[1:28:11] world the leopards were shunned by all
[1:28:14] the
[1:28:20] people and now a leper comes to Jesus
[1:28:23] and he falls down and touches him he
[1:28:26] falls down and worships
[1:28:32] him but this
[1:28:35] leper was full of faith and
[1:28:40] belief his body was full of
[1:28:44] disease but his heart was full of
[1:28:48] Faith he may have been on his last weeks
[1:28:51] of life
[1:28:55] the flesh was already falling off of
[1:28:59] him he was in a horrible shape to look
[1:29:02] at
[1:29:04] him but he bowed down before the Lord
[1:29:11] Jesus and he said if thou
[1:29:16] will thou can make me
[1:29:20] clean
[1:29:24] and
[1:29:25] Jesus didn't say a
[1:29:28] word Jesus didn't pray a
[1:29:33] prayer Jesus simply laid his hand on the
[1:29:39] leper and touched him and
[1:29:43] saying I
[1:29:46] will be thou
[1:29:48] clean and immediately his leprosy was
[1:29:51] cleansed
[1:29:56] a reasonable
[1:29:58] man would have stood back from the
[1:30:03] leper and he says uh I'll pray for
[1:30:08] you you go ahead and go back to your
[1:30:11] leper
[1:30:14] colony and you can be sure that I'll be
[1:30:17] praying for you
[1:30:20] tonight that's okay that's fine but this
[1:30:26] was
[1:30:28] different this was a man who touched the
[1:30:31] Hem of the Garment of almighty
[1:30:37] God and Jesus said if you're willing to
[1:30:41] reach
[1:30:45] out if you're willing to reach out and
[1:30:48] and by faith and touch
[1:30:50] me
[1:30:52] I'm
[1:30:53] willing to touch
[1:30:56] you he said I will touch you as a matter
[1:30:59] of
[1:31:02] fact and when he put his hand on the
[1:31:06] leper the multitud
[1:31:10] went don't don't touch
[1:31:13] him it was too
[1:31:15] late he already had touched him and he
[1:31:19] said be thou clean
[1:31:23] and not a week
[1:31:25] later not 24 hours
[1:31:28] later the Bible says immediately his
[1:31:31] leprosy was
[1:31:35] cleansed he was
[1:31:37] entering into the second pole of his
[1:31:43] ministry this
[1:31:45] evangelist this Jesus of
[1:31:47] Nazareth this son of
[1:31:50] God
[1:31:56] in verse
[1:32:00] eight verse
[1:32:02] five Bible says and when Jesus had
[1:32:06] entered into capernium
[1:32:11] it was a lot like Los Angeles you
[1:32:15] know there came unto him a
[1:32:19] centurion a gentile
[1:32:23] a
[1:32:23] Roman a
[1:32:25] warrior a man with a lot of blood on his
[1:32:30] hands a man who even held the Jewish
[1:32:33] people captives and
[1:32:39] slaves the Bible says There came unto
[1:32:41] him a centurion beseeching him verse
[1:32:49] five and saying Lord my servant lieth at
[1:32:52] home sick of the py grievously
[1:33:01] tormented Jesus saith unto
[1:33:04] him I will come and heal
[1:33:07] him the Centurion answered and
[1:33:11] said you won't have to come
[1:33:14] Lord for one thing you know what kind of
[1:33:18] man I
[1:33:20] am you can
[1:33:22] discern not only do you see my Roman my
[1:33:25] my my Roman dress as a
[1:33:32] centurion but you know my heart you you
[1:33:34] can discern
[1:33:36] it you know what kind of man I
[1:33:39] am and I'm not
[1:33:42] worthy that that you should come under
[1:33:44] my
[1:33:47] roof he said but speak the word only and
[1:33:50] my servant shall shall be
[1:33:55] healed he said you
[1:33:57] see I'm a man under
[1:34:02] Authority I am under what they call a
[1:34:04] Roman
[1:34:07] perfect I am
[1:34:10] under a a a a man that's called a Roman
[1:34:19] perfect that was that was a title
[1:34:22] of the next highest level of
[1:34:27] authority he said having sold I am Comm
[1:34:30] man under Authority but I have soldiers
[1:34:32] under me
[1:34:39] also and I say to this man go and he
[1:34:45] goeth and to another come and he
[1:34:48] cometh and to my servant do this and he
[1:34:51] doeth
[1:34:53] it my word is
[1:34:57] law my word is such if they don't do it
[1:35:00] then they are put to
[1:35:05] death no one questions my
[1:35:09] authority when I tell them
[1:35:12] go they must go when I tell them
[1:35:17] come they must
[1:35:20] come and he
[1:35:22] says I
[1:35:25] perceive that you're that kind of
[1:35:29] man but in a supernatural
[1:35:35] realm I command
[1:35:39] men but I've seen
[1:35:42] you I've seen you command
[1:35:46] demons I seen you command
[1:35:50] demons
[1:35:52] I see you command
[1:35:57] sickness I've seen you command the Seas
[1:36:00] and the
[1:36:04] winds just speak the word this gentille
[1:36:10] said he wasn't a church
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:14] goer it didn't belong to no certain
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:20] denomination when Jesus heard
[1:36:23] it he
[1:36:25] marveled and said to them that
[1:36:28] followed verely I say unto you
[1:36:32] I
[1:36:34] I
[1:36:36] Jesus have not found so great a
[1:36:41] Faith No not in
[1:36:49] Israel his first encounter
[1:36:54] as an
[1:36:57] evangelist he says this is the first
[1:37:01] time I see and have found so great a
[1:37:09] faith the healing campaigns and
[1:37:16] evangelists for the most
[1:37:20] part God was healing the
[1:37:25] people and they came to him the
[1:37:29] multitude they saw one
[1:37:31] healed they'd come to be
[1:37:35] healed by the
[1:37:39] thousands but it got to a place where
[1:37:41] the
[1:37:42] people couldn't receive their
[1:37:46] healing unless he discerned their
[1:37:50] heart unless he told them their
[1:37:55] name unless unless he unless he publicly
[1:37:58] told them where you live where your
[1:38:00] address
[1:38:04] is in the first po
[1:38:09] Ministry in the in the first po Ministry
[1:38:13] of
[1:38:14] Jesus into his second
[1:38:18] pool it was the same at his second com
[1:38:24] as it was at his first
[1:38:27] coming it got to a
[1:38:30] place where they couldn't just take it
[1:38:33] by
[1:38:36] faith they couldn't see the neighbor in
[1:38:40] the bench in front of them getting
[1:38:46] healed and believe that God was in the
[1:38:50] house
[1:38:51] and if he's being
[1:38:54] healed I too can receive my
[1:38:58] healing I too can receive my
[1:39:02] Deliverance I too can be
[1:39:05] changed because I seen him change
[1:39:07] another
[1:39:09] person and he's the same yesterday today
[1:39:12] and
[1:39:14] forever in verse
[1:39:17] 11 it says and I say unto you
[1:39:21] that many shall come from the East and
[1:39:24] West and shall sit down with Abraham and
[1:39:27] Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of
[1:39:32] Heaven one more time and I say unto
[1:39:37] you that many shall come from the East
[1:39:40] and
[1:39:42] West and shall sit down with
[1:39:46] Abraham and
[1:39:48] Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of
[1:39:53] Heaven but the children of the
[1:39:57] Kingdom he's talking about Jews
[1:40:00] now he's talking about the same Kingdom
[1:40:03] of Heaven in verse
[1:40:06] 11 and these are all
[1:40:08] Jews he says but the children of the
[1:40:12] Kingdom the Jewish
[1:40:15] people in in the first coming of Christ
[1:40:18] he said but the children of the Kingdom
[1:40:21] shall be cast out in outer
[1:40:25] Darkness there shall be
[1:40:28] weeping and nashing of
[1:40:30] teeth he wasn't talking about hell
[1:40:34] here but this is the Jewish
[1:40:38] people and from the days of
[1:40:41] Jesus when they would
[1:40:43] reject when they would
[1:40:47] reject the open
[1:40:49] book and the the revelation of the Seven
[1:40:53] Seals they would be
[1:40:57] scattered for the next 2,000
[1:41:02] years they would be scattered the world
[1:41:07] over into every
[1:41:11] nation Jerusalem and the promised land
[1:41:15] would be empty of all
[1:41:19] Jews until the 20th
[1:41:24] century this is that
[1:41:27] prophecy this is the this is the seven
[1:41:30] trumpets sounding of
[1:41:35] Revelations the this are the seven
[1:41:39] trumpets of the Book of
[1:41:42] Revelation sounding right here so not
[1:41:45] only did he prophesy and did he open the
[1:41:49] book and he and and and and brought us
[1:41:52] the revelation of Seven
[1:41:54] Seals but he brought into his preaching
[1:41:57] of the Gospel the seven
[1:42:02] trumpets how Israel would be scattered
[1:42:05] the world
[1:42:08] over but the children of the Kingdom
[1:42:10] shall be cast out into outer
[1:42:15] darkness and there shall be
[1:42:18] weeping and nashing of teeth
[1:42:23] until Jesus comes
[1:42:25] again with another Elijah
[1:42:30] Ministry in the 20th
[1:42:34] century God rich and
[1:42:37] mercy seeing his ministry
[1:42:42] unfolding at the first
[1:42:44] coming if we can see
[1:42:47] it it will make more clear to us
[1:42:53] the ministry of Jesus at his second
[1:42:57] coming so we stand to our feet
[1:43:07] T
[1:43:09] Jesus
[1:43:11] evangelist
[1:43:13] prophet and mighty
[1:43:18] Angel he's the same yesterday today and
[1:43:22] forever he's unchanging in all his
[1:43:27] ways and may God Open the Eyes of our
[1:43:33] understanding to see him to recognize
[1:43:36] our day in its
[1:43:39] message to recognize that this
[1:43:43] gospel was not just for the healing of
[1:43:46] the
[1:43:49] body because as you
[1:43:52] know the thousands that were
[1:43:57] healed hundreds of
[1:44:00] thousands in the m in the ministry of
[1:44:03] the seventh
[1:44:07] angel they're all in the grave
[1:44:11] today but those who were baptized with
[1:44:14] the Holy
[1:44:17] Ghost those who were born again
[1:44:24] those they never
[1:44:29] died they changed
[1:44:32] Dimensions they changed
[1:44:35] bodies they're more alive tonight than
[1:44:38] they've ever
[1:44:44] been but not all who receive healing
[1:44:48] their body are that way
[1:44:54] only those whose
[1:44:58] Faith like the
[1:45:01] Centurion Jesus
[1:45:06] said your servant is
[1:45:10] sick I'll follow you to your
[1:45:13] house he said
[1:45:16] no no don't do that I'm not worthy
[1:45:22] for you to follow
[1:45:25] me I'll never let you do
[1:45:28] that I I need to follow
[1:45:31] you but this present job that I have
[1:45:34] kind of hinders
[1:45:39] me because I'm a Roman
[1:45:43] Centurion but
[1:45:45] nonetheless just speak the
[1:45:49] word because I see the supernatural
[1:45:53] Authority in your
[1:45:57] life that I have not even
[1:46:02] seen not even in the Emperors of
[1:46:07] Rome not even in the emperor of
[1:46:11] Rome not even in
[1:46:15] Caesar with all the power he
[1:46:18] has all his power brings his
[1:46:23] death but your power your
[1:46:27] Authority it's bringing life to
[1:46:31] everyone so just
[1:46:35] speak and when you
[1:46:37] speak I know it'll give
[1:46:40] life and not
[1:46:43] death Lord help us
[1:46:46] tonight that when we ask something of
[1:46:49] God
[1:46:52] that we can
[1:46:54] understand that when he
[1:46:57] answers it'll only be
[1:47:00] life it'll only be
[1:47:03] Joy it'll only help us to
[1:47:07] overcome every every
[1:47:13] complex that the world has put on
[1:47:17] us if you ask him tonight
[1:47:21] by
[1:47:22] faith then know then have the confidence
[1:47:27] to
[1:47:30] know that his answer to you
[1:47:35] tonight will be
[1:47:37] life

[1:47:42] Eternal let's pray Heavenly Father we
