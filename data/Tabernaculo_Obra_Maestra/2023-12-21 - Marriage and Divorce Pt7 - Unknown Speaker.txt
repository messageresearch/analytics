rather it's good to be back again uh we had a good time there visiting my son Jordan and uh we ministered for the Saints there there in Minnesota and had a good time with the church there uh visiting with uh the brother the pastor Brother Juan BL BL BL I think Brother Juan is uh it's not Juan like Juan it's it's it's a he's from Liberia one is one that's right and uh we had a good time with our brother and a good time of Fellowship around the word of God and and uh had opportunity to share a few things with the church there uh and it was cold and Minnesota is definitely cold although when we arrived uh we were expecting like last time to see three and four feet of snow and uh there wasn't any snow on the ground it it was cold so you know me and Karen thought wow this is going to be very nice you know it'll just be 20 and 30 degrees and no snow and we woke up the next morning it was covered with snow everywhere till the day we left but we knew we were going to Minnesota but um if you're ever in Minnesota there's a fine little church and some wonderful people there to visit and the best time to visit is summer and spring of course we we have our some Services here here this uh this Saturday and Sunday December the 23rd uh Saturday uh six service begins at 6: p.m then Sunday morning we'll be having a service a regular service at 10:00 a.m. the uh young a young man A Young Brother by name of brother Cosman Stefan will be ministering for us Cosman Cosman Stefan Stefan uh he's originally from um Romania I believe Roman and uh we he is from uh Dallas Fort Fort Worth Dallas Texas and uh I'm sure he'll uh he'll be a blessing for all of us as we stand to our feet this evening and we'll be ministering part seven marriage and divorce I believe we'll be we'll be putting a comma on this on on on on this uh subject for now of of marriage and divorce and the and the key thought to understanding marriage and divorce the the subject I chose was in the mouth of two or three Witnesses because when uh William Brandon preached marriage and divorce he brought up these three Witnesses and of course it's it's not common for for people to for people to catch that that was the found Foundation of this teaching but it's a Bible principle that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let everything be established and it holds very true to this teaching here let me also say that this teaching on marriage and divorce there is not a big back a big black period when we're done speaking on it we are not a denomination uh in what we believe and what we stand on the the the local assembly with its Pastor is Sovereign the local assembly and its Pastor is Sovereign so so the things that would take place in a local church and and what a pastor uh seeking seeking the truth from God's word can and every every every incident has details that are that are particular just to that group to that couple so then as a pastor you're trying to help those who are members of that little assembly and and the decision that he might he might make to help that couple may not be the same decision for each couple having issues because there may be details in in their lives one or two little different angles that that would call for for for some other little different advice so so for us to think we could judge another church or a pastor whatever decision they have made on a on a on a couple or we we we really wouldn't know the details of what's happening there and because we're not a denomination then we don't have laws that apply to everyone period so when we begin to understand the sovereignty of our little group here and and the sovereignty of every believing little groups or large groups then then we realize we we we might have an opinion uh but but in reality uh we should leave that to the local assembly and their pastors for they'll be the ones to answer for their conclusions and their decisions and above all there's no way for us to know the details have the mechanics and the Dynamics of every assembly so the ministering and the truths of marriage and divorce so so the the the the the truths of marriage and divorce wasn't to turn us into a denomination where everyone in this denomination must do the same thing or else you'll excommunicated from your denomination aren't you glad that aren't you glad that we can't be excommunicated from any denomination we we are free we are free to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit so marriage and divorce the help that that and the correction that was brought was to correct all the Proverbs of the Old Testament and to understand that under the Old Testament that that that their their rules and their laws of marriage and divorce it didn't fix anything it it didn't help uh I won't say it didn't help but it didn't change people the way a born again experience was supposed to change us for for a man and a woman who have not been born again no matter how good advice or a proverb you might give them if they cannot apply it by a revelation that has struck their hearts then there'll be no change in that relationship in that family there won't be a change it takes a revelation through a born again experience and the leadership of the Holy Ghost that will lead you to do all righteousness in all your relationships what of all the broken ones and the those married two and three and four times there there's a judgment day and and Jesus Christ will be the judge he's the Supreme judge he's the best judge he's the only righteous [Music] judge he he will judge us he will judge us according to our hearts you might see someone and say that man is the worst I've ever known had you known Saul had had had you known Saul of Tarsus if you would have known him as Saul of Tarsus and you were a new believer believe beling that Jesus was was the Christ that man was persecuting you that man was putting you in jail that man was killing the Believers not with his bare hands not with his bare hands but but by ordering others to do so so you would have judged them according to his actions and behavior but God rich in Mercy judge them according to a seed that was laying in his heart later Paul told us I am the chiefest of Sinners I'm the worst because because I persecuted the Church of God because I persecuted Ed the Church of God he says but God had mercy you know why he says God had mercy on me because I did it in ignorance now that's not a doctrine of all ignorance is blessed but it was his personal testimony that God Made Real to him turn turn with me to First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 15 and 16 we have brought forth the witness of Jesus Christ we brought forth the witness we brought forth the witness of Moses and now the third witness the prophet and Apostle Paul 1 Corinthians 6 15 and 16 know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot that can be applied spiritually and naturally verse 16 what he says what know ye not that he which is joined to an Harlot is one body for the two saith he shall be one flesh who said that almighty God God in the beginning for the two saith he shall be one flesh let's pray Heavenly Father we give you honor and glory and praise ask your blessings tonight in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated so the question the argument many times has been that if you are engaged to be married then you have made a vow and as far as God is concerned you are married already so then in this message it has been said that if you're engaged to someone then and the engagement is broken off a a and and that that you don't have a right to marry to marry to marry again for you've for in the eyes of God you've already been married so then we have men that hold to this very firm and there has and there has been men I'm going to say it for this little church ministers ministers who have lived very who have lived lives of fornication they never married they never made a marriage vow never were engaged but but prior to giving their hearts to Christ they had many intimate Partners sexual relationships and and and they they believe because they were never married or engaged despite the many people they were with that they have a right to preach because now that they've come into the gospel they they married one time and and they're the husband of one wife but before that they lived in fornication now the truth of marriage and divorce and and God calling us to live a holy life is is not just God's word for believers it's for the unbeliever too the same word will judge the believer and the unbeliever it's not a different measuring stick every human being will be judged by Christ The Living Word it's just that the believer wants to know and the unbeliever doesn't care and yet on the day of judgment they'll both be judged by the same word sure so here we have Paul saying this know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an Harlot God forbid now listen to verse 16 Paul says what know ye not that he which is joined to a harlot is one [Music] body he meaning what does he mean a Believer or does or does the he mean an unbeliever he means a man sinner or Saint believer or unbeliever know he not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body verse whether you're claim to be a believer or an unbeliever he is simply a man know ye not that he this a man which is joined to a harlot is one body Paul doesn't care if you go to church or don't go to church he's talk he's talking to the man then he says for two sayith he shall be one flesh now that he is talk that he's talking about is almighty God so God is saying that when you enter into a union physical you become one body and then he said for the two now he saith he shall be one flesh does that constitute before God your wife now in the Old Testament it did when a a a man could actually sell his daughter in the old in the Old Testament a father could actually sell his daughter another man and though the man bought her as a slave and though and though the man bought her as a slave if he became intimate with her it was his wife now you see what Paul is saying here you see how this book was written Old Testament you see how Paul is speaking here if this is a Bible truth then the mess of marriage and divorce is incredible then men who claim that they've only had one wife but lived in fornication then the first woman he was with whether he made her a promise with his mouth or not because because they were joined together though he joined himself to a harlot that first woman he joined himself to Paul is saying for the two he saith now are one flesh that first one is your wife and there are many men today that that that uh that preach that if you've been engaged and the engagement was broken before God you were married even though you're both clean and you never touched each other because they say the engagement was a vow but Paul is saying here if you're joined to an Harlot and he which is joined to a harlot is one body then we say explain that Paul let me explain it to you he says what I meant by that for two saith God shall now be one flesh so it's not only just The Vow perhaps but it's also the ACT if you've lived and practiced fornication you say I did it in ignorance our ignorance doesn't unnal the truth of God's [Music] word his blood May forgive us but it doesn't change the truth of God's word a woman or a man who's lived as a prostitute or the blood can cleanse them and and give them salvation and you can be justified before God in the spirit man or woman but you will never be justified in this flesh body in which you committed the sins [Music] amen because people just simply don't forget that and and God until you're born again and washed in the blood of Jesus he doesn't forget that but nonetheless Paul is saying here in First Corinthians 6 15 and 16 that the ACT also commits the two parties and the two are now one flesh the man or the woman could say well that was just a one night stand I didn't even love him and she didn't love me and and we've never spoken or seen each other again for the last 30 years so and I've been married to this other woman now for all those for all these 30 years but Paul is saying but you first joined yourself to a harlot and when you did you were one flesh you were husband and wife just a strong statement just as the vow and the engagement is there any forgiveness for all of it there is but for the that person that couple that those men those women when you know they're forgiven they cease to practice that lifestyle they first Corinthians 7 now Apostle Paul 1 Corinthians 7 and verse one now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman not not talking about a man's wife but any other woman never nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband you know in in in holy matrimony in santoo matmon now Moses had given Israel a writing of divorcement but you know he never gave them a marriage license to sign mm to sign no they just had they could just they had the right to to to write up a divorce paper but in the Old Testament few if any ever had a writing of marriage or a marriage [Music] certificate a vow was made then there was a time where that that woman now was already the man's wife she was a bride and as we said she was also his wife already so the bride was really the wife who was who was adorning herself and preparing her wedding garments for the day when there would be a public ceremony and they would celebrate now that her husband her the bridegroom would have the right to carry her and take her away and the father had to had to let go of all of his authority over the woman and now the man had full authority over this woman it was his wife up until the time of that of that public ceremony taking place the father could unn that wedding he could unn know the engagement for though she was under the vow she was already the man's wife he didn't have full authority over her completely the father did and the father could unn know that before the public ceremony so that was another difference a woman betrothed or engaged the woman and the woman who was now wife she had had the public ceremony the wedding day and the husband now took her away when that public ceremony took place the wedding day a a union between the two of them was was was was finished Not only was she the man's wife now but he now had all authority and power over the woman and the father now had none it was all gone another point between a woman betr and a woman married both were considered wife so this bride this wife once The Vow is made she's adorning herself preparing preparing her wedding garment for for the public ceremony of that wedding day when the husband would now take her away to live with him eternally speaking spiritually now a spiritual type so the Rapture is the type of this wedding day when the when the husband Jesus Christ takes his bride away and where does where do they go after the marriage the wedding to the wedding supper of the Lamb the husband has taken her away to live with him now eternally so Paul here in 1 Corinthians 7 verse two he said nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband let the husband Render unto the wife do benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband what what's happening now in this new testament God is making them close closer to coequal than they have ever been in the last under the law they were never close to being co-equal under the Old Testament but under the New Testament God is bringing them more co-equal than they've ever been in thousands of years verse four then he says the wife hath not power over her own body but the husband there went the thought of being co-equal but and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife now we're back to being co-equal we just by just by going past the comma then he says verse five defraud ye not one another except it be with consent for a time that you may give yourself to fasting and prayer and come together again that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency then he says but I speak this by permission and not by commandment in other words what Paul is saying in verse six Paul says the thing I'm telling you now I ask permission to give you this advice he says and God has given me permission to say what I'm going to tell you to help you it's not thus sayith the Lord but in another place he says but I believe I have the Holy Spirit so now verse S for I would that all men were even as I myself but every man hath his proper gift of God one after this manner and another after that it's it's it's not thus sayith the Lord though it's laying in the Bible but it's advice that Paul asked almighty God to to be able to give us this advice to help us in these situations of marriage divorce and family relationships verse eight I say therefore to the unmarried and widows it's good for them if they abide even as I he's not saying you must do this he's not he's not saying this is this is the new law there is no such thing as a new law it was law back then it's Grace today verse n but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn verse verse 10 and unto the married I command yet not I but the Lord he's telling us let me remind you this is not thus saith the Lord It's but but I ask God permission to tell you these things I'm going to conso you on and and the Holy Spirit gave me that permission that's why I'm saying what I'm saying to you he so un verse 10 and unto the married I command and then he then they reflects for a minute wait a minute they're going to misunderstand me and unto the married I command then he thinks for a second yet not I but the Lord let not the wife depart from her husband said let not the wife depart from her husband that's not a period he put at the end of that because the next verse reveals it then Paul says but and if she depart so that his advice was to the wife don't leave your husband but if you do leave him remain unmarried or be reconciled to your husband then he says and let not the husband put away his wife the the the the the the marriage the the the the the the marriage between a man and a woman has never been more closer to being co-equal as it is as it's as it's taught in this new testament this New Covenant this New and Living Way verse 12 says but to the rest speak I not the Lord the third time now he's he he he's telling us again I asked permission to tell you these things [Music] and God has given me that permission to tell you and speak to you things that will help you in your in your marriages in your union verse 12 but to the rest speak I not the Lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not if any brother has a wife that believeth not apply the token apply the token and get her out of your home he didn't say that but many do say that knowing nothing about the man or the woman the husband and wife they make that statement they put a period on it and they make a Doctrine that's that's up to them but that's not the advice that Paul gave someone might say well there's a lot of reasons why you would but let's keep reading if any brother have a wife that believeth not and she is pleased to dwell with him that's a large that's a big statement and she is pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away let him not put her away we're learning things now about marriage and divorce that you couldn't know unless you understand that the truth is in the mouth of these three Witnesses the greatest advice is in the mouth of these three Witnesses verse 13 and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife let her not leave him let her if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him what if he's not pleased what if he's abusive verbally physically emotionally then Paul said the woman doesn't have to stay with that kind of man and yet he says but if you leave him remain unmarried and remember all this that he's saying he's saying by permission that he asked God to give him permission to say these things this cel everything he's saying has a comma he's laying nothing down with the period three times he tells us I'm saying this by permission it's not thus sayith the Lord but I have asked God to let me tell you something to teach te you how to live at peace and how to be co-equal in your marriage Affairs closer to the beginning than it's ever been before is what the advice of these three Witnesses is giving us Jesus brought the change Paul explained the change in more detail watch verse 13 now once again and the woman which ha a husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her if he be pleased or if she be pleased Paul was saying when he turned it around if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him so even if a pastor would tell the woman your husband's not a Believer you need to leave him that's not what Paul said that's not the conso in the Bible all she has to say but he's pleased to dwell with me he'll take me to church he picks me up from church he encourages me to keep going to [Music] church he just tells me this ain't for me he says don't leave him because of the bad advice of some Minister verse 14 for the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they [Music] holy [Music] but if the unbelieving depart let him depart but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but God hath called us to peace verse 15 a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases but God hath called us to peace the wisdom of Paul by the Holy Spirit has has given him these words for us though he told us it's not thus saith the Lord but I have asked permission of God to share these things with you and God has given me permission to say it to you verse 16 for what knowest thou oh wife whether Thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou oh man whether Thou shalt save thy wife Mark 10 Mark 10 and verse 6 Mark 10 and verse 6 and it reads like this verse 6 but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female Mark 10 and chapter six Mark 10 and verse 6 but from the beginning of the creation God made them m male and female for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God had joined together let no man put us under but what if you become one with a harlot didn't you also just become one flesh regardless of the poor choice that you made what therefore God had joined together let no man put us under verse n and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter this is Jesus speaking and he saith unto him whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her he's talking about a married man man married to to to the to his first wife which is his true wife he says can he sayth unto them whosoever shall put away his wife the wife of thy youth thy first wife can and marry another committeth adultery against her that's the man and if a woman shall put away her husband because really in scripture you will have one husband and one wife and that'll be the husband of thy youth or the wife of thy [Music] youth your first the first man or woman the first man or woman in with which you have a union in intimacy together and if a woman shall put away her husband verse 12 and be married to another she committeth adultery first Corinthians 7 and verse 39 First Corinthians 7:39 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth 39 First Corinthian she is at Liberty he says but if her husband be dead she's at Liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord under the Old Testament if a woman was put away for uncleanness accused of her husband uh that she was unclean which was a a very general term basically it was saying I don't want you anymore and he gave her a writing of divorce that that woman under the law could marry again for she was for she was lawfully but unjustly rejected for she was lawfully but unjustly rejected the law allowed it but it was unjust the the law may allow allow it but it was unethical the law may allow it but that didn't make it righteous or holy The Ten Commandments were Proverbs given to Israel not thus sayith the Lord that's why when we read in the New Testament and Jesus said you have heard it said by them of old time that thou shalt not kill but I say unto you you see it was a proverb it was subject to change and thus saith the Lord changed it because Jesus said but I say unto you now th sayith the Lord I'm not going to give you a law but I'm going to give you something that you can live by you can stand by and and you can achieve it through a born again experience so you can live by the law and still be living in sin so the man of the Israelites of the Old Testament though they were living by the law and the proverb that Moses gave them they were every one of them still living in sin but from the beginning it wasn't so here the proverb of the Jeremiah quotes in Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 3 and verse one Jeremiah chter 3 and verse one Jeremiah 3:1 they say if a man put a way his wife and she go from him and become another man's and become another man's shall shall he return unto her again shall not the land be greatly polluted he said but thou H has played the harlet with many lovers yet return again to me sayeth the Lord so here Jeremiah is quoting from the words of Deuteronomy Moses Moses he said about a man who has put away his wife wife not for adultery not for fornication not for anything she's done wrong simply because he has declared her unclean because he doesn't want her no more you see they could put their wives away for what reason any reason and when they they weren't guilty of any wrongdoing they would simply declare them unclean and give her a writing of divorce and put her away and that woman could remarry again but she could never return if her second husband died if okay if he put her away she could never return back to her first husband or marry again under the law in the message marriage and divorce we're going to be closing now paragraph 311 to 3:14 I want to read you this quote brother brandom is is closing now the message he preached on marriage and divorce he says in First Corinthians the 7th chapter 12th and 15th verse in the New Testament Pro in the New Testament Paul a prophet who met the same thing in the church and spoke this this is I not the Lord is that right because of divorce conditions it wasn't so from the beginning but Moses was permitted was was permitted it or allowed it and God recognized it righteousness and Paul also had a right when he found his church in that condition and he asked God for permission to try to help the people in this condition of divorce and marriage broken families like Satan had done to the first family in Eden and it's and it's been a problem through through the history of mankind and Moses tried to help the people and ask God for permission and Paul tried to help the people and ask God for permission to give him this advice he said now you now you believe if you believe this to be true and believe it come from God God and by the Vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought that's brought me this far should not God should not God upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to to suffer you or to allow you to go on to go on the way you are and do it no more go with your wives and live in peace for the hour is late the coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't dare try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you are married and God bore me witness of that on the mountain that I could say this to you a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals in other words he's telling us I wouldn't have the permission to tell you what I'm telling you right now if it wouldn't be for the opening of The Seven se he said it 1965 February the 24th he says the 21st he says and this is the question in God's word he said let them let them go on as they are this is what he's telling us that God told him that he could say to his congregation let them go on in as they are and sin no more it wasn't so from the beginning that is right wasn't so and it will not be at the end but under modern conditions as God's servant I won't call myself his Prophet but I believe maybe if I wouldn't be sent for that I'm laying a ground for them when he does come so so so under the modern he says he says so under the modern conditions I command you to go to your home with your wife now if you are happy with her live with her raise your children in the admonition of God but God be merciful to you if you ever do that again you teach your children to never do a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of God and now that you are as you are let us go now at the late evening hour that we're living in and press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ where all things are possible as we stand to our feet tonight marriage and divorce doesn't have periods marriage and divorce has three Witnesses and in the mouth of these three Witnesses God gave them permission for them to speak to the people and judge these matters let's pray Heavenly Father it was the family that Satan divided in the beginning it it was the relationship between a man and his wife that Lucifer attacked first and he's used and he's played the same game for thousands of years and the only way that you can get off of playing that game of fornication and adultery is you must be born again without the Born Again experience without the Born Again experience you're lost in sin and fornication in adultery and idolatry Lord help us to be born again and when Temptation comes receive a refilling receive a refilling of your Holy Spirit to give us the victory the victor over every strong Temptation making us Overcomers that's the way we're adorning ourselves as the bride and preparing our wedding garment with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and refilling after refilling that gives us a victory in Christ Lord we thank you bless your people here tonight Lord grant them Revelation for Upon This Rock you're building your

was many things as we spoke that have also a spiritual application we spoke on the Lamb's wife and the Lamb's bride and it had it lays within the pages of even of this teaching God's word is eternal as I told brother Leo today there is no problem in having something to minister to God's children because it's an eternal book that's been open to us no our struggle is to lay before God and ask him of this word that's Eternal what shall we share tonight and this is it this is what he's given us God bless you God be with you Lord willing our next service Saturday at 6 pm. and then Sunday at 10
