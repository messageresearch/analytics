[43:35] I love you
[43:40] [Music]
[43:44] worship God we're thankful this morning
[43:48] once again
[43:51] appreciate the worship
[43:54] because that's really why we come
[43:57] espresso we're worshipers
[44:01] first first of anything
[44:06] we are worshipers
[44:08] and when we come and we worship
[44:12] we worship to bring his presence down
[44:16] we worship to to make the atmosphere
[44:20] right
[44:23] correct we worship to to let them know
[44:26] that we're waiting on him to come
[44:29] amongst us
[44:35] we worship
[44:37] adoramos
[44:39] so that he can bless us
[44:42] like when Jesus went he was invited by a
[44:45] Pharisee Jesus
[44:48] and he went to this to this Feast that
[44:52] they were having
[44:55] and the custom was when he arrived at
[44:58] this at this priest home
[45:07] they would have someone to wash the feet
[45:10] of the guests
[45:13] but when he walked
[45:16] intro they had no one to wash his feet
[45:20] and he went into the feast and sat down
[45:24] they hadn't washed his feet
[45:28] they haven't they hadn't refreshed him
[45:30] as all the others
[45:33] so he sat there in the midst of this
[45:35] Feast this party
[45:39] and everyone could see
[45:42] that though he was there
[45:45] he had not been he was not a welcome
[45:48] guest
[45:51] but a woman looking through the fence
[45:56] a woman with a bad reputation
[46:00] but though she had a bad reputation
[46:04] she had the right Revelation
[46:07] and she said it's not right the way
[46:10] they're treating him
[46:12] his testimony the life he lives and the
[46:18] Bible says she snuck in
[46:20] yes and she took a little pan of water
[46:25] [Music]
[46:27] and though she knew everyone would would
[46:30] be looking at her and and laughing at
[46:32] her okay
[46:35] she washed his feet
[46:38] she made him welcome
[46:40] the Bible says she dried his feet with
[46:43] her hair
[46:50] why today oh even if they stood on their
[46:54] head they wouldn't have enough hair to
[46:55] do that
[46:59] she made him welcome
[47:02] she worshiped
[47:04] and she was blessed yeah
[47:07] it was Mary of Magdalene yeah
[47:11] Seven Devils
[47:14] including the non
[47:16] devil
[47:19] so we're happy this morning
[47:22] you'll be worshipers
[47:24] of that same Lord Jesus
[47:27] we want him to know that we're prepared
[47:29] to even fall on our knees and wash his
[47:32] feet
[47:36] if he'll just come and speak to us
[47:44] this morning we want to continue
[47:47] on this theme we've been speaking on it
[47:50] is
[47:51] we're in part three
[47:54] we entitled it the white horse rider in
[47:58] the Days of Elijah
[48:02] and the pale horse rider in the days
[48:09] and you might say well which one is it
[48:12] on the days of Elijah
[48:15] it's both
[48:17] because one is the first coming of
[48:20] Christ
[48:21] and when is the second coming of Christ
[48:24] Our subject
[48:26] who has believed our report
[48:29] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[48:32] revealed
[48:35] so we're going to repeat much this
[48:38] morning
[48:39] we're going to background on the other
[48:42] side
[48:47] and we want to bring it all again to you
[48:50] by way of remembrance
[48:54] and we've placed a few little extra
[48:57] things within within what we've already
[48:59] said
[49:02] yes
[49:03] and we have placed
[49:06] a few things in in many much of what
[49:10] we'll be repeating
[49:12] is
[49:17] just like Malachi 4 5 and 6.
[49:22] it says Elijah would turn the hearts of
[49:25] the fathers to the children
[49:29] and then it says
[49:31] of the children to the fathers
[49:38] so it kind of sounds like he's having to
[49:40] undo something he already did
[49:45] or you asked the question well which one
[49:48] are you going to do
[49:50] and once again the answer is both
[49:55] because one is the first coming of
[49:58] Christ
[49:59] the Forerunner to the first coming
[50:03] John the Baptist and the second is
[50:08] but it's a forerunner to the second
[50:11] coming of Christ
[50:12] when we believe God sent in our day
[50:17] siete
[50:51] Saint John 10 verses 1 through 7. yes
[50:56] then
[51:04] Saint John 10 verse 1 barely verily I
[51:08] say unto you
[51:10] he that entereth not by the door into
[51:12] the Sheepfold but climeth up some other
[51:15] way the same is a thief and a robber is
[51:25] and every time we approach the word
[51:29] we're approaching this door
[51:33] it's the only way we can come in
[51:36] through the reading of the word sure
[51:51] otherwise you're reading the Bible
[51:55] as a thief and a Robert
[51:59] verse 2 but he that enters in by the
[52:02] door is The Shepherd of the sheep
[52:08] to him the Porter openeth and the sheep
[52:11] hear his voice
[52:15] and he calls his own Sheep by name and
[52:19] leadeth them out yes
[52:22] he's calling us all by name this morning
[52:26] that's the way he Reveals His word
[52:30] because he doesn't reveal his word to
[52:33] everyone
[52:36] just to a Chosen Few
[52:38] call the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[52:43] if he's called you he knows your name he
[52:48] knows where you live he knows what you
[52:50] did yesterday
[52:51] he knows where you are this morning
[52:54] and you're here because he wants you to
[52:57] be his worshiper yes
[53:03] and when he verse 4 and when he puteth
[53:06] forth his own sheep he'd goeth before
[53:08] them and when sheep follow him for they
[53:11] know his voice
[53:19] in verse 5 and a stranger they will not
[53:23] follow that's a powerful statement
[53:27] they will not follow
[53:30] um
[53:35] but we'll flee from him
[54:07] this Parable speak Jesus unto them but
[54:10] they understood understood not what
[54:13] things they were which is fake unto them
[54:20] this year
[54:24] this morning we're speaking on Parables
[54:29] out of the Book of Revelations
[54:33] out of the gospels
[54:36] out of the New Testament for it was all
[54:40] written in Parables
[54:42] that they wouldn't understand
[54:55] if you've had a personal experience with
[54:57] Jesus Christ
[55:02] verse 7 then said Jesus is done to them
[55:06] again barely barely I say unto you
[55:10] I am the door of the Sheep ovejas
[55:45] in Jesus name
[55:48] I mean you may be seated
[55:57] we're going to almost start from the
[55:59] beginning again
[56:03] we spoke on Revelations 5.
[56:08] how they were told that Jesus Christ
[56:11] opened this book is
[56:15] this book that we're speaking of this
[56:17] morning
[56:19] and when Jesus opened this book
[56:23] it was in the days of this Earthly
[56:25] Ministry
[56:28] that was the time of the opening of the
[56:31] book
[56:33] and he continued to open the book
[56:35] throughout his Earthly Ministry
[56:40] and in Matthew 24
[56:43] in a parable
[56:45] just as in just as Isaiah also had
[56:48] prophesied
[56:50] and other scriptures tells us
[56:53] that he loose the Seven Seals
[56:57] what is Seven Seals
[56:59] it's seven parts to one Plan of
[57:03] Redemption and to whom did he open the
[57:06] book of redemption
[57:08] are called a New Testament
[57:11] called a New Covenant
[57:14] to Israel Israel the lion took the
[57:18] Lion's part
[57:21] Israel Israel to whom he opened
[57:25] the Lamb's Book of redemption
[57:29] it was never called the Lion's book of
[57:32] redemption
[57:34] there is no book like that in the Bible
[57:38] it's the Lamb's Book of Life it's a
[57:41] Lamb's Book of redemption
[57:43] but it was the lion who was going to
[57:47] deliver that book
[57:48] that the lamb opened
[57:51] to Israel Israel and
[57:54] that means the redemption's plan
[57:58] when Jesus comes
[58:01] was put in motion
[58:05] it's it was the first coming of Christ
[58:08] but even before he loosed the Seven
[58:11] Seals
[58:13] in a parable for sure in Matthew 24
[58:17] he identifies in his day foreign
[59:01] [Music]
[59:02] is the vision of the opening of the
[59:05] first Uno
[59:11] of the book of redemption of the Lamb's
[59:14] Book of Life
[59:15] and Matthew 11
[59:18] verse 1 through 30.
[59:22] is the first seal
[59:25] the first coming of Christ and John is
[59:28] the first Elijah
[59:31] Forerunner of Malachi 4 6.
[59:35] part 1 of redemption has begun so in the
[59:40] days
[59:41] of the Lion of the tribe of Judah and
[59:44] then
[59:45] Jesus Christ
[59:49] Luke 1
[59:50] verse 13 to 17 Lucas
[59:55] the angel Gabriel
[59:57] who stands in the presence of God
[1:00:02] he declares that John the Baptist
[1:00:07] zechariah's son
[1:00:09] will be this first Elijah
[1:00:12] out of the book of
[1:00:16] malachias and in Matthew 11
[1:00:19] 14 and 15
[1:00:22] Jesus affirms Jesus what Gabriel told
[1:00:27] Zachariah
[1:00:28] said that John is Elijah which is to
[1:00:31] come okay
[1:00:33] for in the mouth of two and three
[1:00:35] Witnesses
[1:00:38] let everything be established Jesus
[1:00:43] what a book of Visions
[1:00:46] but remember this and and brother
[1:00:49] Branham also learned early in his
[1:00:51] ministry
[1:00:56] that you see a vision come to pass yes
[1:01:01] to all the components of the vision
[1:01:07] be present
[1:01:10] even if it's just the last step
[1:01:13] um
[1:01:16] even if the last step is is just a hat
[1:01:20] being moved um
[1:01:24] even if the last step is just a hat
[1:01:28] being moved
[1:01:30] and I use that example
[1:01:34] because if you listen to the message of
[1:01:36] brother Branham
[1:01:39] in the message wisdom versus Faith
[1:01:43] he speaks about this because he had a
[1:01:47] vision
[1:01:49] when he was a young man
[1:01:52] I believe it was a young girl or a young
[1:01:55] woman going to be healed
[1:01:58] and he saw himself in a certain person's
[1:02:01] home this is
[1:02:09] and going into the home and seeing
[1:02:13] certain people come in out of the home
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:18] and then he saw someone move a hat from
[1:02:21] one spot to another spot
[1:02:27] and he knew that was the timing
[1:02:31] to be able to say thus saith the Lord
[1:02:35] your child is healed
[1:02:37] and the child was dying suffering
[1:02:41] so he went to the home
[1:02:44] and he waited there yes if I remember
[1:02:47] correctly he waited hours
[1:02:52] but he got ahead of the vision
[1:02:55] and he tried to declare the child healed
[1:03:02] and the hat hadn't been moved
[1:03:05] and the people say that's okay brother
[1:03:07] random like they said and he left he
[1:03:11] said and he felt horrible and God told
[1:03:14] him you didn't wait for the vision
[1:03:17] God gave him Grace
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:21] and when he went back a certain person
[1:03:25] walked in the house
[1:03:27] and he said this is the person
[1:03:30] and he couldn't tell the person to do it
[1:03:33] the person had
[1:03:38] and then they moved into place
[1:03:40] and that person for whatever reason took
[1:03:43] that hat and moved it
[1:03:46] then he declared thus saith the Lord
[1:03:50] and the healing came immediately
[1:03:54] in the message wisdom versus Faith
[1:03:58] he speaks on this
[1:04:00] and in the message God revealing himself
[1:04:03] to his people yes
[1:04:11] it gives more detail about the event
[1:04:15] with that said let's turn to Revelations
[1:04:19] chapter 6 verse one and two again says
[1:04:25] verse 1 and 2.
[1:04:31] and it speeds like this John seen this
[1:04:34] vision
[1:04:36] and he is writing down what he sees
[1:04:39] and he's writing down what he's hearing
[1:04:42] is
[1:04:44] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:04:48] the seals
[1:04:50] and I heard as it were the noise of
[1:04:52] Thunder one of the four be sane come and
[1:04:55] see you
[1:04:57] Vivian
[1:04:59] s
[1:05:01] and I saw him Behold a white horse and
[1:05:04] he that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[1:05:07] was given unto him and he went forth
[1:05:09] conquering and to conquer
[1:05:11] yeah
[1:05:20] one of the four beasts said come and see
[1:05:25] it was to be a teaching
[1:05:27] the lamb must be present
[1:05:31] the noise of thunder
[1:05:35] must be there and one of the four beasts
[1:05:39] saying
[1:05:41] come and see it was a teaching that he
[1:05:46] was about to bring
[1:05:48] to pertaining to that day
[1:05:53] that day that very day he was
[1:05:55] ministering
[1:05:58] this was unfolding it was present tense
[1:06:02] prophecy happening
[1:06:05] so there must be one of these four
[1:06:08] beasts present also
[1:06:13] it doesn't tell us which one
[1:06:16] which one of the four beasts was present
[1:06:20] if you're looking for a Bible answer see
[1:06:26] you'll find you'll find the answer in
[1:06:28] the Bible
[1:06:30] and Revelations 4 gives us the order
[1:06:35] Revelations 4 reveals which was the
[1:06:38] first in in Revelations
[1:06:41] this first Beast so in Revelations 4 7
[1:06:46] the answer to the question is
[1:06:52] and the first Beast was like a lion
[1:06:57] so the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:07:01] would bring the Plan of Redemption to
[1:07:04] Israel
[1:07:06] the Fig Tree
[1:07:08] the Jewish people
[1:07:10] for this lion is King of the Jews
[1:07:15] Revelation 6 1 and 2.
[1:07:20] was the vision of what John thought
[1:07:26] was a future event
[1:07:29] when in fact
[1:07:33] it was present tense
[1:07:36] and what's happening
[1:07:38] even as he was seeing the vision
[1:07:42] and would continue to unfold please
[1:07:49] for the next 300 years
[1:07:56] Visions have a life span
[1:08:01] and Revelations
[1:08:04] when John saw it
[1:08:06] it had been unfolding
[1:08:15] for 4 000 years
[1:08:18] and today this day yeah
[1:08:22] it has not expired yet
[1:08:25] God still has a representation
[1:08:29] like a lamb slain
[1:08:33] forever interceding
[1:08:36] for our sins
[1:08:39] for our healing foreign
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:09:12] the vision begins to unfold in its
[1:09:16] reality
[1:09:19] which was more than 30 years
[1:09:27] before John saw the vision of this
[1:09:30] modern event
[1:09:34] so the first seal
[1:09:36] was unfolding in Matthew 11.
[1:09:40] even before it was written
[1:09:44] in Revelation 6.
[1:09:47] it must have been
[1:09:52] wait it must have been uh
[1:09:58] the Thunder of God for a prophet told us
[1:10:02] a thunder is the voice of God
[1:10:06] when a seal opens
[1:10:09] and Matthew 11 and Matthew was the first
[1:10:13] still open
[1:10:14] because the vision said of the first
[1:10:17] sealed
[1:10:22] that means that means when John saw the
[1:10:25] vision
[1:10:27] it was the opening
[1:10:31] watch this Jesus in another Parable
[1:10:35] Jesus
[1:10:42] it's Saint John 12 and 28.
[1:10:48] uses the example when he preaches the
[1:10:50] first seals
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:53] go back and hear it
[1:11:06] but this is what we're focusing on this
[1:11:08] morning so Jesus in a parable in Saint
[1:11:12] John 12 and 28
[1:11:16] six days before the Passover before and
[1:11:19] before he's going to be crucified says
[1:11:21] yes
[1:11:23] verse 28 says father glorify thy name
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:33] saying I have both glorified it and will
[1:11:36] glorify it again
[1:11:39] what does that mean
[1:11:41] S I have both glorified it
[1:11:45] is the first coming of Christ the first
[1:11:47] seal opened
[1:11:50] and we'll glorify it again
[1:11:52] the second coming of Christ and the
[1:11:55] seventh seal open
[1:11:57] so what happened in between the first
[1:12:00] and the seventh seals
[1:12:03] the name wasn't glorified
[1:12:06] the name was lost
[1:12:10] the Roman Catholic Church pushed the
[1:12:12] name of Jesus in a back corner
[1:12:15] Iglesia Romana
[1:12:17] they raised up the name to pray to the
[1:12:20] Saints
[1:12:24] pray to pray to Mary
[1:12:26] Maria pray to James
[1:12:30] even pray to Leo if you want
[1:12:34] but don't pray to Jesus
[1:12:38] they pushed the name into the Dark Ages
[1:12:43] they took the book away from the people
[1:12:48] raise up the name of the Pope
[1:12:51] the Viper of Christ
[1:12:54] and when you get baptized do it in
[1:12:58] titles in the name of the Father the Son
[1:13:01] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:03] no they took the name away from the
[1:13:06] people
[1:13:08] but Jesus said here when the seventh
[1:13:12] seal is open
[1:13:13] I'll glorify that name again
[1:13:19] I'll give my people the Revelation
[1:13:23] under the opening of that seventh seals
[1:13:28] we'll lift up the name of Jesus again
[1:13:31] will not be ashamed of the names
[1:13:36] don't be ashamed to this to say this
[1:13:39] seven seal is open
[1:13:44] has begun and I mean it
[1:13:49] is
[1:13:51] I think John 12 28 29. the people
[1:13:55] therefore that stood by and heard it
[1:13:57] said that it thundered
[1:14:06] that's all they heard
[1:14:09] but others said no no
[1:14:12] an angel spake to him
[1:14:16] it started opening up to somebody
[1:14:18] someone was getting the Revelation
[1:14:21] the Thunder of God
[1:14:24] it was the voice of God
[1:14:28] answering Sid I guess it was
[1:14:30] contest ideas
[1:14:34] Jesus answered and said
[1:14:37] those of you that said an angel spake
[1:14:41] no those of you that said an angel spoke
[1:14:48] you're right
[1:14:51] and the voice came not because of me
[1:14:55] for me
[1:14:57] but for your sakes
[1:15:01] The Voice came out of me the Thunder of
[1:15:04] God the voice of God
[1:15:07] but it was for your sakes
[1:15:10] you they can say an angel
[1:15:17] to me I mean the seventh angel except
[1:15:21] the monkey I heard an angel speak
[1:15:24] in the days of the voice when the
[1:15:26] seventh angel
[1:15:28] when he should begin to speak
[1:15:33] the mysteries of God will be finished
[1:15:38] because he'll speak the spoken word
[1:15:46] in the message the first seal
[1:15:49] brother Branham says this is now let us
[1:15:52] find the symbols
[1:15:55] now let us find the symbols muchos
[1:15:58] symbols
[1:16:01] we found out what the thunder means
[1:16:06] he said that's perfectly yes we know
[1:16:10] that see
[1:16:11] so we don't even have to tell you what
[1:16:13] that is because he says we know that
[1:16:15] already
[1:16:16] I was sitting in Florida years ago
[1:16:20] and I mentioned this quote
[1:16:23] and we're talking is
[1:16:27] and I did it purposely of course all at
[1:16:31] this table we we read the message
[1:16:35] so we know what a thunder is perfectly
[1:16:38] we can see that
[1:16:43] and everybody's quiet
[1:16:49] no one says a thing and then a brother
[1:16:53] next to me goes and
[1:17:45] history tells us about A.D 67 to 69.
[1:17:55] so long before
[1:17:58] the Book of Revelations was a written
[1:18:01] word
[1:18:04] so long before the Book
[1:18:08] of Revelations
[1:18:10] was a written word
[1:18:13] it was a spoken word
[1:18:15] and Jesus was unfolding he is
[1:18:20] and losing the first seal
[1:18:23] and the Book of Revelations
[1:18:26] wasn't even written
[1:18:50] the book is a result
[1:18:53] of God sharing his mind and thought with
[1:18:57] us
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:20] so now Revelation 6
[1:19:22] foreign
[1:19:33] this is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:19:37] and and and Revelation 6 1 says the lamb
[1:19:41] opened the book
[1:19:43] the Lamb's Book of Life was opened by
[1:19:45] the lamb the
[1:19:47] liberos
[1:19:53] but the lion said
[1:19:56] let me first
[1:19:58] Give It To My People
[1:20:01] Israel Israel the victory
[1:20:05] and yet The Lion and the lamb are just
[1:20:07] ministries of the same person
[1:20:14] oh how God hides himself from the wise
[1:20:17] and prudence
[1:20:19] and reveals it unto born-again Believers
[1:20:23] is
[1:20:27] Jesus is teaching here in Matthew 11 1.
[1:20:33] and we'll read it again once again
[1:20:36] and it came to pass when Jesus had made
[1:20:39] an end of commanding his twelve
[1:20:41] disciples he departed then to teach and
[1:20:44] to preach in their cities there is the
[1:20:47] come and see
[1:20:50] there is
[1:21:00] Matthew 11 1.
[1:21:03] Mateo Mateo San Mateo
[1:21:07] Saint Matthew 11 and verse 1.
[1:21:12] this is
[1:21:19] here he is both The Lion and the lamb
[1:21:26] and his Thunder is
[1:21:28] that he is now going to teach them
[1:21:32] by the spoken word
[1:21:34] for it had not been written yet
[1:21:37] oh this is the thunder That Shook the
[1:21:41] world in that day
[1:21:43] I was going to create a new generation
[1:21:48] just like in the beginning he said let
[1:21:52] there be
[1:21:53] Southwest
[1:21:56] let there be light
[1:21:58] loose and there was yeah and it wasn't
[1:22:01] even written
[1:22:03] it was just a spoken word alone
[1:22:07] so he's now going to do what he did
[1:22:09] again in Genesis
[1:22:12] he's going to bring forth the family of
[1:22:15] God
[1:22:16] and give them a Plan of Redemption
[1:22:19] by the spoken word
[1:22:21] it had not been written yet
[1:22:24] this is the thunder that John heard in
[1:22:28] the in Revelation 6 1.
[1:22:31] what was that Thunder it was the voice
[1:22:35] of God
[1:22:36] when this first seal was opening
[1:22:39] part one to save you to change you to
[1:22:45] mold you into His Image
[1:22:47] into the stature of a perfect man Jesus
[1:22:51] Christ Jesus
[1:22:54] thank you
[1:22:56] he's teaching them in Matthew 11. how to
[1:23:00] recognize their day and their message
[1:23:04] of Grace no more under the law no must
[1:23:08] because the lawn the prophets
[1:23:11] or until John foreign
[1:23:56] he would say repent and be baptized in
[1:24:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:05] is the same yes every day and forever
[1:24:08] oh once you see him in his word
[1:24:12] you can look every time and you can see
[1:24:15] him doing the same thing
[1:24:18] so Jesus Jesus was teaching on Malachi 4
[1:24:22] 5 and 6.
[1:24:25] here in Matthew 11 again connecting it
[1:24:29] with Malachi 3
[1:24:31] showing them this day these scriptures
[1:24:34] were fulfilled
[1:24:37] that very day he was preaching
[1:24:40] these scriptures are being fulfilled
[1:24:44] that and it's and that John is this
[1:24:47] Elijah
[1:24:48] that the angel Gabriel declared
[1:24:52] and that the Lord Of Glory is come
[1:24:57] and it's him this is all present tense
[1:25:00] right now
[1:25:02] the Thunder of God is bringing the word
[1:25:04] present tense this is happening right
[1:25:06] now folks
[1:25:10] this is Revelation 6 1 and 2.
[1:25:16] and Jesus added more detail Jesus to the
[1:25:21] opening of the first seal
[1:25:23] at one time
[1:25:26] you and I you say yo you thought there
[1:25:29] was only two verses
[1:25:32] now in Matthew 11 hours Jesus adds 30
[1:25:36] more verses of details
[1:25:40] of what is happening under the opening
[1:25:45] of the first seal which is part one of
[1:25:50] redemption can there is yet so much more
[1:25:54] by the spoken word
[1:25:57] represented in scripture
[1:26:00] by the noise of a thunder
[1:26:03] boss
[1:26:06] Revelations
[1:26:09] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:26:12] the seals
[1:26:15] John said I saw it I actually saw it I
[1:26:20] am an eyewitness it happens
[1:26:25] he really did see a lamb
[1:26:28] he saw a real lamb
[1:26:31] somehow with a scroll foreign
[1:26:55] thought it would be nice and quiet
[1:27:00] because I've seen the priests pull off
[1:27:02] seals
[1:27:04] on on Scrolls and you can't unless
[1:27:08] you're close you don't hear nothing
[1:27:11] but this caught my attention he said
[1:27:16] when the lamb took the seal off of this
[1:27:19] scroll
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:29] you know what it was
[1:27:31] it turned out
[1:27:34] uh civil bill
[1:27:37] it turned out that it was one of the
[1:27:40] four be sane come and see
[1:27:46] what is the thunder okay it's the voice
[1:27:49] of God
[1:27:52] what was happening in Matthew 11
[1:28:00] a teaching had begun come and see
[1:28:05] that's the first thing that the Jesus
[1:28:08] that Matthew declares in discussion
[1:28:13] Jesus was going to go and teach and
[1:28:16] preach
[1:28:19] Revelation 6 1. one of the beasts
[1:28:29] what is a thunder it's the voice of God
[1:28:36] what was happening in Matthew 11. okay
[1:28:41] the first one
[1:28:43] redemption's plan
[1:28:46] unfolding
[1:28:48] for the Fig Tree Israel
[1:28:51] Israel and the bride
[1:28:55] a gentile Church
[1:28:58] the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:29:01] you can say in your heart
[1:29:04] that's me hey so I'm in this message
[1:29:07] this morning
[1:29:09] Matthew 11 2.
[1:29:13] let's read it now when John had heard in
[1:29:16] the prison The Works of Christ he sent
[1:29:20] two of his disciples
[1:29:40] Hillary told the people I must decrease
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:50] so he sent two of his disciples as he's
[1:29:52] in Lane inherits prison yes
[1:29:57] John was inherited to prison
[1:30:02] verse 3 says and said unto him for thou
[1:30:05] he that should come or do we look
[1:30:07] foreign
[1:30:13] Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:30:17] Go and show John again these things
[1:30:20] which you do hear and see
[1:30:22] yes
[1:30:25] what things that cost us these details
[1:30:30] that are under the opening of the first
[1:30:33] seal
[1:30:35] the details we're going to start reading
[1:30:37] on
[1:30:39] because it's the same things
[1:30:42] that would repeat
[1:30:44] under the opening of the seventh seals
[1:30:48] because first seal is his first coming
[1:30:53] because first seal is his first coming
[1:30:56] is
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:31:00] and as the seventh seal is
[1:31:05] his second coming
[1:31:08] now watch the pattern here
[1:31:11] that will repeat in our days
[1:31:14] which is history for us already it's
[1:31:17] happened
[1:31:19] the seven seal has opened
[1:31:23] or we wouldn't be seeing these same
[1:31:25] details
[1:31:28] so Jesus says in Matthew 11 5
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:42] that
[1:31:44] he did bring Revelation okay
[1:31:48] that he was that he was part of the
[1:31:50] first seal
[1:31:54] he said tell John this
[1:31:58] start with this so he'll understand
[1:32:04] here
[1:32:19] tell them the dead are raised up
[1:32:23] and tell them that the poor have the
[1:32:25] gospel preached to them
[1:32:29] my parents were in some of the meetings
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:35] the healing campaigns of William Branham
[1:32:39] they told me you know what son
[1:32:43] the blind song
[1:32:47] you know what son the lame walk
[1:32:50] OS you know what son I the deaf heard
[1:32:55] you know what son the dead were raised
[1:32:59] up
[1:33:01] I shook the hand of one of those men uh
[1:33:06] English
[1:33:14] who dropped dead in the meetings
[1:33:21] his wife sister Ruth
[1:33:24] when you
[1:33:28] was a registered nurse
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:33:34] and brother Wade dropped brother Edmond
[1:33:36] when he dropped on the ground
[1:33:40] she checked his vital signs
[1:33:46] pull back the eyelids
[1:33:48] but then says his eyes were gone it was
[1:33:51] just all white
[1:33:54] she says he's dead
[1:33:56] he says calm down
[1:34:01] he says if you're going to die
[1:34:04] there ain't no better place in the house
[1:34:06] of God just
[1:34:10] let God work see what he's going to do
[1:34:14] and he walked down off the pulpit he
[1:34:18] is I believe it was in Branham
[1:34:19] Tabernacles
[1:34:23] he said he said I've seen many people
[1:34:25] die
[1:34:27] he said he was dead
[1:34:30] then he laid his hands upon him
[1:34:33] ask God to bring back his life
[1:34:43] he said brother we opened his eyes
[1:34:53] you say did it happen
[1:34:55] you say it did it happen
[1:34:58] I shook his hand
[1:35:04] what was it
[1:35:07] Jesus told these two disciples go tell
[1:35:10] John
[1:35:13] so he'll know that it's the opening of
[1:35:16] the first seal
[1:35:19] the blind received their sight
[1:35:22] the lame walk
[1:35:25] the lepers are cleansed
[1:35:27] the deaf here
[1:35:31] and the poor had the gospel priests
[1:35:35] sounds like a 20th century Ministry to
[1:35:39] me as say oh yeah
[1:35:47] sounds like the opening of The Seven
[1:35:49] Seals
[1:35:51] because this was the opening of the
[1:35:54] first seal okay
[1:35:55] and if Jesus Christ is the same
[1:35:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:36:02] that's the way he'll open the seventh
[1:36:04] one yes
[1:36:07] Jesus Jesus now adding details
[1:36:11] to the opening of the first seal
[1:36:16] telling us the
[1:36:19] processos of the opening of the seal
[1:36:22] part one of the Plan of Redemption
[1:36:26] salvation salvation and restoration
[1:36:30] Elijah the Forerunner
[1:36:33] Messiah King of the Jews yes
[1:36:37] and the Antichrist ride
[1:36:46] verse 6 of Matthew 11.
[1:36:49] because as Jesus is bringing this
[1:36:52] Revelation to the people revelation
[1:36:57] they're resenting it
[1:37:02] they're resenting it they don't like it
[1:37:07] and he catches he discerns that spirit
[1:37:13] and rather than rebuke those that don't
[1:37:16] want it
[1:37:19] He blesses those few that do want it
[1:37:24] that's a principle we can use ourselves
[1:37:27] in our lives
[1:37:29] rather than think that you got to push
[1:37:31] someone down because they're not they're
[1:37:33] not liking what you say
[1:37:37] he wasn't going to inject something
[1:37:39] negative in his sermon here
[1:37:43] instead he makes it positive
[1:37:47] to end
[1:37:49] and he said you know what
[1:37:52] it's all these people
[1:37:55] but he says and blessed is he
[1:38:20] is quiet
[1:38:23] amen Jesus
[1:38:26] two those one in a million
[1:38:31] Matthew 11 7.
[1:38:34] and as they departed Jesus began to say
[1:38:37] unto the multitudes concerning John
[1:38:41] Jesus
[1:38:44] you see they were leaving
[1:38:46] foreign
[1:39:11] as they departed Jesus began to say unto
[1:39:15] the multitudes that were offended
[1:39:17] concerning John
[1:39:47] a prophet
[1:39:50] yes he says
[1:39:53] and more than a prophet
[1:39:56] because this Prophet
[1:40:00] is a forerunner to the first coming of
[1:40:04] Christ this Prophet is the prophet is
[1:40:07] Elijah who will turn the hearts of the
[1:40:10] fathers to the children
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:15] verse 10 for this is he of whom it's
[1:40:19] written behold I send my messenger
[1:40:22] before thy face which will prepare thy
[1:40:24] way before thee is
[1:40:32] if they were Bible readers
[1:40:36] they would know that Jesus was quoting
[1:40:39] Melody
[1:40:45] if they weren't Bible readers
[1:40:50] but if they weren't
[1:40:55] they would say who gives you a right
[1:40:58] to say that's John
[1:41:01] I don't I don't see the name John
[1:41:04] written in Malachi 3.
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:50] I'll give you
[1:41:54] power to overcome everything
[1:41:59] on
[1:42:04] barely I say unto you among them that
[1:42:07] are born of women there hath not risen a
[1:42:10] greater than John the Baptist
[1:42:17] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:42:19] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than him
[1:42:28] you is he greater or is he the least is
[1:42:33] both is
[1:42:36] because he said amongst them that are
[1:42:38] born of women that's everybody
[1:42:45] but he says but now we're standing he
[1:42:48] that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:42:50] we must
[1:42:52] verse 11. this is
[1:43:00] now he's talking about the mystical body
[1:43:05] now he's talking about the born-again
[1:43:07] Believers
[1:43:09] now he's talking about the wheat and not
[1:43:12] the tares
[1:43:15] because now John has come to be a
[1:43:18] servant
[1:43:21] to those people
[1:43:24] the faithful Ministries
[1:43:27] there has an amongst men born or women
[1:43:29] there's no one's greater than the
[1:43:31] faithful Ministry
[1:43:38] but the faithful Ministry when it comes
[1:43:41] to the kingdom of God
[1:43:46] we are the least senor
[1:43:55] the same Lord we all have as is
[1:43:59] that Jesus Christ Matthew 12. and from
[1:44:03] the days of John the Baptist until now
[1:44:06] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[1:44:09] and the violent take it by force
[1:44:18] there's that Rider
[1:44:24] who went forth conquering and to conquer
[1:44:27] okay
[1:44:32] he's causing the Kingdom of Heaven to
[1:44:35] suffer violence
[1:44:38] Lucifer the white horse rider Lucifer
[1:44:42] and his Generations
[1:44:46] are taking it by force
[1:44:49] it's the white horse rider
[1:44:53] of Revelation 6 2 the Corona
[1:45:03] the Jewish or Orthodox priesthood is
[1:45:14] and Caesar of pagan Rome is
[1:45:19] this white horse rider Lucifer is a
[1:45:22] Lucifer
[1:45:24] is anointing them both
[1:45:27] to go out conquering
[1:45:33] with violence
[1:45:36] this little flock called The Bride of
[1:45:38] Jesus Christ
[1:45:42] the pattern of Genesis repeats
[1:45:47] what is the pattern
[1:45:49] and Cain killed his brother
[1:45:55] that's right
[1:45:57] Kane went out
[1:45:59] and he calls Abel because
[1:46:03] to suffer violence
[1:46:05] and with violence
[1:46:08] Valencia he took Abel by force
[1:46:13] and he killed him you see the pattern of
[1:46:17] God's word
[1:46:19] and all our lives in the Apostolic
[1:46:22] Church
[1:46:25] they told us this was the Christians of
[1:46:27] that day
[1:46:30] and they said and you can be that too
[1:46:34] and guess what a lot of us were much
[1:46:39] religious apostolics
[1:46:44] religious apostolics
[1:46:48] with a violent convulencia character
[1:46:51] character
[1:46:53] religious Pentecostals
[1:46:56] with an arrogant and violent nature
[1:47:05] so who was riding in the in the lives of
[1:47:07] these religious men
[1:47:13] not the Holy Spirit and from the days of
[1:47:17] John the Baptist until now the Kingdom
[1:47:19] of Heaven suffereth violence and the
[1:47:21] violent take it by force
[1:47:23] verse 12. this is
[1:47:33] the White Horse the ride of the white
[1:47:35] horse rider Blanco
[1:47:39] remember Isaiah 53
[1:47:42] which is also
[1:47:44] the opening of the first seals
[1:47:48] the first coming of Christ
[1:47:50] showing us more details
[1:47:53] to the same event but in verse 9 of
[1:47:58] Isaiah 53 the
[1:48:02] it says this about Jesus
[1:48:06] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:48:08] and with the rich in his death
[1:48:11] because he had done no violence
[1:48:16] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[1:48:19] Isaiah 53 and verse 9 for real
[1:48:25] they say
[1:48:27] is
[1:48:35] in him was no violence
[1:48:39] and in his in in his followers was no
[1:48:42] violence
[1:48:44] for they believed him
[1:48:46] they believed on his message of
[1:48:49] perfection
[1:48:52] Perfection they believed on his message
[1:48:55] of perfection
[1:49:00] where he said blessed are the
[1:49:03] peacemakers
[1:49:05] that blessed are the violent no
[1:49:10] so it wasn't Jesus as followers
[1:49:13] Jesus what about John's followers
[1:49:16] who were repented and baptized
[1:49:19] in the River Jordan and after they
[1:49:23] repented
[1:49:26] they wanted to know what else can we do
[1:49:30] to make our lives right
[1:49:34] to be better fathers to be better
[1:49:38] mothers
[1:49:39] Republicans
[1:49:45] we feel our sins have been cleansed
[1:49:49] but the people ask them
[1:49:52] they were baptized
[1:49:55] what shall we do then okay
[1:49:58] everyone baptized
[1:50:00] if you've truly repented
[1:50:03] it's the question now what's the next
[1:50:07] question on your heart is
[1:50:09] Lord what would you have me to do now
[1:50:14] he answered Jesus Jesus or John the
[1:50:19] Baptist he answered saith unto them
[1:50:22] foreign
[1:50:52] he answered and said unto him he that
[1:50:54] had two coats
[1:50:58] or two shoes or those Zapatos for two
[1:51:01] ten dollar bills
[1:51:04] let him impart to him that hath none
[1:51:09] and he that has meat
[1:51:12] let him do likewise
[1:51:15] verse 12 of Luke of Luke 3.
[1:51:20] this is Luke chapter three we started in
[1:51:23] verse 10 now we're in verse 12. then
[1:51:26] came also the publicans to be baptized
[1:51:29] they were tax collectors
[1:51:31] they were Jews
[1:51:34] they were hated by their people
[1:51:36] because they felt that they had turned
[1:51:38] their backs on them
[1:51:39] because then came also the publicans to
[1:51:42] be baptized
[1:51:44] and repent the Clinton said unto him
[1:51:46] Master what shall we do
[1:51:49] it
[1:51:59] you see genuine repentance
[1:52:04] it makes you ask the question
[1:52:08] Lord have been baptized in your name
[1:52:12] now what do you want me to do what's
[1:52:15] next in my Christian walk
[1:52:20] and he said John said unto them
[1:52:24] exact no more than witches appointed you
[1:52:30] in other words okay if your job requires
[1:52:33] you to ask five dollars from every
[1:52:35] person
[1:52:41] don't ask for 10.
[1:52:43] and put five in your pocket
[1:52:48] amen
[1:52:50] because that's what they were doing
[1:52:53] the spirit was Discerning them
[1:52:57] and the soldiers likewise who had been
[1:53:00] baptized
[1:53:02] saying
[1:53:06] we're soldiers in Rome
[1:53:09] what shall we do okay and he said unto
[1:53:12] them
[1:53:14] as the spirit discerned their hearts
[1:53:18] he said You Soldiers
[1:53:21] this is a device I'm going to give you
[1:53:24] yes
[1:53:26] this is the advice
[1:53:29] do violence to no man
[1:53:32] how do you do that as a Roman soldier
[1:53:37] you gotta say I quit
[1:53:41] I'm now a soldier for Jesus
[1:53:46] wait a minute you signed up to be a
[1:53:48] marine for four years
[1:53:53] yes but I just got baptized and now I'm
[1:53:56] a soldier for Jesus
[1:53:58] and the advice for a soldier
[1:54:02] is
[1:54:05] you is don't do violence
[1:54:09] but get the Marines
[1:54:13] to do violence the army trains you to do
[1:54:17] Finance
[1:54:19] the Navy trained you
[1:54:23] the Air Force trains you
[1:54:26] to jump into an F-35
[1:54:30] and drop bombs that kills hundreds of
[1:54:33] thousands in a moment
[1:54:36] but one of those soldiers gets baptized
[1:54:41] the Holy Spirit advises
[1:54:45] now that you're in my army
[1:54:48] army do
[1:54:51] not as well
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:54] neither accused
[1:55:02] it's verse 14.
[1:55:07] of Matthew 11.
[1:55:09] and as the people were in expectation
[1:55:11] verse 15 of Luke 3. verse 15 of Luke 3.
[1:55:17] and as the people were in expectation
[1:55:19] and all men must in their hearts of John
[1:55:23] whether he were Christ or not
[1:55:32] where were they asking this question is
[1:55:39] the Holy Spirit discerned them
[1:55:46] the spirit of discernment in John Christ
[1:55:51] they didn't ask him
[1:55:54] right out no no
[1:55:57] no
[1:55:59] no in their hearts they were thinking
[1:56:03] the Holy Spirit
[1:56:07] and without them even saying it
[1:56:10] John answered their question
[1:56:15] John answered saying unto them all
[1:56:20] I indeed baptize you with water
[1:56:24] and I know that's been something great
[1:56:26] in your in in your life now
[1:56:30] but one mightier than I cometh
[1:56:36] the latchet of her shoes I'm not worthy
[1:56:39] to unloose
[1:56:43] in other words I'm not even I'm not even
[1:56:46] a foot wash flunky uh
[1:56:50] yes yes correct
[1:56:53] he says
[1:56:56] the latchet of shoes I'm not worthy turn
[1:56:58] loose he shall baptize you with the Holy
[1:57:01] Ghost and Fire
[1:57:06] so now we sing that these that came
[1:57:10] who suffered the kingdom of God to
[1:57:12] suffer violence
[1:57:16] and now we see verse 12.
[1:57:20] where it says from the days of John the
[1:57:22] Baptist until now verse 12 of Matthew
[1:57:24] 11.
[1:57:26] the kingdom of God suffereth violence
[1:57:30] and the violent take it by force
[1:57:33] that this was not John's followers
[1:57:37] this was not Jesus's followers
[1:57:40] who are causing the Kingdom of Heaven to
[1:57:43] suffer violence
[1:57:45] no this was the White Horse who had
[1:57:48] begun his ride
[1:57:49] [Music]
[1:57:52] Matthew 11 13
[1:57:54] Matthew 11 13 says for all the prophets
[1:57:58] and the law prophesied until John
[1:58:03] they say
[1:58:04] for all the prophets
[1:58:08] so then what should we expect after John
[1:58:12] okay
[1:58:14] we should expect
[1:58:16] the Elijah Ministry
[1:58:23] and verse 14 says
[1:58:26] exactly that
[1:58:28] if you will receive it
[1:58:31] this is Elijah which was to come
[1:58:35] in other words
[1:58:40] five and six simply says you should
[1:58:43] expect this Elijah
[1:58:45] and you should expect John to turn the
[1:58:48] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:58:53] and he did verse 15.
[1:58:57] Jesus saying Jesus he that hath ears
[1:59:05] this statement is
[1:59:08] used at the end of every Church age
[1:59:22] and it's the opening of the Ephesian
[1:59:25] Church age
[1:59:28] it's the overlap of the Ephesian Church
[1:59:31] age
[1:59:34] with the Jewish age
[1:59:38] and the white horse rider yeah
[1:59:41] in its reality in its reality form and
[1:59:46] so former real begins his ride
[1:59:50] in the Days of Elijah John the Baptist
[1:59:54] now the pattern is set
[1:59:58] now we're also understanding that one
[2:00:01] seal all right
[2:00:04] does not open for each Church age
[2:00:18] throughout seven churches
[2:00:22] we're going to close with this one quote
[2:00:29] brother Brandon says in the second seal
[2:00:34] he tells us when the white horse rider
[2:00:37] got off his White Horse
[2:00:39] says
[2:00:49] and in paragraph 280 of the second seal
[2:00:56] let me read you this quote and close it
[2:00:58] is
[2:01:02] brother Ram says look now look notice
[2:01:05] when Satan
[2:01:07] cuando satanas now everybody
[2:01:11] that realizes that Satan controls all
[2:01:14] political powers of the world
[2:01:22] he said so
[2:01:25] excuse me in Matthew the fourth chapter
[2:01:30] and the eighth verse all the kingdoms
[2:01:34] belong to him
[2:01:37] that's the reason they fight War
[2:01:45] that's the reason they do everything
[2:01:48] with violence
[2:01:50] isn't that strange
[2:01:53] they was given this sword to kill one
[2:01:55] another yes
[2:02:00] now when he did he
[2:02:03] didn't have the ecclesiastical power yet
[2:02:06] but he started in with the demon of a
[2:02:09] false teaching
[2:02:15] which was the Ephesian Church age
[2:02:20] and that teaching became a Doctrine
[2:02:24] in the Smyrna churches
[2:02:28] and that Doctrine became incarnate in a
[2:02:31] in a false prophet yes
[2:02:37] and when he went just to the right place
[2:02:42] he never went to Israel now Israel he
[2:02:46] went to Rome for Aroma
[2:02:49] nicero that's where the council was held
[2:02:54] and they elected a head Bishop
[2:02:59] no reason
[2:03:02] and then by doing this the United church
[2:03:05] and state together
[2:03:10] then he dropped his bow
[2:03:14] the Jews because he didn't need them no
[2:03:17] more
[2:03:18] and he's scattered in the world over
[2:03:22] and he got off his White Horse
[2:03:27] and he got on his red horse
[2:03:31] for he can kill anybody that don't agree
[2:03:34] with him
[2:03:37] when did he get off his White Horse
[2:03:41] when they had this Consul in nice
[2:03:46] what year was that
[2:03:49] 325 A.D president
[2:03:53] when did the first first church age
[2:03:56] begin
[2:03:58] says about ad 50 he said she said but at
[2:04:03] the first coming of foreign
[2:04:06] and when did he change onto his red
[2:04:09] horse
[2:04:11] almost 300 years later
[2:04:14] and if you read your church age
[2:04:21] 325
[2:04:23] is the age of pergamus
[2:04:26] the third the third church
[2:04:30] so he says he says the council was held
[2:04:33] foreign
[2:05:27] watch him ride on into
[2:05:31] eternity
[2:05:35] with it see he unites both his powers
[2:05:38] together
[2:05:42] the same thing they're trying to do
[2:05:44] right now
[2:05:48] unite church and state
[2:05:52] 1963.
[2:05:54] it was it was in 1963.
[2:06:00] and brother Brahm says they're trying to
[2:06:03] do the same thing now
[2:06:07] Rome Roma trying to gather all her
[2:06:10] daughters together
[2:06:12] but it'll get even more than that
[2:06:16] because Rome again okay
[2:06:19] we'll try and make a deal with the Jews
[2:06:25] at the end
[2:06:27] what happened at the beginning
[2:06:32] the Jews entered into a union
[2:06:36] the high priest
[2:06:40] because he wanted an arrow okay
[2:06:44] because they were the Bow
[2:06:46] they couldn't put Jesus to death
[2:06:50] Rome prohibit them
[2:06:54] no one no one but Rome was allowed to
[2:06:57] crucify
[2:07:01] but but the religious priest of Israel
[2:07:05] they wanted him dead
[2:07:10] but the religious priest of Israel
[2:07:14] wanted Jesus did but they needed Rome to
[2:07:18] give them the area
[2:07:22] so Lucifer give
[2:07:25] words
[2:07:30] to give to Pontius Pilate
[2:07:35] so that Pontius Pilate
[2:07:38] the second highest office in Rome
[2:07:43] would give them the arrow
[2:07:47] to crucify Jesus
[2:07:50] and as the high priest is wondering what
[2:07:53] to say to get this job done
[2:07:59] he hears Pontius Pilate from his throne
[2:08:04] there at that open tribunal in Jerusalem
[2:08:10] and punches pilate was already warned of
[2:08:14] his wife
[2:08:19] have nothing to do with this
[2:08:21] righteousness
[2:08:23] and Pontius Pilate walks out before the
[2:08:25] mall
[2:08:28] Jesus at his side
[2:08:30] and he tells him what will I do with
[2:08:34] Jesus king of the Jews
[2:08:38] they said crucify him
[2:08:42] he says I find no fault in this man
[2:08:47] they said don't call him King of the
[2:08:49] Jews
[2:08:52] but the Holy Spirit was anointing him
[2:08:56] he says I will call him King of the Jews
[2:09:02] and then Lucifer Lucifer into the mind
[2:09:07] of the high priests
[2:09:26] he said
[2:09:31] the high priest of Israel now
[2:09:34] he says we have no King but Caesar
[2:09:43] you see where Israel was at now
[2:09:45] you see what he did
[2:09:50] Pontius Pilate goes
[2:09:57] how do I get out of this
[2:10:03] he says uh
[2:10:05] he was a very intelligent man
[2:10:09] he says well then
[2:10:11] it's the custom
[2:10:15] that we give you the people an
[2:10:18] opportunity to vote
[2:10:22] every year when something like this
[2:10:24] happens to let one man go free
[2:10:29] and there's there's other men that were
[2:10:31] crew today
[2:10:34] so I'm not gonna choose who to crucify
[2:10:39] so you choose
[2:10:41] shall I give you Jesus king of the Jews
[2:10:50] they said
[2:10:51] crucify Jesus
[2:10:54] give us Barabbas set him free
[2:10:59] that was the arrow
[2:11:04] of the invisible Union of Rome
[2:11:09] and they crucified the Son of God
[2:11:13] it's a pattern it repeats again
[2:11:18] Israel
[2:11:41] and he'll go down and make a deal with
[2:11:43] Israel
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:46] it'll be the last deal they make
[2:11:50] but this time
[2:11:53] will bring down the nation of Israel but
[2:12:00] not the remnant 144
[2:12:04] 000.
[2:12:06] they'll catch a revelation
[2:12:09] that Jesus was Messiah
[2:12:13] that he was King of the Jews and a
[2:12:16] faithful little remnant of Believers
[2:12:19] feel
[2:12:20] foreign
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:46] it'll keep you solid on the word of God
[2:12:51] you'll know his voice
[2:12:53] and you won't hear anyone else's voice
[2:12:59] William Brando has to return and have a
[2:13:02] personal Resurrection
[2:13:10] Jesus even said
[2:13:12] in a parable in parabola of the rich man
[2:13:16] who died and went to hell
[2:13:20] and of the bigger Lazarus that died
[2:13:25] and the Bible says Angels Came and
[2:13:28] packed them away to Adam's bosomes
[2:13:34] Deborah
[2:13:36] Paradise
[2:13:41] and he said the rich man burning in hell
[2:13:43] this is
[2:13:47] he said
[2:13:49] please send someone
[2:13:52] to tell my family
[2:13:56] so they can escape this hell that I mean
[2:14:03] send send back one of the prophets
[2:14:08] caused them to come back from the dead
[2:14:11] and they'll hear him
[2:14:15] Jesus said though one of the prophets
[2:14:18] raised from the dead
[2:14:22] they will not believe
[2:14:25] they have Moses
[2:14:28] let them read their Bibles and get a
[2:14:31] revelation
[2:14:35] because once someone has died
[2:14:38] they will not come back again to this
[2:14:40] world
[2:14:44] no
[2:14:46] the promises of rapture
[2:14:48] and we go to meet them
[2:14:52] they that have died and gone on will
[2:14:54] never come back here
[2:14:57] no the promises
[2:15:05] stay in the pattern of his word
[2:15:08] and remember Jesus Christ

[2:15:16] forever
[2:15:18] always come in by the door
