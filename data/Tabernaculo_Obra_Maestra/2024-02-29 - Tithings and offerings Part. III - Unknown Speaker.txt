his time to go that God will just take him sweetly off into his presence uh we're going to continue um ministering on tithing and offering this is the third part we could please stand this evening we could read his word we're going to begin in U Matthew chapter 10 uh verse 5 and the point in this uh fundamentally in this scripture that the labor is uh worthy of his um of his uh the the Workman is worthy of his meat the Workman is worthy of his meat Matthew 10 verse 5 these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them go not into the way of the Gentiles and into the any city of the Samaritans enter ye not let's pray father we give you thanks bless the word of your the reading of your word to each heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ am amen you can have your seats Matthew 10 verse 5 the Lord Jesus sending his 12 uh disciples and he commanded them warnings warnings and those these 12 Jesus sent forth and he commanded them and the Lord Jesus uh constantly or is always commands them gives them instruction that who he's sending go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not because he was the king of the Jews and he only came to the Jews in his first coming his firstborn son that that was he was giving everything that the father was going to give he was going to inherit the Jews the Lord Jesus gave the Book of Life Lamb's Book the Lamb's Book of Life and they rejected it in verse six and Jesus speaking to the twel apostles but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand not the law anymore a new kingdom a kingdom Celestial had had come near it was so near that you could you could feel the beat Healing The Sick verse eight heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils of Grace you receive freely you have received freely give this same Ministry that unfolded in the first coming it repeated so in his Second Coming it it repeated to to confirm his second coming in the 20th century in verse n instructions for his first coming for his ministers in his first coming provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses if God sends you you don't need to go with anything extra he said I will I will supply the the way I have sent you to minister I will I will give an anointment anointing to supply your needs in verse 10 nor script for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the Workman is worthy of his meat tithing and offering it is is something scriptural the Old Testament to the New Testament the principle of this of these two the uh work I'm sorry the Workman is worthy of his meat and that is such so the truth in the old test and Jehova put it in in order and that's a truth that carried over into the New Testament and the Order of the order of both of them outside of the principle the order is distinct one was a shadow and now we're living in the reality under a new testament it's no longer the the book of the law now it's the uh book of the Lamb B the Lamb's Book of Life in the uh First Corinthians in chapter 4 uh Paul says we are uh we are uh we are fools for Christ working with our hands 1 Corinthians 4: 10 we are fools for Christ's sake but you are wise in Christ we are weak but you are strong you honorable but we are despised Paul was saying that the the burden of of the ministry always um bumping into each other being challenged being challenged by the World by the the world even unto this present hour both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain Dwelling Place verse 12 and labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it Paul also and like the M Paul like the messenger of the second coming Paul also worked with his hands to to to sustain himself and in the beginning of his ministry he was taken out of his denomination and and he left his his denomination to follow to preach the Evangelist that it's not coming but it's here now and in the beginning of his ministry I worked with my own hands to to take the gospel am First Corinthians okay First Corinthians chapter 1 um I'm sorry First Corinthians chapter 4 verse one this it says like this let a man so account of us as the Ministers of Christ and the stewards of mysteries of God once more verse one and let a man so account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and the stewards of mysteries of God moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found that a man be found faithful not just to have a title and to take tithes and offerings he has to be faithful to be worthy to receive these things and if he receives it indignantly there's a day of judgment for him first Corinthians chapter 9 verse 13 and we know that it's a principle in the b in the scripture the Old Testament newest God never changed his mind of that of the order that he put is distinct from the old to the new but the principle to give tithes and offerings it stays firm in the Bible 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 13 it says like this do you not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar even so ha the Lord ordained they which preach the gospel should live the of the gopel first it talks of the Old Testament God instituted I'm sorry God also God in also placed the Old Testament uh Paul confirming and in verse 14 even so like before the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the Gospel but I have used none of these things um sorry hold ver verse 15 yes but I have used none of these things but I have used none of these things stop there but I have used none of these things you notice Paul he he repeats this attitude of Paul it repeats and in a man called William Brown this was the messenger of the first age the Ephesus age and it repeated in the seventh age with the seventh angel this the same attitude but I have used none of these things neither have I written these things that it should be done so done unto me Paul preached it but he was careful one maybe his a complex I don't preach it so that you do it unto me but I preach it because it's a truth of God neither have I written these things that it should be done be so done unto me for it would be better for me to die that than than that any man should make my glory in void for though I preach the gospel I have nothing the glory of for NE for necessity is laid upon me and the Apostle Paul he's giving us an attitude a correct attitude of one Minister because he was the first he was the angel to that age he began the unfolding of this message order what was in the Old Testament he brought it from the Shadow and he made it real how to apply it in this Gospel of the New Testament verse for although I preach the gospel I have nothing to Glory of for necessity is laid upon is to me if I preach not the gospel and for that to say evangelists in the time of um of the Prophet that they also preached Divine Healing and some had lifted up and one in particular and he he uh lifted up and stood he stood up before before thousands of people thousands of people and there was a campaign to to pray for the sick and he he stood up before the people the Lord showed me 10 people here right now and each one's going to give me $1,000 and we're going to begin to pray for the sick until the last one gives me a thous cuz the Lord told me and he keeps saying that the same thing another one another one two stood up up to 10 and then he began to pray and he had already received his his um his reward and it wasn't God and it wasn't eternal life when one begins to manipulate the the um kingdom of God the devil in that man that's all if it's not God who is [Music] it to give that attitude when Paul didn't have it when Paul's attitude was very distinct uh uh ver chapter 9 verse for though I preach the gospel I have nothing to Glory of for necessity is laid upon me y Woe Is unto me if I preach not the gospel if they don't give me one penny woe isn't to me I'm not preaching to receive a salary called me to preach the gopel that's all verse 17 for if I do this thing willingly I have a reward but if against my will a dispens ation of the Gospel is committed unto me what is my reward then barely that when I preach the gospel I may make the gospel of Christ without charge that I abuse not my power in the gospel what was his charge to receive tithes and offerings but I I haven't done it he was working with his hands to bring the gospel and to to after he had spoken of the Gospel after he spoke of the the correct order and what reward is it spoken of and then he says what is my reward then when I preach the gospel I may make the gospel of Christ the the gospel of Christ that I abuse not my power in the gospel his charge was to receive ties and offerings but his attitude was distinct that portion is of God it is in Hearts he put in Hearts to supply our needs but I can't worry about that to be on my knees looking the word of God for the for the people of will take care the rest and in the order he has he's take he's made in second Corinthians uh chapter8 here Paul he is admonishing the church over the offerings second Corinthians chapter 8 verse 1 is that verse 9 or verse verse n chapter 9 and verse one okay for it's touching the ministering to the Saints it is Superfluous for me to write to you for I know know the foreignness of your mind for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia he is lifting up these this group this group from Macedonia of Macedonia these Believers these Believers is that a was ready a year ago and your Zeal have provoked very many yet I have sent the Brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as I have said that as I said you may be ready Les happily if they of Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not you should be ashamed that but not to say in the same confident boasting therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the Brethren that they would go before unto you and make up before your Bounty where of ye had noticed before that that same might be ready as a matter of bounty and this I say verse six verse six okay but this I say he which s sparingly shall shall reap also sparingly and he Seth bountifully shall reap also bti he's not just taking the Old Testament and but bringing us to the real quoting from the Old Testament put order that's more correct in this in this day and taking the Church of Macedonia uh like an example for the Church of the Corinthians because they were the brothers of Macedonia that they saw their need and they were supplying so that Paul could go to the Corinthians and to bring the gospel to them what time after time after time because the Corinthians because the Corinthians weren't supplying it even though Paul was putting at the moment but he was putting all his his his effort and the brothers of ma had the same spirit and they gave their effort they saw Paul's effort they saw Paul's efforts and God anointed them to supply their needs for others for other churches you see it verse 7 chapter 9 every man according as he Pur purposeth in his heart so let him give not for God loveth a cheerful Giver we always uh quote that scripture but you know Paul did it in reference to the brothers in Macedonia and cheerfully uh thankfully they they uh pulled on the I'm sorry they they help they helped the ministry of Paul to take the gospel to another church to the Corinthians it wasn't for him to for them do you see it verse eight and God is able to make all grace abound toward you that you always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he had dispersed abroad that his righteousness remaineth forever now he that Min seed to the S both Minister bread for your food and multiply your seed s and increase the fruits of your righteousness Paul uh helping us to know either him or us can give too much to God we can't give enough to God or to his work that what he has given to us in righteousness and he would increase the fruits of all that we've given verse 11 being enriched in everything to all bountifulness which causes us through US Thanksgiving to God that's the reaction that when we give from the heart um a cheerful heart verse 12 for the Min administration of this service not only Supply the one of the Saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God while by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you Paul says thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift in each one that that gift is not the same for some have received for some to it's to receive for others it's to give it's a cycle it's a principle in the word of God the principle is from the Old Testament to the New Testament to preach the gospel to live the gospel the order that how it's applied is distinct one was the shadow a shadow can't be seen in reality what's the shadow is given giving but when the reality comes the image Christ in us the hope of glory we see him much more clearly we see that it's God working in Ministry in in the lady in the poor in the rich Paul said from in Macedonia they were poor and from their being poor they gave all in the in the book of First Timothy First Timothy uh chapter 3 Paul is speaking of the men that these are the men that who are worthy to receive the tithings and offerings this is the order not just to have a title to make you Worthy it has to be a life that you are living you have to be an example that you're giving in your place like as you're when you're in church and it's for the whole fivefold Ministry for deacons and the elders in the in the church it's for the um head of each home First Timothy chapter 3 uh this is a true saying process if a man desire the office of a bishop he desires the good work but a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife not like a minister said what that signifies brother Daniel that means one wife at a time that's what it signifies you see not two at the same time no you can you can get married again if that doesn't work out but it can only be one at a time no brother I have parents that are Catholic that have fulfilled that relatives relatives I'm sorry relatives and I have Pagan relatives that have done that as well they don't read the Bible and and they know what what we've just spoken to you something's not right there says and Paul begins and he begins to put all the requirements requirements because he was um anointed of God because he was the angel of the age of Ephesus because he was the first prophet uh to the Gentiles and it was for him to put everything in order from The Shadow to the reality says not given to wine and one minister in the message told me brother Daniel an elder man older than me he says uh brother FR why is it that when we get together you know for fellowship and of the drinks that we have why can't we also have a you know just a drink some wine well brother I say first of all because in the New Testament John the Baptist the angel came he told his father this man this first prophet that's no longer going to preach the law he's going to preach the kingdom of God he's not going to drink wine and and neither any way and then and then 2,000 years afterwards the angel of God and he he he comes with Elias Elijah with Elijah of the 20th century that was a boy there was a voice that came from the tree don't you ever drink or smoke you never U defile your body because I have a work for that you're going to do you are the seventh angel you are Elijah of the second coming both um forerunners forerunners they gave us the example how we are to conduct and behave ourselves in this uh age that we live in were they were the wave sheep of this last age to this to live in the ministry to preach to the the the people this is the way to Live Verse three verse three and not given to Wine no no Striker no greedy of filthy ler but patient uh not a brawler not Covetous one that ruleth well his own house his wife his children having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how to rule his own house for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God not a [Music] novice one with the exper life experiences verse seven moreover he must have a good report of them with which are without those that are outside of the church where you work in the colonies where you live the neighborhoods where you live they have a good report of them which are without lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil brother this is the fivefold ministry verse eight says likewise must the deacons be grave not double Tong not given to much wine not greedy of filthy ler holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience and let these also first be proved then let them to to life trials through life trials then let them use the office then let to use the office of a deacon being found blameless in the fivefold ministry and and also the F Ministry and the deacons the ministry of the church Paul says he gave us the details with a word he affirms it if they are ireh if they are blameless if they are blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderers slanderers sober faithful in all things the deacons let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses well for they that have the use of the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus these things I write I write these unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if if I car long that thou mayest know how to arest to behave thyself Paul putting the new order for us that are of the um the it's ours ours as lay members as lay members are tithing and offering our tithing and offering but it also falls on the ministry also like the like you the member you have to prove the ministry if if he's worthy of the tithes and the offerings of the Lord if you're not worthy find somebody that is worthy not because they yell loud they're are worthy Paul says Paul says ireh they have to be blameless the level is very high by the word of God a lot of times the same church brings down the standard of the ministry for the ministry no correct that's not right Paul says verse 15 but if I te long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of the Angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the worlded up to Glory only one man fulfilled all of this it was not an apostle it was not one Pastor it wasn't a teacher wasn't an evangelist not even a prophet even so uh who who fulfilled this it was the refilling fullness the fullness I'm sorry of the fivefold ministry it was the Lord Jesus Christ Christ in us the hope of glory in only him only him only the Lord Jesus Christ is worthy of his Tidings and of his offerings from the heart always give give your tithes and offerings to the Lord Jesus Christ clearly you're giving to to the uh hands of a man but you have to have the confidence that the man is going to be just that what what pertains to God what belongs what belongs to God and only the portion what corresponds you know in the old test the burnt offerings of the burnt offering that they did a lot of those it didn't touch the it didn't touch the Levites they didn't belong it didn't belong to the Levites the tithing of the burnt offerings it was 100% to Jehovah there was distinct offerings given of those of the Levites could only take one portion that God had spoken through the Moses and of A TRU the Tiding it was a Tiding of the Tiding that would come to the house of of God now the L Aon they were responsible for 100% of what came into the church but 100% didn't belong to them only one portion it was a tenth of the ti a tithing of the tithing a 10 of the 10th of aund of the 100 person that was a shadow the principle is the one that preaches the gospel that he lives the gospel now the example that Paul gave us the ad mestation that uh the lord gave us that he gave to his 12 disciples the 12 apostles that you that you keep yourself in the word preach the gospel and I'll take care of the rest they would go with a robe one one [Music] robe take one pair of shoes a pair of shoes don't take gold or silver nothing and I'll take care of you go concentrating 100% And preaching the gospel nothing else but now they're uh worried or concerned Brothers you you know you know everything costs if they're inviting me gas the hotel the three meals and everything else that comes you see if I forget my ti I got to buy a new tie you have to give me a guarantee before I go no brother it'd be better that you didn't come with that attitude never go to preach with that attitude if God is sending you that you go concentrating preaching the gospel praying Lord those that have a need this that are in Congo AFA in South Africa in in um England in France what need do they have they're all different cultures but Lord your your word has something for each one of those but if you go thinking I want to know how much they're going to give me you tear up the pattern that Jesus left for his disciples and Paul and for the fivefold ministry it was the same advice it was the same order that he put that the Holy Spirit put in order Gracia just you you don't have it there maybe you do I'm going add it later all the way to the top no quote no okay you can read it here that's okay read I read in Spanish here's English God will provide the works if you'll just walk in Grace you'll be more at work than you are right now with the ladies a society and all this other nonsense added into the church soup suppers to pay the preacher ever get such a thing as that in scripture pays the preacher heed to live by the ties of the people now but the prophet said he said that we he should live by the ties of the people but now they've interpret that to say the the ties belong to the pastor and they put a period there all the tidings see you've heard ministers say oh we didn't get enough offering to pay the rent of the building they didn't give enough now I'm going to have to use my tithes and and with not a good attitude he says you see but it's not like that the prophet said for 17 years like a pastor I never received a salary myself it's because it was a a small uh uh Church a small town people people I'm sorry and there was uh not enough and I was young and and strong and I worked in the um in the force with the government I liked it and everything worked out fine you see he never became like a legalist no no he utilize the the wisdom of Paul Paul also said I worked with my hands to to take to take care of myself to take the gospel clearly Paul got a received a lot of help especially in the last years because the last years of his life he was in prison in this prison to other for many years he was in prison to the government and the brothers will come why are you in the prisons and why because because of those prisons in those prisons in those prisons they wouldn't give him to eat they wouldn't ex change of clothes the brothers would he would be concerned of to take the gospel and when he couldn't go anymore there were other young men that that rose up the uh Apostolic um to take the gospel that Paul had given unto them Timothy Titus Deus and the list was very long and Paul mentions their names and men that were fa men that were blameless men that went that they would they would stand in front of death they would take the gospel there was a large list long list of men Apostles ordered of the ministry ordained of the ministry of apostle Paul in the beginning these men anointed of the Holy Spirit called of God the last thing that they were thinking who's going to pay for my my uh Journey my my trip no they weren't thinking that they would go and the the majority maity of it they were martyred for the for the cause of Christ but now you know the prophet said the preacher he should live for the tithes of the preacher he's to live by the ties of the people sorry but we had to get something else to do we had to put our part into it and they couldn't just make it up their another Society will do it God's way is right ties and offerings goes to the Levi which is the minister if everybody would pay their ties you wouldn't have to have any soup suppers to pay the preacher see they've adopted something else and they've left t uh to leave the tidings off say that you say that's of the Old Testament I an argument I'd like to see you prove it to me that's right you can't do it by God's word it's also a new testament order God made one order it can never be changed it has to remain that way so will be so it'll be the word of God now in closing and that would be in uh go to Matthew uh chapter 10 verse 5 and it says and these 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel to heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out the Devils freely you have received freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses nor script for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the Workman is worthy of his meat only go those those that are called and preach the gospel if I could anoint you to preach the gospel I will also anoint my people that they they that's in it's God working in both sides in the ministry and the people of God the ministry it has they have to concentrate and to dedicate themselves in their knees to search in the scriptures to search in the Lamb's Book of Life words of life for the church for the people amen if they have other thoughts they may not be called they may be unjust stewards they should be stewards that are just saying righteousness with the word of God for the people of God you can stand please Min the attitude of the minister that receives tithings
