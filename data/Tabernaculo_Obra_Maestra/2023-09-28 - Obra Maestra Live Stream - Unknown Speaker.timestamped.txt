[55:23] God bless you all this evening
[55:28] time good to be back in the house of the
[55:30] Lord
[55:32] good to see you all here also
[55:35] where two or three are gathered in my
[55:38] name
[55:39] there shall I be also
[55:42] and we certainly believe it
[55:44] because we've experienced it in our
[55:47] lives
[55:48] he's always been with us he promised to
[55:52] be in us
[55:53] he made these promises and he's kept his
[55:57] promises so how can we but keep
[56:00] believing him
[56:02] and holding to his word
[56:05] uh can I talked to my sister earlier
[56:09] today
[56:12] about two or three weeks ago
[56:16] she had had a real bad earache
[56:19] and she finally went into the doctor
[56:23] and they told her that she had a staph
[56:26] infection called MRSA
[56:28] in
[56:31] her ear canal
[56:34] so merca is a very
[56:37] um I'll have to say it's a very deadly
[56:40] bacteria
[57:04] and she doesn't like going to the doctor
[57:08] I think she refers death to go to the
[57:11] doctor
[57:12] but she was feeling real bad
[57:15] and that's when they she went to the
[57:17] doctor
[57:18] and this doctor told her that that's
[57:20] what she had yeah
[57:22] yeah and they've given her several
[57:24] different antibiotics
[57:27] nothing was working
[57:29] and I believe it was yesterday she went
[57:32] to an ear specialist
[57:36] and the doctor looked there he said well
[57:39] you do have a lot of infection
[57:47] so she was very happy
[57:50] and uh
[57:52] and we're grateful to God
[57:54] and the time will come but when we all
[57:58] have our time that God calls us home
[58:02] but as human beings we all fight for
[58:05] life also
[58:07] it's a very natural instinct
[58:13] we fight for life
[58:16] that's right when we get sick
[58:18] it might not be something very Grievous
[58:22] and yet we're looking for something that
[58:25] will help us
[58:27] and that's just the natural yes
[58:30] but God has provided for us in the
[58:33] Supernatural
[58:35] Divine Healing for the body
[58:38] and Divine Healing is
[58:41] the first fruits
[58:45] yes it's the first fruits of a promise
[58:49] that God has made us
[58:51] because as many times as God could heal
[58:54] this flesh body
[58:57] the Bible still tells us that flesh and
[59:02] blood will not inherit the kingdom of
[59:03] God
[59:08] our hope is a promise of God
[59:11] when this body of clay this vessel
[59:16] this Earthly house be dissolved
[59:19] he says I've already prepared for you
[59:22] a house not made from by hand
[59:26] it it'll it'd be it'll be just like
[59:29] stepping out of one house and stepping
[59:31] into another
[59:35] our eyes see a body stretched in a
[59:38] coffins
[59:42] [Music]
[59:45] God sees a man or a woman taking one
[59:48] more step from time into eternity
[59:52] yes
[1:00:06] tonight for a title
[1:00:08] on a Wednesday night I'd like to
[1:00:10] entitlement darkness is
[1:00:16] fast and True Light now shyness
[1:00:21] and for a subject I have a house not
[1:00:25] made with hands
[1:00:29] first John chapter 2.
[1:00:33] verse seven and eight
[1:00:36] and it reads like this as you return in
[1:00:38] your Bibles
[1:00:40] first John chapter 2.
[1:00:43] brethren
[1:00:49] I write no new commandment unto you
[1:00:52] but an old commandment which she had
[1:00:55] from the beginning
[1:00:56] the old commandment is the word which we
[1:00:59] have heard from the beginning
[1:01:09] again a new commandment I write unto you
[1:01:12] which thing is true in him and in you
[1:01:15] because the darkness is past and the
[1:01:18] True Light now shines
[1:01:27] True Light truly has Shine for us
[1:01:32] and it's made the Bible a new book
[1:01:36] and all the Loose Ends they've been put
[1:01:38] together
[1:01:41] turn to Second Corinthians
[1:01:45] verses one through four
[1:01:48] second Corinthians
[1:01:51] verses one through four
[1:01:54] and verse one reads like this
[1:01:58] for we know that of our Earthly house of
[1:02:01] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[1:02:03] building of God can house not made with
[1:02:06] hands Eternal in the heavens
[1:02:15] for in this we grown earnestly Desiring
[1:02:18] to be clothed upon with our house which
[1:02:21] is from Heaven
[1:02:27] if so be being clothed we shall not be
[1:02:30] found naked
[1:02:33] for we that are in this Tabernacle do
[1:02:36] groan being burdened not for that we
[1:02:39] would be unclothed but clothed upon that
[1:02:43] mortality might swallow up might be
[1:02:46] swallowed up of Life
[1:02:57] Heavenly Father we thank you once
[1:03:22] [Music]
[1:03:24] Lord if it pleased
[1:03:27] then may you be pleased to come down and
[1:03:30] speak to our hearts
[1:03:33] we ask all this in Jesus name
[1:03:36] amen amen you may be seated
[1:03:46] second Corinthians 5 verse 1 said for we
[1:03:50] know that if our Earthly House of this
[1:03:52] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[1:03:55] building of God and house not made with
[1:03:58] hands Eternal in the heavens
[1:04:02] is
[1:04:10] this house not made with hands is your
[1:04:12] Celestial body
[1:04:15] it's also called your theophany
[1:04:19] in First Corinthians 15
[1:04:23] verses 39 and 40.
[1:04:26] it reads like this
[1:04:29] all flesh is not the same flesh but
[1:04:33] there is one kind of Flesh amen another
[1:04:35] flesh of Peace another of fishes and
[1:04:38] another of birds
[1:04:46] there are also celestial bodies
[1:04:50] embodies
[1:04:52] but the glory of the celestial
[1:04:55] and the glory of the terrestrials
[1:05:03] First Corinthians
[1:05:05] 2.9
[1:05:07] but as it is written
[1:05:09] I have not seen nor ear heard neither
[1:05:14] hath entered into the heart of man the
[1:05:16] things which God hath prepared for them
[1:05:18] that love him
[1:05:29] there's a principle in God's word
[1:05:32] that we must hold in our hearts
[1:05:35] as we speak on the subject
[1:05:38] of a Celestial body before we have one
[1:05:42] it's called a theophany it's a
[1:05:46] supernatural body it's not natural at
[1:05:49] all and and he says this principle in
[1:05:53] God's word
[1:05:55] as we speak on this
[1:06:00] and our loved ones who have died in
[1:06:02] Christ
[1:06:04] in Genesis 1
[1:06:06] and
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:25] the Earth brought forth grass verse 12
[1:06:28] Genesis 1.
[1:06:29] and Herb building seed after his kind
[1:06:32] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[1:06:35] was in itself after his kind and God saw
[1:06:38] that it was good
[1:06:40] is
[1:06:50] and as you would keep reading you'd see
[1:06:53] the principle in Genesis is
[1:06:56] let every seed produce after its own
[1:06:58] kind of
[1:07:09] even even the word of God that created
[1:07:13] everything
[1:07:14] when God said in the beginning Let There
[1:07:17] Be lies
[1:07:18] it was a seed that brought that forth
[1:07:21] and the seed that brought that
[1:07:23] commandment forward
[1:07:27] for the spoken word was the original
[1:07:31] scene
[1:07:32] that birthed an entire world
[1:07:37] so everything that was set in God's word
[1:07:40] came forth from a seed even the light
[1:07:44] you might say well Adam was spoken into
[1:07:48] creation by God's spoken words
[1:07:53] yes and god-spoken word
[1:07:58] so there is a Supernatural seed
[1:08:01] there's a natural seed
[1:08:04] in second Corinthians chapter four
[1:08:07] number 16. Paul says for which cause we
[1:08:13] faint not but but though our outward man
[1:08:16] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[1:08:20] by day important
[1:08:28] verse 17 of second Corinthians 4 for our
[1:08:31] light Affliction which is but for a
[1:08:34] moment worketh for us a far more
[1:08:36] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory
[1:08:40] moment
[1:08:45] then he says here while we look not at
[1:08:48] the things which are seen
[1:08:52] that takes a born-again Believer to see
[1:08:55] to look at that
[1:08:57] because unless you're being
[1:09:33] because Paul had had an experience
[1:09:37] and Out of Body Experience
[1:09:40] he said he went into the third heaven
[1:09:43] he said he saw things that that that
[1:09:45] that no man could see
[1:09:49] he went beyond the curtain of time
[1:09:53] he says for we know that if our Earthly
[1:09:55] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:10:20] and it is possible Perfection is
[1:10:23] possible
[1:10:24] perfectionist promise
[1:10:28] and we all had the same beginning
[1:10:31] blessed is the porn Spirit
[1:10:33] when the world has beat you down
[1:10:37] but in your heart you say I don't want
[1:10:40] to live like this no more you take one
[1:10:44] step out of the pit
[1:10:45] and you take another step out of the
[1:10:48] peace
[1:10:55] so just as the inward man is renewed
[1:10:59] cuerto
[1:11:15] like you see here
[1:11:16] it didn't always look this way
[1:11:19] because this is the body of death
[1:11:26] and it develops
[1:11:30] and and one spiritual you know spiritual
[1:11:33] and the spiritual yeah Supernatural is
[1:11:37] developing a body
[1:11:39] as we look upon each other
[1:11:43] but as Believers in Christ
[1:11:47] that the body you're looking at with
[1:11:49] your eyes
[1:11:51] is not the body that's growing
[1:11:54] the body you're looking at with your
[1:11:56] eyes
[1:12:03] soul
[1:12:05] I saw
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:44] and as you all know it says Jesus Christ
[1:12:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:12:53] so if in the beginning
[1:12:56] it all began with the seeds and every
[1:12:59] seed produced of its kind
[1:13:02] and then if the soul in you be the seed
[1:13:05] of God
[1:13:07] it will produce a son and daughter of
[1:13:10] God
[1:13:24] even our soul
[1:13:26] so it's my desire
[1:13:28] to show our theophany
[1:13:31] our celestial bodies that begins
[1:13:36] and keep in mind the spoken words
[1:13:51] sometimes closer then we can even feel
[1:13:55] it
[1:14:11] they don't have to think about it
[1:14:16] I don't know if you've ever seen a sheep
[1:14:18] that's been sheared
[1:14:23] and when you see them it's like pulling
[1:14:27] a turtle out of the shell
[1:14:29] so they got a tiny little body
[1:14:32] little little gangly legs
[1:14:35] and the sheep look the same
[1:14:38] when they're sheared
[1:14:41] and they take all their walls
[1:14:44] they're one-fourth the size of what they
[1:14:46] were before
[1:14:48] but they're not worried
[1:14:51] they'll never have wool again
[1:14:53] it's something within them
[1:14:56] that produces the world they don't even
[1:14:59] have to think about it they just have to
[1:15:03] eat foods
[1:15:05] and if the Believers it's nothing but
[1:15:08] cheap food
[1:15:10] it will produce every promise of God in
[1:15:13] your life
[1:15:16] foreign
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:53] spiritually speaking the soul is a seed
[1:15:58] and remember some is sweet
[1:16:03] seeds it was the voice of Jesus some are
[1:16:08] children of God and some are children of
[1:16:10] saint
[1:16:12] remember the
[1:16:13] Prince
[1:16:15] Jesus revealed it in Matthew 13.
[1:16:19] verses 24 to 30.
[1:16:22] turn with me there to Matthew 13.
[1:16:39] and it reads like this
[1:16:42] okay
[1:16:47] therefore speak I to them in parables
[1:16:50] because they see not and hearing they
[1:16:53] hear not foreign
[1:16:59] do they understand
[1:17:04] the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by
[1:17:07] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[1:17:08] understand and see and you shall see and
[1:17:10] shall not proceed yes
[1:17:17] well there's people's heart is wax gross
[1:17:20] and their ears are full of our dull of
[1:17:22] hearing and their eyes they have closed
[1:17:24] lest at any time they should see with
[1:17:27] their eyes here with their ears and
[1:17:29] should understand with their heart and
[1:17:30] should be converted and I should heal
[1:17:32] them
[1:17:34] is
[1:17:43] God blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:17:45] and your ears for they here
[1:17:52] in in verse in verse 24 universities
[1:17:58] Jesus says again another Parable putting
[1:18:02] forth unto them saying the Kingdom of
[1:18:04] Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed
[1:18:07] good seed in his field
[1:18:13] and you'll remember the revelation of
[1:18:16] this
[1:18:17] here in the parable the son of man
[1:18:21] was Jesus Christ
[1:18:23] verse 25 but while men slept his enemy
[1:18:28] came and sowed tears among the wheat is
[1:18:47] [Music]
[1:18:51] verse 26 but when the blade was sprung
[1:18:53] up and brought forth fruit then appeared
[1:18:56] the tears also
[1:19:00] so the servants from the householder
[1:19:02] came and said unto him sir did us not
[1:19:04] thou so good seed in thy field from
[1:19:06] whence then hath that tears
[1:19:14] he said an enemy has done this the
[1:19:17] servant said unto him without them that
[1:19:19] we go and gather them up
[1:19:26] while you gather up the tears you root
[1:19:30] up also the wheat with him
[1:19:35] let both grow together until the Harvest
[1:19:38] and in the time of harvest I will say to
[1:19:41] the Reapers gathering together for
[1:19:43] stairs bind them in bundles to burn them
[1:19:47] foreign
[1:19:54] but gather the wheat into my barn
[1:19:57] yes
[1:20:01] there are two seeds
[1:20:04] the children of God the children of
[1:20:07] satanas
[1:20:09] and both have a soul
[1:20:12] because that soul is the seed in them
[1:20:16] but not every seed is a son and daughter
[1:20:19] of God
[1:20:21] not every seed is
[1:20:26] as in the as in the third Epistle of
[1:20:31] John
[1:20:33] where John and his epistle he says
[1:20:38] was of that evil one a son of the
[1:20:42] serpenter so they're children of God As
[1:20:45] We Are Tonight
[1:20:47] but in this city there are many men and
[1:20:50] women
[1:20:51] who are children of satanic
[1:21:10] when you wonder how men and women can do
[1:21:13] such Wicked and horrible things
[1:21:18] it's because that's the seed there is
[1:21:22] the nature that they have of their
[1:21:26] father the devil Diablo okay
[1:21:29] Matthew 10 28.
[1:21:32] the scriptures tells us
[1:21:34] and fear not them which killed the body
[1:21:39] but are not able to kill the soul
[1:21:42] but rather fear him which is able to
[1:21:45] destroy both soul and body and in hell
[1:21:51] that reveals to us not every soul has
[1:21:56] eternal life
[1:21:58] many will be destroyed in a lake of fire
[1:22:04] the children of the wicked one
[1:22:07] the tears are deformed by the very
[1:22:11] nature of the Soul so foreign
[1:22:47] degeneration of vipers how can you
[1:22:51] escape the damnation of hell um
[1:22:58] so they will they will come to an end
[1:23:03] their nature
[1:23:07] will take them to the place
[1:23:10] of being eternally separated
[1:23:14] but the child of God the soul of a child
[1:23:17] of God
[1:23:19] will grow by entering into an invisible
[1:23:23] Union with the father
[1:23:26] called The born-again Experience
[1:23:40] man Jesus Christ where the father
[1:23:42] mentors
[1:23:44] May the Holy Spirit even tonight's
[1:23:47] disciple in you
[1:23:49] Jesus is tutoring you to live a life
[1:23:54] and he was here in a flesh and he
[1:23:58] mortified the Deeds of the flesh call us
[1:24:04] Born Again experience
[1:24:24] listen to Paul in Ephesians
[1:24:28] speaking on the born-again experience
[1:24:37] Ephesians chapter 2
[1:24:39] Paul speaking on that Born Again
[1:24:42] experience
[1:24:44] and you hathy quickened
[1:24:48] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[1:24:56] wherein time pass you walked according
[1:24:59] to the course of this world according to
[1:25:02] the prince of the power of the air the
[1:25:04] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:25:06] of disobedience
[1:25:16] among whom also we all had our
[1:25:18] conversation in times past in the lust
[1:25:21] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:25:24] the Flesh and of the mind can War by
[1:25:26] Nature the children of that wrath even
[1:25:29] as others
[1:25:39] by nature of the natural seed
[1:25:43] of our fathers and mothers Earthly
[1:25:46] fathers and mothers
[1:25:48] but laying within us
[1:25:56] that's really you okay that's the one
[1:25:59] that's part of God
[1:26:02] well
[1:26:06] verse
[1:26:08] verse 3 among whom also we all had our
[1:26:12] conversation and time passed in the lust
[1:26:14] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:26:17] the Flesh and of the mind and where by
[1:26:19] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:26:21] others
[1:26:31] who is rich in Mercy for his great love
[1:26:35] forwith he loved us
[1:26:37] because he looked down inside of you
[1:26:40] and you saw you were sweet
[1:26:48] like he said to Jeremiah the prophet
[1:26:53] I ordained you a prophet to the nation
[1:26:56] and before you were in your mother's
[1:26:59] womb
[1:27:00] I already knew you yes
[1:27:21] that's what makes you a son and daughter
[1:27:27] but not every seed
[1:27:30] is sweet is
[1:27:34] not every seed have God for their
[1:27:37] fathers
[1:27:38] some have Lucifer
[1:27:41] Lucifer for their father it's a Bible
[1:27:44] truth it can be followed from Genesis to
[1:27:47] Revelations
[1:27:57] even when we were dead in sins
[1:28:11] Grace you are born again
[1:28:20] now even
[1:28:22] satanas
[1:28:24] the soul allows the human being
[1:28:28] to be a free moral agent
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:34] that's why Lucifer could choose
[1:28:38] to get lifted up above God himself
[1:28:42] that's why Judas Iscariot
[1:28:46] could choose to sell Jesus for the 30s
[1:28:49] pieces of silver
[1:28:53] that's why job could say
[1:28:56] though you slay me yet will I trust you
[1:29:01] we all had a soul but they did not have
[1:29:05] the same father
[1:29:07] because the seed wasn't from the same
[1:29:09] father
[1:29:10] one is a seed of God
[1:29:13] one is
[1:29:16] the seed of the serpenters
[1:29:22] hmm so even Satan has a soul
[1:29:25] but not every soul
[1:29:28] will produce
[1:29:36] that's been formed in the image of God
[1:29:39] foreign
[1:30:15] when Lazarus died the Bible says Angels
[1:30:19] came down and picked them and took him
[1:30:22] into the arms of Abraham
[1:30:24] to The Fifth Dimension there are seven
[1:30:28] dimensions
[1:30:34] the fourth dimension is the dimension of
[1:30:37] a radio TV internet
[1:30:41] television all these all this this cyber
[1:30:45] waves traveling through the air is
[1:30:52] a place the Bible calls hell
[1:30:55] that was created for the devil
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:57] that's why when Jesus died
[1:32:00] his body laid in the grave
[1:32:03] for three days
[1:32:05] but the nature of God
[1:32:08] this very soon spirit of God rose up
[1:32:12] and the Bible tells the Apostle Paul
[1:32:16] tells us that he went to hell the 50
[1:32:19] mentions
[1:32:23] right on the cross it was laid in the
[1:32:26] Tomb
[1:32:28] the spirit of God raised up
[1:32:31] went to this fifth Dimensions Paul said
[1:32:34] he said to preach to souls that were in
[1:32:37] prison
[1:32:39] and to go to the other side of this
[1:32:42] Fifth Dimension
[1:32:44] and take all the old new Old Testament
[1:32:47] sayings
[1:32:49] and give them a born-again baptism of
[1:32:52] the Holy ghosts
[1:32:57] you raise up to a higher demand
[1:33:15] [Music]
[1:33:48] but they couldn't cross over
[1:33:52] they each had a body
[1:33:54] no longer an Earthly one
[1:33:57] the rich men now had a body
[1:34:02] that could suffer in flames of
[1:34:06] torments and not be consumed
[1:34:09] waiting for Judgment Day
[1:34:12] and Lazarus now had a body
[1:34:15] that was no longer in torment and hunger
[1:34:19] but living in Paradise with Abraham and
[1:34:24] all the saints
[1:34:26] it was two different kinds of bodies
[1:34:30] okay
[1:34:32] so principle number one
[1:34:35] let every seed produce of its own
[1:34:38] kindness
[1:34:39] principle number two
[1:34:41] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ it's the same
[1:34:44] yesterday
[1:34:47] in a series brother Brandon preached
[1:34:49] called Hebrews chapter 2.
[1:34:53] he said this it was outstanding
[1:34:58] he said now when Adam came into that
[1:35:01] body
[1:35:03] the body that God had made for him
[1:35:06] he had control of all the fishes and
[1:35:08] fowls and beasts of the fields
[1:35:12] and there was no man to till the soil
[1:35:16] because you remember he first made man
[1:35:19] in Genesis 1 26 and he made a spirit man
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:27] 126.
[1:35:29] and then God said there's no man to till
[1:35:32] the soil
[1:35:34] because uh because a flesh man doesn't
[1:35:38] have hands and feet and fingers
[1:35:42] so in Genesis 2
[1:35:45] he had made them male and female
[1:35:49] but there was no man to till the soil
[1:35:53] and God made Man Out of the Dust of the
[1:35:56] Earth
[1:35:57] is
[1:36:10] and it's made out of the same kind of
[1:36:12] material
[1:36:13] your body is just the same kind of
[1:36:16] material as a horse or a dog anything
[1:36:18] like that
[1:36:22] in other words it's made out of it's
[1:36:24] made out of the 16 elements from the
[1:36:26] earth
[1:36:29] calcium potash Cosmic light petroleum is
[1:36:34] so so All Flesh like that it's not the
[1:36:37] same flesh
[1:36:39] it's different flesh but it's made out
[1:36:43] of the Dust of the Earth where it comes
[1:36:44] from
[1:36:46] but the difference between an animal and
[1:36:49] a man
[1:36:50] God put a soul in a man
[1:36:52] and he didn't put it in the animals
[1:36:55] because the soul that was in the man
[1:36:59] is that the orphanage is
[1:37:05] because the soul that is in the man
[1:37:10] is that the office
[1:37:13] we develop you see we develop from a
[1:37:16] seed
[1:37:18] called the soul and we develop develop
[1:37:22] into the full stature called our
[1:37:24] theophysics
[1:37:27] just another word
[1:37:30] for a Celestial body
[1:37:32] the veil and the Darkness
[1:37:36] that the Apostle Paul spoke of
[1:37:40] keeps us from knowing it
[1:37:43] because you see we were born in
[1:37:45] spiritual Amnesia
[1:37:47] but the new birth awakens us
[1:37:50] and the Holy Ghost baptism places
[1:38:01] your spiritual adoption and God begins
[1:38:05] to restore to you
[1:38:08] control over this flesh body uh
[1:38:12] in measures in Medina little by little
[1:38:16] one step at a time
[1:38:18] God helps you overcome your struggles
[1:38:21] yes I do that uh that's what the
[1:38:24] refillings of the Holy Spirit are about
[1:38:28] it's the sovereign
[1:39:13] operio
[1:39:16] can you imagine what he felt like when
[1:39:19] he lost it
[1:39:22] we were born in that lost condition
[1:39:25] but now God's taking us back
[1:39:28] giving us dominion over this place
[1:39:31] oh Hallelujah Amazing Grace How Sweet
[1:39:36] the Sound save the rich life I once was
[1:39:41] lost because of loud I'm blind but now I
[1:39:45] see Adam
[1:39:47] from
[1:39:52] he had it from day one
[1:39:55] overcoming power
[1:39:57] and lost it we developed from a seed
[1:40:02] on the inner man called the soul
[1:40:05] and we develop into the full stature
[1:40:10] of a Celestial body just like Jesus
[1:40:16] one day we'll all live together in
[1:40:21] eternity and we'll have the same kind of
[1:40:24] body
[1:40:25] as our heavenly father
[1:40:28] it's the end goal it's where he was
[1:40:31] taking Adam and Eve
[1:40:34] you see Satan's Soul
[1:40:38] his nature was wicked and crooked
[1:40:43] from his beginning
[1:40:45] it was the same nature that was in the
[1:40:48] serpenter
[1:40:50] they're in Genesis 3.
[1:40:53] Lucifer entice
[1:40:57] he enticed to bring the fall of God's
[1:41:00] children
[1:41:04] the serpente God made it the serpent was
[1:41:09] a creation
[1:41:10] God's a Creator
[1:41:13] Lucifer was a creation
[1:41:16] God's the Creator he made them both like
[1:41:20] he made you an eye and in job 26 and
[1:41:24] verse 12.
[1:41:25] it tells us
[1:41:28] job 26 and verse 12.
[1:41:31] it says he divided the sea with his
[1:41:34] power
[1:41:36] and by his understanding he smiteth the
[1:41:38] proud
[1:41:45] by his Spirit he has garnished the
[1:41:47] heavens
[1:41:49] his hand hath formed the Crooked
[1:41:52] serpents
[1:41:56] job wasn't speaking about
[1:41:59] about every snake on planet Earth
[1:42:03] he is by his Spirit speaking of God he
[1:42:07] has garnished the heavens
[1:43:08] based on these two principles yes
[1:43:52] Ezekiel 18 and verse 1.
[1:43:56] the word of the Lord came unto me again
[1:43:58] saying
[1:44:01] what mean ye that you use this proverb
[1:44:04] concerning the land of Israel
[1:44:09] saying the fathers have eaten sour
[1:44:12] grapes and the children's teeth are set
[1:44:14] on edge
[1:44:19] as I live saith the Lord God you shall
[1:44:23] not have occasion anymore to use this
[1:44:26] proverb in Israel
[1:44:32] So what had been said hundreds of years
[1:44:34] before
[1:44:36] God was beginning to annoy things
[1:44:40] because he was moving from an old
[1:44:44] Covenant
[1:44:46] from an Old Testament
[1:44:49] to show us really who we are to bring us
[1:44:54] back into his presence
[1:45:01] as I live saith the Lord God you shall
[1:45:04] not have occasion anymore to use this
[1:45:11] behold All Souls are mine
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:58] the soul is not Eternal
[1:46:01] unless you're a Son of God unless you're
[1:46:04] a daughter
[1:46:06] can a soul be destroyed
[1:46:09] like a flesh
[1:46:11] yes see but only God can destroy the
[1:46:15] souls
[1:46:16] will our human Spirit be destroyed
[1:46:22] will our human Spirit
[1:46:26] also be destroyed
[1:46:28] yes because because
[1:46:32] yes it is because of this human spirit
[1:46:37] that we have
[1:46:39] the sinner's struggle
[1:46:44] and the soul and the spirit wrestle
[1:46:46] together
[1:46:49] that's the greatest battle we fight
[1:46:53] in our hearts and minds
[1:46:57] and the soul is born again
[1:47:03] since I gave my heart to Jesus
[1:47:06] seems like the battle is greater than
[1:47:09] ever
[1:47:10] it's because it's because God has
[1:47:13] quickened you
[1:47:15] before you didn't fight the battle
[1:47:17] the devil just put a string around your
[1:47:20] neck and took you where he was
[1:47:24] breathe
[1:47:25] the things you didn't want to do no more
[1:47:29] but now you've been born again
[1:47:32] and you're telling the devil no no I'm
[1:47:36] not going there no more I'm not watching
[1:47:38] those movies
[1:47:39] I'm not listening to that music anymore
[1:47:50] Hebrews
[1:47:52] and verse 12.
[1:47:55] the Apostle Paul a great prophet of God
[1:47:59] he said for the word of God is quick and
[1:48:02] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:48:06] sword
[1:48:12] piercing even to divide in asunder of
[1:48:15] soul and spiritu
[1:48:20] the human Spirit and the seed of God and
[1:48:24] of the joints and morals and is a
[1:48:26] discerner of the thoughts and intents
[1:48:32] Deuteronomy chapter five
[1:48:38] Moses says
[1:48:40] thou shall not bow down thyself unto
[1:48:43] them nor serve them
[1:48:44] for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God
[1:48:48] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[1:48:50] upon the children
[1:48:52] unto the third and fourth generation of
[1:48:55] them that hate me nothing
[1:49:06] he didn't say he would visit the
[1:49:09] iniquity of the fathers and of the
[1:49:11] children of all
[1:49:13] ah
[1:49:15] until their third and fourth generation
[1:49:18] only of those that hate him
[1:49:22] and those that hate him yeah it's a
[1:49:25] generation
[1:49:30] the children of Lucifer verse 10. and
[1:49:35] showing Mercy come to thousands of them
[1:49:37] that love me and keep my Commandments
[1:49:42] that's those that love him are the
[1:49:46] generation of Jesus Christ
[1:49:48] two different seeds a seed that loves
[1:49:51] him because that's their father
[1:49:55] hates him
[1:49:57] they have another father
[1:50:00] but was Israel under the law the
[1:50:03] generation of Jesus Christ
[1:50:10] hmm
[1:50:11] did you know that that Israel under the
[1:50:15] law
[1:50:18] the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:50:23] even in the old
[1:50:25] testamento it's in the Bible
[1:50:30] and God's teaching us how to read the
[1:50:32] Bible differently
[1:50:36] we're not we're not reading it no more
[1:50:40] to be able to say
[1:50:43] uh
[1:50:44] I read three books of the Bible this
[1:50:46] morning
[1:50:48] before going to work how many did you
[1:50:50] read
[1:50:52] it doesn't matter how many I read how
[1:50:55] many he read
[1:50:57] if we read without Revelation but God
[1:51:00] wants to reveal his word to us
[1:51:04] Israel under the law
[1:51:07] there was
[1:51:08] those of them that were the generation
[1:51:10] of Jesus Christ
[1:51:14] Matthew chapter 1 and verse
[1:51:17] it says this the book
[1:51:21] of the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:51:26] son of David the son of Abraham
[1:51:31] Israel Israel
[1:51:33] to Jewish men
[1:51:37] but what made them the generation of
[1:51:40] Jesus Christ
[1:51:41] what made them the very Gene of God
[1:51:48] that they're Souls they were Sons and
[1:51:51] Daughters
[1:51:53] All Souls are mine saith the Lord
[1:51:57] and I'll judge them as individuals
[1:52:01] because some are mine
[1:52:03] and all that the father has given
[1:52:06] I'm not losing one of them
[1:52:09] but what if you're not the fathers
[1:52:13] then God said there's a lake of fire
[1:52:18] for the seed of the serpenter the
[1:52:22] children of satanas
[1:52:29] General
[1:52:36] in Matthew 13.
[1:52:39] 36 to 38.
[1:52:41] share it once again
[1:52:45] Matthew 13 36.
[1:52:48] then Jesus sent the multitude away and
[1:52:51] went into the house
[1:52:52] and his disciples came unto him saying
[1:52:55] declare unto us the parable of the tares
[1:52:58] of the field
[1:53:01] yes
[1:53:12] the field is the world the good seed are
[1:53:16] the children of the Kingdom
[1:53:19] but the tears are the children of the
[1:53:21] wicked ones
[1:53:24] clearer no place
[1:53:26] and yet the teachings of the seed of the
[1:53:30] surface from Genesis to Revelations
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:37] fight against it so hard
[1:53:43] no God wants everyone to be saved
[1:53:49] okay
[1:53:51] he does is he looking the Bible says
[1:53:56] that he gave his life on the curse of
[1:53:58] Calvary
[1:53:59] and whomsoever will come yeah
[1:54:06] but only his children will come
[1:54:08] surrender their lives
[1:54:10] to Jesus Christ
[1:54:13] you see he's given us the soul gives us
[1:54:16] free moral agencies
[1:54:20] it allows each and every one of us
[1:54:23] to choose between right and wrong yes
[1:54:27] good and bad hot or cold
[1:54:33] God gave you the right to choose because
[1:54:37] you have a soul
[1:54:40] you have that privilege
[1:54:42] but many because they're of a different
[1:54:46] seed
[1:54:47] they will only produce of their own the
[1:54:51] seed will only produce of its own
[1:54:53] kindness
[1:54:56] you cannot plant an apple seed
[1:55:01] and be angry
[1:55:03] when it comes up an orange tree
[1:55:07] when someone told you this is an apple
[1:55:09] seed brother Daniel is
[1:55:17] and if I treat it real nice
[1:55:20] maybe when it grows it'll give me
[1:55:24] oranges because I like orange is better
[1:55:27] than Apple
[1:55:28] it won't ever give me orange
[1:55:30] it won't ever give me what I what I
[1:55:33] foreign
[1:55:43] go act like God who will live like Jesus
[1:55:47] Christ but not a sin of the serpent you
[1:55:51] can never get him
[1:55:53] in the name of Jesus it's not in him but
[1:55:57] it is in you because you're a son and
[1:56:00] daughter
[1:56:04] where is it is it now living waiting
[1:56:08] somewhere
[1:56:10] even as the flesh body
[1:56:13] it begins as a as a super as a seed
[1:56:17] Supernatural
[1:56:19] remember a principle
[1:56:22] Jesus Christ yesterday today and foreign
[1:56:33] Genesis 1 11. and God said let the Earth
[1:56:37] bring forth grass the herb yielding seed
[1:56:40] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[1:56:43] his kind whose seed is in itself upon
[1:56:46] the Earth and it was so this was
[1:56:59] that was Botanical life
[1:57:01] verse 21 and God created great whales
[1:57:06] and every living creature that moves
[1:57:09] which the waters brought forth abundance
[1:57:13] after their kind
[1:57:17] and every winged foul after his kindness
[1:57:20] and God saw that it was good
[1:57:24] the trees produce after their income
[1:57:27] the whales the birds are they all
[1:57:29] produce after their own kinds
[1:57:33] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[1:57:35] verse 24 the living creatures after his
[1:57:38] kind cattle creeping thing and beast of
[1:57:41] the earth after his kind and it was
[1:57:49] and God made the Beast of the earth
[1:57:51] after his kind and the cattle after
[1:57:53] their kind and everything that creepeth
[1:57:55] upon the Earth after his kind and God
[1:57:58] saw that it was good
[1:58:06] and when a child is born and it's born a
[1:58:10] man it's born a male
[1:58:41] [Music]
[1:58:51] trying to destroy God's children
[1:58:55] but God's children won't be destroyed
[1:58:58] God's children live by revelations
[1:59:12] and there are two kinds
[1:59:15] one comes from the Tree of Life
[1:59:18] and one comes from the Tree of the
[1:59:21] knowledge of good and evil
[1:59:23] one is
[1:59:27] a generation
[1:59:29] one is a generation of Jesus Christ
[1:59:34] in the message called adoption
[1:59:37] I'd like to read this is the naval was
[1:59:41] wandered wandered about it if I'd pass
[1:59:43] by I'd see a little Cloud floating by a
[1:59:46] spirit and say there goes brother and
[1:59:48] sister Charlie and Nelly
[1:59:51] and that's brother and sister Spencer
[1:59:53] going there
[1:59:54] that always puzzled me if my eyes are in
[1:59:57] the grave decaying and rotting if my
[2:00:00] ears is not here to hear anymore and if
[2:00:03] my blood has all gone back and they've
[2:00:04] embalmed it and it's in the waters or in
[2:00:07] the ground
[2:00:08] and my mental faculties my brain cells
[2:00:11] are all gone and then how would I be any
[2:00:13] more than just a spirit floating around
[2:00:16] can that worried me
[2:00:18] how would I like to say hello brother
[2:00:21] Pat or glad to see you brother Neville
[2:00:23] well how I'd like to see it but I
[2:00:25] thought well if I don't have anything to
[2:00:27] see with
[2:00:28] candy mouth to speak with it's rotten in
[2:00:31] the dust how would I able to say hello
[2:00:33] brother Pat hello brother sister brother
[2:00:35] Neville or hello Charlie but now I know
[2:00:38] that's wrong
[2:00:39] for it's written in the scriptures which
[2:00:42] as I say it's not contrary for if this
[2:00:44] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[2:00:47] one already waiting another Tabernacle
[2:00:50] that has eyes ears lips faculties if
[2:00:54] this Earthly Tabernacle will be
[2:00:56] dissolved it has a body that can feel
[2:00:59] that can talk and now it comes to me
[2:01:01] just now that Moses had been dead in an
[2:01:04] unmarked grave for 800 years and Elijah
[2:01:07] had went to heaven 500 years before but
[2:01:10] on Mount Transfiguration they were both
[2:01:12] found talking with Jesus is
[2:01:39] Celestia
[2:02:40] it's a real body
[2:02:42] it resembles this this Earthly one
[2:02:47] only far better in this body is
[2:02:53] you'll
[2:02:55] see farther
[2:02:57] you'll speak nicer in this body
[2:03:03] better in this celestial bodies
[2:03:06] God said he's provided a kingdom a
[2:03:10] Heavenly Kingdom right
[2:03:15] he said he'll cleanse us
[2:03:32] the Bible says
[2:03:38] the seat of the serpents
[2:03:46] Ephesians 2 and verse 1.
[2:03:58] um
[2:03:59] and you hath he quickened
[2:04:02] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[2:04:08] that's a supernatural quickening
[2:04:14] The born-again Experience
[2:04:17] that's that's that's that soul that was
[2:04:20] Lane dormant
[2:04:22] that has been revived
[2:04:25] and you're not the same anymore you
[2:04:28] don't have the same desires
[2:04:31] for the things of this world
[2:04:33] you've been quickened when you were once
[2:04:36] dead in trespasses and sins
[2:04:40] you've been quickened now you'll never
[2:04:43] be the same you're walking in his
[2:04:46] presence
[2:04:47] we're in in times past he walked
[2:04:51] according to the course of this world
[2:04:53] according to the prince of the power of
[2:04:55] the air the spirit that now worketh and
[2:04:58] the children of Disobedience
[2:05:06] but that spirit's no longer working in
[2:05:09] you because you've been born again
[2:05:12] among whom also we had our conversation
[2:05:15] in times past in the lust of our flesh
[2:05:23] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[2:05:26] of the mind and where by Nature the
[2:05:28] children of Wrath even as others foreign
[2:05:53] and by Grace
[2:05:54] you are saved
[2:05:56] and had raised us up together
[2:06:00] and made us sit together in Heavenly
[2:06:02] places
[2:06:04] in Christ Jesus
[2:06:09] that in the ages to come he might show
[2:06:12] the exceeding Riches of his grace and
[2:06:14] his kindness towards us through Christ
[2:06:16] Jesus
[2:06:19] Jesus for by grace
[2:06:22] through faith and that not of yourself
[2:06:25] it is the gift of God
[2:06:35] we're baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:06:37] Christ
[2:06:39] God gave you a gift
[2:06:43] every believer every son and daughter
[2:06:49] it's about if I'm not mistaken
[2:06:52] it's about the size of a mustard cheese
[2:06:56] and it places
[2:07:02] another seat
[2:07:05] growing down in the soul
[2:07:07] because that's what the soul needed to
[2:07:10] grow that's what every son and daughter
[2:07:13] God needs to grow
[2:07:17] we didn't have it because faith is a
[2:07:20] revelation
[2:07:23] so when we were born again
[2:07:25] when we repented and give our lives to
[2:07:29] Jesus
[2:07:32] faith in our hearts it is the gift of
[2:07:36] God
[2:07:37] remember Peter in the day of Pentecost
[2:07:41] they rose up and said men and Brethren
[2:07:44] Hombres what can we do to be saved
[2:07:48] Peter said repentance
[2:07:57] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:01] people thought it was speaking in
[2:08:03] tongues
[2:08:07] but that gift of God that Peter spoke of
[2:08:10] it and Paul here identified is
[2:08:14] Faith placed within us
[2:08:19] because when faith is laying down in the
[2:08:21] soul
[2:08:23] and that Faith seed begins to grow yeah
[2:08:26] that's when you become
[2:08:29] planet Earth a manifested son and
[2:08:32] daughter of God
[2:08:34] and the world sees
[2:08:38] have changed
[2:08:42] and you can tell them not only have I
[2:08:45] changed
[2:08:49] I'm going on to be like Jesus
[2:08:53] verse 9 not of Works lest any man should
[2:08:56] boast
[2:08:58] for we are his workmanship
[2:09:02] in other words when you've been born
[2:09:04] again
[2:09:05] God is working on you now
[2:09:08] where is workmanship created in Christ
[2:09:12] Jesus unto good works
[2:09:16] which God be which which God hath before
[2:09:20] ordained that we should walk in them
[2:09:24] Paul was telling us
[2:09:27] in simple language
[2:09:29] this Earthly body is
[2:09:35] shaped in iniquity we come into this
[2:09:39] world speaking lives
[2:09:49] it is the supernatural seed of God
[2:09:53] it's the very Gene of Jesus Christ it's
[2:09:57] what makes you and I the generation of
[2:10:00] Jesus Christ
[2:10:02] that's why David and Abraham
[2:10:05] what made them the generations
[2:10:24] for in it begins as the very attribute
[2:10:28] of God
[2:10:31] that means you are in his thoughts
[2:10:35] long before you are manifested in this
[2:10:38] Earth
[2:10:39] You are in the thoughts of God
[2:10:41] then you were born into this world
[2:10:44] and God places the attributes
[2:10:48] the supernatural seeds
[2:10:52] his DNA
[2:10:55] instead in a flesh body but remember
[2:11:00] flesh and blood
[2:11:02] will not inherit the kingdom of God
[2:11:12] yes because
[2:11:23] and God's coming
[2:11:24] back
[2:11:30] your attribute that means you're in his
[2:11:33] thoughts
[2:11:37] then you're born into this world
[2:11:42] a supernatural
[2:11:48] and it remains dormant until the light
[2:11:52] of the pillar of fires
[2:11:54] and the reign of the Holy Spirit Waters
[2:11:57] it
[2:11:58] and then you are born
[2:12:01] and the son or daughter of God on the
[2:12:05] inside
[2:12:05] begins to grow
[2:12:14] okay
[2:12:16] I still have two and a half hours more
[2:12:19] but I'm going to cut it short
[2:12:23] I'm going to make a statement first the
[2:12:25] soul and the man
[2:12:28] is that the orphanage is
[2:12:32] but random said but the difference
[2:12:35] between an animal and a man
[2:12:38] God put a soul in a man and he didn't
[2:12:42] put that in the animals
[2:12:44] because the soul that was in the man
[2:12:48] is
[2:12:51] so when you're born again
[2:12:54] it's God giving his child control
[2:13:01] you don't have to yield to the to the to
[2:13:03] the things of the flesh no more
[2:13:06] you now have the power to say no
[2:13:11] that doesn't please my Lord
[2:13:14] this seed this is
[2:13:19] and through the three steps
[2:13:26] the soul will development
[2:13:33] the control grows it's not total control
[2:13:41] for Adam came first
[2:13:45] and there was no evil
[2:13:48] carne
[2:13:58] Adam went through a body change
[2:14:05] Ken was in full control
[2:14:08] only for a season
[2:14:13] we are born
[2:14:16] out of control
[2:14:18] but through a born-again experience
[2:14:21] God starts taking us
[2:14:23] from this body of Flesh to a Celestial
[2:14:27] body
[2:14:28] and every step we take towards
[2:14:32] he gives us more control
[2:15:02] like that
[2:15:04] Jesus
[2:15:06] Jesus was never a problem child
[2:15:09] problematico because the seed had
[2:15:12] nothing to do with Mary or Joseph
[2:15:15] the seed that birth Jesus
[2:15:18] was the spoken word
[2:15:21] so in that body
[2:15:24] was no evil
[2:15:27] because that body is
[2:15:33] [Music]
[2:15:37] wrinkles because he was going to ask the
[2:15:40] father
[2:15:41] to take your place
[2:15:45] and become your sins
[2:15:51] could be his righteousness
[2:16:04] Jesus came through Immaculate Birth
[2:16:07] by the spoken word the original
[2:16:13] the Child Jesus Jesus I've said it
[2:16:15] before
[2:16:18] was not connected to Mary Maria
[2:16:25] because
[2:16:27] then the Blood of Mary
[2:16:31] and the Blood of Mary natural
[2:16:36] would have contaminated the body of
[2:16:38] Christ
[2:16:39] with sinful mankind
[2:16:45] pecadora
[2:16:47] and I've been asked
[2:16:48] then how in the world could the body
[2:16:51] have grown in marriage
[2:16:53] and my answer has always been
[2:16:56] I'll tell you how it got there yes and
[2:17:00] you tell me how it lived
[2:17:04] it got there through the spoken words
[2:17:10] [Music]
[2:17:21] and how did it live
[2:17:24] if it wasn't connected to Mary Maria
[2:17:28] by the spoken word
[2:17:32] it was an original series
[2:17:35] like Adam
[2:17:37] and Adam grew yeah and was a man and was
[2:17:42] never connected
[2:17:45] my first Adam too was a spoken word
[2:17:49] um
[2:17:54] but the first Adam
[2:17:57] the second Adam didn't fail no for you
[2:18:11] there has nothing to do with a man
[2:18:15] it's a personal experience between you
[2:18:19] and trusted and Jesus Christ
[2:18:22] he had an Immaculate birth
[2:18:25] so he could give you one
[2:18:29] he had an Immaculate birth and lived in
[2:18:31] a flesh body is
[2:18:38] a supernatural Born Again
[2:18:45] of Jesus Christ
[2:18:49] foreign
[2:18:54] Matthew 1 23.
[2:18:57] just behold the Virgin shall be with
[2:18:59] child and shall bring forth a son
[2:19:03] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[2:19:05] which being interpreted is God With Us
[2:19:09] this is Jesus Christ foreign
[2:19:29] but go to my brethren and say unto them
[2:19:32] I Ascend unto my father and to your
[2:19:34] father and to my God and your God Jesus
[2:19:49] now do you see what you had to be born
[2:19:52] again
[2:19:54] and if you haven't now do you see why
[2:19:57] you must be born again
[2:20:06] as Paul said
[2:20:08] we lived in sin
[2:20:11] but the soul in you that laid dormant
[2:20:15] was quickened by the Holy Ghost
[2:20:19] that's when you became a new Creator
[2:20:26] the soul is the seed
[2:20:29] then what will the seed produce
[2:20:34] a body
