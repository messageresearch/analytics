[1:02:23] prayer and um we also want to pray for a
[1:02:27] a young
[1:02:31] man uh I say young man he's probably in
[1:02:34] his early
[1:02:38] 40s and his name is is Isaiah
[1:02:43] Johnson Johnson some of you may know his
[1:02:48] brother uh Elijah Johnson El Elijah
[1:02:52] Johnson a brother there in uh press
[1:02:57] Arizona and this is his younger
[1:03:01] brother who could never quite get the
[1:03:07] victory I think as a young man he went
[1:03:10] to church a
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:15] bit but of course he came from a
[1:03:18] troubled
[1:03:23] family so so the mother and father never
[1:03:26] really did help him to find
[1:03:33] Christ a young man who wound up in
[1:03:35] prison for five
[1:03:40] years he has three
[1:03:43] children
[1:03:45] divorced and then
[1:03:47] married and then uh so so his is the
[1:03:51] story of almost every human being on
[1:03:53] planet
[1:03:57] Earth who hasn't surrendered their lives
[1:03:59] to Jesus
[1:04:04] Christ uh and what happens
[1:04:08] is they keep going deeper in
[1:04:13] sin they keep breaking relationship
[1:04:16] after
[1:04:20] relationship and and they keep doing the
[1:04:23] same thing over and over
[1:04:26] again and when you talk to them they'll
[1:04:29] they're hoping something will
[1:04:35] change but but nothing will
[1:04:38] change until until they change their
[1:04:42] ways until he changes the friends he
[1:04:45] hangs
[1:04:48] with until he changes the places he goes
[1:04:53] to
[1:04:54] instead of places of
[1:04:57] entertainment break the cycle of
[1:05:01] death and say I'll go to the house of
[1:05:05] God whether I feel like it or don't feel
[1:05:08] like
[1:05:09] it
[1:05:11] whether whether I feel like
[1:05:13] it I'll go to the house of God because
[1:05:17] I'm wanting to break the grip that death
[1:05:20] has on
[1:05:23] me
[1:05:27] I want to be broken
[1:05:30] loose from Satan's
[1:05:37] grip and that's the way we spoke to this
[1:05:40] young man
[1:05:43] Isaiah I text him this
[1:05:48] morning and uh a
[1:05:52] scripture and uh he's a heavy
[1:05:58] smoker but that's really the least of
[1:06:01] his
[1:06:03] problems that's the
[1:06:09] least because we realize that those are
[1:06:12] the attributes of his
[1:06:18] unbelief if he can ever break the
[1:06:22] cycle if he can ever let God pull him
[1:06:25] out pull him out of the claws of the
[1:06:31] devil then he'll be
[1:06:34] free and to do that all he has to do is
[1:06:39] believe of the overcoming power that God
[1:06:43] gave us on the cross of
[1:06:49] Calvary he he sent me a text
[1:06:53] back
[1:06:55] he said
[1:06:57] Dan he says I need
[1:07:01] prayer I told him this morning that we
[1:07:04] would be praying for
[1:07:07] him that the
[1:07:09] Saints many who have gone through like
[1:07:12] fiery
[1:07:17] trials many that have gone through fiery
[1:07:21] Tri
[1:07:22] trials
[1:07:26] and God has given them deliverance and
[1:07:31] hope these are the ones that'll be
[1:07:33] praying for you this morning
[1:07:37] told so we'd like to take a moment to
[1:07:39] stand to our
[1:07:42] feet and help me to keep a promise to
[1:07:45] this young
[1:07:48] man whose life and family is falling
[1:07:51] apart
[1:07:52] again
[1:07:55] he's fallen apart many
[1:07:58] times but now it's happening
[1:08:02] again and we want to pray for him this
[1:08:05] morning the Holy Spirit would reach out
[1:08:07] to that
[1:08:08] little part wherever he is he's
[1:08:11] living and Shake all the world out of
[1:08:16] him and set him
[1:08:19] free let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[1:08:23] you once again this
[1:08:26] morning Lord and by the prayer of your
[1:08:28] Saints this
[1:08:30] morning we send the
[1:08:34] enforcer we we
[1:08:36] send the
[1:08:39] enforcer the great Holy
[1:08:41] Spirit the great
[1:08:47] enforcer to lose him
[1:08:50] Lord that he might believe
[1:08:55] that he might
[1:08:57] believe that all things are
[1:09:01] possible and that everything that is
[1:09:03] going on in his
[1:09:06] life can be
[1:09:08] changed because to him that
[1:09:11] believeth of what Jesus did for them on
[1:09:13] the cross of
[1:09:16] Calvary all these things are
[1:09:19] possible we thank you now in Jesus name
[1:09:24] amen amen may be seated just for a
[1:09:30] moment of course I also want to welcome
[1:09:33] my friend Emanuel who's here with us
[1:09:36] this
[1:09:39] morning

[1:10:03] you a great
[1:10:05] future in
[1:10:07] Christ um we
[1:10:10] also will be uh also the remember the
[1:10:13] the Hernandez family brother
[1:10:18] iseland brother brother is mentioned
[1:10:21] they were all going to be in San Diego
[1:10:23] this weekend told
[1:10:26] me remember traveling mercies for them
[1:10:31] also and last of
[1:10:36] all uh I leave tonight about
[1:10:41] midnight and uh take a take a
[1:10:44] flight as you know we're heading to
[1:10:47] Congo
[1:10:51] Africa there for a dedication of a new
[1:10:57] church with our the pastor and friend
[1:11:00] our brother
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:06] rapael they're in brazaville Congo in
[1:11:10] bra Congo so we're looking forward to to
[1:11:14] arriving
[1:11:16] there we're not looking forward to the
[1:11:18] journey so
[1:11:22] much
[1:11:24] it's about 30 hours to from the time I
[1:11:26] leave here to the time we get
[1:11:31] there so I'll probably uh sleep in the
[1:11:34] plane and the airport more than
[1:11:41] once but we're certainly looking uh
[1:11:43] forward to God uh blessing God's people
[1:11:46] over
[1:11:51] there and whenever God sends you
[1:11:53] somewhere Satan always tries to upset
[1:11:56] what's going what's
[1:11:58] happening whenever God sends you
[1:12:04] somewhere Satan will always try to upset
[1:12:08] your
[1:12:14] journey and uh of course it's no
[1:12:17] different this time
[1:12:21] either uh was I think it was last week
[1:12:23] week or a week and a half or two ago
[1:12:25] that we were me and Karen going to
[1:12:27] breakfast and we got rear
[1:12:37] ended and the car hit us at about 40 mil
[1:12:41] an
[1:12:44] hour yeah so so that's where it
[1:12:49] began and then uh I was
[1:12:52] um
[1:12:54] um I was just the other morning looking
[1:12:57] at some
[1:13:02] emails in uh the the airlines Air France
[1:13:06] that we're traveling
[1:13:11] with uh told said that I needed to
[1:13:14] upload a
[1:13:21] certificate of uh of my yellow fever
[1:13:24] vaccine
[1:13:29] proof and and that was yesterday
[1:13:34] Saturday so then I start calling
[1:13:37] around and in different places that
[1:13:41] Walgreen says that they give
[1:13:43] [Music]
[1:13:45] them so I go down there and they said
[1:13:49] you need a prescription from your doctor
[1:13:51] to get
[1:13:52] this
[1:13:56] and I said it's Saturday my doctor is
[1:13:58] it's
[1:14:00] closed so I called their I called the
[1:14:03] office
[1:14:07] nonetheless and their answering service
[1:14:13] answered and I talked to to to the lady
[1:14:17] there that takes
[1:14:21] messages she says there
[1:14:23] this is I can call one of the doctors
[1:14:26] that's on standby for
[1:14:32] emergencies and she called back and said
[1:14:34] well the doctor says he will not write
[1:14:36] you a
[1:14:41] prescription for this vaccine you must
[1:14:43] come in in
[1:14:48] person I I and she says and that will
[1:14:51] have to be no l that would have have to
[1:14:53] be on Monday or later in the
[1:14:58] week I said no that can't be on
[1:15:02] Monday I I leave midnight
[1:15:08] Sunday and they said we're very sorry
[1:15:10] and they hung
[1:15:13] up by that time it was already about 1
[1:15:17] or two in the
[1:15:19] afternoon
[1:15:20] yesterday and uh so I talked to the
[1:15:24] pharmacist at
[1:15:27] Walgreens wens and they said no we
[1:15:30] there's nothing we can
[1:15:33] do but then she says there is an an
[1:15:35] emergency service here in
[1:15:40] Phoenix it's a private
[1:15:43] company and they might be able to get
[1:15:45] this done for you yet
[1:15:49] today so I called them up and and first
[1:15:53] they said no we don't have any
[1:15:55] appointments for
[1:15:58] today I said Lord
[1:16:02] Jesus I I told them well my situation
[1:16:07] is I leave to I'm supposed to leave
[1:16:10] tomorrow night for
[1:16:11] Congo
[1:16:14] Africa and without this yellow card
[1:16:18] vaccine
[1:16:22] certificate
[1:16:25] I said the most the furthest I'll get is
[1:16:26] France and then they won't fly me to
[1:16:33] Congo and the man says
[1:16:36] oh he says hold on a minute he puts me
[1:16:39] on
[1:16:43] hold and uh he run he called me
[1:16:48] back he said I found you an appointment
[1:16:51] in surprise at one of our
[1:16:55] clinics he says it's at
[1:16:58] 3:00 can you make it I said yes
[1:17:02] absolutely so by the grace of God we
[1:17:04] went down and it is a private
[1:17:08] company so it it was rather
[1:17:12] expensive but I am now the proud yellow
[1:17:16] yellow card
[1:17:22] holder yellow fever
[1:17:25] recipient so it seemed like every time
[1:17:28] we turned around something was
[1:17:31] happening Satan was trying to upset the
[1:17:34] journey just makes me to feel that this
[1:17:37] is ordained of God and there's going to
[1:17:39] be a blessing for the people down
[1:17:46] there so of course I said I'm going to
[1:17:48] finish the day nice and calm
[1:17:52] now
[1:17:54] I'll go get my
[1:17:55] haircut it was about
[1:17:58] 4:30 the I reached for the door at the
[1:18:01] barber shop and it's open I said praise
[1:18:03] the lord it's
[1:18:06] open and I walk in and the two Barbers
[1:18:09] are
[1:18:12] there and and I say how about a
[1:18:16] haircut the marber said no we shut 30
[1:18:19] minutes ago no more
[1:18:21] haircuts I said Lord Jes
[1:18:25] J so so I said I I said what if I pay
[1:18:28] you double the
[1:18:30] money no she's no we're closed we're
[1:18:33] closed not even double no I'm
[1:18:40] sorry so I'm going out the door and the
[1:18:43] barber says you know just around the
[1:18:48] corner there's one of those uh they call
[1:18:51] them Great Clips or something
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:55] yeah another barber shop says they might
[1:18:59] be
[1:18:59] open I went walking around the
[1:19:03] corner I grabbed the door it's still
[1:19:06] open but in my mind I'm thinking that
[1:19:08] doesn't mean anything anymore in America
[1:19:11] so the door is open but it's really
[1:19:14] closed and I walk in and and I said um
[1:19:18] can I have a
[1:19:21] haircut the lady says sure sure sure
[1:19:23] just put your name right here
[1:19:25] and so that's the way it's
[1:19:28] gone ever since we the brother invited
[1:19:33] us and we
[1:19:35] accepted and every step of the
[1:19:38] way has been an upward
[1:19:41] climb just little things taking
[1:19:45] place and uh last night due to the the
[1:19:50] the rear end accident we had
[1:19:56] oh my back and my
[1:19:58] neck wouldn't let me
[1:20:00] sleep and so I got up and I slept in a
[1:20:03] chair in the living
[1:20:07] room and the pain was was a lot of
[1:20:13] pain but by this
[1:20:15] morning God had touched
[1:20:17] me the pain had gone way
[1:20:21] down
[1:20:23] not not that great pain would have
[1:20:25] stopped
[1:20:29] me but uh it would have made the trip
[1:20:33] more
[1:20:35] difficult so with all the so with all
[1:20:38] the difficulties that have
[1:20:41] come and it seemed like every time a
[1:20:43] door was kind of getting
[1:20:47] shut then God the way
[1:20:51] maker
[1:20:53] continued making a
[1:20:56] way and it may sound very
[1:21:00] simple but but it was very important to
[1:21:03] me and to confirm that we're to go there
[1:21:07] and be a blessing to the people in
[1:21:11] con this morning as we stand to our
[1:21:17] feet we'd like to speak on on
[1:21:21] perfection
[1:21:24] and if you'll turn with
[1:21:26] me starting in Genesis
[1:21:34] 17 Genesis 17 and beginning at verse
[1:21:46] one Genesis
[1:21:51] 17 and verse
[1:21:53] one and when Abraham was 90 years old
[1:21:57] and nine the Lord appeared unto Abraham
[1:22:01] and said unto him I am the almighty God
[1:22:05] walk before me and be thou
[1:22:20] perfect and I will make my C between me
[1:22:23] and thee and will multiply thee
[1:22:32] exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face
[1:22:35] and God talked with him
[1:22:44] saying and as for me behold my Covenant
[1:22:48] is with thee and thou shalt be a father
[1:22:51] of many nations
[1:22:58] in verse one it says Abraham was 99
[1:23:02] years
[1:23:07] old and and almighty God walked before
[1:23:10] him and told him at 99 years
[1:23:17] old and he said
[1:23:20] be thou perfect
[1:23:24] could you be too
[1:23:26] old could it could you be too old would
[1:23:31] you for God to call you into
[1:23:36] Perfection he called Abraham at 99 years
[1:23:42] old he said
[1:23:45] Abraham walk before
[1:23:48] me and be thou
[1:23:51] perfect
[1:23:53] turn with me to the book of
[1:23:57] Samuel Samuel chapter
[1:24:04] 1 1
[1:24:15] Samuel Samuel chapter 1 is a is a story
[1:24:20] of a of a
[1:24:21] woman
[1:24:23] and
[1:24:28] and and she's a woman with no
[1:24:33] children her name was
[1:24:37] Hannah and she was the Beloved of of her
[1:24:42] husband but she had no
[1:24:44] son she was
[1:24:46] Barren and she prayed before God when
[1:24:49] they went one time to to to the
[1:24:56] temple on a feast day of a Passover
[1:25:01] time and there she prayed at the altar
[1:25:04] before the
[1:25:08] Lord and and and asked of God to give
[1:25:11] her a
[1:25:14] son in verse
[1:25:16] 13 it says now Hannah she spake in her
[1:25:20] heart only her lips moved
[1:25:23] but her voice was not heard therefore
[1:25:25] Eli thought she had been
[1:25:37] drunken if she was speaking from a
[1:25:39] perfect
[1:25:41] heart she didn't have to scream it out
[1:25:44] for all to
[1:25:46] hear didn't have to make a big scene of
[1:25:50] it because God knew her heart the desire
[1:25:53] of her
[1:25:57] heart but Eli the
[1:26:02] priest uh he didn't know her
[1:26:05] heart he judged her according to the way
[1:26:08] she
[1:26:11] looked maybe the way she was
[1:26:15] dressed he could tell she maybe wasn't a
[1:26:18] very rich
[1:26:21] person so he assumed right
[1:26:26] away that she was
[1:26:29] drunken that's what that's what all the
[1:26:31] poor people come do here during the
[1:26:33] celebration
[1:26:38] time so not knowing this woman's
[1:26:42] heart he misjudged her in verse
[1:26:47] 15 and Hanah answered and said no my
[1:26:49] Lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit
[1:26:59] it was a good place to
[1:27:01] start for even Jesus would Le would
[1:27:04] later
[1:27:06] say blessed are the poor in
[1:27:11] spirit you see how that right attitude
[1:27:14] hasn't changed in thousands of years and
[1:27:16] God sees the
[1:27:21] heart
[1:27:26] and she and she said I have drunk
[1:27:28] neither wine nor strong
[1:27:34] drink but have poured out my soul before
[1:27:37] the
[1:27:39] Lord that's all it
[1:27:42] takes for a petition that we have in our
[1:27:46] hearts for something we want to
[1:27:50] overcome oh if I could save come sober
[1:27:53] before the
[1:27:57] Lord and place your petitions before
[1:28:02] him and God will
[1:28:04] hear the Cry of your
[1:28:07] heart then in verse 16 count count not
[1:28:10] thy handmade for a daughter of
[1:28:12] B verse
[1:28:16] 16 for out of the abundance of my
[1:28:19] complaint and grief have I spoken here
[1:28:21] this
[1:28:29] too then Eli answered and said go in
[1:28:32] peace and the god of
[1:28:39] Israel The Story Goes
[1:28:42] On and and and God gives Hannah a
[1:28:46] child but not just any
[1:28:50] child a prophet
[1:28:52] and a great prophet in Israel this boy
[1:28:54] was to be and she had made a promise
[1:28:57] that when she had weaned
[1:29:02] him a after after after he was old
[1:29:07] enough he may have only been a a boy of
[1:29:10] five years
[1:29:12] old but she told God that she would give
[1:29:14] the boy that he had given
[1:29:20] her and return it back to
[1:29:23] God that he might serve him all the days
[1:29:25] of his
[1:29:28] life and Samuel was taken back to the
[1:29:33] temple put into the hands of Eli the
[1:29:38] priest that he
[1:29:41] too might come to like
[1:29:45] Abraham to be made
[1:29:47] perfect so we can't be too
[1:29:50] young like Samuel
[1:29:53] and we can't be too old like
[1:29:56] Abraham that the promise of
[1:29:59] perfection it's for you and me
[1:30:03] also we're a lot older than Sam than
[1:30:07] Samuel but most of us are a lot younger
[1:30:10] than
[1:30:14] Abraham so God has a purpose for
[1:30:17] us he's got a plan and he's calling us
[1:30:22] to be made perfect let's pray Heavenly
[1:30:26] Father we thank you this
[1:30:29] morning ask your blessings upon your
[1:30:33] people in Jesus name amen amen you may
[1:30:37] be
[1:30:39] seated when you look up the word
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:43] perfect you'll find it from Genesis to
[1:30:48] Revelations it's almost in every book in
[1:30:51] the Bible
[1:30:54] in Psalms
[1:30:56] 37 and verse
[1:30:59] 37 the psalmist says
[1:31:03] this Mark the perfect man and behold the
[1:31:07] upright for the end of that man is
[1:31:20] peace
[1:31:22] so the word
[1:31:25] Perfection is found throughout the
[1:31:29] Bible from Old Testament to New
[1:31:34] Testament throughout the Book of
[1:31:38] Job job mentions Perfection over and
[1:31:41] over
[1:31:44] again and it's a promise of
[1:31:46] God Jesus said in Matthew
[1:31:50] 5:48 be ye therefore
[1:31:54] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:31:57] heaven is
[1:31:59] perfect so not only does he call us to
[1:32:03] Perfection but he gives us an example of
[1:32:06] whom we're to be
[1:32:10] like be ye therefore
[1:32:13] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:32:16] heaven is
[1:32:18] perfect perfect as almighty god is
[1:32:21] perfect
[1:32:24] now the struggle for
[1:32:28] Perfection is that we try to interpret
[1:32:31] the
[1:32:32] word maybe using a
[1:32:36] dictionary or our human
[1:32:40] reasoning I've shared it
[1:32:43] before speaking with a
[1:32:45] man he was a pastor or or one of the
[1:32:49] pastors they have
[1:32:50] several of the big denomination in town
[1:32:53] called the
[1:32:56] CCV a big mega church here in
[1:32:59] Phoenix and we began speaking on the
[1:33:02] word of
[1:33:03] God and I I began speaking to him about
[1:33:07] perfection and he immediately told me he
[1:33:11] says dan he says now you know better
[1:33:14] than that he said we can never be
[1:33:19] perfect his name was Bert
[1:33:23] I said brother
[1:33:25] Bert if God Jesus
[1:33:30] himself is the one that encourages to go
[1:33:33] to
[1:33:35] Perfection then surely he'll make a way
[1:33:38] to get
[1:33:40] there but I think the problem
[1:33:47] lays the the the problem lays in what we
[1:33:50] think Perfection is
[1:33:57] [Music]
[1:33:59] I said and
[1:34:01] Perfection it isn't being a better
[1:34:08] Carpenter it isn't being the most
[1:34:10] successful
[1:34:16] businessman it has nothing to
[1:34:19] do with anything we can with our
[1:34:25] hands but
[1:34:28] Perfection as god is
[1:34:31] perfect is eternal
[1:34:33] life that's the
[1:34:35] Perfection that's the only thing that's
[1:34:39] perfect is God who's
[1:34:42] Eternal and Jesus said
[1:34:46] strive
[1:34:49] to Jesus said to try
[1:34:52] to go
[1:34:55] forward to be as Eternal as the father
[1:34:58] is
[1:35:00] eternal and for a son and daughter of
[1:35:04] God if you're a seed of
[1:35:07] God that's already laying within
[1:35:11] you and what begins to unfold you un
[1:35:18] Perfection you say where do we start to
[1:35:20] go to per
[1:35:23] Perfection there is a
[1:35:25] beginning and every son and daughter of
[1:35:28] God has the same
[1:35:31] beginning and when you take this
[1:35:34] beginning you've begun going walking
[1:35:37] into
[1:35:39] Perfection now now now the devil can
[1:35:41] knock you off that
[1:35:46] path but all you have to
[1:35:49] do is get up
[1:35:53] knock off the
[1:35:54] dust and keep walking
[1:35:57] toward how do you
[1:36:00] start
[1:36:02] repent and be
[1:36:04] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:07] Christ and you've begun your
[1:36:10] journey onto
[1:36:13] Perfection The Book of
[1:36:16] Luke Luke 8 and verse
[1:36:20] 14 as we said you go through the
[1:36:28] Bible and you find that it speaks of
[1:36:32] perfection from Genesis to
[1:36:36] Revelations it's not just one scripture
[1:36:38] in the
[1:36:39] Bible it's not just one one scribe in
[1:36:43] the
[1:36:44] Bible but but it's the entire
[1:36:48] Bible and all men of on all the men of
[1:36:50] God spoke to of
[1:36:54] it and Jesus brought a a teaching on
[1:36:59] it and taught us the steps to arrive
[1:37:05] there in Luke 8
[1:37:09] verse4 and that which fell amongst
[1:37:11] Thorns are they which when they had
[1:37:14] heard go forth and are choked with cares
[1:37:17] and riches and pleasures of life and
[1:37:20] bring no fruit to
[1:37:33] Perfection but those who fell in good
[1:37:40] ground they bring fruit to
[1:37:45] Perfection they bring fruit to
[1:37:48] Perfection St Luke chapter 13
[1:37:53] starting at verse
[1:37:56] 32 he said and he said unto them go ye
[1:37:59] and tell that fox this is Jesus speaking
[1:38:02] behold I cast out devils and I do cures
[1:38:06] today and tomorrow and the third day I
[1:38:10] shall be
[1:38:13] perfected St Luke
[1:38:20] 13:32
[1:38:33] because the third
[1:38:34] day that man
[1:38:36] Jesus that had a body of
[1:38:41] Flesh that could that that could taste
[1:38:45] death and he
[1:38:47] did that body died on the cross of
[1:38:50] calvary
[1:38:53] that body was placed in a tomb of Joseph
[1:39:05] arthia and it laid there for almost
[1:39:07] three
[1:39:09] days but the third day was
[1:39:14] perfected and that body rose
[1:39:17] up and it was never the same body again
[1:39:20] that went
[1:39:22] down it was a glorified body it was
[1:39:26] eternal it was
[1:39:28] quickened it could move from Dimension
[1:39:31] to
[1:39:33] Dimension it could pass through that
[1:39:36] wall and find you on the other
[1:39:39] side and take you by the hand and say
[1:39:42] follow
[1:39:44] me and I'll take you where I'm
[1:39:48] going that's what God wants to do today
[1:39:52] he wants you to hear his
[1:39:54] voice and know that he's a resurrected
[1:39:57] Lord
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:01] Jesus made
[1:40:04] perfect that he might be able to make
[1:40:06] you
[1:40:12] perfect in the message eight called
[1:40:17] Abraham Abraham brother brandham says
[1:40:20] this
[1:40:22] he says God condescending or God
[1:40:26] descending trying to draw near to his
[1:40:32] people so he can be loved and
[1:40:37] worshiped and in this leodan
[1:40:41] age we've turned him and put him on the
[1:40:45] outside he's trying he's knocking trying
[1:40:48] to get back
[1:40:49] in
[1:40:52] and you remember the scriptures in
[1:40:53] Revelations
[1:40:55] 3 he said as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:41:04] chasen he said
[1:41:07] repent that's God our
[1:41:10] father in the form of the Holy
[1:41:12] Ghost trying to get back into our lives
[1:41:15] to control
[1:41:18] us he said as I said last
[1:41:21] night that Capstone came
[1:41:24] down it's got to come there to
[1:41:29] Perfection and the church has got to be
[1:41:31] drawn into
[1:41:34] Perfection you say
[1:41:36] perfection that's what he said be ye
[1:41:40] perfect as my Father in Heaven is
[1:41:45] perfect let's take a little example here
[1:41:47] for a
[1:41:49] minute he says now now notice
[1:41:53] this he says as I was saying this
[1:41:57] morning if a grape vine has a grape life
[1:42:01] in
[1:42:05] it it will bring forth
[1:42:09] grapes what about this Holy
[1:42:13] Spirit what what about the vine of
[1:42:19] God if it's God's life in
[1:42:24] you it'll bring forth God in your
[1:42:29] life remember that principle Lane in the
[1:42:31] word of
[1:42:36] God let every seed produce of its own
[1:42:42] kind it's not can I make
[1:42:46] it it's not is it for
[1:42:49] me if the seed that's within you is the
[1:42:52] seed of
[1:42:54] God down laying in that
[1:42:56] [Applause]
[1:42:57] Soul then you will make
[1:43:00] it will you make a few mistakes along
[1:43:03] the
[1:43:06] way you might make a
[1:43:10] few but because you're a seed of
[1:43:13] God he'll lift you
[1:43:16] up because he's taking you unto
[1:43:19] perfection eternal life in the Book of
[1:43:23] James chapter
[1:43:27] 1 and we're verses 2 to
[1:43:30] 4 J James says
[1:43:33] this my brethren count it all joy when
[1:43:37] you fall into diverse
[1:43:43] Temptations
[1:43:49] santiag
[1:43:53] James had experienced
[1:43:57] this James had lived
[1:44:00] this so now he's sharing with you his
[1:44:06] testimony he said my brethren counted
[1:44:08] all joy when you fall into diverse
[1:44:16] Temptations why he says knowing this
[1:44:21] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:44:26] patience and remember
[1:44:29] faith is a gift of
[1:44:33] God by grace are you
[1:44:36] saved the Apostle Paul said through
[1:44:40] faith and that's the gift of
[1:44:43] God that God gives you when you're
[1:44:46] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:48] Christ that's the gift of the Holy
[1:44:52] Ghost Faith the size of a mustard
[1:44:56] seed is deposited down in that
[1:45:01] soul to help you
[1:45:04] grow and get to
[1:45:06] Perfection to eternal
[1:45:09] life then it says this in verse three
[1:45:12] again knowing this that the trying of
[1:45:15] your faith worketh
[1:45:19] patience
[1:45:22] but let patience have her perfect
[1:45:28] work that you may be perfect and entire
[1:45:32] wanting
[1:45:42] nothing
[1:45:44] Perfection God is
[1:45:48] perfecting in this journey
[1:45:52] every step you
[1:45:54] take he's bringing
[1:45:59] Temptations because he wants to increase
[1:46:01] your
[1:46:05] faith and through faith give you
[1:46:09] patience so in the next
[1:46:13] trial you'll know what the purpose
[1:46:17] was that my faith might grow
[1:46:22] that I could
[1:46:24] believe that I can do all
[1:46:27] things through Christ who
[1:46:31] strengthen in verse four it said but let
[1:46:33] patience have her perfect
[1:46:38] work that ye may be perfect and entire
[1:46:41] wanting
[1:46:46] nothing what is
[1:46:48] perfection it's gone
[1:46:52] through a born again
[1:46:56] Experience day after
[1:46:58] day and step after
[1:47:01] step he's taking you
[1:47:04] closer to eternal
[1:47:07] life Matthew
[1:47:10] 5:48 he said be ye therefore
[1:47:14] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:47:17] heaven is
[1:47:19] perfect
[1:47:20] not
[1:47:22] perfect like your Earthly
[1:47:25] father not perfect like your Earthly
[1:47:29] mother for we found many defects in
[1:47:34] them
[1:47:36] defectos and rightly
[1:47:39] so because even if they're Believers in
[1:47:44] Christ they they are on a journey like
[1:47:48] you going on to perfection
[1:47:52] and their daily lives are full of
[1:47:56] Temptations and maybe you see them fall
[1:47:58] short in those
[1:48:02] Temptations but they're in a
[1:48:04] journey going on to
[1:48:07] Perfection and the whole purpose of
[1:48:09] those
[1:48:12] trials is to increase our
[1:48:15] faith to give us patience to wait on
[1:48:19] God
[1:48:21] but Jesus said the Perfection he's
[1:48:24] talking
[1:48:26] about is like your heavenly
[1:48:29] father is perfect and the way he's
[1:48:34] perfect is he's an eternal
[1:48:39] being which makes you an eternal
[1:48:44] being and God's taking you
[1:48:48] back from this Fallen persons that we
[1:48:55] are he's walking us back to eternal
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:01] life until until that life in US is so
[1:49:08] great until that life in
[1:49:11] US is so great that this Earthly body
[1:49:15] can hold us no
[1:49:19] more
[1:49:20] Matthew
[1:49:22] 19 and verse
[1:49:26] 16 it says here Jesus
[1:49:31] speaking and and behold one came and
[1:49:34] said unto him good Master what good
[1:49:36] thing shall I do that I may have a
[1:49:40] perfect
[1:49:49] life
[1:49:51] and behold one came and said him to good
[1:49:53] Master what good thing shall I do that I
[1:49:55] may have eternal life a perfect life
[1:49:58] like the
[1:50:01] father in verse 17 and he said unto him
[1:50:06] number one he says why callest thou me
[1:50:13] good there is none good but one that is
[1:50:19] God but if thou will enter into life
[1:50:22] keep the
[1:50:26] Commandments and he speaking of eternal
[1:50:30] life he was speaking to him in in in in
[1:50:33] in in in in the in the office in the
[1:50:36] ministry that he was
[1:50:42] unfolding the lion of the tribe of
[1:50:46] Judah the Lamb of
[1:50:48] God he was God but he said why callest
[1:50:52] thou me
[1:50:55] good there is none good but
[1:51:00] one that is God he never told
[1:51:04] him I'm not God did you see
[1:51:08] that but it's a but but it's a quote
[1:51:11] that many will tell you no Jesus said he
[1:51:13] wasn't God no he didn't say
[1:51:18] that what he did say he says why callest
[1:51:23] thou me
[1:51:26] good then he says you know that there's
[1:51:29] none good but one and that is
[1:51:33] God he was wanting him to catch the
[1:51:37] Revelation are you calling me good
[1:51:40] because you realize who I really
[1:51:45] am then he tells
[1:51:47] him but if thou will enter into
[1:51:53] life keep the
[1:51:56] Commandments that was Jesus once
[1:52:00] again answering the
[1:52:03] question in a
[1:52:05] parable
[1:52:07] parabas he saith unto him Verse 18 unto
[1:52:11] him
[1:52:13] which verse
[1:52:16] 18 He saith unto him which
[1:52:21] no 18
[1:52:27] this Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder
[1:52:31] Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[1:52:33] shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear
[1:52:36] false
[1:52:43] witness honor thy father and thy mother
[1:52:46] and thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:52:48] thyself
[1:52:53] the young man saith unto him all these
[1:52:56] things have I kept from my youth up what
[1:52:59] lack I
[1:53:05] yet he thought he had put Jesus in a
[1:53:10] corner he said are you kidding me oh
[1:53:13] I've done that since I was a
[1:53:18] boy
[1:53:20] no
[1:53:22] problem done
[1:53:24] settled that's that's me that's that's
[1:53:27] what I
[1:53:29] do so he thought Jesus had already told
[1:53:32] him everything he needed to
[1:53:37] do and he thought he had fulfilled it
[1:53:41] all that's why he dared to
[1:53:44] challenge and say what what lack I
[1:53:48] yet
[1:53:51] because he thought Jesus had run out of
[1:53:53] things to ask of
[1:53:57] him then Jesus said unto
[1:54:01] him if thou will be
[1:54:11] perfect and it shocked
[1:54:14] him
[1:54:15] perfect well isn't that what I
[1:54:18] am if thou will be
[1:54:21] perfect go and sell that thou
[1:54:26] has and in his mind this young man is
[1:54:30] saying I've never read that in the Old
[1:54:33] Testament where's that in the
[1:54:38] Bible he said if if thou will be perfect
[1:54:41] go and sell that thou Hast and give it
[1:54:44] to the poor and thou shalt have treasure
[1:54:46] in heaven and come and follow me
[1:54:58] and the Bible goes on to
[1:55:01] say the young man was
[1:55:05] sad because the one thing he
[1:55:10] lacked is the is the one thing Jesus
[1:55:13] asked of
[1:55:17] him and he walked him out of the old Old
[1:55:21] Testament he walked him out of the old
[1:55:27] test and he walked him into a new
[1:55:31] testament and he spoke to can he gave
[1:55:34] him the spoken word The Original
[1:55:38] Seed because when Jesus said
[1:55:41] this it wasn't written anywhere in the
[1:55:44] Old
[1:55:48] Testament God was writing a new
[1:55:53] testament by by the spoken
[1:55:56] word it would get written
[1:56:00] later but if you could believe the
[1:56:02] spoken
[1:56:04] word then you would become an
[1:56:08] epistle read of all
[1:56:10] men displaying the spoken
[1:56:15] word the original
[1:56:18] scene just like the experience that Adam
[1:56:22] had in
[1:56:25] Eden he was walking by the spoken
[1:56:29] word for there was no written books
[1:56:36] yet all Adam had in the
[1:56:41] beginning was a
[1:56:44] relationship and a
[1:56:48] friendship with a
[1:56:50] father and that was
[1:56:54] enough what if you live in
[1:56:58] 2023 what if you live in
[1:57:02] 2023 and you don't know how to
[1:57:05] read how will you make
[1:57:08] it to eternal
[1:57:11] life all you need is what Adam
[1:57:15] had a
[1:57:18] relationship a personal
[1:57:21] experience a friendship restored with
[1:57:24] the
[1:57:27] father that's all you really
[1:57:30] need but by his
[1:57:32] grace he's given us a whole
[1:57:36] book to show us every little
[1:57:41] step unto
[1:57:43] Perfection remember in Matthew
[1:57:48] 5:48 Jesus Jesus said be ye therefore
[1:57:53] perfect even as my Father which is in
[1:57:58] heaven that was verse
[1:58:01] 48 and you know how I've shared with you
[1:58:05] often the reason Jesus said be ye
[1:58:08] therefore
[1:58:11] perfect in verse
[1:58:14] 48 because for 47
[1:58:18] verses
[1:58:20] prior an he was trying to show
[1:58:26] you the little
[1:58:29] steps that you can
[1:58:32] take and
[1:58:37] arrive and have a friendship
[1:58:41] restored with the F with the
[1:58:43] father and in your
[1:58:46] soul being filled with eternal life
[1:58:53] in Luke 6 and verse
[1:58:59] 40 Jesus said
[1:59:04] this Luke 6 and verse
[1:59:10] 40 the disciple is not above his
[1:59:17] master so if your master
[1:59:20] is is a master what he
[1:59:25] does then then he'll teach you his
[1:59:31] ways and you too will be a
[1:59:34] master so Jesus says here the disciple
[1:59:37] is not above his
[1:59:41] master but everyone that is perfect
[1:59:44] shall be as his
[1:59:48] master
[1:59:51] if you take it as a single
[1:59:57] sentence if you take it as as the only
[2:00:06] sentence then then then most people will
[2:00:09] say that's not
[2:00:14] possible we can't be like
[2:00:17] God it's because there's still still
[2:00:19] trying to define the word
[2:00:25] Perfection with a
[2:00:27] dictionary that men have
[2:00:32] written but God's
[2:00:36] definition lays in his
[2:00:38] word if there's a question a Bible
[2:00:45] question there's got to be a Bible
[2:00:48] answer
[2:00:51] and and if there's words that Jesus used
[2:00:56] specifically then the meaning for that
[2:00:59] word you won't find it in the
[2:01:03] dictionary that
[2:01:05] definition will not take you to
[2:01:07] understand the very Mind Of
[2:01:11] God no the definition for for these
[2:01:14] words lays right in the
[2:01:18] Bible
[2:01:20] like
[2:01:21] Perfection like
[2:01:23] foolish when we speak of the foolish
[2:01:28] virgin well the word
[2:01:30] foolish you go to a
[2:01:33] dictionary and the list gets longer and
[2:01:35] longer and longer of
[2:01:40] foolish and if you ask a
[2:01:44] friend what's
[2:01:46] foolish they'll give you a list of
[2:01:48] things
[2:01:50] that would be foolish to
[2:01:53] do and yet none of
[2:01:56] those Define the word
[2:02:02] foolish as is spoken in Matthew
[2:02:06] 25 of the 10
[2:02:08] virgins five were
[2:02:12] wise and five were
[2:02:15] foolish well if they were
[2:02:17] foolish
[2:02:20] maybe they didn't plan for their
[2:02:26] retirement so they could have a million
[2:02:28] dollars in the bank when they hit
[2:02:32] 65 it's foolish to think that that's
[2:02:34] what God
[2:02:39] meant but the word foolish in that
[2:02:43] Parable God himself gave the
[2:02:47] definition and he said the foolish were
[2:02:53] foolish because they
[2:02:56] failed to get
[2:02:59] oil in their
[2:03:02] lamps you you won't find Webster saying
[2:03:05] that in the
[2:03:07] dictionary though he was a Christian
[2:03:10] man you won't find the Collegiate
[2:03:13] dictionary saying that about
[2:03:17] foolish
[2:03:22] diar because the meaning of
[2:03:27] foolish that God gave it in that
[2:03:32] Parable was
[2:03:35] specific and that meaning you can only
[2:03:38] get by
[2:03:42] Revelation these five
[2:03:46] virgins which makes them believers
[2:03:50] were
[2:03:51] foolish because they failed to get the
[2:03:54] oil in their
[2:03:56] L the baptism of the Holy
[2:04:01] Ghost the final
[2:04:05] steps to break into
[2:04:09] eternity so this word
[2:04:13] Perfection it has a
[2:04:15] definition and to be perfect like the
[2:04:18] father is
[2:04:20] perfect is to be Eternal as he is
[2:04:25] eternal in s John
[2:04:28] 17 and verse
[2:04:32] 23 Jesus says
[2:04:35] this St John
[2:04:38] 17:23 i in them and thou in me that they
[2:04:42] may be made perfect in one and that the
[2:04:46] world may know that thou has sent me and
[2:04:49] has loved them as thou has loved
[2:05:05] me the word
[2:05:07] perfect found from
[2:05:10] Genesis through
[2:05:12] Revelations but when Jesus in the par in
[2:05:15] his ministry began to
[2:05:17] speak
[2:05:20] remember how he was
[2:05:22] speaking it was always in a
[2:05:26] parable so the word
[2:05:28] perfect was being
[2:05:32] used to hide a great
[2:05:36] truth to hide a great
[2:05:39] Revelation from the eyes of the wise and
[2:05:44] prudent from the eyes of the wise
[2:05:49] and
[2:05:50] prudent and reveal it unto
[2:05:54] babes not little children
[2:05:58] naturally but those who had been born
[2:06:02] again those get the
[2:06:05] Revelation for unless you're born
[2:06:09] again you cannot see this kingdom of
[2:06:13] God you cannot understand The Parables
[2:06:16] of
[2:06:17] Jesus take it all
[2:06:20] literally when really The Parables was a
[2:06:23] prophetic
[2:06:27] word no when
[2:06:30] really The
[2:06:32] Parables were a prophetic
[2:06:35] word it was
[2:06:38] prophecies some of them coming to pass
[2:06:41] as he was speaking
[2:06:43] it many of them challenging the Church
[2:06:46] of that day that denomination
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:53] many of them showing God's
[2:06:58] children the Journey Back to
[2:07:01] Eden a restored friendship with the
[2:07:09] father God rich in
[2:07:13] Mercy in 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:07:17] 2
[2:07:19] the Apostle
[2:07:20] Paul he said we speak wisdom among them
[2:07:24] which are
[2:07:29] perfect we speak wisdom among them which
[2:07:32] are perfect he
[2:07:39] said so in First Corinthians chapter 2
[2:07:43] beginning at verse
[2:07:46] 4 it says this and my speech and my
[2:07:49] preaching was not with enticing words of
[2:07:52] man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of
[2:07:55] the spirit and
[2:08:04] power that your faith should not stand
[2:08:07] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[2:08:14] God in other words he didn't want our
[2:08:17] faith
[2:08:19] to
[2:08:21] stand in the literal interpretations of
[2:08:27] men no it had to be a revelation this
[2:08:30] word of
[2:08:32] God verse six how be it we speak wisdom
[2:08:36] among them that are
[2:08:42] perfect yet not the wisdom of this
[2:08:47] world nor of the princes of this
[2:08:51] world that come to
[2:08:54] not but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[2:09:00] mystery in a
[2:09:03] parable in types and
[2:09:06] shadows even the hidden
[2:09:11] wisdom in
[2:09:13] the which God ordained before the world
[2:09:16] unto our Glory
[2:09:22] which none of the princes of this world
[2:09:24] knew for had they known it they would
[2:09:26] not have crucified the Lord Of
[2:09:36] Glory in other words had they had a
[2:09:39] revelation no had they had a
[2:09:42] revelation they would never have done
[2:09:47] that
[2:09:49] verse
[2:09:50] 9 but as it is written I have not seen
[2:09:54] nor ear heard neither ha entered into
[2:09:57] the heart of man the things which God
[2:10:00] hath prepared for them that love
[2:10:11] him but God hath revealed unto us by his
[2:10:15] spirit for the spirit searches all
[2:10:17] things
[2:10:19] yay the Deep things of
[2:10:29] God the Deep
[2:10:32] things like how God wants to take
[2:10:37] you and unto Perfection to be
[2:10:41] perfect even as the father which is in
[2:10:45] heaven is perfect how is he
[2:10:49] perfect he's a Eternal
[2:10:54] being where where is he taking
[2:10:58] you unto Perfection unto eternal
[2:11:02] life it's the end goal of the
[2:11:06] father to have his children around him
[2:11:08] as table once
[2:11:11] again and never again be
[2:11:16] separated he won't go through another
[2:11:18] separation like he did in
[2:11:24] Eden he was
[2:11:26] determined when Adam
[2:11:29] fell that when no man was found
[2:11:35] worthy he said I'll be that
[2:11:39] man I'll be that man that takes my
[2:11:41] children back into
[2:11:46] Perfection I'll create a body of
[2:11:49] flesh I'll call that body the Son of
[2:11:55] God I will take and dwell in that body
[2:11:58] the father was dwelling in
[2:12:02] him the Bible says in him dwelt the
[2:12:05] fullness of the godhead
[2:12:11] deity it was God who descended
[2:12:15] down when he saw no man was
[2:12:20] worthy God the
[2:12:24] father as Revelations 5
[2:12:28] says with a book in his
[2:12:31] hand that was sealed with Seven
[2:12:34] Seals it was a
[2:12:37] plan it was a figure and a
[2:12:41] type it was really a plan that was in
[2:12:44] the mind of
[2:12:46] God and then God began to
[2:12:50] descend he came down as the angel of the
[2:12:55] Covenant looking for a worthy
[2:12:59] man knowing that he would have to become
[2:13:02] that
[2:13:05] man then from the angel of the
[2:13:08] Covenant the Bible says God came to his
[2:13:14] Temple that's a body that's the body of
[2:13:17] Jesus
[2:13:19] and God become
[2:13:22] man so that he could restore the
[2:13:24] friendship with
[2:13:27] you so he could teach you every step you
[2:13:30] needed to
[2:13:34] take to be as Eternal as he is
[2:13:38] eternal God
[2:13:42] descending and part of his
[2:13:45] plan would require
[2:13:49] an innocent
[2:13:52] sacrifice and the shedding of
[2:13:57] blood he was willing to pay that
[2:14:02] price so you could be
[2:14:05] perfect even as he is
[2:14:08] perfect as you know the Bible tells
[2:14:11] us there is no greater
[2:14:15] love but that a man should lay down his
[2:14:17] life life for
[2:14:20] another and the Lord Jesus laid his life
[2:14:24] down for
[2:14:26] all for he was the perfect
[2:14:30] lamb there was no spot there was no
[2:14:35] wrinkle in this
[2:14:38] lamb he was a man but a perfect
[2:14:44] one and he gave it all up
[2:14:48] so that you and
[2:14:50] I could be
[2:14:53] perfect even as Our
[2:14:55] Father which is in heaven is
[2:15:00] perfect in closing this
[2:15:06] morning perfect
[2:15:09] love castes out
[2:15:13] fear so as we are Marching onto
[2:15:16] perfection
[2:15:18] so as we are
[2:15:21] Marching as we are Marching onto
[2:15:25] Perfection God is
[2:15:28] perfecting his character in
[2:15:32] us he's perfecting the
[2:15:36] faith he's perfecting The
[2:15:39] Virtue he's perfecting patience in
[2:15:43] us he's perfecting brotherly kindness in
[2:15:46] US
[2:15:52] he's perfecting everything in
[2:15:54] US step by
[2:15:57] step and in 1 John
[2:16:02] 4:16 the Apostle John says
[2:16:07] this and we have known and believe that
[2:16:11] the love that God hath to us God is love
[2:16:15] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[2:16:17] God and God in
[2:16:20] him 1 John 4:1
[2:16:38] 16 herein is our love made
[2:16:44] perfect it's everything about him him
[2:16:47] that he wants to make perfect in
[2:16:52] you herein is our love made perfect that
[2:16:55] we may have boldness in the day of
[2:17:01] judgment because as he is so are we in
[2:17:04] this
[2:17:09] world we are living in a
[2:17:13] world that is charged with
[2:17:16] fear
[2:17:18] fear of
[2:17:21] sickness fear of
[2:17:27] loneliness fear of not having enough
[2:17:31] money fear that our children will be
[2:17:35] lost fear that our fathers and mothers
[2:17:38] will be
[2:17:41] lost we are living in a time and a
[2:17:45] day where if if you're listening to
[2:17:47] television and the
[2:17:51] news and if you
[2:17:53] are we forgive you for
[2:17:56] that but it all brings fear to our
[2:18:00] hearts we are being pounded with
[2:18:05] fear but listen what Jesus
[2:18:08] said in verse
[2:18:10] 18 there is no fear in
[2:18:14] love the love of
[2:18:16] God
[2:18:20] but perfect love casteth out
[2:18:24] fear because fear ha
[2:18:29] torment and he that feareth is not made
[2:18:32] perfect in
[2:18:37] love we love
[2:18:40] him because he first loved
[2:18:45] us and by the grace of God
[2:18:49] we'll love them to our last
[2:18:53] breath as we stand to our feet this
[2:18:57] [Music]
[2:19:00] morning
[2:19:02] Perfection comes through a restored
[2:19:08] friendship with the
[2:19:13] father Perfection is
[2:19:16] this as the father is
[2:19:19] perfect it's eternal
[2:19:24] life and that's where God wants to take
[2:19:26] us
[2:19:29] all where does it
[2:19:32] begin repent and be
[2:19:35] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:19:39] Christ and you're on a
[2:19:42] journey unto
[2:19:46] perfection maybe you've already been
[2:19:51] baptized but Satan has thrown you off
[2:19:54] the
[2:19:58] road and you might you might be
[2:20:01] asking now what do I
[2:20:04] do the step's even
[2:20:07] simpler you've already been
[2:20:10] baptized you just has to go back to Step
[2:20:16] One
[2:20:18] repent once
[2:20:20] again that's what made David the
[2:20:26] psalmist the king of
[2:20:29] Israel a man after God's Own
[2:20:33] Heart that every time he made a
[2:20:36] mistake and he and it was told
[2:20:40] him he
[2:20:42] repented and God
[2:20:44] said I like a man
[2:20:49] that when he makes a
[2:20:51] mistake and he's told you shouldn't have
[2:20:53] done
[2:20:56] that he drops to his
[2:21:00] knees he says Lord forgive
[2:21:06] me and maybe he has to go and tell
[2:21:10] others maybe he has to go to his wife
[2:21:12] and say forgive
[2:21:15] me maybe he's got to go to brother and
[2:21:17] say forgive
[2:21:20] me but God likes that kind of a
[2:21:26] man when he realizes I shouldn't have
[2:21:29] done
[2:21:31] that and he
[2:21:35] repents and he lays before
[2:21:40] God and he ask
[2:21:44] forgiveness of the
[2:21:46] father and of his
[2:21:49] wife and of her husband and of the
[2:21:53] dad and of the
[2:21:56] mom maybe you're a young person in the
[2:22:01] home and you know you crossed the line
[2:22:03] and said something you shouldn't have
[2:22:08] said if you're going on to
[2:22:11] Perfection
[2:22:13] repent make it
[2:22:15] right say sorry
[2:22:18] Mom sorry
[2:22:20] Dad but sometimes the mothers and
[2:22:24] fathers we realize we cross the
[2:22:28] line and we have to be ready to
[2:22:34] say sorry
[2:22:37] daughter sorry
[2:22:39] son because you know
[2:22:41] what we're all
[2:22:44] walking unto perfection
[2:22:48] God's restoring
[2:22:51] us with the love of God in our
[2:22:54] hearts be sensitive to his
[2:22:58] presence is what we long to
[2:23:04] be you love him this
[2:23:07] morning let's bow our
[2:23:09] heads Heavenly Father we thank you once
[2:23:15] again Lord we are in an ex
[2:23:19] exus we're moving from time into
[2:23:24] eternity we're moving from a terrestrial
[2:23:30] body to a Celestial
[2:23:34] one Lord and if this body be
[2:23:39] dissolved we have one
[2:23:42] already that's being
[2:23:44] prepared for the seed that will produce
[2:23:46] that
[2:23:49] body is the soul
[2:23:52] itself it's closer than we
[2:23:55] think it's growing to the stature of a
[2:23:58] perfect man
[2:24:03] already we'll only know it
[2:24:06] better when we've crossed
[2:24:09] over into
[2:24:11] eternity and we're in this new
[2:24:15] body and we realize it was with us all
[2:24:18] the
[2:24:20] time an eternal
[2:24:23] one made
[2:24:25] perfect by the blood of
[2:24:29] Jesus by the blood of
[2:24:32] Jesus so we thank you
[2:24:34] Lord in Jesus

[2:24:53] days we believing God will is going to
[2:24:56] be with
[2:24:58] us we look to see God's people blessed
[2:25:01] there in
[2:25:08] Congo and we certainly look forward to
[2:25:11] your prayers to help
[2:25:15] us
[2:25:21] God bless you all the Lord be with you
[2:25:43] [Music]
[2:25:45] again
[2:25:55] God bless you just want to share
[2:25:58] something and I just feel to share this
[2:26:00] right now
[2:26:04] um the first time I I come to uh hear
[2:26:08] the word of
[2:26:10] God I remember that
[2:26:14] uh in a little church on the south
[2:26:18] side and
[2:26:20] um I was listening to the word of
[2:26:24] God I never had had an experience with
[2:26:31] God but always remember it
[2:26:37] because I just remember that I believed
[2:26:41] what was being said I didn't understand
[2:26:43] at all but what I did understand I
[2:26:45] believed and I felt
[2:26:47] something God allowed me to come into
[2:26:49] His
[2:26:51] presence and
[2:26:53] um from that from that day
[2:26:58] on my life
[2:27:00] was uh had begun a
[2:27:04] change and it was it was because God had
[2:27:07] put a a faith in me to
[2:27:10] believe and
[2:27:12] something when I when I said that was
[2:27:15] truth my spirit in me bore witness that
[2:27:19] what what was being said was true and I
[2:27:22] just felt the presence of God come down
[2:27:23] in a in a way that excuse me that I had
[2:27:27] never experienced in my
[2:27:29] life and the reason I'm sharing this is
[2:27:32] because I believe that wherever we're at
[2:27:36] in our life in our stage with the
[2:27:40] Lord that same presence that same God is
[2:27:43] here with us right now and he he wants
[2:27:48] to continue that change in your life he
[2:27:51] wants to do something for
[2:27:54] you as the scripture said Jesus Christ
[2:27:56] is the same yesterday today and
[2:28:00] forever
[2:28:02] so um I wanted just to share that
[2:28:05] because I feel in my heart
[2:28:07] that that we need to Touch the Hem of
[2:28:10] His Garment as the scripture says and we
[2:28:13] can do that this morning just by faith
[2:28:16] it's just by accepting his word in our
[2:28:18] heart and knowing that he's God and
[2:28:21] there's nothing impossible with
[2:28:31] him we're sing that little song
[2:28:34] um touching
