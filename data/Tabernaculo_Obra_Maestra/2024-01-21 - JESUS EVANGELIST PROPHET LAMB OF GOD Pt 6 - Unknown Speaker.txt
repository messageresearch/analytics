ends of the world he he was with Moses and the children of Israel he he was with Adam and Eve in the beginning he was with the prophets throughout the ages he was with the high priest of Israel in order for them to be able to enter behind the curtain into the holies of holies but one mistake it was death for them to enter they entered with great with great respect they entered with great fear they had to be dressed a certain way they they they had Bells On The Fringe of their garment bells and as they walked those bells had to make a certain sound one mistake as they were entering in and they were really walking into their death one mistake they entered with indeed with fear and tremble but only the high priest and only once a year I'm sure the high priest didn't design desire it to be once a month the tension was too great the stress was terrible the fear of being struck dead was real they certainly didn't want that experience every day no no man could bear that pressure so once a year and he thought about it all year long when that day would come and he would prepare himself he knew he couldn't enter there with the wrong thoughts he knew he couldn't enter there if he hadn't been conducting his life correctly he knew any little thing was a Death March for him once a year to enter into that presence was all a man could take and amongst the millions of the tribe of Israel no one else could enter just him it was indeed and when he came out of that that the holies of holies you could you could see the man coming out pale white no pale white because of the stress of being in that presence and yet the day would come when when our high priest the Lord Jesus would rent The Veil and invite all the generation of Jesus Christ to come into His presence so he made us a promise I'll not only be with you as I've been with Israel but now I promise I'll be in you it won't be the experience that the high priest had no no it'll be a greater experience it'll bring an experience that brings you peace not Terror love not fear to enter into his presence he says I I ripped the veil and two that day on Calvary he did it naturally and the people were shocked they didn't realize that he didn't only do it naturally that what happened that day was just a symbol of something Supernatural that he had done that once again you and I can have a relationship with a father in our prayer closets where we can meet him daily we can talk to him we can share our burdens with him we can ask for his healing virtue there we can ask for the Salvation of our children there oh when he came everything changed Nothing Was the Same because a new book had been opened a new book it was the Lamb's Book and the Lamb's Book began with the lamb being born for the for the life story of almost every person for the life usually begins with someone telling of when that person was born and when that person person died and all that that person did in between the impact that they were that they had on their families on their friends on the people they work for so this Lamb's Book of Life actually set the pattern for how people write books of people's [Music] lives and and almost every book of a book of life of someone's life begins with their birth tells the things that they did in life the effects they had on every person they met and then their death and that ends The Book of Life of that person except for this person the lamb who had a book written of the Lamb's Book of Life and when he died the writers of the gospels they wrote of that death it was a sad day it was a day of confusion for them it was a day that shattered all their hopes where this when this Jesus of Nazareth died on the cross of calvary but this is the only book of a man's life that didn't end with his death because as he told us unlike all other men that have died on the third day he rose again to give us the victory to to to to to give us a welcoming call come unto me all ye that are heavy burdened I'll lift that burden I'll break that complex I'll take away that fear and give you courage for this is the Lamb's Book of Life he was born he he lived he died but then he rose again and he took death in hell he took the keys away from the from Satan and he's handed you the key now you hold the key of life of the Lamb's Book of Life as stand to our feet this morning and before we read the scripture I'd like to have a a special prayer for someone and uh my son-in-law reuben reuben uh his father brother Glenn tamlins Glen he's in a hospital here in in Phoenix Pho I believe the Banner Thunderbird Banner and the doctors have diagnosed him or at least they're pretty sure of it now of uh what they call I think it's pancreatic cancer perhaps uh pancre the pancreas cancer cancer the pancreas and of course uh he has a growth that's grown very large and they don't give him a a lot of um the doctors don't give him a lot of Hope their their hope is maybe a few months of Life they they told them if they do surgery to remove it immediately it's so large and it's so close to major arteries in the body that he probably wouldn't survive the surgery so uh he sent me a text and he his desire is that God would heal him he said my My Hope and he's a man my age a little older but his desire he said is Lord I Need a Miracle or I need your healing touch so he asked us if we would pray that way I said if that was his desire that's exactly how we would pray we know God has a time for all of us and when that time comes we shall go but we also know we have a promise his stripes we are healed and his desire at this moment he didn't say uh I'm ready to go I want to go that would have been fine uh but his desire was that God would give him a miracle or a healing touch to recover erate from this so we want to pray according to our brother's desire and ask with him for a miracle because truly he needs one and that's his desire so many times when someone would ask you to pray for them and and they request something like [Music] this sometimes we're sometimes we're too quick to say uh no you are if God's going to take you God's going to take you and you got to be happy with that too and we're we're quick we're quick to try and maybe balance their statement out which I'm as guilty as anyone but slowly I'm learning to listen here what the person's desire is and and and and ask myself is there anything wrong with what they're asking do I not do I need to try and balance their statement out and more and I realize that what he's asking there's absolutely nothing wrong with it I don't need to try and balance him out and let him know but but God may be wanting to take you I heard his request I it's a worthy request it's certainly something that's possible it's certainly something that God can do and he's asking for that so that's what we'll pray for as we bow our heads Heavenly Father we come before you this morning asking for his brother Glenn tamlins Lord and you we have heard the desire of his heart and you have heard it too and Lord we pray and unite our faith with our brother he's Desiring a few more years of life so in the name of Jesus Christ we ask you to grant our brother his desire in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's read in the Book of Matthew uh Matthew 1 and verse one we've been speaking on a on a subject Jesus evangelist Prophet Lamb of God this is uh part six and we'll begin in Matthew 1 and one the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham so this book of the generation of Jesus Christ just didn't begin when Jesus was born because th this book began way way at the beginning matter of fact it was way back in Eden it it was a book that had been written in the mind of God not in paper and ink it was it was a plan of God God being Sovereign knowing all things knew that Adam and Eve would make the wrong choice and yet he wanted them to be able to choose for themselves God has never never been a dictator so his ministers shouldn't be God has never been a dictator he's always given his children a choice and and he knew they would choose wrong and he knew he would have to come down on the scene to lift up his children and help them in their bad choices that's a deep Revelation for every father that is or is going to be verse two of Matthew 1 Abraham beg got Isaac Isaac begat Jacob Jacob begat Judas and his Brethren ABR is let's pray Heavenly Father we are reading this morning out of the Lamb's Book of Life and we ask Lord that you the Lamb of God the revealer of the word the author and revealer of this book that you would Open the Eyes of understanding uh of every person here give us all Revelation in Jesus name amen you may be seated Matthew 1 and one begins by highlighting the generation of Jesus Christ and but but the generation of Jesus Christ that came through Abraham in Matthew 1 it's going to highlight one particular tribe it's not speaking of all the tribes of Israel here though though in every tribe there are there are those Jews who are the generation of Jesus Christ but what it's going to highlight here in in the first chapter you can go back and study it at home but it's only speaking of One Tribe the tribe of Judah because this is the opening of the Lamb's Book of life this is the opening of the first seal this is the opening of part one of seven Parts called in the Bible Seven Seals this is part one of this unfolding of the Lamb's Book of Life the the the Old Testament spoke of it in in types and shadows in the prophecies but this is the book opening and unfolding right here no more prophecy it's becoming history because it's unfolding right here in Matthew 1 the only tribe that's high Ed or and and emphasized is is the tribe of Juda and it's and the reason it begins this way because now it's it's fulfilling all that the prophets had said of this great one that would come of this Prophet that Moses spoke of of this prophet Prophet that that that that that that that even uh even in in Genesis 48 let's turn to Genesis 48 and it was a prophecy of another Prophet Jacob Genesis [Music] 48 beginning vers verse verse eight excuse me Genesis 49 and verse 8 498 and it begins like this it was Jacob both blessing and and bringing curses to his own to his to his own [Music] children giving them warnings and giving them blessings both but this was all prophecy Jacob was prophesying over his children and when he gets to Judah his son he says Judah is a lion's welp a lion's welp uh uh Judah is allance well verse 9 Judah is a lion's welp 499 oh a lion's welp is the son of a lion so you can't be a little lion cub and and and your father be a giraffe this was prophecy so this Lion's WEP his father was the lion his father was the king and this is this is the heir to that King this is a prophecy of Christ himself he says from the prey my son Thou Art gone up in other words he been training this son from the time he first taught him how to hunt he's been training him up he said from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion now he now the prophecy is saying he's learning well from his father he's doing everything a lion should do the son of a lion read it again from the prey my son Thou Art gone up it was his training time it was the character building time he says this little lion this this this Lion's welp he stooped down just like the big lion taught him he couched as a lion and as an old lion he was learning the ways of his father this little lion who shall R him up is it prophecy will rise him up thus sayth the Lord will him the scepter shall not depart from Judah this new king coming up this this Lion's welp nor a lawgiver from between his feet saying in other words he is great than the law this this great king this Old Lion and the Bible says the scepter shall not depart from Judah the scepter has remained in the hands of God The Old Lion nor a lawgiver from between his feet telling us that throughout the Old Testament almighty god king with a scepter in his hand at that at his feet would he have a lawgiver a prophet Moses the scepter shall not depart from nor a lawgiver between his feet so God throughout the Old Testament King of Kings between his feet there would be a Moses there would be there would be the prophets they would remain the people living under this law until Shiloh come Shiloh was the Lion's welp Shiloh was the Lion's welp the Le it's a prophecy and unto him unto the lion of the tribe of Judah unto the Lamb of God unto him shall be the Gathering of the people when he comes the law will be no more between the feet of the king of kings that created heavens and earth now his son stands in that place where the law once was now grace and mercy is being being delivered to the people it was a prophecy verse 11 binding his fo unto the vine and his asses and his asses cult unto the choice Vine it was talking of Jesus At The Cross of calvary both both a f a fo in verse 11 a fo and a cult is a young animal it's a yearling as they call it it's a lamb which is only Lambs are only a year to two years old it's a young animal like maybe 33 and a half years old that he would be bound to a cross the Bible says and he washed his garments in wine wine represents the blood or Revelation whyne here here he and he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes wine is the blood of grapes but it was a prophecy of Christ that God would take and and and and and bind him to the cross of calvary the Romans may have nailed the nails but the nails didn't hold him on the cross he stayed his own free will he made a choice for you and [Music] I they told him if thou be the Son of God come off of that cross as a man for a moment he thought I could come off this cross but then he began to think he said but what about Leo what about ISO what about Elmer what about orley what about Carmen and Kenny and Rachel what about Joseph no I cannot come off this cross I have the power to do it but I will use this power to stay on this cross and spill the blood of the grapes the very blood of God I will redeem I will save I will give my life a living sacrifice the nails didn't hold him there you held there his love for you held him on the cross and for you he rose the third day so now you see how you are part of this Lamb's Book of Life Matthew 1 highlighting the tribe of Judah because it was it was Bible prophecy coming to pass for Jesus was Lamb of God but first he was going to come and unfold the ministry as king of the Jews first he was going to offer this book of life this Lamb's Book of Life first he was going to offer it to Abraham's children the Jewish people so he would have to be a Kinsman he would have to be a Kinsman in order to redeem them in order to be part of them a human being and he came down fulfilling prophecy beginning in Genesis 49 and the many hundreds more Through the Bible of the Old Testament so we read in Matthew 1 and chapter 1 and Matthew 1 and chapter one this day all those hundreds of prophecies were coming to pass this day all that prophecy was becoming history even to the highlighting of the tribe of Judah it was prophecy he was to be the king of the Jews he was to be the lion of the tribe of of Judah he would fulfill the prophecy that Jacob is the father of Judah had spoken God rich in Mercy so chapter one goes all the way down the lineage of the tribe of Judah because the book The Lambs book is unfolding if you've been wondering where is the Lamb's Book of Life if you've been wondering what and if you've been wondering what is written in the B Lamb's Book of Life we're told our names are in that book not only are our names in the book but a character building process of Christ because the Lamb's Book of Life if you've been wondering where it's at at one time it sat on our shelves collecting dust and someone might ask you where's the Lamb's Book of Life you'd say I don't know but I believe it and all the time when you said it the book was in your home the book was on your shelf the book you used to carry it to church when you went it's been with you all the time but what we lacked was a revelation to pick up the book and meditate on it day and night so we could grow unto the stature so we too could be born like this lamb was born with a supernatural birth that that that that would overcome the natural birth and give us the victory over this flesh all of that and more is written in in this Lamb's Book of Life it's called the New Testament and this Lamb's Book of Life began talking about the lamb about his lineage about his father you see he was a lion's welp so that means his father was a lion his father was the great lion his father was the creator of heavens and earth he was the son and one day the father would pass his scepter to his son in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God God and the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us what happened the great lion father pass the scepter to the Lion's we Jesus Christ the son of God this new testament begins this is the Lamb's Book of Life it speaks of his genealogy because that genealogy was prophesied to be that it was through Judah that Shiloh would come Shiloh means to whom it belongeth the scepter in Matthew 1 and verse 18 in this book of the Lamb it tells us his genealogy then it tells us about how his birth was going to be this is how he'll be born this is to whom whom he will be born to he said now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise Verse 18 of Matthew 1 verse 18 when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost and yet a prophet told us that Mary was just the incubator that neither Mary or Joseph had anything to do with the seed that was created by the spoken word of God Mary did not contribute 23 chromosomes to Jesus Joseph did not contribute 23 chromosomes to Jesus neither one had anything to do a contributing anything to this little body that was this seed it was simply placed a complete total seed by the spoken word in the womb of Mary it had to be placed there because it was a prophecy all the way from Genesis in chapter 3 let's read that Genesis chapter 3 and verse 15 God almighty God the great lion the great Creator speaking to the serpent he say and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life he in verse 15 he says and I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed that's the serpent seed that's where the term the serpent seed is ever first heard or used you might say it doesn't say serpent seed he's speaking to the serpent and he says I'll put and I will put Amity between thee and the woman verse 15 and between thy seed and he's speaking to who the serpent so whose seed is this the seed of the serpent the serpent anointed of Satan had been successful in genetically modifying the human race and hybriding it and that's why I must be born again and that's why you must be born again and between and I will put Amity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel her seed the woman's seed was a prophecy for the woman naturally doesn't carry the seed so this was a prophecy this was the prophecy of Christ that would take place this was the prophecy but as we were reading in the Book of Matthew there in chapter one this was a fulfillment now the birth of Jesus Christ the woman's seed now the birth of the woman's seed was in this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together intimately sexually she was found with child of the Holy Ghost this was God's lamb this lamb had was without spot and without wrinkle because it wasn't connected by any means to any Fallen human being both Mary and Joseph they they had been born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to this world speaking lies just as every one of us the curse upon the human race was that we would all be born through a sexual birth that was introduced by The Serpent and his seed that gen that that that genetically modified every human being on the face of the Earth it's what separates us and wouldn't allow us to walk into the holies of holies because we're Fallen creatures but this Jesus Christ wasn't Joseph's biological son this Jesus Christ was not married biological son they were just a chosen vessel to carry this seed unto adulthood and the seed was placed in Mary and a prophet tells us Mary was just an incubator and I've shared my opinion before and it's still my just my opinion and some people find it offensive but I have said that I don't believe that this seed I believe that Mary was absolutely just an incubator that this seed was not connected to Mary in any way through an umbilical cord for then the Blood of Mary a fallen person would have flowed through this child and this had to be a lamb without spot or wrinkle I believe that would have put a wrinkle that that would have put a wrinkle on this Supernatural seed for God to be dependent on the human race to give this seed life and this lamb would no longer have been worthy the natural type you go read it in the Old Testament The Book of Leviticus once a year the high priest would have to sacrifice a lamb it was to be a sin offering for all the people once a year all of Israel and they would gather Lambs all together and the high priest and his sons they had to go and and and and and and check these Lambs out they they had to make sure there was no defects on them a lamb who had a ear that had been bitten off wouldn't qualify they couldn't have scratches they couldn't have Cuts they'd even lay them down and start looking through the wool make sure that under all that wool there wasn't an old cut an old and when they found a lamb without spot or wrinkle that would be the lamb that that they would offer up to the father to God it was just a prophetic word in a symbol of what God would do one day when a man would be God's lamb without spot without wrinkles he had to be a human being it had to be a man a Kinsman to redeem all of mankind but it couldn't have one spot or wrinkle on it and I Know It shakes people to say I don't believe that this seed required to be connected to Mary in any way to live to be born because what caused this seed to live and be born was thus saith the Lord and the Prophecies of the prophets she was just an incubator the Catholic teachings if you're familiar with them at all the Virgin Mary is one of the greatest Saints she is that the Catholic people pray to because she is in their doctrines she is the biological mother of Jesus Christ she is the mother of Jesus in every way shape and form a a Catholic um Adventure archaeologist AR uh who who over the years and I don't even know if the man is still alive and he spent most of his life in Israel uh looking for for for for for all the artifacts of the life of Jesus he made a video you could see it if you find it and in this video he said he got permission from the Jewish government to go and dig in some caves not already to go in some caves that were there already uh that were directly under Mount Calvary directly under where Jesus had been crucified so him and his group of helpers went down into these caves and I don't know with what kind of equipment they claimed they were directly under where Jesus had been crucified he says and as they were looking they found all these blotches and stains below these in these rocks so Mount Calvary is on top where Jesus crucified and I don't many how many under how many feet of rocks is these caves down below and and and he says they take they take these samples he says and I took these samples to a laboratory in isra and some some some some Jewish lab technicians he said said I want you to do certain test on this samples he says I think it's blood he said old blood he said they did some test and they said yes this is Old Blood this is his story and he says I want you to do another test on this Blood and he gave the name of it and and and and these lab technicians they told them you're wasting your time this is old blood it's there it's there's no life in it it's dead old blood and he says do the test anyways he says nothing will come of it it won't show anything so his test testimony was this that when they did that test he says these these these these uh scientists they came back and told him he said this blood is still alive and he says and the astonishing thing is is that this Blood only contain ains 23 chromosomes the the Y right the the man gives the X the woman the why and then he said he says you know who's blood that is they said no he says and it's a very emotional video he says this blood is the blood of your Messiah he's a Catholic man they're looking for something to establish their Catholic Doctrine but if that blood was the blood of a man with only 23 chromosomes that he got from his mother then that man is not the Lamb of God for that lamb was now a lamb with spots with wrinkles isn't worthy to be the sacrifice for you and I you see Mary Maria was the mother in the sense that this child came from her out of her womb but Mary was not the biological mother in any way shape or form Mary was the incubator and the seed of God could not be comp compromised and that day at at at at the court of ponus pilot that tribunal after Jesus had been four days they had beat him they had slapped him they had mocked him they had interrogated him and the Bible says he never said a word like a lamb he was silent except when they told him don't you know I have the power to put you to death he couldn't be silent then I'm sure he smiled and he said no you have no power over me I'm not here because of the power of Rome I'm not here because the power of the Jewish church I'm not here because of the false accusations of the high priest what has me here today is thus sayith the Lord I had an appointment to be here to fulfill a Ministry to bring Salvation to my daughters to my sons to my children to those who are lost to those who are blind to those who are sick to those who are afflicted it's the power of God that has me here Pontius pilot his wife has a dream she's a Roman she ain't Jewish they have they don't have much religion they're just pagans but she has a dream and in that dream it shakes her so much she goes to her husband tells him the dream she says have nothing to do with crucifying this man nothing good will become of it when when Pontius pilot after four days stands on the outer court and tells all of Israel this man Jesus King of the Jews we've interrogated him for four days he says and I find no fault in him how many days in the Old Testament did the lamb the natural Lambs had to they had to search for anything wrong with them the high priest four days they had four days to find a perfect lamb for this sacrifice that would be a sacrifice for the sins of all the people this day at this tribunal Pontius pilot a pagan man not a Believer he's Anointed with a prophetic word and he said this man Jesus of nazare King of the Jews I find no fault in him he was the most powerful person more power than the high priest himself Israel and he declared and he declared Jesus Christ the lamb without spot without wrinkle and the Book of the Lamb's Book of Life is unfolding in chapter two of Matthew it says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem verse one that was a prophecy being fulfilled of where he would be born and these wise men came saying where is he where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him that was a prophecy of the prophets coming to pass verse three when Herod the king heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief pre all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophets and this was Prophecies of the Bible five verses five verses and prophecy after prophecy after prophecies unfolding and they read the prophet of Hosea and thou Bethlehem verse 6 in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel we've only entered into six verses and every one of Prophecy is unfolding then Herod when he had private called the wise men verse S inquired of them diligently what time the star appear and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search dig for the young child when you have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they Departed Lo the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was at this time when the when these three kings came they say Jesus was a two or threeyear old boy he wasn't a baby in a crib no more that's how the Shepherds saw him they first came the Bible says in verse 10 when they saw the star they Rejoice exceedingly great joy and when they came into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worship and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gold and frankincense and mirth and being warned of God in a [Music] dream that they should not return to herid and being and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they deped into their own country way we know the story how it goes on that after a couple of years Herod saw that he was mocked of the wise men and the Bible says he sent forth and and killed all the children that were in Bethlehem another prophecy fulfilled verse after verse verse after verse the Bible this Lamb's Book of Life is thus saith the Lord and thus sayth the Lord and thus sayith the Lord and thus sayth the Lord over and over and over but there is a thus sayith the Lord that
