that we can do good and not evil yeah as we stand to our feet this evening and we will continue in what we've been speaking here part five Jesus evangelist prophet and Lamb of God turn with me to Matthew and we'll be reading first from Matthew a scripture we've gone to often but uh but a scripture that I believe is just as as profound even as as Hebrews 13 and8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so let's read there in Matthew 13 and beginning at verse 34 this this was the parable of the sewer and that's what it's called because Jesus in this Parable is speaking a lot about the sewing of seeds but it's really Jesus teaching on the generation of Jesus Christ and a eration of vipers it's really Jesus teaching on two seeds the seed of God and the seed of the serpent but if you take this Parable naturally then you just simply call it the parable of the S it's like if you take Matthew 28:19 naturally literally where Jesus said go into baptize in the name of the father and the son of the Holy Spirit if you take it literally you've gone as far as you're going to go with that par you place a period there and if you take Matthew 13 literally you say wow Jesus speaks on on sewing of seeds why that's just ex why why that's a god of nature and you stop there you close your Bible you put it on the shelf and you go do something else for the day but when Revelation strikes it goes beyond the the the literal we really do start reading between the lines that's called Revelation so Matthew 13 verse 34 all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spoke he not this was his ministry this is the way he would speak and the reason he would speak this way is so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have kept been kept secret from the foundation of the world he preached this way he talked this way he walked this way to fulfill the prophecy of the prophets you and I God wants us to talk a certain way he wants us to walk a certain way he wants us to treat each other a certain certain way and when we do we're fulfilling the Prophecies of the prophets that have spok of how a Believer would act what his conduct would be of how a father would act how a husband would should be how a wife should be how the how the children should respond home when you do it God's way you know why you're able to do it because you're being anointed of the Prophecies of the prophets that were spoken verse 35 Jesus spoke in multitudes in in Parables and without us Parable sping not unto the multitudes because that it might be fulfilled which was spoken the the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things in these Parables which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world I'm bringing them now and yet the parable itself is a mystery but now that I'm here I will reveal it to you that's the way I'm going to build this New Testament Church word upon word line upon line Revelation to your hearts and Minds verse 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house he's in the house with his disciples it's always been his way and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field he said he's he's not just talking like a farmer there there's more to this what is it he answered and said unto them he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord receive the worship of your Saints and show that you received it by giving us something back the revelation of The Parables of your ministry we thank you now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated Jesus evangelist Prophet Lamb of God just to background a little bit he began his ministry in Matthew 4 as an evangelist praying for the sick his message was simple repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand in Matthew 5 this evangelist begins a teaching on Perfection the way back into his presence is what this teaching and Perfection was about in this natural body so that we can find the way to feel his presence to live in his presence Matthew 6 and 7 the teaching un Perfection continues to unfold to Israel he bringing Israel things that have been hidden since the foundation of the world he's telling them things that only the ears of Adam had ever heard but Adam failed to keep that word but my word shall not return to me void it he has said so we're looking for a people for a man looking for a woman will take him at his word Matthew 6 and 7 is this teaching and it continues to unfold to Israel the prophetic Ministry had begun we just finished reading in Matthew 13:34 and and in and and at the end of that verse in verse 37 it tells us he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man what's it telling us the prophetic Ministry had begun now Jesus is unfolding a Ministry of evangelist which he'll continue still but he's opened up his ministry of of a prophet a prophetic Ministry because the prophetic Ministry now is sowing The Good Seed it's shwing the word of God it's showing the things that Adam alone had heard at one time now he wants to deposit it in the in a Heart full of Faith now he wants to deposit the good seed and fertile ground now he wants you to wants you to bring you to a bornn again experience so that you'll become a living Soul that's the seed that's laying dormant in a state of Amnesia and the son of man has come to Quicken that seed within God rich and mercy unfolding a fful Ministry in Matthew 8 Jesus comes down from the mountain he had he had finished saying all that he's going to tell us on Perfection what is perfection it's a friendship restored with the father it takes us it takes us from justification a born again experience it will finally take us all the way into eternity Perfection is once again Eternal beings in an eternal place with an eternal God in Fellowship again back again to the beginning and every word of God fulfilled and the Prophecies of the prophets is what eternity will be in Matthew 8 he comes down from the mountain and he continues now back into his ministri andang he heals the leper who had been in these meetings who had been here listening to these teachings who was there when he went up the mountain and he was there when he came down the mountain after the leper had heard everything he heard he said this man if he wants to he can heal me of this leprosy and you know what I'm going to ask him if you've got a need if you got a desire if you've got something you want to ask him ask him and believe that he can do it just like this leper said so the leper is healed Jesus tells him tell no man but go to the synagogue go back to church offer the gift of that Moses commanded it will declare to everyone in that synagogue the testimony you'll be a testimony that though you were covered with lepry no you were in your last days of life no you were living in in in pain and suffering that God has healed you and when they ask you you won't be able to hold back where did who healed you Jesus of Nazareth so the leper goes you remember the story you remember the gift that a leper was supposed to offered been healed he was to take two turtle doves to the priest and the priest was to was to St stand there and take the two doves at the altar one of those one of those one of those turtle doves he would put in a vessel of clay and in the vessel of clay killed that bird it represented God in flesh who gave his life and died for you and us and by the sprinkling of his blood wash our sins away us takes away the complexes the the very ritual oh the anointing if you knew what you were doing the anointing on the ritual when you know what you're doing is a lifechanging experience like the Lord's Supper and the washing of feet when you partake if you really know what you're doing and what it means every time it's a sovereign lifechanging experience because you understand what it represents and when this leper went and gave his offering this offering was a testimony of what God had done for this leper through the blood of Christ but he wasn't dead yet in the eyes of God the lamb had been slain before the foundation of the world then the priest would take the blood of this dead bird and they take the live one the Dead one in the vessel of clay Jehovah God in flesh who died on the cross and Spilled his blood now the blood of that of that dead bird is sprinkled on the live one seven times the that represents the believer through seven Church ages from the days of Jesus our days now if you can believe that he's the turtle dove that he's God in a vessel of C he died Cross of C by his blood you are Sanctified by his blood you are clean by his blood you are saved by his blood you have a victory every then you are that bird that was sprinkled and then they would take that bird to an open field and they'd set it free and the Bible says as it went flying with the blood stains all over it it was crying holy holy unto the Lord God Almighty chapter eight he continues his ministry as an evangelist praying for the sick a Centurian a gentile comes to him he had already told he was about to set his church in order he he was here he he came as king of the Jews he was also fulfilling the part as Lion of the tribe of Judah he didn't come to the Gentile peoples but this Centurion who like the leop his ministry had caught the attention of this Centurion this Centurion had always been in awe of power and authority and when he saw Jesus he said I've never seen power and authority like my servant is sick I'm going to go ask him I'm going to go ask him to do something that I believe he can do because he's done it before he's healed us he's saved us he's put food on the table he's given us jobs that we needed if he's done it before we can always believe you've done it before I know you can do it again it builds our faith and this Centurion goes to him and he says my servant is sick of Jesus said and he's a gentile now he says go I'll follow you listen oh no no it's I that need to follow you not to follow me no no I understand how Authority and power works I wouldn't dare ever walk in front of you I wouldn't dare ever tried to lead you no no you're the powerful one you are the authority you're Are the Healer the you're the one Mighty in battle every battle I face I follow you but this time you don't even have to come just speak the word and that's good enough for me just speak the word I'm a gentile I'm a Roman I'm not worthy that you come into my house Pagan house I haven't set my house in order I've got a lot of things in there that I wouldn't want you to see and yet he had Faith he saw the power The Authority a centurion the Evangelistic Ministry continues Matthew 8 verses 11 and 12 is a prophecy of Israel how Israel would be scattered throughout seven Church ages why did Jesus speak it in a parable that it might be fulfilled what the prophets like Ezekiel had spoken of the scattering of Israel and how that only a Remnant would remain how they would be persecuted the world over how they would be killed how they would be scattered in all the world and yet a Remnant would remain that's Israel today there is a Remnant there that's God's people not every Jew is God's people not every Israelite is God's people not every Gentile is the generation of Jesus Christ but there is a little flock God has a people Jew and Gentiles he died on the cross of Calvary Matthew 8 verses 16 to 18 the Bible says now great multitudes are following he's God but he's just one man in the physical one in Matthew 826 he surprised and he even shocked his disciples they were on a boat a storm in the sea began to begin to brew a dangerous one one that even them as Sailors became scared and fearful the Bible says and Jesus slept but he wasn't really asleep he was testing he was proving them and he was going to show them his power they thought what a great man he heals the sick he raises the dead but when they were on this storm and Jesus rises up in that boat and he speaks to the storm and the wind and the Sea obey him the disciples the Bible says were shocked they knew he could heal they knew he could command men and women they knew he could deliver people who were possessed with violent Devils but they still didn't believe he could do everything or anything that's why when he spoke to the Sea when he spoke to the wind and there was an instant calm shocked they said what manner of man is this that even the winds and the SE obey him this man was God this man was Jehovah this man was the creator of heavens and earth this man was the turtle dove and the vessel of clay what manner of man is this this was the man of Isaiah 7 this was the man of Isaiah 9 unto us a child is given us a son is born this was the man of Isaiah 53 bringing Revelation who has believed our report and to whom is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what Isaiah 53 was that's what Isaiah 53 is it was the opening of a new C it was the opening of the first SE was the opening of part one of a new testament God rich in Mercy and Matthew 9 as you remember the Evangelistic Ministry continues verses 9 1-8 Jesus is [Music] healing he continues as an evangelist let me turn to Matthew 9 Bible says and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own City sounds like Nazareth and they they brought to him sick people sick of the py a man and when he looked at this sick man of the PA he said to him son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee didn't speak to him healing he still had the policy but you know what had been washed away all his sins he was still sick in body but you know where he was wasn't sick anymore in that Soul he wasn't and some of the scribes said within themselves in their hearts mind this man blasphemeth they'd obviously never been in any of his meetings they didn't know him all they knew about him is what the high priest had told them what the denomination had told them stay away from this man fellowship with this man FAL Doctrine teaching he says and Jesus knowing their thoughts now he enters into the prophetic Ministry a discerner of the thought intents of the heart and he tells them wherefore think ye evil in your hearts this here this prophetic Ministry of Discerning the hearts this here where he said to this man sick of the py son be of good cheer thy sins be for for given Thee I I used to think and I've said it that I believed that Jesus began his ministry as Lamb of God when he entered Gethsemane I keep reading and looking into the scriptures I believe he entered into his lamb Ministry before that I I believe here in chapter n Jesus was transitioning Jesus was going from King of the Jews to Lamb of God because what did he do he declared thy sins be forgiven thee who can forgive sins but God who will shed his blood but the lamb who can do that but Jesus Christ the lamb Ministry so here it is evangelist Prophet King of the Jews now he's moving as Lamb of God is entering into the lamb Ministry all these Ministries in this life they're starting to overlap and as he had has need it steps into one it steps into another today is evangelist tomorrow he's Prophet now he's Lamb of God all the time he's moving around according to the particular need the person he's speaking to he'll be to you what you need him to be because he is all of it the Great I Am and Jesus knowing their thoughts wherefore think he evil in your hearts then he asked them a question what's easier to say in your opinion you're scribes that means you're educated you've gone to you went to the Community College you graduated from ASU you not only got a bachelor's now you have a master's some of you here have a PhD so let me ask you a question what's easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or rise and walk they couldn't answer him neither one is easy for men and women born in sin shaped iniquity coming to this world speaking Li and the more educated you get the more difficult this question becomes Jesus said that you might know that the son of man now he drops into his prophetic Ministry hath power on Earth not a son of man but the son of man God the prophet not Moses the prophet not Paul the prophet not Peter the prophet not William Bram the prophet God the prophet Jesus Christ that you might know that the son of man have power on Earth to forgive sins because it's here on this Earth in this flesh body where you have to know that your sins are forgiven or you won't know when you leave this body if you made it or not you must know here on Earth in this body but that you might know that the son of man have power on Earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the py arise take up thy bed and go into thy house now the multitudes they marveled they glorified God who has given such power to this man who is this man he's not your he's not your regular kind of a man that much they were understanding but they couldn't quite get it out of their mouths yet this is Christ this is the Son of God this is God made flesh but God was unfolding his personality his person showing himself as an evangelist showing himself as a prophet showing himself as a teacher himself as one who forgives sins L of God and he goes on speaking on healing in verse 15 he declares himself the bridegroom and you and I his bride in a parable it's Jesus because some of John's disciples come to him said we have a question for you they were John's disciples they had gotten out of their denominations they believed they were following a prophet and they were they had been baptized unto repentance they think they're in the word and they are but the problem was many were putting a period and saying this is it and it wasn't they needed to put a comma because when that Forerunner goes off the scene who was the messenger now the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ himself the bridegroom but they come to Jesus John's disciples they say why do we and the Pharisees fast of but th disciples fast not Jesus said unto them in a parable can the children of the Bride chamber mourn can the bride who's received a proposal of marriage can she be sad can she be moaning and groaning no no she's a bride adorning herself getting her wedding dress ready because she's got a promise one day he's riding down and taking me away to live with my husband eternally can the children of the bridegroom can the bride mourn as long as the bridegroom is with him how many of you when your husband ask who's not your husband asks you will you marry me and you said yes and he's happy and you're happy then he goes home he comes back to visit you the next day does the does the young lady that's accepted this proposal of mar does she say oh no he's back again no no I'm so glad to see you again why it's been a whole 24 hours I missed you that's what Jesus was saying to them chapter n he's going going through all these changes evangelist Prophet King of the Jews the Lamb of God savior healer he's vindicating his word so that all that the prophets have said are coming to pass his every move is the word being fulfilled of what the prophet spoke and we've got to come to that place where we realize our every [Music] move it's not the devil moving us like a little pond on a board God is moving Us in this world and when we realize there's a purpose a Divine Purpose a character building purpose then we realize it's because I'm his bride and I'm being adorned with the character of Jesus Christ and I'm not going to be sad about it because the end result is the wedding supper with my bridegroom for eternity Jesus the Evangelist a woman touched the Hem of His Garment she was healed Peter goes into the house of Peter's house Jesus does and Peter's mother Peter's mother's wife is sick she has a temperature he touches her you see though he had already manifested himself as a prophet and the bridegroom and the Lamb of God this little lady needed a touch of healing and he drops into his evangelist Ministry because there's healing in his hands he just touches her doesn't say a word the fever's gone he moves in and out of his fful ministry to fulfill the need that you have at the time it may not be an evangelist you always need you might need the pastor you might need a teaching and if you do guess what Jesus has provided it's his very nature that he's given us he heals the blind just by touching them there was a first pull of his ministry he was in the second pull of his ministry but though he was in the second pull of his ministry the gift of healing wasn't gone he could still turn around and touch someone as an evangelist though he was prophet though he was King of the Jews though he was Lamb of God he never lost that the he never lost a Ministry when he moved into the next it's just that the other Ministries became a minor and as he took steps the the next steps forward forward that became the major role he was playing but he could but he could always turn around and touch someone and heal them because that's what he is healer savior a quickening power for you and I the Bible says there was a dumb man POS possessed with the devil and when that devil was cast out the dumb spoke you know that reveals something to us that the devil he was possessed of was in the natural realm not the spiritual realm he wasn't possessed of a devil that made him that made him violent that's a spiritual realm he wasn't possessed of a devil that that that made him a liar that's a spiritual realm he wasn't possessed of a devil that made him an arrogant man that's a spiritual man the devil he was possessed was in the natural realm and he couldn't speak he was mute he was a nice man he was probably a good dad a great worker but but in the natural realm a demon had possessed him and he couldn't speak and Jesus cast it out with his words and once again the multitudes Marvel you know why they Marvel because the last prophet Israel had had been Malachi 400 years for 400 years they hadn't had a for 400 years they hadn't seen the power of God move for 400 years 400 years back was about the time a a a group rose up in the Church of Israel they called themselves Pharisees they were the they were legalists to the maximum they added burden upon burden upon burden upon they added rule upon rule upon rule upon the people what kind of rules ridiculous rules you got a cold you got to stay in your home for two weeks you're sick that's it shut down the business I heard you sneeze why AR you wearing a mask shame on you H it's the same spirit and it's a spirit of death and it's a spirit of Lies Spirit of denomination Spirit of the great heart Spirit of his daughter Harlot daughters chapter n Jesus sees the crowds and the multitudes growing that are following in verse 35 he says Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues they were still allowing him some of the priests to teach in their churches men like Nicodemus though they were getting in trouble for doing it and there he was preaching the gospel of the Kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people but the Bible says but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd wait a minute brother Daniel they were all members of this great denomination that's right that's why he had compassion on them that's why they were fainting that's why they were scattered that's why there was no unity in the people because the very Ministry kept them divided the very Ministry kept them in fear the high priest of Israel himself was at fault for this characteristics in the people he said they were sheep having no Shepherd they didn't have a leader to lead them into the presence of Christ as a matter of fact the leader would say to them don't anyone ever dare to go into the the holies of holies because if we don't kill you God will kill you to walk in that place and while they're preaching that in their pulpits Jesus is listening and his goal was to bring down the curtain so that you and I could walk into his presence you see the difference between denominationalism even in this thing that's called the message Lord have mercy and when Jesus saw this he said the Harvest truly is plenteous but the labors are few as a matter of fact it's just me and John right now and John was just a few days away from the ending of his ministry Herod would take him prisoner and bead him then Jesus says in the last verse of chapter nine pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest and he was the lord of the Harvest why did he say it that way he was speaking in a parable and it takes a revelation to catch what he was saying it must be quickened to you and I for Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against pray therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth labors into his Harvest chapter 10 Jesus begins to set the church in order what he said in the last verse of chapter nine was a prophecy of of this Prophet Jesus and now he's going to unfold the prophecy why that it might be fulfilled what he just said now he's going to bring it to pass because God is his own interpret in verse n he prophesies in verse 10 he interprets the prophecy he's he says and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples Matthew 9:38 was prophecy Matthew 10 is prophecy being fulfilled becoming history and when he had called unto his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease and as of yet none had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they may have been baptized for repentance but the revelation of the name of God to make the baptism a quickening power hadn't come yet and they were not partakers you say how can that be because thus is it thus it's written gifts and callings are even without repentance let's
