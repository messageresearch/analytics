[38:49] uh happy to see everyone
[38:53] here and we want to
[38:55] continue
[38:57] um on part
[38:59] [Music]
[39:01] 10 of what we've been speaking on
[39:06] Jesus evangelist Prophet Lamb of God
[39:11] watching the pattern of God's
[39:13] word there was a time when we read our
[39:18] Bibles and it seemed like if each
[39:21] chapter of the Bible was a little story
[39:23] all by
[39:25] itself
[39:28] and we couldn't put it all
[39:31] together but but we now
[39:34] realize that there's a pattern laying in
[39:36] all of God's
[39:39] word from Old Testament to New
[39:42] Testament and the lives of the
[39:45] Patriarchs was a pattern of things to
[39:49] come and hidden in the
[39:52] stories were
[39:54] prophecies even as Jacob when he was
[39:57] blessing his
[40:00] sons there in uh believe Genesis
[40:05] 49 and and and and for each
[40:09] son he he he be he gave a
[40:13] blessing and some for for some it was
[40:15] not a
[40:16] blessing for some he described their
[40:19] nature and and what they would
[40:23] do and it was all it was a prophetic
[40:26] word
[40:27] for Jacob was a
[40:29] prophet and then he gets to his son
[40:32] Judah and and it was indeed a a
[40:38] prophecy and and and it was through
[40:41] Judah that that the woman's seed would
[40:46] come it was through
[40:50] Judah that Messiah would
[40:52] come and when he told Judah thou art a
[40:55] lion
[40:57] even a lion's
[41:01] welp it was was it it he was speaking to
[41:06] Judah but it was a prophetic word and it
[41:10] was really speaking of Christ to
[41:13] come that he would be the lion of the
[41:16] tribe of
[41:17] Judah that that that that that old lion
[41:21] was the father
[41:23] God and that young lion would be God in
[41:27] a young
[41:30] lion which would be Jesus
[41:33] Christ the King of the Jews Lion of the
[41:37] tribe of
[41:38] Judah but then we realize as we're
[41:40] reading the
[41:44] gospels that though he was born lying of
[41:47] the tribe of
[41:48] Judah he never stepped into that
[41:52] position as a as as a king like men
[41:57] would want kings to
[41:59] be his kingship was
[42:03] different his kingship was one that he
[42:05] would give his life for his for his
[42:11] people for his children for his family
[42:16] this was a different kind of
[42:19] King no king of the
[42:22] Earth would ever do what this King
[42:25] did
[42:28] and then we read in the book of
[42:30] Samuel where Israel asked for a
[42:33] king and Samuel told
[42:36] them let me show you the way of the
[42:41] Kings let me tell you what he's going to
[42:44] do
[42:45] to let me tell you how he'll take your
[42:50] sons and draft them into his
[42:54] armies and many many will die in the
[42:58] [Music]
[42:59] battlefields and when they die he'll
[43:02] just bring more of your sons to the
[43:05] battle he say the king will he Kings
[43:08] will take your
[43:10] daughters use them as
[43:12] Cooks make them slaves cause them to
[43:16] serve in in in your in in in in your
[43:19] mansions in your in
[43:22] everything he says the king will see
[43:25] what land you
[43:28] possess and he'll choose the best and
[43:30] let you keep the
[43:32] worst he says that's what Kings do of
[43:35] the
[43:37] earth even the best of them at some
[43:41] point they can't help
[43:44] themselves but get lifted
[43:47] up and the more they get lifted up the
[43:51] more they
[43:53] want as a billionaire once said
[43:57] said a Rockefeller Rockefeller there was
[44:00] President there was governor of
[44:03] California in
[44:06] 1963 he was already a billionaire he
[44:09] come from a family a wealthy
[44:15] family and they asked him how much he
[44:18] says you could spend millions of dollars
[44:21] a day and you wouldn't spend it all
[44:23] before you
[44:25] die
[44:30] I just like to know what your opinion is
[44:32] of what you think is enough
[44:38] money and he said
[44:40] well just a little bit more he
[44:44] said that's that is the
[44:47] nature and that's what Kings come
[44:51] to but this one who was born King of the
[44:55] Jews
[44:58] when he entered into his
[45:00] kingship he entered in as a
[45:03] servant he came as an
[45:05] evangelist he didn't run to to he didn't
[45:08] run to a great
[45:11] mansion He didn't take anything from
[45:15] anyone but this King came
[45:18] giving and
[45:21] giving this King
[45:23] came praying for for the sick this King
[45:29] came
[45:31] healing
[45:34] virtue raising the
[45:37] dead making the cripples
[45:40] walk making the blind eyes to
[45:44] see giving hearing to the deaf
[45:48] [Music]
[45:50] ears he was born King of the
[45:53] Jews and he began his kingship
[45:57] in in servitude to the
[45:59] people oh never lived a king like this
[46:05] [Music]
[46:06] before but the kings of the
[46:09] Earth are completely
[46:11] different and the longer they
[46:15] Reign the more they want and
[46:18] take from the people it is the nature of
[46:22] man but this King
[46:26] Jesus king of the
[46:28] Jews we see his attributes
[46:33] unfolding we see his message to the
[46:36] people it was a message of
[46:40] preparation he said behold the Kingdom
[46:43] of Heaven is at
[46:45] hand and then he began to serve
[46:48] them and heal
[46:50] them and give them
[46:53] life then he began to teach them
[46:56] them and bring forth the message of the
[47:00] Kingdom not the law
[47:04] anymore but a new message a message of
[47:08] life he opened to
[47:11] Israel the Lamb's Book of
[47:14] Life you see when Adam and Eve fell in
[47:17] the
[47:19] beginning they lost this
[47:22] book they lost this plan
[47:26] but
[47:27] nonetheless what God did what Moses
[47:30] wrote in
[47:32] Genesis is that when God kept his
[47:36] word said in the day that you eat
[47:38] thereof of this
[47:41] tree this tree of the knowledge of Good
[47:43] and
[47:45] Evil that day you'll surely
[47:48] die death will strike
[47:51] you and when you fall all creation will
[47:55] fall
[47:56] with the trees that give fruit no longer
[48:01] will the fruit just stay on the tree
[48:03] till you want to eat
[48:06] it but even the trees on the fruit will
[48:09] have a
[48:13] lifespan and when it's plucked off its
[48:17] life it will die but even if you don't
[48:21] take the fruit off the
[48:23] tree death has struck
[48:26] them the fruit will rot right on the
[48:29] tree after a certain
[48:32] season you see death had struck the
[48:36] trees the fall of Adam and Eve had
[48:39] brought death to the
[48:42] trees the fall of Adam and Eve had
[48:44] brought death to the
[48:47] cattle the fall of Adam and Eve had
[48:50] brought death to
[48:53] everything and when they
[48:56] fell all creation fell with
[49:00] them from the Beast to the
[49:03] field to the fouls of the
[49:06] earth to
[49:08] mankind to everything that liveth and
[49:12] breath to every plant and tree that's on
[49:15] the face of the
[49:17] Earth nothing was living forever
[49:21] now death had struck
[49:24] everything and as God puts his son and
[49:27] daughter out of
[49:30] Eden he gives them a
[49:34] sign in a symbol and the Bible says and
[49:39] Adam created and God
[49:42] created
[49:45] skins to cover his
[49:48] children and their
[49:52] nakedness he didn't cover them because
[49:56] God was
[50:00] ashamed he covered them because he was
[50:03] speaking to us
[50:06] prophetically that though your my
[50:08] children have
[50:10] fallen yet are they
[50:13] covered and the skins with which they
[50:16] are
[50:17] covered
[50:19] represents that something has died for
[50:23] them that that they could become
[50:26] covered and the covering was a
[50:29] protection protection now from the
[50:32] cold before the fall there was no
[50:35] cold protection now from extreme
[50:40] heat before the fall there was no
[50:43] extreme
[50:44] heat it all spoke of death the Four
[50:51] Seasons we look at it we say wow wow
[50:55] Four
[50:57] Seasons they all have their
[51:01] beauty and as as men and women and
[51:04] humans they do but
[51:08] nonetheless all four seasons speak of a
[51:11] cycle of life and
[51:15] death because of the Fall because of
[51:20] Disobedience that had taken place in the
[51:24] beginning and all creation
[51:27] fell when the first Adam
[51:30] fell but God made a
[51:32] promise and even in clothing Adam and
[51:37] Eve it was a symbol that something had
[51:41] died for
[51:42] them so that they could be
[51:45] covered the Bible doesn't say it was
[51:47] lamb
[51:50] skins just God created skins for
[51:54] them but the Bible does
[51:57] said in Revelations
[52:00] 13 he said that the lamb was
[52:03] slain since the foundation of the
[52:07] world and the creating of these
[52:11] skins represented the
[52:14] sacrifice that was already done for
[52:16] God's
[52:17] children in the mind of God but the plan
[52:21] of
[52:22] restoration went into the hands of the
[52:24] father
[52:27] that's the book that the father was
[52:30] hiding that he was holding in his hands
[52:34] in Revelations 5 where the scripture
[52:37] says where John is seeing a vision and
[52:40] he he says and I saw one sitting on the
[52:44] throne with a book in his hand sealed
[52:48] with seven
[52:49] seeds that was the Lamb's Book that was
[52:53] the that was the book of restoration
[52:56] that would
[52:57] restore everything that the Locust had
[53:00] eaten everything that the caterpillar
[53:02] had
[53:05] eaten everything that these four worms
[53:07] had
[53:09] eaten representing the ride of
[53:13] Lucifer twisting and perverting all of
[53:19] mankind but
[53:22] Genesis the skins that God created
[53:27] it was a prophetic
[53:29] creation it was a spoken word
[53:33] creation
[53:35] declaring something has
[53:37] died so that you can
[53:41] live a
[53:43] lamb the lamb that was
[53:45] slain in the mind of God since the
[53:48] foundation of the
[53:52] world and God had a book in his
[53:56] hand that was the Lamb's
[54:00] Book that was a new
[54:04] covenant we have it now we've had it
[54:08] I've had it all my
[54:11] life it's called the
[54:14] Bible it's called the New Testament the
[54:17] old was a shadow of things to
[54:20] come the new was the plan being put into
[54:24] effect
[54:27] and the first coming of
[54:28] Christ was the opening of part one
[54:33] called the first
[54:35] seal and when the seal is taken off the
[54:40] scroll the seal can be
[54:44] tossed it was
[54:46] wax it it could be a leather or
[54:52] strap or of linen cloth
[54:57] they would tie the
[54:59] knot some would then take wax and pour
[55:01] it over the knot and put an emblem of
[55:03] their ring on it
[55:08] the to show it was a sealed
[55:12] scroll it was a sealed book it was a
[55:16] sealed
[55:18] message but that but that book had
[55:21] someone that it was specifically going
[55:24] to
[55:26] and this Lamb's Book of
[55:28] Life was made
[55:31] specifically to go to
[55:34] you you were the
[55:36] one God would Open the Eyes of your
[55:40] understanding you were the one who would
[55:43] seal the who would see the seal loosed
[55:45] and torn
[55:47] off you were the one that God wanted you
[55:51] to put your hands on his
[55:54] book and
[55:56] unfolded and see the promises of
[56:00] salvation of
[56:01] healing of change of making us men and
[56:06] women to the stature of a perfect man
[56:09] Jesus
[56:10] Christ oh that's what we've been seeing
[56:13] unfolding in this Gospel of Matthew in
[56:17] this Lamb's Book of Life we' been seen
[56:20] the
[56:21] unfolding DET detail upon detail eyes of
[56:26] understanding
[56:27] open oh what a book only God could write
[56:32] a book like
[56:34] this 66
[56:38] authors well less than that because some
[56:42] wrote more than one
[56:45] gospel more than one
[56:50] epistle I think it was like 40
[56:53] some scribe
[56:57] es of 66 books
[57:04] the
[57:06] written thousands of years
[57:10] apart but with
[57:12] Revelation they all come together
[57:15] just every type every
[57:18] symbol every proverb every
[57:23] Parable they come perfectly
[57:28] together then they come perfectly
[57:30] together in the Lamb's Book of
[57:34] Life for the Lamb's Book of
[57:37] Life is the book of
[57:40] restoration the Lamb's Book of
[57:43] Life was God's
[57:45] plan to take away the curse from
[57:48] us
[57:50] individually loose us from the
[57:53] curse of a natural
[57:56] birth to a supernatural
[58:00] birth to an Immaculate
[58:03] birth just like Jesus
[58:06] had say oh wait a
[58:08] minute we can't have a birth like
[58:11] Jesus we must his
[58:15] birth was ordained of the
[58:17] father and totally
[58:21] Supernatural and spoken
[58:23] word
[58:25] your Born Again
[58:27] experience is totally
[58:32] Supernatural it makes it an Immaculate
[58:36] birth for by one
[58:39] Spirit are we born into one
[58:42] body and made
[58:45] partakers of the
[58:47] promises in the Lamb's Book of
[58:49] Life on how to be
[58:52] perfect in other words how to
[58:55] return and get back into the
[58:58] channel of eternal
[59:01] life which was the original
[59:04] promise for Adam and Eve had they stayed
[59:08] in the
[59:09] word not looked for a
[59:13] shortcut you realize the
[59:16] message that Lucifer the
[59:19] serpent took to
[59:22] Eve was still a message
[59:26] that you can be like
[59:27] God the same message that God had was
[59:30] teaching
[59:33] Adam that he could be a chip off the old
[59:40] block that he could be just like
[59:43] God God was teaching
[59:46] Adam how to handle the spoken
[59:50] word that this son could do the same
[59:54] works as as the
[59:56] father and by the spoken word bring the
[59:59] family of God into
[1:00:03] existence the serpent went to
[1:00:05] Eve and said that's a great message I
[1:00:09] believe that
[1:00:10] too but I've got a shortcut for
[1:00:14] you and you can get there
[1:00:17] faster matter of fact I can take you
[1:00:20] there to that promise like
[1:00:23] that then you can go show Adam and then
[1:00:27] both of you can go show God and see look
[1:00:31] we did it without you aren't you proud
[1:00:33] of
[1:00:34] us oh you see Satan works the same trap
[1:00:38] today is that what you believe well I
[1:00:41] know how to get there
[1:00:44] quicker you just have to sidestep the
[1:00:47] word of
[1:00:49] God and I'll get you
[1:00:52] there much quicker
[1:00:56] Satan Lucifer The Serpent and we see the
[1:01:00] pattern of God's
[1:01:02] word it allows us to recognize our day
[1:01:05] in its
[1:01:07] message when we can
[1:01:10] recognize how part one
[1:01:13] unfolded first seal will begin to
[1:01:17] recognize how part
[1:01:19] seven the seventh seal the second coming
[1:01:24] unfold
[1:01:25] because the pattern Remains the
[1:01:28] Same because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:01:32] yesterday today and
[1:01:34] forever so in visions of the last book
[1:01:37] in the
[1:01:39] Bible here the prophetic word is also
[1:01:43] unfolding This Book of
[1:01:45] Revelations is also God's Plan of
[1:01:48] Redemption and every symbol is
[1:01:52] mentioned for a Divine Purpose
[1:01:56] this is how Jesus said it in Matthew
[1:02:00] 11 he said at that time Jesus answered
[1:02:05] and
[1:02:07] said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[1:02:11] Heaven and
[1:02:12] Earth because thou has hid these things
[1:02:14] from the wise and
[1:02:17] prudental them unto
[1:02:19] babies Matthew
[1:02:22] 11:25 so what things had he hid
[1:02:26] the 24 verses
[1:02:28] before verse 25 had
[1:02:31] been in Matthew 11 and what was Matthew
[1:02:35] 11 Jesus teaching
[1:02:37] us his first
[1:02:39] coming not that I'm going to come not
[1:02:43] that it's prophesied that I'm going to
[1:02:46] come he was teaching them I have come I
[1:02:51] am here Elijah from the Baptist
[1:02:55] was already his ministry had
[1:02:57] ended he was sitting in a in a Roman
[1:03:02] prison a prisoner of Herod he was soon
[1:03:06] to be
[1:03:08] beheaded their Ministries overlapped a
[1:03:13] bit and when John was placed in
[1:03:16] prison Jesus had started already his
[1:03:20] ministry and he saw
[1:03:22] John matter of fact he knew when John
[1:03:26] was placed in
[1:03:29] prison he knew he would be
[1:03:32] beheaded he knew it was his
[1:03:34] time to begin the
[1:03:37] teaching out of the Lamb's Book of
[1:03:41] Life and how we could be
[1:03:44] restored how we could be
[1:03:46] changed John had already begun the
[1:03:50] teaching he had laid down the
[1:03:53] foundation for Israel to be
[1:03:56] saved for Jewish men and women to be
[1:03:59] changed the
[1:04:01] foundation until the opening of the
[1:04:03] first
[1:04:04] seal was this repent and be
[1:04:09] baptized but more would be added the
[1:04:12] power of the name would be
[1:04:14] added the name of the Lamb would be
[1:04:18] added so that we could understand our
[1:04:21] Salvation so we could see that a key
[1:04:25] gave his life for us that we could be
[1:04:29] covered with the wedding dress of his
[1:04:35] word Jesus in Matthew
[1:04:40] 11:25 at that time Jesus answered and
[1:04:44] said I thank thee oh
[1:04:47] Father Lord of Heaven and
[1:04:50] Earth because thou has hid these things
[1:04:55] what
[1:04:57] things the 24 verses before the verse
[1:05:03] 25 you have hidden these
[1:05:05] things from the wise and
[1:05:08] prudent and has revealed them unto
[1:05:13] babies not little children
[1:05:17] literally it's
[1:05:19] symbolic prophetic
[1:05:22] statement but those of his
[1:05:24] children who were born in sin and now
[1:05:28] have been born again these are the babes
[1:05:32] the Born Again
[1:05:34] children Jesus Christ these are the ones
[1:05:38] would be given
[1:05:40] Revelation that the wise and The Prudent
[1:05:42] of this
[1:05:43] world they they cannot get it because
[1:05:47] they must be born again together and
[1:05:49] they don't believe in being born
[1:05:53] again
[1:05:54] so can they receive it
[1:05:57] no you must be born again or you cannot
[1:06:03] see the Kingdom of
[1:06:08] Heaven you might say brother Daniel you
[1:06:10] think that was a good
[1:06:13] idea well in verse
[1:06:15] 26 Jesus said even so father for so it
[1:06:21] seemed good in thy sight
[1:06:25] God said it I believe it that settles
[1:06:31] it people want to enter into
[1:06:35] arguments that women can
[1:06:38] preach I
[1:06:40] say the Jud the judish the the church
[1:06:43] that God established in the
[1:06:47] wilderness and the ministry he
[1:06:50] established he did not Place women in
[1:06:53] Ministry
[1:06:54] that was the Judgment of
[1:06:59] Jehovah in the New
[1:07:01] Testament Paul
[1:07:03] continued with the same thought under a
[1:07:07] New
[1:07:08] Covenant and he did not Place women
[1:07:12] in God's
[1:07:14] Prophet God
[1:07:17] himself if you think
[1:07:19] different take it up with
[1:07:22] God
[1:07:25] I believe it I will stand with it
[1:07:29] because I know I'm
[1:07:30] standing with the Lord Jesus I know I'm
[1:07:33] standing with Jehovah
[1:07:35] God I'm standing with a man who sits on
[1:07:38] the
[1:07:39] throne with a book in his
[1:07:43] hand God didn't make
[1:07:45] women to do everything a man could
[1:07:49] do God made the
[1:07:51] sisters to do the many things
[1:07:55] that we cannot
[1:07:57] do yeah and God didn't make man to try
[1:08:02] and do everything a woman could
[1:08:05] do obviously he
[1:08:08] can't God made man God made
[1:08:15] woman he made him
[1:08:17] different in in his mind in his
[1:08:20] Sovereign
[1:08:21] mind he knew exactly
[1:08:24] what he was
[1:08:25] doing I'll stay with
[1:08:28] Jesus I'll stay with the word I'll
[1:08:31] follow the god that created heavens and
[1:08:34] earth who became flesh who was born King
[1:08:38] of the
[1:08:39] Jews and in his kingship
[1:08:43] role he immediately entered into into
[1:08:50] servitude to his
[1:08:52] people
[1:08:56] and the purpose of
[1:08:58] watching part one
[1:09:00] unfold be to watch the pattern of God's
[1:09:04] word and that and to see that he's
[1:09:06] indeed
[1:09:10] unchanging in all of his
[1:09:12] ways as we stand to our feet this
[1:09:14] morning
[1:09:17] SC turn with me to Hebrews 13
[1:09:22] and8
[1:09:28] Hebrews 13
[1:09:30] and8 it reads like
[1:09:32] this the Apostle
[1:09:35] Paul a prophet an apostle he served as a
[1:09:39] pastor for a season to the Church of
[1:09:43] Ephesus he did the work of an
[1:09:46] evangelist he had a gift in his life to
[1:09:48] pray for the
[1:09:51] sick and God used them in all these ways
[1:09:55] as he used many
[1:09:56] men as he used William brandham William
[1:10:00] yes William brandom
[1:10:03] said I can't be a prophet if I'm an
[1:10:07] evangelist be a
[1:10:09] pastor I I you can't you can't mix these
[1:10:14] Ministries and yet that's exactly what
[1:10:16] God had him to
[1:10:18] do it's not what he wanted to
[1:10:21] do he wanted to say God make me one
[1:10:24] thing and I'll just do
[1:10:27] that no he said I'm going to have you
[1:10:30] unfold the pattern of God's
[1:10:33] word like I myself you're going to come
[1:10:36] as an
[1:10:38] evangelist like I myself I'm going to
[1:10:40] give you a gift to pray for the
[1:10:43] sick lift up the faith of the
[1:10:45] people like I myself I'm going to speak
[1:10:48] to you and tell you the intents of the
[1:10:51] hearts of the
[1:10:52] people
[1:10:55] it'll prove the ministry is
[1:10:59] prophetic like
[1:11:00] myself I'm going to have you
[1:11:03] teach about this seventh
[1:11:06] seal you're going to be an
[1:11:09] evangelist you're going to be a pastor
[1:11:12] at some point you're going to be an
[1:11:15] apostle and you'll travel the world
[1:11:17] seven
[1:11:19] times you you are Elijah the prophet
[1:11:25] you see the pattern of God's
[1:11:26] word again in Paul just like in Christ
[1:11:32] in William brandom it's just like in
[1:11:35] Paul it's a pattern of God's word
[1:11:39] Hebrews 13
[1:11:40] and8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:11:45] today and forever let's pray Heavenly
[1:11:49] Father we thank you that you're opening
[1:11:52] the eyes of understanding
[1:11:55] and giving
[1:11:56] us revelation we thank you now in Jesus
[1:12:00] name amen amen you may be
[1:12:04] seated if you turn with me in your
[1:12:08] Bibles because we've uh we've arrived at
[1:12:11] Matthew
[1:12:13] 11 in this
[1:12:15] teaching entitled
[1:12:18] Jesus evangelist Prophet Lamb of God we
[1:12:23] began at uh verse
[1:12:25] one we actually began at verse at the
[1:12:28] chapter
[1:12:29] 4 and then we drop back to verse
[1:12:33] one and followed through and we've pre
[1:12:37] repeated ourselves
[1:12:38] much and that was on purpose that was
[1:12:42] planned until we have arrived now to
[1:12:45] chapter 11 of the book
[1:12:49] of but chapter 11 is parallel with
[1:12:54] Revelations 61
[1:12:56] and2 one is the prophecy the other is
[1:13:00] the prophecy being
[1:13:03] fulfilled one was the spoken
[1:13:06] word one is the Manifest manifestation
[1:13:09] of that spoken
[1:13:11] word so Revelation
[1:13:14] 6 verse one and
[1:13:16] two and I
[1:13:18] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[1:13:22] seals
[1:13:25] and I heard as it were the noise of
[1:13:28] [Music]
[1:13:30] thunder so what the Bible is
[1:13:33] saying is that the noise of a
[1:13:36] thunder represents the opening of a
[1:13:39] seal did you see
[1:13:42] that it was there all the
[1:13:45] time it was there all the time this
[1:13:49] divinely revealed mystery
[1:13:52] truth
[1:13:55] and it says and I saw when the lamb
[1:13:57] opened one of the
[1:14:00] seals and and I
[1:14:04] heard as it were the noise of
[1:14:07] thunder so now we
[1:14:09] know that the noise of
[1:14:13] Thunder that
[1:14:15] symbol
[1:14:17] represented the opening of a
[1:14:19] seal what if it would have said seven
[1:14:22] Thunders uttered their
[1:14:25] voices what would that
[1:14:28] represent would it represent the
[1:14:30] revealing and unfolding of Seven
[1:14:35] Seals it could and it
[1:14:40] did one of the four
[1:14:45] beasts so a thunder represented the
[1:14:49] opening of this first
[1:14:52] seal you might say brother Daniel it
[1:14:55] didn't say the first
[1:14:58] seal it just said one of the
[1:15:02] seal but when you but when you get to
[1:15:04] Revelations
[1:15:07] 63 it says and when he had opened the
[1:15:11] second
[1:15:15] seal so what was the seal before
[1:15:20] that wouldn't it be the first
[1:15:23] you know what you're doing this morning
[1:15:26] you're reading between the
[1:15:28] lines Revelation is striking our
[1:15:32] heart the book has become a new
[1:15:35] book William brandom said after he
[1:15:38] preached the
[1:15:39] seals the Bible has become a new
[1:15:46] book a brand new
[1:15:48] book he was receiving
[1:15:51] Revelation like he never
[1:15:54] before the Lamb's Book of Life was
[1:15:58] opening up to
[1:16:00] him he was a prophet but you and I have
[1:16:05] prophetic
[1:16:07] Insight because we're the Lamb's
[1:16:10] wife we're if the if the mind that
[1:16:14] was in
[1:16:16] Christ the
[1:16:18] husband be in
[1:16:20] you it will Quicken your mind
[1:16:24] to know what the father wants
[1:16:27] done with his word in your
[1:16:36] life and I saw when the lamb opened one
[1:16:39] of the
[1:16:40] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[1:16:43] of
[1:16:49] thunder and I heard as it were the noise
[1:16:52] of of Thunder
[1:16:57] 61 so a
[1:16:59] thunder the noise of a
[1:17:02] thunder
[1:17:04] represented one of the
[1:17:06] seals now the lamb opened the
[1:17:10] seal but it was one of the first
[1:17:14] beasts that began the
[1:17:17] teaching when did the lamb do
[1:17:20] this when the first seal opened
[1:17:24] when he was the lion of the tribe of
[1:17:27] Judah the symbol of the two
[1:17:31] animals is not the symbol of the two
[1:17:35] animals isn't it's not two animals it's
[1:17:40] two
[1:17:41] ministries of one man Jesus the
[1:17:46] Christ why was it the
[1:17:48] lamb that had opened one of the
[1:17:51] seals or the the first one because this
[1:17:55] is the Lamb's Book of Life That's
[1:18:00] opening lamb
[1:18:03] Ministry was salvation for
[1:18:06] all all
[1:18:08] people Gentile lamb
[1:18:12] Ministry was to All
[1:18:14] Nations T the lamb Ministry is the
[1:18:20] opening of The Book of
[1:18:21] redemption
[1:18:23] the lamb
[1:18:25] Ministry is the beginning of a new
[1:18:28] testament and like all founders of a
[1:18:32] book it tells us when he was
[1:18:35] born it tells us the life and Ministry
[1:18:38] he
[1:18:39] had it tells us when he died it tells us
[1:18:43] when he was
[1:18:44] buried but the founder of this book he
[1:18:48] rose again and it tells us he rose again
[1:18:53] and we have experienced through a
[1:18:55] personal
[1:18:57] experience Jesus Christ that he is risen
[1:19:02] because he's leading us because he's
[1:19:04] guiding us because he's convicted us of
[1:19:08] sin because we see we're
[1:19:10] changing we are being better fathers we
[1:19:14] are wanting to be better mothers we are
[1:19:17] wanting to be better sons and
[1:19:21] daughters do you see what's
[1:19:24] happening the promises of this lamb in
[1:19:26] this Lamb's Book of
[1:19:29] Life but it's not for all it's for a
[1:19:33] chosen people for there's two seeds upon
[1:19:37] the Earth the seed of the serpent the
[1:19:41] tears and the seed of God the children
[1:19:45] the
[1:19:46] kingdom Revelations 13
[1:19:49] and8 it says this and all that dwell
[1:19:53] upon the Earth shall worship
[1:19:58] him it was speaking of the
[1:20:02] Beast it was speaking of the
[1:20:05] Dragon it said and all that dwell upon
[1:20:09] the Earth shall worship this Beast shall
[1:20:11] worship this
[1:20:16] Dragon whose names are not written in
[1:20:18] the Book of Life of the
[1:20:21] Lamb
[1:20:24] slain from the foundation of the
[1:20:28] world that means in Genesis where God
[1:20:31] created
[1:20:33] skins representing this lamb he had
[1:20:37] slain in his mind in this book that
[1:20:40] would be called the
[1:20:44] Lambs those skins that God
[1:20:48] created came from that
[1:20:51] lamb that he had
[1:20:53] slain at the foundation of the
[1:20:56] world when his children
[1:20:59] fell he
[1:21:01] immediately went into
[1:21:03] action they might have
[1:21:06] fallen but they won't be
[1:21:09] lost they might test T they're going to
[1:21:12] taste Death In the
[1:21:14] Flesh and yet I'll give them eternal
[1:21:18] life they will still live forever
[1:21:21] because I've got a plan
[1:21:23] and part one has begun unfolding the
[1:21:26] opening of the first
[1:21:28] seal and this and this Lamb's Book of
[1:21:30] Life had seven
[1:21:32] parts to save us to change
[1:21:45] us Genesis
[1:21:48] 321 remember it's Moses that wrote the
[1:21:51] book
[1:21:54] when did he write
[1:21:55] it when it was
[1:21:57] happening he was there to see it
[1:22:01] all he was not there to see
[1:22:04] it Moses didn't wasn't born for another
[1:22:08] 1500 or 2,000 years
[1:22:12] later but he did see it he saw it by
[1:22:17] Vision just like it happened in that day
[1:22:23] verse Genesis
[1:22:26] 3:21 and unto Adam also and to his wife
[1:22:29] that the Lord God make coats of skin and
[1:22:32] clothe
[1:22:36] him did he kill a lamb for the
[1:22:40] skins or did he just create the
[1:22:43] skins and in the mind of God God's lamb
[1:22:47] had been
[1:22:48] slain and he was covering them and cover
[1:22:52] covering them was a
[1:22:54] symbol of how he would cover all his
[1:22:57] children when he covered Adam and
[1:23:00] Eve in his mind he covered you and I in
[1:23:05] his mind he was covering
[1:23:08] all that dwell under the Earth and are
[1:23:12] worshiping him this
[1:23:14] morning remember Revelations 13
[1:23:18] and8 and all that dwell upon the Earth
[1:23:21] shall worship Him
[1:23:26] the dragon the
[1:23:29] Beast Rome the great Harlot and all her
[1:23:33] Harlot
[1:23:34] daughters from the Catholic to the
[1:23:40] Pentecostal you can't be part of those
[1:23:44] systems and also be part of the mystical
[1:23:48] body of Jesus
[1:23:50] Christ it's a lie of the devil
[1:23:53] that we're all the
[1:23:55] same God's children are
[1:23:59] different God's
[1:24:00] seed is different and you are God's
[1:24:04] seed that's what has made you different
[1:24:08] all your life even when you were still
[1:24:11] living in
[1:24:12] sin you were different you didn't
[1:24:16] understand the difference the difference
[1:24:19] troubled
[1:24:20] you why can't I just be Happ happy doing
[1:24:23] all this what my friends
[1:24:26] do you you couldn't be because you were
[1:24:29] another seed your name was written in
[1:24:31] another book in the Lamb's Book of
[1:24:37] Life Revelations 6
[1:24:42] and2 and I saw and behold a white
[1:24:46] horse and he that sat on him had a
[1:24:50] bow it's a sybol
[1:24:53] symbol from the White Horse to the
[1:24:57] bow to the crown that we'll be reading
[1:25:00] of to the Conquering and going to
[1:25:04] conquer it's all
[1:25:06] symbolic it's not
[1:25:08] literal and yet the manifestation would
[1:25:12] be
[1:25:13] literal but the terms to hide and
[1:25:16] describe
[1:25:18] it are
[1:25:19] symbolic that's how God hides it
[1:25:23] in the eyes of the wise
[1:25:24] and but once he opens your eyes to
[1:25:28] it you say wow wow that's
[1:25:31] simple Revelation
[1:25:34] 62
[1:25:35] John and I John I saw this and behold a
[1:25:41] white
[1:25:44] horse and he that sat on him had a
[1:25:49] bow and a crown was given unto him
[1:25:53] he wasn't
[1:25:54] crowned a crown was simply given to
[1:25:59] him and and with this bow and with this
[1:26:04] Crown he went forth
[1:26:06] conquering and to
[1:26:09] conquer the rider wasn't
[1:26:14] crowned and the bow had no
[1:26:17] arrows and yet he was able to use
[1:26:20] this both the crown and the
[1:26:24] bow to go forth
[1:26:26] conquering and to
[1:26:29] conquer
[1:26:30] now in verse
[1:26:33] one one of the four beasts John
[1:26:36] said come and
[1:26:38] see come and see is not an
[1:26:44] exhortation come and see is not a
[1:26:51] rebuke come and see is not an
[1:26:56] admonition come and see is a
[1:27:02] teaching come and see is a
[1:27:08] teaching I
[1:27:10] tell come over here come come see what
[1:27:13] I'm going to do
[1:27:15] here in his mind he goes oh no not
[1:27:19] again but my intentions to teach himself
[1:27:23] come and see was a teaching so in this
[1:27:28] teaching of
[1:27:30] Revelations 61
[1:27:33] and2 so in this teaching is a
[1:27:36] lamb it's a symbol all are symbols
[1:27:40] representing
[1:27:42] something in this teaching is a
[1:27:45] thunder in this teaching is one of the
[1:27:48] four
[1:27:50] beasts in this
[1:27:52] teaching is a bow and no
[1:27:55] arrows and in this teaching is a crown
[1:27:59] given to him the
[1:28:02] rider so who is the
[1:28:05] Lamb what is the
[1:28:07] thunder which of the four Beast is
[1:28:11] this who who or what is the bow with no
[1:28:16] arrows because the bow is a
[1:28:18] who the bow is a what until we find out
[1:28:22] what it
[1:28:23] is but the bow is not a natural
[1:28:27] bow it is a
[1:28:31] symbol brother preached the message he
[1:28:35] called it you argue with him about it
[1:28:39] Revelations book of
[1:28:43] symbols he didn't understand all the
[1:28:45] symbols at
[1:28:47] first the Revelation started unfolding
[1:28:50] to
[1:28:51] him after he preached the
[1:28:53] seals day by day month by month the last
[1:28:58] couple of
[1:28:59] years is when the prophetic word really
[1:29:02] opened to
[1:29:04] him and open to
[1:29:07] us Bible
[1:29:09] questions have Bible
[1:29:11] answers so who is this
[1:29:14] lamb simply said it's
[1:29:18] Jesus Remember in St John chapter 1
[1:29:23] and verse
[1:29:24] 29 John the Baptist speaking here John
[1:29:28] giving us the testimony of
[1:29:31] it it says the next
[1:29:33] day John seeth Jesus coming unto
[1:29:37] him and saith Behold the Lamb of God
[1:29:43] which taketh away the sin of the
[1:29:46] world so who was this lamb that that he
[1:29:50] saw loose this this first
[1:29:52] seal it was
[1:29:55] Jesus he is the Lamb so what is this
[1:30:00] thunder in the message the first
[1:30:05] seal paragraph
[1:30:08] 263 the prophet said this we found what
[1:30:12] the thunder
[1:30:14] means we found what it meant too this
[1:30:19] morning H we found what he
[1:30:23] found whoa it must be the same one
[1:30:26] speaking this
[1:30:27] morning that spoke back in
[1:30:31] 1963 today we're catching the revelation
[1:30:34] of what's
[1:30:37] spoken and he said we found what the
[1:30:40] thunder
[1:30:41] means that's perfectly we know that
[1:30:45] see then he says the
[1:30:48] Thunder was the voice of God when the
[1:30:52] seal
[1:30:52] opened isn't that what the first verse
[1:31:00] said so William brandham wasn't
[1:31:03] inventing
[1:31:06] anything God was just opening his
[1:31:09] eyes as he's opening your
[1:31:12] eyes to see the prophetic
[1:31:15] word yes it's true he said it
[1:31:19] first but it's one thing
[1:31:22] to say I believe it because he said
[1:31:25] it it's another thing to say I see what
[1:31:29] he said is in the
[1:31:32] Bible I see what he said is in the
[1:31:40] scriptures so who was the Beast that was
[1:31:44] teaching because the lamb
[1:31:47] opened the first
[1:31:49] seal but it was this Beast
[1:31:52] that was doing the
[1:31:54] teaching so who was this beast in
[1:31:56] Revelations
[1:31:59] 61 that was doing the
[1:32:03] teaching it's a Bible
[1:32:05] question so it has a Bible
[1:32:08] answer Revelations
[1:32:11] 47 it
[1:32:13] says and the first
[1:32:16] Beast was like a
[1:32:20] lion question question
[1:32:22] ask question
[1:32:25] answer the Bible prompted the
[1:32:30] question and the Bible answered the
[1:32:33] question we just have to let our fingers
[1:32:35] do the walking through the Bible
[1:32:38] Pages and as they're walking say
[1:32:43] Lord I can walk through these Pages all
[1:32:46] day
[1:32:47] long what I need is a
[1:32:50] revelation for Upon This Rock I'll build
[1:32:54] my church I'll build you as a man I'll
[1:32:58] build you as a woman I you as children
[1:33:02] as a teenager as a young man and old man
[1:33:06] on this Ro I will build my
[1:33:12] church and the first Beast was like a
[1:33:16] lion and the second beast like a
[1:33:19] calf and the third Beast had the face as
[1:33:22] a
[1:33:23] man and the fourth Beast was like a
[1:33:25] flying
[1:33:29] eagle the
[1:33:32] bow that was
[1:33:35] given that this Rider had in his
[1:33:42] hand the bow was
[1:33:45] Israel and
[1:33:48] Israel the Jewish Church wanted
[1:33:50] something
[1:33:53] they wanted to be a
[1:33:55] bow with an
[1:33:57] arrow they were
[1:33:59] not in other words they were a powerless
[1:34:05] church and a powerless
[1:34:08] Nation held in
[1:34:16] slavery the lack of even one
[1:34:20] Arrow
[1:34:23] was
[1:34:24] symbolic of what they didn't have the
[1:34:28] power to put Jesus to death on the
[1:34:33] cross but Rome would give them that
[1:34:37] Arrow have you read the
[1:34:41] gospels have you read when Rome gave
[1:34:44] them the
[1:34:45] power
[1:34:47] unfolded David said in
[1:34:50] Prophecy concerning Jesus Christ the son
[1:34:53] of
[1:34:54] God in Psalm
[1:34:57] 64 Psalm 64 beginning at verse
[1:35:01] one it says this it's a Psalm of David
[1:35:05] because not all the Psalms were written
[1:35:07] by
[1:35:08] David it says hear my voice oh
[1:35:13] God in my prayer preserve my life from
[1:35:16] from from Fear of the
[1:35:20] enemy oh it's a beautiful
[1:35:23] prayer he says hide me from the secret
[1:35:25] Cil of the
[1:35:28] wicked from the Insurrection of the
[1:35:30] workers of
[1:35:33] iniquity who wet their tongue like a
[1:35:37] sword you see the symbolic
[1:35:40] language the Bible and bend their bows
[1:35:44] to shoot their arrows even bitter
[1:35:49] words it was the bitter word words of
[1:35:51] the of of the high
[1:35:54] priest towards Pontius
[1:35:57] pilot that would that that that that
[1:35:59] would cause him to give
[1:36:02] Israel the arrow to put Jesus to
[1:36:09] death verse four that they may shoot in
[1:36:13] secret at the
[1:36:15] perfect it was a
[1:36:18] prophecy who is the
[1:36:20] perfect
[1:36:24] who was that
[1:36:29] perfect Jesus said in Matthew
[1:36:33] 5:48 be ye therefore
[1:36:37] perfect as my Father which is in heaven
[1:36:41] perfect the
[1:36:43] King was the perfect
[1:36:46] one and they were going to
[1:36:49] shoot in
[1:36:52] Secret at this perfect
[1:36:54] one suddenly do they shoot at
[1:36:57] him and fear not the
[1:37:01] bow the church
[1:37:03] Israel the nation
[1:37:07] Rome turn with me to Psalm
[1:37:11] 78 and verse
[1:37:20] 55
[1:37:22] Psalm 78 verse
[1:37:25] 55 you say brother Daniel where do you
[1:37:28] get it from that Israel was the
[1:37:32] bow verse Psalm
[1:37:36] 7855 he cast out the Heathen also before
[1:37:40] him and divided them in inheritance by
[1:37:45] line and made the tribe of Israel to
[1:37:48] dwell in their
[1:37:50] tents
[1:37:53] in other words he blessed them verse 56
[1:37:57] says yet despite all these
[1:38:02] blessings yet they
[1:38:05] tempted and provoked the most high
[1:38:08] God and kept not his
[1:38:11] testimony but turned
[1:38:13] back and dwelt
[1:38:16] unfaithfully like their fathers they
[1:38:19] were turned aside like a deceitful
[1:38:23] bow what's a deceitful
[1:38:28] bat when a man pulls a
[1:38:32] bow and let's say he's looking at
[1:38:34] brother
[1:38:35] orley stop right with your are or I'll
[1:38:39] shoot you in the chest with this
[1:38:42] Arrow brother orley
[1:38:44] says you pulled the string
[1:38:47] back you don't have no
[1:38:49] Arrow that's dece
[1:38:52] you have a deceitful
[1:38:54] bow but turn back verse
[1:38:57] 57 and dwelt unfaithfully like their
[1:39:02] fathers they were turned
[1:39:04] aside like a
[1:39:07] deceitful
[1:39:08] Israel the bow it's in the Bible it's in
[1:39:13] the
[1:39:14] scriptures we've read it hundreds of
[1:39:17] times but now the eyes of our
[1:39:20] understanding
[1:39:22] are being open and the Bible this book
[1:39:27] has become a new book to
[1:39:29] us the
[1:39:34] crown the crown was
[1:39:38] Rome Pagan Rome the rider was not
[1:39:41] crowned at this
[1:39:44] time even brother brandom tells us
[1:39:47] so but he had a
[1:39:49] crown the the crown was
[1:39:53] Rome Pagan
[1:39:55] Rome and the bow the deceitful bow
[1:39:58] needed an
[1:40:01] arrow that only Rome could give
[1:40:04] him
[1:40:06] crown in the message the second
[1:40:10] seal paragraph
[1:40:13] 142 Prophet says this you remember the
[1:40:18] white horse rider now had no Crown when
[1:40:21] he started
[1:40:31] out uh I think that's a Spanish one you
[1:40:35] remember the white horse rider had no
[1:40:37] Crown when he started
[1:40:42] out then he he was given a
[1:40:46] crown why he was the nickan spirit to be
[1:40:50] begin
[1:40:52] with then he began then he be became
[1:40:56] incarnate in a
[1:40:59] man and then he was
[1:41:02] crowned that was in the pergamus church
[1:41:05] age that was the third Church age for
[1:41:09] this white horse
[1:41:11] rider rode through three Church
[1:41:16] ages because it's not one seal for every
[1:41:19] Church age
[1:41:23] a prophet teaches us
[1:41:25] that he and he
[1:41:28] says he was the nician spirit to begin
[1:41:32] with and then he become incarnate in a
[1:41:36] man a pope in the Nan
[1:41:40] Council about 300 years after the death
[1:41:44] of
[1:41:46] Christ then he was crowned and received
[1:41:48] the throne and was crowned
[1:41:53] that's called the the Roman Catholic
[1:41:57] church and then he then then he served
[1:42:01] that for a long
[1:42:03] time as we will
[1:42:07] see as as we will see as the seals
[1:42:12] break the
[1:42:14] revelation of the seals
[1:42:17] breaking for when he preached this in
[1:42:19] 1963
[1:42:22] all the
[1:42:23] seals all seven
[1:42:26] Parts had opened
[1:42:28] up because when Elijah's Ministry was
[1:42:33] finished John the
[1:42:35] Baptist when he finished his
[1:42:40] ministry and during his
[1:42:42] ministry the first seal had
[1:42:45] opened because the opening of the Lamb's
[1:42:48] Book of
[1:42:49] Life
[1:42:51] was the opening of the first
[1:42:53] seal part
[1:42:56] one Redemption had
[1:42:59] begun restoration had
[1:43:01] begun that's what these seven parts are
[1:43:03] all
[1:43:04] about that's what these Seven
[1:43:07] Seals are all about Israel the
[1:43:11] bow Rome the crown church and
[1:43:15] state in an invisible
[1:43:18] Union to crucify
[1:43:21] the word made
[1:43:22] flesh and it repeats
[1:43:26] again in the last age Le in the last
[1:43:31] seal the seventh Revelations 6 and verse
[1:43:35] 1 and 2
[1:43:37] again and I saw when the lamb opened one
[1:43:41] of the
[1:43:44] seals part one of the Lamb's
[1:43:48] Book and the lamb is opening his
[1:43:51] book and I heard as it were the noise of
[1:43:54] a
[1:43:57] thunder so a
[1:43:59] thunder is the voice of God when a seal
[1:44:03] is
[1:44:04] open and one of the four be
[1:44:07] say so the lamb opened the book but the
[1:44:11] first one to start speaking and
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:15] teaching was one of the four
[1:44:17] beasts we now know that that was the
[1:44:19] lion Beast
[1:44:23] and the lion said come and
[1:44:27] see who was the lion the same one who
[1:44:30] was the
[1:44:34] lamb it was another
[1:44:37] Ministry of the king lion lamb
[1:44:43] evangelist Prophet Apostle Pastor
[1:44:48] evangelist teacher the five
[1:44:51] Ministry is the ministry of the
[1:44:54] king that's what he gave to the
[1:44:57] church when he arose and went on
[1:45:00] high he never left us did
[1:45:04] he he's always been with us in some form
[1:45:08] or another he never left his children in
[1:45:12] some form he's never left
[1:45:14] you there's been ways that he touched
[1:45:17] your
[1:45:18] heart God did
[1:45:22] through some person some brother that
[1:45:26] you can
[1:45:27] remember that chased you down and
[1:45:29] wouldn't leave you
[1:45:31] alone and you said why don't this man
[1:45:34] leave me
[1:45:35] alone because it was Jesus coming after
[1:45:39] you calling you pulling you Revelation 6
[1:45:45] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:45:47] the seals and I heard as it were the
[1:45:48] noise of Thunder one of the the four
[1:45:50] Beast saying come and
[1:45:57] see and I saw him Behold a white horse
[1:46:00] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[1:46:02] crown was given unto him and he went
[1:46:04] forth conquering and to
[1:46:09] conquer we can never read it the same
[1:46:12] again for now we see
[1:46:16] it the white horse
[1:46:18] rider was Lucifer
[1:46:21] and he had
[1:46:22] both the Orthodox Jewish Church in his
[1:46:27] hand the bow and Pagan Rome in his
[1:46:31] hand the
[1:46:33] crown Lucifer had them
[1:46:37] both you say the
[1:46:40] church the biggest denomination of that
[1:46:42] day Lucifer had in his hand and it
[1:46:46] hasn't changed today he's got the church
[1:46:50] the biggest denominations in the world
[1:46:52] in his
[1:46:54] hand he's got Joe Biden in his
[1:46:57] hand he's got Putin in his
[1:47:00] hand he he had Chavez in his
[1:47:03] hand he's got Bui in his hand he's got
[1:47:07] all the leaders of the nation in his
[1:47:09] hand along with all the
[1:47:12] churches he's planning to do the same
[1:47:15] thing
[1:47:16] again he thinks he's got a greater Army
[1:47:18] to to support him now
[1:47:22] he wants to crucify the
[1:47:24] word destroy it the words is being made
[1:47:28] flesh in you and
[1:47:30] I but he can't kill a Son of
[1:47:34] God he can only send us home
[1:47:38] soon and as soon as we leave this
[1:47:42] body we're in a new
[1:47:48] body if you don't have no hair on your
[1:47:51] head as soon as you change
[1:47:54] into you say wow wow I got hair on my
[1:47:58] head you look at your
[1:48:00] hands you say those hands look
[1:48:05] young you start walking
[1:48:07] around
[1:48:09] see that whole hip replacement doesn't
[1:48:12] bother me at all no
[1:48:14] more oh
[1:48:16] Hallelujah you see what it's like when
[1:48:19] the eyes of
[1:48:22] understanding when we start seeing Jesus
[1:48:25] in the
[1:48:26] word then we start seeing Jesus in
[1:48:30] US
[1:48:33] Glory the fact that the boat had no
[1:48:37] arrows simply
[1:48:39] meant that the judeo
[1:48:41] church under the law of
[1:48:43] Moses claiming to be Abraham's
[1:48:47] children had no power
[1:48:51] to put Jesus of
[1:48:53] Nazareth to
[1:48:56] death they needed to enter into an
[1:48:58] invisible Union with
[1:49:01] Rome and
[1:49:03] Lucifer made it possible he's making it
[1:49:07] possible yet
[1:49:11] today the Orthodox
[1:49:14] Church was no longer the Church of
[1:49:17] God they were a deceitful bubble
[1:49:22] in the hands of
[1:49:35] Lucifer and I saw verse two of Psalm of
[1:49:38] Revelation
[1:49:42] 6 and I saw can Behold a white horse and
[1:49:46] he that sat on him had a
[1:49:49] bow
[1:49:53] and a crown was given unto him and with
[1:49:56] this bow and with this
[1:50:00] crown with Israel the
[1:50:03] church and Rome the Pagan
[1:50:07] Nation Lucifer went
[1:50:09] forth conquering and to
[1:50:13] conquer but who did he go to
[1:50:17] conquer the
[1:50:18] Believers the were now following
[1:50:21] Jesus that believed that he
[1:50:24] was Messiah King of the
[1:50:27] Jews those are the ones he went to
[1:50:32] conquer we no longer believe the old
[1:50:37] Dogma that this was Jesus's
[1:50:41] followers taking Kingdom by
[1:50:45] force with
[1:50:48] violence how do you follow
[1:50:51] Jesus and remain a violent
[1:50:54] man how do you follow Jesus and remain a
[1:50:58] violent
[1:50:59] woman this wasn't Jesus's
[1:51:03] followers this was Israel the church and
[1:51:07] Pagan Rome both in the hands of this
[1:51:10] white horse
[1:51:12] rider and he's rushing forward
[1:51:15] now to try to stop this move of
[1:51:18] God to put an end to this evangelist
[1:51:22] that's having great
[1:51:24] success praying for the sick and now
[1:51:27] he's begun teaching
[1:51:30] them teaching them things contrary to
[1:51:33] the
[1:51:36] law he said you have heard by them of
[1:51:41] old Thou shalt not kill but I say unto
[1:51:45] you whoa stop right
[1:51:48] there
[1:51:50] I don't want to hear no more that the
[1:51:52] crowd
[1:51:53] said I only accept what the prophet said
[1:51:58] mes and if he didn't say it that way
[1:52:02] Moses I want nothing to do for
[1:52:04] it huh they say that
[1:52:08] today oh stop I don't remember brother
[1:52:11] bam said
[1:52:12] that and I only accept and I'll stay
[1:52:16] with only what a prophet
[1:52:18] say is made that
[1:52:21] statement and it cost
[1:52:27] them it cost
[1:52:30] them they were thrown into tribulation
[1:52:33] after
[1:52:35] tribulation seven Church ages that were
[1:52:37] scattered the
[1:52:43] world because a greater than Moses had
[1:52:48] come to to give to give them the
[1:52:54] revelation of the
[1:52:56] proverb Thou shalt not kill to give them
[1:52:59] the
[1:53:00] revelation of the proverb Thou shalt not
[1:53:03] commit
[1:53:04] adultery to give them the
[1:53:07] revelation of all of those Proverbs
[1:53:10] that's what Ten Commandments
[1:53:13] were Proverbs that would be changed for
[1:53:17] a better
[1:53:18] Covenant
[1:53:21] Proverbs of whom of which you would be
[1:53:23] given the
[1:53:25] revelation of a life that you could live
[1:53:29] that would make you worthy of the
[1:53:32] Gospel found in the Lamb's Book of
[1:53:38] Life and in the word
[1:53:43] here and I saw and behold a white horse
[1:53:48] rider and he that sat on him had a
[1:53:52] bow and a crown was given unto
[1:53:55] him the word and connects the bow and
[1:53:59] the
[1:54:00] crown and this riter with this bow and
[1:54:04] this Crown
[1:54:05] connected he went forth conquering and
[1:54:07] to
[1:54:09] conquer so the word
[1:54:11] and is the
[1:54:14] merger and it's the
[1:54:17] union of church and state
[1:54:20] Jewish church and Pagan Rome and he
[1:54:26] Lucifer the white horse
[1:54:28] rider used them
[1:54:30] both to crucify
[1:54:33] him
[1:54:34] Jesus king of the
[1:54:36] Jews and when he merged them
[1:54:41] together and when he merged them
[1:54:44] together church and state then he used
[1:54:48] them and went out conquering and to
[1:54:52] conquer the
[1:54:54] Disciples of John and of
[1:54:58] Jesus the kingdom of God suffereth
[1:55:05] violence and in the days of the first
[1:55:08] Elijah John the Baptist the bow and the
[1:55:13] crown were already
[1:55:16] persecuting the mystical body of Jesus
[1:55:19] Christ
[1:55:20] the bow was the Orthodox
[1:55:23] Church under the law of Moses and the
[1:55:26] crown was Pagan
[1:55:28] Rome and anointed of
[1:55:31] Lucifer they had already begun their
[1:55:34] rid in the Days of Elijah you know
[1:55:37] that's what how it's
[1:55:39] written they had already begun their
[1:55:42] ride Days of
[1:55:44] Elijah when the first seal
[1:55:48] open when the the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:55:50] part one was released to the
[1:55:56] world it's a Plan of
[1:55:58] Salvation it still is today it's a plan
[1:56:02] of
[1:56:03] change it still is
[1:56:05] today it's a plan for his children to be
[1:56:10] reunited with the father it's a plan for
[1:56:13] the
[1:56:13] bride to be caught away to the wedding
[1:56:17] suppers of the Lamb
[1:56:20] husband and wife together again like it
[1:56:23] was in Eden before the
[1:56:28] fall both the bow and the
[1:56:32] crown were Violent
[1:56:35] Men the judeo
[1:56:38] church the
[1:56:41] hierarchy from the high
[1:56:43] priest to the lowliest
[1:56:46] levite were men of violence
[1:56:54] you say the
[1:56:56] church make one
[1:56:59] mistake break one of their
[1:57:02] traditions and most of the time the
[1:57:05] sentence
[1:57:07] was Stone him to
[1:57:11] death so both the ball and the crown
[1:57:14] were Violent
[1:57:16] Men and they brought violence to the
[1:57:19] king of
[1:57:20] Heaven even in the days of the first
[1:57:23] Elijah
[1:57:24] John and thus it had
[1:57:27] begun a Plan of Redemption for the Fig
[1:57:31] Tree and the bride
[1:57:33] tree the first shield was
[1:57:36] loosed the book that was closed now
[1:57:39] open in the days of John the Baptist in
[1:57:43] the days of Jesus in the days of this
[1:57:45] Lamb of God the lamb opened it
[1:57:50] the lamb Ministry opened
[1:57:52] it the lion
[1:57:55] Ministry at the opening of the first
[1:57:57] SE began revealing it began teaching
[1:58:03] it Redemption had
[1:58:06] begun and the price that had been paid
[1:58:10] before before the foundation of the
[1:58:13] world was now to be manifested on
[1:58:16] earth as the lion Ministry
[1:58:20] would be paused for a moment so the lamb
[1:58:24] Ministry could do its part salvation for
[1:58:27] all
[1:58:29] people and when and when salvation for
[1:58:31] the Bride of Jesus
[1:58:34] Christ when the last member of this
[1:58:36] mystical
[1:58:38] body is
[1:58:40] raptured then the king comes down
[1:58:43] again Lion of the tribe of Judah King of
[1:58:47] the
[1:58:48] Jews and once again he takes the same
[1:58:53] message to Israel again to
[1:58:58] 144,000 he won't let his word return
[1:59:02] voy he will bring
[1:59:05] Salvation to
[1:59:07] Israel to his chosen
[1:59:10] people not every
[1:59:12] Israelite is chosen not every
[1:59:16] Jew is part of that remnant
[1:59:20] just like not every
[1:59:21] Gentile is the seat of
[1:59:27] God we've been
[1:59:29] chosen we were in the mind of God before
[1:59:31] the foundation of
[1:59:34] world and it's for you he died for his
[1:59:37] family his children for his daughter for
[1:59:40] his
[1:59:46] son Revelation 62 apocalypsis says
[1:59:49] and I saw him Behold a white
[1:59:53] horse and he that sat on him had a
[1:59:56] bow so now we
[1:59:59] realize not everything white in
[2:00:04] scriptures means it's
[2:00:06] God sometimes it's the Devil
[2:00:10] Himself and I saw and behold a white
[2:00:13] horse and he that sat on him had a
[2:00:16] bow and a crown was given unto to
[2:00:19] him and he went forth conquering to
[2:00:23] conquer so what also had begun
[2:00:27] here was a time of great
[2:00:30] violence that's what conquering
[2:00:33] means when Rome conquered the
[2:00:36] world it was great violence for the
[2:00:39] world when the Ottoman Empire conquered
[2:00:46] Rome it was great violence for the the
[2:00:50] people so this one comes and he went
[2:00:52] forth conquering to
[2:00:55] conquer so it began in the days of John
[2:00:58] the
[2:00:59] Baptist for the children of God and for
[2:01:02] the people of the
[2:01:04] world time of great
[2:01:06] violence a time of
[2:01:09] vandalism a time of
[2:01:11] looting a time of
[2:01:14] persecution a time of of
[2:01:18] censorship a time of
[2:01:20] boycotts against a New Testament
[2:01:23] Church rising
[2:01:26] up in the days of
[2:01:29] Jesus this is all happening today in our
[2:01:33] day you know why because the pale horse
[2:01:37] rider he wants you off the
[2:01:40] scene you make him
[2:01:43] nervous he's afraid you won't stop
[2:01:45] witnessing and bring in another son and
[2:01:47] daughter of God
[2:01:50] [Music]
[2:01:52] he's afraid that our
[2:01:55] testimony will break the shackles that's
[2:01:57] holding someone he's got a hold
[2:02:01] of he's acting with all his
[2:02:04] violence because he's more scared of you
[2:02:08] than you think he is because we're Sons
[2:02:11] and Daughters of God and we don't fear
[2:02:17] Him
[2:02:20] this was the
[2:02:21] opening this day of the loosing of the
[2:02:24] first
[2:02:26] seal part one of seven
[2:02:29] parts to save you baptize you fill you
[2:02:34] and refill
[2:02:35] you make you perfect even as my Father
[2:02:39] which is in heaven is
[2:02:42] perfect
[2:02:44] God rich in
[2:02:46] Mercy in closing turn
[2:02:49] to Matthew
[2:02:58] 11 Matthew 11 and verse
[2:03:02] 1 and it came to pass when Jesus had
[2:03:06] made an
[2:03:07] end of commanding his 12
[2:03:14] disciples of setting his church in
[2:03:17] order remember the unfolding of his
[2:03:21] ministry how did he get here he began as
[2:03:24] an
[2:03:26] evangelist and it goes
[2:03:29] unfolding evangelist a teacher in
[2:03:32] Matthew 56
[2:03:34] and7 a
[2:03:37] prophet in Matthew
[2:03:39] 9 he said to a man sick of the
[2:03:45] py
[2:03:47] shaking he'd been AF afflicted for
[2:03:50] years he said my son go in good
[2:03:55] cheer thy sins are all
[2:03:59] forgiven he didn't do that to make the
[2:04:02] scribes
[2:04:06] angry he did that to show us who he
[2:04:10] was for who can forgive
[2:04:13] sins but the Lamb of
[2:04:17] God go God in that
[2:04:20] Ministry God in that
[2:04:22] attribute God in that body he shed his
[2:04:26] blood he's washed you and I with the
[2:04:29] blood of the
[2:04:30] lamb and our sins which are many all
[2:04:36] forgiven
[2:04:41] Hallelujah Matthew
[2:04:44] 111 Jesus teaching
[2:04:47] them that the first seal has
[2:04:50] opened and he'll even tell us when it
[2:04:53] will and it came to
[2:04:55] pass when Jesus made an end of
[2:04:58] commanding his 12
[2:05:00] disciples he departed then to
[2:05:03] teach and to preach in their
[2:05:06] cities what was the opening of the first
[2:05:09] seal come and see a teaching it had
[2:05:13] begun the Revelation had
[2:05:16] begun the actual opening of the seal
[2:05:20] began with the ministry of John the
[2:05:23] Baptist so by the time Jesus teaches on
[2:05:27] it it had been open for a while
[2:05:31] already just like by the time the Holy
[2:05:34] Spirit speaks to us of the opening of
[2:05:36] The Seven
[2:05:40] Seals in
[2:05:42] 1963 they' already been open for a
[2:05:45] while you see the pattern of his word
[2:05:49] a
[2:05:50] teaching now when John had heard in the
[2:05:52] prison The Works of Christ he sent his
[2:05:55] two
[2:05:59] disciples Elijah is about to leave this
[2:06:03] world in a terrible car
[2:06:06] accident but his ministry is
[2:06:09] over it's
[2:06:13] done you well what was going to
[2:06:16] follow what do we do without John the
[2:06:18] Baptist
[2:06:19] who's to come
[2:06:21] after Jesus the lamb The Lion The
[2:06:30] Savior verse
[2:06:32] three and said unto him art thou he that
[2:06:35] should come now when John had heard
[2:06:38] verse two in prison the works of Christ
[2:06:40] he sent two of his
[2:06:46] disciples John was struggling
[2:06:49] he had great complexes of
[2:06:52] rejection he's sitting in
[2:06:56] prison wonder if I made a
[2:06:59] mistake you know people are saying you
[2:07:01] you only said that John cuz he's your
[2:07:06] cousin we see how you two cousins are
[2:07:08] trying to get together on this
[2:07:12] thought and he's laying in prison he
[2:07:17] said is said him is it not
[2:07:21] him we didn't really grow up
[2:07:24] together I don't really know him that
[2:07:27] well I don't even know why that day I
[2:07:29] said Behold the Lamb of God it just came
[2:07:32] out of my
[2:07:35] mouth Lord was that you speaking through
[2:07:40] me he's thinking all these thoughts as
[2:07:43] he's waiting to be
[2:07:45] beheaded so he sends two of his
[2:07:47] disciples
[2:07:50] and they say art thou that are he that
[2:07:52] should come or do we look for
[2:07:56] another Jesus answered and said unto
[2:08:00] them I want you to stay in the
[2:08:03] meeting I want you to listen to The
[2:08:05] Gospel
[2:08:07] preached then go back and tell
[2:08:12] John as Witnesses of what your eyes have
[2:08:15] SE Jesus answered and said unto him
[2:08:17] verse four go and show John again those
[2:08:19] things which you do hear and
[2:08:25] see in this teaching that I'm
[2:08:28] bringing the blind receive their
[2:08:31] sight the lame walk the lepers are
[2:08:35] cleansed and the deaf here the dead are
[2:08:39] raised
[2:08:39] up and the poor all of these poor have
[2:08:45] the gospel preached to
[2:08:47] them because one day the blind that
[2:08:52] see will pass
[2:08:54] away one day the lame that
[2:08:57] walked will pass away one day the lepers
[2:09:01] that were
[2:09:02] cleansed will pass away one day the deaf
[2:09:06] that
[2:09:07] hear will pass away one day the dead
[2:09:11] that were raised
[2:09:13] up will die
[2:09:16] again but the poor
[2:09:18] to whom the gospel is
[2:09:21] preached they will never die this is a
[2:09:25] life this word is the resurrection to
[2:09:29] your this is what will raise you up
[2:09:35] again and blessed is
[2:09:37] he
[2:09:39] whosoever shall not be offended in
[2:09:42] me between verse 5 and
[2:09:45] six Jesus discerns the the people that
[2:09:49] are
[2:09:50] listening and he said whoa there's a lot
[2:09:53] of people resenting what I just
[2:09:56] said that's almost the majority of
[2:09:59] thisd he discerned their hearts he
[2:10:02] caught their
[2:10:04] thoughts and he didn't speak to the ones
[2:10:07] that were
[2:10:09] offended instead he gave a
[2:10:12] blessing to that little flock in the
[2:10:15] midst of these
[2:10:16] thousands he said blessed is
[2:10:19] he
[2:10:20] whosoever shall not be offended in
[2:10:24] me and those that were not
[2:10:28] offended they said thank you Jesus that
[2:10:31] helps me because your word don't offend
[2:10:34] me oh must be something deep within
[2:10:38] me there must be something within me
[2:10:40] that's been holding the
[2:10:43] rain and keeping me loving you serving
[2:10:48] you
[2:10:49] standing back up when I
[2:10:52] fall oh it's had to be you all the
[2:10:59] time and as they
[2:11:01] Departed the offended ones Jesus began
[2:11:05] to say unto the
[2:11:07] multitudes John he's
[2:11:10] teaching us how the first seal
[2:11:13] open it's a pattern and since they be
[2:11:17] parted Jesus began to say unto the
[2:11:19] multitudes concerning John what went ye
[2:11:21] out unto the Wilderness to
[2:11:27] see regardless if it's the Wilderness of
[2:11:31] Judea or the Wilderness of
[2:11:35] Kentucky what went ye out to
[2:11:37] see a re shaken with the
[2:11:41] wind but what went you out to
[2:11:43] see a man clothed in soft
[2:11:47] rment like
[2:11:50] some pink velvet
[2:11:55] coat behold they that wear soft clothing
[2:11:59] are in King's
[2:12:02] houses and you know what Kings have done
[2:12:05] to their
[2:12:07] people but what when you out to see a
[2:12:11] prophet yay and I say unto you and more
[2:12:14] than a
[2:12:16] prophet for this is he of whom Whom It
[2:12:18] is
[2:12:19] written behold I send my messenger
[2:12:22] before thy
[2:12:24] face he's quoting now the words of
[2:12:26] Malachi
[2:12:28] 3 which shall prepare the way before
[2:12:32] thee then he says verely I say unto
[2:12:35] you among them that are born of
[2:12:38] women there has not risen a greater than
[2:12:42] John the
[2:12:44] Baptist not withstanding he that is
[2:12:48] least in the Kingdom of
[2:12:49] Heaven is greater than
[2:12:52] he for John was
[2:12:55] sent to serve God's people and not be a
[2:12:58] lord over
[2:12:59] them and from the days of John the
[2:13:03] Baptist until
[2:13:05] now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth
[2:13:09] violence and the violent take it by
[2:13:13] force what was Jesus teaching Us in the
[2:13:16] days of John the Baptist
[2:13:18] the first seal
[2:13:20] open the white horse rider who came out
[2:13:22] conquering to
[2:13:25] conquer it began in the ministry of John
[2:13:29] began in the ministry of
[2:13:31] Elijah the opening of the first
[2:13:34] seal then what would the opening of the
[2:13:38] seventh seal
[2:13:40] be when would it have
[2:13:42] begun could it be that the seventh
[2:13:46] seal open happened in the Days of Elijah
[2:13:53] also like the first seal had opened in
[2:13:56] the Days of
[2:13:58] Elijah could the pattern carry over to
[2:14:01] the second coming
[2:14:05] also I think
[2:14:06] so because the scripture we
[2:14:09] read Hebrews
[2:14:11] 138 Jesus Christ is the same as the
[2:14:15] opening of the first seal
[2:14:18] as he is at the opening of the
[2:14:22] seven and from the days of John the
[2:14:25] Baptist Elijah until now the Kingdom of
[2:14:31] Heaven suffereth violence and the
[2:14:37] violent and the white horse
[2:14:40] rider had a bow and a crown and he went
[2:14:45] forth
[2:14:46] conquering
[2:14:49] causing violence and with
[2:14:52] violence trying to take the children of
[2:14:55] God by
[2:14:57] force and they
[2:14:59] did they killed them they murdered them
[2:15:03] they put them in Roman
[2:15:05] prisons they scattered them till there
[2:15:08] wasn't one of them left in
[2:15:12] Jerusalem
[2:15:14] Lucifer lucif and the first seal opened
[2:15:18] in the days of this
[2:15:20] Elijah at the first coming of Christ
[2:15:23] just like the seventh seal
[2:15:25] open in the Days of Elijah the second
[2:15:28] coming of Christ because he's the same
[2:15:32] yesterday today and
[2:15:34] forever but verse 12 and 13 brother
[2:15:37] Daniel doesn't say he was
[2:15:41] Elijah verse
[2:15:43] 14 so when you ask the
[2:15:46] question don't say I don't know no say
[2:15:49] you need to keep
[2:15:50] reading verse 14 says and if you'll
[2:15:54] receive
[2:15:55] it this is
[2:15:57] Elijah which was to come in Malachi
[2:16:01] 4 6 this is the Elijah that would turn
[2:16:06] the hearts of the
[2:16:08] fathers to the
[2:16:10] children
[2:16:12] comma then 2,000 years would
[2:16:15] pass and at the second coming Elijah
[2:16:17] would be
[2:16:19] again and he would turn the
[2:16:21] hearts children back to the Pentecostal
[2:16:26] [Music]
[2:16:28] father he that has ears to
[2:16:32] hear let him
[2:16:34] here as we stand to our
[2:16:43] feet the pattern of God's

[2:17:10] in we pray that Revelation would strike
[2:17:13] their
[2:17:14] hearts that they could see that there's
[2:17:16] no mediator between God and
[2:17:20] man except the
[2:17:22] man Christ
[2:17:24] Jesus the only
[2:17:26] one our Lord Our Savior our
[2:17:31] baptizer the Lamb with a plan to restore
[2:17:36] us change us save us bring us unto the
