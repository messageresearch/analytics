they've been watching the services for some time now they they are faithful Believers and and part of this assembly now so have you ever passing through Tucson and want to V visit a a fellow brother and sister of the same assembly uh brother brother Tony and Sister Mary will also be visiting our uh my sister Ruth who has been enjoying the the services and the streaming and if there's anybody else uh that's listening on we hope hopefully we we hope very much it's been a blessing for all we were we were speaking it's part 11 now of uh the same theme that we've been teaching on part 11 of Jesus evangelist prophet and Lamb of God we left off about Matthew [Music] 11:2 and uh it was Jesus telling us when the first seal opened part one of seven Parts had begun and and and the Seven seal had opened and the first seal opened in the days of John the Baptist it's what Jesus taught and who was John the Baptist he was Elijah of Malachi 46 he he was the first Elijah at the first coming of Christ you remember the prophecy there in Malachi of course go Jesus also identified him in Malachi 3 in Isaiah 40 so the ministry of John the Baptist Baptist was spoken in several places in the Old Testament but he was also the first Elijah of the first coming of Christ where the Bible says behold I'll send you Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord and he'll turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and there's a comma and then it says and the hearts of the of the of of the children back to the fathers so the K repres separated the first coming of Christ and the second coming of Christ in the same sentence both first and second coming coming was spoken of the first part was fulfilled by John and and and and the one and and the one that identified John not only Jesus but it was Gabriel the Angel when he went to Zariah his father as as as he was praying in the temple he was offering up incense of prayers before for the people and an angel appears unto him and he tells him I am Gabriel I come from the very presence of God here to tell you that your son is going to have a special Ministry he's going to introduce Messiah he's going to introduce the Lamb of God he's going to introduce the king of the Jews to Israel and Gabriel said he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and he stopped right there in the middle of the verse and he didn't he didn't quote the other part because the second part was for the second coming and John was not that Elijah to the second coming John was the Elijah to the first coming so if you turn with me to Matthew Matthew 11 and verse 12 this is Jesus in the lamb Ministry because he's is the only one that can open the book and reveal it and that's exactly what he was doing in Matthew 11 it was a teaching now he was teaching on the first coming of Christ he was teaching on this coming and he was telling them it's I am this Lamb of God John is this the Elijah min Min and the violence that you're seeing and the violence they're doing against the Believers the violence against John's believer John's followers and the violence against those who are following [Music] Jesus Jesus identifies it and it's the beginning of the ride of the white horse rider Lucifer luf he is the violent one he is a murderer and a liar from the beginning he's the murderer and liar from from the beginning so his children have those same characteristics they also are violent they also are liars they're also immoral so be we be read Matthew 11:1 12 and it says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffer violence and the violent take it by force turn with me now to Revelations chapter 6 verse 1 and two he says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and if we and as we've shared with you what the Bible is saying that is that the noise of Thunder represents the opening of one of the seals by the Lamb of God because this seven sealed book this is the Lamb's Book of Life this seven sealed book that's the Lamb's Book of Life is another book called the New Testament because the New Testament begins in Matthew 1:1 and this is the generation of Jesus Christ it's the Lamb's Book we've had it in our hands all the time but the eyes of our understanding hadn't come open we didn't know what we had we didn't know how close he's always been to us we know now that's why it's made us grateful that's why it's made us Kinder that's why it makes us more honest that's why we can share the love of God one with [Music] another and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and and one of the four be saying come and see and we realize that that fourth be that one of the four Beast that was talking about was the lion for he's the first of these four living creatures and we found that in Revelations chapter 4 in verse two and I saw and behold a white horse a power a power and he that sat on him had a bow we realized that this bow he had and he had no arrows and this bow was Israel the church a denomination in that day that wanted to put Jesus to death but they had no Arrow no power they were a deceitful bow they were a deceitful bow we found it in the psalm where that's what Israel was called a a a and they contined to be a deceitful bow and then it says and a crown was given unto him and a crown was given unto him and and the crown was Pagan Rome and Lucifer held in his hands the denominations of that day and the Nations and leaders of nations of that [Music] day and they fought and hated each other but they were both in the hands of Lucifer and Lucifer knows how to how to make enemies work together Lu to crucify Christ the word and Lucifer still has the churches and the Nations and leaders in his hands and they still hate each other and he's still going to cause them to crucify the word again and a prophet preached the message I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you ask your blessings on this word in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated and it says and he went forth conquering and to conquer in Matthew 11 again and verse 12 and from the days of John the Baptist until now Jesus speaking and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force do you see the similarity and he that went out conquering and to conquer Jesus said in the days of John the Baptist he's telling us that it's in the days of this first Elijah that the white horse rider began his ride to to to conquer through violence the church the mystical body those who were catching a re end time revelation of this end time recognizing their day and their message that's what was taking place here in Matthew 11 and and and Jesus the Holy Spirit was revealing the day and the message the Forerunner Elijah and his own Ministry for John had identified Jesus already and to his followers and to the world in that day he said Behold the Lamb of God now Jesus was identifying John and the masses were saying these two two cousins they sure know how to fix themselves up nice don't they one says he's Elijah the other one Pats his back and says he's the Christ that's what the Pharisees were saying that's what the doctors of divinity were saying that's what the denominations were saying but the but but it was true it was true this was the first coming of Christ and when the Holy Spirit went forth teaching as Lion of the tribe of Judah teaching Israel giving the firstborn giving given to the firstborn the oldest church the the king of the Jews opened up the the the Lamb's Book of Life and Loos the seals and the Plan of Redemption to Israel and that's what Israel was being judged for for rejecting salvation for rejecting Redemption for rejecting the Lamb of God they offered Lambs literally but they could never see the Revelation that what they were doing in the literal was only a shadow of a reality that was coming one day and when that day came they couldn't set they couldn't let go of the Shadow to grab a hold of the real lamb and and and of a truth you can't hold the shadow so they had nothing but when he the real lamb came and he offered to them a reality a god with skin on a god with skin they said no we'll keep trying to hold the shadow but the shadow meant nothing to them anymore it became a business for the businessmen they saw a way to make money with the law of Moses and they did and when Jesus came in the Bible says he took a whip and he started whipping and he turned over the tables of the money changers and coins and and money went all over the floor he probably started opening up cages and letting the Lambs run out he was fulfilling a prophecy and while he did it he said he said my house is a House of Prayer but you've turned it into a den of Thieves So what had been what was the anointing now on this Jewish religion Lucifer Lucifer had the bow in his hand but they had no Arrow they were wishing him dead they were wishing they could crucify him right then but Rome wouldn't allow it Rome didn't allow anyone to to to to display the this violence of a of of of of of a public destruction of someone on the cross they alone reserved that violence for themselves so here the Bible it says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven is being conquered and is and and the White Horse riter is Conquering the Believers of John and Jesus and because of his ride the Kingdom of Heaven is suffering violence and these violent ones are taking them by force they're killing them they're putting them in prison they they're breaking up families this was not the Disciples of John turn with me to Luke chapter 3 and verse 14 Luke 3 and verse1 14 listen to the teachings of John he was baptizing on the River Jordan and many were coming to him many were believing many were repenting they seen that John was a prophet and even soldiers came to him Roman soldiers and they said and the soldiers likewise demanded him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages and the soldiers who had repented said we'll have to get another job because this job is all about violence they said I quit I ain't doing this no more I quit I'm I'm leaving this job I won't be a soldier to war why cuz they had repented and they asked for Holy Ghost advice because they asked Holy Ghost advice what will we do as soldiers and he said unto them do violence to no man so this is not the Disciples of of John that were bringing forth this violence but what of the Disciples of Jesus for the Ministries had overlapped of the of the Forerunner and and Messiah the Lamb of God turn with me to Isaiah 53 and verse 9 Isaiah 53 is also the opening of the first seal you remember the first verse in Isaiah 53 who has believed our report in other words we're bringing you a message who's believed this message we're bringing and to whom is the arm of the Lord reveal revealed so what is Isaiah 53 about prophecy of a message coming that can only be received by Revelation you see Isaiah 53 it starts with Jesus as a 12-year-old boy because at 12 years old a young boy in Israel was now considered a son of the Torah that means you're an adult that means you you you that means you can you're are held liable for everything you say and do now that means you're not a child no more and at 12 years old Jesus rises up goes into the temple in Jerusalem and begins to discuss the Deep things of God that not even the rabbis knew or understood that was Isaiah 53 and 1 there it was opening up in reality no more a prophecy but Isaiah 53 becoming history now that was the day that was the time that this that this scripture began to unfold that became flesh now Isaiah 539 so Isaiah 53 is Jesus from a 12year old boy all the way to his death on the cross and it says and he made his grave with the wicked and and with the rich in his death now in in English it it reads a little different than Spanish because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him to put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin for he shall seek his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper his hand Isaiah 53 and he made verse n and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth if Jesus does no violence if there's no deceit in his mouth his children will do no violence and there'll be no in their mouths or Hearts so who is it doing the violence in the Days of Elijah John the Baptist it's the bow and the crown who are in the hands of the white horse [Music] rider Lucifer they have not merged yet Rome and the church but Satan controls them both controls who in the days of Jesus here the Jewish Orthodox Church its high priest and and and levitical Priests and Pagan Rome with its Caesar and all its officers all its congressmen all its senators all the governors of States all the mayors of the Cities the white horse rider the white horse rider that Jesus spoke to in in Matthew four on Mount Temptation here he is now bringing forth violence and the kingdom of God was suffering violence do you see Jesus in Matthew 11 was declaring the first seal is open part one has begun of a seven-part plan to save you to save you to change you to mold you into His Image to give you now the power of a born again experience to give you a relationship with the father Pilot's judgment Hall St John 19 and verse [Music] 11 this is judgment's pilot Hall Pilot's judgment Hall where Jesus was questioned St John 19 verse 11 questioned and mocked for four days and it says in verse 11 Jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except that were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin and from then forth pilate sought to release him but the Jews cried out saying if thou let if thou let this man go thou are not Caesar's friend they were using political statements in order to for Force pilate to give him that arrow and whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar this is the church using this language for violence when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the Judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the Hebrew Gaba and it was the preparation of the Passover and this Lamb of God had been was being prepared was being interrogated was being checked to see if there's any flaw in him oh what perfect timing God has that it was in the Passover time in the preparation time where God had prepared a lamb for his children it says and about the six hour he saith unto the Jews behold your king verse 14 but they cried out anyway with him away with him away with him crucify him pilate saith unto them shall I crucify your king listen to the statement of the high priest of Israel and the chief priest answered we have no King but Caesar not Jehovah not Elohim not not MDC who met with Abraham we have no King but Caesar he sold out the Jewish Nation he rejected Jehovah made flesh in their midst he denounced Jehovah the God of Israel had once again been forsaken for a heathen God they had forsaken him for a heathen God there it is an invisible Union and by the mouth of the high priest both church and state came together they United they did they didn't like being [Music] united but it was Lucifer who was anointing them both for this invisible Union to crucify Jesus their King the bow had no arrows to crucify Jesus but in a union in a merger with the crown Pagan Rome Rome became Israel's Arrow Roma and he Lucifer had used them both and together they crucified the Son of God King of the Jews Jesus of Nazareth and it was the Passover time and Jesus stood before the court of pilate four days you know in the Old Testament during the time of Passover they would gather all these Lambs together for the Passover and within 4 days a high priest and his sons had to find one perfect lamb that would be offered up for the sins of the nation my goodness and Jesus and Jesus four days interrogated by Pilot and by the Jewish church and they found no fault in him pilate himself after they screamed and screamed crucify him he says I want you to know after four days interrogating this man I find no fault in him he prophesied for a moment this Pagan ruler was anointed of God to prophesy and declare a truth this is the Lamb of God he will die this day but he is the perfect sacrifice there is no fault in him he was he had a birth an Immaculate birth he was our near [Music] Kinsman but there was no flaw in him for the blood that was shed had nothing to do with Mary nothing to do with Joseph this was a spotless lamb it couldn't have been mixed with any part of Joseph or any part of Mary for then it would have been spotted because then one of the parents would have been a flawed human being born in sin under the curse that were all born born in sin but the Bible says it was an Immaculate birth a prophet said Mary was only an incubator there wasn't drop of blood that flowed the Catholic Doctrine is [Music] this that that that they have found the blood of Jesus in Jerusalem underneath some caves underneath the Crucifixion site and the way they know it's the blood of Jesus dripped through the rocks and fell down into these caves is that when they tested it in a laboratory it only had 23 chromosomes of the mother and they claim they claim that's the blood of Jesus if that's the blood of Jesus then Jesus was not the Lamb of God for he is flawed because he is because he is stained and he's stained with the curse that he was born through a sexual birth and if Mary was biologically the mother then the Catholics say that's why she is the mother of God but if she's the mother of God then her son is not the Lamb of God cuz he's flawed he's he's stained you see where they went why I know I'm criticized for it when I say the spoken word seed that God created both ovam and sperm had nothing to do with Mary and Joseph and as a prophet told us over and over she was just an incubator like you would take a chicken egg that's already fertilized and they place it in an incubator what does the incubator do just keeps it warm but the incubator provided nothing it was already a complete fertilized egg and in this case spoken word Original Seed created a perfect lamb without spot without wrinkle that the father would accept to intercede for you and I and the blood of this spotless lamb would wash us white as snow even in in this body it washes as white as snow and when the father looks down and sees you through the blood of this lamb he's pleased to say you're just perfect you're sinless under the blood of Jesus what does that do for us it it gives us a space of time to repent and be baptize in the name of Jesus and be born again and receive refilling after refilling through hard trials he places us to because he because he is shaping Us in the stature of a perfect man it's through this innocent sacrifice that that pilate said I find no fault in him after four days I find no fault in this man he paid a price we owed a price we could not pay he paid a price he did not owe we needed this Jesus to wash our sins away Matthew 11:13 it says for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John this is Jesus speaking you can believe what Jesus says and then he says if you'll receive it this is Elias which was for to come now people say verse 13 proves that there will be no more [Music] prophets verse 13 the words of Jesus proves no more prophets for it says for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John but that's not what the scripture is saying Jesus said all the prophets and the law so all the prophets that were back under the law all and all the prophets and the law prophesied until John but if you'll receive it this is Elijah the prophet which was to come so the prophetic Ministry continues so what changed their message of the prophets now was no longer an an Old Testament message it was no longer the law of Moses now the prophetic Ministry had changed and they would preach the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand they would preach Behold the Lamb of God is here they would say it's Jesus of Naz he said he that have ears to hear Let Him hear brother says in the message the fifth seal fifth seal now in biblical terms these beasts are power he's speaking of this of the beast in Revelations he said I want you to notice the devil he had his four changing colored beasts that went forth he said that was all three of them was put into it was put into the color of one and that made a Pale Horse a white horse a red horse a black horse a Pale Horse and we've seen each one of those was a stage of his ministry a stage of the early church that had formed into a denomination at NAA Rome the original Pentecostal Church the original Pentecostal Church Upon whom the Holy Ghost was poured out took up an antichrist spirit and formed an organization gave birth to some Daughters of organization gave birth changing his power three times and put them in one and made a pale horse and then given a name called death and and and rode him into eternity in other words rode all the way to the end this Pale Horse so if the white horse rider so if the white horse rider Inon began in the Days of Elijah when did the palale horse rider begin his days in the Days of Elijah one is first coming one is the first coming un and one is the second coming white horse rider Lucifer began Jesus said in the days of John the Baptist who was Elijah the pattern of his word it will never be broken people might disbelieve it but they'll just miss a Rapture they'll just fail to be born again they just won't be changed so at the first coming if the if the first seal opened and the white horse rider was loosed in the days of John the Baptist now we know when the pale horse rider began his ride because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever unchanging in all his ways that's how we know the second coming has begun because Elijah came on the scene 1909 and the pale horse rider began his ride in the Days of Elijah and in 1914 what did this Pale Horse riter Called Death what did he do World War I began the first world war ever where this pale horse rider showed his first move and put the whole world fighting and killing and once again the kingdom of heaven was suffering violence and the violent were taking it by force and the Catholic Church entered into an invisible Union with Hitler with Germany with Nazis the pattern repeats where are we today we're in a time of preparation as individuals not as some denomination not as a group the preparation for your Passover is an is a personal relationship with the father for by one Spirit are you baptized into this one body of the Lamb of God that's made a way for you for your family children your husband for your wife in Matthew 11:16 Jesus said he had preached to them he was Messiah remember his disciples came to ask him the Disciples of John they came to ask Jesus you've probably heard John's in prison Herod has placed him in prison and they're going to be cutting his head off who was going to cut his head off Rome what was John suffering violence and who was causing the violence the crown and the bow and then Jesus says but where unto shall I liken this generation who has rejected the opening of the first seal who refu who refuses to see the Elijah Ministry that has introduced me the Lamb of God to you the people of Israel so now what but where unto shall I liken this generation that has rejected me that that's rejected the opening of the Lamb's Book of Life because the Lamb's Book of Life is is a book of life and the Old Testament was a book of death you say a book of death isn't wasn't that the penalty for almost everything they did Death you have a rebellious son bring him to the elders what do you do with him then we're going to Stone him and you the father will throw the first stone but this was the Lamb's Book of Life that Jesus had given to Israel the first born son but the firstborn rejected the firstborn rejected This Book of Life remember Joseph Crossing his hands it represented that at the cross of Jesus on that crucifixion day The Inheritance that belonged to Israel that the inheritance L belonged to is would be given to a gentile people that's what those two boys represented Joseph two sons the oldest [Music] church and the younger church right now and this Lamb's Book of Life would be given to the younger [Music] Church the bride of Christ on the day of Pentecost and Jesus as he's speaking and teaching this he says but where unto shall I liken this [Music] generation it's like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have more done to you and you have not lamented we're doing certain things and you're not responding the way you should respond to us what in the world makes you tick why are you so different than the rest of us then he says for John let me catch that part for John came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a devil and the same people people and the same church say the son of man came eating and drinking and they say Behold a man gluttonous and a wine beber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is Justified of her children the world will never accept you the world will always accuse you those who are religious and have not been born again you can't do anything to make them feel good about you because you've been born again of the Holy Spirit and there's another Spirit on them a spirit that would cause violence you see the difference in verse 20 then began he to upgrade the cities or scold them reprimand them then began he to upgade the cities wherein most of his mighty Works were done because they repented not and the Lamb's Book had opened up with this message and more would be added but it began with this repent and be baptized and you shall and you shall receive eternal life but he was speaking to all these cities because of all the mighty works that had been done and they repented not that's happened in our day when this gospel this message has gone around the world it's gone all through the United States it's gone to people that say they're in the message but they have not repented nonetheless and then Jesus says begins to name these cities verse 21 wo unto thee Chen wo unto thee for the mighty Works which were done in you had been done in Ty and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and Ashes what was Jesus telling us as time goes on the hearts of the people is becoming harder and harder because had I done these Works in these cities of the Old Testament they would have repented but I did them in your cities but I did these miracles in your churches and I sent a prophet unto you and you would not repent but I say unto you verse 22 it shall be more tolerable for Ty and siden at the day of judgment and for you then he goes on to speak of capernium and brings the same judg in verse 25 Jesus thanks the father that he has hidden the opening Jesus thanks the father that he has hidden the opening of the Lamb's Book of [Music] Life the LI part one the first seal is loosed in verse 11 actually in the days of the ministry of John Elijah it's loosed from the wise and prudent of this world the first seal was loosed but it's hidden from the wise and prudent of this world of the wise and but it but it's but it but is re but he is revealing it but he is revealing it to those who are now being born again and entering into a personal relationship personal relationship Rel with the father in verse 25 Jesus said at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto those who are now being born again babes then he says this message that I've preached on the first seal this message that I preached part one of redemption this message of opening up the Lamb's Book of Life and everything that I just said he say even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight every message I've preached every message that I've preached in Parables those are the ones that only the born again can understand then he says all things are delivered unto me of my father verse 27 and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son then how will we ever know them he he said he said he he says no man knoweth the son but the father no man know the son but the father verse 27 okay and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him there it is a a time of Revelation like never was before and you must be born again Jesus told Nicodemus unless you're born again you cannot see understand the Kingdom of Heaven won't be revealed to you the Lamb's Book of Life won't open if you're not born again you can't know the son or the father or the king of the Jews or the Lamb of God you won't know who's what you won't know who you are to know who they are in verse 28 he says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me what was this yoke it was a learning time what was this yoke it was a teaching time for who he said for you and what I'm going to teach you is this I'm going to start by telling you I am meek and lonly in heart are you am I and if you are you shall find rest unto your souls because you won't become part of that generation of the violent you won't be a religious and you won't be a politician you'll be a son and daughter of God meek and lowly in heart and your souls will find rest in Jesus then he says because he knew your question but won't it be hard to serve you in this wicked generation and he tells you listen close he says my yoke is easy verse 30 my yoke is easy the Yoke of Satan is hard because if you get married you'll be divorced if you drink too much you'll be an alcoholic if you start doing drugs and get addicted that'll kill you that yoke is hard that yoke will make you an Unfaithful husband that yoke will make you an unfaith ful wife that yoke will make you a rebellious child that joke will make you a rebellious young person in the [Music] home that yoke is a hard life to live that's not the Yoke of the Holy Spirit that's not the Yoke of a born again person because the Yoke of God it's easy and the burden I will place on you it's light it's light so right now your burden feels way too heavy and your yoke is feeling way too hard I say go to Jesus I say go to Jesus on Your Knees and and say Lord I know I'm carrying things that I shouldn't carry would you take them off would you loose me of these heavy burden and give me your yoke and give me your burden for your yoke is easy and your burden is light so when it gets too heavy know that the devil has placed a burden on you and you need to recognize it so you can ask Jesus this serving you seems way too hard then what you need is another refilling of the Holy Ghost to loose you of that yoke and that heavy burden and take the Yoke of Jesus for his yoke is easy and his burden that he places on you is light not only light as not heavy but light as in loose loose loose loose loose loose my burden is easy my yoke is easy and my burden is the light of the Holy Ghost my burden is the pillar of fire you don't carry that it carries you you through every hard [Music] trial sister Abby if you'd bring up that song peace of God cover me as our brotherr would come and Joseph part 11 Jesus part 11
