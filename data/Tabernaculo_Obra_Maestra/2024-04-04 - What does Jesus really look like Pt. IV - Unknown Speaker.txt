he got up and sang a special there was a few thousand people there but they didn't know that he was going to sing in Spanish so it really surprised all the people uh to see him singing in Spanish um so we're thankful for brother Peter accepted our invitation the Lord just opened the doors for it so we're thankful for that also we'll put up a little something on the calendar there in the in the foyer in the entry to remind us all and in June which is a little ways away yet we we'll be having some we'll be going to minister there in Albuquerque New Mexico it's June 7th 8th and 9th and they're preaching for our brother rul Gonzalez and the little church there in Albuquerque so we ask your your prayers and for these Services coming up and may God add His blessings to it all we're Min contining to minister on this title what does Jesus really look like it's part four and if you'll turn with me into your in your Bibles there in Matthew uh 11 Matthew 11 and verse 29 thank you Matthew 11 and and verse 29 and it reads like this take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lonely in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls the first thing he said was take my yoke upon you it's the first step to learn of him it's the first step for him to acknowledge I'll be your teacher he said take my yoke upon you then you can begin learning he said for I am meek and lonly he already teaching teaching he's not just saying I am meek and lowly he's saying I'm teaching you and you too can be meek and low in heart and you shall find rest into your souls and and then he understood the the what he had said had kind of shook people up a little the part about take my yoke upon you so then he he discerned what the people was in the people's hearts he's the word he discerns the heart so he said I need to speak on that that's troubling him right now what I said and he did then he said for my yoke the part that That Shook You that's troubled you you want to learn but do I have to take his yoke upon me the answer is yes but he tells us but remember this my yoke is easy Satan's yoke is hard Satan's yoke is heavy Satan's joke will manipulate you joke will use you my yoke is easy and my burden the weight I will put upon you it's nothing like sin it's nothing like sin it's light it's evening light let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again and we ask your blessings now upon your word we believe you've received our worship Lord acknowledge it by giving us now your word and touching every heart in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated we've been speaking on what Jesus really looks like his his attributes prophet priest king his ministry Apostle Prophet teacher evangelist his nature when he said learn of me when he said take my yoke upon you I am meek and lonely in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls do you know what Jesus was speaking of it it's it it is something he spoke about more than you can imagine it's something the apostles spoke about more than we even realized for for it wasn't just in St John 3 where Jesus first mentioned to Nicodemus and said you must be born again but if you can let God reveal R to you then you'll realize here in in in in in Matthew 11:29 take my yoke upon you calling you and asking you to be born again of the teaching begins then the learning begins then the relationship begin his position in the seven sealed book which is also called the Lamb's Book of Life not two different books it's the same book because it's a book of redemption it's how he hides himself from the eyes of the wise and prudent adding detail line upon line word upon word where you can't just go to one scripture and say I got it no no there's more there's always more there's always more of himself that he wants to give to you and he wants to give to me in this Lamb's Book of Life of course he was the Lamb of God and he was the lion of the tribe of and these are the two characteristics that he first dwelt in to open the book open it first to Israel he descended as the Lamb of God long before he died on the cross long before they took his life he wasn't the Lamb of God when he went to the cross he was born the Lamb of God he was being tested tried he was being shown that he was a worthy lamb that there was no wrinkle on him there was no spot upon him that the body that God had made come through an Immaculate perfect birthing process what is that process by which he was born the same process by which you and I are born by the Spoken Word by the original scene by the Holy Spirit Creator creating a new creature that was the body of Jesus and that's who you and I are born again as he was born the spoken word the word creative word of God that's how we born again and it makes us made him a whole new creation different from this flesh body very different we read Mark in Mark 10:4 Mark 10 Marco and verse 45 the many different positions of his ministry but remember when he speaks of his ministry he's giving charact he's given to us the characteristics of the five Ministry so that you can recognize him you can know them so that you can test them you don't have to stay under an unjust Steward God don't want you to stay under an unjust Steward he wants you to be under a man that he's called that has surrendered his life and gift back to God for your edification so that you can come to the fullness Jesus Christ mark 10:4 it said for let's begin in 43 but so shall it not be among you Jesus said whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be sh shall be servant of all for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto this son of man was the king of the Jews this son of man was the Lamb of God Son of Man was your savior and this son of man came minister to you help you to lift you up not for you to serve him as as as as one would serve a king on this Earth where the Kings live in luxury and the people imp poverty not this King he says I want to bring you up into my kingdom hallelujah amen so that you two can live kings and queens for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many as the ministry of Jesus was so he wants the five full ministry who he calls to be just like him remember Ephesians 4:11 where Paul said he gave some these Ministries and these gifts but some will not give their lives with the gift back to him to edify his children remember we quoted from that message the 20th century Prophet it spoke to us of a man A A Gifted Man gifted evangelist who who was praying for the sick in a certain church and and and he he used his gift to call out a woman but when he called her out he publicly denounced her as a witch this a sister who had been a member of this church there for many years it shocked her it shocked the church people looked at her now very differently though they've known her for years and the Evangelist they didn't know but because he had a gift and he called her a witch and it was it was destroying her relationship with the brethren in the church it was destroying her friendships of many years it was turning friends into enemies and one day she went to another meeting where another she thought evangelist was praying for the sick because this had so affected her she physically was feeling sick she thought she had was having heart problems and by the grace of God he was given a prayer card and her number was called and the man that was going to pray for her was a man called William Mariam BR William to the world he was a man with a gift of heal that prayed for the sick but he was more and when she stood in front of this Gifted Man now remember the last one had a gift too remember the last one claimed he believed in Divine Healing and now she's coming before another man and as she walks up brother brandham goes to speaking to her and he says uh I see you have uh heart problems he says but I also see there's a black sheet that's been following you for some time now everywhere you go this black sheet is following you he said wait a minute that black sheet that's a lie that someone told about you he says and that's what's affecting your heart you don't have heart problems this is just making you very nervous this is breaking you down he says oh yes now I see it he says there was a man man who who who who believed in Divine Healing he was praying for the sick in church and he said you were a witch and the woman begins to cry and Shake he said yes it's true he says you're no witch a lie he and yet he was A Gifted Man remember Ephesians chapter 2 and two we read there where it says we have tried them that have called themselves prophets and are not and we have found them to be Liars in other words they were not God's Apostles they were born with a gift God gave it but they never gave the gift back for the edifying of the people of God for the perfecting of the saints of God no but they kept the gift and they used it because they were men who were never born again they were men without the baptism of the Holy Ghost and get a gift like that in their lives you say where does the Bible speak of something like that you go and read it there in Matthew chapter 10 God ordains 12 men he called some of them to be Apostles to establish the church New Testament Church to establish Elders in this new testament them later he tells us I have called 12 of you I've given you gifts of healing he says but one of you is a devil was it that way it repeats and has repeated all the way into our Century over again because though gifted never born again never receive the Holy Ghost and Fire oh they can preach like a like a fire on a windy day they can turn and speak horrible things to you for they've never been born again they don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they love popularity love to be lifted up in h but they don't edify the church they seek their own edification one Gifted Man born with a gift was destroying this woman with with his gift another Gifted Man with his gift surrendered to God and his life also set this woman free Discerning that the other Ministry was a liar with a gift it stumbles the people so much how can he be that so gifted and do what he does to the people of God because he's never been born again never received the baptism of the Holy like the Pharisees in the days of Jesus they had a Zeal for God they said and the and the Zeal was so strong that like Cain they were willing to kill for their God even it was even if it was their own brother do you see the two Spirits all the way from Eden coming down because they haven't been born again because they won't be born again like Judas have not I jesus chosen 12 of you but I want to tell you despite that I have chosen you 12 one of you is the devil is it possible for a man to be called of God to minister and still be found a liar who makes merchandise of God's people Jesus said yes even I have chosen 12 of you one of you is a devil and then I chose 70 more and they all walked away from I he ordained 70 more he gave them a gift to help God's people but because he had entered the third pool of his ministry the word and he said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me and the 70 said we keep the gift we'll tell people we're ordained of Jesus of Nazareth but you should have stayed an evangelist because these doctrines you're preaching now contrary to our organization contrary to what what what other men have taught us they contrary to our churches to our Creeds and dogas we will keep the gift but we're not following you we won't take your yoke upon us so they stopped learning matter of fact they never even started that was their starting day day one start day two they walked away turned their back on Jesus Christ The Living Word just like this woman who this unj Steward had brought so much pain to her life but yet Jesus Christ said so we want to go back to where we left off on Sunday there in St John 14 just like the woman at the well this woman but the woman at the well represents more than just a woman who had been turned out by Mom and Dad who had gone off to live a life as a prostitute and she had come to a place where she had lost all trust in everyone let's begin there in St John chapter 4 and what we're really looking at here not just the scene of a woman defrauded and defiled but we're watching this scene of a church defrauded and defiled by unjust stewards fful Ministry that gave their hearts to the devil get very religious and get with gifts in their lives Ephesians 4:11 said and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelist and some pastors and some teachers he gave some because he didn't give all of them that claim they're his as a matter of fact many are the children and the Ministers of the bonds woman but few are the children and the ministry of the free woman like like Sarah sah and Hagar St John 4: 3 Jesus he says he left Juda and departed again into Gile and he must needs go through Samaria Samaria then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called Saar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour it was about the time that the the the the six seal was unfolding which is about the time of World War II in other words God knew about this before the foundation of the world and when the season came daughter was on the earth he came to meet with her give her a lifechanging experience verse six now Jac now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour in other words getting ready to go into the seventh hour remember how many husbands she had six but she was getting ready to meet her seventh the one that really loved her the one that really would care for her the one that she could really trust and depend on verse seven there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me to drink and he knew he was breaking all the rules that he'd been taught as a Jew never talk to a Samaritan never travel to a Samaritan City and never be caught talking with a prostitude in public these were things that you should never do as a Jew he was known dressed and looked like a Jew three things already broken you could say it was strike three and he barely started strikes verse eight for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew askest drink of me which I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritan she was quick to correct him she had no trust for anyone she was there alone because she wasn't allowed to come with the respectful women of the city the heat of the day the morning just the fact of the time of day she was there marked her as a woman a prostitute and a Samaritan Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God a gift of healing a gift of Salvation a gift of redemption a gift of discernment every gift was in this man he said if you'd only know the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me a drink well tonight he's asking every one of you if you knew the gift of God you'd be saying give me a drink Lord thirst give me a drink that thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water you see how he said it if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that sayith to thee give thou would have asked me he didn't say me God the Creator the almighty one deliver your hope mine he said and he thou would have asked of him and you know what he would have done tonight he would have given you the Living Water the woman sayth unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with all she could see was what was her with her eyes Jesus had said she couldn't see him she just saw the reflection of who he was on the Earth but in him this man Jesus wel the fullness God bodily oh he was all God but she just saw a man the woman saith unto her sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep when then has thou The Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob well and drank thereof himself and his children Jesus answered Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into Everlasting Life Born Again experience it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's what makes you and I a new creation and when that happens we can never be the same again what will be now is more like him every day but remember what he said take my yoke upon you the woman of the well was about to do just that the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw I'm tired of coming here at this time of day you don't know how it makes me feel it's embarrassing people look down on me everybody knows why I come at this time because it's the way I've been living I don't want to come here anymore and be identified this way give me this water so I don't have to come at this time this way she was still thinking very natural Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come here because what I'm about to discuss with you I'd like your husband to be present the woman answered she was thinking she was StreetWise very StreetWise very quickly it was that fast moving mind that got her in so much trouble over the years quick to always pick the wrong man again the woman answered and said what shall I tell him now I know I have no husband in other words I don't have a husband she thought that's really not a lie because I actually I'm already had five of them so if I tell him I I don't have one husband I'm not really lying to them cuz he seems like a good man there is no better man than Jesus for you and I tonight the woman answered that I have no husband Jesus said unto her you liar no no no no no no no he caught it he saw what she was doing you know what he said thou has said well I have no husband I don't have just one you've said well very well said he says for thou now he begins to discern now he goes to the root of the problem now he's going to set her free he says for thou has had five husbands and he whom now now has is not thy husband so she had six she was on number six in that thou said us truly the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou are a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship now she's getting sensitive to the spirit now she's speaking on on different terms now she's approaching it more correctly said our fathers worshiped on this mountain and he say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship she was getting ready to say Jerusalem is the place even though I'm a Samaritan I'll go there tell me where to go and I'll go there I want Living Water Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when NE when you shall neither in this mountain yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews the hour cometh when is that hour coming right now the hour cometh and now is right now tonight we know what we worship the salvation of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worship because the Lamb's Book of Life has been open and the first seal has been pulled off and part one was unfolding here the woman of the well this was all happening at the opening of the first seal all happening at the in the days of Jesus he was the lamb who opened the first seal John said in Revelation 6 I saw when the lamb opened this first seal when did he see it happened in Matthew 11 Jesus opened it because he was the lamb but we saw it in reality in Matthew 11 John saw it in a symbol in Revelation and we've seen the opening of The Seven seal everyone else reads it in the book The Prophecy and they see nothing but we see the prophecy becoming history in our day Jesus said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth that's how we need to come to every service with a Heart of Thanksgiving with praise and worship in our mouths brings his presence down then we can renew our vow with him a marriage vow and take his yoke upon us be born again the woman saith unto him I know verse 25 I know the Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things now she was moving into the channel look at the things she's saying now she's digging way deep of times when she was a little girl and she heard the gospel preach the holy spirit is bringing this back to her memory it seems like I can remember Messiah comes Jesus com at the second coming is Christ and when he comes he'll tell me he'll tell are in our lives he can make and cleanse us all Jesus said unto her I that speak unto to the I'm here I'm here it's me and I'm here tonight and I'm speaking to your hearts this woman the entire five full ministry that she came in contact with Jesus told when she said I don't have a husband he said you've said truth because because you've had five the entire fivefold Ministry that she came in contact with were unjust stewards how is it possible to go from one bad pastor to another but it happens but if you're a daughter of God if you're the church if you're part of this bride you'll finally bump in to Jesus the chief Pastor evangelist of evangelist your high priest and apost so the entire fful Ministry that she came in contact with were unjust stewards you see all you see they all run in the same circles to get out of that cycle you have to change you've got to change husband one who's preaching from an open book will bring just stewards who who also ministered to you these divinely revealed mystery truths what did a prophet say about this in the seventh seal he said this he said I'd like to add this that of all the services I've ever had in my life I believe this week has been the most glorious time of all my life in services in the message of the seven seal and the recommendation of many pastors is we don't need the Seven Seals they're too controversial and we don't need them for our Salvation unjust steward I'm sorry because that's not what a prophet said he said I'd like to add this that of all the services I've ever had in my life I believe this week has been the most glorious time of all my life and services I'm sure Jesus was feeling the same way of all the services I've had coming to restore this daughter tonight is one of the most glorious times to bring Salvation to bring Deliverance to cleanse the hearts and minds of I bet Jesus was thinking the same thing the woman had six the seventh was talking to her no matter he said I've seen great Miracles performed of course before in healing services but this is beyond that this is this what we're experiencing this is beyond a healing service it's been one of the great times highlights of my life is to be here the opening of the word is healing for the soul it's the adoption of sons that takes us back to Eden Jesus Christ showed us how all these Ministries should function in the restoration of both the Fig Tree and the bride tree he came as the as the chief Shepherd in Hebrews 13 and 20 he says now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant our pastor tonight Jesus Christ verse 21 and may he make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing like he did for the woman of the well through Jesus Christ to him be glory forever and ever amen amen he was he's the great Shepherd he's the great Pastor in Hebrews 3 and 1 it says wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus [Music] Jesus he was the first Pastor he's the first Apostle as you all remember in St John 3 where it says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews and said that the same came to Jesus by night said unto him Rabbi we know us Priest usit Us teachers us ministers in we know that thou are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou do us except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verely verely I say unto you except the man be born again unless you take my yoke upon you you cannot see the kingdom of God you see how he's preaching the Born Again experience every Parable us you must be born again you must be born again you must be born again you must take my yoke upon you and then we say well that's the problem that sounds like it that sounds like it won't let me have any fun anymore but he discerned the crowd he said I see the part that bothers you my yoke let me remind you my yoke is easy unlike the devil's yoke it's hard my burden is light unlike the burden that the devil puts on you it's heavy you'll Bend under the Lo and you'll die in sin won't you take my Yol Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be Jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things he didn't know but Jesus a teacher and a revealer of the word Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against be born again and I'll give you Revelation and my revelation will bring you joy peace it will make you me and lowely of heart you'll be just like me Jesus pastor Pastor Apostle my apost teacher and in Deuteronomy 18:15 inom a prophecy coming from the very lips of Moses he said the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren like unto like unto me unto him ye shall Heen in the day of P Moses anointed of the Holy Spirit an apostle would been born again receive the baptism of God brings to his memory by Revelation what Moses had said over 2000 years ago and he said this day these scriptures have come to pass St John 146 Jesus setting this church free Jesus setting this woman free Jesus said unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou has well said I have no husband in other words I don't have one husband she's saying he said that's very well said for thou has had five a pastor an evangelist a teacher a prophet an apostle and all five of them were unjust stewards and they've crashed the church down to pieces
