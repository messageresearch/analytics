song as we bring fourth brother Daniel Amen the song touched my heart just was going through the book and uh caught my attention you know decide to look up the words and hear the words you know [Music] when I first when I first heard of Jesus his love and his grace my heart was over overwhelm to think the king would take my place I CED Lord I'll go with you every step of the way that's all I can do my dead to repay I love him too much to fil him now too much too break my thou for I promise the Lord that I'll make it so somehow and now I love him too much to fail him now I told him I Lov him it was easy to say but harder to prove when Temptation came my way for what good all broken promises I counted but lost when I caught the glimpse of to love on that cross I love him too much to fail him now too much to Break My Vow for I promise the Lord that I'll make it somehow and now I love him to much to fail him [Music] now amen thank you brother Jonathan that's what it comes down to we love him too much to fail him now because we remember that he loved us before we loved him and when we were yet unlovable he loved us so that's why we now love him too much because he's done so much for us that's what a born again experience does it it it it causes you to be able to feel the love of God and and and and an appreciation for that love what he did for us on the cross of Calvary that's a revelation I wasn't there when it happened but since I've been born again I was there with when it happened yes so we're we're thankful for that but through a born again experience we can go back to where it happened and somehow we remember [Music] it by Revelation we'd like to speak tonight on tithing and offering tithing can we have some quotes that begin around 1955 to 1965 there are many different ones more than what we have even here tonight or we'll be able to read and uh we we will continue uh um we will continue on on Sunday on on this on this on this subject and and God help us to deliver it from the word of God I I think overall the the teaching and tithing uh it has been simplified and it is simple as as as is all the teachings of the Bible if you can go in and see the pattern of God's word if you if you can understand by Revelation that you must add word upon word and line upon line then then once we get that mind of Christ in our hearts then we approach all of God's truths on on that basis that it's not just one quote in the Bible and it's just not one quote of what William brandham said it must be word upon word and line upon line to to build a teaching upon one quote whether it's the Bible or whether it's William brandom or whether it's Billy Graham or any other minister is an error it's it's a mistake because the word is line upon line word upon word here a little and there a little the Bible says and every Revelation that we have uh we must put a comma at the end of it and say this is what I believe and if there's more may God continue to Open the Eyes of our understanding so we had uh several uh quotes today tonight and uh I was hoping to get it sent actually to brother uh Leo here send it to brother Leo but but uh in order to do that I was going to be needing to use my telephone to link my two iPads together uh to give one to brother Leo so it would have been easy to do if I would have remembered not to leave leave my phone at home so uh I told Leo I'd have it ready for him for service and and everything was ready to go and then he come to the front and I started looking for my telephone and uh that was the missing link right there so we'll we'll we'll do our best to share the one iPad and he for the Spanish and may God add the blessing to his word tonight turn turn with me to Hebrews chapter 7 for scripture reading the Apostle Paul uh writing this book of Hebrews and even that is controversial amongst Church historians as to who wrote This Book of Hebrews as to who wrote as to who wrote it Paul wrote the book is what many historians believe and once again many historians of of uh that are are that that also believe that it was not Paul like everything in the Bible there are those that say yes I believe it this way and no I don't see it that way and can that's to be expected be because we're human beings but but overall Jesus said when he was asking the disciples who do men say that I am and they said well well some men say you're Jeremiah some some men think you're Elijah uh some think you're one of the prophets that's come back from the dead or something so it was easy for them to answer while while he was asking them it wasn't a personal question it was not a personal question it was who do men say that I am so everyone was ready to say what they heard men say but when he went to Peter and he said but who do you say that I am and Peter said Thou Art the Christ that's that's that's saying you're Messiah that's saying you're God in flesh because that's what that represented to the Jewish people he says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you this isn't the opinion of the high priest or any of the Levites he says but my Father which is in heaven has given you this Revelation and Upon This Rock I'm going to build my church where where you need a personal experience with the father where where where you need a friendship restored with the father he says outside of because because it's on that basis that I'll build my church my family you've got to become part of the family through a born again experience you've got to come to know your papa and when you know him you can rest because he knows everything and he's determined to teach you and take you baby steps at a time into Perfection to be perfect as the father in Heaven is perfect that's being Eternal Hebrews chapter 7 and verse one for this mzc king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of Peace So Abraham he gave a 10th part to MDC king of righteousness king of Salem king of Peace King King King three times without father without mother like Jesus could have been Jesus could have been the same God without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God in other words he's telling us MDC was like unto the Son of God how was he the same could if you would have been able to take mdc's picture for 3,000 years ago and then a picture of Jesus when he was on Earth we might have found that God used a body that looked identical simply because he's the same yesterday to today and forever I don't believe Jesus of Nazareth that the way he looked was the first time God ever used that look I believe he's a god of pattern and Order and he's the same yesterday today and forever let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again ask your blessings on your word and on your children in Jesus name amen you may be seated Tidings and offerings in the message enticing Spirits brother Bram says this this is 1955 and he and he says this today they're trying to take the place of God's tithing they're trying to adopt something else they're trying to make it different they go down and have Bunko games in the churches play Lottery lottery will never take the place of God's tithing he says the lottery will never take the place place of God's tithing suppers blankets selling picnics to raise money to different depths to for different depths off it'll never take the place of God's Eternal tithe and offering it'll never do it but yet we're trying to do it am I was told by a gentleman I was told he said what you ought to do since you have this big parking lot outside you you ought to have car washes and have all the church people come and wash cars and and that'll help pay for all the church expenses I told them thank you but we're not going to do that because God has a better way God has an order brother says what is it it's enticing Spirits coming down trying to substitute something for the word of God God has no sub substitute for his word it's Eternal and forever God has nothing to substitute faith faith has no substitute and and as we know the word says without faith it's impossible to please God God and without without faith it's impossible to please God to please God he said hope is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen or faith is rather see hope is one thing faith is another hope hopes for it faith has got it one is intellectual Faith the other is direct revelation of God it'll never take its place we're trying but we're making all these substitutes so Prophet here was telling us that God has a way God has an order but the churches over the last 100 years and even more than that the Catholic Church they've made substitutes instead of taking God at his word they' brought in substitutes in the message the second coming says this and now and then in finally we are not here to he says and now he says find we are finding we're not here to take up finances I says I wish we didn't even have to ask for one offering in the meeting but just he says in the meeting he said I never took an offering in my life never in my life did I ever take any offering uh and in my church when I was Pastor there Baptist Minister for 12 years I never received one penny salary but I always thought the Lord had made me healthy and I could work so why not work and and Pastor now that's not an example for other pastors because learning later that a minister of the Gospel can't go out to work and and slave and then come in and do his church Justice he's got to visit among his members and so forth and the little Tidings and things from the members and offerings would certainly help take care of him and I think the labor is worthy of his hire but in my case I was working in conver conservation things that I like out in the woods and I like work so I work now brother brandom's here is relating what what he did and and why he did it he makes a statement here and and and he says he says he says now he says he says I never took an offering in my life that's because he didn't want to that's because he had a complex of asking people for money that's CU he felt I can I I'll work and make my own money and no one will will help help me make my way through life and and so it was a complex in his life he said I never took an offering in my life he said uh he said and in my church when I was Pastor there a Baptist Minister for 12 years and now he's calling himself a Baptist Minister for 12 years and he's pastoring brandom Tabernacle you you see how if we take things so literally and carnally all the different things that can be twisted what we're seeing is a man growing into his ministry and it was a difficult one for sure and and so does every Minister and every believer in Christ we're all growing unto the stature of a perfect man and just like every Christian man the head of his home it's it's easy for me to look back and say if I had a chance to do it again I would have been a different kind of a dad I can look back and say there's certain things that that I did out of anger it it wasn't right but I had began a journey with no experience if I could go go back again oh there's many things I would do different and the way I treated and spoke to my wife Karen but that's looking back so we were growing and William brandham was a man growing into his ministry as we're men growing into our ministry we hope that we can that we can pass on the things we've learned by the mistakes that we have made so I have I have many things I could share with you uh I'd like to call it wisdom but it came because of the mistakes that I made so here brother bam says I never took up an offering in my life I said when I he says in my church when I was a pastor there he a Baptist Minister for 12 years I never received one penny of salary but I always thought that the Lord had made me healthy and I could work he's walking us through his reasoning he said so why not work at Pastor now that's not an example for other pastors because learning later that a minister of the Gospel can't go out and work and slave that you know that that's also human reasoning uh because if he has to he he he just has to go out and work and slave you know the the old Minister the Ministers of the Pentecostal movement the ministers Min or Min uh would have been men like my father and and my grandfather's age of all those men that I knew growing up evangelists they take the gospel through the West California Arizona to Mexico all of them worked labored hard I don't know of any of them they were educated they were all uneducated they were all bluecollar workers they were they were all laborers worked with their hands they would save every penny they could that they didn't need to feed their families then they would get up and go for weeks sometimes months to take the gospel they'd come back broke with no money and go back to work again so it's a it it it it to some degree it's a modern thought it's it's a it's a modern thought that a pastor shouldn't or can't work that a pastor shouldn't uh go out and work and slave as brother uses the the term here he said and and then come in and do his church Justice there there is a certain line there that that is a truth depending on the size of the congregation and the church men can be over involved in business man can be that take too much of their time that they're making more money than what they need to make and they're not putting enough time on their knees in the studying of the word in in the studying of the word and to do the church and the people justice so there is there is a there is a a line there that's correct but a pastor of a small group then then the pastor must be sure that there is money to pay the [Music] expenses uh money to bring in ministries that will bless the people and that comes that comes way before that that before him even receiving any kind of a salary it's like the father in The the home and the mother in a home I remember sitting at our table as a as a boy and mom would feed all of our all of us kids and I asked her one time because we had all eat until we were full and I said Mom aren't you going to eat oh she says I'm not hungry tonight well I realized later that after she fed us all there wasn't anything left for Mom and she was good with that she made that decision and so is the church if in if in fact the pastor sees that the family the family's need should be met made first the needs of the family the church family must be met first above and beyond a a pastor receiving tithing now these are very personal statements so these are for this congregation because we're not a denomination but yet this is what I believe is a is a truth in the message the faith of Abraham sometime ago sometime ago I was going to give a l i was I was going they were going to give me a large offering he he said it was a tithing he said it was a tithing he said it was a tithing he said but it was too much for me and I told him I wouldn't receive an offering like that so brother brother brother brandom first said talks about it being a [Music] tithing brother bam first said he says it said it was a tithing because he's because he's telling us the end of the story when he starts he already knows the end of the story so you he so you almost need a revelation just to listen to him speak so he's telling us at the beginning the end of the story because he knows the end and then he goes into the beginning so he says some time ago I I was they were going to give me a large offering he said it was a tithing the person giving it to him so that's the end of the story he's telling us now he's going to start to the beginning of it he said but it was too much for me but it was too much for me and I told them I wouldn't receive an offering like that so now he's telling us starting the story from from the beginning and he believing this brother was giving him an offering he said I I told him I wouldn't receive an offering like that he said but brother brandom I must give it to you he said then he said it's tithing I said well now if it's tithing it goes to God's Church no no no doesn't it goes all the tithing belong to the pastor the here is 1959 and he said I said well now if it's tithing it goes to God's Church you see in the Old Testament and we'll be reading more as we study this this message in this subject the the children of Israel would bring their Tidings and offerings to God's house he said the tidings the priest would take it the levit to make the the proper sacrifices and under the law in the Old Testament the levit received the 10th the 10th part of all the tidings that had come to the Lord not all the tithings that the people had brought because the tithings belong to God the offerings that the people bring belong to God so God says the Levites they can have a tenth of all the tidings that come in now the old Old Testament is a shadow of things to come so we must add more to this to really understand where we're at today but one thing for sure in the Old Testament type and Shadow of all the tithings and offerings that people would bring that all those Tidings were not 100% belonging to the Levites and the priests a tenth of all that was brought in was for the Levites to have to live by in the message the faith of Abraham let's keep no let's keep reading the the faith of ab say I said well now if it's tithing it goes to God's church so now we have two statements one where a prophet said the tithing belongs to the pastor and one where he says the tithing if if it's Tidings CS it goes to God's church so now we got two statements to find a balance to find the truth he said that's right I said well if the Lord is giving you those ties brother said I said well if the Lord is giving you those tithes he's got people somewhere to give it to now he's telling us one of the things that those Tidings can be used for he says he said if the Lord is giving you those ties he's got people somewhere to give it to they're all out on the field everywhere and when I when I know of missionaries preaching on the field with no shoes on in um may make two meals a week I can do without something myself I can do without you you and I think we all could do that to help those poor Brethren who are struggling for the cause of Christ so here the prophet tells us the tithing it goes to God's church not a building so much but a people a mystical body no no no and so the prophet lays down uh something that these Tidings can also be used for and and and how a pastor that has this these Tidings available that it was his opinion he should be helping missionaries who are preaching the gospel men who men who are struggling for the cause of Christ in the message the faith of Abraham also 1959 he says I believe it was some great man maybe TL Osborne or somebody that said one time that no one has the right to hear the gospel twice while one hasn't heard it even once and that's right he said but you see the American people has got the money and others don't I'm a poor man I haven't got no money and I go along uh I've never took I've never took an offering in my life now remember we're going to make put this statement you can go on tape and here brother brandom from time to time he is speaking and he says I think it's about time to take up the offering and he says and then he kind of laughs a little bit and he says um brother Neville would you come up and do that please so you keep that in your mind when he says I've never took up an offering he would call others to do it and most of the time he was coming up to preach the word the offering already been picked up it wasn't that that brother brother brandom Tabernacle did not pick up offerings it was it it wasn't that brandham Tabernacle that they that they didn't pick up offerings just brother Brandon was made sure that it was never him asking for the offering he said I'm a poor man I haven't got no no he says Capital but he meant money and I've never took an offering in my life never did just what people freely send me so he received offerings he just he was just always sure to do not ask for one he says then I take that and hold and and put it together he says and then as soon as I get enough built up or saved he said I would take right off to the heathens and preach the gospel he says so I'll have to answer for your tithing and the people that give it to me on tithing in the message here ye him 1959 he says tonight I sure appreciate your fine love offering which will be given to me after the service did did he receive offerings many throughout his ministry could we say he received millions of dollars yes it's a truth because when the government when the IRS uh came after him for for back taxes owed they said they were charging him $300,000 in taxes and penalties that was in the 1960s so it it was millions that they were charging him for he had never hid the [Music] money he never hid the money he never did anything illegal he never did anything unethical but he did make a a mistake concerning the laws of the land and what he should have done when he received checks from people he should have never signed the back of those checks he should have simply deposited him as he did into the brandom Tabernacle organization the fund for missionary work without ever signing the back of the checks because when he signed the back and deposited the money the government the US government came after him they said the law is specific when you sign the back of the check that makes it your personal income he says and when you did that you then you deposited in into your missionary fund but when you sign the back it became your personal income he says and now you owe us taxes on that had he never signed the back of those [Music] checks and just simply deposited them into the missionary fund the government could have never done anything to him so did he do something illegal yes but that doesn't make the law just did he do something unethical or wrong no he did nothing wrong but the way the government the laws are written when he signed that check it made it his personal income so you see but William Brandon wasn't the only one during that time that the government was chasing if you look into history it was a period of time it was a period of time when they were going after many EV traveling evangelists in that day that were praying for the sick and having campaigns of Divine Healing they weren't just chasing down William brandham the the government was going after all of these men at this time it wasn't just him brother manam says in the message hear ye him and tonight and tonight I sure appreciate your fine love offering which will be given me after the service I will promise you there won't be any cigarettes or whiskey anything anything wrong I'll go for preaching the gospel in Australia and wherever the Lord will send me and and when a soldier is born in the Kingdom there it'll be to your credit on that day I'm only following a leading of the spirit I must do that and you're sending me your money your tithing is sending me how he used the tithing to go himself to preach the gospel and to help others to go preach the gospel so the full sum of tithing coming in from the Old Testament we're told that the full sum didn't belong to the Levites but a tenth of the full sum was given to them that was the shadow that was the Old Testament we know many changes came when the New Testament came into [Music] place so but under the old all the tithings and offerings that came in they belong to God the believer brought them to God then God told the Levites of all the offerings that bring come to me the tithes also I'll give you a tenth and as you know the Levites had no inheritance of land none God wanted them to be totally unburdened of those things so that they could fully give themselves in the offering of the offerings for Israel for the sins of the people in the message what is the Holy Ghost brother Bram said this when God was setting things in order he said all you Levites I've called you out and made you priests and all your brethren the other 11 tribes will pay you tithing he says when you get a a nine when you get a nine bushels of apples or 10 bushels of apples uh give one bushel to the Levites when you run your sheep through when when you when you bring your sheep into out of the pastures uh he he he he says pick up the 10th sheep pick up the 10th sheep pick up the 10th sheep he says and I don't care if it's a little one or a big one a fat one or a poor one that belongs to the Levites now as time went on the Levites began to choose the biggest the best back in the Old Testament he says now Levites when you get all of this then you tithe also to the Lord so now it we realize it's the Old Testament we're not putting a period on anything but we want want to walk through the shadow to come to the reality of today he said now you Levites when you get all this your your 10th part of all that the other 11 tribes give you they've got 10 sheep they pick one and they give it to you the 10th one so they line up the sheep and they start walking them through they count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine 10 the 10th one that's the Levites even if it was the smallest or if it was the biggest when they counted to 10 that was the one then the prophet says in this message 1959 what is the Holy Ghost now Levites when you get that 10th part then you tithe also to the Lord you make the wave offering the heave offerings the the different offerings you tithe to the Lord so under the Old Testament everyone tithed and everyone was tithing to the same person to the Lord the tithing and offerings have always been to the Lord so that if you're ever in a in an assembly a church and in your heart you've always brought your Tidings to the Lord if in your heart then even if that Pastor becomes an unjust Steward he says you never gave your tithes to the man if you give your tithing and offerings to God and you you'll never have to regret having paid your offerings and tithings to God because God will deal with that unjust servant that's God's business if he takes it all in and he never gives his offering and tithings unto the Lord you will still be blessed because from your heart you did the right thing for the right Reason by Revelation you brought your Tidings and offerings to the house of God you gave it to the the Lord now the stewards in that house the ministry is responsible to continue to do something in for the kingdom of God when God was setting in order he said all you Levites I've called you out and made you preach and all your brethren the other 11 tribes will pay you a tithing so when you have 10 bushels of apples one bushel will be to the Levites when you run your sheep and you have 10 of themas and you have 10 yes you give one to the Levites then he says now the Levites when you get this T then you tithe too to the Lord you make the wave offering the different offerings is how you tithe to the Lord the Levites the priests they should continually be working for the kingdom of God Lord willing will continue on Sunday Tidings and offerings we've just barely scratched the top of it tonight but we're already realizing a few things of the shadow that the tithings and offerings the people brought them unto the Lord they didn't bring them to the Levites and when they brought it the Levites were to take the tithings and offerings and make the different offerings before the Lord and sacrifices and theirs was one10 for them to make and to live but from the on10th that they received they too were to offer their tithing unto the Lord so here is a principle number one tithings and offerings whether it's a lay member or a minister we're to all bring it unto the house of God and lift it up before the Lord and see how we can use it to prosper the kingdom of God first the family of of God is to be used also the tidings to bring in just stewards of a of a fightful Ministry to be a blessing to God's people so one principle we we we come at tonight when you give your tithings and offerings never give it to a man only the man Christ Jesus the blessing in then is upon your life God said give and I will bless you I will out bless you I will out give you in so many ways and you will never regret having paid tithes you will never regret paying tithes if you always gave them to him to the Lord as we stand to our feet tonight Hebrews 71 once again for this mzed king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent have having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils consider this is still the same great man to whom we ought to be giving our tithes and offerings too not just tithing physical money but our time but our time should be tithed unto the Lord he says and verily they verse five and verily they that are the sons of of Levi who receed the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their Brethren though they come out of the loins of Abraham but he who descend sent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better when we pay our tithes and offering unto the Lord we are the less men but be but be assured we'll be blessed of the greater almighty God himself so the first principle is of all the tidings and offerings that came in to the church church only a tenth of that was for the levite the priesthood and the Levites must give an offering unto the Lord from their 10th part so who gave uh to whom was it told to pay offerings and tithing to all from the janitor to the high priest from the lay members to the priesthood let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you as we found this first principle in your word help us by the grace of God to build upon it Stone upon Stone Revelation upon Revelation till we come to the truth and it's in the truth where you bless us it's in the truth where we're set free for you said and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free amen am God bless you all tonight the musician comes and brother Jonathan sister Abby could you bring up that song the goodness of God I think
