[41:35] Gentiles and into any city of the
[41:37] Samaritans enter you
[41:40] not because he was the king of the
[41:43] Jews and he only came to the
[41:46] Jews in his first
[41:49] coming his firstborn
[41:55] son that that was he was giving
[41:57] everything that the father was going to
[41:59] give he was going to

[42:11] Life Lamb's Book the Lamb's Book of Life
[42:14] and they rejected it in verse
[42:19] six and Jesus speaking to the twel

[44:41] meat tithing and
[44:44] offering it is is something
[44:47] scriptural the Old
[44:49] Testament to the New
[44:53] Testament the principle of this of these
[44:59] two the uh work I'm sorry the Workman is
[45:03] worthy of his
[45:06] meat and that is such so the truth in
[45:09] the old
[45:10] test and Jehova put it in in
[45:16] order and that's a truth that carried
[45:18] over into the New
[45:21] Testament and the Order
[45:24] of
[45:26] the order of both of
[45:29] them outside of the
[45:33] principle the order is
[45:36] distinct one was a
[45:39] shadow and now we're living in the
[45:43] reality under a new
[45:46] testament it's no longer the the book of
[45:49] the
[45:51] law now it's the uh book of the Lamb B
[45:54] the Lamb's Book of Life
[45:56] in the uh First
[45:59] Corinthians in chapter
[46:05] 4 uh Paul says we
[46:08] are uh we are uh we are fools for Christ
[46:11] working with our
[46:15] hands 1 Corinthians 4:
[46:20] 10 we are fools for Christ's
[46:24] sake but you are wise in
[46:27] Christ we are
[46:29] weak but you are
[46:32] strong you
[46:35] honorable but we are
[46:41] despised Paul was saying that the the
[46:44] burden of of the
[46:49] ministry always um bumping into each
[46:52] other being challenged being challenged
[46:54] by the World by the the
[47:02] world even unto this present hour both
[47:06] hunger and
[47:08] thirst and are
[47:12] naked and are
[47:14] buffeted and have no certain Dwelling
[47:17] Place verse
[47:21] 12 and labor working with our own
[47:24] hands being
[47:26] reviled we
[47:30] bless being
[47:32] persecuted we suffer
[47:35] it Paul
[47:39] also and like the M Paul like the
[47:42] messenger of the second
[47:47] coming Paul also worked with his
[47:52] hands to to to sustain himself
[47:57] and in the beginning of his
[48:00] ministry he was taken out of his
[48:05] denomination and and he left his his
[48:09] denomination to
[48:12] follow to preach the
[48:18] Evangelist that it's not coming but it's
[48:20] here
[48:22] now and in the beginning of his ministry
[48:26] I worked with my own
[48:28] hands to to take the gospel
[48:36] am First
[48:41] Corinthians okay First Corinthians
[48:43] chapter
[48:47] 1 um I'm sorry First Corinthians chapter
[48:50] 4 verse
[48:53] one this it says like
[49:03] this let a man so account of us as the
[49:06] Ministers of
[49:08] Christ and the stewards of mysteries of
[49:11] God once more verse
[49:17] one and let a man so account of us as of
[49:20] the Ministers of
[49:22] Christ and the stewards of mysteries of
[49:24] God
[49:28] moreover it is required in
[49:31] stewards that a man be
[49:36] found that a man be found
[49:39] faithful not just to have a
[49:43] title and to take tithes and
[49:48] offerings he has to be faithful to be
[49:52] worthy to receive these things
[49:57] and if he receives it
[50:00] indignantly there's a day of judgment
[50:02] for
[50:06] him first
[50:10] Corinthians chapter 9 verse
[50:15] 13 and we know that it's a principle in
[50:17] the b in the
[50:20] scripture the Old
[50:22] Testament
[50:24] newest
[50:26] God never changed his mind of
[50:29] that of the order that he put is
[50:32] distinct from the old to the
[50:35] new but the
[50:38] principle to give tithes and
[50:42] offerings it stays firm in the
[50:46] Bible 1 Corinthians chapter
[50:48] 9 verse 13 it says like
[50:54] this
[50:58] do you not know that they which minister
[50:59] about holy things live of the things of
[51:02] the
[51:05] temple and they which wait at the altar
[51:07] are partakers with the
[51:13] altar even so ha the Lord ordained they
[51:16] which preach the
[51:17] gospel should live the of the
[51:22] gopel first it talks of the Old
[51:24] Testament
[51:28] God
[51:31] instituted I'm
[51:34] sorry God also God in also
[51:38] placed the Old
[51:41] Testament uh Paul
[51:44] confirming and in verse
[51:47] 14 even so like
[51:53] before the Lord ordained that they which
[51:56] preach the
[51:57] gospel should live of the
[52:04] Gospel but I have used none of these
[52:07] things um sorry hold ver verse 15 yes
[52:13] but I have used none of these
[52:19] things but I have used none of these
[52:21] things stop
[52:24] there
[52:26] but I have used none of these
[52:29] things you notice
[52:31] Paul he he
[52:34] repeats this attitude of Paul it
[52:39] repeats and in a man called William
[52:44] Brown this was the messenger of the
[52:46] first age the Ephesus
[52:49] age and it repeated in the seventh
[52:52] age with the seventh angel this the same
[52:57] attitude but I have used none of these
[53:03] things neither have I written these
[53:05] things that it should be done so done
[53:08] unto
[53:09] me Paul preached
[53:12] it but he was
[53:15] careful one maybe his a
[53:20] complex I don't preach it so that you do
[53:23] it unto me
[53:26] but I preach it because it's a truth of
[53:33] God neither have I written these things
[53:36] that it should be done be so done unto
[53:42] me for it would be better for me to die
[53:45] that than than that any man should make
[53:47] my glory in
[53:51] void for though I preach the
[53:54] gospel I have nothing the glory
[53:58] of for NE for necessity is laid upon
[54:05] me and the Apostle
[54:10] Paul he's giving us an attitude a
[54:14] correct
[54:15] attitude of one
[54:17] Minister because he was the
[54:20] first he was the angel to that
[54:24] age
[54:26] he began the unfolding of this
[54:30] message order what
[54:33] was in the Old
[54:36] Testament he brought it from the
[54:38] Shadow and he made it
[54:42] real how to apply it in this Gospel of
[54:45] the New
[54:47] Testament
[54:49] verse for although I preach the
[54:51] gospel I have nothing to Glory of
[54:56] for necessity is laid
[54:59] upon is to me if I preach not the
[55:04] gospel and for that to
[55:10] say evangelists in the time of
[55:13] um of the
[55:17] Prophet that they also preached Divine
[55:21] Healing and some had lifted up
[55:25] and one in
[55:29] particular and he he uh lifted up and
[55:33] stood he stood up before before
[55:36] thousands of people thousands of
[55:40] people and there was a campaign to to
[55:42] pray for the
[55:44] sick and he he stood up before the
[55:48] people the Lord showed
[55:51] me 10 people here right
[55:54] now and each one's going to give me
[55:58] $1,000 and we're going to begin to pray
[56:00] for the
[56:02] sick until the last one gives me a thous
[56:06] cuz the Lord told
[56:09] me and he keeps saying that the same
[56:14] thing another one another one two stood
[56:16] up up to
[56:18] 10 and then he began to
[56:22] pray and he had already received his his
[56:25] um his
[56:30] reward and it wasn't God and it wasn't
[56:32] eternal
[56:35] life when one begins to manipulate the
[56:38] the um kingdom of
[56:40] God the devil in that man that's
[56:44] all if it's not God who is
[56:48] [Music]
[56:50] it to give that
[56:53] attitude when Paul didn't have
[56:56] it when Paul's attitude was very
[57:01] distinct uh uh ver chapter 9
[57:06] verse for though I preach the gospel I
[57:08] have nothing to Glory
[57:11] of for necessity is laid upon
[57:16] me y Woe Is unto me if I preach not the
[57:22] gospel if they don't give me one penny
[57:25] woe isn't to
[57:28] me I'm not preaching to receive a
[57:34] salary called me to preach the gopel
[57:37] that's
[57:39] all verse
[57:43] 17 for if I do this thing
[57:46] willingly I have a
[57:49] reward but if against my
[57:53] will a dispens ation of the Gospel is
[57:55] committed unto
[58:00] me what is my reward
[58:05] then barely that when I preach the
[58:09] gospel I may make the gospel of Christ
[58:12] without
[58:15] charge that I abuse not my power in the
[58:19] gospel what was his
[58:21] charge to receive tithes and offerings
[58:25] but I I haven't done
[58:28] it he was working with his
[58:30] hands to bring the
[58:36] gospel and to to after he had spoken of
[58:39] the
[58:40] Gospel after he
[58:43] spoke of the the correct
[58:50] order and what reward is it spoken
[58:53] of
[58:58] and then he says what is my reward
[59:01] then when I preach the
[59:04] gospel I may make the gospel of
[59:07] Christ the the gospel of
[59:12] Christ that I abuse not my power in the
[59:16] gospel his charge was to
[59:18] receive ties and
[59:22] offerings but his attitude was
[59:26] distinct that portion is of
[59:29] God it is in
[59:32] Hearts he put in
[59:35] Hearts to supply our
[59:39] needs but I can't worry about
[59:45] that to be on my knees
[59:48] looking the word of God for the for the
[59:51] people
[59:53] of will take care the
[59:55] rest and in the order he has he's take
[59:58] he's
[1:00:00] made in second
[1:00:02] Corinthians uh
[1:00:05] chapter8 here
[1:00:12] Paul he is admonishing the
[1:00:17] church over the
[1:00:22] offerings second Corinthians chapter 8
[1:00:25] verse
[1:00:31] 1 is that verse 9 or verse verse n
[1:00:34] chapter 9 and verse one
[1:00:41] okay for it's touching the ministering
[1:00:44] to the
[1:00:47] Saints it is Superfluous for me to write
[1:00:50] to
[1:00:53] you for I know know the foreignness of
[1:00:55] your
[1:00:59] mind for which I boast of you to them of
[1:01:06] Macedonia he is lifting up these this
[1:01:09] group this group from Macedonia of
[1:01:12] Macedonia these Believers these
[1:01:16] Believers
[1:01:21] is that a was ready a year ago
[1:01:30] and your Zeal have provoked very
[1:01:33] many yet I have sent the
[1:01:45] Brethren lest our boasting of you should
[1:01:47] be in vain in this
[1:01:51] behalf that as I have said that as I
[1:01:55] said you may be
[1:01:59] ready Les happily if they of Macedonia
[1:02:02] come with
[1:02:07] me and find you
[1:02:12] unprepared we that we say not you should
[1:02:15] be
[1:02:17] ashamed that but not to
[1:02:22] say in the same confident
[1:02:28] boasting therefore I thought it
[1:02:30] necessary to exhort the
[1:02:35] Brethren that they would go before unto
[1:02:40] you and make up before your
[1:02:46] Bounty where of ye had noticed
[1:02:51] before that that same might be ready
[1:02:54] as a matter of
[1:02:57] bounty and this I
[1:03:04] say verse six verse six okay but this I
[1:03:08] say he which s sparingly shall shall
[1:03:11] reap also
[1:03:15] sparingly and he Seth bountifully shall
[1:03:18] reap also
[1:03:23] bti
[1:03:24] he's not just taking the Old Testament
[1:03:27] and but bringing us to the
[1:03:31] real quoting from the Old
[1:03:37] Testament put order that's more correct
[1:03:41] in this in this
[1:03:45] day and taking the Church of
[1:03:48] Macedonia uh like an
[1:03:51] example for the Church of the
[1:03:53] Corinthians
[1:03:56] because they were the brothers of
[1:03:58] Macedonia that they saw their
[1:04:01] need and they were
[1:04:04] supplying so that Paul could go to the
[1:04:07] Corinthians and to bring the gospel to
[1:04:10] them what time after time after time
[1:04:14] because the
[1:04:15] Corinthians because the Corinthians
[1:04:16] weren't supplying
[1:04:19] it even though
[1:04:22] Paul was putting at the moment
[1:04:25] but he was putting all his his his
[1:04:28] effort and the brothers of
[1:04:31] ma had the same
[1:04:34] spirit and they gave their
[1:04:36] effort they saw Paul's effort they saw
[1:04:39] Paul's
[1:04:41] efforts and God anointed
[1:04:45] them to supply their
[1:04:48] needs for
[1:04:50] others for other
[1:04:52] churches you see
[1:04:57] it verse 7 chapter
[1:05:03] 9 every man according as he Pur
[1:05:06] purposeth in his
[1:05:07] heart so let him
[1:05:10] give
[1:05:13] not for God loveth a cheerful
[1:05:17] Giver we always uh quote that
[1:05:22] scripture but you know Paul did it in
[1:05:26] reference to the brothers in
[1:05:31] Macedonia and cheerfully uh
[1:05:36] thankfully they they uh pulled on the
[1:05:39] I'm
[1:05:41] sorry they they help they
[1:05:44] helped the ministry of
[1:05:48] Paul to take the gospel to another
[1:05:51] church to the Corinthians
[1:05:55] it wasn't for him to for
[1:05:58] them do you see
[1:06:00] it verse
[1:06:06] eight and God is able to make all grace
[1:06:09] abound toward
[1:06:14] you that you always having all
[1:06:16] sufficiency in all
[1:06:20] things may abound to every good work
[1:06:28] as it is written he had dispersed
[1:06:33] abroad that his righteousness remaineth
[1:06:41] forever now he that Min seed to the
[1:06:45] S both Minister
[1:06:49] bread for your food and multiply your
[1:06:52] seed s
[1:06:55] and increase the fruits of your
[1:06:57] righteousness
[1:06:59] Paul uh helping us to
[1:07:07] know either him or us can give too much
[1:07:10] to
[1:07:12] God we can't give enough to
[1:07:14] God or to his
[1:07:19] work that what he has given to us in
[1:07:22] righteousness
[1:07:25] and he would increase the
[1:07:27] fruits of all that we've
[1:07:30] given verse
[1:07:36] 11 being enriched in everything to all
[1:07:44] bountifulness which causes us through US
[1:07:46] Thanksgiving to
[1:07:49] God that's the
[1:07:51] reaction that when we give from the
[1:07:53] heart
[1:07:55] um a cheerful
[1:07:56] heart verse
[1:08:04] 12 for the Min administration of this
[1:08:07] service not only Supply the one of the
[1:08:11] Saints but is abundant also by many
[1:08:14] thanksgivings unto
[1:08:22] God
[1:08:30] while by the experiment of this
[1:08:31] ministration they glorify God for your
[1:08:36] professed subjection unto the gospel of
[1:08:43] Christ and for your liberal distribution
[1:08:45] unto them and unto all
[1:08:49] men and by their prayer for
[1:08:52] you
[1:08:58] which long after you for the exceeding
[1:09:00] grace of God in
[1:09:03] you Paul says thanks be unto
[1:09:07] God for his unspeakable
[1:09:10] gift in each
[1:09:13] one that that gift is not the
[1:09:17] same for
[1:09:19] some have
[1:09:22] received
[1:09:24] for some to it's to
[1:09:27] receive for others it's to
[1:09:30] give it's a
[1:09:33] cycle it's a
[1:09:35] principle in the word of
[1:09:38] God the principle
[1:09:40] is from the Old Testament to the New
[1:09:44] Testament to preach the
[1:09:46] gospel to live the
[1:09:50] gospel the order that how it's applied
[1:09:53] is
[1:09:55] distinct one was the
[1:10:02] shadow a shadow can't be seen in reality
[1:10:06] what's the shadow is given
[1:10:09] giving but when the reality comes the
[1:10:13] image Christ in us the hope of
[1:10:17] glory we see him much more
[1:10:20] clearly we see that it's God working in
[1:10:24] Ministry in in the
[1:10:26] lady in the poor in the
[1:10:32] rich Paul said from in
[1:10:35] Macedonia they were
[1:10:37] poor and from their being
[1:10:40] poor they gave
[1:10:47] all in the in the book of First
[1:10:52] Timothy
[1:10:56] First Timothy uh chapter
[1:11:00] 3 Paul is speaking of the
[1:11:03] men that these are the men that who are
[1:11:07] worthy to receive the
[1:11:10] tithings and
[1:11:13] offerings this is the
[1:11:18] order not just to have a title to make
[1:11:20] you
[1:11:22] Worthy
[1:11:25] it has to be a life that you are
[1:11:28] living you have to be an example that
[1:11:30] you're
[1:11:33] giving in your place like as you're when
[1:11:36] you're in
[1:11:40] church and it's for the whole fivefold
[1:11:45] Ministry for deacons and the elders in
[1:11:48] the in the
[1:11:49] church it's for the um head of each home
[1:11:56] First Timothy chapter
[1:12:00] 3 uh this is a true saying
[1:12:05] process if a man desire the office of a
[1:12:08] bishop he desires the good
[1:12:11] work
[1:12:15] but a bishop then must be
[1:12:19] blameless the husband of one wife
[1:12:24] not like a minister
[1:12:28] said what that signifies brother
[1:12:32] Daniel that means one wife at a time
[1:12:35] that's what it signifies you
[1:12:38] see not two at the same
[1:12:41] time no you can you can get married
[1:12:44] again if that doesn't work
[1:12:47] out but it can only be one at a time no
[1:12:52] brother
[1:12:56] I have parents that are Catholic that
[1:12:58] have fulfilled that relatives relatives
[1:13:01] I'm sorry
[1:13:06] relatives and I have Pagan relatives

[1:13:16] just spoken to you something's not right
[1:13:22] there says
[1:13:26] and Paul
[1:13:27] begins and he begins to put all the
[1:13:32] requirements requirements because he was
[1:13:34] um anointed of
[1:13:37] God because he was the
[1:13:40] angel of the age of
[1:13:43] Ephesus because he was the first
[1:13:45] prophet uh to the

[1:19:44] deacon being found
[1:19:49] blameless in the fivefold

[1:19:54] and and also the F
[1:19:57] Ministry and the
[1:20:00] deacons the ministry of the church Paul
[1:20:04] says he gave us the
[1:20:08] details with a word he affirms it if
[1:20:12] they are
[1:20:14] ireh if they are blameless if they are
[1:20:21] blameless even so must their wives be
[1:20:25] grave not slanderers

[1:20:57] degree and great
[1:21:01] boldness in the faith which is in Christ
[1:21:05] Jesus these things I
[1:21:09] write I write these unto thee hoping to
[1:21:11] come unto thee
[1:21:13] shortly but if if I car
[1:21:18] long that thou mayest know how to arest
[1:21:20] to behave thyself
[1:21:24] Paul putting the new
[1:21:29] order for us that are of the um the it's
[1:21:34] ours ours as lay members as lay members
[1:21:38] are tithing and offering our tithing and
[1:21:45] offering but it also falls on the
[1:21:48] ministry also like
[1:21:51] the like you the
[1:21:55] member you have to prove the
[1:21:57] ministry if if he's
[1:22:00] worthy of the tithes and the offerings
[1:22:04] of the
[1:22:06] Lord if you're not
[1:22:09] worthy find somebody that is
[1:22:15] worthy not because they yell loud
[1:22:18] they're are
[1:22:19] worthy Paul
[1:22:21] says
[1:22:23] Paul says ireh they have to be
[1:22:33] blameless the level is very
[1:22:36] high by the word of
[1:22:39] God a lot of times the same
[1:22:42] church brings down the
[1:22:46] standard of the ministry for the
[1:22:48] ministry no correct that's not
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:55] Paul
[1:22:56] says verse
[1:23:02] 15 but if I te long that thou mayest
[1:23:05] know how thou oughtest to behave
[1:23:12] thyself the house of God which is the
[1:23:15] Church of the Living God the
[1:23:21] pillar and without controversy great is
[1:23:24] the mystery of
[1:23:26] godliness God was manifest In the
[1:23:30] Flesh justified in the
[1:23:32] spirit seen of the
[1:23:36] Angels preached unto the
[1:23:38] Gentiles believed on in the
[1:23:41] worlded up to
[1:23:45] Glory only one man fulfilled all of
[1:23:50] this it was not an apostle
[1:23:54] it was not one
[1:23:56] Pastor it wasn't a
[1:24:00] teacher wasn't an
[1:24:02] evangelist not even a
[1:24:05] prophet even so uh who who fulfilled
[1:24:11] this it was the refilling fullness the
[1:24:14] fullness I'm
[1:24:16] sorry of the fivefold
[1:24:19] ministry it was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:23] Christ in
[1:24:24] us the hope of
[1:24:27] glory in only
[1:24:31] him only
[1:24:33] him only the Lord Jesus
[1:24:37] Christ is worthy of his
[1:24:40] Tidings and of his
[1:24:43] offerings from the
[1:24:45] heart always
[1:24:47] give give your tithes and offerings to
[1:24:50] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:54] clearly you're giving to to the uh hands
[1:24:57] of a
[1:24:59] man but you have to have the
[1:25:02] confidence that the man is going to be
[1:25:05] just that what what pertains to God what
[1:25:08] belongs what belongs to
[1:25:13] God and only the
[1:25:16] portion what
[1:25:20] corresponds you know in the old test
[1:25:25] the burnt offerings of the burnt
[1:25:26] offering that they
[1:25:29] did a lot of
[1:25:33] those it didn't touch the it didn't
[1:25:36] touch the Levites they didn't belong it
[1:25:38] didn't belong to the Levites the
[1:25:43] tithing of the burnt
[1:25:47] offerings it was 100% to
[1:25:51] Jehovah
[1:25:55] there was distinct offerings
[1:25:58] given of
[1:26:03] those of the Levites could only take one
[1:26:09] portion that God had spoken through the
[1:26:14] Moses and of A TRU the
[1:26:17] Tiding it was a Tiding of the
[1:26:20] Tiding that would come to the house of
[1:26:22] of
[1:26:24] God now the L
[1:26:31] Aon they were responsible for 100% of
[1:26:34] what came into the
[1:26:36] church but 100% didn't belong to
[1:26:40] them only one
[1:26:42] portion it was a
[1:26:45] tenth of the ti a tithing of the tithing
[1:26:47] a 10 of the 10th of aund of the 100
[1:26:50] person that was a
[1:26:55] shadow the principle
[1:27:00] is the one that preaches the
[1:27:03] gospel that he lives the
[1:27:07] gospel now the example that Paul gave
[1:27:15] us the ad mestation that uh the lord
[1:27:19] gave
[1:27:21] us
[1:27:24] that he gave to his 12 disciples the 12
[1:27:28] apostles that
[1:27:30] you that you keep yourself in the
[1:27:34] word preach the
[1:27:38] gospel and I'll take care of the
[1:27:41] rest they would go with a
[1:27:43] robe one one
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:51] robe take one pair of shoes a pair of
[1:27:57] shoes don't take gold or
[1:28:01] silver
[1:28:05] nothing and I'll take care of
[1:28:09] you
[1:28:12] go concentrating
[1:28:15] 100% And preaching the
[1:28:17] gospel nothing
[1:28:21] else but now they're uh worried or
[1:28:27] concerned Brothers you you
[1:28:30] know you know everything
[1:28:33] costs if they're inviting
[1:28:36] me
[1:28:38] gas the
[1:28:41] hotel the three
[1:28:43] meals and everything else that
[1:28:45] comes you
[1:28:50] see if I forget my ti I got to buy a new
[1:28:54] tie you have to give me a
[1:28:57] guarantee before I
[1:28:59] go no
[1:29:01] brother it'd be better that you didn't
[1:29:04] come with that
[1:29:11] attitude never go to
[1:29:14] preach with that
[1:29:17] attitude if God is sending
[1:29:20] you
[1:29:24] that you go concentrating preaching the
[1:29:27] gospel praying
[1:29:31] Lord those that have a need
[1:29:34] this that are in Congo AFA in South
[1:29:39] Africa in in um
[1:29:43] England in
[1:29:46] France what need do they
[1:29:49] have they're all different cultures
[1:29:56] but Lord your your word has something
[1:29:57] for each one of
[1:30:02] those but if you go
[1:30:06] thinking I want to
[1:30:09] know how much they're going to give
[1:30:14] me you tear up the
[1:30:19] pattern that Jesus left for his
[1:30:21] disciples
[1:30:22] and
[1:30:24] Paul and for the fivefold
[1:30:28] ministry it was the same
[1:30:30] advice it was the same
[1:30:34] order that he
[1:30:37] put that the Holy Spirit put in
[1:30:45] order Gracia just you you don't have it
[1:30:48] there maybe you do I'm going add it
[1:30:52] later all the way to the
[1:31:03] top no
[1:31:04] quote no okay you can read it here
[1:31:07] that's okay read I read in Spanish
[1:31:09] here's
[1:31:15] English God will provide the
[1:31:18] works if you'll just walk in Grace
[1:31:24] you'll be more at
[1:31:32] work than you are right
[1:31:37] now with the ladies a
[1:31:42] society and all this other
[1:31:46] nonsense added into the
[1:31:49] church soup suppers to pay the
[1:31:53] preacher ever get such a thing as that
[1:31:55] in
[1:31:57] scripture pays the
[1:32:01] preacher heed to live by the ties of the
[1:32:04] people now
[1:32:07] but the prophet
[1:32:11] said he said that we he should live by
[1:32:13] the ties of the
[1:32:16] people but now they've interpret that to
[1:32:20] say the the ties belong to the pastor
[1:32:24] and they put a period
[1:32:26] there all the
[1:32:28] tidings
[1:32:31] see you've heard ministers
[1:32:36] say oh we didn't get enough
[1:32:40] offering to pay the rent of the
[1:32:46] building they didn't give
[1:32:50] enough now I'm going to have to use my
[1:32:54] tithes and and with not a good attitude
[1:32:57] he
[1:33:01] says you
[1:33:04] see but it's not like
[1:33:07] that the prophet
[1:33:09] said for 17
[1:33:11] years like a
[1:33:16] pastor I never received a salary
[1:33:20] myself
[1:33:22] it's because it was a a small uh uh
[1:33:25] Church a small town people people I'm
[1:33:31] sorry and there was uh not
[1:33:34] enough and I was young and and
[1:33:38] strong and I worked in the um in the
[1:33:43] force with the
[1:33:45] government I liked
[1:33:48] it and everything worked out fine you
[1:33:51] see
[1:33:55] he never became like a legalist no
[1:34:00] no he utilize the the wisdom of
[1:34:04] Paul Paul also
[1:34:07] said I worked with my
[1:34:09] hands to to take to take care of
[1:34:13] myself to take the gospel
[1:34:19] clearly Paul got a received a lot of
[1:34:24] help especially in the last
[1:34:27] years because the last years of his
[1:34:30] life he was in
[1:34:32] prison in this prison to
[1:34:39] other for many years he was in prison to
[1:34:43] the
[1:34:44] government and the brothers will come
[1:34:47] why are you in the
[1:34:49] prisons and why
[1:34:53] because because of those prisons in
[1:34:54] those prisons in those
[1:34:56] prisons they wouldn't give him to
[1:35:00] eat they wouldn't ex change of
[1:35:04] clothes the brothers
[1:35:11] would he would be concerned
[1:35:14] of to take the
[1:35:17] gospel and when he couldn't go
[1:35:20] anymore
[1:35:22] there were other young
[1:35:24] men that that rose
[1:35:27] up the uh Apostolic
[1:35:32] um to take the
[1:35:36] gospel that Paul had given unto
[1:35:39] them Timothy
[1:35:42] Titus
[1:35:44] Deus and the list was very
[1:35:47] long and Paul mentions their
[1:35:50] names and men that were
[1:35:53] fa men that were
[1:35:56] blameless men that
[1:36:00] went that they would they would stand in
[1:36:02] front of
[1:36:05] death they would take the
[1:36:07] gospel there was a large list long
[1:36:11] list of
[1:36:13] men
[1:36:16] Apostles ordered of the ministry
[1:36:18] ordained of the
[1:36:20] ministry
[1:36:22] of apostle
[1:36:23] Paul in the
[1:36:26] beginning these
[1:36:28] men anointed of the Holy Spirit called
[1:36:31] of
[1:36:33] God the last thing that they were
[1:36:37] thinking who's going to pay for my my uh
[1:36:40] Journey my my trip no they weren't
[1:36:43] thinking
[1:36:46] that they would
[1:36:48] go and the the majority maity of
[1:36:53] it they were martyred for the for the
[1:36:56] cause of Christ but
[1:37:01] now you
[1:37:04] know the prophet
[1:37:07] said the
[1:37:11] preacher he should live for the tithes
[1:37:13] of the
[1:37:15] preacher he's to live by the ties of the
[1:37:18] people sorry
[1:37:25] but we had to get something else to
[1:37:30] do we had to put our part into
[1:37:42] it and they couldn't just make it up
[1:37:44] their another Society will do
[1:37:48] it God's way is
[1:37:50] right
[1:37:52] ties and
[1:37:54] offerings goes to the
[1:37:56] Levi which is the
[1:37:59] minister if everybody would pay their
[1:38:05] ties you wouldn't have to have any soup
[1:38:09] suppers to pay the
[1:38:12] preacher see they've adopted something
[1:38:16] else and they've left t uh to leave the
[1:38:19] tidings off
[1:38:23] say that you say that's of the Old
[1:38:26] Testament I an argument I'd like to see
[1:38:29] you prove it to me that's
[1:38:32] right you can't do it by God's
[1:38:36] word it's also a new testament
[1:38:40] order God made one
[1:38:42] order it can never be
[1:38:46] changed it has to remain that
[1:38:49] way so will be so it'll be the word of
[1:38:55] God now in
[1:39:01] closing and that would be in uh go to
[1:39:03] Matthew uh chapter 10 verse
[1:39:10] 5 and it
[1:39:16] says and these 12 Jesus sent forth and
[1:39:19] commanded them saying
[1:39:23] go not into the way of
[1:39:26] Gentiles and into any city of the
[1:39:28] Samaritans enter you
[1:39:33] not but go rather to the lost sheep of
[1:39:36] the House of
[1:39:39] Israel to heal the
[1:39:41] sick cleanse the
[1:39:43] lepers raise the

[1:40:43] people that they
[1:40:45] they that's in it's
[1:40:48] God working in both sides
[1:40:51] in the
[1:40:53] ministry and the people of
[1:40:57] God the
[1:40:59] ministry it has they have to
[1:41:04] concentrate and to dedicate
[1:41:06] themselves in their
[1:41:09] knees to search in the
[1:41:12] scriptures to search in the Lamb's Book
[1:41:14] of

[1:41:19] the people
