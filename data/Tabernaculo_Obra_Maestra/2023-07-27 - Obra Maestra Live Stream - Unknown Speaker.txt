on the subject we had started we began part one The Pale Horse Rider in the Days of Elijah and the subject who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed foreign and last week so we're thankful tonight for everyone here estamos we greet all the god saints that are listening and we begin here tonight on on part two so if you'll stand with me here tonight and we'd like to read a scripture and want to begin uh there in Revelations chapter six [Music] Revelations chapter six is is what the the vision of John and it was a vision of what he called the first seal is and it unfolded to Seven Seals and Seven Seals is forever it's been a a confusion because it's a book of symbols so John was a prophet of God not just an apostle but a prophet he pastored the Ephesians God used them in many ways but he used them in this special way to write this book by vision is not the first time God has used someone for them Moses wrote the first five books of the of the Bible says Moses wrote the Book of Genesis he wrote it with great details because he saw it by Vision just like John at the Book of Revelation apocalypses and God's man God's prophets God's men God's prophets and God's prophets they wrote my vision foreign and that's how this book was written from Genesis so it wasn't something new that God was doing here with John it was the pattern of his work that he'd followed since the beginning so Revelation 6 Revelation says and verse one person as we read and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it was the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see because let's pray Heavenly Father Celestial what we need tonight is the author of the book and the book is called the Lamb's Book of Life so if you the lamb will come tonight you can reveal your book to us Lord so we thank you for this and we expect you to have you on the scene we ask it in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated Revelation 6 1. and John says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals shared with you I'll share with you often yeah [Music] Seven Seals is seven parts of one divine plan Divino of salvation of redemption of Revelation the Revelation for you as an individual it's not designed for a whole group Revelation is designed for one on one Revelations you and God Alone how Revelation comes we might be in a small congregation and yet God can be revealing something to you at that moment that no one else is catching you might be that one in a Congregation of a thousands you might be you might be that one in the congregation of 10. but you're catching Revelation because this book of Prophecy it was about having a personal experience with Jesus Christ with that said will hundreds and thousands be part of the Bride of Jesus Christ then here in this book of Revelations where it says and it came to pass no excuse me Revelation 6 1. this is then I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it was the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and it would come and see see it is not an evangelist not an apostle not a pastor Pastor it was it was to be a teaching but it was to be the teaching of a man who was the entire faithful Ministry is which was Jesus Christ but the one that he was using here was the Teaching Ministry one of the four beasts said come and see I'm going to teach you something so for this to unfold as we said before the lamb had to be present it's part of the division there was a noise of Thunder yes there was a noise of Thunder one of the Forbes it was a teaching he was about to bring pertaining to their day okay a teaching that would help them to recognize their day and their message and we realized that the the the the Beast that was here that it was speaking of in this in this scripture that it was the first seal so this was the first living creature which was The Lion and the lion was the lion of the tribe of Judah is the first seal part one is the first coming of Christ and the one that was going to be doing the teaching he was going to bring a teaching from the Lamb's Book of Life The Lion was going to bring a teaching out of the Lamb's Book of Life because in the Lamb's Book of Life was salvation and Redemption for Israel and in the Lamb's Book of Life foreign [Music] for all nationalities so the lion was going to teach out of this Lamb's Book of Life this was the book that was being opened and these are the seven parts of that book that were going to be revealed and it was going to create a whole new testament a New Covenant of redemption for Adam's Fallen Race So Revelation 6 1. verse 2 says Revelation 6 6 2 and I saw him Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow so this white horse rider this white horse rider with this bow and this Crown he went out conquering so these were Tools in his hands I'll tell you now we'll explain in the future the bow was was was Israel the bow was the Jude the the judeaic church the bowl was the high priest of Israel and the crown was Pagan Rome so with Pagan Rome in his hand and the high priest of Israel in his hand Lucifer Lucifer Satan was going to use them to try to close the book that is seven parts of redemption wouldn't unfold so that God's people wouldn't be saved so Redemption would not start but one starts once God starts a plan unfolding no man no devil not even the Devil Himself can stop God's plan is a plan when God decides I'm coming down to save you and to change you and to make you my son and daughter nothing can stop that plan and the Lord himself the Bible says that shout was the Forerunner Ministry it had begun Redemption had begun Revelations Revelation 6 1-2 was the vision of what John thought Revelation 6 1 and 2. Revelations was the vision of what John thought was a future event when in fact it was present tense and what's happening is even as he was seeing the vision when he saw the vision of the church ages and the Ephesian age it was already unfolding it had been unfolding for 30 40 years and even as he was seeing the vision and would continue to unfold this vision of the first sealed would continue to unfold for the next 300 years you see prophecies have a life span just like you and I 70 years old 80 years old well the Visions are the same way and this vision of the first seal is from the time it started to the time that it would everything would come to pass that was going to come to pass in that vision would be 300 years so Visions have a lifespanic and and Revelations five when John saw it it had been unfolding for 4 000 years in only five verses that's how God writes his Bible and Revelations 5 has not expired yet yet God still has a representation like a lamb slain forever interceding for our sins for our healing for our salvation for our joy foreign for our character change for our body change Revelations five is still a vision it's still an effect right now Revelation six is the vision of this of part one it was only two verses but what's going to happen now when we go to the scripture in the New Testament where this came to where this Vision opened up then God's Gonna add more details that John didn't write now Jesus is going to add more detail to the opening of this first seal okay he's going to add more verses [Music] as we spoke to you on Revelation 7. I mean as we spoke to you in Revelation the revelations on the seventh seal but when you let your fingers do the walking through the Bible Pages and you put scripture and prophecy together then he told us that Revelations 10. was the seventh seal so now we don't just have one detail one verse in Revelation they won talking of the seventh seals now he's added 11 more verses describing the description of the things that will happen under that silent opening the the las cosas so here in this this word of God we're ministering the white horse rider in the Days of Elijah and the pale horse rider yeah in the Days of Elijah you say well which one is it brother Daniel it's both because the White Horse Road and the first coming of Christ Road at the first coming of Christ and the pale horse rider is riding at the second coming of Christ so it's both we will we stick with the biblical pattern we stay in the word we don't use human reasoning by the grace of God now revelation 6. in its reality in Matthew 11 is open what's that video redemption's plan had begun so no more under the law and the prophets God had come on preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand of the words that were coming out of the mouth can be forgiven and and more detail will be added to the baptism until we would even have a name in which we could do this ritual and be bound by a covenant and be born again the bride of Christ we went down a sinner we went down uh the devil's wife Bahamas and we rose up the bride of Christ we got a new husband born again Matthew 11 1. Jesus teaching on the first coming of Christ now you say what do you mean Jesus teaching on the first coming of Christ Jesus wasn't he there hasn't hadn't he come yes see but they didn't know him they didn't know what was unfolding before them they didn't realize that that Day scriptures they hadn't recognized as Isaiah 7. they hadn't recognized him that is Isaiah 9. he said yes they didn't realize he was Isaiah 53. [Music] they didn't realize that this was Messiah oh my God from the teacher himself who was the author of the book that little song he is here now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples now John had already understood that he must decrease and Christ must increase but yet it was a very difficult thing for him to go through in in reality he says and there he was laying in prison knowing he'd be beheaded in a few more days and he sent two of his disciples and verse verse 3 says can said unto them art thou he that should come or do we look for another now remember the way it started in verse one so then I came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples disciples he departed dance to teach and preach in their cities what was it it was the line of the tribe of Judah it's Revelation 6 1. and when John heard in the prison The Works of Christ verse two he had only two of his disciples foreign to them or tell he that should come or do we look for another para president a prophet said this this prophet's eyes had become dimmed over for the trial he was going through and Matthew 11 4 Jesus answered and said unto them Go and show John again it wasn't the first time that John had recognized the ministry and its Vindication he said Go and show John again in other words Jesus had already spoken to him before on this so Jesus answered and sent them to him go and show John again those things which you do here foreign these details that are under the opening of this first seal these details that are under the opening of part one of redemption that are under the opening of part one of redemption it's the same things that would repeat under the opening of the seventh seals because the first seal is his first coming as the seventh seal is the second coming now watch the pattern here that will repeat in our day when we get to wandering is this was this the Forerunner this morning and Jesus tells them go tell John this [Music] [Music] and it repeated in our days again so that we could know and recognize second coming of Christ Jesus is now adding detail Jesus to the opening of the first seal of part one of how it would open how would it be unfolding and how we could recognize the opening of the second coming in our days recognize the opening of the seventh seal in our day he's telling us the process of the opening of the seal part one of the Plan of Redemption salvation restoration why under the opening of these seals a man and a woman can find happiness in a marriage it's part of the promise it's part of this Redemption it's part of your your personal experience with Christ experience he can make you the man that a woman that loves God will want to be with under the opening of this word under this Lamb's Book of Life Book of Life foreign [Music] you were speaking to a great multitude of people and that Spirit discerned yeah that they were offended in this teaching verse 7 says and as they departed because they were offended and Jesus that discerned it I can discern that you're offended with this what I'm telling you and they begin to depart and then Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John yeah verse 7 what went down to the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the Wind Raymond okay Salis is where soft Raymond are in King's houses that introduced him but what went down to see a prophet yes I say unto you and more than a prophet is because he was a forerunner to the first coming of Christ and in all the billions of people that would be born in the world and all the ministers that God would raise up there would only be two men whom God would choose to foreign Matthew 11 10. for this because he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face shall prepare thy way before thee Jesus was identifying John Jesus identification is Jesus was going to the word and saying this is that that the prophet spoke of Malachi 3 that's John and it's unfolding right here before your very eyes that offends the people yes that offends the religious community that offends the denominations to put a name on the scripture and saying this man is that scripture and this day this word is fulfilled only a true Born Again believer in Christ can actually accept that kind of a message behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple behold I will send my messenger Lord means god Elohim and the Lord whom you seek suddenly come to his Temple yeah what was the Lord's Temple behold the Virgin shall conceive and a temple will be made by the spoken word and the temple will be the body of a man and that man will be called The Son of God yes and in that body called the Son of God and and in that body yes called the Son of God will be the fullness of the Gods the Lord will shall suddenly come to that Temple see how this Bible is even the messenger of the Covenant because remember Revelations 5 Seconds behold one sat on the throne yeah then he says and a strong Angel then came God for Redemption then it says then he was looking for a man who was worthy to open that book and when he couldn't find no man and John webbed then one of the elders said don't weep John the father is willing to descend lower to get closer to his children so he's going to descend to his Temple is the line of the tribe of Judah as Jesus Christ of Nazareth and God kept descending so from this from from the Lord whom you seek who will certainly come to his Temple then it says even the messenger of the Covenant because it was from the messenger of the Covenant to God made flesh that God changes behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts this will say even the messenger of the Covenant okay so Jesus identified John Jesus identification as Malachi 3. as this messenger in verse 11 versions of Matthew 11. Jesus says verily I say unto you now he's comparing John to everyone that was ever born of a woman which is all of us saying he's the greatest but then he said notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than him now he's comparing John to the smallest insignificant believer in Christ and Saint John is least in that one because it was a example unto us it was that that God's ministers would be the people's servants uh for we have only one Lord and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force Jesus identifies himself to Jesus identifies John as the Elijah Ministry Jesus is preaching on his first coming Jesus but that he's here now it's coming to pass you're living in the day when this scripture is coming to pass now in verse 12 verse and from the days of John the Baptist until now history tells us and no one can put an exact date on it is of how long the ministry of John was it could have been a few months it could have been three years but it was a very short Ministry but from the days of John the Baptist a and until now the day that Jesus is preaching to them he says the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence those that are following John and being baptized they're the ones suffering the Violence by the violent ones who are taking them by force putting them in jail and physically dividing their families up and killing them there's that writer there's that writer who went forth conquering and to conquer are taking it by force this is the white horse rider of Revelation 6 2. of Revelation 6 2. anointing the bow and the crown anointing the Jewish or Orthodox priesthood anointing the Jewish or Orthodox priesthood um and the Caesar of pagan Rome to go out conquering with violence this little flock is called The Bride of Jesus Christ and the pattern of Genesis repeats the violent one came took the kingdom of God by force and killed his brother we see the pattern of God's word and as you read through your Old Testament um all the way to the days of the first coming of Christ this little flock called The Bride of Jesus Christ the pattern of Genesis repeats remember Isaiah 53 seconds which is also the opening of the first seal it adds more details to what was taking place under this opening say you Isaiah 53 and 9 as we read last Sunday it says can he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth he said to support in him was no violence Jesus Christ can his followers was no violence yeah for they believed him on his message of perfection when he said blessed are the peacemakers he didn't say blessed are the peacemakers but if you have to be violent I understand he didn't say that he didn't teach that what about John's followers who repented and were baptized in Luke chapter 3 Lucas verses 10 to 16. John was baptizing at the River Jordan people were repenting and giving their hearts to the Lord they were tired of the violence some of these people and once they were baptized they realized they needed something else and the people in verse 10 of Luke 3 he says and the people asked him saying what shall we do then now that we've repented now that we've been baptized in the name of Jesus he answered and said unto them let him do likewise then came also the publicans to be baptized and then once they were baptized they also had a question in their hearts Master but what what shall we do you know what kind of work we do we're Jews but we're Tax Collectors for Rome you know everyone hates us for that so no more than what is appointed you 13 verse 13. and he said unto them exact no more than what is appointed you is they found peace not only had they were they repented and baptized but the burden and question in their heart what do we do now how should our lives change now that we've accepted this baptism what shall we do you know we're not just regular folks we're not publicans he said we're soldiers we're soldiers for Rome we're soldiers of the synagogues he said unto them to You Soldiers to You Soldiers I want to tell you what to do now do violence yeah do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely as they content with your wages as soldiers they were taught foreign this isn't enough for the kind of men we have to be foreign foreign so when the Bible said when Jesus said and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence it wasn't the Disciples of Jesus he taught them different it wasn't the Disciples of John no foreign with a bow in one hand the Jewish the Jewish high priest of Israel is he was the bow the Jewish church was the bow they were the Violent ones and the Caesar of Rome both of them enemies both in the hands of Lucifer being anointed by the most violent OS now the scene is unfolding now we see Matthew 11. it was Jesus on the Jesus opening the book and showing I'm here I've come and all the prophecies the prophet is changing Ministry and forms to bring Salvation to give you an eye a personal experience with Jesus Christ to reveal to us the foreign to a personal experience and you can have that every time you read your Bible say Lord dear dying lamb of calvary build more of your word to me it's a read of a verse tonight as only you can in him was no violence in John was an awareness so the violent one um Jesus preaching on the first coming of Christ identified the Forerunner in China and then identified that the ride of the white horse rider yeah perfect perfecto and this is the amazing thing this is Matthew 11 13 was about A.D 30-34 it was the year ad 30. John wasn't on the island s foreign until A.D 67. so when when Jesus is unfolding the mystery part one of the factors The Book of Revelations wasn't even written yet it wasn't going to be written for another 40 years that means that what Jesus was doing in Matthew wasn't by the way of the written word it was the it was by way of the spoken word because a thunder a prophet told us is the voice of God when a seal is opening the first seals it didn't have to be ready it was the time it was the season and God was unfolding the plan that was in his mind for the foundation and it wasn't even written yet remember Revelations 10 7. Revelations 10 4. yes and when seven Thunders had uttered their voices they say you see it's not even written it's like we see a principle in the word of God when it comes time for God to bring his word to pass how can he bring it to pass if it's not written in this Bible because everything written in this Bible was the thought in the mind of God before the foundation of the world he speaks it and it comes to pass God created the heavens and the Earth Genesis 1. and it wasn't even written yet because Moses didn't write the book okay until almost 2500 years later can we deny he created the heavens and the Earth did it happen did it have to be written or did it just have to be the time and God says Now's the Time just like for every one of us Spirit swept down of course he says now is the time I'm going to change your life [Music] foreign [Music] to give you more than hope when you read one scripture and wonder is this all that the Bible has to say about this is know this the answer is no God has scripture and word upon word to add more details that's why Prophet said okay you can't take one scripture and put a period you got to put it because it's word upon word up online then he would give us an example he says let me give you an example the Bible says Judas went and hung himself foreign this precious book of the Bible unfolding this Lamb's Book of Life concerning the Lamb's Book of Life Isaiah 53 was the opening Isaiah 53 is the first coming of Christ Isaiah 53. part of part one to this person and the detail he added about this seal yeah that it was going to be a new message and he says in Isaiah 53 1. who have believed our report foreign uh and you could only catch it by the Lamb of God it'll have to be if you and I are going to make a Rapture stay young going to take a personal experience it's going to take career personal experience with Jesus Christ Heavenly Father we thank you as we believe we're growing and maturing in Christ each and every day is and we ask you to come on the scene and you give us deliverance and you bring peace to our hearts again and we realize that we received another refilling of your spirit you're lifting us up brotherly kindness a friendship restored with the fatherism it's called sons and daughters being adopted we thank you Lord for this great word you brought us this great Plan of Redemption foreign amen so brother Kenny would come let's just sing that song Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound saved or Rich like me I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see [Music] great [Music] [Applause] [Music] but now [Music] I see was Grace [Music] and how places [Music] praise the Lord I just wanted to say that um if we can remember my mother-in-law she went to Albuquerque she went to Albuquerque we could just remember her in prayer and I just wanted to say one more thing in regards to the what I shared with a friend of mine from Ryder he is in remission he does have a couple more tests to take but um if you would just remember him as well he was very very excited about the turnout and I I don't know I he's he I believe he has faith uh and and I and I believe that um God has has done something for him and so we could just remember him his name is Mitch um I believe I'm believing that he's going to come back to work because he's been gone for three or four months now um and um I believe he's going to testify to those men around him [Music] that God is alive and and so that's the reason why I wanted to part of the reason why I wanted to share that with you is that as believers trust and know that God is alive we believe that he is but it when we pray we need to believe that not only does he does he hear us but he does answer sometimes it's not always the way we want it but there are times it he does answer the prayer and so we just want to give thanks to the Lord and give him all the glory and and encourage one another with that so Lord bless you [Music] foreign I just I believe that if we'll just put our faith in the Lord there's nothing impossible I believe that with all my heart and I just love this song because it's it's it's it's it's telling us if you'll believe in God we should it shouldn't even be enough we should just believe we should just trust it with all of our hearts scripture says trust in the Lord with all your heart and lead not into your own understanding we've all come there's time for we doubt I'm not saying that I don't doubt I'm just saying though I'm letting you know what the scripture says and that's where we that's where we put our faith in is his word so let's sing this song for the glory of God [Music] foreign [Music] opportunity [Music] [Music] feel like this Hallelujah [Music] brother Umber muy Feliz de vertermano is we
