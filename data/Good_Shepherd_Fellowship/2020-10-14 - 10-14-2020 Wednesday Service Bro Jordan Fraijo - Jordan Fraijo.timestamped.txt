[21:31] [Music]
[21:42] oh
[21:48] amen we want to be in that number when
[21:51] the saints go marching in
[21:53] you know and by faith we're already
[21:56] in that number it's not wanting to be in
[21:58] the number or looking to be in the
[22:00] number
[22:00] or hoping we'll be in the number but
[22:02] even now we can start looking around
[22:04] and we start counting and know that
[22:06] we're a part of that number
[22:08] as we speak it's not something we hope
[22:10] for it's something we identify with
[22:14] amen we're going to go ahead and
[22:17] go right into the service here the
[22:19] ministering of the word musicians
[22:21] go ahead and be seated let's just stand
[22:24] for the reading of the word
[22:25] and we'll get right into it if you'll
[22:27] turn with me to
[22:29] revelations chapter three
[22:32] let's have a little thought tonight
[22:44] revelations chapter 3 verse 20.
[22:53] and it reads behold i stand
[22:56] at the door and knock if any man
[23:00] hear my voice and open the door i will
[23:03] come in to him
[23:04] and will sup with him and he with me to
[23:08] him that overcometh will i grant to sit
[23:10] with me
[23:10] in my throne even as i also overcame
[23:14] and am set down with my father in his
[23:16] throne
[23:18] he that hath an ear let him hear
[23:21] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[23:24] let's pray
[23:26] heavenly father lord we just come before
[23:27] you once again here on a wednesday night
[23:29] just thanking you for this opportunity
[23:31] lord to be gathered together with saints
[23:33] of like faith father
[23:35] lord for we know if nothing else that
[23:38] where two or three are gathered together
[23:39] in
[23:40] your name you said there i'd be also so
[23:42] just by
[23:43] gathering father lord we can come with a
[23:45] confidence knowing that you were here
[23:47] already because you came ahead of time
[23:50] anticipating knowing we would be here
[23:52] father
[23:53] so lord we just surrender ourselves into
[23:55] to your presence father both the speaker
[23:58] the hearer father
[23:59] may you take control of the body the
[24:01] mouth the lips the thoughts father
[24:03] lord may you catch the attention of the
[24:05] listener father
[24:06] lord that not to anything that would be
[24:09] said by man but father something that
[24:10] you would speak directly to the heart
[24:12] lord we just thank you for that in jesus
[24:14] name amen you may be seated
[24:18] i'm just going to take a minute and
[24:20] relax myself just a little bit
[24:23] tonight i just want to take a simple
[24:25] well i just want to take a thought
[24:27] and i hope it's simple and i just want
[24:30] to
[24:31] talk about recognizing the voice of god
[24:33] and acting on it
[24:35] and what i first began to think about
[24:39] was listening versus hearing
[24:43] now here in revelations we see two
[24:45] points here
[24:47] that both reference hearing but it's not
[24:50] just in hearing but you actually have to
[24:52] be
[24:52] listening to understand and the reason
[24:54] why we know that's important
[24:56] is because there in verse 22 he said he
[24:59] that hath an
[25:00] ear which would be everybody
[25:04] there isn't a person that has yet to be
[25:06] born without an ear
[25:08] maybe they genetically could be born
[25:10] with only one ear
[25:12] but as far as i know everyone has a ear
[25:16] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[25:19] the churches now this is very specific
[25:21] it's talking about hearing what the
[25:23] spirit is saying and it's not just
[25:25] the words but it's to catch the
[25:28] revelation
[25:29] or the understanding of what's being
[25:31] said for the age and for that time
[25:34] now if you know what's going on here in
[25:36] chapter three there at the end
[25:38] is actually speaking to the church of
[25:39] laodicea and it was during this time
[25:42] here you can see where jesus is
[25:43] specifically talking to the church of
[25:45] laodicea
[25:46] because he comes here and it's only in
[25:48] this church of laodicea where he comes
[25:50] and he says behold
[25:51] i stand at the door and knock so he's
[25:53] knocking
[25:54] there's a sound already
[25:57] that anybody should be able to hear
[26:01] but now there has to be an action
[26:03] related to that
[26:04] sound that that is heard
[26:08] in order for it to have any type of
[26:09] effect on the on the life
[26:12] it says and if any man hear my voice
[26:16] so you hear the knock it catches your
[26:18] attention
[26:20] and then you hear his voice
[26:24] and when you hear his voice then you
[26:26] have to open the door
[26:28] if you get that for far he says i will
[26:31] come in
[26:32] and will sup with him and he with me now
[26:34] you have communion
[26:36] you see but it's it's not just something
[26:38] so you'd think that something is so
[26:40] simple
[26:41] but we want to take a look at a couple
[26:44] of things tonight
[26:46] differences between listening and
[26:48] hearing we want to take a look
[26:50] at hearing god's voice all those
[26:54] saints throughout the ages who have
[26:56] heard god's voice
[26:58] some who have heeded and some who have
[27:00] not
[27:01] and what that entails and why is it
[27:04] those that heeded why did they heed
[27:08] and those who did not why did they not
[27:11] because we want to take a look at that
[27:13] and see the patterns throughout
[27:14] scripture because we know
[27:15] that there's patterns throughout
[27:16] scripture from the very beginning
[27:19] and we know that the voice of god has
[27:21] been in play
[27:22] to the believer speaking to the believer
[27:26] from the first verse it says there in
[27:29] genesis
[27:30] in the first verse it says god he spoke
[27:33] and that is what began to bring the
[27:35] light to pass it wasn't until god's
[27:37] voice actually spoke that anything began
[27:40] to change
[27:41] but it took they that
[27:44] heard it to understand the meaning
[27:48] for it to take an effect you see
[27:51] creation has no problem with the voice
[27:53] of god
[27:55] when when the voice when god speaks and
[27:57] creation hears it
[27:58] it acts it doesn't matter what it is
[28:02] only man has ever thought he had a
[28:05] better idea
[28:06] than what god was telling him to do when
[28:09] god spoke in the beginning and he said
[28:11] let there be light
[28:12] immediately there was light light didn't
[28:14] argue about how it should happen when it
[28:16] should happen
[28:17] it just light was there and begin to
[28:19] speak
[28:20] to creation and create it and bring it
[28:22] to pass and tell it how to
[28:24] function and what it should do and how
[28:25] it should go about in in the this
[28:28] creation that he had created what its
[28:30] role was no problems
[28:33] it wasn't until he got to men and he
[28:35] gave them specific instructions
[28:38] and man said you know what i think i
[28:41] know a little bit better
[28:43] you know because they heard but they
[28:45] weren't listening
[28:47] they weren't paying attention it's like
[28:48] kids right
[28:51] we you parents that's the common thing
[28:54] you say i told you and they say i heard
[28:57] i'm listening
[28:58] and then they go and do the opposite and
[29:01] you said i thought you said you were you
[29:02] you heard me well they did they heard
[29:04] you but they weren't paying no attention
[29:08] well guess what you know god lets you
[29:10] experience that
[29:12] because we've probably done that to him
[29:14] a few times
[29:16] so he's trying to teach us something you
[29:18] see if you just listen the first time i
[29:20] know what's
[29:21] best i'm giving you the my first plan
[29:24] that i
[29:25] told you in the beginning from the start
[29:28] that was the best one now due to lack of
[29:32] listening lack of understanding
[29:35] you're in the mess you are okay so
[29:39] let's take a quick look we want to take
[29:41] a look and see where with
[29:42] god speaking examples of god's voice in
[29:46] scripture
[29:47] um real quick turn with me to job 37.
[29:56] i would just use the overhead but
[30:01] i let the dog chew on my glasses
[30:05] and everything back there for me is a
[30:07] little bit blurry so
[30:08] i'm going to go the old-fashioned way
[30:11] and just turn through the pages of
[30:12] scripture
[30:14] so in job 37 1-5
[30:18] and we're wanting to know learn more
[30:21] about this voice of god
[30:24] it says at this also my heart trembleth
[30:26] and has moved out of his place
[30:28] hear attentively the noise of his voice
[30:33] so it's calling you to attention and the
[30:36] sound that goeth
[30:37] out of his mouth he directeth it
[30:40] under the whole heaven and his lightning
[30:43] unto the ends of the earth after it
[30:46] a voice roarth now you notice he talks
[30:49] about lightning going out
[30:51] but that had nothing to do with the
[30:52] voice
[30:55] there was a sign going forth but the
[30:57] voice came after
[30:59] okay and what we're doing is we're
[31:01] looking for patterns in scripture
[31:04] we want to see how do when god speaks
[31:06] how does it happen
[31:07] because we want to be aware so that when
[31:10] we will
[31:11] notice and see when it happens
[31:14] and we'll start catching the signs being
[31:16] like aha i see it
[31:19] if god is still the same yesterday today
[31:21] and forever which we know he is
[31:24] and if we believe that's true then if we
[31:26] see the signs
[31:29] coming then we can know he's about to
[31:31] speak
[31:32] now pay attention okay
[31:35] but if you don't know the signs you
[31:38] don't know
[31:39] and then you'll see through scripture
[31:41] people who didn't recognize the sign
[31:43] that he was about to speak they heard
[31:45] the sound
[31:46] they heard but they couldn't listen they
[31:49] couldn't understand
[31:50] no understanding after a voice roareth
[31:54] he thundereth with the voice of his
[31:56] excellence
[31:56] and he will not stay them when his voice
[31:59] is heard
[32:00] god thundereth marvelously with his
[32:02] voice
[32:03] great things doth he which we cannot
[32:06] comprehend
[32:07] so we see here we realize that
[32:09] lightnings and thunderings
[32:11] are associated with the voice
[32:14] but don't forget they're not the voice
[32:17] you see that's that's the thing that
[32:19] most men have done throughout the ages
[32:21] is they've confused the signs with the
[32:23] voice
[32:24] and they've run off after the signs and
[32:28] then
[32:28] the voice le it just left the voice
[32:31] behind
[32:32] and then they they find themselves
[32:33] crashed on the side of the road and they
[32:35] wonder what happened
[32:36] i was following it and no you were
[32:38] following the sign that was to lead you
[32:40] to the voice
[32:42] but if you simply run to the sign you'll
[32:45] never get to the location that's
[32:46] pointing you to
[32:48] you see you come driving into town and
[32:51] you see the big sign says minneapolis
[32:52] if you run over to the sign you're at
[32:54] the sign that tells you you're going to
[32:56] minneapolis but you're not there yet
[32:59] as long as you stay around that sign
[33:01] you'll never get there
[33:03] okay so we have some characteristics of
[33:06] the voice of god
[33:07] okay now we want to see parallels
[33:10] through scripture we want to be able to
[33:11] track it because bibraham told us he
[33:13] said if you can't
[33:14] see it throughout scripture from genesis
[33:17] to revelation whatever it is that you're
[33:19] thinking
[33:20] whatever kind of theory you got in your
[33:22] mind whatever kind of
[33:24] thought you thought was an inspiration
[33:25] if you can't take that inspiration
[33:27] and be able to track it through through
[33:29] from genesis to revelation
[33:30] he said go over and start over your
[33:32] revelation your thought is wrong
[33:36] so many times we do like like science
[33:39] likes to do
[33:41] and we take and we try to force
[33:44] something to work because we through our
[33:47] theory
[33:48] believe it should be right
[33:51] but you'll find out just like science
[33:53] they eventually either have to
[33:54] either they have to give up or they
[33:56] start they have to sell it as a lie
[34:01] and they have to start back over at zero
[34:04] they call it the scientific method but
[34:06] you'll realize that they
[34:07] they stole the scientific method out of
[34:09] the scripture
[34:12] because what they say is they say i
[34:14] think it should be this
[34:17] and then they go through all the steps
[34:18] and say is it this and if it doesn't
[34:21] then they have to call that thought
[34:25] debunked and throw it away
[34:28] and start all over again and so it is
[34:32] with
[34:32] our thoughts our abilities
[34:36] what our understanding if you take it
[34:39] and you begin to go through the
[34:40] scripture and you can't see a parallel
[34:44] with that thought then it's no good toss
[34:48] it out
[34:48] start over because the truth is here
[34:53] but the problem is is if we try and make
[34:55] our thoughts and our narrative
[34:57] fit the scripture instead of
[35:01] i'm sorry i said that backward if we try
[35:03] and make the scripture fit our thoughts
[35:05] and narrative
[35:07] then you're always going to have a
[35:08] distorted vision you're always going to
[35:10] have a distorted revelation
[35:13] and you know whose revelation it is it's
[35:15] yours but not from god
[35:17] it's from you your own thoughts your own
[35:20] ability
[35:21] and now you've gone back to where they
[35:23] failed at the garden of eden
[35:26] you're in that same standing that same
[35:28] point because the standing wasn't an
[35:30] action of sin
[35:32] because brother random told us he said
[35:34] sin has nothing to do with the actions
[35:36] that we call sin
[35:38] sin has to do with the unbelief that
[35:40] then allows for the actions to happen
[35:43] because before that unbelief the action
[35:46] would never manifest
[35:49] you see but as soon as we take our own
[35:51] thought our own word
[35:53] and we don't compare it to god's word to
[35:55] see if it's a match then we're going to
[35:58] find ourselves in that same place
[36:00] in a state of unbelief well believing
[36:02] that we're believing
[36:05] and fooling ourselves okay so
[36:08] because we want to see this throughout
[36:10] scripture then let's turn
[36:12] to saint john 12 28
[36:15] and 32.
[36:21] okay now here jesus is
[36:25] speaking to the people
[36:28] and he's giving them a parable of his
[36:31] death and resurrection
[36:33] and then in 28
[36:37] he says father glorify thy name
[36:41] then there came a voice from heaven
[36:43] saying
[36:44] i have both glorified it and will
[36:46] glorify it again
[36:48] the people thereof that stood by and
[36:51] heard it
[36:51] said it thundered others said
[36:55] an angel spake to him jesus answered and
[36:58] said this voice
[36:59] came not because of me but for your sake
[37:03] now is the judgment of this world
[37:07] now shall the prince of this world be
[37:09] cast out
[37:10] and i if i be lifted up from the earth
[37:12] will draw all men
[37:14] unto me now there's some key things to
[37:17] take away from this
[37:18] first of all it was a difference of
[37:21] understanding and revelation
[37:25] that changed what the people heard
[37:28] everybody there heard something
[37:31] everybody in the group
[37:32] just like right now everyone in this
[37:35] room who hears the sound of my voice
[37:36] everyone is hearing something
[37:38] right now if you were somewhere
[37:43] and the speaker was speaking in a
[37:45] language unknown to you
[37:48] would you still be hearing him
[37:51] yes would you have any understanding of
[37:54] what was being said
[37:56] no so therefore hearing
[38:00] is based on your level of and the
[38:03] hearing
[38:06] but the understanding is based on your
[38:08] ability
[38:10] to understand the speaker and not just
[38:14] your ability to hear
[38:16] because here everybody heard the whole
[38:17] group and some said
[38:19] it thundered they heard to them it was
[38:22] thunder
[38:23] you would never be able to convince them
[38:24] otherwise middle of the day
[38:26] it was a phenomena they heard a thunder
[38:29] kind of strange kind of weird they can
[38:32] speculate on it
[38:33] maybe it had something to do with jesus
[38:35] maybe it didn't
[38:37] maybe it was just something else maybe
[38:39] they were mining somewhere close by
[38:42] but but they heard thunder they really
[38:45] heard thunder
[38:48] and it's still the same today you know
[38:51] many people
[38:53] within the message they still go back
[38:55] and forth
[38:56] seven seals seven thunders seven seals
[38:58] are they opened are they closed
[39:00] is it a mystery is it not a mystery well
[39:02] i tell you this
[39:04] to those who tell you it's still a
[39:06] mystery
[39:07] it is it's a mystery to them
[39:12] you know why because all they've heard
[39:13] is the thunder
[39:15] all they're hearing is the thunder they
[39:17] have not heard the voice
[39:20] because if you heard the voice then you
[39:21] would have understanding
[39:23] and it's no longer a mystery you know
[39:25] jesus would do this all the time with
[39:27] his disciples
[39:28] he would go out before the people and
[39:30] he'd speak in parables
[39:32] it wasn't even a different language
[39:36] because we know that because in
[39:38] scripture it says
[39:39] that the common man heard him gladly
[39:42] so the hearing and the language was fine
[39:46] but now the understanding was even
[39:48] greater there needed to be a greater
[39:50] understanding even beyond that
[39:52] because he had pulled his disciples away
[39:54] and explained to them the parable
[39:56] and he said i talk to them in parables
[39:58] because it's not for them to know
[40:00] but it's for you it's for you
[40:03] you know but even with that some of the
[40:06] disciples were still confused
[40:08] they still didn't know what he was
[40:10] talking about they still did
[40:12] couldn't put all the scriptures together
[40:14] and see prophecy being fulfilled
[40:18] we know that because it when it came to
[40:21] gethsemane
[40:23] there peter attacked with a sword
[40:27] and everybody else fled
[40:33] if they had a real revelation of what
[40:34] was going on there had been no reason
[40:37] for fear they would have just seen
[40:38] prophecy being fulfilled
[40:40] prophecy being fulfilled okay
[40:44] now something else to pay attention to
[40:48] 31 now is the judgment of this world
[40:52] okay
[40:56] now shall the prince of the world be
[40:58] cast out
[41:01] so the word has gone forth god has
[41:03] spoken
[41:05] some heard thunder some actually heard
[41:07] the word spoken
[41:09] but once the utterance has gone forth
[41:13] all those under the sound of the
[41:15] utterance
[41:16] fall under judgment
[41:20] you see once it's been spoken
[41:23] whether you have the ability to
[41:25] understand or not
[41:28] you're under the same judgment
[41:31] you see now now
[41:38] is the judgment of this world and now
[41:41] shall the prince of the world be cast
[41:42] out
[41:43] because once god speaks it sets things
[41:46] in motion
[41:47] and it cannot come back okay
[41:50] so now we can see we see job and we know
[41:53] jobs
[41:54] although job is in the middle we know
[41:55] job to be the oldest book in the bible
[41:58] so here he is he's it is a historian
[42:01] speak i believe that
[42:02] job is even from a time that predates
[42:05] abraham
[42:07] so here we can see something that
[42:09] predates abraham
[42:11] in the book of genesis okay
[42:14] and here's god's way his voice
[42:17] and how it's identified and we can see
[42:20] where
[42:20] and what people identify with and when
[42:23] the voice comes
[42:24] and now we come all the way into the new
[42:26] testament and we can see the same
[42:30] one more example okay that way we can be
[42:33] sure
[42:35] what should we be watching for uh first
[42:37] kings
[42:38] 19 11-13
[42:56] make sure i have this correct
[43:01] okay yes so here
[43:04] elijah has just had a tremendous victory
[43:09] against the prophets of baal
[43:12] and after this great victory he did like
[43:15] most great men
[43:16] under great inspiration do is he went
[43:19] into a big slump
[43:21] he had he was he was under the
[43:23] inspiration and power of god
[43:25] and well under that inspiration nothing
[43:28] could stand in his way
[43:29] he he would face anybody face him off
[43:32] and and tell him what for
[43:34] but the minute the spirit left him the
[43:36] guy just crumpled
[43:38] and and brother branham says under the
[43:39] threat of a woman he went running off
[43:41] into the wilderness
[43:42] here was a man who had stood there on
[43:44] mount carmel and called and seen
[43:46] fire from heaven come down and not
[43:48] consume just the offering but the stones
[43:50] of the offering in the water
[43:54] and then he had slain he had slain the
[43:56] 400 prophets of baal
[43:59] and yet now after that inspiration drops
[44:01] off
[44:03] he is just the man and under the threat
[44:07] of a single woman
[44:09] he just he just killed and slew 400 men
[44:13] under the threat of one woman he goes
[44:14] running off into the wilderness and says
[44:16] lord what uses
[44:17] it uh is it that i'm even alive take me
[44:20] take me now
[44:22] and and we know the story of how the
[44:25] angel comes to him under the
[44:27] juniper tree there and and and brings
[44:29] him sustenance and then
[44:31] without his knowledge and you know he
[44:34] just sweeps him off and takes him to
[44:35] this
[44:36] place in the wilderness away from you
[44:38] know he sought refuge
[44:40] in the wilderness but god took him to
[44:42] the place under the rock
[44:44] because he knew he would need a greater
[44:45] revelation going forward from here
[44:49] than what he had under that tree okay
[44:52] and we get here into verse 11 and he
[44:55] said go
[44:56] forth and stand upon the mount before
[44:59] the lord
[45:00] and before and the lord passed by
[45:19] ah let's actually start in verse nine
[45:22] and he came
[45:23] thither unto a cave and lodged there and
[45:25] behold the word of the lord came to him
[45:27] and he said
[45:28] what dost thou hear elijah
[45:33] so god comes to him and said elijah what
[45:35] are you doing hiding here in the
[45:36] wilderness
[45:38] what what's what's going on
[45:41] and he said i've been very jealous for
[45:43] the lord god of hosts
[45:44] for the children of israel have forsaken
[45:46] thy covenant
[45:47] thrown down thine altar and slain thy
[45:49] prophets with the sword
[45:51] and i even i only am left
[45:54] and they seek my life to take it away
[45:57] and he said go
[45:58] forth and stand upon the mount before
[46:01] the lord
[46:01] and behold the lord passed by and a
[46:04] great strong
[46:05] wind rent the mountains and break in
[46:07] pieces the rocks before the lord
[46:09] but the lord was not in the wind
[46:13] and after the wind and earthquake
[46:16] but the lord was not in the earthquake
[46:19] and after the earthquake a fire
[46:22] but the lord was not in the fire and
[46:25] after the fire
[46:26] a still small voice and it was so when
[46:30] elijah heard it
[46:31] that he wrapped his face in his mantle
[46:34] and went out
[46:35] and stood in the entering in of the cave
[46:38] and behold there came a voice unto him
[46:39] and said
[46:40] what dost thou hear elijah
[46:44] and he said i have been very jealous for
[46:46] the lord god of hosts
[46:48] because the children of israel have
[46:49] forsaken thy covenant and thrown down
[46:51] thine altars
[46:52] and slain thy prophets with the sword
[46:55] and i even
[46:56] i only am left and they seek my life to
[46:59] take it away
[47:00] and the lord said unto him go return on
[47:02] thy way to the wilderness of damascus
[47:06] and when they'll come us anoint hazel to
[47:08] be king over syria
[47:09] and that's going a little bit further
[47:13] and here the lord begins to give and
[47:14] give him instruction as to
[47:16] how to proceed how to move forward
[47:19] but you see the servant of the lord
[47:23] even in this state that he was in
[47:28] could recognize what was and what wasn't
[47:31] the voice of god you see
[47:34] and the reason why we know is because
[47:37] the minute
[47:38] that still small voice see he'd been in
[47:40] the presence of the angel
[47:44] he'd been in the presence of the angel
[47:45] and he'd heard his message
[47:49] that was previously and it was the angel
[47:51] who told him
[47:54] to go out to the cave he'd been in his
[47:57] presence
[47:57] he didn't cover his face now he goes and
[48:01] he stands there at the mount
[48:03] and said the lord passed by and when the
[48:06] lord passed by there was a great stir
[48:08] a great wind and it caused a great
[48:10] commotion
[48:13] but that still wasn't god speaking to
[48:15] elijah
[48:17] then there was an earthquake and still
[48:19] wasn't god speaking to elijah
[48:22] and then there was a fire and it still
[48:24] wasn't
[48:25] god speaking to elijah and elijah stood
[48:28] there he was unmoved
[48:31] the wind didn't affect him no
[48:35] no effect the earthquake no effect
[48:39] he was told to stand on the mountain and
[48:41] those distractions were not going to
[48:43] shake him
[48:43] from standing where he was told to stand
[48:48] it doesn't matter what it was but the
[48:51] minute the minute god began to speak
[48:55] you see how he was in humility he covers
[48:57] his face
[49:03] and the lord begins to speak to him and
[49:05] instruct him
[49:07] you see but these were all signs
[49:12] leading up to what was to come you know
[49:15] it kind of reminds me of
[49:16] another place in scripture
[49:19] it reminds me of there in the book of
[49:22] revelations of
[49:23] the end times of earthquakes and floods
[49:26] and
[49:27] and tumultuous times and and
[49:31] wars and famines
[49:34] get god's voice it's not in any of those
[49:36] things
[49:39] you know you see people affected by them
[49:41] running to and fro
[49:42] in fear every day
[49:46] something new is happening and
[49:49] and the nominal church world is is
[49:52] looking to these
[49:53] signs and and looking for meaning in
[49:57] them
[49:59] the god's voice isn't in the signs
[50:03] god is already speaking god has already
[50:05] spoke
[50:07] and many just heard thunder many just
[50:10] saw signs and miracles
[50:12] many have just seen lightning and many
[50:15] have just seen healings
[50:16] many have just seen the dead raised
[50:20] and they run after these things they run
[50:23] after it this way they run after it that
[50:25] way some great man
[50:27] some great miracle and they run after it
[50:29] and then it peters out and dies and they
[50:31] say there was nothing to it
[50:32] there was nothing to the voice of god
[50:35] and the problem is they never heard the
[50:37] voice of god
[50:39] they never heard it because they didn't
[50:42] wait
[50:43] for everything to settle down in the
[50:45] midst
[50:46] of the storm in the midst of the
[50:48] earthquake in the midst of the wind
[50:51] hear god speaking to them you see
[50:55] because if they had just like elijah
[50:57] they would have been they would have
[50:58] began to see
[51:00] what god was doing and what god was
[51:02] planning
[51:04] okay now
[51:07] we're talking about listening and
[51:09] hearing
[51:11] and differences i want to just read you
[51:14] a few things here
[51:20] i don't want to keep you too late either
[51:30] faith has informed me previously that i
[51:32] have the ability to share more than is
[51:34] necessary so you know
[51:36] if it starts getting late then somebody
[51:39] from back just wave at me
[51:42] but there's a study you know listening
[51:44] being able to listen and listen well
[51:47] and understand what it's being said is
[51:49] something that people have studied and
[51:51] re-studied and
[51:52] and taught and tried to re-teach and
[51:54] find new ways to come at it
[51:56] and look at so what i want to do is just
[51:59] take a look at
[52:00] what man has probed at
[52:03] because man probes at what god already
[52:07] knows
[52:08] and starts to identify things that god
[52:10] will already tell you
[52:12] but through some of it sometimes we can
[52:14] pull out the little nuggets
[52:16] and see how they reflect even into
[52:19] scripture
[52:20] and see how they reflect
[52:23] in the natural and the spiritual so i
[52:26] was reading
[52:26] i've actually read quite a bit about
[52:29] listening
[52:30] i think uh every time you turn around
[52:33] when you're in
[52:33] in college they're trying to teach you
[52:35] something new about communication
[52:36] but yet seems like nobody still knows
[52:38] how to communicate so i'm not sure it
[52:40] takes
[52:41] because i think nobody is listening
[52:45] and that's the problem so
[52:48] there's something called
[53:03] i don't want to read this whole thing to
[53:05] you and i just want to pull out the
[53:06] highlights and i thought i highlighted
[53:07] them but
[53:09] okay ah there's something called
[53:11] confirmation
[53:12] bias and what confirmation
[53:16] bias is is when we listen
[53:20] but we listen to affirm what we already
[53:22] think we know
[53:25] confirmation bias okay
[53:29] and they say the problem is with lag
[53:32] time in the brain they say the fastest
[53:36] somebody
[53:37] can speak is about 100 somewhere between
[53:39] 100 and 200 words a minute
[53:41] said that the brain actually has the
[53:43] ability to process between 600 and 1000
[53:46] words a minute when it's functioning
[53:48] correctly so what happens
[53:51] is that the brain is only being fed a
[53:53] minimal amount of information
[53:56] and you have all these thoughts and
[53:57] ideas yourself
[54:00] and the brain goes on a trip and now
[54:03] the brain is doing everything it can to
[54:06] figure out what's being said and whether
[54:07] or not it agrees with it
[54:10] and then he begins to pick it apart as
[54:13] best possible
[54:16] and what it does is it picks out facts
[54:19] or
[54:20] aspects of the conversation that you
[54:22] support already
[54:24] and then it hones in on that
[54:27] so what basically what it does is it
[54:30] takes
[54:30] what's being spoken and creates a tunnel
[54:32] vision
[54:34] on whatever is being told you and now
[54:36] all you're capturing is what you already
[54:38] know
[54:40] so this point in the listening process
[54:43] you have stopped learning
[54:46] and you've actually even stopped
[54:47] listening to what's being said
[54:49] because you have already decided what's
[54:51] being said
[54:53] and once you know what someone is saying
[54:56] there's no need to listen anymore
[54:58] if you know what's being said or what's
[55:00] going to be said
[55:02] what's the point it's like
[55:05] how many of you have ever been in a
[55:06] lecture or in a class
[55:09] and they have bullet points and
[55:13] an ongoing powerpoint and
[55:17] you begin to realize that the teacher is
[55:20] reading verbatim from the powerpoint
[55:25] and you have access to the powerpoint
[55:28] about how long after you realize that
[55:31] does your attention span shut off
[55:34] for me about like 30 seconds because
[55:37] then i take
[55:38] i take all of the power points and i'm
[55:40] like if this is all the teacher is going
[55:41] to give me
[55:43] i'll just read the powerpoints myself
[55:48] i don't need somebody to read to me i
[55:51] want someone to teach me
[55:53] so i have a better understanding of the
[55:55] material i'm reading
[55:56] not just read to me material i already
[55:59] have
[56:01] because many times and this is true of
[56:03] scripture as well because that's what
[56:04] happened when
[56:05] philip was there on the road to was
[56:08] transported there on the road
[56:10] with the ethiopian eunuch
[56:13] the eunuch had no problem reading the
[56:14] scripture
[56:16] but he philip came up to him said do you
[56:19] know what it is that you're reading
[56:21] he said i'm reading it but i have no
[56:23] understanding
[56:24] does the prophet speak of himself of
[56:25] someone else
[56:27] and here is what a great teacher will do
[56:30] if philip jumped in he didn't say well
[56:32] give me your bible i'm going to read it
[56:33] to you
[56:34] as many times as it takes until you
[56:36] understand it
[56:38] but no he took and began to break down
[56:41] the scripture
[56:43] in a way that the unit could understand
[56:45] and catch a revelation of it
[56:48] and then on that revelation he could now
[56:50] act
[56:51] because it's not just about hearing it's
[56:54] about listening
[56:55] and understanding and then true
[56:57] understanding and a belief will bring
[56:59] about an action
[57:00] okay so confirmation bias
[57:04] it's when we already think we know
[57:08] what's happening
[57:08] what's being said and we've decided
[57:10] whether or not what's being said is true
[57:12] okay and then it says we're distracted
[57:15] by our own thoughts
[57:17] and opinions and our tendency to pick
[57:20] out facts or aspects of the conversation
[57:22] that support our pre-existing beliefs
[57:24] values or perception in other words we
[57:27] only listen for what we want to hear
[57:31] you know we've come a long way in this
[57:34] message
[57:36] and unfortunately
[57:39] the biggest scarecrows in the message
[57:45] are the false doctrines
[57:48] that are so close and we've been so
[57:52] burned by
[57:54] that we do exactly this i know i come
[57:58] from one of them
[57:59] organizations i've been there
[58:04] and that's exactly what happens we've
[58:06] been
[58:07] places where doctrine no things were
[58:09] taught incorrectly
[58:10] we've been places where things were fed
[58:13] to us
[58:14] as the truth right
[58:17] and now what we do is this exact thing
[58:19] is we sit in a service
[58:22] and we listen for key words that
[58:25] trigger our past experience
[58:28] and when we hear that keyword it sets
[58:31] off all the alarm bells
[58:34] and when it does we lock up
[58:38] that's it no need to listen to a minute
[58:41] more of this service
[58:43] i know exactly where this is going i've
[58:46] had enough
[58:48] i'm checked out done
[58:52] and now we're in a place where god can
[58:54] no longer speak to us
[58:57] definitely not with that minister or
[58:58] definitely not that service
[59:00] because we've already due to past
[59:04] experience
[59:07] decided no good done
[59:10] now don't take me wrong we are to be
[59:14] in the word you are to know your
[59:16] scripture you
[59:18] are to be in the message to a point
[59:20] where if something was
[59:21] actually wrong you would catch it
[59:25] you see but brother told us many times
[59:28] and he did this to for the denomination
[59:31] because he wanted the denominational
[59:32] believers to continue listening when he
[59:34] said things but it's still a truth he
[59:36] said
[59:37] now if you're eating cherry pie and you
[59:40] run into a pit
[59:42] the seed of the cherry and you bite down
[59:45] and it's hard
[59:46] well he said spit out the pit but keep
[59:48] on eating pie
[59:51] you see because you may run into
[59:54] something that hangs you up
[59:56] and maybe it's wrong maybe it's not
[59:58] maybe it's just that key word
[1:00:01] that that false teacher that false
[1:00:04] prophet
[1:00:05] used incorrectly you see because it's
[1:00:08] not a false word
[1:00:11] you see if if we can find it in the
[1:00:13] message or in scripture
[1:00:14] it's not wrong but the understanding
[1:00:17] that we were taught it by
[1:00:19] was incorrect it was a false anointing
[1:00:22] on the true word
[1:00:24] so that word is still true so it
[1:00:26] behooves us to go well
[1:00:28] if i learned it incorrectly then god
[1:00:31] either
[1:00:31] teach me or bring someone to teach me
[1:00:35] what is the truth behind that word you
[1:00:37] see because we need the entire word
[1:00:40] in order to get out of here it's an
[1:00:42] entire revelation it's not
[1:00:45] it's not bits and pieces but it's
[1:00:48] that that was spoken for a reason
[1:00:51] and if it was spoken for a reason then
[1:00:53] it behooves us to understand it
[1:00:57] it behooves us to ask god for revelation
[1:01:00] of that word and not let us scare it
[1:01:03] let the devil scare us off by the use of
[1:01:06] a word
[1:01:08] that some men used incorrectly
[1:01:11] you see so
[1:01:14] i i just thought that was so good um
[1:01:18] now they said when you're listening the
[1:01:21] best way
[1:01:22] to catch what's being said
[1:01:26] is you have to come in with an
[1:01:27] understanding and assume
[1:01:30] that what's being said is true
[1:01:34] because if your first step an assumption
[1:01:37] is that what is being said is false
[1:01:39] you'll discount and discredit everything
[1:01:41] that's being said
[1:01:43] why would we bother to continue
[1:01:44] listening to something that is false
[1:01:48] okay
[1:01:51] now what happens the minute you begin to
[1:01:53] think that
[1:01:54] something is false
[1:01:58] you you drop into what something they
[1:02:00] call competitive listening
[1:02:02] where you have a negative reaction to
[1:02:05] what's being said
[1:02:06] and want that set into place once that
[1:02:08] begins rolling
[1:02:10] it'll stay that way for the entire rest
[1:02:12] of the
[1:02:13] time that that person is speaking
[1:02:17] so what you've entered into now is
[1:02:20] everything that's being said
[1:02:21] you're trying to find the error in it
[1:02:23] you're trying to find
[1:02:25] where is it wrong how is it wrong but
[1:02:27] now you're also
[1:02:28] you're doing is you're going back to
[1:02:29] your past tendencies
[1:02:31] your past experience to find what's
[1:02:33] wrong with what you're
[1:02:35] well you're listening to but if the
[1:02:38] thing that scared you off that
[1:02:40] false use of a term the false use of a
[1:02:42] word
[1:02:43] the false representation
[1:02:47] is still possibly a part of your current
[1:02:50] revelation
[1:02:51] then how do you know whether or not
[1:02:55] that's true
[1:02:56] without giving god a chance to reveal it
[1:02:59] to you
[1:03:00] you see so many times we we run our
[1:03:02] first
[1:03:03] you know it's fight or flight fight or
[1:03:05] flight is the reaction
[1:03:07] and people think of that as just a
[1:03:09] physical reaction but it's also an
[1:03:11] emotional reaction
[1:03:12] and it's also something that happens in
[1:03:14] services on a
[1:03:16] daily basis is people either
[1:03:19] choose as what's being spoken comes
[1:03:21] forth to fight it
[1:03:22] or to run from it and that's been
[1:03:25] something throughout scripture
[1:03:26] you'll find that when god spoke to his
[1:03:28] children you'll find that's usually what
[1:03:30] they did first
[1:03:31] i mean look at moses his first thing was
[1:03:34] he tried fighting
[1:03:36] he killed an egyptian which was not what
[1:03:38] god wanted him to do
[1:03:39] and then his next thing was to run out
[1:03:41] into the wilderness for 40 years
[1:03:43] and try and hide from it
[1:03:47] one he picked one or the other and then
[1:03:49] he tried both
[1:03:52] i mean look at jonah he did the same
[1:03:53] thing god came and spoke to him
[1:03:55] here's first thing flight run
[1:03:58] i don't want to deal with this i'm
[1:04:00] running
[1:04:01] but as you begin to see throughout
[1:04:04] scripture
[1:04:04] begin to think about it think of
[1:04:08] all sons and daughters of god who god
[1:04:10] has come and spoke to
[1:04:13] and this should give you some
[1:04:14] reassurance
[1:04:17] the fact that they most of them tried to
[1:04:19] either fight it or run from it
[1:04:21] and in the end it still ended up working
[1:04:24] out for god's
[1:04:26] will and god's perfect plan
[1:04:29] you see that gives us comfort because we
[1:04:31] can know if
[1:04:33] god was trying to speak to you and you
[1:04:35] missed it the first three or four times
[1:04:39] don't worry because god knew you were
[1:04:42] going to do that
[1:04:43] and it's still going to work out for his
[1:04:45] good just try to pay a little bit better
[1:04:47] attention the fifth or sixth time
[1:04:50] okay so
[1:04:53] now where where you have to
[1:04:57] listen and believe something is true you
[1:04:59] see here enters in faith
[1:05:03] in order to believe something is true
[1:05:04] you have to have a faith
[1:05:06] that believes that that is a truth being
[1:05:10] spoken
[1:05:11] so faith enters into the equation
[1:05:20] now other things that get in the way
[1:05:24] sometimes they're physical things or
[1:05:26] sometimes other things surrounding us
[1:05:29] to being able to listen simple things
[1:05:32] like
[1:05:33] there could be a distraction in the back
[1:05:34] right now some child could
[1:05:37] all of a sudden go into a fit or throw a
[1:05:39] tantrum knock over a chair
[1:05:42] and all of a sudden all of our focus to
[1:05:45] the back
[1:05:46] and you got to be careful because
[1:05:50] the devil uses those types of things to
[1:05:53] try and break an atmosphere
[1:05:54] you see because we know that brother
[1:05:56] branham made a statement
[1:05:58] and this is not verbatim but he said
[1:06:03] if something happens in a service to
[1:06:05] disrupt the atmosphere
[1:06:07] more than two or three times he said the
[1:06:10] presence of the lord
[1:06:11] the holy spirit will leave the building
[1:06:12] and may not come back that entire
[1:06:14] service
[1:06:15] okay but and i know many of us we
[1:06:18] we get really you know nitty-gritty into
[1:06:20] that with church order
[1:06:22] with you know the slightest thing and
[1:06:24] someone doesn't seem like they're paying
[1:06:26] attention or
[1:06:27] that person is sleeping or the baby is
[1:06:28] crying in the corner
[1:06:30] let's get all these people out because
[1:06:31] we don't want we don't want any
[1:06:32] distraction or
[1:06:33] disturb the spirit
[1:06:36] but really has more to do with those
[1:06:40] around
[1:06:40] giving attention to it
[1:06:44] because brother random said we have the
[1:06:47] ability
[1:06:48] to create atmospheres so when those
[1:06:52] distractions are happening
[1:06:53] you right next to the distraction and
[1:06:55] further out
[1:06:56] have the ability to create an atmosphere
[1:06:59] that whether or not that distraction
[1:07:00] continues
[1:07:01] that god takes control
[1:07:05] and you'll see a move on the scene you
[1:07:07] see because
[1:07:09] we saw where there was a distraction in
[1:07:10] a service
[1:07:12] where there was a young couple making
[1:07:14] out in the front row
[1:07:16] god's presence didn't leave due to the
[1:07:19] fact that the man of god
[1:07:21] gave god preeminence god came in and
[1:07:24] took control
[1:07:25] of the situation and you know they
[1:07:27] didn't ask them to leave
[1:07:29] when god took control it brought
[1:07:31] repentance and they stayed in the
[1:07:32] service
[1:07:35] same thing brother branham talks about
[1:07:37] setting an atmosphere in your home
[1:07:40] he says you know that time he talks
[1:07:42] about when he was home with mita and the
[1:07:44] kids
[1:07:45] and the kids were fussing and mita was
[1:07:47] upset about something he said i just put
[1:07:49] on an apron
[1:07:50] and went over to the sink and started
[1:07:51] washing dishes and singing songs
[1:07:54] and within a few minutes the whole place
[1:07:55] was just peaceful
[1:07:58] you know many of us i
[1:08:02] would dare to say would not react that
[1:08:03] way
[1:08:07] and i'm not saying that brother branham
[1:08:09] always had that reaction but he'd come
[1:08:10] to a place
[1:08:11] in his life where he understood
[1:08:15] how setting that right atmosphere
[1:08:16] changes everything
[1:08:18] changes everything and i know that
[1:08:20] because listen to the messages
[1:08:22] listen to the message especially at
[1:08:23] branham tabernacle how many times can
[1:08:25] you hear
[1:08:26] a small child crying how many times can
[1:08:28] you hear something in the background all
[1:08:29] that tape
[1:08:30] on top of all the distortion on the
[1:08:32] noise
[1:08:34] you know at the church where i was at in
[1:08:36] phoenix there was a sister there
[1:08:38] actually who was a child in branham
[1:08:39] tabernacle
[1:08:41] and when the tabernacle got real full
[1:08:45] they would have the young children leave
[1:08:47] their seats and come sit
[1:08:49] on the front of the platform
[1:08:52] now you know who who would think of that
[1:08:56] as not being something that would be a
[1:08:57] distraction
[1:09:00] but you see but they kept the right
[1:09:02] atmosphere and under that right
[1:09:04] atmosphere
[1:09:05] i'm not saying no one ever misbehaved
[1:09:08] but i'm saying they weren't focused in
[1:09:11] on the distraction
[1:09:12] they were focused in on the voice
[1:09:18] so here we are in our seats
[1:09:21] wherever we're at and it's up to you to
[1:09:25] control the atmosphere around you where
[1:09:27] you sit
[1:09:29] because brethren
[1:09:33] made a statement he said that someone
[1:09:35] with an evil spirit
[1:09:36] can affect the rose five in front of
[1:09:38] them and five behind them
[1:09:41] and that's exactly our reaction wow
[1:09:44] that's that's
[1:09:45] that's a lot of influence
[1:09:50] but we also know that greater is he that
[1:09:52] is in us
[1:09:53] than he that is in the world so if the
[1:09:56] one person
[1:09:57] under the influence of an evil spirit
[1:10:00] has the
[1:10:01] can control the atmosphere five rows in
[1:10:04] each direction
[1:10:05] ten rows fan how much more someone fully
[1:10:08] yielded on the influence of the moving
[1:10:10] of the holy spirit
[1:10:11] who is listening and hearing god's word
[1:10:13] speak to their heart directly
[1:10:15] how much influence should there be in a
[1:10:16] room one person in the middle of this
[1:10:19] room should be able to control the
[1:10:20] atmosphere of this entire room
[1:10:22] fully surrendered fully focused in on
[1:10:26] what
[1:10:26] god is speaking to your heart maybe not
[1:10:28] with the minister not
[1:10:30] what the person at the pulpit is
[1:10:32] speaking it may not be the physical
[1:10:33] words
[1:10:34] but if you came desiring to hear from
[1:10:36] god
[1:10:37] god is obligated to come and speak to
[1:10:40] you in your need
[1:10:41] it doesn't matter what the minister
[1:10:44] wrote in his notes
[1:10:45] it doesn't matter what scriptures he
[1:10:47] wrote doesn't matter what slides he has
[1:10:49] doesn't matter how many hours he spent
[1:10:51] studying
[1:10:52] if you came and not only did you come
[1:10:55] expecting but you came and you brought
[1:10:57] that atmosphere with you
[1:11:00] then god is obligated to meet you there
[1:11:03] and meet the desire of your heart and
[1:11:06] speak to you
[1:11:07] directly and he will
[1:11:10] all right
[1:11:19] now one thing that they say about being
[1:11:20] able to listen
[1:11:22] and pay attention and understand is you
[1:11:25] have to get rid of
[1:11:26] all outside distractions
[1:11:31] you have to put everything down and shut
[1:11:33] out everything else
[1:11:35] and focus you have to focus
[1:11:40] on the voice being coming to you
[1:11:44] has to be as if you are the only person
[1:11:48] in the room
[1:11:50] you have to you have to lock in
[1:11:53] and draw it out of the speaker
[1:11:58] you've seen it many times i'm sure
[1:11:59] you've you've sat with someone
[1:12:01] and speaking in dialogue and whatever it
[1:12:03] was you're talking about
[1:12:05] and and as they sit there listening to
[1:12:08] you they make you just want to say more
[1:12:10] and say more and keep talking and say
[1:12:11] more because they're so
[1:12:14] focused on you that they're just drawing
[1:12:16] it out of you
[1:12:18] it's not that they they're saying
[1:12:19] anything they might be like oh yeah
[1:12:21] uh-huh
[1:12:22] wow that's amazing
[1:12:25] you know and a little maybe a little bit
[1:12:27] of encouragement oh wow
[1:12:30] but but they're so intent on listening
[1:12:34] that you just it just keeps coming out
[1:12:37] things that you've never meant to say
[1:12:40] and that's what you do every time you
[1:12:42] come into a service
[1:12:44] is if you came prepared to listen then
[1:12:47] you will draw
[1:12:48] that out not just of the man
[1:12:51] you'll draw it out of god himself coming
[1:12:54] to speak to you to speak to your heart
[1:12:56] individually
[1:12:59] but the question is are you listening
[1:13:01] the question is why did you come
[1:13:04] did you come to listen why are you here
[1:13:08] why are you listening and what do you
[1:13:11] want to hear
[1:13:14] did you just come to hear something that
[1:13:15] make you feel good
[1:13:17] did you come to did you come brother
[1:13:19] talks about if you come to find
[1:13:21] fault you'll find it did you come to
[1:13:23] find fault in
[1:13:24] in the speaker and his did you come to
[1:13:26] find fault in the grammar did you come
[1:13:28] to find fault
[1:13:29] in perhaps how something was said
[1:13:32] what what was what was your purpose
[1:13:35] when you sat down what was your purpose
[1:13:39] you see because in scripture we we have
[1:13:43] an example of someone who had the wrong
[1:13:46] purpose
[1:13:48] who just took get paid no attention
[1:13:51] but when it came time to speak over
[1:13:53] god's people he could only say
[1:13:55] what god allowed him do you know who
[1:13:58] that was that was balaam
[1:14:01] you see israel was coming across the
[1:14:03] land was camped outside of balak's
[1:14:05] territory
[1:14:07] and balak wasn't happy about it
[1:14:10] and he sent to balaam because balaam was
[1:14:12] a prophet
[1:14:14] you know we people want to put him
[1:14:16] outside the message or put him outside
[1:14:18] of
[1:14:19] the church but balaam was a prophet
[1:14:23] god spoke to him
[1:14:27] the problem is balaam was not good at
[1:14:29] listening
[1:14:31] balaam wanted to hear what he wanted to
[1:14:34] hear
[1:14:36] because the first time the king says
[1:14:38] messengers
[1:14:39] tell him hey all these people are here
[1:14:42] we need your help
[1:14:44] you're a great prophet see they begin
[1:14:46] stroking his ego
[1:14:48] we know you have the ability to do this
[1:14:50] come help us
[1:14:52] and balaam first time around he does the
[1:14:54] right thing he says look
[1:14:56] it i got to pray over this tonight
[1:14:59] and i'll give you an answer in the
[1:15:00] morning and they said okay
[1:15:03] he prays all night and the lord tells
[1:15:05] them don't go
[1:15:07] these are my people they are blessed
[1:15:11] do not go you think for anybody else
[1:15:14] after you just talked to god you asked
[1:15:17] him about going and cursing of people
[1:15:18] and he and he says these are blessed
[1:15:20] people
[1:15:20] i'm blessing them by the way you'd be
[1:15:23] like if god's blessing them
[1:15:25] i don't want nothing to do with no
[1:15:26] cursing
[1:15:28] because that puts me on you would think
[1:15:30] just basic reasoning
[1:15:32] god blessing them i try and curse them
[1:15:35] god's not blessing me at that point
[1:15:39] and he he tells them and they go away
[1:15:41] well guess what they heard what they
[1:15:43] wanted to hurt here too because he said
[1:15:45] god told me i can't do it and they went
[1:15:47] home and told them
[1:15:48] the king they told the king hey he's not
[1:15:50] going to come i don't think you're
[1:15:52] offering enough yet
[1:15:54] he said he don't want to and so he sends
[1:15:57] he says he sends
[1:15:58] more important more mighty men more
[1:16:02] princes more mightier than those of
[1:16:04] before p
[1:16:06] men of greater influence back to him
[1:16:09] and they come again and say hey look it
[1:16:13] you won't even not just your we won't
[1:16:16] even just flame your ego here but
[1:16:18] there's riches
[1:16:18] that you can't even imagine that we're
[1:16:21] gonna
[1:16:22] hand your way instead of going look guys
[1:16:25] god already spoke there's nothing i can
[1:16:27] do
[1:16:28] he says hey maybe god will change his
[1:16:30] mind
[1:16:31] he said oh let me pray again and he goes
[1:16:34] and he prays
[1:16:35] again and you know what he
[1:16:39] got told the same thing surprise
[1:16:42] surprise
[1:16:45] but now
[1:16:50] we're going to see here
[1:17:03] and the now that the princes have been
[1:17:05] turned away twice
[1:17:06] the elders of moab come to him
[1:17:10] they come with rewards of divination in
[1:17:12] their hand
[1:17:13] and they spake unto balaam and speak
[1:17:16] unto him the words of balak
[1:17:18] and he said unto them lodge here this
[1:17:20] night and i will bring you a word again
[1:17:22] as the lord shall speak
[1:17:23] unto me and the princes of moab abode
[1:17:25] with balaam and god came up to balaam
[1:17:27] and said
[1:17:27] what men are these with thee he's like
[1:17:30] balaam what are you doing in bad company
[1:17:32] again
[1:17:34] i already told you once and you're still
[1:17:36] associating
[1:17:39] you know we do that too in all different
[1:17:42] ways in careers
[1:17:45] in people we associate with in places we
[1:17:48] decide to go
[1:17:49] we have that gentle tugging of the holy
[1:17:51] spirit saying hey don't do that
[1:17:53] don't go there and then we go and do it
[1:17:57] and god comes and goes what are you
[1:17:59] doing what are you doing
[1:18:02] who are these men that you're
[1:18:03] associating with it's not
[1:18:05] just like in the garden of eden where he
[1:18:06] said adam adam where art thou it's not
[1:18:08] that
[1:18:08] god didn't know where adam was at and
[1:18:10] it's not that god didn't know who these
[1:18:12] people were
[1:18:13] he's like balaam come on get your act
[1:18:16] together
[1:18:20] and balaam said unto god balak the son
[1:18:22] is the poor king of moab had censored me
[1:18:24] saying behold there's a people come out
[1:18:25] of egypt
[1:18:26] which covert the face of the earth come
[1:18:28] now curse me
[1:18:29] them per adventure i shall be able to
[1:18:32] overcome them and drive them out
[1:18:34] and god said unto balaam thou shalt not
[1:18:36] go with them thou shalt
[1:18:37] not curse the people for they are
[1:18:39] blessed
[1:18:41] and balaam arose in the morning and said
[1:18:42] unto the princes of balak
[1:18:44] get you into your land for the lord
[1:18:46] refuses to give me leave to go with you
[1:18:52] and here they come again
[1:18:56] and he said unto him came to balaam and
[1:18:59] said unto him
[1:19:00] thus saith balak's son as the four let
[1:19:02] nothing i pray thee hinder thee from
[1:19:04] coming unto me
[1:19:05] for i will promote thee unto very great
[1:19:08] honor
[1:19:09] and i do will do whatsoever thou sayeth
[1:19:11] unto me
[1:19:12] come therefore i pray thee curse me this
[1:19:15] people
[1:19:16] and balaam answered and said unto the
[1:19:18] servants of balak if baalik would give
[1:19:20] me his house full of silver
[1:19:22] and gold i cannot go beyond the word
[1:19:26] of the lord my god to do less or more
[1:19:30] now therefore i pray you carry ye also
[1:19:34] hear this night you see
[1:19:35] doubts entering in and the the thoughts
[1:19:38] of his career
[1:19:41] being elevated to a status right under
[1:19:43] the king
[1:19:45] that's really pulling at him he's like
[1:19:47] look it
[1:19:49] no matter how much you offer me i can't
[1:19:51] do anything unless the lord lets me
[1:19:52] but let me talk to the lord again about
[1:19:55] it
[1:19:55] because it's getting better maybe the
[1:19:57] lord just wanted me to wait until the
[1:19:58] offer was right
[1:20:02] you know
[1:20:09] now therefore i pray you tarry ye also
[1:20:11] hear this night that i may know what the
[1:20:13] lord will say unto me more
[1:20:15] and god came unto balaam at night and
[1:20:16] said unto him if the men
[1:20:19] come to call thee rise up and go with
[1:20:21] them
[1:20:22] but yet the word which i shall say unto
[1:20:24] thee thou
[1:20:25] that shalt thou do now
[1:20:28] listen there is a key thing in here
[1:20:32] or balaam heard but he wasn't listening
[1:20:36] okay and it said
[1:20:40] if the men come to call thee rise up and
[1:20:43] go with them
[1:20:46] okay and immediately in the next verse
[1:20:49] it says and balaam rose up in the
[1:20:50] morning and saddled his ass
[1:20:52] and went with the princes of moab
[1:20:55] nowhere in there does it tell me that
[1:20:57] they came again unto him
[1:21:01] they had gone they had heard him three
[1:21:03] times say no
[1:21:05] and then tell him no matter what you
[1:21:06] offer me i can't do it
[1:21:08] the lord won't let me and they went
[1:21:11] oh well we tried and they're on their
[1:21:13] way home
[1:21:16] balaam talks to the god about it
[1:21:19] and god tells them if they come again to
[1:21:21] you
[1:21:23] you can go with them but you will only
[1:21:25] say what i allow you
[1:21:27] and what balaam says heard was go with
[1:21:30] them and i'll
[1:21:31] you'll only be able to say what i allow
[1:21:33] you
[1:21:35] right he just the part he didn't want to
[1:21:38] hear right that whole part that we
[1:21:40] put in their past experiences what you
[1:21:42] want to hear is what you do here
[1:21:44] he heard what he wanted to hear and boom
[1:21:46] he was often down the road
[1:21:49] running but at this point
[1:21:52] a prophet after choosing his
[1:21:56] own way he has now become so
[1:21:58] desensitized
[1:21:59] to the presence of god moving
[1:22:02] he doesn't have a clue
[1:22:06] he's pushed and pushed for his own way
[1:22:08] so far
[1:22:10] outside of the will of god he doesn't
[1:22:12] even have a clue of when
[1:22:14] the presence of god comes down
[1:22:17] we know because here he is he's riding
[1:22:19] his his donkey as fast as he can go
[1:22:22] and first the donkey tries to run him
[1:22:24] off the path and then the donkey crushes
[1:22:26] his leg into a wall
[1:22:28] and he's getting mad at the donkey and
[1:22:29] he's beating the donkey with a stick
[1:22:32] well prior to this three nights worth
[1:22:35] he was sensitive enough to hear god
[1:22:38] speak to him
[1:22:40] and now there's an angel of the lord
[1:22:42] standing right in his presence and he
[1:22:43] can't even recognize it
[1:22:48] he is so pushed for his own way
[1:22:51] so pushed just disregarding everything
[1:22:54] that god has spoke to him
[1:22:56] see he didn't have no problem hearing
[1:23:00] and the first few times he had no
[1:23:01] problem listening but when his own gain
[1:23:04] and his own ambitions got in the way now
[1:23:06] his understanding was clouded
[1:23:09] and here he goes and here now he stands
[1:23:12] right in the presence of the angel not
[1:23:14] once
[1:23:14] i believe three times and it's not until
[1:23:17] the angel completely blocks the path
[1:23:19] where the donkey can't get out of the
[1:23:22] way and skirt around him
[1:23:26] in fact balaam is so blind that the
[1:23:28] angel tells him he says that what if it
[1:23:29] wasn't for your donkey
[1:23:31] i would have slew you
[1:23:36] if it wasn't for the dumb animal you'd
[1:23:38] be dead already
[1:23:40] you've become so desensitized and yet
[1:23:43] even in that this
[1:23:44] desensitized prophet still goes on his
[1:23:48] way
[1:23:49] thinking he's still going to try and
[1:23:50] gain some honor and glory
[1:23:52] still thinking he can still use
[1:23:57] god to curse his own people
[1:24:01] he is so his understanding is so
[1:24:05] his understanding and his judgment is so
[1:24:07] off
[1:24:09] he just keeps driving forward you see he
[1:24:12] still
[1:24:13] thought god would curse them that
[1:24:15] somehow god
[1:24:16] allowing him by to continue on
[1:24:19] was god's blessing on his journey it
[1:24:22] wasn't
[1:24:24] god had tried to correct him once
[1:24:26] correct him twice
[1:24:28] three times four times on the fourth
[1:24:31] time he sent an angel
[1:24:34] and this point god said okay you're
[1:24:37] gonna do what you're gonna do
[1:24:39] but you're not gonna like the end result
[1:24:43] and he still keeps driving forward but
[1:24:46] he's still trying to follow the precepts
[1:24:48] and understanding of
[1:24:49] scripture in order to bring this to pass
[1:24:52] against god's chosen people let's not
[1:24:54] ever find ourselves in that place
[1:24:58] where we've taken and we've turned
[1:25:00] scripture we've turned
[1:25:01] church order we've turned these things
[1:25:04] that are to be good things
[1:25:06] they're god's chosen way
[1:25:11] and yet we take them in and pervert them
[1:25:14] and try and use them against our brother
[1:25:16] we try and use them against our sister
[1:25:18] we try and use them to bring cursings
[1:25:20] instead of blessings
[1:25:23] you see and balaam was still
[1:25:26] 100 sure it was going to work
[1:25:30] because each time as he goes up for
[1:25:33] cursing
[1:25:34] he's got the seven altars he's got the
[1:25:36] the right sacrifices he's got
[1:25:38] everything just in order he's got his
[1:25:39] church order perfect
[1:25:41] and he comes up and he gets ready to
[1:25:43] curse
[1:25:44] and it happens just as god told him it
[1:25:46] would as he goes up to curse
[1:25:48] blessings pour from his mouth
[1:25:51] you see because it doesn't matter who is
[1:25:54] against you
[1:25:56] if god is for you none can be against
[1:25:58] you
[1:26:00] because god's word is true and what he's
[1:26:03] spoken has to come to pass
[1:26:05] you see there was already a word of
[1:26:06] blessing spoken over the children of
[1:26:08] israel
[1:26:10] and nothing could change that in fact
[1:26:13] even in attempting to curse them
[1:26:16] balaam simply added blessing upon
[1:26:18] blessing upon them
[1:26:20] it was only way he got to them is when
[1:26:23] he got them
[1:26:24] out from behind the word that had been
[1:26:27] spoken to them
[1:26:29] you see they had received a word and a
[1:26:32] prophet
[1:26:33] that brought that word and an
[1:26:35] understanding
[1:26:37] but balaam came to realize as long as i
[1:26:39] stay within the word all i can do is
[1:26:41] bless these people
[1:26:43] because they're god's people and god
[1:26:45] will never bring a curse upon his people
[1:26:47] only blessings now you may go through
[1:26:50] trials that you think are curses
[1:26:52] but they're actually blessings you just
[1:26:55] aren't understanding
[1:26:57] because you're not listening we're not
[1:27:00] listening
[1:27:01] we're not understanding because if you
[1:27:03] were listening and you were
[1:27:04] understanding
[1:27:06] you would see that this is not a curse
[1:27:08] this is this trial is not a cursing
[1:27:11] this is a blessing because then you
[1:27:13] would see what god was doing in your
[1:27:15] life just like elijah standing there at
[1:27:17] the cave
[1:27:18] and you would be able to see how god was
[1:27:20] working and he you would be start
[1:27:22] getting the instruction you need to move
[1:27:24] forward in the journey
[1:27:26] but as long as all you can see is the
[1:27:27] lightning all you can see is the thunder
[1:27:30] all you can see is the earthquakes all
[1:27:32] you can see is the turmoil around us
[1:27:35] all you can see is politics falling
[1:27:36] apart all you can see is countries
[1:27:38] falling apart
[1:27:40] wars and turmoil all over all around us
[1:27:44] both on global scales and community
[1:27:46] scales it's
[1:27:47] it's war on in the streets as long as
[1:27:50] the devil can get you to focus there
[1:27:53] look at this look at the evil look at
[1:27:54] what's going on look at what's going
[1:27:56] wrong
[1:27:57] then he got you distracted from the
[1:27:59] voice of god
[1:28:00] that still small voice coming to speak
[1:28:02] to your heart and bring understanding
[1:28:05] you see and so balaam realized that
[1:28:08] he had to bring a distraction to the
[1:28:12] childrens of
[1:28:12] israel to their understanding to the
[1:28:15] revelation of the word
[1:28:17] because only by getting them off the
[1:28:18] word because he pulled god's hand
[1:28:21] of protection off of them
[1:28:24] and so is it with each one of us no
[1:28:25] matter what trial you're going through
[1:28:28] no matter what the opposition stay with
[1:28:30] the word
[1:28:32] get into the word get deeper into the
[1:28:34] word
[1:28:35] ask ask him lord help me to understand
[1:28:38] this trial i'm going through
[1:28:41] help me to understand what it is that
[1:28:43] you're trying to speak to me to my heart
[1:28:45] directly
[1:28:47] help me to understand what direction it
[1:28:50] is you're trying to guide me
[1:28:52] help me to understand your plan
[1:28:55] for my life help me understand your plan
[1:28:59] for this situation
[1:29:02] because until you do you you'll you'll
[1:29:03] do the same thing you'll just
[1:29:05] wander around the sign but you won't get
[1:29:08] where you're going
[1:29:10] all right what time is it
[1:29:14] so here we have we can see someone who
[1:29:17] was able to listen but at a certain
[1:29:20] point
[1:29:22] had no revelation of what god was
[1:29:23] speaking to him
[1:29:25] okay
[1:29:28] now reasons for listening
[1:29:31] why are you listening you see in the
[1:29:33] book of acts stephen
[1:29:35] the first martyr of the church there
[1:29:39] when he was dragged before the council
[1:29:41] the men who dragged him there
[1:29:44] dragged him there because they were so
[1:29:45] angry because he was his
[1:29:48] words were so eloquent they couldn't get
[1:29:50] around them
[1:29:52] they couldn't beat them the eloquence
[1:29:55] with which he spoke
[1:29:57] was so revelated they didn't stand a
[1:30:00] chance
[1:30:01] so they brought together false
[1:30:04] accusations
[1:30:06] and dragged him before the council with
[1:30:08] those false accusations
[1:30:09] when they got to the council the council
[1:30:11] had no desire
[1:30:13] to hear and understand what stephen was
[1:30:16] ministering
[1:30:18] they had already predetermined why they
[1:30:21] were listening
[1:30:22] and that was for judgment they had
[1:30:24] already already predetermined what he
[1:30:26] was speaking was a lie
[1:30:30] so as his eloquent ministry poured
[1:30:34] forth and he walked them all the way
[1:30:36] from abraham
[1:30:37] bit by bit by bit all the way to jesus
[1:30:42] he showed them each of the signs he
[1:30:43] showed them the prophecy it was all
[1:30:45] falling on deaf ears
[1:30:48] they had already decided he was a
[1:30:49] blasphemer
[1:30:51] their reason for listening was simply to
[1:30:53] find fault
[1:30:54] and cast judgment okay
[1:30:58] another one jesus
[1:31:01] in matthew the scribes and pharisees
[1:31:04] it specifically says the reason they
[1:31:06] came to ask him
[1:31:07] questions was to entrap him
[1:31:11] under the law and find fault that was
[1:31:16] their reason for listening
[1:31:18] they they weren't looking for the truth
[1:31:21] they weren't thinking that jesus might
[1:31:22] have something that to share with them
[1:31:24] that they would be able to understand
[1:31:25] or that would open up their
[1:31:26] understanding
[1:31:29] every time he responded in a way
[1:31:32] that was true to scripture they simply
[1:31:36] discounted it and said well he made it
[1:31:39] out this time but we know he's wrong
[1:31:41] we know he's wrong and we'll catch him
[1:31:43] next time we'll catch him next time he's
[1:31:45] just really sly
[1:31:47] you know just like the devil that's what
[1:31:51] they called him the alzhebab
[1:31:52] he said he's healing people by the power
[1:31:55] of beelzebub
[1:31:58] because just like there with the
[1:32:01] disciples
[1:32:02] when they dragged him before the
[1:32:03] sanhedrin council and they asked
[1:32:08] gamalio for advice
[1:32:11] he said brethren be careful what you do
[1:32:13] with these men
[1:32:15] least you find yourself fighting against
[1:32:18] god
[1:32:18] he said if this is of man it will fall
[1:32:21] apart and go away
[1:32:22] but if it be of god you cannot win
[1:32:27] you see but even there they weren't
[1:32:30] listening
[1:32:32] they had already made a decision they
[1:32:35] had already decided
[1:32:37] and they had gone too far to turn back
[1:32:42] they were so sold out to what they
[1:32:45] believed
[1:32:47] even when they heard the truth and saw
[1:32:49] the truth
[1:32:51] they refused to believe it
[1:32:56] they'd seen all the miracles the scribes
[1:32:59] and pharisees it says that the
[1:33:01] at the gate
[1:33:02] was at the gate of the temple
[1:33:06] these scribes and pharisees probably
[1:33:08] walk by him all of them once or twice a
[1:33:09] day
[1:33:10] crippled from birth
[1:33:14] miracles signs and wonders they hadn't
[1:33:16] seen them in a long time
[1:33:18] it wasn't like there was miracles
[1:33:19] happening and somebody else
[1:33:22] came along and and there was just
[1:33:23] another miracle every day
[1:33:25] happening look another
[1:33:29] another crippled man walking no big deal
[1:33:33] that wasn't the case there had been no
[1:33:35] miracles for years
[1:33:36] just like we stood in this day when the
[1:33:39] pentecostal age came on
[1:33:41] there had been no real miracles in the
[1:33:43] church for years
[1:33:45] that's why they had come to a point
[1:33:47] where they said that the
[1:33:49] signs and wonders it was the of the
[1:33:52] times the apostles it's not for us now
[1:33:56] even as brother branham was entering the
[1:33:57] stage in the early part of his ministry
[1:33:59] the
[1:34:00] pentecostal church of the azusa street
[1:34:02] revival
[1:34:03] had already come to a place that's why
[1:34:05] brother abraham said in 50 years
[1:34:06] you have gone further than the catholic
[1:34:09] church did in 2000
[1:34:13] because they'd already come to the point
[1:34:14] this was not the the
[1:34:17] presbyterians and the catholics telling
[1:34:19] him the days and miracles are gone
[1:34:21] but it was those of the apostolic
[1:34:23] pentecostal church
[1:34:26] who are saying it's over it's over
[1:34:31] it's done they'd already decided
[1:34:37] and here it was now god
[1:34:40] comes on the scene and signs and wonders
[1:34:43] following
[1:34:44] like he wasn't looking for you to follow
[1:34:45] the signs and the wonder
[1:34:47] but he's trying to catch your attention
[1:34:50] to the word
[1:34:52] but only those who are listening in the
[1:34:54] midst of the
[1:34:56] turmoil in the midst of all the going on
[1:35:00] in the midst of the thunder in the midst
[1:35:03] of the lightning
[1:35:04] in the midst of the earthquake in the
[1:35:06] midst of churches falling apart
[1:35:08] in the midst of those falling away
[1:35:11] you're still listening to god still
[1:35:12] small voice
[1:35:14] because you weren't paying attention to
[1:35:15] any of the thunder
[1:35:17] you weren't paying attention to the
[1:35:18] lightning you weren't paying attention
[1:35:20] to the earthquake
[1:35:22] you weren't paying attention to just the
[1:35:25] sign
[1:35:26] but that whole time you focused into the
[1:35:28] voice
[1:35:30] you focus into the voice and the voice
[1:35:33] hasn't changed
[1:35:35] maybe the sign has changed and so now
[1:35:38] those who are falling aside they're like
[1:35:39] where'd it go
[1:35:41] i don't know where to go where'd the
[1:35:42] sign go it must not have been true
[1:35:45] the sign must not have been true because
[1:35:46] the sign's still not here
[1:35:48] but the voice is still here the voice is
[1:35:51] still here
[1:35:52] and the question is is are we listening
[1:35:56] and if we're listening are you
[1:35:58] understanding
[1:36:00] okay
[1:36:06] other reasons for listening
[1:36:09] listening to be entertained listening
[1:36:15] for your own purposes your own direction
[1:36:17] in life
[1:36:19] and in today's day and age there's so
[1:36:22] many other voices there's so much
[1:36:23] distraction around us
[1:36:25] it seems like everything that could
[1:36:28] possibly be here is
[1:36:29] today in this age is here to distract
[1:36:32] you to pull you away
[1:36:33] the voices of entertainment the voices
[1:36:36] of social media the voices of
[1:36:38] of politics the social the
[1:36:41] voices of religion the voices of church
[1:36:45] orchestration and business the churches
[1:36:47] the voices of career
[1:36:51] all these things are surrounding you
[1:36:54] plaguing you and just causing noise
[1:36:57] noise
[1:36:57] noise noise
[1:37:01] and you have to be able to put that all
[1:37:04] away
[1:37:06] put that all away because god's not
[1:37:08] coming screaming at you
[1:37:11] he's a gentleman he's coming softly he's
[1:37:14] knocking
[1:37:16] he's outside the door the war is
[1:37:18] happening all around
[1:37:20] the greatest battle that's ever been
[1:37:22] fought the dan told us all about it
[1:37:24] it's happening in the mind but he's
[1:37:26] knocking to the door of your heart
[1:37:29] but if you're not able to get away from
[1:37:31] the clamor of the war
[1:37:32] you'll never hear the knock and if you
[1:37:35] never hear the knock
[1:37:37] you'll never hear the voice
[1:37:40] because the voice is even quieter and
[1:37:42] stiller than the knock
[1:37:45] but he's speaking he's waiting
[1:37:50] if you'll hear me if you would just hear
[1:37:51] me and open the door
[1:37:54] even if you don't understand but the
[1:37:57] first time if you just hear the voice
[1:37:58] and like
[1:37:59] i hear him i think that's jesus i think
[1:38:01] he's outside the door
[1:38:03] i don't understand what he's telling me
[1:38:05] i don't understand what he's asking of
[1:38:07] me
[1:38:08] but maybe i'll just open the door and
[1:38:09] let him in
[1:38:11] you see because once he comes in to stop
[1:38:12] with you he can explain it all
[1:38:15] just like he did with the disciples
[1:38:19] he can come and begin opening the words
[1:38:21] just like he did with those disciples on
[1:38:22] the road to emmaus
[1:38:24] they were confused they were in a time
[1:38:26] of turmoil
[1:38:27] they were in a time of war they were in
[1:38:29] a time of
[1:38:30] of political strife all around them
[1:38:34] the sadducees were fighting the
[1:38:35] pharisees and
[1:38:37] the pharisees were fighting the
[1:38:38] sadducees for power you see it was a
[1:38:41] church system
[1:38:42] at that time it wasn't some pious group
[1:38:44] these were men vying for power
[1:38:46] the high priest was not actually elected
[1:38:48] at that time
[1:38:49] by the people or through the levitical
[1:38:51] priesthood but was appointed by the
[1:38:52] roman government
[1:38:56] so if you wanted to be at the top
[1:38:59] you had to be willing to do things
[1:39:04] you had to be willing to get your hands
[1:39:05] dirty
[1:39:07] and everybody knew it the people knew it
[1:39:09] the people could see it
[1:39:11] there was a few mixed in there you had a
[1:39:13] few nicodemuses here and there
[1:39:15] who still believed the truth who was
[1:39:17] still looking for the messiah
[1:39:19] but most of them they were just there
[1:39:22] for power
[1:39:23] they were just there for what they could
[1:39:24] get out of it
[1:39:26] control power money
[1:39:29] the same things that brother ram said
[1:39:30] plague us today
[1:39:32] he said the three things that there that
[1:39:34] most affect a minister he said were
[1:39:37] money popularity in women nothing has
[1:39:40] changed
[1:39:42] we're still in that same position we
[1:39:44] find ourselves back there
[1:39:46] how much different should it be we know
[1:39:49] that in the first coming of christ what
[1:39:50] the conditions were
[1:39:52] so how would it be any different in the
[1:39:53] second coming
[1:39:55] we should be looking for the same
[1:39:56] situations we should see
[1:39:58] churches fighting churches we should see
[1:40:01] countries fighting countries
[1:40:02] we should see things falling apart and
[1:40:06] crumbling
[1:40:08] when we see all these things we can be
[1:40:09] sure one thing
[1:40:11] god speaking to his people are we
[1:40:13] listening
[1:40:14] are we listening i want to close this up
[1:40:18] and i just want to read your quote
[1:40:25] you see this was a prophet of god
[1:40:31] who came all the way to that place
[1:40:35] of the wave sheath before the people he
[1:40:38] came to that place of adoption where god
[1:40:40] said
[1:40:40] this is my beloved son
[1:40:44] but it wasn't because he was special it
[1:40:47] was simply because god was saying look
[1:40:49] at
[1:40:49] bride here's the first fruits of the
[1:40:52] bride
[1:40:54] here's the first fruits all of you can
[1:40:56] attain the same status
[1:40:58] all of you can attain this same point in
[1:41:00] fact that's what you're called to do
[1:41:03] you're called to be able to walk as adam
[1:41:05] in the garden
[1:41:07] and you know what was so significant
[1:41:08] about adam walking in the garden
[1:41:10] was in the cool of the evening god would
[1:41:12] come down and walk with him
[1:41:14] and speak to him directly lip to ear or
[1:41:17] adam wasn't just
[1:41:19] hearing he was listening and
[1:41:21] understanding
[1:41:22] what god was telling him
[1:41:25] and explaining to him what god was
[1:41:28] communing to him directly it was
[1:41:31] personal
[1:41:32] so personal but that's because adam
[1:41:36] could recognize when god came down
[1:41:39] he could recognize when that
[1:41:43] he would stop and go lord is that you
[1:41:47] is it you i'm hearing just like elijah
[1:41:51] they're in the cave lots of noise
[1:41:54] lots of things happening i'm sure in the
[1:41:56] garden of eden there was plenty of noise
[1:42:00] the birds sang the lions roared they
[1:42:02] were all in harmony and
[1:42:03] happy but how much more do people sing
[1:42:07] and rejoice than when they're happy
[1:42:10] the animals were happy they were
[1:42:11] rejoicing the wind blew through the
[1:42:13] trees
[1:42:14] all the time
[1:42:18] and yet adam was in tune to where he
[1:42:20] could tell the difference
[1:42:22] between that wind blowing through the
[1:42:24] tree and god's presence coming down and
[1:42:28] here we have an example
[1:42:31] of another son of god who came to that
[1:42:34] same place
[1:42:35] and could so recognize god's voice
[1:42:39] when he was moving so sensitive
[1:42:42] each one of you can be that too you can
[1:42:45] be so
[1:42:46] sensitive to the moving of god in your
[1:42:48] lives
[1:42:50] to fully know when he's speaking to you
[1:42:53] and when he's moving
[1:42:54] now let's see what happened we've seen
[1:42:56] through scripture when god spoke
[1:42:57] there's many more go go go into the
[1:43:00] scripture i challenge you
[1:43:02] and see look when god spoke to his sons
[1:43:05] and his daughters
[1:43:06] look through each instance when god came
[1:43:08] and spoke
[1:43:10] and see how he did it when why
[1:43:14] and what the outcome was it's important
[1:43:17] this is not just a book of fairy tales
[1:43:19] and stories
[1:43:21] this is specific it's telling us how god
[1:43:25] has done things from the beginning
[1:43:26] and how he'll do them throughout
[1:43:28] eternity because he's a
[1:43:30] unchanging god so here we can see this
[1:43:34] was
[1:43:34] scripture and many of us could maybe
[1:43:37] discount it maybe
[1:43:38] the brain has kicked in and you went
[1:43:40] well
[1:43:41] you know those are all true things i
[1:43:43] believe it
[1:43:45] but the most recent happening was 2 000
[1:43:47] years ago
[1:43:50] maybe it doesn't happen anymore
[1:43:53] i have an example much more recent okay
[1:43:57] let's look at it i know it's a little
[1:44:00] bit late but i'm going to read the whole
[1:44:02] thing i think it's
[1:44:03] good i think it's important it's in the
[1:44:06] message
[1:44:07] he that is in you 1963.
[1:44:11] and for those of you who write it down
[1:44:12] it's starting with paragraph 92
[1:44:15] says brother tom is here brother tom
[1:44:16] simpson coming down from canada heard
[1:44:18] the forecast he was advised not to go
[1:44:20] through that part of the country because
[1:44:22] this forecast said
[1:44:23] it'll be a blizzard where are you
[1:44:26] brother tom i think
[1:44:27] that's right yeah right here he the
[1:44:30] blizzard was coming everybody had done
[1:44:32] set in for it
[1:44:33] everyone had set in oh you've been in
[1:44:36] minnesota long enough you know what a
[1:44:37] storm looks like you know
[1:44:39] when you prepare and get ready you get
[1:44:42] prepared to stay in one spot
[1:44:44] and hang tight this is not just a light
[1:44:48] snowstorm this is a blizzard
[1:44:50] this is meant to kill you if you stay
[1:44:52] out in it
[1:44:55] well i put my gun back under my shirt
[1:44:57] like this
[1:44:58] the brown without hunting under my shirt
[1:45:01] like this my red shirt started walking
[1:45:03] down the mountain as i started i got
[1:45:04] about half a mile from the saddle
[1:45:06] and oh my the big drops of snow like
[1:45:08] that the wind twisting up
[1:45:10] on the mountain i couldn't see the
[1:45:11] bottom no more
[1:45:16] i could see about 20 feet in front of me
[1:45:18] or 30 maybe
[1:45:20] and i knowed to come right down this
[1:45:22] little what we call a little hog back
[1:45:24] little ridge then come off to the creek
[1:45:26] then i know to follow the creek
[1:45:29] and where to go to if it got real bad
[1:45:32] he's got his landmarks he knows where
[1:45:34] he's going
[1:45:36] he knows if i stay on this path i'll get
[1:45:38] back to the cabin i'll get back to
[1:45:40] safety
[1:45:41] okay and so then i started down and got
[1:45:44] about halfway down there and something
[1:45:46] said to me
[1:45:47] just as plain as you hear me stop
[1:45:50] and go back
[1:45:54] you see many times like i was saying we
[1:45:57] think the
[1:45:59] tests and trials we go through or
[1:46:03] we don't see them as a blessing we see
[1:46:05] the snowstorm we see the
[1:46:07] the storms building we see what appears
[1:46:10] to be like if i don't stay on course
[1:46:12] if i don't stay on my current course i'm
[1:46:14] i'm a dead
[1:46:15] i'm dead there's no surviving this
[1:46:19] but god wants to come to you in that
[1:46:21] moment
[1:46:22] and say stop stop no
[1:46:26] go this other way and if you are too
[1:46:29] much
[1:46:31] still in that position where you're
[1:46:33] you're trying to run
[1:46:34] off of your own ability your own
[1:46:37] thoughts
[1:46:38] and your own past experience
[1:46:41] your reaction be like nah that can't be
[1:46:43] god
[1:46:45] god would never send me into danger he
[1:46:48] wouldn't do that
[1:46:52] and you're right god will never send you
[1:46:56] into danger
[1:46:58] because where he goes with you you're in
[1:47:01] total safety
[1:47:03] and if something does happen it's
[1:47:05] because he's allowed it for his purpose
[1:47:07] and for his glory just like the man born
[1:47:10] blind
[1:47:12] everyone was convinced is this the sin
[1:47:14] of his parents or his own sin
[1:47:16] no no no it was for god's glory
[1:47:19] it was for god's glory the whole time
[1:47:22] the storm
[1:47:23] it's for god's glory
[1:47:26] it's not god punishing you it's not god
[1:47:29] trying to
[1:47:32] judge you in some way it's for his glory
[1:47:36] the storm is for his glory but are you
[1:47:38] listening
[1:47:39] are you listening the storm's all around
[1:47:42] you
[1:47:43] visibility you can't see where you're
[1:47:44] going you can't see a way out
[1:47:48] of this situation that you're in
[1:47:51] whatever it might be apply it to any
[1:47:53] situation
[1:47:54] this is a physical situation with a
[1:47:57] literal storm
[1:47:58] but we all go through storms on a daily
[1:48:00] basis
[1:48:01] we all face a storm in our life every
[1:48:03] day
[1:48:04] it doesn't have to be like catastrophic
[1:48:06] like i'm losing my home tomorrow
[1:48:10] we each go through a storm in our life
[1:48:12] every day
[1:48:14] something that you face that you need
[1:48:17] god to step on the scene
[1:48:19] and you need to be able to be sensitive
[1:48:21] in the midst of that storm in your
[1:48:22] situation
[1:48:24] where you hear god speak and say stop
[1:48:28] you know why because scripture says be
[1:48:30] still
[1:48:32] and know that i am lord. doesn't say run
[1:48:35] all over
[1:48:36] try and fix it yourself it says hold on
[1:48:38] whoa
[1:48:39] now he's not going to want you to stay
[1:48:41] still next thing he's going to do is
[1:48:42] he's going to tell you to do something
[1:48:44] he's going to give you instructions but
[1:48:46] if you're not listening
[1:48:48] and you disregard the stop you won't
[1:48:50] hear the instructions that follow
[1:48:52] okay just as plain as you hear me stop
[1:48:56] and go back well i thought what was i
[1:48:59] thinking
[1:49:00] about maybe it's just my mind
[1:49:03] here's the prophet he's he's heard the
[1:49:05] voice of god many times
[1:49:07] yet in the midst of the storm in this
[1:49:08] situation he's thinking well
[1:49:10] maybe it's just my mind playing tricks
[1:49:12] on me
[1:49:14] and i just couldn't make another step
[1:49:15] forward
[1:49:17] see but in that moment he said you know
[1:49:18] what until i know
[1:49:21] i'm not moving i'm staying right here
[1:49:24] he said david did fix me a sandwich that
[1:49:27] morning and i think he tried to get even
[1:49:28] with me for fixing his daddy one one
[1:49:30] time of onion and honey
[1:49:32] that's all we had so he fixed me a
[1:49:34] baloney and oh i don't know what all was
[1:49:36] in it
[1:49:37] was wrapped in there and i had it in my
[1:49:38] shirt it got wet through my shirt i
[1:49:41] thought
[1:49:41] i'll just stop and eat this and maybe
[1:49:44] it'll be all right then
[1:49:45] maybe it's just my nerves maybe it's
[1:49:48] just
[1:49:50] the brain fine tricks on me
[1:49:54] so i pulled out the sandwich and about
[1:49:56] 10 o'clock i started eating the sandwich
[1:49:57] and as i
[1:49:58] ate the sandwich i thought now i'll be
[1:50:01] all right
[1:50:02] i'll be okay and i started to move on he
[1:50:05] kept going in his own direction
[1:50:06] back heading back towards safety but
[1:50:09] something said go back
[1:50:10] where you come from more insistent
[1:50:16] go back through that storm a half a mile
[1:50:19] or more back up the mountain into the
[1:50:20] dark that dark timber
[1:50:22] where you can hardly see as far as that
[1:50:24] organ i don't know how old again
[1:50:26] far the organ was but i believe he was
[1:50:27] in the tabernacle and the tabernacle was
[1:50:30] maybe maybe
[1:50:30] i don't know i've not been there but
[1:50:32] i've heard it's maybe only twice the
[1:50:33] size of this building here
[1:50:35] so you can only be maybe 10 or 15
[1:50:36] minutes on a platform 10 or 15 feet or
[1:50:39] more
[1:50:39] from an organ on a platform of that size
[1:50:43] so visibility has dropped in half of
[1:50:45] what it was originally
[1:50:48] but i'm getting to be an old man
[1:50:51] and i've been a christian now for 33
[1:50:53] years
[1:50:55] and i know no matter what how ridiculous
[1:50:58] it seems
[1:50:59] mind the lord do what the lord says
[1:51:03] you see he mentions here his experience
[1:51:06] with the lord and experiences of when he
[1:51:10] did not listen
[1:51:12] he had many but there's two main ones
[1:51:13] that we can think of right off the bat
[1:51:15] when the lord first commissioned him to
[1:51:17] go amongst the pentecostal people and
[1:51:20] his wife's mother
[1:51:21] told him how dare you drag
[1:51:24] my daughter out amongst that trash
[1:51:28] and due to the influence of his
[1:51:30] mother-in-law
[1:51:31] he didn't follow god's leading god's
[1:51:34] voice speaking to him
[1:51:36] directly and due to that his wife passed
[1:51:39] away
[1:51:40] and his baby girl later on
[1:51:44] there's another instance he was in south
[1:51:46] africa having meetings
[1:51:48] and god had specifically told him where
[1:51:50] to go
[1:51:51] when to go how to go and he would bless
[1:51:53] it but the ministerial association
[1:51:57] the church a woman once again
[1:52:02] came to him and said no due to church
[1:52:05] politics
[1:52:07] and those who have influence within the
[1:52:09] church politics
[1:52:11] we have to go to these locations because
[1:52:12] we promised them that we would
[1:52:16] and brother balon had to make a decision
[1:52:18] go with
[1:52:19] church or go with god
[1:52:24] and he chose to go with the church now
[1:52:27] many people when they first saw they
[1:52:29] said well god was
[1:52:30] still in it because god told him the
[1:52:31] angel lord told him he said i'll bless
[1:52:33] it
[1:52:33] but you'll pay for it he said every one
[1:52:37] of those ministers
[1:52:38] just about died but a man
[1:52:41] caught an amoeba that almost killed him
[1:52:44] if it wasn't for that god still had a
[1:52:46] work for him to do
[1:52:48] and here he gets to a place he says
[1:52:53] i'm where he where he's heard the voice
[1:52:57] speak to him again
[1:52:59] and he's going back up there he says but
[1:53:02] i'm getting to be an old man
[1:53:04] and i've been a christian now for 33
[1:53:06] years
[1:53:08] and i know no matter how ridiculous it
[1:53:11] seems
[1:53:12] mind the lord do what the lord says
[1:53:16] don't worry about what other people are
[1:53:18] doing don't worry about
[1:53:20] someone else's counsel if you can
[1:53:22] confirm
[1:53:24] this is where god's leading me it
[1:53:26] doesn't matter what the obstacle looks
[1:53:27] like
[1:53:28] press on just like the man they asked
[1:53:31] him he said
[1:53:32] you know they asked me they said he
[1:53:35] couldn't read the bible
[1:53:37] and they asked him do you believe every
[1:53:39] word that's in that bible
[1:53:40] they said i do i said well what if that
[1:53:44] bible told you to go run and jump
[1:53:45] through that wall
[1:53:47] he said well then i'd run jump through
[1:53:48] that wall he said but there's no hole
[1:53:50] there he said when
[1:53:51] i got to the wall and jumped there'd be
[1:53:53] a hole for me to go through
[1:53:56] you see that's the kind of faith god's
[1:53:58] looking for you to have in his word
[1:54:00] and it all starts with listening because
[1:54:02] if you're if you do not believe the word
[1:54:04] from the best
[1:54:06] it'll never manifest into an action
[1:54:09] you can hear all you want you can sit in
[1:54:12] this church
[1:54:13] you can take the the tapes and the
[1:54:14] messages
[1:54:16] and take and download all 1200 plus
[1:54:19] sermons
[1:54:20] you can listen to every single one of
[1:54:21] them you can memorize the scripture line
[1:54:23] by line
[1:54:25] but until you're actually listening
[1:54:29] and understanding what god is trying to
[1:54:32] tell you through that scripture through
[1:54:34] that word
[1:54:36] it won't change you one bit it will have
[1:54:38] no effect
[1:54:41] okay and i turned and went back to the
[1:54:43] saddle feeling my way back
[1:54:45] old asleep getting harder and harder
[1:54:46] getting darker and darker
[1:54:48] and i sit down there and just put my
[1:54:51] coat up like this
[1:54:52] his conditions hadn't changed or my
[1:54:55] shirt
[1:54:56] over the scope again i sat down i
[1:54:57] thought what am i doing here
[1:55:00] why would i come back up here
[1:55:04] he doesn't know
[1:55:07] he's gone all the way back up and now
[1:55:10] he's just sitting there
[1:55:11] he says i don't what am i doing here why
[1:55:14] did i come back
[1:55:14] up here if nothing changes
[1:55:18] the only option is death
[1:55:21] the only option is death see god didn't
[1:55:23] give him a whole long spiel ahead of
[1:55:25] time
[1:55:25] he didn't give him a vision be like okay
[1:55:28] so you're going to be in colorado you're
[1:55:29] going to be hunting
[1:55:30] there's going to be a storm coming in i
[1:55:33] want you to be aware of this because
[1:55:35] when it comes in
[1:55:36] i'm going to give you the ability to
[1:55:38] speak the word and speak that storm out
[1:55:40] of
[1:55:40] existence god has i was at a point with
[1:55:44] this prophet
[1:55:44] i'd appoint with his son where he did
[1:55:47] not want that to be the case
[1:55:49] because in the beginning of his ministry
[1:55:50] it had been
[1:55:53] there was points where the the visions
[1:55:55] were coming
[1:55:56] so much and so often brother branham
[1:55:59] refused to move
[1:56:01] unless he saw a vision if he didn't see
[1:56:03] a vision he didn't go nowhere
[1:56:05] and the angel lord came to him and said
[1:56:07] you need to stop that
[1:56:09] he said i'll give you a vision from time
[1:56:11] to time but you already have thus saith
[1:56:13] the lord
[1:56:14] it's right here
[1:56:17] thus saith the lord for the believer
[1:56:21] says the prayer of the of faith will
[1:56:23] heal the sick
[1:56:24] you don't need a vision for the healing
[1:56:26] of the sick that's just something nice
[1:56:28] for you
[1:56:29] that's just for a sign stop following
[1:56:31] that
[1:56:32] now get up and walk by faith step out
[1:56:35] the door
[1:56:35] on the word believing that it's true
[1:56:40] you see so he wasn't going to give him a
[1:56:42] vision where he didn't require faith
[1:56:45] because this was a test of his faith
[1:56:48] just like abraham
[1:56:49] when he took isaac up on the mountain
[1:56:51] god spoke to him
[1:56:54] and he had to understand what god was
[1:56:55] saying he had a revelation
[1:56:58] that what god was asking him to do was
[1:57:00] take isaac up there and sacrifice him
[1:57:04] because if he would have listened with
[1:57:05] his own ideas his own
[1:57:07] understanding and be like wow isaac gave
[1:57:09] he gave him
[1:57:10] to me and he's my only heir and he's
[1:57:12] promised
[1:57:13] me that through him my generations after
[1:57:16] generation will
[1:57:17] people of as the sound of the sea so he
[1:57:19] must not mean he wants me to kill him
[1:57:22] and sacrifice him he must mean this is
[1:57:25] some type of
[1:57:28] maybe type or this is just like
[1:57:33] uh he's just trying to see what i do
[1:57:37] he doesn't really want me to do this
[1:57:39] exactly because everything else he's
[1:57:40] told me doesn't line up with this
[1:57:42] how possibly can he be my heir if i kill
[1:57:45] him
[1:57:47] but no god spoke abraham said
[1:57:50] yes lord because he was at the same
[1:57:52] place where brother branham said he was
[1:57:54] he said i'm an old man and everyone said
[1:57:56] i'm an old man
[1:57:58] and i've been a christian for quite a
[1:58:00] while now
[1:58:02] i've seen what not listening does it
[1:58:03] gets me in egypt
[1:58:05] trying to pass off my wife as my sister
[1:58:08] and it didn't work out well
[1:58:11] so he'd come to the place where he said
[1:58:13] lord if you say it i don't understand it
[1:58:15] but i'll do it when i get there
[1:58:18] i still don't understand it here brother
[1:58:20] adam was he got to that he'd walk to the
[1:58:23] place where he thought he was meant to
[1:58:24] be
[1:58:24] he sat down he said what am i doing here
[1:58:28] why would i come back up here i'm sure
[1:58:30] abraham when he got to the top of the
[1:58:31] mountain
[1:58:32] and he gets to the point where i says
[1:58:34] where's the sacrifice and he says
[1:58:36] it's you buddy i don't know why god
[1:58:39] wants me to do this
[1:58:40] i don't know why i'm here but he said to
[1:58:43] do it and i'm here
[1:58:45] and i just waited a few minutes here he
[1:58:48] is he's waiting on the lord
[1:58:50] and i started to get up again and just
[1:58:53] as plain as i'd ever want to hear a
[1:58:55] voice said
[1:58:56] i am the creator of heavens and earth
[1:59:01] and i make the winds and the rain i took
[1:59:04] off my hat
[1:59:06] you see it always has the same reaction
[1:59:08] with the sons of god
[1:59:11] when his presence comes by we can't help
[1:59:14] but
[1:59:14] bow our head in humility elijah there
[1:59:18] on the mount when he heard this the
[1:59:20] thunder we saw there the thunder the
[1:59:22] earthquake
[1:59:23] he didn't phase elijah but then he heard
[1:59:26] that still small voice and he
[1:59:28] covered his face and he said lord i'm
[1:59:30] not worthy of your presence
[1:59:34] here the prophet of god in our age you
[1:59:36] know he
[1:59:37] was following what he believed to be
[1:59:39] god's voice
[1:59:40] and he gets there and he's waiting
[1:59:44] and all of a sudden god's presence just
[1:59:46] steps down on the scene and he says i
[1:59:48] am the creator of heaven's earth
[1:59:51] i make the wind and the rain
[1:59:55] and he recognizes that presence and his
[1:59:57] hat comes off
[1:59:59] he's still standing in the storm you
[2:00:01] know that
[2:00:02] it's still storming
[2:00:07] nothing has changed with the storm yet
[2:00:10] you still have feet of snow accumulating
[2:00:13] on the ground
[2:00:14] you still can't see more than 10 feet
[2:00:16] out
[2:00:17] nothing has changed in the circumstances
[2:00:20] except for god's presence is on the
[2:00:22] scene
[2:00:24] and it didn't matter how much snow was
[2:00:25] landing on his head
[2:00:27] he took his hat off in humility and i
[2:00:30] said
[2:00:31] great jehovah is that you
[2:00:35] is that you
[2:00:38] he said i was the one who made the winds
[2:00:40] to cease upon the sea
[2:00:42] i was the one who made the waves to go
[2:00:44] down
[2:00:46] i created heavens and earth was not
[2:00:49] i not the one that told you to speak for
[2:00:52] those squirrels
[2:00:57] he he's identifying himself to the
[2:01:00] believer
[2:01:01] every time he comes by he'll he'll
[2:01:03] reveal himself to you
[2:01:05] if you're paying attention if you're
[2:01:06] listening
[2:01:08] it doesn't matter where you're at right
[2:01:10] now we're here we're in a church
[2:01:12] building
[2:01:14] you know but it's just a building it's
[2:01:17] just a building
[2:01:19] the presence of god is here is because
[2:01:21] you're here you're here
[2:01:22] you're here he's not here for the
[2:01:24] building
[2:01:27] he's here for his children he's looking
[2:01:30] to speak to you
[2:01:32] he's looking to move in your life his
[2:01:34] presence is here now
[2:01:37] that's not just something we say it's a
[2:01:39] reality
[2:01:42] but it's are we listening are we paying
[2:01:48] attention
[2:01:52] i created heavens and earth was not i
[2:01:54] not the one that told you to speak for
[2:01:55] those
[2:01:56] to those for those squirrels and they
[2:01:58] come into existence
[2:02:00] i am god now when a voice speaks to you
[2:02:04] watch the scripture if it's not
[2:02:07] scriptural you leave it alone you see
[2:02:10] the prophet didn't just leave it he
[2:02:12] realized okay
[2:02:13] this may cause some fanaticism this may
[2:02:16] cause some people to run around and just
[2:02:17] claim
[2:02:19] god spoke to me and this is what we're
[2:02:20] supposed to do because there's plenty of
[2:02:22] those
[2:02:24] there's plenty of false prophets eighth
[2:02:26] messengers
[2:02:28] false messiahs as they were in jesus
[2:02:32] time he said many false christs shall
[2:02:34] come
[2:02:35] he said don't believe it they'll say
[2:02:36] he's off in the wilderness they'll say
[2:02:38] he's here he said
[2:02:38] don't believe in one of them well i say
[2:02:41] unto you many
[2:02:42] false doctrines have come
[2:02:45] don't believe one of them stay with the
[2:02:48] word
[2:02:49] because the prophet always took us back
[2:02:50] to the word he always brought us back to
[2:02:52] christ
[2:02:53] and here he is even in the midst of this
[2:02:55] he's relaying this he says when a voice
[2:02:57] speaks to you
[2:02:58] watch the scripture if it's not
[2:03:00] scriptural you leave it alone
[2:03:02] i don't care how plain it is you stay
[2:03:04] away from it
[2:03:07] so now we know how to judge accordingly
[2:03:10] you want to know of god speaking to you
[2:03:13] go back to thus saith the lord and see
[2:03:16] does it line up
[2:03:18] can i go through scripture and see how
[2:03:20] god
[2:03:21] is dealing with my life because he's
[2:03:23] done it before
[2:03:24] in the lives of his sons and his
[2:03:26] daughters has he spoke to someone else
[2:03:28] that way before
[2:03:30] is he has he directed someone else like
[2:03:32] that before if so
[2:03:34] you can stand on it and move forward
[2:03:37] if not rebuke it
[2:03:46] i said yes lord he said speak to those
[2:03:49] winds
[2:03:50] and that storm and it will go away now
[2:03:53] this bible lays before me which my life
[2:03:55] is in
[2:03:56] that i raised up and i said i do not
[2:03:58] doubt your voice lord
[2:04:00] you see he had to believe a hundred
[2:04:03] percent
[2:04:05] if there had been a slightest amount of
[2:04:07] doubt it wouldn't have worked even the
[2:04:10] slightest just
[2:04:12] any doubt because
[2:04:16] although the faith the side of a mustard
[2:04:19] seed will move a mountain
[2:04:21] a speck of dust will hold that mountain
[2:04:24] in place
[2:04:25] of doubt you have to believe it
[2:04:29] 100 there's no turning back
[2:04:32] there's no alternative
[2:04:40] in the name of jesus christ go to your
[2:04:42] places
[2:04:43] i say that the sun must come out
[2:04:44] immediately and shine for four days
[2:04:47] till our hunting trip is over and i
[2:04:49] leave with my brethren
[2:04:50] it was just gushing just went like that
[2:04:54] and it started going then it went
[2:05:01] and stopped i stood real still
[2:05:06] my brethren up there wondering what was
[2:05:08] happening in the sleep
[2:05:10] rain stopped there came a wind whirling
[2:05:12] down through the mountains
[2:05:13] lifted up the clouds and one went this
[2:05:16] way east
[2:05:17] north west and south and within a few
[2:05:19] minutes the sun was shining nice and
[2:05:21] warm
[2:05:22] that's the truth god knows that's the
[2:05:24] truth
[2:05:26] i just stood there just looking around
[2:05:27] with my hat off looking
[2:05:29] you say i got all numb i got numb all
[2:05:32] over i thought
[2:05:35] the very god of creation it's all in his
[2:05:38] hands
[2:05:40] what's he telling me
[2:05:46] and i picked up my gun and wiped off the
[2:05:47] scope started walk
[2:05:49] back go down the hill see he thought
[2:05:52] well
[2:05:53] okay this was it this is all god was
[2:05:57] it happened
[2:06:00] he begins walking away
[2:06:04] and something said to me why don't you
[2:06:06] stroll
[2:06:07] with me through this wilderness walk
[2:06:10] with me
[2:06:12] and i said yes lord with all my heart
[2:06:15] it'd be one of the greatest things i
[2:06:17] could do was walk with you
[2:06:19] so i put my gun over my shoulder and i
[2:06:20] started walking down through that
[2:06:22] never an axe laid in it virgin timber
[2:06:25] walking through there
[2:06:26] as i did walked along down along these
[2:06:29] game trails i felt like
[2:06:30] i believe i'll just go up to the place
[2:06:32] where yesterday was our anniversary i
[2:06:34] will stand there
[2:06:35] just a few minutes just as a salute to
[2:06:37] meeta
[2:06:39] where it's a little bunch of quaking ass
[2:06:40] up on a little knob
[2:06:42] i said well believe i'll walk up there
[2:06:44] just as a salute to our anniversary
[2:06:46] then i'll go back down on this other
[2:06:47] side in these dark timbers and walk
[2:06:49] around
[2:06:50] and go around over by towards the coral
[2:06:52] peaks
[2:06:53] and come back down that way just walking
[2:06:55] and rejoicing
[2:06:56] i was saying father i know you're
[2:06:59] walking with me
[2:07:00] and what a privilege there's no buddy
[2:07:03] great earth
[2:07:04] that i could be walking with the very
[2:07:07] god
[2:07:07] and that warm sunshine amen musicians if
[2:07:11] you would come
[2:07:12] you see sayings this aren't this is not
[2:07:14] just a story these are not just stories
[2:07:16] through scripture of god speaking to his
[2:07:18] people
[2:07:18] this is not just stories of god
[2:07:21] coming down and meeting this is not just
[2:07:23] stories of power and might and
[2:07:25] thunder and lightning and all these
[2:07:28] things
[2:07:29] it's not just a story
[2:07:33] it's god wanting to speak to his people
[2:07:36] it's god wine commune
[2:07:39] he's wanting to come down and just begin
[2:07:42] whispering in your ear
[2:07:44] that love story's so sweet he's wanting
[2:07:47] to speak to your heart
[2:07:49] he's wanting you to open the door he's
[2:07:52] wanting to come in and fellowship with
[2:07:54] you
[2:07:56] it's all he's ever wanted from the
[2:07:58] beginning of time
[2:08:00] from the time that adam was here upon
[2:08:03] the earth
[2:08:05] all he wanted was fellowship fellowship
[2:08:08] with his sons and his daughters
[2:08:10] fellowships with his attributes
[2:08:13] you say attributes yeah you
[2:08:17] you each one of you you are an attribute
[2:08:21] of god you are a piece of god
[2:08:26] that could only just displayed
[2:08:28] [Music]
[2:08:30] in the character he made you there was
[2:08:33] no way
[2:08:34] other for him to express that part of
[2:08:35] himself outside of you
[2:08:37] [Music]
[2:08:40] so don't think for a moment
[2:08:43] that you're insignificant it's not true
[2:08:48] this body of flesh will drop away yeah
[2:08:51] there's nothing to it it's just a house
[2:08:56] it's just a house of corruption
[2:08:58] [Music]
[2:09:00] but there's something calling from the
[2:09:04] eternal realm
[2:09:05] calling you back to that
[2:09:09] [Music]
[2:09:11] to that picture
[2:09:14] of who you were from before the
[2:09:15] beginning
[2:09:17] who you were as a spoken word of god
[2:09:20] expressed
[2:09:22] you are his word expressed
[2:09:26] that's why you need to be able to hear
[2:09:28] it and understand
[2:09:30] because through the understanding that
[2:09:32] you'll recognize yourself
[2:09:34] because you'll recognize i'm not just
[2:09:35] hearing a word i'm not just hearing
[2:09:38] a sound i'm not just hearing a voice
[2:09:44] but i'm hearing myself revealed
[2:09:47] as i truly am and you begin to see the
[2:09:50] picture become clearer
[2:09:52] and clearer but if we're not paying
[2:09:56] attention
[2:09:58] we're like the eagle that comes to that
[2:10:00] moping period
[2:10:04] comes to the moping period its talons
[2:10:07] are soft
[2:10:08] its beak is grown over and because it
[2:10:12] can't see the potential beyond that
[2:10:14] it just lands on the ground and dies
[2:10:17] there
[2:10:18] he'll die an eagle
[2:10:21] but he'll never reach his fullest
[2:10:23] potential
[2:10:25] but if you hear that still small voice
[2:10:27] calling you up the mountain
[2:10:29] calling you to that rock of revelation
[2:10:31] of who you are
[2:10:33] and what god's potential is for your
[2:10:35] life
[2:10:36] you'll go up there will be a painful
[2:10:37] process a be a stripping away of your
[2:10:40] old self
[2:10:43] it won't be pleasant but you'll come out
[2:10:46] of it
[2:10:46] more than conquerors recognizing
[2:10:50] god is moving in your life let's just
[2:10:53] pray
[2:10:55] heavenly father lord we just thank you
[2:10:57] for coming by here this evening father
[2:10:59] lord
[2:11:01] oh your presence is so sweet father lord
[2:11:05] we ask for revelation father revelation
[2:11:08] of
[2:11:09] who we are father lord we know you're
[2:11:12] the
[2:11:13] god you're the creator of the universe
[2:11:15] you're the mighty one your elohim
[2:11:19] the lord to be able to see ourselves in
[2:11:22] you that's
[2:11:23] what we truly desire father
[2:11:26] it's easy to see
[2:11:29] omnipotence in god
[2:11:33] it's easy to see
[2:11:37] there in the act of the cross god's love
[2:11:41] god's grace god's mercy god's
[2:11:43] forgiveness
[2:11:45] but lord you didn't meant for us to see
[2:11:48] it in the scripture
[2:11:50] you didn't mean for us just to see it in
[2:11:52] the cross
[2:11:53] but you're looking for us to become a
[2:11:56] living manifestation of those attributes
[2:11:58] father
[2:11:59] that we would be the ones expressing
[2:12:01] that grace that forgiveness your love
[2:12:05] that would become a lived life father
[2:12:10] lord that we would become the word not
[2:12:13] just understand it
[2:12:15] not just see it revealed but actually
[2:12:18] become the living word
[2:12:20] father lord your very word lived out
[2:12:23] amongst the people
[2:12:24] that as we'd walk through these streets
[2:12:26] father
[2:12:27] there would be such an atmosphere that
[2:12:29] those in need of healing
[2:12:32] those in need of grace those in need of
[2:12:35] forgiveness
[2:12:36] oh father they could receive it not
[2:12:39] anything of ourselves
[2:12:40] father but that
[2:12:43] which you are expressing through us
[2:12:47] lords we just dedicate ourselves back to
[2:12:49] you once again
[2:12:50] dedicate these people i would ask you to
[2:12:53] bless them for
[2:12:54] being here hearing listening
[2:12:57] father lord i ask you to give each one
[2:13:00] including myself
[2:13:01] understanding father of your word a
[2:13:04] greater revelation

[2:13:08] sensitive to the moving of your presence
[2:13:10] father lord that

[2:17:06] want to
[2:17:07] appreciate the lord for there tonight
[2:17:11] you know uh brother branham actually
[2:17:14] said something i was going to read
[2:17:15] something from the church ages but
[2:17:17] we fire past over the service time
[2:17:19] tonight so
[2:17:20] uh you know he taught about the
[2:17:22] listening ability
[2:17:24] you know that that god brings us to and
[2:17:27] it's beautiful in some of the things
[2:17:28] that brother jordan shared with us
[2:17:30] tonight
[2:17:31] if you look at the scripture and
[2:17:34] your moses experience with the burning
[2:17:36] bush
[2:17:37] you hear the scripture talking about god
[2:17:40] speaks
[2:17:41] and god says take out your shoes
[2:17:44] and it was only moses that here there
[2:17:48] it was only moses to the natural mind
[2:17:52] it looks crazy for the man talking to a
[2:17:54] fire
[2:17:57] it looks crazy david heard god's voice
[2:18:01] in the wind
[2:18:01] [Music]
[2:18:04] he says lord until you speak i'm not
[2:18:06] going to go
[2:18:07] and when the wind came in a mob the
[2:18:08] muppet trees
[2:18:10] he heard god speaking
[2:18:14] praise the lord you know when
[2:18:18] and and and like the scripture
[2:18:19] identified gulf wars walking
[2:18:22] in the garden of eden it's it you know
[2:18:24] uh
[2:18:25] uh we must be grateful you know like
[2:18:27] brother branham said
[2:18:29] in the church age books you know god
[2:18:31] raised men through the ages
[2:18:34] even the translation of the bible to be
[2:18:37] able to bring
[2:18:38] our mind to the place to understand
[2:18:41] some of the things that that we now
[2:18:44] understand
[2:18:45] you know for the man to really hear the
[2:18:48] voice of god
[2:18:49] you know he i mean he has to be he has
[2:18:52] to be
[2:18:53] captured into god's presence he has to
[2:18:55] be
[2:18:56] close up into his presence so we just
