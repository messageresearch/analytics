TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but then I have the picture League present here if you noticed as Life magazine had it but I wonder if my audience visible your has ever really looked at the picture same thing anyway it should be you remember I was preaching when this vision came upon the subject of the book of the revelations were the old judges or we've seen Jesus and revelations one when we started to open the seven seals of the church ages brother just prior to the opening of the Seventh Seal Christ was standing with hair like wool white and I describe that to you that the old English judges and judges have long ago when they went to the bench to be sworn in their supreme authority was given them they wore a white wig as it was over their heads to show their supreme authority well if you'll turn the picture like this and look you probably sniffing the audience its Christ so your eyes looking here just as perfect as Ditka be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth can you see these eyes noses mouths just turn the picture from this great ahead it this way the way it's supposed to be and you can you see it his supreme judges not other but him and that is a perfect identification again of hven dication of this message is the truth making him not a third person but the only person was the white CC the dark his face is there in his eyes and notice he's looking from him comes this light shining on the right hand side to which is looking at you Krauss that's where he looked to the right or he part the center and the life of his resurrection we still go forth in his name I wish this morning that I had much time to say that all these phenomena that's beyond any shadow of doubt been proven for the past 30 years or 35 years right here at this church that's down on the river well that same light came down here in Jeffersonville in 1933 and spoke those words as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ you're a message before on the second we're at the end time and we see it we wonder sometimes why hasn't spread all over the earth maybe sometime we'll have a chance to explain that if God willing now I want you to turn him in your Bibles as we always believe that the word must come first of the reading of the word I always read that because if five words is the word of a man it will fail but the Word of God can never fail now we're going to read from the Holy Scriptures okay and we want you to turn first to three places in the Bible that I have chosen to read from one of them is in Revelation the first chapter and 17th and 18th verse this is where he appeared with his hair white as wool and his feet was like brass and then I want you also to get in your Bibles Romans 8:11 I've chosen this morning three places to read from the Holy Scriptures farma message today that the Lord has placed upon my heart for the resurrection and then I want you to also mark 16:1 and to there I will draw my my context now in revelation 1:18 we read these words a 17 and 18 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not for I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of death and hell and in Romans the eighth chapter and eleventh verse we read this but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that grow up in you and now and Mark the 16th chapter a chapter of the resurrection the sixteen chapters the first and second verses and when the Sabbath repairs Mary Magdalene mother and Mary the mother of James and slowly has brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the Sun now my text this morning I want to take four it is the rising of the Sun and for a subject I want to use the quickening power now you know you perhaps have been hearing the radio and the different ministers speaking our noble brother Neville this morning speaking his Easter subject on the resurrection and I thought maybe I would take it a little different path not to be different but just to add a little more maybe in another angle for you just scriptures every angle you go with the scriptures it always declared Jesus Christ you cannot get away from it anyway they always declared him now as the world today in a memorial service or at least in the United States in this side of the earth this morning and the churches throughout are celebrating a memorial of the greatest triumph that man ever had I think as Savior when he died all as an infant when he was born he could not have been your left being coming into the earth and when he died shortly you thrown for our sins but yet there's been many fine little babies born and there's been many men who have suffered his dies or real cause but there never was one I could raise yourself up again until this day now that it is the greatest we can history the greatest celebration of all times this Easter is where he proved what he had said man can see things but yet it isn't exactly can be relieved of all clearly until it's been proved to be the truth and is God who said prove all things hold fast to that which is good he would not tell you to do something that he would not do insult so he proved who this was that died our sin and now not only is it a memorial T of all these great Easter flowers Easter bonnets and pink rabbits so forth that we've got attitude and holy celebration which is all right but this is not the real thing and that way as people today are trying to say we should wash the horse the year on Thursday on Friday we should take the communion and all different doctors they argue about whether it should be this day or that day which should be a Sabbath day or the first day of the week or all these things are just merely tradition that's good would any of it do you when you had lit or not limp if there's no life in you it's only of Memorial which is nothing against it but they have certainly carried out their traditions but let that the main thing Satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctoring is you miss that life your won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to I will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again therefore if God raised up Jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial and is this resurrection morning only up or watering in the year or certain day that we celebrate this all are we benefactors of his resurrection what does that mean to me what does it mean do you not we believe by faith that he raised from the dead but what has that got to do with me that was 2000 years ago now to find this text over-tired my arm hurting me from shock that the nurse gave me for leave overseas now as you know in a few days but heavy shops on and on and with colouring yellow fever and everything I was pretty weary making me sick which Caesar requires to have these shops before you go into the other nation and he said give Caesar that which is Caesars but then give God that which is God and I was sitting there wondering what would I speak to this waiting audience this morning which I'm very thankful for and man and women who would lay their life on the line for what you would say how should I do it what should I take for a tick and then model is sitting there all this but sleep my door rattled out on the front side of the house nobody being there but myself as far as I knew listen I didn't get it just right after a while this Dan room door Laura have turned into a steady hit rattle and someone kept shaking the door I went to the door opened the door and to my surprise a pretty little yellow haired blue-eyed girls just there look like a little Easter flower just sitting here look at me now she handed me a card and it was the course I guess when I get home they'll be Easter cards and so forth but the only one being leaving home that I'd received and she said brother branham this is from daddy and me Geor be sure that he was in it and her arthritic father sitting in a wheelchair and set this card when I took it in thank the little darling as she turned and walked away from the door opened up the card and in the farm of this card drew my picks for on the card was the st. mark 16:1 and to shut up the Sun was rising and then I thought of that and then the subject of the clipping of Jesus Christ to be raised up from the data through my subject now the Sun at this rising of the Sun well there was a time when the world was laying in the darkness it was without song and was gone and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the Spirit of God moved upon that water and said let there be light God had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there were seeds that he implanted and it had the hair that the sunlight to make it live and the first light was ever given in the earth or God spoken word the first light it ever struck the earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turns darkness into ice in order to bring forth a creation of joy life upon the earth then the Spirit of God has it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth the Sun rose and swept across his grays and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above at Floyds first time it was the brain joy-ann drive to the earth by a seed that was a great power but all it wasn't nothing that Sun I like the Sun Rise on that Easter morning this time with the Sun leaving into the sky it brought forth a greater sunrise and every because it came greater news with this son arrived then it did with the sunrise at the beginning this sunrise brought a news that He is risen he is quickened from the dead as he promised he's risen from the dead the first time the Sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth more alive but this time when the Sun rose there was a new Sun rising another Sun rising it was it not only if you in rising it was a s all in had risen to bring eternal life to all God's promise see that by foreknowledge he'd seen laying upon the earth no hair could the bothy life live right there at the beginning without the S UN to bring it to life no hair that the day when sons of God is up on the earth it Victor s o in life to bring down to eternal life his chosen words that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world on Easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies that that done or we are the dust of the earth and in living there was a book of memory and his attributes was in him nor anything there called this son of God raised it would also read the life every tongue that was for our date for this great time he knew it would be and alright that was that it was at the beginning at time when it first gone now on this great breaking all the easter seals now today we have a tuberculosis Easter seal people sans a message one to the other as you support this great fun or drive for the doctors and medical science to work upon something to retire to help the tuberculosis they are seal what we call an Easter seal when we send message one to another but when we receive the message that seal is broken because the seal is what got a message found on the inside and now the true Easter seal all this sunrise was broken and the secret of life after death was revealed before that time we didn't know the world grouped in darkness grouped around man suspicion berries was among man's heart tradition made up man worship idols they worshiped the Sun they worshiped all kinds of God and all kinds of people they claim they went into the grave and they stayed in the greatest but the real seal had been broken and one who once live as we live started we will not work risen from the dead morning never one like it in all the history of the world the secret was made known that he was both resurrection and the life and he said when he comes on that morning because I live you live also not only what he's a beneficiary of the resurrection but all those seeds that was resting in God's great promise what a benefactor of that resurrection to life because there because also that was the breaking of the seal because he was brought up so will everyone that in Christ he brought up with him this glorious sunrise God had proven are vindicated his word all the groups of doubt that have moved in people's lives particularly because here what he once live eat drink and fellowship with mankind that's it I have power to lay my life down I have power to raise it up again and now not only had he made the statement that he proved it to be the truth oh thing that is I'm sure this morning that even we believe it cannot cover him what a great thing that was the call he raised from the dead we all thought have already raised from there while we were in him notice now as the groom covered the earth and the seeds cannot live without the SU and derive and gloom and cover the earth and now the fon was risen and all was finished by this light as a spread across the nation to the people that he is not here but he has risen what a what a statement he had proved his words he had proved it be to be true or he had now conquered their hell and agree the Trinity of the devil this hell and agree or Satan is the author of death he is the center of hell and also degree and that were the Trinity of Satan being called by one thing that was depth depth he grew up the grave and being a sinner you go to hell all the big one thing the Trinity of Satan which was death that helped man in captivity all these years but now the true Trinity of God being one men identity Christ who was life and it broke the seal that conquered the enemy and rose up the one true and living God I am he that was dead and I'm alive forevermore peasant keys of death and Hell God in one made man had wrought among us and conquered every enemy I haven't proved that the Trinity of Satan was conquered and at the Trinity of God was made Lord NORs only God power to bring life back together he was that Immanuel God had been manifested in the flesh the whole water he could claim there Matthew the 27th chapter all powers and heaven earth him send you to be my witnesses to all the world he had conquered both death hell and the grave not only did he do that it cut out triumph with all the power and heavens and earth all that was the father all that was the Holy Ghost all that within him all powers in heaven and it is given unto me everything else is powerless he had conquered it now and then not only that he sent word to his disciple just believing beard up for I am T that was dead that is a lot again forevermore I have a key already conquered it don't fear anymore for every heartbeat predestinated seat of God shall comes alive with that life read the cross pietà various thoughts whatever age it'll bring forth the crop that God our danger to do is raised from the dead oh what a wonderful thing that is I am Alive are quickened the word means the word quicken the Greek word means that's something that's made alive after death like the the seed that goes into the earth yes the die every bit of the seed it has to rock every bit of a seat and every bit of the life that was in the seat has to come forth again he was pricking not only that I would send the same light that quicken II the power that brought me from the grave how I ended up on you that quicken you that where I am he will be also in Luke 24 chapter xlix ears he said behold I send the promise of the father upon you but they are waiting in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high the show that not only did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared those benefits he come to redeem our to bring to life those predestinated season Copsey before foundation of the world and but their names in the book of life he came not only to see that nothing but the share the blessings with every predestinated see not if it's equal on the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth but also germanized no matter how long is kept and darkness it'll come forth when the fon shines upon the order now he come to share with us no wonder the gospel is good news the very word gospel means the good news the good news watch if a man died or think that's good news it cries a bard better news but never knew never whether dude like this news that he made the promise has confirmed the promise that he's alive forevermore and hechizo both death and hell anytime all the shut away there is no more room to be seen or the Sun was up from the rain there was no oh he will come he may come he had already come the gospel good news notice the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that He is risen to confirm this to them Oh God how in the last days there shall be like I get across here Oh about is public go tell them I am NOT a tradition but I am a living Christ I'll meet them take this message to murmur a disciple and I'm risen from the dead the gospel good news you say is that right Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever we have been officious hard to prove his life is in us now the beneficiary of this life the life in their wards a life live like it he was the son of God and he died and that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on Easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him they're going into all the world and to bring this canoes to every person that he is a city and how can we do it but word only or it is written the gospel can not buy now if there is another gospel Paul spoke to one of the group's I am so surprised that you turn to another gospel which areas or other but a Bernese gospel to him nomination fiction turning from that good news I had the course I live he live also and I live in you I'm so worse than I do John 14:12 it work that I do will identify Oh wonder we've had a dark royal theology Betty the evening time there shall comes life again there will be a resurrection is it easy that she'll be like that the evening time now the very essence of the message that were set that he is risen from the dead we has beneficiary we who share the resurrection with you draw benefit from this by proving to the world that he is a lot we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it for some traditional mate we only respect that's it what we're pointing - I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to Christ we're getting up to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ he is the only one of the only one paradise and it's a life of a man appeared he projected it you you will live the same my opinion was a certain type you took the bit from one man and changed the book but one man introvert he'd actually be that person in a pure spirit that's in you is reckon dead and you are invited with the life that was in crisis up on you Romans 8:11 said yes the spirit that raised Christ from the dead told you it'll also quicken your mortal bodies that's pain life then pain power st. beneficiary then he had your own earth from God pierre ET you seen that was born or the guy whose name the problems look alike before the foundation of the world that's why does a resurrection of Confirmation other words how do we know he was a crisis because he proves what he talked about god rouge white palace and he talked about that is the identification we're a beneficiary in the resurrection he proves what he talked about what he promised to do it christ he proved all the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of old is he proved what he promised in the days if he not he proved it in all the days of it he proved it I'm just saying he proves what he said because they are a part of that see that was represented hold the book of life but he came to redeem toxicology Oh message by Easter morning are only here race but his beneficiary he's with you he they were in crime Eddie's crucifixion they were any met his resurrection we are this beneficiary quick and after being dead in darkness the darkened world of unbelief or churches and denominations and so forth have brought us out and there's something in is calling him we want God we're a hundred and thirty-four dog we join a Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian was still there was something wrong we just couldn't find it yet and all other sudden while we was groping in darkness the great reservation came to us in the manifestation of the promised Word of God like he was a manifestation all the promise will of God I will not be be soul in Hell neither one of my only one to see corruption he manifested it every word of God that was promised to him he proved it money raised on the easterly them or what scoping in darkness and wandering around a vicious war speed on this day if they should keep a certain later do a certain set of rules all those things passed away well that was a glorious resurrection that the forever man ever man made reason there had never been to that time a man that could lay his eyes down and pick it up again he defied that scientific proof ahead by raising again once they say that Jesus Christ if it's a yes you did have forever that is power if it's the same that is cos points of the same one to five or ten to the same denominator Creed anymore but his holy daddy promised prove the truth he is alive we are the benefactors of his resurrection quicken after being paid in the world and standard trespasses he is quickened us together with ease raised with you now sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus this brand is spirit brains hearsay life again all in the earth if the Spirit of God that raised up Christ the body the anointed Pilate if the Spirit of God anointed that body in such a way then when that seed fell into the earth you just wanna let him rest there Nora he quickened raising up that same spirit by the same works by the same power by the same thoughts being you he'll also raise you up I like to real inscription here for you I like for you turn to the scripture I got wrote down here help you alone is found in the Book of Leviticus the 23rd chapter the 9th to the 11th first this enclosed in the law Levitical law God speaking to Moses listen all these things are types now and we'll stop here for a few moments the good answer
