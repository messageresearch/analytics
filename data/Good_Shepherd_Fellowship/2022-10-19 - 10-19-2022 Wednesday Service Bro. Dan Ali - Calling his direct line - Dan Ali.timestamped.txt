[44:26] on Monday
[44:28] and he told me he'll be in town this
[44:31] afternoon
[44:32] and uh he'll be in in a very good time
[44:35] to take the service
[44:37] and I woke up this morning and I saw a
[44:39] text
[44:42] saying that there is a flight delay and
[44:45] I should prepare for the service tonight
[44:48] and God was so good I got to work
[44:51] and I no wonder some of the people say I
[44:53] get away with everything
[44:56] I was sitting at the computer so busy
[44:59] I know if they should set a trap for me
[45:01] it's very easy to get me
[45:04] I was just sitting down just typing and
[45:06] then just uh what have you and my
[45:08] manager Works in with some papers I said
[45:11] I guess you want to see me oh no not you
[45:14] has your pastor come because I told him
[45:16] a pastor has traveled
[45:17] has your personal come I said no he's
[45:20] not come yet um and he's asked me to
[45:22] prepare for tonight's service so I'm
[45:23] just so okay and then she was just
[45:25] standing and looking at what I was doing
[45:27] and I had been there for probably over
[45:28] two hours and um it's not very common in
[45:32] that building first day to God but we
[45:34] thank God for his grace yes good to see
[45:36] every one of you
[45:38] yes
[45:39] um praise God
[45:41] we'll just thank God for everything you
[45:44] know last night
[45:49] um
[45:50] I wouldn't say last night because I went
[45:54] to bed
[45:55] uh probably a quarter to 12.
[45:59] so it was the early hours of this
[46:01] morning
[46:03] and I had a dream
[46:06] and before then when I dropped my wife
[46:08] off work for me sleeping at 11 30 is
[46:11] normal
[46:14] um
[46:14] after 12 is normal
[46:17] 18 after 12 is abnormal for me
[46:20] so because I dropped my wife off work by
[46:23] 10 and then I get home by 10 30 and I
[46:27] take time to pray before I go upstairs
[46:31] so I sleep anywhere between 11 30 and
[46:33] 12. and uh
[46:36] so my manager hears that she says so
[46:38] well done you are crazy yeah it looks it
[46:41] looks very much like it fresh beat
[46:43] together
[46:44] so when I got one when I was on my way
[46:46] home yesterday and I was driving
[46:48] in fact I felt the presence of God so
[46:51] much in the truck
[46:53] that I started cheering
[46:56] and in fact I just didn't know how I got
[46:59] home
[47:01] because I was so much consumed
[47:07] and I was just going I got home I just
[47:10] find time to pray as usual and I went up
[47:15] um and I went to bed probably close to
[47:18] 12.
[47:20] and I had a dream the early hours of
[47:22] this morning
[47:24] I was on the field
[47:26] I have been thinking and I believe it
[47:29] was brother Johnny
[47:32] I think it was brother Johnny
[47:38] we were on the field I don't remember
[47:40] what we were doing
[47:42] and then all of a sudden I looked in the
[47:44] skies
[47:45] and there was light
[47:48] very Shining
[47:50] like the star
[47:52] so I was looking at it then it started
[47:56] expanding expanding you know when you
[48:00] flash a Searchlight
[48:02] in the air you can see the race
[48:05] so there was a ray coming down from that
[48:09] light
[48:10] horizontally and I was looking at it and
[48:14] I said wow
[48:15] I wish this thing could come down and
[48:18] then it was coming down gradually
[48:19] gradually gradually and then it just
[48:22] came right where I was right from the
[48:25] heavens and it just came right where I
[48:28] was and stopped right there
[48:30] and it started Shining and immediately
[48:33] in the dream I started feeling hit
[48:38] and then he started penetrating my body
[48:40] it went through the marrows of my bone
[48:43] and it was so sharp that I just started
[48:47] the heat was so terrible and I just I
[48:50] was just lying down and I started
[48:53] praising God I said thank you Jesus
[48:55] praise be to God I was just praising God
[48:58] and crying in my dream
[49:00] and then I woke up
[49:02] no I didn't wake up one day that portion
[49:05] of the dream was over
[49:07] it took quite a while in the dream
[49:09] when that portion of the dream was over
[49:11] I was still lying down and I was just
[49:15] praising God
[49:16] just praising God just worshiping God
[49:19] and crying
[49:21] and then you know sometimes you get a
[49:23] dream and you wake up I just slept
[49:24] through
[49:25] until my alarm went off at 4 30. and I
[49:29] woke up
[49:30] and normally I'll just wake up get ready
[49:32] and go to work I woke up somebody said
[49:34] look at your phone I took my phone and I
[49:36] saw by the once message say get ready
[49:38] for service tonight in case I do not
[49:40] come I say okay so I replied him and
[49:42] said well every delay is according to
[49:45] God's plan so don't worry about coming
[49:47] in early we just want you back safe
[49:49] praise be to God so what I believe it
[49:54] was a Divine visitation
[49:56] nothing can take that away from me I
[49:59] have had several dreams probably that
[50:01] was the third or the fourth dream I have
[50:03] had seen light but this was different
[50:06] praise be to God
[50:09] something happened
[50:11] praise be to God whatever it was I do
[50:15] not know but something happened
[50:18] wonderful
[50:20] by the grace of God we have made Saints
[50:23] it is not to say we are going to make it
[50:26] we have made it by the grace of God
[50:30] by Grace we have made it
[50:36] you know one time I had a dream I shared
[50:38] that dream that morning we want to see
[50:41] snowman's Place were invited you know to
[50:44] go and get some coffee
[50:46] um by the way I've never forgotten of
[50:47] that coffee we'll have to talk about it
[50:49] sometime
[50:52] and I shared a dream there I had a dream
[50:56] somebody asked me
[51:00] why are you going to spend eternity
[51:04] it's an answer we all know I believe
[51:08] that you would answer it without even
[51:10] thinking about it
[51:12] and as soon as I open my mouth
[51:15] something took over
[51:18] my vocal cords
[51:21] something took over
[51:24] that it was no longer I
[51:27] that was in control over my voice
[51:30] and then the voice that took over said
[51:34] and then I was lying down I wanted to
[51:37] take over
[51:38] and let's say heaven but I couldn't
[51:42] something took over my voice then I was
[51:45] lying down in the dream I was saying
[51:48] that the place we all want to go starts
[51:51] with her
[51:56] and a place we don't want to go nobody
[51:58] wants to go we don't even want our
[51:59] enemies to go there also starts with her
[52:03] foreign
[52:09] and then I had heaven
[52:11] so even when I had heaven
[52:14] I had to catch myself then I rehearsed
[52:17] in the dream
[52:18] heaven before I started shouting I said
[52:21] praise God
[52:22] Heaven praise God
[52:25] so you know it is just by grace
[52:28] it is not our efforts it is not what but
[52:32] what we can do it is what God has done
[52:35] never trust in your abilities
[52:38] in the foolish works of God and God will
[52:41] never let you down praise be to God I
[52:44] have as I've said before and I'm going
[52:46] to say it again
[52:47] God did not deliver us
[52:50] from that life of Darkness
[52:52] only to leave us Midway no God forbid
[52:56] God delivered us from point A and he is
[52:59] bringing us to an expected end there is
[53:02] no doubt
[53:03] praise be to God we are Overcomers we
[53:08] have overcome in Christ Jesus the Bible
[53:11] says that we already seated in Heavenly
[53:13] places through Christ Jesus
[53:16] it doesn't matter one day could be the
[53:19] last
[53:20] it doesn't matter what happens
[53:22] when you have salvation it doesn't
[53:24] matter how you go
[53:26] yes it doesn't matter how you go praise
[53:29] be to God and I don't go to bed thinking
[53:31] how I go I don't care whether it is by
[53:34] air by sea by land I don't care what
[53:36] happens
[53:38] praise be to God
[53:42] just remember
[53:44] Who You Are
[53:46] praise be to God
[53:49] this morning oh my God I don't know what
[53:51] I'm doing here
[53:54] praise the Lord
[53:56] tonight
[53:58] there is a thought I want us to talk
[54:00] about
[54:01] and um if we may stand and open our
[54:04] Bibles to Psalm psalm 91.
[54:12] Psalm 91 7
[54:14] to 16. it looks like
[54:19] time is already
[54:22] trying to run away from me
[54:25] Psalm 91 7.
[54:38] I think just for the sake of time I may
[54:40] probably
[54:41] Jump Ahead
[54:43] uh you can read it when you get home
[54:46] uh let me just drop down
[54:49] to 11.
[54:51] for he shall give his angels charge over
[54:53] thee
[54:54] to keep thee in all thy ways
[54:57] they shall birdy up in their hands lest
[55:01] thou touch their foot against the stone
[55:04] Thou shalt tread upon the lion and other
[55:07] the Young Lion and the dragon shout out
[55:10] trample on their feet because he have
[55:12] set his love upon you are upon me
[55:16] therefore will I deliver him I will set
[55:21] him on high because he have known my
[55:25] name
[55:25] he shall call upon me
[55:28] and I will answer him praise be to God
[55:33] I will be with him in trouble
[55:36] I will deliver him and honor him with
[55:39] long life will I satisfy him and shoot
[55:43] him salvation praise be to God Isaiah 65
[55:50] Isaiah 65 24
[55:59] Isaiah 65 24
[56:06] . and it shall come to pass
[56:10] that before they call
[56:12] I will answer
[56:15] and while they are yet speaking
[56:18] I will hear
[56:20] amen praise be to God may the Lord add
[56:24] His blessings to the reading of his word
[56:25] shall we be seated
[56:32] I titled this message
[56:35] calling his direct line
[56:37] praise be to God
[56:39] calling his direct line
[56:45] God saved us
[56:49] because he wanted to have a relationship
[56:52] with us
[56:57] we know that being a father was one of
[57:00] his attributes
[57:02] and to be to be a father was to have
[57:05] children
[57:06] and not to have children and be running
[57:09] behind them down the valley and up the
[57:11] hill every day every with a whip no God
[57:14] wanted to have a relationship with his
[57:17] children
[57:18] so much so
[57:21] that the fall could not even stop it
[57:25] right amen
[57:29] godward was determined
[57:32] and even though there was a fall
[57:35] that did not stop God
[57:38] from having a relationship with his
[57:40] children
[57:43] God did not just create us
[57:50] just for us to be on our own
[57:52] God wants to be in our lives
[57:57] God is interested
[57:59] in your success
[58:02] even in your failure
[58:05] God is so interested
[58:08] he is interested in every detail of your
[58:11] life
[58:12] whether you raise or you fall whether
[58:15] you eat or not whether you are Sleepless
[58:17] not or not whether you are going to try
[58:19] us through trials or Temptations God is
[58:23] interested in that life
[58:27] and God wants to be a part
[58:32] God doesn't sit on the fence
[58:35] no only to look on
[58:37] while you are going through trials while
[58:40] you are going through troubles while you
[58:43] are just struggling in one world the
[58:44] other whatever it is that you may be
[58:46] going through praise the Lord
[58:56] now
[58:58] the fall
[59:00] could not stop God
[59:06] and that a lot of the times actually has
[59:09] become our problem
[59:12] that we can look at our lives
[59:16] and we can see where God took us from
[59:20] and we can actually put on paper
[59:23] almost every button we did
[59:26] all the places we have been
[59:29] all the life we have lived
[59:33] and then you tell somebody God has
[59:35] forgiven you I said and he has forgiving
[59:37] me everything yes
[59:39] God has forgiven you everything
[59:44] God never holds anything against you
[59:48] when you accept
[59:50] that sacrifice
[59:53] when you accept the Lord Jesus as your
[59:56] personal Lord and savior
[59:59] and your sins are confessed under the
[1:00:01] blood
[1:00:02] God does not hold anything against you
[1:00:07] and brother Abraham said
[1:00:12] that in God's eyes it was like you never
[1:00:15] did it to begin with
[1:00:17] that is how strong and how powerful the
[1:00:21] blood is
[1:00:24] it doesn't matter how dirty how filthy
[1:00:27] that life is that sin is one is being
[1:00:30] confessed and it drops in the blood
[1:00:33] it dissolves it
[1:00:36] it dissolves it
[1:00:38] that God looks in there and all he sees
[1:00:41] is the blood
[1:00:42] praise be to God
[1:00:44] does not see your wrongdoing because the
[1:00:47] blood has covered it
[1:00:49] there is enough Power in the Blood
[1:00:53] to cleanse any sin
[1:00:55] there is no sin that is too great
[1:00:59] ah to be
[1:01:01] to be dangerous to be forgiven
[1:01:05] praise be to God
[1:01:08] and why would God do it
[1:01:10] because God cannot Fellowship
[1:01:14] with sin
[1:01:15] and for God to have fellowship with his
[1:01:18] children
[1:01:19] he has made a provision
[1:01:22] so God can have fellowship with his
[1:01:26] children
[1:01:30] what what son
[1:01:32] or what daughter is it
[1:01:34] that does not want to have fellowship
[1:01:35] with the father
[1:01:40] I don't
[1:01:41] kept they do wrong
[1:01:44] your heart
[1:01:46] still goes after them yeah
[1:01:49] and I am talking about the natural Realm
[1:01:52] right
[1:01:54] hey think about God and his children
[1:02:00] we can talk about the Prodigal Son
[1:02:04] I believe he did he just didn't come to
[1:02:06] the father one time that you know what I
[1:02:09] just want to go somewhere give me my
[1:02:11] part of our inheritance
[1:02:13] um you are you are living too long I
[1:02:15] don't think you are going to die now
[1:02:17] just give me what belongs to me
[1:02:20] probably he was pastoring the Father Day
[1:02:22] in day out and the father said you know
[1:02:24] what Come Get It Go
[1:02:27] and when he left
[1:02:30] the father never stopped thinking about
[1:02:33] him
[1:02:34] he went I believe for every day his
[1:02:38] father was living the father was praying
[1:02:41] and looking in the direction that his
[1:02:43] son went
[1:02:44] hoping that one day he was going to
[1:02:47] return through that same path
[1:02:51] and he may have got to God praying
[1:02:54] let his boy hit a brick wall
[1:02:58] let him hit a brick wall so hard
[1:03:01] that he will think of coming back home
[1:03:04] let him blow off all the wealth
[1:03:07] probably he went and he this time he
[1:03:09] spent he was getting great gains
[1:03:12] by The Father's Heart
[1:03:13] was after him
[1:03:15] and the father was always
[1:03:18] and looking in
[1:03:21] hoping that one day he was going to
[1:03:24] retire
[1:03:25] you know the story
[1:03:27] no he came back and his father was
[1:03:30] already in the field waiting for him
[1:03:33] he was probably thinking how am I going
[1:03:36] to go back
[1:03:37] off he may have thought about it for
[1:03:40] days and weeks and months and he guided
[1:03:43] courage let me go anyhow I know I don't
[1:03:46] deserve to be a son anymore but probably
[1:03:48] he could take me in as as a servant that
[1:03:52] alone is okay
[1:03:54] and then he was probably thinking you
[1:03:56] know what I'm just going to get it in
[1:03:58] the night and I'm just going to hide you
[1:04:01] know see planning maybe planning his own
[1:04:03] way how to do things right
[1:04:06] little did he know
[1:04:08] that his father was having sleepless
[1:04:11] nights because of him
[1:04:13] and that he was on the field
[1:04:15] always looking for him waiting for his
[1:04:19] return
[1:04:20] praise be to God that he came
[1:04:24] he kissed a servant
[1:04:27] cows now the whole room for him as a
[1:04:30] servant he was always a son and he would
[1:04:34] always be a son
[1:04:36] praise be to God
[1:04:39] he was a son and he would always be
[1:04:43] now when a child of God
[1:04:46] when you stray from the path of
[1:04:48] righteousness
[1:04:50] look when you decide you want to go God
[1:04:53] will never stop you
[1:04:56] we are free moral agents
[1:04:59] you can choose what you do
[1:05:03] God would never stop you he will let go
[1:05:07] of you
[1:05:08] but because you are a child of God God
[1:05:11] will be waiting for you while you left
[1:05:13] off
[1:05:16] a child of God God will be waiting for
[1:05:19] you
[1:05:20] praise be to God
[1:05:30] Revelations 2 5.
[1:05:48] remember therefore from West
[1:05:51] Thou Art fallen and repent and do the
[1:05:54] first works or else I will come unto
[1:05:57] thee quickly and we remove that
[1:05:59] Candlestick out of his place except thou
[1:06:01] repent
[1:06:02] remember therefore from West Thou Art
[1:06:05] Fallen
[1:06:09] when you fall
[1:06:11] a child of God when a child of God Falls
[1:06:13] when a child of God stress on the path
[1:06:15] of righteousness
[1:06:17] God has not just come and condemn you
[1:06:19] and destroy you no
[1:06:22] a child of God God is waiting for you
[1:06:26] you can go and go and go and go
[1:06:32] with the foolishness of this world
[1:06:35] God is waiting for you while you left
[1:06:37] off
[1:06:44] to go forward
[1:06:47] repentance is not for the unbelievers
[1:06:51] repentance is for the children of God
[1:06:55] for the unbelievers what we call sin is
[1:06:59] a normal way of life
[1:07:02] but for a child of God when you do
[1:07:05] anything that is contrary to the word of
[1:07:07] God
[1:07:08] something in you tells you that you are
[1:07:11] not supposed to do this you know better
[1:07:13] or you should know better you are a
[1:07:15] child of God and you go back and you
[1:07:17] repent and they feel like oh it doesn't
[1:07:18] matter it doesn't matter it matters
[1:07:22] right
[1:07:24] I remember one time a guy at work was
[1:07:28] telling me there is no God he doesn't
[1:07:29] believe in God and I told him it's
[1:07:32] because of you God has brought me to
[1:07:33] this company
[1:07:35] praise be to God
[1:07:37] but after a while I saw that it was he
[1:07:40] was offended I believe
[1:07:44] so I went to him one I don't know what I
[1:07:47] think it was in the morning
[1:07:49] and I called him I said John
[1:07:51] you know you and I had this conversation
[1:07:53] he said yeah I've noticed that
[1:07:56] um I offended you
[1:07:58] uh and I'm sorry about it
[1:08:01] I said no no no no no I said I said are
[1:08:03] you sure I said well whichever way
[1:08:06] um you know
[1:08:09] a repentance is is good for the soul
[1:08:13] sometimes you will think that oh when I
[1:08:16] go and I and I tell the fellow I am
[1:08:19] sorry oh I tell the person oh I told a
[1:08:21] lie oh I tell the person how I I did
[1:08:24] this I stole this oh I'm sorry this is
[1:08:26] it I we think that that belittles you
[1:08:29] no
[1:08:30] it doesn't belittle you
[1:08:32] and if it does praise God
[1:08:40] a child of God
[1:08:42] it shouldn't be too difficult nothing
[1:08:45] should be too difficult for you to
[1:08:47] repent of
[1:08:51] if people want to laugh let them laugh
[1:08:53] at you
[1:08:55] if they want to write a book about you
[1:08:57] let them write it but make sure that
[1:09:01] your life with God Is Right
[1:09:06] make sure your life with God Is Right
[1:09:10] now when you are going to bed you are
[1:09:13] going to bed with the hope that if
[1:09:15] Christ comes tonight I am going by the
[1:09:17] grace of God that I'm not going to be
[1:09:19] left behind right
[1:09:24] we have a place to go Saints
[1:09:28] God would not condemn you
[1:09:32] for being a sinner
[1:09:35] but God would condemn you
[1:09:38] for choosing to remain a sinner
[1:09:42] after the provision
[1:09:45] has been made
[1:09:47] for your salvation if you turn it down
[1:09:51] what else do you have
[1:09:53] what else do you have
[1:09:55] if you take Christ down what else do you
[1:09:58] have
[1:10:00] if Christ doesn't mean anything to you
[1:10:03] what else is the value of life
[1:10:06] if there are other things in life that
[1:10:07] means a lot more to you than Christ why
[1:10:10] else
[1:10:12] my goodness
[1:10:13] God have mercy
[1:10:15] God have mercy
[1:10:18] what just look at your life
[1:10:21] you know yourself better than anybody
[1:10:24] knows you
[1:10:25] of course God knows you better than you
[1:10:27] know yourself
[1:10:28] look at your life
[1:10:30] and ask yourself
[1:10:34] where your heart is
[1:10:38] it's not about putting up
[1:10:41] think about just
[1:10:45] just salvation
[1:10:46] is an individual affair
[1:10:49] ask yourself
[1:10:51] ask yourself
[1:10:53] look at yourself in the mirror of the
[1:10:56] word of God ask yourself
[1:10:59] that the life you are living if Christ
[1:11:01] should come tonight where do you stand
[1:11:06] why do you stand
[1:11:10] what matters to you the most
[1:11:13] why your treasure is
[1:11:15] there your heart will be
[1:11:18] let your mind stay on God
[1:11:22] school is good go to school
[1:11:28] work is good work
[1:11:32] if you don't work don't eat
[1:11:35] praise the Lord
[1:11:36] but do not let work take all your time
[1:11:40] that you don't even have time for God
[1:11:45] praise be to God
[1:11:51] money is good
[1:11:54] at the end of the day it's just a piece
[1:11:56] of paper
[1:11:57] right man that doesn't just mean
[1:11:59] anything
[1:12:01] what are we carrying it to it's just to
[1:12:04] make life a little comfortable while we
[1:12:05] are here right
[1:12:07] we don't need money to go to heaven
[1:12:10] if God gives it to you praise God if he
[1:12:12] doesn't praise God
[1:12:18] the Bible says
[1:12:21] that this is therefore the condemnation
[1:12:24] that light
[1:12:26] has come into the world
[1:12:28] and man loved Darkness
[1:12:32] because
[1:12:33] the ideas were evil
[1:12:38] that after the light
[1:12:42] is shown
[1:12:44] after the sacrifice has been made
[1:12:49] and then you still are comfortable
[1:12:51] living in sin you still are comfortable
[1:12:54] living the old way life you still are
[1:12:57] comfortable doing things you know a
[1:12:59] child of God should not do go into place
[1:13:01] you know a child where God should not go
[1:13:02] just I mean then there is trouble
[1:13:06] then there is trouble
[1:13:13] we are talking about calling his direct
[1:13:16] line
[1:13:18] calling his direct line
[1:13:26] so God made man
[1:13:28] to worship
[1:13:31] God made us to worship
[1:13:34] so when you are not worshiping God
[1:13:39] void there
[1:13:42] gets occupied with something else you
[1:13:45] worship something
[1:13:47] because that is what you are made for
[1:13:49] make sure
[1:13:51] that God is occupying
[1:13:54] in that void why again because God wants
[1:13:57] to have a relationship
[1:13:59] with his children
[1:14:03] praise be to God
[1:14:05] you can have children
[1:14:07] and the children grow
[1:14:11] you know they are just very very
[1:14:13] interesting when they are small and when
[1:14:15] they got to 18 some of them cannot even
[1:14:17] wait till they are 18 and they want to
[1:14:19] leave the house
[1:14:21] praise the Lord when they are small you
[1:14:23] are just running around and then I
[1:14:25] remember it was just Joshua alone who
[1:14:27] escaped by Dani Emmanuel and gospel we
[1:14:31] used to be on the bed just rolling and
[1:14:32] biting their chicks and they were
[1:14:35] showing me that the mother would run in
[1:14:36] when I do it to my son I say we are
[1:14:38] playing
[1:14:39] thank you
[1:14:44] yeah we are playing
[1:14:47] and they are so nice and then they'll
[1:14:50] grow and then they want to run away but
[1:14:52] even when they grow
[1:14:56] even when they grow
[1:14:58] and they get married they leave the
[1:14:59] house
[1:15:00] still
[1:15:01] you still want to have a relationship
[1:15:03] with them in one way or the other they
[1:15:05] are still keeping contact
[1:15:07] either through social media are through
[1:15:10] letters through um phone calls they are
[1:15:14] still keeping their relationship alive
[1:15:19] they are still keeping the relationship
[1:15:22] yeah
[1:15:23] I watch a documentary
[1:15:26] of a mother
[1:15:30] whose daughter
[1:15:31] I believe she was the only Dora no she
[1:15:34] was not the only daughter I think that
[1:15:36] she had a lot of dollars yes not a lot
[1:15:38] of children but out of those children it
[1:15:41] was that girl that lady
[1:15:43] forever every single day
[1:15:46] at a particular time
[1:15:49] she will call her mother
[1:15:52] every single day
[1:15:55] when that time is reaching
[1:15:57] she's getting to her phone
[1:15:59] so much so that when that time was
[1:16:02] reaching her mother whatever she was
[1:16:06] doing she would leave it
[1:16:08] and they'll go sit by the phone
[1:16:10] because she knew
[1:16:12] that there was a call coming
[1:16:15] and it never failed
[1:16:18] for years
[1:16:19] until one day
[1:16:22] she got up and sat by the phone
[1:16:25] and the car never came
[1:16:27] she wanted the call never came she
[1:16:29] wanted it wasn't coming
[1:16:31] she said no
[1:16:32] there must be something
[1:16:34] and she took the phone
[1:16:37] no there was no response called no
[1:16:40] response then she called the police and
[1:16:43] said she thinks there was something
[1:16:44] wrong and indeed when they went there
[1:16:46] there was something wrong
[1:16:54] they so much had a relationship
[1:16:57] that at a particular time in the day
[1:17:01] daughter was just daughter couldn't wait
[1:17:04] to talk to Mommy
[1:17:05] couldn't wait to hear from Dora and that
[1:17:09] is the type of relationship God wants to
[1:17:11] have with his children
[1:17:13] that when that time is coming that time
[1:17:16] you have set for you and God when that
[1:17:18] time is coming God cannot wait because
[1:17:21] he knows his daughter is going to call
[1:17:23] he knows his son is going to call and he
[1:17:26] is sitting down and waiting for that
[1:17:28] call
[1:17:31] unlike the mother
[1:17:33] who couldn't see what was going to
[1:17:35] happen
[1:17:36] until it happened
[1:17:38] we are serving a living God
[1:17:41] who knows the end from the beginning and
[1:17:43] he knows every move of the devil that
[1:17:46] whatever move the Devil Makes he knows
[1:17:48] about it and the Bible says that when
[1:17:50] the enemy comes against us like a flood
[1:17:52] the spirit of God will lift up a
[1:17:55] standard against him any move the Devil
[1:17:58] Makes
[1:17:59] God makes a move
[1:18:03] our lives are protected
[1:18:07] there is we are protected
[1:18:10] praise be to God
[1:18:12] I mean you look at your life
[1:18:14] look at my life my life is just a
[1:18:17] mystery

[1:18:29] I'm not supposed to be living
[1:18:33] right but here I am
[1:18:34] and the devil cannot do anything about
[1:18:36] it
[1:18:38] he doesn't have to like it
[1:18:40] praise be to God
[1:18:43] we are going to live
[1:18:45] to declare the glory of the Lord
[1:18:48] we are going to live to serve the
[1:18:50] purpose of God in our lives we are going
[1:18:53] to do the will of God before we come to
[1:18:55] the end of our road we are going to live

[1:24:00] every child of God
[1:24:03] has a direct access
[1:24:05] to the throne of God
[1:24:08] on Calvary on that day when the blood of
[1:24:11] the Lord Jesus was shared
[1:24:14] and the Earth shook
[1:24:17] and they write the Rocks rent the Bible
[1:24:20] says
[1:24:21] in Matthew 27 51
[1:24:24] that the veil that was before the temple
[1:24:27] read from top to bottom right
[1:24:30] to give access
[1:24:35] to the throne of God
[1:24:38] this was a Preserve of the high priest
[1:24:44] that for him to even go there he had to
[1:24:47] follow some protocols right
[1:24:50] if he missed one he would go in but he
[1:24:53] will not come out
[1:24:55] but today you and I we can just go in
[1:24:59] anyhow
[1:25:00] and God will still open his arm of love
[1:25:03] so wide to embrace us as we come in
[1:25:07] praise be to God
[1:25:09] that it is no longer the high priest
[1:25:12] that just goes in
[1:25:14] to atone for you and me that we have
[1:25:18] direct access
[1:25:20] to the throne of God
[1:25:22] that we can walk in every time of day
[1:25:26] and we can just tread unto him and he
[1:25:29] hears us
[1:25:31] praise be to God
[1:25:35] Matthew 27 51 you can read that later
[1:25:37] now in the message
[1:25:40] the Mighty God unveiled
[1:25:44] brother says when the veil was read at
[1:25:47] Calvary The Mercy Seat
[1:25:50] came in Plainview
[1:25:52] but what happened it was hanging on
[1:25:55] Calvary dripping in blood
[1:25:58] as they had took blood year after year
[1:26:02] at the cleansing of the sanctuary and
[1:26:05] the sprinkling of the messy seat there
[1:26:08] God with his Great Mighty stroke of
[1:26:13] lightning
[1:26:14] lightning power
[1:26:16] split
[1:26:18] the old budget Veil from top to bottom
[1:26:22] and the messy seat came in Plainview
[1:26:26] the real genuine Lamb of God was hanging
[1:26:30] in plain view on Calvary
[1:26:34] the real messy seat
[1:26:36] when God had paid the price himself and
[1:26:40] become one of us and had manifested
[1:26:43] himself as a man to get acquainted with
[1:26:46] us
[1:26:48] and we
[1:26:49] to be acquainted with him
[1:26:52] again
[1:26:54] relationship
[1:26:56] The Mercy Seat was in plain view
[1:27:00] of all Israel on that day
[1:27:03] of the atonement
[1:27:06] but alas the traditions of the church
[1:27:10] fathers in that day
[1:27:12] had their Traditions had their veiled
[1:27:16] not had veiled the true Mercy Seat from
[1:27:20] the people
[1:27:21] if they would have known the scripture
[1:27:25] each piece would have come like
[1:27:28] the Chinese tag
[1:27:30] the Old Testament prophecy would have
[1:27:33] been fulfilled
[1:27:34] and it was
[1:27:36] and if they had been taught the
[1:27:38] scripture they would have seen The Mercy
[1:27:41] Seat
[1:27:45] when the blood
[1:27:46] of the atonement
[1:27:49] touched the ground
[1:27:51] praise be to God
[1:27:54] it gave us an access
[1:27:57] unlimited access
[1:27:59] unlimited access
[1:28:02] praise be to God what excuse would you
[1:28:06] have for not saving God
[1:28:09] can you think of one
[1:28:11] can you think of one excuse
[1:28:14] that you have
[1:28:17] my goodness
[1:28:19] the other day I saw
[1:28:24] um somebody singing
[1:28:27] um he was born crippled from birth
[1:28:30] he has no legs
[1:28:34] and uh
[1:28:37] he was singing
[1:28:40] and then thanking God
[1:28:43] that God has given him legs
[1:28:47] and yeah this man has no legs
[1:28:51] and he was happy
[1:28:53] he was very happy with what he has
[1:28:57] the Bible says
[1:29:05] godliness with contentment
[1:29:08] is a great game
[1:29:11] do not covet
[1:29:15] be happy Who You Are
[1:29:18] be happy with what God has given you
[1:29:21] be satisfied with it
[1:29:23] right
[1:29:25] and I looked at him singing with her
[1:29:28] shoes on
[1:29:29] because he doesn't even have the leg for
[1:29:31] shoes
[1:29:33] and he was so happy
[1:29:36] praising God that God has given him legs
[1:29:39] I looked at it and it broke my heart
[1:29:44] yes
[1:29:46] Lord have mercy
[1:29:49] what excuse
[1:29:52] what excuse
[1:29:54] one one excuse if I ask for two
[1:29:58] I may give you headache
[1:30:01] yes I'm asking for only one can you can
[1:30:04] you can you think of one excuse
[1:30:06] one one excuse
[1:30:09] you would have for not serving God
[1:30:12] that on that day
[1:30:14] God will ask you
[1:30:16] what did you do with my word
[1:30:18] and you you have one excuse that you
[1:30:20] give God
[1:30:22] that this was the reason and God was so
[1:30:24] well done my son come in well done my
[1:30:27] daughter coming can you have one
[1:30:36] in whatever situation you find yourself
[1:30:38] in
[1:30:40] no
[1:30:42] that as a child of God
[1:30:45] that God is satisfied with your life
[1:30:51] if his wealth God can give you wealth in
[1:30:53] abundance
[1:30:58] you can live your whole life and never
[1:30:59] get headache
[1:31:02] you can just touch anything to be I mean
[1:31:05] God will just open but but but you know
[1:31:10] the Bible says Jesus suffered
[1:31:13] he led obedience from the test he
[1:31:16] suffered
[1:31:20] I'm a father I have children
[1:31:24] those who will not come to me
[1:31:26] and say Daddy
[1:31:27] I want a butcher's knife
[1:31:30] and I'll just get up and say this is one
[1:31:31] it's very very short take it
[1:31:34] I know
[1:31:38] there are a lot of things we ask for and
[1:31:40] sometimes it is for is to our own
[1:31:43] destruction
[1:31:46] but we do not have the first side we
[1:31:48] don't have the eyes to see
[1:31:49] and we are so bent upon it
[1:31:52] there was a man in Ghana
[1:31:56] not bought a car
[1:31:58] it's also the brand new car it was a
[1:32:00] used car
[1:32:02] and that's that Christmas that's that
[1:32:05] the year that same year in that
[1:32:07] Christmas before the Christmas he took
[1:32:09] his wife and children in that car
[1:32:12] and that was the last
[1:32:15] they had an accident and all of them
[1:32:17] died
[1:32:19] then you wonder
[1:32:20] was it a blessing
[1:32:23] there are a lot of things we ask for
[1:32:26] we do not know what we are asking for
[1:32:29] if God gives it to you praise God
[1:32:32] if God doesn't give it to you praise God
[1:32:37] your salvation
[1:32:39] is the most important thing nothing else
[1:32:41] matters right
[1:32:44] your salvation is the most important
[1:32:47] thing
[1:32:49] your salvation is the most important
[1:32:52] thing what God is doing in your life
[1:32:55] that is the most important thing not
[1:32:57] what you are doing what you are doing
[1:33:00] as Solomon said is buried you upon
[1:33:03] vanity not just vanity but vanity upon
[1:33:06] vanity yeah vanity times vanity
[1:33:12] yes
[1:33:14] we have mathematicians in the house
[1:33:16] praise God
[1:33:19] that is how useless life is without God
[1:33:24] praise the Lord
[1:33:27] I didn't know how we got there
[1:33:32] so God has a direct line
[1:33:36] and the right line brings you into
[1:33:38] direct contact
[1:33:40] with god without an intermediary
[1:33:45] you don't have to go through somebody
[1:33:47] and no
[1:33:49] if I have a challenge
[1:33:52] and I'm praying and I'm trusting God for
[1:33:55] something yeah
[1:33:56] I can tell you brother help me in prayer
[1:33:59] I can tell you sister help me in prayer
[1:34:01] I can bring you to the church church
[1:34:03] help me in prayer there is nothing wrong
[1:34:05] with that
[1:34:08] praise be to God
[1:34:11] there is nothing wrong with
[1:34:16] it but we are not going through anybody
[1:34:21] we are not going through anybody
[1:34:25] you can come before God talk to God and
[1:34:29] God will hear you the same way he will
[1:34:33] hear the other person
[1:34:34] right
[1:34:38] God has no grandchildren
[1:34:41] we are all children of God
[1:34:44] if God can hear you God can hear me
[1:34:48] if God can hear me God can hear you
[1:34:51] yes
[1:34:53] we are not going through anybody
[1:34:57] you ought to have a personal
[1:34:59] relationship with God
[1:35:02] you ought to
[1:35:04] no two ways about that
[1:35:08] you have an Express attention
[1:35:11] from God
[1:35:13] the angel of the Lord Daniel 10 12. you
[1:35:17] can read that when you get home
[1:35:20] poor Daniel
[1:35:21] not from the first day from the very
[1:35:24] first day
[1:35:26] he set his face to seek the face of God
[1:35:30] answered his prayer
[1:35:33] by the praise of the kingdom of Persia
[1:35:36] we stood him
[1:35:38] and Daniel didn't stop praying
[1:35:41] no
[1:35:42] that is the how good it is
[1:35:47] when you know
[1:35:49] pick God hears you
[1:35:53] that you have no doubt
[1:35:55] no second thought
[1:35:58] you speak that you know God hears you
[1:36:01] so even when the result is not coming
[1:36:03] you know that is for a good cause
[1:36:06] praise be together
[1:36:09] you can read that way I know we all know
[1:36:11] the story
[1:36:14] from the very first day
[1:36:18] we are not going through any
[1:36:19] intermediary
[1:36:25] sometimes God will test your patience in
[1:36:27] a lot of ways
[1:36:29] praise be to God
[1:36:34] now
[1:36:38] faith
[1:36:40] is the Bedrock
[1:36:47] we are not talking of abstract faith
[1:36:51] faith that is just hanging in the
[1:36:53] balance
[1:36:56] no
[1:36:58] our faith
[1:37:00] must be anchored
[1:37:02] in the world
[1:37:05] for Faith coming by hearing and hearing
[1:37:08] by the word of God
[1:37:12] the word of God is the foundation of our
[1:37:16] faith
[1:37:19] Miracles are good
[1:37:21] signs and mothers are good we love them
[1:37:25] brother said they would increase your
[1:37:27] faith but they don't give you Faith No
[1:37:30] what gives you faith
[1:37:32] is the word
[1:37:34] how you ought to entertain the world how
[1:37:38] you ought to live by the world how you
[1:37:41] ought to let the word of God become your
[1:37:43] absolute that you take it and you just
[1:37:46] enjoy it whether you are reading on the
[1:37:49] computer on your phone you are having
[1:37:51] your Bible you just you know sometimes
[1:37:53] you laugh and people look at you they
[1:37:55] think you are crazy
[1:37:57] you know I mean I just oh my goodness
[1:38:01] we are seven our our heavenly father is
[1:38:05] so good
[1:38:07] I look at me
[1:38:10] and I ask myself
[1:38:14] oh the trouble have been through why
[1:38:17] would God so love me so much
[1:38:21] brother Derek I have not forgotten your
[1:38:23] request
[1:38:25] I spoke with brother one one time and I
[1:38:27] was telling him brother Derek asked for
[1:38:30] you know some of the dreams I've been
[1:38:33] having a lot of dreams God has a way of
[1:38:36] dealing with every one of us
[1:38:38] God deals with me through dreams a lot
[1:38:42] the first dream I had was in
[1:38:46] um
[1:38:47] was not I I think it's 1988 1989
[1:38:51] to be on the same ground
[1:38:53] 98 1989
[1:38:57] and from that time this year alone I've
[1:39:00] had three spiritual dreams including
[1:39:04] what I just shared with you
[1:39:06] tonight three
[1:39:08] okay and uh I don't write anything down
[1:39:12] but by the grace of God everything is
[1:39:14] here
[1:39:15] I don't go to bed praying that I want to
[1:39:18] drink
[1:39:19] no I don't know I'm going to drink no
[1:39:24] it just comes
[1:39:26] and I try reading something about dreams
[1:39:28] from the prophet and he said it's just
[1:39:31] the way God has wired you
[1:39:34] we are wired differently
[1:39:36] very good so I have not for watching
[1:39:39] that request I was telling me the one I
[1:39:40] want to find a day
[1:39:42] it doesn't matter whatever I direct is
[1:39:45] here or not or just come and encourage
[1:39:47] ourselves with all those dreams and um
[1:39:50] and I'll let you know
[1:39:54] praise the Lord
[1:39:56] yes
[1:40:01] oh my
[1:40:02] so
[1:40:06] faith is the word I mean of the word
[1:40:08] cause is attention
[1:40:11] it brings Fellowship between God and man
[1:40:14] the area code
[1:40:16] because
[1:40:18] if you're making a call there is an area
[1:40:21] code
[1:40:22] before the number
[1:40:24] and the area code
[1:40:29] I have here
[1:40:31] just for the purpose of this meeting
[1:40:35] the area code
[1:40:38] is faith
[1:40:42] faith that is uncaught in the word of
[1:40:45] God
[1:40:45] that is the area code
[1:40:48] because First Carry by hearing and
[1:40:50] hearing by the word of God
[1:40:51] faith has a resting place and that is
[1:40:55] the word
[1:40:56] it is not your emotional appeal to God
[1:41:00] it is not the jumping and the shouting
[1:41:02] and the screaming and the rolling no
[1:41:06] it's
[1:41:07] in the life
[1:41:10] right
[1:41:11] because without faith the Bible says no
[1:41:16] man can please God
[1:41:19] if you don't have the right
[1:41:22] code
[1:41:23] you can dial the number a thousand times
[1:41:26] and it will not go through
[1:41:29] right
[1:41:34] right and I have here again
[1:41:37] just for the purpose of this meeting
[1:41:41] the number is prayer
[1:41:45] prayer does not hang in a balance
[1:41:49] neither faith
[1:41:51] the area code alone does not make a
[1:41:55] phone call
[1:41:57] neither the number without the code
[1:42:01] yes
[1:42:03] as an area code
[1:42:06] and a number move together
[1:42:09] prayer and faith move together
[1:42:17] you need the area code
[1:42:19] and a number to be able to make a call
[1:42:22] yes
[1:42:24] you can just make a call with a without
[1:42:28] a code no
[1:42:30] buff
[1:42:31] they need one another
[1:42:34] and for you to be able to call the
[1:42:36] throne room of God
[1:42:38] you need that area code and the number
[1:42:42] Faith does not hang in a balance you
[1:42:45] need faith
[1:42:47] and
[1:42:48] prayer
[1:42:54] and I think
[1:42:56] I have a scripture here
[1:43:00] James 5 6.
[1:43:02] that says that the effectual
[1:43:05] fervent prayer of the righteous much
[1:43:14] your faith would produce a life
[1:43:18] because the Bible says faith without
[1:43:20] words is dead
[1:43:23] by the life you live people would know
[1:43:26] what you have believed
[1:43:27] right and where you stand yeah so Faith
[1:43:30] must produce whites
[1:43:34] faith without works
[1:43:36] the Bible says is dead there are times
[1:43:41] you call a number without an area code
[1:43:47] like calling a number that has the same
[1:43:50] area code
[1:43:53] with your number
[1:43:55] like our seven safety number 5763 number
[1:43:59] if I want to call my wife
[1:44:02] I don't have to dial a 763 that is the
[1:44:04] area code I just go in straight and I'm
[1:44:07] talking to her
[1:44:08] that is what I mean here
[1:44:10] I don't need faith
[1:44:12] to talk to you
[1:44:18] to talk to you
[1:44:20] praise the Lord
[1:44:22] because we are in the same area code on
[1:44:25] Earth
[1:44:27] we're in the same code
[1:44:30] better talk to God you need faith
[1:44:34] you need that area code
[1:44:38] you are on earth and he is in heaven
[1:44:41] yeah a completely different Realm
[1:44:47] but if there are different Realms you
[1:44:49] must prefix it with an area code
[1:44:53] and a prayer is calling
[1:44:56] in a different dimension
[1:45:00] brother Brandon said prayer is divine
[1:45:03] you are talking to God is divine you are
[1:45:08] making a call to a different
[1:45:12] realm and you need that code right you
[1:45:16] need that area code you need faith for
[1:45:19] without faith you can never receive
[1:45:21] anything from God
[1:45:25] that is how important
[1:45:28] faith is
[1:45:32] to them that belief
[1:45:34] the Bible says all things are possible
[1:45:38] prayer is your number
[1:45:42] faith is your area code
[1:45:47] you need a two together
[1:45:50] to be able to get to the throne room of
[1:45:53] God
[1:45:55] if I was asked
[1:45:59] in an exam
[1:46:01] who the father of Faith was I was
[1:46:04] probably going to mention
[1:46:06] Elijah
[1:46:09] or
[1:46:12] Joshua
[1:46:15] because this was a man that stopped the
[1:46:17] Sun from moving
[1:46:20] Elijah stopped the rain
[1:46:22] there was no even due
[1:46:25] for a special three and a half years
[1:46:28] but when it comes to the father of faith
[1:46:31] the Bible says
[1:46:33] it's Abram
[1:46:37] so
[1:46:38] faith
[1:46:40] is not
[1:46:43] getting an instant result
[1:46:45] When you pray right
[1:46:48] Abraham did not get an instant result
[1:46:52] but yet he is the father of faith
[1:46:56] right so when you pray have patience
[1:46:59] with God
[1:47:01] When you pray believe that God has
[1:47:05] answered your prayer but have patience
[1:47:07] with God
[1:47:11] it doesn't have to be instantaneous
[1:47:15] the man has Faith he does
[1:47:19] he just happens right if it doesn't
[1:47:22] happen it doesn't mean there is no faith
[1:47:25] as a matter of fact it takes a lot more
[1:47:29] faith to wait
[1:47:32] that to get it immediately
[1:47:36] it takes a lot more faith than when you
[1:47:38] have prayed and you have not seen the
[1:47:41] result and you believe you have seen it
[1:47:44] right
[1:47:46] and evidence of things hoped for
[1:47:49] a substance of his hopeful the evidence
[1:47:52] of Things Not Seen
[1:47:55] you haven't seen it
[1:47:58] you have prayed you haven't seen it but
[1:48:01] you believe is that
[1:48:03] oh man
[1:48:06] yeah probably you are still working with
[1:48:08] the same problem and people are looking
[1:48:10] at you and they're laughing at you and
[1:48:12] he said I am healed but they say nobody
[1:48:14] look at you you are saying the same
[1:48:16] person let's have a sin I am healed
[1:48:19] it takes place
[1:48:27] with God
[1:48:32] it doesn't have to be on the moment if
[1:48:35] it happens that is good
[1:48:38] but we need faith learn to trust in God
[1:48:42] praise be to God
[1:48:45] when you have the area code
[1:48:58] we saw we can talk about a few people
[1:49:01] in the scriptures
[1:49:04] how Jonah
[1:49:06] in the belly of the whale
[1:49:10] dialed goes direct line
[1:49:17] I am here on Earth
[1:49:20] if you take me right now if you ask me
[1:49:22] where East West North is I can try
[1:49:27] but if you just pin me around 10 times
[1:49:29] and I get dizzy
[1:49:30] and you ask me what is East
[1:49:33] I bet you
[1:49:36] I may try for answers
[1:49:39] because I know north east south west
[1:49:41] therefore
[1:49:42] right
[1:49:45] if the face is not right the second will
[1:49:47] be right
[1:49:49] if my second is not right I'll get it
[1:49:51] the third time
[1:49:54] if I don't get it the title I saw the
[1:49:55] fourth I'll never miss
[1:50:03] but can you imagine a man
[1:50:07] in the belly of the whale
[1:50:10] and he remembered
[1:50:13] that wherever you find yourself
[1:50:17] if you can just turn and face the temple
[1:50:21] and you cry out to God God will hear you
[1:50:24] what does that what does that he was not
[1:50:28] just in the he was not just in the sea
[1:50:30] he was in the belly of the whale in the
[1:50:33] sea
[1:50:34] my goodness and the Bible says by faith
[1:50:38] praise God the Bible does not play with
[1:50:41] words the Bible says by faith he turned
[1:50:47] my goodness
[1:50:49] it doesn't matter whether he was facing
[1:50:52] west
[1:50:52] it doesn't matter whether he was Facing
[1:50:55] East and the temple was North that
[1:50:58] didn't matter to him he said this is why
[1:51:00] you are Temple
[1:51:02] and he prayed
[1:51:06] and he prayed and God spoke to the will
[1:51:10] to carry him on land
[1:51:15] goes the red line
[1:51:17] calling his direct line
[1:51:20] you can talk about Elijah
[1:51:25] a liar did not even pray
[1:51:28] as I was saying that when you are on the
[1:51:32] same
[1:51:33] area code if you have the same area code
[1:51:38] with somebody
[1:51:40] you can dial their number using the area
[1:51:43] code that is fine right
[1:51:46] so a child of God nothing stops you from
[1:51:49] prayer
[1:51:52] and if you have the same area code with
[1:51:55] them you can dial that number
[1:51:57] without the area code and the number is
[1:52:00] going to go through
[1:52:01] I think I have something here I may have
[1:52:04] gone ahead of myself by a paragraph
[1:52:06] we'll be closing very soon bear with me
[1:52:09] praise the Lord
[1:52:12] now
[1:52:21] I don't know if I have jumped it
[1:52:23] somewhere
[1:52:26] um when you have an area code with this
[1:52:28] with someone okay you don't need to call
[1:52:30] the area code um so
[1:52:34] when you are in the same area code with
[1:52:38] God
[1:52:40] sometimes you just speak
[1:52:44] I have John 15 5 to 7. let's see what is
[1:52:48] there
[1:52:49] John 15
[1:52:51] John 15
[1:53:03] John
[1:53:05] 15
[1:53:10] five to seven all right so I read
[1:53:15] I am the Vine
[1:53:17] here are the branches he that abideth in
[1:53:20] me and I in him the same bringer for my
[1:53:24] fruit for without me you can do nothing
[1:53:27] if a man abide not in me he is cast off
[1:53:31] as a branch and it's with it and man
[1:53:35] gathered them and cut them into the fire
[1:53:37] and they are bent if ye abide in me
[1:53:42] and my words abide in you
[1:53:45] you ask what you will
[1:53:49] and it shall be done unto you praise be
[1:53:53] to God
[1:53:54] when ye abide in me and I in you
[1:53:57] praise be to God that it is no longer
[1:54:00] you it's Christ in you you are in the
[1:54:04] same area code with God you can pray all
[1:54:07] right and a gust moment in your life
[1:54:09] where you just speak
[1:54:11] right
[1:54:13] something happens you just speak
[1:54:17] and you see this happen before your very
[1:54:20] eyes
[1:54:22] I remember in Tema in Ghana Ghana Tema
[1:54:24] the city the Port City
[1:54:27] a man went into a little girl to take
[1:54:30] advantage of her
[1:54:31] in her absence of her parents
[1:54:33] and this girl
[1:54:35] when she turned and saw this man closing
[1:54:38] the door behind her she said she she
[1:54:40] just shouted in the name of Jesus I
[1:54:43] struggled with blindness
[1:54:45] and the man just screamed and turned and
[1:54:48] was looking for the doorknob to get out
[1:54:51] of the door
[1:54:53] he got blind right there and then
[1:54:56] hey just a point in your life there is
[1:54:59] no time to pray
[1:55:00] you just speak
[1:55:03] and you see God move on the scene
[1:55:07] praise the Lord
[1:55:09] we saw that in the life of Moses
[1:55:12] when the children of God were delivered
[1:55:14] and they got to the Red Sea and they saw
[1:55:16] the Egyptians coming and he'll look at
[1:55:19] them and he just spoke
[1:55:21] these Egyptians you see you shall see
[1:55:24] them no more
[1:55:25] he had already passed judgment on them
[1:55:27] and God withheld it
[1:55:31] God withheld it yeah and all of them
[1:55:35] perished
[1:55:36] none of them survived they all perished
[1:55:40] Elijah he said according to my word
[1:55:43] there is not going to be rain no deal
[1:55:46] until I call for it
[1:55:49] praise be to God Amen we are children of
[1:55:52] God with authority
[1:55:54] never underestimate what God can do with
[1:55:56] you
[1:55:59] praise be to God
[1:56:01] Heaven is counting on us
[1:56:07] we are children of God
[1:56:10] praise be to God
[1:56:12] Heaven is counting on us
[1:56:14] Heaven is counting on you
[1:56:16] don't say I am small
[1:56:18] no
[1:56:21] it's the small one God wants
[1:56:24] because if your big God cannot use him
[1:56:29] don't say you're small
[1:56:34] praise the Lord
[1:56:44] now
[1:56:45] the musicians can come over
[1:56:55] calling his direct line
[1:57:00] God has his direct line
[1:57:06] and that direct line is not given to
[1:57:09] anybody everybody
[1:57:12] that direct line
[1:57:14] is given to people
[1:57:16] that are in his inner circles
[1:57:23] not to anybody
[1:57:26] not with just anybody
[1:57:32] and we all have that direct line
[1:57:42] God has given that direct line to that
[1:57:45] special group of people and we are those
[1:57:48] special people
[1:57:53] it has nothing to do with you
[1:57:58] you are special because God has made you
[1:58:01] special
[1:58:05] just keep feeding on the word
[1:58:09] keep living by the word
[1:58:11] keep entertaining the world
[1:58:15] just live the life
[1:58:20] you must be special
[1:58:23] to have the word of God entrusted in
[1:58:26] your career
[1:58:30] if God knows you're going to be Reckless
[1:58:32] with his word he will not give his word
[1:58:34] to you
[1:58:35] God has given you his word because he
[1:58:38] knows that you are going to treasure it
[1:58:43] the word of God is a treasure
[1:58:45] to ourselves
[1:58:48] and we love God
[1:58:50] son daughter of God you must love the
[1:58:53] word you must cherish the word
[1:58:55] [Music]
[1:58:57] you must love to read the word
[1:59:01] call it his direct line
[1:59:04] how does it feel
[1:59:07] when you know
[1:59:10] that someone is on the other side
[1:59:13] just waiting to hear your call
[1:59:18] waiting to hear your voice
[1:59:20] [Music]
[1:59:22] that before you even call
[1:59:25] he is there waiting for it that before
[1:59:28] you even speak
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:32] he's already answered
[1:59:36] how how do you feel
[1:59:39] that you are going Before the Throne of
[1:59:42] the The Throne of God and you know
[1:59:47] that he would hear you
[1:59:50] not he may hear me no maybe no but you
[1:59:55] know that he's going to hear you
[1:59:59] how heartwarming is it
[2:00:04] what an assurance
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:07] praise be to God
[2:00:09] [Music]
[2:00:16] there can be many voices coming at the
[2:00:18] same time
[2:00:21] like brother Jordan was saying one time
[2:00:23] that he was in um
[2:00:25] uh customer service
[2:00:28] and he talks to some customers
[2:00:31] and he doesn't care how many people are
[2:00:32] there in that company
[2:00:34] but when somebody speaks
[2:00:37] he can tell who is speaking
[2:00:41] it doesn't matter if million people are
[2:00:44] calling at the same time
[2:00:46] that your voice is unique to God
[2:00:51] that when that voice comes through
[2:00:54] God can tell
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:00:57] this is my son this is my daughter
[2:01:01] I don't want to start mentioning names
[2:01:03] because we are not here tonight
[2:01:06] if I mention whenever I have to make
[2:01:08] sure I mention everybody's name before
[2:01:10] they say oh the brother left me out
[2:01:13] foreign
[2:01:15] is unique to God
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:20] that God is always waiting
[2:01:23] just waiting
[2:01:25] to hear from you
[2:01:28] he is waiting
[2:01:30] and when God is not hearing from you he
[2:01:33] is worried
[2:01:34] he knows what is going on in our life he
[2:01:37] knows it there is nothing that is hidden
[2:01:39] before you God wants to have a
[2:01:41] relationship with you on a daily basis
[2:01:43] not when things go wrong
[2:01:46] for some of us that is when we know
[2:01:49] to go to God when things are not going
[2:01:51] well then we know where to run to but
[2:01:54] when things are okay
[2:01:56] we hardly think about God
[2:02:02] how heartwarming is it
[2:02:04] to know
[2:02:07] that the father is just waiting to hear
[2:02:09] from you
[2:02:11] and the Bible says pray without cease
[2:02:17] prayer without Caesar
[2:02:20] foreign
[2:02:23] you feel like praying as a matter of
[2:02:25] fact
[2:02:26] there are times I've got before my knees
[2:02:30] and I hardly know what I'm going to say
[2:02:34] but it turns out to be the most wonder
[2:02:36] some of the most glorious times I've
[2:02:39] ever had before God
[2:02:40] did I just go
[2:02:42] and I don't even know why those words
[2:02:44] are coming from and I just feel the
[2:02:47] presence of God
[2:02:49] if you want to follow your feeling
[2:02:52] you will never even pray
[2:02:55] because you pray when you feel like
[2:02:59] prayer without season
[2:03:01] pray in season out of season
[2:03:04] prayer when things are good prayer won't
[2:03:07] kiss her bad
[2:03:09] Pray when you're on your back
