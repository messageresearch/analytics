you all Saints when I first came here this morning it was kind of cold and I got hot all of a sudden wonderful man a quick testimony I wanted to share with you guys you know so the glory and honor of God um so you know lately I just been having on my heart to pray I've been praying a lot more and it'll be strange times I'll be eating out of nowhere I just feel this strong conviction to pray and I put my my food on the side before you know I'm praying I can be watching something and I'll see something very unfortunate or sad and it would just cause me to pause when I'm watching and I'll just start praying and I don't know when it started or where it came from but I thank God that is coming you know and and as Christians I believe that you know prayer is one of our best weapons you know and just the thought of thinking that you know the weakest one Among Us which may be me I don't know but the weakest one among us if we would just get on our knees and pray what we can do to Satan's kingdom and I just the reason I share this with you guys because at work there's this lady I talked to she just turned 50 and we can talk a lot but one day he was there and she was just kind of angry kind of frustrated and I noticed it but normally when people was like that kind of give them time so that day went and it passed and then the next day I went to her I said are you okay she's like yeah I'm good I said you short she was like yeah you know I just kind of made a joke about it you know I seen you throwing biscuits around just wanted to make sure you're okay she had to laugh and she said I'm okay and she went on her phone and she pulled out something and she showed it to me and it was her older sister she was in a hospital bed and she had like tubes going to through her nose and just all manner of things was wrong with her she said she was unresponsive for weeks she's been in the hospital bed she's not answering nobody I believe in just all these things and she was just so broken down she was really sad about it and she she said she was worried so I looked at her and said what's your sister's name and she kind of smiled at me she said her name was Rebecca I said okay I'll pray for Rebecca and that was a Saturday we had church on Sunday and I was going to write it down so we can all pray together but for some reason they just escaped my mind and Sunday came and it went I didn't go to church I didn't go to work that day so the the following day I was in my room and I was praying and out of nowhere I just felt you know I'm just I'm just I just felt this presence come in a room and up our voices came to me not not literally but in my heart and it said you know when you feel the presence of the spirit of God ask for the impossible you know ask for something that you wouldn't ask for any other time and it just happened really fast as I was thinking what to ask for I started praying for my co-worker sister that she would come out of the hospital that she would be healed that she would be well and I just started praying for her and I did something very strange I started to thank God for the prayer that I just prayed I I normally don't do that but I just started to thank him for answering that prayer I said thank you so much oh lord for healing her and bring her out of the hospital we serve a prayer answering God you know I want to work the following day and I was I was there I was working and the lady came to me she was just all jumpy and happy and stuff I looked at her and she just kind of hit me I said what's up she said guess what in my mind I just knew it I just knew it she said guess what I said what she said my sister's out of the hospital [Music] [Applause] God is good she said my scissors out of the hospital I said when they let her go yesterday she said how did you know I said hey man I said amen it was it's just good to know you know when when we pray we're not praying to the wind we're not praying to the trees the Sun the moon but we're praying to a god that answers by fire you know I just wanted to give him that Glory [Music] [Applause] oh man oh man you can cry better than dark hallelujah amen oh my God bless you brother

stand on our feet let's let's sing another song here and uh [Music] and uh let me look at mine you know I've been in the kind of for a very thoughtful moves and this morning and I was up and trying to I was studying at the same time I was waiting to follow brother George Martin's funeral in South Africa a lot of thoughts started going through my mind because I was really looking forward to meet brother George this year then I met him before but I was planning to to go on one on his trip to Israel and uh what a what a wonderful man he is when it comes to doing that so just just did and uh following the service and and just you know just thinking on things uh uh it's kind of support me in the uh kind of a different move this morning but uh I pray that the Lord will kind of bless us because I want to sleep and then I was I was preaching in my sleep so I preached better in my sleep I don't know if I can do it now so I preached my message already while sleeping so uh so I pray that uh that the Lord will it was sweet dreams I woke up I sat down on the side of the bed I said Lord you have to help me you can do it again [Music] yes let's sing the song Washed by the Water of the word are you watch [Music] foreign [Music] when you die back on them of the past not afraid of what tomorrow Falls in store and you know the reason why there is just how it is [Music] ever dreams you can start over three and be watched By the Waters of the world are you what By the Waters watched by the water of the world are you what [Music] by the water [Music] of the world [Music] where you've been as I calling to the Lord you are just out of your existing and it's where he concerned there's never been the same for when God look your way he no longer see a scene of other things not by anything you've done about the flood of gospel songs and you watched by the water of the world why [Music] the father [Music] words [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you praise the Lord I don't know where that high-pitched verse came from but I was able to put it out amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you musicians that will be all for the singing as uh we will take our Bibles turn to Revelation chapter 11. we started speaking on the on the measure in the injure and why I was standing on that and and trying to look into it there was there was something that caught my mind during the week I was traded a little bit from that and just go into a few prophecy here so let's go back to Revelation chapter 11. and just like I said I really I need the grace of God to help and I think I got a text message in a week I think brother Freddie there's uh uh sister Rachel and married yet Dad I think they were back from uh their travel he should be traveling sometime in the week so we want to keep them in prayer that he will have a safe trip back to the Congo we enjoyed our brother really didn't have much time to be able to visit with him but we pray that the Lord will give us a good time Revelation chapter 11 and there was giving me a read like onto a rod and the angels still saying rise and measure the temple of God the altar and then and then they are worship therein so we were looking at those three things last week measuring the temple measuring the altar the altar represents the place of sacrifice it also represents the place that the word comes from and then uh and and also measuring the people that worship their Inn now verse two but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it net for it is giving unto the Gentiles the Gentiles in this sense will represent the heathens okay the healings so we will grab ourselves right here you realize that just by looking at this scripture being born again and coming into the kingdom of God God puts us under his rule of measurement and then he's going to deal with us different than the way he deal with the sinners praise the Lord they have things they would do they would get by with faith they have things you will do it don't fit under that measurement so God's going to deal with you for it but the courts wish is without the temple leave out and measure it net for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall be tread on the fort Y and two months 40 in two months the calculation will be three and a half years so this is putting us right in the tribulation time and now we give power unto my two witnesses they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and free schools a day clothed in sackcloth a thousand 203 school days will come to three and a half years these are the two olive trees now this is the thing that grabbed my attention during the week these are the two olive tree and the two candles take standing before the god of the Earth so these two witnesses are the two olive trees Zacharias chapter 4 speaks about the two Olive Tree and the two candlestick let's buy our heads we pray Heavenly Father we will ask your blessings upon your word dear Lord God and we want to thank you Father for uh the greetings hesitation Lord yeah that uh we brought bless the Lord O My Soul that's what David said in all that is Within Me Lord we don't want to forget your benefits we don't want to forget your goodness we don't want to forget how good you have been to us more than we deserve Lord more than we deserve father there's we we can never we can never compare to it you have watched over us you have kept us even till this time father we want to just ask your blessings now and if there is ever a time a mortar needs help from you is such a Time when we will break the bread of Life come and help us Lord and uh we will keep writing the pages of your word and be a blessing to your people we love you we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat uh but then you please you can please come back down let me ask a service from you just take uh uh the let's take Matthew chapter 17 Matthew chapter 17. when I was studying on this message I would be very friend with you uh came up okay I came up with uh with some some things in my notes were I was really going to pull up my gloves and uh you know and and be be friend with you and uh in uh in bringing some things and then uh now that I changed my mind though because uh I'm just going into this like I said the thought of the two Olive Tree and the two Candlestick caught my caught my heart during the week and I started looking into the ministry of Moses in Elijah which of course the Bible will identify the as the two olive trees and why God will call those two men the two olive trees and uh so we we will be looking at some few passages I don't think I would be through them but uh uh you know and and so just like I said I was thinking on uh uh you know just just bringing uh some things you know and being and just being uh out right with you as a church and uh because you know I was I was actually thinking about it uh and I was I was talking to someone and they thought you know just just kind of autonomy uh the Lord uh David dear says in the in the psalm teach teach me to normal Mondays that will apply my heart to wisdom and uh uh you know if you you look at it you you will realize that himalay we always we always have the idea to look at our life in uh in in a space of 100 percentage-wise you know uh uh even even the child that is that is that is born today and if the Lord choose to call their child that child has fulfilled percentage-wise 100 because that was the time that was allotted for them but you see with we human what we do is the other we think that uh uh 100 we take the the the thought of percentage and we we place that in our mind in the back of our mind we place there to our years but you if you if you look at it the Bible says we have appointed three scores and ten which is 70. so when you hit 35 you're already in the middle in your middle age you're already in your middle age and uh if you hit 40 I mean you have cross middle if you cross middle you're already on the other side you're on the downside praise the Lord it might sound funny to you but you know just thinking about it it makes me to to realize that uh you see uh [Music] when you pass your first 25 and and you have not been able to establish a purpose if the grace of God have now been able to help you to establish the purpose for your life no wonder you find people you know uh they just get into this uh uh Wilderness wandering you know they just they just go about and you know and and God in in in his law we know that just like there's a lot of contracts there's a lot of reproduction and God puts all of these laws they are also on written laws that are that are that govern the universe you know they are read on written law that govern the universe there was something that that blessed my heart during the week talking about this and uh uh uh and I I just kind of wrote that down uh I work as I was I was thinking about it you know uh David said in the in the psalm psalm 19 the heavens declared the glory of God okay and they have showed his handiwork you will realize that there are two things you go to Genesis from the beginning Genesis talks about the creation okay so God's creation you look at the creation you look at the heavens you look at the mountains you look at the things that God have created they declare that there is an intelligence behind it even if the ATS want to believe that there is no God but it shows that there cannot be other or design without an intelligence praise the Lord you see and uh but if you want to understand The Plan of Redemption there is very little the work the heavens and everything that God created speaks more of his work of creation but the work of redemption just like how the heavens declare the glory of God the Bible Halls the Bible sells just like the heavens it holds the mystery of redemption praise the Lord your father that people they they appreciate the creative work of God but they argue against his work of redemption why Jesus is the why why is Jesus the only way praise the Lord you see because the work of creation the work of redemption the mystery of redemption is it just cannot be understood after you have discovered the mystery of redemption through God's word then you can now connect it to Creation but outside of God's word there is no way you can understand the mystery of redemption so you cannot expect the Buddhists to understand it you cannot expect the mohammedans to understand it to be able to understand God's work of redemption is is placed in this book that's what this book holds praise the Lord amen and that's the reason why or unless unless we have accepted God Redemptive plan this book will not even make any sense to you it won't make no sense to you praise the Lord now so it's it's it's beautiful that way forgive me I will be all over the place so when you really think about it young people I'm addressing this to you if you really think about it you have to put your your I mean uh you have to put some things into perspective because every day you are adding to your age you are not getting younger amen from the first date is a day old it's not a day Young it's a day oh praise the Lord amen and what whatever wherever our lifespan is going to stop to God it's a hundred percent when you reach that 100 he call your card off some has been blessed to reach 70 then over 70. God bless you praise the Lord yeah he's my good friend amen and then and and it's it's a blessing of God amen so if you if we put this thing in your head and says well I'm 24 I'm I'm 23 then and you just think that you have all the time to fool around praise the Lord and you can now put a purpose to your life now so another thing about the mixture of creation and Redemption I want you to appreciate is that God made the son to serve the universe oh I pray that the Lord help us we bring this out to you and everything that God made they serve us praise the Lord what are you you like it or not if the snow want to calm down they don't listen to your cry it does not have a phone number for you to call it and tell it don't come is going to come and serve its purpose praise the Lord and this is what I want you to realize if the Lord will help us before I get into the life of these two men that is the same thing with Redemption that is the reason why you will never enjoy you know this thing the Bible says uh Salvation is a free gift and you always hear this you know people talk about uh is is individual affair the individual had a fair that is in Salvation is that when God gives you the gift of Salvation he don't give it to you and anybody at the same time he gave it to you individually praise the Lord but with them when you receive the gift of Salvation is no longer individual the gift is individual it's given to you individually praise the Lord but the mystery of redemption is just like the mystery of creation is to save the universe the mystery of redemption is that God now has given you a gift for you to go and sell that's the reason why the gift is not for you the gift is for the people now that's the reason why you will see in the Bible that God will set the life of a man I thought about this just thinking about all of these brothers and uh uh brother George Howard cancer in his body but I mean that man was he was always on fire for God when he preached you never know that this man is bartering cancer praise the Lord amen he uh just did a series uh recently that the the brothers in Germany asked him to do on the 10 sons of hit I mean the ten sons of Hitler yeah he called it the 10 sons of Hitler and a very beautiful series that was one of the last piece that he did I mean very beautiful he got a good start of teaching but you look through the scripture that's what I wanted I wanted I want us to come to you will see that God will set a man look look at that God I told the Levi's there was no inheritance for the Levi's they never had any Heritage they never had a land that was given to them nothing they did they were not asked to have an inheritance but yet they were to be to the service of the people they were supposed to be to the service of the people that God will put a man he would give a man a calling or give a man a gift and he will live all his life for in better people praise the Lord amen to him better people sometimes the people think that a call to the ministry is the place of wealth but you don't understand it you don't understand it I come back to my measurement I would there are some things I'll bring to you that's the reason why God choose to help us to understand he choose to take on a body and dress himself in flesh praise the Lord and he says Foxes have holds the birds have Nets but the son of man the creator of Heaven and Earth have nowhere to lay his head praise the Lord he borrowed a womb to be born and borrow a grave to be buried oh man Lord we need your help amen need the help of the Lord needed help of the Lord now uh uh where am I yeah so I mean uh so the uh the Lord called these two witnesses in Revelation chapter 11 even though they are names and that and that in Revelation chapter 11 but God identified uh uh a characteristics that goes with their Ministry and and based on that that's how we we have we have determined that is the ministry of Moses and Elijah praise the Lord now if you look at it in the Bible you if you read the entire uh Revelation chapter 11 it will establish it will establish it will established year the Bible talks about these two men and uh verse 6 Revelation chapter 11 these have power to shut the heavens that we saw in Elijah Ministry he shot the heavens for how long three and a half years so we're seeing the same three and a half years identify a year with uh with the uh wow the tribulation period so they have power to shut the heavens that they will not rain in the days of their prophecy and they have power to turn Waters into blood and that we saw on the Moses Ministry in Egypt praise the Lord now so with that in mind we we identify that these two men that are called the two Olive Tree and the two uh candlestick Moses and Elijah now if you really look at it you think about it you see it's uh Moses and Elijah you see that Moses wrote the five first book of the Bible and that five books makes the Jewish Torah the Torah is the five books of Moses that's what is called the Torah Moses wrote the first five book of the Bible and it makes the Jewish Torah and Elijah never wrote a book praise the Lord but the anointing the spirit that was on Elijah was used five times just like how Moses wrote five books praise the Lord amen so God has a reason he has a reason I thought because we didn't have a uh you know service on Wednesday we're just going to put two service into one so I thought you know referees are going to take a little time to greet you and then I'll come in to come behind again and preach another two hours praise the Lord praise the Lord yeah but I I prayed I won't keep you longer and uh so when you look at it you look at it let's let's look at uh some uh some scripture quickly Matthew chapter 5 verse 7 I wish I just took these things and put him in the notes I just put the verses up there Matthew chapter 5 verse 7. now all of these scriptures that I'm going to call there are some that we might read but what I want you to look at uh 17 sorry 17 that's 17 not seven it looks like if I wear these glasses it would be better Matthew chapter 5 verse seven one what I want you to notice in these verses is the Lord and the prophets okay that's what I want you to notice in these verses I'm going to call the Lord and the prophets the law and the prophet sum up the entire Old Testament praise the Lord is sum up the entire Old Testament so before we go through this let's read our second chapter I called it and we never did it Matthew chapter 17. I said Matthew chapter 17 and then I went on talking so let's read that and then uh we will we can be able to to Matthew chapter 17 verse 1 after six days so this was the seventh day after six days so this day that this even happened was the seventh day praise the Lord [Music] and after six days Jesus taking Peter James and John his brother and and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun in his remit was as white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias which means Elijah talking with him and uh then Peter answered and and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou will let us make year three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elijah why he yet speak Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud we said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased yeah yeah him praise the Lord now so uh I can now go back to those scriptures on the laws and the prophets but here we see that this is uh uh what is called uh the mounts transfigure Mass Transfiguration uh uh experience Jesus taking these these men uh and then bringing them to this place and here they are they are experiencing uh there is something that is that is that is important about this if you want to have the time to go and set it on it you will realize that this particular Mountain where they are on is is because of the experience is called you know man Transfiguration but that's not the name of the mountain if you go back and real estate it I can give you give you some Bible reference on that you will realize that it was on this very same Mountain those two prophets had their last experience over in the book of Deuteronomy is called Mount Nimble you go in the book of King it's called Pisgah Moses went down that mountain and Elijah was taken off from uh uh uh from the feet of Mount Pisgah now that that is just that is just uh information I don't want to I'm already nervous here so now so you look at Matthew 5 17 and uh Jesus there talks about uh I've not come to destroy the laws and the prophets but I've come to fulfill them praise the Lord he said you not come to destroy the Lord and the prophets but to fulfill you look over in Matthew chapter 7 verse 12 that's where he also gave what is called the Golden Rule do unto men as you will want them to do unto you so says the Lord and the prophets that's what he said in Matthew chapter 7 verse 12 Matthew chapter 11 verse 13 let's read that one Matthew 11. verse 13. now yeah he's talking about uh uh the ministry of John the Baptist and uh verse 11 for uh 11 11 chapter 11 verily I say unto you among them that are born born of women there have not raising a greater than John the Baptist now we're standing here that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffer violence and the violence taken about false now yeah this is what I want you to pay attention to for all the prophets and the Lord prophesied until John now what what is what is pointing to here in this verse is that John the Baptist ministry closed the Old Testament the Old Testament did not close by Malachi the Old Testament closed by John because John was a breach praise the Lord John was a bridge now so what what is is important year is the other thank you for them what is important here is that the the Moses Ministry represent the Lord because he was the one that gives out the Lord amen Elijah Ministry represent the ministry of the prophets what was the importance of Elijah's Ministry to bring the people back to the law that's what Elijah came to do Israel has forsaken the Lord of God they have gone into idolatry and here was a man that was going to bring he built 12 Stones put 12 Stones back together and said Lord let it be this that would turn the house of the people back to you praise the Lord amen we are looking at the two Olive Tree and the two Candlestick we will get to that in Zacharias but I'm trying to lay the foundation here so you can see why why God raised these two men and if you even look at their lives look at their lives Moses was born in a time of trouble praise the Lord he was born in a time of trouble and it almost looks like the ministry were interrupted that's the way that we from the natural will see it but with God it was a hundred percent praise the Lord amen Elijah came on the same we don't have no history about his childhood but he came right in a time of trouble when Israel has gone completely into idolatry Ahab got married to Jesse bioshi she was a a princess of a hidden King and she was bringing that influence into Israel praise the Lord are we together now so yeah the uh uh Matthew chapter 22 let's look at that also just keep looking at these laws and the prophets because if you understand that you will realize all of these people that look for for praises you know Paul want us now to be i7s you know because an i7 does not it does not play in the in the Plan of Redemption you are used but you are not the one that's supposed to be seen Jesus says do this work let your father be glorified that's what Redemption is so if you are looking for Praises you are looking for uh self-esteem and you you are not you don't fit into God's Plan of Redemption you don't fit into God's Plan of Redemption Matthew chapter 22. verse 37. Jesus here he's going to sum up some of the the the entire how you call it now let's go into some of the entire Commandments 37 22 37 Jesus said unto them thou shall love the Lord Thy Thy God with all the heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and the the great commitment the second is likely the the second is like unto it thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself amen praise the Lord if you look at the whole Ten Commandments it's just around there do not commit adultery if you love your neighbor you will not run after his wife do not convert if you love your neighbor you will not do so it's just that's what Jesus is saying is just around that and he says here on these two Commandments thank the Lord and the prophets amen so everything that is Place everything that is placed in the in the uh in the Old Testament he says on these two Commandments hang the Lord and the prophets now another one that is also beautiful for you to see this Romans 3 Romans 3 let's read that and we will take up there there are a lot of them there but uh this this will set us up and like I said I prayed I wouldn't take much of your time we can continue in another time [Music] praise the Lord you know what uh one one brother was saying this morning I was following that uh memorial service he said uh he said the sixth Dimension is becoming interesting he says well all of these guys go on the sixth Dimension is becoming interesting I said Raymond Thompson Romans chapter 3 . Let's uh let's look at verse 20. Paul says here therefore that these of the Lord he says therefore by the Deeds of the Lord shall no flesh be justified in his sight in God's sight for by the Lord is the knowledge of sin wash this now but now the righteousness of God without the Lord is manifested being Witness being witness so which means the laws and the prophets testify of God's righteousness that's the reason why we could go back in Genesis and take the life of Fatima when Judah said thou are more righteous than I we can take their life of tema in the Old Testament because why is standing as a witness of God's righteousness that God's righteousness was not after the day because after the day you were condemned tema how can she disguise herself as a harlot and trap her father in law but if you look in the deeper thoughts she wanted to be identified with the promise so yeah Paul is saying that the law and the prophets that we call the Old Testament is a witness to God's righteousness praise the Lord to his righteousness without the Lord do you understand that no I got to read it again I don't think you understand it I don't think you understand it praise the Lord amen no flesh is Justified by the Lord amen now but now verse 21 the righteousness of God without the law praise the Lord the righteousness of God without the Lord so without the Lord even before the Lord came into being God has was always a righteous God amen even before there was a lord that's the reason why you cannot you cannot be legalistic and be justified by Lord because the the righteousness of God was before the Lord but he says here but now the righteousness of God without the Lord is manifested being witnessed by the Lord that's what I want you to understand the righteousness without the Lord yet the law and the prophets stand as a witness to that righteousness without the Lord amen praise the Lord amen that's the reason why you can find this kind of scenarios in the Bible when when when uh when Moses will preach and says they are the uh uh he will blast against and and and and and condemn more up and we know the history of the people tomorrow there was lots and his two daughters you know those those kind of for ugly sins I mean it blowed the minds of the infeeder how can how can you call this Bible a sacred book and it has those kind of accounts in it why because God is the god of Truth praise the Lord he just did not hide all the the ugly story and just bring out good stories praise the Lord amen now so what good could come out of that one gold could come out of lots and his daughters but yet that will be the very place where the best story of redemption is ever plain in the Bible praise the Lord so you see you when you read the story of Ruth you know every time I read a story in my mind I'm thinking the nearest man the man that was the nearest Kingsman the only reason why he refused to redeem Naomi was because of Ruth he could not stand the thought of a moabite praise the Lord amen if you don't know the Jews you have to know them you he will not stand the thought of and more about but you see how God in his great wisdom allowed there to be their way because Boaz was the man that was ordained to take off his shoes kick it in the head praise the Lord in a mess of everything that was said glory be to God so that's why Paul is saying here the righteousness of God was manifested and the Lord and the prophet stand as a witness and said that is truth so the scriptures think the very same scripture that says no Abomination we entered into the congregation of the Lord that seems structure stance and say Amen when Boaz took roof praise the Lord amen now you look at Aaron and and and and uh uh uh and and his sister Miriam arguing against Moses because of the wife that he married praise the Lord and when Moses was the same one that preached to them and told them because don't marry no strangers praise the Lord but yet the righteousness of God without the Lord amen the law of God the Lord and the prophet the Lord and the Commandment for their hands and still say Amen to Moses that God never came on the scene and said Moses you are your your brother and your sister are right no God says that's my seven amen if I would talk to any man I speak to them through dreams and vision but Moses is not like that we sit down and talk face to face [Music] The Lord Is Thy favoritism no is the righteousness of God without the Lord the law of God will say Amen Hallelujah so the Lord and the prophets stand as a witness that's the reason why Paul could said in Hebrew that the Lord is a shadow because when your Shadow is on the wall is serving as a witness we don't know if it's a man or woman but we know somebody coming until you start coming closer praise the Lord now they're all dressed the same but we will start we start picturing in our mind and walking yeah I think he's walking like a lady I think that's a lady there praise the Lord and then when you come closer then we see the picture so that is what Paul is saying here that the Lord and the prophet serve as a witness so you go through the entire uh uh uh Bible you will realize that and the reason why I'm doing this like I said I'm establishing the fact why the scripture point to these two men as the two olive tree praise the Lord and the two candlestick Jesus said wherever two or three I gather I will be there in the Amish he says Genesis 1 26 let's let us make man in our image and when God made man he make man male and female praise the Lord God worshiped that principle he works with the principal of two if two were agreed upon anything it's a principle it's a rule of law with God are we together amen so all of these things were you know people struggled in their mind to make themselves a a special one and you know and all of that you are just you are just helling down the wrong way for a crutch you will never be able to bring out a perfect picture of redemption or you would never even be able to understand your purpose of life until you have been able to identify your companion because everything that God set it out that way he said it out he lay it out a place are both in creation and in Redemption that's why the moon reflects the light of the Sun he lay it out that way and you see it is it is all fall his doing is for his Beauty praise the Lord sin just take as ticket selfish nature to man and all we think is just our self praise the Lord amen we just we just get so consumed in ourselves and in that way there is no way you can be able to bring out God's purpose for your life Jesus says you have not chosen me and I have chosen you praise the Lord I have chosen you and he choose us choose the disciples to be able to work out his plane of redemption amen so uh [Music] we we travel in this way just want you to as we look at all of these things together so yeah we see here that uh Zacharias chapter four you go to zechariah's chapter four you will see uh the prophet Zacharias talking about two olive tree and uh let's go to Malachi 4. let's go to Malachi 4. let's go to Malachi chapter four we love to read that about the Elijah Ministry praise the Lord you love to read that and we read Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 but if you look at verse 4 what the scripture says remember ye the law of Moses my seven so write in the promise of Malachi chapter 4 yet the Moses Ministry also stands out amen because Elijah don't have a Ministry unless he have what he's restoring the people back to praise the Lord so you see that's the reason why uh uh for the coming Elijah Ministry almighty God comes right there and says remember here the law of Moses my seven wish I commanded him in her what was that the Ten Commandments that was the law of God that was the Torah so yet God keep carrying these two Ministries because we need the word and the spirit that's what Jesus said in Saint John chapter 4. praise the Lord if you just had the word you you are just intellectual praise the Lord amen and if you have the spirit without the principle of the word you're just going to make a very poor poor example of a Christian praise the Lord you be one of these ones on a flowering plane that said Jesus said I should open the plain door praise the Lord if the Lord want to take you he don't need to damage the life of the rest of the other people amen he can pick you up you can disappear from on that plane nobody will know so that that is the balance that is the balance are we together foreign it is not just word word word and you don't have the life to back it up praise the Lord you don't have the life to back it up they have to be the life it counts by the birth of the Spirit by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body so you see it you can go back to the life of these two men a little bit here praise the Lord because there is uh there is a very tremendous in the book of Jude let's look in the book of Jude it's already one o'clock here so I try to find a place to close foreign the book of Jude verse 9 that's one chapter verse 9 yet Micah the arc angel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses praise the Lord this is the only place in the entire Bible where we have this account but let's go to the book of Deuteronomy and see how Moses left the scene praise the Lord can you think about it uh young people this man Moses the the kind of for opportunity there Paul speaks in the book of uh [Music] in the book of Hebrew 11. that Moses forsook the pleasure of Egypt praise the Lord he forsook the pleasure of Egypt Stephen brought out a beautiful thing in in the book of Acts I will show it to you another time not today because uh it would just it would just uh it would take us through another thing but there was a reason why uh uh Ramsay was very angry against Moses you have to realize this this word of taking on great Nations civilization like many of us have done it did not start it now even the great Apostle Paul he he was a citizen of Rome not by birth because of his because of his father so Paul had a Roman citizenship and then he threatened the the praising God and says are you going to persecute a Roman and when he came to father that he was he had a citizenship a room to push back a little bit so even in in ancient time Moses became an Egyptian because the the the the the Pharaoh daughter adopted him praise the Lord so that's that's another one I'm going to I'm just going to leave you right there but he had this privilege to become the next pharaoh praise the Lord because the Pharaoh that was on the throne that pursued after Moses was younger than him they all grewed right in the palace if you study the book of Arts carefully that Pharaoh was also adopted he was not an Egyptian so I I say I was hanging you there but then I let you go praise the Lord but I'll leave that for your assignment and uh so but but Moses how all this privilege that he had praise the Lord you could think that it would have even been an easier way if you have just choose to stay become the Pharaoh and tell the people your goal but you see God purpose don't work like that as chapter 7 the bible say it came to his heart which means Moses heart was burning he was trouble he couldn't sleep he came to his heart amen that's what the Plan of Redemption will do it will make you it will give you sleepless night for others if you are having Sleepless now for yourself yeah there's a problem that you either be you are having Sleepless now because you're saying God I need more of you oh God deliver me but not Sleepless now why I don't have money why my life is like this why my life is like that praise the Lord that God purpose will smash him from what you would call success it was snatching from that place create a rage in his heart he would go and kill an Egyptian and live in living the best of bed living the best of food and going to the wilderness where he don't know where his future is Redemption will rob you of your selfish nature and make you a seven [Music] that's why Redemption will do to you all these people that go to all of these prosperity meetings they want to be there it's just all about themselves they want to prosper they want to they just want money in their own wealth and all of that you can find Christ in that because there is no testimony from the laws and the prophets the laws and the prophets don't witness to that praise the Lord that he'll go in the wilderness and all of that and and then after that God will meet him Exodus chapter 3. and say go back to Egypt he will come back and the Very people he came to deliver they will withstand him to his face praise the Lord the very people after he have gone and I spent 40 years there believing to himself that he have settled down now look at my years now I think it's okay for me praise the Lord Egypt has gone from my mind he gave his little part-time job pushing ships around praise the Lord he had lost all his friends trying to take that from his mind God will meet him in the burning bush and give him a commission to go right back to the place where he run away from [Music] go back to the responsibility that you are running from praise the Lord he would he would he would pick up courage and try to go back and get back there hoping that the people will Embrace him they will send him right to his face you run away prophet praise the Lord and then he got back and now so to to Pharaoh let my people go both of them knew one another so when Moses entered the palace it was not a strange thing praise the Lord amen that's that's that's some of the reason why that Pharaoh was stubborn let my people go and then right after that again the the the the the the punishment of the Hebrews increase nor straw you are made breaks everybody oh what while the guy came back for now he come back we get trouble all right instead of the people held him praise the Lord everybody started looking at him with another eye praise the Lord God Rob him of his little life his little home that he have praise the Lord and that's the reason why this struggle even with the opening of the Red Sea right after the cross they started complaining you brought us here to chaos praise the Lord is the complaining of the people is the complaining people you don't know and I will let you know amen how the actions of the people it's easy to send the preacher to his grave the action of the people listening to something that a little book that is called the devil sales and I have to read that and preach a message Satan is on the cell he's having a garage sale the same way you do garage sale so you don't have a garage sale his most pressures product he sell is discouragement that his most precious you know what he put on it not for sale he's just having it there but he put now for sale because as long as he can keep it he will stay in business as long as he can keep it he will stay in business praise the Lord thinking about all of these brothers or just they are following that service this morning Mama I was just thinking what would become of that church what would become of that church no doubt there are people that are sitting there they are planning their plots if I'm not the minister I'm going to quit I'm going to split this church I'm going to have my own in it I'm just sitting there I'm thinking in my mind what will happen to this church praise the Lord and I can help and think what will happen to our group if the people have not grabbed the vision of what we want to achieve here that's why you don't understand that's what you don't understand God don't give it to everybody he give it to one man yes that's that's his choice the very people that God says I will wrap these people out and start another generation Moses says don't do it he said God don't do it if you do it what would the nation says the very people he pleaded for were the same people that caused him not to see the promised land God have to take him off the Earth because of the attitude of ungrateful people the very same people that Elijah was sent they have been so glued into idolatry they have built Temple for bars all over the place he was sent to bring their heart back to the to the Lord of God challenge the prophets of God on my camera it was not done behind the curtains everybody everybody was called to come and Witness if God is God that he sent fire from heaven and consume your sacrifice praise the Lord all of that they did turn away no no the increase in their idolatry I'll tell Elijah had to run for his life he had to run for his life praise the Lord like I always say you labor for the people there are your whole life you are half the day they hear something about you that they don't know or they don't like whole Pastor that when you become whole you are whole when they can find your weakness but you will be killing yourself for them you are half okay it sounds funny but it's not funny it's not funny it's because you people don't understand y'all don't understand y'all don't understand and it's not everything that the preacher tells you he don't tells you everything praise the Lord he don't tell you everything the time is fasting and just like I said I will hold you in these thoughts because there are things that I want to drive to with this subject and we now want to run after it but there's a reason why God took the life of these two men and uh you can see when Joshua after uh after the Moses he took the people into the promised land he distributed the Promised Land and uh God promised Joshua as ours with Moses so I will be with you praise the Lord and uh Elijah in order of his ministry he did only eight miracles Elijah upon whom his Spirit came that will be the second time that God will use the the spirit or the anointing of Elijah Elijah Elijah did 16 miracles it goes to show that Jesus said in his word The Works that I do shall you do even Greater Works we cannot do greater than our Lord it's just that when when you when you grab when God can get a people get an uh uh Joshua on the on the uh Moses Ministry it's just a continuation it's a continuation praise the Lord and then all the years of Labor will now be blessed all the things that Moses put in sea form they will now reap the Harvest if God can get an Elijah honor an Elijah Ministry he can be able to Smart the Jordan and find his way back he says where's the god of Elijah why because he have a double potion praise the Lord if Christ can get a bride that cracked the vision now the people that are trying to make names for themselves and build images for themselves and be Empires for themselves but people that grab the vision of redemption that's why Jesus says you are the salt the sword do not self itself a gift taste to others the song gave taste to others if your Christian Life is making the church making people to lose taste for God then there is something wrong with you something wrong with your experience amen you can only be in a good good mood at a certain time and and then you quick to Flap off the scene and say some sorts of things yeah yeah then you come back again praise the Lord that all the Christian Life well the spirit can't keep under control you can get in the flesh and get in the spirit you will enjoy your Christian Life when you understand that the purpose that God saved you is to make others testing is to make others to feel off of your life is for others to benefit is not to make you proudful to think that you are special untouchable see all of these uh people um anybody touch me the fire of God will consume them that when they're doing those things which means they're doing something that is not right their heart condemning instead of them to go and repent the church has made them arrogant the purpose of redemption see that song that comes up it comes to bring Warmness it does not serve itself come to bring Warmness to you musicians you can come like I said pray for me and these need God's help and uh we had a tribute to fenne Crosby there was a line in there we had uh brother Eric from South Africa preaching for us so I just couldn't go into that but I had a line in there that I wanted to address to my young people the ones online and the ones that I hear Fanny Crosby she she was a gifted lady that she never saw blindness as being handicapped she believed that blindness was God's gift to her to make her a blessing to the word but you'll realize with all of the perm that she wrote and the way that she touched the hearts of people she really never came to faith in Christ even though she was not living wrong she was not living wrong but she never came to faith in Christ until I think she was about 30 years 35. we are looking my notes Here the same thing with John Wesley taught honor a Godly mother how Susanna pray for her children and she taught them the Bible John and Charles became a gift to the word John the Baptist I mean John Wesley he was he was going on missionary trip even came to the America on his first journey and yet he had not come to faith in Christ he says so young people you have to go beyond the church atmosphere because you come to church every Wednesday you come to church every Sunday you know you're just like the Young Rich ruler he did everything you keep the Lord and all of that but when you have not have a birth experience don't fake it [Music] don't fake it don't don't pretend it's something that you must be Desiring God help me save me I want to be safe there was a song I wish I can I can remember now let me see if I look in my notes hearing that will help me there was a song that brought Fanny Crosby To the Cross to the to the foot of the cross foreign [Music] take all of your time I will I would I would get back to you on that [Music] foreign Wesley he was coming from the U.S on his first missionary trip the ship he was traveling back to England that's where he met some man that came out of Luther Revival [Music] and they were talking about the scripture and all of that and and that's where John knew that he needed more of God [Music] that's what he knew he needed knew that he needed more of God foreign the new birth is a reality people is not a church membership it's not a group Association it's an experience [Music] it does not mean that you will not have struggle it does not mean that you will have challenges but I mean the Faith of Christ will be planted in your heart that no matter what you go through you always have a reference you always have a place to run back to [Music] a few cost I was going to read this morning [Music] from from the from the Ephesian Church age [Music] foreign [Music] from presuming I just read the one from presuming I will leave the rest when we take the subject back again we will we will dive into them let's presume nothing stay with the word and God's obligated to make that word is a seed and that word will bring forth everything a promise to bring forth it will do it it will take the word out of you it would take this word the desired of this word out of you [Music] it will sanctify you it would make you live a different life it will make you do things that you that you taught you couldn't do things that it looks like it's hard for you to give up this word has the power to take it away from you it has the power to deliver you things that you offend you can't get over whenever you think that something is so hard for you just
