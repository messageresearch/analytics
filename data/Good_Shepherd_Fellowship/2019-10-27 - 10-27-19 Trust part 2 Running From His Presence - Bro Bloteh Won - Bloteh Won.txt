but you have to do that because it's a Word of God I just want to testify about something that happened yesterday and also maybe encourage somebody I think many of us know I've done that you know to where you know where I'm just gonna run to the story and then you leave the stove on so yesterday I left I was living the house I was cooking and there's something I do on the side you know there's a little part-time job at doing that but he usually coming on on my phone you know you know if I mean yeah you have order so I can choose to do it or not and one came and it was a pretty good money so I said well I'm gonna pick up this one I'm gonna go and take care of this my older son Jeremiah went to see his friends so you're just the twins with me adilyn and his brother jr. so jr. was taking a shower so I said to Adeline let's go well she said no that we have to wait on my brother because you know he's almost ready I said we know let's go you know just gonna run and when I come back you know he can stay by himself you know there is less weight on him so we're on him you know so we left I thought I'd turn off everything on the stove because I was cooking but I was doing that something was coming my mind I said a better forgot one of them I did not turn rough come to find that it was true I get a call later on you know and the fire department had to come in and bust my door you know because you know apparently those is smoke you know but I didn't know what really went on you know till I got home so when I got a call in all this all along I was just thinking for the worse I say I hope it's not bad I hope he's not bad I hope he's not bad you know and I want to pick up Jeremiah from his friend you know and they know go home and I thank God he was not bad at all he was not bad at all I mean there was no any damage the only thing you can he does you know the smoke you know something burning you know they just have to bust one side of the door you know and it's fixable so but one of the things that you know I want to encourage everybody know we just moved to this new place by the months ago but since I've been the message you know since I was really not I mean the true God I call it you know who's really know God you know everywhere I move you know I always get my pastor to come and bless the house I always dedicate my house you know to the Lord you know so this new place even know we have not been there for a for a month but you known this place was delicate you know - God you know and his servant kami know and pray for this house so I truly believe that if ma one of my son or my daughter stay behind I don't know what will happen because they don't know how to turn off the stove but you know you're just aggressive God you know and the energy of the Lord you know always you know what your place even when you know there and you always you know try to do the right thing you know play as a family pray in the morning I just want to encourage anybody who don't do those things known to always you know make sure when you get a new place you know you're moving to somewhere even know you pray you already dedicate yourself know but get your pastor or somebody know to come you know and pray you know for for you for you for your place because that's what Solomon did you know his temple you dedicate that to to the Lord so that's just what I wanted to share with you because I don't know what will happen you know I mean that other just the grace of God I mean because you know one of them was gonna stay on that was not my plan because I knew I was just gonna go and in combat praise God amen praise the Lord Thank You Johnny amen let's go ahead and stand and sing that song sing that song there's no one no one like Jesus you know I'm moving I'm moving

name we pray amen Allah bless you you may have you see like I said it's good to be in the house of the Lord and we brought our readings on Wednesday from the meetings there in a cancer by the weight of announcement I got a text message I think there is an instruction in the fellowship that we wanted to have down in Winnebago with sister and Jackie and sister now I mean spoke with heard I think there are some family concerns so we will put that on hold for now but we will continue to pray for our sister praise the Lord amen so I want to I want to I really want to trust the Lord this morning to be able to do something and let me start like this I think it will help me and let's go to first Kings chapter 2 verse 4 first Kings chapter 2 verse 4 and like I said there are three senses that came with the fall and wish of course many of them came also with the fall but it's being curious and anxious and afraid and that's how I feel this morning I'm anxious to bring the message I'm afraid that I may mess up also I pray that the Lord will kind of help us this morning first Cain chapter 2 if I don't have my scripture written wrong but this was David talking to his son Solomon now the days of David drew nigh that he should die and he charged Solomon his son saying I go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man used that one time to preach a message but that's not what I want to talk about this morning then he's telling Solomon how he can be a man and keep the trash of the LORD thy God walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandment and his judgment and his testimony as it is written in a lot of Moses that thou may prosper in all that out does and were so ever they'll turn of their self now verse 4 that the Lord may continue his word which he speak concerning me this is David saying that God would continue his word Solomon I'm charging you my son do these things that God would continue his word that he spoke concerning me saying if that children take heed to their ways to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul their shanna filthy he said a man on the throne of Israel praise the Lord first Kings chapter 14 first Kings chapter 14 so David is reminding Solomon year that God has given him a word and and and we will see how their looks here over in in first game chapter 14 verse 8 that's reversed and a few verses we want to read and reign the kingdom away from the house of David and give it to Dee and yet there have not been as mine 7 David who kept my commandment and will follow me with all his heart to do that only which was right in my eyes God is testifying of David year that he followed God with all of his heart to do that which is right but he always did that which was right know he stumble amen he made mistakes but God is testifying of David's heart I will together now keep that in mind 2nd Kings chapter 23 verse 25 second king came 23 verse 25 23 verse 25 is a speaks year also of Josiah 23 25 if I got my scriptures written right and like unto Him was there no King before him they had turned to the Lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might I calling to all the Lord of Moses neither after him rose there any like him now keep the scripture in mind and think about Solomon when when God visited Solomon like we said Wednesday night the scripture says there was there was no man that God gave the gift of wisdom on to Solomon amen no man before has ever risen to the level of the gift of wisdom are we together now yeah the scripture also testify of a desire being a man of that you know that that turn to the Lord over in the first king where we read about a David the scripture says he followed the Lord with all of his heart the scripture speaks here of Josiah he turned to the Lord with all of his heart out of his mind and and everything that he gave to the Lord let's watch another scripture also here 2nd chronicles chapter 22 verse 9 second chronicles chapter 22 verse 9 are we together and he sought our hazard and cut him for he was hated in Samara and brought him on to jail and when they have slain him they bury him because he said they he is the son of Joe Scheffer who sought the Lord with all his heart amen Joe Scheffer was the king that went down we a hub concerning the land and he had drew him into the battle and a North dead and the Bible says he was a garlic ink but see the way that the scripture places David followed the Lord with all of his heart Josiah turned unto the Lord with all of his heart Josefa sought the Lord with all of his heart now I don't think that God by inspiration made a mistake when he plays these things in the scripture the Bible speaks of of Hezekiah and he says Hezekiah trusted the Lord with all of his heart praise the Lord well I know definitely I gave you something to think about but I don't want to row my message this morning I definitely gives you something to think about but I don't want to ruin my message this morning but what I want to say there is dead just like we said on Wednesday night brother Branham said praise the Lord and we read over in crisis to Mister of glory bill where he said and that there are all of those prophets since notice now down through the ages he being gradually letting this out slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets and through the we we can just go on and and expressing himself he expressed himself in Moses look at Moses born in a time of persecution of the children he was born as a deliverer you know and and and he and he went on with all of that and and he said this all those things type him Christ but yet the mystery was here then man the prophets didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something now holding it back in in the last days for the great revelation by expressing it now so all of these men all of these people that we just read about the Bible said they were men of like passion I believe many of us sitting here this morning has sought the Lord and when we are seeking God what about a word of Prayer or whatever way we are seeking God looking for God water in the word you know I believe with all of my heart this morning that it is not just partially we really want to know this God praising all and I believe that in some areas of our life we have trusted garden and and that's what I want to come to this morning and you know I would just say by the weight of introduction you know like brother branham said in the message he preached call you know God in his own word he says we we are coming down to a troubled times troubled waters ahead of us there are a lot of things that are going to happen as long as we stay in this life there are things that were happening surprisingly amen and and I would want to encourage you before we get into the word that I believe with all of my heart that we are at such a place work you know God has given us everything we have hurry reformers we have had men you know they have lived lives of repetition we have had you know I mean job in the Bible his testimony is a standing we have had Moses we have had people that have suffered different things we have all of these example that I mean God has given us everything and the reason why he has given us all of these things and people of example is for us to learn to trust him praise the Lord amen and they are things that we my face even right from this service or whatever it is that it would be hard to explain but sometimes God would allow those things because you want us to trust him praise the Lord amen are we ready to trust the Lord are we going to trust him with all of our heart praise the Lord the Bible says Hezekiah trusted the Lord with all of his heart and you see in the lives of all of this man David father the law with all of his heart but yet he had problems praise the Lord Josiah even their young king he turned I like the way the Bible says he turned all of his heart his mind his mind everything to the Lord badda bodda the the the Lord of Moses fresh alone but go back and read the life of Josiah and see when he came to his letter - that things to happen praise the Lord jellow Shefford he sucked the Lord with all of his heart but yet when it came on making a decision to go to go with a HAP there was there was some level of sympathy because after all the land of remedy de was was for Israel go back to the book of Joshua that was one of the city of refuge so Ahab was not wrong to want to take God's land back or take the land of the children of Israel it's just that he was not the right person praise the Lord but because we are a social place and time and you had this thing with people I trusted God I trusted God how can this happen to me I mean I've been saving the Lord out of my life how can this happen to me how are we together read this with me a man running away from the presence of the Lord that's what I want to kind of lay mine mine inspiration this morning sometime something like I was told one time that a lady said back back in the her summer Kadesh said the hearse run away with her going from church now this is going from church this is after service she got into her chair and sat on her chariot and it just kept running I mean the hearse went mad praise the Lord the hearse run away wave her going from church said what did you do she said I trusted a lord until the line broke well that's the time to trust the Lord not until after because many of the time while we say we are trusting God is because we are holding to something in a slide when we don't see that thing anymore then then where is God where is God amen we have something we have maybe a loved one maybe we have a job or maybe you know what there is a church or you know somebody that we are looking up tall something we are holding and as long as we have that thing to our great we can say go on with the trials and and troubles but when it caught can you stay trust God I mean can you still trust God when your health goes bad can you trust God when you lost the job can you trust God when your marriage get into a mess can you trust God I trusted the Lord until the lamb broke well that's the time to trust the Lord after the lamb broke you are trusting in the line until it breaks how would you get it let me read another quote here from the church each book just I just pray that the logo will help me now I knew that you know the Lord will be able to bless us who have had so much trouble you know just being able to find timing and ready steady and pray with the different things that were happening you know but our God is faithful amen but BAM says here in the church age box listen to this he says have you ever noticed how sit on hit toolbox in the Bible more than all others amen true liberal theologian in pesos scientists is always attacking the book of Genesis in the book of Revelation in Bocca be in both of these books we find set on origin his awful ways in his destruction that is why he attacked him he hate to be a sports and in those book he is exposed for exactly what he is jesus said about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him and if that was true for Jesus that is also true for every child of God he has no part in us that does not concern this body amen oh yeah because a tutor of this body this this belongs to him is of the dust its breda between the seven and Eve but when Jesus said he had no part in me praise the Lord because we are live we are in an age that had reduced God to material things people want to see God when they see money or they see frame the seed and see that they see well they see material things around him that's when he can see God are we together he has no party meaning I have no part in him the devil would like to prove their difference but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence amen and this word confidence means trust to destroy trust in the word I mean to destroy trust that's all he tried to do if he can get to the place word he can destroy your trust in what gods were saying praise the Lord and to know that by the Word of God the universe was created so if your trust is destroyed in it you will not believe nothing there is nothing left for you to believe so you try to destroy confidence in the word but when the when the church disbelieves sitting and believe the spirit of revelation of the word of God the gifts of Hell cannot prevail against her now so we can go right back to the beginning let's go back to Genesis and I will show you where the devil destroyed a trust in God's Word for he she said God said I were together Genesis chapter 3 and the second was more soft I than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the 7 we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the mists of the garden God have said the word of God that was God's Word amen that was God's Word go have said Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 and a Lord God commanded man saying of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for the day for in the day that thou eat the of thou shalt surely die they were giving Terry nine words to keep amen they were given today nine worse when sit on pole not there thou shalt not daddy became 40 the number of temptation so year that was God's Word now Eve is repeating what she had heard from the world what her pastor to her amen she's repeating it the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of all the fruit of the tree of the garden but of the fruit in that the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch at least yet dying amen and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die that was the line are we together amen but see what it did for God does know that in the day ye did off for God does know and what that shows there is there but there is something he never told you because there was the thing that woke up Eve curiosity whoa what is it for God does know and that is the thing there destroy trust amen when a person feel that something is being healed from him most of the time in relationship and business amen and when I feel that my business partner is hiding something from me a distraught trust Amen most of the time that's the trouble in relationship when a person feels that this person is hiding something from them a distraught trust so that was what that they will use to destroy Eve trust in the world God knows he never told you everything there's something that he's hiding from you but even if he does not tell us why we had to go through the sickness or go through this can we stay trust him can we stay trust him because most of the time we have come to to such an age where we have in all the right and the right to know we have in all the right and the right to know so we even want to bring God down we want we want to lower him down to our society standard that God you all mean the right to know and because you're not letting me know I don't trust you anymore why may people back up on God go call on God they go dead on God because they feel dead they had they have the right to know ancestors calm the right to Norma ancestors DNA the right to know my bloodline price alone am I sound funny to you but it's a serious issue it's a serious issue and this is the way with God and that's this is the way he approached it when God made man the reason why he never told Adam everything because he trusted him oh yeah the prophet of God said he trusts us more than we trust ourselves praise the Lord so it was to him he his trust level is established because his confidence his trust the very substance of trust is God himself praise the Lord Satan tried to destroy the confidence and when it's gone is gone it's hard it's hard when it's gone is hard it's hard to wrap your mind around it that is the reason why we have in you know I mean it's almost like the floor of north of Davos cases praise the Lord because the verified of people establishing the fact to trust God they don't want to trust the Creator yet they want to trust somebody to spend the rest of their life wave amen the Creator that may you amazing ancestors of that person know their genetics and everything that rub down their bloodline we don't want to trust him but we want to trust this stranger that just appear like I was talking about Epsilon I went back and I started studying on it a little bit because I don't know how I got caught up in that Wednesday night so I went back and I started reading a little bit on that and and and and I realized the other you know I was I was honor my inspiration and I read the scripture I don't even know where I wrote down because I wrote a bunch of Scripture there on Absalom and the Bible talks about it you know a place word you know the way he faced his head and I was just thinking about it I said he might be looking like a smart businessman maybe there was coming the one way amen and the Bible says that the people love absolutely men yeah he was able to win the heart of the people praise the Lord but that's that's where we are that's where the word is that's why we have all the trouble we have in the world today because we will not trust our maker science want to create a sane to let us to know we came from somewhere and when we cannot rightly establish where we came from how can we even trust our very existence how can we trust our existence how much do you believe that you're not dreaming this morning you really believe you in church do you believe that you sure you believe it it's not a dream praise the Lord I think you dreaming I really think you dreaming maybe you just need to bite yourself how can we how can we trust our existence how can we trust there will be a tomorrow if we try to ignore the fat of trusting and believing in the invisible God praise the Lord the reason why we trust to be here this morning because we know he would be here amen praise the Lord that's the thing that brings us here that's the thing that brings us with three hours of sleep four hours of sleep tile our busy weekend but yet we can drag our ball a year because we know that he will be here we know that he is a living God it's not just a religion we know that he's real trust in the Lord with all your heart that's what Solomon says trust in the Lord with all your heart he leaned that on to your own understanding praise the Lord like I said leaning onto an understanding it's not wrong when is your own understanding and that's why you have to check it up amen because that word lame also in the Greek means to trust when you are leaning on something you are trusting on it can we trust God can we trust praise the Lord young people can we trust God for a future can we trust call for the future when people look at in that I mean filled your mind with with with all the things that Holly will present them you know when it when they make their love movie they never pull nothing ugly be it's all centered around emotions amen emotion and that's what is he and that's what young people run into when you come right out of from the Georges office they start costing one another and they drive to separate different times can we trust God where BAM said this he says this he says some time ago there was a woman a Christian Science woman trusted the Lord for her baby and it died in California or across the nation within 24 hour time every paper magazine I'll be a little bit personal with this every paper magazine all you see you see what I mean you see what I mean divine healing you can trust it see what is it that's what it does that baby died well they they are always trying to point somebody to someone who went a little too far and they never think about the time that that didn't go for enough less than theirs and all saying and and I don't mean to I don't mean it for an expression of base I mean but sauce for the goose is is it's for you know all you all folks and all those things but what what what what drew my mind to this is there even right right around this message brother but Rachel cops used to be in Oregon his son pastored a church there now you say he was all all preacher he came from the days of the of the revival he hangs out with a allele and over rubbers in all those different man he was a strong believer in divine healing brother brother Lonnie said he was not going to give his body to chemo he trusted God for His healing a man that preached healing he pray for the sake and God healed people he trusted God for His healing and yet he died it pleased the Lord to take him by the way of of sickness and those things were even trouble in their family its trembles some of them yeah it's tumble some of them some of the family members struggle with they're not not only damaged I just mentioned because those are familiar names and you find people some of them they're not even saving God they don't respect God's Word they don't respect God's laws but when there is a little trouble like a health situation of a child or something it's all God and you know I trust in God and I need all the prayers and this that and then when it pleased God to take what God gave when a please go to take what he gave then they get angry I can trust this God there is nothing like this God praise the Lord I think we need to we need God to help us he followed the law with all of his heart he still had troubles amen but you see his trouble never took him away from God his trouble brought him more closer after he had trouble that was when he saw God more because he knew that I'm giving go out of my heart how come that I find myself in the situation which mean I need to give him what I'm not giving to him Hezekiah trusted the Lord he sought the Lord and fist the world and God came down giving you 15 years and what he did in the early there a few years that God gave him he brought the Babylonians and exposed them to the treasure of God and the Prophet came right there and says now said the Lord you have turned Israel over to Babylon on their way they would go but this would not happen in your time praise the Lord but what happened it has a tyre back up and says how can God do this to me how can God do this to my children out of those Old Testament prophet whenever that comes to that place when they have trust God and something goes wrong it make them to trust God more it make them to get them and repent in a chase a bunch of arrogant people around the Christian faith they just arrogant just proud people that were not even spend a day with God they were not even spend ten minutes with God let things go strong they'll open your mouth and it was a blasphemous thing out of their lips praise the Lord you trust the Lord with all of your high we're just thinking about Joe Scheffer when I read that scripture the Bible says he sought the Lord and some of us we are at that place we are seeking God but you know the danger there is there for you to limit God because you got a King James Bible all because you got a summer book in your hands that's Emma book or this Bible is just there to make God more real to you it's just there to have you draw closer to God because God want to be more than a book he want to be a person he want to be personal he don't want to be a history God that we can print to and he want to be a present tense God that is right here now in being can we trust God for our children can we trust him for our children our loved ones praise the Lord old brother Hara bacod he says love is blind it receive His sight when he gets married that's better baked it he's in love is blind Lord receive his eyes when he gets married you see when when when we do things when we make choices not trust in God when problem comes we don't know how to trust him because you never started by trusting God maybe you were trusting some kind of a beauty shining teeth gold teeth when we when we need to be trusting God if you don't start trusting God you will know how to trust him the rest of the way praise the Lord that's Brad - tell me it's just you know it's young brother one is that you want to marry the sister and Ike the sister do you know the seven seals I said I wish I knew I wish I knew that young man praise the Lord and I also wish he never knew I was a preacher but I just I just told young people that's his war he does not deserve a daughter of God because now he's asking about seven seals tomorrow what will he be asking about tear poured seventy weeks of Daniel it just all up yet it just all up here there is no love in his heart he's a beast foolish beasts a beast I learned how to speak English Andrey English and he can be able to read but after those things are done can we trust God because sometimes you can wave all the flags and show all the signs where Benham says the man keep jumping over it every time God throw a roadblock did jump over it they have gone to all the Olympics they know how to jump but after we get there can we stay trust God praise the Lord Solomon was remembering what his father David told him he was remembering read the book of ecclesiastic an improv herb read it just just read it think about it put yourself in the pages this was a man like I said Wednesday night that was one of the things of Solomon libera BAM said God broke his mystery in all the lives of this of the prophets amen and he is fulfilling the same in our lives and one of the thing that was in Solomon life was God's hidden wisdom that is the reason why I Solomon could not ask for anything different but wisdom because that was the mystery that was hidden in his life he was not david favorite son in one sense to say it until God pointed it out go read first King a second summer chapter 13 the Bible says after the ship he had a child and the child was sick that was the child of adultery the child was saying God would take the child away David cried and David cried and David cried in and in the Lord took the child away and the Bible says after David hide and not a child by a bail Sheba year comes Nitin he steps right into the house he entered into the hospital whether it was the hospital wherever it was but where the child was born he stepped there let's read that a little bit here and see this beautiful picture beautiful picture praise the Lord it's a picture is something that you know I'd like to say many of us message believers will not do we won't go to Bathsheba to visit her in a hospital amen that's chapter 12 verse 24 and David comfortable Sheba his wife and went on to harder labor for her and she bare a son and called his name Solomon for the Lord for the Lord loved him and he sent by the hand of nature and the prophet God by the hand this is how Devon knew that the Lord loved his child because God sent net on the Prophet the very man that came and condemned David in his in his Foley Nathan came stepping through the hospital door and said David I knew you have a child the Lord just spoke to me last night and he sent by the hand of nature on the Prophet and called the name of the child praise the Lord kind of amiss what I'm reading verse 25 and he's sent by the hand of nets on the prophet and called the name of the child Jedediah because of the Lord you mean that was when David started to take a close look that there was something about this child Amen that you mean Nate on the Prophet Oh step right in here right in this live was hitting a deep wisdom of God many of us will see our life right in the very same thing God's wisdom praise the Lord yeah we know the story about Solomon he built a temple the presence of the Lord came down the glory of God came down he had a successful reign Sasha wisdom that he would not even divide the child praise the Lord praise the Lord and yet people claim to have wisdom and they would use the very word of God and the divine family they would divide churches Solomon with the wisdom he would not divide a child that he will even make the woman there was not the mother to go away happy I mean who was the one that cried and said they shouldn't divide the child it was the mom praise the Lord I will rather have it the even the one that never had a child went away happy even though she was guilty but she saw the wisdom of Solomon but we claim to have wisdom and gifts in Revelation we can learn of course to cause division destroy families destroy homes but there was such a wisdom that was embedded in there man and you know how God will bring out those wisdom go how to allow Solomon to go into idolatry he had to allow Solomon to be taken away praise the Lord he never lost his gift because when he came back to God then he said I've seen everything under the Sun I have seen everything under the Sun and he said young people commit your youth to the Lord commit your youth to the Lord go hard to allow him to go into all of those things and then when he came back he started writing those things repeating the very thing that his father David told him my son trust in the Lord with all your heart praise the Lord trust in the Lord with all of your heart even if your heart don't want to trust the Lord trust the law with your heart argue with yourself but what we do we give ourself reason why we must not do right praise the Lord give us some reason and sometimes when people get to that place you you read the message are leaning out onto your own understanding verbatim says I was now I'm not encouraging you know electric say it's good he says is it going to school and degrees it's it's good for you know a good job a good paying job and different things he says but God don't want us to lean to death amen because sometimes when people has achieved and has achieved I mean it just get in their head get in your head they become arrogant to become disrespectful they are not afraid of God all the people of God praise the Lord there was this cruel man I mean very cruel wicked man somebody just like Noah there you know in the in the Bible the husband of Abigail a wealthy man but foolish until cost him his life this man was a very arrogant man I mean wealthy man and the only thing he talks about is justice wealth and how much he has until his wealth make him wicked we get to the point where he was even wicked to alter I mean it's his children his wife everything told his wife when I died you bury me with my money wrote it in his will I suffer I work for it and it was right in the hands of the attorney when he died wife the attorney came and says yeah he said you should bury him with his money she says it's no problem that his money he worked for it she went to the bank asked him to give her a check she wrote every cent he had on the cheque and lady in this coffee when you get on the other side you cash it praise the Lord people that came here when they die they can hear you know why ever you said to them they don't have choice you put them in a wooden box they can't choose I just love God he made a time where every man were yet there was down when you say one word they say five when they are lying right there you can say anything to them they would not say a word they say you wicked an arrogant man when you get on the other side cash it I'm talking about trusting God I'm talking about trusting God and that's one of the place where many of us are struggling praise the Lord because we are just like that woman we are holding on to something we are holding on to something but when he breaks can we still trust him praise the Lord you see the scripture says trust the Lord with all of your heart I mean most of the time we trust God through somebody I trust the law because I you know love of message of my pastor all this happening and like bourbon says you know right there you are holding on to their thing so actually is the thing that you are trusting but when that thing is no more when that thing is no more can we still trust God handwriting on the wall damn man today the high currently taught he did trusted the law for his healing and and he has failed to receive healing and then he become discouraged and said if I haven't got enough faith to be healed maybe I haven't got enough faith to be safe he said where sometimes we try to reduce God for and it's and it's all because sometimes we don't give ourself to learn we don't give ourselves to learn we don't give ourself to understand what God has given to us that's the salvation of the soul is far away different from the healing of the body it's two different things Amen it's two different things praise the Lord and Gauss people through the ages have have different problems in different trouble some have high I mean I mean I'm in trouble trouble listen to John Wesley when he talks about the trouble he had with his wife with all the teaching the garlic teaching his mother gave him I mean he was so he was so consumed I say young man coming up I mean he was so caught up with doing doing things for the law and and and and wanting to reach out to the world and and and you know when I mean he was so involved in the things of the Lord until he got married late in his life well yeah he was there was a house of hell but he could trust God in it and you know what he said he said the sucess of my ministry I attributed to my wife because she gave me so much trouble I had to be on my knees all the time she was not just an Aggie one she has some muscles she will pull him around the house with his head but yet all of his trouble would take him down on his knees and he would go and seek God he would go broken before God crying to get himself ready for another revival what are some other things that we are complaining about what are some of those things it reduce go down to material things praise the Lord this is not really kind of a subject to to preach it is just something to to think about it is something to think about are we trusting God are we following the Lord with all of our heart does that means that we will not have troubles I have left everything of the word you have you know I've had left all my ways in in order of those things and and anything about it there is that people what do dia is there they come to try God and they leave all of those things in a closet so when when it does not work I can go right back and pick it up they will didn't know where they left those things they're nowhere to live all their filter dressing or the out the idea they are Jamison and and they know exactly where they left them so I'm just coming to try this thing and see if it will work you're not trusting God trust the Lord for your heart praise the Lord it's not an easy thing people it's not a thing that you can calculate you can pull it on your calendar you can put it in time to it praise the Lord can you imagine job saying even if he slay me I will trust him that is a man job never said that from the beginning let's follow that I close here in a few minutes let's follow that he never said that in the beginning chapter 2 chapter 3 he complained amen he complained but he had on he followed a little bit praise the Lord and one of the powerful thing that is that he never despised God he never kicked God he never insulted God he said he said he said wise God I don't even know why he would bring a man of flesh like me into George man with him he's not the kind of a person where we can go to his house sit down and talk the matter in one where joy was feeling cheated because he knows all my ways I don't know what he's doing but he know exactly everything that is happening to me when you see over and over job kept as rotten God I don't understand it but he's a wonderful God I don't know about it but he's a mighty God he kept assaulting God in a mess of everything then it came to a town where he broke he got over it he says even if he slay me how we trust him praise the Lord and for a matter of fact what job was going through it was God's choice for him some of the things we are going through is our own choice that put us in it let's bow our heads musicians you can come it's too sweet to trust in Jesus Jesus Jesus how I love him with our heads
