[3:18] services this morning
[3:20] but i trust that everyone that wasn't
[3:24] will
[3:24] get that tape or i believe that it was
[3:28] the most straightest message to the
[3:30] church
[3:31] since that the message of sirs what time
[3:34] is it
[3:36] i felt the anointing of the spirit felt
[3:39] led to say what i did it was long
[3:41] but yet i felt led to do it
[3:44] i think the lord by his word showed that
[3:47] what our we're living and make sure that
[3:50] we understand
[3:51] these mysterious things that's happening
[3:53] you know the bible said
[3:55] the wise shall understand
[3:59] but the nations and the people will go
[4:02] weaker and wiser just think the average
[4:06] america now
[4:07] is in middle age about 20 years old
[4:10] weaker but wiser they didn't have jet
[4:14] planes in them days and and atomic
[4:16] warheads
[4:18] but they live a lot longer we're getting
[4:20] weaker and wiser
[4:22] and our own wisdom is what's going to
[4:25] destroy us
[4:26] we will destroy ourselves god will not
[4:29] destroy us
[4:31] our wisdom will destroy us it's always
[4:34] been that way
[4:35] and so will it be again
[4:38] now the lord willing next sunday morning
[4:42] not knowing now what i will speak on but
[4:44] i trust that the lord if he lets us live
[4:46] and nothing happens
[4:47] that be his will we aim to speak another
[4:50] message next sunday morning
[4:52] have prayer for the sick next sunday
[4:54] night then it falls my lot
[4:57] to return back home
[5:00] to arizona to take the family back
[5:03] so that the children can register in
[5:05] school
[5:06] then you will notify you just as we can
[5:10] of the meetings as they mature or the
[5:14] times that we are places that we aim to
[5:16] be so
[5:17] god bless you all now tonight knowing
[5:21] that it's
[5:21] i'm 15 minutes late to begin with
[5:24] quarter till eight here in
[5:25] jeffersonville
[5:26] and um that's about a quarter of the
[5:28] nine
[5:29] at the east coast and then it's about
[5:33] five o'clock
[5:34] on the west coast so now we are
[5:38] just about sun down here and i want to
[5:41] speak to you for just a short
[5:43] service to try to find the anointing of
[5:46] the spirit
[5:47] and then call the prayer line now i want
[5:50] the congregation here
[5:52] as well as the congregation assembled at
[5:55] other places
[5:57] find some man some brother that's
[6:00] anointed by the spirit
[6:02] and when we start praying for the sick
[6:04] go lay hands upon those that's in your
[6:06] congregation
[6:08] remember god is omnipresent
[6:11] he's everywhere so down in
[6:15] texas over in california up in arizona
[6:18] wherever you are
[6:19] lay hands on those that are sick when we
[6:21] start praying for the sake
[6:24] and i'm sure god will hear and answer
[6:26] prayer
[6:27] strange thing last sunday night
[6:30] and the anointing was going on in the
[6:33] holy spirit
[6:34] it's quiet a thing i hadn't had a
[6:37] a line of discernment for months and
[6:39] months since i was here the other time
[6:42] then to walk up there under a promise
[6:44] you don't know that he'll do it
[6:47] you can't say he'll do it you just got
[6:50] to walk up there and
[6:52] wait he's sovereign he does what he
[6:54] wants to
[6:55] but stand there and wait to see what he
[6:58] will do
[6:59] then feel it break through like that and
[7:02] at the end of the
[7:04] meeting not knowing who it was but
[7:07] there'd been a
[7:08] a man somewhere along the line
[7:11] that was tall bald on top
[7:15] and he was a very sick person then right
[7:18] at last there was a man
[7:20] appeared here on the platform and had
[7:23] his
[7:24] head down and looked like he was
[7:26] suffering
[7:28] holding himself around the stomach and i
[7:30] thought
[7:31] that must be that first man or second
[7:33] man or whatever it was at a prey point
[7:36] because he was bald and was holding his
[7:38] head down a large man
[7:40] stooped over but i looked around
[7:44] and i found the gentleman sitting out
[7:46] there but he was
[7:47] rejoicing i thought where is it
[7:50] i couldn't decide where it was at i
[7:52] could feel it and see the man before me
[7:55] i felt it pulled around this way and it
[7:57] was coming from bank
[7:58] i looked at brother neville and these
[8:00] two sitting here it wasn't them
[8:02] i said the man is on the inside of that
[8:04] babs tree back there
[8:05] you know who it was brother shepard
[8:08] reason i couldn't recognize him he's
[8:10] sitting back there with his head bound
[8:12] praying he thought he was going to die
[8:15] has
[8:16] thought that for the last few weeks his
[8:18] wife told him go get a new pair of shoes
[8:20] and he said i won't need them
[8:21] i won't be here that long and he met me
[8:24] the other day and
[8:25] up there in the yard brother woods is
[8:27] shouting and praising god
[8:29] said i'm eating bacon eggs tomatoes
[8:32] anything i want
[8:33] and humbly giving up his seat
[8:37] getting back in there out of the way and
[8:39] praying see
[8:41] you don't need a prayer card you only
[8:44] need
[8:44] faith see i didn't know whether he was
[8:47] healed or not
[8:48] i just said a man praying
[8:52] has got something wrong i think he
[8:53] called what it was stomach trouble
[8:55] and praying back behind here the lord
[8:58] jesus make you well
[9:00] now that's all i could tell the pull was
[9:02] that
[9:03] he was praying i could see it but what
[9:05] happens i don't know
[9:07] see but when you see it come back
[9:09] everybody's aware when it says thus
[9:11] saith the lord see that's not me
[9:14] speaking no more than
[9:15] that's him but i always say jesus christ
[9:18] has made you whole
[9:19] that's exactly the truth he was wounded
[9:22] for our transgressions
[9:24] with his stripes we were healed see
[9:28] but when it comes thus saith the lord
[9:29] and tells you what to do and what's
[9:31] going to happen
[9:32] watch that it'll be that way but when i
[9:33] say jesus christ healed you makes you
[9:36] whole you believe it because he's
[9:38] already said it i'm just repeating what
[9:40] he said
[9:41] in a vision is just repeating what he
[9:43] showed
[9:44] you understand now may we
[9:48] hurry up get right into the word because
[9:50] i know that
[9:51] many of you are here got long miles to
[9:55] travel tonight i pray that god will
[9:57] bless you help you and protect you along
[10:00] the roads
[10:01] and now
[10:04] i wish to turn tonight to saint matthew
[10:09] the 21st chapter and verses
[10:12] 1 to 11 in saint matthew
[10:15] and now if you don't have your bible or
[10:17] you want to jot down these scriptures
[10:20] all right now to you who never heard the
[10:23] message this morning
[10:25] and you have a tape recorder we
[10:28] never solicit selling tapes we never
[10:31] solicit selling anything
[10:33] sometimes in a big meeting the announcer
[10:35] got some books back there
[10:36] we don't make anything out of them
[10:38] brother dale's a writer
[10:40] the tapes the man
[10:43] operates the tape business there will
[10:44] tell you we don't make no tape money
[10:48] we don't paint the tapes it's the
[10:50] message and when a man gets on his mind
[10:52] that it's money
[10:53] he ain't gonna make tapes no more that's
[10:56] right i asked it about it i think our
[10:57] tape sell about
[10:59] under five dollars or something three to
[11:00] five or something like that
[11:02] why say three and four for them
[11:06] big long tapes and a certain minister
[11:09] i asked about one of his tapes and it
[11:11] was nine dollars
[11:13] about 20 minutes or 30 of a message so i
[11:16] see that our
[11:17] brother sophomore backyard is not
[11:18] getting rich any of them on these tapes
[11:20] that they're
[11:21] they're putting out see they make this
[11:23] enough to get by
[11:24] can't ask them to make them for nothing
[11:26] because they have to buy the tapes and
[11:28] everything else and the machinery is
[11:29] very expensive
[11:30] costs about ten thousand dollars gets
[11:32] set up to make those tapes to begin with
[11:35] now i understand soon i have announced
[11:37] it yet but there's a tape hearing again
[11:39] every so often we the trustees i have
[11:43] nothing to do with it at all
[11:45] i don't even know it none of the
[11:46] meetings it's another
[11:48] pro or con they turn in their bids the
[11:50] trustees decide
[11:52] who is the next man to make tapes and
[11:53] they send him a letter that's
[11:55] all i know about it they take care of
[11:57] that because i can't even dedicate
[11:59] babies
[11:59] let alone take care of tapes so
[12:03] are baptized so i've got my mind set on
[12:06] this message
[12:07] that's that third pull it's the one i
[12:09] must be loyal and reverent to
[12:12] matthew 21 1-11 i said that so he could
[12:15] be watching for the are turning to the
[12:17] scriptures
[12:19] and when the and when they drew now
[12:23] onto jerusalem and were come to bethany
[12:27] onto the mount of olives
[12:31] jesus sent two of his disciples and
[12:34] saying unto them
[12:35] go into the village over against you and
[12:38] straightway
[12:39] you shall find an ass tied and a coat
[12:42] with her loose them and bring them to me
[12:46] and if any man say ought unto you you
[12:49] shall say the lord
[12:51] has needed them and straightway he will
[12:53] send them
[12:55] this was all done that it might be
[12:57] fulfilled which is spoken by the prophet
[13:00] saying tell ye the daughters
[13:03] of zion
[13:07] behold thy king cometh unto thee meek
[13:10] setting upon an ass and uh
[13:13] hold the fold of an ass and the
[13:15] disciples went and did as jesus
[13:17] commanded them
[13:18] and they brought the ass and the coat
[13:22] and put on them their clothes and they
[13:25] set him there on
[13:26] and a very great multitude spread their
[13:29] garments
[13:30] in the way and others cut out branches
[13:32] from the trees and strew them
[13:34] in the way and the multitude that went
[13:37] before
[13:38] and that followed cried saying
[13:41] hosanna to the son of david
[13:44] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[13:46] the lord
[13:49] hosanna in the highest and when he was
[13:52] come
[13:53] into jerusalem all the city was moved
[13:56] saying who is this
[14:00] and the multitude said this is jesus the
[14:03] prophet
[14:05] of nazareth of galilee
[14:09] now if i would take a text from that for
[14:12] about 30 minutes before the prayer line
[14:15] begins
[14:16] i would like to take this for a text
[14:18] what is the attraction on the mountain
[14:23] now it had been a very
[14:26] weary nervous day
[14:31] and it's an unusual day we find jesus
[14:35] here coming
[14:37] up to jerusalem ready
[14:40] to attend the passover and the passovers
[14:43] were the
[14:44] paschal lamb was killed and the blood
[14:47] was spread
[14:48] upon the mercy seat for the the
[14:50] atonement
[14:51] for of for the people and he
[14:55] come up from bethage and had come to the
[14:59] top
[14:59] of the mount of olives which looks down
[15:03] upon another little hill where jerusalem
[15:06] was built as he looked to know
[15:10] that this was
[15:13] his final visit this was the time
[15:18] that when he would be delivered into the
[15:21] hands
[15:22] of sinful man and they would
[15:25] kill him he'd die the harmless death
[15:28] that was ever died by a mortal
[15:30] and be buried he'd be betrayed by his
[15:34] own
[15:34] some of them standing right with him and
[15:36] him being god
[15:37] knew what was in their hearts and knew
[15:39] from the beginning who would betray
[15:43] and know that man was with him who sat
[15:46] by his side
[15:47] counted his money to him and so forth
[15:50] know that man would betray
[15:52] and knew that a cruel roman cross
[15:56] waited for him out there he knew that
[15:58] his
[15:59] water and his body and the blood of his
[16:02] body would separate
[16:04] and the blood would drop off of his
[16:06] forehead great big drops like
[16:08] perspiration
[16:10] he knew all that was before him
[16:13] and he stands upon the mountain looking
[16:16] over to jerusalem
[16:19] the people of that day
[16:23] the what they call that day a better
[16:26] religious class of people hated him
[16:29] the churches of that day hated him and
[16:33] denounced him
[16:34] and denounced all that listened to him
[16:36] as they went and attended his campaigns
[16:39] they were immediately excommunicated
[16:41] from the fellowship of the church
[16:44] no wonder the scripture said he came
[16:46] unto his own
[16:48] and his own received him not
[16:52] the ones who ought to have loved him the
[16:54] ones who ought to be in for him was his
[16:56] bitter
[16:57] bitterest enemies and he had made up his
[17:00] little group
[17:01] out of a bunch of poor people fishermen
[17:04] tax getters uneducated the bible said
[17:08] some of them was even ignorant
[17:10] unlearned some could not even sign their
[17:13] name
[17:15] he never went to the churches to get his
[17:17] people
[17:19] and he never agreed with any of the
[17:20] church leaders
[17:22] and besides that he followed the very
[17:24] trend of a prophet
[17:25] he condemned everything that they done
[17:29] as the ones before him had because they
[17:31] were a portion of the word and he was
[17:34] the word in its fullness
[17:36] but in the midst of all of it through
[17:39] every age and every prophet
[17:41] that had been or would be there's going
[17:44] to be a certain amount of people that's
[17:46] predestinated to hear that message
[17:49] and they'll follow it those
[17:52] ignore the crowds they ignore
[17:55] the criticism of the unbeliever
[17:59] they they have no argument with them
[18:03] they've got one thing to do that's
[18:05] believe
[18:06] and to get every bit of it they can
[18:10] soak it in like mary who sat at the feet
[18:13] of jesus
[18:15] and martha was fixing his dinner
[18:19] and jesus said to her but
[18:23] martha you are so concerned about the
[18:26] things of life
[18:28] but mary has sought the better things
[18:30] see
[18:31] the things of eternal life
[18:35] now we find that
[18:38] many of the people that i'd understood
[18:42] they didn't have uh literature as we
[18:44] have today
[18:45] they didn't have television or
[18:47] telephones or anything of that day
[18:50] but it been kindly breezed around that
[18:52] he was going to be
[18:54] at the passover for many of the people
[18:57] being
[18:58] spiritual minded knew that he was
[19:02] that passover lamb because it already
[19:05] told him
[19:06] the things that was going to happen and
[19:09] then of course
[19:10] knowing that he was to be there and
[19:11] loved him the way they did
[19:14] they was waiting for him there was a
[19:17] crowd
[19:18] that was probably pushing shoving
[19:21] from one gate to the other watching out
[19:24] in every way for they knew
[19:25] that one of the hours he would appear
[19:30] they were watching others were wondering
[19:33] what was the matter of these people
[19:35] running from gate to gate what's the
[19:37] attraction
[19:39] and they would look this way and look
[19:40] that way to find out look like they were
[19:43] looking for something
[19:45] under expectation of something going to
[19:48] happen
[19:50] oh how i would like to change my text
[19:53] for a few minutes
[19:54] and say this that that's what's the
[19:57] matter today
[19:59] the people who are looking for him
[20:01] coming is under great anticipation and
[20:04] expectations
[20:07] we can feel it the pressure
[20:11] and they're seeking watching every move
[20:15] and every sign
[20:16] comparing it with the scriptures and
[20:19] when they seen
[20:20] all those things that was predicted of
[20:22] him right up to the end they know the
[20:24] end was nigh they wanted to be there
[20:28] so they watched part of the crowds was
[20:31] foreign
[20:32] in the minority some was against him
[20:35] most of them
[20:36] 90 was against him and that's about the
[20:39] way it is today
[20:41] in the religious crowds when it really
[20:43] come down to the word
[20:44] and christ there's about one percent
[20:47] that would believe it
[20:48] the other part wouldn't pay attention to
[20:50] it no matter what was done
[20:52] they'd pass off some kind of a joke or
[20:54] throw a slam about it
[20:56] just about the same time things don't
[20:58] change very much
[20:59] history just repeats itself around
[21:03] well we find that draw a nervous tension
[21:07] it had to it must do it
[21:12] they were waiting they were wondering
[21:15] what he would do when he got there
[21:18] they wanted to be there to get anything
[21:20] that he'd done they wanted it
[21:22] they wanted to see it they believed him
[21:25] others that heard he was coming
[21:26] and they went up there to make fun of
[21:28] him so after
[21:30] all the nervous anticipation
[21:33] a very unusual day very unusual time
[21:37] church is asleep the people's nerve was
[21:40] on age
[21:42] there were so many people there then it
[21:45] happened
[21:47] on top of mount olive
[21:50] come a little white donkey
[21:54] coming walking down the hill with a
[21:57] group of people
[22:00] fanatically screaming pulling off
[22:03] palms leaves off the trees
[22:06] throwing their clothes in the road
[22:08] screaming
[22:09] hosanna to the son of david
[22:13] that comes in the name of the lord
[22:17] that this little mew
[22:20] his writer was none other than god's
[22:23] anointed messiah
[22:25] of the hour
[22:30] god then what was he doing what is that
[22:33] attraction up there on the hill
[22:35] it's god making history
[22:39] and god fulfilling prophecy
[22:44] and that always causes an attraction
[22:48] it brings all the critics up the
[22:50] vultures of this morning's message
[22:53] and the eagles also see
[22:56] they come together to find out what's
[22:59] going on
[23:00] some coming for curiosity some coming to
[23:03] find fault
[23:05] others coming to criticize there's all
[23:08] kinds gathered as we said this morning
[23:10] believers make believers
[23:11] and unbelievers what's on the mountain
[23:15] prophecy is being fulfilled now
[23:18] we'll see what takes place now
[23:22] in the book of zachariah
[23:25] in the ninth chapter and the ninth verse
[23:28] zechariah
[23:30] one of the prophets spoke in the spirit
[23:33] saying this
[23:34] rejoice greatly old daughters of zion
[23:37] shout o daughters of jerusalem behold
[23:40] thy king cometh unto thee
[23:43] he is just having salvation
[23:47] lowly and riding upon an ass
[23:50] upon the full occult the fold
[23:54] of an ass now
[23:57] what was the matter with those scribes
[24:02] what was the matter with those priests
[24:06] what was remattered with those religious
[24:08] people
[24:10] this was wrote 487 years before it
[24:14] happened
[24:16] by vindicated prophet and was already
[24:20] put into writings and called the bible
[24:23] the scrolls of the old testament
[24:26] why couldn't they see that that's
[24:29] prophecy
[24:30] being fulfilled
[24:33] the same reason they can't see it today
[24:38] they took the word of god and made it of
[24:41] non-effect to the people
[24:43] by teaching for traditions for doctrine
[24:46] the traditions of man
[24:49] and of scribes preachers ministers
[24:53] spiritual man so-called anointed ones
[24:56] would only read the bible
[25:00] they wouldn't be wondering what's taking
[25:01] place they would know
[25:03] what it is
[25:06] god fulfilling his word
[25:10] history was being made prophecy
[25:13] was being fulfilled salvation to the
[25:16] world
[25:17] was arriving the great day that
[25:20] all the prophets had looked forward to
[25:23] all that was in the grave was waiting
[25:25] for that day
[25:29] think of it all that had died
[25:33] all the righteousness of the blood of
[25:35] the martyrs and the prophets which you
[25:37] just screamed out
[25:38] jerusalem oh jerusalem
[25:41] you the stone every prophet that i send
[25:43] to you
[25:44] and kill the righteous how often i have
[25:47] hovered you as a hindu would have brewed
[25:49] but you would not but now
[25:50] your hours come everything that was in
[25:54] the grave abraham
[25:56] isaac jacob all the prophets were
[26:00] waiting for this hour and the church
[26:03] was blind to it
[26:07] who is this caused all this noise
[26:10] who is that fellow that said one time is
[26:13] not that the carpenter's son over here
[26:15] we know him where did he get this wisdom
[26:18] while we don't seem connected with any
[26:20] of our schools
[26:22] we don't know any books he ever learned
[26:23] from who is it he was the answer
[26:27] of the prophet's prophecy here he comes
[26:31] rioting upon the fold of an ass
[26:35] what an attraction god was fulfilling
[26:38] his promised word
[26:39] the hour that had been waiting since 4
[26:43] 000 years and genesis
