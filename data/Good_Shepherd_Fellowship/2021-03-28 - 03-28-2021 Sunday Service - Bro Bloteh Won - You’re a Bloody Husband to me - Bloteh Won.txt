thank you musicians [Music] exodus chapter four let's uh read from verse 18. exodus chapter 4 we read from verse 18 praise the lord amen praise the lord as we stand in honor of the word lord be to god in verse 18. and moses went and returned to jethro his father-in-law and said to him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethrens which are in egypt and see whether they be alive and jetro said to moses go in peace praise the lord moses has just encountered the pillar of fire he has got his commission he's planning his trip to egypt and the law said unto moses and median goal returned into egypt for all the men i did we sought the life and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the role of god in his hands and the lord said unto moses when they go with to return to egypt see that they'll do all those wonders before pharaoh which have put in their hand but are we having his heart that he shall not let the people go and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus said the lord israel is my son even my firstborn and i say it on today let my son go that he may save me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even that firstborn and it came to pass by the way in the end that the lord met him and sought to kill him well i thought god just commissioned this man i thought he and god was just having a good conversation praise the lord let us pray heavenly father we just want to ask your blessing upon the word now lord and come our father and speak to us in a way that only you can in jesus name amen the lord bless you have your seat we will continue to read amen praise the lord amen verse 24 and it came to pass by the way in the end that the lord met him and sought to kill him then before uh zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody hussman that out to me so he let him go then she said a bloody husband there are to me because of the circumcision amen praise the lord this morning i want to preach a message called you are a bloody husband to me praise the lord you are a bloody husband to me glory be to god amen praise the lord you are a bloody husband to me praise the lord amen my my you love the lord this morning we want to thank god for all his goodness his grace his love and mercy amen praise the lord what what an experience what an expression you are a bloody husband the law sought to kill him the scripture said and uh and then in verse 26 the bible says so the lord let him go the lord sought to kill him and then the lord let him go glory be to god amen but it's uh it's an amazing amazing story here you you think about that and you think about the god that we have to deal with you know he's not a man god is never falling in his nature so god don't keep grudge praise the lord he don't have no evil thought and i mean he's just an awesome god praise the lord and his ways as the bible say is past finding out god's ways are just extraordinary was it a surprise that god was he a surprise to god that moses didn't second sign his son now why didn't god deal with that before he even gave moses a commission why god didn't deal with that that's the way you and myself will behave we will get angry and we make sure we got to deal with that and make everything right praise the lord was he a surprise did god just find out what moses was about to take off and say oh i forgot he never dealt with that now we got to deal with it no that's not god because he do not change his mind concerning his word praise the lord amen but we want to talk about uh a bloody hussman and uh uh [Music] and what we want to we want to emphasize on this this morning is uh uh the second session the importance of the second session the coveting of circumcision because you see if if if god did not made a confident with his people the exodus was not important to god his confidence was more important than an accident praise the lord and to show in the scripture and see in the scripture how the covenant of circumcision is important god how to he had to reference that at the beginning of the accident and at the end of the exit before joshua would give the people their inheritance god had to come back to the covenant of circumcision because it was it was well it was where god sealed his promise to abraham when he promised abraham that he will be the father of many nations god sealed his promise on the coveting of circumcision he established a covenant with abraham praise the lord are we together so we want to we want to talk about that this morning but let's take the road let's take this route of a bloody hussman and trust that the lord will be able to help us praise the lord you see the the word of god is so it's so amazing it's so amazing as as we've been as we've been studying in the world you realize that you know statement i made in the bible and then sometimes we fail to realize who actually is making a statement or why the statement is made praise the lord and uh but like the scripture says you know uh uh man of old out of inspiration wrote this book this is this is an inspired book and every word in this bible is inspired amen every word is inspired no contradiction it's all because our human mind failed to understand we want to use our canary brain to understand the great mind of god but you realize that in every pages of the bible god's prophecy lays page after page and verse after verse and things that are said in the bible that make no sense to us yet they are prophecies praise the lord you go and start reading through the old testament and sometimes people get so bold with the old testament and it gets so confused with the old testament and says all of these nations and and you know all of these haha names in the bible and you know in all of that if it was not important god would not put it there praise the lord even if we don't understand it but it's important that's the reason why he put it praise the lord and every scripture and every scripture and every verse in the bible will be speaking to something in our day in our time praise the lord it's a book of prophecy but let me go this round statue of a perfect man let me take a little story here uh and then we can start like this a young man asked me in the other date and said you think i could or to marry or to get married brother branham to such and such a guilt i said how much do you think of her he said oh my i just love her i said well if you are going if you are not going to live without her you better marry her then but if you can live without her you better not praise the lord oh i can preach a whole message out of that amen i just felt inspired when i read that i think i can change my subject this morning praise the lord so but if it's going to kill you you better go ahead and get married i said and so what i was trying to get to him this that if you love her so much now right now before you are married everything everything is just fine and danny but after you get married then the tolls and trial of life comes in praise the lord because marriage is not a hollywood movie it's not even a nigerian movie not an indian movie people fill their minds with movies and they think that's life praise the lord the thing you want to build your life out of somebody is making money out of it they add their part in the show they give them their cash and they go and now you taking the ass alive when they are just acting but after you get married then the tolls and trial of life comes in that's when you have got to be so in love that you understand one another when you are disappointed in her she's disappointed in you you still understand one another that's the way it is with christ see we have got to be so in love with him till when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit see why and the only way you can do that is to become partaker of his divine nature then you will understand the reason why he can give it to you partakers of his divine nature so what i want to bring out of here is that like like the prophet of god said there is disappointment in love praise the lord and when we are disappointed sometimes that's when we we uh we express ourself sometimes in the most unpleasant way praise the lord job said you speak like a foolish woman now that his wife were foolish but he was disappointed for her to say curse god and die he was disappointed wow you you saying that to me where did that came from praise the lord he thought somebody else was in the room when she spoke amen so you see there's disappointment in love and sometimes when we are disappointed that's when we say some awful things praise the lord and let me tell you if it was not because of this message or because of christianity my life and you just disappointed because what you thought it was is not sure enough to be like that praise the lord so there's disappointment in love and that's when we express ourself and sometimes the more unpleasant way and sometimes the ways that are misunderstood but you see when it comes in line of scripture then when it comes in in line of god dealing with his children and if god is dealing with you and you get frustrated at god and you say some things you know uh uh i believe he just said on his throne and he smiled he says don't worry the same what you have just said you will understand what you have just said praise the lord he says on his throne and then he says well that i mean that whatever you are saying it might become a prophecy on your own life and uh and and and i believe that's the way it is through the scripture so while uh zappora is saying to uh moses you are a bloody hustler to me i don't i don't see that as as being of any insult i see there as being disappointed i see that of her being disappointed in moses because i would imagine in my mind that this boy moses being taught by his mother when he got down there to media and then he fell in love with this girl he told her everything there is no way that zepora would take a sharp stone to come to perform circumcision that moses never told her about circumcision so moses told her everything you know how he was born a special child he grew up in pharaoh house he's actually a he brought in all of the things that his mother told him he might have told his wife but to see that you can do all the talking and not the acting it disappoint when you say you are a christian and you brag to be christian and people cannot see the christian life it disappointing and then that's the reason why people say things about christians because you have lived a disappointing life you can only do the talk but not live the life moses has talked about you know uh uh being the special race of people you know uh circumcised the eighth day and he have done all of this and yet zepora was disappointed it was an expression of disappointment you are a bloody husband to me praise the lord and every time you feel disappointed in god that's what you say is to him you are a bloody husband every time you complain that's what you say to him you are a bloody hustler we will get to death praise the lord amen i guess you say god forbid i never say that he said no i won't say that to god praise the lord but that's what you say every time you complain praise the lord shall we stop the service and just repent praise the lord disappointment in love and we feel disappointed we've been serving god and it looks like our life is now changing and and i mean we're just going through one trouble and and to another trouble oh my goodness by christian alive and and you know what but you know we complained we cried and we say try we still trust that maybe god you know we'll fee uh uh he would think about us soon a situation around our life would change and praise the lord amen now sword as we as we look into this subject together trusting that the lord will will be able to help us here we let's let's uh we'll talk a little bit about this uh uh covenant of circumcision and this whole thing with uh with zipporah uh uh being part of it we have to know that the old testament expresses god's mind the purpose of the old testament like paul says in the book of hebrew the shadow of good things to come it expresses god's mind because no man can fulfill the law so the lord was given to express what was in god's mind and grace will get a people that will fulfill what was in god's mind because a word is a taught express so the old testament was the taught the new testament was the word express praise the lord so there are a lot of things in the old testament you read in the old testament and god says the people mad then god says this and god says this those things were just lay out just to bring what was in the back part of god's mind praise the lord now if by the law nor man is justified then why was the lord giving them if no man was justified by the lord then what was the lord giving the lord was given to express what was in god's mind praise the lord amen question answers how many remember the story now god gave abraham generation before moses the sign of circumcision and that was the confidence that god made that every jewel should be second size is that right every man that was a sign and we are circumcised today with the holy ghost not the flesh amen praise the lord now god gave this commanding you see he spoke about the the the sign of circumcision which was his thought then in the book of galician paul pick up the same thing and made us to know that that sign of circumcision was actually intended to cut the same nature away from our life it was to cut the same nature away it was to curse the same nature that's what god was aiming on he was not just aiming any other flesh because there's nothing good in the flesh nothing of the flesh pleases god what god was aiming at was to divorce you from sin was to cut you away from sin the second season of the heart and now god gave his commandment and every male must be second size and god when he called moses to go down and deliver the children of israel moses having performed on his son they're very delivering sign that's what second season was it was the delivering sign a sign that you have been delivered from the power of darkness circumcision was the delivering sign unless you are born again second size of the holy ghost you have got to be i don't and when god spoke to moses go back to genesis and read that he says every male that is born in your house must it was a must must be second size when jesus spoke in john chapter 3 he said you must be born again just like the sign of circumcision was a mass that's how the new birth is a must praise the lord so second season in the new birth is the same to the new testament church unless you are born again circumcised by the holy ghost not just identifying with a church but second size of the holy ghost you have got to be i don't care how good you are what church you belong to how good your parents was except you as an individual has been born again by the holy ghost you will never go in the rapture you will never go in a rapture there is no body change for you because you are not cut away from sin you are not caught away you are not sacrificed from the same nature there is no body change you can practice not to lie practice not to sleep dress decent but there will be no body change no nature change until you are born again circumcised from the heart amen praise the lord if you take the born again subject just to be uh uh just to be uh your identity praise the lord i was called to a situation some time ago a family situation and and uh the relative for this person was was talking to them is i mean you know talking to them and says well i mean you say you are born again you know and and because the person has got themselves into a habit you know uh uh claiming to be born again because they were wearing dress and skirt but they were still struggling under drinking alcohol and it was ruining their life you know and and he says well you said you were born again you know i said yeah how much when you tell people you are born again how much are they expecting from you they know your whole life and they are watching to see the new and when you keep doing those things you are disappointing them unless you are born again circumcised by the holy ghost you have got to be i don't care how good you are what church you belong to how good your parents were except you as an individual you as an individual has been born again by the holy ghost you will never go in the rapture you think about it think about the foolish virgins that are living in sanctify life you think about it then how much more we that caught ourselves bride you will never go in the rapture see you can go that's the very delivery sign circumcision is a delivering sign it's a sign that you have been delivered from darkness from sin from evil from every power of darkness that holy ghost have circumcised you in your heart you struggle with things in your mind yes you do but he takes the will he takes the willpower the way that's the delivering sign you can say i'm delivered that's the very deliberate sign the second season and the second season is by the holy spirit praise the lord amen god was after moses and zipporah was the only one that saved him from that the only one this was a medium woman she was not a hebrew girl she was not born in the message like many of you are praise the lord glory be to god i didn't hear no amen so i thank brother jordan message got home praise the lord and zappora was the only one that saved him from there for the poorer god uh the sharp rock and went and cut the full skin off of her baby and threw it before moses and said thou are a bloody hustler to me oh is that right and god who have taught moses life god who have taught moses life what a paradox he have just given him a wonderful supernatural experience just in the presence of the pillow of fire just you have just experienced god in a supernatural way praise the lord sometimes we want to take one experience of our life i experienced god i went to a revival i went to a crusade i went to a convention and i experienced god and you take that as a badge he had just experienced god god has just given him a commission but all of that meant nothing to god if the covenant was not kept god was going to kill him praise the lord god will have taught moses life but perhaps an angel was standing there said it's poorer said and she catch it quick and she cashed a quake and the poorer went and second-sized the baby and said moses you are so concerned about everything yes and about your journey that your own boy hasn't been sacrificed praise the lord amen i just wanna a lot of times sometimes i've met people that said oh glory be to god the lord wanted me to do a certain thing and the lord wanted me to go to africa and india and all of these places i said have you ever asked the mailman if he's safe we want to save the whole world for god praise the lord amen that's why smith wigal will told his daughter husband one time he says you know talk to the daughter and the husband what they were they were doing missions and all of that he says well and all you people i enjoy missionary work y'all want to save the world he says but don't allow my grandchildren to be lost save the world for jesus don't send my grandchildren to hell that was smith wigal he had a strange word of talking hey amen praise the lord are we together amen israel in the church number two and there you are going down to egypt and now watch how neglectful a man can get what do you know there or not that's the second nature of a man neglectful you can come to my office and let us discuss it after church but that's the second nature of a man why because science proved a man's mind is completely different a woman she can multitask her mind goes all over the place when a man gets something on his mind that's where his mind is until he get it done he's just everything he pulls everything into that he's a shooter he just pulled everything into that so because of what is on his mind men are very neglectful that's the way he's built not intentionally but most of the time when a man gets something on his mind that's where his mind is praise the lord the woman mind is all over the place she can think on this and think on this the the the the chicken is frying and the clothes i mean amazing that's why when a woman becomes neglectful it's dangerous the house is going to burn down praise the lord it's dangerous when a woman becomes neglectful now watch how therefore the man gets in the end god met him down there in the end and who has slayed him as a poor wayne and took a short ride and circumcised her two children with a sharp rod and true the force came before moses and said you are a bloody husband to me only save moses life what was moses doing what was he doing moses got in such a hustle and the basel of the day till he was in such a place to go down there he forget the seal of circumcision he had egypt on his mind he has egypt on his mind praise the lord amen glory be to god let's do a little bit of reading and we can study together here amen and that's word we are today that's word the holy holiness church is feeling we have got so much time the lord has given us a lot of money we build a great big churches and we get good jobs and and and and big you know this and that uh uh protein plus speaks and and and packed pianos we don't have that but uh we we get a good building we have done a good job here amen it's so easy for us to settle down amen it's so easy for us to make this our home in glory when we are still on earth you cannot make a home in glory on earth praise the lord i don't care how much the lord have blessed you you cannot make a home in glory on earth that's the reason why you don't settle down you don't become complacent because you'll be making a home in glory on earth until we get to glory let the home in glory wait for us today until we have forgot the seal of god which is the baptism of the holy ghost the church must never never leave that we must never lay down the baptising of the holy ghost because that is the dynamics of the church that's the thing that will get us from here that's the thing that will change our body is the baptism of the holy ghost praise the lord amen god send us as the poorer oh wow i thought god should send us a prophet [Music] i thought god should send us a prophet people the prophet supposed to be saying god send us a prophet he says send us a deporter a bride church that will rise up and take the world back to the commission a brown church that will rise up and pick up the prophet's word i thought he was supposed to say god sent us a prophet god sent us as a poorer that's right second season every meal in egypt or of israel that wasn't circumcised was cut off god says i will cut you off praise the lord he says i will cut you off i was listening to to a preacher and he said something i giggled in a in a life i says oh my goodness i just like the way he said it you know he says he says the people are already lost what are you afraid of praise the lord why are you afraid what are you afraid to testify to them that well maybe i might not say they are already lost amen this is already lost he said a person that is sick why are you afraid to pray for them they are already sick your prayer is not going to make the animals sick your prayer could just change the atmosphere for them and bring them out of sickness to healing i say oh my goodness oh my goodness praise the lord amen glory be to god a circumcision was the seal of the promise and circumcision of the old testament is the baptism of the holy ghost of the new and every man outside of the bastard baptism of the holy ghost will be cut off there you are and god be merciful it's not just only membership it's not it's not what we think that we are doing for god is what god has done in you that's what he looks at that's what he will accept what he has done in you it's not what we in our effort trying to do for god men want to appease god and stay in their sinful nature amen they want to find a sunday morning where they can go to church and praise god and and you know and give give a little dollar of five you saw in in in the plating and they just feel good they can we got their shoulder they have done their religion you know uh because i i i pay my offering you know i pay my tithe is what is what god have done in you praise the lord don't worry the preacher coming next week he will preach easter for you i'm just i'm just praise the lord faith is what you have in god and that in recognition of faith or in recognition of god for your faith give you the holy ghost that circumcised your heart and your ears praise the lord is that right make you a new creature now god's getting ready to deliver we find out that he was moses was taking his son down for to deliver the children of israel on second size how and the poorest took a sharp stone cut off the full skin of her of her child and truly before him said thou are a bloody horseman listen here you know did you ever steady that real close that's what i want for us to do this morning i want for us to study that real close there are there are few things in place that i want us to look at really close why this was a meeting woman she was not she was not a hebrew why didn't the angel of the lord spoke to moses and says look moses don't be foolish go and circumcise your son but it's the plan of redemption it's the plane of redemption sir is this the time you listen to brother brahm talking about all of those dreams and vision that comes about the opening of the seals yet god had to give sisters dreams that were all part of faith because that's god's body he creates a man male and female in his image his image is both male and female so if moses was the deliverer if he was a type of christ then he needed to have a gentile bride that would put importance on the coveting that will not just come in to be a wife just to take on a name and dress and be walking before the congregation and moses wife but one that will put importance on the covenant you have to realize that if it was not because of the poorer there will not be a deliverer because god was going to kill him that's what the bible says there had to be a woman that was standing in the gap there had to be a wife that took on the ministry of intercession she had to step in the bridge praise the lord i believe with all my heart we get across there brother branham is going to give us a great big hug and say you got the message because after i left the people needed to be in power not just to raise up a prophet he did his work and he's gone this is our time this is our day [Music] and that's the way we show our appreciation to him that's how you appreciate somebody when you take on your responsibility it's not wanting the person to do everything what's the sense of appreciation let's study that real close moses had a temple you know that finally kept him out of the promised land his temple and god has set him back out there and gave him a little high tempo a little bit of tempo more than his a little bit tempo more than his a high tempo wife too praise the lord look that's the way god designed it your nature will draw your wife whether you like it or not you can go through all the facebook page look through all the picture your nature will draw your wife or your husband because the person that god would give you he gives you that person to be able to deal with things in your life that the pulpit cannot take your parents have tried from the time they were bringing you up the preacher comes and try god we have to stick somebody right beside your side to get that thing out of your life that's what marish is designed for praise the lord amen so you better start appreciating your husband and wife amen more than the preacher don't love me more than your husband i said don't love me more than your husband i'm not saying that out of flattery and i'm saying it because i'm serious i get back to preaching praise the lord that's what marriage is i don't know what you think it is but that's the way god designed it that's how he designed it that's how he designed it you're looking for future you're looking for face and the white teeth and everything but the mystery of marriage is that your nature your nature will attract the person that would be your husband or your wife so god gave him a woman that was a little high tempo two i bet they had some trouble at the back side of the desert the bible recorded one for us you are a bloody hustler to me but yet it please god to put that in this world because that has become a prophecy for the bride of jesus christ because christ became a bloody hospital for you a please god to take the poorer frustration because it was a prophecy genesis chapter 16 sarah told abraham well i'm getting oh you take mine now uh uh uh hey get here very nice egyptian girl maybe she can have a child this house is too quiet we've kept waiting for this promise over and over hagar got conceived in and her attitude changed and she started misbehaving and one day sarah said to abraham my wrong be on thee my wrong be on thee praise the lord because he became sin for me that i might be his very righteousness that's what make the bible the bible because it's a book of inspiration go voice the voice of god is through the pages the voice of god is through the pages praise the lord we have a five o'clock appointment tonight so let me know take all of your time praise the lord god gave me my wife that was a little high tempo i bet they have some trouble at the back side of the desert don't you god knows how to tame you he knows how to tame you he knows if you don't submit to the word now he knows how to tame you praise the lord i can't say any more than that because he knows i don't want to speculate how he's going to tame you i don't want to guess he knows how to team you so he fixed him out there with a little woman show she cut the foreskin off and threw it before him and said you are a bloody husband to me mine he knows how to fix him he knows how to fix you praise the lord he knows how to fix you praise the lord if my ministry can help you god knows where to take you he might just make you feel a little disappointed in me and then you can move to another church praise the lord he knows how to fix us praise the lord amen do you know that the poor she was so important so important until when mira moses elderly sister will speak against her god would come to her defense because if there was not a zipper there would not be an exeter that's how much importance she had that god came to her defense and struck miriam with leprosy because she opened her mouth against the woman that revived the coveting just before the accident praise the lord and there we find one thing out we find out that even mary and the prophetess aaron the high priest made fun of moses wife because she was an egyptian and ethiopian and todd wasn't there enough women out there group to marry instead of going down there and admiring that woman that wasn't moses choice that was god's choice for moses praise the lord amen and when he made fun of faith that angered god in such a way until he struck mira and the prophetess full of leprosy moses own sister what about that amen what about there it displeased god that was such a place that she hauled she did not even know about it but she was honored prophecy she was honored prophecy she was under inspiration that even please god i mean when she said that you become a bloody hospital is so please god because that was what was in his mind he was going to be a bloody hustler for his bride so she said the right word even though she was frustrated she was disappointed the same way with sarah sarah was disappointed never thought that this egyptian gear that was so lawyer would be disrespectful she said my wrong be on day so quick she said it just like when david said never cried it says my god my god why have thou forsaken me he was praying but just those words please god and he captured it just those words please god and sometimes when you are frustrated and you are just so confused and you are down low i mean when you are really pouring out your heart to god and crying there are things you say not those prayers that you channel in your mind and looking for your adverb and noun and no no no the one when you are pouring out and you are crying they are things you say they please god she say my wrong be on dead glory be to god amen oh my that's the same way that adam became a bloody husband because of eve praise the lord he became a bloody hustler when god came down in the garden of eden he called adam adam where are you praise the lord and we know how to adam hate himself and and god sought him with a bleeding skin killing animal at the east side of eden and and had a bleeding skin in his hands praise the lord and he dress out of me in that bleeding skin praise the lord and i believe i don't have god to dress his wife in a sheepskin also but he became a bloody hustler onto eve oh my goodness praise the lord as we go into this easter you have to remember christ became a bloody hussman unto you praise the lord you have to remember he became a bloody husband they pulled fresh tongs into his car into his car read isaiah and see how isaiah described his death they pulled his beard he was bleeding he became a bloody husband for you praise the lord but that was what a talk to raise sin out of our life the cruelty of sin and the penalty and what it cost god what it caused god to deal with sin in our lives that we will have pleasure in sin that we will take our pleasure in sin when our pleasure should be in the lord praise the lord it became a bloody hustle for you that's the importance of easter that's the importance of the gospel that's what this gospel must be preached to read sin out of people life praise the lord that's that's the importance of faith we cannot preach uh uh uh uh prosperitating you know and in all of that i mean prosperity that this is the prosperity gospel this is the truth prosperity when god can raise sin out of our life then even the least that we have we will be content with it and then we will prosper because we have peace of mind we would not be in vain and and jealousy and and just being better in our spirit when god raised sin out of our life so the coveting of circumcision was very important very important i was reading something it's it's it was kind of so amazing it's so amazing oh my goodness the word of god is so it's so wonderful it's so it's so perfect praise the lord amen as i was telling this i i realized i came across this i never knew this until until i got exposed to studying this and do you know there is a vitamin k and and the vitamin k had to do with blood clock and as i was looking at that standing there i just i just kind of pulled some few notes here many people don't even realize that newborn receive vitamin k shots at birth even though it's been uh recommended by the american academy of pediatrics since 1961. okay it goes into that it goes into uh what the name from i mean a a german name but it was so amazing it was so amazing that if you look at this oh i think i left i love a portion of my mind uh oh man oh man yeah i mean that's that is the part of faith where you get excited and then you think you got it down and you didn't get it down but this this is what uh this is what the report says that brings me into dates it's so amazing that the vitamin k is giving is giving to to uh to children and i call into signs or according to the medical report is giving to children after one week it should be given to them from one week to about uh 12 weeks or so they should have k shot but even most especially in the mail why because after a week a calling to medical signs in the mail that's when the blood flow starts and it can shoot so high that the child can get blood in their brain praise the lord amen so while uh they they give the kids this ver i mean this this vitamin to be able to control the the blood flow but you think about it amen that god required the covenant of circumcision on the eighth day because after a week the male child gets to the peak of blood flowing and that child could bleed and bleed and bleed and bleed so do you know that even in in in the jews they started doing second season on the seventh day which of course it was the sabbath day glory be to god oh i just love the lord because his word is so wonderful oh my amen amen amen praise the lord amen are we together amen glory be to god let's look as in john chapter 7. see john chapter 7. see john chapter seven now it's in john chapter seven if you remember the story here these jews came down here then and they're they're trying to trying to talk to jesus and condemn him for doing things on the sabbath day praise the lord amen jesus yet in verse 16 jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me if any man will do my well he shall know of the doctrine whether he be of god or whether i speak of myself he that speaketh of himself speaking his own glory but he that that secret his glory that sent him the same is truth and no unrighteousness is him they did not moses gave you the lord and yet none of you keep at the law why go ye about to kill me the people answered and said that has a devil who god about to kill thee jesus answered and said unto them i have i've done one work and here are marvel moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it was of moses but of the fathers from abraham and you in a year on the sabbath day circumcised amen praise the lord now remember they were not to do no work on the sabbath but to show how the covenant of circumcision was more than the sabbath to show how they esteemed the covenant of circumcision how they respected the covenant of circumcision because they know if they miss the if they they have breaking the lord of god they would rather do it on the sabbath day are we together they would rather do it on the sabbath day and yet jesus come healing the man on the sabbath day and they're having problems you can just see where people's minds are here he come doing the work of god on the sabbath day praise the lord are we together every man on the sabbath day receives circumcision that the lord of moses should not be broken and yeah angry i mean because i have made a man every way hold on the sabbath day george not according to appearance but george righteous judgment if you on the sabbath day you will circumcise a man to keep the lord of moses when the very law says you must not do no work on the sabbath day you see and when you bring it to the cree to the to the christian church i want to you know kind of a girl go against any group here but you bring it to the christian church you look at the sabbath and you look at the resurrection why do we gather while the electrician you have to realize that this man peter james and john and all of these men they were all jews they all went to church on the sabbath bank why did they choose then sunday why did they choose the first day of the week why because of what the resurrection means to the christian church the resurrection of jesus christ goes above the sabbath the resurrection bring rest to the believer praise the lord that's why the early christians started to meet on sunday morning it was because of the emphasis of the resurrection praise the lord amen hear these people that we keep the commandments of moses but yet on the sabbath day praise the lord amen is is just also like what uh uh the muslim does according to their commandment it was they are supposed to fast just under one day it's just supposed to be a one day but now they don't want to miss the one day so they fast the whole month praise the lord we don't we don't want to be in the wrong so let's start from the first of the month to the end of the month when man brings his own ideas praise the lord they will tell you they are first supposed to be one day but because they don't want to miss that day [Music] so they got to fast the whole month praise the lord if god required the 15 to be the day of us and you start the first god is angry with you why are you doing it at first the second he's angry with you they tell he's angry with you before you get to the 15th his anger has gone so high that's what man's religion will do to you praise the lord amen glory be to god amen are we together that's how much the covenant was important praise the lord you see medical science actually came to to this discovery in 1894 of vitamin k that's when it came to that discovery and uh they started working on trying to control the blood flow in children from that time but even right from the beginning god gave that to abraham praise the lord amen and i saw we see here that there's a woman here they have got a revelation a woman that was whispered to a bobby angel glory be to god amen same angel that met her husband in a burning bush now that angel has come as a whispering verse at the back of the puppet and says zepora catch the vision praise the lord that same angel that met him in the brainy butch you see how god works he kept all of this because he wanted to include the woman into the redemption he wanted to include her because she had work to do to be part of the accident even though she's a gentile woman but this is a hussman and when god called a man god called the wife so he talked to moses and he prepared him and and and give him a sign throw the stick down he pick it up it turned back to serpent and moses says oh put your hand there you get i giving you two son moses i mean his whole body is ginger i'm going down there to egypt oh my goodness and and i mean he's going down and telling all his neighbors i'll see you i'm i'm leaving when i meet his father i have to go back i got to go and see my he he's so excited about what he have just experienced he's being decided to die he's being decided to die and that's what happens when we come to church and enjoy the word of god and enjoy the presence of god all the service was great god is watching to see if you put that word in action [Music] not to leave church and then go right back into the symbol of things that we are doing displeasing god hurting the heart of god when he's bringing his word service after service bringing you the sign of deliverance he wanted to include her into the redemption so he kept that for her the angel never spoke to moses the angel was about to kill him the same angel that was standing to kill him the same angel two back and since he poured you go and do it oh my goodness i feel like kicking my shoes off my feet i'm afraid that i will break brother jordan's light oh my goodness i feel like kicking my shoes off my feet just opening this door and running out glory be to god and leave the service to you amen the same angel that brought the opening of the seal the same angel that brought this message to brother branham that same angel this year with a fight for ministry to open this world to you and deliver you the same angel praise the lord why because he has become a bloody husband to us he has become a bloody husband to us the same angel praise the lord we get so common to it we think we have the tapes we think we can get down there and find the cult and we can fight in our minds we have enough code to send ourselves to hell when god will send his word he sent his word and his word deliver us because he has become a bloody husband on the right hand of the father making an intercession for you and myself that's what eastside is about praise the lord we can say like sarah my wrong be on thee lord you know how he will answer he will see my righteousness be on you he will see my righteousness be on you and then you are struggling there because the devil is beating your minds instead of letting your wrong go on him you are struggling dead in your mind no i'm not right yet i need to do this i need to do that and i need to do this and god have so much of a hard time because people want to save god in the flesh then serving god by faith accepting his promised word accepting his promised word being obedient to his promised word and walking by faith we want to serve god in the flesh and we fail and oh my the devil is a slave driver and as soon as you feel he can take the whip and whip you with condemnation praise the lord until it's difficult to be able to receive god's mercy my wrong be on the lord and i take your righteousness praise the lord musicians you can come he became me that am i [Music] he became [Music] oh hallelujah

father thank you jesus [Music] my place you think about it this morning before we pray for you ever imagine in your mind of moses whoever get angry was the poorer over those words knowing that those were the very words that saved him [Music] i believe when moses and the poor travel in their life journey every time they think about that they just laugh how can you be angry how can you be angry how could moses ever be angry knowing that the very words that zapporo said to him was the words that save his life how could your wife ever gets angry when her husband says you are a foolish woman knowing that that was the very same words that brought her back to her senses and then sometimes we sit in the church the preacher will just say something little and then you take an attitude because you think he's talking to you [Music] he became i thank you lord my grace true who take your that place might become you by grace oh father lord jesus [Music] lord jesus you became a bloody husband oh
