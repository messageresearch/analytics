a while now praise the Lord but hopefully you can hear me praise the Lord yes so um the Bible says where two or three are gathered in his name there he is so the Lord is here praise the Lord I welcome everyone of you and everyone that is following online uh you're all warmly welcome to the service tonight so uh yesterday I spoke with brother one he's gone for the meetings so uh he hopes to be back by the weekend because uh this coming Sunday is Mother's Day yes so uh hopefully we'll see him uh Sunday morning and um keep praying for him and praying for the services uh over there um I would like to thank the church for the prayer offered for my friend uh she is gone to be with the Lord to God be the glory this is from Sister fat two so the sister we prayed for who was given 48 hours to leave and she decided enough was enough and decided not to eat and didn't need any more attention um she passed um what was that I think after almost a week I think it was on Monday Tuesday or so yes so she's going to be with the Lord and God bless you all for your prayers Shalom saints of God I gave God the glory and the praise for adding another year to my age yesterday was my birthday I also give God the praise for safe delivery of my sister from sis Nancy happy birthday birthday [Applause] girl praise the Lord how many are ready to hear from the Lord tonight praise God if you have come to hear from God you would hear the voice of God the voice of God is the word of God and you would hear the word and you know that this word is bearing your name tag on it you know that it is for you it's a very sad thing that you come to the house of God and you live the same way you came in as a matter of fact if you don't live the presence of God better than you came then you left worse than than you came you must receive something from God that is why we have to pay attention to the word when some are shouting praise the Lord hallelujah maybe it is not your turn yet when you are seated and nothing is knocking at the door of your heart that is not the time to take take your phone and start flipping through that is the time to pay more attention because God is meeting some people's needs and it is soon going to be your turn you don't know when your turn is going to be so if you are not paying attention the holy spirit will just come and just pass you by and then you leave church you said why did I even go to church praise the Lord God bless you all for coming tonight and um there are something something a few things the lord has laid on my heart and I would want us to look at them praise the Lord um if we can stand for the reading of the word and then turn to our turn our Bibles [Music] to Philippians 2 Philippians 2 Philippians 25-10 okay Philippians 2 5-10 I read let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him a form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death on the cross wherefore God also have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven of things in Earth and things under the Earth shall we pray our Lord and our savior Jesus we thank you so much oh God for tonight father we have driven both far and near to come into your presence Lord we have not come to hear the voice of a man we have not come to hear the enticing voice of wisdom father oh God from a man but we have come because we know that you will speak to us tonight many of us have various burdens on our hearts many of us are going through trials and temptations of various kinds father there are things we are dealing with in our lives only you know about them and father we are here father oh God that you may encourage us tonight Lord that in spite of the storms we can say it Is Well with My Soul it doesn't matter what we are going through we can say it Is Well with My Soul it doesn't matter whether we have it or not we can say it Is Well with My Soul that we can look C our problems in the face and say it Is Well with My Soul praise be to God we just thank you and we bless you tonight father we give you the glory Lord and we exalt your Holy Name tonight and we pray the dear Lord Jesus that you will come and take complete control over tonight's service and Minister unto us from lip to ear in the name of Jesus we also take this opportunity father to remember your seven brother one Lord for all the meetings father oh God in um don't remember exactly where he's gone um is just escaped me but father may you be with him be with the congregation be with the with the Servants of God that have gathered father oh god father to Avail themselves and to be a blessing father during the course of the meetings that aree of them Father your children have gathered there because they also have needs because they are also going trials and tribulations of one kind or the other and father we pray oh God committing your servant into thine hands that you will give him Grace and give him Grant him utterance father let him be a blessing father to the to to your children in any way it pleases thee we just thank you and we glorify you tonight father in Jesus name we want to also thank you for having added another year to Sis nany's age father we all have come this far by your grace we want to thank you for your grace upon her life and we pray that you give her many more years to see in Jesus name amen shall we be seated praise the Lord I woke up quite early this morning at about 3:50 I was up normally I would wake up around 4:30 uh either I wake up before my alarm or my alarm wakes me up but I was up at 3:50 and I said I wasn't going to bed I would just get ready and go to work and while I was getting ready it just from nowhere I believe it was the Lord who took my mind to a fireplace and I am talking of a gas fireplace I'm not talking of those fancy electrical fireplace no or the wooden one where you have to get things working no I am talking of a gas fireplace and what about a gas fireplace that you can move into a house or into a home or into an apartment with a fireplace and never turn it on till the time you leave or till the time you lease is over and what is special about it for those of you who have a gas fireplace when you go home when you sit at a distance you will not see fire there you can go and touch the glass you will not feel any burning sensation no heat but look further you will see something we call pilot light that there is always fire in there there is always at every given time when you look very very close you will see fire burning but you will never get that flame it is never going to produce heat you will never notice it but it has always been there praise the Lord and now the whole system is connected to the gas line that all you the inhabitant or the occupant of the house have to do is to flip the switch on and then you hear that sound boom and then there is light and then you you see it burning and then very soon the whole place is hot you can't even touch the glass anymore but until you do that that fire will always be there connected to the gas 24/7 and yet you will never have heat if that is what you are using as your source of heat you will never see the flame and then it struck me that that is how some of us are before you moved into that house that house had already been built with that inside there you didn't have to do anything about it all you had to do is just flip it on and off that God by his Divine wisdom has placed his seed in you he has placed his seed in you that seed of light it is there they can Heap all the sin of the world on you bury you under the weight of every it would never switch it off it is there and as small as it is as small as it is the whole of Heaven is connected to it that you just have to be so conscious enough to know that if I turn on the switch I am going to have a Revival sometimes we think having a Revival is 10 20 30 churches coming together and you have thousand 2,000 people and there is no that is good it's fine we love it but if you can go in a meeting like that and still be the same after all is said and done then what is the Revival you can have a personal Revival with God that you can tap into into into into into God and get so w up by the Holy Spirit and you know that this is God at work and that it is not of men we carry that gem seed of life that fire in us it is there and we are not conscious of it and we just live anyhow a life of Darkness we don't even know where we belong we don't know whether we are going or we are coming we don't know who we are and all all we have to do is just turn the switch on I didn't know it was even connected to what I was going to say today but it happens to be to be in sync the theme of this message tonight is the weight of your confession the weight of your confession so just think about it a man or a woman that is carrying that seed of God in them and yet you look at their lives and you can't see it when you confess the Lord as your savior does it carry any any weight when you say the days of Miracles are not over does it carry any weight when you say a man can live a clean and a holy life does it carry any weight when you say you have believed does it carry any weight praise the Lord now the weight of your confession has nothing to do with what you confess it has nothing to do with what you see praise the Lord the disciple of the Lord Jesus in Antioch when the people looked at them their manner of dressing their word of talking the way they demonstrated the power of God healing the sick and demonstrating the power of God in holy living they looked at them and they said these are Christians in other words these are Christlike just by looking at their lives not at what they were saying but by looking at their lives they could say that these are Christlike they are Christians praise the Lord they had the Life of Christ flowing through their veins the Bible says let this mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus you can't have the life of God or the Life of Christ without having the mind of God it doesn't work that way you can't have the Life of Christ without having the mind of Christ you can't have the mind of Christ and have the mind of the world at the same time the prophet speaking you can't be in your way and God's way at the same time it's either one or the other it's like serving two masters you can't serve two masters if the mind of Christ be in you then you will think like Christ and you need the mind of Christ to serve God you can't approach god with your human mind it is highly impossible to approach god with your human elements with your human mind that would only bring you to a place where you perform a religion okay you just perform your religion just do what you think you have to do not what the word requires of you and it's such a dangerous place to be when a man knows just too much to be religious that is a very dangerous place to ever be the mind of Christ in you will make you thirst for Holiness it will make you thir after God it will make you crave for the things of God it will num your desire for sin it will let you thirst and hunger for righteousness the mind of God in you would never bring you to a place to look at the world and seek after the world all your heart desire it's about the T of God you don't wander around and there is no wind of doctrine that can come and just blow you off because you are grounded in the word praise the Lord without the mind of Christ you have nothing to show for your Christian Life it's just you without the mind of Christ is just you remember we are talking about the weight of your confession praise the Lord now I wouldn't mention the name of that country but there was a country that is a country are are somewhere let me leave that country alone the president or should I say the head of state because he was a military Soldier he was he was a military person he told the Central Bank Governor to print more money because money was had to come by and the Central Bank Governor said no I can't do it he Wonder with his with with his people he said you have to print more money he said no and his men sees that governor and that was the end the world that was the last time the world ever heard of him nobody ever traced the whereabouts of that Governor that was his end and the pred the money anyhow and there was so manyy so much money in the economy and the money was as useless as useless as the trash beg you can find by the roadside a country can decide to turn on the money printing machines but if they don't have gold in their Reserve to back that money up is going to be just a little valuable than the ordinary paper you see because they don't have gold in their reserves to back it up and that is how sometimes our confessions are that we make the confessions and yet there is no life to back it up it is not so much about what you say we make the confessions all right but there is nothing that is backing it up you can look at your life and if you are that Earnest or if you are sincere you can say that oh there is a missing link somewhere and praise be to God if you can come to a place to see it that is if it exists in your life then it gives you room or the opportunity to change the Jus then you know that something must must be done praise the Lord the Bible says let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and give the glory to your father which is in heaven that has to do with your life know so much about the things you say praise the Lord it is very very important that when you say something the person you are talking to should be able to see it in you they shouldn't try to sit and imagine what is this man talking about what is this sister talking about but they should be able to look at your life and then put it together that this thing this man is talking about this thing this sister is talking about I can see it in them the weight of your confession is the life you are living is the life you are living we are not living to please any man and sometimes we get to a place in our lives and we fear men more than we fear God that we we get to a place and we look across our shoulders to see who is there before we do what we want to do if you ever get to a place in your life and you have to look across your shoulders to look behind you to see whether there are any known faces whatever it is that you want to do it wouldn't end well don't do it don't do it if you a child of God you are not a child of God in secret you don't live a secret life your life is an open book your life is public people can look at you and see Christ in you but if they can look at you and not see Christ Lord have mercy they can say anything they want to say about you but when it comes to you and your God they will say but that sister is a Christian but that brother is a Christian praise the Lord what is the weight of your confession there was an auction now I have been in a lot of auctions way back in Africa where you go and they will sell everything nothing goes back including scraps those metal plates they look so useless if they were by the roadside you would not pick them but in an auction they are going to sell out they will just start from the low the lowest price $5 and this one say I give $10 this one will say oh 20 this say 30 and then when you hear going one going twice that means they ready to close that auction until somebody brings something higher you will hear sold and when they say sold you can bring 100 times the price it is sold but there was an option this auction here was not like any other auction and it was an auction of prisoners on death row that every year this Kingdom would bring one prisoner that was on a death row to be redeemed and then you have some rich people come around the clergy and they come around and that auction doesn't start from the lowest price and goes up no it starts from the top and guess who the auctioneer is the auctioner is always the prosecutor and then he comes he doesn't tell you how good this thing is and and how beneficial it would be for you to have it but he is telling you this man is a hopeless man this man is a useless man this man has killed a whole city this man has impoverished people he must die nobody should redeem him that is all he's coming to do and this is the price tag 1 million there is nobody 500,000 nobody it keeps coming down then somebody says so yeah yes I give I give 100,000 and somebody says no 101 and then sold but one day they brought a prisoner and they put him there and all these redeemers gathered together and the persecutor came and the prosecutor said this man here Must Die he he was a drunk he was a robber he was fighting everywhere he is a meder and he listed all the crimes he belonged to a gang the most terrible gang everybody knew off and he said this man nobody has to release him if you release him he's going to go back to his old ways and you are going to pay the price and then he started 1 million 500 100 50 till he came to $1 nobody offered to buy him then he said okay if anybody needed him for free take him and the people looked into their face and said no this man must die he has been so so wicked we are not going to redeem him and then he knew that he had come to the weights his life's end and he was just looking ahead in his in in his in his Mind's Eye how he was going going to be hang on the ropes and before they could close the auction a Man from Nowhere walk in and interrupted the whole process he said I am going to buy this prisoner and everybody turned and looked at him this man is dangerous don't buy him is the reason nobody has bought him else wouldn't have met him here he said I am going to buy him there a prosecutor said you can't buy him he's a dangerous criminal he said I am going to buy him what is the price tag he said 1 million he said you know what I am going to offer 2 million for him and then he bought this man to the amazement of everybody and when he bought him everybody was saying this man is just a matter of time and he's going to go back to the street it's just a matter of time and we are going to hear of him again in the purpose so they were just looking when they buy their newspapers they were just looking forward to see something like that but when this rich man bought him he sat with him he said you know I have seen a lot of potential in you a potential you yourself do not know you have so do you know what I want you to go back to school he was a College Dropout he said yes I will go he went back to cut the long matter short after several years he came out as a lawyer as a lawyer the first time the public would get to hear of him again it was not in any arm robbery case it was not in any M case it was not in any criminal act but he was standing in the court to defend somebody because he said that he was given a second chance and that he was also going to give people a second chance he said everybody deserved a second chance he had it and he was going to pay it back and he was offering his Services free of charge praise the Lord now this is not the most important part of this story the most important part of the story was any time he came to court the same prosecutor that wanted him dead he will be standing there trying to get somebody in and this man is on the other side trying to get him out even though he knew what to say he was a brilliant lawyer he knew what to say it was not what he said that made the difference but he got to that place and he said look at my life once I was a thief but I still no more once I was a robber I robbed no more once I was a drunk I drink no more once I was a murderer I don't kill anymore I was given a second chance look at me this man standing here deserves a second chance there is something good that can come out of his life and the people look at him he say if this man we all read about if this man we all knew today is stand here clean probably cleaner than every one of us on the jury then it means that this other person deserves a second chance and he won every single case in court why because his confession was not an empty confession it was backed by the reality of his personal life that the people will look at him and they can't question it he didn't leave anybody in doubt so it is not so much about what you say but so much about the life you are living that when you tell somebody about Christ can they look at your life and see Christ in you when you tell them you have believed can they look at your life and see a believer in you when you tell them God is real and he is still in the business of changing lives can they look at you and see that God in you that those that have known you before and from the time you said you have believed can then look at you and see any change in your life or you are the same old person just carrying the name of Christ in vain or they can look at you and it's just not you saying something but they look at you and they can't deny that indeed there is something real about this God praise the Lord It's good to let people know who you are where you stand what you believe but after having said all that after having said all that what do you have to show do you have something to back it up that you can say look at my life once upon a time I was a wretch once upon a time I was a thief once upon a time I was so Troublesome I was a headache but look at me see what the power of God can do that they can look at your life and see that oh indeed this is not the same person we knew before the weight of your confession your confession has a lot of weight praise the Lord and when I look at the man when I look at this man here his life rings the bell you can look at yourself that once upon a time you and I were Bound for the slaughter we were deeply immersed in sin there was nothing we could do about it we had nowh to turn all we were just waiting is to die and go to heav H but God rich in Mercy Sent His only begotten son who came and died in our place that we would live he gave his life for you and I he paid the price for our freedom he paid the price you don't belong to you you are purchased by the blood you are the pures of his blood and like that rich man set that that prisoner free we are not bought and set free so we would go back into sin anymore sometimes your friends some times relatives sometimes those who know you when you give your life to Christ what do they say oh don't mind him don't mind him it's just a matter of time he'll be coming back into this ghetto we'll be smoking that pop together don't mind him and when you give your life to Christ and you are serving God they are there waiting to see you back like those people were there waiting to see that man to see him back in the newspapers because they knew to themselves that it was just a matter of time that and he was going to commit the next crime when you say you have given your life to Christ there are people who know you who are looking at you they are monitoring you they wouldn't tell you and they are just watching and they are telling telling themselves that this man is going to come back this woman is going to come back and look the worst thing you can ever do the worst thing you can ever do after you say you have believed after you say goodbye to the world and then you turn right back and go into the errors from which you were delivered from that is the worst thing you can do then they say ah but we said it we said it we said he was going to come back he has come back what else can you ever tell them but when you go and they are waiting to see you back and you never come back and all the see you is growing in Christ your life is transformed that you are a new Creation in God that your life has changed they look at you they Envy you sometimes they try to pull some strength to see if they can get you back and if that is not working guess what you are influencing their lives if there was anybody that was going to influence them to serve God it is you because they knew you before they knew who you were before they knew how far you have come and now they know that that God is real that if that God can do it for you he can do it for me also what is the weight of your confession with freedom comes responsibility we are bought and paid for by the blood we are free there is Liberty in the house of God we are a free people but with that freedom comes responsibility not recklessness you don't do something because you want to do it someone bought your [Music] Redemption you are now living to please him not you praise the Lord with freedom comes responsibility you don't desire your will anymore by the will of the father and when God has redeemed you he redeems you for one thing so you can serve him so you can serve him serve him in spirit and in truth in spirit and in truth can you set your heart tonight set your heart tonight and tell yourself in confidence that I am serving God in spirit and in truth can you if not what is holding you back what has been in your way what is the hindrance what are the obstacles what is holding you back and for how long would you continue to deal with that some of us have come come one year 2 years 5 years 10 years 15 20 30 40 50 but if in all your years of service you have not actually entered into that inner courts of God you have done yourself a disservice to him that much is given much shall be required I remember one time I was talking to Dan and Joshua that was in those days and I quoted this scripture and I could look at Dan's face and I was trying to read what I saw from his face it's difficult to read a human being do and it was like H if to him that much is given much shall be required then it was better I didn't even know too much he didn't say that but I could feel it so I just went on I said look you know more so much shall be required of you praise the Lord it was so heartwarming so refreshing when that rich man who redeemed The Prisoner saw that the prisoner just came out went to school got a law degree and was practicing and not only that but when he started offering his services to the people who needed it he had a Common Language he said they needed a second chance and that was the same mind that the rich man had that was the same mind he had the mind of the rich man who said this man needs a second chance after all his education when he came out he was defending the people and he had the same mind that these people need a second chance the most glorious thing that could ever be is you having the mind of God the mind of God that same mind of God how had woman that was to the rich man that he could look at this man and see himself in him and when God can just look down and see that you have his mind that you are just living by the word Nothing by the word that you have held the word of God in high esteem and that if it will cost you to turn your back on the word you prefer death and when you ever get there you are going to see God in the way you never dream and we saw that in the lives of M M shedra Cano when they were asked to Bow before the image they had so much regard for the word that they had the mind of God and they knew who they were and what they were supposed to do and they said no it's not something we are even going to think about God will deliver us and if he chooses not so be it we are going to die for it we saw that in the in in Daniel's life when he was casting the Lions then when you give yourself to the word and because you have given yourself to the word which you can never do except you have the mind of Christ in you you can never do it until you have the mind of Christ that would make you to conform to the holy ghost that would make you to conform to the word of God that would make you to give yourself to the word Fe on the word live by the word that you would exem the word of God more than your your daily bread tomorrow when the journey is over God is not going to ask you what work you did how much money you made how many mansions you had it's all good I'm not against that what did you do with my word what did did you do with my word and except you have the mind of God the word of God would not mean anything to you and except you have the mind of God your confession is going to be nothing but an empty confession because you will say something that you don't have the life to back it up that people look at you so don't mind him he's a hypocrite the things he's talking about it can never be done why because they have not seen it in you but if they see it in you there is no way they will say oh that thing cannot be done because they are seeing it you are an evidence that it is true give yourself to the world I am not saying that when you give yourself to the word of God things are going to be Rosy and dundy and nice and no that is probably when you are going to guess the worst time of your life but if it is because you have given yourself to the word just tell yourself it is SW with My Soul when you are going through the storms because you have believed God tell yourself It Is Well with My Soul if because you have turned away from sin and have decided to serve God in spirit and in truth and because of that things are not going well tell yourself It Is Well with My Soul the devil can come and tell you see see how all your friends are prospering see how impoverished you are that your God is not real you know better tell yourself It Is Well with My Soul the devil will tell you you probably went to your girls your friend's room to go and borrow toothpaste in order to be able to brush your teeth that morning tell yourself It Is Well with My Soul if God has to keep me there so I can be faithful if God has to keep me there to honor His holy name I rather be there and no other place and always remember if it's because you have been so faithful to God and you are are doing the will of God you are walking in the perfect will of God and then you get into trouble just hold your peace sometimes these storms come because God wants to do something greater in our lives he is already doing something but he wants to take you to another level a higher level and sometimes you are so busy a child of God that you don't even have time to seek the face of God and God brings these obstacles and the obstacle is so big maybe from the beginning he brought a small one and you jumped it and then he brought another Higher One you scaled it and then he brought another one you probably want to Lo for a ladder and you climbed and jumped over it then now he break you to a very big one big enough to engage your attention big enough that you have to call it a halt because God needs your attention praise the lord we have 4 minutes to go in the message 1951 faith is the substance paragraph 43 and if there is anybody that I didn't like why I would try to make it right with them and I try to be as sincere here and act like a Christian as much as I can be at my home or anywhere everywhere I go I've always tried to do what was right and try to leave what I speak about and talk about and I'd rather any man would leave me a sermon than preach me one for we are written Epistles read of all men I'd rather live right and have my name clear where my master could say why my master could say he's a Christian and the people say he's a Christian I don't know one thing I ever seen him do wrong pray praise be to God again in the message 1957 the lamb and the dve paragraph 13 now no matter how much you preach and got a real ill temper don't do you much good to preach see no matter how much you join church and try to to impersonate if you are crabbing and nasty with your neighbor you will never win him to Christ see is the fruit of the spirit as my wife used to tell me actions speak louder than words that's right leave me a sermon instead of preaching me one that's a good thing leave me a sermon instead of preaching me one if you have a sermon to preach the musicians can come over if you have a seron to preach to your neighbor your life is what does the work because that neighbor is looking at you day in day out as you are coming to church and going back they have their eyes on you sometimes you think they don't know about your movement when they are up there and they open their window they can tell exactly when you left home and exactly when you came back they know when you go to church and they know what happens in your home you probably wouldn't think about it if there is anything that is going to influence their lives it's not so much about you going to tell them God is real we have a a living God that is good God turn lives around God can change your life Christ died for us God has sent us a prophet oh that's wonderful but your life is what they are looking at your life is what does the [Music] preaching if what you are saying if what you are saying does not conform to the life you are living they look at you and they laugh at you they may not laugh at you in the face but they look at you and they laugh at you what is the weight of your confession as a Believer what's your what was the weight of your confession as a Christian what is the weight of your [Music] confession when you say God is real what is the weight of your confession when you are telling your neighbor or your coworker about Christ how much weight does it carry do they look at you as a as a Storyteller as somebody that is talking about something they don't know or they can look at your [Music] life and say something this one just came in somewhere last year or was it last two years I want to work and I was assign to go help somewhere I think I told that story before and I had this butcher knife very very long and sharp and it was iced [Music] meat slabs of meat that were so iced and they just came together so solid and I was trying to divide it and I used a knife I tried so you could imagine how much pressure I put on it and it just [Music] slipped God is so gracious the easiest place the knife could have gone was here because this was the way I held it but God be so good the knife just cut this middle finger and this finger here just took it off [Music] it took it off before I even realized it that when they called The First Responders and they came they looked at my finger and said no he's missing a piece of his finger and they had to go back to go and search for it that was how bad it was it was bleeding so bad they had to tie it it couldn't stop the bleeding they wanted to call I said no but that was okay I was fine and I was even cracking jokes with them and they were expecting me to be out of work for probably 2 3 weeks it happened on the Thursday so Friday I didn't go to work and then the weekends kicked in Monday I was back to work and then people came around oh done we didn't expect to see you we had you cut off your finger nobody expected to to see you they thought I was going to be in a bandage no I went like this they said oh and they looked at it they said ah but you not missing any finger we heard you are missing a part of your finger I said look at [Music] it everything was back but that is not the point the high point of the story somebody came and told them that if you serve that at Le God I want to quote him exactly praise the [Music] Lord you can get away with anything that if you are serving then God that if you have his God you can get away with anything and I think I said that and I used that as a as a team to preach aemon one time praise the Lord [Music] praise the Lord there is a lot God can do with you if you give him the [Music] chance there is a lot God can do with you if you only give him the chance [Music] those days where you tell you you tell yourself today I'm a Child of God tomorrow oh I am not those days should be over those days should be over if there is anything in your life that doesn't belong it is time to flash it [Music] out if there is anything in your your life that does not belong this is the time to deal with it head [Music] on it's not a time to run [Music] away from the [Music] reality of what we are going through face it head on deal with it if you are supposed to deal with [Music] it praise the Lord [Music] I want us to go before the Lord just talk to God tonight God is [Music] able there is no man that is a [Music] Superman when God comes into you he makes you a Superman if God can do it for a that means he can do it for B if God can do it for somebody that means God can do it for you you are a son and a daughter of God the devil cannot continue to take advantage of you put the devil where he belongs God is counting on you and me that if there was any confession that is effective it is your life it is your life the word of God becoming flesh in you that men can look at your life and see God in you there is no confession that is greater than that that they look at your life and they see God they look at your life and they see the wonders of God they see they look at your life and they see nothing but a miracle praise the [Music] Lord father we thank you so much for how far you have brought us tonight oh god father we came to hear from you and I believe with all my heart father that

women may see the light in us and give the glory to you that people will look at our lives and see Christ in us that will not say something and it to just appear as a fairy tale to the people that are
