just a wonderful time amen praise the lord and we greet you all this morning in the name of the lord jesus and uh good to see the grace of god on your faces and uh it's good to know that we have people that we can stand with and worship our king and and serve the lord god that praise the lord this morning we got a call that uh sister mimi is now feeling well she was rushed back to the hospital and uh it's pretty a little bit serious situation so we we we had the uh the deacons back there then into the office praying so we want to just keep our house before the lord that the lord will will be able to to bring our sister true amen praise the lord and the doctors i call into sister geraldine actually said that she might not be able to get through because of the situation there's a procedure that issue do on her body but her body is pretty weak for them to be able to carry out their procedures so and uh [Music] they asked whether they could pull the plugs and sister jordan said no and uh so uh uh that shows how serious the situation is but we serve almighty god that we have just sank about amen we suffered marty also we are believing this morning that god is in total control amen he's in complete control hallelujah amen and uh i mean if he please the lord to take her home we have another witness of one that was in our midst that have gone across amen so whichever way we are on the winning side but we are believing that the lord will be able to bring her truth praise the lord amen and uh yesterday we made a little comment here just at the end of the service and i want to read romans chapter 12 just to back up that that coming romans chapter 12 the apostle paul said i beset you therefore brethren by the mercy of god their year present your body a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto the lord which is your reasonable service reasonable service means that is the most that you can do so just like i said yesterday is is this this this uh uh phrase presents your body now you see uh uh all the bible says present your body the way we understand it is prepare your body no the bible says present your body make yourself available that's all god is saying you know make yourself available and [Music] you know so the more we we make ourselves available the more we present ourselves for worship the more we say lord yeah i am yeah i am i'm i'm just i'm just i'm just here i'm just here take me from here to the other side take me from here into the couch take me from here into your presence and take me from here into what you want to do what you want to achieve you know so uh [Music] there's uh that is as much as we can do i was i was going to forget about this there's another praise here god bless you church the lord has been so good to me and my family in the he granted me grace and a favor to finish my study in good health it wasn't always easy but as he said in his word he's my strength my son and he has given me victory that i would like to thank and appreciate the pastor and his wife the love care support to me thank also to you church i would not name all but the lord knows all your effort and your sacrifice thank you the lord

hand of [Music] thank you grace [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah you ready for the word this morning amen amen uh praise the lord what a good time we had last night praise the lord amen amen you know like paul says he says every joint supply that's how the body of god works that's our that's how our human body works so the the spiritual body works that way where every joint supply and uh [Music] you know the the preacher he prays and he he prepared himself then pretty soon he gets a burden that comes upon his heart in a form of a message he have it taught but he really don't have everything because he don't know you know how the service is going to go then he's trusting the lord and because of that he gets very nervous he gets very heavy and then he comes and and and then the people starts to pull the people starts to unload him everybody is reaching out and and taking something from the word and then after the service the preacher gets very tired of taking brother ajaya home yesterday last night and tried to get something for him to eat and and i'm talking about myself he fell asleep i look over i said oh my goodness this guy is tired praise the lord and and that's what what happened the preacher released the burden and now you take the burden home the word now becomes your burden you have to take it home you have to leave it you have to step into the victory the healing of that word it becomes your burden so uh so the lord gives it to the preacher and then he gives it to the people and then you take it out and then he leave it through us so uh we signed a song yesterday uh that was that was just the the first part of the song and we are the children of god uh let's see if we have uh uh the the south african words there and uh let's let's sing that a little bit let's tell the devil there before the word comes let that be our confession amen we are the children of god we came from god and we going right back to god praise the lord i [Music] [Applause] [Music] city [Applause] city [Music] city [Music] praise the lord did i make you nervous amen the words on the ball make you nervous amen well you see the thing about it that's the reason why the bible says no one should speak in tongues if there is not interpreter now so you already know the interpretation of what you are thinking it means we are the children of god that's that's what it means we are traveling to heaven we came from heaven we are going back so don't get nervous just sing it like the way you see it amen praise the lord and i want to hear you singing please [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Music] praise the lord [Music] amen whether the

i've seen a lot of beautiful faces there's been time i fell so all the love have you been there before but in all let me know that i [Music] [Music] have is i've learned [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] his word well i thank god for the mountains and i thank him for the valley i thank him for the stones he brought me through for if i never had a problem i'd would know where god could solve them i never knew what faith in god could do to do it all [Music] who threw it all [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i've learned to depend upon his words hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] to depend only on his words church i've learned to depend upon his word hallelujah hallelujah clap your hands for jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i was early this morning i was awakened and i tossed pretty much all night i was hauled between two opinions both thoughts coming to me i'm like lord what shall i minister this morning lord which in direction shall i go i said lord just give me a confirmation so i talked with the pastor this morning and i told him what i would love for him to put on the board but when my precious brother came to pick me up this morning and a lot of time i'm all ears i want to hear in the direction that god wanted us to take us this morning so my precious brother was saying a few things i saw mine i said seem like the lord want me to go back to the thought that i had when i left home so this morning as i uh putting my notes together in prayer then god came and confirmed it again in the mouth of two or three witness let every word be established then god had your servant to walk up this morning and read the very scripture that we ought to read this morning so we praise the lord for it so the lord is in this place and i trust i trust that heart will change i pray that lives will change i pray we'll go back out a different way this morning amen let's sing this song and we're going to go into the word this song is going with my message perhaps the key of e flat or f amen we bring sacrifices of praise what is that f we bring sacrifice or praise unto the heart of the lord where we prank sacrifice or break unto the house of the lord and the sacrifice is [Music] [Music] where [Music] we [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] the uh is [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen as we all stand let me let us go into prayer kind heavenly father lord jesus such an honor lord just to be here lord we thank you for health and strength yes we thank you for giving us a mind to serve you to love you with all of our heart lord we thank you for burning desires for your people this morning lord we pray that you take these dry lips with clay and lord you'll walk down each owl and you go into every secret compartment oh god which is our heart and lord will you reveal to us oh god will you help us lord lord we want to be a part of these transitions lord we want to be changed and lord we know it's going to take the word to change us lord in a moment of a twinkling of an eye lord we thank you for the anointing here we thank you for the pastor lord god may your not us this morning will you know the congregation and lord may our heart burn this morning and you spoke to us along the way we thank you god for breaking the shackles of enemies thank you god for losing thank you for bringing love thank you for healing this morning you're jehovah raphae you're still of god of healer you're still jehovah sharma you're present with us and your jehovah jireh you will provide a lamb this morning oppresses god as we approach your word father when you anoint us this morning we ask in jesus name amen those you have your bible amen we go into the word of the lord i've really really have enjoyed myself on last night such a beautiful congregation of people that love the lord and it makes it so easy when you have people that love the lord and you know they they they they like they want to see jesus that's that's the whole purpose why we're here this morning we're we're not here to see man as i said last night god never intended for man to run the church never did god always wanted the holy spirit to run the church so it's the holy spirit through the man so we have to hear directly from the lord and so while you have are you standing we just go in into the word of lord we have three passages of scripture we read from first of all we go to genesis the c chapter again praise the lord genesis the fourth chapter verse two and five then we go to uh romans the 12th which a pastor read this morning then we go to hebrews 11. so we go to genesis uh the fourth chapter and verse two amen are we there by saying amen and the bible says and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of the sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time that mean time went on time brings changes that's right and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the first link of his flock and of the fact they're off and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering verse five but unto cain and his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the lord said unto cain why are thou wroth and why is thy continuous falling now let's go to romans 12 and verse 1. amen romans 12 paul apostle paul wrote here romans 12 and verse 1 we thereby say any man it reads i beseech you therefore brotherings by the mercy of god that you present your bodies not as but a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be and reasonable service amen pardon me let me turn that i pardon me a second pardon me a second amen amen we don't want to mis-quote the word of god man sometimes we put things on our tablet and uh sometimes words be left out so let's go there again i beseech you therefore brothering by the mercy of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed don't be like this world be different we're we're called to be different we are predestinated to be different we're called to have a different walk amen we were born that way that's right and be not conformed to this world but be transformed and the only way you could be transformed it takes the transformer hallelujah formed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god how many you want the perfect will of god last scripture we let you be seated hebrews paul writes again hebrews 11 and verse 4. hebrews 11 and verse 4 you thereby say amen amen by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain by which he attained witnesses that he was righteous god testified of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh amen let us by our heads again father god we thank you for the reading of your word now sanctify it to our soul in jesus name amen and amen you may be seated amen pray the lord o lamb of god hallelujah i mean you thank god for the lamb of god amen we are here amen too brother branham said we are here we go to church amen to hear the word of god and to be better christians to be better citizen amen amen i this morning i can't even walk without the lord holding my hand amen i need the lord every moment amen of my life and i pray you this morning amen it's not by uh works of my righteousness but it's only by the sovereignty grace of the almighty god that we need this morning and i truly believe with all of my heart i i truly believe that we are so close to to the changing of these foul bodies i don't know about you but i've been living in this open house for 61 years now i'm getting tired i'm tired of waking up seeing the same old house i'm ready to live in another house amen and i know i have a theophany that looks just like this amen it's a word body amen and i can hear my theophany calling me amen you know this house right here sometimes the window pane get broken and sometimes the shingles come off the roof and you have to repair it amen if you understand what i'm saying this whole body is getting tired it's getting weary and it's getting broken down but paul said after my departure paul says i got another body that's waiting amen to turn into heaven so we thank god we have a body out there amen that's gonna we're gonna scoop us up brother brandon said it's going to meet us it's going to scoop down and pick us up and we we're going to go and we're going to be caught up to meet them in the air and there we are have a body change amen and glory to god i just feel like we are so close to that this morning don't be discouraged this morning my speech when i said i feel like we're getting close believe that amen uh don't allow the enemy do not allow i want you to hear me do not allow the enemy to say oh i've been here that the reason i said that i was uh i was up in virginia and uh a few years ago and three sisters came up uh it was four three six four sisters came up and uh the lord healed two of them they had uh some type of spots on their uh lungs or whatever and god healed them because he's still jehovah jireh amen you come with the same uh uh uh desire god has got to meet your need this morning and i don't know about you this morning but i have a need this morning i want to die more yeah i don't like me i want to die more but the sister came up in the line and as i we prayed for the sister one young sister came up and she said she said i said sister what does your heart desire i think she was about 27 20 years eight years old i said susan what is your heart desire she said i need to rededicate my life or i need to get closer to the law and when she said that not only did she said it but it was a guff that came with it and i just walked away and i turned around i said something you don't need hands laid on you i said only thing you got to do is speak that word and it must have said the right word she threw the head back and she screamed with a void i'm telling you what man it sounds like i'm talking might sound like a trumpet and the other three sister came up and anointed just flowing to play but one sister came up and i she just kind of stood still so i came down to meet her i think how many think jesus he came down to meet us he came on our level he he know what it feels like amen and i came down with his sister was that i said my sister i said what does your heart desire she said i don't know see i don't know no more i'm like okay she said y'all said it's going to be a rapture and the rapture hadn't come yet and i said sister i said you know i had nothing to grip onto she we lost connection somehow she got around somebody and and and she got discouraged you know she got discovered she got tired of going to church she got tired of hearing music songs after song same sermons you get tired you get weird oh he preached that before well how many times listen to the prophet messing every time you hear something different yeah that's right well you know the same old same when we we come in the church and that's the attitude that people get they come to church they don't look for nothing they they come they come to just say okay god i've been to church i've been to church now don't bother me no more the week i'm i'm going home i've been to church but that that type of attitude that's the wrong attitude your attitude determines your eternal destination so i i'm like david this morning david said i was glad when they said unto us let us go into the house of the lord in other words david was so happy that the ark of the covenant was back in israel you ought to be so happy this morning that the word has been restored back to the bride amen to the church of the living god this morning so don't get to a place let me just can i just take my time i don't know what time of flight is but we will rearrange something let me preach to god people this morning don't get to a place where church become boring if if church become born you you need to be following the altar because we are in trouble it's the same thing about marriage when you when your marriage gets your place and you get bored you are in trouble that's right that's why that's why the lord has allowed me to have 38 years because hey man sometime in a marriage you got to keep doing things you got to move things around you gotta take out buy a roads buy a fly or do something don't be the same do something different you got to keep hey man you got to keep the fire burning somebody know what i'm talking about amen somebody say i don't know about y'all but 38 years

way you work a marriage yo let can i just talk to the brother i don't know where i'm going but let me talk this morning a brother when you got a dear precious wife amen emerges just like a garden if you you can have a beautiful garden but if you don't keep a whole and keep them weed chopped down you gonna have trouble you got to keep things chopped out you got to keep the weeds out you got to keep love you got to keep telling her how sweet she is every once in a while she cook your meal you need to say honey that is fantastic that is delicious sometimes it may be hard as a brick amen look

recipe and she says she said why i got some more in the other before you say learn learn how to keep her happy and you know because i've learned over 38 years men's go by what they see somebody help me don't leave me up here by myself but women's lives off of sweet words and and i her brother said one time man my wife i don't know what's wrong with her she just she's just out of date like aretha franklin i i just don't know what to do it's the way you have to water her the more you word her water her with sweet precious word she blossomed like a rose and you wonder why my wife's so sticky for

husband love your wife you sure you want another ephesian husband love do you know why you love your wife man i look may i die for my wife [Music] [Music] you say that's you what christ he loved his wife that's how much i love my wife and let me be honest with you this morning we married on august 1983 and the day i walked her down the aisle the love i had for her 38 years ago that love is the same today and greater i can't explain that because i don't marry her because she have beautiful white eyes pearl teeth shaped like a coca-cola bottle you can't marry because of that i'm being i'm being facts with you huh because if you're married for that things going to happen are you hearing me then then you don't love her no more but you got to love her amen in spite of all of that because marge is honorable the bed of undefiled hormones and adultery god said i would judge so i i've learned i learned to to to to love my wife and you and you talk about husband love your wife and then people tell me i want another fish lord pastor i just wanted to i want another ephesian you sure when you talk on my defeat you talking my wife see that you reverence your husband who i'm not going to

mean god is your sacrifice is great yes your sacrifice is fantastic your sacrifice is incredible that's right god says abel now understand that god didn't said abel i don't like your sacrifice it's terrible he didn't say that he said abel's sacrifice was more excellent than that of cain and we found out that we found out amen that cain and abel both boys was good church boys both boys would go to church both boys worship god amen and both boys will build an altar and i want to talk about consuming the sacrifice on the altar when it's consumed as meat is burnt that's right it's it's almost done away with it it's gone burnt and when you offer this sacrifice you want to burn it do away with it and in the old testament you you found how that they will offer up sacrifices unto the lord and we found out that when cain and abel offered their sacrifice unto the lord abel's sacrifice was more pleasing to god and lord that's my heart desire this morning lord i want to be pleasing in your sight i feel that this rapture is getting so close lord i want to be pleasing in your sight lord show me my wrongs amen yes you know you could be wrong in things you're not even realizing and nobody could tell you nothing lord if i'm wrong show me your god lord if if if i have a spirit if i got an arrogant spirit lord please help me lord if lord if i got a proud spirit on me lord help me god if i have a spirit that's tagging with me that seems like i can't get rid of it god help me because i'm getting ready to go in the present of the almighty god and when i bring my offering unto the lord i want my offering to be pleasing lord not because i come to church my pastors pastor warren lord i want to go beyond that i want to change heart i want my heart to change lord when i come to church don't let me leave but just don't let me be churchy just just churchy i remember back when i was a little boy i could tell my mom and all would go to church church had a a smell about it they my mama used to smell like peppermints that i knew they'd been to church a lot of people did this did they smell churchy but i i need something to go in the inside because i i talk about last night i was born in sin you were born in sin we was born with the wrong nature yes that's why job said i think uh job the 14th chapter says a man that is born of a woman is a few days i'm full of trouble without the lord we're in trouble we're just going to church but i found out over the years church look look how sacred it is you think about it church amen 2 million and a half came out of egypt two million and a half one out of a million and out of that only two of the original went in and all day i preach a message the day just before the flood and and i think and and i was telling my precious brother i said years ago i think about the scripture it said as it was in the days of noah so shall it be when the son of man would be revealed only what seven in order eight how many eight so noah was preaching seven that that small congregation but remember i believe it with all my heart as it was there i'm sure that there was a lot of people that was believing what noah was preaching but after a process of time things began to change the same it is today people are losing their joy and the love of many are whites and cold paul said in timothy 3 he says that pearl is time not it might come but it shall come we are living in perilous times amen perils me dangerous time the prophet of god let us know perilous also mean people will have an intellectual conception of christ but don't have the person that's what we need is the person of the holy ghost we need a genuine one holy ghost not on our flesh are you hearing me there's going to be a lot of people that's got the genuine anointing the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost they're going to have the holy ghost and they're going to be left right in the sixth seal well how is that brother children and i got the genuine holy ghost you only got it in your spirit lord let it drop from my spirit let it be my soul god please lord i i don't want to be left here i i don't look look young people if you can get it while you young amen you do not want to be left behind this brother brown is saying you rather to miss the rapture he said you wrestle for somebody to take a drill electric drill and ram it in your back and turn it on and mess up your nerves to miss the rapture you rather miss a disappointment but to miss the rapture the changing of our final body and i think this thing is going to happening in the inside it's got that starting the inside then it'll work on the outside i think over the years people have studied the message so and they got quotes at the quote what good is the quote if you don't have the life we need the fire we need the fire to come and consume the sacrifice on the altar amen praise god i've seen you know but you can you got to let the letters kill us but the spirit gives his life lord we need your present this morning we need the holy spirit to go down the aisle we need holy spirit when i was with paul said when i was a child i acted like a child let me tell you what i don't know how old you young mans are but i had a zeal for the lord when i was a little boy yeah i had a zeal for the lord and man i i you know i i love to go to church but let me tell you good old boys don't go to

situations you're going through your problems god know what he's doing the hand of god is all on you so so the angel lord told abraham abraham take your son your only son isaac take him to the mountain i'll show you off and see a lot of times when god would deal with uh we want god to talk to us every day god speak to you in the oliver void you want him to talk to you the next day next day every day lord talk to me unknown time god would tell me things i don't hear nothing in five years on that same result what god told abraham take your son isaac your only son and offer him up as a sacrifice do you know that was a heathen trait but god tested abraham he tried abraham amen he had to prove abraham see that's why i said study examine your own self pastor i said that second corinthians first corinthians 13 5. paul said examine yourself prove your own self know your own self don't worry look don't don't don't put a bug on my suitcase to find out how i'm doing back home bout your own self examine yourself find out how you act when you get around a lot of females you forgot hey man you're supposed to be a christian hey what's up girl bringing around the past hallelujah hallelujah hey what's what's that girl what's up y'all girl and you know that don't look good girl your hair look good she got it bobbed out and you know that don't look good that devil on you for real now that that's what that's what lot did lot said my brother he called them them homosexual his brother them angel said brother whatever look you forgot now you you supposed to be a christian what's up girl girl you look good girl girl that looked good girl what you got on and it's short way up above her knees girl that look that looked good what you got on girl that yeah girl yeah yeah yeah that looked good girl that's everything good yeah what's up bro i was one time this preacher one time he acted real holy talk to me about water baptism and everything but he forgot one day i walked up on him hey man he forgot and forgot where he was at when he saw me you know what he told me he used to talk to me about water baptism said i didn't need the message but when i walked up to him one day look what he did he said what's up dog i mean praise the lord what sin you got to come out of here that's why you got to be burned with fire hey you got to have a new birth amen you got to have new parents say man the old nature got to be done away with amen i had the nature of the world amen but i got a new nature now which is the word of god i take on the same precept of the word that's what i want to be but abraham got his son up isaac early in the morning and i'm sure brother juan he might have walked in the room as he pulled the curtain back i'm sure they didn't have doors down he pulled the curtain back and told his son i said isaac woke up he put his hand with mike's i said come and go with me he couldn't let sarah know that because sir had a hard time believing the promise she told me to go get ishmael look like god ain't gonna move look at the rapture ain't gonna take place look like people fall a thousand may fall but i ain't going nowhere look if the lord don't come in the next five years i guarantee you if i ever come back here i'm gonna be on that much fire because i'm not gonna retreat i'm not gonna back up i'm gonna love the lord god with all my heart body mind and soul [Music] but let me go ahead and add this right here but in the new testament when jesus came on the sea he never told them to offer up sacrifice he said if you want to make it right go lead by the altar go make it don't go make it right and come back and you know what dogs is huh the altar is your heart get your heart ready man when you able to say mountain be thy move and be cast into the sea make sure your heart is right cause we're getting ready to go amen hallelujah we want the fire that's what elijah said lord let the fire come down that's what king solomon said when solomon made a prayer and when was the last time you had a good good good good good prayer at your house everybody busy seeing that people trapped in laodicea you know our prophet warned us he said guard yourself towards the last day spirit i'll lay all this seal he said so many are getting so cold because they haven't realized the effect of the last day spirit a lot of people everybody you talk to old child we in the last days oh message people oh we in the last day but they don't realize the effect of the last day spirit it's a cold form of spirit and i don't want that spirit on me that's why i study the message that's why i kick my head in the book that's what i read when i don't want to read that's when i eat the book when i don't want to eat the ball that's why i keep cause i want all of god i want to present myself as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god musician will you come lord lay me on the altar this morning let me be a sacrifice for that song holy son of kind and true and with thanksgiving i'll be huh come on come on same to be a sanctuary so brother children play it real soft let me tell this right here as you play for the one i remember and i wanted to say this lord to help me i started ministering i was 24 years old 1984 i start ministry we come from pentecost to the message i started preaching the message traveling things happen and i thank god what you say that's the anointing just because you got the anointing on me you changing the inside it brother brother brown blew my mind when he said you could have the genuine holy ghost and still die and go to hell how could you prophet how you don't you don't have the person you just got a new spirit but let me have the baptism the holy ghost in my soul i was preaching almost 29 years preaching traveling preaching 2013 i was at my local church on a friday night we was having prayer night i was on my knees praying to the lord praying crying out to the lord and the voice spoke to me and said the new birth no the bible the lord spoke to me and said accept the corner we fall into the ground and die i kept on praying sister he said accept the corner we fall into the ground and die i kept on praying it said accept the corner we fall into the ground and die so i was saying lord i hear you lord i hear you you got your ball and crossbow so i got up my brother and i sat beside the wall and i went to the gospel of john the 12th chapter where philip and andrew they wanted to see jesus and i'm afraid brother and sister millions of people brother brown said he saw what's left behind i'm afraid of people don't have the genuine holy ghost in their soul so the greeks there was good athletes they were they they wanted to see jesus they came to philip and andrew and philip and andrew took those greeks remember now those boys didn't had the holy ghost but somehow there was an instinct they knew where he was at let me tell you what i thank god the holy ghost led me to this message hallelujah glory to god now here's the part i want you to catch when those disciples took those greeks in the presence of jesus i don't know what jesus was doing but jesus must have looked brown and look at him he didn't say how did y'all heard about me y'all heard about the miracles did y'all hear about lazarus uh jericho's daughter oh y'all heard that i fed 5 000 no he wasn't interested in that look i'm not interested in you knowing about my past i want you to know about jesus you know i can tell you all day about the belt buck i can tell you about a sabine canyon but you need a personal experience yourself you need a new bird down in your soul don't leave until you know you got it cry for the baptism of the holy ghost jesus he told disciples this was he was interested in he says my hour has come he said my hour's coming where the son of man is going to be crucified y'all follow me and i think the first of the second verse he said accept the corner we fall into the ground and die except it died it abides alone a sister said one time to the past she said hard for me to die when everybody around me is living you got to shut everybody off and you got to die you got to completely ride you got the right church you got to stay there till you run your stinking way you got that rod then you got to be a resurrection it's got to be a new birth oh sir we will see jesus let us all stand and say oh oh lord [Music] you and all [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord will be a witness oh lord [Music] me [Music] is [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] god has spoken let the church see amen [Music] let the bride [Music] god has spoken [Music] if you need the holy ghost [Music] let the church see amen [Music] me [Applause] while we all standing to our feet let's lift our voices

have your seat for a little while yeah we'll let you out we want to say we we count ourselves privilege and we think it's an honor for the lord to be able to speak to us in the way that he did this morning you know when when god allowed the storm to come or he allowed the wind to blow the wind is blowing and you see the trees are titting sometimes it looks funny sometimes it looks serious but that is god's way of allowing the roots to to get deeper in the earth and you see god built his people different i was talking to a preacher this morning and we were just we were just talking on different things and uh and you see god can give a preacher such a gift in such a way to carry himself there is a lot of humor that goes with it and he's preaching the word and and you know he frees with you and he said things and you laugh about it but you see it's god way of getting his word to the place he won in your life praise the lord maybe all that must stay in your mind is the laughter all he said is what but that's the word of god shifting and relaxing your spirit to be able to get that word down and then when you go home then he starts to deal with you and if you have an ear to hear you will hear what the spirit is saying praise the lord there's a family that have been with us for a while and we've with all the transition and uh uh the the sister came in and she had to be with uh her parents and uh uh and she was close to giving birth and and brother joseph came and right to work finding the place with all the transition we have not really had a proper way to kind of introduce them and uh because brother joseph he's a preacher too and but uh uh cecilia gave birthing and uh joe called me during the week and said seniors brad wong can can uh can can baby be dedicated on sunday as a show say because my wife says she's tired of staying home she want to come to church so i mean she's not fully fully recovered here but she won't come to church so well and i
