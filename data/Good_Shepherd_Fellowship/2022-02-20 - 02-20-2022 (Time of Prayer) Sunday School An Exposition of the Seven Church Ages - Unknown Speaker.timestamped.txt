[0:35] so
[0:51] he that overcometh the same shall be
[0:53] clothed in white raiment and i will not
[0:56] blot out his name out of the book of
[0:58] life but i will confess his name before
[1:00] my father and his holy angels
[1:03] he that overcometh the same shall be
[1:06] clothed in white raiment
[1:08] this is actually a repetition of verse 4
[1:11] wherein has made reference to the few
[1:13] who have not defiled their garments
[1:15] we used to have a saying years ago that
[1:17] no doubt was taken from this verse
[1:19] it was
[1:20] keep your skirts clean
[1:22] it meant
[1:23] don't get involved in questionable
[1:25] things
[1:26] others will be involved and you might be
[1:28] tempted to be involved or someone might
[1:30] even try to involve you
[1:32] but stay clear of it all by steering a
[1:34] course away from it
[1:36] now god is going to reward those who
[1:38] follow this advice they are going to be
[1:40] clothed in white even as he is clothed
[1:42] in white
[1:44] peter james and john saw him on mount
[1:46] transfiguration and his clothes were as
[1:48] white as light
[1:50] that is how the saints are going to be
[1:51] clothed
[1:53] their garments will be shining
[1:54] exceedingly white
[1:56] you know we are living in the end time
[1:59] it is in this age that the churches are
[2:01] going to come together
[2:03] and as they are even now controlling
[2:05] world politics they will soon control
[2:07] the finances of the world
[2:09] then if you don't belong to the world
[2:11] organization of churches you won't be
[2:13] able to buy or to sell you will lose all
[2:17] those who stay true to god and keep
[2:18] their garments clean from the defilement
[2:20] of this world system of church orders
[2:23] will be physically bereft
[2:25] there will be presented to them a great
[2:26] temptation to give in
[2:28] preachers will give in with the excuse
[2:31] that they will serve god within the
[2:32] framework of the antichrist beast system
[2:35] they will give in to the flatteries and
[2:37] blandishments of the hierarchy
[2:39] and the people will follow these false
[2:41] shepherds right into the slaughter
[2:43] but in the judgment they will all be
[2:45] found naked
[2:46] they will not be given those white robes
[2:49] neither will they walk with him
[2:51] you can't walk in the spotted garments
[2:53] of the world holding hands with the
[2:54] devil here and then expect to be with
[2:57] god
[2:58] it is time to wake up and hear the voice
[3:00] of god crying
[3:01] come out of her organized religion my
[3:05] people that ye be not partakers of her
[3:07] sins that ye receive not of her plagues
[3:10] amen
[3:12] god is speaking
[3:14] shun the religions of this world like
[3:15] you shun the plague
[3:17] leave off walking with the world and
[3:19] make your garments white by repentance
[3:21] and the blood of the lamb
[3:22] but do it now for tomorrow may be too
[3:25] late
[3:26] and he that overcometh i will not blot
[3:28] out his name out of the book of life
[3:31] once again we come to a most difficult
[3:33] portion of the word
[3:35] this verse superficially regarded will
[3:37] be used by both the armenians and the
[3:39] calvinists to suit their purposes
[3:41] the armenians will declare that this
[3:43] verse assuredly annulles john 6
[3:46] 37-44
[3:48] all that the father giveth me shall come
[3:50] to me and him that cometh to me i will
[3:52] in no wise cast out
[3:54] for i came down from heaven not to do
[3:56] mine own will but the will of him that
[3:59] sent me
[4:00] and this is the father's will which hath
[4:02] sent me that of all which he hath given
[4:04] me i should lose nothing but should
[4:07] raise it up again at the last day
[4:09] the jews then murmured at him because he
[4:12] said
[4:12] i am the bread which came down from
[4:14] heaven
[4:15] and they said is not this jesus the son
[4:18] of joseph whose father and mother we
[4:20] know
[4:21] how is it then that he saith i came down
[4:23] from heaven
[4:25] jesus therefore answered and said unto
[4:27] them murmur not among yourselves
[4:30] no man can come to me except the father
[4:32] which hath sent me draw him
[4:34] and i will raise him up at the last day
[4:37] armenianism makes the will of the father
[4:40] not a sovereign purpose but merely a
[4:42] complacent desire as he stands back to
[4:44] see what all men do with his good and
[4:46] gracious gifts and even life eternal
[4:50] the calvinists do not see that
[4:52] they see in this verse strong
[4:54] consolation given to the suffering
[4:56] burdened saints that no matter how evil
[4:59] are the times how terrible the
[5:00] persecution because the overcomer is one
[5:04] who believeth that jesus is the christ
[5:07] he will not have his name removed from
[5:08] that book
[5:10] some also say that this book of life is
[5:12] not the lamb's book of life
[5:15] but as usual when one regards a verse
[5:17] superficially he comes up with a
[5:19] superficial understanding
[5:22] the possibility of the removal of a name
[5:24] from the records of god deserves more
[5:26] than a casual study
[5:28] for up until now most students have
[5:30] merely drawn a conclusion that god
[5:32] places the names of those born again
[5:34] within the lamb's book of life at the
[5:35] time of their rebirth
[5:37] and if for any reason that name must be
[5:39] removed the space on the record will
[5:42] simply be a blank as it was before a
[5:44] name had been placed there
[5:46] this is one hundred percent opposite to
[5:48] what the word actually teaches
[5:51] at the very start of our study let it be
[5:54] known that there is not one scripture
[5:56] that teaches that god is presently
[5:58] compiling a record of names
[6:01] this was all done before the foundation
[6:03] of the world as we will point out
[6:04] shortly also it is not a question of
[6:07] simply involving ourselves with two
[6:09] groups of people both of whom had
[6:11] opportunity to receive eternal life
[6:14] or in one group received it and had
[6:16] their names placed on record while the
[6:18] others who refused did not have their
[6:20] names so placed
[6:22] we will actually show by scripture that
[6:24] multitudes who are not even born again
[6:26] will go into eternal life
[6:29] as strange as this may sound it is
[6:31] certainly true
[6:32] we will also show that there is a group
[6:34] of people whose names having been placed
[6:36] on that record before the foundation of
[6:38] the world
[6:39] cannot under any circumstances have
[6:41] those names removed
[6:43] but will also show that another group
[6:46] whose names were on that record before
[6:48] the foundation of the world will have
[6:50] their names removed
[6:52] to begin with there is no basis for the
[6:55] claims that the lamb's book of life is
[6:57] not the same as the book of life
[7:00] the book of life might be called the
[7:01] lamb's book of life or christ's book of
[7:04] life or even thy book and book of the
[7:06] living
[7:07] only names are written in it
[7:09] revelation 13 8
[7:12] and all that dwell upon earth shall
[7:14] worship him the beast whose names are
[7:17] not written in the book of life of the
[7:19] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[7:20] world
[7:22] revelation 17 8
[7:25] the beast that thou sawest was and is
[7:27] not
[7:28] and shall ascend out of the bottomless
[7:30] pit and go into perdition
[7:32] and they that dwell on earth shall
[7:34] wonder whose names were not written in
[7:36] the book of life from the foundation of
[7:38] the world
[7:39] when they behold the beast that was and
[7:41] is not and yet is
[7:44] revelation 20 12-15
[7:48] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[7:50] before god and the books were opened
[7:53] and another book was opened which is the
[7:55] book of life
[7:56] and the dead were judged out of all
[7:58] those things which were written in the
[7:59] books according to their works
[8:01] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[8:03] in it and death and hell delivered up
[8:06] the dead which were in them
[8:08] and they were judged every man according
[8:10] to their works
[8:11] and death and hell were cast into the
[8:13] lake of fire
[8:14] this is the second death
[8:16] and whosoever was not found written in
[8:18] the book of life was cast into the lake
[8:21] of fire
[8:23] you can see that though there are other
[8:24] books mentioned there is always the
[8:26] reference to one book containing names
[8:29] in the revelation it is called the
[8:31] lamb's book of life or the book of life
[8:34] now where is this book located
[8:37] luke 10
[8:38] 17-24 and the seventy returned again
[8:41] with joy saying
[8:43] lord even the devils are subject to us
[8:45] through thy name
[8:46] and he said unto them
[8:48] i beheld satan as lightning fall from
[8:50] heaven
[8:51] behold i give unto you power to tread on
[8:54] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[8:56] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[8:59] any means hurt you notwithstanding in
[9:02] this rejoice not that the spirits are
[9:04] subject unto you
[9:06] but rather rejoice because your names
[9:08] are written in heaven
[9:10] in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit
[9:12] and said
[9:13] i thank thee o father lord of heaven and
[9:16] earth that thou hast hid these things
[9:18] from the wise and prudent and hast
[9:20] revealed them unto babes
[9:22] even so father for it seemed good in thy
[9:25] sight
[9:26] all things are delivered me of my father
[9:29] and no man knoweth who the son is but
[9:31] the father and who the father is but the
[9:33] son
[9:34] and he to whom the son will reveal him
[9:37] and he turned him unto his disciples and
[9:39] said privately
[9:41] blessed are the eyes which see the
[9:43] things that ye see
[9:44] for i tell you that many prophets and
[9:46] kings have desired to see those things
[9:48] which ye see and have not seen them and
[9:51] to hear those things which ye hear and
[9:53] have not heard them
[9:55] the book of life is definitely located
[9:57] in heaven and will appear at the great
[9:59] white throne judgment
[10:01] in these verses jesus said that their
[10:03] names were written in heaven
[10:05] they were written in the book of life
[10:07] for that is where names are placed
[10:10] jesus was speaking to the 70 verse 17
[10:13] but he was also speaking to the 12
[10:16] 23.
[10:18] these had all been rejoicing that devils
[10:20] were subject to them in jesus name
[10:22] christ's rejoinder was
[10:24] rejoice not that spirits are subject to
[10:26] you but rather that your names are
[10:28] written in heaven book of life you will
[10:32] note here that judas was one of those
[10:34] who were casting out devils in jesus
[10:36] name
[10:37] but we know that he was a devil the son
[10:39] of perdition
[10:40] john 6 70-71
[10:44] jesus answered them
[10:45] have not i chosen you twelve and one of
[10:47] you is a devil
[10:49] he spake of judas iscariot the son of
[10:51] simon
[10:52] for he it was that should betray him
[10:54] being one of the twelve
[10:56] john 17 12
[10:59] while i was with them in the world i
[11:01] kept them in thy name
[11:03] those that thou gavest me i have kept
[11:05] and none of them is lost but the son of
[11:07] perdition that the scripture might be
[11:09] fulfilled
[11:10] john 13 10-11 and 18
[11:14] jesus saith to him he that is washed
[11:17] needeth not save to wash his feet but is
[11:19] clean every wit and ye are clean but not
[11:22] all
[11:23] for he knew who should betray him
[11:25] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[11:28] i speak not of you all
[11:30] and i know whom i have chosen but that
[11:33] the scripture might be fulfilled he that
[11:35] eateth bread with me hath lifted up his
[11:37] heel against me
[11:39] now if language means anything at all we
[11:41] must admit that judas was chosen by
[11:43] jesus
[11:44] john 13 18
[11:47] yet he was not clean
[11:48] john 13 10-11
[11:52] judas was also given to jesus by the
[11:54] father
[11:55] john 17 12
[11:58] let it be noted here that the choosing
[12:00] and giving is the exact parallel as in
[12:02] the illustration of moses and pharaoh
[12:04] jacob and esau
[12:05] for though esau and pharaoh were both
[12:07] foreknown they were predestinated to
[12:09] wrath
[12:10] while the end of moses and jacob was
[12:12] glorification
[12:14] first peter 2 8-9 a
[12:17] shows both reprobates and elect even to
[12:20] them which stumble at the word being
[12:22] disobedient
[12:23] where unto also they were appointed
[12:26] but ye are a chosen generation
[12:28] judas was numbered with the twelve and
[12:30] actually had a part with them in the
[12:32] ministry previous to pentecost
[12:34] acts 1 16-17
[12:37] men and brethren this scripture must
[12:40] needs have been fulfilled which the holy
[12:42] ghost by the mouth of david spake before
[12:44] concerning judas
[12:46] which was guide to them that took jesus
[12:49] for he was numbered with us and had
[12:50] obtained part of this ministry
[12:53] the part that judas obtained amongst the
[12:55] twelve and then lost was neither
[12:57] inferior to the ministries of the other
[12:59] eleven nor was it a devilish foreign
[13:01] ministry interjected amongst the
[13:03] ministries of the others
[13:04] acts 1 25
[13:07] that he may take part of this ministry
[13:09] and apostleship
[13:11] from which judas by transgression fell
[13:13] that he might go to his own place
[13:16] judas a devil lost a god-given holy
[13:18] ghost ministry and killed himself and
[13:21] went to his own place
[13:23] his name was even in the book of life
[13:26] but his name was blotted out
[13:29] now before we pursue this thought on
[13:30] judas let us go back to the old
[13:32] testament and see where god did the same
[13:34] thing
[13:36] in genesis 35
[13:38] 23-26 the sons of jacob were twelve in
[13:41] number and their names were as follows
[13:44] reuben
[13:45] simeon
[13:46] levi judah
[13:49] issachar and zebulun
[13:51] joseph and benjamin
[13:53] dan and naphtali
[13:55] gad and asher
[13:57] these twelve sons descendants became the
[13:59] twelve tribes of israel with the
[14:01] exception that joseph did not have a
[14:02] tribe named after him
[14:04] for in the province of god there were to
[14:06] be thirteen tribes
[14:08] and joseph's two sons were given the
[14:09] honor of bringing the twelve to thirteen
[14:12] you know of course that this was
[14:14] necessary as levi was separated unto god
[14:16] for the priesthood
[14:18] thus when israel left egypt and god gave
[14:20] them the tabernacle in the wilderness we
[14:23] find the tribe of levi ministering to 12
[14:25] tribes named ruben simeon issachar judah
[14:29] zebulun benjamin dan naphtali gad asher
[14:34] ephraim and manasseh
[14:36] the order of the host names them thus in
[14:38] numbers 10 11-28
[14:41] there is no mention of joseph or levi
[14:44] but when we look at revelation 7 4
[14:46] through 8 where it says
[14:48] there were sealed 144 000 of all the
[14:51] tribes of the children of israel
[14:53] it names them thus
[14:55] judah reuben dad asher naphtali manasseh
[15:00] simeon levi issachar zebulun joseph
[15:04] benjamin
[15:06] we are back to the twelve tribes with
[15:07] levi and joseph named amongst them but
[15:10] with dan and ephraim missing
[15:13] the question now arises
[15:15] why are these two tribes deleted
[15:17] the answer lies in deuteronomy 29 16-20
[15:22] for ye know how we have dwelt in the
[15:24] land of egypt and how we came through
[15:26] the nations which he passed by
[15:28] and ye have seen their abominations and
[15:30] their idols wood and stone silver and
[15:33] gold
[15:34] which were among them
[15:35] lest there should be among you man or
[15:38] woman or family or tribe
[15:40] whose heart turneth away this day from
[15:42] the lord our god to go and serve the
[15:45] gods of these nations
[15:46] blessed there should be among you a root
[15:48] that beareth gall and wormwood and it
[15:51] come to pass when he heareth the words
[15:53] of this curse that he bless himself in
[15:55] his heart saying
[15:56] i shall have peace though i walk in the
[15:59] imagination of mine heart to add
[16:01] drunkenness to thirst
[16:03] the lord will not spare him but then the
[16:05] anger of the lord and his jealousy shall
[16:08] smoke against that man
[16:10] and all the curses that are written in
[16:11] this book shall lie upon him
[16:13] and the lord shall blot out his name
[16:15] from under heaven
[16:17] herein is pronounced the curse against
[16:19] idolatry or spiritual fornication
[16:22] the tribe that turned to idolatry was to
[16:24] have its name blotted out
[16:26] and the history of the two tribes whose
[16:28] names were blotted out because of
[16:30] idolatry is found in first kings twelve
[16:33] twenty five through thirty
[16:35] then jeroboam built sheikham and mount
[16:38] ephraim and dwelt therein
[16:40] and went out from thence and built
[16:41] penuel
[16:43] and jeroboam said in his heart
[16:45] now shall the kingdom return to the
[16:47] house of david
[16:48] if this people go up and do sacrifice in
[16:50] the house of the lord at jerusalem
[16:53] then shall the heart of this people turn
[16:55] again unto their lord
[16:56] even unto rehoboam king of judah
[16:59] and they shall kill me and go again to
[17:01] rehoboam king of judah whereupon the
[17:04] king took counsel and made two calves of
[17:06] gold and said unto them
[17:09] it is too much for you to go up to
[17:10] jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which
[17:13] brought thee out of the land of egypt
[17:16] and he set the one in bethel
[17:18] and the other one he put in dan
[17:20] and this thing became a sin
[17:23] for the people went to worship before
[17:24] the one even unto dan
[17:27] hosea 4 17
[17:29] ephraim is joined to his idols let him
[17:32] alone
[17:34] note particularly that the punishment
[17:36] for idolatry was that the name of that
[17:37] tribe was to be blotted out from under
[17:40] heaven
[17:41] deuteronomy 29 20.
[17:44] it does not say that it would be blotted
[17:46] out in heaven but from under heaven
[17:49] and that is exactly as it is
[17:51] for now israel is back in palestine and
[17:54] soon the lord will seal 144 000 of them
[17:57] but from that number dan and ephraim are
[17:59] missing
[18:01] revelation 7 4 through 8
[18:04] and i heard the number of them that were
[18:06] sealed
[18:07] and there were sealed 144 000 of all the
[18:11] tribes of the children of israel
[18:13] of the tribe of judah were sealed twelve
[18:16] thousand
[18:17] of the tribe of reuben were sealed
[18:18] twelve thousand
[18:20] of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve
[18:22] thousand
[18:23] of the tribe of asher were sealed twelve
[18:25] thousand
[18:26] of the tribe of naftalim were sealed
[18:28] twelve thousand
[18:30] of the tribe of manassas were sealed
[18:32] twelve thousand
[18:33] of the tribe of simeon were sealed
[18:35] twelve thousand
[18:36] of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve
[18:38] thousand
[18:39] of the tribe of issachar were sealed
[18:41] twelve thousand
[18:43] of the tribe of zebulun were sealed
[18:45] twelve thousand
[18:47] of the tribe of joseph were sealed
[18:48] twelve thousand
[18:50] of the tribe of benjamin were sealed
[18:52] twelve thousand
[18:53] note dan and ephraim are missing
[18:57] now with this see daniel 12 1 which
[19:00] refers to these 144 000 being sealed
[19:03] during the sixth seal and the time of
[19:05] the great tribulation or jacob's trouble
[19:08] and at that time shall michael stand up
[19:11] the great prince which standeth for the
[19:13] children of thy people
[19:14] and there shall be a time of trouble
[19:16] such as never was since there was a
[19:18] nation even to that same time
[19:21] and at that time thy people shall be
[19:23] delivered every one that shall be found
[19:25] written in the book
[19:28] however after this period of tribulation
[19:30] during the millennium as seen by ezekiel
[19:33] in 48 1-8 and
[19:36] 22-29 we see the tribes back once more
[19:39] in divine order
[19:41] but from the time that ephraim and dan
[19:43] joined themselves to idols they died
[19:46] and those tribes have no more
[19:47] recognition
[19:49] now i realize that since the destruction
[19:51] of jerusalem
[19:52] all records of all tribes have been lost
[19:55] so that no one can say for sure what
[19:57] tribe he is from
[19:59] but god knows
[20:01] that great god who is bringing israel
[20:03] back to palestine knows exactly which
[20:05] tribe every true israelite is from
[20:08] and from all the assembled 144 000 dan
[20:12] and ephraim will be missing
[20:14] here are the tribes of israel
[20:17] ezekiel 48 1-8 and 22-29
[20:22] now these are the names of the tribes
[20:25] from the north end to the coast of the
[20:27] way of hethlon as one goeth to hameth
[20:30] hazarinen the border of damascus
[20:33] northward to the coast of hameth
[20:35] for these are his sides east and west a
[20:38] portion for dan
[20:40] and by the border of dan from the east
[20:42] side onto the west side a portion for
[20:45] asher
[20:46] and by the border of asher from the east
[20:48] side even onto the west side a portion
[20:51] for naphtali
[20:52] and by the border of naphtali from the
[20:55] east side onto the west side a portion
[20:57] for manasseh
[20:59] and by the border of manasseh from the
[21:01] east side onto the west side a portion
[21:03] for ephraim
[21:05] and by the border of ephraim from the
[21:07] east side even on to the west side a
[21:09] portion for reuben
[21:11] and by the border of ruben from the east
[21:13] side onto the west side a portion for
[21:16] judah
[21:17] and by the border of judah from the east
[21:19] side onto the west side etc
[21:22] moreover from the possession of the
[22:30] here are the tribes of israel
[22:32] ezekiel 48 1-8 and 22-29
[22:37] now these are the names of the tribes
[22:40] from the north end to the coast of the
[22:42] way of hethlon as one goeth to hameth
[22:46] hazarinan the border of damascus
[22:48] northward to the coast of hameth
[22:50] for these are his sides east and west a
[22:53] portion for dan
[22:55] and by the border of dan from the east
[22:57] side onto the west side a portion for
[23:00] asher
[23:01] and by the border of asher from the east
[23:04] side even onto the west side a portion
[23:06] for naphtali
[23:08] and by the border of naftali
[23:10] from the east side onto the west side a
[23:12] portion for manasseh
[23:14] and by the border of manasseh from the
[23:16] east side onto the west side a portion
[23:18] for ephraim
[23:20] and by the border of ephraim from the
[23:22] east side even onto the west side a
[23:24] portion for reuben
[23:26] and by the border of ruben from the east
[23:28] side unto the west side a portion for
[23:31] judah
[23:32] and by the border of judah from the east
[23:34] side onto the west side etc
[23:37] moreover from the possession of the
[23:38] levites
[23:40] and from the possession of the city
[23:41] being in the midst of that which is the
[23:43] princes between the border of judah and
[23:45] the border of benjamin shall be for the
[23:48] prince
[23:49] as for the rest of the tribes from the
[23:51] east side unto the west side benjamin
[23:54] shall have a portion
[23:56] and by the border of benjamin from the
[23:58] east side unto the west side simeon
[24:00] shall have a portion
[24:02] and by the border of simeon from the
[24:04] east side to the west side issachar
[24:07] apportioned
[24:08] and by the border of issachar from the
[24:10] east side onto the west side zebulun
[24:12] apportioned
[24:13] and by the border of zebulun from the
[24:15] east side on to the west side gad
[24:17] apportioned
[24:19] and by the border of gad at the south
[24:21] side southward etc
[24:24] another illustration that we might take
[24:26] is the story of israel leaving egypt for
[24:28] canaan land
[24:30] god's purpose in this age was to bring
[24:32] israel out and to take them in
[24:35] to the end that they might serve him
[24:38] thus when they left egypt they all came
[24:40] out under the blood of the sacrificial
[24:41] lamb
[24:42] they all went through the waters of
[24:44] baptism in the red sea
[24:46] they all enjoyed the mighty miracles
[24:49] all eight of the manna
[24:51] all drank of the rock
[24:53] and insofar as obvious external
[24:55] blessings and manifestations were
[24:56] concerned they all partook in like and
[24:59] equal manner
[25:01] but when they came to moab those who
[25:03] joined in the feast of baal peor all
[25:05] died
[25:06] their carcasses fell in the wilderness
[25:09] for it was there that they refused the
[25:10] word of god and turned from it
[25:13] now this is what hebrews 6 1-9 speaks of
[25:17] which was brought out so carefully in
[25:18] the pergamian age
[25:20] you can't go along with just part of the
[25:23] word
[25:24] you have to take all the word
[25:26] there are people who seem involved in
[25:28] the things of god almost 100 percent
[25:31] they are like judas
[25:33] no one but jesus knew exactly what kind
[25:35] of a person judas was
[25:37] so the day came that judas did exactly
[25:40] what israel did at bail pior
[25:42] he decided that he wanted to join with
[25:44] the false vine forces
[25:46] enter into the financial political
[25:48] organization of anti-word anti-christ
[25:50] religion and he did so
[25:52] he was fooled
[25:54] the other eleven were not
[25:56] they could not be for they were of the
[25:58] very elect
[25:59] so when judas left and betrayed the lord
[26:02] his name was removed from the book of
[26:03] life
[26:04] revelation 22 19
[26:08] now i am sure that you have noticed that
[26:10] those whose names were in the book of
[26:12] life were a part of the religious order
[26:14] of that day that centered around the
[26:15] true god and worship of him
[26:17] though they did not worship according to
[26:19] truth
[26:20] word
[26:22] like judas they didn't go all the way
[26:24] see how judas was chosen of god
[26:27] he was instructed in truth
[26:29] he shared knowledge of the mysteries he
[26:32] had a ministry of power granted unto him
[26:34] and he healed the sick and cast out
[26:36] devils in jesus name
[26:38] but when the showdown came he sold out
[26:41] for gold and political power
[26:43] he did not go up to pentecost to receive
[26:45] the spirit of god
[26:47] he was devoid of the spirit
[26:49] make no mistake about it a person that
[26:51] is truly baptized by the holy ghost into
[26:54] the body of christ receiving the
[26:56] fullness of the spirit will be in the
[26:58] word all the way
[27:00] that is the evidence of being baptized
[27:02] with the holy ghost
[27:03] judas failed
[27:05] multitudes fail right there
[27:07] and when they fail to go on in that word
[27:09] their names are taken off the book of
[27:11] life
[27:24] [Music]
[27:59] you
