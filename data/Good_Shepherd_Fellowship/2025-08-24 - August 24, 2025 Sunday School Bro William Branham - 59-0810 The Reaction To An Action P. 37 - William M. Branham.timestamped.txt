[0:24] started walking back and about that time
[0:26] she heard a voice
[0:29] and as she turned to look there was a
[0:32] kindl looking old bald-headed gentleman
[0:34] standing at the gate with a long flowing
[0:36] whiskers he said would you fetch me just
[0:40] a little drink of water.
[0:44] Maybe on her lips she was ready to say,
[0:48] "I just have a little bit."
[0:51] Water was scarce. All the springs was
[0:54] dry.
[0:56] What was it? God works on both ends of
[0:59] the line. God had showed Elijah a
[1:02] vision. Go down into the city. For I
[1:05] have commanded not the ravens this time
[1:08] to feed you, but I'm commanded a widow
[1:11] woman to sustain you and tuck into the
[1:14] poorest of the pores.
[1:17] I've commanded a widow woman to sustain
[1:19] you and she didn't even have enough meal
[1:22] in the barrel for her and her son to
[1:24] live that day. But I've commanded
[1:28] I've ordained it.
[1:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord. When
[1:33] God ordains anything,
[1:36] it's got to happen.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; It'll be there. God will meet it.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; I've commanded the widow there to take
[1:44] care of you, sustain you. He gave him a
[1:46] vision. I can see him walking down the
[1:48] street. The Lord must have told him
[1:49] this. There'll be an old woman looking
[1:51] old. She's young. Her shoulders are
[1:53] stooped. She's her shoulders are ragged.
[1:56] Her arms are out of her sleeves. She'd
[1:58] be out a yard with two sticks in her
[2:00] hand. And Elijah, you know what that
[2:02] means? What'll be in about 800 years
[2:04] from now?
[2:07] And as he walked, he seen the woman. He
[2:08] leaned over the little fence and said,
[2:10] "Fetch me a little drink of water." And
[2:13] she turned to say something. And she
[2:16] thought, "That's a kind old man." He
[2:19] speaks a little different from the
[2:20] ordinary man. There's something about
[2:23] God's children that they know one
[2:24] another.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; Something has always been. and they know
[2:27] one another. My sheep know my voice,
[2:30] said Jesus. And they she looked and she
[2:33] heard she looked at him. She said,
[2:36] "There must be something godly about
[2:38] that old man." Said, "Fetch me a little
[2:41] drink of water."
[2:43] She nodded her head. She would do it.
[2:44] And she started to go away. What?
[2:48] Then she heard the voice again.
[2:52] and bring in your hand a little cake for
[2:55] me to eat a marshall of bread.
[2:59] And she said, "I have just enough for me
[3:03] and my little starving boy.
[3:08] And I'm out here getting these two
[3:09] sticks. I've just mixed it together,
[3:12] dressed it, and now I've got these two
[3:15] sticks to make a far to make the cake,
[3:18] and he and I will eat it and die.
[3:23] Then she heard she started to turn again
[3:27] and she heard a voice saying, "But bring
[3:30] me one first."
[3:34] &gt;&gt; What do we learn here? Seek ye first the
[3:37] kingdom of God.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; How will I need it? I can't tell you.
[3:42] But you put God first.
[3:45] Seek ye first the kingdom of God. And
[3:48] his righteous all these other things
[3:49] will be added.
[3:52] But bring me one first. Look, she didn't
[3:55] have to go down and get her last penny.
[3:57] She had to go down and get her last
[3:59] piece of bread.
[4:01] She didn't have to go for this or that
[4:02] or maybe change doctors or so forth,
[4:05] some little insignificant thing. But she
[4:08] had to go to the only thing that stood
[4:11] between her and death and her child.
[4:14] Bring me a little cake first in your
[4:17] hand. I can see her nod her head.
[4:19] Obedience. That's what God requires. You
[4:23] get the word and the spirit mixed
[4:26] together. Self-sacrifice. Obedience.
[4:30] God's prophet says a certain thing. Do
[4:32] it. Hold on to it.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; She bowed her head. Yes, sir. She starts
[4:39] on. Then she heard the sweetest thing
[4:41] she had ever heard. That allsufficient
[4:44] word that all of us listened for. For
[4:46] there come across that gate a blast from
[4:50] that prophet's voice said, "For thus
[4:53] saith the Lord."
[4:56] &gt;&gt; That's what we look to hear.
[4:59] &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord,
[5:02] the barrel will not go empty or the cru
[5:06] will fail until the day that God sends
[5:09] rain on the earth.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; There it was.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:17] Oh, it gets dark sometimes.
[5:20] Many times we think it's dark.
[5:24] You should follow us in the fields afar
[5:26] if you want to see what darkness.
[5:29] We don't see darkness in America.
[5:32] We got plenty. It gets dark. But I know
[5:36] in our own way, in our categories, it
[5:38] looks dark.
[5:40] We think when we see people sick and
[5:42] dying, that is darkness. Walk with me
[5:45] down through the streets of Kolkata.
[5:48] Watch them come through there, the big
[5:50] baskets, and pick up the dead by the
[5:52] hundreds. Put them up on top their head.
[5:55] Don't even know who they are. Walk over
[5:57] to the salamander and dump them in. At
[5:59] least when a man dies here, he has a
[6:02] religious funeral. There's a John 14 for
[6:05] him.
[6:06] But them people don't have a John 14.
[6:09] They don't have no obituary. They just
[6:11] dump them in and cremate them. Get them
[6:12] off the street dying. The mother's their
[6:16] little babies there in the belly swelled
[6:18] out like that. Mother so weak she can't
[6:19] raise off the street begging for a penny
[6:23] to save her child. Then look what we
[6:25] dump in a garbage can every Sunday.
[6:28] Then we think we have hard times.
[6:31] Oh, it may look hard. It is hard. But
[6:34] friend, one time there's a German
[6:36] painting called the clouds.
[6:39] It's a famous painting like the painting
[6:42] uh out there in California up at the the
[6:46] cemetery there
[6:49] for lawn. It's so big they had to build
[6:52] a building to put into it. Maybe a half
[6:54] a million dollar building or more to put
[6:56] the painting in. It's one of the largest
[6:57] in the world. Germany's got one. It's
[7:00] called the clouds.
[7:03] And when you're looking at it way off as
[7:05] you come to it, it's a horrible looking
[7:07] site. It's dreary. Oh, the clouds are
[7:11] beating together and it looks like it's
[7:13] the most horrible thing for a person to
[7:15] look at. A weary, dreary day. The clouds
[7:19] all forming. But when you get real close
[7:22] to it, you find out it's angels wings
[7:25] beating together, a rejoicing in the
[7:28] heavens. We think we have it hard and
[7:31] sometimes trials come. I think of this
[7:33] woman in the wheelchair and these
[7:35] children. You out there with heart
[7:36] trouble may be dead in a week from now,
[7:38] eat up with cancer. It may look awful
[7:41] dark, but if we'll just keep coming
[7:43] closer to God to find out his purpose,
[7:46] it's the angels of God ready to rejoice
[7:49] for a victory that God wants to give.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[7:54] it's in disguisement. There's sinners
[7:57] perhaps sitting here that thinks, "What
[7:59] would I do if I die tonight? What if
[8:01] this would be the last night I'm on
[8:02] earth? What then?" It may look dark. May
[8:06] look like you're going to die. Maybe
[8:08] you're here to be prayed for to for your
[8:10] sickness and you're still a sinner. You
[8:12] get right with God first.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Say, "Why did I take this? I've got
[8:17] children at home. How do you know that
[8:18] might be angels waning beating together
[8:21] trying to get you close to God so you
[8:23] can be a real mother or dad to those
[8:25] kids?" See, it looks dark like it did
[8:27] for the little woman. But if you just
[8:29] take God's promise now that whosoever
[8:32] will let him come and drink from the
[8:35] waters of life, the fountains of life
[8:37] freely. Drink the water freely. It's for
[8:40] whosoever will. That might been a put
[8:42] upon you. You might have done that evil.
[8:44] You may feel condemned in your heart.
[8:46] You Christians now on what I said a
[8:48] while ago because something iniquity
[8:51] lays in your heart. Maybe it happened
[8:52] for a purpose to get you closer to God.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; That happened to me. My life has been
[8:58] different since I seen that. I thought I
[9:01] was just living fine. But I found out
[9:04] that let that let God raise his hand one
[9:06] time and Satan's got me. We're a martal.
[9:10] And it was just a blessing in disguise.
[9:12] But it makes me appreciate him more now
[9:14] to know that he's loving and willing to
[9:16] take us back. If you're in that
[9:18] condition tonight, you don't know God,
[9:20] you've got condemnation in your heart.
[9:22] It looks awful dark for you and sickness
[9:24] and so forth. Search out your heart now
[9:27] a minute while we have prayer and see if
[9:29] there's anything in there to condemn you
[9:30] or to keep you from being healed or keep
[9:32] you from going to heaven. If there is,
[9:35] let's move close to the altar then and
[9:38] find out if it just ain't the angels
[9:39] wings of together. It is a dark picture.
[9:41] It's God trying to get you close to him.
[9:44] He loves you and he wants you. Let us
[9:46] pray while we bow our heads.
[9:51] Just before praying, may I ask if there
[9:54] would be how many in this audience
[9:56] tonight would like to raise up their
[9:58] hands and say, "Brother Brandon,
[9:59] remember me in prayer tonight. I too
[10:02] want to get close to God." Look at your
[10:04] hands. My all the building. I want to
[10:07] get close to God. I need God. I need
[10:10] thee. Oh, I need thee. Every hour I need
[10:14] thee. Bless me now, my savior. I come to
[10:18] thee. Have you done everything that you
[10:21] know how to do? If you have done met
[10:24] every requirement, you've repented of
[10:26] your sins, you've been baptized and
[10:29] you've you've done everything that you
[10:31] know to do and still looks like God
[10:33] don't answer. I'm going to ask you hold
[10:35] on. Just keep holding there. God's on
[10:39] the throne. He knows all about you. If
[10:42] you've got condemnation in your heart,
[10:43] you can think of something you've done
[10:45] that you ought not have done. some
[10:48] little iniquity, a little thing that you
[10:50] did that you should not have done, then
[10:52] I'd ask you to repent of it. And sinner
[10:54] friend, if you've never accepted Christ
[10:56] as your savior and you don't know him as
[10:58] your savior and you're here tonight, let
[11:01] me invite you to come. While we sing
[11:05] after prayer,
[11:08] I want you to come up here at the altar
[11:09] and stand here. Let me pray with you.
[11:12] Lord,
[11:14] I don't know the hearts of these people.
[11:17] Thou knowest them.
[11:19] But thus saith the Lord,
[11:23] there is a fountain open
[11:26] in the house of God
[11:28] for uncleanness and for sin. A fountain
