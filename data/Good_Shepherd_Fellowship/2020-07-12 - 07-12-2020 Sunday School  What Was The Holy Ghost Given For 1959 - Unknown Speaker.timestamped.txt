[6:32] down my method is how we have a through
[6:34] that will holy roared the Holy Ghost

[6:38] design Presbyterian I wouldn't go to
[6:40] that little little Holy Roller lunch the
[6:42] Holy Ghost come to take all that starch
[6:43] out of you put it at Washington in the
[6:47] blood aren't ya
[6:50] that's what it comes to do it come to
[6:53] straighten you up he said make the
[6:55] crooked places straight that's what it
[6:56] comes to straighten it up make the high
[6:59] places low make all the mountains look
[7:03] like they're all dancing like little
[7:04] Rams and all the leaves are clapping
[7:06] their hands to you the birds sing
[7:08] different joy bells ringing there's no
[7:12] excuses that's what it come to do that's
[7:14] the purpose of God send the Holy Ghost
[7:16] so you would do these things that you
[7:19] would work walk after him now I don't
[7:21] want to hurt you but I told you I'm here
[7:24] with the deepest of sincerity that keep
[7:27] from pinching you once in a while I jump
[7:28] off on a line somewhere just staying
[7:30] with the truth but staying there and
[7:32] making it such way it won't pinch you
[7:33] too hard but I want to tell you
[7:35] something if the Bible says that it's
[7:37] wrong for a woman to cut her hair and
[7:39] you say you've got the Holy Ghost and
[7:41] then cut your hair I wonder if you have
[7:47] don't get mad if it does that still
[7:50] shows us another mark against you if the
[7:55] Bible says it's wrong for a woman to put
[7:57] on a garment that pertained to a man and
[7:59] you wear these little o overhauls and
[8:01] slacks I here on their own you grown
[8:03] women guess a little baby would be all
[8:06] thing plays a little boys and things but
[8:08] look when you when you grown women 15 16
[8:11] 18 years old up to Grandma out and the
[8:14] Bible says it's an abomination in the
[8:17] sight of God for a woman to wear those
[8:19] things and you wear them anyhow and say
[8:21] you got the Holy Ghost I wonder
[8:23] sometimes the Holy Ghost will follow
[8:25] God's Word to the letter and a preacher
[8:29] behind the pulpit ain't got grace enough
[8:31] to preach it I doubt he's got it well
[8:37] that's what the Holy Ghost is far it's
[8:39] the give unction to the preacher is to
[8:42] give holiness to the group it's to set
[8:45] to church and art it's the bringing of
[8:47] unity of spirit it denies together with
[8:50] power it's an United together with love
[8:52] brotherly love I don't care if you're
[8:54] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Luther
[8:56] what ever you are and we've all been by
[8:58] one Holy Spirit baptized into one body
[9:02] and become members of the body of Jesus
[9:05] Christ or not there's nothing present
[9:07] nothing future hunger starvation nothing
[9:10] can separate us from the love of God of
[9:12] love of Christ love of God it's in
[9:14] Christ because we are borned obvious
[9:16] spirit washed in his blood we are a new
[9:20] creature that's what God came to do
[9:22] that's what the Holy Spirit spark yes
[9:25] you that's one now people look at me in
[9:29] the face a lot of hands went up you have
[9:32] the Holy Ghost
[9:33] sure they will oh now I'm just going to
[9:37] bounce just a little bit here this is
[9:39] paint but we're gonna get more to it
[9:42] tomorrow if you say you got it enter
[9:47] guilty of these I wonder watch the lead
[9:50] men God will never lead you off the word
[9:54] you'll keep you with the word because
[9:57] that's God's own
[9:58] laws of his church for his people for
[10:02] women and for man well I said don't harm
[10:07] me to do this or that it doesn't the
[10:09] word says it does and if the Holy Spirit
[10:13] is in you it'll lead you right to the
[10:15] word there'll be no excuses God don't
[10:18] make alterations or excuses he makes the
[10:20] mark and you tow it that's all that's
[10:23] what it is with everyone you come the
[10:25] same way Peter said repent every one of
[10:27] you be baptized every one of you in the
[10:30] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[10:31] your sins then you shall receive the
[10:34] gift of the Holy Ghost that's it
[10:37] we got to hit that line I don't mean to
[10:39] hurt you I love you too much but brother
[10:42] sister do you realize what and I know
[10:45] that I've got to stand in the last days
[10:48] at that resurrection with this
[10:50] generation of people and give an account
[10:51] for this word and the Holy Spirit
[10:54] showing this and me preaching out there
[10:55] where you going to stand how you gonna
[10:59] get by with it you can't do it Fran
[11:02] don't now stop that whatever you're
[11:05] doing it's wrong stop it you said I can
[11:07] then you haven't got the cantor in you
[11:09] yet when the Holy Spirit comes he gives
[11:12] you power over the world and if you
[11:15] listen what he said if you love the
[11:18] world are the things of the world it's
[11:21] because the love of God isn't in you
[11:25] there's no excuses he makes it plain we
[11:28] got to come up to that mark I know you
[11:31] think I'm awful but I'm just awful full
[11:36] and listen that is true now come up to
[11:40] it brother sister don't let some of
[11:42] these intellectual colleges around here

[11:46] it sold for we step then God's old fogey
[11:49] and if god's old fogey than I am - amen

[12:06] alright
[12:07] God says it's not off you just take a
[12:10] good sociable grain just get on a little
[12:12] drunk once in a while but God said woe
[12:14] unto him all you say it's alright

[13:06] restrooms there places where it would
[13:07] just and dirty things on the wall I
[13:11] thought how in the world can people be
[13:13] so lowdown and stink and when I walk
[13:16] into those places I've often told what a
[13:18] stinker

[13:22] hands I'd be afraid that I want to tuck
[13:24] a hold of doorknob again to be germs

[13:29] day standing in the airport one of them
[13:31] places I walked in a railroad place I
[13:33] walked into that and I thought oh mercy
[13:35] it's some said to me that's the way the
[13:38] world smells to God
[13:41] it's an abomination I thought when I see

[13:47] herself all tearing out like that in
[13:49] man's clothes on that's what it looks
[13:51] like the God it's an abomination

[27:57] much different to the world you're from
[27:59] above
[28:00] you're a born you're an ear or citizen
[28:03] of another Kingdom you believe it that's
[28:08] what the Holy Ghost is is to make you a
[28:11] citizen of the kingdom of God then if
[28:14] you are a citizen of the kingdom of God
[28:17] how does it make you act like God does
[28:23] in his kingdom now what does God do in
[28:27] his kingdom
[28:28] this holiness righteousness you purity
[28:33] of thought purity of mind power in love
[28:38] going to the lost healing the sick for
[28:42] party miracles doing great things that
[28:47] is the world you look crazy the same
[28:49] guys are also they're here but you are a
[28:53] citizen of the kingdom one more
[28:56] scripture going to write it down John
[29:00] 12:24 let me quote it to you right quick
[29:03] Jesus said if a corn of wheat falls into
[29:06] the ground accept it down it cannot
[29:10] bring forth another life hello one
[29:13] closing remark now I remember then it is
[29:17] absolutely now to you people it's
[29:21] absolutely essential and necessary and
[29:25] compelling and compulsion that you
[29:28] receive the Holy Ghost now or if you
[29:32] don't you can't come in the resurrection
[29:35] now watch God cannot break his laws we
[29:39] know that he follows his laws now a
[29:42] grain of wheat or corn will take like
[29:45] jesus said their course of a car in the
[29:48] Bible
[29:49] today refers to flex or any kind of seed
[29:51] but we barley laid there anything it's a
[29:55] corn but when a corn of wheat falls into
[29:59] the ground now it is all of us share
[30:01] have seen though this happens a corner
[30:05] wheat or grain of corn can look as
[30:07] perfect as it can be and you put it in
[30:10] the ground and at that corn
[30:12] it has perpetual life it'll go down
[30:16] today reproduce itself in a stall and
[30:18] come back down and go up again and come
[30:21] back down it's perpetual line if that
[30:23] corn hasn't got the germ of life in it
[30:28] no matter how beautiful it looks
[30:30] it'll never raise it'll go to the ground
[30:33] and rot and that's it part of it the
[30:36] materials can be used for fertilizers
[30:39] and things in the ground but as far as
[30:41] it ever living again it'll never live
[30:43] unless it's got perpetual life in it
[30:47] anyone knows that you just can't
[30:51] there can be two men one of them just
[30:53] exactly both are just alike one of them
[30:56] can be a good man he could do good works
[30:58] he can do so forth but except that man
[31:01] has eternal life in him he'll never rise
[31:07] in the resurrection he can't do it
[31:10] there's nothing there to raise there's
[31:12] nothing to bring him up there's no life
[31:15] so you see my dear brother my dear
[31:18] sister except the man be born again he
[31:22] can in no wise come back into this
[31:25] kingdom he can't accept this corn or
[31:29] wheat falls into the ground and dies
[31:31] he's talking of himself but he had not
[31:34] perpetual eyes he had eternal life and
[31:37] he life he gave to you that you might
[31:39] have the same kind of life now if you
[31:41] just got human life enough to move you
[31:44] around lusts she that liveth and
[31:47] pleasure is dead while she is alive
[31:51] you can't rise you might be the most
[31:54] popular girl in school you might be the
[31:57] most popular girl at the card game of
[31:59] your society you might be the best dress
[32:02] woman in the country you might be the
[32:03] prettiest you might be the best built
[32:07] you might be a Idol to your husband you
[32:10] might be all these things which that's
[32:13] wonderful but sister unless you have the
[32:18] Holy Ghost in you which is eternal life
[32:20] at the end of this road you are finished
[32:24] and I don't care what you look like or
[32:27] how these things are how unpopular a
[32:30] popper you are ha prettier how ugly if
[32:32] you've got eternal life there you'll
[32:35] live forever forever when the moon and
[32:39] stars has gone and the earth has weekd
[32:42] itself into the mountains in the deserts
[32:46] and everything has has no more and the
[32:49] world's a toddler like a drunk man
[32:52] coming home at night and the Stars
[32:54] refused to shine and fall from the
[32:56] heavens of the moon the Sun blushes and
[32:59] hides its face when to see the Son of
[33:01] man coming your shining the rites of
[33:04] this of Jesus Christ to come forth from
[33:06] the grave as a young beautiful woman to
[33:08] take your mate and live forever and
[33:10] forever and forever and all eternal ages
[33:13] you'll still be living that's what the
[33:17] Holy Ghost is far if you feel the least
[33:21] tug don't turn it away what is the Holy
[33:26] Ghost God in you
[33:28] what's it far to continue his work among
[33:31] these people to bring his church
[33:32] together to bring a church to a place in
[33:35] this thing far beyond the Lutheran
[33:38] Methodist and Pentecostals into a place
[33:40] to our adoption and a rapture and grace
[33:43] that one this part of a church when the
[33:45] spirit moves into this church here it'll
[33:48] just raise and it'll bring forth
[33:51] bringing forth all of the ravine that's
[33:55] touched that spirit those Luther's who
[33:57] stood there with all the life they had
[33:59] in justification those Methodists of
[34:01] pelham afford the filled water interface
[34:03] from the spirit strike them through
[34:05] sanctification those Pentecostals that
[34:07] they rocked up down the street and call
[34:09] them tongues the lung and Oh
[34:10] jabbers the goose language and all
[34:13] they'll stand the sight of God at that
[34:18] day just as certain as this Bible stands
[34:19] here if you believe me to be a servant
[34:21] you call me as prophet I don't call
[34:24] myself that but you listen I'm telling
[34:25] you in the name of the Lord those that
[34:28] are in Christ will God bring with him at
[34:32] his coming
[34:33] at the resurrection and only those that
[34:36] are in Christ how do we get in Christ
[34:38] folks by one creed we are all joined in
[34:42] know about one handshake we are all
[34:45] pulled in know about one water we are
[34:48] all baptized it know or about one
[34:52] denomination we are all denominated in
[34:54] know but by first Corinthians 12:13 by
[34:59] one Holy Spirit God's Spirit we are all
[35:07] Methodist Baptist Luther's Presbyterian

[35:35] and believeth on him that sent me when
[35:38] the Holy Ghost is testified of his
[35:39] resurrection have eternal life and shall

[36:15] judged and judged yourself as a fool for
[36:18] Christ and in his righteousness that
[36:22] date will stand and marvel and his life
[36:25] is only one way how by one spirit we are
[36:32] all baptized into one body and when
[36:36] you're in that body judgment has already
[36:38] judged that body and you've accepted him
