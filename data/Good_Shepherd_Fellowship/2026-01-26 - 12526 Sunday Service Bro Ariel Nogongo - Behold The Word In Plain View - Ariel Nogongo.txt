TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this morning and we want to thank the Lord for bringing us together, giving us this opportunity to come into the house of the Lord. And we want to greet uh greet you, greet everyone that is streaming into the service this morning. Uh just before we go into our service, I will uh before our song will come up. Uh I just uh talk there, we should just have a little prayer meeting this morning and then we will change the order of service. Let's read Psalm chapter 1 25. You know uh as as as believers sometime it's so easy for us to disconnect ourself with things. We think that we are disconnecting ourself with things that are happening around us because you know we have faith. We believe in God and not death. But uh we must realize that the the purpose of the church is to serve the community. That's what the church is for. But Brandon said when God called a man, he called him for the community. And the church is uh is God's representation in the community. So uh uh when we see everything that is happening around our community uh is uh I mean it would be very very wrong and very cold of us not to not to be able to identify with uh with the community in general. We are not part of their politics. We're not part of uh uh we not we are not supported by the governor or the the the state of Minnesota, we are supported by heaven, but we must realize this is where we live. This is where we go to work and uh this is where we bringing up our family. So, I just thought that uh with everything that is happening around us as a community, it will it will be good for us to just uh approach the Lord in prayer. Just uh yesterday, if you follow the another life for lost in our community with everything that is going on. We will leave we will leave that with uh with God to do the judgment but uh uh uh it's it's a human life that was lost and uh um people are hurting people lost their loved ones in such a time like this whether by the the chaos that is out there sickness or different things. There are people that are sick and overall people need the Lord. People need the Lord. So, I just thought that we would approach the service this morning uh uh by the word of prayer and then uh we can go into our our normal worship service. Times the times that around us are not normal. You know, the times around us are not they are no longer governed in a way that is supposed to be governed. So as uh as the church of the living God, we also learn to adopt to the times that are around us. If uh if it does not feel safe for us to be in church, we're not going to force you to come to church. And uh if it is uh uh I mean if it if it is just for us to have a prayer meeting, read a scripture and go home, that's exactly what we're going to do. So uh the time around us at that number, but we trust that the Lord will will will keep us. Amen. We trust that the Lord will keep us. That's why we we believe that he will watch over us. He promised to watch over our going out and our coming in. So we will read Psalm chapter 125 this morning and then we will just uh take up some few prayer needs and then uh we will turn ourselves to brother Lord. Psalm chapter 125 they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion which cannot be removed but forever as the mountains are round about Jerusalem. So the Lord is around about his people from henceforth even forever. For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lots of the righteous. Least the righteous put forth his hands into iniquity. Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good and to them that are upright in their heart. As for such as turn aside from their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with uh the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity, but peace shall be upon Israel. Amen. So, we are believing that the Lord uh uh he's the one that is watching over us. is the one that is watching over our loved ones. He's the one that is watching over our city. So, let's just bow our hands together this morning and u I bless your name. I bless your name. Let's sing that chorus now. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor. I give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I'll bless your name. Oh, I'll bless your name. I bless your name and I give you honor. Lord, we give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. One more time now. Lord, I bless your name. Thank you, Lord. I bless your name and I give you honor. I give you praise. You are the life, the truth, and the way. I bless your name. How bless your name. Let us pray together this morning while the music softly play. Let's just thank the Lord for his uh his blessing, his his his love that he has sprank upon us and uh realizing that is the Lord that that uh that keep the city. He's the one that's been watching over us. Let's just thank him for watching over our going out, our coming in and uh uh keeping his grace and his love and his mercy upon us. And uh let's just pray this morning also remember um all those that are hurting, all those that uh that are directly affected by everything that is happening around us and uh uh relations to those that lost their lives and uh and and loved ones away from them and all of that. And we just want to just uh lift our hearts to the Lord this morning. Like I said, as as a people of God, uh I mean, it's it's it's very wrong if we think that we are uh this special class of people or people that are untouchable. And uh uh we know that it is only by God's mercy and his protection upon our lives. But uh this is where we live and this is uh this is our community and uh and uh and that's the people that we must serve. The reason why God will put a church in a place is for the church to stand in the bridge. The church to be uh uh uh we must go to protest. We must go before the throne of God. We must protest before the throne of God asking God for mercy asking God to just uh h the people and uh uh and everyone from the leaders everyone that is that is involved. And that's what we want to do this morning. We just want to put our hearts before the Lord in a way that God will inspire your hearts to pray this morning. I want us to just pray. Let's pray together in Jesus name. Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, oh God, we come before you, Lord. Father, Lord God, we are living in a time of uncertainty, Lord God.

We didn't have time to practice and at my house I don't have a piano yet. So, so we're gonna do it a cap. I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus who died upon the cruel tree to think of his great sacriice at Calords from me. How many are the lost that I have lifted? How many are the chain I' set free? I wonder have I done my best for Jesus when he has done so much for me. &gt;&gt; The thy wasted are so many. The spent for Christ so few. Because of all my lack of love for Jesus, I wonder if his heart is breaking, too. How many are the laws that I have? How many are they chained up to free? I wonder have I done my best for Jesus when he has done so much for me. I wonder I cared enough for others or have I let them die alone. I might have helped a wonder to the Savior. The seed of precious life I might have saw that I have lived. How many are the chain I' set free? I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus? When he has done so much for me, &gt;&gt; no longer will I stay within the valley. I'll climb to mountains above. The world is dying now for want of them of the Savior's matchless love. How many have I lost? How many are the chain I've helped to free? I wonder how I done my best for Jesus when he has done so much for me. hands together for Jesus this morning. What a privilege for us to gather this morning. We want to thank the almighty God. Let us go ahead and rise. And as we sing one or two song this morning, we'll ask um the deacons to go ahead with the offering. Hallelujah. Let's clap for Jesus this morning. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Living below in this old sinful world as we comfort can afford striving alone to face temptation. Lord, where could I go but to the Lord? Where could I go? Where could I go? Seeking a refuge for my soul. Need a friend to help me in the end. Where could I go but to the Lord? Neighbors are kind. I love them everyone. He get along in sweeter God. But when my soul lead my love from above, where could I go but to the Lord? Where could I go? Where could I go? Taking a reuge for my soul. I needed a friend to help me in the rain. Where could I go but to the Lord? Life here is great with friends I love so dear. Oh I get from God's own word. Not when I face this chilling hands of them. Where could I go but to the Lord? Where could I go? Where could I go? making a refuge for my soul. I'm needing a friend to help me in the rain. Where could I go? But to the Lord, where could I go? Yes. Back I go seeking a refuge for my soul. I need you to help me where gold to the Lord. Neighbors are kind. I love them. Everyone we get along is in sweet God. But when my soul made man from above, where could I go but to the Lord? Where could I go? Where will I go? I'm seeing a refuge for my soul. I've made a friend to help me. Where could I go? belongs to the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. May the Almighty God bless us since with all that is happening, where could we go? Only to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Only to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Pastor just said it, we need to go down on our knees and pray. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. &gt;&gt; We just want to bless God for this time. All right, we'll sing this song as we change the order of service. To my everlasting portion, more than friend, all life to me all I long my pilgrim journey. Savior, let me walk with thee. Close to thee. Close to thee. Close to thee. Close to thee. All I long my pilgrim journey savior let me walk with thee not for ease or worldly pleasures nor for fame my prey.

Lead me through the valley of shadows. Car me faithful see and the gates of life eternal. May I enter Lord with thee. Close to thee. Close to thee. Close to thee. Close to the I toil and suffer. Let me walk with &gt;&gt; May God bless you. Shall we just have a word of prayer? Gracious heavenly father, we want to thank you, Father, this morning for the grace and the mercy that you have given unto us to be in your house. Lord, you have said when two or three are gathered in my name, I will be among you. &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe one thing that you are here this morning, Lord. Even though the weather is so bad, so cold outside, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; but your people have come to see you, Lord, they have not come to meet me, Father, or meet one another, Lord God. We are standing in the presence of the mighty God, Jehovah. Lord, we believe that, Lord, that you would visit us in a special way. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know the needs of your people. &gt;&gt; You know our burdens, oh Father. We not coming here based on our own abilities. But we are relying on you Jesus. &gt;&gt; May you just come and open the portion of the word to us. Father, Lord God, may you bless us in a special way. &gt;&gt; Lord, encourage our hearts this morning, oh God. Lord, we going through so much, oh God, Father, but Lord, you promise that you will never leave us, that you will never forsake us, oh God. Even when the enemy is coming from different direction, oh God, our eyes are not looking neither to the north or the south or the east or west, Lord, but we're looking up to you, Father. Lord, may your angel take control over this service from the beginning to the end. Lord God, if there's any spirit that is not called upon your name, Lord, we remove it out of this place in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, we take this service under your control. May Lord God, the mighty angel comes in this room right now, oh God, as we are offering you, Father, our services, we put oursel aside that you would minister the word to your people only in your own manner, Lord. We love you, Father. We appreciate you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray and ask. Amen. May God bless you. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Uh the Lord has been good to us. Uh and without his help, I don't think that we'll be able to be here. Uh we're just trusting in him that something will be said that will be of an eternal value of a blessing to you. Is that right? Uh we want to dismiss also our sister and the kids for Sunday school. the pastor asked me to do so and uh we were just going to open our Bibles. I was planning to have a PowerPoint but uh the Lord decided otherwise. So we'll trust the Lord for the remaining portion of the service. Uh we'll open our Bibles in the book of of Deuteronomy chapter 29. Deuteronomy chapter 29. It's only one verse. Deuteronomy the last actually last verse of uh Deuteronomy chapter 29. I will really depend on your prayers. Who who promised to pray for me? &gt;&gt; Amen. I need that this morning. There is something that the Lord has put in my heart and and throughout the night was just a little challenging but I know it's a blessing you know it's a sign that God is about to do something &gt;&gt; you know to me I just know when things start happening and things are just trouble start happening I know that God is about to do something &gt;&gt; and this morning as as we were driving and somebody almost ran over us he was not even looking so I was like whoa there was something good this morning that God So even myself, I'm depending on the Lord that he'll be able to help us and and uh break the word of God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Deuteronomy chapter 29 verse 21 uh 29 if we can read it together. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever." And we may do all the words of this book. &gt;&gt; You see, secret belongs to God. &gt;&gt; Once God decide to open that secret, &gt;&gt; it belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:7. Revelation 10 verse 7. And we're going to read the last uh I mean verse seven. That's right. If we can all do it together. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when it shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished &gt;&gt; as he has declared to his servants the prophets. &gt;&gt; And and I want to draw your attention to uh the mystery there is singular is not plural. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You notice that &gt;&gt; it's singular. So you may be seated. Thank you. Um I want to appreciate brother one once again uh for the privilege to speak this morning. Uh uh we we trust that the Lord will be able to help us. Uh I want to read again a a quotation that I read on on Wednesday. Uh and I think the Lord has been really dealing with my heart to remain on this subject or this thought here. He speaks in the message the context. He says he's praying just at the end of year 62 entering into 63. It says heavenly father as we stand here as many thoughts is dying out in our heart and of the mistake of last year as we approaching the death of 62 and the birth of 63. He says, "Oh God, may we be one step higher up the ladder until we can see Jesus and his program." And for this new year, I want to see Jesus and his program. Now in everything that is happening around us saints, we want to see Jesus and his program. &gt;&gt; And on Wednesday we spoke about the purpose of God, the two baskets of fig showing how God has sent Israel to captivity, you know, and it says it was for their good. &gt;&gt; And the question came out to be uh how can captivity can be seen as something positive. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know how can your trial and the things that you are dealing with can be considered as something positive &gt;&gt; or something good, right? &gt;&gt; But God has a purpose. You know, God is is an eternal God. He has he was living by himself as Elohim is having thoughts. He he had desire to do things in a certain way. But it happens that you know when God has thoughts, it's a secret in his mind. as we just read. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So there's a mystery that is there that is very very important is a principle even of God himself. You know when you have a secret in your heart you don't disclose it. Is that right? &gt;&gt; It is still in your mind. You're just thinking about it. You're fellowshipping about it right about the whole thing. You're planning to do you kind of having ideas how you're going to make it happen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; It's the same thing with God. He was living by himself as Elohim. But now having all of this thought in his mind and including you, you were part of his mind. &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that? &gt;&gt; You were part of God even before you step into that flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were part of his thought. &gt;&gt; So now everything including you, you were a secret in his mind. &gt;&gt; You were part of that secret. Right? &gt;&gt; But now God is trying to express whatever from whatever he had in his thought. He want to make it tangible. &gt;&gt; Then he begins to create things. He create angel to worship him. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Because he desired to be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now we saw on Wednesday nobody nobody was you know there was no no a sinner on earth yet. &gt;&gt; Right. But God actually make men in a certain way. He gave him the free more agency, the ability to choose. He gave the woman to be a wicked vessel for for for a purpose. All of these things we saw that, right? &gt;&gt; But behind it, God wanted to express what he had in his mind. &gt;&gt; He wanted to leave the state of being a secret that only belongs to him. &gt;&gt; But now he says, I have subject on earth. I want whatever I had as a secret to to be tangible, I want to express that in the life of my son and my daughter. How many of us believe that? &gt;&gt; And I do believe that if you are sick tonight, Jesus Christ or God himself, he has the desire to heal you. &gt;&gt; It's not just if you want or what is his purpose to heal you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But now you need to have faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith is the only thing that can actually CUT GOD BECAUSE GOD HAS already spoken it. &gt;&gt; But you must believe for whatever God says is the truth. &gt;&gt; Anybody that applies faith on anything will see the result. &gt;&gt; Even if they are in sin, even a prostitute on the street, if she apply faith the right way, God will give you give her what she wants. Amen. &gt;&gt; That that's true. &gt;&gt; So it depends on your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now as we entering into this new year, there's quite a lot of things going on. But we want to see Christ. We want to see Jesus and his plan. &gt;&gt; Why God is allowing things to happen the way it's happening. But I want to turn your mind here just for for for a few minutes that we have before us on Jesus Christ the word. I want you to keep Christ inside of your on your mind. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So my subject tonight I want to speak on behold the word in plan view. &gt;&gt; Behold the word in plan view. Now when I'm mentioning the word behold, behold just means discern, perceive, look closely, pay attention. The word is Christ. How many of us believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in other word, pay attention on Jesus Christ. Focus on Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many times when things happening, we're focusing on events that are happening around us. I don't think it's there's anything wrong with it, right? But we as believer, we should keep our eyes on Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because the time that we lose our sight from Jesus Christ, the world will take control of our life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We stop making decision without even knowing that that's come true to the word. &gt;&gt; But if you keep your eyes on Jesus Christ, then the word of God begins to explain to you why all of these things are happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you start looking in the word, God starts showing you, look at this. It had happened in the past because there's nothing new under the sun. &gt;&gt; So your sickness, you're not the only person on earth that had it. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; Your trouble, you're not the first person. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be the last person. &gt;&gt; But for anything to happen in your life, you must keep your eyes on the word. &gt;&gt; If you're expecting a miracle in your situation, keep your eyes on the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? We should keep our eyes on the revealed word for our day. &gt;&gt; Now, by the grace of God, I want to look into the Old Testament for just a minute here. When men sin in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had fellowship with God. How many of us believe that? &gt;&gt; There was no hindrance. So if man want to talk to God, he will just have a conversation with his father. No limit. &gt;&gt; You see that &gt;&gt; there's no nothing could hinder Adam to express to his father what he wanted. &gt;&gt; Adam could stand throughout the day. He says, "No, I don't want that tree to be there." He turns and say, "Tree move on the other side." &gt;&gt; And God will look and say, "Oh, that's the way I wanted to do it." So God will look at Adam the way he's operating. God is saying this is the way I will do it as well. &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful to come to that place where &gt;&gt; you don't even have to kneel down and pray. &gt;&gt; You just speak the word and something happened. &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that we'll get there? We are getting there for a matter of fact. &gt;&gt; But the power of the spoken word Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD is bringing us back to that place &gt;&gt; where we have the same authority that Adam had. &gt;&gt; For the matter of fact, the word redemption to restoration is TO BRING US BACK TO THAT PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And there must be a message &gt;&gt; that will bring us back there. Amen. &gt;&gt; There must be a a a a a light that will shine that will give so much power into our being to speak something into existence. &gt;&gt; It's not our own ability. For the matter of fact, we're already born in sin. &gt;&gt; This body is already compromised. &gt;&gt; But the things that will do it, it's not what you see here. &gt;&gt; It's something that is happening inside of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because your heart must be turned. &gt;&gt; And once our heart is turned, then we can speak things into existence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you need faith to do that. &gt;&gt; It's not an intellectual faith to say, "Oh, I maybe I will do it." No, that's a guess. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S GOD. WHEN GOD DWELL IN YOUR HEART, God starts speaking from within. &gt;&gt; God is speaking FROM WITHIN. THE GOD THAT LIVES in your life, in my sister, in my brother begins to speak things into existence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even your children must be probably gone astray. &gt;&gt; You can speak from within. &gt;&gt; You start claiming them from within. &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I don't know where my child CAN BE, &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT I'VE RECEIVED, I'm calling that child back." &gt;&gt; You see that? Then you start speaking to the devil. is a Satan. &gt;&gt; I'm a son and a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I know my position in Christ &gt;&gt; and I know what I HAVE RECEIVED. &gt;&gt; SO I have the right to claim my child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; It's God who has given you that child. In other word, you have the right as a parent to claim that child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God's given child. That's your inheritance. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; There's no demon in hell &gt;&gt; that can stand against against a child of God who knows their position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the church of the living God, we must get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we are living in the time where the word has been revealed to us. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; The same authority that Adam had. Oh, glory to God. The same authority that Adam had, we have it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of us believe it? &gt;&gt; Then as we are preaching, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to claim it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to claim it. &gt;&gt; Adam in the Garden of Eden had lost his position. He has lost his authority because of sin. Can you imagine the sadness he could have could feel? He says, "Man, I could I could talk to my father, but now I can't talk to him." &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And he looks at Eve. He said, he's not looking at Eve to blame if or if it's because of you. It's because of love. He's looking at Eve if say love, I love you, Eve. &gt;&gt; These things happen is because I made a decision. Yes, &gt;&gt; I deliberately made a decision because of love that I had toward you. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S OKAY IF GOD WANT TO CAST US OUT. BUT I I'M GOING TO STAY with you. &gt;&gt; That's Christ love. &gt;&gt; That's love being expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO SAINTS WHEN WHEN WE ARE looking at our wives maybe they can make a mistake. &gt;&gt; The love of Christ in our heart we should stand there and say you know you have done wrong. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I don't stand for it, BUT I WILL STAND with you. &gt;&gt; I WILL PRAY THAT the Lord will help us. This is the reason why &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit has been sent to this age to have the nature of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not about our culture. &gt;&gt; It's not about OUR TRADITION. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; We are we have come here &gt;&gt; to receive the spirit of Christ, &gt;&gt; not to receive the spirit of our ancestors. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we are Christian, we must align by this book. &gt;&gt; Not our tradition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam lost his authority. Now God cast them out you know he removed them out from the garden of Eden and he placed cherubans. If we go to the book of Genesis chapter 3 there is a thought that is coming there. I will trust really in the Lord tonight this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I mean the gift is just to put yourself aside so God can use it. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to do it this morning by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 3 verse uh probably the the last the last three verses there. Let me look into that real quick. Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 3 verse 23. Therefore, therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to tilt the ground from then he he was taken. So he drove out the men and he placed at the east side of garden of Eden cherubims and the a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way. I want you to catch that. To keep the way of the tree of life. You see the cheruban will say no if we let Adam and Eve touch the tree of life they're going to live eternally again &gt;&gt; says but sin has already entered &gt;&gt; it come he places the cherubims to God the throne he says to God what the way the way of the tree of life the tree of life was a person &gt;&gt; the tree of life was Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the way he is the way and the truth. &gt;&gt; So the way was Jesus Christ and the tree of life was a person which was Jesus Christ as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the way to Christ was blocked because of sin. &gt;&gt; Nobody had access to God. &gt;&gt; The feeling that Adam could have to go in the presence of God, it was no longer there. &gt;&gt; That's right. It was blocked because there were cherubims with with flaming sword. &gt;&gt; But now God, remember God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this? &gt;&gt; Even if he places cherubams there, &gt;&gt; he still has a purpose about you. &gt;&gt; It's not about Adam and Eve. It was about him. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he desired to fulfill something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, "No, I don't want you guys to touch on the tree of life again. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you touch it, you live eternally." &gt;&gt; That sent them out. &gt;&gt; Now, Adam never knew the feeling of having a headache. &gt;&gt; He start having headache. &gt;&gt; He start feeling weak in his body. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it happens that Son Abel was murdered but the son of the devil came. &gt;&gt; Adam stood there says what had just happened. It took Abel. He had to bury him &gt;&gt; which isn't another process. I never seen such a thing. The lion that I used to fellowship with that lion is coming after me. said, "Can you imagine the confusion that I personally will be will have?" &gt;&gt; I can't even imagine. &gt;&gt; But yet, God was still looking at the son. &gt;&gt; God took a lamb. It says, "No, I'm going to reproduce what is in my mind, &gt;&gt; but yet it's not going to be what really I want, but I'm going to bring it in the in the shadow form." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are we having a conversation this morning, right? &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep it like that and I trust the Lord for the remain portion. &gt;&gt; He says, "No, I'm just going to play as a shadow." It takes an animal. God slay the animal. And the blood was gushing all over the place. And he took the skin of that animal and he covered Adam. &gt;&gt; He covered Eve. &gt;&gt; Do you remember that when Adam was running away from God, it took a a a fake thing. He covered himself. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But the Bible calls a religion. &gt;&gt; Sometime when we do wrong, we run away from God. It's not you that is going on your knees and say God please forgive me we're running away &gt;&gt; but God is coming down and says Adam &gt;&gt; Adam &gt;&gt; where are you what condition are you in &gt;&gt; do you realize what you have just done &gt;&gt; says father I'm running away said why are you running away I'm naked who told you that you were naked but God in his mercy &gt;&gt; is covering every single one of us this morning regardless of our mistakes, &gt;&gt; regardless of our sin, &gt;&gt; that's why saints sometime we don't grasp these things. God has done so much for you and I that we should never even stand and complain. &gt;&gt; We should live a life of thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; You know, there are people that hear the word, they laughing, it's because they don't know. But when God brings you to the place to realize what my Lord has done, &gt;&gt; saints, it will make you live differently. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It would change your work. &gt;&gt; It would influence everything that you're doing. &gt;&gt; Because you came to the understanding that this I I don't deserve to even have my clothes on. &gt;&gt; I don't even deserve to have a job. But he decided even in the midst of my mistakes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He came down. He says, "You know what? I will give you a job. &gt;&gt; I will give you a good health." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May we worship God for the rest of our life. Right? Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now they kick him out. They go, you know, and that path, that way to the tree of life was blocked. But later on, God spoke to Moses. He says, "Moses, I want you to build a sanctuary for me." And Moses built the sanctuary after what he sought in the mount. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Moses seeing the tabernacle in heaven, &gt;&gt; God told him, "Go on earth and reproduce that." &gt;&gt; And he comes, he reproduces exactly that way. But there is something that was similar. You know, whatever Moses did in the in the in the in the wilderness, that's a picture of what was happening in heaven. &gt;&gt; So now Moses comes and he divide that part into three, that tabernacle into three. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So he put the outer courts. So the outer courts if you enter, I don't know if uh uh do you still have my picture on the on the temple, please? I love images. But just to help me a little bit here, &gt;&gt; you know, if you enter, you see the outer court. &gt;&gt; Anybody had access into the outer court. &gt;&gt; The same sun that was shining. Everybody could access the outer court and play around the outer court. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. Thank you, sir. You would enter here. This is the outer court. Anybody can play here. This is exposed to the outside, the sun. In other words, the zodiac. Right? The moon, the stars is exposed to this light. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All of us are coming to church. We are under the influence of the outside part here. &gt;&gt; The body you influence from your friend and all of these the negative things are happening here because this is representing you as well &gt;&gt; because you are a body, a spirit and a soul. &gt;&gt; So the man that enters here, there is the breast and altar. the place that they killed an animal, &gt;&gt; right? They killed an animal. Now Jesus Christ is a lamb, right? &gt;&gt; You can't see that Jesus this means also Calvary. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he had to be killed here. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; This is the lava where they will wash the the high pri the priest and stuff, right? &gt;&gt; And there is a veil here, you know, uh the door. It's called the door. I think probably the gates, the door and then the veil if I'm not mistaken. But if you enter here, the only the priest would enter there &gt;&gt; into that second part, right? &gt;&gt; But when it comes to this part here, because this is working based on the light of the candlesticks, which is here, &gt;&gt; right? Of course, this part here is completely covered, &gt;&gt; but the light here is the light of the candlesticks. But here there is a light of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; But to enter here there is a veil. &gt;&gt; It says no man can enter into this place &gt;&gt; because it was the place that the shana glory will come down. &gt;&gt; The place where the the the the pill of fire will come down. No man had access there. In other words, God was here. &gt;&gt; No man had access into God. It was blocked and this veil was covered with cherbins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The veil there had images of of of of of the cherbins. In other words, it was covered. It was protected. God says no man can enter here. In the same way when Adam was kicked out, he had no access to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; He was blocked for men too. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But it says only one man could enter who is the high priest. &gt;&gt; Only Aaron could enter once a year. But as Aaron is entering into that present, he had to wash himself. You cannot enter any type of way. Even if you are the high priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot enter without the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, YOU CANNOT JUST ENTER INTO the presence of God any type of way. &gt;&gt; It's not just God, thank you for everything done. No, &gt;&gt; it must be a way to enter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a way to enter with sincerity, with reverence, with fear. We don't enter any type of way. Then that's the light of the pillar of fire and only Aaron alone would enter. If the high priest does not enter the right way, they is going to die there. &gt;&gt; They will attach a string on him and pull him out because no man can access that place. &gt;&gt; It was also blocked. But who was going to enter? Even in the tabernacle of Solomon, it was the same way. That place was blocked. Let's go to the book of Hebrew chapter 9:2. How many of us love the Lord? &gt;&gt; We're just having a conversation. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's a prayer meeting as brother one says. So, we'll keep it simple. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And our title, I want to don't forget about this. the word. Behold the word in plain view. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 9 verse two. For there was a tabernacle made. Hebrew 9:2. For there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick. We saw that, right? &gt;&gt; And the table the shortbread which is called the sanctuary. And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all. You see that? &gt;&gt; And after the second veil, the tab uh the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holiest of all, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Verse four, which had golden sensor, and the ark of the covenant overlay round about with gold, wherein was the golden part that had mana inside now of the right of that that place, right? And wherein was the golden part that had mana and Aaron rode that bud and the the the the table of the covenant inside of the ark of the covenant. Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; And over it the cheruban of glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly. &gt;&gt; In other words, inside of the holiest of all is the the ark of the covenant. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And inside he had the road of Aaron, right? The mana. &gt;&gt; And also what what was the third one? Who was paying attention? There was the third the third things the the the the covenants the ten commandments &gt;&gt; but you know under that presence the mana could go couldn't go bad or rot because the presence of god was there was keeping it fresh even a dry stick was butting was burning under the atmosphere are you with me &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; so when you are in the presence of god into the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot go bad &gt;&gt; because you are actually feeling under that presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we got to get in &gt;&gt; into. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But let's continue. Let's continue the reading. Now the when these things were thus ordained, the priest went always into the first tabernacle, in other words, the holy place. &gt;&gt; Right? Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Acco accomplishing the service of God. Seven. But in the second, which is the holiest of holies, right? When the high priest alone once every year, not without the blood. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Which he offered for himself. &gt;&gt; Right. And for the heirs of the people. Let's continue. Watch now. What? I want you to catch this. Don't miss this. It says the Holy Ghost, this signifying that the way into the holiest of holies of all was not yet made manifest. In other words, the holiest of holies were not made visible. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because to be made manifest means that the veil was covering the God that dwells in the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; No man could access God. We saw that, right? Because he was blocked. &gt;&gt; It says made CONTINUE MADE MANIFEST WHY as the first tabernacle was yet what? Standing &gt;&gt; nine. Okay, that's fine. We can stop there. You see that everything was blocked. No man had access. But if we look in the scripture, one day there was a man called John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; He came into the world, right? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist was a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. According to Matthew Malachi chapter 3, &gt;&gt; John came and his his purpose on earth is his his ministry on earth was to introduce the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Now throughout the Old Testament, it was spoken of Jesus Christ. But John one day comes and by the Holy Spirit God told him. He says if you see a man coming, he gave him a sign. Says if you see a man coming, there is do on top of his head. He is the one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he came. He says, "Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world." &gt;&gt; That was Jesus Christ. So the word the logos what God himself had become man. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in the beginning was God &gt;&gt; right? And God in the in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God &gt;&gt; and the word became flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Flesh in what? In Jesus and dwell among us. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus came as the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; You see the pattern in Genesis. God had killed an animal that was just a shadow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But now in the real image of the the elements now Jesus is coming but he has to be introduced by a messenger. &gt;&gt; So when the word comes it must be a prophet on earth. as the word is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the principle because the messenger had to present the word to people. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND WHY JOHN SAID, "Behold the lamb of God." He had to point &gt;&gt; the people to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when he points the word to the people, the word was in what? In plain view. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was in plain view. &gt;&gt; Now in human flesh. &gt;&gt; But now if you look at the scriptures, the word came in human flesh and dwelt among them. But look how they acted when the word came to them. &gt;&gt; Saint, let me tell you something. The same word that came to John the Baptist, that same word is coming to you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a different Jesus. It's not a different God. is the same God but is appear in in the form of the word. Then it was the in the form of a man called Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that there's three dispensation. God the father, fatherhood, God above us. &gt;&gt; It cannot be touched. It's invisible. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WITH US. THAT'S EMANUEL. THAT'S Jesus Christ. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD in us IS IN THE WORD form in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now when we talking about Jesus, we're talking about the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word that you and I are listening, we are listening to Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now when the word is being revealed to you and I, it's easy for us to miss it. &gt;&gt; In the time when Jesus came, they saw a man dressing like the rest of them. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He had dust on his feet. They looked at him and say, "How can this man be called God?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Pharisee assaulted him, called him names, rejected him, laughed at him, mocked him. But yet the word was in plain view &gt;&gt; before them. &gt;&gt; But they were also a group of people that were part of the mind of God. When the word was passing by them, something in them triggered, not everyone. &gt;&gt; There were only those that God knew before the foundation of the world. When the word was passing by them, they felt something and said, "No, something is different." &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to catch this, Andrew. Let's look at a scripture, right, in the Bible. May the Lord help us. John chapter 1 verse 40 41. If they can have it really quick, so we'll go faster here. Now we will notice that the Bible says John uh 1:41 he first found his own brother Simon and said unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ that's Andrew find his brother Peter he says come see we have found this man called Jesus the Christ right and he brought him to Jesus and When Jesus beheld him, he said, "Thou are Simon, the son of Jonah, thou shall be called Cphus, which is by interpretation a stone." &gt;&gt; Automatically, what do you notice? The word made flesh begins to discern who Peter was. &gt;&gt; He knew his father Jonah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this might be a secret. Say, "How in the world did you know my father's name &gt;&gt; because the word must be identified? &gt;&gt; The m the Messiah must be identified by the way is dealing with things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; If we go down to Philillip 46 or 44. Now I want you to pay attention. Brother Brenham brings us something in the sign of the Messiah says now Jesus doing is going to the Jews making himself known. Now as soon as it taken place there was one named Phillip. He thought that was drilling. So around the mountain he went 50 miles and he found his friend of his by the name of Nathaniel. So the distance between Philillip and Nathaniel Bham says he was 15 miles away. &gt;&gt; So Philillip had an experience with the Messiah. He goes 15 miles away. He found Nathaniel on his knees closer to a tree praying. &gt;&gt; Nathaniel stand there is praying. Brother Benham says he did not want to bother him. And when he finished praying, he called him said Nathaniel, we just find the Messiah. He says, "Where is he from? Oh no, he's from Nazareth. Oh, is there anything good coming out of Nazareth?" Philip toss Nathaniel. He says, "Come and see." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come see by yourself. &gt;&gt; Brother Bren says, "That was the best answer that he could give him." &gt;&gt; Sometime we hear about Jesus Christ. But sometime we have heard about him from somebody else. &gt;&gt; That's right. But we have never come to experience him. &gt;&gt; Philillip knew what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; Nathaniel had no idea. &gt;&gt; So when they called him, he says, "Let me go see." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And when he got there, he told him that we have found Messiah. Verse 40 47. Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and said unto him, &gt;&gt; "Behold." Are you catching something similar here? &gt;&gt; It says, "Behold, an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile." In other words, you are a righteous man. &gt;&gt; Nathaniel said unto him, "Whence knoweth thou me?" Jesus answered said to him, "Before Philillip called thee, when there was under the fig tree, &gt;&gt; I saw you." &gt;&gt; For Nathaniel, there was &gt;&gt; saint God is doing things by through the word of God. Sometime we are missing it. Yes, &gt;&gt; I want to stop here just for a minute. God would minister to you about something. &gt;&gt; He will point something to you. You look at him say, "Oh, wow. This is God." &gt;&gt; But instead of going to see him, &gt;&gt; we are actually putting him aside &gt;&gt; and we even deny him when things are happening in our life. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, no. God never spoke to me, but he did speak to you." You just never paid attention to him. &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody your wife or your husband says, "Stop there. Be careful. Look at this." The word says, "Oh, no. That's your own opinion." &gt;&gt; But you don't know what spirit was behind that man or that woman to say it. &gt;&gt; Maybe it was the same Jesus Christ that was actually getting closer to you to speak to you about something that you've been asking him about. and he will use somebody to minister directly to you but you miss it and you say oh I never denied Jesus Christ I always went to church when when did I deny Jesus Christ because we think Jesus Christ is only in the building in the church &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ can be in the house &gt;&gt; at work so you can deny Jesus Christ in the place that you can never even imagine maybe as a One person, your friend say, "Are you a Christian?" Ah, no, no, no. I'm not a Christian. I don't believe that. You deny Jesus Christ's dead. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; You say, "I never the day of judge say, "Oh, no, no, no. I don't think I ever did. I mean, I'm a good boy. I went to church. I'm a good girl. I mean, I kept myself. I never drunk anything. No spoke." But I say, "You deny me." &gt;&gt; You know something that stood up always baffled me just for a minute? Peter denied Jesus Christ three times. Judas did once. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You think of it now. &gt;&gt; So that once can mean a lot more than you can ever imagine. &gt;&gt; You see why we have to keep our eyes on the Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jonah told Peter that Peter, I'm getting old. Are you with me? I'm getting I'm getting old, but there is a promise in the word &gt;&gt; that there's going to be a Messiah. MAY HE MAY NOT COME in my days, &gt;&gt; but my son Jonah, if you see this sign, &gt;&gt; I want you to be careful. That's the Messiah that is coming. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why saints as parents, the children may not understand everything, &gt;&gt; but there are things THAT WE MUST TO TELL THEM. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; We may not be there. But even if they at school, &gt;&gt; they will remember that. &gt;&gt; That's what the truth must be. Even if you hurt, &gt;&gt; you must tell somebody the truth. &gt;&gt; That little tiny truth &gt;&gt; can do a lot more than you can even imagine. &gt;&gt; Maybe your son or your daughter, they're going astray. Call them, sit with them, &gt;&gt; tell them about what God has done in your life. You said, "Listen, son. &gt;&gt; I was a sinner. &gt;&gt; Tell her, brother. &gt;&gt; I WAS A DRUG ADDICT. &gt;&gt; I was a womanizer. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING, I'VE been there. &gt;&gt; I've been there. &gt;&gt; But if you see me here is because of what God has done. &gt;&gt; So, let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; If you want to be successful like your father, glory to God. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL, look at me. I'M SITTING HERE AS AN EXAMPLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAR THEY WILL BE GONE. &gt;&gt; BUT if they look at your life and say, "No, I HAVE A FATHER." GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE WORK FOR MY FATHER. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAR I AM AWAY FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; THE VERY SAME GOD OF MY FATHER WILL COME TO rescue me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, one day, brother Brandham and Billy Paul, Billy Paul was working closer to his father. It happened that Billy Paul stopped going astray. Brother Brenham called him said, "Billy, come." He put his hand like this. He said, "Billy, this is hell and this is heaven. You are right here. You have to decide." Sometime children, let me say this, the young people, please listen to me. You have to make a choice. It doesn't matter how many your parents forces you to. You have to come up to that choice. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how holy your parents are. &gt;&gt; You have to make a decision yourself. &gt;&gt; It's not just going to church. &gt;&gt; Saints, I I'm talking about because I had to make a decision, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I had to make some tough decisions. &gt;&gt; Very hard ones. And that cost me a lot. &gt;&gt; There's nothing as a as a young boy, as a young girl, &gt;&gt; there's not a decision that you would make about Jesus Christ that will be easy. &gt;&gt; Let me just stop saying it because it's the truth. &gt;&gt; You will have to forsake your social media. &gt;&gt; You have to forsake your friends, &gt;&gt; your best friends, even your relationships. Sometimes &gt;&gt; you need to cut it off &gt;&gt; because of Jesus Christ. It's not easy. &gt;&gt; Those that have been there, they know what I'm talking about is the truth. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and sometime they will call you names. &gt;&gt; They would insult you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the very same people that insult you 10 years ago, &gt;&gt; they cannot stand today and do the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Since I'm I'm talking about from experience. I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. have gone in the trail that no way they can't find the way back. &gt;&gt; That's why sent when the Holy Spirit speaking. &gt;&gt; You must take heat to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't ever deny it. Say, "Oh, no. I I I don't care. &gt;&gt; One decision &gt;&gt; can the next hour or the next year can bring you to hell." Yes. &gt;&gt; And if you die also you make the right the right decision that can bring you to the presence of God by one single decision that you made. &gt;&gt; And every single one of us &gt;&gt; we have a responsibility to make decisional &gt;&gt; but who knows which one will be right &gt;&gt; and wrong. &gt;&gt; We don't know. &gt;&gt; But may God have mercy on us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; They get encountered that Philillip meets the word. Nathaniel the word discern what was is what he was doing in secret. His time in pray you know sometime you pray in secret. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. There is some secret prayer that God reward publicly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; There's some secret prayer when nobody sees. &gt;&gt; When you under the table, nobody can see you. &gt;&gt; But when it happens, &gt;&gt; God does it in public. &gt;&gt; Because the word discerns &gt;&gt; and the word is still discerning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Since even in this room this morning, there are people that prayed last night &gt;&gt; that God can change this sermon. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; I can assure you 100% there are people that prayed last night &gt;&gt; that had changed the course of my sermon. Yes, &gt;&gt; because the word of God discerns &gt;&gt; the same word in plain view doing the same thing. Not me. I'm a sinner except by grace. &gt;&gt; But it's the PROMISED WORD WHAT GOD had promised for this age. He must fulfill it. &gt;&gt; And he will use any anybody to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just because you are the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your desire, God can fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; One day there was a prostitute. How many of us love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Can we keep it simple like that? Right. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; All right. There was this woman, a prostitute, a fame woman. You say, "Brother Ariel, Jesus not even supposed to be talking to a woman of such caliber." But there was something in that woman that many priests did not have. &gt;&gt; She had heard of how you know I'll prove it to you that this woman know the word. She said it was promised that we will see these things &gt;&gt; while the priest in the the holy people of the day &gt;&gt; could not recognize the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; You see, it's not just coming to church. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation &gt;&gt; that God would give to you &gt;&gt; to recognize when the word is passing by. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham one day he was sitting he saw three men coming. &gt;&gt; They had dust on their feet. &gt;&gt; But when Abraham looked &gt;&gt; how did he know that one of them was Elohim in human flesh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Come, come. I'm going to wash your feet." You see, the seed of God will never miss the word when it's passing by them. &gt;&gt; You'll never miss it. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how how far away from God you are. &gt;&gt; You can be actually drinking alcohol, but when the word is passing by your table, &gt;&gt; you stop. You say that's the word. &gt;&gt; You take the bottle and throw it away. You say, "I'm going to follow the &gt;&gt; way." &gt;&gt; And I don't know about your story. Maybe I don't know how where God found found you. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; I don't know where God found every single one of us. Where were we? &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; Some people were probably drinking. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But God just came and spoke to your heart. And from that day, &gt;&gt; it changed. Oh my goodness. Amen. &gt;&gt; To me, he came to me in the parking lot. &gt;&gt; I was in the parking lot outside of the church. He came to me right there. And I sat down. I said, "What happened to me?" My older sister, Grace, came one day. She saw me crying in the car and asked me, "Are you crying?" I said, "I don't know. Something had happened to me that day." So I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; This is about Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But we thank the Lord for his grace. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; The Lord has been good to us by his grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; The woman says, "I know the Messiah cometh, which is called Christ. when he come he will tell us all things. He said, "Woman, give me water." And the conversation went on and on. He says, "We'll call your husband. I don't have a husband." Said, "Yeah, you did right. You had five. That's true. You had five. The sixth one, that's not your husband." She said, "No, no, no." When she saw the word, when she recognized the word, she ran away. He says, "Come and see. &gt;&gt; Come and see what the prophet have said." This is now the word is is in flesh right there before me. &gt;&gt; Say, you see this? The word is coming to you and I. No matter where you are, &gt;&gt; that woman was in the condition of prostitution. &gt;&gt; The word came to her in that condition. &gt;&gt; God is not calling you based on where you are now. Is looking at his position, your position in him. &gt;&gt; God not considering you based on your little mistakes there. He knows where you are. For the matter of fact, But when is dealing with your heart is calling you because he sees already the position that you would have. &gt;&gt; You see how strong the purpose of God is &gt;&gt; your condition. You might be sick but when God is looking at you say you heal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Gideon was so weak in this place where he's hiding from the Medionite and then he heard the voice says mighty men of valor. He thought like somebody else are you talking about somebody else? Who? Me? Me? &gt;&gt; He was in this position where he was so weak. &gt;&gt; But God called him based on the position that he saw of him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Maybe this morning you might be very unqualified. You say, "Brother, I don't I don't feel like I'm worthy of anything, &gt;&gt; but when the word comes to you, he calls you based on the position that he knows that you're going to be &gt;&gt; you're going to be." &gt;&gt; Grandma Bay, let me say this. &gt;&gt; I told you last time that I'm going to talk when I have the ability to talk. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is seeing your healing &gt;&gt; as a finished work &gt;&gt; that's what see &gt;&gt; don't look at the condition &gt;&gt; but look at the promise &gt;&gt; say what he said &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; so when you say what Jesus say is if if Jesus Jesus himself is saying it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may not understand situation in your life, &gt;&gt; but say what God said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's not you saying it. &gt;&gt; It's him saying it &gt;&gt; because that's his word. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But mix it with faith. &gt;&gt; Just mix it with faith. see it happen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let's go back to the the religious men of the day, the Pharisees. They call him They called him Bible. They call him names. &gt;&gt; They were blinded to see the reveal word for that day. &gt;&gt; Now, let me talk about spiritual blindness. It's very dangerous. You would rather be physically blind than spiritually blind. &gt;&gt; So in other words, when the word comes, you can recognize it. &gt;&gt; You will criticize the word of God. You will think, "Oh, this is brother one that is saying it. That's just his opinion." &gt;&gt; But if his opinion is in here, &gt;&gt; I would take his opinion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because that's not his opinion. &gt;&gt; That's the word. &gt;&gt; That's what I said basically. &gt;&gt; Are you catching what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word can come and say, "Brother, this is what the word said." Oh no, brother. I don't see it that way. Oh sister, this is the way the word require us to leave. Oh no, I don't see it that way. This is the word that we need to follow. The Pharisee came and called him Bezel &gt;&gt; and Jesus come and say no I'm going to start speaking in parable. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He begin to speak in parable. Before even he speaks in parable I want to draw something here. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now Jesus comes. He has a multitude of people following him. Right? &gt;&gt; Many people say wow this is the word. Wow, the word Jesus is the Messiah. Glory. Look at all the min the the miracle that are happening. They're all following him. Jesus said, "Are you guys sure?" He said to them one day, he says, "If you don't drink my blood and eat on my flesh, you cannot be part of me." The 70s said, "No, no, no, no, no, no. What are you talking about? Are you you think we're vampires here to eat one another or what?" &gt;&gt; But they missed him and left him. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says in the message the unveiling of God, he says there are things that will be said to stumble you. &gt;&gt; And God purposely make it happen. &gt;&gt; He will allow things to be said in a certain way that will get you offended &gt;&gt; because God is separating. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I still in the Bible, right? In the message, right? Am I still there? &gt;&gt; 70 people when they heard that, they left him. And Jesus turned to the 12, &gt;&gt; says, "Why don't you guys follow the 70?" &gt;&gt; Peter looks at you see when Peter opened his mouth, that was not this flesh Peter. It was a seed germ that spoke out of him to say where else can we go? &gt;&gt; Only you &gt;&gt; you have the word of eternal life. &gt;&gt; So it's not based on our trials. It's a matter of what? Revelation. &gt;&gt; Peter said, "No, you are the word. There's nowhere else to go." But let me shock you again. In the midst of those 12, there was still one that was a devil that had to hang a little bit longer. Judas had to be there. &gt;&gt; For the matter of fact, to fulfill the word, Judas had to be there to betray him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? In the back part of God's mind, he saw a lamb being slain. &gt;&gt; But the the lamb had to be crucified. But there must be somebody that would do it. &gt;&gt; Do you see the plan of God? &gt;&gt; Somebody had to deny him and and betray him so that the word can be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message end says something. I'm just going to paraphrase. is reading the book of uh uh of of of Luke when Jesus was crucified if I'm not mistaken. Yes. Luke 23. It says there they crucify him. Are we are we together? &gt;&gt; There they crucify him. Brother Brennham says there where what he says there. It says there is was the most holy city in the world which was Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; There that was the most holy city in the world. Jerusalem. They it says the religious the most religious people the most religious what the Pharisees they could trust them where they came from &gt;&gt; but they are the one that crucified the word of God the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; To crucify means the most sinful death you could ever imagine. Let me say it this way. There's always pictures of Jesus covered. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He was crucified naked &gt;&gt; without clothes on. I mean, some people are being shocked. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; And exposed before everyone naked on the cross for you and I. the the most shameful death that could ever strip him, kill them based on the public capital punishment, condemned by the people that he came to save. But yet the word of God was still in plan view. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word was in plain view exposed naked. Even in that condition, there was one man, one of the malfactors, a chief that was on the right side or on the left, I can't remember. The other one said, "Oh, no, no, no, no. If you are really God like you know calm down you know you can speak this word you know all of that right but one say said no don't say it we are all guilty we've done we have done wrong &gt;&gt; but this guy is right this man is just how did he know that Jesus was just &gt;&gt; or was right because of the sour &gt;&gt; the thief at the cross saw the fountain in that day &gt;&gt; amen He met the word &gt;&gt; while the word was being crucified and exposed naked. &gt;&gt; So even in our generation when people are crucifying the word, &gt;&gt; you still have the chance to meet the word in that condition. &gt;&gt; Let me say something that will shock you. &gt;&gt; There are many things going on on internet. You don't know that the seed of God. There's some people that never heard of William Brandon &gt;&gt; until they heard something negative and they really wanted to know. &gt;&gt; They went to dig and say, "Oh, who is this person really?" &gt;&gt; But when they stop following the word, &gt;&gt; they say no, this is the truth. &gt;&gt; So God is using people. It seems to be negative &gt;&gt; but yet God is doing something. &gt;&gt; There are people that are being saved in the midst of that. The world is being crucified on one end. The other way people are being saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The word was at the cross exposed naked in plain view. the king of glory. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But while he was being crucified at the cross, something happened in the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me that same picture again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus the word is exposed naked on the cross. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But as he is dying over there, he said, "It's finished. &gt;&gt; I have fulfilled what I intended to do." Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And this veil rented from the top &gt;&gt; to the bottom. &gt;&gt; That was a very tall I mean it was a a big veil. is to show you it was not a man handling the veil to be rent. &gt;&gt; That's was God of heaven that rented that veil. &gt;&gt; Why did he rent the veil? Because there was now blood &gt;&gt; available for you and I &gt;&gt; to enter into that place &gt;&gt; and be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now the mercy seat, glory to God, is now in plain view. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word that was hid &gt;&gt; from people, &gt;&gt; the word now is in plain view. &gt;&gt; Anybody can now access. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Brother Benham says in a message earnestly contending for the faith preached in 1953. It says now in that day God guarded the tree that keep them from getting in getting it. And now the sword. Oh, glory to God. The sword that the the the cheruban the angel was holding. Brother says the sword is turning right back the other way, &gt;&gt; running them right into the tree &gt;&gt; so that they will receive the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. driving people, hurting them up to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The sword that hindered them to enter, &gt;&gt; the same sword has turned the other way &gt;&gt; is pointing you back now to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Why is he POINTING YOU BACK? BECAUSE the mercy seat is in plain view. &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT WAS NOW IS IN PLAIN VIEW. YES. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It says in another message, the the true vine preaching 1956, it says, "Oh, in other word, I am the tree of life from the garden of Eden. And if they eat of the tree of death, they die. If they eat of the tree of life, they leave." It says the Holy Spirit guarded the tree of life until the atonement was made and now the Holy Spirit is running the people to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It says Adam and Eve was trying to get the tree of life. Now the children are trying to stay away from the tree of life. Adam desired to have the tree of life. &gt;&gt; It says today people are running away from the tree of life. &gt;&gt; So the sun has turned to point you to the tree of life &gt;&gt; and people are running away. &gt;&gt; Our ancestors the patriarch they desire &gt;&gt; to all glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They desired &gt;&gt; to be partakers OF THAT TREE OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; But you and I, WHY ARE WE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE TREE OF LIFE? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It says the Holy Spirit was guarding it, right? It says now it's bringing them to it and they refuse to hear the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit's voice because the same adversary that caused them to sin in the beginning is keeping them away FROM THE TREE OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The same Satan that caused you to enter to sin &gt;&gt; is keeping you also away &gt;&gt; to return back &gt;&gt; to that tree of life. &gt;&gt; What is that tree of life? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why saint we want to see Jesus &gt;&gt; and his program &gt;&gt; when the word is in blind view. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Brother Benham says something in Hebrew chapter uh chapter 2 second part it says the Bible said he ascended on high right this is after the veil had rented. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He ascended on high and give gift unto men. There was an atmosphere. Watch this. Watch this saints. It says there was an atmosphere hang over the earth and darkness and gloom and death and weary. The prayers could not come up because the atonement was not made. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Even our prayer were hindered. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he broke through the veil. &gt;&gt; He opened up the way. HE BROKE THE VEIL OF SICKNESS. &gt;&gt; He broke the veil of sin. He broke the veil of weary. He broke the veil of depression. He broke every veil &gt;&gt; and made an eyeway from the wayfair men fearing men walking up the king &gt;&gt; highway. &gt;&gt; So your sickness, your depression, &gt;&gt; whatever you can call it, &gt;&gt; that veil was broken. &gt;&gt; Let me bring it home a little bit. He rented the veil &gt;&gt; of what is keeping you off from the God's blessing. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He broke the veil of that keep YOU OFF OF GOD'S JOY. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Of God healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He broke even the veil of depression. Yes, &gt;&gt; of anxieties, &gt;&gt; OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, &gt;&gt; OF CANCER, &gt;&gt; OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, &gt;&gt; DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, and all of it, even generation curses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what our family will do. But the power when he broke that veil, the veil means flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; He give access &gt;&gt; for you to actually s let me say this. If you believe the Lord Jesus Christ, there's nothing that he cannot break. &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If those things are still lingering, means that we need more grace. Lord, help me. I need to read more. There's something somewhere. Something is off somewhere. &gt;&gt; May God help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now God I'm entering into and I'm going to close. Are are you with me? &gt;&gt; But now this is the part where God now he promised God has given us a promise. Jesus paid the price. Right? &gt;&gt; That's one part of of redemption. Redemption is paying the price. If you have lost something because Adam lost the title deed, right? He he lost his position. But now the requirement was death. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But Jesus Christ died, right? Instead of you dying because you were a sinner, &gt;&gt; he died for you instead. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He opened that channel so your prayer can be answered. &gt;&gt; That's one part of paying the price is one part of redemption. &gt;&gt; There's another part of redemption that has to do with claiming. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; So he has to come the second time to claim what he had already paid the price for. &gt;&gt; SO IF HE PAID THE PRICE FOR YOU, this is the time that is coming to claim you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To say this is the blood that was shed, this these are the the the requirements that it required death. I died already, &gt;&gt; but I I'm coming now to claim them. But now to claim these people, you must have a powerful word. It must be the same word in plain view &gt;&gt; to bring you back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, God, the same way he did for the first coming, he's doing it for the second coming. &gt;&gt; The first coming, he came to pay the price. &gt;&gt; The second coming has to do with the rapture. God. &gt;&gt; But now between now and the rapture, there are things that he has to do. The same thing he did, right? &gt;&gt; Because the end of that first coming was his death. &gt;&gt; How many of us agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And for the second coming, the end of it will be THE RAPTURE OF THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; But before that, Jesus was still operating. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He was still revealing himself to people. Now, there is a promise here I want you to read to read with me. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you give God a hand to clap, please? He's worthy. He is worthy to be to be praised. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 17. We We coming down. Still bear with me. Still here. &gt;&gt; All right. Matthew 17:10. And the disciple asked him saying, "Why then said the scribe that Elias must come first, right? Must first come." Uh can you can you go back a little bit? Verse 10. Okay. And the disciple asked him saying, "Why then the scribes said the scribe that Elias must first come?" Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The following one. &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Shall first come and restore what? &gt;&gt; All things. Are you with Are you with me? But they said unto you, but I said unto you, Eli Elias is come already. So who is he referring to? &gt;&gt; John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are you seeing that right? &gt;&gt; And they knew him not. &gt;&gt; So there is a prophet. There's a Elijah that will come. Not everybody will recognize him. &gt;&gt; Right? Is that a word? &gt;&gt; So John came but they didn't recognize John. It says they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them. &gt;&gt; Then the disciple understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. So now Jesus himself is saying there's going to be an Elijah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the word of Jesus? &gt;&gt; It says I know Elias has come which was John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; But he's saying here there must be another Elijah that will restore what? All things. &gt;&gt; So the promise of Malachi 4 is not something that we thinking in our mind. No, it is in the word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It is in the word. &gt;&gt; Now Elias when it comes because the spirit of Elijah comes five times. God used the man dies but the spirit remained. So he used the spirit of Elijah five times. &gt;&gt; It was Elijah the tishbite. Right? When he was raptured, he Elisha received the double portion of his spirit. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And then John the Baptist is also Elias. Right? &gt;&gt; And then if you read Genesis chap I mean Revelation chapter 11, he speaks of another one. But between John the Baptist and the Elijah of Revelation chapter 11, there is another one that has to come for the gentle people. &gt;&gt; You see that? Now when WE COME TO MALACHI chapter 4, let's read it &gt;&gt; and we will tie Malachi 4 to Luke 17:30 &gt;&gt; and Revelation chapter 10:7. We will tie all of these things for a purpose of restoration of all things &gt;&gt; because God want you to receive the same authority &gt;&gt; but it must be a message &gt;&gt; that will be so POWERFUL TO SEEK THE world to bring you back to that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Malachi chapter 4 verse 5. Behold, you see behold again. &gt;&gt; Pay attention. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you good shepherd fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the dreadful day of the Lord. When John the Baptist came, there was not judgment day, right? You see that? &gt;&gt; This has to do with what will happen after us here. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a judgment. &gt;&gt; He shall turn the heart of the father to the children and the heart of the children unto the father, lest I come to spite the earth. Are you seeing that? Revelation chapter 10 where we read verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when is begin to sound the mystery of God that's singular there is something I was reading is this the end time the end of of time brother Brandham in 240 a paragraph 240 something down going down he's sewing the mysteries of God, right? It stopped bringing up the mysteries of God, the mystery of the kingdom, the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation, you know, all of these things because throughout the ages, people begin to baptize in the name of the father, son, and the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; But the Elijah here has to restore all things. &gt;&gt; So in the middle of the church ages, people stop preaching things that was contrary to the word. Are you with me? But now the ministry of Elijah is to come to bring us back in line &gt;&gt; because you cannot be restored if you don't know the full truth. &gt;&gt; Because the restoration is the power. &gt;&gt; You you see what I'm saying? You cannot be you cannot be brought back if you don't know what had happened, what had caused men to fall. &gt;&gt; Are are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. But now if you read in revelation chapter 10:7 it says it as a single mystery. Are you with me? is saying it here in in in singular but in many messages but they're going to put it in peril. Why? Because there is a single mystery the all this mystery are sum up into one mystery and that mystery is Jesus Christ. So once Jesus Christ opens up to you, when the word is in in full view, you understand his plan. &gt;&gt; Are are you with me? &gt;&gt; So the word when Jesus Christ is open to you, it shows you what was his intention, what had happened in the garden of Eden, the things that we know, the mystery truth that we know that he wasn't an apple, &gt;&gt; right? These are the things that bring us back to the knowledge of God. &gt;&gt; You see, oh wow, I know now what had happened. I know my enemy and I know my savior. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because the truth set you free. &gt;&gt; It must be a full truth for you to realize. &gt;&gt; Let me bring something here just to add. When you look at the life of Elijah, Elijah when he went to more car, the people were between two opinion. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You the you you read the Bible, right? &gt;&gt; The people were between two opinion. There's one thing that Elijah did. Elijah did what he did is he restore the altar, right? He restored the altar and then he told the people if God literally do this thing then you guys should believe it, right? Because They were between opinion. They didn't know what to choose. &gt;&gt; But when the fire fell, the heart of the people would turn to God. &gt;&gt; So the fire that falls change our heart. &gt;&gt; Now if you look in the tabernacle, there is the breast altar, there is the lav, and then if you enter later on, you see the fire of God. You see that, right? We spoke about it. Now when Elijah begins to rebuild the altar, he had a altar made of bricks. But around the bricks, if you read the Bible, around it, he had waters pour around it, which is in the form of this. &gt;&gt; But the last part is when the fire came down and burned the sacrifice. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE SACRIFICE WAS BURNED AT THE ALTAR, then the heart of the people &gt;&gt; will turn to God. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; So there must be a message that will cause us to return to God. &gt;&gt; So God has to fully reveal himself first. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Do do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. God again in our midst he will do the same thing that's why sometime when we see things happening in the ministry of brother Bham is to let us know that this is the word again how many people have criticized him but yet the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; for a purpose because according to Luke chapter 17 let's read it and we're going to close there do you love the &gt;&gt; Lord Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to close there. &gt;&gt; But before I close there, brother Bam says something loudian church 8. He says, "Now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 is going to do to do two things." Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It says one, according to Malachi 4, he will turn the heart of the children to the fathers. &gt;&gt; That's the first thing. Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; It says two, he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelation contained in the seven seal. He will be this divine mystery truth. So the mystery truth right &gt;&gt; is those mystery truth that will literally turn your heart to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if those mystery truth are not revealed, your heart will not be turned. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So we need a message. We need an Elijah &gt;&gt; with a message to turn our heart back to God. &gt;&gt; Then we can see God clearly. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we cannot be turned until the fire of the Holy Ghost comes and burns sin out of us. The there must be a fire &gt;&gt; saint. Once again, the word is working in our midst. The same word in full view. &gt;&gt; There was few days ago I've been having this kind of experiment experiences you know in the prayer meeting different things start happening and I was just praying about this. I'm like Lord what does this thing means? Those that are there, they know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; God is doing things in the most simplest way &gt;&gt; because our religion just stopped here at church. But God is doing more outside of this building. &gt;&gt; Even when it cames to the ministry of brother Bernham, the third pool, you would realize most of them were happening outside of the church. &gt;&gt; It happened with &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah, &gt;&gt; it happened with his wife that had a a growth on on her outside of the church. So say let me say this in closing. &gt;&gt; God is in full view in plain view but revealing himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; God is working in silence and when when we are not even in church &gt;&gt; God is working. How many of us &gt;&gt; have seen the word in plan view? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever. He has given you a message and he begins to disclose his secrets to you. He start telling you the mystery that was hid from the foundation of the world because there is a purpose. You as the bride of Jesus Christ, you have something to do before we leave this earth. You have a ministry. &gt;&gt; The bride would have a ministry. But we have to look in the word. We have to see Christ in this program. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall we stand? Shall we stand? Oh, glory to God. We trusted the Lord that this can be of a blessing. Be so sweet to trust in Jesus. Be so sweet to trust in Jesus. Just to take him at his word. us to rest upon his promises. Just to thus &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; I have proved him more. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus pray. &gt;&gt; All for grace to trust. &gt;&gt; Oh, sweet trust in Jesus. Just to truth his cleansing blood and he simple faith to lead the link. Jesus, Jesus, &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; how I prove the more Jesus. Jesus, &gt;&gt; blessed Jesus. Oh, for grace to trust him more. Yes, it's sweet to trust in Jesus &gt;&gt; just from sin and to sin just from Jesus taking life and rest and joy. Jesus, Jesus, &gt;&gt; Jesus, Jesus. How I trust him. &gt;&gt; How prove oh Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus. Oh, for grace to trust him more. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad. Oh, I learned to trust him. &gt;&gt; Preious Jesus, Savior, friend.

How many of us are willing to trust the Lord? Saint, we have a lot of different things going around us, but we want to leave this building tonight, this afternoon to trust him. We don't know what will happen the next hour, the next day, the next year, the next month, but we must trust him in everything that we're going through. We want to see Jesus &gt;&gt; and his program. &gt;&gt; Even when the enemy come, you need to look at Jesus &gt;&gt; and his program. &gt;&gt; Can we trust Jesus tonight? &gt;&gt; Who promised to trust him no matter what? Lord, I promise to trust you. &gt;&gt; Shall we pray? Gracious heavenly father, we want to thank you this afternoon for your grace and your mercy. Father, thank you for this word.
