And we want to pray and [music] ask that uh he will continue to work his work in our life, in our [music] midst, in our family and uh in our assembly.

This devil will not keep stop fighting God's people. Amen. And we will not stop fighting. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We will not stop fighting. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's uh read uh 2 Samuel. 2 Samuel chapter uh 23. Praise to the Lord. Second Sunday, chapter 23. We started this little talk on on Davis Mand on Sunday. And then uh I was thinking uh uh I had this thought as I was uh meditating on the service. I was just thinking about the way that God look at might. The way that God look at might. As humans, we look at might with the measures of muzzles and heights. &gt;&gt; But God look at might a complete different way. Amen. &gt;&gt; He told Gideon that he was a mighty man of Gideon couldn't see no might in himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then he had to test God and test God and test God. God look at might in a complete different way &gt;&gt; in a complete different way. I was thinking about it and says uh what God the way he look at things is just completely different. &gt;&gt; You know he told he told Samuel man look at the outward I look at the heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; I look at the heart I look at I look at you know deeper than the heart. Let's read tonight so I wouldn't keep you standing and let's see how the Holy Spirit will minister to us tonight. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's read uh verseh 15. Verse 15. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How would you get it? Let's read from verse 13 a little bit. And three of the 30 chief went down. And David came in the harvest time onto the cave of uh Adelon. And the troop of the Philistine page in the valley of Rafim. And David was then inhold. And the garrison of the Philistine was then in Bethlehem. And David and said, "Oh, that I oh that one will give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate." And the three mighty men break through the horse of the Philistine and drew water out of the word of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless, he will not drink thereof. I thought he said he wanted to drink. And after those men risk their life, he will not drink the water. Praise the Lord. Why he did that? Why David did that? Well, I get to heaven. I will ask him. But let's let's let's just finish the scripture yet. Amen. and that the three mighty men break through the host of the Philistine and drew water out of the word of Bethlehem that was by the gate, the exact place he spoke about, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless, he would not drink thereof, but pour it out unto the Lord. And uh he said, "Be a far from me, oh Lord, that I should do this. Is not this the blood of the man? What is the blood? The water. Praise the Lord. What is the blood? The water. Is not this the blood of the man. The very water that he desired to drink, he called it the blood of the man. Is not this the blood of the man that went in japot of their life? Therefore, he would not drink these things did the three mighty men. Let's pray. Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask tonight, oh God, that you would come and uh just bless this little thought to our hearts. Father, God uh we dwelling on the inspiration from your prophet that David desire was a command to this man. Oh God, I pray tonight, Father, Lord, that your desire will be our command. &gt;&gt; But Lord, it have to be a revelation, Lord. Father, because David never told this man, you go get me water. &gt;&gt; You only said, "I wish I could get water from that well." So, Father, we pray tonight that we find your internal thoughts as we fellowship with God. And Lord, the Holy Ghost can can can minister to your people in depths, Lord. Your Holy Ghost can speak to your people, Father, Lord, far away from what the preacher is saying and just bring the word home to our individual life. I pray let it be tonight. Father, in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. You can have your seat. Thinking about this, I also thought about our Lord Jesus. Here is David. uh uh uh wanting water, you know, he's just expressing it. When you read the scripture yet, the Bible says the Philistines uh uh David was in a garrison of the Philistine was then in Bethlehem. So Bethlehem was completely captured by the Philistines. It was completely captured. It was it was it was uh uh uh uh yeah it was under the control of the the Philistines. And uh uh I will also think in my mind that David never thought that this man was going to do that. He never thought about it. And I will also believe in my mind that those men never told David that we are going to bring you water. Just wait for us. We coming back. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because if if David year is pouring this water out, he will have told those men, don't risk your life. &gt;&gt; I'm just only thinking about it. I'm just I'm just I'm there's just something I'm saying. I really don't I can drink the water we have here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know, as I was thinking about this, as I was thinking about this, uh, I thought what actually was on my mind was, uh, I even had to how to go and play brother Brandon tape on the thirst. I was thinking about our Lord Jesus there on the cross expressing that he was thirsty. Here's the creator of heaven and earth, the one that make water saying I'm thirsty. The Bible says he said there that the scripture will be fulfilled. And we know that uh David said they gave him vinegar and uh but I believe there there is there is more to them. There is more to death. So as we look at this a little bit tonight, I want us to look at uh uh look at the the inspiration thirst and uh uh in the sense that the uh his desire being our command. Think about that. That is that is a very very very strong thought. His desire was a command to those men and thirst is a desire. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thirst is a desire. Now what is God desire for us? What is his desire for us for this age? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is his desire of bringing us together under the message of the hour? Is it to start another denomination or uh you know uh uh uh or just to live for uh William Brandon? I don't believe that's God's desire. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that that uh that that is his desire. Let's let's look at a scripture over in St. John chapter 7. Praise the Lord as we just develop this together because I was thinking on all of this and uh uh I couldn't get my notes properly together. Hallelujah. Now verse 37. This is this is a familiar scripture. St. John chapter 7 verse 37. At the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, &gt;&gt; saying, "If any man thirst, &gt;&gt; let him come unto me and drink." Praise the Lord. Amen. He that believeth on me, as the scripture have said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. Now listen to this. Now the Bible says, "But this speak he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive. For the Holy Ghost was not yet given. The Holy Ghost was not yet given. But Jesus is saying is in you. It will flow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He just needed to turn the tap. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But he's already telling them, it's in you. &gt;&gt; God. out of your belly will flow rivers of water. So if his thirst, if he had a thirst, it was not for a Roman glass of water. He was thirsting. &gt;&gt; When Jesus on the cross said, "I thirst." He was thirsting from the water that would come out of your belly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he have already said it here. If you believe in me according to the scripture, out of your belly will flow rivers of water. That's what he said. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this he speak of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive. So right THERE ON THE CROSS AS HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP THE GHOST, he was also DESIRING THAT THAT SPIRIT THAT DWELLETH IN HIM, the spirit that performed the miracle that healed the sick, HE WAS DESIRING TO SEE that in his disciples. &gt;&gt; He was desiring to see that in the believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when HE SAID I THIRST, I'M LONGING. I HAVE A DESIRE. I have a desire. Praise the Lord. He was expressing a desire of seeing rivers of water flowing out of our belly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of our belly. That's that's uh that's the tank of our life. &gt;&gt; Rivers of water flowing out of our belly. Speaking of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are you seeing are you seeing the thought of of what I'm going through tonight? Amen. If if uh if David will express that, he's just saying it knowing that the the the whole city is taken over by the the the the the Philistines and he's just walking back and forth. I like the way that brother Brandon said it. I'm going to share that with you tonight. Uh uh he said David was just pissing, you know, going back and forth. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was just he was just pissing going back and forth. Praise the Lord. He was just going back and forth and and just and just talking to himself, you know, he was not he was not actually talking to those guys and says, "Oh man, man." Yeah. Hand is taken by these Philistines, these uh uncircumcised men. Oh my. How I just wish remember that that well down there just talking by himself you know and he said there now the Bible says when they brought him the water he says uh this is the blood of this man. So what I want what I saw in this is that um it was beautiful that uh the the how the word the water and the blood. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The word that David spoke, oh that I would get water from the well of Bethlehem. And the man went and brought the water. And David said, "No, I'm not going to drink it because this is their blood." Because they put their life on the line. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that was that was just that was just beautiful. Just beautiful just thinking about it. But let's uh let's let's just uh uh uh read some few things brother Brandon said here from the message just as we as we look at this together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Abraham said this. He said he says uh I was looking and thinking about the word test. So I look up in the dictionary to see what it means. And here this uh uh and here is what Webster says is a painful desire. a painful when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you want something so bad until it becomes [crying] painful, you know, James says when we ask, we ask in the midst. &gt;&gt; We just ask. Praise the Lord. We ask in the midst is is it means that it does not come from a place of a painful desire. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Or a a gain in a sense that uh I mean you have you already have you just want another one. &gt;&gt; And if you don't have that other one, you won't mind anyway because you already have it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he says many times that's the that's the way we act. Praise the Lord. But you see uh uh uh uh like the Bible says the Lord will will give the desires of our heart and the Bible says uh uh you know uh uh he search the intents of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows how much level of pain when the heart gets in that it becomes so desperate. You just think about what a painful desire it was to Hana wanting a child so bad that right in the in the sound like she don't she didn't care who was listening to her or what they were think about her. I mean, it was just so so so bad. &gt;&gt; I believe that was now her first time praying on that request, but this time it was different. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This time it was different. &gt;&gt; It was it was it was different. It was a a a kind of a pain that can be compared to a pain of a mother that is in travel. that brother Brandon would call birth pains. [snorts] Praise the Lord. He says it's a painful desire. When you want something so bad, but I like I said, I don't think that David wanted that water so bad or else he was going to drink it. But I believe that uh uh uh the the the Holy Spirit give us that record for our own benefit. And that's the reason why a prophet can bring it to us this way that his desire was a command today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And our Lord had a desire before he left this earth. He expressed it, I'm thirsty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we bring him water? &gt;&gt; Can we be able to break the garrison of the Philistines or the garrison of Laodisha with all the things that Laudisha has put around us? Are we able to break through to be able to bring water to our thirsty Lord? No matter what life throws before us, are we able to break through? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we are we really seeing his need? David was David never had nails in his hands. The Bible say he was in a hole. He was he was in a cave. WELL, YEAH, HIS LIFE ALSO was in danger, but he was not in pain like our Lord. So, so, so Jesus expressing that because it's a painful desire. It was not just only the the thirst of a a dry throat, but it was the thirst that was also missed with with pains in his hands and and and pains in his legs and pains from the from the whip on his back. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I was listening to brother Brownley in that message. He was talking about when when when a deer is is is wounded. He says all he needs is just to get to a river and just drink some water to be able to help regulate the blood in his body so he can take off and run. And that's what I was thinking about. Seeing what our our age is, seeing what our city in Minneapolis is, seeing what our what good shepherd is. Can we bring him water? Because he say out of your belly. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The water that he wanted to drink was that uh uh the Roman soldier water. For the matter of fact, it never even given to him. They gave him vinegar. I believe his thirst was for that living water that would soon burst 40 days after that was going to burst and flow out of the belly of his believers, of his disciples. &gt;&gt; And I believe we we have that savior. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have we have a we have a fountain of living waters that is that is in us. You know I was talking to a good friend good friend uh uh many years back he used to be our song leader very good friend. He called me this morning maybe around 500 a.m. I seen his call on my phone and wondering oh my god what's going on? So I didn't pick the phone and he called me back again. I didn't pick the phone call because I was I was I was uh praying and just preparing myself for the day. And uh so I call him later and then we talking you know I uh you know from one thing to another and he says uh uh uh how's the church? I said no church is doing good. The Lord been the Lord's been gracious to us and we doing okay. So I asked him I says I says how's the church on your hand? He said no there's no church here. I said why there's no church there? said, "No, because there's no church here." I said, "So, I mean, why are you there and there is no church there?" He says, "Well, I'm not a minister." I said, "You have to be a minister for the church to be there." "Well, I I don't have a ministry." I said, "What do you call a ministry? What What are you calling a ministry? Are you not a child of God? Are you telling me that you are not a child of God? Are you telling me that you are not a son of God? &gt;&gt; You need what is called a ministry for you to have a church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you not a child of God? Are you not a son of God? And I rather put him on the spot this morning. I was I was just trying to pull his legs a little bit, but I I I I just went in there and I found myself, you know, just getting to him a little bit. I said, "So, you want to tell me you need a ministry to tell somebody about the love of Jesus? You need a ministry to tell somebody that God has been good to you." I said, "No, don't tell me there, brother." I said, "No, no, no. Don't tell me there." I said, I said, "Do you see how how low we have brought this whole thing? How religious that we get? &gt;&gt; That we cannot even tell somebody about the goodness of Jesus because I don't have a ministry. So, I don't have a right to say it. &gt;&gt; I don't have a right to tell somebody of how much God has been good to me. I need a ministry. What we call ministry. What is that? What really it is? I think much of it I was listening to something that really it really it really made my mind so uh uh uh I forgetting the the guy that that wrote it uh an old preacher and it really so my thought on that what what what really it is. It's just a platform where uh we promote ourselves sometimes and many times or the platform where we just we just uh hide ourself. I mean ministry what what actually it is. &gt;&gt; God didn't give us ministry. He gave us life. &gt;&gt; He gave his life for us. And the baptisming of the Holy GHOST IS THE LIFE OF Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AND THAT'S WHAT THE WORD NEEDS. THAT'S WHAT THE WORD IS DYING FOR. THEY DON'T CARE WHETHER you are a bishop or whether you are a pastor. They have seen a lot of fake ones. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; What it NEED IS THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. That's what that's that's what the world needs. &gt;&gt; Need a MAN OR A WOMAN THAT KNOW THAT THEY ARE A SON OR A DAUGHTER OF GOD SAVED BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's what the word needs. Not somebody telling us of how long they been in the ministry and how long they've been preaching and all the things that they have done. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The good thing there is that how long no matter how long you have been, somebody has been longer than you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that was a good conversation this morning. So I just I just I had to I had to gather him quickly because We have not talked for a long time and he called me. It looks like I was just I was just shooting his legs. Amen. I had to gather him quickly. I said, "Oh, no, no. I'm not I'm not condemning you. You know, don't don't think that I'm condemning you. I'm happy I'm happy to hear from you, but for you to just tell me that I don't have a ministry." I said, "That took me off guard. I don't expect you to say that. I don't expect you to Uh even if even if there is no church, well there's not a message church here, but I'm going to a Pentecostal church. Tell me that you can't give me an excuse that because there is no message church here, I'm not a minister. Okay, that's for another day. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I mean uh uh uh uh uh uh uh that's that's that's exactly what is happening here. When our Lord expressed that uh that he was thirsted, I don't believe that he was looking for the water of Jerusalem. I believe he was looking for exactly what he said is in John chapter 7 because the Holy Ghost was not giving yet. And he knew just in 40 days, JUST IN 40 DAYS. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THAT FOUNTAIN OF WATER BURSTING OUT OF those people. AND PETER RUNNING RIGHT INTO THE STREET AND SAYING, "MAN, AND BRETHREN, REPENT. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T WAIT TO see it." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; WHEN ALL THOSE WOMEN, MARY, MAGDALENE, AND SOLOMON, and every one of them, they will go right into the upper room and HE'S GOING TO FILL THEIR GALLON AND FILL THEIR BUCKET AND FILL WHATEVER THEY TOOK THERE. Praise the Lord. and that will become the be the the the the birth of the church. So if his desire is a command to us, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; My question and thought tonight that I'm I'm trying to der on is that are we can are we are we ready to break barriers? Are we ready to to risk our life like those mighty men? Remember they were gentile men. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like I said Sunday, uh you know I I was just taking that from my from my own uh devotion and just exulting you on Sunday. But uh uh when you just think about it, just think about those kind of a people that were around around David. The Bible said they were distressed. They were in depths. It just it just described some of the things that we deal with EVERY DAY. BUT YET IN the midst of that, I would tell you that the scripture never waited for David TO COME IN POWER AND AND and for David to give those men their reward before the Bible called them mighty men. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Their position WITH DAVID, THAT'S PART OF THEIR LIFE SITUATION AND the things that they WERE GOING THROUGH. BUT their position with David Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEIR POSITION FOR THE WORD OF GOD, their desire to be able to do something for the kingdom, that's what God saw in them and called them mighty. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Their desire to do something FOR THE KINGDOM. WHATEVER IT IS, THEY they they really can't put their hands on it, but they want to do something to make sure that David comes back or David comes to the throne. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is that desire in them that God looks at and he says, "These men are mighty men." Praise the Lord. BECAUSE IT WAS THAT DESIRE THAT WILL make them to risk their life. It's that desire that will make them want to jump in in a HOLE WITH A LION ON A SNOWY DAY. IT WAS THAT DESIRE that will MAKE ONE TO FIGHT THOUSANDS OF MEN UNTIL HIS arm is tired, but he's still fighting. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just that desire to be able to do something for the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it is, but uh if God will be able to look look in our age today and looking for mighty men, they will not just only be the missionaries on the field. Because brother Brandham says sometimes &gt;&gt; the thing that make those men to accomplish great things, &gt;&gt; he said it's the housewife that's on her knees pray. &gt;&gt; He says it's the mother that is uh that is taking some time to fast and seek the face of God. That's right. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; They said we want to see the man on on the on the pulpit preaching or we we see the man on the field winning souls but there is somebody that is crying Lord &gt;&gt; save somebody. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And when God look down in our age, WHEN HE'S LOOKING FOR MIGHTY MEN AND MIGHTY WOMEN, it's not it's not just one that, you know, leave all her own responsibility, put Bible on her arm and walking all down the street trying to win souls. Well, if you have that grace, that's wonderful. We must also have a scripture to back it up. Amen. It's not just a a man or a woman that is just uh wrapped up and consumed in their zeal. Praise the Lord. Until they say things out of zeal and they don't they don't they don't even know what is coming from their mouth or whatever is coming from. They are just talking out of zeal. But it's that desire, it's that painful desire that says, "Lord, before my eyes closed on this earth, give me the grace to leave one soul to you. &gt;&gt; Let me have one soul on my account." &gt;&gt; Before I close my eyes and leave this word, Lord, I want to do something for you. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that thing constantly become a painful desire. Praise the Lord. Amen. Brother Bannon will go ahead and and and he will say [clears throat] praise the Lord. Let's continue to read. He said thirst is a natural thing. It's just simply something that God has given us that we could to give us a desire for something. God has always has given you a control tower, something that is set inside of you that control these different desires. This control tower that that sits in in a man's heart is something that God gave to warn him of the desire there's needful for him. Praise the Lord. Amen. Because he knows that the desire could be China. He He created that thirst. He created that channel in us for us to desire. Praise the Lord. Amen. like you know like sometimes I I when I when I'm talking to some young people I tell them I say uh uh uh in as much as is true that uh you know is is the man that will come and speak to the woman it does not take the desire of the woman to be able to want a good man. So that's the reason why she has the right to say yes or no. Why? because she also has a desire. Praise the Lord. For as much as is the man that is going TO PROPOSE, SHE ALSO HAS the right to say no. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or to say yes. Why? Because she has a desire. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God did not strip her of a desire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. But my father, he told Eve, "Your desire will be after your husband." So, Brother Bram said, "Yeah." So, God set a control tower in us just to be able to warn us because that desire COULD COULD BE SHIFTED for the wrong thing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That desire could be shifted for the wrong thing. And and and he don't want us to use it for the wrong thing. He want us to use it for the God-given thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when you think about it, you think about it, David right there speaking to his man and just and just saying it. I mean when we went through the whole story of how this man became David's mighty man. I mean I re I really enjoy sitting up in the night and just and just reading about it and just studing about it. More of that I will bring to you in in the future. But actually that that was what was on my mind. How God look at might. His strength is made perfect in our weakness. &gt;&gt; That's true. how he look at might when he says love the Lord with all of your strength. Praise the Lord. And not our abilities, people, not even our achievement. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; But it is something that he gave. It's something that God gave us. It's something that he deposit in our life. Praise the Lord. Wanting us to give it back to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just like I believe he was not thirsting after natural water. So I believe today that his thirst is for the young man or the young woman. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's for the young man, a young woman or uh uh for every one of us just like I said to bring forth that living water out of our life. that you have to remember Jesus called a living water. He said out of your belly will flow rivers of living water which mean it has to do with something with our daily life. Amen. Our everyday life just bringing something that will please him. Maybe it is not one of these uh big uh uh uh thing of uh you know uh uh getting a group of people to listen to you because you are testifying but some some sense of kindness. Praise the Lord. Sometimes they don't even have to be to strangers. Sometimes even the ones that is dear close to you, your wife, your husband, your your your children, brothers and sisters, some level of kindness h uh in a sense of of of of fellowship, something that uh you know you will that that that will be able to to to touch the life of the person. Maybe some kind of a for help or just a word of gratitude. Well, thank you. I mean, you you're being you I mean, you you really being there for me. I I appreciate it. I don't say it all the time, but I just want to tell you there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just like Solomon will say, he says good news from a distance. He says it's just like a cold glass of water. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good news. So you take it like that. Not only a good news, but goodness. &gt;&gt; Goodness from a distance. Goodness that is that is unexpected. &gt;&gt; GOODNESS THAT IS NOT BEGFUL BUT IT'S UNEXPECTED. When you can have that grace and that talk of the Holy Ghost just to go and estroise and say I just thought about you. Praise the Lord. that the person was just, "Wow, I I don't I don't I don't even feel like eating this. I just I just want to set it down on you." That's just what David did. I don't feel like drinking this. This man jeopardized their life for me. I just want to pour it down. I'll pour I I I'll give a drink offering to the Lord. Praise the Lord. Sometimes we we We overlook these things. Amen. We overlook the way we treat one another. We become so common to one another that we overlook the way we treat one another. The things we say to one another. It's so easy to say hurtful things than to say appreciative things. Praise the Lord. What we have to realize is his body. Is his body. God's people is his body. Praise the Lord. Amen. Your parents are part of that body. Your children are part of that body. Your spouses are part of that body. The people you come to church with are part of that body. Sometimes we overlook it. We are looking to great things. We are looking to, you know, what what we can do uh uh uh uh uh you know to be to be part of a mission work and to be part of all of those things are beautiful. The Lord will place it on your heart. But sometimes the mission field that is so close to us, the mission field right in our own house, the mission field in our own church. Praise the Lord. Amen. The mission field in our own church, we have a mission field in our own house to make sure our children have prayer life, to make sure they are reading the word and is to to be able to find that way to communicate it, that way to be able to capture them. Can you imagine that? He's looking for that fresh drink of water where it's so painful on your heart. You are just thinking, "How can I bring this? How can I bring this for my child to be able to grab it? Lord, get a hold of them before this word." Praise the Lord. Can you imagine what a feeling it brings to the father that you realize that right in your own house is a mission field. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Oh, because you hear those things very quickly. You hear it. So now we start to, you know, uh uh get out of order. Then we feel uh a little bit righteous than the other person. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We feel more spiritual than the other person. I see you're not even reading your Bible. You are not even praying. You are not even uh you know, what are we doing about it? Are we carrying a painful desire in our heart &gt;&gt; to be able to reach out to the ones that is around us or to be able to find another approach? Maybe I'm not going about it the right way. There's something that would bring pleasure to the father. Something that would quench a good news from a distance. The angel will be carrying a good news like brother Brandon would talk about the tutor carrying a news to the father and say your son he just break character today. That was not part of him since I've been knowing that boy to really take a day and say this day I'm fasting. He really broke character today. I'm telling you that your son really broke character. A good news from father become a cold glass of water to the father. Praise the Lord. He can look down and says yeah he have his he have his ways. She have She's having her ways. But there is just a heart. There is just a heart of sweetness. There is just a heart of service. Just a heart of service. Not doing it because I want some kind of a return. Doing it because I think it's the right thing to do. I don't do this all the time, but I just feel like I must do it today. Praise the Lord. You say whatever you want to say it about me, but I just feel like I must do it today. Praise the Lord. Or maybe I can go a little bit length, you know, calling the sister or calling the brother and says, "Well, uh, well, let's just meet for coffee this Saturday." Because most of the time when you call people the first thing that comes to their mind, what have I done? &gt;&gt; That's the first thing that comes to their mind. What have I done? Oh my god. This brother say you want to see me or this sister said you want to see me Lord Jesus. Then you start you start thinking that okay when we were in service the last time she was sitting there she look at me. Maybe maybe that's something she want to talk about. The way she was looking at my clothes and and your mind is just going all over the place. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. I just I just want to first I just wanted to visit with you. You see that kind of a sense of refreshment that it brings? You just, oh wow, oh wow, what a feeling. But what what what I want us to think about is that this is something that brings pleasure to the father because Jesus says out of us out of us will come living water out of us. It's in you. &gt;&gt; It's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in you because he put it there. It just at that time it could not be released. He had to go and go and turn the process on in in in heaven for it to be released. But it's in you. Kindness is in you. &gt;&gt; Forgiveness is in you. It's there. He put it there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Repentance is in you. Some of the things that you think is the difficult thing that you cannot do is dead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You have just only allowed a human nature THAT YOU GOT SO USED to to cover it, but it's there. Praise the Lord. Just spend a little time before the Lord. You will see you will take it away. You will not realize that. Oh wow. I thought I could never do this. &gt;&gt; I thought I could never do this. Oh my god. It's there. He put it there. &gt;&gt; ALMOST JUST LIKE HEALING. IT'S THERE. It's in our body. &gt;&gt; It's there. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It's there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes you there are things you think about, oh man, how how can I ever do this? Oh wow, you're one of the common things. Let me bring that one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sinking special. Praise the Lord. Oh, I can't stand before people. I don't know how to stand before it, but it's there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know how many angels that come by when you singing in your house? &gt;&gt; You even have you have heavenly host listening to you because you are singing. Whether you are in tune or not out of tune, they're not listening to your words. They're listening to the praise that is coming from your heart. &gt;&gt; But then you just feel like I can do it. I don't know. I don't know how to do it. But it's there. You have just allowed a certain thing to cloud your mind to think that you cannot do it. &gt;&gt; I don't know how people pray and then they spend one hour before God. It's in you. &gt;&gt; It's there. It's in you. &gt;&gt; You just allow YOUR MIND TO CLOUD you to think that you cannot do it. But if you let go, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; you will let go. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, out of your belly will flow rivers of water. Rivers of water. Which mean you can give it once, you can give it again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You can give it once, you can give it again, you can give it to the the most difficult person you think you cannot give it to, you can give it to them. &gt;&gt; It's in you. His desire. Just his desire. His desire for someone to spend time with him. his desire for someone to pray for someone to really just shout in and say this this uh this 30 minutes of my day is for him. His desire of just having 30 minutes with someone is in you. If you really organize yourself and you think you can do it and you put alarm on your phone to remind you, you will do it because it's in you to do it. desire to overcome is in you today. &gt;&gt; No matter what the habit is, no matter what whatever it is is uh you think that is becoming your identity but the ability to overcome is in you out of your belly. flow of some of water, living water. He said something that would bring pleasure to the father and sometimes it will even bring pleasure to yourself. You feel good about it. You be grateful that God has given you grace in certain areas of your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. be grateful. You're not doing it because of whoever the person is or doing it because of uh No, you're doing it because you want to bring a cold glass of water to your father. Praise the Lord. The musicians can come tonight. I think I tried to to achieve what I wanted to get to tonight. Praise the Lord to be able to show you that the way that God look at might is different. It's different from our muscles is different from our our our outward dedication, you know, our outward commitment. When God look at might, you look at how how the the the the hunger you have in your heart, the the longing you have in your heart, the longing I pray that God will be able to help each and every one of us to be able to break barriers to be to be to be a mighty man, not a mighty man of David, a mighty man of Jesus. The garrison of the Philistines filled Jerusalem, but yet they were able to go through there to get in water. There might be a bunch of garrison around you and reasons why you can't do certain things and reasons why you think it's difficult. But if his desire is a command to you, you will break barriers. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You will go against even your better judgment. Praise the Lord. Sometimes there are things that are difficult to to to put in words. You practice to say it and and and uh uh when you stand before the person, all the words just go away from your head. Then write a card. Write a note. Just go down to the Walmart or or Sam, get a card and just write it. Send [music] it to them. I pray that the Holy Spirit will make it more real to you. Amen. [clears throat] This is my desire. Every breath that I take, every moment [singing and music] I'm awake, oh have your way [music and singing] in me, Lord, Lord, I give you heart. I give [music and singing] you my soul. I live for [singing] you alone. Every [music] breath that I take, every moment [singing] I'm awake, [music] oh have your [singing] way in me. [music] &gt;&gt; This is my desire. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; This is my desire [singing] [music] to honor you. Lord, with all my heart [singing] I worship [music] you. with [music] me all [singing] within me. I give you [music] praise. All that I adore [singing and music] is in you. [music] Yes, Lord. [singing] Lord, I give you [music] my heart. I give you [singing] my soul. I [music] lay for you all. Every [singing] breath that I take, every moment [music] of my way, Lord, have your [music and singing] way. Oh Lord, I give you my heart. I gave [music] you [singing] my soul. I live for you [music] more. Every breath [singing] that I take, every moment [music] I'm away, Lord, have [singing] your way. Amen. [music] Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus. Amen. For [music] this Wednesday night to be a kind of a prayer meeting, oh Father, Lord God. And oh God, precious [music] Lord. And uh I just took a stomach ache just before the service, Lord. And my Oh God, but I thank you for coming [music] through and just Lord uh uh giving me some sense of rest, Lord. Father God, that I could be [music] able to to just minister tonight, Lord, Father. Oh God, throw my thoughts off. Oh [music] God, set my body off. But Father, at the end of at the end of it, Lord Jesus, I even find myself at a [music] place where Oh God, Father, I just so beautiful tonight. Oh God, [music] so beautiful, precious Lord Father, that Lord God, you you you look to us, Lord, you are thirsting. You are [music] so thirsty for a son of God or a daughter of God.
