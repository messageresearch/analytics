[29:52] uh praise the
[29:55] Lord amen praise the Lord
[30:01] you know uh we we spoke uh sometime back
[30:06] on from Revelation chapter
[30:11] 5 and
[30:13] uh
[30:20] uh and we
[30:23] mention that when the seals were open
[30:31] uh beside the names of the redeemed
[30:35] there were that were beside the redeem
[30:39] no let he stay right here for now yeah
[30:42] beside the names of the redem that were
[30:49] revealed we saw another thing in
[30:51] Revelation chapter
[30:56] 5 and
[30:58] uh and what we saw in Revelation chapter
[31:04] 5 was uh the prayers of the
[31:10] Saints and uh uh the Bible says there
[31:13] was a
[31:15] board there was a
[31:19] board with uh the prayers of the
[31:24] Saints and uh like I said uh it
[31:28] makes the importance of prayer to the
[31:35] believer to realize that uh every time
[31:39] we say a
[31:43] prayer is gathered in a place of
[31:51] remembrance so uh uh because of
[31:55] that and uh we try to bring the the the
[32:04] emphasis to be able to encourage
[32:09] ourself there is one thing that we can
[32:11] do and never be out of
[32:18] order is when we are
[32:21] praying the Bible says is in season is
[32:24] out of season
[32:29] so we can never be out of
[32:34] order and the last time we spoke about
[32:37] the uh the in home
[32:45] writer and and that in writer was
[32:49] sealing those that was praying for the
[32:53] Abomination that is done in the city
[33:00] now this is it is not just to make Aon
[33:10] title but it is to be able to encourage
[33:15] us and also to be able to teach
[33:18] us praise the Lord that when we come to
[33:22] the to the house of
[33:25] God and uh uh uh it we we are encouraged
[33:30] to be able to bring a burden bring a
[33:33] bring a prayer need for someone and
[33:41] some even if it's an unspoken prayer
[33:49] request because one of the things that
[33:51] we
[33:53] learned prayer is a burden
[33:58] praise the Lord amen we must never come
[34:02] to a prayer
[34:05] meeting and start creating
[34:13] request
[34:15] about what what do we need to pray
[34:23] about okay okay let's let's pray for the
[34:25] brothers
[34:28] and
[34:29] uh okay okay let's pray for the
[34:32] Sisters no no prayer must come from a
[34:36] place of
[34:40] Burden praise the Lord amen amen that's
[34:44] that's what we have been
[34:47] taught that's what make us different
[34:49] from a
[34:52] denomination because it's easy to create
[34:54] a prayer meeting
[34:58] and we can do it just the denomination
[35:02] way praise the lord we all have a need
[35:05] for us to pray about
[35:08] tonight then I make you you startop
[35:11] thinking about
[35:14] it then this person talk then that
[35:16] person
[35:17] talk talk it's not coming from a place
[35:20] of
[35:23] Burden it must come from the place of
[35:25] Burden
[35:28] praise the Lord amen and then if it's
[35:30] from a place of
[35:33] Burden amen we we make it
[35:38] known by writing the prayer
[35:41] request sometimes if you have the
[35:44] burden send a text
[35:47] message we will be able to pray along
[35:49] with
[35:51] you and then we will we will we will
[35:54] write it
[35:55] down even though I don't want to to
[35:57] encourage
[36:00] them because people would now expect me
[36:03] to be writing their prayer
[36:09] requests and then they will say I told
[36:11] you but I didn't hear my prayer
[36:18] request it's truth that I supposed to
[36:20] carry your
[36:25] burden that one supposed to be special
[36:28] to
[36:29] you praise the Lord so we have few
[36:33] prayer needs we want to take up
[36:36] tonight and uh we just want to encourage
[36:40] you amen and I mean there there are just
[36:44] so many things happening in the

[1:03:45] Verse
[1:03:48] 18 praise the
[1:03:50] Lord praise the Lord amen amen amen
[1:04:00] now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[1:04:03] this
[1:04:04] wise now that's that would be my subject
[1:04:07] tonight the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[1:04:10] this wise if you remember on Sunday I
[1:04:14] re-echoed that over and over because I
[1:04:17] wanted to grab your attention on this
[1:04:22] the birth of Jesus was on this wise uh
[1:04:26] on on on this order this is the way that
[1:04:29] it happened and uh so I want to stay
[1:04:32] right there uh with their Tau praise the
[1:04:36] Lord amen if uh if the birth of Jesus
[1:04:40] was on this wise at that time you know
[1:04:44] what what is beautiful here about this
[1:04:46] scripture is that
[1:04:50] uh Matthew wrote it in a present tense
[1:04:55] now
[1:04:57] now now so in in every age to to every
[1:05:04] generation we can we can we can apply
[1:05:08] this scripture to
[1:05:10] ourself amen now the birth of
[1:05:15] Jesus was on this wise because the same
[1:05:18] way God did it the first time that's the
[1:05:21] way he's going to do
[1:05:23] it if he would bring Christ in in this
[1:05:26] age if he will bring Christ in your life
[1:05:29] the way he did it here that's the way
[1:05:33] he's going to do
[1:05:37] it praise the
[1:05:40] Lorden are you grabbing the the picture
[1:05:44] amen so the birth of Jesus was on this
[1:05:48] wise the Lord bless you you may have
[1:05:51] your
[1:05:53] seat amen let's continue to
[1:06:04] reading now the birth of Jesus was on
[1:06:06] this
[1:06:08] wise when as his mother married was
[1:06:12] espoused to Joseph before they came
[1:06:15] together she was found with child of the
[1:06:19] Holy Ghost you will realize that in the
[1:06:22] message brother brandham used this over
[1:06:25] and over most especially when he's
[1:06:28] talking about the godhead to be able to
[1:06:30] prove who was Jesus
[1:06:34] father he used it all the time you can
[1:06:37] just go right into the search and put
[1:06:40] the birth of Jesus was on this wise you
[1:06:42] will see how many times he mentioned it
[1:06:44] and every time he mentioned it he
[1:06:47] mentioned it to be able to
[1:06:50] show that there is nothing like Trinity
[1:06:55] pra praise the Lord and also to be able
[1:06:58] to
[1:06:59] show that uh how the how the birth that
[1:07:04] that God overshadow mared and the child
[1:07:08] that it was God giving birth to himself
[1:07:10] let me say it that way praise the Lord
[1:07:14] so he read the scripture and he says the
[1:07:17] Bible says here that uh uh uh before
[1:07:22] they came together she was found with a
[1:07:25] child of the Holy Ghost he said okay
[1:07:27] let's take that one is the Holy Ghost
[1:07:29] his father but Jesus said God was his
[1:07:33] father you know so he go on and on just
[1:07:36] to be able to bring us to the place to
[1:07:39] be able to understand that it was God
[1:07:42] dwelling the fullness of God dwelling in
[1:07:45] Christ amen so the scripture goes on
[1:07:48] then Joseph her
[1:07:51] husband being a just man now not willing
[1:07:56] to make a public
[1:07:59] example was mindful to put her away yeah
[1:08:02] brother Brandon we explain that they
[1:08:04] were married because of their vow but uh
[1:08:07] they had not consumed their marriage yet
[1:08:10] the consumation of the marriage never
[1:08:12] took place but they have proposed to one
[1:08:15] another to be husband and wife praise
[1:08:19] the Lord are we together now so what I
[1:08:23] want us to see here is there
[1:08:26] uh uh
[1:08:28] married she had her life going
[1:08:31] on praise the Lord she had her life
[1:08:35] planned or her wedding was planned she
[1:08:38] was she was on her expectation to be a
[1:08:41] mother she might have had in her mind
[1:08:43] how many child that she was going to
[1:08:46] have praise the Lord and that is the
[1:08:50] same thing with you and
[1:08:52] myself before God met us
[1:08:56] we have our life going
[1:08:58] on praise the Lord are we together the
[1:09:03] birth of Jesus was on this
[1:09:06] wise now you have to
[1:09:09] remember we read this on Sunday brother
[1:09:13] brandham
[1:09:15] said you ever get the Virgin birth
[1:09:18] straightened out you got Christianity
[1:09:22] straighten out
[1:09:25] praise the Lorden amen if you ever get
[1:09:29] the Virgin birth straightened out you
[1:09:32] get Christianity straighten out if we
[1:09:36] get the the that is just not
[1:09:39] Christianity as a religion but
[1:09:41] Christianity in the way that God is
[1:09:43] dealing with his people because it's not
[1:09:45] a religion it's a
[1:09:49] relationship
[1:09:50] amen praise the Lord are we together
[1:09:58] so the birth of Jesus was on this wise
[1:10:02] Mary had her life going on I mean she
[1:10:04] was a young woman and and I mean she had
[1:10:07] she had things planned Joseph there also
[1:10:10] was on her expectation to take this
[1:10:12] young young woman I call into history he
[1:10:15] has he he he lost his wife and this was
[1:10:18] going to be his second wife and uh uh
[1:10:21] they had everything
[1:10:23] planned praise the Lord the truth about
[1:10:26] the matter there is that they were not
[1:10:28] planning for this
[1:10:30] one this was not in their
[1:10:33] plan praise the Lord amen and with our
[1:10:37] life plan up we were not planning for
[1:10:40] this one amen praise the lord we were
[1:10:43] not planning to be onor honor a
[1:10:45] messenger of this age am I don't think
[1:10:48] any one of you went to school to learn
[1:10:50] how to be under a messenger of the age
[1:10:55] we were not planning for
[1:10:59] this what brought this to Mary was God's
[1:11:04] favor what brought this to you and
[1:11:06] myself is God's favor the birth of Jesus
[1:11:10] was on this
[1:11:13] wise praise the Lord if you can grab it
[1:11:17] you will realize that you are not in a
[1:11:19] picture to begin with
[1:11:25] you cannot plan this thing
[1:11:28] out praise the Lord you cannot plan out
[1:11:32] like you know some young people when I
[1:11:34] get married I will get the Holy Ghost
[1:11:36] when you know when I finish with school
[1:11:38] when you you can't plan
[1:11:40] it it's a finished
[1:11:43] work the blueprint is in the hands of
[1:11:50] God are you seeing the picture amen they
[1:11:53] were not pling Joseph was not planning
[1:11:56] for
[1:11:57] this but there was one thing that was
[1:12:01] also truth about Joseph the Bible says
[1:12:04] he was a just
[1:12:08] man praise the Lord hallelujah even
[1:12:11] though he was not planning for his wife
[1:12:13] to be visited by an Angel but but what
[1:12:16] he had in his plan that he would live by
[1:12:19] the law of
[1:12:21] God
[1:12:23] am praise the Lord am amen
[1:12:27] amen that until God brings him a
[1:12:30] faithful woman in his life he's not
[1:12:33] going to be running around and just
[1:12:35] living a useless life he was a just man
[1:12:38] that's what the Bible
[1:12:42] said and Mary was just an innocent girl
[1:12:46] that was uh I mean growing up and honor
[1:12:49] her mother and and and uh uh uh uh with
[1:12:52] this expectation of having her own home
[1:12:56] raising her own family that was her
[1:12:59] plan praise the
[1:13:03] Lorden and that is the same thing with
[1:13:06] you and myself that is the same thing
[1:13:08] with every predestinated child of
[1:13:15] God are we
[1:13:19] together if we get the Virgin birth
[1:13:21] straightened
[1:13:23] out our Christian Life will line
[1:13:28] up are we together see what brother Bram
[1:13:32] says here while we stayed on this
[1:13:36] thought he says you know and you know
[1:13:43] what after a survey was made according
[1:13:47] to the government
[1:13:50] statistics after the survey was
[1:13:53] made there was 70% of protestant
[1:13:59] preachers praise the
[1:14:04] Lord amen
[1:14:09] am I'm trying to wait for my folks to
[1:14:12] catch up back
[1:14:13] there and
[1:14:15] uh there are some new land back there so
[1:14:19] a whole lot of a thing is going on okay
[1:14:22] let's go ahead because I think uh they
[1:14:25] are projecting something
[1:14:27] different they want us to begin the
[1:14:29] service from from
[1:14:31] stratch praise the Lord you know what he
[1:14:34] says after a survey was made according
[1:14:37] to the government statistics this is the
[1:14:40] government religious
[1:14:42] statistics there was 70% of protestant
[1:14:46] preachers denied the Virgin
[1:14:49] birth that's trueu that was where zling
[1:14:55] was different from uh
[1:14:58] Luther he was also a reformer that came
[1:15:01] out of the Catholic church just like
[1:15:04] Luther but zling did not believe in the
[1:15:07] Virgin
[1:15:09] birth they believe that Jesus was the
[1:15:13] son of Joseph called the Son of
[1:15:18] God praise the Lord now you you will see
[1:15:22] why this is important
[1:15:26] because you see the thing about it there
[1:15:28] is not when we just say we believe
[1:15:33] it you will realize that what you
[1:15:37] believe actually affect your
[1:15:42] life praise the
[1:15:44] Lord it makes a big part of your
[1:15:48] life for the matter of fact it makes
[1:15:51] almost 80%
[1:15:56] of your decision
[1:16:01] making the choices that we make are we
[1:16:05] together so so he says here uh uh uh 70%
[1:16:10] of the protesting preachers deny the
[1:16:12] Virgin birth will you think of it no
[1:16:15] wonder we have hashed out 13 million in
[1:16:21] feter last
[1:16:22] year and that's the reason why the
[1:16:25] church is the way the church
[1:16:28] is because if we really believe the
[1:16:31] Virgin birth in the way the Bible taught
[1:16:36] it we will not need an
[1:16:40] organization can you imagine God about
[1:16:44] to bring forth the Messiah and he called
[1:16:47] caias and say call the sindr council
[1:16:51] yall come together and discuss how the
[1:16:54] Messiah should be
[1:16:56] born praise the Lord if we believe the
[1:16:59] Virgin birth we will not need an
[1:17:01] organization because God never did an
[1:17:04] organization to bring the Christ
[1:17:08] amen we will not need a
[1:17:14] denomination praise the Lord amen amen
[1:17:18] and brother Bram says no wonder we have
[1:17:20] a bunch of unbelievers in the church we
[1:17:24] have a bunch of people that claim to
[1:17:26] believe and deny the power of God what
[1:17:29] brought the Virgin bre it was the power
[1:17:31] of God the Bible says you will be
[1:17:34] overshadowed by the Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost and If you deny the power of God
[1:17:41] then you don't believe in the Virgin
[1:17:43] birth no matter how much you think you
[1:17:45] believe in
[1:17:47] it if you have a situation in your life
[1:17:51] that you think that God is can is cannot
[1:17:54] take care of then you don't believe in
[1:17:56] the Virgin
[1:17:59] birth all this run very deep it runs
[1:18:03] very very
[1:18:06] deep I really didn't mean to tell you
[1:18:08] Bible
[1:18:12] stories my desire is for us to get
[1:18:15] somewhere so so he go ahead and he says
[1:18:17] here he says uh no wonder we have h h a
[1:18:20] bunch of infos last year see because
[1:18:24] th the fundamental part of Christian
[1:18:28] religion is based upon the Virgin birth
[1:18:32] of Jesus Christ is a fundamental part we
[1:18:37] can talk about Calvary without a virgin
[1:18:40] birth we can talk about a savior we can
[1:18:43] talk about
[1:18:45] Redemption praise the lord we might have
[1:18:47] a bunch of knowledge and and you know
[1:18:49] talk about mystery mystery mystery but
[1:18:52] it all start from the Virgin birth
[1:19:00] is a fundamental
[1:19:02] part and no wonder why the devil attack
[1:19:06] it praise the
[1:19:08] Lord
[1:19:13] amen If he if he was not
[1:19:18] born a virgin
[1:19:20] birth he was not the son of God
[1:19:25] praise the Lord amen he was not just
[1:19:29] called the Son of God to be called The
[1:19:31] Son of God he was the son of God because
[1:19:35] God birthed
[1:19:39] him praise the Lord he was the son of
[1:19:42] God because it was God's life in
[1:19:45] him and if if we are Sons and Daughters
[1:19:49] of God the same way the first son was
[1:19:52] born was birth it would be the very same
[1:19:56] way going about your normal business and
[1:19:59] God will grab your attention by a
[1:20:01] message and he will condition your life
[1:20:05] to be able to bring forth Christ
[1:20:11] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:20:16] amen oh may God help
[1:20:19] us are we
[1:20:21] together the breath of Jesus was on this
[1:20:23] wise if if he was not the Son of
[1:20:27] God if he was born the Virgin birth he
[1:20:33] will have to be the Son of
[1:20:35] God not no other one could bring him
[1:20:40] here no other one could bring him
[1:20:44] here no other one could bring him
[1:20:48] here praise the
[1:20:50] Lord amen when God said in the beginning
[1:20:54] let make man in in our image and the
[1:20:58] Bible says in the image of God God make
[1:21:02] man male and female created he them
[1:21:07] praise the Lord that's what the Bible
[1:21:11] said are we
[1:21:14] together when God was bringing the first
[1:21:19] son he did not organize
[1:21:22] Angels praise the Lord
[1:21:25] he didn't went through some kind of
[1:21:27] organization the Bible says
[1:21:29] no the Bible says and God created Man In
[1:21:33] His Image male and female and the Bible
[1:21:37] says he took of the Dust of the earth he
[1:21:39] formed man and he breath into his
[1:21:42] nostril and Man became a living it was
[1:21:45] all God's
[1:21:46] work it was all God's work there was no
[1:21:50] mother and father that brought the first
[1:21:52] Son of God there was no mother and
[1:21:55] father that brought the Second Son of
[1:21:57] God there is there will be no parent
[1:21:59] that will bring a Son of God in this age
[1:22:02] it has to be
[1:22:07] God
[1:22:09] hallelujah praise the Lord it has to be
[1:22:13] God the birath of Jesus was on this wise
[1:22:18] how they God do it he caught the
[1:22:21] attention of a young innocent woman that
[1:22:24] have her life going on she made mistakes
[1:22:28] praise the Lord amen she made mistake
[1:22:31] maybe she was not educated as as as it
[1:22:34] was expected to be maybe she never had a
[1:22:36] career or she was hoping that that to
[1:22:39] them I mean what whatever her life
[1:22:42] was but God got her attention by an
[1:22:46] Angel that visited her praise the Lord
[1:22:50] and until God gets your attention in
[1:22:52] this age
[1:22:54] praise the Lord by the angel message of
[1:22:58] this
[1:23:01] age are we together amen praise the
[1:23:06] Lord amen as we go into this let me let
[1:23:11] me just uh
[1:23:13] uh let me just take a
[1:23:17] little backseat let me come back a
[1:23:19] little bit
[1:23:21] here praise the Lord
[1:23:25] you see when
[1:23:28] people sometimes it happen with
[1:23:31] visitors and uh uh you know we talk
[1:23:35] about you know a seed uh the womb and
[1:23:40] the
[1:23:41] woman and sometimes especially with the
[1:23:44] kind of for uh uh sensitive generation
[1:23:48] we have uh
[1:23:52] uh because the church has become
[1:23:56] everything it have just become a place
[1:23:58] of
[1:23:59] entertainment this kind of a language it
[1:24:02] it looks a little bit funny because as
[1:24:04] we go into today like I said on Sunday
[1:24:06] we're going to talk about the the two
[1:24:08] wombs and and all of that the
[1:24:11] reason is that we read Genesis
[1:24:16] 3:15 God gave a promise to the woman
[1:24:19] brother Braham said in uh uh invisible
[1:24:22] Union
[1:24:25] that the mystery of redemption was given
[1:24:28] to the
[1:24:31] woman with God's Plan of
[1:24:34] Redemption with God Plan of Redemption
[1:24:38] The Plan of Redemption that he
[1:24:40] had to be able to bring forth manifest
[1:24:45] his
[1:24:47] attributes the Bible will let us know
[1:24:50] that he put Adam into a deep sleep he
[1:24:52] took the woman and he formed the woman
[1:24:55] and in the
[1:24:57] woman he placed the mystery of
[1:25:01] redemption and that mystery of
[1:25:03] redemption was placed on the three
[1:25:05] sacred
[1:25:09] virtue praise the Lord no other creature
[1:25:13] was given there beside the
[1:25:15] woman and that's the reason why the
[1:25:18] church is a type of a
[1:25:21] woman praise the Lord amen amen
[1:25:26] amen so if we if we if we if we want to
[1:25:30] understand the way that God is dealing
[1:25:32] with his
[1:25:34] people we must go back and see how God
[1:25:37] deal with the
[1:25:41] woman praise the
[1:25:44] Lord because as the Church of the Living
[1:25:46] God we all come honor we come under that
[1:25:50] gender as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:54] amen praise the
[1:25:56] Lord amen
[1:26:05] amen glory be to
[1:26:11] God am me so let's let's continue here
[1:26:15] the birth of Jesus was on this
[1:26:19] wise there was a mered there was a
[1:26:23] Joseph
[1:26:25] praise the Lord and those people they
[1:26:27] were ordinary people just like you and
[1:26:31] myself uh uh like James would say the
[1:26:34] man of like
[1:26:35] passion praise the
[1:26:37] Lord but in the story year we we go down
[1:26:41] and the Bible would said in verse 20 but
[1:26:43] why he taught on these things why Joseph
[1:26:46] was thinking on these
[1:26:50] things the Lord appeared unto uh uh him
[1:26:53] in a dream came and said Joseph
[1:26:56] thou son of David fear not to take unto
[1:27:01] thee
[1:27:03] marit the wife for that which is
[1:27:07] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:10] the same thing that the angel said to
[1:27:12] Mary the angel is saying the same thing
[1:27:15] to
[1:27:16] Joseph praise the Lord amen God is
[1:27:21] trying to bring balance in this uh in
[1:27:24] this
[1:27:25] Union he's trying to bring balance in
[1:27:28] the people that he will be dealing with
[1:27:30] for this
[1:27:31] work Joseph had a
[1:27:35] place praise the Lord amen he had a
[1:27:40] place he's trying to bring
[1:27:45] balance and that's the way that God deal
[1:27:47] with us I mean the the preacher cannot
[1:27:50] be so scar high and he in the Blues and
[1:27:53] he's preaching and the people can never
[1:27:56] connect to what he's preaching God has
[1:27:58] to bring bring balance the same way he's
[1:28:00] dealing with the church he also dealing
[1:28:02] with the
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:05] minister the birth of Jesus is on this
[1:28:11] Wise It's not a preacher there in the
[1:28:14] corner with some kind of assulated
[1:28:20] Revelation praise the Lord amen amen
[1:28:24] the way the Holy Spirit work is that
[1:28:27] what God will be dealing with your heart
[1:28:30] the things you will be praying about the
[1:28:32] things you will be Desiring God is going
[1:28:34] to lay the same burden on the ministry
[1:28:36] when you come to church he takes it from
[1:28:39] the
[1:28:45] word are we together amen
[1:28:57] and she shall and she shall bring forth
[1:28:59] a son and thou shall call his name Jesus
[1:29:02] for he will save his
[1:29:04] people from their sin verse 22 now this
[1:29:08] was done all this that have happened all
[1:29:12] this that have happened never
[1:29:16] happened
[1:29:19] randomly praise the Lord that's the
[1:29:22] reason why we are taught to breing bring
[1:29:24] our experience back to the word
[1:29:27] amen because God is not going to deal
[1:29:30] with you
[1:29:32] randomly he's not going to deal with you
[1:29:35] without no basis in his
[1:29:39] word all this was done the visiting of
[1:29:44] marriage praise the Lord all of that was
[1:29:50] done that it might be fulfilled yes
[1:29:54] that a word might be
[1:29:56] fulfilled praise the Lord amen amen we
[1:30:00] are here tonight all of this is done
[1:30:03] that it might be fulfilled in the
[1:30:05] evening time there shall be
[1:30:09] light praise the Lord is the evening
[1:30:12] light that is gathering us here
[1:30:15] amen amen amen we are gathering here
[1:30:19] that it might be fulfilled behold I send
[1:30:22] you Elijah the prophet to turn the
[1:30:26] hearts of the children back to the
[1:30:29] fathers praise the Lord
[1:30:34] amen so we can we can take our
[1:30:37] experience back to the word all of
[1:30:40] this happen fulfill which was spoken by
[1:30:44] the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall
[1:30:48] conceive and shall bring forth a son and
[1:30:51] they shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:30:54] which is being interpreted god with us
[1:30:57] so brother Brandon will use that to show
[1:31:00] that uh there are nothing like Trinity
[1:31:03] here there's no Father Son and the Holy
[1:31:05] Ghost here it's just God manifesting
[1:31:08] himself
[1:31:09] amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:31:14] amen the birth of Jesus was on this wise
[1:31:19] what did the angel said to
[1:31:22] Mary Hallelujah
[1:31:31] that will be found over in St Luke St
[1:31:35] Luke will bring us a more descriptive of
[1:31:38] this so let's go to Luke I want to just
[1:31:41] take one portion of that tonight so we
[1:31:45] can we can have something to meditate on
[1:31:49] something to take to the Lord in prayer
[1:31:52] praise the Lorden
[1:32:02] I'm telling you the way I'm looking at
[1:32:04] this I can preach all
[1:32:06] night but I will not try to do
[1:32:10] it
[1:32:12] amen yeah I will not I will not try to
[1:32:15] do
[1:32:20] it you love the Lord amen amen
[1:32:25] amen s Luke chapter 1 verse
[1:32:39] 26 in the sixth month in the sixth month
[1:32:43] the angel Gabriel was sent from God onto
[1:32:47] a city called
[1:32:48] Nazareth the city of gilee named
[1:32:51] Nazareth sorry to a virgin Asos to a man
[1:32:54] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[1:32:57] David and the Virgin name was
[1:32:59] Mary praise the Lord
[1:33:03] amen the birth of Jesus was on this
[1:33:08] wise there was a
[1:33:11] time that Mary could say from that
[1:33:15] time amen amen the Bible was specific it
[1:33:20] was it was the sixth month of the year
[1:33:25] praise the
[1:33:26] lord and there will also bring in
[1:33:29] context where John the Baptist
[1:33:32] was amen amen so that was the age
[1:33:36] difference between he and and uh and
[1:33:39] Jesus 6 months now so h h h uh 6 months
[1:33:45] of the year now we can tell was Mary
[1:33:48] planning her wedding uh uh in the
[1:33:50] seventh month was she planning her
[1:33:52] wedding in the in the eth month or
[1:33:53] whatever time she was planning her
[1:33:55] wedding but here God will visit her in
[1:33:58] the six months the angel will come to a
[1:34:01] woman that was already engaged to a man
[1:34:05] and the
[1:34:06] angel verse 28 came to her and said hell
[1:34:13] thou are highly
[1:34:15] favored praise the Lord
[1:34:20] amen thou are highly favored
[1:34:25] the Lord is with thee blessed are th
[1:34:28] among
[1:34:29] women praise the Lord amen hallelujah
[1:34:34] amen and just like I said you know uh uh
[1:34:39] uh we we we look at the story here in
[1:34:42] the in the uh in the Bible and then we
[1:34:45] look at Mary condition the Bible say she
[1:34:48] was a virgin she was a young woman
[1:34:50] exposed to a man they never came
[1:34:52] together and sometimes we take there to
[1:34:55] be more
[1:35:00] extraordinary but a prophet will come
[1:35:02] and tell you that uh your natural birth
[1:35:07] was more
[1:35:10] mysterious than the Virgin
[1:35:13] birth praise the Lord which mean h h i
[1:35:17] mean uh year when you look both in the
[1:35:21] in the book of uh uh Matthew and and and
[1:35:24] Luke they trace the genealogy of both
[1:35:28] Mary and Joseph back to
[1:35:32] David praise the Lord amen both of them
[1:35:35] are traced right back to David we'll
[1:35:37] find we'll find time to do that will
[1:35:39] show you places there where where you
[1:35:40] can be able to see it now but what I'm
[1:35:43] trying to say here is there uh H I mean
[1:35:47] uh as a people of God I mean we are from
[1:35:50] we are from different background and and
[1:35:52] and some of our parents did not even
[1:35:54] knew about the message some of them were
[1:35:56] not were not Christians and and and all
[1:35:59] of that and and and and and so in in our
[1:36:02] human mind is it's it's hard for us to
[1:36:05] to think that we fit in this
[1:36:08] situation praise the Lord amen because
[1:36:12] when we remember uh H our past life and
[1:36:15] some of the things that that we that we
[1:36:17] did is hard for us to place our former
[1:36:20] life in the state of a virgin
[1:36:25] praise the
[1:36:27] Lord but I have good news for you
[1:36:29] tonight
[1:36:30] amen
[1:36:32] Allelujah praise the Lord I have good
[1:36:35] news for you tonight because I would
[1:36:38] tell you that uh Mary was not the only
[1:36:41] virgin that was in the city praise the
[1:36:43] Lord she was not the only virgin but she
[1:36:46] was the one that was choosing for this
[1:36:49] Mission amen she was the one that was
[1:36:51] choosing for this experience
[1:36:54] the birth of Jesus was on this wise and
[1:36:57] the angel said unto her thou are highly
[1:37:01] favored all that means is that Grace
[1:37:05] unto
[1:37:06] you that's what it means this is God's
[1:37:09] grace unto
[1:37:12] you for you to hear about the message of
[1:37:15] the hour to hear that God sent a prophet
[1:37:18] is God's grace unto
[1:37:20] you you are highly favored
[1:37:24] am praise the Lord highly favor more
[1:37:28] than Elon
[1:37:30] Marx praise the Lord oh you don't think
[1:37:33] about it that way but you are highly
[1:37:37] favored your name are never come on the
[1:37:40] name of the the the world most 10 rich
[1:37:43] people the world most five beautiful
[1:37:45] women the world most uh inter your name
[1:37:49] I never show up there but God choose you
[1:37:53] God says you are highly favored to bring
[1:37:56] the message of the hour your
[1:37:59] way to grab your attention something
[1:38:02] that will grab your attention in such an
[1:38:05] age of Reckless living and such an age
[1:38:09] where the name of God is traed to the
[1:38:11] ground yet God can put Grace in your
[1:38:14] heart and you can you can have respect
[1:38:16] to the word of God you can have some
[1:38:18] sense of decency amen amen
[1:38:24] amen the birath of Jesus was on this
[1:38:33] wise praise the Lord
[1:38:39] am and when she saw him she was troubled

[1:45:04] was in her mind she was saying what
[1:45:06] manner of salutation is this but now she
[1:45:10] can go back to the angel and say how
[1:45:12] would this
[1:45:14] happen praise the
[1:45:20] Lord and the angel answered and said
