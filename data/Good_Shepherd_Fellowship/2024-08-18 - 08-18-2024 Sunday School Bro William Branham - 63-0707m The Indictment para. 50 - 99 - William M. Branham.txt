========================================

[Music] [Music] and uh we're the tapes goal and that's world around uh this message is are not directed to any certain individual and we wouldn't want people to think that we are some sort of a clan or a bunch of Fanatics that's been uh gathered ourselves together to separate ourselves seemingly not having the faith a SE op at our against anybody or or against God or against the church we are far the church but we're only trying to pourn out by the Holy Spirit and his help the reason for this segregation that we have today we we do not believe in it we believe that all churches ought to be fellowshipping together not uh segregated away the Methodist to their group and the Baptist of theirs and the Oneness and the trinitarians and what we have all separated out we believe that it should be together as one great United group of the body of Jesus Christ waiting for that glorious coming they should not be separated all and what separates it there's bound to be some basic reason that we're not together in studying it I realize in studying it it's not the colors of our skin because yellow black brown and white all separate in different organizations it's not the kind of food we eat we all eat the same food we wear the same kind of clothes and so forth but I see where basically it's at is man who's got off the beaten path of the teaching of the Gospel each man and there ought to be some way to definitely show which is right and wrong and the only way you'll ever do it is not put any interpretation to the word just read it the way it is and believe it that way each man putting his only own interpretation makes it say something different brings it back to the original organization of the Catholic Church which the Catholic Church believes that God is in his church and the word has nothing to do with it and God is in his church and we Protestants as we find in Revelation 17 that all of them heaped up together and that the Catholic church was a mother of all organizations and we see that the pro Protestant organization yet blindly blindly has the same nature of the Catholic Church the Bible calls the Catholic Church a and calls the Protestant Church harlots said that the was a mother of harlots and that is people it's a ill famed woman who doesn't live true to her marriage vows and we all claim to be the bride of Christ and yet so untrue what would make the untr by living contrary to the the discipline that God has laid out for his bride to live by that's my own opinion uh the Bible and it is the infallible word of God I believe and uh therefore we find out that the Protestant Church in order to have an organization separates itself even from the scriptures to make its organization ministers ordained will hold the things that they now they come to my studying in the rooms by the hundreds and tell me brother brandom you make those challenges to people nobody's going to stand out there against that they know it's a truth well I said what why don't you do it well you see if I do I'll be begging my bread not nobody I got a Ministry I've got to get to the Lord and uh I got to get to the people and I'll have no backing up do you only realize that Christ is our backing up the Bible is our backing see but it's see then that throws the the Protestant church Church exactly the very same thing the Catholic church is the Catholic Church doesn't care well I don't say I don't make it that rude to say they don't care what the Bible says they they believe the Bible but see they got a Apostolic succession is what the Catholic church is based upon that's the succession of popes and called Peter the first pope and on down now they they believe that they they emphatically believe that and the Protestant see they they gather together and have an organization just exactly like they did at NAA Rome where they organize the the Catholic Church by at the NAA Council and we find that they're both the same they're both the same they leave the word of God to make an organization and then when it comes to many great truths that seem strange today it's foreign to them because they've only been taught by a ritual we have no ritual but the Bible we have nothing but God's holy word and that's where we stand and now today I want to read some scripture just a minute from the holy sacred word of God found in the book of St Luke the 23rd chapter of St Luke the base did a a platform of what I I want to say a basic thought on the things that I want to speak on and you're turning now to St Luke the 23rd uh chapter and I want to read one verse that's all I need for this basis this morning to place it up on now we read the 20 uh 23rd chapter the 33rd verse of the 23rd chapter and when they came to the place which is called Calvary there crucified him and the malactor one on the right hand and the other on the left now I want to take four words out of there out of that reading to base what I want to say there they crucified him four words and um my subject is called I I'm bringing an indictment uh to the denominational churches of this day and all so many of The Independents for crucifying Jesus Christ aresh in this day indicting them this morning it's called the indictment and I want to kind of use it more like it it was like a room of of a courtroom where there was and after all the pulpit and the church is a courtroom the Bible said it's a judgment seat at must begin at the house of the Lord and this is like the the throne in the and the jury and the witnesses and so forth and I have today for my witness is God's word and my indict is against the churches of today now I I'm not bringing the sinner into this I'm just speaking this to the church and it's it's to be in the the tapes now and uh I'll try to get through as quick as I can I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ and now to do this in this age that we live in I I do this I'm a show on every evidence if I have to bring an indictment you have to show an Evidence of the criminal offense that has been done I I have to indict them I I have to bring the the evidence to prove it that it is that what I'm seeing will stand up before the main judge which is I take myself as an attorney uh uh on this indictment that the word of God being my witness I indict this generation for the crucifixion I'm must show and will show uh that the same spirit is on the people today that brought the first crucifixion and doing the same thing I I must do that if it's going to be a crucifixion that they've crucified I'm must show to the the people that the same attitude in the people today is doing the same thing spiritually that they did physically then they Cru CR ified physically Jesus Christ the son of God and now today by the same word and by the the same Holy Spirit and the same word I I wish to show the churches that there where they stand uh that they are doing the same thing today and the Bible said they would do it and prove that this is the day that we're living in it could not been done a few years ago I say 50 years ago it could not been done but today this is very timely and it could not have been done maybe 10 years ago but it can be done today because the the time is run out we are we are at the end time and I believe as a servant that we are we're just about to cross from this land to another therefore the time for repentance for a nation is gone I believe that this nation cannot repent I believe that it's crossed the line between mercy and judgment I believe she's toddling in the bounds brother brandham before you start your case how you going to prove that just this that we're guilty of the same sins that God destroyed the World by in the andian world we're guilty of the same sins that he destroyed the world in Sodom and gomorra and now and we got all the same spiritual evidence laying here before us all the same spiritual evidence worldwide known that brought down the mercies of God upon those Generations that also to reject brought judgment so if this generation has rejected the same Mercy that was spurned in them days God would be unjust to let them get by without judgment Jack Moore a friend of mine once said if this nation gets by without a punishment from God then God will be obligated to raise up solom Gore and apologize for burning them up now we know that spiritually they're doing the same thing today for they are doing it to for the same purpose and in the same way that they did in the crucifixion of the Lord physically they're doing it because of jealousy because of spiritual blindness that they don't want to see they won't listen to it Jesus in his journey here on Earth he said well did Isaiah speak of you you got eyes and can't see in ears and can't hear the same reason the same um the same purpose and the same reasonings they're bringing the crucifixion of Christ a new aresh as we'll get to it after a while for the same reasons that they did that they cannot find nothing against it they're Daron to try to challenge it and they know the evidence is there and they know the Bible says so and the only thing they can do is blaspheme it exactly so and all this the same reasons now upon this basis I challenge this generation of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ for a crucifying and guilty with dirty Wicked selfish denominational hands as crucifying the Prince of Life that wanted to present itself to the people people you say the same person in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and manifested itself the word was manifested in flesh and they condemned the Flesh and put it to death because the word was manifested Hebrews 138 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's the same word amen and for the same reason they are trying to crucify the word now to my text to break back upon the subject that I want to take there the four words let's explain there there the most holy city in the world Jerusalem there the most religious city in the world there they the most religious people people in the world at a religious feast the Feast of the Passover there the most religious spot the most religious City the the greatest of all the organizations the head of all of it there they the most religious people in all the world had gathered from all over the world They Crucified the most shameful death that could be kill person could be killed naked stripped the clothes from him he he despised the reproach they the crucifix has a a rag wrapped around him but they stripped his clothes from him the most shameful there the greatest religious City they the most religious people crucified the most shameful death him the most precious person that ain't enough to condemn this generation there the most religious organization the biggest of all the churches gathered together in one place they the most religious people of all the races the people who are supposed to be the very worshippers of God they gathered at the greatest holy Feast they got the cleansing of the the Passover when they was brought from bondage into Liberty and there in that time they at that time the most religious people in their most religious feast at the most religious Place brought upon the Prince of Life the most shameful thing that could be done to strip a man and to hang him on a tree because cursed is he said the law that they worship by cursed is he that hangs upon a tree and he was made a curse for us stripping his clothes beating him in walking him the very God Of Heaven taking his clothes from him and nailing him to a cross him there they crucified him under Roman capital punishment the most shameful death today would not be shot the most shameful death today would not be to be uh uh run over by a car and killed drowned by water burned by fire but the most shameful death today is public capital punishment where that the whole world condemns you and calls you guilty and the whole world put their hands upon this man and called him guilty when he was innocent and he died under the enemies not his friends not his LW but under the enemy's crucifixion the Prince of Life the most precious person that there ever lived or ever will live amen Jesus Christ him the most precious person keep that in mind now as we build that platform around today could you imagine at a place like Jerusalem where for 2500 years or more that the people or hundreds of years I may be a little long than that might have been about 8 or 900 years or something I don't know it's how what the distance in time Solomon built the temple I imagine about 800 years something like that and they'd look for a coming Messiah they had gathered there for the worship of the Passover just think of it now the head of all of the Pharisees Sadducees and what have you one great Gathering to worship God Most Holy Place Jerusalem the Temple of the Lord and the people of the Lord took the Lord himself and crucified him with capital punishment such a thing now them four words they there they crucified him now you so the Bible you see it's just four words but the Bible condenses its truths now me I have to go way around and explain what I'm talking about but the Bible don't have to explain nothing it just is all truth so the the the the Bible don't have to explain anything it it it doesn't have to explain it because it is all the truth here is four words of its great chain of Truth I'll try to explain it and to try to explain it clearly would make a library there's no way for me to explain those four words but now let us by the help of him who caused it to be written try to explain these four words to bring it in such a way that people would understand it what we got before us now we got the first crucifixion laying before us at the most holy place the most religious people the most shameful death to the most precious person oh it's such a contradictory my my it's disgraceful now let's take first the first word there let's talk on it a few minutes before we bring the indictment we'll break this down and show you what they was doing then we'll find out if my indictment is correct or not there Jerusalem Most Holy simple place because the temple was there the most holy place because it the temple was there and Jews from all over the world gathered to this one place of meeting grounds uh for worship the most greatest place for worship that there was was at Jerusalem the temple was there that's it's written all men ought to worship at Jerusalem all right because it's a center of worship and today you hear them one of them wants to say they oh we come to these great conventions where these uh denominations have it and and then we have the the opening of the the Vatican City and and these ordinations of popes and so forth everybody says we all are to go to the campgrounds of the methodists or the the Bible Baptist convention or or we all are to go to to Rome and there were the Great Center they call of Christianity during the time of the last war when Rome fell these German soldiers many of you boys know about this them German soldiers got back up into the Vatican City there and firing out at the Americans as they were advancing brother Funk and brother Roberson and many of brother beer and many of those Brethren who was in that war knows and you know what we issued orders that they could not fire on that City Americans you stood there and you was a Target to them but at the West uh the Westminister uh Abbey at the in England you could fire on that all right that's where the Protestants gathered so it was all right to fire on that but not the fire on the Vatican because as president uh Roosevelt I heard his speech when he when he broadcast it that night called the Fireside talk he said when Rome fell he said it's such a shame because Rome is the head of all Christianity could you imagine a Protestant saying that so the great Center of Christian religion well we're going to we're going to place that like Jerusalem if you wish to if you'd like to do that let's put that at Jerusalem the head of all these other the the the Sanhedrin and and of the Pharisees and of the the Sadducees all of them went up to Jerusalem that was really the headquarters and in the organizational life you've got to admit that Roman Catholic Church is a mother of all of it am she sure is and it started from Pentecost that's where they got to when they organized now we the proest are just little sisters off of that church and now let's say it would be there at the Vatican today are there at Jerusalem as it was at that day when all men ought to come to Jerusalem to work worship why did they do it in the days of of Jesus why did they say all man should worship at Jerusalem for there's only one place that God will fellowship with man that is under the blood of the sacrifice that's the reason they had to come to Jerusalem God will never meet with man nowhere else but under the blood when you turn the blood down then your meeting place with God has been taken away God made his first decision in the Garden of Eden that man would only worship him under the shed blood of the sacrifice and that's the only place that God met with man then and that's the only place that God ever did meet with man and that's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice [Music]
