========================================
Praise the Lord, saints. It's going to be in the house of the Lord tonight and uh be in the Wednesday night. We will um just have a prayer prayer meeting tonight. We have a few uh prayer requests before us. So, we want to get into them right away and then uh we can be able to change the order of the service here. But, uh we are glad to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. We are glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight. And uh and also we want to greet uh all our dear ones that are streaming in the service tonight. And uh we just appreciate the Lord for giving us this time that we can come together. Strange enough uh uh this evening. I just have few prayer requests streaming through my phone. So I just called brother Lawrence and told him where we will have a prayer meeting tonight. We have a lot of request and uh again we continue to just pray that the Lord will take complete control of the situation around our our city and then also around the country. So, uh, let's just take our Bibles tonight. We'll read the Psalm and then we go right into taking our prayer request tonight. The Lord has been our refuge. He has been our pressing help in time of trouble. Let's read Psalm 123. Psalm 123 1-3. We read from verse one and to the last verse. Unto thee lift I up my eyes thou that dwelleth in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, and as the eyes of a median look, the meeting onto the hands of her mistress. So our eyes wait upon the Lord our God until that he have mercy upon us. Have mercy upon us, oh Lord. have mercy upon us. For we are exceedingly filled with contempt. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoring of those that are at ease and with the content of the pride. Amen. Praise the Lord. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Let me take our for prayer needs that are from uh out of town. We want to pray tonight for one brother Jim James. Last year he was diagnosed with cancer and he went through surgery and treatment. He has done uh well and he gave glory to God. He went back for the check for a checkup a CT scan and they found a suspicious spot and uh suspicious spot at the previous site. They are now scheduled for the PET scan. He's scheduled for the PET scan and uh so uh uh this brother send his prayer request. He want for us to remember our brother, brother James. And uh a prayer request here from brother Frank Prader. uh for a young uh girl named Rosie. She is 13 years old and being tormented by by a spirit of suicide. Uh praying and believing for total deliverance from that devil. Praise the Lord. 13 years old. She's tormented with a spirit of taking her own life. We want to pray that God will just rescue her. We want to also pray tonight for uh her sister Dina Scout. Uh she is fighting a severe UTI and she's in a lot of pain right now. Praying that the Lord will touch her and clear this up. We also want to pray for another sister Dynette. She is very sick. Uh been very sick for a couple of weeks ago and uh okay, she was sick a couple of weeks ago and got better, but uh she's back uh into that illness again. And uh she's fighting a very v and sick. Uh um all is why she's still caring for her mom. So uh we also want to remember her in prayer tonight. Praise the Lord. And uh uh so those our few prayer needs from from uh from out of town. We want to remember Sister Larose and uh she's down with the food and she needs prayer. Uh Sister Annette also calling. She's not feeling well. We want to pray for Sister Annette tonight. And uh Ben and the family uh they had to turn back. I think uh they're having u by visibility driving up tonight. So uh they ask that we remember they pray. Uh so And then uh um I have another prayer need here. Uh brother brother Hillary and his family text in uh also sister uh Richard uh she's uh uh under the weather. So she's uh will not be in prayer tonight. uh Wednesday, I mean on Sunday, uh I got this uh prayer request through the mail out there. We have a little mailbox that is uh stuck by the by the door of the church and uh we have kept it there after we we put the mailbox by the side of the the road and and I've always thought to just put a little note on that box for people to drop their prayer needs, you know, if they come by and I was not able to do it, but it looks like somebody thought it was a good place for them for their prayer request. So, uh when uh brother Steve checked the mail, he he hand me this and uh on the envelope, the person wrote they said to the prayer department. So, I think it's a it's a special need. And I and I really thought about it. I even sent the lady a text uh to to let her know that we will be praying for her need. So she said, "Please join me in prayer for my children, Isaiah, uh, Natana, and Tommy. I'm asking God to give them a divine healing and set uh, set them free from every bondage. May every obstacle and attack be removed from their life. May the Lord send uh the Holy Spirit to heal them physically and spiritually. The Lord is our strength. I have sent uh a tense offering. That's what she said. Concern sister. That's what she put on the first mail. And then I think after the couple of times she wrote another mail again. and uh uh with pretty much the same uh concern, the same burden. Good day, brethrens. Please remember my sons in prayer. They are having some medical challenges. Please pray for God healing, protection, and grace. Thank you. Praise the Lord. So, let's just bow our hearts tonight. Let's just bow our heads tonight. We want to remember this dear sister. Uh we don't I don't know her. We don't know her by name, but the Lord knows her just like the the Lord knows all the prayer needs we have mentioned tonight. He knows uh the area in the life of all of these different ones to touch. Let's just uh bow our hearts together. And uh uh we we want to thank the Lord for bringing us together tonight. And I just want us to go right into praying. Brother, you would just play softly. And uh uh I just uh thank the Lord for giving us this opportunity that we can come together this Wednesday night and we can be able to stand in the bridge. We can stand in the gap. We can be able to lift up these knees to the Lord. all the prayer requests that comes through uh text messages and I'm I I feel so blessed when I get these uh uh text request because uh uh I believe that God still answer prayers. I know you believe the same also believe that God is still moving among his people. Maybe uh uh we might not have the sense of much need but we know that uh many are the afflections of the righteous. God's children are going through difficult different things and difficult things as well. And it's so good that uh we can be able to just unite our faith together tonight and just call upon the Lord and lift our voices to the Lord and let's just give him thanks for bringing us together, blessing us since the last time we were here, watching over us, protecting us, and uh providing for us.

Heavenly Father, we stand before you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, Lord God, you have set this such time aside, oh God, Father, that you would come, Lord, the same way you came in Eden every single night to fellowship with your children. Lord, we believe that, oh God, it is in the same evening that you would come visit us in a special way. Father, may you break the word in your own manner. Lord, you knowing the need of your people. Oh Lord, I'm I'm just standing here as a vessel that Lord, I'm just making myself available so that you can speak to your people. &gt;&gt; They have different needs. I may not know it, oh God, but you know it, Lord Jesus. May you go touch every single one of of them. Oh God, may we come like that woman that had a blood issue. Lord, if she spoke in her heart, he said, "If I could only touch the end of his garment, I'll be made whole." Father, Lord Jesus, it was the faith, oh God, that made that thing to come to pass. Lord God, the same way, oh God, we're standing as Bartameus. Oh, Father, Lord God, at the at the door of Jericho, Father, crying and says, "Son of David, be merciful unto me." Lord God, you heard the voice, Father, Lord, of a man that is was in need, oh God, that as the word is being preached, oh God, Father, may every voice that is speaking internally in the heart of your children, Lord God, may you go in that direction, may you touch them, oh God, Father, that Lord God, when we will leave here, Father, Lord, we will definitely testify and say the Lord was with us tonight, oh God. Father, we trust in you, Father. We believe with all our heart that whatever we have asked in your name, it shall be given unto us. Bless bless the word now. Father, may you give us this day our daily bread. Father, we love you, Lord. We appreciate you, Lord. You know how much we love you, Father. Lord, even in the midst of our mistake, you know how much we love you, Lord God. May you come and take this word and bless it, oh God. Father, Lord, may this be a blessing to your children as we give this day into your hand in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless you, saint. Uh we Open the book of Jeremiah. Jeremiah chapter 24. Jeremiah 24. I'll try to go fast by the grace of God. Just pray for me. Uh feel a little nervous, but uh we trust that the Lord will be able to bless us. Jeremiah chapter 24 verse one. The Bible says, "The Lord show me and behold two basket of figs were set before the temple of the Lord. After that, king of Babylon had carried away captive, Jeconiah, the son of Joakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah with the carpenters, the smith from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon." Now, I want you to pay attention here. The Bible says, "One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe, and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten. They were so bad." Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Then said the Lord unto me, "Why seeest thou Jeremiah?" I said, "Figs, the good figs, very good figs, and the evil, very evil that cannot be eaten, they are so evil." Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And again the Lord, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, "Thus said the Lord, the God of Israel, like this good figs, so will I acknowledge them that I carry away captive of Judah, &gt;&gt; whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Gades, for their good, not for the bad." Did you notice that? &gt;&gt; He sent them to captivity for the good. Amen. &gt;&gt; But for I will set my eyes upon them for good. I will bring them again to this land. I will build them and not pl pull them down. I will plant them and not plug them up. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; And I will give them a heart to know me that I am the Lord and they shall be my people and I will be their God for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. as the evil figs which cannot be eaten. They are so evil. Surely thus said the Lord, so will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah and the princes and the residue of Jerusalem that remnant remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of Egypt. I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdom of the earth for their hurt to be repro reproach and a proverb and a tongue and a curse in all places whether uh I shall drive them. I will send the sword the famine the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that I give unto them and to their fathers. Wow. Jeremiah uh 29:10 Jeremiah 29 verse 10 the Bible says for thus said the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you are you here? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says, "For thus said the Lord, that after seven years to uh uh be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a expected end." &gt;&gt; Is that right? Romans chapter 8 and we're going to we're going to have our seat. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8:28. Uh I want all of us to read it together. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Since we are in the house of the Lord, we need to say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh whenever you're ready, we can say amen and we will start right away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that all things work together for good. to them that love God, to them that are the call according to his purpose. Is that right? &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Thank you. I have a little thought here I would like to share with you and I trust that it will be of a blessing. Just pray for me. Uh I really want to try I'll try my best to be very personal uh very intentional at the same time. Uh and and I know that this can be of a blessing. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you love the Lord, you feel like there is something to say amen, you say amen to the word. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Uh I want to speak on the two the two baskets of figs. The two baskets of figs. It might look like a very strange title. Uh and we just read it. Is that right? Now there is something that I want us to focus together here by the grace of God. We want to focus on the purpose of God because God has a purpose. How many of us believe that? &gt;&gt; Now if you read the Bible, there were many prophet that went before us. They approached the word according to the revelation that was given to them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For example, in the book of Genesis, Moses says in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And later on, that was the light that was given to him. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But John comes, it says in the beginning was the word. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So now John is seeing a little bit further than Moses by seeing the logos. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; But in this time, we were able not just to look at the beginning, we able to go back into the mind of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, with the message what we have received, we're able to go back and the prophet will tell us what God was thinking. &gt;&gt; You see, because God want to express himself. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; So if God stay quiet, he stay silence, everything still remain in his mind. &gt;&gt; You would not know it. &gt;&gt; But once God decide to reveal what was in his thought, you come to understand his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because as we are going, we want to understand what is the purpose of God in everything that is happening around us. &gt;&gt; Do you do you agree with me? Yes. &gt;&gt; Because if I'm doing something, I want to understand Lord what is happening? Why are you allowing these things to happen the way it is happening? &gt;&gt; You understand? So now if you have the mind of God, you would understand why God permit things the way he permits things. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; all the prophet of old had the knowledge of things, right? But they might not have had the full understanding of why God was doing things the way he was doing it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But in this time with the ministry that we have received, WE ABLE TO TRACE BACK BEYOND what God had before even anything was created. &gt;&gt; So if we able to capture those things that brother Venom is saying about what was in the back part of God's mind, then we can be able to understand what was his purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; So everything that is happening around us has a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham says something as an introduction. I wish to to to open with this quotation in the message uh the context. Brother Benham is praying. This is the end of 1962 entering into 1963. Right? Brother Benham is praying. It says heavenly father as we stand here as many thoughts is dying out in our heart &gt;&gt; and of the mistake of last year and we are approaching the death of 62 right &gt;&gt; and the birth of 63. &gt;&gt; It says oh God may we be one step higher up the ladder. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It says until we can see what Jesus. Are you with me? Respond with me. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can see what Jesus and what his program. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says, "May everyone, everyone here, Lord, in prayer, while the old year is dying, the new birth of of of a new year is coming, may the old man's sin and unbelief die out in our heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the new birth come in with the 19 what? 63. &gt;&gt; 63. and like a rushing mighty wind that may fill our being and make us a new creature in Christ. &gt;&gt; So in 1963 is coming the opening of the seal. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham want us to focus on Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says may we see what Jesus Christ and his program. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Because this this prayer here is very important. &gt;&gt; We entering into a glorious year &gt;&gt; that the word will be open. Brother says, "Let's seek Jesus Christ. We want to see Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We coming to church not to see one another. Though it's good, but we want to see Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We want to see his thoughts. &gt;&gt; We want to see understand his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we understand his purpose, then we'll be actually at peace to know that all things are working what? For good. &gt;&gt; Not to everyone to the core. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now I want to break that scripture just a little bit here because I don't like just statement to go. Let's dig a little bit into when Paul is speaking. It says we know, can you give me give me that scripture again? Romans chapter 8:28. This is addressing to the believer and we has to do with himself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding? &gt;&gt; So Paul is a believer and he's also speaking on behalf of the believers. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We know it's not a guest thing. When it says we know, &gt;&gt; it's not guessing, &gt;&gt; right? It's not wishing. It's actually settling a with confidence. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing here? &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT ALL things &gt;&gt; literally everything in the scope of life, &gt;&gt; pleasant things, painful things, clear things, confusing things, sickness and health. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Satisfaction and disappointment are part of this all. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this all if anything good happened to you is still part of the all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If something bad happened to you is still part of that all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes. So those things which it can be an event, it can be a circumstance, &gt;&gt; you can lose something, you can deal with a trial, you can actually deal with a a delay. &gt;&gt; You can pray about something but it's delaying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IT'S PART OF THAT ALL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So your blessing, YOUR PROSPERITY ARE PART OF THAT ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when it says work together, &gt;&gt; work together, it means the good and and bad. Both of them are together. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, man. I don't know if somebody's catching this. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER NOW. THEY'RE COMING AS A PACKAGE. &gt;&gt; Because they're part of what? Of the all. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. the good and bad that are happening to us, they are made to cooperate together toward a an outcome, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That God intends. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; SO ALL OF THEM TOGETHER ARE WORKING, THEY'RE WORKING together for a purpose for good means that it's going to be beneficiary to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just the good things, the bad things, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. they still going to be beneficiary to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will bring deepness of revelation to you. &gt;&gt; You would come to the understanding. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It will bring you to a total obedience to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IT WILL SHAPE YOUR CHARACTER IN A CERTAIN WAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So something that is beneficiary to you, you may not agree with it, &gt;&gt; but God knows better than you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is good for you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; To them that love. Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; Is those that their heart will be turned. Those that their heart, IT'S NOT JUST, OH, I COME to church because of this, but it's a matter of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. is those that desire to keep his commandments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those that longing a closer walk to God with God. &gt;&gt; It says the call. You cannot be called until the father draws you first. Nobody can come to me unless the father draws him first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that call right according to his purpose. What is a purpose? is a reason for which something is done or created or which something exists. So everything that is on earth there is a purpose behind it. &gt;&gt; There is a good purpose and there's a bad purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can look at a a very bad person. You look at them and say, YOU KNOW WHY God brought them? They were there for a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. The good people on the other side also they are there for a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The good fig and the bad figs, the naughty figs, both of them are there for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now Elohim had a purpose in his mind, right? &gt;&gt; He he he he won it. Brother Bam says something here in the word. Oh my goodness, I love this. Water baptism. Brother Benham says 1961 he says as God in the beginning knew that men would fall. So God in his mind he knew that men would fall. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; God in the beginning knowed that men would fall. Therefore he put him on the free moral agency. Now saints I want you to catch this very carefully. Why God had put men on the free moral agency? The free moral agency is the ability for men to choose. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother says he put men on the free agency knowing because he could display his attribute to be a father, to be a son, to be a healer, to be a savior. That's something a attribute is a thought. So God in his thoughts, he want to be a savior. He want to be a redeemer. He want to heal you. He want to save you. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HE DOES WHEN HE BRINGS men on earth, he gives Adam the free moral agency. Why did God give him the free more agency? Are you with me? Are we together? Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how could it save less something lost? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Right. &gt;&gt; And in God was the attribute before there was even was an angel or a molecule or anything. God was by himself alone. But it wasn't God because God is object of worship. There was nothing for him to worship. Nothing could worship him. But his attribute displayed something and made an angel. Then it was God. So what made God God? Because he actually created a subject to worship him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Then he was God. Then he made men and give him free moral agency. &gt;&gt; He fell. So there is something here that you have to understand. When the fall happened in the garden of Eden, right, Eve was deceived. How many of us would agree with it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Adam, but says Adam deliberately made the choice. &gt;&gt; Are you are you with me? &gt;&gt; He willingly made the choice. How did he make the choice? Because of the freemore agency. &gt;&gt; Are you are you are you catching the purpose of God here? &gt;&gt; Amen. So God give men the free more agency TO CHOOSE &gt;&gt; BUT YET IN HIS mind he want to be a savior but there's nobody lost. &gt;&gt; There's nobody that you know the the fall actually pushes him to fulfill what was in his mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But at that moment AS HE'S THINKING NOBODY HAD FALLEN YET. YES. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD when he creates man, he gives him the ability to choose. &gt;&gt; But yet in the midst of it, Adam had the mind of God. &gt;&gt; So when Eve fell, Adam accepted to take his bride just as he was because of what? Redemption. &gt;&gt; That was God's character in Adam. &gt;&gt; So he gives him the free angely. He give him also his nature to display something later on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you Are we together? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He fell then when he fell he becomes right &gt;&gt; a savior. &gt;&gt; So whatever was in his mind now happened because he's desiring to be that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says in the form he took sickness so he becomes a healer. &gt;&gt; So all everything that was in his mind stop coming out as he desired. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See it's displaying God attributes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; No. That's for Adam. Let's go to Eve. You know our God does not make mistakes. &gt;&gt; So things that is happening in your life, there is a purpose behind it. &gt;&gt; Now in the in the other quotes there, the invisible union, brother Bon says when you see the woman a byproduct, right? I want to really deal with this thing, right? Just for a minute here. When you see the woman, a byproduct, not another female like her made in that order, knowing, right? &gt;&gt; She could be what? &gt;&gt; Deceive. God knew that Eve could be deceived. And God made her dust. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; God know if he did not know the end from the beginning, &gt;&gt; then he wasn't God. &gt;&gt; If he isn't infinite, if it isn't, he can't be infinite without being what? &gt;&gt; omnisient. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Omnipresent, knowing all things eternal. So you would tell me does the fall God knew that will happen? Yes. &gt;&gt; Because in his mind he wanted to display what his attribute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be a healer. He wanted to take your place. He wanted to feel what you're feeling. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But he can't do it as an eternal God as Elohim living by himself. &gt;&gt; So he has to come down to fulfill what? WHY WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND. &gt;&gt; So if you are sick tonight, you have the right to believe in God because that was part of God's thought. That's what he wanted to be. &gt;&gt; It's not really ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you need to be saved, it's not really IT'S ABOUT GOD. THAT THAT'S GOD'S BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; He want to be your savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. said, "As believer, we must know these things." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's the will of God for you to be healthy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just your will. It's God's will for you to be happy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So, he know all things and he had to to make the that uh that that woman. The man did not have a wife. The wife and the man was the same thing. He had the feminine and the masculine spirit in him. But see the attribute that in God had to be displayed. Are you with me? He was to be a savior to make everything perfect the way he had it. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Then there could be nothing lost. Are we reading together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there is something I want to add a little bit here. How many of us have heard the word weak vessel? Weaker vessel. Is that right? How many of us? &gt;&gt; Let's look at it. The way God thinks of it, not the way we divi. We we we think that God is meaning it, right? Because in his purpose is the one that wanted those things to happen the way it is. He created them. D. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's go to first Peter 3:7. I'm not getting into marriage and divorce, but I'm bringing a thoughts there, right? So we can all understand what God really means, not what we define it to be. First Peter 3:7, likewise ye husband, dwell with them according to the knowledge given honor unto your wife, unto his wife, the wife. So the man has to honor his wife. Is that right? Is that a scripture? &gt;&gt; All right. As unto the wicked vessel, as being together of the grace of life, your prayer be not hindered. So as a husband, your prayer can be hindered. Oh, is that is am I reading a different Bible? Is that a Bible? Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, am I reading the Bible? Right. No, but we have to say amen. It looks like I felt like I was the one saying it so it got quiet on. Likewise, he husband dwell with them according to the knowledge giving honor unto the wife &gt;&gt; as unto the wicked vessel as being hes together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as a husband, you can pray. God will not listen to your prayer if you're not honoring your wife. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Oh yeah. I mean that's the word. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 25. &gt;&gt; May the Lord have mercy on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 1 27. Sorry. But God has chosen the things the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. God has chosen the weak things. Oh, are we are we there? 1 Corinthian chapter one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Verse 20 25. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother one already caught where I'm going with that. &gt;&gt; So, uh because the foolishness of God is wiser what? &gt;&gt; Than men, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The foolish right of sorry, the foolishness of God is wiser than men. The weakness of God is stronger than men. &gt;&gt; So the weaker vessel as we define it is not according to the way us men think that weakness is because the weakness of God what seems what God qualified to be weakness &gt;&gt; it's not what you think weakness is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I in the word? Am I &gt;&gt; oh my goodness &gt;&gt; cuz sometime brother one talks about these things you know it's kind of passing but I had to address this one &gt;&gt; the weakness of God is stronger than men. &gt;&gt; So in other word in that way weakness there is a power that is behind it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We but we have to understand what God is trying to say but looking at the woman and say she is the weaker vessel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God has a purpose behind. &gt;&gt; He had made her dust. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about the immoral women out there. &gt;&gt; We're talking about women that are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we must know the difference here. May the Lord help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Corinthian chapter 20 uh 1:27. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound what the wise. &gt;&gt; And God has chosen the weak what things of the world to confound the things which are what? Mighty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God has a purpose in giving men the free mo agency &gt;&gt; and allowed the woman to be to to be able to be deceived. Are you are you with me? &gt;&gt; And the prophet is telling us that behind it God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not the way we think of weakness. how it should be defined. The opening of the word comes to bring us to the the full understanding of what God is meaning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the the seals are open. The opening of the seal is the opening of the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; So once the Bible opens is to change the way we think. &gt;&gt; Is to change the way we approach things. YOU KNOW SOMETIME YOU feel like you know God but you can't you're not even close. There is more to know about him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LOOK AT it in the sense of a human ability to look. But look at THE OPENING OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; How God sees it after the word had been open. &gt;&gt; Our strength, our weakness, God sees it completely different. &gt;&gt; That's right. our strength also. God looks at it completely different because we want to depend on his strength not our own strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the God the the strength that God is giving us should not be mixed with our own understanding of what strength means. &gt;&gt; Amen. because that will not be the origin the original meaning of that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It will be mixed with something different and that's not the word. So the strength of God is for you to forsake your own ability. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To surrender fully to him so he can take over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if they still have the human element in it, God cannot help it. It's a mixture. And I do believe that as we are entering into this new year, may God give us grace to seek Christ and his program. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the exposition church ages quote chapter uh number four. I want you to catch this again. Are you with me? You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was the part of his eternal and predestinated purpose. &gt;&gt; This is this plan was to be to the praises of the glory of his grace. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was the plan of redemption. It was the plan of salvation. Now listen closely. Are we together? Right. &gt;&gt; God being a savior, it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason &gt;&gt; and purpose of being. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; That is 100% correct. I like that. And multitudes of scriptures bear it out as dust. The very point verse in Romans 11:30 36 for him and through him and to him all things to whom be the glory forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Men could not directly come and partakers of the tree of life in the midst of the garden. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you are you are you there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next one. Brother Bam says that eternal life of the eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But God but before God could raise and save a sinner, he had to have a sinner. &gt;&gt; To raise and save. &gt;&gt; Men had to fall. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Right. The fall which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall. Satan had to come through the flesh also. But Satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would Christ come in human flesh to restore the fall the fallen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Right? &gt;&gt; But there was an animal, the serpent, so close to man that Satan could get to that beast and through that beast could get the human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's continue again. Even as Jesus would would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human body even to the extent of the of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies like unto him in his glorifi glorified one. That's what God worked out here in the garden. Are we are we reading together? That's what God worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does it change the way we view things a little bit here? Do you see that? &gt;&gt; But I want you to catch this. I want you to catch this statement very carefully. Brother Benham says, "And when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God, &gt;&gt; this is powerful." Yes. &gt;&gt; And when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God, then men could not get to the tree of life in the garden. &gt;&gt; So even Satan was a tool into God's hand. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan had to bring about that which was necessary. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; So in other words, Satan has also a purpose. &gt;&gt; So he sickness does not come from God. &gt;&gt; God is not the author of sickness. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Satan is the author of sickness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS ONE thing I want to tell you tonight. If sickness get into your body is because God has allow it to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not under the control of Satan. Let's just tell it. LET'S JUST SAY IT OPENLY. &gt;&gt; SATAN, you have no control over my body. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody's not hearing me. Let's repeat it together. &gt;&gt; Satan, you have no control over my body. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to claim somebody else that is sick. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Satan, you have no control over. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because he has to bring that which was what? Necessary. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FOR THE PURPOSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Certainly not. It wasn't time. Jesus had to step into what? To flesh. He has to die. But Satan had to come up with all of these things. Lucifer came says, "You know what? I'm going to enter into the serpent." God is sitting there. You think he didn't know? &gt;&gt; He knew everything. &gt;&gt; He knew everything. But there was a purpose there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were just there playing like a drama. &gt;&gt; God comes. He says, "Okay, I'm the savior. I'm going to choose one to be a sinner and so that I can come and save you. It's like a big drama that God is playing. &gt;&gt; So once you are coming, you have to understand that you are part of that drama. &gt;&gt; But you struggling as a human ability. You struggle. Lord, I'm dealing with this. I'm But don't don't don't you know that you are a son and a daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are called for a purpose. If something happened to you, you should not be sickened. &gt;&gt; God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; You may not understand it. Look at Job. He did not know. He was confused. This is what's going on. &gt;&gt; All of these things happening to me. But down there, God knew &gt;&gt; that. Oh, I know what I put in that man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm not even worried about it. says, "Satan, go touch him." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You see the confidence that God has toward you, he knows that you will not fall. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows that even if Satan throws sickness in your body, you still come out of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When Satan trying to discourage you and point you to all the negativity, &gt;&gt; but Satan does not know that God has given you the strength to stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saints, this is not about us. It's about God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But what God is required of us is to trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To yield ourself to him. &gt;&gt; To know that God, you have a purpose behind what I'm dealing with. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Is it not the one who said in Isaiah 46:10, declaring the end from the beginning, from the ancient time, the things that are not yet done, saying, "My counsel shall stand and I will do what? All my pleasure. &gt;&gt; What God had intended in his mind, he will fulfill it." &gt;&gt; That's his own duty. So if you were part of God, you should not worry. &gt;&gt; He contin says, "Calling the ravenous birds from the east and the men that executed my counsel from a far country. Yay, I have spoken it and I will also bring it to pass. I have purposed it and I will also what? Do it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever God thought he would do, hit it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But we just read in the book of Jeremiah, Jeremiah 24 verse4 again. Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, "Thus said the Lord, the God of Israel, like this good fig, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Kadis for what? Their good." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Now, how can captivity be considered as something good? Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; How can you believe a God that is telling you that I'm sending you to captivity for your good? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But yet you're still standing here. You still believe in that God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that his word? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what he said, right? Yes. &gt;&gt; But how can captivity be considered as good? &gt;&gt; Because he has a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's sending you there because he knows the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before even there is a beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said he says, "I'm going to send you there." &gt;&gt; It's literally God says, "You know what? There's an ocean. You just jump in. You don't know how to swim." You're like, "God, are you are you soon? &gt;&gt; You never told me how to swim." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But it's telling you, I already know the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows that there's going to be somebody that will actually come and rescue you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you will be in the water though. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because there is a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing as God is looking at you say you're not going to die. Sure. &gt;&gt; But the following day, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you get drowned. &gt;&gt; You are drowning under the sea. &gt;&gt; But you have to remember what he said. &gt;&gt; Because what he said can never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing as AS PAUL &gt;&gt; IS INSIDE OF THE SHEEP. THE ANGEL MET HIM. HE SAYS, "NOT EVEN ONE soul will be lost." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He continually says, "Because you have to go see Caesar." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; SO IN THAT POINT WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN PAUL IS INSIDE OF THE BOAT, he's not even worry about what is happening. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows that I'm going to go see Caesar. &gt;&gt; SO GOD MAY NOT TELL YOU WHAT IS HAPPENING IN BETWEEN, BUT HE GIVE YOU THE WORD OF WHAT WILL happen later. &gt;&gt; So you have to hold on to that word that he said later. Don't look at what is happening around you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE? GOD PROMISED YOU A child &gt;&gt; and the following DAY THE DOCTOR SAID YOU HAVE CANCER. &gt;&gt; Then what do you do? You tell the devil I'm not going to die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God promised me what? A child. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I CANNOT BEAR A CHILD DEAD. &gt;&gt; I have to be alive. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WILL NOT DIE BECAUSE THERE IS A PROMISE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, faith say you you're waiting FOR GOD TO CONDESCEND DOWN on earth. This word as that very it's the same THING AS GOD SPOKE IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every line. &gt;&gt; IF YOU POINT AT THE PROMISE, YOU HOLD ON to that promise. &gt;&gt; He will be as faithful as if he was standing in front of you telling you it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us. &gt;&gt; How can sickness be considered as a good thing? But we want to see Jesus and his program &gt;&gt; in the midst of my sickness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. In the midst of my trial, I'm stepping into this year. &gt;&gt; I want to see Christ in his program &gt;&gt; concerning all the situation that I have. That's why when you go on your knees, you seeking the will of God. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Because you want to know what is his program. &gt;&gt; You don't have your own will. &gt;&gt; You have his will. &gt;&gt; John chapter 9 verse one. the healing of the man that was born blind. There's a picture there. I'm trying to have pictures so that the young people can love the young one can love that. There's a picture after that, right? Jesus healing the you know the the blind man, right? The Bible says something. Jesus passed by and there was a man which was blind from what? His birth. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And his disciple asked him saying, "Master, who did sin? This man or his parents that was born blind?" I want you to notice something. When the Bible get the record of these things is because there is somebody that will later ask the same question. Huh? There's nothing new under the sun. Right? So out of everything that you the disciple can ask the master is who sin most of the time that's what we do something happened to a brother we start imagining already oh maybe they have done this that's what the lord gave them you see sometime that's the way we think those disciple were thinking the same &gt;&gt; there's nothing new under the Jesus answered, "Neither was this man seen, nor his parents, but that the works," are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The works of God should be what? &gt;&gt; Made manifest. I like the amplified version. It says, "Neither this man nor his parents sin, but he was so that the works of God might be displayed and illustrated in him. So God allowed this man to be blind for a purpose &gt;&gt; because God want to show you know there's one thing saints about God about my God he likes to receive the glory &gt;&gt; he likes glory you know &gt;&gt; he's is a jealous God sometime &gt;&gt; you know &gt;&gt; all the time &gt;&gt; he love the glory so the only thing that you can make him feel good &gt;&gt; just give him his glory &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just stop worshiping him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a president of a country is passing by, you just come and say that person will look at you said this this is a good a good citizen. He will give you a little bit money too. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because people God love worship. &gt;&gt; Just acknowledging God you you're good. You're so wonderful to me. There's no more like there's not even one. &gt;&gt; I I've met people, great men, but they don't have the they don't love the way you love me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just tell him the truth. &gt;&gt; I was in that situation. Look at how YOU DELIVER ME. WHO ELSE CAN DO THAT? &gt;&gt; You start pointing OUT TO YOU START encouraging yourself in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The encouragement must come from within. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime we waiting for a brother to come but sometime you need to generate &gt;&gt; something from within positivity. &gt;&gt; Start confessing something positive. If you're negative that's a good start there. Just start saying good words. &gt;&gt; I'm going to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. I'm going to make it. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to die. &gt;&gt; You know, start confessing good because it's the high priest of what you're confessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Your children are going in the street, just stop confessing good things. &gt;&gt; They will be okay. God will help them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's look at the life of Joseph for a minute. If things happen is because God allow it to happen. Now, Joseph is born with a gift. Do you like You love the pictures, right? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying my best. &gt;&gt; Joseph is loved of his parent. He's only 17. is so happy say whoa I'm having all this gift all is good Joseph comes and behind him he has brothers that is that are looking at him say and this guy what is he thinking he is you see my dad gave him the the the garment of seven colors you know and they start hating him of course Joseph is also say oh wow I mean I'm the blessed among I had a dream look at what happened in my dream. But the bread was looking like no that's not of God though. All this bread that was not the right spirit in them. They had jealousy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. They had jealousy and that was wrong. And they took Joseph and threw him inside of the well something a sister. But I want you to understand something. I want to draw your attention to Abraham. Abraham had Isaac and Ishmael. How many of us know that? &gt;&gt; Right? So in the life of Abraham, if Isma was not there, because the people that carried Joseph to Egypt was the Israelite. &gt;&gt; I don't know if somebody's catching this. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH NO, ABRAHAM, WHAT DID YOU MAKE A MISTAKE WITH AAR?" But all thing was there for a purpose because Abraham is the son of God. SO NOTHING CAN HAPPEN TO ABRAHAM. THERE'S A purpose behind the life of Abraham. &gt;&gt; But when God is seeing is seeing Ishmael carrying Joseph to Egypt. Are you catching this? &gt;&gt; God. Oh my goodness. The word of God is beautiful. &gt;&gt; So if something happened to you, there is a connection somewhere. There is a reason. &gt;&gt; DON'T GET FRUSTRATED ABOUT IT. THERE'S A REASON. Now Joseph comes is asking himself what have I done wrong? Everything just start going wrong. Is it not the same way of your life? &gt;&gt; You try this it doesn't work. You try you ask yourself what happened. Then he found himself in prison because Pifera's wife wanted to take him. He said no I'm going to still keep my purity. I still want to be right. But yet he thought if he stood for God everything will be okay. But now they throw him in prison. Sometime we do things because oh I'm going to keep the word just because of the zeal. He has to be a personality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he has not come to a personality a change you will struggle with it. &gt;&gt; You start questioning ah I mean I stood for God. Why he cannot stand for me now and send me back to my parents? But Jo Joseph you have a purpose. You have a purpose in life. It's not it's not done yet. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Then later on he's having a dream in prison. Now he interprets Pharaoh's dream, right? &gt;&gt; And everything start going better. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Saints, there is a beginning somewhere. There is something in between &gt;&gt; and there's going to be a restoration again. &gt;&gt; That's the process of a life of a son of God. So this where you are struggling with this is just the middle ground. There is something that is good coming. &gt;&gt; Job was happy. Everything is happening where he got to a place where he FOUND HIMSELF IN THE AIRSHIP. BUT YOU MUST as the son of God, a son of God, you must understand that oh &gt;&gt; God is about to restore me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as you are walking, you must have faith. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; That he will restore me because I'm a son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If he did it for Abraham, Isaac, Joseph, he will also do it for me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because why? God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he's elevated to power. But his brethren comes and and they kneel down and Joseph cries and you know and and and and gather all his brethren together, right? But Joseph, if he was not changed, he could have taken a a sword. He said, "Let me kill those people." But Joseph understood. &gt;&gt; He told them. He says it was not because of you. It was God's purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He understood by revelation. &gt;&gt; That it's not about you. &gt;&gt; It's about a purpose that God had in the back part of his mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No revenge, but understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's look at Jonah. Are we together? We still here, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm touching some points, &gt;&gt; but later on the Holy Spirit will minister to you. &gt;&gt; Jonah, this man, God knew that Jonah would not want to go because God knows the end before the beginning. Is that right? We just read it. So God is choosing a weak man who will now go. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. For a job. &gt;&gt; He's not choosing somebody who say, "Oh Lord, yes, I'll go right away." &gt;&gt; No, he's choosing somebody that God knows that this guy will say, "No, I'm not going to go." But God says, "Jonah, you go to Nineveh." Jonah said, "No, no, no. I'm not. I'm going to Tarses." God says, "Okay, that's fine." And when Jonah is speaking, he's saying, "No, I'm not going to do it. These people need to die." &gt;&gt; Is it not the permissive will of God? &gt;&gt; Is it? How many of us can say it's a permissive? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Is it disobedience? Did he disobey going to Tashes? &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. Come on. We have to be honest. &gt;&gt; It's okay. &gt;&gt; He disobey, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I'll say yes. Then he get to the boat. He says, "No, you know what? I'm going to go sleep under there. Nobody will know." The God say, "Oh, okay." He send you know a storm. And when the storm happened, THEY SAID, "JONAH, WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING? WHY ARE YOU laying there? WHAT'S GOING ON?" JONAH comes and say, you know, maybe it's because oh my God, these men that did not even know God kneel down AND START PRAYING. FATHER, PLEASE. PLEASE. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine &gt;&gt; a backsliding prophet, &gt;&gt; a disobedient prophet gone, but yet the people can actually recognize the God of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And kneel down and start confessing the sin. God heard their prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because of Jonah. They might have not even know God, &gt;&gt; but because of that circumstance, &gt;&gt; they came to know the God of heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things that are happening in our life, it is for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not over yet. It goes there, you know, and they throw Jonah, you're right, off board, right? Is that right? And then the well came and swallow him, right? And he goes there, he pray, you know, and he spent three days and what? Three days and three nights. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So let me stop you here. So if Jonah went straight to Nineveh, Jesus would not use that as a sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Because he said as Jonah was three days and three nights. So Jonah going to Tarsus &gt;&gt; was there for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All things work for good. It goes to Tarses and whatever happened, right? And then and and he spent three days and three nights. But on the other side, the God of the Ninevite is a whale. &gt;&gt; These people don't even know God. But they're sitting by the beach. They see this man coming out of the whale belly. That's a whole conviction by itself. &gt;&gt; It says, "What? &gt;&gt; We believe in a God, but this man is coming out of the well means that this must be the God of heaven and earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible says &gt;&gt; Jonah was a sign. &gt;&gt; The man Jonah was a sign. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then he comes out. He just preaches a little sermon. People start repenting. Said you see the purpose of God is powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It looks at time is not our friend. And I could have continued, but I might actually stop. I'm going to close with David and I'm going to close. So, please forgive me. Do you give me like less than 10 minutes or something? Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Five minutes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Five 10 minutes. &gt;&gt; David here, the Bible says second king verse 17 verse 7. I want you to catch this. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Bible says Satan provoked David to number what? Israel. This is Satan that is provoking David. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To number Israel. God is not happy about it. God gets mad and said, "David, you were not supposed to do it." And he send David se God revealed himself to David Se right God. He says God tell David to choose these three things because I'm not happy. I'm going to bring judgment. God is mad. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God is mad about it. But yet it was Satan that caused that provoked David to number. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Right. Then God told David three things. He says, "Choose out of these three. Number one, either three years of famine or three months to be destroyed before the the fouls in other word adversary, enemies, oppressors, right? Why that the sword of the enemy over thee?" That's the second. The third one or as three day of the sword of the Lord even pestilency in the land and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coast of Israel. David says no I don't want to fall into the hand of my enemy. I would rather fall into the hand of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said no I better be here. &gt;&gt; And the angel came on the camp and killed seven 70 thousand people. And David comes, you know, he says, "I'm the one who have sinned. Why are you destroying all these people?" And he cried to the Lord and all. David, you know, kneel down and repent. And God is telling David, now I want you to understand this. He tell David, "Build an altar for me." Said, "You know what? That very same altar that David built, that was when the tabernacle was supposed to be built. was built is to let you know s sometimes Satan can provoke you to do things but God desire he wanted to build a tabernacle there he has his intention he has his plan but if Satan did not provoke David would not have built the tabernacle there so saints in your life things that are happening You just ask for God will. Lord, I don't understand. Show me what this thing means. &gt;&gt; And I do believe with all my heart, the Lord will reveal it unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord will reveal unto you. I'm closing with this last quote. I'm going to skip different things, but that's okay. The Lord will help us another time to touch on something different by his grace. I'm going to appreciate brother. How many of us love brother one? Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to appreciate, you know, for giving us the opportunity to speak tonight. God bless you, sir. &gt;&gt; Quote six. We're just going to go to six. I'm going to skip this. Brother Benham says, "God purpose can never be defeated. There is nothing can defeat it." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how happy are we to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the living God that there is neither things present, no things that can come. There is no sickness, no sorrow, no death, no peril, no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. what God has imagined in his mind, &gt;&gt; what God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass. There is no demon, there is no power, there is nothing can ever separate God great immortal and eternal plan. &gt;&gt; It must be as God has said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. So you are not here just sitting to there's a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there's a purpose behind everything that you're dealing with. &gt;&gt; But you need to hold on to the Lord. Trust in the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's faithful to keep his promise even as the church of the living God. We are going through different things. &gt;&gt; But let us pray. Let's hold on to the word of God. &gt;&gt; If we are dealing with things in our life, the word is there.

It's not just the preacher. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine every single one of us go home and take time to study the message? &gt;&gt; Can you just imagine all of us really taking the word and and really praying and seeking the Lord's face? What will happen in this place? It's not the size of a church. &gt;&gt; It's not how many people we've got. is the God inside of every heart that matters. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Saints, may God help us. &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
