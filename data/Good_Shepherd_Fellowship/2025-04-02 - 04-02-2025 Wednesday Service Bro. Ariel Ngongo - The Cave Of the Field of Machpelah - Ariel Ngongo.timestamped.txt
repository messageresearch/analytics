[53:43] father we want you to have your way Lord
[53:46] we have worship you father because Angel
[53:49] can do they cannot do it the right way
[53:52] because they didn't need a redeemer
[53:54] father but we are standing here because
[53:56] because we need a redeemer we need a
[53:58] savior that's why Lord God receive our
[54:00] worship oh father that can be oh God
[54:03] perfume of good order to reach your your
[54:05] place oh Father where you are father and
[54:07] bless us at this moment oh Father Lord
[54:09] we give every single one of your
[54:10] children into your hand father put the
[54:12] ministry out of the way father may you
[54:14] come and minister to your people I don't

[54:18] may you come and do your work father we
[54:20] bless us oh Father abundantly may I be
[54:22] sensitive to your spirit oh God to go in
[54:24] the direction that you would want me to
[54:25] be that your people can be blessed today
[54:28] as we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen
[54:31] Job chapter 19 verse
[54:37] 23 I'll try my best to go a little
[54:39] faster here because time is gone just
[54:42] pray for me Job chapter 209 uh job 19
[54:46] verse
[54:50] 23 I want you to pay attention on what
[54:53] job is saying here it's very familiar
[54:56] scripture all of us knows pretty we know
[54:59] the story of job now watch what job is
[55:02] saying here it says all that my words
[55:07] were now written all that they were
[55:11] printed in the
[55:12] book that they were griven in a iron pen
[55:17] and led in the rock forever you know
[55:20] he's Desiring so what whatever is's
[55:23] about to say he wanted to be recorded is
[55:26] that right it's just to let us know that
[55:29] whatever he's about to say is of great
[55:32] importance is that right now it says for
[55:36] I know my redeemer liveth how many of us
[55:40] believe that it says and he shall stand
[55:44] at the latter day upon the Earth and
[55:47] though after my skin warm destroy this
[55:51] body yet in my flesh I shall see God
[55:55] Amen now open with me again in the Book
[55:58] of Genesis chapter 20 uh uh 20 23:
[56:03] 19 now as
[56:06] job is saying these things he wanted to
[56:08] be recorded you know he he sought the
[56:11] resurrection but just it was a
[56:14] revelation because faith is a revelation
[56:17] he saw the resurrection by saying what
[56:19] he was saying
[56:22] here now in Genesis chap 23: 19
[56:27] the Bible says after this so which means
[56:30] that Sarah had died at this point it
[56:32] says after this Abraham buried Sarah his
[56:35] wife in the cave of the field of MPA
[56:38] before mambre the same is abon in the
[56:41] land of Canaan and the field and the
[56:44] cave there uh is therein were made sure
[56:49] unto Abraham for possession for a burial
[56:52] place by the sons of Earth and now
[56:57] I'll just stop there and let's go to
[56:58] Matthew chapter 27 verse
[57:03] 51 Matthew chapter
[57:09] 2751 or you can read along with me for
[57:12] this one I think the scriptures are on
[57:14] the board we can just read if if you
[57:16] ready you can say
[57:18] amen and behold the veil of the the
[57:22] temple was rent in twined from the top
[57:26] to the bottom and the Earth did quick
[57:28] and The Rock ran and the grave were open
[57:32] and many bodies of the saint which slept
[57:35] arose and came out of the Grave after
[57:39] what his resurrection and went into the
[57:42] holy city and appear unto many do you
[57:45] believe that amen you may be
[57:50] seated I just pray that the Lord will be
[57:53] able to bless us for the little time
[57:55] that we have
[57:57] uh it's it's always hard when you look
[57:59] at the time you're getting a little
[58:01] nervous but we trust that the Lord will
[58:02] be able to help us tonight I want to
[58:05] speak on a little subject that I
[58:07] entitled The Cave of the field of
[58:11] mpar think it is found here in the Book
[58:13] of Genesis chapter 23 and the Bible will
[58:17] tell us that this cave it was made sure
[58:21] unto Abraham for a possession for a
[58:25] burial place by the son of Earth now
[58:28] before I get really in the in the in the
[58:31] the the the the foundation of my subject
[58:35] I want to speak a little bit on the
[58:37] infallibility of God word right the
[58:41] infallibility of God's word now if there
[58:44] is one thing we should know is that God
[58:47] does not change is that right God keeps
[58:50] his word no matter what you are dealing
[58:53] with God keeps his word to the who who
[58:56] beli that now it has to be a revelation
[58:59] to you to believe that no matter what
[59:01] you are dealing with God still keeps his
[59:04] word is that right now we can rest
[59:08] assure anything that God had said in his
[59:12] word will come to pass and it is true
[59:15] how many of us believe that now our
[59:17] faith it's not based right it's not
[59:21] based on the shifting Scent of a man
[59:23] idea is that right or a men theology now
[59:28] our faith is resting on the unmovable
[59:32] Rock of God Eternal Word is that right
[59:35] because that word cannot fail right and
[59:38] in the Book of Matthew the Bible says
[59:40] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[59:42] word will not pass away who believes
[59:44] that now God when he says something is
[59:48] not a meant to lie is not a son of man
[59:51] to change his opinion he can just say
[59:53] something and say oh wow I did no better
[59:55] let me me change my opinion God does not
[59:57] do that if there is a promise in the
[59:59] Bible you can go over there and get that
[1:00:02] promise it belongs to you you have to
[1:00:04] believe that he is God and is able to
[1:00:06] fulfill what he have said is that right
[1:00:09] because what would be the importance of
[1:00:11] us to come to church to believe him if
[1:00:13] we we doubt in our heart that he's able
[1:00:15] to fulfill his own word are you with me
[1:00:18] are you with me who believe that God
[1:00:20] exists who believe that God is faithful
[1:00:22] who believe that God keeps his word amen
[1:00:25] so if you believe give him a hand
[1:00:27] because he's worthy of it is that right
[1:00:30] God keeps his word he
[1:00:33] infinite is infinite in his way when he
[1:00:35] says something it must come to pass now
[1:00:39] I just take you for a little minutes
[1:00:41] here when the Bible speaks here it says
[1:00:44] that the lamb was slay before the
[1:00:47] foundation of the world is that right he
[1:00:50] was slain even in the thought of God
[1:00:53] before even it steps into uh a a
[1:00:56] physical appearance he was already slain
[1:00:59] is that right so it took thousands of
[1:01:01] years before we see Jesus on the scene
[1:01:04] but God had already spoken it is that
[1:01:06] right he spoke it and he continues to do
[1:01:08] his own business because that word had
[1:01:10] to come to pass so Sint you can rest on
[1:01:14] that word tonight and even if you may
[1:01:16] not see it it will come to
[1:01:19] pass you see Believers believe without
[1:01:24] seeing you see other people's religion
[1:01:27] is based on something that they can't
[1:01:28] touch but your religion is based on
[1:01:31] something that you cannot even touch you
[1:01:33] can believe in Salvation of your child
[1:01:36] that is fully in the world you can still
[1:01:38] believe that God will bring them
[1:01:43] back you might be in the situation that
[1:01:45] you've been long waiting for a long time
[1:01:47] you say how can I get out of
[1:01:49] this you don't know or every single one
[1:01:52] of us have a situation in our life we've
[1:01:54] been praying about
[1:01:57] but we still believe we still come to
[1:01:58] church because we know that God what is
[1:02:00] faithful to keep his word is that right
[1:02:04] so if you look for example in the story
[1:02:06] of
[1:02:07] Noah he never reigned before who
[1:02:10] believes that but when God spoke to Noah
[1:02:13] he says build the ark he did not even
[1:02:16] doubt he never even know what Rin means
[1:02:20] so he took God at his word it was a
[1:02:22] revelation to him that whatever God was
[1:02:24] saying was the truth that he will keep
[1:02:26] his
[1:02:27] word so you see faith is not depending
[1:02:30] on what you can see it depends on
[1:02:32] something that you cannot see but you
[1:02:33] believe
[1:02:34] it and that would come to pass and Noah
[1:02:38] did the same he believed the word but
[1:02:41] now in the story of job here I want just
[1:02:44] to to to stop a little bit here job is
[1:02:47] the oldest book of the Bible how many of
[1:02:50] us know that it was even written before
[1:02:52] the Book of Genesis now the Book of
[1:02:54] Genesis was written by Noah by by Moses
[1:02:57] right but job Liv before Moses is that
[1:02:59] right now you understand that the book
[1:03:02] that's the prophet saying it says job is
[1:03:04] the oldest book of the Bible now if you
[1:03:07] you you you study just a little bit
[1:03:10] here job rested on the
[1:03:13] promise that God made him is that right
[1:03:16] or gave him he stood on the burnt
[1:03:19] offering remember the scripture says in
[1:03:20] Job chapter 1 that you know when the his
[1:03:23] children will leave job will offer the
[1:03:25] sacrif is that right how many of us know
[1:03:27] that you know he believed he had full
[1:03:30] confidence in his burn sacrifice he knew
[1:03:33] that God was able to forgive his sin and
[1:03:36] also the sin of his children it's the
[1:03:38] same thing as every parent would pray
[1:03:40] for the children you know offer a
[1:03:42] sacrifice and go on the knees and say
[1:03:44] Lord I may not know what they're doing
[1:03:46] but Lord please keep them because you
[1:03:48] believe that God will keep his word is
[1:03:50] that right now it was the same thing
[1:03:53] with with with job you know and the
[1:03:55] prophet says if the church could ever
[1:03:58] get to a place to where it could
[1:04:01] solemnly rest upon God's
[1:04:05] word the church need to get to that
[1:04:08] place where they can rest solemnly on
[1:04:10] God's word without even seeing it
[1:04:13] believing that whatever he has said it
[1:04:15] will come to
[1:04:16] pass now job had to go through the most
[1:04:20] trying time of his life and all his
[1:04:22] experience when he had been found in the
[1:04:25] presence of God a just man he was called
[1:04:27] a just
[1:04:29] man not because he did not have mistake
[1:04:31] but the bom says a righteous man is not
[1:04:33] a sinless
[1:04:35] man a righteous man is not a sinless man
[1:04:39] a righteous man is somebody that can
[1:04:41] acknowledge the wrong and say God I'm
[1:04:44] not worthy please come and help me that
[1:04:47] was this type of man like job he was
[1:04:49] called a righteous man because he was
[1:04:51] depending on his
[1:04:53] offering the lamb was there was standing
[1:04:56] in his
[1:04:57] place he did not have confidence in
[1:04:59] himself he had confidence in the
[1:05:02] lamb that's why tonight we say you know
[1:05:05] don't depend on your own ability look at
[1:05:07] the
[1:05:08] lamb I'm inviting you tonight to look at
[1:05:10] the lamb don't look at your ability look
[1:05:12] at the lamb if the lamb is worthy I am
[1:05:16] worthy is that right because in the Old
[1:05:20] Testament they were never EV they were
[1:05:22] not looking at the they were not looking
[1:05:24] at the worshipper they will examine what
[1:05:27] the lamb they say oh is the Lamb had a
[1:05:31] broken leg if if if he has a broken leg
[1:05:33] he cannot be sacrificed he has to be
[1:05:36] perfect they never look at the person
[1:05:38] the worshipper they looked at the
[1:05:40] lamb so if Jesus is the Lamb don't look
[1:05:43] at yourself look at your
[1:05:45] lamb and that's what makes you righteous
[1:05:48] because you depending on your lamb are
[1:05:51] you with
[1:05:52] me now if you look at the the the story
[1:05:56] of job here I want you to read up in the
[1:05:59] Bible with me in Job chapter
[1:06:01] 14:7 amen do you like the
[1:06:04] word wow we have a wonderful
[1:06:08] savior we have a wonderful
[1:06:11] Savior and you see job here was going
[1:06:13] through a very trying time very
[1:06:16] difficult time but now now now re and
[1:06:20] even before you go to job let's go to
[1:06:21] Romans chap 1 ver2 there is a principle
[1:06:24] that I want to lay there before we jump
[1:06:26] into the book of of job Romans 1:
[1:06:31] 20 if the people at the back can help
[1:06:34] this is can help us to go a little
[1:06:35] faster here so now watch watch this
[1:06:39] principle just for a minute here the
[1:06:41] Bible says for the invisible things
[1:06:44] right the invisible things of him from
[1:06:48] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:06:51] is that right you would understand why
[1:06:53] brother bham says God is in nature right
[1:06:56] watch this it says for the invisible
[1:06:58] things of him from the creation of the
[1:07:01] world are clearly seen being understood
[1:07:04] by the things that are made is that
[1:07:07] right even is eternal power and godhead
[1:07:11] so that they are without
[1:07:13] excuse so God if you look at nature you
[1:07:17] can see God in it because it is you know
[1:07:22] it's visible but you can understand the
[1:07:25] visible things but what you are seeing
[1:07:28] in in the visible things is that right
[1:07:31] you can look at a tree there is a
[1:07:33] principle in the tree that will make you
[1:07:36] understand
[1:07:37] God right you can't look at the universe
[1:07:39] you see the univ function then you can't
[1:07:42] understand God is that right because
[1:07:44] that's why the prophet says God is in
[1:07:46] nature now watch job now job in job
[1:07:50] Chapter 14 verse uh 7 it says for there
[1:07:54] is hope of a tree I want you to just pay
[1:07:57] attention with me here is looking at
[1:07:59] what at a tree is that
[1:08:01] right it says there is hope of a tree if
[1:08:06] it be cut down that it will spread again
[1:08:09] and that the tender Branch thereof will
[1:08:11] not cease though the root thereof wax
[1:08:14] old in the earth and the stock thereof
[1:08:17] die in the ground yet through the sense
[1:08:20] of water it will bird and bring forth
[1:08:23] but like a plant now verse 10 watch what
[1:08:27] job is saying it's saying but men died
[1:08:31] and wasted away yay men give up The
[1:08:34] Ghost and where he is where is he now
[1:08:38] job is looking at the plant are you with
[1:08:41] me I I want you to catch this thing with
[1:08:43] me just for a minute job is looking at a
[1:08:46] visible thing he's looking at a tree it
[1:08:50] says there is a principle in the tree
[1:08:52] when a tree is cut off right there is a
[1:08:56] for example in the winter you don't see
[1:08:58] the leaves you don't see the fruit is
[1:09:00] that right but job is trying to show us
[1:09:03] a principle here is looking at nature it
[1:09:06] says Nature has
[1:09:08] Seasons there is a season where when the
[1:09:11] tree is cut off there is a time where it
[1:09:13] will bu again right that's the visible
[1:09:18] thing right are you with me is looking
[1:09:21] at a tree it says the tree can be cut
[1:09:24] off but eventually he will bring forth
[1:09:26] again if he expose itself to water but
[1:09:29] it says now he asking himself what about
[1:09:32] men because I have seen men dying but I
[1:09:35] never seen the
[1:09:37] resurrection oh are you are you catching
[1:09:39] this with me so it see the principle in
[1:09:42] nature is wondering it says how can
[1:09:45] nature brings back again there is a
[1:09:48] quickening power Oh Glory to God there's
[1:09:51] a quickening power in the plant that
[1:09:54] even if it's cut off
[1:09:56] he will come back again but he looks at
[1:09:59] men men dies and Contin to die but
[1:10:01] there's no
[1:10:04] Resurrection that's Job chapter
[1:10:07] 14 are you with me oh my these things
[1:10:10] are very important and and I'm just
[1:10:12] laying a principle there before we go
[1:10:13] faster is that right now as he was going
[1:10:17] through the hard time of his life job
[1:10:20] stood the very the very Cal moment of
[1:10:24] his life he said I know my redeemer
[1:10:28] liveth that's where we read in Job
[1:10:31] chapter what 19 so there is something in
[1:10:34] Job that he did not know in Job chapter
[1:10:38] 14 because he was wondering about the
[1:10:41] resurrection but now in Job chapter 19
[1:10:45] he sees the
[1:10:46] resurrection he says I know my red live
[1:10:51] it was not just a sleep of Tong it was a
[1:10:54] revelation that came to job in that
[1:10:55] moment that if the plant can be cut off
[1:11:00] he will comes back again now I know even
[1:11:03] if I die I will come back
[1:11:07] again oh glory to God that's a simple
[1:11:11] principle
[1:11:13] there so job rested on the word the
[1:11:18] promise of God oh my goodness my
[1:11:20] goodness me now watch watch this
[1:11:24] principle here it says I know my
[1:11:26] redeemer leth at the last day he shall
[1:11:29] stand on the earth don't my skin warm
[1:11:33] destroy this body yet in my flesh I
[1:11:36] shall see God you see no matter how dark
[1:11:40] it seemed unreal it seems there is
[1:11:44] something that job anchored or rested on
[1:11:49] the promise that his Redeemer
[1:11:53] liveth so this F here it was a place
[1:11:58] where job rested his soul
[1:12:01] Upon A promise that if I die I will come
[1:12:05] forth the same principle is applying to
[1:12:08] a
[1:12:11] tree oh my goodness and that's
[1:12:15] where it was his burying
[1:12:19] place I'll just just bear with me a
[1:12:22] minute here you understand why I'm
[1:12:23] saying this brother says something here
[1:12:26] in the message on uh onment it says I
[1:12:30] want you to no this the future word I
[1:12:33] wish to say
[1:12:36] job specify his buried place when job
[1:12:40] died he was buried thus now I want you
[1:12:43] to pay attention here um you can look at
[1:12:46] it as a location you can look at it also
[1:12:50] as a place where the promise
[1:12:53] is so you look at on both Sid you can't
[1:12:57] look at it as a location where that
[1:13:00] there is something that will happen to
[1:13:02] me there is something that will happen
[1:13:04] to a specific location that will bring
[1:13:06] me back to bring me forth or to
[1:13:07] resurrect me is that right or also to
[1:13:11] die with the promise to of
[1:13:14] Resurrection do you see what I'm saying
[1:13:17] so as I'll be shuffling back and forth
[1:13:19] you would understand where am I coming
[1:13:21] to right now let's watch Abraham right
[1:13:25] right let let's just look at Abraham for
[1:13:27] a minute
[1:13:28] here oh my you see I love the word of
[1:13:33] God if if you look at Abraham for a
[1:13:36] minute
[1:13:38] here oh my how many of us belied that
[1:13:41] Abraham had an unwavering faith in
[1:13:44] Romans chapter 4:17 it says Romans
[1:13:47] chapter 4:17 it says is it is written I
[1:13:51] have made thee the father of many Nation
[1:13:53] before him whom he believe even God who
[1:13:58] quickeneth the dead and call those
[1:14:00] things which be not as though they
[1:14:04] were who against
[1:14:07] hope believe in hope that he might
[1:14:11] become the father of many Nation
[1:14:14] according to that which was spoken so
[1:14:18] shall that seed be right being now weak
[1:14:21] in faith he considered not his own body
[1:14:26] dead when he was about a 100 years old
[1:14:30] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:14:33] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:14:35] to what unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:14:39] giving glory and being fully persuaded
[1:14:44] that what he had
[1:14:49] promised he was able to
[1:14:53] perform now Abraham by
[1:14:57] Revelation when job died they bury job
[1:15:01] at a certain location but Abram says he
[1:15:03] was in Palestine is that right they
[1:15:06] buried job in
[1:15:08] Palestine Abraham understood by
[1:15:11] Revelation that he had to oh my goodness
[1:15:15] he had to purchase a land in Palestine
[1:15:18] because the promise of Resurrection was
[1:15:21] to be in
[1:15:23] Palestine you see he had the Revelation
[1:15:27] he says no job was buried in
[1:15:30] Palestine then before dur when Sarah
[1:15:32] died Abraham had the Revelation to buy a
[1:15:36] land a piece of land that is called the
[1:15:39] Cave of the field of
[1:15:42] Mella because why the promise of the
[1:15:45] Resurrection as job spoke he says I know
[1:15:49] my redeemer liveth he knew that the very
[1:15:52] same place that job was buried there was
[1:15:55] the promise of Resurrection there the
[1:15:56] promise of Resurrection was not in
[1:15:59] Egypt it was in the promised land it was
[1:16:02] in
[1:16:03] Palestine are you with me oh my I could
[1:16:07] have G gone into a lot here but let's
[1:16:09] look a few things here Genesis chapter
[1:16:12] 20 where we read but let's go to Genesis
[1:16:13] chapter
[1:16:15] 258 you would understand why it was a
[1:16:18] revelation to every single one of
[1:16:22] them because if you look at this parden
[1:16:25] all the patriarch and even later on will
[1:16:27] Buri in that same place so we need a
[1:16:31] prophet to tell us what these things
[1:16:35] means that's why without a prophet we
[1:16:37] cannot see it clearly we'll be confused
[1:16:41] now oh my goodness Genesis 25:8 and
[1:16:45] Abraham give up The Ghost and die in the
[1:16:48] good old age and an old man and full of
[1:16:50] years and was gathered to his people and
[1:16:52] his son Isaac and ishma bury him in the
[1:16:55] cave of what of myar in the field of
[1:16:59] ephon the the the zorite the hate which
[1:17:01] which is before mambre is that right and
[1:17:04] the field which Abraham purchased of the
[1:17:07] son of Earth there was Abraham buried
[1:17:09] and Sarah his wife because Sarah dies
[1:17:11] before before Abraham so when AB when
[1:17:14] Sarah died they bury her there because
[1:17:17] Abraham B the field right and bury Sarah
[1:17:20] and when he died Isaac and Ishmael came
[1:17:22] and bury him the same place oh my let's
[1:17:26] look at Genesis
[1:17:28] 35 verse
[1:17:30] 27 and Jacob came into Isaac his father
[1:17:33] in mamory unto the city of Abram which
[1:17:35] is Abron where abra and Isaac surgeon
[1:17:39] and the day of Isaac were 103 uh uh
[1:17:44] three score years and Abram gave out the
[1:17:46] ghost and die he was buried unto his
[1:17:48] people being old and full of days and
[1:17:50] the son of Esau and Jacob Buri him right
[1:17:54] now if if you go to verse 49 uh chapter
[1:17:58] 49:31 Genesis
[1:18:02] 49:31 watch what the Bible says it says
[1:18:05] there they bury Abraham and Sarah's wife
[1:18:09] they bury Isaac and Rebecca's wife right
[1:18:13] and they are Buri Leah that's now
[1:18:18] Abraham got buried there is that right
[1:18:20] Sarah was buried in the same place right
[1:18:23] Isaac here is buried in the very same
[1:18:26] land in the very same Cave of the field
[1:18:29] of M is that right oh my we contining
[1:18:33] here Genesis chapter
[1:18:38] um Genesis chapter 4
[1:18:41] 47 27 and Israel dwelt in the land of
[1:18:44] Egypt in the country of Goan now at this
[1:18:47] point Abraham Isaac Jacob when he got
[1:18:51] old Joseph right went to Egypt is that
[1:18:53] right how many of us know that at the
[1:18:55] end of the you know at the end of the
[1:18:57] story you notice that Israel moved to
[1:18:59] Goan to Egypt right they left the land
[1:19:02] of promise they went back to egyp they
[1:19:04] went to Egypt right because Joseph was a
[1:19:06] governor in in Egypt how many of us know
[1:19:08] that now the Bible
[1:19:11] says um and Israel dwelt in the land of
[1:19:16] of of Egypt the country of Goan and the
[1:19:18] the uh they had possession therein and
[1:19:22] grew and multitude ex exceedingly
[1:19:25] and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17
[1:19:27] years so that the whole age of of of
[1:19:30] Jacob was 140 years and the time Drew
[1:19:33] night that Israel must die that's
[1:19:35] talking about Jacob right he called his
[1:19:37] son Joseph he said unto him if now I
[1:19:41] have found Grace in th sight are you
[1:19:44] reading with me is that right put a pray
[1:19:48] thy hand under what Ma TI the very same
[1:19:52] tie that Jacob met God fought with God
[1:19:55] he was a prince with God he started
[1:19:57] becoming a he became a limping priest
[1:19:59] are you with me that very same spot he
[1:20:02] told Joseph now touch me on my
[1:20:05] tie promise me that you're not going to
[1:20:07] bury me in
[1:20:09] Egypt why all the patriarch refused to
[1:20:12] be buried in another location that in
[1:20:15] Palestine because the promise of the
[1:20:17] Resurrection had to happen in
[1:20:19] Palestine Oh Glory to God this people
[1:20:23] were this patriarch were prophets
[1:20:26] are you with me there were
[1:20:30] prophets oh that that that's wonderful
[1:20:33] how many of us love the
[1:20:35] Lord oh my goodness that's
[1:20:37] powerful now it says if a put thee thy
[1:20:41] hand under my thigh and deal kindly and
[1:20:44] truly with me Bury Me Not afay the in
[1:20:48] what in Egypt now let's go to verse 30
[1:20:51] and I will lay with my father and thou
[1:20:54] shal carry me out of the land of Egypt
[1:20:57] and bury me in the burial place is that
[1:20:59] right and he says I will do as thou has
[1:21:02] said now 31 and he say swear unto me and
[1:21:06] he swear unto him Israel bow himself
[1:21:09] upon the
[1:21:11] bed now you would if you read your Bible
[1:21:14] after his death they brought him and
[1:21:15] buried him there but it does not stop
[1:21:18] there let's look at Joseph a minute
[1:21:21] here oh my goodness how many of us love
[1:21:24] the Lord
[1:21:25] is is it is it wonderful we'll call it
[1:21:28] Bible study tonight right is that okay
[1:21:30] we can't just call it a Bible study
[1:21:32] here now if we read
[1:21:37] um Genesis chapter
[1:21:41] 49 49 verse I think
[1:21:46] we no let's 50 let's go to Genesis 50:
[1:21:49] 25 uh 24 and Joseph said unto his bre I
[1:21:53] die and God will surely visit you and
[1:21:56] bring you out of the land unto the land
[1:22:00] which spake Abraham Isaac and Jacob and
[1:22:03] Joseph took an oath of the children of
[1:22:05] Israel saying God will surely visit you
[1:22:08] and ye shall carry up what my bone from
[1:22:12] this is that right and so Joseph died
[1:22:15] being 110 years and the unor him and he
[1:22:19] he was put in the coffin in Egypt right
[1:22:22] now for you to understand what happened
[1:22:24] let's let's go to the Book of Exodus
[1:22:26] chapter 13 verse 9 and 19 Exodus 13:19
[1:22:30] and
[1:22:31] Moses took the Bor of Joseph with him
[1:22:34] for he had straight sown unto the
[1:22:37] children of Israel saying God will
[1:22:38] surely visit you and he shall carry up
[1:22:41] my bone away he with you right now oh my
[1:22:49] goodness so we see Abraham buying a land
[1:22:53] right in Buri Sarah Isaac came got
[1:22:56] buried to the same place and Rebecca
[1:22:58] Jacob comes he was burying the same
[1:23:00] space is that right Leah got bu all of
[1:23:03] them got buried there Joseph got buried
[1:23:06] there but I want to read a quote from
[1:23:07] Brother Bram
[1:23:08] here you see that's important that
[1:23:11] that's why Revelation is very
[1:23:14] important Revelation is very
[1:23:19] important watch what the prophet is
[1:23:21] saying here he says now Faith it's a
[1:23:24] revelation you know the book of Hebrew
[1:23:26] talks about by faith Abraham by faith
[1:23:28] Isaac how many of us know that now
[1:23:30] brother B is saying here faith is a
[1:23:32] revelation from God faith is a
[1:23:34] revelation there's where I want you to
[1:23:36] stay just a moment it's a revelation God
[1:23:39] has revealed it to you by his grace it's
[1:23:42] nothing you did you did not work
[1:23:43] yourself up to Faith you ever had faith
[1:23:46] it is G it's given to you by the grace
[1:23:48] of God and God reveals it to you
[1:23:52] therefore faith is a revelation
[1:23:55] now this
[1:23:56] men were even Abraham was able to buy
[1:24:00] that field because he looked at
[1:24:03] job he said job be had a prom by
[1:24:07] Revelation he recognized that even if he
[1:24:10] die there is a Resurrection coming for
[1:24:12] him so Abraham dies he buries Sarah he
[1:24:17] buys that land but that land had to be
[1:24:20] bought for a
[1:24:22] purpose and also for a
[1:24:25] price you see now if you read in Genesis
[1:24:29] chapter
[1:24:32] 23:9 oh my goodness we're running out of
[1:24:35] time but the Lord will help us tonight
[1:24:37] how many of us love the
[1:24:39] Lord you would have there's a there's a
[1:24:41] pattern that I'm I'm trying to show here
[1:24:43] before I go a little faster is that
[1:24:45] right now you would notice that Abraham
[1:24:49] was offered this land it says you know
[1:24:51] the the the children of Earth wanted to
[1:24:53] offer the L to Abraham but Abraham said
[1:24:57] you you can't read it at home you know
[1:24:58] the whole uh Genesis CH 23 but Jacob
[1:25:03] refused he says no this land I'm going
[1:25:06] to buy it because now he had to possess
[1:25:10] that land not free he had to pay a price
[1:25:16] you understand what I'm saying there is
[1:25:17] a reason why he had to pay it was
[1:25:20] offered you know most of the time you
[1:25:21] say oh wow I mean they give it to me I'm
[1:25:23] just going to get it no when it comes to
[1:25:26] most important places you need to buy
[1:25:28] it because we don't want anybody to say
[1:25:31] and get me out of it I need to possess
[1:25:34] it pay the full price of the
[1:25:36] land because there is a promise there
[1:25:39] there is a promise of the
[1:25:41] resurrection and brother bam says
[1:25:43] something in the future home he says did
[1:25:44] you notice Abraham when he tried to give
[1:25:47] him the land he bought it with so many
[1:25:51] shekel it was 400 shk of silver before
[1:25:53] the people people as an inside as a
[1:25:57] witness he wanted witness to be
[1:26:00] there there is a purpose behind all of
[1:26:03] this but let me shift just for a
[1:26:06] minute why did Abraham had to buy the
[1:26:09] land why he had to pay the full price
[1:26:12] there is a pattern here that God is
[1:26:14] trying to show us in his
[1:26:17] word in the Book of Genesis when men
[1:26:20] sinned in the Garden of
[1:26:22] Eden God's requirement was the the the
[1:26:26] day you will eat of this tree you will
[1:26:27] die how many of us know that that was
[1:26:30] God
[1:26:31] requirement and when men ate of that
[1:26:34] tree they did not die automatically the
[1:26:37] very same day that they die but there
[1:26:38] was a process of death that started
[1:26:40] right away is that are you with me but
[1:26:43] God could not overwrite his own
[1:26:45] word he already said it it says that the
[1:26:48] day you will eat of it you will
[1:26:50] die but God looking at his own children
[1:26:55] he could not kill them can you imagine
[1:26:57] that your son versus your own
[1:27:00] word you see what I'm saying God had to
[1:27:03] choose another substitution way he took
[1:27:08] a lamb and he killed the lamb to stand
[1:27:11] between Adam and Eve and a holy God are
[1:27:15] you with me and the lamb was the
[1:27:18] subtitute he had to stand
[1:27:20] between Oh Glory to God do you believe
[1:27:23] that
[1:27:25] that's when we were singing when I see
[1:27:26] the blood I will pass over you why there
[1:27:28] was a lamb that died and there was a of
[1:27:30] blood that was on the
[1:27:32] lant it's the same principle right now
[1:27:36] God could not override his own decision
[1:27:38] or his word because the penalty of
[1:27:40] Disobedience was
[1:27:42] death but God love was
[1:27:46] projected that it oh my goodness that he
[1:27:49] had to come up with another subtit
[1:27:52] substitutionary way and he K the animal
[1:27:55] so that the animal would take place of
[1:27:57] his sinful son and daughter is that
[1:27:59] right or the the son and daughter that
[1:28:01] fell you know an innocent
[1:28:05] lamb that had known no sin had to die
[1:28:10] instead of a guilty
[1:28:12] sinner now if you look at the Old
[1:28:15] Testament they had bulls and goats but
[1:28:19] the Bible will tell us that the Bulls
[1:28:21] and goat in the Old Testament was not
[1:28:23] taken away the desire of sin how many of
[1:28:25] us know that it was only
[1:28:28] covering the you know it was not the
[1:28:31] full picture of it but we just read here
[1:28:34] in Revelation
[1:28:35] 13:8 the lamb was slid before the
[1:28:38] foundation of the world but that lamb
[1:28:41] was not an animal because an animal does
[1:28:43] not have a soul so since death is
[1:28:46] required the animal was just a temporary
[1:28:50] or it was just a shadow but the real one
[1:28:54] had to come right because now the life
[1:28:57] that is the animal does not have a soul
[1:29:00] so when you killed an animal the life
[1:29:03] cannot be transferred to the worshipper
[1:29:05] because he does not have a
[1:29:07] soul but in this case Jesus Christ what
[1:29:11] the lamb came with a soul he had a soul
[1:29:15] he had a spirit and he had a
[1:29:19] body you see that was just a temporary
[1:29:22] thing that's what the Bible says the
[1:29:24] Lord having a shadow of good things to
[1:29:27] come not the very image of things can
[1:29:30] ever with those sacrifice which they
[1:29:32] offer year by year continually make the
[1:29:35] comment thereof
[1:29:37] perfect because the animal did not have
[1:29:39] a soul that life could not be
[1:29:43] transferred that's why we needed a
[1:29:45] perfect sacrifice thank you Jesus oh my
[1:29:49] when when God in his mind slay the lamb
[1:29:53] it was not an
[1:29:54] animal he was planning to slay his own
[1:29:58] son you see when it comes to Redemption
[1:30:01] God does not send
[1:30:02] Angels he comes
[1:30:05] himself because this is a greater
[1:30:08] business God had to come down by himself
[1:30:12] to become a man to die for you and
[1:30:17] I you're talking about
[1:30:20] love you're talking about the love of
[1:30:22] God for you
[1:30:25] he left everything he left the angel he
[1:30:27] left that glory to come down on Earth to
[1:30:30] become a man to take your
[1:30:33] place oh glory to God to take your place
[1:30:37] let me tell you something the lamb was
[1:30:39] an animal but my lamb is a
[1:30:41] human Hallelujah my lamb is no longer an
[1:30:45] an is not an animal my lamb is a
[1:30:48] redeemer Oh Glory to God my lamb has
[1:30:51] power to die and to take back his life
[1:30:55] again an animal when he dies they bury
[1:30:58] automatically there's no power to
[1:31:00] resurrect him back
[1:31:02] again but this lamb that I have is a
[1:31:05] human being he can't feel what I
[1:31:09] feel Oh Glory to God thank you are you
[1:31:12] with me that's why he had to be
[1:31:15] bruised right he had to be bruised the
[1:31:17] same way it's the same pattern he had to
[1:31:20] Die the death that he went through you
[1:31:22] know I was reading I was I was reading a
[1:31:24] place where brother is saying you know
[1:31:26] the David says that he had to be pressed
[1:31:29] on the side how many of us know
[1:31:31] that he had to be pressed on the side
[1:31:34] brother benam says you know when when
[1:31:36] the he died they pess him on the side it
[1:31:40] says you know let me just take a thought
[1:31:44] here it says Jesus did not die of a
[1:31:47] Roman
[1:31:49] spear are you with me that's not why
[1:31:52] kill him huh
[1:31:55] nther was the loss of blood that killed
[1:31:57] him is that right not the nail not the
[1:32:00] crown in his head of Thon it says he
[1:32:03] died of grief and heart
[1:32:05] Brokenness you know what the prophet
[1:32:07] says it says one heart Brokenness caused
[1:32:11] a chemical reaction in his
[1:32:14] body that's why the blood and water came
[1:32:18] together because it was a chemical
[1:32:22] reaction because the very same people he
[1:32:24] came to save they rejected
[1:32:27] him you see what I'm saying it's not the
[1:32:30] spear that killed
[1:32:32] him it's the very same people that he
[1:32:35] came to
[1:32:36] save can you imagine he left everything
[1:32:39] behind to come for you and I I'm not
[1:32:42] going to get to my thoughts but I just
[1:32:44] feel a pull to go in this direction I
[1:32:46] don't know
[1:32:47] why he left his glory to come for you to
[1:32:53] set you free to set me
[1:32:56] free he became a man but the very people
[1:32:59] that he came to
[1:33:01] save the very people that he came to
[1:33:04] save they rejected him and buried and
[1:33:07] crucified him you know John the Baptist
[1:33:10] ministry came one day you know Jesus and
[1:33:14] John the Baptist they knew each other
[1:33:15] they were little cousins how many of us
[1:33:17] know that they were little
[1:33:19] cousins but John the Baptist was a
[1:33:22] prophet he was a prophet God already
[1:33:25] told him he says if if you see right you
[1:33:28] know a dove you know SP like a dove on
[1:33:31] top of of a men that will pass by
[1:33:33] right then that will be the
[1:33:36] lamb and one day he was just baptizing
[1:33:39] people then he saw his little cousin
[1:33:42] passing by but whatever sign that God
[1:33:45] told him he se he saw he saw in his
[1:33:47] little cousin he says behold this is the
[1:33:49] Lamb of God that take us away the sin of
[1:33:51] the world
[1:33:54] behold pay attention look he was
[1:33:56] pointing you to the
[1:33:58] lamb but pilate however says Behold a
[1:34:02] man when he was crucifying him just
[1:34:06] before the crucify he says Behold a
[1:34:09] man that John the Baptist by Revelation
[1:34:13] he says Behold the Lamb of
[1:34:15] God so tonight I'll ask your question
[1:34:18] would you say Behold the Lamb or behold
[1:34:20] the
[1:34:22] man because he is my my
[1:34:24] lamb he is my
[1:34:26] lamb Oh Glory to
[1:34:29] God now he was bruised he was wounded
[1:34:33] because of the the the the the uh the
[1:34:36] transgression of the people he was
[1:34:38] wounded for our transgression he was
[1:34:39] bruised for iniquity oh
[1:34:42] my my my goodness may the Lord help us
[1:34:47] may the Lord help us
[1:34:49] tonight how many of us love the
[1:34:51] Lord now if you look here even caias
[1:34:56] prophesied you know when he heard about
[1:34:59] the resurrection of of Lazareth he was
[1:35:01] so mad he says no we need to kill this
[1:35:03] man right watch what he's saying here in
[1:35:06] the book
[1:35:07] of oh my goodness I'm not going to get
[1:35:09] to my thought because of time it says
[1:35:12] John chap 11 verse 49 it says one of
[1:35:16] them called cayapas being the high
[1:35:18] priest that same year said unto them ye
[1:35:21] know nothing at all now watch verse 50
[1:35:25] it says no consider that it is expedient
[1:35:30] for us that one man should die for the
[1:35:33] people and the whole nation perish not
[1:35:37] he prophesied without even knowing
[1:35:40] because this men that they were plotting
[1:35:42] to kill was the lamb he had to take the
[1:35:45] sin of the world he had to carry your
[1:35:49] sin and my sin that word had to come to
[1:35:52] pass
[1:35:55] but I'm glad that there's one morning
[1:35:58] they buried
[1:35:59] him right they buried
[1:36:03] him but on Sunday morning right he
[1:36:08] resurrected Oh Glory to God we were
[1:36:10] getting into sad Affair let's go to
[1:36:12] happy stuff now he
[1:36:15] resurrected oh my let let me Rush here
[1:36:19] do you love the
[1:36:21] Lord oh my the word of God is so
[1:36:25] good can you just imagine I I would not
[1:36:27] have time uh to read all of these thing
[1:36:30] but sister can you can you just uh look
[1:36:33] at the message atonement uh paragraph 90
[1:36:36] I I'm going to read it for a minute here
[1:36:38] now he went to the when you know Jesus
[1:36:42] died and he says father I commend my
[1:36:44] spirit unto you right it says cry father
[1:36:48] father where is that forsaken me you
[1:36:50] know it's you know you know the whole
[1:36:51] thing that happen is that right right
[1:36:54] but now the prophet would tell us when
[1:36:56] Jesus died his body went to the Grave
[1:36:59] how many of us know that his Spirit went
[1:37:02] back to God because that's what the
[1:37:04] Ecclesiastes says is that right but his
[1:37:07] soul did not rest how many of us know
[1:37:11] that because the man is a trium being
[1:37:14] right is the body the spirit and the
[1:37:15] Soul so his body when he died the body
[1:37:18] went to the Grave right the spirit went
[1:37:21] back to God but is so went to hell
[1:37:25] remember the Bible talks about the two
[1:37:28] goats it talks about the scape goat
[1:37:30] right so the the first goat will be
[1:37:32] killed right remember the goat is kind
[1:37:35] of the negative side of it right because
[1:37:37] a sheep God is represented as a sheep
[1:37:39] but he had to become a goat because he
[1:37:41] was carrying the sin of the world on him
[1:37:44] now that's a representation of the Two
[1:37:46] Goats right so the first goat they will
[1:37:49] actually kill him and the blood of the
[1:37:51] first goat they'll put it on the second
[1:37:52] goat right and then the second goat will
[1:37:55] be left in the wilderness he'll be
[1:37:58] wandering in the wilderness but Jesus
[1:38:00] Christ played the role of both of them
[1:38:02] he was killed right and then he was
[1:38:05] projected in the wilderness and he so
[1:38:07] went to what to
[1:38:10] Hell brother benam says even the Bible
[1:38:12] says he went to hell to preach to the
[1:38:14] soul that did not repent in the time of
[1:38:16] Noah in the long suffering in the time
[1:38:18] of Noah is that right that's the Bible
[1:38:21] he preached for them and after that you
[1:38:25] know Satan had the key of Hell at the
[1:38:27] grave how many of us know that you know
[1:38:29] brother B of call is his is three power
[1:38:31] he had all of that he had the control he
[1:38:33] had the key of death so any man no
[1:38:36] matter if you a a a Believer or whatever
[1:38:39] right when you die you will go into this
[1:38:41] section called The Paradise are you with
[1:38:43] me the all the saints they will go into
[1:38:46] that place where Satan still has the has
[1:38:48] the key because all of those men when
[1:38:50] they die they die under the bulls and
[1:38:52] goats
[1:38:54] the blood of good and go bulls and gold
[1:38:56] could not set them free they were still
[1:38:59] captive even though they were good even
[1:39:01] if they were righteous but they were
[1:39:03] still stuck into that
[1:39:05] place because Satan had the key even if
[1:39:09] you live right even if you better he had
[1:39:11] the key of all of that but when he soul
[1:39:14] went to hell are you with me when when
[1:39:17] Oh Glory to God when his soul went to
[1:39:20] hell he preached to the soul that they
[1:39:22] did not repent
[1:39:24] he went and took the key from
[1:39:28] Satan right he took the key off from
[1:39:31] Satan that's right after taking the the
[1:39:35] key of Satan he even kicked him do you
[1:39:38] understand what I'm saying now watch
[1:39:41] what the prophet is saying here in in
[1:39:43] the next quote sister give give us that
[1:39:46] quote it
[1:39:48] came what watch what the oh my goodness
[1:39:50] I love this I I feel good he says I
[1:39:53] can't see him you can read the whole
[1:39:56] sermon if you have your time it says I
[1:39:58] can't see him let take a little Peck
[1:40:01] into what the paradise into that section
[1:40:05] that all the saent were because he
[1:40:07] preached to the soul right he took the
[1:40:10] key of death Hell In The Grave right now
[1:40:13] he coming now when to the paradise it
[1:40:16] says I can't see him let's take a little
[1:40:19] peek into the paradise let's look over
[1:40:21] there I see Sarah and Abraham walking

[1:44:13] where you would take up in the morning
[1:44:15] the Lord willing when the rose up from
[1:44:17] the dead the Bible says according to the
[1:44:19] sin that's the very scripture we just
[1:44:21] read is that right many of the saints
[1:44:23] that slept in the dust of the earth Rose
[1:44:26] and came out of the Grave who was
[1:44:29] Abraham now it goes back to the very
[1:44:31] same people that was buried in that very
[1:44:34] same spot are you with me it says
[1:44:36] Abraham Isaac Jacob Jo job those who by
[1:44:42] spiritual Revelation revealed Revelation
[1:44:45] know that the Redeemer would stand on
[1:44:47] the earth what
[1:44:50] someday it says the first fruit of those
[1:44:53] that slept they was walking in the city
[1:44:56] and can't see Sarah and Abraham so

[1:45:25] word so when they die they die with the
[1:45:29] hope that they will come up
[1:45:32] again but here it's
[1:45:36] happening the in that very same spot
