[0:14] on that's a matter it's lot again
[0:17] looking out of his window and seeing the
[0:19] sin and afraid to call Sin Sin
[0:22] Hallelujah Abraham wasn't in their mess
[0:25] he was out of it he was a type of the
[0:28] spiritual church and watch what happened
[0:31] just at the end time just before the
[0:33] fire fell and those were Gentiles it
[0:36] foreshadowed the fire falling on the
[0:38] Gentile world today when the kingdoms
[0:41] will be broke up and they'll be burnt
[0:43] Heavens will be on fire sayth the Lord
[0:46] and they'll burn with fervent heat that
[0:48] was a shadow of it now this picture
[0:51] here's Abraham already out not in Sodom
[0:56] he was out of Sodom lot was still in
[0:59] Sodom strange thing one hot morning
[1:02] along about 11:00 it must have been he
[1:04] saw three men coming ordinary man
[1:07] walking down the road the path Abraham
[1:11] was sitting under the oath re resting
[1:14] himself it be not probably at the herds
[1:16] that morning come in almost noon time
[1:18] and he saw three men coming and there
[1:20] was something about those
[1:23] men that rung
[1:26] of oh my there's always something about
[1:30] God when he comes among the people it
[1:31] rings the bell amen they know it there's
[1:35] something tells them there's a
[1:36] Vindication there Abraham run quickly
[1:39] and said my Lord come by let me get a
[1:42] little water fetch it and wash your feet
[1:44] and give you a marshall of bread then
[1:45] you can go on on your road so he turned
[1:48] aside he run in the herd and got a calf
[1:50] and killed it had a servant to dress it
[1:53] went in the tent down below him and got
[1:55] Sarah to need some flour make some or
[1:58] some meal make some bread and make the
[2:00] cakes on the earth brought them out and
[2:02] served while they were sitting there
[2:04] eating they begin to notice this man
[2:06] kept looking down towards Sodom and he
[2:09] said two of them you remember went down
[2:11] in Sodom two went to
[2:15] Sodom please don't miss this I'm
[2:18] referring to what Jesus
[2:20] said two of them went to Sodom to bring
[2:23] out lot and what was ready to be brought
[2:26] out down
[2:28] there and them two it went down there
[2:30] went down and preached and there was one
[2:33] stayed back with Abraham what the sign
[2:35] he done they got a sign down there there
[2:38] was the sodomites was smitten and blind
[2:41] preaching the gospel is always blinding
[2:43] to the unbeliever yes and notice what
[2:46] done now this one St back here and done
[2:48] a sign before Abraham now did you ever
[2:52] notice any historian follow the
[2:55] scriptures follow the history there has
[2:57] never been a time in the church ages
[2:59] where a man ever went to the nominal
[3:02] churches out there in the world out
[3:05] there in the denominations there's never
[3:07] been a man that is named in like Abraham
[3:10] h m before but today they got one gr a h
[3:16] a
[3:17] m right going down there calling him out
[3:22] he's doing a wonderful job by Graham
[3:25] Billy Graham God's
[3:27] servant out there amongst the
[3:29] denomination
[3:30] politicians and so forth smashing at it
[3:32] the other day when they want him to run
[3:34] for president he flatly turned it down
[3:36] God bless him for it while them Whiskey
[3:38] companies he never got the first base as
[3:40] it would been they' Have Spent billions
[3:42] of dollars because he'd put them out
[3:43] anyhow those cigarette companies and
[3:45] things like that see he's out there as
[3:47] God's Messenger to
[3:50] sodomites exactly but remember there was
[3:53] one who stayed up there with Abraham yes
[3:56] another man not them two went down there
[3:59] like a modern uh evangelist went down
[4:02] there to preach notice there was one
[4:04] stayed up there two went down that way
[4:06] and one stayed here with Abraham and the
[4:08] one who stated Abraham give him a sign
[4:11] now watch his name had been Abram and
[4:14] his wife had been Sarah just a day or
[4:16] two before that God had appeared to him
[4:19] and told him I'm changing your name now
[4:21] from Abram to Abraham see g r a h a m is
[4:25] six letters man but a b r a h a m is
[4:28] seven
[4:30] seven
[4:31] letters H ending with the H up here in
[4:35] the church spiritual there was one up
[4:37] there to Abraham and notice what he said
[4:40] he said Abraham not Abram Abraham where
[4:44] is thy wife not s a r r a s a r a h
[4:47] where is thy wife Sarah watch what he
[4:50] said she's in the tent behind you and he
[4:54] said I'll visit you I'm going to visit
[4:56] you see that personal pronoun the one a
[4:59] car in to the promise that he had made
[5:01] that was God yes he said I'm going to
[5:04] visit you and Sarah in a way that we'd
[5:07] all understand laughed up her sleeve to
[5:09] herself she said me an old woman 100
[5:11] years old my Lord which was Abraham old
[5:14] also past time of life of that as young
[5:17] folks said well we canot have Pleasures
[5:20] like that anymore I'm old and he's old
[5:23] and said we couldn't have that so how
[5:24] these things couldn't be and the the
[5:27] man God in human flesh said why did
[5:31] Sarah laugh and doubt saying these
[5:33] things in the tent behind him now watch
[5:37] if that is the same Ministry that Jesus
[5:39] Christ had he looked out upon the
[5:41] audience and perceived their thought he
[5:43] told Peter who he was and what his
[5:45] father's name was told Nathaniel told
[5:47] the woman at the well when she said he
[5:49] said go get me a drink or bring me a
[5:51] drink she said sir it's not custom for
[5:54] you to talk to you Jews talk to
[5:56] Samaritans we have no dealings with one
[5:58] another he said but if you knew who you
[5:59] were talking do you'd ask me for a drink
[6:01] the conversation went on he said go get
[6:03] your husband and come here she said I
[6:04] have no husband he said You' said well
[6:07] for you've had five she said sir look at
[6:09] the difference between that and and that
[6:11] priest of that day that counsel living
[6:14] in a glare of another day they said this
[6:16] is the devil they had to answer their
[6:18] congregation to something because it
[6:20] required that but what did this poor
[6:22] little woman that predestinated seed
[6:24] laying in her heart she'd been sick and
[6:26] tired of that stuff she'd went on the
[6:28] streets as a prostitute
[6:30] but when she seen that she said sir I
[6:32] perceive that you are a prophet we
[6:35] haven't had one for 400 years and we're
[6:38] told that when the Messiah cometh that's
[6:40] the things that he'll do oh my that seed
[6:44] laying there jump to life Hallelujah why
[6:47] it didn't need no interpreting Jesus
[6:48] said I'm he that speaks to you
[6:51] Hallelujah that didn't need no
[6:52] interpreting he had done the miracle and
[6:54] had testified that he was that
[6:57] Messiah four recorded what God had
[7:00] promised Lord your God shall raise a
[7:02] prophet like me said Moses glory to God
[7:04] what was it a Vindication of the
[7:06] scripture she run into the City and said
[7:08] come see a man who told me the things
[7:09] I've done isn't this the very Christ
[7:12] isn't this him he told me what I've done
[7:15] now I notice Jesus that was him up there
[7:18] in that man at Teddy's back turned to
[7:20] the tent and told what Sarah was
[7:22] thinking about inside the tent the word
[7:25] of God says in Hebrews the 4th chapter
[7:27] that he says this the word of God God is
[7:29] more powerful and sharper than a two-
[7:31] aged sword of cutting to the S and the M
[7:33] of the bone and a discerner of the
[7:35] thoughts and intents of the heart Hall
[7:38] it's a word and every time that a
[7:41] prophet came he come with the word and
[7:44] he was the word for that age what did he
[7:48] do a prophesier who discerned the
[7:50] thoughts that was in the heart had done
[7:52] it in Jesus Christ because he was the
[7:54] fullness of the word and Jesus said as
[7:56] it was in the days of solom so shall it
[7:58] be in the com of the son of man amen the
[8:02] spirit of God would come upon the Earth
[8:04] in a form of human
[8:06] beings God manifested in human flesh
[8:11] Hall amen do you see it amen and would
[8:14] do the same thing that God did in human
[8:16] flesh it's Sodom right remember they
[8:19] were waiting for a promised son and
[8:22] right after that the promised son came
[8:24] that was the last sign that Sodom and
[8:27] Abraham's group saw before the promised
[8:29] son arrived did you notice that and now
[8:33] the church spiritual has come to that
[8:36] hour somebody said brother Brandon did
[8:38] you say that was God the Bible said it
[8:40] was God it don't need no interpreting
[8:43] he's Elohim that's what Abraham called
[8:45] him any Bible reader knows that Elohim
[8:48] the alls sufficient one he was the first
[8:51] the last the beginning the end Elohim
[8:54] Abraham called him Elohim God in cap the
[8:58] letters in the Hebrew Elohim just like
[9:00] in the beginning God Elohim he was
[9:02] Elohim manifested in a human flesh
[9:05] wearing human clothes eating human food
[9:08] amen a sign that in the last days that
[9:11] God will appear again among his people
[9:13] in human flesh hallelujah amen Jesus
[9:16] said the works that I do shall you do
[9:18] also and as it was in the days of Sodom
[9:21] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[9:23] of man amen that don't need no
[9:26] interpreting it needs manifestation
[9:27] that's what it me amen do you believe
[9:30] that Hallelujah let's bow our heads our
[9:33] heavenly father we give to you thy
[9:36] promise tonight that you said these
[9:38] things you promis them there's no one
[9:42] can make your word live but you you said
[9:44] let there be light and there was
[9:46] light no one has to interpret that it
[9:49] was
[9:51] manifested as we quoted Isaiah the
[9:53] prophet a virgin shall conceive she did
[9:57] doesn't need any manifestation she did
[9:59] it that's what happened you said when he
[10:02] come to be born in Bethlehem out of
[10:05] Bethlehem Judea art thou not the least
[10:07] among all the princes of Judah of Israel
[10:10] but out of thee shall come the ruler of
[10:12] my people the things that he was do what
[10:15] he would cry at the cross how he be
[10:17] condemned pierced his feet and His Hands
[10:21] he was wounded for our transgressions
[10:23] and bruis for our iniquity Chast of our
[10:25] peace upon him with his Tripes we were
[10:27] healed how that David said I'll not
[10:29] leave his soul in Hell neither will I
[10:31] suffer as my Holy One to see corruption
[10:33] and on the third day before the 72 hours
[10:36] could set in to corrupt his body the
[10:38] word of God said he'll raise
[10:40] upall they said they stole his body away
[10:43] they still believe it but we believe
[10:45] Lord your word it was manifested Jesus
[10:48] Christ raised up and he said although I
[10:51] Am With You Always even to the end of
[10:53] the world we believe that you're here
[10:56] tonight we believe that you're just as
[10:58] much Jesus Christ tonight tonight here
[11:00] as you ever was and you're only looking
[11:01] for eyes arms legs mouth Souls bodies
[11:05] that you can use to manifest yourself
[11:09] God sanctify us tonight that we might
[11:11] see the living Jesus Christ living among
[11:13] us let him come then will come to pass
[11:16] like the hunger of those Greeks who came
[11:19] that day and said sir we would see
[11:21] Jesus and they got to see him oh what a
[11:25] thrill it must have been when they
[11:26] looked upon him God you're the same
[11:28] today
[11:29] and you promis that if we hungered we
[11:31] could see you a little while and the
[11:33] world won't see me the unbeliever but
[11:35] yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you
[11:38] even in you to the end of the world we
[11:41] know that you're the same yesterday
[11:43] today and forever Lord the words has

[13:32] they're getting them together do you
[13:34] believe this that he's the same
[13:35] yesterday and
[13:37] forever how many watch these ministers
[13:39] doesn't the scripture say today Brethren
[13:42] that he is a high priest that can be
[13:44] touched for the feeling of our
[13:45] infirmities is Right amen how many
[13:48] believes that raise your hand he's a
[13:50] high priest that can be touched by the
[13:51] feeling of our infirmities then if the
[13:53] Bible says he's the same yesterday and
[13:55] forever how many believes that then how
[13:58] would he act
[13:59] today you'd have to act like he did
[14:01] yesterday is that right where's he at
[14:04] tonight sitting on the right hand of the
[14:07] Majesty his body the holy spirit is here
[14:09] in the building to make him known notice
[14:14] now look what happened when somebody
[14:16] touched His Garment back there a woman
[14:18] one day she didn't have a prayer card we
[14:20] say but she touched His Garment and when
[14:23] she touched His Garment Jesus turned
[14:24] around and said who touched me Peter
[14:26] rebuked him and said why Lord that
[14:29] doesn't sound just sensible like Well
[14:31] everybody's trying to touch you why I
[14:33] say who touched me he said but I
[14:35] perceive that I got weak how many knows
[14:37] that virtue which means strength went
[14:39] from me I got weak somebody touched me
[14:42] with a different kind of a touch and he
[14:44] turned around looked to the audience
[14:45] until he found where that channel of
[14:48] Faith everybody was putting their arms
[14:49] down oh Rabbi we believe you in all this
[14:51] but there was somebody really believed
[14:53] it and she touched His Garment and
[14:56] believed that she was healed but because
[14:59] she said in her heart if she could do it
[15:00] that's what would happen he turned
[15:02] around looked up on the audience till he
[15:03] found her and he said told her her blood
[15:07] issue had stopped and she was healed is
[15:09] that right now that's what he did in the
[15:12] audience of the people now I'm claiming
[15:15] that he is not dead he's just as much
[15:19] alive today as he ever was and the Bible
[15:23] said Jesus said himself as it was in the
[15:25] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[15:28] coming of the son of man
[15:29] now look no matter what kind of a gift
[15:31] that God has up here there's got to be
[15:33] one down there to to respond to it he
[15:36] went into a city the Bible said there's
[15:38] many things he cannot do because of
[15:40] their unbelief is that right same thing
[15:43] today you've got to believe him you just
[15:45] got to believe him that's the only way
[15:47] you can is a prayer line ready now
[15:50] everybody Reverend for just about 10
[15:52] minutes don't where get through that I
[15:53] got about 25 or 30 standing there but
[15:56] now in the prayer line each one of you

[15:59] that I am a stranger to you and I don't
[16:02] know nothing about you raise up your
[16:04] hand each one in a prayer line all in
[16:07] the audience that knows that I know
[16:08] nothing about you raise up your
[16:12] hand now now here's what I'm trying to
[16:15] say friends see now here it is all these
[16:18] ministers up here on the
[16:21] platform and Christ made this
[16:24] promise see it's been written when was
[16:28] it to come to pass in the last days just
[16:31] before the coming of the Lord is that
[16:33] right it was to come to pass
[16:36] then now that's the word that's
[16:38] prophesied today not Luther's light not
[16:40] Wesley's light and not even the
[16:42] Pentecostal
[16:44] light it's gone on up the road now now
[16:47] the Luther's all right methodists all
[16:48] right Baptists all right all them
[16:50] Pentecostal fine there's all kinds
[16:53] sitting here tonight it ain't it ain't
[16:55] it ain't the
[16:57] individuals what if the you couldn't
[16:59] never tell a Methodist anything about
[17:01] Luther Because he believes in
[17:02] sanctification Luther don't see you
[17:05] never tell Pentecost that sanctification
[17:07] all he's seen the restoration of the
[17:08] gifts he ain't going to believe that no
[17:10] he's got more than that see and that's
[17:13] the last Church age that we had in the
[17:14] Bible says there'll be no more Church
[17:16] ages but there's to be a gathering of
[17:18] the people see and here we are I
