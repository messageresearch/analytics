TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] let's turn over in jeremiah the 25th chapter and read what jeremiah had to say actually let's begin at the eighth verse because i want you to be sure to get it the 11th verse is where i had wrote down here to read but let's begin the eighth verse therefore thus saith the lord of hosts i just like that i can hear a prophet stand up with the saith the lord god brother that's it to me that settles it that's all of it thus saith the lord of hosts because you have not heard my words behold i will stand and take all the families of the north saith the lord and nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them again against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all the nations around about and i will utterly destroy them remember them were god's elected that he's talking about that wasn't infidels that were church members yeah moreover i will take from them the voice of mera the voice of gladness just like we have the day all rock and roll ricky and elvis and noah the voice of the bridegroom the voice of the bird or the bride rather the sound of the millstone the light of the canal and this whole land shall be desolate you're that private crowd this whole land shall be desolate and not to impersonate this great servant of god but i prophesy that this whole nation shall become destined god shall punish this nation for her sins if god would not let israel his elected abraham seed who he made the covenant and promise with if he would not let them get by with wrongdoings though they were religious to the core had the great churches the priests and the rabbis but because of the immorals and things among them and god made them reap what they sowed so shall we 11th verse this whole land shall become destined and astonishment that is everybody just looks at there they are they were so great look at them now and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years that's a lifetime that's when you're blessed old mother was a baby they were in there without a guard without a church without a song without anything for a complete generation so all that sinning generation died out and it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the lord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and will make it a perpetual desolation and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which jeremiah has prophesied against all the nation for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves themselves of them also and i will recommend according to their deeds and according to their words of their own hands for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me take the wine cup all the theory in my hand and cause all the nations to whom i will send thee to drink of it i know the word gemma i'll give you this message don't sit still don't stay in one place but prophesy to all the nations hallelujah do you follow him prophesy to all the nations show my signs and wonders let them know that i'm coming to do this and they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of the word that i will send among them what do they do in this very day they call you a false prophet call you a a compromiser call you a a fanatic a saucer or a dreamer of dreams or some kind of a mental telepathist they will be mad and the word mad if you'll break it down means crazy am i they'll actually go crazy and say oh pay no touch that holy roller yeah that nonsense because of the word that i will send among them you see the history repeating itself jeremiah wouldn't agree with this pharisees sadducees herodians whatever they might be he's he just packed a word out and it made them all mad at him what now notice and then i took the cup at the lord's hand and made all the nations to drink it jeremiah didn't stay home jeremiah didn't just stay in one little spot but he made all the nations drink it unto whom the lord had sent me jeremiah took the word of the lord the wine of his word and the wine is the power of his word wine has a power wine is an intoxication mind has got power behind it and i took the lord's word said your mind am i made it manifest the wine and the power that's in it i exercised before i am and they would not hear it god said then i'll send them for 70 years into babylon that's just what he did the righteous and unrighteous one alike now back to the lesson daniel had been reading yesterday daniel read the same word that we are reading this morning daniel read the same bible the same punctuation the same sentences the same things that i'm by the help of god will read you in the next few messages amen the came to show you that we are at the end time and daniel taking the word from jeremiah goes down into fablab and he wants the anointed prophet and he performed miracles time could interpret unknown tongues and done signs and wonders among them amen stood alone but jeremiah had wrote these words many many years before and daniel interpreted the word god said now wait a minute we're coming near the end time for i've already been down here 68 years and the prophet of the lord amen hallelujah my brother the true prophet of god that prove yourself a prophet prophesy to us i've got it wrote here in a book that said 70 years will be accomplished oh lord god we're nearing the end all that generation has died out what will you do now lord you promised to send us any set yourself in order to pray oh god if there ever was a time that we ought to be setting ourselves in order to pray it's now amen for we as his true servant [Music] we see by the letters of the apostles by the warnings of the holy spirit that we're in the last day the holy spirit speaks it in the last days man will be headed high-minded lovers of pleasure more than of god truth breakers false accusers incontinent the sponsors of those that are good i understand by letter i understand that therapy nation against nation in the last days i understand that there will be tidal waves in the last days i understand that there will be fearful sights like flying sailing for fear there'll be a perplexity of time and a distress amongst the people i read that they'll all go into organizations and denominations and have a confederation in the last days i hair in the understand days i understand they wear sharks clothes and walk with high-heeled shoes tinkling as they go in the last days i understand it will understand that the preachers will be false shepherds in the last days that will compromise i will not feed the people the word of god but we'll go after creeds and things instead i understand there will be a voice coming [Music] calling the people back to the original message back to the things of god i understand by the book those things will take place amen i understand that in the last days there will come a famine the churches will be so organized and so set and everything that in the last days there will come a famine and it will not be for bread and water only but for hearing the true word of god amen and people will go from the east from the west from the north and the south seeking to hear the true word of god but the churches will be so organized and tightened up if they'll fail to hear i understand that by book but in that day oh god there will be a branch rise up from david [Music] hallelujah before that day comes at the end time and he'll have a message that'll turn the hearts out of the children back to the fathers turn them back to the original go back again to the end and start i understand that that'll take place just before them and i see her going in prophets that israel will become a nation they'll reestablish the temple worship god will go to dealing with her again when she comes to your homeland oh two prophets arrested the gentile church moves out two prophets will arrive elisha and moses the israel will get it as we go through but to tell him all the way down what was determined for the jewish race all the way to the consummation [Music] amen yes a little bit and got the whole thing yes just to know daniel was trying to find out how your servant my brother has prophesied 68 years ago and said there's 70 years this people are staying here all the old generations practically gone now there's an old pentecostal generation raised up 40 years ago old fighters is called they organized and beaten fussed all down through mount harbon nebo all through there but finally we're at the river now he's going to raise up a new one for the joshua to take him over the law failed moses went with it moses faces have failed but the spirit of god joshua the word joshua means jesus our savior that the holy spirit will come into the church not an organization but the holy spirit will get among the people and make her ready to go up well holy cross jordan i understand by the reading of the book that's what's to take place and god knows that's what i'm seeking now that i might comfort his people and tell him what's at hand both here this morning and out through the lands of these tapes will go worldwide that we're at the end time he revealed all the way until the kingdom was completely restored and the millennium set in that was gabriel's message he said i've come to tell you that there is 70 of years 70 of weeks yet determine upon thy people determined to the end of the jewish generation there's 70 of which i watch what he said that now from the going forth to restore 78 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy city thy seed bath and business now when we get to the the seven of the six fold confirmation we'll find what that city is bring it down and prove who it was who founded it where it come from how long will it stand will it be rebuilt again and what time [Music] all great things are in store for all right 78 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy city to finish the transgression i never said daniel no doubt about what he told him that the 70 of weeks was i mean 70 years is about finished 68 is like two years and we find out that jeremiah's prophecy is just exactly right two years later they went out nehemiah went and got an order from the king and built the wall in trouble sometimes it worked he said the wall listen to this finish the transgression to make an end of sin to make an end of sin who to the jews determined upon thy people not upon the gentiles upon thy people the jews and thy city not new york not boston philadelphia chicago los angeles rome but upon thy city jerusalem and to finish the transgression make an end of sin make reconciliations for iniquity and to bring in the everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision in prophecy and to anoint the most holy watch know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to rebuild jerusalem which was his city unto messiah the prince shall be seven of the seventy we wait till we get into that oh my god that's the blessing of that going to get me a rope and tie myself to the glacier revealed it all the way down said i'm not only going to tell you now that them two years is just not it will be a feminist accomplished and we all know that they exactly stayed there 70 years and and went out just exactly what the prophet said and isaiah i mean daniel believed that prophet so here he was ready all right and he and now when gabriel come he said i've come to show you all the way to reveal to you these things that all the way to the consummation see look the abomination he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation confirmation is the end of all things amen i'm going to show you what will happen now listen get it i daniel i have been set your beloved in heaven and i heard your prayers and i have come down now to tell you what's determined for the jews and jerusalem from right now until the end of the consummation the whole thing now do you understand clay if we can find out what these 70 weeks are we know when the conservation is ambassador amen oh my god help us to know praise the lord it tells us exactly somewhere in these pages exactly from that time till this time until the consummation and it won't miss it one minute [Music] how god's great word when god made the earth and said it in orbit i was preaching the other night sunday night how that there's nothing fails while this world turns so perfect till they can tell you exactly when the sun and moon will pass in 20 years a day to the exact minute i can't tell you but any time peace we got in the world it'll lose two or three minutes a month or a game to remain the best we got we can't make nothing that perfect because there's only one thing perfect amen that's god [Music] and god in his word is the same so god's word is perfect if we can find these days we'll find exactly when the consummation will be you get it it's determined through the consummation the 24th verse thy people and the holy city which is jerusalem got 21st 24th verse sure jesus referred to this in matthew 24. now brother collins if he's sure this morning i don't know whether he is or not and the do not you ask the question i guess it's all right for me to say brother colin about the abomination and make of desolation see what it meant jesus spoke of it in matthew 24 chapter and we find out yeah matthew 24 15 now let me just get that right quick so you can see what jesus speaking of the same thing here referring back to daniel matthew 24 15 to you that's taken out i want you each one now especially tonight and next sunday bring them pencils and papers because we're unless you've got a tape 24 and the 15th verse and when therefore and when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet i think this is 480 345 86 years beforehand 486 years beforehand daniel the prophet standing in the holy place now look in your bible it's in princes whoso readeth let him understand now he's talking to the jews they want to know what about this temple when will it be destroyed when will it be rebuilt when will there come a time it won't be one stone upon another how long will it last he said when you see the abomination that make a desolation standing when daniel stood in the holy place that when you see this come to pass now let him read understand what he's talking about that's the reason we're praying to god to make that so perfect that there'll be not one shattered out because we're not supposed to put our own interpretation to those things it's got to come to thus saith the lord amen so i'm leaving it right there until i understand revealed all things to him that abomination and remember it has a compound meaning just like call my son out of egypt as israel was called out so jesus's son called out that'll be just exactly take place as certain as i'm standing here and he did it in a way and he's made it all he had all hid from the church oh when we get down into that into those six-fold understandings how he's got all this he hit from the church so if the church be watching it every minute didn't know when he was coming but now the church age is about over so it's just ready now for the coming is getting ready this is the one most important scriptures in the book what does it do it tells the closing of the jewish nation the jewish people the scripture the 70th week it discloses and tells exactly from the time that daniel started there until the end of the consummation it's one of the greatest time pieces how many churnies say if you won't know what day of the week it is look at the calendar you want to know what time we're living in watch the jews right there's god's calendar taken from right here any theologian any bible scholar anyone will tell you that this is the timepiece hey about the jews now what time we got but just people hot oh boy it has nothing to do with the gentiles these seven sealed seven flags seven more seven trumpets have not one thing to do the gentile church will be in glory at that time don't have nothing to do with us the gentile church it only deals with israel daniel thy people and jerusalem now and discloses the facts that god deals only with the jews when they are in their homeland amen hallelujah that's where i think you hit the core right there they're always trying to allow from the time that israel was there at daniel's time and one great writer because i know some of his followers are sitting here i won't say it but that's the reason they had all this false stuff did you know how the miller knights before they came 70 adventists what they did up here in 19 and 19 got their wings you all sent the courier paper he got up here to fly away that morning that was taking daniel 70 a week miller knight then later on by miss ellen white which was their prophetess turned around and called themselves 70 adventists and now they change their name to the voice of prophecy three different names for the same cuff now but they were wrong because they were trying to apply those 70 weeks to both jew and gentile and he says here it's for thy people and god never did deal with the jew out of palestine and when the messiah the seventy in two weeks was cut off not for himself or us was cut off israel was scattered and has not never come back to their homeland unless the last few years so time wasn't counted in there from the church age you get it would be 19 and 19. i can show something happen to 19 and 19 well that's when that angel third angel's message struck and the war went for exactly but it wasn't that was when the war stopped in a mysterious way we get that in the seventh chapter when we get to it let me get to the seventh chapter you all heard me preach that many times i think when the angels best said hold the four winds of the earth shall we seal the jews the servant and now they kept waiting to all the gentile age that moved out then when they come in then then he seals the jews 144 000 receives the holy ghost there's 144 000 seal revelation 7 you've read it i saw a great number already in heaven john's on of all kinder tongues the nation and they stood before god with palms in their hands and white robes on saying hallelujah amen glory wisdom honor my power be to our god forever and ever amen couldn't understand them but he looked back and he saw mount sinai glory 144 000 that had not been defiled with women jews women churches they enjoy no organizations lutheran methodist baptist and presbyterian but they have been jews from the beginning orthodox and had their temple they're worshiping on mount sinai that's 144 000. that's after this the church is done in glory [Music] so mr smith was wrong had to be because how you going to apply that down here in 1919 take 144 000 then you're back and wrestle light again then you're right back to the russellite doctrine that jesus come in 19 and 14 1919 he took his church and now he's a mystic body going around over the earth ray going to grandma's grave and grandpa's grave and raised them all up all those that were russell lights nonsense amen it don't make sense in the world it won't come out right amen no sir it doesn't amen but god's got the truth yeah god's the one who can reveal it and place it in there and show it exactly to him hallelujah and i believe he'll do it amen i don't know it i'm telling you the truth i do not know but i'm believing amen i'm believing that he will so you see god never did deal with the jews i want you to keep this in mind as long as israel that's what i try to tell this brother sitting over here let's talk about going to israel stay away from israel am i stay away from it all you people talk about converting the jews before this message is over you'll see it's thus saith the lord by word and by spirit amen israel be converted over the whole nation in one night the bible said so but the gospel is not even to them there's a few renegades that's out and so forth like that they come in and outside the main body of jews that come and get saved that's true i believe that with all my my heart but remember as long as israel's out of their nation they cannot be saved now they are returning and they will be saved all the whole nation in one day amen the bible said so one day we'll bring completely all israel right back to god praise the lord there will be such a mighty thing strike israel one of these days until shake the whole nation hallelujah even the prophet cried out and said and one day has thou did this and one day they will see it there will be a mighty thing my opinion it'll be a mighty prophet that will rise and stand before israel [Music] you
