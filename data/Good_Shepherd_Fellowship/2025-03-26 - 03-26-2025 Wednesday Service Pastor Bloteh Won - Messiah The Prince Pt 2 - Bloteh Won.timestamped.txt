[29:48] your seat now uh uh I was I was a little
[29:51] bit I was a little bit distracted in
[29:54] touch here because as I was reading my
[29:57] mind was trying to pick up something in
[30:00] the midst of the
[30:01] reading and uh
[30:10] uh and what it was was
[30:14] uh uh from the going forth of the
[30:17] Commandment to restor and to build
[30:20] Jerusalem on to maiah the prince now we
[30:24] talking about maiah the prince that's
[30:26] how we our was subject is uh that's how
[30:30] we titled this maiah the prince but
[30:34] uh uh I was looking at this and and uh I
[30:39] wish that my thought ran in this
[30:41] direction I was going to I was going to
[30:44] take you down that that that route a
[30:46] little bit here but can you
[30:49] imagine uh how in in
[30:53] God uh Sovereign ways of bringing forth
[30:57] his word
[30:59] word
[31:02] uh Isaiah the prophet many
[31:06] years will
[31:08] prophesied uh you have to you have to
[31:11] know now in the timeline
[31:14] asaiah uh prophesied during the time of
[31:18] uh uh yuah the king so uh uh
[31:24] uh that was before they even went into
[31:28] Babylon are we together that was before
[31:31] they went into Babylon but during Isaiah
[31:36] prophecy he prophesied strangely about
[31:41] uh uh a king
[31:42] sarus that was going to come and and in
[31:46] his prophecy he called this Gentile King
[31:51] a servant of the
[31:53] Lord and then many years after while
[31:57] they went into Babylon around around
[32:00] this
[32:00] time uh uh when when the mees and the
[32:04] Persian were going to take over the city
[32:08] and then uh uh uh darus the king and
[32:12] then later on cus came into
[32:15] Power uh Daniel took the word of
[32:20] Isaiah
[32:22] the the prophet and went and show it to
[32:25] sarus
[32:29] and when he show it to
[32:31] sarus it convicted
[32:33] him that y said in the sacred in the
[32:37] Sacred Book of these people my name is
[32:42] written okay Daniel show it to him and
[32:45] read it to him and it convicted him and
[32:50] uh and he was the one that was able to
[32:53] order the rebuilding of
[32:56] Jerusalem so you see that's where I was
[32:59] I was a little bit distracted here uh
[33:01] from the glory for of the Commandment
[33:04] the glory for of the Commandment came
[33:06] from cus the
[33:08] king he was the one that gave the
[33:10] Commandment for the city to be
[33:15] rebuilt are we together amen so you
[33:19] think about it now before he was even
[33:22] born hundreds of of years before he was
[33:26] born
[33:28] a prophet came on the scene and and and
[33:32] and and and give a th said the Lord that
[33:36] there was going to be a king and he will
[33:38] be uh uh uh God will use him and his
[33:42] name would be called sarus and here said
[33:45] he is born when he was shown his name in
[33:49] the word it gave him a conviction to
[33:52] carry out exactly what God wanted him to
[33:55] do now why am I saying this uh uh to you

[34:02] thing that is happening in our

[34:34] Daughters of God in this
[34:36] day are we together amen so what what am

[36:00] Daniel tonight let me show you uh uh uh
[36:04] I have a
[36:06] little a little how can I call it now uh
[36:09] drama that's that will be Daniel chapter
[36:12] 10 we will read from uh verse 7 Daniel
[36:16] chapter 10 let's read from verse
[36:22] 7 Daniel chapter 10 let's read from
[36:25] verse 7 and I Daniel alone saw the
[36:33] vision for the men that were with me saw
[36:36] not the vision was it not the same thing
[36:39] that happened to Paul on the road of
[36:42] Damascus he saw the light but the man
[36:45] that were with him never saw the light
[36:48] and God can show you something in the
[36:49] word and those that are around you
[36:51] cannot see it amen are we together he
[36:56] says I saw the vision for the men that
[37:00] were that were with me saw not the
[37:02] vision but with great quickening fell
[37:06] upon them so that they fled to to to
[37:10] hide himself amen there was some some h
[37:15] h h sort of
[37:17] shaking and they were afraid they knew
[37:19] something happened they never saw what
[37:22] what uh what was happening they knew
[37:24] something happened because there was a
[37:26] kind of for shaken and they were all
[37:29] trouble
[37:31] amen
[37:32] therefore I was left
[37:35] alone and saw this
[37:38] vision and
[37:40] there remain no strength in me praise
[37:45] the Lord One Vision yeah amen One Vision
[37:52] took all the strength out of him right
[37:55] are we together amen
[37:58] praise the Lord

[38:44] strength and it also disfigure
[38:47] him it took his
[38:51] cess it makes it makes seem that's
[38:54] that's the reason why the the Jews could
[38:57] say said to Jesus you are not yet 5050
[39:00] you say you saw Abraham right he was
[39:02] just 30
[39:04] right his ministra of seeing Vision

[42:56] Daniel
[42:57] uh for from the first day that thou did
[43:01] set thy face to understand and to chasen
[43:04] thyself before God but this is what I
[43:07] want to bring out of
[43:09] this the vision affected him so much
[43:12] that there was no strength in his body
[43:15] he went flat on the ground just like
[43:19] when God was making man in the beginning
[43:22] and you know and molding the body of man
[43:25] you know he was he was on the ground
[43:27] ground Daniel was on the ground like
[43:29] like the man that God made in Genesis
[43:32] chapter 2 form from the from the dust of
[43:35] the Earth are we together amen and he
[43:38] says the Lord lay his hands on my
[43:40] shoulder lay his hands on me and then he
[43:43] gathered a little strength to come from
[43:46] his belly on the ground to his knees and
[43:48] his palm on his head but that's not
[43:51] where God wanted him to
[43:53] be amen God wanted him to be upright
[43:57] right but what is going to bring him

[46:40] and started prophesying the bones
[46:42] started looking for their right
[46:44] identification this bone started running
[46:46] to join to this arm and this hand what
[46:49] caused that is the speaking of the word

[55:52] spirit every Community has a spirit
[55:56] every h h h h home has a spirit every

[56:06] spirit sometimes it's the thing that W
[56:08] against
[56:10] us it's the thing that is stopping us
[56:13] from reaching our potential of being the
[56:15] Son of God our potential from being the
[56:18] daughter of
[56:19] God yeah and instead of paying attention
[56:22] to that we get caught up in all the
[56:25] fusses look at the way she look at me
[56:27] see the things she said about me look at
[56:29] what they are doing about those are all
[56:31] distraction Amen to get you away from
[56:34] your potential
[56:36] am and then you get caught up in the
[56:39] gossip and you get caught up in the lies
[56:41] you get caught up in the politics you
[56:43] get caught up in what is saying on the
[56:48] news what you supposed to be paying
[56:50] attention to
[56:51] amen you're not paying attention to it
[56:59] are we
[57:04] together so we see two Prince here and
[57:08] that's the word we were trying to play
[57:10] with we were playing with
[57:12] words maiah the
[57:14] prince in the
[57:16] Hebrew M maiah migal which mean mesiah
[57:21] the
[57:22] power in the Greek is mesiah the Christ
[57:26] which mean Messiah the anointed one is
[57:29] the
[57:32] same so what are they looking at is that
[57:35] there is a
[57:38] power the weapons of our Warfare are not
[57:42] kind and that's why Paul taught about us
[57:44] that's why he taught us in Hebrew I mean
[57:46] Ephesians chapter 6 he said we are not
[57:49] Waring against flesh and
[57:51] blood but against principalities
[57:54] spiritual wickedness in high place
[57:56] places in high places with no good
[57:59] intention for
[58:01] you praise the Lord no good
[58:04] intention you think you only just want
[58:06] to bore your ears no you want to bore

[58:51] with the with the Prince of Persia the
[58:54] the prince of Greece is coming that that
[58:56] is the next Kingdom to come after so
[58:59] which mean before they deal with the
[59:01] Prince of Persia they had to deal with
[59:03] the prince of
[59:05] Babylon because it was the Babylonian
[59:08] Kingdom before the Persia
[59:10] Kingdom every Kingdom has a
[59:13] spirit every government has a
[59:18] spirit that's the reason why when the

[1:06:47] comes by reading or hearing the word
[1:06:49] amen amen praise the lord we read Psalm
[1:06:53] 18 uh 38
[1:06:56] verse two I worship towards thy Holy
[1:06:59] Temple and praise thy name for thy

[1:23:18] Lord are we together so it's it's so
[1:23:21] kind of for bring it into into context
[1:23:24] here because what what are we seeing
[1:23:27] what what is what is our Prince what is
[1:23:30] your prince the word the anointed word
[1:23:34] for your day right this word for your
[1:23:37] day is given to address the situation
[1:23:40] for your day there is no situation in
[1:23:43] our life that this world cannot address
[1:23:45] no situation in our home that this word
[1:23:48] cannot address no situation in our
[1:23:51] church that this word cannot address
[1:23:54] amen amen the anointed word for the hour
[1:23:58] meets the need of the hour it meets the
[1:24:01] condition of the day that's right that's
[1:24:04] the reason why the word corrects the
[1:24:06] error right
[1:24:12] amen are we together
[1:24:17] amen so to bring to bring the subject
[1:24:21] into into context so you will understand
[1:24:24] it here is Gabriel saying Gabriel is
[1:24:28] saying to Daniel the Prince of
[1:24:31] Persia
[1:24:34] Handley okay the Prince of Persia
[1:24:38] heny for 21 days he says but I had to go
[1:24:44] and and and and and and Michael the
[1:24:47] Chief prce
[1:24:49] came to help me are we together
[1:24:55] amen now so what we want to understand
[1:25:00] yeah we or we want to bring into context
[1:25:03] is that you have to remember that what
[1:25:06] Dan there the 70 weeks of Dan there is
[1:25:10] all about the Redemption plan of
[1:25:14] Ezra
[1:25:15] amen the Redemption plan of isra and
[1:25:18] then when you look into the Redemption
[1:25:20] plan you realize it is God's thoughts
[1:25:23] concerning in his people from the
[1:25:25] foundation of the word is the word of
[1:25:29] God praise the Lord are we
[1:25:33] together
[1:25:36] amen
[1:25:38] angels
[1:25:40] angels are sent to guide us angels are
[1:25:43] there to uh h h h protect us uh uh that
[1:25:49] they fight on our behalf but you see
[1:25:52] there is a there is another Authority
[1:25:55] that authority of the word the full
[1:25:58] authority of the word is not given to
[1:26:01] Angels now look at this now you will see
[1:26:04] right there in Babylon the three Hebrew
[1:26:07] boys that says uh even if King you will
[1:26:10] not you will not uh let us go we will
[1:26:13] not bow down to worship our God is more
[1:26:16] than able to deliver us are we together
[1:26:20] amen our God is more than able to
[1:26:23] deliver us
[1:26:24] what was they provoking they were
[1:26:27] provoking a promise of
[1:26:30] God are we together amen they were
[1:26:34] provoking a promise of God and and and
[1:26:37] when they were placed into the fire like
[1:26:40] brother Brandon would will will will
[1:26:42] will will H H dramatize it for us he
[1:26:46] says and and and and one who will says
[1:26:48] let me go down there and pour water and
[1:26:51] cut that fire he says no this is not
[1:26:53] this is not water B amen amen praise the
[1:26:56] Lord you have to realize that uh uh uh
[1:27:01] uh
[1:27:03] uh
[1:27:06] uh shedra Mish and abeno Daniel and his
[1:27:11] boys they were standing for Jehovah in
[1:27:14] an ulous Kingdom they were standing for
[1:27:18] h h h they were they were lifting the
[1:27:20] name of God up that we will not bow down
[1:27:23] to nothing we have one God amen amen
[1:27:26] praise the Lord amen hallelujah so what
[1:27:30] were they defending they were defending
[1:27:32] the name of God they were defending this
[1:27:36] almost like what David said when David
[1:27:39] stepped into the battle what he
[1:27:42] says I will not allow this uncircumcised
[1:27:46] Philistine Amen to do what defy the army
[1:27:52] of the Living God he never said the army
[1:27:54] of
[1:27:56] isra why because the name of God was
[1:28:01] attached praise the Lord so it was the
[1:28:04] name of God and Dan and shedra Mish and
[1:28:08] those boys were standing for the
[1:28:10] name of God so God is not going to send
[1:28:13] an angel right amen he have to come down
[1:28:17] and defend his own name right amen amen
[1:28:21] are we together he has to come there now
[1:28:24] so that's what I want you to understand
[1:28:26] yeah Daniel was in a battle what Daniel
[1:28:30] wanted to understand was something that
[1:28:33] had to do with the revealing of the
[1:28:36] word it it was something that had to do
[1:28:39] with the
[1:28:41] word it was just not enough mission for
[1:28:44] an angel he needed something more than
[1:28:47] an
[1:28:49] Angel that's why Michael the prince
[1:28:52] comes on the scene because it's Christ
[1:28:55] in an Angelic form right in the Old
[1:28:58] Testament it's called the angel of the
[1:29:00] Lord that's
[1:29:02] right glory to God amen amen the angel
[1:29:05] of the
[1:29:07] Lord is that anointing that has to do
[1:29:11] with the word not just just an Angelic
[1:29:16] anointing but an an anointing that has
[1:29:19] to do with the word
[1:29:24] praise the Lord am
[1:29:27] amen that's why when it has to do with
[1:29:30] the Lord the word I am the Lord that
[1:29:32] Health all your
[1:29:34] diseases amen praise the Lord the angel
[1:29:37] that comes on the scene to do
[1:29:40] that is
[1:29:44] Christ because he's the
[1:29:47] word now people stumble over there but
[1:29:50] it should be very easy for us amen amen
[1:29:54] am do we believe that God made Angel
[1:29:56] right amen if he may angel can he now
[1:30:00] become an
[1:30:01] angel praise the Lord do we believe that
[1:30:04] God made man if God made man is it
[1:30:07] difficult for him to be a
[1:30:10] man praise the Lord come on now
[1:30:14] hallelujah amen what what theologians
[1:30:17] want to confuse us why don't want to
[1:30:19] make the thing so difficult yeah to to
[1:30:22] give us God the Father God is God the
[1:30:24] Holy
[1:30:25] Ghost those are just theological terms
[1:30:28] it's the same God manifesting
[1:30:32] himself because that's that's who he
[1:30:35] is praise the Lord that's who he
[1:30:41] is he took on the name of a a lion of
[1:30:45] the Trap of Judah because he made
[1:30:47] lion he took on the name of the treat of
[1:30:50] life because I mean that he he made
[1:30:52] treat so he can be a living treat
[1:30:59] so what I'm trying to show you here is
[1:31:02] that the one that is fighting our battle
[1:31:05] that's the reason why when Joshua met
[1:31:08] that angel and took his SW and says are
[1:31:11] you for us or are you against
[1:31:14] us praise the Lord
[1:31:16] amen what did he
[1:31:19] say I'm the
[1:31:22] angel of the Lord Lord host that's
[1:31:27] right
[1:31:29] amen he was identifying a position of
[1:31:36] authority praise the Lord and what were
[1:31:40] they fighting for they were fighting for
[1:31:42] their promise
[1:31:45] amen their promise was the word amen so
[1:31:49] every time that you are fighting for the
[1:31:51] promise in the word you are protected by
[1:31:54] Angel but to bring that word to pass
[1:31:57] Christ have to come on the scene Christ
[1:32:00] in you the hope of
[1:32:07] glory he has to come on the scene he has
[1:32:11] to embody you to overcome Temptation
[1:32:15] embody you to overcome lust inother you
[1:32:18] to overcome lying he has to embo you
[1:32:22] amen praise the Lord am it's no longer I
[1:32:26] that live but Christ that liveth in
[1:32:31] me are we together
[1:32:34] am I'm not talking about just being uh H
[1:32:38] H uh you know just being uh how you can
[1:32:42] call it uh
[1:32:45] uh I mean just running around with Zeal
[1:32:48] just being zilus no I'm talking about
[1:32:52] the word
[1:32:54] taking over the being of the
[1:32:57] believer praise the Lord
[1:33:06] amen Paul says something in Hebrew let's
[1:33:09] read that Hebrews chapter 4 then we
[1:33:11] close on there tonight sorry I've gone a
[1:33:13] little bit over 9:00 tonight I should

[1:33:19] was what we
[1:33:22] read praise the
[1:33:28] Lord Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 for the
[1:33:32] word of God is quck and
[1:33:35] Powerful the word of God is quck and

[1:33:52] marrow and it's a DE CER of the thoughts
[1:33:54] and the intense of the heart listen to
[1:33:56] this now this is where I want to go

[1:34:02] that is not manifest in his sight but
[1:34:06] all things are naked and open unto the
[1:34:11] eyes of him with whom we have to do
[1:34:18] praise the Lord amen with whom we have
[1:34:21] to do a sense of the one that we are
[1:34:24] dealing with everything is naked in his
[1:34:27] eyes the one we are dealing with is the
[1:34:31] word that is sharper than two edges SW

[1:34:36] one that descend the intents of the
[1:34:39] heart the one that we are dealing with
[1:34:43] you're not dealing with me I'm not
