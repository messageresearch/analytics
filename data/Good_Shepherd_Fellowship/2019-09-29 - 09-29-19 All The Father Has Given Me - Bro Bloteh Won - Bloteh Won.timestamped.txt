[13:45] just to keep us away from him Saints
[13:49] there's something in a man and a woman
[13:53] this brother branham said that there's
[13:55] some place in your heart that only God
[13:57] can fill and hold my seats how many

[14:11] had to learn sometimes the hard way amen
[14:15] if we could just get into his presence
[14:18] this morning we'll be satisfied I always
[14:23] like to think about how that they took
[14:25] one stick from each tribe and they put
[14:30] it into the holiest of Holies aim and it
[14:34] said Aaron's rod not only did it come to
[14:38] life it butted and brought forth almonds
[14:43] and if you know what if that rod was not
[14:47] in his presence it'd just be a dry old
[14:49] stick and you know that's the way we are
[14:52] if we're not dwelling in his presence
[14:54] were nothing but a dry old stick so how
[14:58] many just want to be in his presence
[14:59] this morning and let God may he bud and
[15:04] bring forth his fruit in these vessels

[47:11] amen praise the Lord you know while I
[47:17] was I was studying in the week I was
[47:20] listening to something reading a
[47:23] brilliant book actually and and he said
[47:27] that you know when you are flying on an
[47:35] aeroplane
[47:41] and as as how you go as high when the
[47:47] plane takes off and the planes that are
[47:52] going up the moment you get above
[47:59] altitude the things of the earth starts
[48:03] to lose shape and then when you start
[48:08] seeing things and can be able to
[48:11] identify them then you are losing
[48:13] attitude which means you are coming
[48:15] closer to the earth praise the Lord
[48:20] but as far as you are going from the
[48:23] earth the mole thing starts to lose
[48:26] shape just wondering what is down there
[48:29] you know just just looking in and it
[48:32] gets smaller and it gets smaller and
[48:34] then they disappear praise the Lord and
[48:38] and I believe that is it with the life
[48:41] of a child of God you know having
[48:46] something this morning for the young
[48:47] people I remember it many years ago was
[48:50] just a faded we can put my little my
[48:52] little quiz up some years back you know
[49:00] we had to be school because of the wall
[49:04] in different things so when I moved to
[49:07] the area cause I've already gone into
[49:10] the ministry and but I decided to go
[49:13] back to school so I had to take an
[49:15] entrance
[49:15] I remember this question and I prayed I
[49:19] never forget about it here I tear a leaf
[49:23] and how to take this math test and he
[49:28] had this question that is about angles
[49:31] our brother Jody he was asking about
[49:38] okay this is the question two angles
[49:41] that make a straight angle being out of
[49:46] school for a wide in Assad right there
[49:48] you know I pray before I went to take my
[49:50] test now I just sitting there now
[49:54] looking at the question two angles that
[49:58] make a straight angle just looking at
[50:03] the question I did not know the answer
[50:05] so I started thinking I said well I
[50:09] don't think it will be the first I don't
[50:12] I don't guess it would be the second but
[50:15] my mind was between supplementary angle
[50:19] and complementary angle and then I
[50:26] laughs I said to myself I said well
[50:31] Amanda has a a complicated life can
[50:36] never be straight
[50:41] but a man and I live a life of
[50:43] supplication can be straight so I cycle
[50:52] supplement supplementary and eternal
[50:55] that I pass and I pass the entrance I
[51:06] surprised myself oh praise the Lord and
[51:20] you know and on and on you know there's
[51:27] a way that that God these with us each
[51:31] and every one of us there are things
[51:34] that will speak to you they might never
[51:36] speak to me I might never speak to
[51:39] anybody you know people get out they
[51:43] look on nature and it just started crap
[51:44] it starts to cry remember yesterday we
[51:47] were talking with the brother Darren we
[51:50] went for breakfast and we were just
[51:52] talking something I can't remember the
[51:54] train of thought and I just said
[51:56] something you know I was just saying
[51:58] something or finding courage I mean I
[52:00] was just saying something like I will
[52:02] always do and I mean it just you know
[52:05] bruster out into a crying service and
[52:10] and and it's because of the way that God
[52:14] designed us in the message I've heard
[52:17] but now I see verbatim talks about a
[52:20] channel of communication every man that
[52:24] God made there's a way that God bill to
[52:28] communicate to you there's a channel of
[52:32] communication
[52:35] praise the Lord and and sometimes you
[52:43] know and that is the way it is with
[52:45] every one of us so you know sometimes I
[52:50] will see some things and I appreciate
[52:53] one of the brothers you know you coming
[52:55] up a little bit on what we were talking
[52:58] on Wednesday night
[52:59] I think I kind of misuse the word but it
[53:04] was because of what was on my mind
[53:06] that's a bird Brandon preached a message
[53:08] called statue of a peppermint it's
[53:10] actually stature of a person named but
[53:14] you know in the statute of a perfect man
[53:17] and I talked about this this morning
[53:19] looking and the book of Sam Sam chapter
[53:23] 19 David thought about were the statue
[53:27] of the Lord is right and you know when I
[53:31] when I read that to me a mind
[53:35] smokin re brain for me to better
[53:38] understand their I say the statute of
[53:40] the Lord is upright
[53:47] because when when Moses talked about the
[53:50] statues in the statues and the
[53:53] ordinances in in in Old Testament in the
[53:59] book of Exodus Leviticus he was talking
[54:01] about the statute of the Lord in all of
[54:03] the head
[54:03] Moses was talking about pretty much what
[54:09] brother Branham was talking about
[54:11] because the statue that was given to
[54:14] Israel was not really a monument because
[54:19] God has already told him not to build a
[54:22] graven image after no kind Deuteronomy
[54:26] chapter 4 go to Israel you know I never
[54:29] come to you in a form of a bird or in a
[54:32] form of a beast when I came to you it
[54:35] was my word that's God's greater form
[54:39] that he can come to everybody that's his
[54:41] word amen so the statue that was given
[54:46] to Israel was the Word of God but yet
[54:50] their word was given to Israel because
[54:54] God was going to bail he starts you in
[54:57] his people that's the reason why man
[55:02] India fitted India physical
[55:05] representation they will bail a statue
[55:08] of Abraham Lincoln or a statue of George
[55:11] Washington you know just like I was
[55:13] saying and put it in a garden but when
[55:16] God is building his statue he's building
[55:20] it in a living being amen
[55:26] it starts by faith in virtue and
[55:32] knowledge and temperance to bring us to
[55:37] bring us to the starts you of Epiphany
[55:43] now when you look over in the book of
[55:45] Genesis we will now say that Adam you
[55:49] know God built a statue of a perfect man
[55:52] in Eden but God give us a statue of a
[55:56] perfect man
[55:57] because there was a perfect man God and
[56:02] Adam was made in His image
[56:06] praise the Lord so one time I was also
[56:12] doing something like that and I don't
[56:15] know I you just have to pray for me like
[56:18] a - a brother yesterday I say it takes
[56:21] two people to make a good pastor amen
[56:27] it takes you to make a good pastor if
[56:31] you ever have a good pastor it would
[56:32] take it would take your ability to bear
[56:34] with me praise the Lord
[56:39] amen and one of the brothers in one of
[56:43] the meetings we were I guess maybe he
[56:45] was sleeping in you know and and the
[56:48] preacher said something in everybody you
[56:51] know was shouting and rejoice and his
[56:52] jam out of his sleeping you know and his
[56:55] wife accent What did he say
[56:56] say well I know he said something good
[56:58] because everybody's shouting
[57:06] praise the Lord
[57:08] yeah but I appreciate each and every one
[57:12] of you it's good to be in the house of
[57:16] the Lord and I see our sisters there
[57:20] from campus good to see you people
[57:21] sister Sarah praise the Lord and it's
[57:26] good to see you people praise the Lord
[57:30] Alleluia amen
[57:33] but Joseph want us to pray for him it's
[57:36] having a kind of fat infection in his
[57:39] hands and it's causing pain for him so
[57:42] we will remember him this morning and
[57:48] let's just stand to our feet a little
[57:50] bit so we can read the wording and hope
[57:54] not to keep you long this morning praise
[57:58] the Lord Amen and like I said thank you
[58:03] for bearing with me some time I say one
[58:05] thing and I'm going man waiting saying
[58:08] another thing another thing I wanted to
[58:10] say before we we just pray here is that
[58:16] uh I think last service was was it was a
[58:22] tremendous service this is what happened
[58:27] sometimes people instead Jesus said a
[58:33] Good Shepherd we leave the ninety-nine
[58:37] and he would go after one but here is
[58:42] the thing with the Sheep most of the
[58:46] time we don't want to be the 99
[58:51] we want to be the one amen praise the
[58:56] Lord
[58:57] so if the Shepherd leave the ninety-nine
[58:59] I'm going after the one as long as you
[59:03] are not that one then you feel like oh
[59:05] what is he going after the one and not
[59:07] going after me praise the Lord
[59:10] he's going after that one because the
[59:13] one is you know it's part of us praise
[59:17] the Lord
[59:17] when the one come back to this fall is
[59:20] completed so if the if you know if if
[59:24] the service you notice is is going after
[59:28] young people and maybe you know you have
[59:31] grown in grace and you think the message
[59:33] is too little for you just be the 99
[59:36] wait letter won't come back
[59:41] praise the Lord just be the night
[59:44] tonight and I think that was what
[59:46] happened in Sunday yesterday
[59:47] I mean last Sunday I mean it was a
[59:54] service I was going after one maybe I
[59:57] was that one maybe you was that one but
[1:00:02] what I would say also is the other you
[1:00:05] know we all have a story we all have the
[1:00:12] dealing of the Lord
[1:00:13] some people might choose not to speak
[1:00:17] about it some people story we only hear
[1:00:19] about it when we get on the other side
[1:00:22] amen but if God laid on the heart of a
[1:00:27] young man or a young woman to come and
[1:00:29] share with us what the grace of God has
[1:00:32] been doing in their life and we expect
[1:00:35] you and myself to stay there and
[1:00:36] appreciate what God has brought that
[1:00:39] person true
[1:00:58] but just is that my Jesus I love thee

[1:05:13] this morning and then find a lot of time
[1:05:18] to preach but I want us to read through
[1:05:22] the chapter that's in John chapter 6
[1:05:24] this for me
[1:05:25] for Jordan you ready you go right ahead
[1:05:28] chapter 6 after these things Jesus went
[1:05:32] over the Sea of Galilee which is the sea
[1:05:34] of Tiberias and a great multitude
[1:05:37] followed him because they saw his
[1:05:38] miracles which he did on them that were
[1:05:40] diseased and Jesus went up into a
[1:05:42] mountain and there he sat with his
[1:05:44] disciples and the Passover a feast of
[1:05:47] the Jews was nigh when Jesus then lifted
[1:05:51] up his eyes and saw a great company come
[1:05:53] unto Him he saith unto Philip when shall
[1:05:56] we buy bread but these may eat and this
[1:05:58] he said to prove him for he himself knew
[1:06:01] what he would do
[1:06:03] Philip answered him two hundred
[1:06:05] pennyworth of bread is not sufficient
[1:06:07] for them and every one of them may take
[1:06:09] a little one of his disciples Andrew
[1:06:11] simon Peters brother saith unto Him
[1:06:14] there is a lad here which had five
[1:06:16] barley loaves and two small fishes but
[1:06:19] what are they among so many and jesus
[1:06:21] said take the men and sit down now there
[1:06:24] was much grass in the place so the men
[1:06:26] sat down in number about five thousand
[1:06:29] and Jesus took the loaves and when he
[1:06:31] had given thanks he distributed to the
[1:06:33] disciples and the disciples to them that
[1:06:36] were set down and likewise of the fishes
[1:06:38] as much as they would when they were
[1:06:41] filled he said unto his disciples gather
[1:06:43] up the fragments that remain that
[1:06:45] nothing be lost
[1:06:46] therefore they gathered them together
[1:06:48] and filled twelve baskets with the
[1:06:49] fragments of the five barley loaves
[1:06:51] which remained over and above unto them
[1:06:53] that had eaten then those men when they
[1:06:57] had seen the miracle that Jesus did said
[1:06:59] this is of a truth that profit that
[1:07:02] should come into the world when Jesus
[1:07:04] therefore perceived that they would come
[1:07:06] and take him by force to make him a king
[1:07:08] he departed again into a mountain
[1:07:10] himself alone and when even was now come
[1:07:15] his disciples went down unto the sea and
[1:07:17] entered into a ship and went over the
[1:07:20] sea toward Capernaum and it was now dark
[1:07:23] and Jesus was not come to them and the
[1:07:27] sea arose by reason of a great wind to
[1:07:29] the flew
[1:07:30] so when they had wrote about five and
[1:07:32] twenty or thirty furlongs they see Jesus
[1:07:34] walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto
[1:07:36] the ship and they were afraid but he
[1:07:39] saith unto them it is I be not afraid
[1:07:41] then they willingly received him into
[1:07:44] the ship and immediately the ship was at
[1:07:46] the land whither they went the day
[1:07:49] following when the people which stood on
[1:07:51] the other side of the sea saw that there
[1:07:53] was none other boat their saved that one
[1:07:55] wherein to his disciples were entered
[1:07:57] and that Jesus went not with his
[1:07:59] disciples into the boat but that his
[1:08:01] disciples were gone away alone howbeit
[1:08:03] there came other boats from Tiberias
[1:08:05] nigh unto the place where they didn't
[1:08:07] eat bread after that the Lord had given
[1:08:09] thanks when the people therefore saw
[1:08:12] that Jesus was not there neither his
[1:08:14] disciples they also took shipping and
[1:08:17] came to Capernaum seeking for Jesus and
[1:08:19] when they had found him on the other
[1:08:21] side of the sea they said unto him rabbi
[1:08:24] when camest thou hither jesus answered
[1:08:26] them and said verily verily I say unto
[1:08:29] you ye seek me not because he saw the
[1:08:33] miracles but because he did eat of the
[1:08:35] loaves and were filled labor not for the
[1:08:38] meat which perisheth but for that meat
[1:08:40] which endureth unto everlasting life
[1:08:42] which the Son of man shall give unto you
[1:08:45] for him hath God the Father sealed then
[1:08:48] said they unto Him what shall we do that
[1:08:52] we might work the works of God jesus
[1:08:54] answered and said unto them this is the
[1:08:56] work of God that ye believe on Him whom
[1:08:59] he had sent they said therefore unto Him
[1:09:02] what sign show us now them that we may
[1:09:04] see and believe thee
[1:09:06] what does thou work our fathers did eat
[1:09:09] manna in the desert as it is written he
[1:09:12] gave them bread from heaven 3 then jesus
[1:09:15] said unto them verily verily I say unto
[1:09:18] you Moses gave you not that bread from
[1:09:21] heaven but my father giveth you the true
[1:09:23] bread from heaven for the bread of God
[1:09:26] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[1:09:28] giveth life unto the world then said
[1:09:31] they unto Him Lord evermore give us this
[1:09:34] bread and Jesus said unto them I am the
[1:09:37] bread of life he that cometh to me shall
[1:09:40] never hunger
[1:09:41] and he that believeth on me shall never
[1:09:44] thirst but I said unto you that ye also
[1:09:47] have seen me and believe not all that
[1:09:51] the father giveth me shall come to me
[1:09:52] and him that cometh to me I will in no
[1:09:55] wise cast out where I came down from
[1:09:58] heaven not to do my own will but the
[1:10:00] will of him that sent me and this is the
[1:10:03] Father's will which hath sent me that of
[1:10:05] all which he hath given me I should lose
[1:10:07] nothing but should raise it up again at
[1:10:09] the last day and this is the will of him
[1:10:12] that sent me that everyone would see at
[1:10:14] the Son and believeth on him may have
[1:10:17] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[1:10:20] at the last day the Jews then murmured
[1:10:22] at him because he said I am the bread
[1:10:24] which came down from heaven and they
[1:10:26] said is not this Jesus the Son of Joseph
[1:10:28] whose father and mother we know how is
[1:10:31] it then that he saith I came down from
[1:10:33] heaven Jesus therefore answered and said
[1:10:36] unto them murmur not among yourselves no
[1:10:39] man can come to me except the Father
[1:10:41] which hath sent me draw him and I will
[1:10:44] raise him up at the last day it is
[1:10:47] written in the prophets and they shall
[1:10:49] be all taught of God every man therefore
[1:10:52] that hath heard and had learned of the
[1:10:54] Father cometh unto me not that any man
[1:10:57] hath seen the father save he which is of
[1:10:59] God he hath seen the father
[1:11:01] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:11:05] believeth on me hath everlasting life I
[1:11:07] am that Bread of Life your father's did
[1:11:11] eat manna in the wilderness and are dead
[1:11:13] this is the bread which cometh down from
[1:11:15] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[1:11:18] not die I am The Living bread which came
[1:11:21] down from heaven If any man eat of this
[1:11:24] bread he shall live forever and the
[1:11:26] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[1:11:29] I will give for the life of the world
[1:11:31] the Jews therefore strove among
[1:11:33] themselves saying how can this man give
[1:11:35] us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto
[1:11:38] them verily verily I say unto you except
[1:11:42] ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
[1:11:44] drink his blood you have no life in you
[1:11:49] whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:11:51] blood hath eternal life and I will raise
[1:11:54] him up at the last day for my flesh is
[1:11:58] meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
[1:12:01] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:12:04] blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the
[1:12:08] living father had sent me and I live by
[1:12:11] the father so he that eateth me even he
[1:12:14] shall live by me this is that bread
[1:12:17] which came down from heaven not as your
[1:12:19] father's did eat manna and are dead he
[1:12:22] that eateth of this bread shall live for
[1:12:25] ever these things said he in the
[1:12:28] synagogue as he taught in Capernaum many
[1:12:31] therefore of his disciples when they had
[1:12:33] heard this said this is an hard thing
[1:12:35] who can hear it when Jesus knew and
[1:12:37] himself that his disciples murmured at
[1:12:39] it he said unto them doth this offend
[1:12:41] you
[1:12:42] why did if ye shall see the Son of Man
[1:12:45] ascend up where he was before it is the
[1:12:48] spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[1:12:50] profiteth nothing the words that I speak
[1:12:52] unto you they are spirit and they are
[1:12:55] life but there are some of you that
[1:12:58] believe not for jesus knew from the
[1:13:00] beginning who they were that believed
[1:13:02] not and who should betray him and he
[1:13:05] said therefore said i unto you that no
[1:13:08] man can come unto me except it were
[1:13:10] given unto him of my father from that
[1:13:12] time many of his disciples went back and
[1:13:14] walked no more with him then said Jesus
[1:13:18] unto the twelve will ye also go away
[1:13:20] then Simon Peter answered him Lord to
[1:13:23] whom shall we go thou hast the words of
[1:13:26] eternal life and we believe and are sure
[1:13:29] that thou art that Christ the Son of the
[1:13:33] Living God jesus answered them have I
[1:13:36] not chosen you twelve and one of you is
[1:13:39] a devil he spake of Judas Iscariot the
[1:13:42] son of Simon for he it was that should
[1:13:44] betray him being one of the twelve a me
[1:13:49] praise the Lord
[1:13:51] then we can pray and go home this
[1:13:53] morning amen would that be enough
[1:13:58] oh you want us to preach should we
[1:14:01] preach a little bit okay thank you for
[1:14:04] bearing with us Amy you look at verse 66
[1:14:10] verse 66 now realized that this is in
[1:14:13] John chapter 6 verse 60 system from that
[1:14:16] time many of the disciples went back and
[1:14:20] walked with him no more now you would
[1:14:22] just think you would think in your mind
[1:14:24] you know how how can this work how did
[1:14:27] it work out that these people that walk
[1:14:30] away from this truth and I mean and walk
[1:14:34] with him no more
[1:14:35] they were just recorded in the 6th
[1:14:39] chapter and the 66th verse praise the
[1:14:46] Lord
[1:14:48] sometimes I need to explain myself you
[1:14:51] see what I'm going with this is 6 6 6
[1:15:00] they seen the truth the truth is
[1:15:03] standing right there before them and
[1:15:06] they walk away from it and yes John will
[1:15:13] recall that in his sixth chapter the 66
[1:15:17] verse I never wrote the Bible
[1:15:23] it was long written before everyone of
[1:15:27] us
[1:15:28] Berta Branham never wrote the Bible amen
[1:15:32] but you see those are some other things
[1:15:35] you will read you know that that make us
[1:15:38] to believe that the Bible is the
[1:15:40] inspired Word of God
[1:15:42] praise the Lord I was really I was
[1:15:45] listening to a young man testimony in
[1:15:47] yesterday and and I thought about of the
[1:15:51] same scenario of you you know the young
[1:15:53] man I grew up and I mean he started
[1:15:56] following his grandmother at honor the
[1:16:01] Jehovah Witness teaching and then he
[1:16:03] came to the place after many years and
[1:16:05] started seeing some you know some some
[1:16:08] errors in the teaching and conflicting
[1:16:11] the errors of the organization and
[1:16:14] making it the errors of the Bible praise
[1:16:19] the Lord
[1:16:20] why because he believed his organization
[1:16:23] was carrying him to heaven so if the
[1:16:25] organization is not having a problem
[1:16:28] then the Bible has a problem praise the
[1:16:32] Lord and then he's saying here in his
[1:16:34] testimony I'll get to what I want to say
[1:16:36] this morning but he's saying testifying
[1:16:39] year that you know I you know I started
[1:16:43] I started struggling with some things in
[1:16:45] you know and then how he read there from
[1:16:48] Timothy and how the women must be in
[1:16:50] subjection you're a but you know we have
[1:16:53] seen some great intelligent women why
[1:16:55] you know and he start bringing all these
[1:16:57] political words of misogyny and sexism
[1:17:02] and all of the earth and and I was
[1:17:05] saying thinking I was sitting there and
[1:17:07] thinking to myself why don't people see
[1:17:09] the power that God put in subjection
[1:17:14] praise the Lord and that's what religion
[1:17:17] would do religion would take one person
[1:17:20] one of God's creation to beat on another
[1:17:23] creation of God praise the Lord but the
[1:17:27] saving knowledge of Jesus Christ would
[1:17:29] never do that I said to myself I said
[1:17:32] this young man that is talking he you
[1:17:34] know his wife had a baby for him I
[1:17:36] wonder why he never thought why didn't I
[1:17:38] get pregnant and my wife was not the one
[1:17:41] that carry the child amen
[1:17:47] because if he will see to the place well
[1:17:50] wonder when the scripture asks that the
[1:17:53] woman must be in subjection and she must
[1:17:55] learn if he will see that to be an evil
[1:18:00] thing and he sees me right now I'm now
[1:18:03] serving God I don't believe in God I
[1:18:05] don't believe nothing to dad now that's
[1:18:09] what an intellectual faith will do it
[1:18:13] can carry you just as far as you can go
[1:18:21] but when their faith have not dropped
[1:18:24] from your mental conception to your soul
[1:18:28] if we carry you as far as they can go
[1:18:31] and it will hang you
[1:18:33] just like a hang Judas praise the Lord
[1:18:44] in Genesis chapter 3 when God told the
[1:18:53] woman you bring life into the earth
[1:18:58] praise the Lord and the seed of the
[1:19:01] woman will bruise the head of the
[1:19:03] serpent God gave the woman he gave this
[1:19:15] woman the promise of redemption the
[1:19:20] issue of life was given to the woman
[1:19:24] praise the Lord we have to know that God
[1:19:28] he's the author of life amen
[1:19:33] he's the life giver he designed us amen
[1:19:40] but yet in the woman he has given this
[1:19:43] ability to be able to be conceived for
[1:19:50] try and carry the child in in all the
[1:19:53] changes that were happening before the
[1:19:55] child has its full body form the warmer
[1:20:00] will bear were barren and she will go
[1:20:02] through all of that now if that is not
[1:20:05] powerful if that is not powerful that
[1:20:13] God who gave to this woman that promise
[1:20:19] that vet you three Sacre vet she was not
[1:20:22] giving to a man go never give a man
[1:20:27] sacrifice you but three sacraments you
[1:20:31] was given to the woman and the prophet
[1:20:34] of God said it was because of redemption
[1:20:37] that God gave the woman that three
[1:20:40] soccer vets you is because God is
[1:20:43] trusting this woman with a commission of
[1:20:46] life she will be the life Giver
[1:20:56] and that is the reason why over and over
[1:20:59] in the scripture every time it comes to
[1:21:04] speaking about Redemption God will
[1:21:07] always when Abraham was losing strength
[1:21:12] he was losing strength and and he was
[1:21:16] anxious to have a child
[1:21:20] go to him I am your exceeding and great
[1:21:30] reward amen
[1:21:32] I am your exceeding and great reward
[1:21:37] come and lean on me go I was telling
[1:21:42] everyone I'm coming breasts straight
[1:21:43] from me God became L shudder he became a
[1:21:50] mother to Abraham praise the Lord
[1:21:59] right in the word we read this morning
[1:22:01] from Isaiah here is God speaking about
[1:22:04] Zion he's speaking about Jerusalem and
[1:22:09] he's saying there
[1:22:17] Jerusalem you think I have forgiven I
[1:22:19] have forgotten about B he said no just
[1:22:23] like a mother will not forget about her
[1:22:28] son that she has born I will never
[1:22:31] forget about being for a matter of fact
[1:22:34] I have engraving you in my palm
[1:22:41] praise the Lord
[1:22:45] Jesus
[1:22:46] he's to a man olive and he was so
[1:22:49] heartbroken of how the religious system
[1:22:52] has tucked the people far away from God
[1:22:55] into tradition he said Jerusalem Oh
[1:22:58] Jerusalem how I will have cover you now
[1:23:02] like a rooster
[1:23:04] the rooster don't have her I will have
[1:23:08] half of you like a hand I will bring you
[1:23:13] together
[1:23:15] that's a motherly love that's God taking
[1:23:19] the form of a mother whenever it comes
[1:23:25] to the Lord that he has for his people
[1:23:34] praise the Lord I just feel sorry for
[1:23:39] that young man I think it would have
[1:23:45] been a better he stand a better chance
[1:23:47] if you have said I don't understand this
[1:23:49] I don't understand what it's written
[1:23:52] like that you stand a better chance for
[1:23:55] God to bring understanding your way
[1:23:58] because the scripture says if any man
[1:24:01] secret wisdom let he acts of God and God
[1:24:04] would grant it to him whatever man would
[1:24:07] just look at that in and said sir I
[1:24:09] don't know why the Bible would says this
[1:24:11] and I don't want to have nothing to do
[1:24:13] with it there is nothing about this God
[1:24:20] now we're talking this morning on all
[1:24:22] the father has given me and where I want
[1:24:25] to go into this morning is intellectual
[1:24:28] faith versus divine right
[1:24:31] halation praise the Lord on Wednesday
[1:24:37] night we speak we spoke a little bit
[1:24:39] there on ask chapter 19 how I pullo's
[1:24:43] and those men that's to honor John
[1:24:47] teaching they were kicked I was looking
[1:24:50] at the timeline from the time John the
[1:24:52] Baptist preached and he was arrested and
[1:24:55] put into prison to the time of Acts
[1:24:57] chapter 19 that was about forty years or
[1:25:00] a little bit plus and you think about it
[1:25:04] after those people sat on that revival
[1:25:09] that just lasted six months I mean when
[1:25:12] John the Baptist came on the scene
[1:25:13] everybody knew something was happening
[1:25:15] in Jerusalem praise the Lord because
[1:25:18] they have heard the kind of for
[1:25:20] preaching that they have never heard
[1:25:21] before he was not afraid of anybody
[1:25:25] praise the Lord and he was calling the
[1:25:29] people to repentance he saw how they
[1:25:33] were dressing in the adage and he
[1:25:35] rebuked them for the address call he
[1:25:37] rebuked them for the correct for the
[1:25:39] corruption and ash that they all come to
[1:25:42] the water than beef and be baptized he
[1:25:49] had a ministry and it was to introduce
[1:25:53] the Messiah praise the Lord
[1:25:56] and when John's two on Jordan the update
[1:25:59] and said behold the lamb of God that
[1:26:01] takes away the sin of the world he have
[1:26:04] introduced the Messiah amen
[1:26:09] he came to the climax of his ministry
[1:26:12] even though he stood around a little bit
[1:26:15] too you know for the loose ends together
[1:26:16] and even there the imprisoned he sent
[1:26:18] some of his disciples and said go and
[1:26:20] ask is he the one all is dead is that
[1:26:24] another one we should be looking for
[1:26:25] Jesus said blessed is he that is not
[1:26:27] offended II mean well what what what
[1:26:31] what attracted me to this is that they
[1:26:35] keeping power that was aimed at six
[1:26:38] months half of a year revival that could
[1:26:42] keep those people
[1:26:44] the Bible speaks of them there in Acts
[1:26:47] chapter 19 that they were dedicated now
[1:26:51] you find people that you know they
[1:26:53] confess the Holy Ghost they confess the
[1:26:55] move of God the time God they confess
[1:26:57] the saving power the Mormon is still
[1:26:59] having an issue with scriptural things
[1:27:02] or maybe a problem with their system the
[1:27:05] first thing they do to tell that it no
[1:27:07] longer believe this thing this starts to
[1:27:09] go back to the scene filter came out of
[1:27:12] which mean all you here to was just in
[1:27:16] your mind and you have never been here I
[1:27:20] mean if your belief is has become a
[1:27:25] principle that have changed your life
[1:27:26] even if you don't like my preaching even
[1:27:29] if you don't believe this message it
[1:27:31] never changed the Holy Ghost from
[1:27:33] keeping you living a holy life why would
[1:27:40] a person said there is nothing to this
[1:27:42] message and any go right back to the
[1:27:44] word they go back into our door traitor
[1:27:45] go back into living wrong they go back
[1:27:47] into dressing wrong are we together that
[1:27:55] is the trouble of intellectual faith
[1:27:59] those men are chapter 19 they never had
[1:28:03] intellectual faith John spoke about the
[1:28:06] Messiah they never saw the Messiah but
[1:28:09] yet the world was in your heart Jesus
[1:28:16] came and their history and a half years
[1:28:18] ministry they never never follow the
[1:28:21] never went to the Torah my olive where
[1:28:25] Jesus was preaching I mean here - John
[1:28:30] what don't give them they were faithful
[1:28:32] they were dedicated they were looking
[1:28:35] for the Messiah they never had the
[1:28:40] opportunity to see him in flesh but
[1:28:43] because they were dedicated and truthful
[1:28:46] to the word that John gave them when
[1:28:48] Paul came alone it was not difficult
[1:28:52] they never saw Jesus in the flesh but
[1:28:55] they saw Jesus in the world
[1:29:02] praise the Lord amen and we see those
[1:29:11] things all through the scripture
[1:29:15] Paul said our mouths have forsaken me he
[1:29:19] talks about Alexander Smith and all of
[1:29:22] these people that was standing with Paul
[1:29:24] he went with him they saw him healing
[1:29:27] the sick they saw him doing that I mean
[1:29:30] with with all the churches that he works
[1:29:33] with they saw this man going into prison
[1:29:36] coming out of prison preaching the same
[1:29:38] gospel but when he got to the place that
[1:29:41] he could not understand why with such a
[1:29:44] man of a ministry of the caliber of Paul
[1:29:50] he will be complaining with her eyes
[1:29:52] problem I mean they could not put those
[1:29:58] things together
[1:30:01] how can he be praying for people and
[1:30:03] even his own alive it's not even better
[1:30:08] no no this thing of psychology there is
[1:30:11] something about this thing intellectual
[1:30:16] faith we only carry the pressing so long
[1:30:22] it can carry a person so long but it
[1:30:29] will not be able to deliver you on the
[1:30:31] other side praise the Lord
[1:30:36] amen and will now be able to deliver you
[1:30:40] on the other side and right over here in
[1:30:42] Saint John chapter 6 that's the reason
[1:30:44] why we had to read the entire chapter we
[1:30:47] saw a year there were Jesus and the
[1:30:49] amazing thing here is there I'm John in
[1:30:53] writing in writing his testimony or his
[1:30:59] record of Jesus he brought Jesus right
[1:31:03] into the feast if you read from sin John
[1:31:07] chapter 2 sin John chapter 1 John did a
[1:31:12] lot of introduction in the beginning was
[1:31:14] the word the Word was with God the world
[1:31:16] wars if I Fletcher word took on flesh he
[1:31:19] came unto his own his own receiving
[1:31:21] neighbor and many John did there to
[1:31:23] introduce Jesus as the word amen but he
[1:31:28] brought it right into the feasts from
[1:31:32] sin John chapter 2 altars in John
[1:31:35] chapter 7 there was a time where Asia
[1:31:39] was celebrating oh there are seven
[1:31:42] feasts or this happy between that time
[1:31:46] are we together and right here in st.
[1:31:51] John chapter 6 it was the feasts of a
[1:31:56] living bread now you follow me now John
[1:32:01] is talking about Jesus here introducing
[1:32:05] Jesus and his approach was different
[1:32:07] from Matthew we spoke on the four
[1:32:10] Gospels before much you introduced Jesus
[1:32:13] as a king amen
[1:32:20] he introduced him as a king right there
[1:32:24] in the beginning of Matthew that's were
[1:32:27] it was a where is he that is born King
[1:32:29] of the Jews
[1:32:33] mark introduced him as a seven look deal
[1:32:39] with him as the son of man but John was
[1:32:45] a different kind
[1:32:47] okay man he was a different kind when he
[1:32:52] talks about Jesus he said he was the
[1:32:55] word from the beginning amen
[1:32:59] the word right from the beginning right
[1:33:02] from God's mind the one by whom all
[1:33:07] things were created are we together but
[1:33:12] yeah he brings Jesus right into the
[1:33:16] feasts for sure and and fulfill what
[1:33:19] Jesus said he said I am the lord of the
[1:33:23] Sabbath which means the Sabbath and all
[1:33:27] the feasts that was given to Israel in
[1:33:29] Thompson's shadow was speaking about
[1:33:31] Jesus that's why right here on the feast
[1:33:35] of unleavened bread he comes out and
[1:33:37] tell the people I am the bread from
[1:33:39] heaven they just come from the
[1:33:44] synagogue's and they are doing the
[1:33:46] unleavened bread celebration and this
[1:33:48] man is saying he's the brain why because
[1:33:53] they're that ordinance the Moses gift to
[1:33:56] them was speaking about this man it was
[1:34:00] speaking about Jesus and he's coming
[1:34:02] right there to identify himself with the
[1:34:05] feets
[1:34:05] he never went to celebrate the feasts
[1:34:08] just read recently on carefully Jesus
[1:34:12] never went into the feasts why because
[1:34:15] he was the fulfillment he waited for
[1:34:17] them to come from the feast and he's too
[1:34:20] out and saying you people coming from
[1:34:21] eating unleavened bread I am that Bread
[1:34:27] amen
[1:34:28] you following your tradition come and
[1:34:30] eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:34:33] how can this man say this people who
[1:34:39] rather follow the laws the crease and
[1:34:43] the dogma of a tradition than to take
[1:34:46] the word in flesh this word want to
[1:34:50] embody your flesh praise the Lord this
[1:34:56] world want to be flesh in you
[1:35:02] this word is not satisfied of you
[1:35:05] reading every morning and every evening
[1:35:07] if it can live in you praise the Lord
[1:35:13] it's not satisfied the Bible is looking
[1:35:16] at you take me from the pages the word
[1:35:20] is saying I want to get from the pages I
[1:35:22] want to embody you I want to live in you
[1:35:25] I want to live through you just like
[1:35:39] Adam was a living monument this world
[1:35:42] want to be a living Bible in you
[1:35:50] praise the Lord
[1:35:55] see that's the thing that breaks God's
[1:35:57] heart we can cherish this Bible and we
[1:36:01] must cherish it and we we must respect
[1:36:05] it we can keep it on or put it to the
[1:36:09] best place in our house amen
[1:36:12] but if the word is not having three
[1:36:15] minutes in your life God is so
[1:36:18] heartbroken they want to keep me in a
[1:36:22] book when I want to live in them people
[1:36:29] want to keep me in a book and just put
[1:36:31] me on a shelf that's my Bible or Jesus
[1:36:36] thank you
[1:36:42] Oh God on these words to move out of
[1:36:46] these pages leaving you he never went to
[1:36:56] the office
[1:37:01] amen
[1:37:07] the scripture says right after he fed
[1:37:09] the monster - you and all of that he got
[1:37:11] on the boat he went on the other side
[1:37:14] how are we to get him when he fed the
[1:37:22] people with the loaves of bread a little
[1:37:28] bit ago you know where does the the
[1:37:32] scripture was playing this morning we
[1:37:33] were listening to and I was there the
[1:37:35] Bible says right there in st. John
[1:37:37] chapter 6 there were five tiles in men
[1:37:41] I remember a preacher that said to mean
[1:37:49] he said brother won't read that strict
[1:37:51] read again I read it was 5000 men and
[1:37:54] then I went on he says you realize that
[1:37:57] we have said over in almost a jesus
[1:38:00] prayer five times in the scripture only
[1:38:02] counts are the men not the women and the
[1:38:04] children amen
[1:38:09] and then when we get down to counting
[1:38:12] the children we have to look for boys
[1:38:13] and girls so God just sealed it up
[1:38:19] praise the Lord
[1:38:21] Amy let's go ahead so the scripture says
[1:38:25] after Jesus fed him this is wow this is
[1:38:33] he that the scriptures spoke about now
[1:38:37] realize now read now the Bible says and
[1:38:40] Jesus slipped away from them because
[1:38:42] they were thinking to make him their
[1:38:45] king the Jews wanted to be free from the
[1:38:52] Romans amen
[1:38:55] if this man can feed 5000 with a loaf of
[1:38:59] bread and the fish my goodness
[1:39:02] we can start our own government he can
[1:39:05] be our King we can be quite away from
[1:39:09] the Romans he would feed everybody they
[1:39:15] were looking to a physical and material
[1:39:19] manifestation
[1:39:21] I mean they were looking for what he can
[1:39:27] do for them what he can do for them and
[1:39:33] that's what people call religion that's
[1:39:36] what they call church it's what what
[1:39:41] they can do for me what the church can
[1:39:43] do for me praise the Lord
[1:39:51] that's what Jesus came they came on the
[1:39:54] other side to meet him and says oh my
[1:39:56] sir we've been looking for you
[1:39:59] Jesus are you not really coming after me
[1:40:01] because you you want the word you are
[1:40:05] now after the teachings you are not
[1:40:08] after being change you are not after
[1:40:11] ignoring the God of Abraham Isaac and
[1:40:15] Jacob
[1:40:17] you are just after your belly
[1:40:22] what can feel you are walking walking
[1:40:24] aside to you for the time
[1:40:28] praise the Lord you know after the
[1:40:35] changing power
[1:40:40] how would you get it
[1:40:46] so when Jesus went on and started to
[1:40:48] tell them your father ate manna in the
[1:40:52] wilderness well I am the true bread that
[1:40:54] came from heaven now these very people
[1:40:56] that were thinking to make him King
[1:40:59] there's every people that said just
[1:41:03] yesterday when he fed him that this is
[1:41:05] he that the prophets are spoken about
[1:41:12] when he identified himself with the
[1:41:14] scripture the I am the true bread that
[1:41:17] comes from heaven is this not Joseph's
[1:41:21] son it's not the boy that fits my table
[1:41:25] the last time the one that Joseph sent
[1:41:29] to hang my door
[1:41:34] praise the Lord
[1:41:36] just yesterday they were saying this is
[1:41:39] he that the scripture or the Prophet
[1:41:43] spoke about so what does prophet spoke
[1:41:46] about how did they conceive it
[1:41:51] it was just mentor say today I mean that
[1:42:00] we apply it to so some things that
[1:42:02] please them and when it didn't matter
[1:42:04] pleased him when it did not pleased it
[1:42:06] they were not apply it to it
[1:42:15] are we together but you see the trouble
[1:42:18] year is there we all receive the word
[1:42:23] true mental faith that's the trouble it
[1:42:29] is when a word is preached we receive
[1:42:34] the word through our mentor faith and
[1:42:42] then it leaves from you and then becomes
[1:42:44] divine revelation in the heart amen now
[1:42:53] that word becomes divine revelation in
[1:42:55] the heart when the individual believe
[1:42:58] that that is God's Word it's there in a
[1:43:02] mental ring when the person starts to
[1:43:04] think how can that be really sign says
[1:43:10] this and the Bible says this how can
[1:43:12] that be and it's that's the reason about
[1:43:18] reasoning about the word in your mind
[1:43:20] that would just be a mint of faith
[1:43:23] oh okay I see okay yeah okay okay I see
[1:43:26] because because because it's just a mint
[1:43:30] of faith no matter how you can explain
[1:43:32] it the Word of God is true because God
[1:43:37] said so amen
[1:43:42] the Word of God is true because God said
[1:43:45] so
[1:43:53] because you believe that there is a
[1:43:54] living God
[1:44:04] let's read this up a second coming he
[1:44:07] says as a man thinketh in his heart the
[1:44:17] scientists said that God got everything
[1:44:19] mixed up there was no mental faculty in
[1:44:24] a heart to think with he just think with
[1:44:30] his mind his mind was the only thing he
[1:44:34] thinks and net with his heart with the
[1:44:41] mind but God said as a man thinketh in
[1:44:45] his heart praise the Lord Amen now you
[1:44:53] see science always want to come and
[1:44:55] disprove what God says using God's
[1:45:00] creation let them make their own amen
[1:45:08] let them make their own this man that
[1:45:11] God has seen as a man thinking in his
[1:45:13] heart God made a man God knew that there
[1:45:18] was a compartment in a man's heart the
[1:45:22] blood does not runs true
[1:45:31] a few week ago medical science found
[1:45:34] that in the center of the heart it's a
[1:45:39] tiny little place that don't have blood
[1:45:41] cells or anything around it and the
[1:45:45] claim is the occupation of the sole
[1:45:50] animal doesn't have it
[1:45:52] so after all God was right when a man
[1:45:58] thinketh in his heart
[1:46:05] are we together
[1:46:12] and we realize people most especially
[1:46:18] living in such an age and information
[1:46:21] age praise the Lord
[1:46:24] where we have truth information and
[1:46:27] false information but you see people
[1:46:34] believe in all of the things that is out
[1:46:38] there and don't know nothing about the
[1:46:43] God that put it out there and that is
[1:46:50] the thing that is killing that is
[1:46:52] killing many people after going 10 years
[1:46:57] 20 years 30 years 40 years calling to a
[1:47:04] belief system and it has never if you're
[1:47:09] whatever you believe cannot be able to
[1:47:13] make God real to you praise the Lord
[1:47:18] if you are just believing it for the
[1:47:21] rules you are setting yourself a time
[1:47:26] bomb praise the Lord
[1:47:32] I mean because when you're fit drops
[1:47:36] down in your heart it brings a birth
[1:47:40] amen and that birth will bring a life
[1:47:44] that is not your life is God's life amen
[1:47:49] the new birth brings God's life many
[1:47:52] times we want to think that a new birth
[1:47:54] is our life because I stopped smoking no
[1:47:58] because I saw God taking cigarette from
[1:48:01] me in my life that's what the new the
[1:48:03] new birth is is the life of God it's
[1:48:10] making career to you because you can see
[1:48:14] your weakness and your failure yet you
[1:48:16] can see God working on the inside you
[1:48:20] can see God helping you that's what the
[1:48:23] new birth is it's not your personal
[1:48:25] possession it's not your personal
[1:48:32] possession for you to be boastful about
[1:48:34] it I was born again my life change I'm
[1:48:39] not like you it's not your personal
[1:48:42] possession you have never seen what our
[1:48:44] birthdays because with the new birth you
[1:48:50] will see your old man lying on the body
[1:48:52] on the bed and you will see the
[1:48:55] brand-new man praise the Lord
[1:49:03] that's what a divine favor would do
[1:49:06] that's what a divine revelation will do
[1:49:09] it will bring a breath in your life
[1:49:17] that's why every day you will go by and
[1:49:21] your time go for grace praise the Lord
[1:49:26] that's the reason why when the man is
[1:49:29] born again or the woman is born again
[1:49:30] and they can see this birth they cherish
[1:49:33] it
[1:49:35] amen they cherish it
[1:49:39] they know that it's precious because I
[1:49:44] can see what I am I can really see how
[1:49:48] awful I am but I thank God for this
[1:49:51] precious gift that he have given me I
[1:49:55] thank God for this precious gift when I
[1:50:02] start to get angry and start grinding my
[1:50:04] teeth no angle you want to destroy this
[1:50:07] baby that's when the word becomes a
[1:50:17] divine revelation because what a
[1:50:20] revelation does is that a reveille to
[1:50:22] you a reveal it gives you a vision of
[1:50:26] this new life and what is doing how it's
[1:50:31] helping you what many people takes the
[1:50:38] new birth in an intellectual way I went
[1:50:44] to the revive where I said Jesus Christ
[1:50:45] I said it's in a prayer and they can go
[1:50:50] one week with a good feeling and the
[1:50:54] next week they don't know what is
[1:50:56] happening why because that experience is
[1:51:01] just it's just mentally you want to
[1:51:03] understand Jesus say you can you feel
[1:51:06] where the wind come from you feel a
[1:51:08] blowing you don't know where it's coming
[1:51:10] from you don't know where it's going you
[1:51:13] can understand it
[1:51:16] sometimes gonna put your life on the
[1:51:19] wheels and he's trying to deal with
[1:51:22] certain thing in your life are you
[1:51:23] trying to impart setting grace to you
[1:51:26] and you get on the wheels and things are
[1:51:28] happening I can understand it
[1:51:32] oh-ho but I believe there's a new life
[1:51:35] Gary I know it's because of this new
[1:51:37] birth this thing is happening to me
[1:51:40] I can understand it but I believe it and
[1:51:44] because I know it is God's life and Noah
[1:51:48] story to come out good
[1:51:50] it's going to come out good because
[1:51:53] everything he made in the beginning was
[1:51:54] good the scriptures say it was good and
[1:51:57] he made this it was good he made it was
[1:52:01] good until it became very good but
[1:52:08] intellectual faith it's killing people
[1:52:12] we want to understand everything we want
[1:52:18] to have our life so line as before we
[1:52:21] know what is going to happen from now
[1:52:23] what is the time it's almost 1:00
[1:52:25] o'clock I don't even know what's going
[1:52:27] to happen before the time reached one
[1:52:29] o'clock
[1:52:38] you know we get we get we we are
[1:52:41] actually at this place where our life is
[1:52:44] so scheduled until we want to put God on
[1:52:48] that schedule 7:00 a.m. this is what
[1:52:53] we're supposed to do we have in our our
[1:52:56] exercise to do our medication to take
[1:52:58] our breakfast the kind of a food that we
[1:53:00] must eat in between this time - that's
[1:53:01] the everything is so schedule it's not a
[1:53:12] bad thing I mean it's not a bad thing if
[1:53:18] your life that way is to help you it's
[1:53:24] not a bad thing but where it becomes
[1:53:29] dangerous it's worth we want to apply
[1:53:32] that to what God is doing we want to
[1:53:38] process all of that through our mind
[1:53:42] amen
[1:53:43] I give my life to God now yeah okay I
[1:53:47] received the holy God and this is going
[1:53:48] to happen and this is going to happen in
[1:53:50] this is going to happen he that cometh
[1:53:54] to God must believe that he is and he is
[1:54:00] the rewarder of those that diligently
[1:54:03] seek Him
[1:54:08] are we together containing for the faith
[1:54:11] there's quite a difference you mean
[1:54:14] having intellectual faith than a divine
[1:54:17] faith there's where you are my Baptist
[1:54:21] friends fail to go on because
[1:54:25] intellectual fail would just put you to
[1:54:27] the place make you to believe that you
[1:54:28] have it everything is okay praise the
[1:54:33] Lord but understand this understand
[1:54:36] these principle people right from the
[1:54:38] beginning when God started working he
[1:54:42] never rested every other day god there's
[1:54:46] something new he never rested until he
[1:54:50] got a man in His image if God did that
[1:54:56] to the earth is the same thing he's
[1:54:58] going to do to you every day you will
[1:55:01] have your daily challenge God is working
[1:55:04] on you he's not going to rest until he
[1:55:07] gets you in His image
[1:55:18] you get intellectual faith by that but
[1:55:23] it must be a divine revelation to you
[1:55:25] that just came out of my heart
[1:55:29] intellectual faith is not enough you can
[1:55:36] know the books of the Bible you can know
[1:55:38] the verses in the Bible you can know the
[1:55:41] course of the message it's not enough
[1:55:47] you must be able to identify what God is
[1:55:52] doing in your life he wanted people
[1:55:59] that's one of his three for purpose that
[1:56:02] he can have the preeminence in the
[1:56:05] people that was saying that my will but
[1:56:07] let your will be done I don't understand
[1:56:10] it but I believe law you are in control
[1:56:16] praise the Lord I don't understand it
[1:56:20] but I believe you are in control I mean
[1:56:26] do we understand how we sleep
[1:56:33] this whole thing about sleep have you
[1:56:36] ever thought about it what real asleep
[1:56:38] is I know I put something into your mind
[1:56:44] I don't know myself
[1:56:45] I just need and pray commit myself to
[1:56:49] God go to bed praise the Lord
[1:56:55] but the thing about it they're the
[1:56:57] reason why I say this is that you want a
[1:56:59] bed last night you woke up this morning
[1:57:01] you believe that you are here you
[1:57:07] believe that you are here if you and I
[1:57:11] yeah we will not see you in service this
[1:57:12] morning are you here are you here do you
[1:57:17] believe that you are here amen
[1:57:21] oh this whole thing is a dream to you do
[1:57:25] you believe you are here you are here
[1:57:29] I believe I'm here I believe you are
[1:57:31] here
[1:57:38] and we together just as a person you
[1:57:47] know are you born again then the first
[1:57:55] thing instead of yes or no or by the
[1:58:00] grace of God thank God for what God is
[1:58:02] doing my life the first thing we go to
[1:58:04] is to explain what a new birth is that's
[1:58:08] not it's mental faith well okay when you
[1:58:12] say born again what do you really mean
[1:58:13] do you mean the new birth or when did I
[1:58:15] accept the Lord Jesus Christ or sense
[1:58:18] when I've been going to church all of
[1:58:20] those things then we get into doctrine
[1:58:24] we want to explain it let me really
[1:58:26] explain what I mean to you Oh Lord Jesus
[1:58:36] do we work in a salon do a work in us
[1:58:45] instead of appreciating what we know let
[1:58:48] us as preciate what you are doing what
[1:58:50] we are feeling in us what is happening
[1:58:53] in us because you can explain what is
[1:58:58] happening there
[1:59:01] you can explain the flame that is that
[1:59:04] is burning in you they almost want to
[1:59:06] burst out you can't you can't explain it
[1:59:14] you just feel a joy inside of you just
[1:59:17] feel the goodness of the Lord when you
[1:59:20] realize that God has been so good to you
[1:59:23] you feel so good in you it's almost like
[1:59:25] you want to explore but you don't even
[1:59:27] know where the explosion would come out
[1:59:28] of sometimes we are afraid I don't know
[1:59:33] whatever can water out of my mouth out
[1:59:35] of my head I don't even know so we try
[1:59:37] to continue in intellectual faith
[1:59:46] it's killing people
[1:59:51] it's killing good people seeking to
[1:59:58] understand and understand and understand
[2:00:03] no matter how much you know you will
[2:00:07] always need to know no matter how much
[2:00:12] you know you will always need to know
[2:00:20] praise the Lord
[2:00:23] amen you always need to know you can be
[2:00:34] in the building you know every crack and
[2:00:36] corner of that building when you get to
[2:00:39] a door that is luck you always want to
[2:00:42] know what is happening behind it so no
[2:00:45] matter how much you know you will always
[2:00:50] need to know because there was situation
[2:00:56] I will come up and you will want to
[2:01:07] but when their divine revelation is
[2:01:11] settled down in your heart you know that
[2:01:15] God is and he's in control praise the
[2:01:21] Lord
[2:01:23] he's in control
[2:01:35] it just makes you to trust and just love
[2:01:39] and just believe it's really little
[2:01:44] bitty and in the end we'll find a place
[2:01:45] to close on this the Holy Spirit is a
[2:01:48] personal experience of the birth the new
[2:01:51] birth regeneration making a new creature
[2:01:55] in Christ unveiling of God he says you
[2:02:00] can explain faith it's something that
[2:02:04] you believe and it's so solid that there
[2:02:08] is nothing else can take its place it's
[2:02:13] when it has dropped down here amen
[2:02:17] you can feel it you know is there you
[2:02:25] might be trouble in the spirit worried
[2:02:31] but you can fit it in your heart and it
[2:02:35] brings you to the place to know that
[2:02:38] it's going to be okay because God is in
[2:02:41] control
[2:02:54] Second Coming you you can have
[2:02:57] intellectual fit by year in the world
[2:02:59] and perceiving it in your mind and
[2:03:03] accepting it upon those basis which is
[2:03:07] intellectual faith you hear the word
[2:03:11] yeah that makes right yeah that sounds
[2:03:14] good
[2:03:16] perceive it in your mind you pause for a
[2:03:19] while oh okay I see where he's going
[2:03:21] okay yeah yeah yeah he's preaching the
[2:03:25] message receive that in your mind and
[2:03:30] upon the basis of that you believe okay
[2:03:32] yeah that's true because it makes sense
[2:03:36] and that would just be intellectual
[2:03:39] faith welfare is that there Jesus was
[2:03:45] speaking up in Saint John 5:24 he died
[2:03:48] hearing my word and believed on him that
[2:03:50] sent me hath everlasting life that
[2:03:51] doesn't comes from intellectual faith
[2:03:54] there comes from a born-again experience
[2:03:57] as a man thinketh in his heart he's born
[2:04:02] again and from that comes forth
[2:04:04] I thought his soul not from his mind but
[2:04:09] from his soul something that tells him
[2:04:11] that it is wrong and country and
[2:04:15] encontrar is wrong amen I hope you get
[2:04:18] it you know it anyhow oh now what the
[2:04:22] doctor says what the doctor says what
[2:04:26] the Evangelist says you know every time
[2:04:30] in your soul you can bring it right back
[2:04:35] home amen
[2:04:38] no matter what the doctor said about
[2:04:40] your be of your medical condition you
[2:04:43] can bring it right back home you know
[2:04:48] right down in your soul that's a God I
[2:04:50] have that separated me from my mother
[2:04:52] womb and kept me all this time
[2:05:02] it is just like they're flying the
[2:05:04] spirits I spoke about this morning the
[2:05:09] higher you go the smaller life situation
[2:05:16] becomes to you when your problems are
[2:05:21] becoming so big and so visible to you
[2:05:24] you are losing attitude I mean when they
[2:05:29] are becoming so visible and the
[2:05:31] beginning to trouble you you can
[2:05:32] identify you can see what is happening
[2:05:34] here you can see what is happening here
[2:05:36] you can see everything around you are
[2:05:38] losing attitude
[2:05:43] praise the Lord
[2:05:46] then you beginning to dissent you better
[2:05:52] step on that gas and take it up again
[2:05:54] brother
[2:05:57] you better find another route of faith
[2:05:59] and just get up into the heavens
[2:06:04] world those things will start
[2:06:06] disappearing from your eyes amen
[2:06:09] life situation you will just see them
[2:06:12] they're just looking like a you can't
[2:06:14] really identify it is there but it's
[2:06:19] look is so small because you are so much
[2:06:23] in his presence
[2:06:26] praise the Lord
[2:06:32] and that was the difference between the
[2:06:37] LA Ephesian Church those people got a
[2:06:40] divine revelation your revelation and a
[2:06:46] true revelation will keep you I mean
[2:06:51] even when there is no church when there
[2:06:54] is no preacher it's a life inside where
[2:07:03] Bram says is what the dog eats and make
[2:07:06] the outside of the body clean it's what
[2:07:11] it keeps inside
[2:07:19] when we start struggling with things in
[2:07:21] our mine and giving our said reason why
[2:07:27] we should do things
[2:07:28] what's the special when it's contrary to
[2:07:31] the Word of God then you just been
[2:07:33] following the Lord all of these years
[2:07:35] just by a mentor faith your experience
[2:07:38] with God must affect your life when the
[2:07:47] Pharisees I mean those wise men came and
[2:07:49] asked for Jesus that's for the king we
[2:07:57] have seen his time and we have come to
[2:07:59] worship Him
[2:07:59] harro called them those tribe they could
[2:08:02] sit right there and turn into the book
[2:08:05] and said go to the Book of Micah chapter
[2:08:07] 5 that's what it's written is supposed
[2:08:09] to be in bed to him
[2:08:10] that's what our prophet said out of
[2:08:13] Judah will come it's time they knew what
[2:08:17] the scripture says but Jesus walking
[2:08:24] right into their presence never affected
[2:08:27] them a look at a woman at a will look at
[2:08:34] me remodeling that came falling down at
[2:08:36] his feet they knew her life they could
[2:08:40] see whatever but she said right knee
[2:08:45] right there wept use her hair clean his
[2:08:48] feet and Jesus said go and sin no more
[2:08:50] what a word what a word to hear from the
[2:08:53] Masters mouth it was not a commandment
[2:08:56] he was pronouncing and declaring on her
[2:08:59] life now a woman caught in adultery
[2:09:03] praise the Lord
[2:09:05] now I could see him here on to his feet
[2:09:09] say okay master see you you say you do
[2:09:13] you know Moses said this and but now you
[2:09:16] said what do you say about this praise
[2:09:21] the Lord
[2:09:24] amen glory be to God he says neither do
[2:09:33] i condemn thee go and see no more where
[2:09:38] Benham talks about representation he
[2:09:41] says the woman at the well had a
[2:09:44] representation in her amen
[2:09:48] she had a representation here's where
[2:09:52] the struggle was the mountain she was
[2:09:54] talking about in Samara was Mount Moriah
[2:09:58] that was where God met Abraham so she's
[2:10:03] saying this you said it's in Jerusalem
[2:10:06] that we should worship but this is where
[2:10:08] God met our father Abraham are you
[2:10:11] greater than him praise the Lord
[2:10:16] that's what she was taught but down in
[2:10:21] her heart
[2:10:22] there was a representation praise the
[2:10:27] Lord
[2:10:28] and when Jesus got down to telling her
[2:10:31] how fat you have six husband and the man
[2:10:35] that you live with is not your husband
[2:10:37] she said I perceive you know when when
[2:10:42] the word stat this guy's in you amen the
[2:10:48] word start taking all the disguise from
[2:10:50] on you all the place you are hiding man
[2:10:57] glory be to God
[2:11:01] she says sir I perceive
[2:11:07] now you are a prophet
[2:11:14] that's what the divine faith would do
[2:11:19] what are you reading your Bible or
[2:11:21] whether God is dealing with you in your
[2:11:23] own private closet or whether is under
[2:11:25] the preaching of the word you don't go
[2:11:29] hiding yourself it becomes a love affair
[2:11:34] you want to run out and embrace him

[2:12:12] the scripture said Enoch walked with God
[2:12:13] and he was not that man had a revelation
[2:12:23] he never had hi in those days but
[2:12:28] whenever he gets out to walk he goes
[2:12:33] talking by himself and people think he's
[2:12:36] losing his mind he was walking with God
[2:12:40] there was something real to him when he
[2:12:45] goes talking Lord you know you know what
[2:12:47] I'm dealing with father I thank you for
[2:12:49] a good day today and he go just talking
[2:12:53] and sometimes he laughing by himself and
[2:12:55] people think oh wow this guy's strange
[2:12:58] he was walking with God
[2:13:08] that's how God want to be personal in
[2:13:11] our life amen he want to be visible to
[2:13:16] you
[2:13:17] pressing help in time of trouble I'm
[2:13:25] telling you intellectual faith that was
[2:13:29] what Judas had in his faith hang him
[2:13:35] and them as the cup was made Alexander
[2:13:40] all these people they had intellectual
[2:13:42] faith they when we pour all of these
[2:13:44] years since how can a man be like this
[2:13:47] owner one coat he has what a court has
[2:13:50] to do with what God is doing in a man's
[2:13:51] life why should people limit God's
[2:13:54] dealing with a man with material things
[2:13:56] when we are not saved by a corruptible
[2:13:59] seed we are saved by an incorruptible
[2:14:02] seed so God is doing an incorruptible
[2:14:05] life I mean work in our life and this
[2:14:11] whole age has limit God to corruptible
[2:14:14] things with a prosperity gospel
[2:14:26] and that's why these people were doing
[2:14:28] the owner wanted him for what he could
[2:14:32] gave to them what they could eat what
[2:14:36] they could drink but the reason why go
[2:14:43] on you because you have always been part
[2:14:46] of him all the father has given me

[2:19:50] oh really you have to remember when God
[2:19:58] call you when the Lord met you he met
[2:20:02] you personally amen
[2:20:05] he met you personally God was not

[2:20:21] [Music]
[2:20:22] we're living in an age where people want
[2:20:25] the popular idea when we sit in the mess
[2:20:29] of few people and you think that
[2:20:31] everybody is saying something and
[2:20:33] everybody that agreed with one another
[2:20:34] or that made sense I see why they all
[2:20:37] believe it when God
[2:20:50] you gotta stay with what God is doing in
[2:20:56] your life and how he's making himself
[2:20:58] real even if the popular opinion don't
[2:21:02] go for it you got hope you gotta keep it

[2:21:30] people talk a lot about better better
[2:21:31] than even Jesus Christ
[2:21:33] and whatever it is but go back to your
[2:21:37] experience go back to those things they
[2:21:40] have to affect your life that I've taken
[2:21:42] habit away from you it was not a man
[2:21:46] it's not a work of a man one of the
[2:21:50] dangerous thing is when people just
[2:21:52] conform they see people doing things so
[2:21:56] they start doing it there is no life and
[2:21:58] then there is no birth in there but
[2:22:01] those things that God has given you by
[2:22:04] an experience those things that God has
[2:22:07] rough in your life don't let no man take
[2:22:11] it away don't let no situation take it
[2:22:16] away you have to believe this was God
[2:22:19] [Music]
[2:22:35] since we have seven the Living God
[2:22:39] our God is a living God the one that we
[2:22:42] serve he's the creator of heaven and
[2:22:44] earth we can limit God to forms increase
[2:22:48] a man's opinion
[2:22:51] [Music]
[2:22:53] we have to believe God for who he is
