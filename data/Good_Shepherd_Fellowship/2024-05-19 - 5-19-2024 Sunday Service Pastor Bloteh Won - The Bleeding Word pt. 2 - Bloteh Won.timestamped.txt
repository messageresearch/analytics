[56:22] Peter he will be with us he will speak
[56:24] Wednesday night and then uh will speak
[56:26] on Sunday morning normally we will have
[56:28] a weekend service for our Memorial day
[56:32] but not this year not this year and and
[56:35] uh uh uh and and uh
[56:42] um even uh uh July July about the second
[56:47] or third week we normally we have uh a
[56:50] weekend service for uh
[56:54] um our church uh anniversary meetings
[56:57] we've been doing that since we came back
[56:59] from coov because uh uh that was some of
[57:03] the reason why we broke down the walls
[57:05] and did all of this just to be able to
[57:08] to to honor the church for being here
[57:11] all of these years so uh but this year
[57:14] what we will do instead of having the
[57:16] weekend service we'll have a praise
[57:18] night and that's what we will do with
[57:20] brother young that will be coming from
[57:22] Tennessee be coming with his wife hoping
[57:25] to come with with one of his sister
[57:27] that's brother Bill Young's brother this
[57:29] brother was uh he was a 10 evangelist
[57:33] many years back uh in the early 80s 70s
[57:36] and 80s he was a preacher carrying tents
[57:39] around the US speaking but then after
[57:42] the while he got off the field and then
[57:46] uh uh he went into using the inspiration
[57:49] of preaching now he's using that
[57:52] inspiration to write Psalms he wrote
[57:54] over 200 Psalms uh right from the
[57:57] message of the hour and uh uh
[58:02] um his songs were were very very uh
[58:07] inspirational and and comfort to me when
[58:10] I when I heard them back back uh back in
[58:13] the
[58:14] early late 90s early
[58:17] 2000 uh uh someone gave me a copy of his
[58:21] songs and they were really a blessing
[58:23] and uh uh there's one song he sang few
[58:27] of them we sing here all is well all is
[58:29] well we have heard the message Shalom he
[58:31] wrote that song and uh I want to thank
[58:34] you Lord for letting me hear your word
[58:37] he wrote that song and uh uh and one
[58:41] song he wrote that uh
[58:45] uh uh is that song uh
[58:49] uh I used to like this song because of
[58:53] uh uh the missionary spirit that was for
[58:56] me uh he says uh uh let's carry the word
[58:59] wherever he sent he says uh we all he
[59:02] says maybe the last one is right in your
[59:04] backyard you don't have to go to Puerto
[59:06] Rico you don't have to go to Mexico
[59:08] there might be your neighbor could be
[59:10] the last seed and that was very blessing
[59:12] so we'll have him here in July and uh
[59:15] and then he'll be doing a Saturday night
[59:17] singing for us just like we did the last
[59:19] time with brother Christin from from uh
[59:22] London so uh uh and then Sunday morning
[59:26] do couple of songs and then we will
[59:28] preach or have someone preach and then
[59:31] uh that would be what we want to do for
[59:33] our church anniversary
[59:36] weekend and uh so this morning we want
[59:39] to bring a praise report just like I
[59:41] said brother Joel Pasco in

[1:03:04] this morning uh uh St John chapter 20 we
[1:03:08] take our Bibles and read this morning St
[1:03:11] John chapter 20 and uh
[1:03:16] uh couple of weeks back I think a week
[1:03:19] or two I I I preach on the message the
[1:03:22] bleeding word I want to do a part two of
[1:03:24] that we were talking about the blood uh
[1:03:28] how it's not the the the chemical blood
[1:03:31] it's not the literal blood uh the blood
[1:03:34] has become the word amen why it has
[1:03:37] become the word is because the life is
[1:03:40] in the blood amen The Life of Christ has
[1:03:44] come back on his word praise the Lord
[1:03:48] amen what we call the Holy Ghost is the
[1:03:51] word of God promis that have come back
[1:03:53] to the believer as a life
[1:03:56] so uh uh that's uh that's what we want
[1:03:59] to address this morning so let's go to
[1:04:02] to St John chapter
[1:04:04] 20 let's go to St John chapter
[1:04:07] 20
[1:04:11] uh I was not I was not I I I went into
[1:04:14] this a little bit when I was away away
[1:04:17] there in uh uh Tennessee uh speaking
[1:04:20] there for my my good old friend brother
[1:04:23] young and just like I said on Wednesday
[1:04:26] night and we were we were just talking
[1:04:28] on the blood that speak better things
[1:04:31] and we were talking about how the word
[1:04:33] becomes the blood and uh and I mean the
[1:04:36] Holy Spirit came down in the service and
[1:04:38] and uh uh it was just awesome to feed
[1:04:42] the presence of the
[1:04:45] Lord are we
[1:04:50] together let's read from uh verse 19
[1:04:54] let's read from verse 19 it might it
[1:04:56] might just be fitting for
[1:04:59] us it might be fitting for
[1:05:02] us read from verse 19 St John chapter 20
[1:05:06] reading from verse
[1:05:08] 19 then the same day at
[1:05:12] evening being the first day of the week
[1:05:17] which is
[1:05:18] Sunday when the doors were shut where
[1:05:22] the disciples were assembled for fear of
[1:05:25] the
[1:05:26] Jews praise the Lord all of these guys
[1:05:29] were
[1:05:30] afraid at the time Jesus was present
[1:05:33] with them they were talking all over the
[1:05:35] place praise the Lord but now they are
[1:05:38] afraid and that's what happen when we
[1:05:40] don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:44] amen for fear of the Jews came Jesus and
[1:05:48] stood in the midst where did he came
[1:05:50] from the doors were shut that's what the
[1:05:52] Bible says when the doors were shut
[1:05:57] where the disciples were assembled for
[1:05:59] fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in
[1:06:02] their mess and said unto them peace be
[1:06:05] unto you praise the Lord
[1:06:09] hallelujah if Jesus would do that this
[1:06:12] morning in a physical body some of us
[1:06:14] may
[1:06:15] faint with the door shut he just comes
[1:06:18] through the wall and say peace be unto
[1:06:21] you praise the Lord so we realized that
[1:06:24] he was he was not in uh uh uh uh
[1:06:27] terrestrial body he was not in this body
[1:06:30] he was in more of celestial
[1:06:34] body it's it's another form of body but
[1:06:38] it's a body it's a body that can be seen
[1:06:41] but yet is a body that is not uh uh
[1:06:45] subject to the element of time praise
[1:06:48] the Lord
[1:06:51] amen verse 20 and when he have uh said
[1:06:55] so or so said Peace be unto you he said
[1:06:59] Peace be unto you and when he has so
[1:07:01] said he show unto them his hands and his
[1:07:06] side then where the disciples Glide they
[1:07:10] were afraid first but now they are glad
[1:07:13] why because he's with them when they saw
[1:07:16] the Lord then said Jesus unto them again
[1:07:21] peace be unto
[1:07:23] you as my father have sent me even so
[1:07:28] sent are
[1:07:30] you and when he have said
[1:07:34] this he breathed on
[1:07:36] them and said unto them receive ye the
[1:07:42] Holy Ghost are we together he said
[1:07:47] receive ye the Holy Ghost now you have
[1:07:49] to realize that this is before
[1:07:53] Pentecost okay this is before Pentecost
[1:07:57] but he's breathing on
[1:08:00] them he breathed on them and he says
[1:08:04] receive ye the Holy Ghost let's read the
[1:08:06] next verse
[1:08:08] down whosoever sin ye
[1:08:13] remade they are remade it unto
[1:08:17] them and and whosoever sin ye
[1:08:22] retain they are retained

[1:09:36] ourself up Lord father oh God for the
[1:09:39] great translation hour we pray that Lord
[1:09:42] father you will just come and take your
[1:09:43] word this morning break it to our hearts
[1:09:46] oh Father Lord in the name of Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ we pray amen amen the Lord bless
[1:09:52] you you have your seat while we turn to
[1:09:56] second Timothy chapter
[1:09:58] 3 second Timothy chapter
[1:10:12] 3 second Timothy chapter
[1:10:19] 3 praise the Lord
[1:10:31] second Timothy chapter
[1:10:32] 3 and uh they are there but I'm looking
[1:10:35] for verse 16 2 Timothy chapter 3 if
[1:10:39] that's where you are I'm looking for
[1:10:42] verse
[1:10:45] 16 praise the
[1:10:47] Lord in second Timothy chapter 3 the
[1:10:50] Bible says all
[1:10:52] scriptures all scripture
[1:10:55] is
[1:10:56] given by inspiration of
[1:11:00] God if you remember we spoke on this
[1:11:04] time back and the reason why I'm coming
[1:11:07] to this because that word
[1:11:11] inspiration in the Greek it means the
[1:11:14] Breath of
[1:11:16] God are we together amen all scripture
[1:11:22] is the Breath of God
[1:11:26] and like I said before God don't have no
[1:11:29] bad
[1:11:32] breath amen God don't have bad breath
[1:11:37] the Bible says and God breathed into the
[1:11:39] nostril of man and Man became a living
[1:11:42] Soul praise the Lord so you take it back
[1:11:46] to what Paul is saying all scripture
[1:11:48] keep that verse up all
[1:11:51] scripture is given by the birth of God
[1:11:54] which means mean every word from the
[1:11:57] Bible is is the Breath of God so which
[1:12:02] mean is giving to give life yes when if
[1:12:06] God breathe in the beginning and his
[1:12:09] birth make man a living Soul means that
[1:12:13] every scripture in the Bible is to give
[1:12:18] life is the Breath of God to give
[1:12:21] life are we together
[1:12:25] and because it's the Breath of God Paul
[1:12:28] says is
[1:12:32] profitable is profitable for Doctrine
[1:12:36] and we said Doctrine is what is Right
[1:12:40] Doctrine is the backbone of the church
[1:12:44] because the church is not run by our
[1:12:48] ideas we don't run church about our
[1:12:51] ideas or our feelings we must bring
[1:12:54] everything that we are doing back to the
[1:12:58] scripture if a church does not have a
[1:13:01] Doctrine is it's it's not a church you
[1:13:04] don't have nothing that you are standing
[1:13:08] for praise the
[1:13:10] Lord so Paul is saying that every
[1:13:14] scripture that is given to us from the
[1:13:18] word of God is God's breath and he and
[1:13:21] he breathed upon us just like we saw in
[1:13:24] in in in John Chapter 20 The Bible say
[1:13:28] he appeared to them even before the Holy
[1:13:30] Ghost before they will have
[1:13:33] Pentecost he appeared to them peace be
[1:13:37] unto you that's why he said praise the
[1:13:40] Lord he moved forward again he said
[1:13:43] Peace be unto
[1:13:45] you and the Bible says he breathed upon
[1:13:50] them praise the Lord without saying
[1:13:53] nothing to them he just
[1:13:58] he was doing the very same thing that he
[1:14:01] did in Genesis 1 or Genesis yeah Genesis
[1:14:05] uh uh
[1:14:06] 2 it's in Genesis 2 that he breathed
[1:14:10] upon man and Man became a living Soul so
[1:14:12] the same thing that he did in Genesis 2
[1:14:15] he's doing it year now in another form
[1:14:18] because what this time is a spiritual
[1:14:20] birth that he's giving to the to the to
[1:14:22] the disciples
[1:14:25] are we together so Paul is saying all
[1:14:29] scripture is given by the Breath of God
[1:14:32] and it's
[1:14:34] profitable it's
[1:14:37] profitable are we
[1:14:40] together every scripture is profitable
[1:14:43] for Doctrine Doctrine is what is
[1:14:47] Right
[1:14:52] amen for Doctrine
[1:14:55] is profitable for
[1:14:59] reproof it's profitable for reproof and
[1:15:03] reproof is what is not right so it's in
[1:15:07] a sense that every scripture is there to
[1:15:11] tell us what is right and what is not
[1:15:15] right what we should do and what we
[1:15:19] should not
[1:15:22] do are we together is profitable for
[1:15:26] Doctrine for
[1:15:28] reproof and for
[1:15:31] correction correction is how to get
[1:15:37] right praise the lord it's good for what
[1:15:40] is right but if we don't have it right
[1:15:44] then we need correction to tell us how
[1:15:46] to get it
[1:15:49] right because if God will correct us for
[1:15:52] not doing right and don't tell us how we
[1:15:56] can get it
[1:15:58] right praise the Lord that's the
[1:16:01] difference between punishment and
[1:16:05] discipline amen punishment you are
[1:16:08] locked up for the wrong that you are
[1:16:09] done discipline you are told that this
[1:16:12] is not right this is the way to do
[1:16:15] it so every scripture is given for
[1:16:18] correction how to get it right and also
[1:16:22] for instruction how to keep it right how
[1:16:26] to stay
[1:16:28] right are we together it's good for
[1:16:32] Doctrine Doctrine is what is right what
[1:16:34] we need to stand for what are we build
[1:16:37] on Jesus said Upon This Rock I will
[1:16:40] build my church what is the principle
[1:16:43] why are we
[1:16:46] here are we just trying to add to the to
[1:16:49] the to the uh uh 900 plus different
[1:16:52] churches that are already upon the Earth
[1:16:54] what are we
[1:16:57] here are we together but I I I brought
[1:17:00] this scripture so we can be able to get
[1:17:03] an Insight on what uh Jesus was doing
[1:17:06] there to the disciples the Bible says he
[1:17:09] breathed upon them and he says unto them
[1:17:12] receive ye the Holy
[1:17:15] Ghost praise the Lord amen he says
[1:17:19] receive ye the Holy Ghost so uh uh uh uh
[1:17:25] the Holy Ghost is the Breath of God is
[1:17:28] is the life of God and when we when we
[1:17:31] started talking on this subject we uh uh
[1:17:35] we try to establish you know how uh the
[1:17:39] life is in the blood that's the reason
[1:17:42] why uh uh in the Old Testament under the
[1:17:45] sacrifice of bulls and goat they were
[1:17:47] not supposed to you know uh uh uh temple
[1:17:51] with the L the blood the blood was
[1:17:54] offered they had to be pulled you know
[1:17:56] the priest deal with that and all of
[1:17:58] that and
[1:18:01] uh but this morning I want to go I want
[1:18:04] to go in the direction here hoping and
[1:18:07] just trusting that the Lord will be able
[1:18:10] to to help me let's just let's read
[1:18:13] something from the fourth seal we we
[1:18:15] read this we read this uh when we
[1:18:18] started uh uh on the subject so we want
[1:18:22] to read this from the fourth seal
[1:18:25] the the mysterious
[1:18:27] rather watch how he does now oppos
[1:18:31] refuse to repent and and to go back to
[1:18:35] the original blood
[1:18:38] word the word becomes blood and
[1:18:42] flesh praise the Lord this this is all
[1:18:46] this is all back in the church ages you
[1:18:49] know there were four h rather when you
[1:18:52] read in Revelation you the four h R so
[1:18:56] uh uh and and and we realized that uh
[1:19:00] these RS uh they were they were power
[1:19:03] powers of of of the devil that was
[1:19:06] trying to handle the church they were
[1:19:09] trying to handle the church from
[1:19:11] experiencing the literal life of Jesus
[1:19:14] like we always say Satan don't have a
[1:19:16] problem if you just want to be reles he
[1:19:19] does not have a problem if you want to
[1:19:21] be uh a church member but it's Shak him
[1:19:25] in his bats if you want to be a Son of
[1:19:27] God Amen if you want to be a Son of God
[1:19:30] that take God by his word and be serious
[1:19:33] on the word of God the devil don't have
[1:19:35] a place to stand with that amen so uh uh
[1:19:39] uh bringing this start we we we we we
[1:19:43] want to uh uh trying to show how the
[1:19:46] word
[1:19:48] becomes the
[1:19:52] Flesh and the blood the the word becomes
[1:19:56] the Flesh and the
[1:19:58] blood when when we spoke on that I gave
[1:20:02] you uh uh we share uh uh Joseph
[1:20:08] experience in
[1:20:10] praising praise the Lord amen in most
[1:20:15] cases when we talk about Joseph being a
[1:20:18] type of Jesus Christ we look at the two
[1:20:22] men that were in praison and we say one
[1:20:25] man got freed and one man died just like
[1:20:27] Jesus on the cross but but we we realize
[1:20:31] it was more than dead because it was not
[1:20:34] only the two men but it was also the Two
[1:20:38] element that they have one was a
[1:20:41] baker the bread the other one was a cup
[1:20:46] Bearer a brocca which is a cup Bearer
[1:20:50] and he had the wine and both the bread
[1:20:54] and the wine wine Jesus uses there to
[1:20:57] represent his life he says take this
[1:21:01] bread amen and the bread represent his
[1:21:05] body which was
[1:21:07] death praise the Lord amen so the baker
[1:21:12] dying was representing the death of
[1:21:18] Jesus are we together and the and and
[1:21:22] the cup Bearer uh being the life was
[1:21:25] representing the blood of the New
[1:21:31] Covenant are we
[1:21:34] together praise the
[1:21:40] Lord amen you love the Lord amen yeah we
[1:21:45] thank the Lord for his uh for his grace
[1:21:49] and and u
[1:21:54] now so we see here uh uh trying to take
[1:22:00] take that and and and and and bring that
[1:22:02] to a place so we can we can see how the
[1:22:06] word becomes the blood
[1:22:10] amen now this that we read from St John
[1:22:14] chapter 20 was after the
[1:22:17] resurrection but before the death and
[1:22:20] the
[1:22:21] burial and the resurrection Jes Jesus
[1:22:25] will have his last service with the
[1:22:27] church his last meeting will be the
[1:22:31] communion
[1:22:32] service that will be his last service he
[1:22:35] will have and uh uh uh and and and
[1:22:38] during that service he will take he
[1:22:41] would take uh uh a bread an un living
[1:22:44] bread and he would take uh uh a wine
[1:22:47] from from the van and then he will bring
[1:22:50] it and the disciples are looking at him
[1:22:52] he takes it and then uh uh He blesses it
[1:22:57] and he says Take and Eat This is my
[1:23:01] body praise the Lord amen he said Take
[1:23:05] and Eat This is my body he takes the cup
[1:23:09] pour the wine and he bless it he says
[1:23:11] this take drink this is the blood of the
[1:23:15] New
[1:23:16] Covenant amen now he's taking the wine
[1:23:21] like we said we are we are not we are
[1:23:23] not Catholics to believe that uh the
[1:23:26] bread is the literal body of Jesus or
[1:23:30] the wine is the literal blood of Jesus
[1:23:32] that's not what we believe we believe
[1:23:34] that that is a representation amen now
[1:23:37] let's look in the scripture and see why
[1:23:41] that was important the reason why it was
[1:23:44] important I read a scripture to you
[1:23:46] before we go further is that
[1:23:50] Jesus is trying to
[1:23:54] to point the church he's trying to point
[1:23:57] the
[1:23:58] disciples back to the
[1:24:00] word praise the Lord he's trying to
[1:24:04] point the disciples back to the word
[1:24:06] because in the Old Testament when they
[1:24:09] come to the Tabernacle and the uh and
[1:24:12] and they and they offer uh uh uh a lamb
[1:24:17] the the the high priest put the hand of
[1:24:19] the the worshipper on the lamb he
[1:24:21] confessed all his wrong and and and the
[1:24:24] lme is killed in the place of the
[1:24:26] worshipper are we together and when the
[1:24:30] lme is killed what they do is there they
[1:24:33] take the body of the Lamb they burn it
[1:24:37] praise the Lord and when they burn it
[1:24:40] they take the
[1:24:43] Arches amen they take the arches of the
[1:24:47] Beast and they come and and they M it
[1:24:50] with
[1:24:51] water praise the Lord they take the
[1:24:54] arches of the red haer and they mix it
[1:24:58] with water and that water during the
[1:25:01] service is is sprinkle on the
[1:25:04] congregation now it's it's a it's a
[1:25:07] symbol it's a sign that this animer gave
[1:25:13] his innocent life for for the
[1:25:15] worshipper amen praise the Lord so just
[1:25:19] as the animer is innocent the sprinkling
[1:25:23] of the water water
[1:25:25] represent pardon and and and innocent
[1:25:28] that the wrong that you have done has
[1:25:30] been placed under the blood now you are
[1:25:33] free to go you are innocent are we
[1:25:36] together so the the the the sprinkling
[1:25:39] so now Jesus now he's he's bringing his
[1:25:43] disciples to the place to
[1:25:45] realize that in few
[1:25:49] hours because it was it was the the the
[1:25:52] night before he was arrested in few
[1:25:54] hours he's going to be giving his
[1:25:58] life praise the Lord he's going to be
[1:26:01] giving his life he's going to die on the
[1:26:04] cross of Calvary he will be nailed he
[1:26:06] will be pierced in the side and all of
[1:26:08] that but
[1:26:10] yet I was I was speaking there in uh uh
[1:26:14] uh uh Tennessee I said Jesus never told
[1:26:18] him I'm going to die you'll gather all
[1:26:22] the buckets and all the gall that you
[1:26:24] can get and Y go and meet me on calary
[1:26:28] when that Blood start pouring youall put
[1:26:30] the bucket there and take as much as you
[1:26:33] can praise the
[1:26:35] Lord but he's going to take a
[1:26:41] representation amen and said this
[1:26:45] wine represent the blood of the New
[1:26:50] Covenant are we
[1:26:53] together so now the
[1:26:57] representation is now going to be
[1:27:02] greater than his lital
[1:27:07] blood because the representation is
[1:27:10] going to stay with the church or
[1:27:14] alone are we together are you seeing the
[1:27:18] picture praise the Lord let's look over
[1:27:22] here in Hebrew chapter 13
[1:27:25] maybe Hebrew chapter 13 will help us to
[1:27:29] to be able to go further with that oh
[1:27:32] God help me this
[1:27:34] morning I need your help
[1:27:37] amen I need your help this morning
[1:27:40] Hebrews chapter
[1:27:45] 13 you read Hebrews chapter 10 chapter
[1:27:48] chapter 9 and 10 you would see where
[1:27:50] Paul was talking about the sprinkling
[1:27:53] but Hebrew chapter
[1:27:57] 13
[1:27:59] amen now let's read verse 20 Hebrew 13
[1:28:02] reading verse 20 list now see how the
[1:28:05] Apostle Paul speaking to the Jewish
[1:28:08] church here he he will uh uh bring it
[1:28:12] out he says now the God of
[1:28:14] Peace that brought again from the dead
[1:28:18] our lord
[1:28:20] Jesus the great Shepherd of the Sheep
[1:28:24] through the blood of the Everlasting
[1:28:29] Covenant now what was the blood of the
[1:28:33] Everlasting
[1:28:35] Covenant was it the literal blood that
[1:28:38] was shared or was it the
[1:28:41] representation because Jesus says take
[1:28:45] drink this is the blood of the New
[1:28:49] Testament the blood of the New Testament
[1:28:52] is the blood of the Everlasting Covenant
[1:28:56] why because the blood of the New
[1:28:58] Testament that word testament is the
[1:29:01] same as
[1:29:03] Covenant amen a a a a it override the
[1:29:07] old
[1:29:09] Covenant the New Covenant when a New
[1:29:11] Covenant is brought in the old Covenant
[1:29:14] is done away
[1:29:16] with praise the Lord so you see Paul is
[1:29:19] saying here that that that that that
[1:29:23] Jesus raised from the dead on the
[1:29:26] promise of the blood of the New
[1:29:31] Covenant are we
[1:29:37] together so he said now the God of Peace
[1:29:41] that brought again from the dead our
[1:29:43] lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the
[1:29:46] sheep through the blood of the
[1:29:48] Everlasting cover them make you perfect
[1:29:51] in every good
[1:29:53] works to do his will working in you that
[1:29:58] which is well pleasing so what is that
[1:30:02] working in us what is that fulfilling
[1:30:05] that praise the lord we realize that it
[1:30:09] is not just uh it is not just uh uh uh
[1:30:14] uh you know the the the the old doing or
[1:30:18] just the the physical blood but it is
[1:30:20] the spiritual is the spiritual effect of
[1:30:23] the blood is the word that is that is
[1:30:26] working in US Amen to make us perfect in
[1:30:29] every good work to do his will working
[1:30:32] in you that which is well pleasing in
[1:30:36] his
[1:30:37] sight praise the Lord
[1:30:41] amen we took another one also and and
[1:30:45] and that one is is one that is that is
[1:30:47] very common to to every one of us we
[1:30:50] just want to do a little review here
[1:30:52] let's go back to first John chapter
[1:30:55] 1 1 John chapter 1 John bring it out
[1:31:00] more clearly here first John chapter
[1:31:04] 1
[1:31:06] amen 1 John chapter
[1:31:10] 1 we will just read from verse six we
[1:31:13] actually want to read verse S but let's
[1:31:15] read verse six
[1:31:17] quickly if we say that we have
[1:31:20] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[1:31:22] we lie and do not the truth verse seven
[1:31:26] but if we walk in the
[1:31:28] light as he is in the
[1:31:31] light we have Fellowship one with
[1:31:35] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:31:38] his son cleans us from all sin so again
[1:31:44] Paul is making us to see our connection
[1:31:47] with the blood is our walking in the
[1:31:51] light
[1:31:54] amen as we walk in the light of God's
[1:31:57] word that is our access to the blood and
[1:32:00] the Very easier way to to be able to see
[1:32:03] it it is the same provision that God
[1:32:06] Made For Adam and Eve when when when
[1:32:09] when the broke God's word the Bible says
[1:32:12] he killed a lamb in the East of Eden and
[1:32:14] and he brought it because there is no
[1:32:17] way that a holy
[1:32:18] God praise the
[1:32:21] Lord amen I was reading some something
[1:32:24] and uh where one time uh uh uh uh I
[1:32:29] think there
[1:32:31] socr he says he says I do not
[1:32:36] see how a holy
[1:32:39] God can reconcile a sinful man he says I
[1:32:43] believe it but I do not see
[1:32:46] it because because there has to be a
[1:32:49] meeting
[1:32:50] Ground God in his holiness there is no
[1:32:54] way we in our sinful nature can come
[1:32:59] unless there is a meeting
[1:33:01] ground praise the Lord amen and that is
[1:33:05] the same provision that God made he took
[1:33:07] he took a bleeding lamb and went after
[1:33:10] and went after H H Adam and Eve and went
[1:33:14] after Adam Adam where are you praise the
[1:33:16] Lord like a like I normally said God
[1:33:19] knew where Adam was it's just that Adam
[1:33:21] never knew where he was
[1:33:24] amen God was not asking the question in
[1:33:26] the sense that he don't know where Adam
[1:33:28] was he knew exactly where Adam was but
[1:33:31] Adam never knew where he was praise the
[1:33:33] Lord for the fact that he was not at the
[1:33:35] place that God placed him amen he was
[1:33:38] hiding behind a fake Lea when God has
[1:33:40] set him to the place of dominion and
[1:33:42] ruler over the Earth praise the Lord
[1:33:45] hallelujah so so so when when when God
[1:33:48] coming to look for Adam there is the
[1:33:50] holy God that is coming to find a sinful
[1:33:53] man he brought a provision of a bleeding
[1:33:57] skin praise the Lord because God will
[1:34:01] only meet us through the
[1:34:04] blood it has to be through the blood so
[1:34:07] God coming to look for Adam he brought
[1:34:10] the bleeding skin and when you read
[1:34:11] there in Genesis the Bible says he
[1:34:14] robbed Adam and Eve took up their fi
[1:34:16] leaf and he wrapped them up in the
[1:34:18] bleeding skin and in that way he sent
[1:34:21] them from his presence the blood now now
[1:34:24] h h h mediate between God and
[1:34:27] man praise the Lord So Adam and his wife
[1:34:31] was walking away from the presence of
[1:34:33] God with blood dripping
[1:34:36] down it became like a constant at
[1:34:40] me praise the Lord so now God will do
[1:34:43] the same for you and myself this time it
[1:34:46] would not be a fresh bleeding skin but
[1:34:49] it would be his word that's the reason
[1:34:52] why John said if we walk walk in the
[1:34:54] light just like Adam walking with the
[1:34:57] ship skin W around him if you are
[1:35:00] walking with the word r around you then
[1:35:03] you have access to the
[1:35:09] blood are we
[1:35:11] together praise the Lord if we walk in
[1:35:15] the light as he is in the
[1:35:18] light the blood of Jesus Christ cleans
[1:35:21] us from all sin
[1:35:27] I was I was thinking about
[1:35:30] something uh during the
[1:35:32] week and uh we would let's let we would
[1:35:35] do we would quickly do a run through and
[1:35:38] be able to and look out there this
[1:35:40] morning I I pray that it will get our
[1:35:42] attention just like it did God m in the
[1:35:45] days of Noah the Bible says God saw that
[1:35:49] men were
[1:35:51] evil amen God saw that men the
[1:35:56] imagination of of of men thoughts was
[1:35:59] evil and he was coming
[1:36:02] down to George the word but there is a
[1:36:06] statement there where the Bible says
[1:36:10] that no flesh will be
[1:36:12] saved
[1:36:14] amen and it it is not the one that
[1:36:16] struck me more more High the one that
[1:36:19] struck me is that because of the evil
[1:36:22] that was upon the Earth the Bible says
[1:36:24] the spirit of God will not strive with
[1:36:28] men amen the spirit of God will now
[1:36:32] strive with men because his
[1:36:35] imagination was evil
[1:36:37] continuously are we together amen look
[1:36:42] at this
[1:36:44] Paradox that H uh almighty God spirit
[1:36:48] will not will not will not come close to
[1:36:51] a man who IM imagination is evil in that
[1:36:56] time think about that now look at the
[1:37:00] Paradox years hundreds of years after
[1:37:04] the prophet Jo will
[1:37:09] prophesy that I will pour out my
[1:37:13] spirit
[1:37:15] upon praise the Lord if you know what
[1:37:19] the scripture is let's say it don't be
[1:37:21] afraid Jo proph prophesy that I will
[1:37:24] pour out my spirit upon All
[1:37:30] Flesh you see the
[1:37:33] Paradox glory be to God I will tell you
[1:37:37] I will show you why that is a
[1:37:40] paradox in Jeremiah chapter 17 verse
[1:37:45] 9 Jeremiah chapter 17 ver9 is a very
[1:37:51] familiar verse
[1:37:55] if you don't know it by heart if you get
[1:37:57] there you will know that you know it
[1:37:59] it's just that you didn't know the
[1:38:03] verse the Bible says
[1:38:06] that the heart of
[1:38:10] man
[1:38:14] amen Jeremiah chapter
[1:38:17] 17 verse
[1:38:21] 9 the Bible says that the heart of man
[1:38:26] is desperately
[1:38:28] wicked glory be to
[1:38:30] God
[1:38:34] Amen the heart of man is is is
[1:38:38] deceitful above
[1:38:40] all and desperately wicked who can know
[1:38:44] it now if you if you look at that word
[1:38:48] carefully I think sometime back I I read
[1:38:51] that to you it means me that the heart
[1:38:55] of man is
[1:38:59] incurable the heart of man is
[1:39:03] incurable that is the defect of the
[1:39:09] Fall the heart of man is
[1:39:12] incurable now a person can have a heart
[1:39:15] attack people goes to the hospital they
[1:39:17] do Heart bass that is just the muscle of
[1:39:20] your heart they are repairing for the
[1:39:22] blood flow
[1:39:24] it's not the heart that the Bible is
[1:39:26] talking
[1:39:28] about it's just the muscle of your heart
[1:39:31] the one that you have in you is the
[1:39:33] muscle for your blood flow there are
[1:39:35] four vibes your heart have four Vibes
[1:39:37] where the blood flow in and out of your
[1:39:39] heart to go through all your body that
[1:39:42] the doctor will be able to
[1:39:44] repair praise the Lord but the heart
[1:39:47] that is
[1:39:49] deceitful praise the Lord there are
[1:39:52] sense of the heart heart that is called
[1:39:54] the spirit man that is called your mind
[1:39:57] praise the Lord that is deceitful and
[1:40:00] the Bible says is desperately wicked who
[1:40:03] can know
[1:40:05] it
[1:40:06] amen it is it is like I said it's it's a
[1:40:10] defect from the fall when man fell from
[1:40:13] God that heart of man was was was
[1:40:17] affected with with with a sense of
[1:40:20] weakness that sometime a man can be so
[1:40:23] wicked to
[1:40:25] himself praise the Lord he can be so
[1:40:28] wicked to himself now you will see that
[1:40:30] is the reason why when you look in the
[1:40:33] Bible also in Ezekiel chapter 36 God
[1:40:37] promised that I will give you a new
[1:40:41] heart why because the old heart that we
[1:40:45] are born with is
[1:40:49] incurable praise the Lord there is there
[1:40:52] is no form of church going or religion
[1:40:56] that can change a man's
[1:40:59] heart until God gave you a new
[1:41:04] heart praise the
[1:41:07] Lord and and and what makes it very
[1:41:10] striking here when you look in the
[1:41:13] scripture here is joah that is
[1:41:16] prophesying that I will pour my spirit
[1:41:20] upon All Flesh
[1:41:24] it's a very dangerous thing when the
[1:41:28] spirit of God comes upon an unconverted
[1:41:35] heart praise the Lord when a man has a
[1:41:39] man or a woman you know every man born
[1:41:42] of a woman has the spirit of God on a on
[1:41:47] converted
[1:41:48] heart is the most dangerous thing that
[1:41:53] the word can ever
[1:41:55] have praise the Lord because that man
[1:41:59] has the spirit of God he can preach he
[1:42:02] can sink and and and and I mean he can
[1:42:05] he can get in the spirit and speak
[1:42:07] tongues and all of that but if his heart
[1:42:10] is
[1:42:11] converted praise the Lord that very man
[1:42:14] that looks like an anointed preacher can
[1:42:17] be one of the most evil
[1:42:21] men praise the Lord
[1:42:23] with a crural heart he can molest his
[1:42:26] own family he can abuse his family all
[1:42:30] in the form of
[1:42:32] religion so you see the prophecy of joed
[1:42:36] we have see we see the Pentecostal
[1:42:38] Church run with that oh that God said he
[1:42:40] will pour His Spirit on on All Flesh and
[1:42:43] and and right in there you see them you
[1:42:45] know all in the spirit prophesying and
[1:42:47] and and and their very appearance is a
[1:42:49] disobedient to God and all of these
[1:42:52] people you know what they are dealing
[1:42:53] with things fing with one another and
[1:42:55] all of that but they can come to the
[1:42:56] place and speak in tongues and you know
[1:42:58] and it's it's a very dangerous thing
[1:43:01] when the spirit of God get on an
[1:43:04] unconverted heart few weeks ago brother
[1:43:06] Lord preached a message where he was
[1:43:08] talking about Saul and the Bible says a
[1:43:11] saw among the prophets why because Saul
[1:43:14] prophesied but when it came to the place
[1:43:17] for Saul to do what the prophet Samuel
[1:43:20] told him to do he never had the heart to
[1:43:23] do it he had the spirit of God on him he
[1:43:27] could go among the prophets and prophesy
[1:43:29] and do all of that but the heart was not
[1:43:33] converted and because his heart was not
[1:43:36] converted he will argue with Samuel he
[1:43:38] would disobey Samuel and he he will even
[1:43:41] get an evil spirit a man that can get in
[1:43:44] the spirit and prophesy will yet take a
[1:43:47] javing to struck David to the war
[1:43:55] that's how the human heart is
[1:43:57] desperately
[1:43:58] wicked the Bible says no man can know it
[1:44:02] we have a generation that say follow
[1:44:04] your heart you don't know your heart
[1:44:06] don't follow
[1:44:11] it what you call follow your heart is
[1:44:13] just follow your your your
[1:44:21] desires and that that's why
[1:44:24] God will
[1:44:26] promise that I will give you a new heart
[1:44:30] he says and I will put a new spirit in
[1:44:34] you and then I will come and give you my
[1:44:43] spirit praise the
[1:44:45] lord we living in an age we're in a time
[1:44:49] where people want the church to adopt
[1:44:54] their
[1:44:56] lifestyle we don't want to do we don't
[1:44:58] want to follow the the the the scripture
[1:45:01] other looks old
[1:45:04] faction but we want the church to
[1:45:09] adopt our lifestyle now let me ask
[1:45:14] you which one will we
[1:45:17] follow praise the Lord because every one
[1:45:20] of all we like we have what we like and
[1:45:23] we have what we don't
[1:45:25] like what you like might not be what I
[1:45:27] like praise the Lord so we having
[1:45:30] problem there how can we adopt yours and
[1:45:32] leave mine
[1:45:34] out praise the Lord if the church is to
[1:45:38] adopt our
[1:45:40] lifestyle you see that's the reason why
[1:45:43] it will never works it's not going to
[1:45:45] work because God never promised Jesus
[1:45:49] never says I will build my church upon
[1:45:52] your lifestyle right no that's not what
[1:45:55] he
[1:45:56] says he says I will I will build my
[1:45:59] church Upon This Rock which is the
[1:46:02] revelation of Jesus Christ and the gifts
[1:46:04] of Hell will not Prevail against
[1:46:10] it praise the
[1:46:13] Lord that's that that is the time that
[1:46:16] we are in people we are living in such a
[1:46:19] time where all of these things is
[1:46:21] becoming a pressure
[1:46:24] on the church and because we want to
[1:46:27] keep the church door open so it looks
[1:46:29] like we must come on pressure we don't
[1:46:32] want to lose this person so they can
[1:46:34] they can bring their loose life and and
[1:46:36] then yeah we must accept it we don't
[1:46:37] want to lose this other person they can
[1:46:39] bring I mean whether the what they want
[1:46:41] to live in h h a polygamous life and
[1:46:46] have many why we must accept it because
[1:46:48] we we must keep the church the church
[1:46:50] will never survive on that it will never
[1:46:53] survive on that God that ordained his
[1:46:56] church he knows how to sustain his
[1:46:58] church the problem there is because we
[1:47:01] think church is the four walls no church
[1:47:05] is not the four walls it's not the four
[1:47:07] wall church and men and women that have
[1:47:10] given their life and ready to live a
[1:47:13] Godly life that's what the church is I'm
[1:47:16] so glad that Jesus make it so easy for
[1:47:19] me he said wheresoever two or three
[1:47:24] that's what he said praise the Lord so
[1:47:27] if I can find two or three that is ready
[1:47:30] to stand upon the word I said come let's
[1:47:33] have
[1:47:36] church praise the Lord amen church is is
[1:47:41] is classified the moment you tell
[1:47:42] somebody oh I'm a preacher how how many
[1:47:45] members do you
[1:47:47] have praise the Lord how many members do
[1:47:51] you have oh yeah we can have the
[1:47:53] thousands if we just step up the
[1:47:56] standard come as you are will not have
[1:48:00] C praise the Lord but you see what what
[1:48:04] actually is going to be is that we're
[1:48:06] just going to start another Tower of
[1:48:09] Babel praise the Lord because everybody
[1:48:11] will come with their own confusion their
[1:48:14] own argument right that's not the way I
[1:48:16] see it that I I don't believe it that
[1:48:18] way may God help us we try to stay truth
[1:48:22] to this word in the best that we know
[1:48:25] how
[1:48:28] to glory be to God
[1:48:32] Amen it has always been the problem All
[1:48:35] Through the Ages All Through the Ages it
[1:48:39] has always been the problem let me share
[1:48:42] this with
[1:48:44] you God keep his
[1:48:46] word now if you
[1:48:49] notice what caused this trouble which
[1:48:52] trouble it was that was with Moses in
[1:48:54] his
[1:48:55] exitor what caused Moses
[1:48:58] trouble there was a Mis
[1:49:02] multitude that went up with them the
[1:49:07] supernatural has been done down in Egypt
[1:49:11] and when the supernatural has been done
[1:49:13] everybody flocks
[1:49:16] in you see that's the reason why we
[1:49:18] having a generation that is that is a
[1:49:21] sound seeking generation
[1:49:25] because the moment that we can we can
[1:49:26] fake prophecy or we can fake healing go
[1:49:30] and pay somebody money and say well you
[1:49:32] walk on crutches come in church we'll
[1:49:33] pray for you and and and so it can show
[1:49:36] that we can heal the
[1:49:38] sick that's the kind of a generation
[1:49:40] that we living in Praise the Lord before
[1:49:43] we realize everybody's coming oh that
[1:49:45] that church down there they can pray for
[1:49:46] people when the supernatural is done
[1:49:50] people flock after it they are not
[1:49:53] coming for the god that do does the
[1:49:56] supernatural amen they are not coming
[1:49:59] because the identify that God is in the
[1:50:02] midst of the people no that's not where
[1:50:04] they are
[1:50:05] coming praise the Lord because now it's
[1:50:08] going to be theater just sit sit and see
[1:50:10] the men of God watch see the men of God
[1:50:13] it become a show thing
[1:50:15] now there is somebody here
[1:50:20] somebody you had a headache last night
[1:50:24] don't worry God is God is going it has
[1:50:27] just become a
[1:50:28] shamble praise the Lord it become a
[1:50:32] theater people sit in the audience and
[1:50:35] ready now to witness some kind of a
[1:50:36] clown on the
[1:50:41] pit but where is the
[1:50:45] life where is the life how can the
[1:50:49] church clean the blood without the life
[1:50:53] what was the blood sheare
[1:50:57] for praise the Lord what was the blood
[1:51:00] she
[1:51:03] for glory be to
[1:51:09] God how would you get
[1:51:21] it we have a defying
[1:51:27] age this age is defying the
[1:51:30] church Jesus said I will have a church
[1:51:33] without spot to wrinkle this age is
[1:51:35] saying no
[1:51:36] way praise the Lord no way we are going
[1:51:41] to uh h h h there there Revelation
[1:51:45] letter us to know there are 2 million
[1:51:48] demons that have been poured out around
[1:51:51] the church and and and we cannot say
[1:51:53] that we have 2 million people standing
[1:51:56] pure and clean with the
[1:52:00] word so the church having more power
[1:52:05] that is that is Waring against it even
[1:52:08] though we can say like gaha and and and
[1:52:10] Elijah there is more with us than them
[1:52:13] that are against us praise the Lord but
[1:52:16] the fact about the matter there is that
[1:52:19] we have lot of things that is Waring
[1:52:22] against the
[1:52:24] church that is trying to make the word
[1:52:27] of God of non
[1:52:30] effect it's not a problem if we just
[1:52:32] come and and and sing to the songs dance
[1:52:35] with the music and just give you some
[1:52:38] Bible story and go home but where is The
[1:52:40] Life of
[1:52:42] Christ asaiah said when the spirit of
[1:52:45] the Lord H H Spirit of the enemy come as
[1:52:47] a flood God will raise up a standard and
[1:52:50] I believe there are seen God is still
[1:52:53] here today no matter what we are dealing
[1:52:55] with God is able to raise up a standard
[1:52:59] in the life of our young people he's
[1:53:01] able to raise up a standard in our homes
[1:53:05] he's able to raise up a standard in a
[1:53:09] church that will keep it set by the word
[1:53:12] of
[1:53:17] God
[1:53:20] hallelujah it's dangerous
[1:53:23] glory be to God because we are in a
[1:53:26] defining age with everything that has
[1:53:28] been preached with everything that have
[1:53:30] been
[1:53:31] taught the people still find excuses to
[1:53:35] adopt new things in their life praise
[1:53:38] the Lord they feed from Hollywood they
[1:53:41] want to look pretty they do everything
[1:53:43] and then at the end of it the church is
[1:53:45] now burden with prayer request I was
[1:53:47] following a uh h h a young lady there
[1:53:50] you know and and uh uh down in one group
[1:53:53] there in South Africa got into all of
[1:53:55] these uh uh uh chemical body changing
[1:54:00] thing praise the
[1:54:02] lord it's God that that make the pigment
[1:54:06] of our
[1:54:08] body praise the Lord glory be to God and
[1:54:12] now she's dealing with body
[1:54:18] cancer praise the Lord why because she
[1:54:20] wanted to be pretty if he wanted to make
[1:54:23] you h h h white or whatever color you
[1:54:26] want he will have brought you that
[1:54:28] way with everything that has been taught
[1:54:31] the church always go find something new
[1:54:34] thing to
[1:54:39] adopt are we
[1:54:48] together we always try to go and find
[1:54:51] new things to ad door
[1:54:53] new form of
[1:54:55] life when we have a word that is given
[1:54:58] to us that we need to strive
[1:55:01] for praise the
[1:55:09] Lord glory be to
[1:55:13] God I was looking at something something
[1:55:15] I read last week I believe not many of
[1:55:19] you caught it
[1:55:23] because the reason why I said it is
[1:55:25] because it struck me myself I never I
[1:55:27] never saw it until I read it last
[1:55:32] week but I didn't comment on it let's go
[1:55:36] back to to uh Matthew I mean Malachi
[1:55:40] chapter
[1:55:43] 2 amen we use the
[1:55:48] scripture I'm a big believer in this
[1:55:51] scripture amen I'm a very big believer
[1:55:55] in this scripture if you read Malachi
[1:55:56] chapter 2 you will see where Malachi was
[1:55:59] was bringing he was dealing with Israel
[1:56:03] in in in an elective love relationship
[1:56:06] with Jehovah he says uh uh God telling
[1:56:10] Israel I love you you he says you are
[1:56:12] saying to me how do I love you I prove
[1:56:14] it to you just like Esau was uh Jacob
[1:56:17] brother and I said I love Esau more than
[1:56:19] Jacob praise the Lord so God was dealing
[1:56:22] with Israel in an elective law if you
[1:56:25] come down to chapter two he's talking to
[1:56:27] Israel and and and he's getting he's
[1:56:30] getting Israel in a kind of a romantic
[1:56:33] form and he says well remember the wife
[1:56:35] of your youth he said Israel I deal with
[1:56:39] you when you were just a little handful
[1:56:41] of people in in Egypt it was not because
[1:56:44] of your size I love you because I
[1:56:47] promised your father
[1:56:48] Abraham amen
[1:56:52] God told Abraham that he would become
[1:56:54] you know uh blessing like the stars of
[1:56:57] Heaven the the Sand by the seashore God
[1:56:59] gave him the blessing before even
[1:57:01] Abraham had a
[1:57:03] child are we
[1:57:07] together but y say he's dealing with
[1:57:09] Israel now and he uses this
[1:57:13] word chapter 2 verse
[1:57:17] 16 the Bible says for the
[1:57:21] Lord the god of Israel said that he
[1:57:26] hateth putting away now that word
[1:57:29] putting the way you look in different
[1:57:32] version it brings out
[1:57:35] divorce okay God is saying I hait
[1:57:40] divorce now I would read another
[1:57:42] scripture to you that will hit your mind
[1:57:45] just like it hit
[1:57:46] me praise the
[1:57:48] Lord
[1:57:50] amen God is saying saying I hate
[1:57:54] divorce and we have used like I said I'm
[1:57:57] a very big believer of
[1:57:59] that I'm very big believer of there we
[1:58:03] have we have used the scripture over and
[1:58:05] over to show how uh you know divorce is
[1:58:08] not an option but let's go to Leviticus
[1:58:12] chapter
[1:58:14] 22 Leviticus chapter
[1:58:18] 22
[1:58:20] amen glory be to God I'm going to get in
[1:58:26] trouble but as my life has
[1:58:30] been I've always been in
[1:58:33] trouble
[1:58:34] amen I've always been in
[1:58:39] trouble I've always been in trouble
[1:58:42] Leviticus chapter
[1:58:45] 22 we were reading uh last week and
[1:58:47] talking about the Widow and and how the
[1:58:50] priest is you know he takes care of the
[1:58:53] Widow he takes care of the fatherless
[1:58:55] and uh the offerings and and and all of
[1:58:58] that we were reading about that so we
[1:59:00] read this scripture last week 22 verse
[1:59:09] 13 the Bible says but if the priest's
[1:59:14] daughter be a widow which mean her
[1:59:19] husband
[1:59:20] DED or all
[1:59:25] divorce watch
[1:59:28] now in as much as
[1:59:31] God expressed to Israel and putting his
[1:59:34] word I hate putting the way I hate
[1:59:36] divorce God make provision for
[1:59:41] divorce I will tell you
[1:59:43] why let's read a little
[1:59:46] bit but if the priest's daughter be a
[1:59:49] widow all divorced
[1:59:53] and have no child and is returned onto
[1:59:57] her father's
[1:59:59] house as in her youth now this was the
[2:00:04] scripture that I read and I pointed to
[2:00:09] Hannah Anna not Hannah but Anna that was
[2:00:12] in the temple when Jesus was dedicated
[2:00:15] the Bible say uh uh uh uh her hus die
[2:00:21] and then she she she kept
[2:00:24] herself from 17 years
[2:00:27] old until she became an old woman now
[2:00:31] that was the scripture I was referring
[2:00:32] to because she was in the temple so
[2:00:35] which means she was sustained by the
[2:00:37] temple now the Bible yet is making us to
[2:00:39] to realize that if a priest daughter be
[2:00:42] a widow or divorc and have no child and
[2:00:45] his returned to her father house as in
[2:00:47] her youth so so shall he
[2:00:50] so no she shall eat of her father's meat
[2:00:56] but there shall be no stranger eat
[2:00:59] thereof praise the Lord now the reason
[2:01:02] why I brought this up is to is to let us
[2:01:05] to know that in as much as God hate
[2:01:09] divorce God hait
[2:01:14] abuse praise the Lord amen in as much as
[2:01:20] God hate divorce he hate put in the way
[2:01:23] God frown at
[2:01:27] abuse but he makes provision for one
[2:01:30] that is put away and in most cases the
[2:01:34] one that is put away has been abused
[2:01:36] because if you look back in the Old
[2:01:38] Testament the reason why the belt of
[2:01:41] divorcement was given Jesus said is
[2:01:43] because of the
[2:01:46] hardiness the hardiness of the heart
[2:01:50] which mean there were men that were so
[2:01:51] crural
[2:01:53] yes praise the Lord they took their
[2:01:56] wives as warp paper why because they
[2:01:59] were under the law of polygamy they have
[2:02:02] more than one wife more than two more
[2:02:05] than three so they could love this one
[2:02:08] and and if you dare do anything to me
[2:02:10] you will stay right
[2:02:12] there you will care for yourself you
[2:02:14] will do everything for
[2:02:19] yourself there was a lot of abuse that
[2:02:22] was
[2:02:26] done why because the man says I am the
[2:02:32] man so in as much as God ha divorce he
[2:02:37] frown at
[2:02:38] abuse he frown more at
[2:02:41] abuse you know
[2:02:44] why because the first daughter of
[2:02:48] God if she was abused
[2:02:56] God first daughter was
[2:03:01] abused he will make provision year for
[2:03:05] the woman that is put
[2:03:12] away glory be to
[2:03:18] God hallelujah
[2:03:21] the Bible
[2:03:23] says under the Old Testament if you
[2:03:25] really study the story you will realize
[2:03:28] that just like the daughters of zarapa
[2:03:31] had to go to Moses to obtain an
[2:03:35] instruction how they would get
[2:03:36] inheritance for their fathers that's the
[2:03:39] reason that's that was the same way many
[2:03:41] fathers many others went to Moses and
[2:03:44] say how can we deal with
[2:03:46] this Moses had to go on the mountain to
[2:03:49] seek the face of God to bring a solution
[2:03:53] why because hon the lord of polyam the
[2:03:57] woman the man had 10 wives but all the
[2:04:01] woman are obedient to
[2:04:04] him so if she's ill treated she can't go
[2:04:07] anywhere she become like a property to
[2:04:10] the man it's now under the New
[2:04:13] Covenant praise the
[2:04:16] Lord our wives are not our
[2:04:20] property amen they are not our
[2:04:28] property and that's the reason why I'm
[2:04:30] saying there I mean we we have a
[2:04:33] generation that want us to adopt their
[2:04:36] their
[2:04:40] lifestyle thank
[2:04:41] you praise the
[2:04:45] Lord now so but what I'm getting to yet
[2:04:49] is that I just I just dropped that one
[2:04:51] in for the reason I'll come back to it
[2:04:54] what I'm getting to here is that uh uh
[2:04:57] we we we talking about the bleeding
[2:05:00] word how the word bleeds for
[2:05:04] us amen the word has has has lost his
[2:05:10] life on
[2:05:15] us when we sit under the preaching of
[2:05:17] the word we are sitting under the
[2:05:19] sprinkling of the blood
[2:05:22] Paul who says in Hebrew he said just
[2:05:25] like the Old Testament instrument was
[2:05:27] sprinkled seven times so God did honor
[2:05:31] the seven Church ages to be able to
[2:05:34] bring the pure word and and and and
[2:05:36] preach it on the people through the
[2:05:38] messenger Paul and all the messenger
[2:05:40] Through the Ages God brought a pure
[2:05:46] truth when Luther came out with the
[2:05:49] judge shall live by faith it was a pure
[2:05:53] truth and those that believe that word
[2:05:56] they were Sanctified by that
[2:05:59] word are we together glory be to God but
[2:06:04] we see here with this
[2:06:06] Paradox it's a dangerous thing a
[2:06:10] dangerous thing when uh when when an
[2:06:14] unconverted heart is Anointed by the
[2:06:18] spirit of
[2:06:19] God praise the Lord
[2:06:23] you go back to uh uh uh uh first king
[2:06:26] chapter
[2:06:28] 19 Elijah on the mountain and God said
[2:06:31] what Dost thou yeah
[2:06:33] Elijah praise the
[2:06:35] Lord he say I'm the only one left God
[2:06:38] said no I have 7,000 that have not bowed
[2:06:41] down to B but let me tell you what
[2:06:43] you're going to do for me go and
[2:06:48] anoint
[2:06:50] Asel go and anoint
[2:06:53] jeu go and anoint Elisha now God was
[2:06:57] Distributing the anointing of
[2:07:00] Elijah on AEL he he's the one that will
[2:07:04] bring the world against uh uh uh
[2:07:07] Ahab he will later become the Syrian
[2:07:10] King so God put an anointing of elij to
[2:07:16] deal with the political
[2:07:19] system jood will be the one that will
[2:07:22] destroy all the prophets of B another
[2:07:25] anointing of Elijah to deal with the
[2:07:28] religious system praise the Lord he has
[2:07:31] the political system covered he has the
[2:07:34] religious system covered then the
[2:07:37] anointing on Elisha praise the lord we
[2:07:41] have the bride cover
[2:07:44] amen the anointing on Elisha will have
[2:07:48] the church cover because once again
[2:07:50] there will be a people that would say
[2:07:52] where is the god of
[2:07:58] Elijah glory be to God but if you read
[2:08:02] the story and you go on you will realize
[2:08:04] that Elijah never anointed
[2:08:08] AER he never anointed
[2:08:11] jeu the only person he anointed was
[2:08:15] elishah he throw his metal on
[2:08:18] Elisha and Elija burned all his tools
[2:08:22] and then he went with Elijah but it will
[2:08:24] be
[2:08:26] elishah that would do the finished work
[2:08:28] of
[2:08:29] Elijah so this bride is here to do the
[2:08:32] finished work of the messenger the
[2:08:34] messenger is not coming back again it is
[2:08:36] our duty praise the Lord so elishah will
[2:08:41] be the one to anoint
[2:08:43] jeu amen if you remember that in the
[2:08:46] story juu was anointed he got on his
[2:08:48] cherub and he started running and and
[2:08:51] and and another guy saw him and says
[2:08:53] that person coming looks like jum he got
[2:08:55] there he he got over there and got all
[2:08:57] the worshippers of by he says is there
[2:08:59] any worshiper bar they say yeah we are
[2:09:01] there he said you're getting let's
[2:09:03] worship bar we will worship bar like
[2:09:04] nobody has worship by he put every one
[2:09:08] of them in the
[2:09:09] house praise the Lord and He armed men
[2:09:13] with sword he said Mark all the doors if
[2:09:15] one of these Soul Le your life will be
[2:09:18] given he killed the prophets of B he his
[2:09:21] anointing was to deal with the religious
[2:09:26] system praise the
[2:09:29] Lord Elijah was the one that anointed
[2:09:34] Azar he was a young man he was just a
[2:09:37] young boy Elisha when he took he took
[2:09:41] the anointing oh where where is
[2:09:44] mine they were talking he took the oil
[2:09:48] and he broke the bottle and just wasted
[2:09:50] over him
[2:09:52] when Elijah wasted the anointing oil on
[2:09:55] him elishah started to cry the Bible
[2:09:58] said he started to cry he says I seen
[2:10:01] the evil that you will do to the
[2:10:03] daughters of Israel I see how you will
[2:10:06] smash their babies on the wall and you
[2:10:08] will rape their women he said am I a
[2:10:12] dog am I a dog for me to be so wicked he
[2:10:16] never knew what the anointing would do
[2:10:19] to his uncon converted spirit
[2:10:25] the anointing on we have a rebellious
[2:10:28] generation why because the the message
[2:10:31] of the hour is the anointing of this age
[2:10:34] you can sit under the message and and
[2:10:36] and and and become terrible because you
[2:10:40] think you know the word you can argue
[2:10:42] with the preacher but there is no
[2:10:44] conviction in the
[2:10:46] heart he started crying he said am I
[2:10:49] evil that I will do this
[2:10:52] Elijah never said one word to him but
[2:10:56] when that time God
[2:11:00] ready he was the one that brought a war
[2:11:02] against
[2:11:03] Israel he was anointed because God said
[2:11:07] that that that the dogs will eat the
[2:11:09] Flesh of Ahab just like it did over to
[2:11:12] the
[2:11:15] prophets when that anointing got a hold
[2:11:17] of him he he never even remember there a
[2:11:21] Prophet prophesy over
[2:11:25] here praise the
[2:11:29] lord it's dangerous to profess the
[2:11:32] things of God without a new
[2:11:34] birth without a new birth without a
[2:11:37] regeneration in our hearts we will hold
[2:11:40] this Bible in our hands and do
[2:11:42] wickedness even to ourself we will hold
