[1:10:42] gratitude and then uh we can we can
[1:10:47] express ourselves to the Lord tonight.
[1:10:53] Psalm 24 I read from verse one.
[1:10:58] If he if it had not been the Lord who
[1:11:02] was on our side. Now may Israel say
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; then they have swollen us up quick when
[1:11:19] their wrath was candled against us.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Then the proud waters have gone over our
[1:11:32] soul.
[1:11:33] Bless the Lord who have not given us.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[1:11:42] snail of the fowl. The snail is broken
[1:11:46] and we are escaped.
[1:11:49] Our help is in the name of the Lord who
[1:11:52] made heaven and the earth. Let's bow our
[1:11:55] heads together.
[1:11:57] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus,

[1:15:19] your seat.
[1:15:21] Praise the Lord. [clears throat]
[1:15:24] Praise the Lord. This is something we
[1:15:26] spoke on uh uh many many years back. I
[1:15:30] was looking at my note. I think it was
[1:15:31] way back maybe 2016 or so. And uh uh but
[1:15:36] I had it on my heart uh just uh just to
[1:15:41] be able to express something to you. So,
[1:15:44] like I said, uh uh might you be able to
[1:15:47] use uh uh 30 or 45 minutes just to be
[1:15:51] able to encourage our yourself tonight.
[1:15:53] And uh uh just thinking about what David
[1:15:57] said is is enough to give us a
[1:15:59] reflection. Amen. If it had not been the
[1:16:02] Lord who was on our side. Praise the
[1:16:05] Lord. Amen. And I was I was looking at
[1:16:07] that uh uh yesterday or today and then
[1:16:12] uh I was just looking through the sim uh
[1:16:15] uh how many times he expressed a similar
[1:16:19] thought as that. But uh uh
[1:16:22] [clears throat]
[1:16:23] if there is if there is one person that
[1:16:26] knows uh uh David being a shepherd boy
[1:16:29] and uh uh he knows exactly what it what
[1:16:34] it is to experience God's protection.
[1:16:36] Praise the Lord. And uh and and is uh is
[1:16:41] uh uh the experiencing of God's
[1:16:44] protection uh that we all have
[1:16:47] experienced. And that's the reason why
[1:16:50] we are here. I was I was talking with my
[1:16:52] friend and uh u my host and during the
[1:16:57] meetings we were we were just talking
[1:17:00] and and just uh uh uh expressing how God
[1:17:04] gave every mortar every mortar you know
[1:17:08] an opportunity to have a very close
[1:17:11] encounter with him. There are things
[1:17:13] that happen in our lives that we know
[1:17:16] that it had to be God.
[1:17:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; You know that it had to be God. So then
[1:17:22] he was sharing this uh uh uh
[1:17:27] he was sharing this story with me and uh
[1:17:29] uh there in South Africa, a young man uh
[1:17:33] uh work uh I think he worked all through
[1:17:35] the day, but he was trying to get back
[1:17:37] to the city. So u uh uh he he thought
[1:17:41] that okay uh he he would just you know
[1:17:44] maybe get some some red and and drink
[1:17:47] some red bold and then he will be able
[1:17:50] to to uh before it wear out of his body
[1:17:53] he will be able to drive down you know
[1:17:55] and and make it over to the city.
[1:17:58] [clears throat] So as he was as he was
[1:18:00] driving you know and uh uh I mean he was
[1:18:03] he was really driving over the speeding.
[1:18:05] He was trying to hit the road and make
[1:18:07] sure that before the tireness kick into
[1:18:10] his body, he has gone farther. And he
[1:18:13] did not know when he he I mean it
[1:18:17] probably he felt he felt you know asleep
[1:18:20] or unconscious and he went right right
[1:18:24] under the trailer.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; He went right under the trailer.
[1:18:28] [snorts] So uh the even the driver of
[1:18:30] the trailer just fed the impact. He
[1:18:33] didn't even see when the car went on a
[1:18:34] hitch, you know. Uh uh and then they
[1:18:38] brought the the the fireman and every
[1:18:40] one of them. Uh um and then uh you know
[1:18:46] they tried to to chase the car out of
[1:18:49] from under the trailer. And when they
[1:18:52] got the vehicle, out of the trailer, the
[1:18:55] young men just jumped out of the vehicle
[1:18:58] and everybody that was there, the five
[1:19:00] men, everybody scattered, everybody
[1:19:01] started running because nobody expect
[1:19:03] anybody to live from such an impact
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; that they all started running. They
[1:19:09] thought he was a ghost.
[1:19:12] But uh uh it is some of those close
[1:19:17] moment you know many of us might never
[1:19:20] had one in the way of an accident.
[1:19:24] uh maybe it was by uh uh sickness or uh
[1:19:30] uh one thing or another is I mean every
[1:19:33] one of us can tell our own story but uh
[1:19:37] God gave us those kind of m kind of
[1:19:41] moment in our lives where uh it it looks
[1:19:44] like it was a close call but to see that
[1:19:48] we survive it it only had to be the
[1:19:51] Lord.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:54] It only had to be the Lord.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; So, uh, tonight, uh, we we just want to
[1:20:01] take a little talk tonight. Like I said,
[1:20:03] the snail is broken
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; and we have escaped.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; We can tell the devil that the snail is
[1:20:11] broken
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; and we have escaped. Whatever it was,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, never got us. Amen.
[1:20:18] whatever it was never got us because the
[1:20:21] Lord was on our side.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; So, we want to just take a little
[1:20:25] thought on that and and why I was just
[1:20:28] back there preparing myself and and uh
[1:20:31] looking through because I I have
[1:20:33] something else I was going to talk on
[1:20:35] tonight but I realized that there is not
[1:20:37] enough time. So, uh uh instead of
[1:20:40] starting it and not finishing it, I
[1:20:42] would just go this way. And while I was
[1:20:45] there uh uh changing my my subject, this
[1:20:49] little uh thought came to my mind. This
[1:20:52] was a dream that uh uh was told uh in
[1:20:56] the message there uh work is fit express
[1:21:00] and uh then I want to read a portion of
[1:21:02] that to you and then we will go from
[1:21:04] there. Now this this is only a dream.
[1:21:07] And uh uh and I walk over this way and I
[1:21:11] seen brother Rod B a very good friend of
[1:21:14] mine uh living in California look like
[1:21:18] there's something wrong. His eyes was
[1:21:21] half closed and a great big maybe cancer
[1:21:26] or something over his eyes. Now someone
[1:21:30] was trying to pull me away from him. I
[1:21:33] stream brother Boulder in the name of
[1:21:35] the Lord Jesus Christ snap out of debt
[1:21:38] and he just barely could speak saying
[1:21:41] brother Brandham
[1:21:43] uh it it have to take something more
[1:21:46] than this.
[1:21:48] I just can't grasp it brother Brandham I
[1:21:52] just can't grab it. I said, "Oh, brother
[1:21:54] Boulder, I love him." And and and and
[1:21:58] someone pulled me away and I look and it
[1:22:01] was a lady standing over here. When I
[1:22:04] was a little boy, I used to haul grocery
[1:22:07] from the grocery store to the people and
[1:22:10] her name uh was uh Mistress uh Finton.
[1:22:14] She lived in Jeffersonville. Yet, a
[1:22:16] personal friend of uh to the wife and I.
[1:22:20] And she said, "Brother Brandon, deliver
[1:22:23] us from this." Now, she's part of the
[1:22:25] dream now. She's saying, "Deliver us
[1:22:27] from this." Said, "This is a house
[1:22:32] of hell."
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe we might not have been in the
[1:22:40] house of hell, but we have gone through
[1:22:42] something that was a hell.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh it's is a it's a
[1:22:49] common expression when when uh when when
[1:22:52] when when uh people are going through
[1:22:54] things that is tough they said this is
[1:22:57] hell. So uh uh uh we know uh by the
[1:23:03] teaching of the word that uh that it's a
[1:23:05] dimension. Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; It's a dimension with a descending
[1:23:11] order. Like I've said before, the Bible,
[1:23:14] we see it in the book of uh Revelation
[1:23:17] is called the bottomless pit. It does
[1:23:19] not have a bottomless. It does not have
[1:23:21] a bottom. That's what is bottomless. So
[1:23:23] it's it's it's an order where the person
[1:23:26] is continuously descending whether in
[1:23:29] their life or in their mind or in their
[1:23:32] health and and whenever it's like that
[1:23:35] naturally people will says man this is
[1:23:38] hell.
[1:23:39] Praise the Lord. Amen. So uh uh uh this
[1:23:44] lady now in this dream she's telling
[1:23:46] brother Brandham this is a house of hell
[1:23:50] and said you have been mishonto
[1:23:54] and said and you mishonto these people
[1:23:58] too.
[1:24:00] Um
[1:24:02] said these are fine people. I look over
[1:24:05] there and uh uh like a great big uh uh
[1:24:10] cellar, the big a big wall down beneath
[1:24:15] a great big cave and great iron bs eight
[1:24:20] to 10 in thick and people out of their
[1:24:24] mind twisted arms and legs beating their
[1:24:28] head against death and she was crying
[1:24:32] saying deliver the people. Brother
[1:24:34] Brandon said, "Help us. We are in
[1:24:37] trouble." She herself, I know her. She
[1:24:41] belongs to I believe the church of
[1:24:43] Christ or a Christian church called the
[1:24:46] church of the brethrens.
[1:24:48] I look around and I said now now, so as
[1:24:52] as you as you as we read and you look at
[1:24:55] it, it having a kind of a a spiritual
[1:24:58] sense. Amen. Because uh uh uh as as as
[1:25:03] we'll go over to the end, you'll realize
[1:25:05] that uh the dream was concerning his
[1:25:09] ministry, the word that would come and
[1:25:12] deliver us out of this house of hell.
[1:25:14] Amen. And uh and and that was that was
[1:25:17] that was something like that. And he was
[1:25:18] looking. I looked around and I said, "I
[1:25:21] wish I could." And go on looking around
[1:25:24] my little bitty body and and and them
[1:25:27] great big iron bars and and those poor
[1:25:30] people in there and you couldn't get to
[1:25:33] them. Them iron bars were sitting close
[1:25:36] together, very close together. No way to
[1:25:38] pull people out. I look and they were
[1:25:41] beating their heads like they were out
[1:25:44] of their mind. And I and I seen some
[1:25:48] light uh uh flickering around. And I
[1:25:51] looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus
[1:25:55] with uh a light of rainbow around him. I
[1:26:00] was looking right straight to him. I
[1:26:02] said, "Deliver those people."
[1:26:06] And he went away. And I thought, "Well,
[1:26:09] how could I deliver them?"
[1:26:13] Okay, sorry. I saw the Lord Jesus uh uh
[1:26:18] uh a lot of a rainbow around him. He was
[1:26:21] looking right straight to me and he said
[1:26:24] to brother Brandon, "Now, deliver those
[1:26:25] people." And he went away. And I
[1:26:28] thought, "Well, how could I deliver
[1:26:30] them? I haven't got strength enough in
[1:26:33] my arms to break those bonds." So I
[1:26:36] said, "House of hell,
[1:26:39] give away to the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:43] Christ." Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; And as soon as he said it, then the the
[1:26:47] the B started breaking and uh and and
[1:26:51] the people were able to come out of
[1:26:54] there. Praise the Lord.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:58] And this was uh was something that was
[1:27:01] uh uh very significant to his ministry
[1:27:04] and and and also it was describing the
[1:27:08] kind of a spiritual condition of the
[1:27:10] people. And so we can we can look at
[1:27:13] that knowing that the grace of God has
[1:27:16] been able to to to deal with us and
[1:27:18] bring us you know all through the years
[1:27:21] since our our our we gave our heart to
[1:27:24] the Lord. you know uh uh the Lord has
[1:27:26] been good to us but we can also think
[1:27:29] about it in another way with uh with lot
[1:27:32] of the things that uh you know we have
[1:27:35] we have dealt with over over this year
[1:27:38] that is finishing and some of the years
[1:27:40] that has passed the Lord has been good
[1:27:42] to us. Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh in that sense
[1:27:46] that's uh that that came to my mind. So
[1:27:49] I just I just say well let me let me
[1:27:51] search this out and and read it to you
[1:27:53] tonight. And in that sense we can look
[1:27:55] at that and say if it had not been the
[1:27:58] Lord
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; that have been on our side
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; we would have been in the house of hell.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; We will have been in the house of hell.
[1:28:11] And uh uh uh I don't know what where's
[1:28:15] your mind tonight. I don't know where's
[1:28:17] your heart tonight. And I don't know uh
[1:28:20] what uh what might be going on in your
[1:28:23] life. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; But we have a God that is able to bring
[1:28:30] us out of our house of hell.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; No matter what what you are going
[1:28:35] through.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He is a deliverer.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; He can bring us out of our house of
[1:28:42] hell.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; He can break the snail. Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; And we can fly away like a bird.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; The snail is broken and we are escaped.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; So uh uh just looking at that thought
[1:29:00] tonight and uh uh just like if if you
[1:29:05] look down here, you see what David said.
[1:29:07] I would I would just like to read over
[1:29:09] it a little bit again. If you have not
[1:29:11] been the Lord who was on our side, now
[1:29:14] the Israel said, if I've not been the
[1:29:16] Lord who was on our side when men rose
[1:29:19] up against us,
[1:29:22] then they will have swollen us up quick.
[1:29:26] The last time we we we spoke a little
[1:29:28] bit about David and his men. Amen. You
[1:29:31] just have few minutes with him. Uh those
[1:29:34] guys, they were in depth in different
[1:29:36] things as we we saw in the scripture.
[1:29:39] But uh just to see how the Lord you know
[1:29:43] uh kind of delivered them. I mean you
[1:29:46] just get few men going against the army
[1:29:48] of the nation. Saul was the king. He had
[1:29:51] the army. Praise the Lord. But yet God
[1:29:54] was able to deliver David and his few
[1:29:57] men from Saul
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; and the mighty army of Israel because
[1:30:02] the Lord was on his side.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; When men rose up against us, then they
[1:30:08] will have swollen us up quick. When
[1:30:11] their rif was scandled against us, then
[1:30:13] the waters have overwhelmed us and the
[1:30:17] uh the the stream has gone over our
[1:30:20] soul. Now, so you see here also David is
[1:30:24] not only talking about the the the the
[1:30:27] the physical struggle that he have gone
[1:30:30] through. He's also talking about a
[1:30:33] spiritual condition because now he's
[1:30:35] bringing a condition of our soul into
[1:30:38] it.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he's looking more
[1:30:42] he's comparing our physical struggle
[1:30:45] with the condition that our soul could
[1:30:47] have been in is go if God never came on
[1:30:50] the scene to deliver us.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; We will have been in the house of hell.
[1:30:58] The stream will have gone over our soul.
[1:31:00] Then the proud waters have gone over our
[1:31:03] soul. Blessed be the Lord who have not
[1:31:07] given us as a prey to their teeth.
[1:31:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. This was the very same young man
[1:31:16] that was able to deliver a lion from the
[1:31:19] I mean a a a sheep from the mouth of a
[1:31:22] lion and also a sheep from the paws of a
[1:31:26] bed. So he know what it is uh uh uh you
[1:31:30] know when uh when uh uh an animal is
[1:31:34] caught as a prey.
[1:31:37] The animal that that that that gets that
[1:31:40] uh that little lamb as as it prey is is
[1:31:43] is it's not just playing game. It want
[1:31:46] to really feed on that animal. Praise
[1:31:49] the Lord. Amen. I mean the lion coming
[1:31:52] out to snatch one of David little lamb
[1:31:55] or the bed. It was not just to be
[1:31:58] chunking the lion in the air or the lamb
[1:32:00] in the head and playing with it. No, it
[1:32:03] came to snatch it and to to eat on it to
[1:32:07] eat it dead.
[1:32:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; So when uh when an animal fought as a
[1:32:13] prey, it's it's not just a game. It's
[1:32:16] it's a life that is on the line. And
[1:32:19] David is saying here, blessed be the
[1:32:21] Lord who have not given us as a prey to
[1:32:25] their teeth.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Whether it was sickness, whatever it is
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; that could have destroyed our life, just
[1:32:34] like how you think about it, it has to
[1:32:37] be the spirit of the Lord, which of
[1:32:39] course we believe it was the spirit of
[1:32:41] the Lord.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; That uh that a a young boy in uh at the
[1:32:48] age that David was to be able to take a
[1:32:52] lamb from the mouth of a lion.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; It has to be God.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that same God that helped
[1:33:01] David to snatch out a lamb from the from
[1:33:04] the mouth of a lion is that same God
[1:33:07] that has snatched us out
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; from the devil that the Bible say is a
[1:33:12] rolling lion seeking womb to destroy.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord who have not given
[1:33:20] us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is
[1:33:23] escaped as a bird out of the snail of
[1:33:27] the father. The snail is broken and we
[1:33:31] are escape. Praise the Lord.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; All of the things that could that could
[1:33:36] have been a snail to us. You think about
[1:33:39] that. All of the things that could have
[1:33:42] been a snail to us.
[1:33:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:48] For the matter of fact, we were born
[1:33:50] right in a snail because the Bible says
[1:33:53] uh uh in sin our mother conceive us.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; So just being born in sin, we were born
[1:33:59] in a snail.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's not the grace of God, I
[1:34:06] mean we could just we could just stay
[1:34:08] under that condemnation.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Then you think about it also. I mean uh
[1:34:14] the way we were brought up, I mean the
[1:34:16] the the
[1:34:18] uh uh uh things that have to do with our
[1:34:22] our family, our you know our our
[1:34:25] environment and and and some of the
[1:34:27] things that was around our upbringing.
[1:34:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; So uh uh our whole life and and that is
[1:34:37] the thing that brought this thought of
[1:34:39] the uh uh uh house of hell to my mind.
[1:34:43] Amen.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Because our our condition was just like
[1:34:48] in the house of hell.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; And we seeing the word today. We seeing
[1:34:53] the things that is happening around us.
[1:34:55] And uh uh uh I mean uh the the the
[1:34:58] politics and and all of that that is
[1:35:01] going on. We just realize that uh you
[1:35:04] know the word is more becoming more
[1:35:07] becoming clearer as a house of hell.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[1:35:14] I'll take a little thought here uh uh
[1:35:19] uh
[1:35:21] from this message God provided away.
[1:35:23] This this is a comparison of of the
[1:35:26] eagle uh he's talking here. And the
[1:35:29] first thing uh you know he did just beat
[1:35:32] himself till his feather was was uh all
[1:35:37] out of him nearly. And he sat down like
[1:35:40] that and uh his weary eyes roll up
[1:35:44] looking around. And I thought, "Oh God,
[1:35:47] that's a heavenly bird."
[1:35:51] He saw in the heavens above and yet he
[1:35:55] is caught. Now he went over to a zoo and
[1:35:59] an eagle was put in a cage at a zoo and
[1:36:02] he's watching this bird trying to fly
[1:36:05] and every time it fly it hits uh you
[1:36:08] know the fence and then it comes back to
[1:36:10] the ground and he's uh feeling sorry
[1:36:12] that uh you know the bird is it supposed
[1:36:16] to be up there in the heavens and as I
[1:36:18] and as I and as I said that a thought
[1:36:21] just came to my mind something that uh I
[1:36:25] thought about as I because as I was
[1:36:27] traveling and I thought that I will I
[1:36:29] will I will say there maybe it will
[1:36:31] encourage somebody and uh you know
[1:36:36] uh I had a very tight trip as as I left
[1:36:40] almost missed my flight almost missed
[1:36:42] the one that will have brought me home
[1:36:44] this evening and uh uh
[1:36:50] but uh I realized
[1:36:53] uh that
[1:36:57] it is only God that can make up time.
[1:37:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; You know, the flight delays and the
[1:37:05] pilot says, "I'm sorry, we have a delay,
[1:37:09] but we will try to make up the time."
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I and as I thought
[1:37:16] about that, I realized that uh you know
[1:37:20] uh uh on uh on on on the land, you know,
[1:37:24] if you are driving or so uh because of
[1:37:27] the human trafficking, because of of of
[1:37:30] all the construction we have sometimes,
[1:37:34] you know, when you are back, you are
[1:37:35] really back. You know, you're trying to
[1:37:37] make up time, you get into the
[1:37:39] neighborhood, sometime it's worse.
[1:37:42] Sometime you're trying to get a bad pass
[1:37:44] is worse. It's completely different than
[1:37:47] when a plane is in the air.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; They have their own traffic. They have
[1:37:55] their, you know, their difficulties
[1:37:57] there. But it's much easier for a plane
[1:38:00] to make up time in the air
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; than a driver that is driving down on
[1:38:05] earth or driving on land. Let me say it
[1:38:08] that way. Because the plane is also in
[1:38:10] on earth. And uh so I I just thought
[1:38:13] about that you know I was I was really
[1:38:14] thinking about it in a way that uh I
[1:38:18] mean for us just like in our in our
[1:38:22] commune we kind of a struggle you
[1:38:24] running late you know you look at your
[1:38:26] time you say man I need to be there you
[1:38:28] try to speed too much the police might
[1:38:30] pull you over.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. the police might pull you over or
[1:38:37] uh you might get somebody that will cut
[1:38:39] before you and they are driving slow and
[1:38:42] I mean you are bumping they oh my god
[1:38:44] what this guy is doing you know when you
[1:38:47] look in all your mirrors trying to cut
[1:38:49] and go and then it it gives you some
[1:38:52] some level of frustration praise the
[1:38:54] lord
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; but it's it's uh it's it's completely
[1:38:58] different when that pilot gets up in up
[1:39:01] there I was I took a picture of the of
[1:39:04] the speed limit as the flight was going.
[1:39:08] Uh uh it says it says uh ground speed
[1:39:12] will be 600
[1:39:16] almost 650
[1:39:19] miles per hour.
[1:39:22] If he was driving on the ground that is
[1:39:24] how fast the plane is going. There is no
[1:39:27] car that drives like that. We don't have
[1:39:30] roads for that. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and and that is the reason
[1:39:36] why if for any reason a a plane lost
[1:39:41] control and hits the ground, it just
[1:39:43] explode because the speed is too much.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; It's going too fast.
[1:39:55] Can you imagine just going over
[1:39:57] continent?
[1:39:59] Amen.
[1:40:02] We were supposed to have about uh a 15
[1:40:07] hours flight from Atlanta over to
[1:40:10] Johannesburg and and and uh the the the
[1:40:13] pilot was able to make it uh about uh 14
[1:40:17] and a half hour.
[1:40:19] He have the heavens. He can go as fast
[1:40:22] as it is. And if you just compare that
[1:40:26] with our life, it's only in heavenly
[1:40:29] places that God make up,
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Our lost time.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know, and and you
[1:40:38] find that with with us as men, you know,
[1:40:41] uh uh uh you know, we we we we try to
[1:40:44] put certain things in place, you know,
[1:40:47] so we can rebuild our fan eyes, try to
[1:40:49] put certain thing in place so we can
[1:40:52] rebuild our life and uh uh uh thinking
[1:40:55] that oh well, you know, I I I wasted my
[1:40:58] time in this, I wasted my time after
[1:41:01] this, you know, I need to do this to
[1:41:03] catch up with that. But you realize that
[1:41:06] uh sometimes in doing all of that we we
[1:41:10] we we bring some sense of uh uh
[1:41:13] encouragement to ourself but it's
[1:41:15] difficult.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You realize that you you put a whole lot
[1:41:21] into it and as you are putting a lot
[1:41:24] into it, you also realize that you you
[1:41:26] you you are also putting your resources
[1:41:29] you are spending. It's not like that uh
[1:41:32] you know is giving you uh a direct
[1:41:35] return.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; So if you really think about it, it's
[1:41:40] only God
[1:41:43] that can be able
[1:41:50] to redeem our wasted time.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Only God can be able to redeem the time.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; So, just like he's saying here is that
[1:42:08] uh he thinks about this bird and is is
[1:42:11] caught uh and put in a cage. Oh, God.
[1:42:14] That's a heavenly bird. He saws in the
[1:42:16] heaven above. Yeah, he's caught.
[1:42:20] He fell into a trap. He's absolutely
[1:42:23] helpless. He can't deliver himself.
[1:42:27] His weary eyes rolled around. I felt so
[1:42:30] sorry for him. He can't help himself.
[1:42:34] And every man
[1:42:36] that fell into the snail of the devil is
[1:42:40] worse off than that bird.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you have to think about it.
[1:42:48] down is men that have caught the bird
[1:42:51] and put the bird in there for
[1:42:53] recreation.
[1:42:56] He want to create uh uh a natural place
[1:42:59] where people can come around and see why
[1:43:02] animals. You see a lion behind a fence.
[1:43:04] You see a leper. You also see an eagle.
[1:43:08] Man has created that. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:12] But he's uh he's letting us know that
[1:43:14] every man that falls into the snare of
[1:43:17] the devil
[1:43:19] is worse off than that bird
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; because
[1:43:25] we are God's children. We are heavenly
[1:43:27] beings.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; You are supposed to be a son of God.
[1:43:33] You are free brother. You got liberty in
[1:43:37] Christ Jesus. Believing God,
[1:43:40] loving God, living free from sin, living
[1:43:44] free from death. That's right. But how
[1:43:47] the devil has caught you and case you up
[1:43:51] with smoking, drinking, all kinds of
[1:43:53] immoral living and thinking you are
[1:43:57] popular. Now, now Yari said now the man
[1:44:02] that is in the snail of the devil, he
[1:44:05] actually don't feel the he don't feel
[1:44:08] the net. He don't feel the bond
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; to him. He's free.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; His owner cage is in him,
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; His cage is not around him.
[1:44:19] That bird cage is around him. Praise the
[1:44:23] Lord. If he breaks, if he find a way out
[1:44:26] of that cage, he can fly away. But for
[1:44:30] man, his owner cage is in him.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; It's in his spirit.
[1:44:40] Have you ever uh thought about it? Why
[1:44:44] science refer to our genes as cells?
[1:44:49] It pretty much have the same spelling as
[1:44:51] a cell. Somebody is in a cell.
[1:44:56] Are we together?
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:01] So this man that is that is that that
[1:45:04] that is made in the image of God are
[1:45:06] supposed to live as a son of God. And
[1:45:09] here said now he he's caught and he c
[1:45:12] himself up in smoking and drinking all
[1:45:14] kinds of immoral living thinking. He's
[1:45:17] popular thinking you are you are doing
[1:45:20] something. That's the most great
[1:45:23] horrible sight there is to see that poor
[1:45:27] ego beating his brain out nearly against
[1:45:30] the case trying trying to get free.
[1:45:34] And you are hopeless.
[1:45:36] You are helpless. Just as helpless as
[1:45:39] you can be unless somebody put forth a
[1:45:43] hand and open the cage. And I tell you
[1:45:46] tonight, Jesus Christ has done that.
[1:45:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has done that in calling
[1:45:52] you, open a cage to let you out.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; And we can say the snail is broken.
[1:46:01] [clears throat]
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; The snail is broken.
[1:46:07] Because uh our own cage like I said is
[1:46:11] all in our spirit. It's all in our mind.
[1:46:14] I mean uh we are caged in uh uh uh
[1:46:17] worries and fear and and uh I mean we
[1:46:20] are caged in habits and and and spirits
[1:46:23] that are all within our spirit man but
[1:46:27] we can say by the grace of God the snail
[1:46:30] is broken
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; and we have escaped.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; That's the joy that we have. I think
[1:46:35] that is the reason why we we want to use
[1:46:38] this time to express our gratitude to
[1:46:41] the Lord.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Because it is it is only him that could
[1:46:45] bring us out of our own our own cage.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; It's only him that could break those
[1:46:51] walls in our spirit.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like Paul says the middle wall of
[1:46:56] petition. He has he has led captivity
[1:46:59] captives. He has broken every spirit and
[1:47:02] we we can we can be able to express
[1:47:05] ourself back to our maker.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because the snail is
[1:47:10] broken and we have escaped.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Men use different thing to to snail
[1:47:17] themsel up. Like Abraham would tell us,
[1:47:19] he says, "Even even even wealth, money
[1:47:22] is a snail to them that have it and is a
[1:47:25] snail to those that don't have it."
[1:47:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; I mean, we can we can read all of that
[1:47:30] tonight. Uh uh and then just I just get
[1:47:33] bunch of quotes here. But that's that's
[1:47:35] not that's not the main thing I want to
[1:47:37] get to to you tonight. It's not a
[1:47:39] reading of cult. But just to realize
[1:47:42] that how God in his mercy, we would not
[1:47:45] be here tonight if it was not because of
[1:47:47] the mercy of God.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Just to be able to realize some of the
[1:47:51] things that God has brought us out of.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Some of the things that we can point to
[1:47:57] and say it was the Lord that did this.
[1:47:59] Amen.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; It is by the mercy of God.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Even the birth that we are breathing,
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; If it had not been the Lord that was on
[1:48:13] our side, amen.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; If it had not been the Lord
[1:48:20] that was on our side, that's what I want
[1:48:23] for us to think about today. uh tonight
[1:48:27] as we as we just reflect on everything
[1:48:31] uh things that might come to our mind
[1:48:33] that we went through this year that uh
[1:48:36] that were that were that that were
[1:48:38] difficult that were hard. I mean places
[1:48:41] that we have failed, you know, uh uh uh
[1:48:45] and I mean uh we thought we could have
[1:48:48] done better and we never did. Whatever
[1:48:51] it is, but here we are tonight. Praise
[1:48:54] the Lord. Here we are tonight about to
[1:48:57] close the book of 2025.
[1:49:02] We are about to close that book.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; In few minutes, this is 11:20. In in in
[1:49:11] about 40 minutes from now, we'll be in a
[1:49:14] brand new year.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And an entire year is
[1:49:22] about to close without noise.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; In 40 minutes from now, we will be in a
[1:49:30] brand new year.
[1:49:32] And all I want for us to do is to just
[1:49:36] reflect on how the Lord has been on our
[1:49:38] side.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's Israel say
[1:49:42] tonight, if it had not been the Lord
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; that was on our side,
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Can we be able to say
[1:49:50] that in our heart tonight? Can we be
[1:49:53] able to say that in our mind tonight? If
[1:49:55] it have not been the Lord that was on my
[1:49:57] side when this thing happened to me.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, not not not trying to use this
[1:50:04] night to to to promise God because every
[1:50:07] time we promise, we fail,
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; But to be able to use this night to
[1:50:13] appreciate him.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. that despite of our
[1:50:18] failure, his mercy
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; has been good to us.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Because many times people just think
[1:50:28] that that's that's what the the you know
[1:50:30] the the the the last service of the
[1:50:32] year. Oh God, uh you know, I will serve
[1:50:35] you better. And we make all of these
[1:50:36] promises, but I think it's it's time for
[1:50:39] us to just to just be able to reflect.
[1:50:42] If it had not been the Lord
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; that has been on our side, Praise the
[1:50:47] Lord.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe it is not something that that that
[1:50:51] just happened in 2025. Maybe the grace
[1:50:54] of God caught you couple of years back.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; That if God did not deliver you at that
[1:51:00] time, your 2025 will have not been what
[1:51:03] it was.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Even if you thought that it was
[1:51:06] glorious,
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; but sometime down in your in our life,
[1:51:13] he reached down his hands. Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; And he got our attention.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe we will have been loose. We have
[1:51:26] been on the run just you know just uh uh
[1:51:29] uh uh living our life
[1:51:32] by our own by the details of our mind
[1:51:35] and the desires of our heart.
[1:51:39] But the Lord
[1:51:42] by his mercy
[1:51:45] sometime caught our attention.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; For many of us uh you know that there by
[1:51:57] by his grace that have been that have
[1:51:59] been in the service of the Lord. We can
[1:52:01] we can look back to the to the day where
[1:52:03] where grace came in our path
[1:52:07] where the Lord grace came down in our
[1:52:10] path and we can still point back to that
[1:52:13] time if it had not been the Lord that
[1:52:16] was on our side. Praise the Lord.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I had not been the Lord, like
[1:52:22] I've always said uh with with with you
[1:52:25] know few that I've said about my own
[1:52:27] personal testimony. The very night I got
[1:52:30] saved was the very night that was going
[1:52:32] to be the night where I was I was going
[1:52:34] to I was going to experience being
[1:52:36] drunk. That's where that's what my
[1:52:38] friends wanted to do. It was just a
[1:52:39] birthday party. You know it was you know
[1:52:42] friends guys just putting you know
[1:52:44] birthday party. It was that very scene
[1:52:46] that I never forget about it. Amen. And
[1:52:50] I can say the snare was broken that
[1:52:52] night.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; And I escaped. Amen.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; And I escaped. Praise the Lord.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; The snare was broken that night and I
[1:53:02] escaped, you know, and and I can look
[1:53:05] back and say if it was not the Lord that
[1:53:08] was on my side. Praise the Lord.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; But just just uh uh you know uh uh stay
[1:53:14] stay in my teenage. I was away from home
[1:53:16] and and uh uh I mean I was not under my
[1:53:21] parents. Who know what that could have
[1:53:23] turned into? And I would tell you I
[1:53:25] would tell you tonight my friend good
[1:53:27] friend of mine we grew up together.
[1:53:31] Good friend of mine you know the guy
[1:53:33] that was organizing that party for me
[1:53:36] turned out to be a stone drunk.
[1:53:42] Every time I go home, I try to look for
[1:53:44] him and I was just here. He was here. He
[1:53:46] was here, you know. Uh and I mean uh uh
[1:53:50] but you know uh uh I can say that you
[1:53:54] know the Lord was on my side.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Because it was it was not my choice. It
[1:53:58] was not my making. It was just the mercy
[1:54:01] of God.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; So I mean we all can look down in our
[1:54:04] life. There's a place where we can look
[1:54:07] and say yeah I mean the Lord was not on
[1:54:10] my side
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; you know this could have turned out
[1:54:14] completely different and that's what I
[1:54:16] want for us to do tonight in this first
[1:54:18] part of the service uh uh uh the
[1:54:21] musicians will come we will just bow our
[1:54:23] hands and you know we will we will do
[1:54:26] some reflection in appreciating the Lord

[1:54:36] of the Lord who made the heaven and the
[1:54:39] earth. Amen. He's the one that help us.
[1:54:41] He's the one that deliver us. If now we
[1:54:44] will have been in the house of hell.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[2:01:33] upon his word.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; You know, actually in some sense of
[2:01:38] five,
[2:01:40] it was not at all time that we really
[2:01:43] trusted in the Lord.
[2:01:46] At many times we we we dare thing we
[2:01:49] deal with things by ourselves.
[2:01:52] It was not in every time that we really
[2:01:55] really trusted in the Lord.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; But yet
[2:02:00] there were times we make wrong choices.
[2:02:04] There were time we approach things
[2:02:06] wrong. We say the wrong thing.
[2:02:09] But yet God in his mercy,
[2:02:13] God, the God that is rich in mercy,
[2:02:18] he stayed uh he still brought us out of
[2:02:22] it.
[2:02:23] Sometimes our wrong choices could have
[2:02:26] end up end us. [snorts]
[2:02:32] But God that was rich in mercy if he had
[2:02:35] not been the Lord. David never said if
[2:02:38] it had not been me. David never said
[2:02:41] because I trusted in the Lord. But if it
[2:02:44] had not been the Lord who was on our
[2:02:48] side,
[2:02:57] the Lord has been so good to us people.
[2:03:01] The Lord has been so good to us. He been
[2:03:04] so gracious to us.
[2:03:07] He's been uh

[2:03:55] And through [singing] it all,

[2:22:51] we will never never fully understand
[2:22:55] that we will never comprehend. That God
[2:22:58] can look beyond all of our faults, all

[2:23:08] Trying to draw us closer to him by his

[2:23:46] take time to be able to really express
[2:23:49] ourself and and thank God and express
[2:23:52] our gratitude to God. We just get in a

[2:24:14] if it was not because of the grace of
