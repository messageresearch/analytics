[0:00] [Music]
[2:59] the Lord bless you friends thank you and
[3:01] you'll be seated just a
[3:02] [Music]
[3:05] moment it always makes me feel good to
[3:09] to feel
[3:10] welcome uh that's kind of a I'm a
[3:14] Kentuckian myself you know and I I like
[3:17] to hear that making you
[3:20] welcome and uh such a nice welcome to
[3:25] this city and among you my Christian
[3:27] friends certainly makes me feel grateful
[3:29] to you
[3:30] Always by Brother Rogers I I love him
[3:34] he's been a wonderful little brother to
[3:36] me and how he's certainly been a real
[3:39] tool in God's hand here in Owensboro I
[3:42] just looking across the street there
[3:43] where you're going to build a new church
[3:45] or something over there that he was
[3:46] telling me about this morning at The
[3:48] Breakfast Table and that's wonderful see
[3:50] you you progress like that that's just
[3:55] show that you're you're backing up the
[3:58] right thing and God servant is um trying
[4:01] his best to give the best he can to
[4:02] God's people i' ever congregation
[4:06] appreciate a pastor like that that to
[4:08] see what your finances your ties your
[4:11] offerings and so forth you are he going
[4:13] straight into the kingdom of God to EMB
[4:16] better the kingdom of God make a better
[4:18] place not for himself for you he he's
[4:21] got the sheep on his mind the shepherd
[4:23] always has while in Palestine over in
[4:28] the oran rather I often wondered on the
[4:31] parable of the Bible The Parables rather
[4:35] of the Bible what some other them men
[4:38] and um you almost have to go into the
[4:41] orance to find out what this bible
[4:43] really means once I I've sat down and
[4:47] many of us as as Western ministers has
[4:50] um pondered over the thought what did
[4:52] they mean by this what did this mean and
[4:54] what did that mean and if you ever go to
[4:57] the Eastern country and see their un
[5:00] changing uh habits well then you find
[5:04] out more about the Bible it become a new
[5:06] book to me after I went to the east for
[5:09] instance like Jesus said I believe in St
[5:12] John 10 I think I am the door to the
[5:16] sheeple I am the door to the Sheep pole
[5:19] I often wonder how that that meant that
[5:21] he stood at the gate and received all
[5:23] the people as you come in or I thought
[5:25] maybe the shepherd stood and number the
[5:26] Sheep when they come in like that that's
[5:29] I used used to think that and perhaps
[5:31] many of you my brethren and clergymen
[5:33] have thought the same thing but once
[5:36] there you find out that there it's a
[5:39] difference it isn't U the numbering of
[5:42] the sheep but the shepherd himself
[5:45] becomes the door there's a crowd like a
[5:49] place of a shelter over and um he brings
[5:52] in all the sheep and PS in in there then
[5:54] he goes and lays down across the door
[5:58] and the Sheep are the wolf can't come in
[6:00] or the Sheep go out without crossing the
[6:04] shepherd isn't that wonderful see he is
[6:08] the door to the Sheep Bowl see nothing
[6:12] can come to the Sheep unless the
[6:15] shepherd permits it and if we got the
[6:18] shepherd at the door how secure and and
[6:21] happy should we be Satan can't touch it
[6:25] unless the shepherd permits it and it's
[6:26] all for the good whatever it has to be
[6:29] see what I
[6:30] mean that's when you said I noticed
[6:33] again and the
[6:35] Shepherd in this country Shepherd
[6:37] doesn't mean very much that well it's
[6:39] some ancient word but over there a
[6:42] Shepherd oh my and sheep the people live
[6:45] by their sheep and the shepherd um takes
[6:49] care of them one time while going to the
[6:53] country I noticed in the Far East of U
[6:58] of the little in India how that they had
[7:03] a Shepherd came down and was bringing
[7:07] his
[7:08] sheep and he thought that Parable there
[7:12] where he said my sheep know my
[7:15] voice a stranger they will not follow
[7:19] now that sheep was born under the
[7:21] tutorship of this Shepherd he learns
[7:25] that voice he'll never pay attention to
[7:27] anybody else's voice he learns that
[7:29] Shepherd's voice another Shepherd might
[7:32] call they might do whatever they want to
[7:34] but there's some little something about
[7:36] that Shepherd that the Sheep
[7:40] recognizes see that's the way it is with
[7:42] God's
[7:43] sheep strange voices they it just don't
[7:48] sound right they just won't go that's
[7:50] all and a sheep can be tempted but when
[7:54] it finds out that it's the wrong
[7:56] Shepherd he'll turn away and I know
[7:59] notice how the Sheep follow the example
[8:02] of the
[8:03] shepherd coming down through the street
[8:06] where there's a little narrow streets
[8:08] the streets in the Eastern countries
[8:09] there were made in the days of Chariots
[8:11] when they had the Chariots that went
[8:12] through the street and horse riders and
[8:15] they're very narrow very seldom you find
[8:17] one as wide as that post there very
[8:19] seldom sometime maybe all 12 ft wide the
[8:23] street M the of the like in Oslo Norway
[8:28] the street there is only about 8T across
[8:30] in The Old City it's around, 1600 years
[8:33] old and then you find out they didn't
[8:36] have automobiles in this Modern Age
[8:38] where they Shuffle and jostle through
[8:40] the Broadways see naam called them
[8:44] Broadways and they standing on the Outer
[8:46] Drive in Chicago I thought of that many
[8:48] times how that a three and four breast
[8:50] on each way the Broadways and the
[8:52] elevation of the separation of the
[8:53] streets in the middle out they press the
[8:55] button in the place and for several
[8:56] miles a rail rise up like this to
[8:59] separate your traffic at different times
[9:01] of the evening and at different times of
[9:02] the
[9:03] day Broadways in that days one of those
[9:06] Lanes would have been a complete
[9:08] highway but seeing this Shepherd come
[9:12] down through the city it was a it was
[9:14] alarming there come a whole string of
[9:17] sheep po me now the easterners put all
[9:21] their dainties out on the street even
[9:23] their meats and everything else lays on
[9:25] the street and all their fruit and their
[9:27] Pro produce lays that on the stre feet
[9:29] just right here's the store like said
[9:31] they keep their stuff back in there but
[9:33] you buy right off the side of the wall
[9:36] and there's no sidew walk it's just a
[9:38] street so everybody walks right in the
[9:40] street just right down the street the
[9:42] cobblestone street and here come a
[9:44] Shepherd down the street walking walking
[9:47] along and behind him a string of sheep a
[9:50] city block long and them sheep walking
[9:53] right by the produce and things and
[9:55] wouldn't turn right or left they kept
[9:57] their eyes on the shepherd moving right
[10:00] on through I thought oh
[10:02] god what the shepherd
[10:05] mean not look right or left not be
[10:08] tempted by this or that but walk in the
[10:10] footsteps of the shepherd they want to
[10:12] follow the shepherd I noticed one day
[10:15] while we were in a little British Jeep
[10:17] riding around there's a Shepherd had a
[10:19] whole lot of animals up on the hill
[10:21] there he was feeding them they were
[10:23] leading them and taking them places and
[10:26] in there he had sheep in there he had
[10:28] goats in there he had mules had camels
[10:32] everything he was feeding them all it
[10:34] was all grazing the shepherd was
[10:35] watching him I said my shepherd here
[10:38] means many I said a Shepherd is a grazer
[10:41] but said you know the strange thing it
[10:44] is Mr Brandon he said when night time
[10:47] comes you watch that all those sheep go
[10:51] right straight to the shepherd said the
[10:54] mules will stay out in the
[10:55] pasture and said the camels will stay
[10:58] out in the pasture
[11:00] but said and the goats will stay out in
[11:01] the pasture but said the Sheep all come
[11:05] straight to the shepherd when he comes
[11:06] night time why said because the Sheep
[11:09] are putt up at
[11:11] night and kept
[11:14] safe I said Mr don't talk like that
[11:17] you'll make me start shouting right here
[11:19] in the middle of the road night times
[11:21] are coming many are grazing on the same
[11:23] thing but only the Sheep will he
[11:26] recognize see what I mean just the Sheep
[11:30] the Born
[11:31] Again many are called to your
[11:36] chosen or I love him today don't
[11:38] you let us speak to him now before we
[11:41] open his word our heavenly father we
[11:45] come to thee on this sabbath
[11:48] day raining on the outside may we might
[11:51] call it Gloom hazy rainy weather but how
[11:56] could the farmer put in these crops if
[11:58] we didn't have have much moisture this
[12:01] spring there be no through food raised
[12:05] ground would be dry people would
[12:08] Parish we realize that this is like
[12:11] experience of a Christian sometimes we
[12:14] have to go through terrible chastisement
[12:17] chasing of the
[12:19] Lord many things to correct us that
[12:21] we'll be fruit bearing
[12:23] Christan sometimes has to prun is cut
[12:26] off take away take out of her hand
[12:30] and we think sometime oh God what are
[12:32] you doing to us but he knows what he's
[12:36] doing so we pray father that today that
[12:39] you'll prune every one of
[12:41] us from the least to the greatest of
[12:45] Pastor God we pray that you'll prune
[12:48] every one of us take away all that's
[12:51] unlike you father take away the thing
[12:53] that's hindering us from being fruit
[12:55] bearing
[12:56] Christians the day coming when it's go
[12:59] to get dark then we want to go into the
[13:02] Sheep fow we want to be sheep today
[13:05] Father we want to follow exactly in the
[13:07] footsteps of the shepherd He gave us his
[13:11] example said I come not to do my will
[13:14] but the will of him that sent me may
[13:16] that be our motive today God to do the
[13:19] will of God who has saved us bless the
[13:22] church today in the Sunday School

[13:26] world and remember us Lord this little

[13:47] Amen in these Services a visiting with
[13:51] brother Rogers which is always a great
[13:55] uh privilege to come and to meet with
[13:57] brother Rogers and you dear saintly
[14:00] people here in other churches through
[14:03] Owensboro and the cities around about
[14:06] I've learn this that no matter if he's
[14:08] Chinese Japan Korean German whatever he
[14:11] is as long as he's a brother or she's a
[14:14] sister there's not a bit of difference
[14:16] than him they're just all sheep of the
[14:18] Same
[14:20] Soul watching it through the different
[14:22] nations throughout the world have come
[14:25] this you get into a communistic country
[14:27] where have had to be have had to have
[14:29] people with rifles to keep the crowds
[14:32] back and I've had to have people that
[14:34] would soldiers that I had to duck my
[14:35] head down and Mill around me to keep
[14:37] them getting shot till they get me out
[14:39] into somewhere into the darkness where
[14:41] they couldn't see to shoot me at and
[14:43] things like that preaching the gospel
[14:46] bringing Good Tidings of great joy of
[14:48] the Lord Jesus Christ and then it's it's
[14:51] marvelous to know that Jesus in the
[14:53] midst of all of that it just as sweet
[14:55] and good dear just there's nothing
[14:58] alarming about it just taking a message
[15:01] and today it's our privilege to be here
[15:05] with you and at the sports center this
[15:06] afternoon or this evening or other for
[15:09] the service we pray that you'll all find
[15:11] a place if your own church is not having
[15:14] service while be out to visit with us
[15:17] and we'd be glad to do all that we can
[15:19] to help you to make burdens a little
[15:21] lighter make the community a little
[15:23] better place to do right a little easier
[15:25] and a harder place to do wrong that's
[15:28] what the the meetings are
[15:30] intended now today as we're just going
[15:34] to speak a little I have a a
[15:37] very bad voice and and I'm I got a
[15:41] vision in my heart and I thought this
[15:44] morning it's Sunday school just before
[15:46] the uh the coming forth of the preaching
[15:49] this afternoon and if God willing today
[15:53] this afternoon I want to speak on a very
[15:57] uh or this evening rather a very
[15:59] uh
[16:01] outstanding uh scriptures concerning the
[16:04] time that we're
[16:05] living and I believe but God's help the
[16:09] subject I probably will approach you
[16:10] from a different way than the first one
[16:13] of the first messages I preached after
[16:15] the great visitation of the Holy Spirit
[16:17] a few weeks ago and I thought being that
[16:21] we were together this morning just as a
[16:23] little group of Christians here that we
[16:26] would talk just Heart to Heart heart
[16:29] with one another a while and I know that
[16:31] down in every man's heart there's
[16:33] something that yearns to see the
[16:37] supernal here not long ago I was sitting
[16:40] in California in a meeting wearing a
[16:43] hair piece on top of my head and wearing
[16:47] a pair of dark glasses just to listen at
[16:50] a Brother's
[16:51] theology because they'd recognize me if
[16:54] it
[16:55] wasn't I sat with people right next to
[16:58] them and they didn't even
[17:00] home just sitting there just see looking
[17:03] around you even hear him talk about me
[17:05] they didn't know it was me just sat
[17:07] there and I happened to be sitting by a
[17:09] man with his collar turned around there
[17:12] was a minister come to the platform and
[17:15] the man's one of my converts to Divine
[17:17] Healing but he he'd preach a while then
[17:21] he'd go back and a violet would change
[17:23] his clothes when he get a little sweaty
[17:25] and come back out again on the platform
[17:27] and this great man sitting there shaking
[17:29] his
[17:31] head he looked over me he said does that
[17:33] act like a servant of Christ I said I am
[17:36] not the
[17:37] judge I said he said uh well I said I
[17:41] think his message is
[17:43] wonderful he said um are you a Christian
[17:46] I said yes sir I am and he said um well
[17:50] he said do you think a servant of Christ
[17:52] should just put on a whole lot like that
[17:54] and dress like that and act like that
[17:57] and
[17:59] I said wello you see to my opinion God
[18:01] has people in different categories to
[18:03] catch people that live in different
[18:06] categories he talking about said Bo the
[18:08] man has two elvado every year I said I'm
[18:12] very thankful that God's that good to
[18:13] him see and uh but he looked down at me
[18:17] kind of strange and he said um are you a
[18:22] Christian I said I'm a minister he said
[18:25] uh my name is so and so and I said my
[18:27] name is Brandon
[18:29] he said you wouldn't have to be the
[18:30] Brandon
[18:32] that pra for the sick I said yes sir oh
[18:37] he said I see you can see why I taken up
[18:40] this other
[18:41] brother and he said um Mr
[18:44] Brandon he said uh aren't you a Baptist
[18:47] I said I why yes sir he said I want to
[18:51] ask you something he
[18:53] said I am a certain doctor of Theology
[18:58] and a certain Church well a
[19:01] presbyterian and he said you know what
[19:03] on this West Coast CH he said we
[19:07] Presbyterian people had the entire Coast
[19:09] seed down that we had the biggest
[19:11] churches the finest Congregation of any
[19:14] churches on the west coast and said you
[19:16] know what broke us up I said no sir he
[19:20] said that c Christian Science come in
[19:23] and broke up our church and said now
[19:27] this Pentecostal groups coming coming in
[19:29] and breaking up Christian Science and
[19:32] everything I said
[19:35] mhm I said Doctor do you know hungry
[19:39] children leap from a garbage
[19:41] can if they're
[19:44] hungry said well I guess that's right I
[19:47] said if you
[19:49] Presbyterians as you said you were if
[19:52] you would have stayed with the word of
[19:54] God and give the children the bread of
[19:56] life that cult would have never broken
[19:58] up I said you just lay down that's all
[20:02] and I said people are still people and
[20:05] there every man is trying to look beyond
[20:07] the curtains he's trying to see where he
[20:09] come from and where he went to and if
[20:12] the Church of the Living God won't
[20:14] produce it then the devil will rise up
[20:16] some Cults to give him some false things
[20:18] I said therefore you ought to stay with
[20:20] the word of God they' all been
[20:21] Presbyterians and that's right truly
[20:25] that's the way I think generally the
[20:27] feeling of people are
[20:29] now I want to read a little text of
[20:32] scripture here and um maybe the Lord add
[20:37] His blessings to it and I'll lay my
[20:38] watch out because I know your Sunday
[20:40] School classes will be adjourning pretty
[20:41] soon and we have some after service now
[20:44] I thought I'd just talk to you just just
[20:46] Heart to Heart a little bit this morning
[20:48] in the Sunday School lesson and we find
[20:51] this just across the page from where I
[20:53] preached last night from Second Kings
[20:56] this is second king 5th now listen at
[20:59] the fourth
[21:00] verse and it was so when Elijah the man
[21:05] of God heard that the king of Israel had
[21:08] rent his
[21:09] clothes he sent unto the king and said
[21:14] will you rich your clothes come to me
[21:16] and know there is a prophet in
[21:21] Israel
[21:22] now the thing we want to talk on this
[21:25] morning for a little while is the super
[21:30] Supernatural we're all hungry for
[21:32] Supernatural you Methodist Brethren are
[21:34] hungry for
[21:35] Supernatural I got a Methodist preacher
[21:38] with me that's hungering and thirsting
[21:39] for the supernatural you Baptists are
[21:42] hungering and thirsting for Supernatural
[21:44] oh lovely Mar now surely if God is still
[21:49] God he's still Supernatural don't you
[21:52] believe that he's got to be now we're
[21:55] trying to place God in some prehistoric
[21:58] or some historical God but what good
[22:01] does a historical God do today what
[22:04] benefit is the god of Elijah to a man
[22:06] today if he isn't the same
[22:09] God what are you learning about him in
[22:11] the Seminary if he was some historical
[22:15] fact or not the same today you'd be
[22:16] better to learn agriculture or something
[22:18] something would help
[22:19] somebody is that
[22:22] right you'd be better off if you learned
[22:24] to your children to be an architect
[22:26] instead of a minister if he's a
[22:28] historical God and not the same today
[22:30] what good does the god of Moses do if he
[22:33] isn't the same God
[22:35] today just reason that in your minds
[22:39] now we are so in so always concerned
[22:45] about our
[22:47] experiences a little lady told me last
[22:50] night which is in our
[22:52] midst a preacher of a certain great
[22:56] denomination
[22:57] Church and I asked her did her father
[23:00] ever Pastor so and so and she said
[23:03] brother Brandon my father only had uh uh
[23:09] grammar school education therefore they
[23:12] would not permit him in bigger churches
[23:14] because his education was too poorly
[23:18] perhaps a fine spirit filled man but the
[23:22] organization would not promote him no
[23:24] matter how spirit filled he was because
[23:26] of uh inadequate educ
[23:29] ation there they miss
[23:32] God Peter couldn't even sign his own
[23:36] name and he had the keys to the kingdom
[23:39] of God given to him by Jesus
[23:41] Christ we're looking to
[23:44] education education's fine but that's
[23:47] taught in school houses the church is a
[23:50] place to know of God and learn of God
[23:53] and in the
[23:55] Supernatural and God is a supernatural
[23:58] and the same yesterday today and forever
[24:01] now we want to to see and place this
[24:04] before our our audience that that God
[24:07] still is the same that he ever was the
[24:10] people gets away from God but God
[24:13] Remains the Same his his nature and his
[24:17] power and his desire is always the same
[24:21] through every generation it ever changes
[24:23] it's always the same it's the people
[24:25] that gets away from God and not God from
[24:28] the people they lose their faith God
[24:30] covers all space all everywhere he's
[24:33] omnipresent so he's everywhere and he's
[24:36] always has been everywhere and he always
[24:39] will be everywhere but it's the attitude
[24:42] of the people that brings the result
[24:45] that's the reason at Pentecost they had
[24:47] to go to an upper room and pray until
[24:49] the Holy Ghost came because they got in
[24:51] one place and one ACC
[24:53] card it's the atmosphere what brings the
[24:57] result
[24:59] you believe that let every man and woman
[25:02] in this building this morning boy or
[25:04] girl get everything from their mind but
[25:07] the Lord Jesus and believe that he's
[25:08] standing present right now and you'll
[25:10] see something happen to the Call's
[25:11] headlines and newspaper in the
[25:13] morning right it's
[25:16] atmosphere I don't believe in joking
[25:18] from the pull pit because the pull Pit's
[25:20] no place to joke it's a sacred place I'm
[25:24] quoting something just for this here Mr
[25:26] BOS were very good sense of humor and he
[25:30] said brother Brandon to prove that it's
[25:32] atmosphere said you could take a hen egg
[25:34] and put it on under a puppy and tie him
[25:36] down and it would hatch a chicken see
[25:39] it's a warmth of the puppy's body that
[25:42] would hatch the egg it don't have to be
[25:44] under the hen it can be under the puppy
[25:46] it could be in the incubator it's the
[25:50] atmosphere and it's the atmosphere that
[25:53] brings the miraculous and wonders and
[25:56] powers of God Among the people it's the
[25:58] atmosphere of the people and when people
[26:01] get to a place they're reasoning and
[26:03] wandering and steing and thinking and
[26:05] all tore up don't know where they do
[26:07] stand half of not even scripturally
[26:09] taught how can you expect the atmosphere
[26:11] to be
[26:12] right you can't do it it won't be
[26:15] like it's got to be in one accard one
[26:18] place and settle down with one motive
[26:21] one thing then you're going to see
[26:23] something
[26:25] happen it don't only work that but if
[26:27] you look at it in the scientific World
[26:30] say you're all a bunch of salesman and
[26:31] we're going to sell chiet or Pontiacs or
[26:34] some kind of a car and one in his heart
[26:36] really thinks the stud Bakers are better
[26:38] and so forth like that get us all the
[26:40] the Buick is the best and the other some
[26:41] of the car get us together like that you
[26:43] can never have a right kind of
[26:46] need take it in the devil's word go over
[26:50] and say we're going to a dance one man
[26:52] standing up and saying well now he he
[26:54] don't know about where he wants to dance
[26:56] or not and this girl over and she is
[26:58] thatting the music sing near my God to
[27:01] thee L an atmosphere for a dance well
[27:04] that's not any different and want a lot
[27:06] of atmosphere you going into to church
[27:08] for a service of
[27:10] God just that
[27:13] contrary
[27:14] right the only thing to bring the right
[27:17] atmosphere then for the dancers to put
[27:19] on their
[27:19] old music that Mak dances and everybody
[27:23] gets thinking what a good time they're
[27:24] going to have dancing and so forth and
[27:26] they'll be having their big hoop up in
[27:27] town
[27:29] put the right kind of a music on the
[27:31] Pian the Oregon and everybody in the
[27:33] atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there
[27:35] and go to meet everything that they had
[27:36] me up something will go taken
[27:39] place
[27:42] atmosphere but that's the hardest thing
[27:45] there is to
[27:46] do and that is to get people in that
[27:49] atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the
[27:51] atmosphere of believing and that's the
[27:54] reason sometimes a Divine Life that's
[27:56] been called and set aside
[27:58] has become a fanatic or crazy or or
[28:02] Mystic or something to the eyes of the
[28:04] general public is because you're
[28:06] considered a a
[28:09] a a I'd say an erotic or a insane person
[28:14] is because that you have changed your
[28:17] Dwelling Place got into a different
[28:21] atmosphere and your one motive your one
[28:23] thought is to stay in that atmosphere
[28:26] and any person that ever come into that
[28:27] atmosph
[28:28] one time I'll never be satisfied nowhere
[28:32] [Music]
[28:34] else and that's why I believe that we
[28:37] should have our churches under control
[28:39] by the holy ghost that men and women in
[28:42] their work and wherever they should be
[28:43] should continually desire and they will
[28:47] if they've ever once come into that
[28:48] atmosphere
[28:56] [Music]
