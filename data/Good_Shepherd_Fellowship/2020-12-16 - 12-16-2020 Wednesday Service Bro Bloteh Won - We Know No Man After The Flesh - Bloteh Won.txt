lord and the grace that he gave us every day and once again we want to extend our deepest temperature to broad scat sister naomi we pray that the lord will be able to strengthen you in such a time praise the lord and when this time comes around it it brings it brings every one of us like solomon said it's better to go to the house of mourning praise the lord because when the person is remembering their loss like they it also brings you to the place we that lost loved ones it brings that memory to us again amen and then we remember all the departed souls so we pray that the lord will be able to strengthen you in such a time like this praise the lord amen amen and i had a i don't know if i would make this work tonight but uh the lord bless you musicians you can take your seat and then uh we will we will see if we can trust the law to be able to look into the word of the lord but before we we we get into the scripture we want to read tonight in and as i said over in isaiah chapter 40 i want us to just uh turn there tonight i will have actually taught to make this a message to speak speak on but uh i will just uh take few verses from there just to be able to encourage us and then we we stand for the reading of the word and then we go into what we want to look at tonight if the lord will just uh be able to help us praise the lord okay you're already standing so then we will use this for the reading of the scripture then isaiah chapter 40 let's read verse one comfort ye comfort ye my people say your god speak here comfortably to jerusalem and cried unto her that her welfare is accomplished and her iniquity is pardoned for she have received of the lord of the lord's hand double for all her sins the voice of him that cried in the wilderness prepared here the word of the lord make straight in the desert a high wing for our god the lord bless you you can have your seed praise the lord this is uh uh very familiar scripture that we that we know and uh as as we have uh said you know well as young people we just did the message you get that we have to read and fellowship around we it's in reading through uh saint john chapter 14 in 15 and 16 it speaks a lot about the comforter praise the lord amen and there that's tied in with the spirit of truth god is the one that brings truth comfort a strange year that god is is bringing uh comfort to jerusalem and in a way that is completely different from the way that that man would bring comfort amen and and in a way that sometimes we we try to comfort ourselves or come for one another uh it's a way that sometimes we we try to uh uh either uh you know sympathize for the situation that the person might be in god here is bringing a comfort to jerusalem in a very different way by sending them a voice of one crying in the wilderness praise the lord but this is actually now where my thought is on on this chapter my thought is actually to the last few verses of isaiah chapter 40 14. and i just want to do uh uh a little a little thing here i wish i had a hearty uh uh kind of uh drone out in the picture yeah so so you it can be able to grab your mind but you will realize as god is talking to israel this waiting sin and announcing a forerunner that we come before the the messiah before our lord jesus we know that john the baptist ministry fit right in there so he was supposed to be a comforter to the people in a way that god was going to comfort jerusalem every valley will be exalted in every mountains you know and and and like brother branham says the people might have been looking at the the physical valley and mountains but you know uh uh uh john the baptist was going to bring a message you know that we condemn the corrupt leaders of that day and the people that have exalted himself with proud and and herald and herodotus and all the things that they were doing he would bring a message that would speak to them and you can read down and read the entire chapter but as he closes the chapter he closed it with a very beautiful beautiful writing that caught my attention and i want to speak on that a little bit then we go into our subject for tonight he says here as we get down to the last few verses in the chapter verse 27 why sarah there oh jacob and speaketh o israel my my weight is here from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god praise the lord have thou not known have that not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainted net i want you to underline that were fainted in your mind neither is wearing also on the line the word wear it in your mind there is no searching of his understanding amen the lord the everlasting god the creator of the ends of the earth he faint ned and he is not weary he gave a power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be wary and a young man shall all shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagle eagles they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not faint amen praise the lord amen praise the lord i got a christmas gift here a big prank bible so i'm just enjoying myself amen now now uh what what i want us to look at here you you we have to realize that as i one time he says you know this is the way walking in it don't turn to the right if you want to turn to the left as i have such a style of writing if you go back in and read the history of azai a little bit you have to know that this was a man that was framed to the king yuzir you know they were they were all friends so it kind of show us a little bit that alzheimer uh uh he had he has some privilege and uh and he gave him to the place where he he was he was inspired the kind of a grace and gift that he had it made him to write in such a way that i mean when you read his writing it's almost like just like reading a psalm he had he had a special way of writing but i want for us to look a few things here that he lay out in this reading that we have just read he talks about the way of a man when a man is born on a child is born that child with it in the hands of the mother and after the while the child starts to walk and after the wide the child starts to run and after the white the child stands to fly praise the lord these are different stages and as i was reading this and and studying it i could not help but look at the four anointing that have gathered the church you know you can t take the waiting anointing axe the ox bearer you know the ox he's the burden bearer he's there he knows how to bed and that's that's uh uh uh and and and uh uh the the anointing of the man he walks in a walk with god and uh uh the anointing of a lion he runs you know no one can run faster than the lion when he gets out there to get his prey and the anointing of the ego he flies praise the lord so right in this little little thing that isaiah is speaking here to israel after telling them about the account of comfort that would come to them he's he's he's he's speaking to them uh have you not known this god the one that you have to deal with it's not a god that you have made by your hands it's a god that has made you praise the lord amen and this god he do not faint he do not worry praise the lord the one that we have to deal with that's the kind of god and there is no searching you know of his understanding the more we read his word the more we get to know about him praise the lord and the more we get to love him praise the lord and so you see here and and and there is a way that you can also apply this as you look at it uh in my little sketch here i have uh like like like he says here he says but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall man up with wings as an ego the eagles fly amen they shall run and that be wary you know a man's that run if you run and then just run by yourself and run and run and run you will get weary amen you will lose strength and pretty soon you go praise the lord hallelujah and i mean you can go for walk and uh uh and you know walk and walk shut the mice and you know and then you also faint i mean you get you get tired so that but there is something that is hidden here and uh the bible talk about inner that walk with god and he was not the bible also speaks about elijah you remember when elijah told ahab run because i can hear the sound of the abundance of rain and the bible says there was the cloud was moving in the heavens in the form of a man's hand and then uh and and they have got on his character and and and he starts to run and he and uh but elijah didn't have a child but yet elijah could run more faster than they have praise the lord amen and uh one of these days you know we sing the song i fly away to glory amen that's our promise so we see all of these steps of life i want you to follow me here kind of for speaking in in in a kind of a proverb way to you tonight all of these stages of life let me take another example brother branham says emergency causes desperation he says if there was an emergency that should come here tonight we will get desperate and there are things that you will know you will you will see or realize of yourself that you never knew amen and how fast you can run how you know how quick you can jump in and all of those things and and and all of those things i aim the ability of men praise the lord amen to walk to run in one of these days to fly amen man uh learning all of these things and you know and things that is there but there is a secret year and you think about all the men that give their lives and and and religion that also teaches men to to give their lives uh for some kind of a reward amen and if if if we ever get to the place where our faith is put to the test whether we would die for the lord or denied our faith i believe that by god's grace we would die for the word amen praise the lord i believe that we have that hope in our heart you know so we can do all of these things but there is one secret year that is bringing to us the secret is they that wait on the lord praise the lord christian faith many christians have done work for christ and the people will wear their t-shirt and they will walk the walk mass and walk mass and then it can do a run for jesus and it will all run one of the things that challenge our faith is to wait praise the lord if we should pro plan to do a work for christ we always show up and we'll be ready we get our water bottle and everything but they that wait on the lord they that wait on the lord and you see the way that isaiah wrote this thing he put the secret of not being weary in weight he put the secret of not fainting in weight he put the secret of being able to fly in wait they that wait on the lord and if you can wait on god you will run and you will get weary if you can wait on god you will walk and one of these days you will throw in the towel praise the lord well is that just my own personal devotion i'm sharing with you it's uh it was it was a kind of a unique way to be able to look at what the prophet was writing is it really caught my attention it really really caught my attention and there with me in a different way and i hope it do the same to you praise the lord amen amen they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength teach us to wait amen teach us to wait may god teach us to wait may god teach us to wait i have to remember bill blam says god is not in a hurry he's not in a hurry if you if you don't have that grace to just wait on god and i mean we want things to happen you know we want the rapture to come we want god to fulfill things in our life but the secret is in waiting praise the lord may he teach us to wait amen wait wait for the lord in prayer with for the lord and sons wait for the lord in the way that we live and all of the earth okay so let's just go to the world tonight this is just my little thing i wanted to share with you in a way that it blesses my heart you know and and you can you can look in that scripture and if the lord give grace you can be able to see things beautiful that i didn't even i never even saw there but it was it was just a blessing to to see how he staged all of those things wait walk run and fly but it all starts from weight praise lord amen sunday we were speaking on the end of all flesh is calm and uh tonight as lord we trust the law to be our help we will continue and try to just wrap up what what our inspiration was on we were talking about the sea principle and uh uh let's let's just read take your bible second corinthians chapter five that was what we read on uh on sunday let's just read this i want to i want to take from there i know i have just a little bit of time here pray that the lord will just help amen second corinthians chapter five we took verse 16. wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh ye dog we have known christ after the flesh yet noun henceforth nor we him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new amen now so we will take that and and and brother branham speaks here in the message uh christ is the mystery of god revealed he says the the new birth it's a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and and that's a new birth now what you are going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is specifically in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same action the same thing that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position praise the lord that's what he said in the revelation revelation series if the church knew her position amen he says if the church only knew his position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is what the church is what is the church what is this church that's been redeemed by the blood of the lamb it's not the name tags that we call ourself this church is the bride of jesus christ amen this church is the lamb's wife this church is the one that is flesh of his flesh amen just like when god gave adam his wife was flesh of his flesh and born of his bone spirit of his spirit that's what the church is now if the church only knows its position it will warn day now you have to remember now this is christ it's the mystery of god reveal what is the position of the church to christ what is her place is to give him the preeminence amen is to give him the preeminence it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is praise the lord amen you just think about esther in the kingdom praise the lord all that mother kind was trying to do is to help esther know her position praise the lord now you have to realize that she was a jewish girl that got married to this gentile king there is a way of word uh uh it's it's easy for her to feel a little bit uh you know um uh inferior for how to feel you know a kind of a complex praise the lord uncle molokai encourager and and you know uh for her to go down there and and become one of those virgins to become a bride and and yes the king has married her and she's in the kingdom but they will just stay this place word she feels like uh i mean she's uh just like a stranger and all of these things going through her mind mother cat is encouraging her trying to help her to realize for her to find her place for her to be able to know who she is as long as she would have stayed in a kind of a mindset that she had at a time where the jews were were on a persecution like mordecai said you have to remember you're also a jew maybe god has raised you up for this hour praise the lord amen and i believe that's the reason why god has raised this bride up is for this hour that we are living in praise the lord it's for this hour where we pass the thought of just being church member where we are just identified with a church or identified with the message we are to the place word there will be a bride that will be a people because only the bride can give christ the preeminence amen and like brother branham says here it comes by that new birth he says the new birth is a revelation it has to be a revelation in a a a a wife to catch that revelation that um you know even though he's from a different family i'm from a different family the the the the blessing the the covenant of marriage has made us flesh off his flesh praise the lord are you are you understanding me amen that's why he's he's he's telling us the new birth is a revelation it brings us to a revelation that we are not church members amen no we are not church members we are sons and daughters of god we're not just trying this thing to see if it will work out it has to be a birth it has to be a change of nature it has to be an experience that make us to desire christ praise the lord we're not trying it to say well let me try to see if i will if it will work it's a revelation that make us to know he's my father praise the lord i came from god i appreciate my earthly parents but i realize by this new birth and constant desire to be like him are we together the new birth is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery it's not just on it knowing that jesus is god ignoring that you know about what a baptism ignoring no it's the mystery that makes you to also realize you are part of him amen you are part of him are we together praise the lord and then he goes ahead a little bit christ is the mystery of god we continue to hear he says did you know this paul never knew jesus physically amen paul never knew him the only way that paul knew him was by a revelation by a vision is that right paul only knew jesus by a revelation he saw the vision amen the light met him on the road of damascus he saw the vision he said lord whoa he never knew jesus at the age of paul he was living the very same time that jesus was earth on earth but he never met him physically praise the lord but being a student of the word being taught in the jewish religion he knew what the pillar of fire that led the children of israel he knew that light praise the lord and when when when the light strucks him he says what our lord amen he knew that it was the same light that met moses at the back side of the desert but now strange to him he heard i'm jesus whoa praise the lord strange he heard i'm jesus whom you are persecuting because it's hard to kick against the praise are we together now so we realized he had like brother barnum said he never knew jesus physically he knew jesus only by a revelation he come down he says peter has seen him in the flesh peter has seen jesus in the flesh but he didn't know him by flesh amen because jesus says so flesh and blood they didn't reveal it to you when he asked them who do men think that i the son of man am praise the lord amen peter said there i cried son of the living god and jesus said simon flesh and blood never relay this to you it was a revelation praise the lord now you think about this now paul knew jesus by a revelation a vision he saw the light and jesus i'm jesus whom the hour persecuting now that is the same thing that the new birth does to you and myself amen the new birth introduced jesus the same way that paul met jesus the same way that peter met jesus the new birth brings that introduction to you and myself it makes it personal some said that thou james some said that you are jeremiah he says what do you say what is your own personal experience and the place was quiet amen praise the lord paul says here in corinthians henceforth we know no man after the flesh praise the lord now you see that is the problem there are the the people that are having problems with the message that is the problem because if you know brother branham by the flesh or you know the messenger of this age just by everything that is uh uh from his kentucky birth and everything that is said on tabin and and and the life that he leave and really never got a revelation amen praise the lord because who is the messenger of the exeter who is the messenger of the exeter praise the lord something just struck my mind just now praise the lord amen but jordan if you can just help me put that picture of brother branham in the pillow of fire if you can just help me and put that there put it up praise the lord are we together mm-hmm sorry i just if you can put that picture up for me and i just send uh i just sent a call back there i want to use that tonight never thought about it i never thought i would go in that direction but i just i just throw something up there if you just want to put that picture up we just have a few minutes here henceforth we know no man after the flesh praise the lord now so we see here that he said the new birth is christ it's a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery praise the lord amen now now this is a familiar picture that we all we all know about uh uh we have seen we know we know the the the story behind it but uh uh uh if you can then just throw that quote that i had i just sent to you back there brother branham said this this he says but this picture here not because dear christian that aha is not me i just happen to be standing there that was all but this is the picture of a supernatural being and to my opinion if you notice it is the pillow of fire now what i would say to this is that we have made the picture more of brother branham when he's saying our justinity the picture is not of brother branham are we are we are we together we have made the picture more of brother brennan and less of what actually god was doing now you have to remember that uh brother branham was not he never even wanted to go up that night he said he was sitting in the crowd when when brother boswell told him to go up he said no he never wanted to go up to go and face mr best praise the lord mr best was tearing down divine healing he was tearing the testimony of divine healing are we together amen so when brother brennan went up that's that's why we talked about god vindicating his word god don't vindicate a man god vinnicate his word what was the question that was asked about the redemptive blessing all the redemptive in the old testament is it attributed to jesus christ so god in honor vindicating his word divine healing that he is the same god that saved the same god that healed amen amen praise the lord are we together because henceforth we know no man after the flesh are we together praise the lord because if a man stands on god's word if he preaches god's word now greta branham will say after all of his message if what i have preached to you is the truth he said god would come and vindicate it now god would come and vindicate me god will come and vindicate his word because we don't have to do with man we have to do with word the word of god which is the original seed spoken word is the original seed suddenly we were talking about the sea principle amen after the the the uh the serpent came and makes a seed and then god dared in in genesis says the end of all flesh has come god was spotting the end to dealing with flesh he went back to start dealing with the seed that was the promise he gave to abraham your seed shall possess the gifts of the enemy praise the lord amen that's the reason why jacob we know that he was a supplanter he he tricks he tell lies but there was something in him that was desiring the breath right and that was the thing that god had respect told god never had respect to his ethnic nature amen that was cheating and lying it was that thing that was giving him the desire to want the breath right praise the lord because god was dealing with the seed that was what he told the woman the seed of the woman will possess the gifts of the enemy thank you brother jordy thank you for for helping me bearing with me yeah putting that uh praise the lord amen and and that that that is just not even the only quote that brother brandon mentioned that on on talking about that light are we together now so you can see the same way that god out there in in corinthian paul said after jesus resurrected he revealed himself to 500 at the same time he says and this one saw him he says well i was the least i saw him too but paul never saw him in a physical body paul saw him by revelation god giving him an understanding praise the lord that the jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new testament are we together god giving him an understanding a revelation and that's the same thing that the new birth give to you and myself it gives us a revelation to be able to identify the god that has caught us and also to know our place to the one that has caught us he didn't just call us to be church members amen [Music] no if you call us to be church member yeah well it's good we can go around looking for the best church and looking for the good church and all of that but he called you to be a son or a daughter of god wherever you find yourself are we together henceforth we know no man after the flesh now i'm gonna i'm gonna just draw my hair right here because i took my time on this day that wait upon the lord amen so we realize here the first covenant when god was dealing with abraham there i mean uh uh adam did in the in the in the garden of eden it was it was god was dealing with him in the flesh and he fell and god had to become man god had to take flesh now you watch now the scripture make us to know that uh the word was made flesh amen that was jesus the word was made flesh but you have to see this time how the word was made flesh god going back to the seed now he have to bring our lord jesus without uh uh no human sensation praise the lord amen now the word becoming flesh this time now what i want you to keep in your in in your mind is the we just been talking about the different bodies amen and when we are taught that we will never be angers praise the lord we will always be human because we were we were made to inhabit the earth praise the lord so when the word become flesh it was the word become flesh to take us back to our original state praise the lord because god put in an end to all flesh is the curse upon this the the flesh desire and that's where we are called to be able to bring this body in submission to the world because the word is our husband that's where the preeminence is where you make the world first over your desire your fleshly desire because your desire will be to your husband and the word is your hustle so your ability your your work now as a wife as a church is to bring yourself in submissive to the word of god they that wait upon the lord amen praise the lord that's where the mystery is oh we want to speak and the sun must stand still we want to we we we want to bring the power back in the church but where is it it's in submission is in submission that was the revelation that was that jesus was embodying god of heaven himself subjected himself to his own lord amen the creator of heaven of heaven and earth he subjected himself to be able to redeem you and myself he has to come by the weight of the womb amen he had to taste the form of every he comes through that sea lion god himself producing the blood and and and exhale he came through that line he subjected himself that's the only way we can get anywhere with god is to submit ourselves to the world that's what christian life is constantly submitting yourself to the world not lifting your head up and thinking you are better than anybody and all these people they are going to hell and and no no no no it's every day you live in submission to the word of god we bring our thoughts in submission we bring our desire in submission we don't allow this everything and material things to pull us and drag us because that's what we are think about it the creator of heaven and earth he subjected himself to his own lord he never even had a house where the night meets him he said foxes have hoard the birds have net but the son of man don't have a place to lay his head he had to borrow a stable to be born what was god showing us borrowing a grave to be buried how to borrow the boat to preach what was he showing us but yet he had ten thousand cattles on the hill praise the lord and you know what this age is our age praise the lord and one of the devil in this age is material things it's material things praise the lord and that's the reason why the false church has grabbed the people on the prosperity gospel that you can prove your christianity by the car you are driving or the house you are living in amen when the god of heaven and earth says you are my little bride but man i'm talking about that ranger over in chicago coming to look for the bride when he came down to look for the bride he went down and saw the party and everything he left the people in the feast and he came walking in the pool neighborhood and saw the little little seven girl she was a seventh girl she was a seventh girl that's what the holy ghost would make you to be it will make you to be jehovah seven saw a seven girl wasting some ditch water outside praise the lord she says wow she don't look like them even though she never had the best dress on she never had no shoes on her feet praise the lord but he was captured to her character and the only character he saw in her that he loved is that she was a seven because our god is a seven praise the lord it's only the bride that we give christ the preeminence not my will but die be done though you slay me yet i will trust you amen praise the lord under the bride will give christ the preeminence because that is the revelation that the woman captured to submit herself her strength is in submission the strength of the church is in how much we submit to the world how much we submit to the word not argue with the word amen now fuss with the word the strength of the church that's the thing that will change our body is how much we submit to the word they that wait upon the lord he shall renew their strength that's the thing that is hard to do to wait you just tell somebody wait for me i'm coming how long you'll be here oh yeah you said you were coming ever since what are you doing it's just so hard it's hard for us to just stand still it's hard for us to just sit just sit and read the bible sit and listen to a message just sit and get into the spirit of the word that's the thing that is hard to do we can go with the music we can go with the singing and the dancing but to just sit and say lord feel me say god speak to me our mind you know why you're going everywhere thinking about days thinking about things that we're not supposed to think about the devil throwing thoughts our mind just to just say it and say god speak to me lord speak to me speak to me address something in my life give me the holy ghost while the preacher is preaching be with me just just to be there henceforth we know no man about the flesh we don't charge azealia's brother by the flesh no we look at the sea amen we look at the seed because spoken word is the original seed brother branham said one thing here i read from spoken word is the original see a close tonight he says how was christ the seed of abraham amen how was he the seed of abraham he says not in so much his body not in not in his body why because abraham was born by athlete parents he was born by sex so how was christ the seed of abraham not by the flesh amen but by his faith by the sea faith how was he the son of david not by the flesh i see where i'm going tonight not by the flesh and that's the reason why john says we are born again by the incorruptable seed by the incorruptible seed spoken word is the original seed brother branham said he said oh my god he said you can't be a seed and disagree with the word no because your birth comes by that word it comes by that seed when we talk about being born again not being identified with a church is not in our dress code it's the inside of the inside our desire the things we are desiring to be more like him let's buy our heads together tonight did i wait upon the lord let you sing there and then we pray together teach me lord to wait teach me father teach me lord to submit to you teach me father [Music] teach me dear lord [Music] upon the lord shire near their strength they shall not [Music] i'll be wearing oh they shall walk oh yes lord teach me lord teach me lord to submit to your word oh yeah teach me love to [Music] your own good times [Music] teach me now to rely [Music] in prayer [Music] upon the lord [Music] if we

wrong and not beware they shall walk they will never fear please teach me lord [Music] you see the mistake that we made on waiting on god you have to realize that god is not in time he's in tanner so you cannot put a time to god promise you can say well i've been waiting on god for five years i've been waiting on golf you can't god is internal until he until god does it you have to wait most of us we put god on our time instead of being on god's time when you get on god's time you are rolling through eternity the secret to wait on god is to submit to his word is to say be it unto me i call into your word and so say not my will but let your will be done it's not to be looking through the windows or looking over your shoulder or looking on the colander and looking at your watch god is not on your time he's now on an effort time the secret to wait for god is to submit to his word and say lord change me and say lord deal with me and say lord just be with me and give me strength o they thou wake upon the lord shall renew [Music] oh [Music] inna could not faint in a work with god he could not faint because he submitted himself to the word of god his strength came from the law oh yeah be that wait oh god teach us to wait lord teach us to wait father teach us not to put you on our time but for us to get on your time and your time is eternity lord [Music] that's why elijah could run more than ahab in a chair because he waited for god and both the man that walk with god and the man that ran with god both of them they fly they never saw death their body was changed they took a rapture because they cut the secret of god god's secret is in submission it's in obedience it's not trying to be smart and and trying no the secret to overcome is in submission to the world having a father heavenly father lord you hear people saying why we can't see the miracles while we can see the thing that was in brother branham ministry the secret was in a life of submission help us lord is the revelation of preeminence to give preeminence to christ is to submit ourselves to the world help us lord jesus help us our father in our daily life in our homes in our relationship with god teach
