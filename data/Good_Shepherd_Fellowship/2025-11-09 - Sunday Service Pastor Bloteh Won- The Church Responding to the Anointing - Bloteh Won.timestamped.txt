[25:41] &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord. We continue to pray
[25:43] that the Lord will keep helping our
[25:45] brother, brother Lawrence. And uh
[25:49] uh sometimes I see his courage. He pick
[25:52] up a song uh that he's been practicing
[25:56] and try to bring it and then uh it's not
[25:58] working well and and you know, okay,
[26:01] let's leave it. Let's go to the next
[26:02] one. Praise the Lord. So we just pray
[26:04] that the Lord would help our brother.
[26:06] Amen. Amen. And again, we want to greet
[26:10] everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[26:12] What can we say about the service on
[26:14] Wednesday night? Amen. It was beautiful.
[26:16] Praise the Lord. Our brother uh traveled
[26:19] to u uh Ohio. He's preaching for brother
[26:23] Chan this morning and then he leave back
[26:25] to Germany uh uh tomorrow. So uh it was
[26:30] it was good to meet him. It was very
[26:32] very good. especially for me. Amen. I
[26:35] had the best part of it because since he
[26:37] came in on uh Tuesday, we just we just
[26:41] we just had a good time to spend
[26:43] together, visit with one another, get to
[26:46] know one another, talk. I mean, it was
[26:48] just we just took up right from there.
[26:50] Right from there, we just took up.
[26:52] Praise the Lord. Because it happens
[26:53] there.
[26:55] uh we had many acquaintance you know he
[26:58] sent me the picture when he got to the
[27:00] airport um and then he's standing with
[27:02] brother Ruben Daniels and his wife they
[27:05] were my host uh the first time in South
[27:08] Africa 2004
[27:11] so I thought he just came from South
[27:13] Africa so uh when when I pick him up I
[27:16] says oh you just came from he said no I
[27:19] would just send you a picture so you can
[27:20] you can put a face to the name I said oh
[27:23] well you sent me the picture of my host.
[27:25] Those are my host. Oh, you know them.
[27:27] And then we just start right from there.
[27:29] Praise the Lord. But the service was
[27:31] wonderful. A little bit different, but
[27:33] it was wonderful. Uh all of God's
[27:36] children uh are very very very unique.
[27:39] Very unique in their way. Amen. But I
[27:42] think one thing we can learn and and the
[27:44] the beautiful thing that also was about
[27:46] the service is that the let's go to the
[27:49] book of Colossian. We're not we're not
[27:51] starting our reading yet, but uh uh um
[27:56] this was where brother Farmer read from
[28:00] uh on on Sunday morning.
[28:03] That was where he read from and and that
[28:05] was that was the part of the service
[28:07] that really that really uh you know
[28:09] intrigued me. It got my attention
[28:12] because I just felt like okay I think
[28:14] the Lord is dealing with us here. Praise
[28:17] the [clears throat] Lord. I feel like
[28:18] the Lord is dealing with us.
[28:21] Oh, praise the Lord. He read from uh
[28:25] Colossians chapter one.
[28:32] Amen.
[28:45] Okay. Uh let's read from verse 12. This
[28:49] was where he read from on on Sunday
[28:51] morning when he preached to us. And
[28:54] strange enough, he never even gave a a a
[28:56] title to his subject. He just, you know,
[28:59] uh went into the testimony about his
[29:02] mother coming in the prayer line in a
[29:05] message
[29:07] uh spiritual food in due season and
[29:09] talked about his healing and he just
[29:11] went on from there. So he really didn't
[29:13] give his his title to his sermon. So I
[29:17] was looking it up and I think what they
[29:19] did was they took the title from the
[29:21] Sunday school and make make the sermon.
[29:23] So that was good. Amen. So if you look
[29:27] online it will be only believe.
[29:30] Now, so from verse uh 12, giving thanks
[29:33] unto the Father, which have made us meet
[29:37] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[29:39] the saints in light,
[29:41] who have delivered us from the power of
[29:45] darkness. [snorts] That's very powerful.
[29:47] Praise the Lord.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; He have delivered us from the power of
[29:50] darkness and have translated us. Now if
[29:54] you watch when brother FMA preach you
[29:57] will say uh this word was the same word
[29:59] that was used for Enoch. Enoch was
[30:02] translated.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; So actually the message he was preaching
[30:06] was actually around translation around
[30:09] the rapture.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; And here is uh brother uh uh uh uh Andre
[30:15] comes on on uh Wednesday night and he
[30:18] preaching to us rapture ready.
[30:23] Praise the Lord.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; But with this scripture, we can know
[30:27] that we are rapture ready
[30:30] &gt;&gt; because what is happening here is that
[30:33] he has delivered us from the power of
[30:36] darkness. Not only that we are delivered
[30:39] but we have been translated.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; We have been moved under another
[30:44] headship.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; We have been moved on under another
[30:51] headship. So we are completely under a
[30:54] new government. Amen.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; He has delivered us from the power of
[30:57] darkness. Translated us into the kingdom
[31:00] of his dear son
[31:03] &gt;&gt; in whom we have redemption through his
[31:07] blood even the forgiveness of our sin.
[31:11] Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; So I just thought that was just a
[31:14] perfect connection and I mean I was just
[31:16] I was just enjoying his time of of
[31:19] bringing the word. He's a He's a man
[31:22] that is uh as we talk a little bit. I
[31:25] mean, he likes he likes the rubber to
[31:26] meet the road. He likes uh things to be
[31:29] real.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he was he was trying to make
[31:33] us to know it was beautiful. And it's
[31:35] true. You read the Bible. After Elijah
[31:38] came from out of that anointing, he went
[31:41] straight into depression. And he never
[31:44] got out of it until he was raptured.
[31:46] That's true. Brother Bannon said it.
[31:50] He went in and out of depression. You
[31:52] know, uh the effect of the anointing and
[31:55] and and and you see that it's so bad.
[31:59] They're so bad. The the tap pool, one of
[32:02] the vision of the tap pool, brother
[32:03] Brandham says uh you know that that part
[32:06] of vision where they were trying to he
[32:08] trying to lace the shoes and God says
[32:11] you cannot teach Pentecostal people,
[32:15] &gt;&gt; you know, supernatural things
[32:17] &gt;&gt; and that and that is the place where we
[32:19] are. You we we finding ourself in this
[32:22] time where many preachers are running to
[32:25] divine healing. We are we are streaming
[32:27] after divine healing you know we want
[32:29] this vedication that I pray for this
[32:31] person and they were well you know and I
[32:33] pray for this person and they were well
[32:35] but uh if you if you really watch that
[32:38] is that the the healing is still in the
[32:41] camp
[32:42] &gt;&gt; but it's not the major thing that God is
[32:44] doing.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Healing is stayed in the camp but
[32:50] it's not the major thing that God is
[32:51] doing. The major thing that God is doing
[32:54] is getting you rapture ready,
[32:57] &gt;&gt; getting our state of mind in a place
[33:00] because if you if you really look at it,
[33:02] saints, you will realize that there is
[33:05] no age that is ever like our age.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; You would not imagine the things that we
[33:11] are dealing with in this age.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot imagine the things that
[33:21] we you are we are dealing with with in
[33:23] this age but you see because we have
[33:26] lived here I don't know I know my age I
[33:28] don't know yours but for how many years
[33:30] I have been here it is how many years
[33:32] that you have been dealing with that
[33:34] right from the mother's womb
[33:40] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[33:41] &gt;&gt; we are dealing with every form of
[33:43] pressure so you see the word the message
[33:45] of the hour is to set our mind to
[33:49] understand the time we are living in,
[33:51] what we are dealing with and what God is
[33:54] doing in us.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; He's not bringing this flesh to
[33:58] perfection.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; He's bringing your spirit to understand
[34:03] &gt;&gt; the grace that has been given to you for
[34:06] this hour.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; So, I I just thought that that was that
[34:12] was very beautiful.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; That was very very very beautiful.
[34:17] the the two witnesses in Jerusalem like
[34:20] he typed Moses and Elijah they are a
[34:22] type of a rapture
[34:25] but they were dead they were killed in
[34:27] the street before their body was
[34:29] raptured
[34:34] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[34:38] &gt;&gt; so I thought it was beautiful Amen
[34:41] he he traveled and touched me yesterday
[34:45] that he he got back and he talked to
[34:48] Ohio sibling and and really really
[34:51] expressed how much he enjoyed the
[34:53] fellowship. Uh amen how much he enjoyed
[34:57] uh uh the quality of uh of the reception
[35:00] of the word. You know when the preacher
[35:02] is preaching he uh he can feed you.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; He can feel that you are receiving him.
[35:07] He can feel that you are resenting him.
[35:10] He really testified that he really fed
[35:12] at home. Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; He fed at home and and uh And there's so
[35:17] much there. He asked me, he says, he
[35:19] said, "Brother War, I was thinking to
[35:22] preach something for brother Chab, but
[35:24] I'm going to preach exactly what I
[35:26] preach at your place because I I I just
[35:29] found a channel and I felt that it was
[35:32] good." Amen. So, I'm going to preach
[35:34] there. He says on the voice, he says,
[35:35] "If you will allow me, I don't know if I
[35:37] have the authority, but [laughter]
[35:41] praise the Lord." But uh in saying that
[35:44] also is is at a place where uh you know
[35:48] we must we must commend you and uh and
[35:51] commend ourself uh that uh uh you know
[35:54] the Lord has given us the grace to be
[35:56] able to labor together. Like I've always
[35:59] said there's one responsibility that we
[36:01] have is the atmosphere here.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Every one of us that walks through that
[36:07] door are responsible for what happened
[36:10] here during the service.
[36:12] Praise the Lord.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I think it's a beautiful
[36:17] thing. Uh uh it does not uh it does not
[36:20] have to do with the crowd. It does not
[36:22] have to do with our our just it's it's
[36:25] just our expectation.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The expectation we bring to
[36:31] church, the readiness and and also we
[36:34] are here because you can be here and not
[36:37] here.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; But we want you to be here. Amen. We
[36:42] want you to be here. Don't don't leave
[36:43] your body with us and go shopping with
[36:45] your spirit.
[36:47] Praise the Lord.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Because uh if you do that, we'll take
[36:53] the rapture and then you get back in
[36:55] just a dead body you meet.
[36:58] So we are very very grateful this
[37:00] morning. Very very grateful this
[37:02] morning. I don't have a lot of u uh uh
[37:06] prayer leads that came through the text.
[37:08] I'm sure There's a whole lot there. But
[37:11] uh uh of those uh believers in in
[37:16] Nigeria that were kidnapped uh a text
[37:18] message came uh they all were released.
[37:21] So we went back to their family and we
[37:24] just want to thank the Lord for that.
[37:25] Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So let's just stand to
[37:29] uh stand on our feet and we will go to
[37:31] the book of Isaiah.
[37:34] We go to the book of Isaiah.
[37:38] Praise the Lord.
[37:41] Go to the book of Isaiah, chapter 10.
[37:52] Isaiah chapter 10. Let's read verse 27.
[37:56] And I will have you to take your seat.
[37:58] Then I will go back to the beginning of
[38:01] the chapter and read what I want to read
[38:04] because I want to use that to be able to
[38:05] set the stage of what I want to express
[38:08] this morning. Amen. Verse 27.
[38:13] And it shall come to pass in that day
[38:17] that his burden shall be taken away from
[38:22] thy shoulder. His burden shall be taken
[38:25] off thy shoulder, and his yoke from of
[38:29] thy neck, and the yoke shall dis shall
[38:33] be destroyed because of the anointing.
[38:37] Strange enough, when brother Lawrence
[38:39] was studying the song, he said this, the
[38:42] anointing will break the yoke. I said,
[38:43] well, okay, I think we we are on the
[38:45] same page now.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, we want to
[38:49] ask your blessing, Lord, on the service
[38:51] this morning. Lord G, as we go into your
[38:53] word, we'll go back now, Father, as at
[38:56] the beginning of the chapter, but just
[38:58] help us, Lord, to just be able to grab
[39:01] the context. So, Father, we love you and
[39:03] we appreciate you, Father, in Jesus
[39:05] name. Amen. The Lord bless you. You can
[39:08] have your seat. Let's go back to uh the
[39:11] beginning of the chapter. We could start
[39:12] from verse five. But uh
[39:17] uh
[39:24] I I would jump few verses but I just I
[39:27] just want for us to be able to grab uh
[39:29] the context here. Verse one. W unto them
[39:32] that decreed on unrighteous decree and
[39:36] that right the grievousness which they
[39:38] have perceived to turn aside the the
[39:41] needed to to turn aside the needed from
[39:44] judgment and to take away the right from
[39:47] the poor of my people
[39:50] that widows may be their prey and that
[39:54] they may rob the fatherless.
[39:58] Let's drop down to verse five. The
[40:00] picture really starts to build from
[40:02] there. Oh Assyan,
[40:05] the rod of my anger. Now God is
[40:11] referring to this foreign nation, to
[40:15] this hidden nation that they are the rod
[40:18] of his anger. They are a whip in his
[40:22] hands.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's what I want us to see the
[40:26] picture now.
[40:27] uh over here the rod of of my anger and
[40:31] the staff in their hand is my
[40:36] indignation. So whatever staff, sword,
[40:40] uh armor they are using. God is saying
[40:43] is my judgment is my indignation. I will
[40:47] send him. I will send Assyrian
[40:50] against an hypocritical nation which is
[40:53] Israel. And against the people of my
[40:56] wrath will I give him a charge to take
[41:00] the spo and to to take the prey and to
[41:03] tread tread them down like the m of the
[41:08] street, the m of the street. How be it
[41:13] he mean not so. Neither does his heart
[41:17] think so. Now think about this. Now God
[41:20] is saying that I'm I'm using the
[41:24] appearance as a rod in my hands. But
[41:27] listen to this verse. How be your soul?
[41:29] He meetth now. So his heart thinkketh
[41:32] now. So he really don't have the heart
[41:35] to be able to do such a wickedness.
[41:38] That's where now you're going to see
[41:40] where the anointing comes in. Because
[41:43] God is saying, I'm going to use a serum.
[41:46] Meaning that I'm going to anoint them to
[41:49] do this. They don't have the heart to do
[41:51] it.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[42:00] &gt;&gt; How be it, he meetth so, neither does
[42:05] his heart think so. But it is in his
[42:09] heart to destroy and cut off nations,
[42:13] not a few.
[42:16] Praise the Lord.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:26] Uh I want to drop down a little bit
[42:29] here.
[42:32] Okay. Uh let's go down now.
[42:40] Okay, let's go down to verse uh 14.
[42:47] For my hand has f has found as uh a net
[42:51] of of riches of the people and as one
[42:55] gathering eggs that are left.
[43:00] Have I gathered all the earth? And there
[43:02] was none that move the wind or or open
[43:07] the mouth or pep it. Shall the axe Okay.
[43:11] Yeah. Verse 15. That's what I wanted to
[43:14] get to actually. Now, shall the axe
[43:17] boast itself against him that that held
[43:21] that hel?
[43:23] Or shall the sword magnify itself
[43:27] against him that shaketh it? Or as as if
[43:32] the rod should shake itself against them
[43:36] that lift it up or as if the staff
[43:39] should lift up itself as if it were no
[43:44] wood. Now, so God is saying now because
[43:47] you're coming to see where the picture
[43:49] will be here. He's saying that just like
[43:53] this vowing cannot lift itself up in
[43:56] play.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So neither can the roar lift
[44:00] itself up and fight. The staff cannot
[44:03] just get up and start killing.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[44:20] Okay. Verse 16. Therefore shall the Lord
[44:24] the Lord of hosts send among among his
[44:27] fat ones leaners and under his glory he
[44:31] shall candle uh a burning
[44:35] like the burning of fire.
[44:39] Praise the Lord.
[44:42] Praise the Lord.
[44:47] Verse
[44:52] 17. And the lights of Israel shall be
[44:55] for a fire in his holy one for a flame
[44:58] and it shall burn in devour with tongues
[45:01] and with birth in one bang.
[45:03] Now, so when you read carefully, when
[45:07] you read carefully, I think I might have
[45:10] skipped the verse, but where I'm trying
[45:12] to get to here is that God from the
[45:16] beginning said he was going to use the
[45:18] searing as a rod in his hands. Praise
[45:21] the Lord. Amen.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; But then if you read there carefully,
[45:25] I'm trying to craft the verse because uh
[45:28] that's not where I want to do it, but I
[45:30] just wanted to use it as a picture
[45:32] because we're going to talk about the
[45:33] anointing
[45:35] and and uh
[45:45] okay, let's let's let's drop down a
[45:48] little bit. Okay, the verse is stay
[45:50] ahead of me.
[46:00] The verse is still ahead of me. This uh
[46:02] that verse 24. Therefore, thus say the
[46:05] Lord God of hosts, oh my people
[46:08] that dwelleth in Zion, be not afraid of
[46:11] the Assyrian, he he shall smite thee
[46:13] with a rod, and shall lift up his staff
[46:17] against thee after the manner of Egypt.
[46:22] for yet a very little while and the
[46:25] indignation shall cease and my anger
[46:30] in their destruction and the Lord of
[46:32] hosts shall strip up uh escort for him I
[46:37] calling to the slaughter. Now so what is
[46:39] happening yet is that God is saying I'm
[46:41] going to use these people but again I'm
[46:44] going to turn around because they were
[46:46] just a whip for me to be able to
[46:48] discipline my children.
[46:51] But I'm going to turn around and destroy
[46:53] them. And the reason is because they
[46:56] thought that they were doing it.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the principle?
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Now think about it. Okay. A good picture
[47:07] here will be Nebuchadnezzar.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; He was just like just like the Assyrian.
[47:14] God used him as a whip. But when he took
[47:17] it to himself
[47:21] &gt;&gt; that see all of these things that my
[47:23] hand has done. He went seven years like
[47:26] a beast.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; He went seven year like a beast. So uh
[47:36] uh the principle there that we want to
[47:39] we want to look at here is that uh uh in
[47:43] in in the message perfect fit brother
[47:44] Brandon said in many places but right
[47:47] here I have this one he said but he
[47:50] cannot fail. So as long as we are trying
[47:53] in ourself and depending on our own
[47:56] abilities and so for why we will do
[47:59] nothing but when we but when we get to a
[48:03] place where we know we are nothing then
[48:06] God can use us.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; So uh uh uh whether the heathens whether
[48:15] the believers God don't want us to
[48:18] depend on our ability. Praise the Lord.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; And and and the the the major thing with
[48:25] my mindset here this morning is that it
[48:28] will not take our ability to put us in
[48:30] the rapture.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will not take our ability to
[48:36] overcome in this age.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; We will have to rely on the anointing.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; So we want to start our subject. We've
[48:48] been talking from uh uh Revelation
[48:51] chapter 4, five, and six and uh the the
[48:54] the the beasts and the rather. That's
[48:58] what we've been we've been we've been
[49:00] dwelling on. [clears throat] And then
[49:02] when these brothers comes, they preach
[49:04] wonderful messages. You just you almost
[49:07] want to leave your subject and follow
[49:09] them, but you have to stay where you
[49:11] want to be. Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; So, I will read from uh the the the
[49:15] fifth seal this morning. That's where my
[49:18] inspiration is coming from from the
[49:20] fifth seal.
[49:22] Brother Brandham says here don't forget
[49:25] this church and you brethrens on tape.
[49:29] We are the one I want you to examine
[49:32] this. How could men do anything else
[49:36] beside the power of God that has been
[49:39] released to them?
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How can a man do
[49:44] anything? How can a woman do anything?
[49:47] How can a bride do anything? How can the
[49:49] children of God do anything in this age
[49:53] than the power that is released to them?
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] He says, I'm going to set uh this box up
[50:04] here to represent it. He's trying to uh
[50:07] build an image. Now, if God send a
[50:10] certain spirit among them, that's the
[50:14] only thing that they can the only thing
[50:18] that they can work by
[50:21] is the spirit that works among them.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Now, we will prove to you by the history
[50:31] of the church and by the opening of the
[50:34] seals and uh and and the power that let
[50:39] loose.
[50:41] Now, watch exactly the church responding
[50:45] to the anointing and they couldn't do
[50:49] nothing else.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; We cannot do nothing else but to
[50:55] respond.
[50:57] to the anointing of our age.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; We cannot do anything beyond that.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Anything we trying to
[51:09] do beyond that, we only using our
[51:12] ability and pretty soon we will fail.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[51:18] If we try to do anything more than that,
[51:21] you see and and and that's the reason
[51:23] why the uh uh uh you know the the the
[51:27] cult the brother introduces thought the
[51:30] rapture will just be a normal routine.
[51:36] It's not going to be an extraordinary
[51:39] thing in uh uh what they did in South
[51:42] Africa having people to to go in a bush
[51:44] and and everybody going on top of the
[51:46] mountain and uh uh looking to the
[51:49] heavens and uh it's just going to be a
[51:53] normal routine. Two will be in bed,
[51:56] &gt;&gt; one will be taken, one will be left. Two
[51:58] will be in the field working, one will
[52:00] be taken, one will be left. It will just
[52:02] be a normal routine.
[52:08] Are we together?
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; But if you read that quote, it says that
[52:15] uh uh brother Brandham says it will be a
[52:17] normal routine as we scripturally follow
[52:22] the word.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which mean as we are just
[52:31] scripturally living living we just
[52:33] living our simple Christian life. We are
[52:36] not putting up a show. We're not trying
[52:37] to impress anybody. We are just living
[52:40] our simple Christian life. Believing
[52:42] trusting in God. Amen. And just seeing
[52:45] how he's dealing with us.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Responding to the anointing. That's what
[52:51] I'm I want to preach. I'm I'm speaking
[52:53] on this morning. The church responding
[52:55] to the anointing. And she can do nothing
[52:58] else.
[53:00] She can do nothing else but to respond
[53:04] to the anointing. You try to get away
[53:05] from it, God will drag you by the feet.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; If he got to pull you by the ear, if you
[53:10] got to come in by the skin of your
[53:12] teeth, he would do it because you are
[53:15] you are predestinated to to to respond
[53:18] to the anointing of this hour.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] So he says here, [clears throat] I I I
[53:32] will prove it to you by history of the
[53:35] church and by the opening of the seals,
[53:37] the power that let loose and watch
[53:41] exactly the church responding to the
[53:43] anointing and they couldn't do nothing
[53:46] else. Now the first was the lion.
[53:52] Praise the Lord. The lion that rolled
[53:55] that pure unadulterated word. The second
[53:58] interoteria was ox. Terrier age was not
[54:02] the second age but the second anointing
[54:05] came in territorial age. Why? Because
[54:08] the first three church ages were under
[54:10] the first anointing. We've been we've
[54:13] been over there going over there. The
[54:15] first three church ages were under the
[54:18] lion anointing. So that's what he's he's
[54:20] saying here. The first anointing was the
[54:22] lion that pe on adultery the word. And
[54:25] then the second interior was the ox. He
[54:28] says it was a burden. The beast of
[54:30] burden. Pardon me. He says it was a
[54:33] sacrificial beast.
[54:36] And wasn't that exactly
[54:40] exactly the poor little church room has
[54:43] scattered down to a thousand years of
[54:46] dark age and everything that they didn't
[54:49] profess to be to be of the Roman church
[54:53] was put to death immediately.
[54:58] What did they do? They were they
[55:00] willingly walk up there and die. They
[55:03] were responding to their anointing.
[55:07] They did it joyfully.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. They did it joyfully. They were
[55:14] responding to the anointing.
[55:16] Our re our first reaction would be to
[55:19] run away. Why? Because the eagle loves
[55:21] to fly. [laughter]
[55:28] Praise the Lord. Our first respond would
[55:31] be, "Oh my god, what's happening? you
[55:33] start trying to to see if your wings are
[55:36] tied.
[55:39] What did they do? They willingly walk up
[55:41] there and die. They didn't put Kier
[55:44] because the spirit of the church in that
[55:47] day was sacrificed. Labor.
[55:52] Praise the Lord.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Labor. They knew it was going to happen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was the anointing that
[56:06] was on the church and they could do
[56:09] nothing else
[56:11] but to respond to that anointing.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; The anointing on this church is to be in
[56:21] the image of Christ.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we must be center
[56:25] on the word. We're not following
[56:28] emotion. We're not trying to copy
[56:30] another church and copy what God is
[56:32] doing. So, no, no, we must stay with the
[56:34] word because we want to be is to be in
[56:38] the image of Christ.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; They willingly walk up there and died
[56:52] and and and
[56:54] they didn't but but uh but care because
[56:57] the spirit of the church in that day was
[57:00] sacrificed labor. They walk up just as
[57:04] freely as they could walk anointed with
[57:08] the spirit of God of that age and die
[57:12] like heroes.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; They die like heroes. They die singing
[57:21] songs
[57:22] because it was the anointing that was on
[57:26] them.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; I I just I I I just want to to set this
[57:37] uh uh uh from the beginning before we uh
[57:41] we we take off here. That that that that
[57:43] was the anointing that was on the that
[57:46] was on the church.
[57:48] They died
[57:51] a hero, a sacrifice. Thousand times
[57:54] thousand
[57:56] 68 million of them on the record ox
[58:00] sacrifice. Oh mind. Do you understand?
[58:04] Now sacrifice is it only could labor in
[58:08] that age. It can only labor. It was only
[58:11] laboring in that age. This age is to
[58:15] come up higher.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the reason why
[58:21] all of these uh uh self affliction and
[58:24] self starving to get more power from God
[58:27] and you just go on hunger strike. It
[58:29] does not work.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; It does not work. I'm not weeping away
[58:35] fasting and praying. Fasting and praying
[58:37] is just a normal thing. It must be a
[58:39] normal thing like you coming to church.
[58:43] It must not be like seeking for some
[58:46] kind of a extra ordinary power because
[58:48] it does not work. What what is happening
[58:50] here is that the anointing for this age
[58:54] is to come up higher.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; This bride got to be a muro bride in the
[59:00] word
[59:00] &gt;&gt; that when we have when we have situation
[59:03] and circumstances in our life, if a
[59:06] person is sick, their first mind will
[59:09] not be what sin did I committed? That's
[59:11] right.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Their first thought would be, "Lord, let
[59:17] me glorify you in this trial. Give me
[59:19] the strength
[59:20] &gt;&gt; that my faith will not get weak."
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; But what what what we do, I mean, it's
[59:31] it's it's a Pentecostal thing for us to
[59:33] start looking for uh uh the cause of the
[59:35] sickness. Where is the curse coming
[59:37] from? You know, what our parent did
[59:39] something wrong? and and and we then we
[59:41] go all through this all all through that
[59:44] &gt;&gt; as if to say we have not received a
[59:46] prophet we have not received the word
[59:49] &gt;&gt; the church must be mature that when we
[59:52] have situation in our life we have
[59:54] situation in our home you must realize
[59:57] that UH YOU HAVE THIS BODY THAT HAVE h
[1:00:01] all your senses
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; and YOU ALSO HAVE EXPERIMENT THAT'S why
[1:00:06] Paul call it experiment you have a dual
[1:00:09] life.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A DUAL LIFE TO MAINTAIN.
[1:00:16] YOUR PHYSICAL LIFE COULD BE very poor
[1:00:19] AND UNHEALTHY WHILE YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE
[1:00:22] CAN BE STRONG.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; And a person can ALSO BE SO BRIGHT AND
[1:00:29] AND AND AND and prosper and blessed in
[1:00:32] his physical life while their SPIRITUAL
[1:00:35] LIFE IS DEAD AND POOR.
[1:00:40] How we keeping the balance?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Eagle have two wings.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; You can't only fly with one,
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; We must get oursel from out of this
[1:00:57] death death mar. Brother Brandham said
[1:00:59] it's a death mar to just be keep going
[1:01:01] around the same cycle. We must
[1:01:04] understand that God is moving. He's not
[1:01:07] going around.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; He's moving. He's moving forward.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; And we must move forward with him.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; You father in the church world, they put
[1:01:25] a whole ladder on, you know, pray, pray,
[1:01:28] pray, fast, pray, pray, pray, and there
[1:01:30] is just no balance in the word. You
[1:01:33] don't have a good prayer life.
[1:01:36] If you are not reading the word,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; no, you don't have a good prayer life.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; If I would say in another way is that
[1:01:48] you becoming too noisy and irritated to
[1:01:50] God because you're becoming this person
[1:01:53] that is talking talking and never giving
[1:01:56] him a chance to talk back to you.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; You doing all the talking.
[1:02:03] A good prayer life IS A LIFE THAT IS
[1:02:06] BALANCED in prayer and in the word.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Because as you are talking to him, you
[1:02:14] also allow him to speak to you through
[1:02:16] the word,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; through the preaching, THROUGH THE
[1:02:20] TAPES, WHATEVER. BUT YOU WANT HIM TO
[1:02:22] SPEAK TO YOU.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says the
[1:02:28] church treating God as an eron boy. They
[1:02:31] just want to tell him DO THIS FOR ME. GO
[1:02:33] LORD, TELL YOUR LORD. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
[1:02:35] YEAH.
[1:02:37] YOU don't have a good prayer life. If
[1:02:40] you really not seizing in the word, if
[1:02:42] you are not meditating,
[1:02:44] if you are not a line, Lord, speak to
[1:02:46] me. This scripture I'm reading, let
[1:02:48] something come out of it that speak to
[1:02:50] me.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] The church can do nothing
[1:03:12] but respond to her anointing.
[1:03:15] Amen.
[1:03:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:23] Our sacrifice. Oh my God. Do you
[1:03:25] understand that? Now sacrifice is the
[1:03:30] It only could labor in that age to
[1:03:34] combat the great opposition
[1:03:38] for that 1,000 years. Now, you will see
[1:03:42] that uh uh
[1:03:46] look at it this way. Look at it this
[1:03:48] way. Here are the the believers being
[1:03:52] persecuted
[1:03:53] and uh and and being killed.
[1:03:57] We were taken for weakness.
[1:04:00] We were taken for the church being
[1:04:02] defeated.
[1:04:04] Brother B says that was where that that
[1:04:06] great critics that wrote the book on the
[1:04:08] silent god. That's where he took his
[1:04:11] inspiration from and he wrote he says
[1:04:14] where is God? you were silent and they
[1:04:15] killing the we were taken for weakness.
[1:04:20] But for God, he anointed his people to
[1:04:24] go through that.
[1:04:32] Are we together?
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; They were anointed to go through that.
[1:04:35] It was their season. It was what God
[1:04:38] wanted. N it was
[1:04:43] the Bible says precious precious
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; in the sight of the Lord
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; right
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; is the death of the s
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; what WHAT WHAT MAKE THE death of the sin
[1:04:54] precious is not the way they are killed
[1:04:57] it's the way they are behaving
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; in death
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; the way they are behaving
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; in death
[1:05:07] EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE DYING THEY'RE SICK
[1:05:08] WITNESS IS EATING THEIR BODY UP but
[1:05:11] their heart is saying blessed be the
[1:05:13] name of the LORD
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH YOU SLAY ME I will praise
[1:05:16] you that's what is precious in death
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; it's not the dying it's the attitude
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; the bible say precious in the sight of
[1:05:30] the lord
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; is the death of the saints
[1:05:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] [clears throat]
[1:05:44] Brother Brandham land quickly.
[1:05:47] Warning before Joshua, he learned it
[1:05:49] very quickly.
[1:05:51] He's praying for someone and and uh and
[1:05:54] you know the person came and gave back
[1:05:55] their heart back to the Lord and you
[1:05:57] know he told the told the church the you
[1:05:59] know uh uh I mean told the the family
[1:06:02] you know the the person will be healed.
[1:06:04] Yeah. They got healed. They give their
[1:06:05] heart back to the Lord and and then they
[1:06:07] die. He went before God and says, "Lord,
[1:06:09] why?"
[1:06:12] He says, "That person just moved before
[1:06:14] me in a simple position. Shut up your
[1:06:16] mouth. Who are you to ask me why?"
[1:06:20] I could have take her when she was
[1:06:22] backslided.
[1:06:26] Now she has come back to the Lord. That
[1:06:27] is the good time to take her.
[1:06:35] You see our mind is just is just we we
[1:06:38] are so affected church whether we like
[1:06:40] it or not. This the the the Roman stain
[1:06:43] that has been the Catholic stain that
[1:06:46] has been on the church
[1:06:49] we will battle with it until we leave
[1:06:51] from here.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Catholism and denomination has abused
[1:07:00] our mind.
[1:07:02] that for us to really understand the way
[1:07:04] that God is, we always falling back to
[1:07:06] the way the church understanding.
[1:07:15] We will take that for defeat, but for
[1:07:17] God, it's not defeat.
[1:07:19] Praise the Lord. It's not defeat to for
[1:07:22] God. He said, YOU HAVE FOUGHT A GOOD
[1:07:24] fight of faith.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:29] While we will be here crying, oh Lord,
[1:07:31] Lord, Father, we prayed, we fasted,
[1:07:33] Lord, we asked you, we were, we were
[1:07:36] begging you and because in our mind, we
[1:07:39] in our mind, we are this poor children.
[1:07:43] That in our mind, everything we ask the
[1:07:45] father, it must be yes.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; No, in God's mind, it's not like that.
[1:07:51] He don't want us to be spoiled. He want
[1:07:53] us to be disciplined.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. for us to understand that he has a
[1:07:57] yes and he has a no.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; To every yes there's a no.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; If God say no to you, can you tell him
[1:08:14] thank you?
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. Are you are you are you are so
[1:08:18] disciplined and [clears throat]
[1:08:19] understand his ways that if he say no to
[1:08:22] you, you can say thank you Lord.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; You can say thank you with the same
[1:08:27] smile like you would say thank you if it
[1:08:30] was a yes.
[1:08:33] That's where he's getting us to.
[1:08:38] That's that's where he's getting us to.
[1:08:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; And then he gets down to the tear beast
[1:08:56] that went forth out from the devil
[1:09:01] was this black black hery. Now the ter
[1:09:05] beast that went out a power from God to
[1:09:10] come back him to come back that power of
[1:09:12] the black house was was a man a coning
[1:09:16] smart wisdom with the wisdom of God. The
[1:09:21] anointing was a man.
[1:09:24] It was the man age.
[1:09:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:32] It was a man age. I will say I will say
[1:09:34] some things here this morning that will
[1:09:37] maybe just slap you on your face a
[1:09:38] little bit.
[1:09:40] But I don't know how much shakaza you
[1:09:43] have. Amen.
[1:09:46] Praise the Lord. I don't know how much
[1:09:48] shaka you have, but uh let's uh
[1:09:53] he says that the the the tees was the
[1:09:56] man. So, uh, uh, Emanuel, if you could
[1:09:59] just put my image up a little bit.
[1:10:01] Let's, uh, let's follow.
[1:10:10] Okay, this is the picture that we've
[1:10:11] been we've been working with
[1:10:14] uh, uh, through our entire
[1:10:18] uh, series here. So we have the the the
[1:10:22] full anointing on this side. Uh and then
[1:10:25] we have the full evil power on this
[1:10:28] side. You see the darkness coming from
[1:10:29] the bottleless pit and it's it's dealing
[1:10:32] with this. And so we we uh uh
[1:10:38] that's what we were dealing with. That's
[1:10:39] the image we were dealing with. But I
[1:10:41] tried to I try to look for another one.
[1:10:44] So uh let's let's see if the other one
[1:10:46] will will explain a little more to us
[1:10:51] now. So uh we have the lion year. So in
[1:10:54] the under the lion we see there we had
[1:10:57] the three church ages and this is the
[1:11:00] the the
[1:11:02] white horse rather that was traveling
[1:11:05] with a bold and go arrow. So he he was
[1:11:08] operating through these three church
[1:11:11] ages. Now you have to realize that on
[1:11:14] the Bible says that uh he has a bow no
[1:11:18] arrow but then he was given a crown. Now
[1:11:22] so we explained that how that the the
[1:11:25] trinitarian doctrine was introduced
[1:11:27] here. It went through these ages and it
[1:11:29] got a crown. Amen. Brother B say it just
[1:11:32] started from a thought that that was
[1:11:34] looking like a good thought. It became a
[1:11:36] deed and it was established as a
[1:11:38] doctrine. So it it went through all of
[1:11:40] these three church ages. So in the quote
[1:11:42] here, brother Brandham used territoriing
[1:11:46] the second beast. It was right here.
[1:11:48] That's the that's the uh
[1:11:53] uh the ox the ox anointing. And uh uh
[1:11:58] it's right here in the dark age. And uh
[1:12:03] it has the red horse rather uh which uh
[1:12:07] the Bible
[1:12:09] you know, he was killing and then so we
[1:12:12] have uh uh the tail one here supposed to
[1:12:15] be a man. I think the picture is on the
[1:12:17] next one is on the next one just because
[1:12:20] of uh the position of the man because
[1:12:24] when you look at let's go let's go back
[1:12:26] to the first uh the the first picture.
[1:12:29] Uh yeah. So when you look at when you
[1:12:31] look at it here
[1:12:34] in in many in many cases
[1:12:37] the lion did the the first three the ox
[1:12:41] the man anointing
[1:12:43] operated in the last three church ages.
[1:12:49] Okay. The eagle anointing came at the
[1:12:54] end of the laudish church age.
[1:12:57] Are we together?
[1:12:59] It came at the end of the laudisha
[1:13:01] church age and and gave that call of
[1:13:05] come out of her my people. So the eagle
[1:13:08] anointing is actually not an anointing
[1:13:12] for the ladian church age.
[1:13:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; The man's anointing operated the three
[1:13:22] church ages. The eagle anointing came
[1:13:25] and took the church from the the the end
[1:13:30] of the laudish church age into what we
[1:13:32] can call the bride age
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; an eternal age
[1:13:38] the age of the open the open book.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; now? So
[1:13:49] so uh uh yeah then go back go back to
[1:13:51] the to to that. I I thought that using
[1:13:55] the the the parad will will explain it
[1:13:58] better. Let's go back to the next
[1:14:00] picture now. So So uh okay. Yeah. Yes.
[1:14:02] The man's anointing here uh uh that uh
[1:14:07] was over the you know the the three
[1:14:10] church ages. The eagle's anointing come
[1:14:13] at the end of the age
[1:14:15] and then uh it goes right into the rest
[1:14:18] of it. Go back to the first picture. Not
[1:14:21] the power of the No, not this one. Okay,
[1:14:24] go back to this one now. So, uh uh we
[1:14:28] talking about the church responding to
[1:14:31] her anointing and she cannot do anything
[1:14:34] else but respond to the anointing that
[1:14:38] is given to us in this age. Now you have
[1:14:42] to know that uh all of these anointing
[1:14:48] all of these anointing
[1:14:50] uh uh
[1:14:54] it is not just
[1:14:56] a feeling you know it's not just a
[1:14:59] feeling that I feel good or you know I
[1:15:01] enjoy the service or no it was it was
[1:15:04] what God gave it was it was the it was
[1:15:07] the power that was given by God to be
[1:15:11] able to fight against the power the evil
[1:15:16] power that was in that age.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so if you go to Revelation
[1:15:25] chapter 6, let's go to Revelation
[1:15:27] chapter 6. While the picture stay up
[1:15:30] there, don't go to the scripture.
[1:15:33] If you have your Bible, you turn there.
[1:15:35] If you don't have your Bible, then
[1:15:36] you're just listening.
[1:15:42] while the picture stays up there.
[1:15:48] Revelation chapter 6.
[1:15:51] Are we together?
[1:15:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6, let's read from
[1:16:02] verse one. And I saw the lamb
[1:16:06] open one of the seal. Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; And I heard
[1:16:14] as it were the noise of thunder
[1:16:19] one of the four beasts. [snorts] Now I'm
[1:16:22] not uh I'm not I'm not adequate to
[1:16:24] represent the lamb, but because I'm
[1:16:26] preaching, let me be the lamb. Okay,
[1:16:30] the lamb the the the the Bible will be
[1:16:33] the seal book. So the lamb open opened
[1:16:37] the seal and John says he heard like a
[1:16:41] thunder but what was thundering was one
[1:16:45] of these anointing that was tonering and
[1:16:48] saying come and see.
[1:16:51] Praise the Lord. So the lamb had the
[1:16:53] book
[1:16:55] the seal book in his hands but it was
[1:16:58] the anointing that was identifying.
[1:17:03] Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; The anointing, that's the reason why
[1:17:07] Bern Brandom says to overcome is to
[1:17:10] identify the enemy in his tricks.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; But it is not you that is identifying.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; You don't have the power.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; You don't have the ability. You don't.
[1:17:23] Sometimes the devil come, he finish
[1:17:24] doing his work before we even know that
[1:17:26] he visited our home.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:31] Remember now Jesus said the enemy comes
[1:17:34] to do what?
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; And destroy.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Now this is this is the Messiah. This is
[1:17:42] our Lord trying to tell us. He comes to
[1:17:45] do that. And because that's what he
[1:17:48] comes TO DO. SO GOD GIVES an anointing
[1:17:51] in an age that will be able to grab him
[1:17:54] right-handed.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; You see? So the lamb opened the book as
[1:18:01] he's opening the book now. So watch now
[1:18:03] is the principle to overcome because we
[1:18:05] cannot overcome in our ability.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; We can only overcome when we hear the
[1:18:12] thunder from the anointing from the
[1:18:14] beast that said come and see.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; If we hear it and we receive it AND THEN
[1:18:21] WE ALSO COME AND SEE. So he said come
[1:18:25] and see.
[1:18:27] And I saw John now representing the
[1:18:32] bride.
[1:18:34] You are John,
[1:18:36] which I'm part of. I'm I'm representing
[1:18:40] the lamb that has the book.
[1:18:43] And the Holy Ghost is the anointing.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in the first three church
[1:18:51] ages was the lion's anointing.
[1:18:56] So when he called and said come and see.
[1:19:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; So John REPRESENTING THE BRIDE, JOHN
[1:19:05] REPRESENTING THE CHURCH RESPONDED TO
[1:19:08] THAT ANOINTING.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When he when they
[1:19:14] responded TO THE ANOINTING, HOW did they
[1:19:16] RESPONDED TO THE ANOINTING? BY BY
[1:19:19] RECOGNIZING THAT BAPTISM IS NOT IN
[1:19:21] FATHER, SON, and holy ghost. Baptism is
[1:19:24] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; That is the way they responded to the
[1:19:30] anointing. THEY IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH
[1:19:33] CHRIST IN their age.
[1:19:38] THEY WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE ONES THAT
[1:19:40] CALL THEMSELVES JEWS and they were n.
[1:19:42] They kicked them out of the church. WHY?
[1:19:45] WHY WERE THEY DOING THAT? THEY WERE
[1:19:47] RESPONDING TO THE anointing of their
[1:19:49] age.
[1:19:52] It's not a guess work.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; It's not a brainstorming work.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; It's a heart that is obedient to the
[1:20:01] word.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Because we know as much as
[1:20:15] we know that as much as this is an
[1:20:18] anointing,
[1:20:20] this is also an anointing.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Just realize that this is an anointing.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; It's a very strong anointing.
[1:20:29] This is the This is the SPIRIT THAT
[1:20:32] PLANTED THE TRINITARIAN DOCTRINE THAT IS
[1:20:34] SO HARD TO GET RID OF.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL THE REVIVAL AND ALL THE MEN
[1:20:40] THAT GOD HAS RAISED UP, THEY HAVE NOT
[1:20:42] BEEN ABLE TO REALLY REALIZE THAT A SEED
[1:20:46] was planted.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; It's an anointing.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] So it is not how I feel or because you
[1:20:59] know I I I really feel good.
[1:21:02] This can also make you feel good.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; It can also make you feel good.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; How do we respond to the anointing of
[1:21:20] our age? Bring it back to the word.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Bring it back to the word. Let it line
[1:21:26] up with the word.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Not what the church says and what uh the
[1:21:31] bishop said, but let it line up with the
[1:21:33] word.
[1:21:35] That is the way we respond to our
[1:21:37] anointing.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] So we see here
[1:21:58] the lamb held the book. The anointing
[1:22:01] said come and see. This was what said
[1:22:03] come and see for the first three ages.
[1:22:06] This was what said come and see for the
[1:22:09] dark age.
[1:22:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the people
[1:22:15] hear the anointing and they and they
[1:22:18] responded to the anointing, the
[1:22:20] anointing anoint them for the age.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; So you see the whole thing there is that
[1:22:27] God is weaping away our abilities.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; HE WANT US TO FULLY trust in him.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Come with me.
[1:22:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; COME WHAT MAY. HE WANT US TO FULLY TRUST
[1:22:48] IN HIM. NO MATTER WHAT WE ARE DEALING
[1:22:50] WITH, NO MATTER WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND
[1:22:52] US,
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; we have a city of refuge.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; We have a city of refuge. I think it was
[1:23:03] brother brother Farmer that was saying
[1:23:04] that and that was beautiful. It's true.
[1:23:07] The city of refuge
[1:23:12] was well maintained.
[1:23:16] It was wellmaintained.
[1:23:18] The roads were bigger.
[1:23:23] The bridge were taken care of every
[1:23:26] year.
[1:23:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And they even hide gas. They had gas on
[1:23:36] the road on on the road of the city of
[1:23:39] the refuge to be able to help a man that
[1:23:42] was running.
[1:23:44] A man that needed help.
[1:23:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; They have people that were posted on the
[1:23:51] cider TO HELP HIM GET there quickly.
[1:23:56] Is that not what the cherub beans are
[1:23:58] doing to guide us to the tree of life to
[1:24:00] help him get there quickly? Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; The road was clean that there will be no
[1:24:04] obstacle. There will BE NOTHING TO STOP
[1:24:06] US TO RUN FOR HELP WHEN we need help
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; because God is not depending on your
[1:24:12] ability.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; He want you to trust him.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; The church responding
[1:24:28] to her to her anointing that she can do
[1:24:30] nothing.
[1:24:32] Like I said in previous service,
[1:24:37] we are under the influence of this
[1:24:40] anointing. When brother Brandon preached
[1:24:42] the message influence for many years,
[1:24:45] for many years and even till now
[1:24:48] when we when we read the message
[1:24:50] influence, we preach the message
[1:24:52] influence. We only look at the influence
[1:24:54] of Yuzia on Isaiah. We don't look at the
[1:24:58] influence of the angels.
[1:25:02] The influence of Yuzia on Isaiah that
[1:25:05] was the first influence he was under
[1:25:08] that his natural birth influence.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; UNDER OUR NATURAL BIRTH WE ARE UNDER the
[1:25:14] influence of our parents, the influence
[1:25:16] of our bus, the influence of culture,
[1:25:19] the influence OF A TRIBE, WHATEVER it
[1:25:21] is. BUT WHEN ISAIAH CAME INTO THE
[1:25:25] TEMPLE,
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; HE WAS UNDER ANOTHER INFLUENCE. [snorts]
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. HE GOT UNDER THE
[1:25:31] INFLUENCE OF THE ANGELS. HE SAYS THE
[1:25:34] DREAM FILLED THE TEMPLE AND I mean he
[1:25:37] WAS SO CAUGHT UP LEFT THE EARTH CAUGHT
[1:25:40] UP IN THE MIDST OF THOSE angels because
[1:25:42] he was under their influence. It
[1:25:44] affected him so much he said won't talk
[1:25:48] a code of fire and come and touch. So
[1:25:50] you see we we we just stick on that and
[1:25:53] and we talk about influence of one man
[1:25:55] on upon another and AND IT JUST SO BOUND
[1:25:58] BUT WE don't really see the the the
[1:26:01] LESSON THAT BROTHER BRANDON WAS TRYING
[1:26:02] to bring to us that THERE WAS A CHANGE
[1:26:05] OF INFLUENCE.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; There is A TIME IN OUR LIFE WHERE GOD
[1:26:09] TAKE US FROM A NATURAL INFLUENCE AND HE
[1:26:12] BRINGS US on a supernatural influence.
[1:26:14] the influence of the word.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; We are under the influence of seven
[1:26:26] angels. We are not under a man
[1:26:28] influence.
[1:26:30] He can be a bishop, A PASTOR, OR WHOEVER
[1:26:32] he is. We are under the INFLUENCE OF
[1:26:35] THOSE ANGELIC BEINGS
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; THAT open the seals
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; that reveal the word.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Until you give us the word, we will not
[1:26:44] be satisfied.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; DON'T GIVE US YOUR ideas or your
[1:26:47] feelings. JUST SEND US BACK TO THE WORD.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Because that's the influence the bride
[1:26:52] is honor.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful Jesus.
[1:27:11] What an awesome God we serve.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; What an awesome God we serve
[1:27:23] in the message. Junction of time. You
[1:27:25] can take take the picture from there.
[1:27:26] Keep it. We'll use it another time.
[1:27:33] Junction of time. Brother Brandham says
[1:27:35] and he says now the church today
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; is now only having miracles.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; But sad enough that's what the church
[1:27:45] want. The church only want to have
[1:27:47] miracles.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; But he says we're not only having
[1:27:50] miracles but we are miracles ourself.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; It's not only having miracles but is
[1:27:59] preparing for a miracle. And that is the
[1:28:02] coming of the Lord. and the rapture of
[1:28:04] the church to be taken up. Give me the
[1:28:07] church ready.
[1:28:10] Visualize to see the signs and and and
[1:28:13] to see the unimportant God, the great
[1:28:16] power of God moving among the people
[1:28:20] which the rapture
[1:28:22] will be an easy thing when Jesus come.
[1:28:27] It will be an easy thing. Praise the
[1:28:30] Lord. But then see see where the catch
[1:28:32] is here because because if it is said
[1:28:35] that to see the signs and the
[1:28:37] unimportant of God and the great power
[1:28:39] of God moving among the people we always
[1:28:43] think that great power of God is it just
[1:28:45] something happen that would just be
[1:28:46] making us to be jumping up. That great
[1:28:49] power of God is what's sustaining you
[1:28:51] every day
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; as you go out into this world with all
[1:28:55] the evil, the nastiness that is out
[1:28:58] there is that great power of God that is
[1:29:00] keeping you.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; He says that's why the rapture will be
[1:29:07] easy
[1:29:11] because we have come to the
[1:29:13] acknowledgement that he is the one that
[1:29:15] is keeping me.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Where I get the strength from to get
[1:29:21] back to church, he is the one.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Where I get the strength from to do the
[1:29:25] things that I know is right to do, he is
[1:29:27] the one.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Is that great power of God in
[1:29:30] simplicity?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful Jesus.
[1:29:42] What a blessed Jesus. Let's look at a
[1:29:46] quote here in in paradise.
[1:29:48] [clears throat]
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; And what is it?
[1:30:01] What is it? Christ coming
[1:30:05] to his body. Christ is the word. Amen.
[1:30:10] We all know the anointing is Christ
[1:30:14] [snorts]
[1:30:16] that comes to that comes on the word
[1:30:21] that makes the word live.
[1:30:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Simple example. Jesus was born the word
[1:30:32] and that word was a virgin shall
[1:30:34] conceive. Are we together? On the river
[1:30:38] Jordan, Christ came upon the word.
[1:30:45] You see the picture?
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; John said, "I see a dove
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; landing on him." So Christ came upon a
[1:30:51] word to take the word into his
[1:30:55] commission.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; But he was born the word.
[1:31:05] A virgin shall conceive. was the word.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; But before he could go into his
[1:31:12] ministry, Christ must come upon the word
[1:31:15] to make the word live.
[1:31:31] You will realize the Bible says uh uh he
[1:31:34] will be called Jesus.
[1:31:38] He never put Christ in.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] to take away the sins of the word is a
[1:31:52] part that he will be f fulfilled that he
[1:31:55] will fulfill but before he fulfilled
[1:31:57] that he needed the word needed to be
[1:32:00] anointed
[1:32:02] the word need an anointing
[1:32:05] is the same way that there was a word
[1:32:07] that was spoken for this age and God
[1:32:10] says I will get a bride without spot or
[1:32:13] wrinkle. The word was there. Praise the
[1:32:16] Lord.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will call out a people from out
[1:32:20] of the Gentiles. That is the word. That
[1:32:22] is a prophecy from Amos. Amos started
[1:32:25] prophesying about that before even the
[1:32:27] the the disciple came along and took it.
[1:32:31] Hallelujah.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And it's that word that has fleshed us
[1:32:35] out.
[1:32:37] We believe the message. We believe that
[1:32:39] yeah, there there's a gentile bride. But
[1:32:42] for that word to now goes into action,
[1:32:45] you need to be anointed.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says we
[1:32:51] agreeing we must still HONOR THE SON SO
[1:32:53] we can be repping.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; So the word the the anointing of the
[1:33:00] word will make the the life of Christ in
[1:33:03] you.
[1:33:04] We will not be going out looking for our
[1:33:06] own firm and and and and and you know uh
[1:33:08] uh praises of men but it will be
[1:33:11] everything of Christ.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; We know that the word that makes uh he
[1:33:19] says that we know that we we we all know
[1:33:23] the anointing is Christ that comes on
[1:33:26] the word that makes the word live. Is
[1:33:28] that right?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; That is the anointing. Christ is the
[1:33:32] anointing, the spirit that comes upon
[1:33:36] the word that quickens the word.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; To make it live. Now
[1:33:44] the word is in your heart.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; You believe in divine healing. You
[1:33:50] believe in rapture. You believe in
[1:33:53] sanctified life, overcoming life. The
[1:33:55] word is in your heart. Whatever more see
[1:33:59] Christ the anointing comes upon his
[1:34:02] body.
[1:34:03] The connection there. He is the head. We
[1:34:06] are the body. So Christ the anointing
[1:34:09] comes upon the body.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; To quicken the word that has been
[1:34:16] prophesied for us
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; in our day.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. the word that has been
[1:34:23] prophesied for us in in in our lives.
[1:34:27] So Christ comes upon it just like
[1:34:30] husband and wife told become one. Now
[1:34:34] the church has got has got to get to the
[1:34:38] ministry until the church and Christ
[1:34:41] become one. He can anoint you for every
[1:34:46] blessing that's in the Bible
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; is all yours. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Everything is promised at this age is
[1:34:56] yours.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; When we when we leave anything out, then
[1:35:03] if anointing strikes that, it will
[1:35:06] anoint it.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; What? What? What an awesome God. Are you
[1:35:15] Are you getting the picture?
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture? There is
[1:35:20] there is that's the reason why we can't
[1:35:22] hurry the rapture. The rapture is not an
[1:35:24] escape plan.
[1:35:27] No, it's not an escape plan. It's not to
[1:35:30] escape temptation.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I just wish the rapture come now. It's
[1:35:34] not going to come with it.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Because it's not an escape route. No,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; it's it's it's another program. It's a
[1:35:46] wonderful thing.
[1:35:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing because in God's
[1:35:53] mind, the rapture is the vehicle that
[1:35:57] takes us to the reception.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; It's the vehicle that takes and that's
[1:36:05] what the bride waits for. She wants to
[1:36:08] for everybody to see her leaving.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody stand in the parking lot
[1:36:14] and just see them leaving.
[1:36:19] So it's not an escape something
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; that we have to be craving for the
[1:36:23] rapture so we can get up from here or
[1:36:25] tire with this word. No,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; it's a beautiful thing.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Whether we are alive, whether we we are
[1:36:35] dead, praise the Lord, for the dead in
[1:36:37] Christ will rise first and we all will
[1:36:40] partake of the beauty of the rapture.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:48] Are we together?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; I mean that's that's that's where you
[1:36:58] will realize uh the the the power that
[1:37:00] is invested in you or the power that
[1:37:02] been lied in you d by all of these years
[1:37:07] because finally we we will have the
[1:37:09] power to overcome sin.
[1:37:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Watch the church. Honor her anointing.
[1:37:26] She can do nothing.
[1:37:29] Let's
[1:37:30] let's take this thought also from the
[1:37:33] word is falling apart.
[1:37:35] Now, anything that pulls you away from
[1:37:38] that is wrong. Anything that pulls you
[1:37:41] away from the word is wrong.
[1:37:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:46] That's a false messiah. That's a false
[1:37:48] anointing.
[1:37:54] Pray. Oh, he said the brother has such
[1:37:57] an anointing. What kind of an anointing
[1:37:59] it was?
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; You have to realize
[1:38:04] uh the Bible says that uh uh Jews
[1:38:07] brought this out. He says Coran and
[1:38:09] Dton, they were men that that have the
[1:38:12] anointing of a gainser.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; A gainser is is a is a person that can
[1:38:20] that can convince the whole crowd just
[1:38:22] just by one speech.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Logical.
[1:38:27] Praise the Lord. Logical. It's logical.
[1:38:30] What what they were saying is logical.
[1:38:33] We are also Levites.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; We are Levites. Kora was a Levite.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Dayton was a Levite.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; They are saying we are Levite. Moses and
[1:38:44] Aaron are Levite. Why should be them
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; and not us? Is it not logical?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; If we are all children of Levites, we
[1:38:53] must all be equal.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THEIR ARGUMENT.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; WELL, everything is just Moses and
[1:39:02] Aaron. Moses and Aaron.
[1:39:08] That was convincing.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; But it cost the life of millions of
[1:39:16] people.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Because the earth opened
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; and swallowed them up.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; So they had an anointing.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; I mean to be able to convince half of
[1:39:28] the camp,
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; it takes an anointing. It just does not
[1:39:33] take a a sweet talking.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; So that what I'm saying is that just
[1:39:43] like there is an anointing here for us
[1:39:46] to respond to, there is also an
[1:39:48] anointing to distract us.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There is an anointing
[1:39:55] here for us to to respond to, FOR US TO
[1:39:58] RELY ON. BUT THERE IS also an anointing
[1:40:01] working among us to distract us.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; You see what kind of anointing it is? He
[1:40:19] said Hitler had an anointing. All of
[1:40:22] this man uh uh Pope Pas had an
[1:40:24] anointing. What kind of an anointing you
[1:40:26] got?
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; If it's not anointed with the word and
[1:40:32] vindicated and vindicate every word to
[1:40:35] be true, leave it alone.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; So what is he simply saying? Bring it
[1:40:40] back to the word.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Don't fall for the feelings.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Bring it back to the
[1:40:49] word.
[1:40:54] Are we together?
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; So we that's I mean that's that's
[1:41:06] exactly where we are. That's where we
[1:41:09] are.
[1:41:10] The church responded. If you if you look
[1:41:13] here, you go back to that quote. Brother
[1:41:15] Bon did not say the church responded. He
[1:41:18] said the church responded.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; I'm using it in the present tense
[1:41:24] because we are here. But with God is
[1:41:27] something that have already happened.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; The church responded to her to her
[1:41:34] anointing and she could do nothing else.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; So there is a people.
[1:41:42] There's a people. That's there there's a
[1:41:44] word. That's the reason why with with
[1:41:46] with all the million pieces of different
[1:41:48] doctrines that have come up all the
[1:41:50] different teachings that God always find
[1:41:53] a way
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; either by taking the false teacher from
[1:41:57] off the scene. For a while the people
[1:41:59] will get confused, they will be
[1:42:01] discouraged. There is some that will
[1:42:02] backslide. They will leave.
[1:42:06] And after a while there will be some
[1:42:09] that will be craving
[1:42:11] to get back to church.
[1:42:15] to get back to the word.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; You know the story with Elea
[1:42:24] and Rebecca. Elea spoke so much about
[1:42:28] Isaac.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; HE SPOKE SO MUCH ABOUT ISAAC that just
[1:42:35] in that time when when when Rebecca said
[1:42:38] according to THE SCRIPTURE, WHO IS THAT
[1:42:40] ON the field? She never saw Eliza any
[1:42:44] animal in the picture.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; AND I BELIEVE THAT GOD will take all
[1:42:53] these main images from us.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; And our focus is going to be on Christ.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; He can be your favorite pastor that you
[1:43:04] ready to die for. God will have to make
[1:43:06] sure that he take your face from him and
[1:43:09] keep your eyes on Christ. Amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; HE SPOKE SO MUCH ABOUT Isaac until from
[1:43:23] a distance she could recognize him.
[1:43:27] Praise the Lord. From a distance, SHE
[1:43:29] HAD A VEIL OVER HER FACE, but she could
[1:43:32] still recognize him.
[1:43:36] And I believe that's what God is doing.
[1:43:38] I believe that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:43:40] doing.
[1:43:41] This bride
[1:43:43] is anointed
[1:43:45] to respond to her anointing
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; and she can't do anything else.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why I encourage you
[1:43:56] all the time.
[1:43:58] Watch what God is doing in your life.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; In your life.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Don't think about what you used to be.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; That's a dead hero. That's right.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; That hero is there. And we're talking
[1:44:13] about present time. What the word is
[1:44:15] doing in your life.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; What is he taking you to?
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; How is he dealing with you?
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; How is he dealing with you?
[1:44:41] The more you start putting attention to
[1:44:43] that, the more you will see that the
[1:44:46] curtains will start falling.
[1:44:49] The curtains will start falling
[1:44:52] and he's going to pull you right into
[1:44:54] his presence.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see that that's the reason why
[1:45:00] I struggle with the saying when people
[1:45:01] say, "Let me invite the presence of the
[1:45:03] Lord." You can't. You can't. He is the
[1:45:05] one that is inviting you. How can you
[1:45:08] invite somebody to their house?
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; I go to your house, I get there before
[1:45:14] you, brother Peterson, you come as if
[1:45:15] brother, you welcome to your house.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; How can you invite somebody? He is the
[1:45:21] one that is inviting us.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; As we come into his presence, he's
[1:45:26] inviting us.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He said, "Come in more.
[1:45:30] Come and see more."
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; He's inviting you into his presence.
[1:45:37] HE JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST SIT THERE
[1:45:39] AND AND AND just be observing. Feel
[1:45:42] free. Move around. There's more room you
[1:45:46] can enter in.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN GO BEHIND THE VEIL.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; He just don't want you to sit. He want
[1:46:03] you to participate. Amen.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; We want you to move around. Ask
[1:46:07] question. What is this picture?
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; What does it mean?
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Ask picture. Ask question. Move around
[1:46:14] and and express the liberty.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; I saw this in the word and uh I you said
[1:46:21] this and I mean I I couldn't get the
[1:46:23] connection. Ask question. Just don't sit
[1:46:25] down there and just and just be
[1:46:27] satisfied to be preached to.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; NO. GET IN the word.
[1:46:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; That when you get out in and they ask
[1:46:44] you, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was I was at his
[1:46:46] house and how does it look?" Well, I
[1:46:47] mean, everything
[1:46:49] everything uh I went to his house
[1:46:51] before, he had, you know, I don't even
[1:46:53] know what that thing mean. I don't know
[1:46:54] what this thing mean and I don't know
[1:46:56] what that thing mean.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:01] talking to somebody in the weekend. I
[1:47:03] trying to give them a picture for them
[1:47:06] to see,
[1:47:08] you know, the the the church that's
[1:47:11] that's that those are some of the things
[1:47:12] that I say Catholicism has has really
[1:47:16] affected us because you find people they
[1:47:19] come to church and then after a while
[1:47:22] they get they get uh they tickle things.
[1:47:27] This is uh I mean u uh nobody come
[1:47:31] nobody nobody of that church ever come
[1:47:33] to visit me.
[1:47:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody come to visit me you know
[1:47:40] and uh the people there I mean you know
[1:47:44] the tip of it.
[1:47:47] Now there are two ways you can look at
[1:47:49] everything. Praise the Lord.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:56] But the thing about it then is that our
[1:47:59] thing is our responsibility.
[1:48:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Here and wherever you go, it's your
[1:48:06] responsibility to go after what they
[1:48:09] believe.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; What is it all about?
[1:48:16] Because because if you unless unless you
[1:48:20] are just passing by and you just if you
[1:48:22] want to make the place home there is
[1:48:25] your responsibility.
[1:48:27] Don't sit back and say well you know
[1:48:29] they should come because that's what the
[1:48:32] church denomination does because we just
[1:48:35] want your presence
[1:48:37] or why were you not in church? We didn't
[1:48:41] see you this Sunday.
[1:48:44] we really miss you. And that just all
[1:48:47] the conversation stopped. Well, you
[1:48:50] know, I never came to church because of
[1:48:51] this reason or because of that reason.
[1:48:53] It just there is no fellowship.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; There is no word in it.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; There is no word.
[1:49:03] We are just campaigning.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; There just we're just campaigning
[1:49:10] looking for members.
[1:49:12] There is no there is really no word in
[1:49:14] it. I will think that it's our
[1:49:16] responsibility
[1:49:18] to be able to go after
[1:49:21] and says I really want TO GET TO THE
[1:49:23] BOTTOM OF THIS. WHY? WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
[1:49:25] SAY I MEAN WHY THEY ALWAYS SAY BROTHER
[1:49:26] Brandham say what is that all about?
[1:49:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHY WHY THEY YOU KNOW why their
[1:49:37] their women dress this way or their men
[1:49:39] dress this way. While the service is
[1:49:41] ordered like that, it's not like every
[1:49:42] other church. It is our responsibility
[1:49:45] to go after and know those things.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; I was wanting to come to my defense a
[1:50:06] little bit, but I'll leave it.
[1:50:09] I'll leave it for another time. Praise
[1:50:11] the Lord. Because if you ever get mad in
[1:50:14] your mind and says, "Why I don't visit
[1:50:16] you?" I mean, you better understand they
[1:50:18] are tough.
[1:50:20] It has to be for the reason. I would
[1:50:23] love to do it. I would love to do it,
[1:50:25] but they have to be for the reason
[1:50:28] because every just a whole lot. I'll
[1:50:31] just leave you as that. [clears throat]
[1:50:34] I love my brother who says I love to
[1:50:35] visit you and just sit down and talk to
[1:50:38] you, you know, and just spend the whole
[1:50:39] day with you, but uh uh just have to do
[1:50:46] I want you to just make the list,
[1:50:50] make the list, have the question, call
[1:50:52] me some of me. I will show up. If I
[1:50:56] don't have an answer, I will tell you.
[1:50:58] We'll look for it. Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; And it will help me also. help me for me
[1:51:04] to grow.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; But the church is responding to her
[1:51:10] anointing. You have to realize this and
[1:51:12] you cannot do anything else.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Whatever is happening like brother
[1:51:17] Brandon said, Christ is the ministry of
[1:51:18] God revealed. Whatever is happening
[1:51:20] around your life that you're not
[1:51:21] understanding is God pulling you to that
[1:51:24] place for you to respond to the
[1:51:26] anointing of your diet.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; And you have to pay attention to that.
[1:51:37] You may not seem like you are in your
[1:51:39] best form. It might not look like you
[1:51:42] are over spiritual.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; But go to your motive and objective.
[1:51:46] Search your heart.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Do you still love the Lord?
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; If there is if there is if there is that
[1:51:52] thing there, then there is a deep that
[1:51:55] is down there that is calling to the
[1:51:57] deep.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; And sure, there is a deep to
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; the Lord bless you. That's musicians you
[1:52:03] can come.
[1:52:06] [applause]
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come.
[1:52:21] That's the reason why I can't wait for
[1:52:23] us to for us to be able to build our
[1:52:25] church and just have a fellowship hall.
[1:52:27] Amen. we can be able to spend just
[1:52:29] enough time and get to know one another
[1:52:31] over meal. That's a good place to know
[1:52:33] one another. Over meal. Praise the Lord.
[1:52:36] And I'm sure the Lord will be able to
[1:52:38] give it to us. Amen. Let's sing that
[1:52:40] song we sang on Wednesday night. Uh uh

[2:01:50] Amen.
[2:01:52] Last while
[2:02:10] there's two scriptures [music] that came
[2:02:12] to my mind.
[2:02:14] In lamentation, the Bible says that his
[2:02:17] mercy is renewed every morning.
[2:02:20] And uh and then I talk taught also how
[2:02:24] the ego renew her strength. So I was
[2:02:26] dwelling on the word renew as I was just
[2:02:29] meditating on the Lord and it just
[2:02:32] [music] break to my mind that every day
[2:02:34] when God give us new mercy that is
[2:02:38] strength [music] that he has given you.
[2:02:40] He has renew your strength
[2:02:44] every day. He gave us [music] new mercy.
[2:02:48] Praise the Lord. And mercy is what we
[2:02:51] don't deserve. [music]
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God gave you that to be your
[2:02:57] strength
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; to realize that every what whatever was
[2:03:02] the foolishness you did before the the
[2:03:04] day yesterday, he comes down. [music] He
[2:03:06] gave [singing] you new mercy.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; To give you strength for you to trust
[2:03:10] him. To give you strength to face your
[2:03:13] day. To give you strength to [music]
[2:03:15] come back to him. Amen.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Every new mercy,
[2:03:21] the Lord renew your strength.
[2:03:25] Showers of blessing.
[2:03:32] Show [singing and music] us a blessing
[2:03:35] with me.
