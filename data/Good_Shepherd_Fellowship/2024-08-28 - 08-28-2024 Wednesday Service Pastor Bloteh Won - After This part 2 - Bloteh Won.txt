thank you Lord amen thank you Father praise the Lord amen amen thank you musicians let's take our Bibles tonight praise the Lord and I want to go back and read from Revelation chapter 4 verse one again that's where we read from and uh if we don't spend much time preaching tonight we will we bring praise at the end of the service praise the Lord amen once again we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Revelation chapter 4 verse one Revelation CH 4 verse1 we read from year on Sunday we want to come back and uh uh really didn't have the the opportunity to to preach what was on our heart but we preach in a way amen and I hope that it was a blessing to you praise the Lord amen after this I look and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice I heard which I heard was as it word of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter the Lord bless you you can have your seat praise the Lord amen love the Lord tonight praise the Lord amen Luke chapter 1 Luke chapter 1 if you want to look there with me tonight there's something that uh uh that we all know but I was just looking at it some sometime last week and uh I just want us to just uh share that with you Luke chapter 1 there are some few things that I saw in Luke chapter one and uh uh now to take much of the time you know the story let's look at verse 15 Luke chap 1 verse 15 if we go back a little bit in verse 13 it will it will help us to to be able to catch up in t year and the angel said unto him that's the angel Gabriel speaking to Zacharias fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shall call his name John and thou shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he said oh I think um um uh okay and and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb that's that's completely off of word I wanted to read but Verse 18 let's drop down to verse 18 verse 18 is where uh wanted to grab your attention tonight and Zachariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know this for I am an old man and my wife well stricken in years praise the Lord the angel have just announced the birth of John the Baptist praise the Lord and Zacharias is asking whereby shall I know this now this is an Earnest question Let's uh let's let's let's go down in the same uh uh let's go down in the same chapter 1 verse 30 the same angel that spoke to Jo to Zacharias is now speaking to Mary verse 30 and the angel said unto her the angel Gabriel said unto Mary fear not Mery for thou H found favor with God and behold thou shall conceive in the womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus praise the Lord verse 34 and then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man praise the Lord Zacharias is questioning the angel Mary is questioning the angel praise the Lord is that right is that how you understand it whereby shall I know this that's what Zachariah said and Mary said how shall this be is that not pretty much the same question Amen in all fairness is that not the same question praise the Lord but why did they anger turned zachariah's uh took zachariah's speech that he couldn't speak and the angel answer Mary her question now what I want to bring you to tonight is to get you from all your theological answers that you know what I want to bring you to tonight is to help us to see is only God that has the skill to weigh our earnesty praise the Lord every man in their own eyes and in their own ways are earnest praise the Lord when we do things that we do we try to do it to the best of of our earnesty and our sincerity but it is only God that weigh the spirit of an Earnest heart and it's only God also that knows when you are doubting him no matter how much we think we have faith no matter how much we think we believe whatever we believe is only God that knows when you are doubting him praise the Lord do you see where I'm going tonight because I mean we can we can get in the scripture oh Zachariah had a lot of examples we can go that route but that's not where I'm going tonight where I'm going tonight is to help us to see that as the heaven is higher than the earth asai said there so are God thoughts higher than our thoughts so are his ways higher than our ways the way God look at issue completely different from the way we look at issue praise the Lord and he's the Supreme judge when you when you look at it actually you realize that just like I said that's an Earnest question that Zachariah asks praise the Lord but God determined that even though his question was Earnest but God could pick up in his spirit that he was doubting and he was fearful because what did the angel said fear not amen the angel sensed the spirit of fear and said fear not praise the Lord but even more than that that's the same thing the angel said to Mary fear that I believe because uh the presence of the Angel is uh is uh uh is awesome okay terrifying let me if if if that's the right word to say uh it's it's overwhelming praise the Lord but if you if you look at that you know we can we can look at mared and says uh you know uh uh uh what she was going to be experienced has never been experienced before praise the Lord it has never been experienced for the young woman to to to be conceived without knowing a man what Zacharias have experienced has been experienced before praise the Lord so in one sense it gave us an idea that when when when God judge our earnesty or he looks at our fears he looks at our doubt it it makes us to see that he's looking through the eye of his word he's looking through the eye of his word are you looking at his word are you looking at his promises or you are looking at your condition because Zacharias had lot of example that God has done in his word he was not in the days of Abraham but he had a Torah that recorded Abraham that recorded Rebecca that recalled Rachel and all of those people Hanah all of those things zachariah's uh uh had he he had a record of those things are you seeing where I'm going tonight praise the Lord our questions sometimes are earnest questions but where are we looking where are we drawing our questions from it said from the media it say from the pressure of society it say even from the pressure of our sinful nature that we asking God oh God when Lord when when will you bless me Lord when will you do where are we drawing praise the Lord but again we have to realize that uh it's God just like Hanah said you know you go and read Hanah prophecy that in 1 Samuel she said God Waits The Spirit of man is God that weigh the spirit of man we can cry to God we can you know but he knows the intents of our heart praise the Lord he knows where you are drawing from the question on your mind where are you drawing it from your fears your doubt he knows where you are drawing it from right from the scripture yeah we can see that uh uh Zachariah question was from his age he look at his age praise the Lord you look at his wife condition are we together so I mean we just we just came out of a uh uh a little prayer meeting tonight so I just thought to encourage you uh when we pray it is not all about what we say to God but where are we drawing our thoughts from what is influencing our burden they say fear are we counting God able you see because it is some of those things that Inspire us to say the things that you say before God is where you are drawing where your mind is are you looking through the promise you know brother BR says you know we must apply the token with our prayer what does that mean bring your prayer through the word Place God's worthy for him Lord this is your promise this is what you said I believe it but I'm waiting for you to bring it to pass in my life and you could ask God that same question but your mind could be challenging God are you Lord are you able to keep your word are you seeing what I'm going with it with it Lord your word ISS this your lord your word say that this is why your word ISS but your actual thought behind that you are asking God can you keep your word and in that way is doubt it's fear you are limiting God and there are there are hundreds of example in the world where God has kept his promise but yet you could be saying the same thing to God believing that H uh like like like the book of Hebrews said Paul said uh uh uh uh counting God able you are counting God able that he's able to will keep his word no matter what I'm going through no matter what my struggle is your word is truth if there's a problem is not your word it's me praise the Lord if there is a problem is not your word at all it's not what is written in the Bible it's not what the prophet said in the message it is me are we together praise the Lord there's a whole lot we could bring out of uh Luke chapter 1 but I'll keep it for the another day praise the Lord I'll keep it for the another day I just wanted to stir up your faith tonight you know encourage you a little bit you know there when we come come to pray is it's not just the multitudes of words that we say before the Lord but we got to get our hearts right that is the most important thing you got to get your heart right you got to get your thoughts right praise the Lord you see because clearly before we even ask he knows what we want to ask for so what is he watching for the right attitude he's watching for the right attitude praise the Lord are we together okay so we we studied a little bit from Revelation chapter 4 on Sunday and that's where we read our our Opening Our uh scripture tonight and uh uh just like I said uh you know I'm I'm I'm not a I'm not a teacher and I I don't want to go I always try not to go in the way of teaching because whenever you go by the way of teaching you bring too much information amen that's what teaching does you give people information but you see it is it's completely different when you are training people you train them to apply the information that is that they have amen and that's what adoption is order about is is the tutor the Holy Ghost training us to put the word into action praise the Lord to put the word into action so uh uh Sunday we were talking on uh Revelation chapter 4 uh after this and we identified that that uh uh that was uh after the church ages amen John speak and says after this after the church ages and uh uh there was a door open in heaven which of course we tried to to help us to see through the word that uh it was not a physical door even though it was a vision that John was in but uh uh that door that was open was a further Revelation because at the end of the verse he says I will show thee things which must be Hereafter you see that so it is it was a further Revelation the door that was open was a further Revelation John was going to get further Revelation and the further Revelation was going to be about who Jesus because the book is the revelation of Jesus Christ are we together amen now when you when you when you when you begin to see it like that you will you will you will understand why the seals is Jesus you will understand why the trumpet everything go back to Jesus praise the Lord you will understand why uh uh uh the the the red dragon in Revelation chapter 12 wanted to to uh uh destroy the child because what is that is the enemy coming against the revelation of Jesus Christ praise the Lord so if you see there and a a it help us so so the open door year was a further revelation of Jesus I will read something to you that's what I want to d d tonight but just to be able to recap and and refresh your mind praise the Lord you know I I I heard something that was that was very beautiful uh uh uh someone said he says uh uh if you look if you look in the corporate word you look in the corporate word whenever whenever uh uh the secretary or whenever uh a person was called upon by their bus you know uh and the bus says I want to see you let's meet at 12:00 in the Corp word uh uh you will always see that you always see that people goes to the bus office with a pen and paper have you noticed that yes they always go to the bus office with a pen and paper why because they are expecting either uh uh assignment or they are expecting uh uh uh uh no matter what no matter what the conversation is they are always on expectation to be able to to not leave their place and forget about what was said praise the Lord amen and uh uh you know as we as we gravitate towards the the the technology age you know uh it it is it tails on every one of us you know it tells on every one of us why because it's easy a person can say well the service is online I I I'll wash it again I can was it 20 times praise the Lord but you see the thing there is there the uh you should realize that you are coming in the presence of the bus amen he's the king of kings and while the preacher could be saying something and not not uh even knowing how the bus is speaking to you he could give you a direct instruction or he could speak something to your heart that maybe you go back and listen to the service 20 times you might not pick it up again praise the Lord and uh uh uh I mean even even uh uh let me just say this I get into my into my even sometimes you know you you realize that people that that you know that have they have grown in their prayer life they always go to pray with a with a paper either they carry it a list something they want to say to the Lord or they expect that he will say something to them praise the Lord amen and when they are praying and and and God bless them with a thought they don't feel embarrassed to to write it down and go right back into pray many times people that have not grown in their prayer life see there to be very troubling I'm in the spirit now you know they are in the spirit they don't want to cut the spirit because they are feeling it oh you know they are getting ginger in prayer but sometimes the Lord is speaking to them and then when you come from out of that you can't remember what it was oh I was thinking about something oh man something was beautiful on my mind and you just can't remember well okay that's just a side note that's just a side note but we we we say here that the open door Jesus in St John chapter 10 identify himself he says I am the door amen he says I am the door so the open door is uh is is a further revelation of Jesus and and we we quote this to you all the time there from the fourth seal if if we want to we just want to read that again so you can just underline that uh uh you know what this is from the four seal we we have read this to you before if God speaks and send you he back up what you say Amen amen see notice if you if you are an ambassador from Heaven All Heaven behind you and Heaven is consisted of the word amen Psalm said his word is settled in heaven praise the Lord his word is settled in heaven so uh the the the open door is a further revelation of Jesus Christ that will go back to the word there would there will not be any revelation of Jesus Christ there will there is there there should not be any Revelation that cannot go back to this word are we together praise the Lord you know we can we can come up with all of these beautiful things but if we cannot bring it back to the word you are standing on sinking sin God is not going to back that there is no Authority behind it it might sound wonderful it might sound fascinating wow wow but there is no Authority behind it praise the Lord so now this is this is what I want to I want to I want to dwell on tonight with a few meanings that is before for me uh pagamos Church age and like I said we are we are just are just going back and and uh rehearsing from uh where we we uh pagamas Church AG I want for you to see this I want for you to see this look carefully now I want for you to see this praise the Lord let's read together yeah in the words he which have the sharp swrl with two Edge lies another revelation of godhead praise the Lord are we together amen I'm I'm trying to to uh bring this in the way so you can see it in these words he which have the the Shar SWR with two Edge last another revelation of the godhead in the Ephesian age you will recall he was set forth as their unchanging God are we together amen so the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Ephesian Church age the way he revealed himself to that church age was their unchanging God Revelation Chapter 2 let's go there Revelation Chapter 2 let's go there maybe after we go around we go around the Lord will bless us then we'll just do a study on the Book of Revelation okay because it looks like I'm not getting away from it but uh I'm trying now to make it one but we are still there praise the Lord are we together now uh Revelation chap 2 verse1 unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things say he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick now this is Jesus identifying himself to the Ephesian Church age he identified himself as the one that holds the Seven Stars in his hands praise the Lord who walth in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick the seventh star is the seven messenger of the seven Church ages amen are we together the seven golden Candlestick is the seven Church ages are we together now so if you go back to what we have just read from the pagamos church age he identified himself in that church age as the unchanging God meaning that the same way he was that that the same way he was experienced in the the the first church age he will be experienced in the seven Church ages the same why because he's holding the Seven Stars and he's holding the seven candlesticks he's the one in the mid of the seven golden candlesticks that's what makes him the unchanging God because he's in the midst of the seven Goen Candlestick we going somewhere tonight that's what I want to bring you now uh uh let's drop down in in in chapter two let's go down a little bit here and uh uh chapter verse 8 chapter 2 ver8 and onto the angel of the church Church in SAR right these things said the first and the last which was dead and is alive praise the Lord are we together the first and the last is the Alpha and the Omega amen the first and the last is the beginning and the end are we together praise the Lord what the principle there is that God will show himself up at the beginning in in in in a mighty move in a mighty man manifestation and and and and during the church age it will looks like his present is gone or his present is dead the same thing in our life in our walk with God you know at at at our birth we see a move of God an experience of God and but there come a period of time where it looks like it's solent it looks like it's a dry year but because he's the Alpha and Omega if he did show up at the beginning he will show up at the end are we together he's the first and the last amen he that was dead and is alive let's go to verse 12 and onto the angel of the Church of pagamas right these things said he which have the sharp swore with two edges now that's what we were reading so he's identifying himself to this age as the sharp edge the sharp sword with two edges amen the word of God is sharper than two edges SW amen now so let's go back to what we were reading from the pagamos church age so you can see where I'm going with this in these words he which had the sharp edge with with uh the sharp sword with two edges lies another revelation of the godhead in the Ephesian Age We recall he was set forth as the unchanged in God having the Seven Stars in the midst of the seven golden Canon State that's how he was set for so he was identified as the unchanging God are we together praise the Lord amen there is no situation that is going to come for God to change he Remains the Same he's the same yesterday today and forever are we together praise the Lord that's how he set for himself now in in the in the seel age we saw him as the one true God and beside him there is there was no other what did we read he's the first and the last amen so that's how he set forth himself in that age watch what I'm going with this tonight now in the pagamas age there is a a further revelation of the godhead now I told you that the open door is a further Revelation so what we are seeing here is that there is always a progressive revelation there is always more of God to know praise praise the Lord there is more of God to know there is more of God to experience are we together there is more of God so we seeing that every age was given one step further God keep bringing his people to a further Revelation because what is he trying to do is to get it from here down here amen he's taking it from just a mental knowledge to a life experience God is not satisfied not enough for you to just know him as the Jehovah of the Old Testament know him by all his seven Redemptive names and is not affecting your life amen if he's not affecting your life he don't know you now see that's the reason why Jesus said many will come to me in that day and said Lord haven't we healed the sick haven't we done he said depart from me I don't know you because we realize that going back to Genesis chapter 3 chapter 4 H uh uh the word no brings us a new sense it brings us an intimate sense the Bible says and Adam knew his wife and she conceived so it's just not enough for us to to to to know how to dress right and know how to no God want to be experienced in our life so he keeps bringing his people to a further Revelation do you see it praise the Lord amen do you see it because when you go back to Revelation chapter 4 and and and and and uh and and we we can we we just read in pagamas we can go down and and read oh praise the lord we can read in the next Church age there the tarit church age what did the tarer church age says that's Verse 18 the angel of the teritorial church a these things said said the Son of God who have his eyes like onto a a flame of fire and his feet like onto a farm BR praise the Lord so you see it's it's all the identification of of the Lord Jesus is Jesus identifying himself praise the Lord Brother Brandon says God gave every age an access to the word a fresh access to the word so it was not just enough to preach paor gospel amen it is not just enough to preach about what happened in the past because he gave us access to himself for us to be able to experience him in present tense are we together in presentence in the changing of our life in the healing of our body praise the Lord amen in miracles in signs so territory at church age what uh uh he identified himself as the son of God there standing you know there the uh uh in a judgment form not not just uh want to take all of the time to look through that then we see here uh as we go down that's uh chapter 3 verse one uh to the side this age these things said the seven seven spirit of God we might we might take time to to be able to go through all of that but what what I wanted to show you because I reference to Revelation chapter 4 being a further Revelation praise the Lord and uh uh uh uh a sister reminded me on Sunday you know most of the time when we speak from Revelation chapter 4 because the the the voice said come up higher we take that in the type of the Rapture because that's what brother Bram said in the church ages after the church age there is nothing left for the church but the Rapture that is just a type are we together it's just a type it's it's it's it's is one phase of Revelation chapter 4 but if you take Revelation chapter 4 in its actual application you'll realize that it will tie us to really tie that to the Rapture it's it's only a type to the Rapture because after the church age is done the only thing that is left for the church is what the Rapture so we can we can type that and say come up higher that is our our leaving the Earth praise the Lord are we together but there are things there in Revelation chapter 4 uh uh just hope that uh uh we can be able to see that tonight okay let's let's continue to read here in pamas church H and uh uh we try to to let you go for tonight praise the Lord so he's showing here that uh uh we we constantly seeing you know uh uh a revelation of the godhead Ephesian you know we recall the unchanging God the s that church age the one true God and none beside him now in the pamos church age there is a further revelation of the godhead set forth by his association with the Shar Edge sharp two Edge swap which is the word of God we know that Hebrews chapter 4 says for the word is quick and Powerful sharper there any two edges who piercing even to the dividing the suer of spirit and soul and to the joints and the marrow and a descender of the thoughts and the intense of the heart Ephesians 6 uh 17 and take the sword of the spirit so we see in here that that that is that is that is that is Christ in every form amen that's the word praise the Lord because we're we're where most of the time our our our our struggle is is that uh uh uh sometimes we get we get we get stuck in uh uh the way we we we understand a subject we have to realize that God is big he's the invisible Spirit one time he fill every space amen every space and it's hard to just put him in a box it's hard to just make him one thing in our brain because you see that's the trouble uh uh uh many times you uh we we we look at things this way and sometimes we are not able to to follow on to see how God is dealing with us praise the Lord amen when he's when he's moving us we we get scar because to us when when we lose that position we will be wrong we will be backsliding we will go to hell you have to realize that he have you in your in his hands and he says no man can pull you out it's not you keeping him he's the one keeping you praise the Lord but you see the danger also on the other side a person can can hold to something and then uh h h h uh when a preacher comes and seees something says oh W I never see that well we just being legalistic and and that's the reason why then pretty soon you run on the Fire end praise the Lord you have to realize just like I said on Sunday we are all growing amen and there is a growth in every stage of our life praise the Lord our growth is not on on how long we've been around the message or how many different churches or different ministers we start honor our growth is seen on how we handleing the word how do you handle the word when you come across a situation that you have not seen praise the Lord how do you handle the world what is your position are you quick to just run the Judgment oh everybody down there they are hypocrite praise the Lord oh you see that's the reason why I love that those good God from Africa they are on fired that's that's what shows our growth praise the Lord amen I'm working on something on growth but uh uh uh uh I might I might bring I'll bring it to you a little bit Yeah because that's that's what it is now John is out of the church ages he's going to have another further Revelation what what what is going to be revealed to him about Christ is going to be completely different from what was in the church ages but it's not going to be contrary to what was in the church ages are you seeing what I'm saying amen let's look at this quickly the uh uh 1 Corinthians 3:16 First Corinthian 3:16 if uh if I'm right in my head here praise the Lord are we together you love the Lord oh my goodness as in First Corinthian I'm over in the Book of Romans uh no I'm I'm off I'm off that's not what I'm looking for that's not what I'm looking for now let me are we together okay I see I see what I'm looking for butth if I want to uh you love the Lord tonight okay I see what I I send you to Corinthian is uh 2 Timothy chapter 3:16 because uh Second Corinthian have another phe of that uh but I won't look we won't look at that tonight let me just let me just bring there to look at there Second Corinthian Me 2 Timothy 3:16 there something that is we are very familiar with all scripture I gave him for inspiration so all scripture are given by inspiration of God and his profitable for Doctrine we have gone over there before reprove correction for instruction in righteousness now this is where I want for you to look at that is in verse 17 that the man of God not the child of God now many times when this scripture is read the man of God is only is pointed to the pastor that the man of God because he's the man of God but all scripture is not only for the pastor all scripture of inspiration ation for correction for for instruction is for every one of us amen but you see it is now for a child so look at look at the sense of the man of God as a grown up person okay a man not a child because we will not be able as a child we will not rightly apply it when when we supposed to use it for correction we could be using it for something else why because we are not grown up yet are we together amen now look at that look at that look at that and uh because sometimes the reason I'm saying all of this is because we are what we eat amen and uh Revelation 10:8 we've been given the book we must eat the book and uh uh uh the message has been given to us so we we can come up to a bride material not for us to be peners amen praise the lord it's it's all coming it's not just uh uh uh uh we are not just a Holiness Church we are more than a Holiness Church amen this is the Bride of Jesus Christ are we together amen look look at uh uh uh Hebrew chapter 5 uh I need to closeup here now tonight was another prayer meeting so I'm I'm all over the place are we together now look at look look at uh verse 12 Hebrew chap 5:12 you should keep these both scripture in your mind because I'm coming back to it again not tonight but another time but I just want you I just want us to keep it in our mind amen now verse 12 the scripture says for for for when fall the time you ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principle of the Oracle of God we shared that with you before teaching is the first Oracle that's the first thing you do to a child you teach them amen teaching is the first Oracle but you see what what uh uh Paul is saying here is that if you go back few verses you will see that Paul was talking about mechis or MEC and he told them there's a whole lot of things I can say to you but I can see that you are not grown up to receive it amen he says we are stayed if you go back if you go back from the beginning of the chapter chapter 4 he's telling them let's let's move on to Perfection we are struggling around baptized in Jesus name and you know I'm baptized in Jesus name you know I'm in the message we we we he says you there are more in the word there are more of God to know there are more that the that the that that this messenger has brought us this spiritual food in due season there is more in it for us to eat then chasing ourself about oh dressing right coming to church on time and and and uh and we are backsliding and and and our prayer life and and we just babies he said for the time when you ought to be teachers when the older ones ought to be teaching the young ones we are fing with the young ones we are criticizing them no we ought to be teachers we ought to know that we all are growing it's not wingking our heads and hting our teeth no being able to pull a a a a a person on your way and and and I mean you can even be able to bring it that they will not even feel a sense of judgment a sense of condemnation for when we ought to be teachers we need to be taught again which are the first principle of the Oracle of God and I become such as have need of milk and not of strong food praise the Lord I mean when we get it we want to talk about the SE we'll just we just have to read you know we come and read quotes and read quotes and read quotes and read quotes just so I I I can prove to you that I'm I'm preaching the message or I'm saying what the prophet said and it just become a bunch of information I can bring 20 quot on just one thing brother Brandon is say we don't need 20 quot we know that when it comes to the word praise the Lord when it comes to the word the messenger gave us what is the word oh no he said that one in 47 in in 63 he said this what what is that if you understand further Revelation you understand if you understand growth you understand how God progressed how Revelation progress the word of God will not be clashing with one another when you see forces and strive and argument is it's a sense of a need of growth are we together the same thing again I didn't even get what I want to say but it's good you love the Lord Revelation chapter 4:1 let's read that again and then we close I was listening to the message of Grace this morning oh my God oh my God I was just saying I was saying Lord Jesus please help us I mean I would just that's another thing let's let's just let's just read Revelation 4:1 and then uh we will we will close here and after this I look and behold a door was open in heaven and the and the first verse which I I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking to me a trumpet talking to me not a trumpet blowing but a trumpet talking to me so that trumpet was not a physical trumpet got physical trumpet don't talk it blow amen so it was as a trumpet talking to me we said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately when that voice spoke immediately immediately that's when the word affect us it take us from looking at F bound things praise the Lord immediately the effect of the word the word has H uh H an immediate effect immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on on the throne praise the Lord amen Heaven consists of the word throne is the Dominion one sat on the throne now so you see another a further Revelation another revelation of Jesus is coming to show us that there is not preer there is nothing like Father Son and the Holy Ghost up there amen it was one throne and one sat on on the throne so you see a further revelation of the godhead are we to are we together amen and he that sat was to look upon like Jasper and s stone and there was a rainbow around the about The Throne inside like onto an emerald now he was the the the Jas part inside is he it's the same thing that was back in the church ages like I said the first and the last because it's it have to do with the 12 Stones the 12 trap of Israel is identifying itself again as the first and the last so saying Jasper and sing Stones should not throw us off as something completely he's he's maintaining his uh his seen identity but in a progressive form praise the Lord why is he using H uh jaspera and sadden Stones here because right after the church ages the Redemption of the Jews comes so he that identify himself to us in the church ages as the Alpha and Omega he's identifying himself to the Jews as the alpha and Omega but for them to be able to receive it he got to identify himself in their Stone the jaspa is the first stone the siden is the last Stone so it's going to be the revelation of Jesus Christ that is going to redeem the Jews praise the Lord and with one on the throne it bring both Jews and Gentile together because the Jews are not going to take our Trinity amen they are not going to take three on the throne no they're going to take one yeah Israel the Lord our God is one and all through the church ages he's keep revealing himself to the church that he's only one are we together amen so you see it's it's it's not it's not just information the the the the greatest desire of the father amen is for him to be one with you amen praise the Lord he has given us an Open Door every one of us have an open door and an opportunity has been open to us to see the revelation of Jesus to hear the voice that say come up higher you can come up there's a better life to live amen you can make a step and get closer to the one that want to be made one with you there is one throne what's that Throne your heart and he want to be the only one sitting on that Throne he don't want to share that throne with no fleshly desire he don't want to share that trone with no W desire you love the Lord tonight amen praise the Lord musicians you can come let's sing the chorus tonight Lord My Heart is Open Lord please come inside amen let's sing the
