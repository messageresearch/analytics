[34:51] and his mercies Upon Us praise be to God
[34:57] yes
[34:58] before we open the scriptures
[35:02] early this morning
[35:05] I I I was just thinking
[35:08] because I had a rough night
[35:11] then I said if I come behind the pocket
[35:14] I need I need a handkerchief
[35:18] so if I have to use it
[35:21] but I don't have one
[35:23] then I remembered we have paper towels
[35:25] here I said the paper towel would do
[35:28] but I don't want to blow my nose
[35:31] and put it anywhere around here I even
[35:34] forgot I could put it in my pocket
[35:36] praise the Lord
[35:38] then I said no it's a huggage if I need
[35:41] but I don't have one
[35:43] and then I got up
[35:45] got ready went into my closet
[35:49] just picks what I'm wearing right now
[35:53] and I went to I to iron the the parents
[35:55] normally I wouldn't even put my hands in
[35:57] the pocket
[35:58] lo and behold I put the prince on the
[36:01] ironing board and here was the
[36:03] handkerchief inside halfway out
[36:06] and I said praise God
[36:09] you know the very little things the very
[36:12] minute things
[36:15] means a lot to the God we are serving
[36:18] it may not mean anything to you but it
[36:20] meant a lot to me praise be to God
[36:23] so whatever you are going to
[36:26] no matter how small it is
[36:30] just know that it means a lot to God
[36:33] he is in the minute details
[36:36] of every aspect of our life
[36:39] praise be to God
[36:41] if we can reach out for our Bibles
[36:43] before we get seated
[36:54] tell with me to
[37:01] Hebrews
[37:06] foreign
[37:24] I mean let's just start from verse one
[37:35] Hebrews 12 1.
[37:38] wherefore seeing we also are
[37:41] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[37:45] witnesses
[37:46] let us lay aside every weight
[37:49] and the sin which do have so easily
[37:52] beset us
[37:53] and let us run with patience
[37:56] the race that is set before us
[38:00] looking unto Jesus
[38:02] the author and finisher of our faith
[38:06] who for the joy that was set before him
[38:09] endeared the cross
[38:11] despising the shame and he sat down at
[38:15] the right hand
[38:16] of the Throne of god let's take verse 3
[38:20] also
[38:21] for consider him that endured second
[38:24] tradition of Sinners against himself
[38:27] lest ye be worried and faint in your
[38:30] minds
[38:32] shall we pray
[38:36] our Lord
[38:39] and our savior Jesus
[38:42] we thank this so much for having made it
[38:45] possible again for us to be here this
[38:47] morning
[38:49] we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace
[38:51] that has been Upon Our Lives
[38:54] we thank you for your tender hand Lord
[38:57] Of Love
[38:58] that has taken a hold of Our Lives
[39:01] and we are so grateful father
[39:04] that before there was a world you knew
[39:06] us
[39:07] and praise be to thee all God for
[39:10] undertaking for us in every aspect of
[39:12] Our Lives
[39:14] for we have come this far purely by the
[39:17] grace of God
[39:18] we are so grateful Lord that we are
[39:21] serving a living God
[39:24] last night through the early hours of
[39:26] this morning
[39:28] we had a heavy downpour I don't know
[39:30] about this area but around Saint Michael
[39:34] the rainfall that we saw
[39:36] was probably the heaviest since coming
[39:39] to the U.S
[39:41] and I got up this morning looked through
[39:43] the window
[39:45] and I said
[39:46] when rain comes down during spring
[39:51] it's just to give life
[39:53] to the trees
[39:55] to the shrubs to the grasses and they
[39:58] are happy they're blossom
[40:00] and they prosper
[40:02] and the same rain comes in four
[40:06] and the trees and the shrubs and the
[40:09] grass they die
[40:11] and my mind kept going around
[40:15] this is not the first time this thought
[40:17] has come to me
[40:18] but father to know
[40:21] that we are living in the springtime
[40:24] of Our Lives even though it is late
[40:27] spring
[40:28] that the word of God comes
[40:31] to help us identify Who We Are
[40:35] to to to make our lives bloom it is
[40:39] pertaining to your kingdom to prosper Us
[40:41] in the things of God
[40:43] and that if we do not heed to the word
[40:46] now there is coming a day when the
[40:49] seasons change and this word goes back
[40:53] goes back to the children of Israel
[40:56] at that time the Bible makes us to
[40:58] understand he that is filthy will be
[41:00] filthy still he that is clean will be
[41:02] clean still it doesn't matter how much
[41:04] of this word we hear then that wouldn't
[41:06] make any difference Lord
[41:08] now that the doors are open
[41:11] father we pray the O God In The Name of
[41:15] Jesus and let us heat to your word
[41:18] let your word be deeply rooted in our
[41:21] hearts we pray and we besieged in the
[41:24] name of Jesus and let the light of the
[41:27] word father so shine in our lives Lord
[41:29] that we will give God a glory Lord
[41:32] everywhere we find ourselves we're just
[41:35] thank him we bless you and we glorify
[41:37] the father for all that they have done
[41:39] for us we want to take opportunity
[41:42] opportunity giving us one we don't want
[41:44] to look down upon it we don't want to
[41:46] ever get to a place in our lives and
[41:49] then turn back and see all the
[41:51] opportunities we have blown away
[41:53] to think that oh we had that opportunity
[41:56] to make a change and yet we made it to
[42:00] sleep by
[42:02] we don't want that to be our profession
[42:03] Lord we pray that you help us oh god
[42:06] father we have gathered with many needs
[42:09] on our hearts this morning and we pray
[42:11] father oh God come and take control
[42:15] over over the prophet Lord father I
[42:19] yield myself into your hands this
[42:20] morning and I pray Use Me Lord to
[42:24] minister unto every single need there is
[42:26] in the house this morning
[42:28] that as many of us that have gathered
[42:30] and as many as are following the service
[42:32] online Our Lives will never be the same
[42:34] again granted unto us father we pray and
[42:37] will be switched in Jesus name our Lord
[42:39] and savior
[42:41] we want to remember brother John Bibi
[42:43] before thee my Mary our Henry Jordan
[42:46] praying for since Jemima and father we
[42:49] lift all this needs into your hands and
[42:51] there are the various needs that are in
[42:53] the house this morning we pray father oh
[42:55] God may you remember your children
[42:57] according to their needs Lord and
[43:00] attempt to them Father
[43:01] repeatedly we pray in Jesus name
[43:07] shall we be seated
[43:11] praise the Lord
[43:15] are you happy to be in the house of God
[43:17] this morning
[43:19] praise the Lord
[43:21] where else would we rather be
[43:24] than be in the house of God
[43:27] praise God
[43:29] that is
[43:30] there is no place that compares
[43:34] to being in the house of God
[43:37] David said I was glad
[43:39] when they said unto me let us go into
[43:41] the house of God
[43:44] you may have dragged yourself here this
[43:46] morning
[43:47] I know there are a lot of us not working
[43:50] the night
[43:51] and it's not easy coming back
[43:54] from work in the morning and getting
[43:56] ready and coming to church
[43:58] but there is a reward for it
[44:01] if God has to pay you for it
[44:05] how much is he going to pay you for an
[44:07] hour
[44:09] but there is a reward for you
[44:13] it is not an easy task
[44:15] is difficult we are not going to
[44:18] undermine that
[44:21] it is a difficult thing
[44:26] and you may have dragged your feet
[44:29] you may have come
[44:31] maybe against your will
[44:35] but there is a part of you
[44:37] that is glad you are here
[44:41] praise be to God
[44:43] I was glad
[44:45] when they said unto me let us go into
[44:48] the house of God
[44:50] it's just an amazing thing
[44:52] to see the spirit of God moving
[44:57] in every single service
[44:59] if you come to see God you will see God
[45:07] I remember last
[45:10] last two weeks
[45:12] one brother
[45:15] one brother was preaching
[45:18] I was seated in the foyer
[45:21] and
[45:23] something I had talked about I don't
[45:26] know how many weeks ago he picks it up
[45:29] praise be to God and I remember
[45:33] I think it was a Wednesday service that
[45:35] night
[45:36] and I was talking about whatever it is
[45:40] that is going on in your life never
[45:42] forsake the Gathering of the Saints
[45:44] make sure that when the doors are open
[45:47] you are here
[45:50] do not let the devil ever give you a
[45:52] cause to stay away from church service
[45:55] and I said that so long as you are in
[45:58] service so long as you are in church the
[46:01] devil can never have this way
[46:06] and I remember giving an example
[46:10] of how let's say an animal is just
[46:14] trying to pray
[46:15] take his prey normally it doesn't go in
[46:19] the front
[46:20] or right in the midst of the animals no
[46:23] it just hides
[46:26] and then it just looks at the animals as
[46:29] they pass
[46:31] it's just waiting for the one that has
[46:34] has isolated itself
[46:37] the Wonder has decided oh that brother
[46:40] there has offended me I don't want to be
[46:42] in that group I'm just going to be by
[46:44] myself oh the minister offended me you
[46:46] know what I want to be by myself and
[46:49] then he takes a stand behind he isolates
[46:52] himself
[46:54] and then the animal just goes in
[46:59] and then picks takes it down
[47:02] best so long as it is in the midst of
[47:05] the rest
[47:06] is very very difficult
[47:11] for the lion or any other animal to just
[47:13] go in and catch his prey
[47:16] and I said just come anyhow
[47:20] and then the brother comes
[47:22] and then he picks it up trying to
[47:25] encourage us never forsake the garden of
[47:28] the Saints make sure you are in church
[47:31] anytime the doors are open be here to
[47:34] serve God and then he goes right and
[47:36] then he takes a different example that
[47:38] when you set fire
[47:40] and you look in the cold I mean you look
[47:43] in the fire every call has fire but when
[47:46] you reach out and you pick one out
[47:49] and you put it on the side it will just
[47:52] sit there before you realize it dies out
[48:00] it's a good thing
[48:03] to be in the house of God
[48:06] for every single service but when I was
[48:10] preaching last week and he read a
[48:12] scripture he took it from Psalm 27 4. if
[48:16] we can just read that Psalm 27 4. praise
[48:20] be to God
[48:27] Psalm 27
[48:29] 4. one thing have I desired of the Lord
[48:34] that that will I seek after
[48:39] that I may dwell in the house of the
[48:41] Lord all the days of my life
[48:43] to behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[48:47] inquire in his Temple praise be to God
[48:52] one thing have I decided of the Lord
[48:55] be it in the house of God is such a
[48:57] precious thing
[48:59] then when all of life is over
[49:03] I want to be in the house of God
[49:05] and to be at the feet of the Lord
[49:08] that when life comes to a standstill
[49:11] and the doors are open I want to be in
[49:14] the house of God and be at his feet
[49:17] that when I get to a place and I don't
[49:20] understand what is going on I still want
[49:23] to be in church
[49:26] that when all the Miracles the signs and
[49:29] the Wonders when they all cease and
[49:32] there are no more tongues I still want
[49:34] to be in the house of God when the doors
[49:37] are opened
[49:38] and to be at his feet
[49:40] to seek the face of God
[49:43] and to acquire in his presence
[49:45] praise be to God
[49:48] it doesn't matter what happens
[49:51] being in the house of God
[49:54] can never be treated with any other
[49:57] thing
[49:59] we come
[50:01] we don't have the eyes to see but there
[50:03] are a lot of things that go on
[50:05] that when you sit down under the
[50:08] anointing of the word that is being
[50:09] preached that chains are being broken
[50:12] their course attacked asunder
[50:15] habits just leave
[50:17] sicknesses are healed it's not only when
[50:20] you come in the prayer line
[50:21] but as you sit down and you are feeling
[50:24] on the word things are happening
[50:27] praise be to God your life would never
[50:29] remain the same
[50:36] one thing is sure that the devil
[50:39] would never
[50:41] sit down and just let you go on and
[50:45] enjoy the way the way you want to
[50:48] order he's going to come your way
[50:54] invite him
[50:56] he doesn't need any invitation he will
[50:59] come anyhow
[51:03] brother running
[51:06] when he was preaching before then
[51:08] brother femi
[51:09] he gave us a story
[51:12] about his dad giving them telling us has
[51:15] given us a story his dad told them
[51:18] in Africa you know the hunters
[51:22] just picking up from what he told us
[51:24] they have a hunter's back
[51:26] and I know what he was talking about
[51:29] there are bugs they never wash
[51:31] that bar can be very very Dairy and when
[51:34] you see it you know that is a real
[51:36] Hunter
[51:37] every kill they get they put it in that
[51:39] bag
[51:40] and he said he does he says told them
[51:43] that every every animal the hunter kills
[51:47] he puts it in that bag
[51:49] and he said his dad told them that the
[51:52] hunter does not go after what it has
[51:56] already killed
[51:57] because he has it in his back
[52:01] right why does he have to run after it
[52:03] anymore
[52:04] it rather goes after the animal it does
[52:08] not have
[52:09] so when the devil is pursuing you it's
[52:13] because he doesn't have you
[52:16] when the devil is on your Trail it's an
[52:19] indication that the devil hasn't gotten
[52:22] you
[52:25] Emperor only said
[52:27] when he cited examples of uh I mean are
[52:30] most of transportation starting from the
[52:33] oldest Mass man using their legs and
[52:36] then he came I think he came to houses
[52:38] or donkeys cats I'm not very sure talks
[52:41] about cars talked about uh the place and
[52:44] he talked about what
[52:45] the the space rocket
[52:48] and he said he just takes a flight and
[52:52] just gets into space
[52:54] and he was trying to encourage us that
[52:57] you can take a walk with God
[53:00] and then you can get to a place where
[53:02] the devil can never follow you
[53:06] you can take a flight with God and the
[53:10] devil can never follow you
[53:12] now you can get into the presence of God
[53:16] and the devil cannot get there right
[53:19] praise be to God
[53:22] and last week brother what brother one
[53:24] was preaching
[53:25] and then he talks about the Tabernacle
[53:28] of Moses and talked about the Temple of
[53:30] the Temple of um
[53:35] Solomon
[53:36] and then the layout
[53:39] the inner Court the the other call the
[53:42] inner court and the innermost Court
[53:43] which is the holist of holies
[53:47] and you realize
[53:50] that you can get into the holies of
[53:54] holies
[53:55] into this Shekinah Glory into the
[53:59] presence of the almighty God
[54:02] a place where the devil can never
[54:04] venture
[54:06] none in the Old Testament days
[54:10] it was just a high priest who would go
[54:13] in there
[54:14] once in a year to I thought for the sins
[54:16] of the people
[54:19] but after Calvary
[54:21] the veil to the temple was right in
[54:24] Twain
[54:25] that every one of us not only the high
[54:28] priest but every one of us can walk into
[54:30] that presence of God not once in a year
[54:34] you can do that thousand times in a year
[54:37] and it is still all right
[54:40] praise God
[54:43] you can get there the devil cannot
[54:46] follow you
[54:48] but what happens a lot of the times
[54:51] a lot of the times we live below our God
[54:55] give giving privileges
[55:00] a lot of the times
[55:04] a lot of the times we really forget Who
[55:07] We Are
[55:11] by the way
[55:13] the theme
[55:15] of my sermon this morning
[55:18] is looking at the bigger picture
[55:23] praise be to God
[55:25] looking at the bigger picture
[55:31] we should change ourselves
[55:34] and we live below our god-giving
[55:36] privileges
[55:39] because we are not looking at the bigger
[55:42] picture yeah
[55:44] praise be to God now when we go back to
[55:48] the scripture we read
[55:50] Hebrews 2
[55:52] verse one to three
[55:55] I am actually basing this on verse 2
[55:59] the Bible says
[56:06] okay
[56:16] looking up unto Jesus the order and the
[56:20] finisher of our faith
[56:22] who for the joy that was set before him
[56:26] endured the cross
[56:29] for the joy that was set before him
[56:33] he endured the cross
[56:37] brother Branham told us
[56:40] that Jesus could have married
[56:44] now think about it if he had decided to
[56:47] marry and then he married and had an
[56:49] Earthly family and just stayed here what
[56:52] was going to become of you and me
[56:58] hey Gabriel brother told us being a
[57:01] private
[57:04] said he was tempted in everything
[57:06] possible
[57:10] in everything possible in everything
[57:13] that can ever cross your mind he was
[57:15] tempted in it and yet without sin
[57:18] and the prophet of God told us to be
[57:21] tempted is no sin
[57:24] is when you yield to it
[57:27] then you have given birth to sin
[57:30] and he did not sing
[57:33] praise be to God now think about it when
[57:36] the devil took him to the top of the
[57:37] mountain and he said just look at the
[57:40] the world just look at it and he showed
[57:43] him the world
[57:44] and there is Glory thereof and he said
[57:47] if you worship me I will give everything
[57:49] to you
[57:51] think about it if he had fallen for it
[57:55] where would you and I be
[58:00] why would you and I be if he had fallen
[58:03] for it
[58:04] sure
[58:06] but for the joy
[58:10] that was given him
[58:12] for the joy that was before him
[58:18] he did not yield
[58:21] to these Temptations
[58:23] right there was a joy that was set
[58:26] before him he was looking at the bigger
[58:29] picture
[58:31] he was looking at the bigger picture
[58:37] just think about it
[58:42] when he came to the end of his Road
[58:44] on this Earth
[58:47] he foresaw what he was going to go
[58:49] through
[58:50] it's one thing
[58:52] staking a man
[58:53] to the tree and just put in a bullet
[58:57] in their head or in their heart it
[59:00] doesn't take long they are gone
[59:03] and I have said before that I have seen
[59:06] a situation where somebody that was
[59:09] committed to death
[59:10] and also what is that what is death is
[59:13] one day born when they die wait till
[59:16] that day comes
[59:18] it's not an easy thing death of any kind
[59:23] it's not an easy thing to go through
[59:25] and that day comes and normally what
[59:28] they do to them they will come and tell
[59:30] them you know what ah yes your day has
[59:33] come your cup is full so uh get ready
[59:35] tomorrow
[59:37] we are going to kill you
[59:40] it's a good thing God has made death a
[59:43] secret
[59:45] can you imagine the chaos
[59:48] that was going to be on this Earth
[59:50] and I tell you
[59:52] they will tell you that anything you
[59:54] want ask for it will give it to you
[59:58] some will say oh I want this uh they
[1:00:01] will give them a package
[1:00:03] throw it down light another one
[1:00:06] it's not an easy thing
[1:00:08] and we are talking about the Lord Jesus
[1:00:11] Christ
[1:00:12] who could
[1:00:15] what he was going to go through
[1:00:17] not a death by the bullet
[1:00:21] I mean all the the torture the torture
[1:00:27] that that that that the punishment I
[1:00:31] mean the the cruel death
[1:00:33] that has not been any death more cruel
[1:00:36] than that
[1:00:39] and then he prayed
[1:00:42] prayed
[1:00:43] now when you read the scriptures
[1:00:46] he said father all things are possible
[1:00:51] take this cup away from me
[1:00:55] and then right
[1:00:57] the next sentence he said nevertheless
[1:01:00] not my will let
[1:01:03] your will be done
[1:01:06] just this morning it never hit me like
[1:01:08] that before but just this morning
[1:01:11] he just came to me
[1:01:13] that between him saying the father take
[1:01:17] away this cup
[1:01:18] take it away from me
[1:01:20] and then the next verse say nevertheless
[1:01:24] let your will be done
[1:01:26] how many minutes was it
[1:01:28] how many seconds elapsed how many hours
[1:01:32] went by
[1:01:35] I don't know but I don't believe maybe
[1:01:37] he just said
[1:01:39] take this cup away from me nevertheless
[1:01:41] that always be that I believe there was
[1:01:43] a lot of consideration that went on
[1:01:46] yes I believe
[1:01:48] that he began he began to
[1:01:56] began to and then he started thinking of
[1:01:58] the bigger picture
[1:02:00] I came here for a purpose
[1:02:03] thinking about it
[1:02:05] I came here
[1:02:08] here to die for the sin of this for this
[1:02:10] for the sin of the world
[1:02:12] I came here
[1:02:14] then I may destroy the west of the flesh
[1:02:20] I came here to to set the bondage he
[1:02:23] that is in bondage free he started
[1:02:25] thinking of the bigger picture
[1:02:28] and then he got to that person said
[1:02:30] father nevertheless
[1:02:32] not my will but your will be done
[1:02:36] looking at a bigger picture
[1:02:39] what if he had refused to die
[1:02:43] I'm all right what if he had refused to
[1:02:45] die why would we stand
[1:02:49] but he was looking at a bigger picture
[1:02:52] praise be to God
[1:02:54] now brother said in one of the messages
[1:02:58] he preached a lot on this as title but
[1:03:01] in one of them uh
[1:03:15] hearing him
[1:03:18] in one of those messages in 1956 I think
[1:03:21] two of them in that year and a couple uh
[1:03:23] in the other years
[1:03:25] right
[1:03:26] and I read
[1:03:29] I may never he was actually pray
[1:03:32] they never get able to shake their hands
[1:03:35] in this life
[1:03:37] but someday standing Yonder in the near
[1:03:40] future when life is all over and the
[1:03:44] great table is set and thousands of
[1:03:46] miles across the sky and we we look
[1:03:50] across the table to each other
[1:03:52] and the tears running down our cheeks
[1:03:56] love to hear them say yes brother
[1:03:59] Branham
[1:04:00] that night I cuddle Tabernacle it
[1:04:03] changed my life
[1:04:04] praise be to God
[1:04:06] while we are holding each other's hands
[1:04:09] and the tears of joy running down our
[1:04:12] cheeks the king will come out and wipe
[1:04:15] all our tears
[1:04:17] oh tears from our eyes and say don't cry
[1:04:21] children
[1:04:22] is all over now
[1:04:24] enter into the joys of the Lord that's
[1:04:27] been prepared for you since the
[1:04:30] foundation of the world
[1:04:31] praise be to God keep them sweet humble
[1:04:35] full of Mercy being the salt of the
[1:04:38] earth until the hour that you come for
[1:04:41] us
[1:04:41] I present them to thee thou has said
[1:04:46] in thy word no man can come to me except
[1:04:49] my father draws him first
[1:04:52] and all that comes to me I will give
[1:04:55] them eternal life and will raise them
[1:04:57] and will raise him up at the last days
[1:05:00] we know
[1:05:03] that that's the truth
[1:05:08] the person that I was looking for
[1:05:10] enter into the joys of the Lord
[1:05:14] that's been prepared for you
[1:05:17] since the foundation of the world
[1:05:21] the Lord Jesus
[1:05:24] for the joy that was set before him
[1:05:30] the Bible says he endured
[1:05:33] the cross
[1:05:34] the shame
[1:05:40] because there was a joy that was set
[1:05:42] before him
[1:05:45] is saying
[1:05:48] that says from the foundation of the
[1:05:50] world there is a joy that has been set
[1:05:52] before you and me
[1:05:54] so it was not only the Lord Jesus
[1:05:58] but there is a joy
[1:06:00] that has been said before you and me are
[1:06:03] we going to endure our cross
[1:06:08] he endured looking at the bigger picture
[1:06:11] are we going to endure our cross
[1:06:14] you said do we have a cross yes we have
[1:06:17] a cross
[1:06:18] because the Lord Jesus told his
[1:06:19] disciples If any man comes after me let
[1:06:23] him deny himself take out his cross and
[1:06:25] follow me
[1:06:26] so you have a cross I have a cross
[1:06:32] are we going to endure our cross
[1:06:36] are we going to deny ourselves he denied
[1:06:39] himself
[1:06:41] are you going to deny yourself
[1:06:44] and to follow him to take up your cross
[1:06:46] and to endure the cross for that matter
[1:06:49] are you going to do that
[1:06:53] and there is absolutely no way
[1:06:56] you can do it without looking up unto
[1:06:59] him
[1:07:00] as the scripture says looking up unto
[1:07:04] Jesus The Altar and the finisher of our
[1:07:06] faith the only way you can and endure
[1:07:09] the cross is by looking up to him
[1:07:16] praise the Lord
[1:07:19] looking at the bigger picture
[1:07:26] when you are looking at the bigger
[1:07:28] picture you don't see yourself
[1:07:32] you don't come in the picture
[1:07:34] when you begin to see yourself in the
[1:07:37] picture something is wrong
[1:07:44] when you begin to see yourself in the
[1:07:47] picture
[1:07:48] something is wrong
[1:07:52] and why looking at the bigger picture
[1:07:54] you don't even see the devil
[1:07:57] our anniversary you don't see him
[1:08:01] says somewhere that the devil is not
[1:08:04] even in the picture
[1:08:06] it's weird that put him in the picture
[1:08:09] he is not in the picture
[1:08:11] and why looking at the bigger picture
[1:08:13] the only person you see is Christ
[1:08:20] he is our mediator
[1:08:22] the mediator between God and man
[1:08:26] there is no way to look at a bigger
[1:08:29] picture without looking up onto him who
[1:08:31] is the author and the finisher of our
[1:08:33] faith
[1:08:35] that he alone
[1:08:37] bore our sins
[1:08:40] he alone took our judgment
[1:08:44] he was condemned to death
[1:08:48] just for love
[1:08:51] not because he did anything wrong
[1:08:54] but he was condemned in our place
[1:08:58] he became sin
[1:09:02] who never committed anything
[1:09:04] that we should become the very
[1:09:06] righteousness of God
[1:09:07] he gave his all
[1:09:10] for us
[1:09:13] he alone
[1:09:15] died in our place
[1:09:19] and while looking at a bigger picture
[1:09:21] there is none else you see
[1:09:24] but Christ
[1:09:26] if you are seeing someone else
[1:09:28] or seeing yourself
[1:09:30] then there is a problem somewhere
[1:09:33] praise be to God
[1:09:36] Christ is the bigger picture
[1:09:58] there are a lot of examples I can draw
[1:09:59] from but I just chose to here
[1:10:06] I think we are very good on time
[1:10:09] yes praise be to God
[1:10:13] that when when when when when Moses
[1:10:16] mother gave birth to him
[1:10:19] the king had issued a decree
[1:10:22] that any male child that is born should
[1:10:25] be cast in the Nile
[1:10:31] but the Bible says
[1:10:34] that Moses mother
[1:10:36] looked at him
[1:10:38] and he said he's a proper child
[1:10:41] he knew he was a proper child
[1:10:44] and he did not fear the king's
[1:10:46] commandment
[1:10:49] they did not fear the king's commandment
[1:10:51] they kept him
[1:10:54] because they knew
[1:10:57] that there was a purpose for his life
[1:11:01] they were looking at the bigger picture
[1:11:03] they didn't care what the king had said
[1:11:06] but they knew that God was going to keep
[1:11:09] him
[1:11:10] and when they kept him they couldn't
[1:11:12] keep him anymore
[1:11:14] we know the story how his mother made a
[1:11:17] basket pitched it and then went to put
[1:11:19] him on the Nile river that was infested
[1:11:22] with crocodiles
[1:11:24] and you will think that why would any
[1:11:27] mother do that
[1:11:29] or why would any person in their right
[1:11:32] Minds do that
[1:11:37] faith
[1:11:39] does not count on what you think is
[1:11:41] right
[1:11:47] put him on the river
[1:11:50] so you are looking for him he is out
[1:11:52] there
[1:11:54] and I dare you to go for him
[1:11:57] why because
[1:12:01] God had promised
[1:12:03] to deliver the children of Israel out of
[1:12:05] bondage
[1:12:07] and they knew
[1:12:09] that Moses
[1:12:11] was a deliverer God was going to deliver
[1:12:13] the children of Israel through him
[1:12:16] and they knew that God was going to
[1:12:18] protect that gift
[1:12:22] they were not looking at what the king
[1:12:23] had said they were just looking
[1:12:26] at the hand of God upon his life they
[1:12:29] were looking at the bigger picture and
[1:12:31] they didn't care what the King has said
[1:12:34] and Moses himself
[1:12:36] when he came of age
[1:12:39] and looking at the bigger picture as a
[1:12:41] matter of fact there was nobody that was
[1:12:45] I mean
[1:12:46] looking at his background where he came
[1:12:49] from and then being the nest Pharaoh in
[1:12:52] the making
[1:12:55] and turned his back on it it takes it
[1:13:00] takes the grace of God
[1:13:03] a man that was groomed
[1:13:05] to be the next pharaoh
[1:13:09] with all that power and authority
[1:13:13] the Pharaoh had
[1:13:16] all the wealth and the pets
[1:13:20] but looking at the bigger picture
[1:13:24] he chose not to be called Pharaoh's
[1:13:27] daughter's son
[1:13:30] he would look through the window
[1:13:32] and then see the children of Israel in
[1:13:34] the markets
[1:13:36] and identify himself with them looking
[1:13:40] at a bigger picture
[1:13:43] he didn't want to enjoy the pleasures
[1:13:47] of Egypt for a while
[1:13:49] he was looking at a bigger picture
[1:13:58] it doesn't matter how they insulted them
[1:14:02] how they broke their backs
[1:14:05] from the whips
[1:14:08] looking at a bigger picture he
[1:14:10] identified himself
[1:14:12] with them
[1:14:15] we're gonna talk about Abraham
[1:14:19] now when God called him to separate
[1:14:21] himself
[1:14:22] from father mother from Kindred from his
[1:14:25] stripe just come out to a line he was
[1:14:27] going to show him he stepped out
[1:14:30] and the Bible says
[1:14:32] that all his life
[1:14:34] he was looking for that City
[1:14:37] with the foundation whose builder in
[1:14:40] Mecca was God himself
[1:14:43] looking at the bigger picture
[1:14:45] God prospered him so much
[1:14:49] so much
[1:14:51] that Abraham could have said you know
[1:14:54] what I have been following this God for
[1:14:56] True to too much
[1:14:58] you know I am blessed I am satisfied
[1:15:01] with what I have today
[1:15:03] and then just
[1:15:04] decide I'm not going on anymore
[1:15:09] but that was not Abraham's position
[1:15:12] in spite of the blessings God has
[1:15:14] bestowed upon him
[1:15:16] he was still looking forward to that
[1:15:18] City
[1:15:22] he was still looking forward
[1:15:24] to that City
[1:15:29] looking at the bigger picture
[1:15:33] praise be to God
[1:15:36] looking at a bigger picture
[1:15:39] now in in the year 1666
[1:15:45] September of 1666
[1:15:48] .
[1:15:50] there was there was um
[1:15:54] there was there was fire in um London
[1:16:00] and they call it the great fires of
[1:16:02] London
[1:16:08] the great fires of London
[1:16:11] that fire lasted for four days
[1:16:15] and in central London
[1:16:18] out of the 80 000 homes or houses they
[1:16:21] were
[1:16:22] 70 000 houses were gutted by fire
[1:16:30] 70 000 houses out of the eighty thousand
[1:16:33] houses in central London gutted by fire
[1:16:39] and over a hundred thousand
[1:16:41] people were declared homeless
[1:16:44] what amazing thing that happened though
[1:16:46] was that not modern I think probably
[1:16:50] four or five people died
[1:16:53] the people that died were not more than
[1:16:55] 10.
[1:16:58] now
[1:17:00] when Central lending got consumed by
[1:17:03] fire
[1:17:05] there was a renowned
[1:17:07] architecture architect
[1:17:10] by the name of Christopher Wren w-r-e-n
[1:17:14] who was tasked
[1:17:16] to rebuild
[1:17:20] the Cathedral Saint Paul's Cathedral an
[1:17:23] Anglican Church
[1:17:25] he was tasked to rebuild that Cathedral
[1:17:30] and then one day
[1:17:33] when he went out
[1:17:36] there were three people Masons
[1:17:40] that were laying breads
[1:17:42] he went to the first one and he asked
[1:17:45] him what are you doing
[1:17:48] he said I'm laying bricks
[1:17:53] then he went to the second one
[1:17:55] and he asked him what are you doing
[1:17:58] he said I'm building a wall
[1:18:02] then he went to the third one and asked
[1:18:05] him what are you doing he said I'm
[1:18:07] building a cathedral
[1:18:12] praise be to God
[1:18:16] to every passerby
[1:18:20] all these three people
[1:18:23] were doing the same thing right
[1:18:27] but as a matter of fact they were not
[1:18:30] doing the same thing
[1:18:35] they were not doing the same thing
[1:18:36] mm-hmm
[1:18:38] we can come to church every day of the
[1:18:42] week
[1:18:43] or as the case is every Wednesday and
[1:18:46] every Sunday we can come to church
[1:18:50] and to everybody around here that sees
[1:18:53] us coming in and going out
[1:18:55] they will look at it and say oh they are
[1:18:58] all doing the same thing
[1:19:00] but what is the true picture before God
[1:19:06] what is the true picture before God
[1:19:16] now
[1:19:17] the first person when he said I am
[1:19:20] laying bricks he said I am laying breaks
[1:19:22] so I can get some money to take care of
[1:19:25] my family
[1:19:28] so all he was thinking of was just that
[1:19:32] present time
[1:19:34] was just that moment
[1:19:38] he was not thinking of anything further
[1:19:41] just that moment what he was going to
[1:19:44] get laying bricks
[1:19:48] the second person that said I am
[1:19:50] building a wall his story was not very
[1:19:53] different
[1:19:55] I am laying building a wall so I will
[1:19:59] get some money and take care of my
[1:20:01] family
[1:20:02] he was just
[1:20:06] thinking of
[1:20:08] the present moment
[1:20:11] but there was a third person
[1:20:15] who said I am building a cathedral
[1:20:19] he was not looking at the wages
[1:20:21] that was not
[1:20:25] how do I say that his point of Interest
[1:20:29] he was paid all right maybe he was even
[1:20:32] paid more
[1:20:33] than the first two people
[1:20:35] that
[1:20:37] that was not his satisfaction
[1:20:41] he was looking forward to a cathedral
[1:20:44] and when he said I am building a
[1:20:48] cathedral he said I am building a
[1:20:50] criteria for the Almighty
[1:20:53] praise be to God
[1:20:55] building a cathedral for the Almighty
[1:21:00] and then you look at a person like that
[1:21:04] when that person that place was in Ruins
[1:21:07] when he stood and looked at the ground
[1:21:11] he saw a cathedral
[1:21:15] that when the people were asked
[1:21:19] and he looked at them Excavating the
[1:21:22] ground
[1:21:22] he saw nothing but a cathedral
[1:21:26] that before the first block was ever
[1:21:31] he was looking at it
[1:21:33] and he was seeing a cathedral right now
[1:21:36] when they were laying blocks and raising
[1:21:38] walls
[1:21:41] that was not what he was seeing he was
[1:21:43] seen a cathedral
[1:21:45] he was always looking at a bigger
[1:21:47] picture and that was what was driving
[1:21:50] him
[1:21:54] so beyond the payment and Beyond the
[1:21:57] money and Beyond the past and Beyond the
[1:22:00] promotion he was looking forward
[1:22:03] to a cathedral for the Almighty
[1:22:06] and what he was seeing
[1:22:08] the rest were not seeing it
[1:22:13] the people that were passing by were not
[1:22:15] seeing it
[1:22:17] but he was in something Beyond
[1:22:20] it is possible
[1:22:23] it is possible
[1:22:25] to be in the house of God and yet be
[1:22:28] short-sighted
[1:22:30] sure
[1:22:32] you can be in the hands of God and all
[1:22:35] you are interested in is just coming and
[1:22:37] going out because it's Sunday because
[1:22:40] it's Wednesday
[1:22:43] but there is something Beyond coming and
[1:22:45] going
[1:22:47] there is something Beyond coming to
[1:22:50] church and sitting down and hearing the
[1:22:52] word of God and going there is something
[1:22:54] beyond that and are you seeing the
[1:22:56] bigger picture
[1:23:00] are you seeing the bigger picture
[1:23:05] or is just for the foreign
[1:23:08] just for the moment or what you get for
[1:23:11] the moment
[1:23:14] maybe here in the U.S we don't see it
[1:23:16] much
[1:23:17] but elsewhere you enter a bus
[1:23:20] before you avoid as a preacher on the
[1:23:22] bus
[1:23:24] and then you start preaching
[1:23:26] I remember having one Muslim friend who
[1:23:28] were in Ghana together with roommates
[1:23:30] um and then he's he's in uh somewhere in
[1:23:33] North Carolina now
[1:23:35] he's a Muslim
[1:23:37] he was and he still is
[1:23:39] and then he was going from kasoa to
[1:23:41] Accra
[1:23:42] and I he has so much respect
[1:23:45] for Christianity he has so much respect
[1:23:48] one time he told me that
[1:23:51] um if not
[1:23:52] of his background that he was going to
[1:23:55] be a Christian
[1:23:56] he told me that
[1:24:02] so he entered a car was going to Accra
[1:24:05] and then
[1:24:08] um
[1:24:09] the driver was playing a reggae song and
[1:24:12] then he turned it off
[1:24:14] and then a man stood and started
[1:24:16] preaching
[1:24:18] and then he listened
[1:24:20] and when the man was done he was asking
[1:24:22] for
[1:24:23] um offering
[1:24:24] and then he offered he gave money
[1:24:28] but he got so disappointed
[1:24:30] when after everything was said
[1:24:34] and then the car was quiet
[1:24:38] and the driver was so touched that he
[1:24:41] put on the gospel
[1:24:43] this very man that was preaching
[1:24:45] probably the driver oh put back the
[1:24:47] reggae song on
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:51] my goodness Lord have mercy
[1:24:55] the money
[1:24:57] the man told him oh put back the reggae
[1:24:59] song on
[1:25:00] what a shame
[1:25:02] so there are people
[1:25:04] just for what they are going to get
[1:25:07] just for your belly for your stomachs
[1:25:09] and the Bible talks about them
[1:25:16] so
[1:25:17] but you may say oh no that is not my
[1:25:20] case
[1:25:22] but it is equally a very pitiful sight
[1:25:25] right
[1:25:26] that you can come to the house of God
[1:25:29] sit down hear the word get up go and
[1:25:33] come in and you don't see any effect of
[1:25:36] the word in your life
[1:25:42] you don't see any effect in your life
[1:25:48] the bigger picture is not you
[1:25:53] the bigger picture is not you
[1:25:57] remember
[1:25:59] that someone died in your place
[1:26:04] for God so loved the word that he gave
[1:26:06] us only begotten son
[1:26:07] whosoever believeth he should not perish
[1:26:10] but have everlasting life that somebody
[1:26:12] died in your place somebody took upon
[1:26:14] himself your sins and he nadered to the
[1:26:17] cross
[1:26:18] and that there is no sin that can be
[1:26:20] imputed unto you under the blood
[1:26:23] [Music]
[1:26:24] that you are free to save your God
[1:26:27] that you are no longer in bondage that
[1:26:30] you are a child of God
[1:26:31] praise be to God
[1:26:34] don't look at you
[1:26:36] what you did yesterday
[1:26:38] if you fall it's a child of God that has
[1:26:41] fallen that doesn't make you a demon
[1:26:45] get up and put your life together
[1:26:49] praise the Lord
[1:26:51] don't settle for anything less
[1:26:56] you can kill a sheep
[1:26:58] and then I don't care whether you boil
[1:27:00] it or you roast it or you fry it it will
[1:27:04] never change it into a goat right
[1:27:06] a selection
[1:27:07] sir the Bible says they just shall fall
[1:27:11] seven times and shall rise again
[1:27:15] don't let the devil pin you down
[1:27:18] because he did something wrong yesterday
[1:27:20] that is the blood of The Mercy Seat
[1:27:24] praise be to God
[1:27:29] we have a place to run for shelter
[1:27:32] and that is how we are still coming to
[1:27:34] church
[1:27:40] praise the Lord
[1:27:45] he was looking
[1:27:47] every time he looked he saw a cathedral
[1:27:53] the others were not seeing it
[1:27:58] and Beyond
[1:28:00] coming to church
[1:28:02] and going every day
[1:28:04] when we come
[1:28:06] we ought to see
[1:28:09] the hand of God
[1:28:12] we ought to be seeing what God has done
[1:28:18] not what we have done or what we can do
[1:28:24] we've been called to a finished work
[1:28:31] that's what we should be looking at
[1:28:35] that is why the reward is
[1:28:40] in this life we get some wedges
[1:28:44] and I'm not talking about going to work
[1:28:46] and making some money no yes we do that
[1:28:49] but we get some little blessings here
[1:28:51] and there
[1:28:53] by beyond that there is a reward
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:28:56] don't settle for the blessings and then
[1:29:00] forget of the greater picture right
[1:29:03] because the reward far outweighs
[1:29:08] the blessings of this present time
[1:29:14] looking at a bigger picture
[1:29:21] and what he saw
[1:29:26] that there was a cathedral standing at
[1:29:28] long last
[1:29:32] what Joy
[1:29:34] that brings right it gives you a sense
[1:29:38] of accomplishment
[1:29:39] it gives you a sense of purpose
[1:29:44] it gives yourself Pride
[1:29:50] that you forget of all the payments you
[1:29:52] you ever given
[1:29:54] and then your joy
[1:29:56] is in this Cathedral that is standing
[1:29:58] that you can knock on your chest and see
[1:30:01] I was part of this dream
[1:30:04] praise be to God I was part of this
[1:30:07] dream
[1:30:07] we can also talk about Michelangelo
[1:30:12] that when he brought that big rock
[1:30:14] and every day he will just sit down and
[1:30:17] be chipping it chipping it for years
[1:30:19] just tripping it here and there people
[1:30:22] may have passed and looked at it and
[1:30:24] maybe have passed some get real comment
[1:30:26] or maybe have you have laughed at him
[1:30:28] why would you go and get some job why
[1:30:31] are you wasting time every day sitting
[1:30:33] here oh if it wasn't for your wife maybe
[1:30:35] you would have died ah you need you need
[1:30:37] to be making some money but he will just
[1:30:39] sit down
[1:30:44] why there was a each other was locked in
[1:30:48] in his mind
[1:30:50] a picture nobody saw
[1:30:52] only he could see that picture
[1:30:56] and as he was chipping it here and there
[1:30:58] people looked at it it didn't make sense
[1:31:00] to them
[1:31:01] they didn't know what this man was up to
[1:31:04] but every single Chip he made
[1:31:07] brought him closer
[1:31:09] to the picture that was in his mind
[1:31:12] you're coming to church and going may
[1:31:15] not make sense to anybody
[1:31:18] but every single service
[1:31:21] every single service when you come and
[1:31:24] you hear the word of God and you're
[1:31:25] taking something is getting you a step
[1:31:28] closer
[1:31:30] when you take your Bible and you read
[1:31:32] people may sit down and look at you as
[1:31:35] if you are crazy
[1:31:36] but with every verse with every chapter
[1:31:39] you are getting closer
[1:31:43] every single prayer draws you closer
[1:31:47] praise be to God
[1:31:50] there is a reward and that is coming
[1:31:55] is coming and then one day
[1:31:59] he did the last shipping
[1:32:02] and then here stands the statute of
[1:32:05] Moses before him
[1:32:07] praise be to God
[1:32:10] and then he looks at it
[1:32:14] and then he screams
[1:32:16] it was so real
[1:32:19] and then he hit it with his hammer
[1:32:22] mother speak
[1:32:24] it
[1:32:26] and left a dent
[1:32:29] it was so real to him so real I believe
[1:32:35] if that rock if that statue has spoken
[1:32:38] he will not be surprised
[1:32:41] because it was so real to him
[1:32:45] can you imagine
[1:32:47] how much satisfaction
[1:32:50] can you imagine that reward
[1:32:52] there is no amount of money that can
[1:32:55] replace that
[1:32:57] no amount of money that can ever replace
[1:33:00] that praise be to God
[1:33:05] so every step we take
[1:33:08] we are to be seeing a bigger picture
[1:33:13] coming and going is not enough
[1:33:16] keep looking at the Unseen by eyes of
[1:33:19] faith
[1:33:21] set your eyes on the go
[1:33:25] keep your eyes on the bigger picture
[1:33:28] because
[1:33:30] you can be distracted
[1:33:33] you can be distracted
[1:33:35] you can take your eyes
[1:33:37] on the bigger picture and the next thing
[1:33:40] you will not believe what you do
[1:33:42] the next thing you don't believe where
[1:33:44] you find yourself right
[1:33:46] best so long as you keep your eyes
[1:33:52] on the bigger picture on Christ on his
[1:33:55] finished works
[1:33:56] on what he has already done you are
[1:33:59] keeping your eyes on the go you are
[1:34:02] keeping your eyes on him I Promise You
[1:34:04] by the grace of God you are going to get
[1:34:07] to the right destination
[1:34:11] praise the Lord
[1:34:13] looking at a bigger picture
[1:34:26] God is looking at us
[1:34:29] in the end
[1:34:33] the imperfections
[1:34:36] of the present time
[1:34:38] the ups and the downs
[1:34:40] the hairless and the heartaches
[1:34:43] the troubles
[1:34:47] The Temptations
[1:34:49] the trials
[1:34:52] and all those things
[1:34:56] God is not looking at that
[1:35:01] God has a perfect picture of you
[1:35:07] praise be to God
[1:35:09] he has it in his album
[1:35:13] that we are going through a lot at this
[1:35:16] time
[1:35:18] but God is looking at you in your
[1:35:21] perfect state
[1:35:23] and that is what matters to God
[1:35:31] he has the final picture
[1:35:34] he has a final picture of you that is
[1:35:36] what matters at most
[1:35:38] now if if
[1:35:40] if we must see the same picture he is
[1:35:44] seen if we can only see
[1:35:49] what the father is saying
[1:35:51] they ups and downs
[1:35:53] will not hinder our work with God
[1:35:58] there's only one that matters
[1:36:01] all the father sees is
[1:36:04] he is between God and man
[1:36:09] for God so loved the word that he gave
[1:36:10] us his only begotten son
[1:36:12] if our sacrifices should be accepted it
[1:36:17] has to be through the Sun
[1:36:18] whatever we do we have to do it in the
[1:36:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:26] whether we live whether we die whether
[1:36:29] we marry whether we giving to marriages
[1:36:31] whatever we do we have to do it in the
[1:36:35] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:38] there is no way our sacrifices can ever
[1:36:42] be received outside of him
[1:36:46] when God looks down
[1:36:49] all he sees
[1:36:54] is Christ the blood the blood that was
[1:36:57] shed for you and me
[1:37:00] and under that blood
[1:37:02] there is no sin there is no iniquity
[1:37:06] too big to be forgiven
[1:37:09] praise the Lord
[1:37:18] if God has to pay us for our Deeds
[1:37:22] how many do you think that would be
[1:37:26] if God has to pay you and me for our
[1:37:28] Deeds
[1:37:30] how much do you think that would be
[1:37:37] I don't think we would even like it
[1:37:40] because the Bible says the wages of sin
[1:37:42] is there right and that is our Deeds
[1:37:47] but the gift of God is
[1:37:49] eternal life through Christ Jesus
[1:37:52] something we don't deserve
[1:37:55] that is the reward
[1:37:57] that is the reward for saving God
[1:38:01] praise the Lord
[1:38:03] there is a reward
[1:38:05] for serving God
[1:38:08] whatever sacrifices you make for the
[1:38:10] kingdom of God would never go in vain
[1:38:14] whatever sacrifices you make
[1:38:16] in the service of the Lord it will never
[1:38:19] go even
[1:38:20] God would remember
[1:38:23] because if men being even know how to
[1:38:25] give good gifts to their children
[1:38:28] our heavenly father
[1:38:30] will remember your labor of love
[1:38:34] God will give you his holy spirit
[1:38:38] God Will Never Let You Down
[1:38:41] praise be to God
[1:38:43] will remember every sacrifice
[1:38:47] girls that behave yourselves
[1:38:51] God will remember
[1:38:54] your labor of love
[1:38:56] and every sacrifice you make for his
[1:38:58] kingdom God will remember it
[1:39:01] there was a story that was told
[1:39:04] I remember when I was doing not my
[1:39:06] national service I had done I was I was
[1:39:09] teaching in a TIA media Secondary School
[1:39:11] somewhere in Northern Ghana I thought
[1:39:13] that for two years and my Headmaster he
[1:39:16] was a Muslim and I had told a story I
[1:39:20] think I have since told that story maybe
[1:39:21] 20 30 times I don't remember
[1:39:24] now he said
[1:39:28] that a
[1:39:29] young man that completed his his uh a
[1:39:33] levels
[1:39:35] um here it will be the equivalent of
[1:39:38] high school
[1:39:39] he completed his a levels and now he
[1:39:42] wanted to go to university
[1:39:44] but there was no money he was Cash
[1:39:46] trapped
[1:39:47] so he went around selling books to be
[1:39:51] able to gather some money to go to
[1:39:53] school
[1:39:55] and
[1:39:57] he went to a village
[1:39:59] and in that Village there was a young
[1:40:01] girl
[1:40:02] and then he asked for water to drink
[1:40:05] and a girl went got him a cup of water
[1:40:09] and not only that but he emptied a tin
[1:40:13] of milk in that cup of water
[1:40:15] and then gave it to him to drink
[1:40:18] and then he drank that war
[1:40:21] and he was very very grateful
[1:40:23] then
[1:40:25] the girl said what are you selling so
[1:40:27] all their books
[1:40:29] uh can I can I can I see it the man said
[1:40:32] yes so she took it and just read the
[1:40:36] preface I said oh it's a nice book
[1:40:41] um let me go ask my daddy if he can buy
[1:40:43] me one he ran to his daddy
[1:40:46] with a book
[1:40:47] that he didn't have money
[1:40:50] so she came back and said I'm sorry
[1:40:54] um I couldn't daddy couldn't buy me the
[1:40:56] book
[1:40:57] and he felt so bad
[1:40:59] he felt so bad
[1:41:01] bad because he was
[1:41:04] sleep of these Book Sales
[1:41:06] he felt so bad that he couldn't give
[1:41:08] this girl the book
[1:41:11] but
[1:41:12] he asked the girl's name what is your
[1:41:14] name the girl told him his name
[1:41:17] and then he kept the name at the back
[1:41:20] part of his mind
[1:41:23] they never met again
[1:41:26] oh man
[1:41:31] finishes four years
[1:41:33] and I went into the medical school and
[1:41:35] he came out as a medical doctor
[1:41:38] and then he was posted to a village
[1:41:42] to go and save
[1:41:45] and he was there
[1:41:48] unknown to him
[1:41:51] this very girl
[1:41:53] was married and was also in the same
[1:41:56] Village
[1:41:59] and one day
[1:42:02] the doctor just left he had clothes for
[1:42:05] the day
[1:42:06] he went home
[1:42:08] I just want him to rest
[1:42:10] and here comes a call
[1:42:12] oh we have an emergency there is a lady
[1:42:15] that is in labor
[1:42:17] and she's at the point of death
[1:42:19] and she just he just took his things and
[1:42:22] just jumped and then rushed to the
[1:42:24] hospital
[1:42:25] and in fact if you know about some of
[1:42:28] the things that happened and uh I I I I
[1:42:31] I I I I I stayed in one one town
[1:42:35] in the northern region
[1:42:37] where a doctor
[1:42:39] a medical doctor
[1:42:42] killed
[1:42:43] 13 women
[1:42:46] who were in labor
[1:42:48] and they had complications and she had
[1:42:50] to operate on them
[1:42:53] this man killed all of them
[1:42:56] the 14th person was actually
[1:43:00] a friend
[1:43:02] a friends a friend's wife
[1:43:07] he was working at the Commercial Bank at
[1:43:09] the time
[1:43:10] and the man was so good the woman was so
[1:43:13] good and people went on their knees to
[1:43:15] cry to God
[1:43:17] that was the only woman that came out
[1:43:19] alive
[1:43:22] so it tells you how dangerous
[1:43:25] the things we take for granted here in
[1:43:27] America some parts of the world is not
[1:43:30] as easy as it is
[1:43:33] and this woman had to go oppression and
[1:43:36] they were scared to death
[1:43:39] and then she went through the surgical
[1:43:41] oppression
[1:43:43] mother was fine
[1:43:45] the baby was fine
[1:43:49] now
[1:43:50] they come to this next phase
[1:43:53] the next phase of the the hurdle
[1:43:56] you know how how expensive
[1:44:00] surgical operations are
[1:44:02] here in America I don't know how much
[1:44:04] but maybe it will be in the range of ten
[1:44:07] thousand dollars Maybe
[1:44:11] I don't know I don't think it would be
[1:44:12] anything nice
[1:44:15] so now this poor man
[1:44:20] had to raise money to go and pay for
[1:44:22] this surgical operation
[1:44:23] to get his family back
[1:44:25] and then he went and saw the food the
[1:44:28] food they had in their van that they
[1:44:30] were supposed to eat till the next
[1:44:31] season he went and sold everything
[1:44:34] and then he cut your animals and sold
[1:44:36] all their animals
[1:44:38] and it did not reach any way
[1:44:41] everywhere he went for help
[1:44:43] nobody could help him
[1:44:46] and then he ends up comes back to the
[1:44:48] hospital
[1:44:49] and then the mother he his wife and the
[1:44:54] baby they end up at the doctor's office
[1:44:57] and uh the doctor asked the woman
[1:45:01] um so
[1:45:03] um where have you lived before
[1:45:06] he said oh my parents uh gave birth to
[1:45:09] me he mentioned the place and blah blah
[1:45:11] blah blah blah blah blah then the doctor
[1:45:13] got to know this is the lady
[1:45:17] this is the lady
[1:45:20] so
[1:45:21] they were asking for the bill
[1:45:24] so the man said you know what just go to
[1:45:26] the accounts office and they'll tell you
[1:45:28] the bill you can pay on your way out and
[1:45:31] the mind you he didn't have the money so
[1:45:33] the doctor took a piece of paper and
[1:45:35] then he wrote on it paid with a tin of
[1:45:38] milk
[1:45:41] so
[1:45:43] it didn't make sense to them
[1:45:45] so they took it
[1:45:47] they went to the cashier
[1:45:49] they said this is your bill
[1:45:51] the man the man wanted to cry
[1:45:54] they said no but there is a note from
[1:45:56] the doctor it says paid with a tin of
[1:45:59] milk
[1:46:04] they say no we don't understand that
[1:46:08] so on their way out now
[1:46:11] the doctor came and said do you remember
[1:46:13] there was a young man several years ago
[1:46:16] that was selling books and then go to
[1:46:18] your village
[1:46:20] and then you give that man a cup of
[1:46:22] water
[1:46:24] is a yes
[1:46:26] are you the one who say yes I'm the one
[1:46:28] and the woman started crying he said yes
[1:46:31] that is paid that has taken care of the
[1:46:34] surgical oppression
[1:46:36] praise be to God now you look at a cup
[1:46:39] of water and a tin of milk
[1:46:42] how many does it cost in the U.S today
[1:46:43] not quite three dollars
[1:46:46] and then you substitute that for
[1:46:49] something that would cost ten thousand
[1:46:50] dollars it doesn't make sense
[1:46:52] that is what a reward does
[1:46:56] a reward far outweighs
[1:47:00] the wage
[1:47:04] there is nothing that compares
[1:47:07] to the reward of God
[1:47:11] whatever your toils are whatever your
[1:47:14] headaches are whatever your problems are
[1:47:16] whatever sacrifices you are making for
[1:47:18] the kingdom of God whatever it is that
[1:47:20] you are going through to serve God and
[1:47:22] to live right for God remember there is
[1:47:25] a reward awaiting you
[1:47:28] and even the Bible says
[1:47:30] that if you give a cup of cold water in
[1:47:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:47:35] is the reward for you
[1:47:37] praise be to God there is a reward for
[1:47:40] it
[1:47:42] we are not looking forward
[1:47:46] to what we deserve
[1:47:48] because what we deserve we don't even
[1:47:50] like it
[1:47:52] we don't deserve we don't like what we
[1:47:54] deserve the musicians can come over we
[1:47:57] don't we don't like what we deserve
[1:48:01] we are counting
[1:48:03] or what God has done we are counting on
[1:48:07] the reward of the almighty God
[1:48:09] we are looking up to God
[1:48:11] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:48:14] here is the bigger picture we are
[1:48:16] looking at and when you keep your focus
[1:48:19] on the bigger picture and you know it is
[1:48:22] such you and what you are capable of but
[1:48:25] it is God and what he has already done
[1:48:29] there is absolutely no way
[1:48:33] absolutely no way you are not going to
[1:48:36] make it right because we know that our
[1:48:39] God is able
[1:48:40] [Music]
[1:48:42] he gave his life for us he died in our
[1:48:45] place
[1:48:46] he took upon upon himself our shame and
[1:48:49] our reproach
[1:48:51] that we should be a free people
[1:48:56] there is so Power in the Blood
[1:49:00] there is still Power in the Blood to set
[1:49:02] the captives free
[1:49:04] there is so Power in the Blood
[1:49:08] to heal Heaven by every manner of
[1:49:10] sickness
[1:49:11] to heal any disease
[1:49:15] it could be spiritual
[1:49:18] it could be physical
[1:49:20] there is enough Power in the Blood
[1:49:24] to change any circumstances
[1:49:27] keep your eyes
[1:49:29] where your eyes belong
[1:49:32] don't look at yourself
[1:49:34] there is nothing good in a man
[1:49:37] right that we should be proud of
[1:49:39] God
[1:49:40] but when you keep your eyes on God
[1:49:44] there is no doubt whatsoever
[1:49:46] that God is going to see you through
[1:49:49] because he knows when you are dependent
[1:49:51] on him
[1:49:53] he knows you're not depending on your
[1:49:55] abilities
[1:49:57] he knows you're not depending on your
[1:49:59] capabilities or what you can do and what
[1:50:02] you cannot do
[1:50:03] right
[1:50:06] if there was anything a man could do
[1:50:08] then we don't need God
[1:50:16] praise be to God
[1:50:19] if there was anything we could do we
[1:50:21] don't need God
[1:50:24] but there was nothing we could do
[1:50:26] and the situation has not changed
[1:50:29] there is nothing a man can do
[1:50:32] we only have one way out
[1:50:36] is to keep our eyes
[1:50:39] on the bigger picture
[1:50:41] knowing that the picture is bigger than
[1:50:43] you
[1:50:44] there is a purpose in your life
[1:50:47] God has brought you here to serve his
[1:50:49] purpose
[1:50:53] we are not just here to just wonder true
[1:50:57] just get to the end of life and that is
[1:50:59] it
[1:51:01] we are here to serve the purpose of God
[1:51:05] that God
[1:51:07] through us
[1:51:10] will reveal himself
[1:51:13] to the world
[1:51:16] we are serving a living God
[1:51:19] praise be to God
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:37] praise the Lord
[1:51:43] I would just want us to go into a very
[1:51:45] short
[1:51:47] time of prayer
[1:51:49] [Music]
[1:51:55] I want us to go before the Lord this
[1:51:57] morning
[1:51:59] this afternoon
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:03] praise the Lord
[1:52:06] and to talk to God
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:11] the Bible has made it categorically
[1:52:13] clear
[1:52:18] now his word will not go out and return
[1:52:20] unto him void
[1:52:25] I believe with all my heart that God has
[1:52:27] spoken
[1:52:30] I don't know what you are going through
[1:52:32] I don't know what you are dealing with
[1:52:35] I don't know the storms that are in your
[1:52:37] path
[1:52:39] it is about time that you stopped
[1:52:42] looking at yourself
[1:52:44] if you could hurt yourself you would
[1:52:46] have helped Yourself by now
[1:52:50] but there is no man
[1:52:54] that can help himself in any way form or
[1:52:56] shape
[1:52:57] that we are all dependent on him
[1:53:01] and when you keep God before you
[1:53:04] if you are looking up unto God
[1:53:07] who is the author and the finisher of
[1:53:10] our faith
[1:53:11] he is going to see you three one way or
[1:53:13] the other
[1:53:16] and I just want us to pray this morning
[1:53:18] talk to God
[1:53:20] talk to God praise be to God

[1:53:56] and we believe that father oh God you
[1:53:59] are here this morning

[1:54:04] because you have told us
[1:54:07] that your wife would not go out and
[1:54:08] return unto devoid

[1:54:23] that you help us to keep our focus on
[1:54:26] you Lord
[1:54:28] to keep our focus on you
[1:54:31] there are a lot of thoughts
[1:54:34] in our path
[1:54:37] there are a lot of Trials
[1:54:39] a lot of Temptations
[1:54:42] a lot of things that your children are
[1:54:44] going through
[1:54:46] the only way we can overcome
[1:54:49] is by faith through Christ Jesus
[1:54:52] for the Bible says that you are the
[1:54:54] author and the finisher of our faith if
[1:54:57] we can only keep our focus on you
[1:55:02] it doesn't matter how big the mountains
[1:55:04] are in our way they are all going to
[1:55:06] dwell in the Lord
[1:55:08] it doesn't matter the size of the storm
[1:55:11] they are going to diminish
[1:55:14] but a lot of the times we come in our
[1:55:16] way Lord
[1:55:18] and we pray the father oh God that you
[1:55:21] have mercy upon us
[1:55:22] and help us to overcome in every aspect
[1:55:25] of Our Lives
