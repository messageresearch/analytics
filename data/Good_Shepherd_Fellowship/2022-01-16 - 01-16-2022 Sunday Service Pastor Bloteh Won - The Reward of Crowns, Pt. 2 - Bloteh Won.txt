keep your [Music] eyes on the lord many friends and your loved ones has lost [Music] is praise the lord god bless you musicians so thank you let's take our bibles and james chapter one last week we were talking on the rewards of crowns we want to continue today on that thought james chapter 1. let's read verse 12. just read one verse that in in james chapter 1. blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord have promised to them that love him praise the lord revelation chapter 2. revelation chapter 2 let's read from verse 8. this is told the seminar church is unto the angel of the church of simon right these things said the first and the last which was dead and is alive i know that works in tribulation and poverty but now i reach i know and i know the blasphemer of them which say they are jews and are net but they are the senegals of satan fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into praising that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life praise the lord and if we notice the crown of life james spokes about it tying it to trials and here you see at an age uh in the seven church ages also is promised the crown of life but it's also tied to trials and tribulation so let's bow our heads and trust that the holy spirit will help us this morning heavenly father we are so grateful lord and again to be in your house oh god we we are just surrounding ourselves to you lord almighty god father um we we want to pray that lord you will come come now lord and take your word and break it to our hearts so father we're just surrounding ourselves with god to you that father you will find a channel by the word of the gift to bring your word to your people this morning dear lord father we pray that your word will bring strength healing to god comfort the father rebuke the enemy lord jesus we just want to thank you father for all your wonderful blessings that you have blessed us with in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord praise the lord i i told uh this the sound team i will be referring back to my notes from last sunday but before then i will i would want them to project the tabernacle picture that brother george used on wednesday night uh he did a great job and uh god bless you brother george i know you're following the service from home family couldn't come but uh we we want to thank god for his grace upon your life and and i thought that was a that was a beautiful uh presentation teaching hesitation praise the lord and there was something that caught my attention first corinthians chapter one let's let's read that first corinthians chapter 1 praise the lord first corinthians 1 no not chapter 1 chapter 12. now chapter 1 chapter 12. the apostle paul says in first corinthians chapter 12 reading from verse 3 he said wherefore i give you to understand i want you to understand that no man's speaking by the spirit calleth jesus a curse amen any man blaspheming he's now speaking by the spirit it's not the holy ghost but then he also say that no man speaking by the spirit of god no and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost now so no man having the holy ghost is going to blaspheme the name of jesus amen and no man can confess the name of jesus except the holy ghost does that in him now so when brother george was speaking uh wednesday night and he was he was talking about uh the brazen altar year and right in here in the in the interview is where you have the seven golem candlestick praise the lord right in here is a type of the church ages that's where you have the seven church ages the seventh goal in canada state but the seventh golden candlestick is light from the brazing altar praise the lord now so when the worshiper comes through this door now that's that's the reason why the the understanding of the holy ghost has been has been misunderstood because just like paul says here uh in this verse that no man can call jesus the christ is our first confession so right from here the holy ghost start dealing with you until you go through here the holy ghost brings you to baptism is the holy ghost that have to convict your young heart that you need to be identified with jesus christ praise the lord so it's it's a holy ghost dealing right from here and even true here so you see all these experiences that you have with the holy ghost and you come into the holiest of holy you come through justification and sanctification and all of that you see with all of this dealing it's so easy to come short of going through the interview because you have had a lot of experience here you can confess jesus christ as your lord and savior a true confession of jesus christ as your lord and savior it has to be by the holy ghost praise the lord so do you have the holy ghost yes you have the holy ghost you confess jesus christ as your lord and savior you have the holy ghost because it has to be a work of the holy ghost [Laughter] praise the lord amen i reserved my coming and i saw it has to be a working of the holy ghost you see so that that has been the danger that has been the danger even through the ages when martin luther came with uh with uh with his revival of the just shall live by faith you know uh uh uh everybody that was that that that had a touch of god knew that that has to be god that would make a man to come against the system of that day come against the king of england come against the church praise the lord so you see that dealing if when god deals with you in one stage of your life praise the lord that's why you cannot dwell on experience experiences are good so i so uh you know i was sitting there in in uh and and looking at that so uh uh yes the the the the brazing the brazen altar you know where the the sacrifice is burned and then uh the larva the watching you know and year you go through this bill he spoke about this bill the worshiper coming in and then he goes through this ville and then go through this veil to go into the holiest of holy and just like we said commented a little bit after after the brother preaching wednesday night now this part of the tabernacle is is is lighting with the same light that is outside here that part of the tabernacle they have the sunlight the same light that the people outside have is the same light that is in that first part of the tabernacle are you understanding is the daylight amen now so you see when when when many of these people says uh you know uh uh we would just we would just we'll just preach the bible praise the lord all of those all of those move of god all of those uh uh churches around is the bible that they are preaching praise the lord he spoke about the minor falling out here you know and then the priest was supposed to take some of the mana from here and take it into this place you know it was wholly concentrated it never it never rots like like the rest of them that fall out here now so when the worshiper comes in here he's sustained by the daylight just like everybody that is outside and then when the worshiper gets in here he no longer have contact with the daylight what is providing light right in here is the seventh golden candlestick it's a seven golden candlestick that lighting displays now so uh uh with the light year of uh of uh the worshiper that is in here he needs constant oil to keep that light burning amen and the light right here also because it's a it's a lamp stain it can smoke and we know that that that smoke is is always according to the book of revelation is is tied to the bottomless pit is tied to demon powers so he has his greater battle right in here praise the lord amen he has his great about it right in here i mean he has uh he has understanding of the church ages and and everything is right in here praise the lord but just like i said because there was a dealing there was a dealing that pulls him into you it was christ dealing with his heart that pulls him into you he's getting close to god and god is dealing with his heart he went to water baptism and god is dealing with his heart he's getting closer here into a sanctified life it's all the dealing of the lord it's all the working of the holy ghost a man can be right here and say i have the holy ghost praise the lord he can say i have the holy ghost i had an experienced brother when i when i got in that truck oh my gosh i had an experience you know i i i i was dreaming and i was just in my dream i was lifting up to the clouds and you know i had a dream and you know i was i was praying to god and god broke my heart oh i cried or truly not i just cried i cried you can have an experience because it's all the dealing of the lord but you can come short of god when you stay with this experience they have just enlightened your heart your heart is just enlightening whatever experience you have here is not enough to carry you through you have the holy ghost i don't doubt it i don't doubt you have the holy ghost praise the lord just like the man that is in here that is having spiritual gifts he spoke in tongues he has high vision he you know gifts are right here this is where the gifts are the gifts of the preaching nine spiritual gift praise the lord five full ministry right in here right in here all on a seventh golden candlestick i lay my hands on the sick the sick got healed right in here i prophesied in tongues right in here praise the lord you see there is something there is something of the human nature we turn to be complacent until there's problem then we start to check and says was i okay was he okay praise the lord so you see but then coming through this field right here with the old testament tabernacle it was the high priest alone that goes in this field praise the lord amen that goes in this field now so god deals with the believer and brings the believer through this experience he gets right to you now he is our high priest praise the lord he is our high priest so you in yourself cannot go behind this bill it has to be the high priest only the high priest [Laughter] only the high priest the seven is messenger stay right here only the high priest not the pastor though [Music] [Laughter] our high priest christ jesus [Music] praise the lord so when it comes to this place right here i mean you got to be dead in love with jesus praise the lord i mean you got to take on this name you got to get go through the wedding and i mean all of that because i mean it takes him to take you in this field verbally says justification leads to sanctification it leads to the baptism of the holy ghost amen and the holy ghost lead to the holy ghost himself the person of jesus christ not the experiences the very person of jesus christ and that's when when you get behind this bill nothing else matters no man's ministry matters oh we appreciate all the seven goal in candlesticks praise the lord we appreciate the seventh goal in candlestick we appreciate the the lava we appreciate all of this but when you get behind this bill that's one thing that matters is beholding his face praise the lord oh i thought it was a beautiful beautiful preaching on wednesday night amen well let's go to what we want to talk about i've already taken half of my time just sharing with you what i was enjoying [Laughter] that was what i was enjoying through the service wednesday night i was just sitting there and said okay okay because you see the people we we we turn to uh make the holy ghost you know only this place is the person of jesus christ that's that's the finality that is the embodiment you know that is the embodiment but just like brother branham talked through i i saw brother george reference to that a little bit through the true the plant life from the seed amen to the pauline and all through the different stages of life like brother branham said uh seed is not here with the shark he said they were all the carrier of the life it's not it's not only when you get here before you have the life you have the life it's a carrier of the life the spirit is carrying the life through the believer bringing him through different experiences praise the lord amen now you see that's what happened even with with with the young people you know people get uh to the place and you know uh uh i mean i'm not i'm not gonna i'm you know it's not a blasting game it's just trying to share with you you know the grace that the way i look at the world you get to the place where god is dealing with the heart of a young believer a young young young brother young sister uh just a child maybe eight years old and comes and says papa i want to be baptized and he says why you want to be baptized oh you know i've i've given my heart to the lord jesus i want to be baptized and the parents go and start talking to the child and like peter said that child has already had a good conscience towards god amen and a good conscience towards god do not come by our natural birth it has to come by god dealing with their heart now so uh okay this child now uh want to be baptized then you see and and the church the church idea is there that we give them all of these 20 rules to follow you need to do this you need to do this you need you know the message say don't do this you know do this you never do so we do all of that well that the child keep pressing on and they still want to be baptized they get baptized now because of our understanding of the holy ghost wanting the fullness we don't appreciate the dealing of god from this place we don't we don't cherish it we don't guide it to realize that it's the holy ghost that is dealing with this child for them to even fall on their bedside and pray for them to even sit down and and and say lord jesus bless my food and father provide for those that don't have we don't even cherish it because all in our mind where this mother don't have the holy ghost you're looking for a fullness so we create a lot of struggle and battle year because the the early dealing of the holy ghost was not cherished we create a lot of confusion for the young mind of this child are we together but no man can call jesus the christ except by the holy ghost praise the lord well let's go to our i will talk this morning if the lord will be gracious to us and help us you know it's our responsibility as as parents and as uh as church leaders to be able to keep keep watch on those things because uh uh you know you you hear brother branham picking up in in in in the prayer line where he talks about a child god never you know a child was was you know was was you know got afraid because something happened or because they were yellow and that thing kind of a trouble their spirit you know it created nervousness in them it created a sense of fear in them and then they have to deal with that the rest of their life the same thing happened with our spiritual growth you know it happens with our spiritual growth because our our our early dealing of the lord is not even considered as the holy ghost it's not considered as the holy ghost that is not the holy ghost we just take the terminology you just justify you don't have the holy ghost yet because it's not considered a dealing of the lord that's the reason why there is a lot of works a lot of human effort we try to work our way and you find people practicing the the the statue of the perfect man i i think i have faith now brother branson victor you got to get yourself under control temperature everything starts becoming a just a hemo workout it becomes a human workout and there is something about human beings something about humans when when you have when you have experienced failures in doing certain things you don't trust it anymore so when a person practice religion practice how to be holy you can practice it you have to learn to appreciate the grace of god that is dealing with you and is bringing you when the person practice all of those things and it gets to the place where the they keep feeling they keep feeling they keep feeling they realize that it's not working they don't know what to trust again because they were not trusting in christ they were not trusting in god they were trusting in the way they've been taught you have to do this to stop there you have to do this to stop this you have to do this to stop this praise the lord now so we're talking about the rewards of crowns and we read from the philadelphia church age a crown what is a crown a crown means that you have a domain and i was looking at i was i was studying yesterday then looking at this this uh you have to realize that the the bible was originally translated from the hebrew to the greek the greek was the language in those days and uh you know so it's not it's not all about trying to master languages but sometimes it gives you it gives you a broad idea for you to be able to look at the subject when you look at some of these things through the the concordance or the lesson con now i was i was looking at that as i was studying last night realized that uh you know brother branham saying here the crown means dominion like like i said many of the time in the way that uh we we think about receiving our crowns we look to receive our crowns after this life we look to receive our crown it's true there there are crowns that we will receive but we have to realize that uh uh you know uh malta will not inherit immortality you know so those crowns that uh you know is is is is it's beautiful to realize that uh you know the bible talks about the crown the righteousness the crown of light the crown of glory you know and and all of these different crowns and and the bible did not talk about the crown of siva the crown of brides and the crown of gold but it talks about a crown of righteousness in the crown of life so you will realize that is is uh you know is is uh uh things that god bring his his children through and uh like i said i was looking at this and looking at the word crown year i find this uh this word and uh uh is like exosa is kind of a greek word that's the pronunciation there it means the power of choice liberty of doing as one pleases praise the lord the power of choice could also be a crown i actually want to just look at uh uh uh this morning the crown of life talking about tribe but you know it's it's hard to get away from these things when you you you know keep your mind on then think about uh uh danny henry and prophecy over brother branham you know uh that baptist boy coming and prophesying you know speaking in tongues and prophet signing and you know uh uh in in the french language and and there were three witnesses to be able to give a divine interpretation of what it means because of the choice that you have made a huge a huge portion of heaven praise the lord so god was crowning the choice just like the bible says moses made a choice to choose to be identified wave the the the the bricks uh uh uh build us or the children of israel the slaves to choose to be identified with them you know then to to let and sleep in the wealth and the riches it was a choice that he made and god crowned his choice praise the lord amen so there is there is a crown to every choice that we make praise the lord amen if you make a good choice for the live spies god can cry in you with a good wife or a good husband and if you make a wrong choice also you you will get whatever choice you made you get a crown for it let me praise the lord amen that's the reason why solomon can say it's uh you know a good wife is is a crown it's a jewel of crown to a man you know but uh uh a nagging woman is is you know watered in his blood but i'm trying to bring out the the thought that uh you know because um as we go along uh i'm you know that's that's my inspiration i feel like we are in the crowning age i feel like this age is the crowning age you know i can take my defense in the world this is the age where has the promise that he that overcome will sit with me in my throne even as i've overcome it's the throne is a domain just like the crown is a domain so laodicea age in itself is a crowning age but more than more than ever we're beginning to see that this age is going to be crowned with the person of jesus christ in the life of the bride because it's going to be is going to be christ in bright form and this age is also going to be a crime with a person of the devil amen amen don't you believe it don't you see the other things that is on the newsfeed and all the things that is happening weakness has rise to such uh you know such a place it's almost like men are losing uh uh uh you know uh sanitating your mind with some of the things that you're doing it's a grounding it's a crowning praise the lord and i can navigate over but it's even here a song a sign of the husband authority over his wife it's also a crowning the veil which with which uh the veil with which uh properly required for a woman to cover herself it was her crown praise the lord so all of those things i'm just only trying to bring us to the place to realize that we're not talking about mental crown or you know one that is made out of wood or ones that is made out of brass you know even our lord jesus they had to make a crown out of tom's and place it on his head so looking over here in the book of james and in the book of revelation it brings out how the trial of our faith the trial of our life and that god is talking to that church ages because that church aged because of what they were going to go through you know and and god is promising them that he will crown them with life praise the lord amen and last week uh you know just just for the review we we look at uh some few things also that uh i just want to quickly go over some of them [Music] night in time and sign one of the horriblest thing is to see a man or a woman that constantly complain i've always thought god keep me from it that weakens faith all the time complaining weakens faith i i know as as as they get older each one of us we are going we are going to get something happening and something will happen and i know those those little things are going to keep accumulating that as you get older they just gotta but i think one of the most horrible things is for satan to crown some person's life a crab at all man or or woman i hope that i don't get to that place i hope that i can bear it as my burden and get to a spot where i want my life crowned with the glory of god i want my life crowned with his long suffering with gentleness with peace and meekness so you see uh uh just like i said this is it's a crowning age we are living in you see that satan can also crown the person's life you know to be crabbed as last martial he can crown the person life to be stubborn he can crown the person alive with i mean with with evil thoughts and immorality he can cry in the present life to be blood tested all he wants to do is just to share blood and and all of these things praise the lord so you you see there there are there all of these things happening around us but god is also crowning his children life amen giving us grace and giving us a a passion to be able to deal with one another and deal with situations around us we we have to wash those things amen we have to wash your sins and just trust that the law will be able to help us amen and another thought here but banham says those indulge he says what if the president will say i have come to take you and i have the authority to do that and make you the president of the united states you are going to have to give up something what if the queen wanted you to make you a queen of england you did have to give up you have to give it up but jesus gave us a crown of life that we never give up now this is the thought the thought here is that brother branham says if you were giving an offer to become the president of united said no matter how long you stay there your term will be over that's what he means by giving it up no matter how long you stay there your turn will be over if you were giving the opportunity if your turn does not get over you die it will be over it will come to an end but here is an offer here that that that that god is offering a crown of life amen he's offering us a crown of life so he said but jesus gave us a crown of life that we never give up an incorruptible crown of his glory we don't have to give it up he give it he gave it to us it's a blessing amen is the holy spirit that he want to crown our life wave how could we be so indifferent to turn it away amen and uh and and you see and and and all of that i just want to pick up some of these things and and uh uh joshua i mean zacchaeus the businessman another taught right here he was talking about zacchaeus and uh and and this thought he he he took it in a way where uh zacchaeus had his affiliation with with uh you know uh uh the move the the sanhedrin's council in that day because he was a businessman and uh and and his wife has started to to believe the lord jesus and to go with the disciples but there was something that was that was holding him and and that's what he's taking this thought from he says that crown of that denominational creed that you are holding onto so you see some doctrine or understanding and belief can be a crown in a person's life praise the lord amen a person can be crowned with with such an idea and they just think it's it's my revelation you know and and you know they just believe that you know no matter how the holy spirit express it in another way no you are you are completely wrong this is the way i see this is and they are so crowned in that way that they cannot even fellowship with another brother they cannot even appreciate when a man says this is the way i see it praise the lord you see and that is the thing that makes uh uh the pentecostal movement to fill when they make speaking in tongues as the initial evidence of the holy ghost and the plenty that i stick down praise the lord they planted that down as long as you spoke in tongues oh brother you have a glory be to god you have made it you just broke behind the veil then what does it do to the human nature it makes the man to relax i've already arrived praise the lord and you find those very same people speaking in tongues living like the devil so you see it's a crown of understanding it's a crown of of creed that a person takes to their life and with that you cannot move on with god praise the lord now so you have uh [Music] all of this we we also look based on uh the last time uh blasphemous name bravo mean breathe on mean spirit of the living god breathe on me that's my prayer just let the holy ghost breathe oh my for the for the breath of god what it is seal away in the kingdom of god knowing that when i i first confess i believe jesus christ then now this is something he's saying that we could apply to what we we spoke about earlier i would take the thought again i go back he says breathe on me breathe them in spirit of the living god breathe on me that's my prayer just let the holy spirit breathe all mine for the breath of god was what is it sealed away into the kingdom of god nor in there when i first confess i believe the lord jesus then he comes down to the statute of the prophet man and he says then to my faith i vets you godly that's you and then my vets you are knowledge of the word of god to my knowledge our temper and self-control i like that amen my country states today crown my soul with self-control from sea to shining sea praise the lord amen now so uh patience all mine tested don't you worry sit and we sit on we'll try them for you i'm climbing up the ladder now i have other virtual knowledge temperance now and i have got to our passion i still under the holy ghost and after i passion i had godliness and you know all of that but this is word i got caught in this is where he talks about crowning my soul with self-control praise the lord amen so you realize that the in in our walk with god in the way that he deals with us god our crime of life or our our crowns the different crowns that he give us is now only after this life amen i even in this life like even the crown of righteousness that the rational joy shall give us we don't need a a righteousness it's more needed year than there amen it's more need a year than there so you see god brings a man just like the bible says god counted abraham righteous god deals with a man in such a way where he he brings him to a place and he can crown his life with with a virtue it's the dealing of the lord after he had gone through trials he have gone through different things in his life and god can just crown him like i said last sunday look at joseph the bible says he was a righteous man amen god knowing that he's going to to bring his life through a young woman she's she just a young girl i mean she has she has all the young uh uh age pressure on her but yet he needed a man to to protect that gift amen so he found a man that is crowned with righteousness a man that would not be history to condemn mary bible says he was a just man praise the lord that he would not even he don't even want to embarrass her i don't understand this but i'm not going to say nothing against it that god will bless a man with such an attitude in the time of crisis in the time of crisis he's so calm i would just put her away privately i believe the head of sat down with him joseph you cannot be a fool this this girl has been has been playing around and now and and and all of that in and he just sat there listening to them if joseph had a wrong attitude an angel wouldn't have visited him if he had the attitude about this that's what you young girls can do you know you're just uh you're running around and doing all sorts of things what a disgrace you are there will have been no place in his heart for god to witness to all praise the lord so am i waiting for their crown after this life why some are receiving it in this life some are receiving it in this life oh my now i've i mentioned this i didn't read it last week but i mentioned it and uh wisdom versus faith now if you have internal life today you are in god by god being in you you are god's expressed thoughts they don't listen to any reasoning least your crown be taken and giving to another don't take reasoning at all just believe what god said is the truth stay with it let's draw a little bit on the top of least your crown be taken and giving to another praise the lord amen you see it it does not have anything to do with salvation because there you can see the prophet of god spirit out if god has saved you you have internal life your crown does not have to do anything with your salvation the crowns that god gave to his people and his children are for our reward he's rewarding them praise the lord revelation chapter 3 verse 11. this was a message to the philadelphia church age let's just take this verse he says behold i come quickly hold that fast wish that have that no man take that crown praise the lord now god will not express that thought if it was not possible for your crown to be given to others are we together just i just want us to sing in a little bit because i know the wheels are working i know that spiritual wheel is spinning in you glory be to god and it's just good for us to just just uh allow that word to soak in a little bit amen how fast that wish that half that no man take that crown now jesus in his in in his many parables about the kingdom where he gave talents to his seventh there is one parable where he gave talent to this seven and he buried and he says i know my master you know he's uh he's he's a guy that likes uh profit when he when he does not do no work so i'm going to keep this i'm not going to do nothing with him and jesus talks and says how the master came and took that talent from him and gave it to another man jesus took it from the one that was doing nothing and gave it to the one that was already he he the the half net is taken from and he they have is giving talk praise the lord i know as a young believer how that scripture troubled my mind how it troubled my mind i stated on that and and i think it's this very message wisdom wisdom versus faith where uh uh no it is not wisdom versus faith faith is work express i was studying that message many years ago and then i came to understand the meaning of of what of what was said but let's let's get back to to touch here yeah so you you realize here now that a crown can be taken and given to another praise the lord amen and in most cases you know uh a scriptural sense is in the in the place of of reward and and uh that the lord gives to our life like i said last week you know since of god we have to believe that out of these years god has not been playing games with our life unless you've been playing games god have not been playing games praise the lord if he said he will have a bride with our spot wrinkle he going to have a bride he have already sent a message praise the lord to sweep that bride seven times around the world that voice of malachi fold echo so god god has not been playing games praise the lord i will share something with you but let's let's just do it on this uh uh a little bit so you realize that uh uh you know when when we give our heart to the lord and we accept the lord you know as our lord and savior the the the question of salvation the bible says is a free is a free gift that god give to us now is that place of where god is trying to bring a son or a daughter to build characters in their life praise the lord amen is that place of word god is trying to bring a son or a daughter bring a man or a woman to build character in their life and even as young people sometimes you know for for what the future that god knows about you he's going to allow things to happen praise the lord and it's almost like well that uh uh you know it's hard to be able to find a friend maybe god don't want you to find friend now god wants you to have him as a friend and and sometimes it looks like you know i know nobody want me in all of that and all of these different things that happen that we try to make a people problem it's never people problem is the almighty god trying to bring us to the place where he can trust us and crown our life praise the lord what is what is the benefit of having the best man the most harmful man the most rich man as your husband and you don't have jesus what's the benefit praise the lord and so you see all of that all of those all of those things you realize that i've said a story yet about luther before he came to convection and even john wesley john grew in the house of faith we know the story about his uh mother susana and and all of that and he gave his heart to the law as a young man you know and he would pray he was a prayer warrior he was a young boy that was pulled out of fire you know he he had out of this experience but do you realize that john wesley said all of those things that he did he was not converted until he even came to the u.s on the convention he came to have a revival year in the u.s it was on his way back when he met some dutch man some dutch man means man that was already affected by the revival of luther i mean he has gone he was he was ministering praise the lord so he just he he grew as a young man that uh you know that that love god you know and loved going to church but to really have that fire tender in his heart praise the lord the same thing with uh luther you can see in in this man's life why you know like brother branham would talk talks about uh uh uh he talks about irenas he says why that you know uh i think polycarp was now choosing as the messenger of the age even though he was one of the man that was heaven in his age so you see it takes it takes a man or a woman in the way that god is dealing with them to be able to take a position with christ luther with everything that was happening i mean he went to school he wanted to be a monk he dedicated himself he he crawled on his knee he had himself to bleed i mean all of those things he stayed fair his heart was far away from god he was doing everything the church asked him to do he said well i think it has to i have to get down there to rome i have to see what i got to get there to the vatican and understand what do i need to do because i'm doing everything that i know have to do yet i don't have peace with him and when he got over to vatican he saw the filthiness of of the people that caught himself holy and the things that are happening behind the black veil and the white veil my goodness but he remember a friend quoted to him before josiah chapter 2 praise the lord on his way back just like i said when a person believe in a system and trust that system that's the thing that is making people around this message so scared to death because instead of going behind that veil and keeping our eyes on jesus we have stopped with a message we have stopped with a prophet [Music] and now people beginning to say everything that we are scared to do oh that i lost my life you mean i gave my life even it's because you did not go beyond the veil we are scared to death what if we were wrong it's not now that you were wrong you've been wrong ever since praise the lord oh now so all of these different things we realize the other now let's let's see let's let's take an example here and then and see this uh uh let's take this from index man and some of you some of you ladies with long hair says she's all faction see remember there's scuffers that's a crown that you are wearing the crown is not your natural head the crown is the obedience to god's word are we together amen he says that's the crown you are wearing god said it was your glory so you see he associate in the crown with god's word now with your natural head where with pride hallelujah where is with pride as you will wear a crown of tongues for your lord worthy with pride let me let me take another one here and uh but you see that uh uh in the way that he's he's bringing this thought is that uh you are taking position with the word and then you've been scoffed at praise the lord now many times where people get off track or people get you know embarrassed is because they are not they are not looking at the word they think about their own repetition the thing about their image that has been laughed at praise the lord they think about their personality and says oh my god you know what what an embarrassment he was trying to bring to me can you imagine a person like that talking to me now you see right there you have you have you have separated yourself if i can say in a literal way you have taken that crown off your head praise the lord because you are now making it your amen and yourself and you are not honoring the word that have brought you to that place praise the lord now you see that that is the thing uh of that out of the saints in the in the dark ages that were able to give their body to be burned and they were able to face uh you know the lion then and all of that the thing that they had in mind was the word they were doing it because of christ those men i was nailed to the tree and they said no i don't want to die like my lord turned me off saddam burma to this i'm not even water to die like jesus so they hide him on your mind that's the reason why they could bravely embrace their suffering the reason why this age cannot stand and uh try and and scoffing is all because we are filled with ourselves if we have christ on our mind no matter what somebody said about you no matter what they do to you you have crash on your mind he's the one that you want to be glorified i live my life for jesus they could go to the state to be burned because they know that they counted a privilege they counted a privilege because they had him on their mind they were not thinking about their they despised their own life [Music] but let someone say something you mean me who are you where you think you are praise the lord so you see sometimes it's in those ways especially you young people that have come into a different world the word is not the same that your parents live in it's not the same praise the lord amen the word is not the same the word has become more fake than ever before praise the lord nothing nothing is real nothing is real it's only the life of jesus christ only the living god is real amen praise the lord a man can turn turn out to be a loving brother and tomorrow he turned out to be the worst hypocrite praise the lord but especially with the the visual reality world that we are breaking into praise the lord you know i was just i was just reading that last night but branham talks about us being in three dimensions talks about living in three dimensions but when he talked about the fourth dimension he says the fourth dimension is right here so actually we are living in four dimensions praise the lord are we together oh my let's share something together i pray that the law will will uh okay efficient chapter 3. efficient chapter 3. i'll just read a verse here and then i'll go on what i want to say maybe another time we will have time to spend spend time on there now in ephesians chapter 3 the apostle paul says something and [Music] it took a profit in this age to be able to make us to understand what what actually paul was referring to verse 17 he says that christ may dwell in your heart by faith and that ye been rooted and granted in love may be able to comprehend with the saints which with the sins with the sins what is the breath let me take that over again that christ may dwell in your heart by faith that ye being rooted and granted in love may be able to comprehend with the saints what is the birth the length the depth and the height those are four dimensions and there's the four dimensions that we live in i even be able to comprehend with the sins what is the birth the lame the depths and the height and to know the love of god which passes understanding that ye may be filled with all the fullness of god now so you will see when he talks about the dimensions he talks about we are living in three dimensions the reason why he says that is because the fourth dimension is invisible to our eyes praise the lord amen and that's the reason why but when he talks about the fourth dimension he says there are voices that are going through this place so it's part of our dimension you see and and that is the reason why uh uh this age has been allowed to be the way it is this technology age is to be able to bring us the reality of that fourth dimension that is right here that is right here praise the lord it's right here we i mean the fourth dimension has has now become part of our life we can go anywhere without gps we can't find anything without google search you are living in the fourth dimension it's part of our life it's part of our life praise the lord oh it used to be oh no i i you know you know television where brother says the fourth dimension is right in your pocket it's right in your pocket praise the lord now so you know sometimes you grab you get in this place and then you you it seems to be you almost kind of for losing your your touch here because my mind is just kind of trying to stay on something here now so you you realize that uh i mean it's the time the age that we are living in my time is on me now so i gotta kind of close this thing up somewhere i gotta close this thing up somewhere but i will i will i will use the code i used last week to close present state of my ministry and let me let me say something to to us this morning as uh as brothers and sisters but says this it is usually such a time as this when man has stayed truth to the word and all men has forsaken him until god stepped in defense of that person and crown his ministry praise the lord i was i was studying that message last night and uh he talks and he he go ahead and he says that's right what a consolation what a consolation is built in the promise of god's word no matter what the word says what the word does that's not our hope is is not built in what the word our hope is not built in what the world is doing you remember that the message standing in a gap was preached from an experience of god seven having a complex because of the people rejecting him but yet want to use his gift brother branham you know i have this problem burbank and you have a vision of this broadband this that but he was not he was not uh they were not receiving the word so he got a complex and and he he was making a decision to just get out of the field and just still there and god told him if you do that if you do that he says your wife is going to leave you praise the lord and you're going to destroy your life you're going to destroy your ministry and the rest of that now so jerry said the other uh a man because when brother brahm talks about presentation of his ministry it was it was describing a time that will come which of course i believe we are in that time now so you have to realize like he said is two things that happen before god crowns a man's ministry god has to bring him to the place where all have forsaken him he said it's usually a time when man has still truth to the word and all have forsaken them praise the lord amen the crowning of john the baptist's ministry never came when he was standing on jordan when he said behold the lamb of god that took away the sin of the word that was not the crowning of his ministry john ministries was crowned when he was in prison and he sent his disciples and said you go and ask him praise the lord amen i mean with all the time that he has preached and everything that he did and and this mighty man that rolls up on the river jordan is now sitting in prison and he's even out to the place word he's saying things that sound confusing praise the lord amen he's saying things that are sounding confusing when he was a very woman that says there was one among us whose shoes i'm not wanted to loose praise the lord he's identifying the messiah but yet at the end of his ministry he said go and ask him is he the one amen praise the lord but brahman says you could say john has lost it he has deceived us out of this year he has lost it praise the lord amen he's beware he said you can say that he has lost it i just i just took these fuses and placed them in there but they are writing the message there jesus he's crowned on easter morning on the resurrection [Music] now you mean his ministry never got crowned when he failed five thousand when he fell five thousand people his ministry was not crowned even when he raised lazarus from the dead after being there four days a man gone into corruption and his ministry was not crowned it took his death his burial and his resurrection praise the lord daniel god sealed his ministry with the changing of the king's heart not even being in the lion damn that was not a crown of his ministry god crowned his ministry by changing a gentile king heart and ass and and the king commanding his entire kingdom to worship the god of daniel but brandon says that was the crowning of daniel's ministry he said jacob a supplanter to a prince of god when he walked out the next morning with his ministry crown praise the lord amen he says he did not care again what is isa did he tried to appease either tried to send gifts because he was so filled with fear but when he met god and his life was changed he came out with his life being crowned praise the lord trying to find a place to close here just bear with me god seven that state truth to the word that god sealed their ministry with a crowning time a time of grounding a time a period of time where god will allow things to happen that's what i said i believe that this is the crown in time because there has never been the time where this message of the hour has been on such an attack men that were born in the message man that were with the prophet man that that saw i mean all of those things never been the time praise the lord god seven said truth to the word that god see his ministry with the crowning of life sometimes people think that uh you know the crowning of the of of of a man's ministry is when the church is growing all praise the lord because it's just only growing for its time of trials it's just growing for its time of trials because we must have it whether we like it or not we must have it my prayer is god keeping truth to your word that's my prayer praise the lord amen that's my prayer and your people just taking all sorts of silly things i'm just talking to a young man and i'm advising him you know go on on the internet and and let me say this let me say this about about internet search praise the lord do you know that there's a steady they have that they have been able to to see the effects of video game just has the same effect of a person that is on pornographic site and and the line of the study is the thing that gives the desire for someone to be in a killing game or the vampire game that that same desire that that makes it's all it's all the word of visual reality that is coming to us that a person would get in the in uh you know in you know in a video game and see how many person here they want to bust you know that that that inner drive for evil that inner drive you know uh uh for for uh uh how much fear you can stand you know it does not look like it's not real it's just a movie but but it's it's vampire is blood that the the thing that that is that is uh uh uh uh looting you that is attracting you to that evil to you it's just a string you know it's fake you know but the thing that is driving you to that is is the same thing that drive a man to filth praise the lord so that's that's the thing check it out for yourself when you get on your search board when you want to search as soon as you put two words the the the the engine is able to generate what you are looking for because it knows the kind of things you search for it helps you the system has already now developed it has got itself associated with your your things you like to look for so as soon as you pull one word you're not even looking for that amen you're trying to look for holy ghost but because you like looking at ghost movie the computer now is ready to tell you there is a bloody ghost always sound funny you sound funny wait until you start lose dealing with a child that is losing their mind and start hearing voices in their ears that's when you will know that it's not a funny thing i'm talking about the crown in time a crowning time is this time that we are living in oh i believe that this is the time that god is going to crown this message i believe that he's crowning this message with people that have gone through tough things in their life but they still love the lord jesus the same thing praise the lord because it has to be a period of time i mean brother brethren in the stage of his ministry he talks about not having invitation to go to go to places people are not uh inviting him for him to go to places but the the ministry was not honor you know it was not nobody could say anything wrong about that man they were just not allowing him in their pulpit praise the law they will not sponsor his campaign but it never came to a time where uh uh uh you know it never came to a time where the the the message was forsaken and people uh will say all sorts of things about it all sorts of things about it until the young internet generation are beginning to feed on those things and is beginning to create question in their mind praise the lord they are beginning to feed on those things and things proper on their phones and and things properly and and and go and wash wash those things the brother sent me in a video one time and and he put brother brandon picture behind by the el bisco pulpit i told him i said brother i never even read whatever quote you sent me because what you did to me is is is to mean is is uh whether i say circulation whatever you i mean i mean it don't make him a prophet if you put his poopy behind here it don't make us to shows that i mean we are really standing with the message that you got to copy his picture and make him to look like he's preaching in good shape for fellowship what what is that what is that that people will not even say happy new year without copying the cult of brother brandon it's it's not it's the it's the effect of the the visual reality that the expression is not even from a heart to say oh sister happy new year god bless you i have to take a 1965 quote of brother branham and send it it's don't get me wrong don't get me wrong if i'm taking a court and sending it and having my own expression oh may this prayer to brother brandon be a blessing to you may this quote a brother brandon be an encouragement to you but it's not just a copy pasting there is no attachment there is no reality in it some don't even read it they send it to me you see it a couple all my mind contact you and send it to them and then you realize you have received this code ten different times because it's just in cycle it shows that yeah we are in the message we're going in rapture we are sending the same code to one another oh praise god what a unity it's a fake unity it's a fake unity let my expression if i say god bless you let it be my own expression i can take psalm 24 and attach it to my phone i said and let this time bring joy to your heart i can take a coat of brother brandon and send it to you and say look i read this thing it was a blessing i hope it's a blessing to you praise the lord all of you young people you sit in your room you're in the quiet of your room you're watching things and looking at things you have to know that you are dealing with a dimension that is older than you praise the lord and as you watch those things they are spirits that are around that don't want the good of your life they don't want you to enjoy the blessings of these holy ghosts that we're talking about and the devil will do everything praise the lord all he want to do is to just solve one doubt in your spirit and you start having problems is this thing really truth i mean it just been brother brandon brother brandon brother branham he just want to sort that out and you might keep it to yourself and it will eat you away it will take every desire for you to listen to a tape because now you are doubting the prophet it will take every desire you will hear the word of god and what is this you know brother brown says that thing will kick up in you first prophet you are on a demon influence you have opened yourself to a spiritual world that if god don't come to your rescue you will soon put your post on facebook praise the lord and because we feed on this on the smartphone we get smart answers our answers are not earnest again it's smart just find the smartest thing smartest little cheek that you can give to get away i hope he cried my ministry with this of letting me take the clothes of the world and dress his bride in the clothes of the world and for his righteousness but ram says i hope he crown my ministry with this praise the lord i hope he crowned my ministry that there will be people that will take this word and dress themselves the bible says the bride make herself ready you must take the word and apply it to the need in your life take the word amen and say god i need you in this area of my life i hope you were crying and let me stand there that day saying behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the word there is so many hills to climb sometimes it gets hard but the one the point the pathway knows just what is best he knows what best the toad of the road will seem nothing when we get to the end of the way let homes for the bloody footprints just remember friends the saying has been watched in the footprints that's what is happening the same has been watched in
