[40:20] when next we come around it will be
[40:22] testimonies to your glory father we

[40:37] not our heart B within us as you spoke
[40:39] with us along the way let this be our
[40:42] testimony in the mighty name of Jesus
[40:44] Christ we pray amen amen praise the Lord
[40:48] amen glad to be in your midst again
[40:51] tonight um let's turn the Bibles to the
[40:54] Book of Genesis Chapter 18
[41:00] verse 13 and
[41:03] 14 The Book of
[41:07] Genesis Chapter
[41:09] 18 vers 13 and
[41:15] 14 I'll start
[41:18] reading and the Lord said unto
[41:21] Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying
[41:26] shall lie of a shorty be a child which
[41:30] am
[41:31] old is anything too hard for the Lord at
[41:37] the time appointed I will return unto
[41:40] thee according to the time of life and
[41:43] Sarah shall have a son may the Lord add
[41:47] blessings to the reading of his holy
[41:48] word you can please be
[41:52] seated once again you are welcome to the
[41:54] house of the Lord um it's a great thing
[41:57] to be in God's presence you know the
[41:59] prophet told us there's no better place
[42:01] to be than in the presence of the Lord
[42:05] you know and when you respond to the
[42:07] word of God God is obligated to you amen
[42:12] so tonight we are looking at the Salmon
[42:14] titled the God of all
[42:17] possibilities the God of all
[42:21] possibilities we can see even in where
[42:23] we have read God himself Affirmed that
[42:27] is anything too hard for the Lord and we
[42:31] know that the answer is no yes there is
[42:34] nothing too hard for the Lord to do too
[42:38] so if you consider your situation maybe
[42:41] your own is very special let me tell you
[42:44] tonight that God Specializes in those
[42:47] special cases amen hallelujah and he's
[42:50] ready to do them amen praise the Lord
[42:53] right I have a little quote I want to
[42:55] read
[42:57] um then Jesus came and called
[43:01] 6423 paragraph 19 he said all things are
[43:05] possible to them that can believe yes
[43:08] are we together am you the ball is now
[43:11] in your court if you can't believe then
[43:14] you can have what you desire said that
[43:18] is his word but imposs but Impossibles
[43:22] are made manifested when God is taken at
[43:26] his word
[43:28] yes sir when God is taken at his word
[43:32] the impossibilities are made manifest
[43:35] amen When God says it will be then you
[43:39] take that word and watch what The
[43:43] Impossibles happen it certainly will
[43:48] Hallelujah so the condition for us to
[43:51] make things that seems impossible to
[43:53] become possible is to take God at his
[43:56] word am that means we bring that word do
[44:00] written in the Bible look historical or
[44:04] some story if we can bring them back to
[44:07] present tense then the god of the
[44:09] presence or present will do the same
[44:12] thing amen we should know how to bring
[44:14] God to the present tense amen that's
[44:17] what God wants amen where we have just
[44:20] read we all know the story of Abraham
[44:23] God promised him you know of God's Own
[44:27] Accord nothing to do with Abraham but
[44:30] God promised him and then after 25 years
[44:34] God came down I think on the 24th year
[44:38] and then like we read three people came
[44:41] and appeared to Abraham and then I
[44:44] Believe by Revelation he must have seen
[44:46] them and knew that they were not
[44:48] ordinary men you know and he invited
[44:51] them inside come in have something
[44:54] before you continue your journey
[44:56] Hallelujah am and we found out according
[44:59] to the prophet that something was
[45:02] happening in the tent of Abraham just
[45:05] before that
[45:07] visitation that perhaps Sister Sarah
[45:11] maybe she had some news from Sodom how
[45:15] Mrs lot you know getting I mean getting
[45:19] things done properly having the worst of
[45:21] the world and no doubt Sarah must have
[45:24] been scolding Father Abraham that look
[45:26] why will you allow your boy even the
[45:30] nephew you know to make the First Choice
[45:34] you should have the right of first
[45:36] refuser you know you don't know your
[45:38] right you don't know what to do we know
[45:40] when things like that start happening
[45:43] maybe God is about to move Hallelujah so
[45:46] Believers you must be sensitive amen if
[45:49] you want to bring God to the present we
[45:52] must be sensitive to the word amen we
[45:55] must do what it says we should do
[45:57] amen enough of giving excuses if we want
[46:01] to give excuses there'll be a lot of
[46:03] them to give but God is not in the
[46:05] business of giving excuses hallelujah
[46:09] amen and so when the situation was
[46:11] happening in the house Abraham told us
[46:13] that Abraham he just took his seat and
[46:16] went to sit under the tree you know to
[46:19] change the atmosphere because when God
[46:22] wants to perform Miracles the atmosphere
[46:24] has got to be right amen amen amen you
[46:27] know God cannot operate where doubt
[46:30] fears or Sorrows arise he cannot move in
[46:34] such atmosphere the atmosphere must be
[46:37] correct am Hallelujah am and so Abraham
[46:41] moved out and then sitting there those
[46:45] three men came the prophet told us that
[46:47] God just said we are going to visit my
[46:49] son and then so he blow up one body for
[46:54] this for that three bodies all of them
[46:56] step in and they showed up and when they
[46:59] showed up when Abraham saw them he did
[47:01] not say my Lord because he had
[47:05] Revelation if he is today he will be a
[47:08] believer of one God hallelujah he will
[47:11] believe that Jesus Christ I mean Jehovah
[47:13] of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of
[47:15] the new in sure I'm saying that will be
[47:17] in this church tonight if it's around
[47:19] this area because he believe only one
[47:22] God amen amen and he said my Lord coming
[47:27] and of course they came in and then he
[47:29] prepared gave them food did everything
[47:31] he had to do and God himself ate you
[47:35] know and after that he said where is
[47:39] Sarah your wife you know and then we
[47:42] didn't read that Abraham did any
[47:44] introduction Hallelujah yeah you know
[47:47] there was no Bible verse that told us
[47:49] that Abraham introduced members of his
[47:51] family to them but this man he knew
[47:54] Abraham's wife yes amen that's right
[47:57] hallelujah amen and so he said where is
[47:59] Sarah your wife and he told him in the
[48:03] tent behind you she's right there and he
[48:07] said well your wife will have a son you
[48:11] knowah told us about the visitation of
[48:14] the angel that do visit him he said you
[48:16] know he used to hear the voice since he
[48:18] was a little boy and so when that angel
[48:21] was in the room and then he saw a light
[48:25] and the light was getting brighter and
[48:26] bright there somebody came in from that
[48:28] light and then he was afraid he was what
[48:32] what is this am I seeing a vision is
[48:34] this a reality then the person said do
[48:37] not be afraid then he realized it's the
[48:40] same voice he has been hearing since he
[48:42] was a child Hallelujah so I have no
[48:45] doubt that when Elohim spoke Abraham was
[48:48] like oh this was the voice that called
[48:51] me
[48:53] yeah brethren we shall know him am you
[48:56] know when we get over there that will
[48:58] never be a stranger because God has
[49:01] interacted with you when you come in
[49:04] contact with him you will know him there
[49:06] is no doubt you I mean you will surely
[49:08] know him because something is already
[49:11] there that will make you remember him
[49:13] Hallelujah and so when he said Sarah
[49:16] shall have a child Bible told us that
[49:19] Sarah laughed within our that
[49:23] ah is this even possible I'm already an
[49:27] old woman 90 or 89 years old at that
[49:30] time and my husband already Works old
[49:34] there's no more desire everything and
[49:36] everything we are talking tonight about
[49:39] the God of all
[49:41] possibilities it does not matter what
[49:44] the situation is as long as go God plac
[49:47] that desire in your heart that it will
[49:49] be done Brethren it shall be done you
[49:52] are going to testify yes you just got to
[49:55] take God at his word yes that's a
[49:58] condition we saw tonight he said if a
[50:00] Believer takes God at his word then God
[50:04] will make the word come to pass amen
[50:06] that's right and so he gave that he said
[50:10] I will do it oh Sarah why did you li ah
[50:14] and she denied you know we know the
[50:16] story that because Sarah called God a
[50:20] liar God could have killed that yes
[50:23] because God is not a liar but God has
[50:27] included her in the
[50:30] promise and so without Sarah the promise
[50:33] cannot come to pass right Brethren God
[50:36] has concluded our Salvation in him
[50:39] without us we they are not complete amen
[50:43] is written in the book of Hebrew 11 that
[50:45] God having made something better for you
[50:48] and me such that all those Heroes of
[50:51] Faith without you and me they can never
[50:53] be complete so Brethren they are waiting
[50:56] for you they waiting for me they waiting
[50:58] for all of us hallelujah it is something
[51:02] God has done for
[51:04] youen amen and so Sarah without her the
[51:09] child cannot come even though God can
[51:12] produce somebody else but God made
[51:15] promise to Sarah and Abraham and God is
[51:19] not a liar not a man not a son of man he
[51:23] cannot lie he cannot even take his word
[51:26] back amen hallelujah even if the
[51:30] conditions are good for him to take it
[51:32] back he will not take it backen because
[51:35] he an infinite God Amen he can never
[51:39] make a mistake the prophet said God's
[51:42] first decision is always the right
[51:45] decision there is no plan
[51:48] B hallelujah amen so Brethren let's
[51:52] trust him yes so he told them that
[51:55] anyway Sarah you laughed and he asked
[51:59] them is anything too hard for God to do
[52:03] and tonight I'm asking you is anything
[52:05] too hard for God to do you might think
[52:08] your situation is different but Bren
[52:11] even in that different situation God is
[52:13] able to do it Hallelujah and my believe
[52:17] Genesis 21 God delivered that promise to
[52:21] them he delivered it because Sarah had a
[52:25] son yes and she said people will not
[52:27] laugh with me me 90 years carrying my
[52:31] first
[52:33] baby and today we can still celebrate
[52:35] them they are still present today that
[52:39] promise is still alive today you know we
[52:42] have read it and we are living in it
[52:45] Brethren if you think it's maybe some
[52:47] story made that was an experience I
[52:50] think I've shared it with BR one that
[52:54] was the time we went to Jerusalem
[52:57] so uh during our trip we had to cross to
[53:01] Jordan so and then there a border
[53:03] crossing you know you have to do all the
[53:05] passport and stuff so we have um some
[53:08] number of people among them from Nigeria
[53:12] we have a a pastor called Pastor
[53:15] Elijah he's darker than me in
[53:18] complexion but as soon as he go to that
[53:21] border crossing and then they ask for
[53:24] his passport and he give them passport
[53:28] they looked
[53:31] Elijah the people say Elijah T me you
[53:35] know Elijah Was Elijah the tach by they
[53:37] say Elijah
[53:38] TB I'm looking at a fully black man and
[53:41] you're calling Elijah te Hallelujah do
[53:44] you know what they did they took his
[53:47] passport his luggages they apologized to
[53:51] him forever delaying him and they took
[53:53] him across the crossing immediately
[53:56] without checks without they say it's
[53:58] Elijah the teach
[53:59] me and these are unbelievers so if you
[54:03] think that Bible story is not true
[54:05] Brethren you are joking they took it or
[54:08] they've taken it as
[54:10] life and they holding to those promises
[54:13] without fail and that's the way you
[54:15] should hold God's promises because God
[54:18] can never
[54:19] fail how can they see a black man from
[54:22] Nigeria and call him Elijah the teacher
[54:25] do you think they are making mistakes no
[54:27] they are still respecting that Elijah
[54:29] Prophet that's what they are still doing
[54:32] even though there there are people that
[54:34] will say they are just ordinary people
[54:36] but for them all God's promise is true
[54:40] amen nothing changes it Believers that's
[54:43] the way we should hold the word every
[54:46] promise we see in that Bible let's is a
[54:50] possibility hallelujah it's not just a
[54:54] writer it's not just a story no it's not
[54:57] just some good story it is what God
[54:59] promised to do in your life
[55:03] Hallelujah let's see that way and you
[55:06] know if out of all the millions of
[55:09] promises in this Bible God can lead your
[55:12] heart to believe one amen don't
[55:14] disappoint God because God wants to
[55:17] bring it to
[55:18] pass Hallelujah let's move
[55:21] on the time runs so
[55:24] fast I read them the unconditional
[55:27] Covenant that God made with the people
[55:30] paragraph 30 he say and Abraham being 75
[55:34] years old and Sarah 65 years old 40 50
[55:40] 60 25 years P
[55:43] menop lived with her since she was a
[55:46] young lady they were married and they
[55:50] were not F and God told Abraham that you
[55:53] are going to have a child by Sarah
[55:57] The
[55:58] Impossibles and Abraham believed God no
[56:01] matter how impossible it seemed he
[56:05] believed God and it was imputed unto him
[56:08] for
[56:09] righteousness he believed God Brethren
[56:13] he took God at his
[56:15] word say after all you promised
[56:19] me Brethren let's say God you told me
[56:23] this let God himself bring you to pass
[56:28] I read it I think in Isaiah when a king
[56:32] his name was s he sent one of his
[56:35] servant rapaki go and arest those
[56:39] Israelites you know tell them I have
[56:42] dealt with many kings oh yeah which is
[56:45] true he was the king of Assyria it was
[56:47] the reigning King there I said tell them
[56:52] Judah come to me
[56:54] now bow to me I will give you a new land
[56:57] he made all those
[56:59] promises but don't follow ezekiah don't
[57:02] believe his God because his God cannot
[57:05] save him when ezekiah even heard all
[57:09] those stories he was shaken they wrote
[57:11] him a letter I took the letter to the
[57:13] temple say God this letter even though
[57:16] my name is there but this letter is
[57:19] written to you come and
[57:22] intervene and then they call onto Isaiah
[57:25] the prophet this is what has happened
[57:27] the mother has come to Bath there is no
[57:30] strength to deliver this king is true
[57:34] that he has destroyed many
[57:36] things is not just making a a false
[57:39] claim come and help us and God sent elij
[57:44] Isaiah say okay I have read the letter
[57:49] of
[57:52] senero and I'm going to respond because
[57:55] he said I cannot
[57:57] deliver oh
[57:59] Hallelujah let's put God in our
[58:03] business he told and said because that
[58:06] King said I cannot deliver therefore he
[58:09] first of all said tell him I know him
[58:12] and I know his house and I will put my
[58:15] hook in his nose that's what that's that
[58:18] was God's response to him because he he
[58:21] said God cannot deliver and God said I
[58:23] will show him and then God told the
[58:26] Israelites or the Judah people you don't
[58:29] even have to fight it is between me and
[58:32] that guy Breen let your matter be
[58:36] between God and the
[58:38] enemy you be The
[58:40] Spectator stand on the word and watch
[58:44] and you will see the glory of God
[58:47] hallelujah this is what we should do
[58:50] when God cares for you you don't need to
[58:52] bother
[58:53] again he said that son he said what we
[58:57] we often have sorrows and pain because
[59:00] we fail to take our burdens to God In
[59:04] Prayer what a friend we have in
[59:07] Jesus Oh
[59:09] Hallelujah so it said you people you
[59:12] will not have any fight in this matter
[59:15] it is me and
[59:17] him and then said you just watch and
[59:20] what did God do Bible said by the next
[59:23] morning when they woke up 185 ,000
[59:26] people soldiers were dead when they woke
[59:29] up the ones that remain alive they saw
[59:32] that everybody was
[59:34] dead then what did the king do he
[59:37] ran Hallelujah he was challenging God he
[59:41] should have waited is it not but he ran
[59:45] and God said God has already said I know
[59:47] his
[59:47] house and I'm going to get him there and
[59:50] God went to his house took his two sons
[59:54] and they killed him
[59:56] Hallelujah that's the God will
[59:58] serve he the greatest General that never
[1:00:01] lost a battle he will not lose that b in
[1:00:04] your
[1:00:05] life Hallelujah the God of all
[1:00:09] possibilities that's the one we are
[1:00:10] serving
[1:00:12] tonight we moved again
[1:00:14] quickly in the sermon the seed is not
[1:00:18] here with the
[1:00:19] shock paragraph 76 said it had never
[1:00:22] been done in all ages
[1:00:26] but Mary believed God Amen Hallelujah
[1:00:29] yes we are not talking only about
[1:00:32] men all believers are included yes
[1:00:36] brother sister children adult everybody
[1:00:40] anyone who can take God at his word that
[1:00:44] promise will become a
[1:00:46] possibility she said behold the handmade
[1:00:50] of the Lord she believed the word how is
[1:00:54] she going to have it
[1:00:57] she knew that AGA had the baby by sex
[1:01:01] Desire with Abraham and Sarah had the
[1:01:05] baby by sex Desire with Abraham Children
[1:01:08] Of Promise the Bond woman and the free
[1:01:11] woman but here she is ask to believe our
[1:01:16] own case is
[1:01:18] different there is no man she remains a
[1:01:22] virgin there and yet Angel told her you
[1:01:26] are going to have a baby amen but what
[1:01:28] did she do Let It Be unto me according
[1:01:33] to your word
[1:01:36] hallelujah but here she is asked to
[1:01:40] believe that a cont that's a
[1:01:42] contribution to the faith that was in
[1:01:44] Abraham who believed in possibilities as
[1:01:48] long as God said it is so that makes it
[1:01:52] right am Hallelujah she didn't know what
[1:01:57] will happen how it's going to happen it
[1:02:00] has never happened before but it was
[1:02:02] written Isaiah 96 a virgin shall
[1:02:05] conceive amen you know people believe
[1:02:08] that she's a virgin you know when she
[1:02:11] goes into a husband's house you know
[1:02:13] that's the only thing that is logical
[1:02:16] you know nobody can imagine that I mean
[1:02:19] so they must have prepared all of them
[1:02:21] please my daughter be a virin do this
[1:02:24] get to your husband now say virgin maybe
[1:02:27] God can use you nobody had the
[1:02:30] premonition that the person will it is
[1:02:33] only the child that will dis her they
[1:02:36] did not have that idea they all just
[1:02:39] prepare but God has millions of ways of
[1:02:42] solving the single problem beyond our
[1:02:45] widest
[1:02:47] imagination Hallelujah but what did Mary
[1:02:52] do preach Aon Mary's Bel that's you know
[1:02:57] the under the same condition the same
[1:02:59] environment there was a
[1:03:01] priest right Zachariah I believe his
[1:03:04] name was angel came to him while he was
[1:03:07] in the temple doing the word of God your
[1:03:11] position does not
[1:03:13] matter why Jesus was on ground Pharisees
[1:03:17] they didn't believe him but the woman at
[1:03:20] the well a kind of AME woman she
[1:03:23] believed Hallelujah that no
[1:03:27] barrier you know and then Zariah he said
[1:03:31] what how can it be and Gabriel was
[1:03:35] shocked how can I tell you I introduced
[1:03:38] myself I'm Angel Gabriel I came from the
[1:03:42] presence of God and I told you what God
[1:03:44] Said and you have the audacity to
[1:03:47] disbelieve you know it surprised the
[1:03:49] angel because disbelief is not in their
[1:03:52] business yes and they has to say man for
[1:03:55] you to know you be remain dumb but here
[1:03:58] is Mary we don't even know our linage
[1:04:01] whether she was of the priesthood or not
[1:04:04] or maybe a levite we don't know but she
[1:04:07] told Gabriel Let It Be unto me according
[1:04:10] to your word Bren you tell God that
[1:04:13] tonight because God will bring his word
[1:04:16] to pass let's move
[1:04:19] forward hallelujah praise Lord I'm still
[1:04:22] reading
[1:04:24] testimony paragraph 27 it says sometimes
[1:04:28] God makes us do things that seems very
[1:04:33] dangerous and out of
[1:04:36] line how about Moses with that
[1:04:40] stick going down to take over Egypt and
[1:04:45] everything we find like that that God
[1:04:48] asked The
[1:04:49] Impossibles are we together see so that
[1:04:53] he does The Impossibles too that man
[1:04:57] will know that it is in it isn't him it
[1:05:01] is God doing it right when God say go
[1:05:04] and do something imposs look at Moses
[1:05:07] when Moses was 40 year old General he
[1:05:10] tried to do this thing he succeeded in
[1:05:13] killing only one Egyptian and upon it he
[1:05:17] ran are we
[1:05:19] together he ran he became a personal
[1:05:24] nonat in Egypt
[1:05:26] because it must not show his space
[1:05:29] because of killing one Egyptian and yet
[1:05:31] it was a military
[1:05:33] strategist and it was energetic 40 year
[1:05:36] old no problem but yet it was impossible
[1:05:40] but when it became 8 year old he has
[1:05:43] forgotten about military tactics he was
[1:05:46] now a shepherd with a Crooked Stick God
[1:05:50] said go and take over
[1:05:53] hallelujah amen our God he has us to do
[1:05:56] the impossible so that we can experience
[1:05:59] The
[1:06:00] Impossible when he says oh this nobody
[1:06:04] has done it before but it's in your mind
[1:06:06] to do it oh it's an impossibility God
[1:06:10] said believe it am because you are about
[1:06:13] to experience an impossibility in your
[1:06:15] life we are serving the God of all
[1:06:19] possibilities and did Moses achieved it
[1:06:22] or not he
[1:06:24] did he went with that Crooked Stick and
[1:06:27] went straight to Egypt and they couldn't
[1:06:30] even say why you not that person that
[1:06:33] ran away nobody there say that because
[1:06:36] he is now on God's Mission yes amen
[1:06:39] hallelujah when you are on God's Mission
[1:06:42] the enemy has got to Bow I'm not saying
[1:06:45] they will not try but they must fail
[1:06:48] amen that's right Hallelujah and then he
[1:06:51] got there he met James and jambers he
[1:06:55] defeated
[1:06:56] even though God did not tell him those
[1:06:58] people are going to show up but he
[1:07:01] remain calm you know be still and see
[1:07:05] the glory of God that's instruction when
[1:07:08] you have prayed you have put it before
[1:07:11] God there's no need to
[1:07:13] worry you know there's no need to do
[1:07:15] that just wait on him amen because he's
[1:07:19] always keeping all his appointments amen
[1:07:23] and he took those people with all those
[1:07:25] Miracles and sign out of that bondage
[1:07:28] into the promised land you know go what
[1:07:31] God commission Moses to do was to bring
[1:07:34] them and bring them onto the mountain
[1:07:37] and he did that he took them to to
[1:07:40] Worship the Lord despite all the other
[1:07:43] challenges let's move forward amen we
[1:07:46] are serving the God of all possibilities
[1:07:49] am
[1:07:50] now I wrote here in the Book of Esther
[1:07:54] just a little extract of what happened
[1:07:57] to modai we are talking about the God of
[1:08:00] all
[1:08:01] possibilities you know modai Bible told
[1:08:04] us it was of the Kindred of the Jews a
[1:08:07] slave so so to speak and then he raised
[1:08:12] a daughter an orphan Esther you know
[1:08:15] whose parent have died and then after
[1:08:19] what queen Vash did the Bible told us
[1:08:22] that Queen Vash was like the
[1:08:24] denomination when God called them they
[1:08:26] refuse they prefer their makeup and
[1:08:29] paints and all the other things to the
[1:08:31] word of
[1:08:32] God and God don't have time for that and
[1:08:35] so the king put her away that's B and
[1:08:39] then there was a program to get a new
[1:08:42] Queen for the King and then we are told
[1:08:45] that Esther she did not ask for anything
[1:08:49] extra only what a I believe the
[1:08:52] chamberling gave to
[1:08:54] her because because she believe that
[1:08:56] that chamberling understand the king
[1:08:59] better today we have another
[1:09:02] chamberling that was sent to get a bride
[1:09:05] for Christ we must stick to what he
[1:09:08] says hallelujah because he was
[1:09:12] commission that's right amen amen and so
[1:09:16] she obeyed everything and when the time
[1:09:18] of her appearance came she got the
[1:09:21] golden scepter she became the queen but
[1:09:25] the he wasn't happy whenever you make a
[1:09:28] progress expect
[1:09:30] opposition but God told you Victory is
[1:09:33] certain don't say oh because of
[1:09:35] opposition you will not make progress
[1:09:37] you must make progress opposition they
[1:09:40] are bound to arise but we will defeat
[1:09:43] them Hallelujah and as we defeat them we
[1:09:46] make more progress even in physical St
[1:09:50] they told us that the reward of success
[1:09:52] is more work amen you know when you make
[1:09:55] one success whatever takes you to that
[1:09:58] level cannot keep you there you've got
[1:10:01] to gain more strength to move forward
[1:10:03] and it is those trials that will
[1:10:05] strengthen you they prepare you for the
[1:10:08] higher Journey amen and so something
[1:10:12] happened there was a prime minister that
[1:10:15] was loved by the king you know whatever
[1:10:19] it was you always remember that the
[1:10:22] circle of Revival or the law of contrast
[1:10:25] once you see Good The Bad is following
[1:10:29] the moment you see Jesus that is a Judas
[1:10:32] you know is always like that they always
[1:10:35] in the wing you know ready to strike but
[1:10:38] you see their portion is always of
[1:10:40] defeat Hallelujah that's right check all
[1:10:43] through they are not bound to
[1:10:46] arrive and so that Aman he was beloved
[1:10:50] of the king and he was growing in rank
[1:10:54] until he became the second in
[1:10:57] command and then there was this lonely
[1:10:59] modai serving his God hallelujah amen
[1:11:04] you know it was always at the T at the
[1:11:07] gate checking watching out doing what he
[1:11:11] had to do just to help you because his
[1:11:14] daughter is in that Palace you know just
[1:11:17] trying to check for her and then Bible
[1:11:19] told us that one time some people tried
[1:11:21] to kill the king you heard about it he
[1:11:24] notified the King in his own name you
[1:11:27] know it was written down no problem you
[1:11:30] know the prophet told us sometimes that
[1:11:32] you may do something and you not get
[1:11:34] credit for it don't be angry oh don't
[1:11:38] say Pastor did not see me as long as God
[1:11:41] sees you when the time is right he will
[1:11:45] make the pastor to see
[1:11:47] you imagine if they had uh honored
[1:11:52] modai of course God will always have his
[1:11:54] way but God have an appointed
[1:11:58] time amen let's trust him yes don't say
[1:12:03] oh because they didn't recognize my work
[1:12:05] I will not do it again that is a lack of
[1:12:08] Revelation if you know who you are doing
[1:12:10] it for you will keep doing it because
[1:12:14] you know when he's ready to bless nobody
[1:12:16] can stop him
[1:12:17] yes praise the Lord
[1:12:20] hallelujah and
[1:12:23] so amen as he does when he's coming from
[1:12:27] King's meeting we pass through the gate
[1:12:29] and he always notice that this mod
[1:12:33] somebody is not always bowing down for
[1:12:36] me and then he made inquiries who was
[1:12:39] that guy they say oh he a mody of the
[1:12:41] Jews the slave a slave you know he felt
[1:12:45] like oh my God ordinary slave and the
[1:12:49] Bible said he felt that Modi was too
[1:12:53] little for him to deal with
[1:12:55] yes so do you know what he did he wanted
[1:12:58] to destroy entire
[1:13:00] Jews putting God again on the earth seat
[1:13:04] yes because God has promised to restore
[1:13:07] them amen after they have gone for 70
[1:13:09] years God said we bring them back that's
[1:13:11] right now somebody wants to cross the
[1:13:13] line of the
[1:13:14] prophecy I don't know what God has
[1:13:16] promised you if the dev try to cross
[1:13:20] that line he will have to meet with God
[1:13:23] hallelujah because God will fulfill his
[1:13:27] promise so he tried to cross that line
[1:13:31] oh do you know what he did he got some
[1:13:34] big money that will impress the king and
[1:13:37] pay it into the king
[1:13:39] treasury you know oh have people do
[1:13:41] things something that will not benefit
[1:13:44] you you are even losing money you know
[1:13:48] when devil is at work you will know he
[1:13:49] the devil because hatred is in
[1:13:53] him you know you see to lose money you
[1:13:56] want to kill I mean I don't know I try
[1:13:58] to imagine it you are losing your money
[1:14:01] to kill people and he went to the king
[1:14:04] one morning and after he had made all
[1:14:07] the arrangement paid the money drafted a
[1:14:10] a kind of law you know he went to the
[1:14:13] king early morning he wanted to do that
[1:14:16] you know but while he was trying to do
[1:14:19] that that's also the god of
[1:14:21] modai who has everything already planned
[1:14:24] out
[1:14:26] Hallelujah you know sometimes you think
[1:14:28] he doesn't care about you oh your
[1:14:30] situation does he's seeing everything he
[1:14:33] has the appointed time for
[1:14:35] you God has already gone to the
[1:14:39] king he made the king that same
[1:14:41] overnight he made the king he took away
[1:14:44] the king sleep you know you can imagine
[1:14:46] the bed of the king must be so luxurious
[1:14:49] everything yet God took the sleep away
[1:14:52] and he couldn't sleep and he was
[1:14:55] counting the squares of the ceiling
[1:14:57] everything he can do and God must have
[1:14:59] told him that's not why you awake go to
[1:15:02] your library he got to the library he
[1:15:05] was looking what am I looking for God
[1:15:08] say you are looking for the book
[1:15:10] containing the record of the exploit of
[1:15:13] people in this Kingdom he took the book
[1:15:16] he began go said no go to page modai
[1:15:19] there's no I mean everything is timed
[1:15:23] Hallelujah so it go to
[1:15:25] page that contains Mod's activity and he
[1:15:28] saw
[1:15:30] mod certifi the king B and attempted
[1:15:34] assassination it was found to be true
[1:15:37] and the people were executed and the
[1:15:39] King's life was
[1:15:41] saved Hallelujah and he said
[1:15:45] he you people what have you done to that
[1:15:48] guy everybody look you know in the
[1:15:51] meeting we have done nothing you did
[1:15:54] nothing
[1:15:55] somebody that's protected My Life The
[1:15:58] King was still thinking while he was
[1:16:00] thinking somebody was at the
[1:16:02] court he said who was there they said am
[1:16:06] man oh good good that's the right person
[1:16:09] it's my right hand man he should know
[1:16:12] the right thing to do so they call in a
[1:16:15] man come what a man came to do was
[1:16:18] actually to get approval to execute
[1:16:23] modai brand you can you can go and read
[1:16:25] the book of Esther he came that early
[1:16:28] morning because he wanted modai done
[1:16:31] before
[1:16:32] noon so it came early morning to get
[1:16:35] that authorization to get him off then
[1:16:38] later he will deal with his people but
[1:16:40] God was already waiting Ameren God is
[1:16:43] waiting on your
[1:16:45] matter this is not the time to lose
[1:16:48] faith in a sermon beser of God the
[1:16:52] prophet said when you have done
[1:16:54] everything you should do and everything
[1:16:57] seems to be out of order he said that is
[1:17:00] when you should stand
[1:17:01] still because God is just waiting to see
[1:17:05] your faith am because God has sort
[1:17:08] everything out already you know it's not
[1:17:10] that God is just doing something now he
[1:17:13] has prean
[1:17:14] everything just waiting for things to
[1:17:17] fall in place at their time that's right
[1:17:20] is that perfect right Glory if you doubt
[1:17:24] go and read about your body system check
[1:17:28] how it
[1:17:30] works you know from your DNA coding
[1:17:34] everything written there and they

[1:21:51] right Hallelujah you know Bible said God
[1:21:55] he will make war with the amorites from
[1:21:58] generation to generation until they are

[1:22:03] his children with food and drink but
[1:22:05] rather with cutlers and whatever and God

[1:24:25] he explained to them see what happened
[1:24:28] to me do you know what the wife told him
[1:24:31] yeah he said if Modi was of the stock of
[1:24:34] the Jews and you have began to fall
[1:24:37] before him he said you will follow you
[1:24:40] will not rise again the wife told him
[1:24:42] that I said why can't this boy was too
[1:24:45] late you know God was already on the
[1:24:47] move before they could finish that
[1:24:50] discussion Messengers from the King came
[1:24:52] to take him back to the banquet oh you
[1:24:55] know earlier he yesterday he was
[1:24:58] rejoicing I was the only one invited by
[1:25:02] you know to no other person just a
[1:25:05] banquet for king and the Prime Minister
[1:25:07] plus the queen you know
[1:25:10] exclusive oh my Hallelujah Exquisite you
[1:25:13] know those kind of grammar and then the
[1:25:15] next day it was already called that
[1:25:18] previous day the king got s Queen what
[1:25:21] do you
[1:25:22] need queena said
[1:25:24] nothing I just want to have another
[1:25:27] banquet with you and prime minister
[1:25:30] tomorrow and the King was I mean we'll
[1:25:33] be there you know so the tomorrow came
[1:25:37] after he has done what he did and they
[1:25:38] brought him and so after the meal in the
[1:25:41] evening the king asked again Queen
[1:25:44] Esther what do you want and it shall be
[1:25:47] granted to you to the half of the
[1:25:49] kingdom and queen said I don't even want
[1:25:52] much I just need my life can you imagine
[1:25:57] a whole Queen begging for her life in
[1:25:59] front of the king and the King was
[1:26:02] shocked who would like to kill my
[1:26:06] queen and then she pointed he say is
[1:26:09] this wicked am man
[1:26:12] ah and the King stood up from the market
[1:26:15] he was you know enraged that cannot be
[1:26:17] promoting this guy and then he wants to
[1:26:20] ruin my
[1:26:21] family and he went Bible say went into
[1:26:24] the garden while he was there God that
[1:26:27] has planned everything Brethren God is
[1:26:31] the God of all
[1:26:33] possibility amen am man was trying to
[1:26:36] beg quen on the
[1:26:39] bed you know he was just doing
[1:26:42] everything
[1:26:43] wrongly and then the king came back and
[1:26:45] said what is he trying to force the
[1:26:48] queen in the palace before the king
[1:26:52] could finish that statement Bible said
[1:26:54] they cover his face you know the way
[1:26:56] they do execution you know they have to
[1:26:58] cover the face and then because that
[1:27:01] time they must not allow the king to get
[1:27:03] too
[1:27:04] angry if the anger becomes so much
[1:27:06] things can happen and then somebody said
[1:27:10] there oh he has built a gallo and it's
[1:27:14] for mod they said go and hang him
[1:27:17] there you see once a plan for a child of
[1:27:21] God became his portion amen
[1:27:25] Hallelujah without Mod's intervention he
[1:27:28] did not even know all he did was they
[1:27:31] praying the pray so that nothing will
[1:27:33] happen they join in prayer and fasting
[1:27:35] that's all but all that God now did he
[1:27:39] did not
[1:27:40] know and then he was executed we are
[1:27:43] talking about the God of all
[1:27:45] possibilities look at you know the the
[1:27:49] Gap who modai was a slave to a prime
[1:27:53] minister
[1:27:54] until he felt that killing only Modi was
[1:27:57] too little and he had to kill the entire
[1:28:00] race and yet God brought him down yes I
[1:28:04] don't know what that problem you think
[1:28:06] you have how giant it is but I believe I
[1:28:10] God is taller than that I believe our
[1:28:13] God is greater than that and he still in
[1:28:15] the work of solving problems Hallelujah
[1:28:20] right that time is up you know look at
[1:28:23] um Jacob and Esau you know just a
[1:28:27] snipper from that one time God we know
[1:28:30] the promises God made to Jacob when he
[1:28:33] took the B right he ran over there and
[1:28:36] then he had um his trouble on the way
[1:28:39] after while God prospered him despite
[1:28:42] the trouble that lean gave to him you
[1:28:44] know changing the wages doing all the
[1:28:46] tricks and everything you know he now
[1:28:48] decided to return and he started
[1:28:51] returning as God called him but he got a
[1:28:54] message
[1:28:56] Brethren and what was the message his
[1:28:59] brother Esau was coming with 400
[1:29:03] men I don't think we are talking about
[1:29:06] the God of all
[1:29:08] possibilities Esau was coming with he's
[1:29:11] not coming alone because he did not know
[1:29:14] how big Jacob has become but he was more
[1:29:17] than prepar 400 men because he has said
[1:29:20] that he's going to show this guy he has
[1:29:23] r him of his b right and also the
[1:29:28] blessing he wasn't telling the
[1:29:31] truth you know he sold that b right amen
[1:29:34] and he did not deserve the blessing
[1:29:36] right Bible said he make an only thing
[1:29:42] nonsense you know that's what he did you
[1:29:45] know he did not value that b right and
[1:29:49] Bible in the New Testament compared Esau
[1:29:52] with fornicators
[1:29:55] you know people don't value that their
[1:29:57] body is the temple of God he just throw
[1:30:00] it around you know because it's
[1:30:02] something God made he wanted to dwell in
[1:30:05] that Temple but you thr it around for
[1:30:07] every D Canary and Bible compare them
[1:30:10] with Esau he did not know the value of
[1:30:13] the B right now he wanted to fight for
[1:30:16] it that is always a God In the Mix
[1:30:20] Hallelujah but you see we got to take
[1:30:22] God at his word
[1:30:24] and that's the side we are always
[1:30:26] lacking not that God is unable to do his
[1:30:29] work but are we prepared are we in in
[1:30:34] Readiness may the Lord help us and so
[1:30:38] when the news got to Jacob that your
[1:30:41] brother is on the way he knew
[1:30:46] that all the tricks in this word they
[1:30:49] can't work he still triy them Bible say
[1:30:52] he divided all the things he had in
[1:30:55] droves you know he this a set imagine
[1:30:59] you know if this guy can fall for just a
[1:31:02] plate of porridge if I give him a number
[1:31:05] of sheep and goat and RAM he should fall
[1:31:08] but soon you realize it's not going to
[1:31:10] work too but he sent it anyway Bible
[1:31:12] said later when he had sent his wife and
[1:31:15] children for that he himself stayed he
[1:31:18] realized look this is more than food and
[1:31:21] drink we got to because now now if it's
[1:31:24] only him he may still try to place my
[1:31:27] you know but now wife children
[1:31:29] everything no no no no no and Bible say
[1:31:32] stay back and a man wrestle with him yes
[1:31:36] you know Bible said and the wrestling
[1:31:38] was probably from the night till almost
[1:31:40] the day break and the man wrestling with
[1:31:44] him was say this man let me go said no I
[1:31:48] will not let you go Jacob was desperate
[1:31:53] amen you know the prophet said when we
[1:31:55] are thirsty or desperate enough whatever
[1:31:58] we have we ask we will get of time we
[1:32:02] just Pastor say let's pray you pray you
[1:32:05] know let's pray once in a while if you
[1:32:08] are desperate you know you ask what to
[1:32:10] pray for when Jacob he realized if this
[1:32:14] man goes I'm dead say you are not going
[1:32:18] unless you bless me and the man asking
[1:32:21] what is your name he said I am Jacob the
[1:32:24] prophet said he made open confession
[1:32:26] Jacob means
[1:32:28] suppan say this is who I
[1:32:30] am and the man told him you'll no longer
[1:32:34] be that now I've changed your name amen
[1:32:38] you are now Israel amen you are now a
[1:32:40] prince with God and Men you have
[1:32:42] wrestled with God and you have even
[1:32:44] prevailed and Bible say touched him at
[1:32:47] the H of his time and he started limping
[1:32:51] no that's people they don't want to
[1:32:52] receive the Holy Ghost because they
[1:32:54] don't want to F the spiritual pool so
[1:32:57] that people not laugh at them you are
[1:32:58] not ready if with God and the same when
[1:33:03] God touch your life you can't be the
[1:33:05] same person people will see they say are
[1:33:07] you now Sister yes I am are you a pastor
[1:33:11] they will call you Pastor true when you
[1:33:14] are walking on the road there's nothing
[1:33:16] you are not putting any um what's it
[1:33:18] called toga or some Mark they say Pastor
[1:33:21] why are you you know it happened to me
[1:33:23] inos
[1:33:24] know I was driving coming home from work
[1:33:26] so we got to an
[1:33:28] intersection in my mind I said I'm not
[1:33:31] going to stop for anybody because I got
[1:33:33] there first that's what I said it in my
[1:33:36] mind when we go there another vehicle
[1:33:38] was
[1:33:39] coming and I do not not wind down you a
[1:33:44] pastor what and I've never seen him in
[1:33:47] my life I don't know him I look at the
[1:33:49] vehicle number he say you a pastor you

[1:34:00] you may not know it but they see it
[1:34:04] hallelujah
[1:34:07] hallelujah and so that angel touched him
[1:34:10] by the time and then when he got by the
[1:34:13] time the sun rose on on he was
[1:34:15] limping and the children were like what
[1:34:18] happened to Daddy he said things are
[1:34:21] different now Hallelujah I'm not the man

[1:34:53] like the face ofel let me it was just
[1:34:56] appealing and appealing I know that is
[1:34:58] what go that's the way God wanted to
[1:34:59] solve the problem no blood shed God just
[1:35:03] changed the mind he offered to escort

[1:35:36] duty to tell God how the problem should
[1:35:38] be solved sometimes you try to do that
[1:35:41] you know you figure out the ways all you

[1:40:01] of months back I want to preach for the
[1:40:05] brother and his baby was a white his his
[1:40:08] daughter she had travel
[1:40:12] overseas so he he loded me in her
[1:40:16] [Music]
[1:40:21] room and then she had a a little note on
[1:40:24] her on her table some a note she
[1:40:27] stick like a writing to the Lord she was
[1:40:31] asking the Lord I think her husband was
[1:40:34] overseas so she wrote on the
[1:40:39] wall I can I can rightly remember or
[1:40:42] maybe before my next birthday or
[1:40:44] something like
[1:40:46] that so before I
[1:40:49] left I took a a little note and I wrote
[1:40:54] I wrote her the
[1:40:55] note that I saw your note I saw your
[1:40:58] letter to
[1:41:01] God I saw what you wrote The
[1:41:07] Lord thank you for allowing me
[1:41:10] to to use your room in your
[1:41:14] absent but remember the story of the
[1:41:17] shite
[1:41:18] woman I just wrote a little note and I
[1:41:21] left it on her table
[1:41:23] and why brother famy was uh speaking
[1:41:25] tonight I thought about that how many
[1:41:28] times we have a letter from the
[1:41:33] doctor how many times we have a
[1:41:36] letter something was written to you
[1:41:40] something was given to
[1:41:44] you what we try to do we try to read
[1:41:49] it but we have to realize that God can
[1:41:52] read
[1:41:53] amen God can break those
[1:41:57] letters those spelling he can break it
[1:42:03] apart he can read the doctor's
[1:42:08] diagnosis he can even read your bill
[1:42:11] that is
[1:42:13] [Music]
[1:42:15] deal he can read a letter whatever
[1:42:18] letter it
[1:42:21] is it said an immigration
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:28] letter the prophet of God not knowing
[1:42:30] how to
[1:42:32] pray he said I wrote God a letter and I
[1:42:36] stick it on the tree I said dear God
[1:42:39] maybe you will come by and you will read
[1:42:41] my
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:42:45] letter
[1:42:48] sometimes we need to give it to God
[1:42:50] instead of figuring out
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:42:58] Hezekiah knew there's not much he could
[1:43:00] do he just took the letter and he laid
[1:43:03] it before the altar he said God you can
[1:43:06] read AB you are the one that gave men
[1:43:09] intelligence this is what has been
[1:43:12] written this is what this king of Syra
[1:43:15] has
[1:43:19] written and God read it God God read
[1:43:23] every
[1:43:27] line and God responded to
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:34] it because he's the god of possibilities
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:46] amen sometimes write those
[1:43:50] things write write it right from your
[1:43:52] heart
[1:43:55] write it away your mind think about it
