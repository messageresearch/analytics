praise the Lord shall we go to the Lord in prayer our Lord and our Savior Jesus wait thank you so very much for this morning we are so very much grateful dear Lord Jesus for what you've done in our life that before you laid the foundation stone of this earth you knew us we are no strangers to you we belong to you and to you we shall go that right from the cradle all through this life to the grave and beyond if Christ Harry's grace has written our lives we are so very much grateful Lord for what your grace has done in our life we all you dear Lord Jesus everything there is in this life and in the life to come for by grace are we saved not of works lest any man should boast we are so grateful Lord for being the author and the finisher of our faith and we thank you for having read us together this morning and we are so grateful Lord for giving us life and giving us life more abundantly we praise the Lord Jesus for everything you've done for us we worship the Lord we bless thee and we uplift and glorified in holding him this morning father we have just gathered once again to go through the adult Sunday School today happens to be probably I think the last day just going to run up what we've started probably eight nine months ago just trusting in your grace father and in your divine leadership - ladies topic to rest this morning come and honor yourself Lord we praise thee father once again and we bless thee in Jesus name Amen god bless you since you welcome sister good yes so I had a very rough week I didn't know I could even make it in this morning as I was telling some writers yesterday on Thursday between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. I went to the bathroom 12 times and my my the previous night I took my wait before coming to church that was Sunday night and it was 2 or 4.9 for no reason but after the 12th time on Thursday for a very good reason I said no let me go on the scale again and when I took my way to drop to one 99.7 in eight hours I lost I think 5.2 pounds yeah thank God my wife gave me some medicine to stop it but I've been very weak tango we've been able to make it praise be to God yes so I'm just trying to bring this topic to an end we've been looking at the topic prayer for I think it's nine months I'm not very sure it's been a while and as I was thinking of you know just summing it up I was wondering a topic we've treated for so long what is the conclusion started going to be like I couldn't just find a place so I'm just trusting that a few minutes was spent before the Lord you know what we just help us in any way it pleases him praise be to God so we're going to look at let's turn our Bibles to John 15:7 John 15:7 I read if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you praise be to God so we have looked at a lot of things concerning prayer so very much and it was just a burden on my heart to teach this it was not because I knew better than anybody but I just had that burden and I have had some personal testimonies here and there about how much it has been a blessing to some of us and personally it's been a blessing to me because I have had to read and to do a few research here and there you know full of Scripture here and there it's been wonderful to say the least and I have enjoyed every moment of it it's changed my prayer life and you know I'll probably get there I don't want to lose my line of thought the Muslims pray five times a day they will get up at dawn pray in the afternoon pray at 3 o clock five and seven five times a day for them is aware of life I don't care what they are going through they would make sure that they pray five times I don't care how sick he is he never gives an excuse he would make sure he prays five times a day I don't care how poor and wretched he is he would pray five times a day I don't care what a huge down or up he will pray five times a day and it's interesting apart from having been a Muslim myself I have lived in that community and sometimes you take a vehicle you are in a transport that driver is going and all of a sudden their driver stops he doesn't even tell anybody anything and then people are asking is anything is everything all right is everything all right and then you hear somebody say oh the driver wants to pray he will stop the car stop everybody get out of the car and then he'll perform his ablution and right beside the road he'll be praying he's not ashamed of it I don't care what it is you would have to sit in the bus and wait till he is done and yes imagine if he's going to drive you for 24 hours just be ready five times during the journey in that day he is going to stop the car and you have no complaint pray five times a day that is what they do for them is the will of life I remember in northern Ghana one time the Orthodox Muslims and the fundamentals had a problem they were fighting that didn't stop them from still going to their God and pray five times a day they would worry along down and under it there is a long life and when he goes down he says allah wahda when you look on the day you will see a very long knife to egg Assad his brain and he's ready to cut off people's head they don't care what you are going through they don't joke with the appraised think of the children of Israel Daniel in in Babylon the Bible said he prayed three times a day so when even the King issued a decree that nobody should make any petition to his God Daniel still open his windows towards Jerusalem and he prayed three times a day it was aware of life not even the Kings decree could stop him and until prayer becomes a way of life until prayer becomes a way of life you are not going anywhere yet you don't pray only when you feel like it you know prayer only when things are good you don't pray only when you feel well you don't pray only when you have some big bonus no prayer should be aware of life prayer ought to be an integral part of your Christian life when your prayer life is under attack your Christian life is under attack if the devil can get you to sucked in your prayer life if the devil can give you a reason why you shouldn't pray then guess what very soon your Christian experience will come crumbling down never never never joke with your praise praise be to God for a Christian the Bible says would you pray without ceasing there is no special time for prayer and as I said before every prayer time is a special time I don't care what the of the morning what time in the afternoon what time in the evening and you know what that times that you don't just feel like praying that you feel so down and out you feel so sick nobody cares about me nobody calls me nobody loves me and you are down I am sick that is the time that your prayer sounds rings so loud in the presence of God those moments you don't feel like praying at all wonderful I just told you guys this topic has helped my prayer life on well on Friday night I was so down and out feeling very sick normally I would when dropped my wife at work pick up in the morning that morning I didn't pick her up I asked her to type uber and in the night I was supposed to carry her I said you know what can I just go Oba excuse me and she said I don't have much time I may be late I woke up under that condition to tell you the truth I will just lie in bed and then say a few words I took her to wake came back I was so heavy in my body I said you know what let me just I have a special corner where I pray I went out on my knees and it was one of the best moments in my life praise be to God I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and I could feel a presence on my right side it was not an imagination normally when I'm prey and the trainer sleeping and I hear my voice they will come down and then come and kneel beside me and we operate I felt a presence and I knew they were sleeping it was a wonderful moment no Wes could ever describe it in those moments when you don't just feel like it where you feel very heavy something says you know what just light and pray you know just if you can just drag your caucus get on your knees and cry out to God is going to give you a different experience praise be to God remember that every prayer time is a special time praise be to God now as I said I guess didn't know where to start from because we have said a lot and I'm just concluding this whole story and when I say I am just concluding it it's not just to say that oh we have concluded on prayer no it's just a discussion we are bringing to a conclusion where there is no way we can ever come bring a conclusion to prayer so long as we live in this life till the coming of Christ prayer ought to be something you should just love to do it love to be in the presence of God there is nothing that can compare to it it's just a joy I mean praise be to God so you know what we are just ending the topic but then you should pray more often the Bible says without vision the people perish have a revelation into what you are doing there isn't why sometimes we just do taste anyhow is because we look revelation of what we are doing take your prayer life to the next level and don't just pray as I said before most of the times oh it's just me if it's not me that it is we I'm so part of it if it's not we that is us I'm so part of it when does it become he/she them they don't be selfish in your prayer life praise be to God I remember one another before the Lord bear one another before the Lord carry one another before the Lord standing for one another sometimes I just have a baby for somebody without any reason I just have a burden and I'll go before the Lord that happens then when you have a bed in it's a different in all together sometimes there's no pattern but try to carry one another before the Lord don't wait til something bad happens it's part of the human nature sometimes we just sit and wait till something goes wrong that is not a good thing to do I remember one time I had a dream a sister was standing beside me on my left side and we lost hands like this like a father was walking her Dora to give her out to Mary for marriage ceremony and then I saw she moved fast forward then I groped her back and I right away she just give up in my arms oh it was it was just so real I just started crying and I started shouting as no I will not take this I will not accept this I refuse it Sarah Prynne and I realized it was it was a dream I told my wife we call the sister ceased are you okay she said yeah I'm fine you know it's not everything you tell people and then we've got to be down to business we didn't know what was going to happen but we prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed that week we do not have to wait until such things happen just make it a part of your prayer life let it be a joy to just bet someone in prayer to bet a family in prayer to I mean as much as God gives you grace praise be to God do not be selfish because we can be very very self-centered and that is not good for us and it is not also good for anybody now there are a lot of things that would hinder our prayers you can pray from morning to evening and so have you Priya ended and these are things we should watch out the items we've talked about I'm not going to go just kind of run over a few things and then oh just pray now watch pride the Bible says pride goes before a fall and sometimes you can be proud without even knowing you're proud I attended a seminar I didn't know a heart fear because I don't feel anything I attended a seminar and the expert came and said what she feared was any time she was live in the house she would double check yes afraid that the house was going to be on flames then I said oh is this one to fear she said yes it is fear I saw oh but I also do that anytime I'm leaving the house i watch and I make sure everything is off I didn't know it was fear but I don't fear it's not part of me so right exists in many forms and it's a good thing when you are proud and you know you are proud the bad side to it is when you don't do it watch pride it can hinder your life it can hinder your spiritual growth it can hinder your prayer praise be to God anger the first stage of madness they say is anger when you see somebody angry and you see them displaying there is no difference between that person and a madman the only difference is that maybe one looks a little clean and the other looks a little dirty but you know that this is somebody that is out of his mind anger raw anger can be a hindrance our forgiving spirit sometimes we don't forgive we only sweep the problem under the carpet and we think we have forgiven it goes back it goes and I come back to haunt us we have talked about this and I know we spent a lot of time on this unforgiving spirit can hinder you in a lot of ways it can hinder your praise it can hinder your deliverance it can hinder your healing it can hinder your walk with God when you don't learn to forgive and there is no limits my Peter is the Lord Jesus Christ how many times should I forgive my neighbor when they sin against me seventy times seven you have time to count then you have a lot of work to do I liked it when one preacher said that life is short that it is okay to get angry it's okay to keep grudge but do not let the Sun set on it then when you are angry just look at a time when it's 559 let go of it I don't know why he was when he was talking about this probably he was somewhere along the equator where you have 12 days of sunlight and 12 days of darkness but if it is in winter here we know we have longer nights and we have shorter days you have less time to keep that anger and if it's the other way around maybe in summer you have a long time to keep it but for how long and you are saying is the reason why some people are getting too old older than the idea idea age some people I got you are necessarily too sick some people are bottled up why because you are keeping too much in you life is short as it comes so let it go what has your neighbor done to you that is so much that you cannot forgive which you have now you have not done it to Christ if you have experienced forgiveness what makes it difficult for you to forgive your neighbour if you can hold your neighbour sense against them it shows the experience you have praise be to God these are tens to watch these are things that can hinder your prayer life just watch us sin we are running my time is almost up sin I don't intend to talk about this next week because I just want to close this today sin can hinder your life bitterness can hinder your life in several ways and hinder your Prius remember we are talking about Prius here now these days I have mentioned pride and feel to live in st. bitterness and forgiving spirit oh that as bad as the they'll also help you to check yourself the Bible says that let he that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he falls at times we T was hundun as a matter of fact sometimes you think oh I am standing and I'm standing show not knowing you're not even standing if you are standing maybe on one leg and sometimes you're on your back and you think you are standing now it takes some of these things to tell you where you are because if you are living in the spirit these things do not bother you but if you can be grappling with them and dealing with them it tells you that you have lived for too long in the flesh and it's time to get out praise be to God I'm Foreman is alway in your prayer life and closing be resilient never give up the more you pray and you don't see the answer coming the more you should pray it happens that most of the times that is when we give up oh I have prayed for too long I'm not seeing results let me forget it no that is the time you should pray - shows how much faith you have in God to honor his word praise be to God Daniel prayed for 21 days he was very resilient he never give up he didn't know that from the very day he started praying the result was on the way coming but a Bible says the Prince of Persia withstood the angel it was on day number 21 that the angel Gabriel came and for that demon and got an answer to Daniel sometimes when you begin to pray God sends the results right away but this happen in the spiritual realm and you will sit down once the O God has not answered my prayer your prayer has been answered there is something that is going on and if you can just keep holding on in the face of defeat if you can be resilient believe it in God and trusted in God what happened to Daniel what happened to you also praise be to God be resilient in your prayer life when you pray believe we can talk about Jonah and I linked that to faith without faith the Bible says is impossible to please God have faith in God believe that God is more than able to honor his word and when you pray the scripture we just read if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask whatever you will and it shall be done unto you have faith in God when Jonah in the belly of the whale now I am standing on land right now if you ask me what is is the worst waste it will take me a little time to figure that out and a man that was in the belly of the whale in the deep waters what makes him tame and he says that this is the direction this I'm facing the temple right now what is it if it is not fit the Bible says by faith he turned to face the temple by faith he didn't care whether it was enough what it was the East when it was tough whether it was whatever he didn't care about it he didn't care what at the table was behind him I was beside him his fate was anchored praise be to God and when he prayed God spoke to the fish faith contains its wings around my time is up praise be to God now have a repent and hurt have a repentant heart if you want to be successful in your prayer life if you look at the people of an anyway when job went into our Jonah Jonah went and told them proclaimed the Word of God to them the Bible says from the king you guys should just give me a little just two three minutes of your time so I don't bother you next week I hope you don't mind praise God the Bible says from the king to the servant to the animals he proclaimed a fast they proclaimed a fast animals didn't eat nobody give you animals food to eat they fasted in the bread and the saw the face of God sometimes we tank repentance shows your weak side no repentance brings you to victory I don't care what it is genuine repentance would bring you to victory and God was pleased with what he did praise be to God yes so have a repentant heart now I'm out yes I would just obvious NES what I want to say coming back to the scripture we write if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you know what living in the word there is nothing that would guarantee you success more than living in the Word of God you can pray and fast all your life if you don't you do not live in the word and what according to the word you are going to live a defeated life there is power in the way to hear there is power in the way to give delivers there is power in the way to give life there is power in the word to change darkness into light there is power in the word look living in the word it's just that alone gives it a victory there is nothing honourable in the sight of God more than a child of God taking God at His Word and living by the word God is honored in that live in the world walk in the world even as you pray every day let prayer be your everyday life never give up it's a call to duty it is a call to duty praise be to God Vera Cassidy what do you want to close first love Jesus yes that's right yes Lord that's right personally as we personally know God come before us Lord we just thank you we praise you for last just ask Lord God just continue Lord to to help us to draw closer to God to take the time I just appreciate little what he said that we're gathered well god there's no special time to pray but every time that we pray especially a man it's true every time we pray a special mist oh god it's a special time we have it doesn't matter what time of day it is it doesn't matter if it's a morning or evening with Lord God it should be all the time thank God your word says to pray without ceasing work out you should you should always be in our mind always Lord God beyond our lips you should always tell you going on in our heart you always will God be their Lord that we would just want to draw closer to you and you would commune with your God every moment of every day or just grant it to us father we pray we just thank you we praise you father we bless you Lord that's not God you are worthy well worthy you so much little God for what you do well God just bless your people now see the hearts help us Lord God - we're God to allow these things to become such a part of our Lord God we would draw ever closer to you yes we just thank you for this in Jesus name Amen god bless you say [Music]
