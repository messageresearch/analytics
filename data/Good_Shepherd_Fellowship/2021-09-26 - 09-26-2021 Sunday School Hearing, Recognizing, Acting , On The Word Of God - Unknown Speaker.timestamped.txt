[1:02] with the old carnal church all the time
[1:05] because that's where he sold jesus to
[1:07] he sold jesus his birthrights
[1:11] just as much as esau did for a mess of
[1:14] pottage
[1:15] he sold his birthrights for 30 pieces of
[1:19] silver
[1:21] manny a man and woman today has sold out
[1:23] their spiritual birthright
[1:26] for some popularity
[1:28] some little thing of the world you never
[1:30] overcome some women are wearing a makeup
[1:32] and bobbing of hair
[1:34] wearing short clothes man for little
[1:36] dirty jokes and smoking cigarettes
[1:39] something of the world
[1:42] if you love the world the things of the
[1:44] world the lover god's not in you said
[1:46] the bible
[1:48] i don't want to hurt you
[1:50] but we're up to the end we're coming up
[1:51] now
[1:52] we're coming out the ladder quickly
[1:55] see how it is
[1:57] they do it
[1:59] they're predestinating they might
[2:01] impersonate and be just as sweet and
[2:03] humble just as close like christians so
[2:06] close that would deceive the very elect
[2:09] but by their fruit you shall know them
[2:12] a woman with a short son never looked
[2:14] like a christian to me
[2:16] the bible said it's a sinful and a
[2:18] shameful thing for a woman to cut her
[2:19] hair
[2:22] only one woman in the bible will ever
[2:23] paint their faces jezebel
[2:26] how about man you man is supposed to be
[2:28] christian man and let your wives do that
[2:31] when god will hold you responsible for
[2:35] not it
[2:37] carnival oh i'll go out there and join
[2:40] this church
[2:42] you think about that's just exactly what
[2:44] the scripture said they would do and
[2:45] that's just exactly what they done and
[2:47] that's what they will do
[2:50] compromise
[2:52] someone said billy if you don't stop
[2:54] that you'll run everybody away
[2:56] there's one thing that won't go the holy
[2:58] spirit because it's his word
[3:00] and the real predestinated believer
[3:02] won't go away
[3:03] because it's food to his soul he loves
[3:06] it
[3:08] nothing can keep him away from it he'll
[3:09] do anything like jacob
[3:11] but he wants that birthright
[3:14] you're standing i don't care if it cost
[3:15] every friend he's got it cost his job if
[3:18] it costs his church membership if it
[3:20] costs everything he'll still hold to it
[3:24] because he can't help it there's
[3:25] something in him
[3:26] moving him
[3:27] the deep calling to the demon
[3:30] oh
[3:35] something in him
[3:36] look
[3:37] anything you want to find in the bible
[3:39] and pick it up here go back to genesis
[3:40] and see what hatched out of
[3:42] see word come to all the spirits and
[3:44] moves today go back to genesis that's
[3:46] what we've done to prove to you these
[3:49] things that you're seeing friends
[3:53] don't forget that
[3:54] don't let it go over top of your head
[3:57] let it soak into you
[3:59] that's the things of god
[4:02] it come to a head
[4:03] and jesus predicted it would come to a
[4:05] head again in the last days
[4:08] and it would be by this the seal of god
[4:11] and the mark of the beast
[4:13] two spiritual powers working together
[4:16] now anyone knows that the seal of god is
[4:18] the birthright
[4:20] the baptism of the holy ghost ephesians
[4:23] 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of
[4:25] god whereby you're sealed to the day of
[4:27] your redemption when they were born
[4:28] again they were filled with the holy
[4:30] spirit the holy spirit is the new birth
[4:32] we know that
[4:34] you're you're begotten of the spirit
[4:35] i'll admit that but until you're born
[4:38] there's a baby's begotten in his
[4:40] mother's womb it's got one kind of life
[4:42] that's a life that's little the little
[4:44] uh cells in his body is twisting and
[4:47] kicking and jumping like that but when
[4:49] it's bomber
[4:50] it has a like that and then he squeals
[4:55] it out a living soul
[4:58] and a baby can go to church and say well
[5:00] i believe in church i'll go i'll do this
[5:01] and i'm a good i want to do right i want
[5:03] to do right but what it needs
[5:06] is a gospel spank to wake it up
[5:09] to squeal the eternal life
[5:12] the holy spirit screams in it i could
[5:15] never scream before
[5:17] and it's a new creature
[5:19] it's warned of the spirit then begins to
[5:22] grow move and have its being in god see
[5:26] just as a baby natural baby has his
[5:28] being in the world
[5:31] then if this earthly tabernacle be
[5:32] dissolved we have one waiting
[5:35] this is sure as the natural body was
[5:37] coming forth there was a spiritual body
[5:38] to receive it when it dropped from its
[5:40] mother and when it drops from the mother
[5:42] earth which is it's in the womb of it
[5:43] now groaning crying
[5:47] oh god
[5:48] groaning
[5:50] laboring getting old and sickness and
[5:53] everything
[5:54] resetting it and a spirit on the inside
[5:56] of it looking for a land beyond the
[5:58] river
[6:00] it's groaning twisting jumping
[6:04] as because there's a life in there that
[6:06] lives forever
[6:08] it's in a body that's got to die
[6:11] and sometimes this is a mother dropped
[6:12] the natural baby in a spiritual body got
[6:14] it the earth will drop in the body of
[6:17] the natural drop and the physical body
[6:20] or the celestial body will grab it down
[6:23] here if this earthly tabernacle be
[6:25] dissolved we have one waiting
[6:27] that's reason you forget the things of
[6:29] the world they're dead to you
[6:32] there's the spirit now watch it as we
[6:34] move on now the two spirits the holy
[6:36] ghost is the new birth
[6:39] we know that it's being born again of
[6:41] the spirit of god that's how you're born
[6:43] by the spirit
[6:44] born by the spirit
[6:47] that's the new birth all right
[6:49] you're begotten of the spirit then when
[6:51] you're born to the spirit you're filled
[6:53] with the holy ghost all right then when
[6:56] these two are in the earth the natural
[6:58] and the spiritual
[7:00] uh
[7:02] sometimes the
[7:05] i've seen this now i'm closing out to
[7:07] come to a close now by saying this for a
[7:10] few minutes
[7:13] in the natural are
[7:16] in the spiritual either one
[7:19] now
[7:23] i hope that everyone catches this now be
[7:26] just as quiet and reverent as you can
[7:29] now
[7:31] have you ever seen this
[7:34] you see in our churches today even in
[7:37] the
[7:37] groups
[7:39] where we have separated ourselves and
[7:41] made organizations and we've seen all of
[7:43] this
[7:44] and you've seen a man pick up a certain
[7:46] scripture
[7:48] and brother that man can take that
[7:50] scripture and make it live new
[7:52] make it live just exactly what a promise
[7:54] you're in the bible
[7:56] and the next man will see him do it and
[7:57] he'll come around and try to do it and
[8:00] fail
[8:02] i hope you're reading now
[8:05] he'll fail why
[8:07] the scripture is not inspired to him
[8:11] he's only trying to impersonate
[8:14] he's trying to act like something
[8:17] he wants maybe he was sent by man
[8:20] maybe some man said well you can do the
[8:21] same thing
[8:23] just like jesus said it would be this
[8:25] way the bible predicts it in the last
[8:27] days as jefferson james wish to moses
[8:30] yeah amen
[8:31] there stood moses and there's two jambs
[8:34] and moses threw down his rod and become
[8:36] a serpent
[8:37] why pharaoh said come here james you can
[8:39] do the same thing and he did
[8:42] see
[8:43] but what happened
[8:45] then moses rod eat up the rod of him
[8:49] see
[8:50] it was made manifest
[8:52] where was israel
[8:54] just like super sentient perception
[8:56] it's like some of the spiritualism it's
[8:58] like some of these churches that they
[9:00] believe carnal way away the things that
[9:02] they say well that was for another day
[9:05] they're all together out but watch this
[9:06] spirit in the last days go to
[9:08] impersonate the real spirit
[9:10] see that's where your trouble is coming
[9:13] just exactly like the one that's real
[9:17] but he couldn't make it manifest he
[9:19] couldn't make it whole
[9:20] he couldn't make it last
[9:23] oh god
[9:25] people come up and say i got the holy
[9:27] ghost too look where they live
[9:30] and don't last
[9:32] from one revival to another
[9:34] from one meeting to another
[9:36] it's made manifest
[9:38] they haven't got it
[9:40] if a man's born to the spirit of god or
[9:42] a woman they have the fruit of the
[9:44] spirit they walk godly they live that
[9:46] life
[9:48] they keep away from the things of the
[9:49] world
[9:50] god moves in them and makes himself
[9:52] manifest and proves that he's god
[9:54] working in there
[9:55] the other is impersonating
[9:59] impersonations that's what's been all
[10:01] the way down impersonating look at
[10:03] ishmael and isaac all down see
[10:06] impersonating
[10:07] look at the prophet moses and look at
[10:09] the prophet balaam
[10:11] see see how they come down look at judas
[10:14] and look at jesus
[10:15] and jesus predicts that this holy spirit
[10:17] in the last days would be the seal of
[10:19] god
[10:20] now what would be the mark of the beast
[10:24] would be to
[10:26] reject
[10:27] the seal of god
[10:29] for all that didn't have the seal of god
[10:31] had the mark of the beast
[10:33] and if it's two spiritual marks
[10:36] one of them will be a true mark of god
[10:39] the other will be apostasy
[10:41] can you see it
[10:43] look at the mark in the old testament
[10:45] when the trumpet blow the jubilee every
[10:47] so many years the the slaves went free
[10:50] because the trumpet sounded well
[10:52] everyone that wanted to be free could go
[10:55] but some of them they love to be slaves
[10:57] so they tuck them to the altar and in
[10:59] the post of the church and bored their
[11:01] ear with an awl and they were marked
[11:04] forever they always serve that master
[11:07] and today you'll hear a gospel message
[11:09] on truth
[11:11] now you can be free if you want to
[11:15] god speaks to you but when you get up to
[11:17] that borderline here and look over and
[11:19] have a knowledge driven man turn away
[11:22] he bores you
[11:24] in the ear and you'll always be an
[11:26] intellectual believer
[11:28] you'll be religious and go to church but
[11:30] never receive the holy ghost
[11:33] then you serve that the rest your days
[11:36] now the mark of the beast are the seal
[11:38] of god
[11:39] and we're getting so close now look the
[11:43] word has to be inspired hearing
[11:48] recognizing
[11:50] and acting upon
[11:52] many people are here
[11:55] but won't recognize it
[11:57] god will say this is the hour for you
[12:01] i wouldn't be a holy rover and i don't
[12:03] want none of that
[12:05] see they don't recognize it
[12:07] we'll go to meetings the great holy
[12:10] spirit will move down
[12:12] i was sitting there the other day
[12:14] when a vision came forth and predicted
[12:17] just exactly what i said here comes a
[12:18] young man
[12:20] come here motion to that waiter
[12:23] you have heart trouble and you're
[12:24] looking for it it's exactly right yeah
[12:27] woman coming out come here
[12:29] you've got tumor on the breast now it's
[12:31] on the left breast and you're in a very
[12:33] bad shape in your center and
[12:35] exactly right
[12:36] those men sat there looking around
[12:38] preachers and all that huh
[12:41] go to a meeting and watch the holy
[12:42] spirit go right out through the meeting
[12:44] and tell the secrets of the hearts thing
[12:45] like i say
[12:47] wonderful yes
[12:50] oh
[12:50] brother see
[12:52] it's it's on the other side
[12:54] there's something happening
[12:56] women will continue to go right on do
[12:58] the same thing man will go right on back
[13:00] like a hog to its water and a dog to its
[13:02] vomit
[13:04] just the same
[13:05] don't you see
[13:07] i'm talking to the in the you see you
[13:10] must realize and friend what condition
[13:12] you're in that's reason this tape i said
[13:14] to church only
[13:17] the church only
[13:19] if you've been called from life from
[13:22] darkness unto life from death unto life
[13:26] from a formal intellection conception of
[13:29] christ to a born-again experience and
[13:31] watching your life that it lays the
[13:33] things of the world aside you stand for
[13:35] christ regardless
[13:37] and something's happening
[13:39] there's something in you hungering and
[13:40] moving like it was jacob
[13:42] you wrestle with the lord you walk
[13:45] different after that
[13:46] something's different and you've changed
[13:48] now
[13:49] it has before it can be done it has to
[13:51] be inspired to you i don't care i could
[13:54] stand here and preach till i got
[13:56] what hair got left fell out until my
[13:58] shoulder stooped down and i was 90 years
[14:00] old and you listen every day until god
[14:03] quickens that to you
[14:05] am i
[14:07] you're still in the same shape
[14:11] two days i've been studying and praying
[14:13] on this
[14:15] i said lord should i say that to the
[14:17] church someone said say it
[14:19] the hour's at hand
[14:24] i feel it be pulling me away pretty soon
[14:27] so i i want you to know it
[14:30] no man can come to me said jesus except
[14:32] my father draws him first oh i know you
[14:35] say you have god and abraham to your
[14:36] father but
[14:37] i'll tell you this you're the your
[14:39] father the devil said jesus religious
[14:42] man
[14:42] priest and great man
[14:44] you are the devil your father
[14:47] notice
[14:49] the fruits of the spirit now see it has
[14:52] to be quickened to you i couldn't
[14:53] imagine noah saying you know what
[14:56] it just must be it might rain someday so
[14:58] i'll just go out and build me an arc
[15:00] if it rains well i'll get in the heart
[15:02] and move right away
[15:03] and nothing will bother me because i'm
[15:05] going to get the ark and move away could
[15:07] you imagine no no that wasn't it
[15:09] if that had been it oh may the elect to
[15:13] hear it now
[15:15] if that would have been it the first
[15:17] scoffer come by as the bible said there
[15:19] was
[15:20] scoffed at him he'd laid his hammer down
[15:22] and walked away
[15:24] like man does today that starts out with
[15:26] jesus
[15:27] and when they look over and see the
[15:28] truth they back away from it they can't
[15:31] stand it
[15:32] like that noted evangelist said it'll
[15:35] tear up my ministry
[15:36] i don't care for a ministry that the
[15:39] holy ghost would tear up it ought to be
[15:41] torah
[15:45] now
[15:46] let's see it's pride
[15:48] so much man so much person
[15:52] notice in this now
[15:55] noah was out in the field and he heard
[15:59] and he recognized
[16:01] and he acted
[16:03] no matter how many scoffers come he
[16:05] built right
[16:07] no away
[16:07] a holy roller don't bother me a bit
[16:10] feeling away
[16:12] he had heard he had recognized it to be
[16:14] god
[16:16] judged by the scriptures
[16:18] and it was so
[16:21] he built right away on the ark
[16:22] regardless
[16:26] could you imagine
[16:28] could you ever
[16:30] uh imagine this
[16:32] that moses is on his way to egypt
[16:35] out one day and said to zephyr his wife
[16:38] zephyr you know what
[16:40] i've polished up some on my grammar
[16:44] i have got a little my mathematics all
[16:46] straightened up
[16:47] and some of my gerometer you know many
[16:49] other things in my education since i've
[16:52] been heard and sheep back here i i've
[16:53] polished up on some of that i made a
[16:55] mistake down and he said i think i'll go
[16:57] down and correct it i think it'll go
[16:58] down no
[17:00] the first wave come against him he'd
[17:03] have fell right there
[17:05] what did he do
[17:06] he forgot all he ever known about
[17:08] dramating about uh he's intellectual it
[17:11] was the one got him in trouble that's
[17:13] what's got the church in trouble today
[17:15] is too many educated preachers without
[17:17] being born of the spirit
[17:20] many women like to listen to
[17:21] intellectual speeches instead of
[17:22] preaching the power and the resurrection
[17:24] of jesus christ
[17:26] that's what's got us in trouble today we
[17:28] don't need any more high schools in
[17:29] education for preachers
[17:31] we need god call man
[17:34] that's still with the holy spirit
[17:36] and not some man-made theology of some
[17:39] denomination
[17:41] the god-called man
[17:44] moses was hurting sheep settle down and
[17:48] forgot he noticed intellectuals had
[17:49] failed he noticed education failing
[17:53] he's hurting sheep
[17:55] but he heard
[17:57] oh
[17:58] take off your shoes moses
[18:01] the ground you're standing on is holy
[18:04] he listened to it what was it the voice
[18:07] the angel it spoke was scriptural
[18:10] he promised abraham his father i'll
[18:14] visit the people after they have been
[18:16] down here for 400 years and i'll take
[18:18] them out with a mighty arm
[18:21] you recognize that that was god's
[18:23] scripture being made manifest
[18:26] let me stop a minute let this sink in
[18:29] can you see what i'm talking about today
[18:33] god's words being made manifest right
[18:36] before you and you don't realize it
[18:42] i think now sodom and gomorrah
[18:44] think of the promise of christ for the
[18:46] last days
[18:48] moses recognized it it was scriptural it
[18:51] was a promise
[18:52] he heard he recognized
[18:55] something come in him
[18:57] brother he could go do it then
[19:00] he acted
[19:02] he could go down and stop ever pharaoh
[19:05] he could call flags when he wanted to
[19:09] he could open a red sea
[19:11] because he had heard
[19:13] he'd recognized he was acting in god's
[19:16] spirit
[19:18] i'll be god to you you'd be prophet to
[19:20] me he said
[19:22] and he said i can't do it he said well
[19:23] then you be god and let aaron be your
[19:25] prophet
[19:26] you must go anyhow
[19:28] he never just said well maybe i'll go
[19:30] down and straighten the things up could
[19:32] you imagine elijah on mount carmel said
[19:34] you know this land's awful sinful
[19:36] perhaps maybe i are to go out and tell a
[19:38] heavy arc be ashamed of these things
[19:40] maybe i were to go up on the mountain
[19:42] there and stay down and just fast so
[19:44] long until then people get so sick and
[19:45] tired to see me up there starving to
[19:47] death no
[19:49] no that wasn't it
[19:51] heard
[19:55] he recognized
[19:57] and he acted i have commanded the ravens
[20:00] to feed you get up there but cedric
[20:07] when it come time
[20:09] for a showdown between baal and god
[20:13] he said go get your sacrifices
[20:16] do anything to him you want to call upon
[20:19] your god
[20:20] when they cut themselves and had a lot
[20:22] of flesh and jumped up and down had a
[20:24] lot of noise he said holler a little
[20:25] louder maybe he's gone pursuing some
[20:27] more he might be asleep
[20:29] oh brother
[20:32] well you know what he said i'm a
[20:34] believer in jehovah so i can do this
[20:35] anyhow oh no don't you impersonate that
[20:39] no why don't you try to be elijah until

[20:48] them down there too

[20:52] then when he cut the block and poured
[20:54] the water on he said lord i've done this
[20:56] at your command
[20:59] see though anybody else would have tried
[21:01] it we've been a total failure
[21:03] it's got to be inspired to you the holy
[21:06] spirit has to bring it and make it
[21:08] manifest to you
[21:09] that's what's the matter today
[21:11] you can't go up the altar and say well

[21:15] holy ghost hallelujah hallelujah no but
[21:17] brother sister one of the holy ghost is
[21:19] inspired that word to you

[21:28] and do that the old leaves will just pop
[21:30] off a new lease oh come on

[21:34] you won't get angry with the preacher
[21:36] when he preaches truth from the bible
[21:37] you'll love it reach for it
[21:40] it's food to your soul
[21:44] even jesus himself
[21:46] he said i do not what i want to do
[21:48] within myself the son can do nothing but
[21:51] what he sees the father doing
[21:54] the words he was emmanuel himself he was
[21:57] god on earth jesus was
[21:59] he was the flesh that god dwelt and he
[22:01] was a tent that god lived under
[22:04] amen
[22:05] but in all of that the virgin born son
[22:08] of god emmanuel in the fullness of the
[22:10] spirit he had the spirit without measure
[22:13] amen and yet in his own flesh
[22:15] he said i'll do nothing
[22:17] until the father shows me first
[22:20] inspired dream to do it
[22:22] satan said turn these stones into bread
[22:24] and perform a miracle let me see you do
[22:26] it
[22:26] he said it's written man shall i live by
[22:28] bread alone
[22:31] oh my god
[22:34] but when a crab was hungry
[22:37] he picked up five biscuits and two
[22:39] little fish and fed five thousand
[22:41] oh hallelujah

[23:00] different things of the lord you can't
[23:01] do that
[23:03] that things comes by election

[23:08] god from the mother's womb
[23:10] gifts and callings are without
[23:12] repentance

[23:24] thankful person in the world
[23:26] because he has called you
[23:28] then it becomes real to you
