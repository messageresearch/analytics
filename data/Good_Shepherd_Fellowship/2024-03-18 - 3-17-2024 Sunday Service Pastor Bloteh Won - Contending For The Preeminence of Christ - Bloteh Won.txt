we will have a baptism of service there's a young man that should uh be traveling over uh tomorrow morning he's over in the military they want to want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so he'll be driving uh and coming over tomorrow for service and uh so I'm I'm saying that uh uh just also to give the opportunity to them that being uh thinking about being baptized and uh uh we would like to do that so if you if you've been thinking about it you've been praying about it let us know after the service what normally happen is that whenever we have just one person we use the baptism or truck that we have because uh it have enough water for one person so if we will have more than one person then we can be able to make arrangement to either get uh uh the BST tray that we use in time pass so that's the reason why I'm I'm announcing it I know of one person that's the one that will be driving uh tomorrow so if there is more than one then we can make preparation to set up the Baptist tray out there uh right in the fire uh uh for baptising after service if not the tro is enough for one person praise the Lord amen when he when he or she gets on and come up the water is covered praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord thank you brother Jordan for having us yesterday it was a little time of uh Fellowship we appreciate that and uh uh that's what I have for an announcement like we want to remind you our brother asaiah Jason will be with us uh uh Saturday night and and Sunday morning there for Easter weekend there the 30th and the 31st he will be with us uh speaking for us uh uh on our Easter Service we'll continue to pray for brother Rabel Wilson wife and uh she's going through uh her treatment and uh that's why they they will never be able to be with us from Chicago uh he was going to come down with his group but it will not be able to come because his wife is not feeling well and she should be doing uh her treatment right before the Easter so we want to keep that in prayer as well what can we say that the Lord is good amen and all the time the Lord is good this morning we want to get right into what we want to talk about this morning and uh uh trying to perfect myself on this on the using of this PowerPoint uh threw me off this morning because uh I was trying to uh uh um is that highlight my words or um you know put them in the way that uh uh when when we are reading it will be able to grab your attention and then sometimes you get doing there it turn to a video game and you're just going back and for praise the Lord and uh so I just told brother Jordan I will go back and forth because I wish I would have just put all my scriptures right into there and then uh uh then at least I won't have to bother them projecting scripture so brother Jordan bear with me and uh I got in a little bit late this morning so uh I'm not able to hand you that list but I I'll try not to not to bore you with a lot of them but as the Lord will help us this morning let's just stand on our feet we'll turn to the scripture praise the Lord speaking Wednesday tonight on the uh uh T John uh and then we we spoke about uh uh de tropers the one that love to have the preeminence among the Brethren a kind of a room me to our T this morning so that's where I want to go let's read uh from the book of cusan uh um that will be the scripture that was read for the message uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is the mystery of God revealed because it is it is uh uh the Fulfillment of that mystery in the Fulfillment of that mystery that uh uh Paul expressed here how uh God choose a people to have a preeminence in so we want to read from uh verse 12 of uh Colossians chapter 1 giving thanks unto the Father which have made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son reading this the last time we said this is a change of headship he has taken us from under one headship he has put us under another headship praise the Lord in whom Christ we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who Christ is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature praise the Lord the firstborn of every creature for by him we all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or Dominion or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist that that he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead praise the Lord okay the verse is already on and he is the head of the body the church Who is the the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in uh all things he might have the preeminence the next verse for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness D Praise the Lord let's go to the book of Jude that is just before Revelation the book of Jude it's a one chapter book in the book of Jude by inspiration is placed in such a unique place in the Bible just before the revelation of Jesus Christ Jude uh he gave us a letter he gave us an encouragement year and that's what we want to read we want to read from verse one to verse four you might not I see verse three but uh uh I we can read down a little bit Jude the seven of Jesus Christ the brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the father and Preserve in Jesus Christ and called Mercy on to you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exal you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered onto the Saints for there are for there are certain men creep in on way word who were before of all ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into last viciousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord now as James I mean as Jude goes on and he continue to read you can read till the last but I would like to read the last uh uh two verses before we close if we had time it would have been good to just read verse by verse and and uh and make some comment but let's turn to verse 24 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and majestes Dominion power both now and ever amen let's pray together father it's truth Lord you are the only one that can keep us from falling you are the one that have kept us Lord out of these years since we came to know you you are the only wise God lord we just want to thank you this morning for giving us this privilege Lord father to be in the house of God to be in The Fellowship of the sins we want to ask your blessings now that Lord father you will come in a special way and and just bless us together speak to us now out of your word in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat the Lord bless you you may have your seat this morning trying to find how to to give ourself a thought to talk about this morning I thought we should speak on containing for the preeminence of Christ containing Jud says uh we must earnestly contain for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints we know that their faith was the faith that Paul preached that Faith was the faith that was promised by Malachi to be restored unto us praise the Lord but I try to narrow it down for us to be able to see you know because in every age in every dispensation there was a word that was given to the people now if you look in the three four mysteries of Christ like we spoke about and uh uh uh if uh the if our technicians will help us and let's just put uh Christ is the mystery of God up that first quote okay now we we quoted this a little bit on Wednesday night Christ is the mystery of God revealed and uh and and what what we were what we were trying to look at uh in in referring to this is there uh God great mystery that was in his mind like uh brother brandham said God had one God and his his plan was a Plan of Redemption but yet he had to in some way simplify it some way break it down to us so in uh in in in the dispensation of time he went about unfolding the the mystery so this is the three four purpose the first one is to express himself completely God was expressing himself he he expressed himself little in David Express himself lat in danard in Moses in Joseph but he wanted to have a body where he can bring a full expression of all the the little expression that was Through the Ages and he was able to find a body and that was Christ praise the Lord so God first purpose in his mind was for him to express himself completely because he's a God that love to be known he don't want to be hidden he want to be known praise the Lord so his purpose was to express himself completely God in Christ praise the Lord amen now the second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body his bride praise the Lord now pay attention now till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them now yeah he wanted to express himself in one man after doing it All Through the Ages in bit in pieces praise the Lord Joseph was a perfect type of Christ praise the Lord amen but he was not a complete type of Christ Christ why because he toore a lie right he broke the type right okay praise the Lord he came so close it's just like menusa coming so close to live a thousand years Joseph came so close he was sold h h h he was hated by his brothers he was sold he was in prison he had two men one was delivered one was condemned he did he did everything right but just that one piece of a lie praise the Lord but in Christ God was able to find one man where the fullness could D it bodally the fullness of God dwell in Jesus Christ bodally now in having the preeminence which is the second for purpose he wanted to have a preeminence to have the preeminence by this in his church the church is going to be his body the bride praise the Lord amen yeah the body was one man yeah the body is going to be many members that's right praise the Lord but what he achieve up here by expressing himself he's going to achieve the same thing here by expressing himself amen the purpose is not the name of the church the purpose is not the amount of people the purpose is not I mean what we are doing the purpose of us Gathering here is God getting the people to express himself through them praise the lordu amen if we miss there we miss the mark right if we miss there we are just another denomination Church praise the lord we just only have the privilege to know about William Brandon but we are just a denomination until God can be able to get a people to achieve this now so you see here he was able to get one man to express himself completely that was his first PO for purpose the first purpose he did it through the old test men and uh H H types and Shadow in many ways and he was able to have a body and he he did that completely now that's the reason why I I I titled this containing praise the Lord I title it containing for the preeminence for Christ because it is our responsibility if we are containing for the faith we must be containing for Christ to have the preeminence amen that's what we must be fighting for now how much to prove we know the message or how much to prove we read the Bible or how long we've been serving Christ no we must be containing it's not going to be a one man over another is going to be a body Ministry praise the lord it's going to be a b the ministry and let me tell you something about the book of Jude said in the book of Jude a little bit I realized that Jude Jude under his inspiration of writing this book he's one of the person that spoke about the spirit of apostle say read the entire book of Jude you will see he he he speaks he address the spirit of apostasy he took the gloves off and I want to try to do the same this morning he took the gloves off he said there are set men Among Us Praise the Lord he said there are set man among us verse three beloved when when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful it was needful amen when I took my time to write unto you of this faith that is becoming common to us it was need for me to remind you for me to exalt you of your responsibility praise the Lord it was needful for me to write onto you and exalt you that yes should earnestly content for the fight which was once delivered to the sins for there are certain men creep in on aware praise the Lord amen so as Jude now let let me show you now some the the way he start he he's talking about these these Intruders these men that have intruded into the church in the book of Acts the Bible says there was a Mis multitude that's how the Bible called it that was in the early church praise the Lord now but see what he was says as he goes down he says verse five I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroy them that believe n what is he trying to do he's trying to say we have set men that creep in on thew Moses in his exodor has certain men that creep in on the way right are we together and those men under the exor of Moses that creeped in on a word all they were trying to do is destroy the confidence of the people in the leadership that God gave to lead the exodor right all they were doing reminding the people of the garc in uh uh uh uh in Egypt are we together and see how how far he would go with this he never only stopped that he said the angels we kept not their first ested but left their habitation have and he went back even to the beginning before even time yeah praise the Lord Jude he's he's dealing with something here he's dealing with the spirit of apostasy the rebellions of the the rebellion of Ang ERS that have that have influenced men on Earth and have brought all sorts of H H filter and uncleanness to the church are we together now and as he goes back he talk about the angels that kept now their ass said he says even as sod and gomorra the city you know he he he he he lacking that talking about this this and and and and we always say it you know every wrong teaching has a wrong spirit amen and it will never be able to produce a decent life praise the Lord it won't be able to produce an overcoming life right are we together so he goes here and talk about even Sodom and gomorra he talks about uh and everything that was going there he says and they are all set for an example uh suffering the virence of internal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers defy the flesh despise Dominion they speak evil of dignity and and and all of that so you see he's dealing with with uh with a spirit of apostasy but what what he's bringing us to is is uh uh an Awakening praise the Lord now look you you you have to keep your eyes open yeah amen you have to keep your eyes open in as much as uh you know we we we we we we love when the Lord you know is is is blessing the church and and the Lord is making us a witness and the Lord you know is uh in as much as we love all of those things we must also realize that we have an enemy praise the lord we have one that used to be among the angers praise the lord we have one that knows that knows about he knows about worship he knows all of that so he's he's bringing us to this place and and that's where I want to grab our attention uh uh this morning by the help of God praise the Lord by the help of god good to see you br good to know that you feeling well this morning praise the Lord and uh so uh that's that's what I want for us to to look at this morning as as we look into that so we go back again to to our slide and that is the reason why we want to contain for the preeminence of Christ because that's that's our calling in this in this whole three four mystery this is our place we are the people that Christ will have the preeminence in amen we are the people that supposed to LIF up his name in the dying generation in an age that is that is growing into unbelief we are the people that's what we are called for that's what he called us for to give him the preeminence praise the Lord amen now you see and uh uh uh uh second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them and then the third one to restore the kingdom to his right position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the Cod of the evening and we've been talking about walking in health praise the Lord walking in health so it it restore us back back to edting that's the three-fold purpose now so as as we look at this together like I said I want to be just like Jude he took off the glove I mean he was he was hitting the spirits with his bad hands and that's what I want to do this morning hallelujah praise the Lorden amen and and and and the reason why I want to do it the reason why I want to do it is because we are fighting the Same Spirit praise the lord we have these same spirits that have intruded into the last day is faith we have this seen spirits that are intruding into our homes praise the Lord amen the enemy is doing everything he's trying to do it's going to be a constant fight until we get out of here so we we have to be we have to be we have to be waking to death amen we we have to be waken to death let's take uh uh let's take this one and then uh we go who is this mesc metic the Bible said 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in flesh he was manifested in flesh handled with hands that's what John said in first John we handle him the word from the beginning we handle him for God was manifested in flesh that's why Paul said almighty God the invisible God what does that what does that spell to us it brings us back to the first purpose God getting a flesh God getting a man God expressing himself in man amen God was manifested in flesh handle with hands God eat meat God drank water God slept God cried at the grave of Lazarus praise the Lord amen but yet as soon as he WEP his eyes he said Lazar comes forth praise the Lord he was the one he was one of us a beautiful type in the Bible there was God above us God With Us Now is God in us having the preeminence is God in us prise God the Holy Spirit not not a tear person not a tear person the same person amen praise the Lord amen but now see yeah this is this is where my cat is on this God came down and became flesh and died the death in Christ so that he can he could clean the church in order to get into it for Fellowship praise the Lord so the threefold purpose is right here right here he got a flesh he came down he paid the price to be able to redeem the people that he can get a preeminence take them back to Eden for Fellowship are we together he came down he he become flesh and died the death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for Fellowship God love Fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time for was for Fellowship praise the Lord amen amen so as we as we look at that we realize that Jude is calling us to a place of uh accountability praise the lord we have that responsibility that has been given to us and in contending for the faith we can do it in a selfish way because is a body Ministry praise the Lord if you think that you're doing so well looking at yourself looking after yourself and you know get your devotion together your walk with God and your walk with God and your walk with God and you are not watching over the others you are not going anywhere praise the Lord you are not going anywhere the last one man scripture in the Bible to be fulfilled is the one that is laying for Moses in Elijah Revelation 11 to Israel every other promise that is in the scripture to be fulfilled for the church is a body Ministry we shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye it's we it's not I shall be changed it's we shall be changed it's a body promise are we together it's a body the promise so we we we see that and I think that's what Jude is is is bringing us to he's trying to help us you know that's why we are called to contain for this Faith contain for for the preeminence of Christ in his church we must contend for that we must do everything now so you will realize as as I said uh we will We Will by the help of our group back there we will go we will go back and forth now so Wednesday night when when we were looking into into uh trying to finish our beginning series John identified a character he's talking to this beloved Brothers there in the church that have had a good testimony but he did not fail to recognize that in the infanty of the church that there was something that was going on that was not right he addressed the position of this uh other brother that was in a church uh uh di tropis people call him deot trophy Di trophies and he over there in t John now so and and and and John speaks of him and and says uh he's one of the ones that have uh the Bible says he loved to have the preeminence and morning among the Believers and even John said he would not even receive us he put himself to such a place I don't know what what Authority he had uh uh there there's not much I've been all through the week I've been trying to look for a little bit uh in history about him but uh uh it looks like he was he was an a Very influence man a man with lot of influence and the scripture says he will even you know uh uh uh not one he will even stop the Believers now I will have spent lot of time which of course I tried to gather seven different characteristics that I saw in in in the comment that John make here I'm not going to go into that this morning but but that is that is what is bringing us to this place uh because actually there's three times that the Bible will mention that were preeminent Solomon use it one in Ecclesiastes Paul use it where we read it uh uh this morning in the book of cusan and yeah John is using it the three times that the Bible will actually use that word and uh uh in the first time that Solomon used it he shows that man the way that man is made God made him to have preeminence over the Beast over the animals praise the Lord when Paul uses it Paul shows that Christ must have preeminence over man when John uses it John shows that there is one am more man that is not allowing Christ to have the preeminence in him him but he's asserting their preeminence over his brothers it bring us over to the mystery of iniquity that Paul talks about in The Book of tesalon Praise the Lord the man of sin he will exalt himself above everything we know that's that's a prophecy that is waiting for a fulfillment the time of the of of the Antichrist you know in but here Paul I mean John is identifying one in the local church praise the Lord amen so we want to spend a little time on there this morning by the help of God but before we do that we we also want to continue to encourage you and so we will encourage you by reading this also brother said this in question and answer he says I'm here to try to help you because I love you you are my children that I have begotten to Christ praise the Lord amen and we can say Amen to death praise the Lord because by the grace of God we have we are all honor his ministry you are my children that have begotten into Christ I claim every one of you I claim you tonight I claim you all the time that is the position of a father that is the position of a parent that was what job was doing for his children no matter what was going on there he was he was claiming them he was he was putting them under the burns uh burnt offering he said I claim you all the time praise the Lord I've always claimed you as my brothers and sister you are my children I'm your father in The Gospel not father as as uh it be a Catholic priest I'm your father in The Gospel as Paul said there I have begotten you to Christ I've exposed you to Christ that's engaged you to Christ as a Chase virgin praise the Lord amen I've called you out of Judaism and I have given you to the word praise the Lord amen I've exposed you to Christ as a chased virgin he said don't let me down that's the reason why I think we must put on our boats and start standing up for this word amen containing for the faith praise the Lord he says don't let me down don't let me down you stay a Chase virgin stay with the word praise the Lord stay truth to the word amen your favorite preacher or Pastor May F away you stay with the word praise the Lord all the ones that you started with in the in the in the LA they might all get away stay with the word praise the Lord amen don't let me down he says how will I do it brother Brandon how will I do it how will I stay chased to the word how we I stay like a virgin to the word it says the the Matthew 25 the 10 virgin praise the Lord he says how will I do it now see here he never talks about well a great mystery understand the seven Church agent you got to keep all the seven Messengers in order you got to know the date of the seven Church ages that's not what he said right you got to know how to explain the seals you got to know Daniel 70 week you must be able to break this mystress that's not what he said how can I do it stay right with the word live clean and pure having nothing to do with the things of the word is that difficult oh sure you have to fight you have to stand your ground it is not just as easy as it is written in rare letters praise the Lord because the devil knows that's what you are called to so he's going to throw every filthy thing before you he's going to try to distract you and and and get you to a place and discourage you and and make you and and and and and and make you to lose the feeling of the importance of why we are here Paul says we have cloud of witnesses there are men that has walked this walk ones that have given their life and their family for this word for this faith for this gospel and they are all on the bner of heaven looking down at you and myself praise the Lord amen amen we are all looking at you know uh uh uh uh uh uh uh in in in the Dark Ages uh like we said on Wednesday night those people they were under the anointing of an ox God put a sacrificial anointing on them they could they could they could they could stand no matter how how much they were threatening they were hearing the rolling of lions out there and they were told deny Christ or else will feed you to the lion praise the Lord they never had more knowledge of the word than you have praise the lord it's just it was the anointing that was on them for that time both small young and old they stood for the name of Christ and they were fear to the Lions praise the Lord in the Old Testament Daniel was put in the lion den and the Lord shot the lion's mouth Yes amen praise the Lord now if your faith if your faith the faith in your mind is that God shut the lion's mouth God is going to shut this lion's mouth then you don't you really don't have a Faith No you don't have a faith because h h h h shedra Mish and Faith was not that God will shut the line your mouth or Daniel Faith was not that God will shut theine his mouth he didn't know what would happen right just like with the fire furnace those boys didn't know what will happen they said even if God do not deliver us we will not deny him so you not you you are not wanting to do it because you know God will deliver you why if God don't show up are you just going to trash everything no are we together you love the Lord and I realized that we might not be having uh a Roman sackers with with with lions and all of that but we have more than that right praise the Lord because in in in in in in in in that age there was one place that would go either Target Center everybody goes there but now our own Alliance are everywhere praise the Lord amen stay with the word stay right with the word live clean P have nothing to do with the things of the word praise the Lord amen stand for Christ the best you know how With all sincerity amen tell him your weaknesses tell him your areas of struggle praise the Lord because he knows and you know are we together let's take this other one before we we uh really move the gloves off our hands this morning now remember God is looking to me to see that I stay with the word and I'm looking to you to see that you carry out the word in this church praise the Lord amen a form of uh holding ourself accountable one to another you will realize as we as we will look into the few verses that we have to look into this morning as we as we dive into the subject like I've said to you before i' I've uh you know I've laid there before you uh in in in the form of a challenge and you you read the book of Acts you will realize that the word l o v e is not spelled in the book of AR wow even though love is impli the Bible say they brought their gifts and lay at the Apostle feet amen they took care of the widows they took care of the homeless that but the word love is not spell in the book of AR it's why the reason in the way that I see it is because the early Christian love was not just a language love was something that was possessing their body praise the Lord they were not going about and saying well you know let's just love everybody I mean let's let's love let's just love and because in the way that the present Society now is expressing and emphasizing love is is that let's just let's leave people TOS let's just condone anything any matter anything you want to do do it amen praise the Lord but that was not how the early Christians saw it they came they came to an understanding why will make those men leave their wives and children and and and and go down there and and and and and those sahed councel we tied them to the post we whip them when they were told uh H uh uh uh uh I mean and in whose name you heal this man you know go go and and and testify to the people and there's nothing about this Jesus and it says are we going to listen to you or are we going to listen to God they would get weped on their back these were older men they were not they were not young guys like uh like you and myself they were elderly guys they would get weped and the Bible says they will come out of that Hall rejoicing praise the Lord why because just couple of days or months ago the witness imp Palace hard and innocent manuh amen how his beard was pulled out and they understood by the holy ghost that according to the scripture he was bruised for our iniquity praise the Lord the chasy of our peace was upon him and wav the strip on his back we can benefit Divine Healing we can benefit every form of healing yes are we together now that is the reason why they were rejoicing they wanted to be partakers they felt that it was a privilege now so you think about it now with everything that they have gone through these guys were believing that Jesus he he he was the man we were waiting for we will kick out this room and and it did not happen praise the Lord and here is the Holy Ghost year and the church has begin right there I mean 3,000 gave their their hearts to the Lord can you imagine what a baptism service it was that day praise the Lord I mean I'm not sure if Peter was the only one that did the baptism 3,000 men is seem there but in as much as a Rejoice the heart that men were coming to the knowledge of Jesus Christ their savior the apostles also had their eyes open they also have their eyes open and you will realize that it is not only Jew that use this language a setting set men creep in on the word you find that it's all over in the book of Acts Acts chapter 5 the Bible says set man in his wife ananas and Safar the Bible call him set men Acts chapter 15 The Bible also say certain men were putting more burden on on the disciples are we together amen now so the early Christian knew thatth you know H H this thing was given to them they have this responsibility to bring Christ to the people to bring Christ to the nation the Bible says Simon came in one Simon he came in and in h h uh you know uh I mean he he was the champion of the city he were lying to people with all his magic tricks tricks praise the Lord when he saw the disciple praying for people and people testifying that they are healed he wanted to know how can I get that power now you see he did not join the church because he wanted to be safe yeah right he didn't say I believe Jesus Christ as my lord and savior he wanted to know how can I get that power right right to be able to pray for the sick so when these guys go I can blow up this city right praise the Lord the same thing they did that day the same thing is happening now oh yes yes sir praise the Lord you you just have to know all the cliches yes know the cliches in the message you just have to know it praise the Lord the moment you can wrap your tongue and say the prophecy you get their attention they love the prophet just say the prophecy praise the Lord because there are thousand things that been said the prophet said he never said it right that's right are we together you see what I'm going this morning God is looking to me to see that I stay with the word and I'm looking to you to see that you carry out the word in this church and keep it spiritual for remember all the forces all the dark kingdom of Satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow my my as you begin to grow as long as you are playing they are okay with you but when you begin to grow praise the Lord then all hell break loose are we together amen and all hell break loose because as you begin to grow you will be coming forth in a sture of a of a of a perfect man you'll be coming forth as a living Monument for the Living God Amen and as you begin to grow then all hell break loose are we together and you must be a soldier praise the Lord not just fresh recruits my praise the Lord some people stay recruit all the days of their life right praise the Lord but you must be a soldier you must find the thing about a soldier is every one of them have a post of Duty yes sir you must find your post of Duty what is my place in the body yes praise the Lord amen what's my post of Duty what's my responsibility what do I bring to the body my what do I bring to this body to keep the church clean what do I bring to this body to help the the the the the the the service go smooth to help the the you know the the the spiritual warfare that is going on you must be a soldier not just a recruit you are a soldiers now and being trained to fight praise the lord we are been trained to fight and that's the way we can contend for the preeminence of Christ in the body is to fight fight for what is Right fight against anything that is wrong amen praise the lord we fight for what is right and we fight against anything that is wrong amen praise the Lord amen because you see let me tell you something and I believe that is the truth the word is a seed the word that we reading from this Bible is a seed praise the Lord amen the word has been preached on this part this part that covered by this breaks year for for the moment of time the word has been preached here it has been preached here there are many men that have come through this pullit and the word has been preached and I'm telling you some days if Jesus T we all might be gone praise the Lord amen may God help us us to stay with the word not to mix it with anything Hallelujah that if we drop dead there will be another generation that will pick up that word and it will be Echo right from this place [Music] amen praise the Lord amen you are called to fight for what is Right fight against anything that is wrong and Satan will come among you men creep in on word he will come among you and cause you to dispute with one another if he can praise the Lord what are some of the dispute things that don't even have no what are some of the dispute praise the Lord amen this is a that that's my St that's my stain I take my stain right your stain only separate you from the body True Praise the Lord it only separate you from the body our stand supposed to help the B what what are we called to our stand supposed to help making Christ having his preeminence in the body if you are standing for something let it be something that will help Christ to have the preeminence if it is just only for you then it's a spirit of deot trophy because you want to have the preeminent everybody should bow down to your stand everybody should follow your way of doing it are we together now you you know that um that I had a good night last night amen I'm I'm I'm not angry I'm not angry I'm just I'm just trying to drive this thing through amen I want you to see it don't don't don't think that I'm I'm I'm I'm coming after you you know yeah I mean I have your number pretty much know where everybody live if I want to talk to you I'll go to your house praise the Lord L amen yeah so let let me just deal with that now so the devil can get in the m and says well maybe he's talking to this brother or he's talking to that brother I I'm talking to the devil amen praise the Lord amen why because you know what I'm trying to do I'm trying because it's it's it's a b work amen I'm trying to to also have you take off your gloves and says no it's enough with this nonsense amen sir I'm not just going to be sitting down around and and and just I mean Church you just show up it's not a place that you just show up in in your home in your home where you call your home you just don't show up in your home right if it's your home you have a responsibility to that home true the Lord in your home you have your obligation yes sir praise the lord and there are things that are not your obligation but because you are part of that home you are obliged to do it praise the Lord that's how every family runs then why God why God's family should run different than that why should the house of God all run different than that why should it be only one person responsibility and not every one of us responsibility praise the Lord are we together so I I I hope I try to make myself self clear amen and Satan will come in among you and cause you to dispute with one another if he can't turn him down just immediately now take it from the church even in

we try to work it out ourself praise the Lord where am I right here praise the Lord and S will turn them on you cause you to this people with one another if he can turn him down just immediately you are Brethren it's the enemy and we are here that's that's what I uh place this in red we are here to hold a stander my my my that's what the message of the hour is all about yes the Bible says when the enemy come as a flaw the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard and how do God raise up a standard how did he raise up a standard in the days of Noah when uh when men were evil their imagination by Grace he got one man attention yes sir called Noah by Grace he got that man attention and said this word is going down this is going down praise the Lord build me a boat it was God's tender for that generation yes he raised up a stander above the Judgment above the immoralities above the wickedness of man he just got one man attention and that's what he's doing in this day is getting our attention that this age is going down this generation is going down the only future yeah the prosperous future is the rapture amen praise the Lord It's The Rapture he have just used his word to grab our attention and when God grabbed a people's attention he grabbed that's what he did with with Moses and and and and his group in the exodor whenever God does that he raise up a standard praise the Lord the enemy can do whatever he wants to do he can I mean he can do everything he want to God has got a people that he has lift up a standard this is not a society is not a club it's not a court the message of the hour is all about God raising up a standard putting value back in our family life yes putting value back in raising our children the right way value back in husband and wife being happy together praise the lord we can have all the divorce story but yet God has raised up a standard yes we can look among us there are people that have 20 year of marriage 30 year of marriage 40 year of marriage God has raised up a standard in an age where people go to the court the marriage today as soon as they come out they divorce tomorrow but God have raised up a standard he has given people the value to be able to fight for their home fight for their marriage fight for their children that's what the standard is that's what the message of the hour is that's what I know it is praise the Lord message of the hour is not to make every one of us Americans or every one of us Africans or you know bring a set culture and just stick everybody head in it to to to turn uh uh uh you know uh uh uh a tribal we of doing things right no it's Christ having the preeminence amen the people that he have called from different walks of life the beauty there is that he give us the grace for us to be able to encourage one another for us to be able to support one another for us to be able to bear with one another praise the Lord even sometimes it's hard to Bear but when we get to brotherly kindness we bear with one another that that that virtue of Brotherly kindness what it is is that you you you start to believe God if God can bring you to a life of discipline you can believe that God is able to bring the nest man to that that's what brotherly kindness is yeah it's not you acting as a champion over the Believers no there is no Champion we have one Champion that Jesus Christ amen are we together I have less than few minutes to get off this place I took off my glove I have not done anything yet and we are here to hold up a standard in this evening evening time evening light time that's when the word is Ding and the whole church kingdom is going to the Council of churches praise the Lord and sometimes that's what astonish people because we get so used to the way everybody is doing it and they think that that's the way it's supposed to be no let's go back to the word praise the Lord let's go back to the word now so we we are called to to contend for the faith or contain uh uh uh this thing is not mov okay content for the preeminence of Christ now so this is what I want for us to look at look just look at these few few verses with me and uh uh uh uh Little Grace if you will help us back there as as as uh as Jude talks about this like I said you go over to the book of Acts you see you'll see a setting of them Acts chapter 5 Paul talks about a set man ananas and and and his wife you think about that think about that if if if both their husband and wife were holding one another accountable to the word we will not have that story right praise the Lord you can see a disconnection between that family and what was happening in that church praise the Lord you can see a disconnection if uh if if a kind and his family if the wife and the children were holding their father accountable to the word and says you remember Moses says we we should not take anything from that place praise the Lord the whole family wouldn't have been burned praise the Lord but but but sometimes we think is is love we think is is our expression of love we love our children we love our wife we love our husband that sometimes when when when when the wrong is there we don't cry out we don't call for help praise the Lord we love our pastor that when we see the wrong we don't we don't call for help but if you look in you look in the church you look in the early church you will realize to be able to have Christ having the preeminence in his church we must be able to hold one another accountable to the word praise the Lord I'm responsible to live what I preach amen we must hold ourself if Daddy is doing something that is not according to the scripture said dad is that thing is it is it is it is it according to the Bible praise the Lord sir a wife holding her husand accountable to the word is she's not a supping Authority she's just empowering you yes sir because when you leave the world you don't have no authority over her right that's right you you just going to be brutal I'm your husand you got to listen to me I'm your H you don't have to fight for it you are not the one that wrote it yes it's God that wrote [Music] it and when you submit to Christ it will comes automatically praise the Lord let's see some few verses here we before we we we we we turn this thing over sorry I should have just um Romans chapter 16 verse 17 Romans 16 praise the Lord amen Paul who speaks here you go back just go back and listen to some of the things that he said before he comes to this verse he said now I beset you Brethren mark them which cause Division and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and Evo them they were not seeking to make their Church big they were seeking to find a church where Christ is alive amen where the word is coming alive are we together look at the Council of uh of of of of of the of of the LA Church why did they came together Acts chapter 15 verse one the Bible says and certain men came came down from from from Juda taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses so there was certain men that creep in what they were trying to do they were trying to force the church to Judaism even the Gentile Believers that have given their heart to Christ they were forcing every one of them to Judaism so when the when the when they Church realized that what they did they brought men together said Peter come and tell these brothers what happened in the house of colinus it was not a Jewish church it was a gentile church and Peter realized that the Gentile received the Holy Ghost much easier than the Jews the Jews had to stay 10 days with him the the Gentile just need one service while the word was preached yes and if you read you read Acts chapter 15 Peter says he he said it in this way I would have preferred that we receive the Holy Ghost the way the Gentile receive it that's right they were not seeing things and just and just going home and just talking about it they just sit down in their family and just talk and just bring this person down and bring this other person down and bring this other person let me tell you something there's a difference when you are talking about a concern let me show you where the difference is the difference when you are really concerned and you talking to another brother or you're talking to another sister about brother one if you are really concerned you will end that conversation and say let's pray yes amen it's a conversation of concern because whenever we pray we bring those things under the blood praise the Lord but when we just we just we just uh uh uh increase one another blood pressure oh yeah I might say I was seeing I say I can see some things I just don't want to talk I can see y you just increasing your blood pressure that's right amen amen you are just increasing your blood pressure brother bam says that's what balak hired bam for he hired bam to come and point out the wrong that was in the church when Israel was moving you see I I I know these people are heos they get young people they young people are young people they do young people think come and point out some of those things that know they are men and their wife they are forcing come and preach about it that's what he brought bam for bam went to meditate to get his salmon he came and started preaching Prosperity Gospel he said I see no iniquity in Israel said what this God is doing right why because the pillow of fire was covering the people Jesus Promised wherever two or three I gather in my name I will be there and his presence is enough it's enough it's enough to help our young people that's why we pray for them until they come to the reality of what what this word is all about our his pres is enough to help our couples in their home his present is enough we don't need a Hing preacher and say come you got to preach on this brother this brother giving this church hard time it has never worked it it has just released evil spirit in the church it has never worked are we together Philippians chapter 3 vers vers 17 Philippians chapter 3:1 17 praise the Lord Philippians 3:17 Paul who says here to the Brethren also he says Brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example praise the Lord and uh in in in Thessalonian chapter 3 also verse 14 and if any man obey not the not our words by this episode not that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother if a man is not lining up to the word tell him say you can do better than this you can do better you know what the wor is you can do better praise the Lord the promise to this church is the outpouring of the Dynamics BR B said the promise to this last day church is is the outpouring of the Dynamics with all all the all the the you know uh uh wonderful Vehicles we had having out there if there should just come something that suck all the petroleum from your vehicle this morning maybe only the ones with electric vehicle might get away praise the Lord the entire body with all of uh the furniture inside the board and everything is just a mechanic it needs a dynamic it needs a pouring for the engine to start praise the Lord the church will never knows his potential until we have a pouring yes are we together let's take one or two year uh you know and then and then we we we we kind of for close oh praise the Lord you love the Lord this morning amen I don't know what I took off my gloves for I just supposed to leave it on because I I really never did what I was supposed to do let's get back in the book of Jude and and and kind of for uh just just close here with with some few words Jude let's read verse 17 coming down I think I can close this now I've used all my time here musicians you can find your way up but beloved Remember The Words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you there should be markers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust this be they who separate themselves sensuously having not the spirit but yet beloved build up yourself on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keeping yourself in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ onto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and some have compassion making the difference and others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire sometimes we must preach like we are angry some have compassion some pull them out says what are you doing what are you doing brother bam says like saying John get out the road get out of there other save with fear pulling them out of the fire hting even the Garment spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and the Majesty Dominion power both now and ever amen you see what we are called to is his body the church is his body he's the one that paid the price for [Music] it such a responsibility that we we have to one another such a responsibility that we have to one [Music] another and if that reality can sink in you will have no reason taking an offense because maybe your brother said this to you or the sister says well you know this to you you take it in a good spirit and if the person is is really you wrong you can also tell them no that's that's not what I was doing then the person also will take it out of good Fai you see but when when we when we get to the place where we are all on the edge I have to be careful what what I tell this brother I have to be careful because you know people they quick to misunderstand people people yeah how we how are we getting ready for the rapture when we are running an an individual race you see it it it was going to be so easy that as soon as you get ready God just pick you up you go in the Rapture and this other person go tomorrow and the other person go tomorrow but God designed it because he's having a preeminence in the B and the B is his church the B is his bride because of that he's not going to take one person before another person there will without us are not complete the Old Testament Saints need us or the New Testament Church the Ephesian church that's the beginning of the Bride body they need us we need to come to that [Music] place then they will come out of the grave and we all will go together there is no first trip in a Rapture and last trip if you are just playing Church because you want to go on the last trip there is no last trip we all going together if you miss the first one you miss [Music] it that's the responsibility that is what we are called to that is the way that Christ will have his preeminence in his [Music] body I always say this people say salvation is an individual Affair you are not the individual it's not your Affair salvation is his affair he is the individual with the church we are AB body it's his affair he's the one that pay the price he's the one that call you he's the one that justify you he's the one that going to finish you it is his affair no salvation is an individual Affair so it's a selfish way to say it because you just want to be by [Music] yourself none of the body parts exist on their own cut it off it's dead it will rotten cut this finger off it will die by itself it needs the rest of the body to live that's the way the church [Music] is [Music] your Hope on things in 10

this series for a while and we're trying to close it up so uh I hope that we can close it up uh and then uh just trust and see but you know the one of the thing that bless my heart when I was studying on this and and trying to see how to narrow it down for our local assembly is just to see the many healing process that we have come through as a church praise the Lord to see where the Lord has took us from and where we are and to believe that he that has brought us the son of righteousness with healing in his ways praise the Lord he's able to make this church a glorious Church praise the Lord amen we having all of these little ones that we dedicated to the Lord if Jesus should T it there will be a generation of children that were born right in this building yeah that were dedicated to the Lord and they got married and they are raising their family that's what a church is it's a kingdom the kingdom of God Has Come to us where we can attach our values to the word that's how the kingdom is [Music] built that's why we fight for what is right and fight against what is wrong because it's not just for today it's not just for today you might get a job somewhere or get married and then move to another place the church remains yeah those doors are open they are people that going to walk in they don't have no idea what we believe they comes in they enjoy the song they enjoy the preaching the next Sunday they comes back the next Sunday they comes back they want to know what this is all about so it is not just the mov it's not just the moment every family have tsle even your tongue and teeth in the mouth they fight sometimes right you don't cut your tongue out and throw it away because you bite [Music] it every time you come to church on a Sunday morning or you come to church on a Wednesday night you are sewing a seed for a future generation yes that's what you are doing you are stamping your foot and said Lord we I'm planting the name of Jesus here that's what you are doing we all could take off let's just have service on Sunday let's let's get let's just get busy through the week let we should not have uh H prayer meeting we shouldn't have no uh uh Easter Service it's easy to do we can just find a reason give to one another I'm busy deacons I'm busy and I will not be in church on Wednesday night I have a work Lord my job is giving me a hard time how are we going to push the kingdom of God that way right when you just think that it's my church this church is not named after me right amen it's named after my father the Good Shepherd amen praise the Lord so I'm fighting for the father inheritance and I think is your father Also let's put our shoulder to the wheels praise the Lord I was thinking about this and let me let me see this and I close I me that's preach now I was thinking about you think about this we just went through couple of years with a riot in the city yeah some of the riots were right on this street yeah I was here every week and people would come and park their cars in the parking lot here you know what I did I would say to myself I said Lord I've never seen our parking lot feel like this I said Lord I I'm I'm claiming all of these parking spots amen I've been here all of these years I've never seen this parking lot it looks like we having a Revival they are going to Riot in my mind I'm seeing a [Music] Revival but
