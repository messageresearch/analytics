========================================
[Music] while our heads and hearts are bowed before God I I wonder how how many in here has a request that they'd like God to remember for just lifting up your hand now hold your request in your heart and eyes we pray Lord Jesus thou the the fountain inexhaustible Fountain of Life flow through us today Lord and cleanse us from all unbelief all sin that we might stand in thy presence now Hallelujah knowing that there is need Among Us that we know that we are sinners and not not worthy of any blessing but then when we think of him who came and took our sins and when his blood's there it's not it's not us in the presence of God it's him just our Voice through his blood his blood speaking oh God then cleanse our hearts from sin and unbelief give to us the desires of our heart for we we truly have these desires to serve you and in these weakening conditions and afflictions and things of the world that's put up on us sometime to perfect us we've been told that that he said think it not strange that these trials come they're only working out for our good and to perfect us and bring us into that place these great deserts of experience or a righteous man are molded into Saints yes we we thank thee for these experiences Lord we would no mean no wise want to uh do anything contrary to your will but we pray father that in this we be brought closer to you and when the burdens are so heavy we can't go no far then we raise our hands and scream to our father then hear from Heaven Lord Heal us make us well for the kingdom of God's sake bless Thy word this morning Lord Thy word is the truth and we've assembled here now the church we pray for brother Neville for brother caps and brother Collins and all the rest of the ministers and the and the trustees deacons and all the Le and the strangers in our gates oh God may this be a day that we'll long remember because of your presence we're here under great expectation this morning Lord just momentarily notice call together we feel that it's for a purpose may your purpose be achieved Lord for we ask it in Jesus name as as we submit ourselves amen glory to God it's Grand to be here and to uh be assembled with this church full of people I wasn't expecting to be hardly anyone here this morning because I didn't hardly know myself I was going to be here we just got in from Philadelphia and so I come in thinking I was going to have to go to Arizona right quick for have a funeral service for a friend of mine uh uh Captain Jim Mosley a very precious Godly boy led to Christ not long ago with three mosle brothers and um one of them fell was in the plane the other day and was killed instantly and laid in the fire for 10 hours before they got to him so Lee is 28 years old wife 26 and and leave three little children the oldest seven very sad and uh they when they got him in then they had to bury him the next day so I just I didn't get to go and I just wrote out or sent a telegram what I was going to say what I would have said at brother Moses's funeral and some these things we can't understand but yet uh he makes everything work just right we are here in service of the Lord this morning knowing that that that we believe God that we believe that he'll make everything just exactly right regardless of what it is and how it works out we know it's got to work for good he promised that it's just got to be that way sometimes we can't understand that gets very complicated at times but yet we know it is the truth because the Bible says it's a truth and the Bible to us is God and letter form amen now we've got to place our face somewhere and if if I any of us in life tried to make a success in life and become many times a multi-millionaire but what are we going to do with that we got to come down at the end of the road and what what good is it to us s and uh money is a a script it's an exchange but you can't exchange it for life only God has life so we we realize that we're here in a negative form and as long as there is a negative there has to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive see because it's because of the positive that makes the negative like you had a negative picture of some object there has to be an object somewhere or it to strike the Light Strike that lens or there wouldn't be any any negative so when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we're in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's reflected something here on Earth and we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere if that isn't I'm the worst deceived man in the world I've spent my life in vain but but I know beyond a shadow of doubt that it's there that's why we're here when I see you people come across the country on a few moments no and sometime presuming then it makes me feel real little when I come into a meeting like this to think that I know people here traveled for hundreds of miles just to be here for a few minutes of service just to sit here some woman just made a remark coming in the other day and said show me where the the man is walk and let me walk behind him upon the ground so I'll get well now if people believes you like that and you're representative of Christ then what should we do we should be very careful because you're not only destroying yourself as wrong you're destroying others who are following you so I know no denomination or nothing to take you to only one thing I have my faith in if you believe me follow what I tell you because I believe the Bible that's the word of God other things fail amen um he is life he is the word now I know that you when I come here I keep you long I pray to God when I felt like I want to come here today I've had so many interviews and calls and so forth I had to meet some of them this morning and I said well brother Neville no doubt asked me to speak and that was Friday and I said brother Neville will probably ask me to speak and what I do then I pray God so hot been so hot and he was good to send us the rain and break the real extreme heat give us a good morning this morning I pray that his goodness will shower each one of you all that you'll ever remember being here this morning may his grace and blessings be upon you bless not to visit a friend is sick brother Bill da I don't see him here this morning somehow oh here he is he's and I was thinking an old man of 91 years old and still storing across the the country through the deserts and over the snowy mountains and slick roads you don't have to do that God has been good to him he don't have to do that he could sit home and have Servants of fan him if he wanted to but something happened to build out he was borned again and when it was something come into his heart that all he lives for is to attend these services and then if I'm to be the mouthpiece of God would I deceive a friend I'd rather die and let me tell him exactly what's the truth out of this Bible then that's God's word I'm Miss repeating what he said now I want to read some out of the Bible before we U read I'd like to to say that I believe tonight is a communion night and and uh you who uh are here locally of course the other people will probably be going back to their homes because they have to go to work you who are locally here in the assembly remember the Brethren will be giv communion tonight now I'm waiting for uh the final call for Africa uh they would won't let me in as a missionary so the only way I can go in uh down I'm going to Kenya Uganda and Tanzania and the only way I can go in first the churches won't let you in CU they want me to preach something on this side and that side down in Africa I won't go in like that I wouldn't be hypocrite enough to do that so I either tell them no sir I'll just preach just what God puts on my heart and that's all see and I'm sure it won't be what they're trying to get me to teach so uh Triune baptisms and so forth like that and fussing with them no but I've been asked to a big convention by brother Bose he's just on the verge of coming to seeing some daylight of what we believe and so uh I've asked to come in like I was going on a hunting trip if they let me in like going in hunting if I get somebody to say they take me hunting then when I get in there the doctor the doctor's there at the ambassy is a personal friend of mine out of Chicago and as soon as I get in there he say well here's brother Ren over here let's have a meeting so after there the ambassy can't turn me down if me so they're trying to work it through now so I trust that if it's God's will it'll work out that way see it's just committed to him if not then I'll notify you I want if it be the will of God then I want to speak on the seven trumpets and that'll be about 8 day service and we won't be here at the Tabernacle perhaps we try to get an auditorium here I never thought of this new Auditorium just being built up here it's exactly where I saw Jesus the first time in Vision aitor built right over the same spot I went right there the day to L when I looked and see him looking towards the east you remember hearing me tell it when I was out there praying for my father um the little boy just a boy preacher that's where I saw him steep looking at him he just had his head turned sideways from me I kept walking around clearing my throat in a broom Sage field I kept watching and he never turned I called his name Jesus and he turned around held his arms out and that's all I remembered until daylight and so I come back out of the field on towards daylight so maybe the Lord let me preach those trumpets there wherever it is God's will be done turn in your Bibles now uh to Isaiah the 50 um 53rd chapter of Isaiah now we trust that God will bless our feeble effort are coming together this morning we just come down from Philadelphia where is at the Full Gospel business man's convention and um listening to their different testimonies and so forth up there then I on the road down I was Billy Paul and I and Rebecca and little Collins girl little Betty Collins and Billy is a very good sleeper and Beck is better and so uh Betty and I talked and she was sitting back with Becky in the back seat and uh I seen something on the road happen and when I did something struck me and Betty if she's here she noticed I quit talking started writing something down that's where I got this text for this morning now let us stand to our feet if we how we stand in honor of God's word as I read Isaiah the 53rd chapter who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed notice it's a question to begin with for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he has no Farm nor commonness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our grief and has carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the Chast of our peace was upon on him and with his stripes we were healed all we like sheep have gone astray we've turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid upon him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the trans transgressions of my people he was stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he has done no violence neither was there deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he put him to grief when thou shallal make his soul an offering for sin he shall seiz his seed and he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand and he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall many righteous servants be justified many for he shall bear their iniquity therefore I will divide him a portion with the great and shall divide the spars with the strong because he has poured out his Soul unto death and was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sins of many and made intercessions for the transgressors father God Thy word is a lamp uh the light that lights the path of every believer into the presence of God as it carries us like a lantern in our hand you have not provided enough that we should see the end from the beginning and but walk with faith but as a man would travel through a dark forest at night and that's where we are the light that he holds only provides step by step but the path though leading upward just walk with the light and may the light shine today upon the word to lead us one step further to the kingdom of God God for we ask it in Jesus name amen please seated the subject that I feel to speak to the congregation today is the Masterpiece it may seem rather strange to take a a scripture reading like this of a of one of the most bruised and murderous of pictures of the Bible that when the Bible says that this perfect servant that was afflicted and bruised and torn and yet take a text from that as Masterpiece very strange but I'm my mind is thinking this morning as uh we journey back I do for a few years I was invited up to far lawn and and California above Los Angeles my first purpose for going up there was to visit the the grave of of Amy simple mcferson the founder of the four square movement and I went to her her tomb and uh although I differ with the woman as a minister but yet in my heart I give admiration and respect for for what she stood for and the the hour and the persecution things she had to go through with and um and time of her being here on the earth and then for her her beloved Son which is a bosom friend of mine Roth mcferson and a group of ministers we went up there and they we didn't have time time to go in uh to the uh into the the place where they had the cremation and put the the bodies in a a little box on the side of the wall and in there they had some outstanding uh things such as the last supper and it's lighted by the actual light of the Sun and they have a shutter that it gives them when they go in it's light and then as as they begin to speak it darkens up and after while it all becomes dark and then the people go out and they have all the supper and the woman that helped the secret of how to beat this glass into this place while I make these pictures why it had come through a family for many years back and the art was just give it to the children and the last one was a woman and there was uh fixing this picture and uh when they went to mold and burn the the glass bake it of Judas iscar it busted so then they tried it again and it busted again and she said maybe our Lord doesn't want his enemy picture by his side and said if it burst again will not complete the picture but it helped that time then of course that was a striking thing and how that such things would happen but then one of the main things that interests me and Baron was Michelangelo's uh the great sculpture the the Monument of Moses it's a A reproduction there of course it isn't the original but it was such a a Great Masterpiece and as I stood and looked at I I like that something that looks like it's represents got something to it I like art real well I believe God is in art I believe God is in music I believe God is in nature God's everywhere and anything that's contrary to the original is a perversion God is in dancing not the kind of dancing you do here but when the Sons and Daughters of God are in the spirit of God that's dancing but uh like I had to contend with the 2:00 this morning up there in the lane uh that's the perversion of it but this masterpiece that Michelangelo had had made it uh it cost him something to do that that he was a great man and it cost a big part of his life because he was many many years and carving out just take a rock and Marvel and keep carving it and to see only the man the sculpture himself has in his mind what he's trying to do he he's the one you might walk up and say to him what are you pecking on that rock for to The Outsider who doesn't know what's in his heart uh it's nonsense but the the man the sculpture himself he he's got a A Vision in his mind what he's trying to make and he's trying to reproduce what he has on his mind in the form of a of a monument that's the reason he's digging it out of the rocks and this to do you have to start off right at the beginning and you have to follow the pattern see you can't get a little piece start off we'll make it this way no I believe no he's got to have a exact pattern and in his mind he's got that pattern and he cannot vary from that pattern now in order to do this he had to draw in his mind because we have no real pictures of Moses but he had to get a mental picture in his mind of exactly what Moses was now a genuine sculpture is inspired like a genuine poet or any genuine singer musician whatever it might be all real has to come by inspiration Michelangelo must have had the inspiration of what Moses really looked like and he caught it in his mind what Moses must have been so he set forth on this great piece of marble The Cutting to the pattern and bringing down and honing down until you got to the real picture of what uh uh it must have been in his mind and then when he got all so perfect ever corner off and every place rubbed and the eyes just right every hair and beard all just the way it was you stood off and looked at it I I think of of many many hard years of Labor and how he had to hold that same vision all the time in his mind of what he was going to do and this think that Vision on his mind for so many years to make it look just exactly to what it was he caught the vision first and how he had work to that Vision cutting off and making down and when he got it to where he perfected it it really got perfect he stood and looked at it when he finished up that morning with a hammer in his hand and he was so inspired when he looked at it because the vision of his mind was standing before him in reality what he had seen seen and his conception of what Moses was there was figured before him what he had in his heart all these years and toils and hours of sorrow and distress and critics and everything else but yet he stayed right with the vision until it was completed [Music] e
