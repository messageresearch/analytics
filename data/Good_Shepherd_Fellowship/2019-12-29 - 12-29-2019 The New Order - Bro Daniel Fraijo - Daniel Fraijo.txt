once again this morning me and my wife Karen will be flying out later today back to the back side of the desert when men are where men are roasted your men are frozen there they're roasted but nonetheless it god be with us who can be against us yeah this morning we just like to speak on a subject here and entitled it then you ordered the new ministry and prophets and priests in the law and prophets and priests no long if you'll turn with me in your Bibles thank you my brother and we'll read there in Matthew 11 beginning in verse 7 and once again to remind you that this this glorious book the Bible open to us in these last days a book written in Psalms a book written in Proverbs a book written in allegories and visions and metaphors and parables only to be known to us by revelation is the only way we can understand this book only the author can reveal it to you only the father can be your mentor in your tutor to bring you to this great revelation to to walk you to help you to let your fingers do the walking through the Bible pages and not just comparing Scripture with Scripture but God bringing a revelation and letting scriptures dovetail and merge together that our eyes might be open in Matthew 11 verse 7 it says and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went ye into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with a wind but what went ye out to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothing are in King's houses but what went you out to see a prophet a I say unto you and more than a prophet you may be seated as we approach the Scriptures we remember how the Ministry of the Son of man came in his first coming we remember him I could say it this way the style and and method that the Spirit revealed to us that how he would declare this book of redemption and in Matthew 13 34 speaking there in the Great Sea chapter the Bible great teaching Jesus was bringing as was all of them verse 34 he says all of these things spake Jesus unto the multitudes in parables and without a parable he spoke not unto them so remember that red letters on white paper Jesus speaking it's always a parable it there's a mystery hidden in that word of God that he's willing and ready to reveal to you if you're willing and ready to receive it he said and verse 35 Matthew he said that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet saying I will open my mouth in parables I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world so this morning as every morning that the Word of God would be open things are going to be uttered that have been kept secret since the foundation of the world here within the walls of this little building you will be hearing things that the world has read but never heard things that the world has seen and yet the eyes of their understanding have never been open but it's given to you this morning Matthew 11 9 says but what went ye out to see a prophet yea I say unto you and more than a prophet a change is prophesied in this prophetic ministry that aren't in truth there are into introduced Messiah the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Lamb of God a prophet is required and more than a prophet remember the prophetic ministry it isn't something that came to an end in the days of John the Baptist it's something that God spoke in a parable to confound the eyes of the wise and prudent and yet what took place was a change ohhow change is so difficult for us oh how turning a corner is so treacherous in the spiritual realm oh how we try to avoid it look we've never walked this way before oh but this morning put your hand in his hand this morning so what change is prophesied matthew 11 and 10 for this is Kiev whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee John had more than one ministerial gift a messenger to a new dispensation yeah quite quite a controversial subject in itself can a man have more than one ministerial gift and immediately well-studied been in the message said a prophet said he says he he says I am I an evangelist I'm not a prophet am i what am i I can't be both at the same time you can't mix ministries and yet God started me as an evangelist God did that God made him a pastor later God did that God made him apostille to the nation's God did that God made him a prophet to the bride of Jesus Christ God did that William Branham a man didn't want that to be that way Lord just let me do one little thing and but his was to be an example ministry he was more than a prophet he was a messenger to the aged he was an angel too loudly Seiya John had more than one ministerial gift a messenger to a new dispensation a forerunner to introduce Christ at his first coming a prophet to the nation of Israel in a time of great change not to bring them the law but to bring him the word made manifest to bring him the word flesh and to declare it to Israel you see Israel did not reject the law under rituals and the shadows Israel rejected the revealed Word that had been come flashing Matthew 11:11 says verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there are not risen or greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him and from the days of John the Baptist till now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force here in scripture of Matthew 11 was prophecy unfolding John came at the time of a overlap of Ages the last Jewish age Israel had seven Church ages look it up you'll find it I won't tell you at the last age and dispensation of Israel seven church ages and the beginning of the first dispensation the first church vision church age in that overlap comes a messenger of Prophet and more than a prophet John the baptism to introduce the first coming of Christ in that overlap the first seal opened and under that first seal come Jesus Christ come the Elijah ministry and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force as a young boy growing up in the Pentecostal denomination the pasta-like church the typical interpretation of what this was this is the sons of God and children of God taking the kingdom of God from the days of John the Baptist of the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force and yet Isaiah 53 was the Old Testament prophecy of the opening of the first seal speaking of Jesus as a twelve-year-old boy through the cross to the grave that he would be buried in and it's spoken of him the head of the church Jesus himself Isaiah said in their prophecy and in him is found no violence so now scripture crashes how can out his followers be violent when the founder himself in him is found no violence so this must be someone else you remembered revelation 6:1 and to open in the first seal that white horse rider with a bow in his hand and he came conquering and to conquer conquering and to conquer and here in John the Baptist in the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom I haven't suffered violence and the violent take it by force the first seal had been ripped off and the Son of man is standing present the Lamb the Lion of the tribe of Judah a great Redeemer Almighty God descended in flesh bringing to Israel an open book bring into Israel Redemption bringing the fig tree to redemption the firstborn and when the firstborn rejects the revealed word then who inherits a Gentile people it's given to the Gentiles the reveal word the word made flesh all happening here in Matthew 11 at the open in the first sealed Elisha comes on the scene and in the days of Elijah the first rider begins and the first seal is open and redemption is given to God's people and when Israel rejects it it's given to you and I and the consummation of the rejection is according to the prophecy and the allegory 4000 years before when Joseph brings his two sons to Jacob a blind old man it was the ritual in their custom and a proverb in Israel you take your sons to be blessed of the great patriarch and Joseph positions him because he realizes his father's not able to know which is which he said I'm gonna make this easy for the old guy he puts the eldest as his right hand the younger set his left and this blind old man goes to give the blessing and he crosses his hands hallelujah the blessing of the revealed word that came to Israel at the cross of Calvary was consummated it goes to a Gentile people now to you and I to give us hope to give us Redemption because he knew amongst all these Gentile people savages were the clothes on our back that down inside of their heart was a seed predestinated before the foundation of the world and that seed would grow through a character-building process called the three steps of grace and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Father adopting you and I through a personal experience with Jesus Christ taking us unto perfection a body change for our faith will quicken us translators changes by the power of the Holy Spirit rapturing faith a prophet says we hardly have faith for a headache we need faith to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Matthew 11 the opening of the first seal the beginning of the first rider it begins that day these scriptures were unfolding Matthew 1113 for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John in Luke 16 and 16 it reads again it says the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it and of course it has become a favorite scripture of many whose eyes are still beholden and they say you see after John no more prophets because the law and the prophets were until John no more prophets right nor just like they tell you jesus said be baptized in the name of the Father the Son of the Holy Ghost who better than Jesus to believe and yet it takes a revelation but what he spoke he spoke in a parable he spoke things to us that were hidden since the foundation of the world but all in a parable but to his children he's ready to take you aside anytime you ask him and say Lord what meaneth this and why did you speak in the parable no one understood it's that for them for its pleased me father I thank you that you've hidden these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed it unto babes as such as would learn the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it what was being preached was about to change no more law John had come at the end of the Jews seven church age but he was really a prophet of a new dispensation of a new message of the dawning of a new day he's introducing the Lamb of God not the shadow but the reality the man that God was looking for the man that the strong angel was looking for it he needed a man forehead to be a kinsman kin to you and I to do this work of redemption and when he found no men the angel of the cup in God and that form descended again he became the man he became the lamb he's introducing the Lamb of God he's to lay the foundation for the Lamb of God to minister perfection predestination the three steps of grace adoption serpent seed the seven seals John was laying a foundation for Jesus to do these things that he did Jesus preached breathe Jesus preach predestination Jesus preached a serpent seed it's in your Bibles Jesus preached the revelation of the seven seals a New Testament a 20th century prophet told us all these things it's all laying in the word preach the opening of the book according to revelations 5 all the mysteries of God hidden since the foundation of the world at the first coming of Christ it was all laid in the word like a great master builder like David laid all the materials for the building of the temple solemn Solomon gathered none of it Solomon had it assembled but David brought it all the artisans together to craft it that not a hammer would be heard in the house of God no sounds of works in the house of God no sounds of carrying to build something in the house of that it be a silent work it be a quick work a temple built maybe in about the space of a half hour in the message the evening messenger other man says east messenger had his message and the message in the messenger and it's most remarkable we found in the church age Istomin tonight we'll go back to the Old Testament and find that it's the same thing that God sends the messenger of that age at the end of time always at the end never at the beginning at the end so then you find wonderful people saying you see it must be very late because William Branham came at the end of laude Seiya something happened for some reason they stopped reading they they had to go to work there to go to school there to finish washing the dishes and they're happy to know this something they didn't know before but had they gone a few more minutes they would have read now as Luther's age faded out then Wesley came in and when Wesley sanctification faded out Pentecostal age come in it's always the messenger opens up the new message at the end of the old it's each page that that's been done we know that to be the truth so now more detail was added to a statement and now realized they come at the end but they come at the end of the previous age in the overlap as John the Baptist and Jesus come in the overlap between Jewish and Gentile ages Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever unchanging in all of his age one of the keys that was given to Peter that day Peter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock I'll build my church in Minneapolis and the gates of Hell will prevail against it the law and the prophets were until John and John was the beginning of a New Testament ministry a new message once again he came out of the wilderness but he never went back again like the prophets of old once he came out of the wilderness he stayed and he died amongst the people unlike the Old Testament wave prophets would rush in with thus sayeth the Lord bring judgment by the time you turned around they were gone they were gone Matthew 11:14 and if you will receive it this is Elias which was for to come not only had the message change John's ministry had changes in it he's Isaiah 40 he was Malachi 3 it was Luke 113 and 7 he was Malachi 4 5 and 6 a prophet as you hear the message and hear him speak you usually hear him say now Malachi 4 5 and 6 that wasn't John because you see when that one man comes the earth will be burnt up and he said that for many years 1961 in a message I believe called Messiah he said that he was back in Indiana and the Lord told him go back to that place that you called go back to that place there were you killed the squirrels he says I'm gonna speak so that went back I back in that area you wait on God half hour past and mourn finally the Holy Spirit spoke to him and revealed to him that Malachi four five and six was both first and second coming and that John had fulfilled the first part a prophet just three four years from his ministry ending and God had just opened that to him he must have held it back for a reason and then revealed it to him in his latter years perhaps it was to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it unto babes such as would learn those who would go looking into the Word of God those who have before them messages 1200 messengers to teach us a lesson that if it's one scripture or one quote slow down don't run with the message yet seek you first the face of God see if there's any changes see if there's any corners that have been turned because it's not a mistake it's God it's God once again in the Ministry of a son of man speaking in Proverbs and parables to his people to hide it to give it just to you Isaiah 40 in one has comfort he comfort my people say if your God speak you comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she have received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins o unlikely message for an Old Testament prophet but for a prophet of a new covenant for a prophet no longer no longer under the Lord no more in the enemies club we now have faith for our victory we can move mountains speak to me comfortably to Jerusalem John cry unto her tell her her warfare is accomplished redemption is here salvation is here the Holy Ghost is here the born-again experience is here her iniquity is pardoned for she has received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins the voice of him that cry in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord that when he comes he can speak better things to you than what the blood of abel spoke he can speak to you through the blood of Christ a blood that can wash your sins away a blood that can make you a new creature in Christ I say a 14 verse 5 and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed so the time of John's coming as a prophet was also a time of great revelation so time when God would be revealing great things to his people a glory of the Lord shall be real all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it this was one fold of his ministry John the voice of God in his day no one else in the day of this revealing it if you rejected John you'd probably reject Jesus Malachi 3:1 to behold I'll send my messenger John again scripture dovetailing with scripture adding more detail to the Ministry of this man and if it was so then wouldn't it be so today behold I'll send my messenger he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of Hosts it was a time of a great change and a promise Malachi speaking of this coming of this forerunner of this Elijah ministry of this messenger who would forerun make away before the Lord Himself can it says and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple that temple was a spoken word seed in the womb of a virgin hidden in a prophetic parable of the messenger and Christ himself and how he would come and where he would come to he'd have a temple prepared for him now one made with hands but a spoken word temple that the fullness of the Godhead deed of deity would he come down descended and abide in and grow now God had a man that would take him at his word Malachi 3:3 and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord and offering in righteousness because prior to his coming the sons of Levi were no longer doing this they were wrapped up in one of the biggest denominations only Rome was more powerful than them and yet they United together to crucify him that day on Calvary and he had come to purify them they hold the second fold of this new ministry no more under the law Luke 1 in 13 but the angel said unto him speaking to Zechariah you all remember the story of Zechariah and Elizabeth in the Book of Luke and verse 13 he says but the angel said unto them fear not Zechariah for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb the beginning of a new ministry the beginning of a new protocol for Ministers the beginning of a new prophetic ministry introducing Christ even his natural birth had to be a certain way even him Gabriel said don't drink don't smoke don't defile your body John because when you get older I have a work for you to do but Lord I'm still in the womb I said when you get older Johnny when you get older I said anybody been there before in the womb and yet God was then speaking to you when you get older I've got a work for you to do in Minneapolis where he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb see the order of the new ministry so they can take the head of every home by example into the same ministry a postal prophet bastard evangelist teacher Deacon Sunday school teacher you've got something to do in this great plan of redemption you play an important part each and every one from the smallest the youngest to the oldest and most people what wants to give you your own testimony to be a witness for him verse 16 of Saint Luke chapter 1 and many of the children of Israel he shall turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord Gabriel was connecting the dots now Gabriel had just connected John to the prophecy of Malachi and that he would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the hearts of the children to the father's know first coming of Christ the first forerunner the first Elijah so 1 comma makes the difference in prophecy to be fulfilled more than 2,000 years apart and yet it's thus saith the Lord it's coming it's spoken he said it it's going to happen for you and I and he opened their eyes to see things passed so their eyes can be open to see things present to see he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm changing in all his ways angel Gabriel was quoting the spoken word of God that Israel only knew as the writings of the Prophet Malachi I don't know if Gabriel could even read being an angel but he didn't know he didn't have to because he got it lip to hear yes do you need to be an angel to get it lip to hear or let me remember did it ever happen to a human being on the face of the earth yeah ha ha and if it happened once could it happen again and it happened in the past could it happen this morning Oh Matthew 11:15 either had ears to hear let him hear but we're on to shall I liken this generation it is like unto children sit in the markets and calling them to their fellows saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have mourned unto you you have not demented you see the children of this world will find fault in every thing you do then they said we piped unto you you haven't danced okay so with more than Q now and you haven't lamented you people stand solid like the Rock of Gibraltar I don't get it because there's something within us that's holding all the song said there's something within me I just can't explain but there's something within us a seed sown growing unto the statue of a perfect man the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a gluttonous man a wine-bibber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified of her children the children of God need the wisdom of God so that you won't follow a man but you'll follow the man yes God has a fivefold ministry but due respect every one of them don't follow the man at the end of the Jewish Ages there was a promise of a new ministry to introduce and forerun the coming of Christ Isaiah 7:14 Scripture well-known to us it says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and call his name Immanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know how to refuse the evil and choose the good there it is a principle for you as a mom and dad raising your children someone might tell you those kids nett need to go out and sow a few Wild Oats and get that out of their system it's a lie of the devil the truth is see them butter and honey of the word raise up a child in the way he should go and when he gets older he'll refuse the evil and choose the good that's been sown in his heart for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace not the Prince of violence at the opening of the first seal at the first coming of Christ there they stood both again in the Ministry of John it brings up peace and the Prince of violence the white horse rider in Jesus Christ the Lamb of God Isaiah 53 all of these Old Testament prophecies are the Old Testament prophecies of the opening of the first seal yet we didn't know him as such but we do now there was redemption it was a book being opened it was a time of Revelation Isaiah 53 starts like this who have believed the message of the hour who had believed our report that's a message and to whom is this revelation given of this message of this hour of the revealed Word Isaiah 40 and 5 was a time of revealing who read it Isaiah 53 a time of revealing both speaking at the same time revelations 5 and 5 to 70 is the same time a time of revealing revelation 6 is a time of the book being opened by Jesus himself scripture dubbed daily details coming together to open the eyes of our understanding as Paul spoke microfiber and to speaking of the same time even the prophets of old didn't know what they were saying even John as he was given the visions of the book of Revelation couldn't wrap his mind around what he was seen but thou Bethlehem Ephrathah though thou be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel whose going forth have been from old from everlasting but the scripture speaks of this prophetic ministry there was introduced Messiah King of the Jews Lion of the tribe of Judah Luke 167th says this speaking on John Zechariah and his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied prophesied saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he has visited and redeemed his people once again a time of revealing the opening of the word a book being opened seven seals being loosed we sometimes think no stop a minute that's 1963 oh no he wasn't William Branham and opened the book it was Jesus Christ it was the Lamb of God William Branham only brought us the revelation to tell us it's open so much controversy and God once again sent a prophet to tell us it's open and as you read from 1963 after he preached the seals and he keeps telling us it won't be a public affair he's lining up scriptures when asked about revelations 8:1 the seventh seal he says that's what revelations tens all about so all of a sudden took revelations 8:1 with no detail connects it to revelations 10 now he's added eleven verses of detail to the 7cm and he goes on like this till 1964 in feast of the trumpets we who believe it's open by the things he said he makes a statement and as he's talking our paragraph 167 he says oh and the Seventh Seal hasn't been open yet and the brother that you've been with opposing sides on immediately your phone rings what do you think of that quote for the Daniel I said well if he said it I like it if you said I like it then I hang up the phone I go to digging buh-bye buh-bye quote and seven months to the day in 1965 a message called marriage and divorce if that one means anything to you he says all seven seals are open that's why we have today the mysteries of marriage and divorce and Surrency predestination - er change fate for a rapture and the following three or four messages continues to say it's open the word reveal it's open the word revealed so the question is what in the world did he have in July of 65 and he still white didn't have in December of 64 a revelation he's a prophet he told us God don't tell his prophets everything Jess what he wants him to know and what he wants him to say and when he wants him to say it once again the message the Ministry of a sin of men in total control of the Ministry of the Son of Man and he's making him speak in Proverbs like Jesus of Nazareth get the first coming now the revealed words being written in the second coming as it wasn't the first and he's showing us it will not be an explanation it must be a revelation it must be revealed to you you must see it with the eyes of your understanding you must hear it with your heart Luke 169 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David as he spoke by his holy prophets which had been since the world began now we know where this prophetic ministry began Zechariah anointed of the holy ghost says as he spake them by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began this is the divinely revealed mystery truth God ordained the prophetic ministry since the world began Adam Abel Enoch no what the list goes on it had a beginning that's where it's at and there was a reason for it that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us there are reasons for the prophetic ministry to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy Covenant that wasn't always the reason there was a time when the reason was so she could take vengeance an eye for an eye in a tooth for a tooth oh but we received a new covenant oh the love of God that come down that day yes that entered his temple into a little body they thought when he was born he was just another little Jewish boy but it was God the Prophet said Mary was just an incubator that neither the man had anything to do with this birth or the woman Mary I say that this little body formed in Mary's womb wasn't even connected by an umbilical cord to Mary no connection I'm saying I told my wife happening she said you're losing it boy that's impossible well she loves me tremendously I love her and I said we'll think about how the seed got placed there and now ask yourself is it impossible spoken into existence a seed totally Dermot eyes both sperm and egg out of the womb out of this what we call oxygen and air come from the mind of God through a spoken word and placed in a little girl of Mary he wasn't Jew he wasn't Gentile he was the Lamb of God without spot he couldn't be attached in any way to this human race but he had to be a man to be a kinsman but he had to be born without spot without wrinkle for he would give his life a ransom for you and me and the great thing is God would accept the price he paid a price he paid for you when I was yet a far-off like the prodigal son he saw me and he loved me how far drunk drugs jail far off in the miry clay and there he loved you because he looked beyond this flesh body he looked beyond this sinful nature and he saw down inside a seat a spoken-word seat could it be anything less could you be anything less than him a spoken word see that to the revealed word and a character-building process you'll come forth as gold you'll come to the beat of stature of a perfect man Jesus Christ that we should be saved from our enemies by this new prophetic ministry and from the hand of all that hate us to perform the mercy promised to our fathers to remember his holy Covenant the oath which he sware to our father Abraham so a prophet must introduce Messiah where was God's provided way and through a mist God affirms the purpose of the prophetic ministry first we know by scripture prophets have been since the world began Genesis now in the middle of the book is called the Bible is a prophet called Amos and the name is 3/6 it says shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be people in the city and the LORD hath not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveal his his secrets to his servants the prophets the lion have roared who will not fear the Lord God had spoken who can but prophesy John the Baptist was that prophet that was to unfold loose reveal who is he that's a manual King of the Jews the Lion of the tribe of Judah the greatest secret ever revealed from the mind of God Christ the mystery of God revealed because it was Jesus of Nazareth the line of the tribe of Judah who would open the book and loose the seals that's the prophetic word in Revelations 5:5 so a fine gentleman told me for the Daniel who william branham did not open all the seals in 1963 i said you're absolutely right he goes like hello my talking to the same Daniel I said yeah yeah I'm listening I am a listener see he did not said that's correct absolute correct he did well I thought I've heard you preach you did again you're correct absolutely correct twice already that's what I like about you one more you're gonna hit it right out of the park I don't know but let me share this with you William Branham didn't open the seal 1963 because that happened over 2,000 years ago Jesus himself behold the line of the tribe of Judah will open the book and loose the seven seals around but he spoke at all in parables and what we receive in this in this 20 century problem the son of man with a son of man in his control is received the revelation upon disrupt I'll build my church I will give my church the revelation of things past things present things future but this book of revelations is all but almost a book of history and that prophecy it's a prophet saying there's little to come to pass he's waiting on you and he's waiting on me as Paul said until our obedience is complete think on that it's closing Isaiah 40 Isaiah 53 Malachi 3 Malachi 4 it was a time of revealing the first coming of Christ it is a time of revealing again at the second coming living in the last few moments what God is doing or what he is doing is hinging on you and I are going out of here is it hinging on Israel she's in her over her redemption her receiving this son of men in the street and how soon is hinging on you and I this morning how long will we make those poor folks wait 144,000 how long will we make them wait till we get into the world and become the word Christ in us the hope of glory for if the mind that was in Christ being you it will quicken these mortal bodies took 167 Amos six three six and seven a prophet let's introduce Messiah because it's God's weight and it must be more than a prophet because it's a time of restoration of both the fig tree and the bride tree prophets from the beginning Amos once again tells us the importance of the prophetic ministry blessed be the Lord God of Israel who had visited and redeemed his people and has raised up a tent horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which he have been since the world began God didn't change his mind about his word Luke 176 says and now child shall be called the prophet of the highest for thou shalt go be the four from the face of the Lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our God were by the Dayspring from on high hath visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace all this isn't an old scripture out of the New Testament this is thus saith the Lord even for you this mornin it says and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the desert till the day of his showing him to Israel John was the prophet a forerunner the only voice of God assuring a new age a new testament if you rejected John you probably reject it when you reject the prophetic ministry you reject all the benefits it's designed to give you Hebrews 7 11 hostile Paul if they're poor perfection or by the Levitical priesthood for under it the people receive the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek and that be called after the order of Aaron no need no reason for the priesthood being changed there is made a necessity a change also the Lord also of the message has been given to the people that's why under a denomination you can never come to the fullness of the stature of a perfect man but they still have you under the law of creeds and dogmas and rituals you're bound up in a system a prison house as Israel was when Jesus come to Israel he said how often watch the imagery here how often have I as a hand tries to gather her brood and you would not so the here here's Jehovah hen in the chicken yard of organized religion declaring their status and he lowers himself to that image to open our eyes so we can ask our question where am I could I be an eagle in a henhouse and he's calling me up higher well the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also the law so here whom these things are spoken pertaining to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar for his evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood and is yet far it did far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek there arises another priest who has made done after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life that's what we want to share with you not a carnal commandment but everlasting life for he testified thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek for this merit for there is barely a dissing Ellen of the commandment matter of fact all ten of them thou shalt not kill ain't good enough for the bride of Jesus Christ anymore no do you say well what's wrong with that should not kill sounds pretty good to me not for you in whom dwells the Spirit of God in the seat of God he has called you to the next level it has been said by them of old thou shalt not kill he didn't say thus saith the Lord I told you back then no he said it has been said by them of all it's a proverb thou shalt not kill but I say unto you I the living word either manifested words either reveal words I the fountain of life there is a fountain in the house of David better stable this morning to you oh I sent you if you're angry against your brother without a cost bang you got him already you have heard it said by them of old doubt shall not commit adultery sounds like good advice but not for you not for me God's taking us asked the Bride of Christ his sons in his daughters those in whom lays the seed that was spoken a gene was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world thou shalt not commit adultery it's to lowest standard for you to live a night too low too loose now he says if you even look upon a woman to lust after in your heart you have pull the trigger as my brother-in-law just to tell me from Austria Germany this ain't high school no more boy we're going to a higher level a songwriter said the refiners fire has now become my heart's desire and every time it pulls me in I don't know cuz it's burning everything that isn't him redemption is here salvation is here overcoming power is here some on my tape but the Daniel I'm sorry I can't do that guess what blessed are the poor in spirit that have given up and say I can't do that blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God and blessed are the poor in spirit who will give him full control all controlled all surrendered all let it go let God the revealed word Hebrew 719 for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God the revealed word the open book preaching perfection a more excellent way this change in ministry and message Luke 16 and 16 along the prophets or until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it John was a prophetic ministry under the order of Melchizedek a priesthood that spoke perfection and relationship restored when did he preach that when he stood on the banks of the Jordan and he told his people that were following him he baptizes Jesus washes the sacrifice and said behold the lamb of God that taketh away taken away your sins your doubts your sickness a priesthood that's both perfection relationship and storm tutorship begins mentorship begins under this ministry fellowship begins you're a son and a daughter in a process of adoption going unto perfection a body change now Jonah there's a fella he was thrown off a ship because he was headed the wrong direction God has a way of turning us around but he wasn't the first Adam was the first to be thrown out of a ship and more than one Adam lost his fellowship Adam lost his rulership Adam lost his mentorship Adam was tossed off the old ship of Zion with no hope to return and yet he was a son being adopted he was a spoken word son he was a man taken from his theophany and placed in a body of flesh he was a man on the seventh day being tutored by the father himself he was a man that had spoke the animals into existence when he named him preaching in Paris many years ago a man sitting right about where brother bloody was heard me say that and his head starts going Oh Adam didn't speak in on he said said he called him by name and his head wouldn't stop large congregation of people the same some God I said I understand and realize some of you are struggling for that statement please let me back up from that now how about have I told you that Adam just spoke a few squirrels into existence would that help Adam lost his fellowship fell from the highest fellowship a man could have with God felt from a time that God was teaching him how to handle the spoken word be a creator speak worlds into existence a principle in the Bible no matter how high we think we've gone we're never too high that we think we can't fall from that place prophet postal teacher before God says Devils got a punch coming at you keep that spot covered proper was talking to an old gentleman but the bosworth all-time Pentecostal man damn said brother Bosworth gave dignity and honour to the Pentecostal movement green man of God Bosworth the past one time by the Brenham you know what Fellowship is he says well I think I do by the browser and he waited for brother Bosworth answer brother balls versus yeah it's two fellows in one she said Oh May the one in our ship be the master of the sea with whom were having a constant unbroken fellowship by a grace of God the law and the prophets were until John and John was the new order the first amongst many to come that would be known as the fifl Ministry of Jesus Christ no more under the law a new prophetic ministry the fivefold ministry was the Ministry of Jesus Christ Paul did not invent it all didn't see it as a good way to keep the church in order had nothing to do with all it had to do with the revelation that Paul caught of the Ministry of Jesus Christ in Matthew 4 12 to 25 Jesus is the itinerant Atlanta evangelist with a healing ministry brain for the sake in acts 3 22 to 26 Peter said by the mouth for the prophet Moses God has given to us the LORD thy God shall raise up a prophet like and done to me Jesus the prophet in Hebrews three one two three Apostle Paul says the chief apostle Jesus Christ Evangelos profit apostille in Saint John three Jesus goes to a man called Nicodemus and Nicodemus under that anointing tells me we know that thou art a teacher come from God teacher apostille prophet evangelist Peter in 1st Peter 5 winter for he said Jesus Christ the chief Shepherd of the flock and to use a religious explanation of joy bingo there it is the FIFO ministy in Jesus Christ that's where I come from that's what he gave those are the gifts what do you set that on high that he gave unto us here once again for the perfection for the Saints to help this body of Christ to give their lives a willing sacrifice to be servants to the people Hebrews 7 11 if therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood for under the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should arise in the order after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron well the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law what was the change a new order a new priesthood no more prophets under the law for the law and the prophets or until John but now a new order of prophets a new order apostle's a new order of pastors and teachers and evangelists and they must have the Holy Ghost or they don't qualify to be part of this Melchizedek ministry for if not they'll never preach perfection and place it at the reach of every son and daughter of God worked for a fine man he belongs to church called Church of the valley or something to some mega church thousands of members worked in his home and got to talk to him about the Word of God he says Dan I sense you lean towards a Calvinist side just a little bit I told them I sense you're correct I said that's correct yeah that perfection such as its it doesn't mean perfection she's we can never be perfect I said Burt you're absolutely right but through Jesus Christ we can be none of ourselves not perfection as an a master mechanic that feels he knows all not perfection as some artisan carpenter not perfection in any of those ways no this is different this is sons and daughters to being adopted to a character building process and the perfection is a consummation of rapturing faith and a body change that's the perfection the FIFO ministry must place the promises have to reach the people we must place modesty holiness at the reach of our sons and daughters we must place fidelity at the reach of our married couples we must place forgiveness at those were torn by sin a new ministry with no law but love no Creed but Christ no book but the Bible Matthew 23 Jesus speaking he says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the cellars of the righteous and they say if we had been in the days of our Father we had not been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore you be witnesses unto yourselves that you're the children of them which killed the prophets and today you witness to people and say I believe in the prophets Isaiah and Amos all that but the law and the prophets were till John they say see no more what in the world do we tell them that we know prophets were since the beginning the scripture tells us who know prophets continued throughout half the Bible Amos tells us of vindicates till the prophetic ministry Jesus speaking to the scribes and Pharisees he says in Matthew 23:33 he serpents ye generation of vipers how can you escape the damnation of Hell he brings into this statement the parable of serpent seed and then in verse 34 Jesus long after John has been beheaded long after John is off the scene Jesus says this to them wherefore behold I send unto you prophets long after John is gone and wise men and scribes and some of them you shall kill and crucify some of them you shall scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city but nonetheless I'm establishing in this New Testament church I'm establishing from this day on then I'm unchanging in all my ways why I established in Genesis well I said Amos to sake now I say it myself in this body of Jesus of Nazareth I will continue to send you a prophetic ministry I will have a fivefold ministry for the perfecting of the church but I alone will bring you revelation through this ministry that no man might glory but then all the glory should be to Jesus the musicians come forward this morning jesus said behold I send into profits long after John had been killed Jesus ascending on your ministry now there was preach perfection jesus said in Matthew 5:48 be he therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so what was the first 47 verses of Matthew 5:48 about the attributes and characteristics of your perfection in mind we're going back to Eden we're going back to Eden and he's taking the hidden word that was sealed and he's opening the book to you and revealing himself revealing his desire revealing speaking to you things that Adam alone had once heard Adam heard and say in Genesis one time Adam the works that I do you shall do also but you'll be different than Adam in this 21st century because you'll do the greater works reign in the knee shall you do for I go to the Father for the saints of all the ages wait on you and I because they understand in that 60 mention beyond the curtain of time that day
