========================================

[Music] for [Music] for [Music] when God prove what he would do and said what he would do and prove what he would do then they turned around and called this man an evil spirit which cursed them all think of what taking place think of what caused them their training caused them not to recognize the very word made flesh for their day the very train that they had in their schools with the very best of teachers and you say well we wouldn't do that today there teachers were far Supreme to ours today Superior to our teachers and they failed they didn't have 996 different organizations as we have today they had about three and in the Three Bottle down to three and none of the three we recognized it this goes to show that What man does is foolishness to God now they fail to recognize it now and they do the same thing again man intention is good it always is good and man never changes his posture he never changes his ways much I'm I'm talking to the man of the world man is always praising God religious man for what he done and always pointing people to what he's going to do and then ignoring what he's doing see that's just man he's made that way he's always been that way and you Bible readers tonight know that that's according to the word right they're always praising God for what he has done saying what he will do and ignoring what he's doing that's just the habit of man the reason that they had did this the teachers to my opinion now they had interpreted the word because they all believed in a coming Messiah all Israel believed it they do yet today but the reason that they didn't recognize him his message wasn't according to their ecclesiastical fit they uh there the interpretation that they had of the word the Messiah never manifested himself in the way that they had interpreted that he would do it so and therefore they did not recognize him because it didn't fit their interpretation as I've said before and say again God doesn't need anybody to interpret his word he is his own interpreter now the Bible says let me prove to you now that that is the truth Isaiah the prophet 715 years before this happened Isaiah the prophet said a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a child there's no doubt that everyone in that age thought their daughter would be that woman because Isaiah said it but you see it was 700 years later but when God didn't need anybody to interpret his word when he'll do it or how he would do it he said he would do it and he did it God promised that he over in Isaiah also I believe the 28th chapter about the 18th verse and also in Joel 228 that in the last days the last 2,000 years he had pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh he said your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young young man shall see Visions your old man shall dream dreams and the things that he would do Isaiah said with stammer lips and other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest but they wouldn't hear it they waged their heads and walked by it he said all the tables of God would become full of vomit and there would be nothing clean and if that isn't a picture of Jerusalem and the Church of that day at the coming Messiah it's a picture today the same same it's just repeating itself now when God says he'll do a thing he did it regardless of what anybody else thinks about what anybody says when God speaks to something he's Duty bound to interpret that word himself and his in Vindication of the word is his own interpretation notice vindicating his messiah's message he promised what the Messiah would do when he come and when he came even when the wise men in the East had looked down south Westward from where they were at in babyin and they saw a majestic star did you know there's not a speck of History nowhere that any Observatory where they even kept the the uh the time by stars great man who studied these Stars there's not no history says that any of them seen that star at all why it wasn't given to them they wasn't looking for such but these wise men know that there would be a star of Jacob R and they were looking for it and it passed from the time that Jesus was born in Bethlehem now I know our Christian Traditions it's just like our churches it has things Topsy turby you go out here and you see wise men coming to worship a baby there's not such a thing in the scripture two years later they got there coming down through the Plains and across the Tigers River they never come to worship an infant but a young child about two years old why was it at the same time Herod slew all the children from two years old under that he might catch the Messiah you see they God had Vindicated by his word and when these wise men came to Jerusalem the star LED them to the religious capital of the world Jerusalem and as soon as they entered those Gates that star the supernatural that had led them refused to show them anymore up and down the streets These Fine Man rich man with fine great camels and so forth up and down the streets saying worries is born King of the Jews we saw his star in the east and that great religious Capal after two years of the shepherd's message still didn't have the answer and know nothing about it amen the head of all the denominations amen didn't have the answer so it Disturbed the Sanhedrin and they call for the scribes to come read and they read Micah's story The Prophet which said thou Bethlehem art thou not the least of all the princes of Judah the least but out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel and after the scriptures being being read and still being Vindicated Before Their Eyes they still didn't accept it though the scriptures said so I doubt very much they would today if the scriptures that's promised for this day will be made manifest I may never preach to you again but I want you to get this still they wouldn't believe the great wisdom of the father makes man wisdom so foolish that he belittles the man he actually comes to the place to work makes man feel so ashamed of himself and he's not big enough to admit that he's wrong he still stays with this story no matter how much the father proves that his word is true and he's doing just what he promised to do man thinks his wisdom is so Superior to God if it don't come according to him is wisdom why It Isn't So Am that's true in every age still does it see how fitting the whole matter was now what inspiration to those herdsmen the Angels coming down to speak to herdsmen angels of God coming to speak to a bunch of shepherds I wonder if you ever had the privilege of of talking with a she Shepherd are being with one a while if you would I I don't like to say it because of my uh remark I'm fixing to say after a while but the shepherd stays with the Sheep so much until he even laughs like the Sheep blatant he talks like the sheep and he smells like the Sheep that's right because he's with the Sheep that's all he knows is his sheep now the Vindicated word of Truth when these Shepherds humble uneducated man what an honor how fitting it is to a Shepherd to receive a message of a newborn sheep am it could come to nothing else but a Shepherd that's why it was born in a stable and not in a house sheep are not born in a house or in a pink decorated hospital room see they are born in the barn in the fields that's the reason he was led to calary you can't not make a sheep Walk The Gang way to the slaughter did you know that in the slaughter yards they have a goat that leads the sheep and when he gets up to where the killing place is he jumps out and lets the Sheep go on a sheep has to be led he can't lead himself so therefore it had to be the shepherd coming for the his sheep when they found the god baby exactly where the messenger said he would be and when they found this mess message of the messenger in the manger exactly where the angel said it would be now I heard people say an angel spoke to me he said thus and thus how ridiculous sometime I've heard people say that an angel spoke to them and told him thus and thus which was absolutely contrary to the word now How Could An Angel do that it just couldn't be and if God told you a certain certain thing would happen you say he told you that and it doesn't happen then it wasn't God speaking to you just remember that's right God doesn't lie he's not found in a lie when they found the baby what a joy it must have been to them because the angel that gave them the message they found it just exactly the way the angel said it would be and just in the place where the angel said it would be what a thing that must have been to him in a Manger why see how it ease these herdsman was in the stable why do you think a theologian would have been in there it put a pin over his nose and said get me out of this place he would have been so out of place he' been in misery but you see it was just at home to the shepherd praise the Lord God knows where to send his message just exactly right and this state the Shepherds was in then in their stable with their lamb a Vindicated message that they had heard how beautiful in the presence of the Messiah Vindicated word of their message when the Shepherds heard that the Messiah was on Earth and came into his presence right in their own environment and found the message to be true was Vindicated there how that must have made those men Fe to find that God had done this great thing for them while Scholars would have been so out of place there under such circumstances and they had all left right quick why the messengers coming to Common herdsman maybe they could have not even these some of these herdsman might not have even been able to have sign their own name very doubtful you know the herdsman that Jesus chose when he was here on Earth the her his sheep lovest thou me Peter more than these yay Lord thou knowest I love thee feed my sheep and the Bible said that Peter was an ignorant and unlearned man still choosing Shepherd the church members of those past days and priest well trained Society in that day would have been so out of place in a stable now I'm not quite sure that many of you could understand maybe you citt people what a judian stable smelt like what it look like as the animals in that stable and what it would have been why some of these Classics of the day would be so out of place there they they wouldn't even enter the door amen but it pleased God am by his infinite wisdom to reveal it to such as would receive it the scholars and wise men of that day would certainly would not have received it they had been so humiliated to be caught in such a place why the first place if they would have went back to their church and would have witnessed that they tended such a meeting and believed a bunch of uneducated Shepherds bringing such a phenomena they had have been excommunicated from their church that have been thrown out of the society of Bethlehem if they have been caught listening to such an unlearned bunch of people as these Shepherds were humiliated they certainly would have been if they had been associated with such common people and being un accepting such heresies as to believe that God would bring his message to an uneducated bunch of shepherds when they had everything all prepared for it they would have lost their affiliation they' have had to give in their papers and would not have been able to have been uh uh recognized among the Society of their groups of that day because they had associated with such a thing and not with a better mind how dare you the priest would have said you come into my Sanctuary here with such a heresy with such a foolishness that some unlearned Bushman out there that doesn't didn't go to through the prer and would believe such a message that an angel come down and spoke to him but what if the man would said I saw his message Vindicated amen he had said let me quickly give you your papers and get out of this Society times change but people don't it would have probably happened again today they would have been thr out of their churches but the Shepherds felt completely at ease in that place with God's lamb and any good shepherd does the same thing when a Good Shepherd over the sheep can see the word of God made plain and Vindicated of what he promised to do that Shepherd's right at home I don't care what anybody else says there's God promised it and God did it they say the days of Miracles is passed there's no such a thing as the baptism of the spirit there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was for the apostles but let a true Shepherd of the word preach it in the power of the Resurrection that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Peter said on the day of Pentecost the promises un you and your children and to them as far off even as as many as the Lord Our God shall call wherever he calls a promise and the same blessing is true and let a genuine word feeding Shepherd see that Vindicated all the theologians in the world can't take it away from him because he know God said so and it happens that's all it's just God's word always his word was made flesh and was dwelling among them and they knew would not he promised the same thing in this day I wonder if we would recognize him the proud and wise had never received such a thing as that and they believed if there was such a thing as the Messiah on Earth it would certainly have to come to their denomination amen it would be their group would receive it or it wasn't right am now just think right hard if it ain't in their group then did you notice then God never chose any out of their group but he chose that who wasn't connected with any of it because one group had said you see what we did and they do the same today but God chooses the nobody that's the reason he chose the shepherd the Shepherds was completely at home with the god lamb in their midst his word made flesh among them the proud and wise never received it pass by we could say as much for today or in any age it was the same things in the days of Martin Luther same thing in the days of John Wesley is the same things in the days of the Pentecostals but God stops for No Man's organization he moves his Spirit right on to vindicate his word would have to be and come in the class to their own Council or they wouldn't receive it as they're so head strong today all the churches that they're going to do such and such and unite all the churches together if they're looking for a messenger now who can unite all the Protestants Catholics and Orthodox everything together and make one great church our brethren I've had the privilege of preaching to hundreds of different religions and there's good man in all of them but now you remember I am prophesying every organization will have to accept this or not be an organization it's forcing him did you read the Tucson paper today or a Catholic priest help ordaining in the paper ardain in Missouri a Protestant clergyman and who was a recognized in it Presbyterians Baptists Lutheran and Assemblies of God it's in the Tucson paper today oh it's shocking it's not the man in there it's them ecclesiastical governmental heads that twist the thing in there the system that throws you into it whether you want to or not you can no longer be an organization and escape this wrath that's coming up the Earth and you see if that isn't right I may be gone when it happens look back on one of these tapes then if it wasn't I'm a false witness if it was I've told the truth they would have called it some kind of a working of an evil spirit against their positive thinking you're so much today about positive thinking and just put your mind on anything and think positive positive on it the devil can do that there's only one thing that's rules over all and that's God's word if you're thinking contrary to the word forget your thinking think on the word Messiah they thought would not be found in such a place a mess as that could you imagine a fine great high priest or clergyman all Polished in theology would come down to a stable full of manure and accept the message of a poor humble Shepherd that had no education and would come say see I can prove it to you this is the baby this is the messenger and you know what them people have said the man is honest he's very sincere in what he's saying but he's absolutely wrong I've seen people live such good lives until people wouldn't believe couldn't say nothing about him but they say he's sincerely wrong he just doesn't know what he's talking about God he wouldn't do such a thing as that but here they have the evidence and after the evidence go up there at the stable and see if that baby isn't laying there they' say you've been by be but some evil spirit that's caused you to say such yet it was according to the word of God and they were too blind to see it because their theology had blinded them what a tragedy caught in such a place in such a mess as this was in a stable when they had a beautiful place for him to come they had everything fixed for him to come and then them to think that he would come down and go and not bring their teachers the message and would give it to a bunch of unlearned Shepherds and then bring his own son and have him born in a a stable a common Livery stable well in in a Manger of hay why it couldn't be so they wouldn't believe it because it was so humble and it's so simple that's how the wise always overlooks it it's so simple it confounds them they look for a god way out there when he's right here they're looking for something way Yonder when it's right here with them now Christ risen from the dead the same yesterday today and forever all their great things was bypassed but it sure was the truth that there was a messiah we know it today we believe it today we kep it today but then if God promised something for this Christmas promis something for this day and proves that it's so and we still walk away from it we're just in the same class thing was back there at that day that bypassed it because it don't does not come in our denominational taste that's why we're such a mess this Christmas Jesus Christ is not dead he's alive he's here to today amen the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever he said in St John 14:12 he that believeth on me not he that makes believe he that says he believes he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and More Than This shall he do because I go to the father and I've seen him in my own life do more of the same works that he did then than it's written in the pages of this Bible amen and he goes over the top of the head and the wise today and revealed to babes such as we'll learn that Jesus prayed for it is true he's done more than he I've seen in my day of my 33 years of ministry I've seen him do more than I have read of him doing in the Bible more of the same thing that no matter what he did then do you think the srin believ him well they said you're Bewitched but find out where they made their mistakes was to find out and finding out not what their Creed said but what the word said Messiah would do in their day there's where we make the mistake today not searching the scriptures Jesus told them search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me they tell you who I am notice God forew they would do this that's just why he had to take it to Shepherds he knew knew they wouldn't do it they wouldn't receive it now do you see why it had to be Shepherds why Shepherds theologians wouldn't receive it why Shepherds again would it come contrary to his word no they were shepherds they know sheep and that's what he was born a sheep a lamb notice he was the lamb they were they were the only kind that would accept him a Shepherd was the only thing would accept the lamb they know how to take care of it and so is it today when we get the Lamb's message now striking the most humblest uneducated man adoring Emmanuel in a stable the most and there were people out there at the same days teaching their theology great crowds drawing everywhere from all over the land they come to sacrifices which Jehovah said was a stench in his nostrils and here was humbled shephers in a stable adoring Emmanuel God himself made flesh and land in a stable see how we with our great learnings and our head sticking back like we know something and God bypasses the whole thing he does what he promises to do and he always does that but think of these lowly Shepherds out there now adoring a Emmanuel in a stable it's most striking sure is then out after they had adored him and realized [Music]
