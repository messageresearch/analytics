thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] to show the Airing church this day that is Hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today and forever Barkley promised another to come flying from the wilderness amen that's exactly the truth how fitting and matching it is to Luke 17 30 for the son of man Eagle will be repeating itself to bring to not all other worship places such as denominations and so forth God chose His Place John said There It Is and then we're promised the same thing in this day Malachi 4 to turn the hearts of the children back to say that he's not dead these things are not for another age baptism in Jesus name is not for back there but he's now the same right hey man to bring to know all other places of worship that's what the last day Eagle is to do to show that all the rest of it is foolishness the nomination is folly but to part them again with the same sign that he did that he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah also in Revelations 4 7 we had four beasts have we just been through with the first one was before I find out was the line that was the first Beast that went forth to meet the challenge of that day the lion of the tribe of Judah after him come the next beast and we find out the next Beast was an ox which is a beast of burden a sacrifice and the days of the Roman Cathedral the church died out sacrifice the next come was a mat was a beast with a face of a man and that man was reformers man's education Theology and so forth but the last Beast that was to fly the last Feast that was to come the Bible said it was a flying eagle [Applause] Hallelujah and the prophet said in this day it shall be life oh my God in that day there will be light there's been a day of reformers there's been a day that's just a shadow can you call day or night but in the evening time in the eagle time it shall be lied about Eagle time the path to Glory you'll surely find and the Waterway is a life today buried in the precious name of Jesus young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely baptize you in part of the evening lights have come it is a fact that God in Christ Our one and then it shall be like about the evening time God's only chosen place to worship oh what's this message come to you what's he going to do and in his day it shall be light at the evening time and why to welcome his children back home to the true Promised Land by the same sign of the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through the wilderness God's chosen place to worship Him Jesus Christ that's the only place there is That's The Only Name God has for salvation that's what his name the family in heaven what it's on Earth is Jesus Christ old church old people sinner friend don't trusting nothing else but Jesus Christ don't trust in any preacher don't trust in anybody else to save you trust not in any church any Creed any denomination trust only in Jesus Christ for he is the light of the hour let us bow our heads thank you it shall be light about the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find in the Waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the evening lights have come it is the facts that God in Christ are one oh brother sister if you haven't repented yet if you haven't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ would you make that start tonight would you give God the opportunity to welcome you into the place where you can worship him remember outside of there there is no place that God promised to meet you and welcome your worship you say brother Bram I worship this is sincere so did King he made every kind of an offering that Abel did but it was a wrong offering you might go to church and pay your tithes and do your duty as a Christian altude just as sincere as any man or woman I stood here now for some 30 years around the city here and screened this same message I'm getting old I can't be with you too much longer but remember in the day of judgment my voice is recorded they'll speak out against you there's only one place that God puts his name and that's not in a church but in Jesus there's only one place of worship only one place that you are received and that is in the Beloved Jesus Christ there's not another name under Heaven given among men whereby be saved no church no Creed no nothing Jesus Christ and that's supposed to be the message of the hour to restore back the hearts of the children back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints won't you accept it tonight and while we have our heads bound and those who like to be remembered in prayer would you just raise your hands we can't make an older call because it's just two men God bless you my on my left I guess he's 300 now to my right would you raise your hand say I want to be remembered I guess he's 150 or more on my right we have a tabernacle down here with a big pool of water Pastor fine Pastor brother Armin Neville Associates these men around here that you see in me every day every night every hour people that wants to be baptized that's repented it's always waiting and if you obey that commandment you are sure by a promise of God of your sincere in your heart to receive the baptism the Holy Ghost there's only one place of worship now that isn't in the Tabernacle that's in Christ how do we get into him by one Spirit we're all baptized into this one body let us pray Dear God as these hands went up they signified what was beneath that hand in the heart a conviction that they are sure they need help from you I pray for each of them Father I'm going to quote your word you said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come to the Judgment but passed from Death unto life father just being gone from the city a few weeks come back asked about this one why they're gone oh what about they're gone dear God one by one we are called one by one we have to meet the challenge to walk down through the valley of the shadow of death and it's due to every one of us as Marvels but tonight you have offered us your petition that if we would believe on him and be baptized in his name that you would take us in and then in this body the body of Christ not in the church but in the body of Christ that body has already been judged it will not have to come to judgment God poured out his wrath upon that body and that body is free from sin and being in him puts us free from sin by his atonement that died for us and in there we have fellowship with one another while the blood of Jesus Christ God's son and keeps us clean from all sin and defilement father God I pray that you'll take each of them into your kingdom granted God May there not be a one of them lost May there be not a boy or girl man or woman Lord some of my own people sitting here tonight that's out from under that blood how well I can remember my daddy's words and I pray Dear God that none of them will be lost granted Lord I'm believing you now with all that I have to believe with [Music] move up all my brothers sisters my friends Uranus place tonight now under by the phone several different states listening in all the way from the east coast to the West I pray dear God Way Down the Cross of desert sand Tucson way over in California up in Nevada and Idaho way over in the East and around down in Texas well this invitation is given people setting it in little churches filling stations homes listening in oh God made that lost man or woman boy or girl at this hour come to thee ran it just now we asked it in Jesus name that they'll find this safety place while it is time when we see the handwriting on the wall the Earth getting nervous the time of Deliverance is at hand part of our nation's sinking the other part rolling and bursting with earthquakes as Jesus promise would be let it not be too long for them Lord may they accept it now for we present them to you as trophies of the meeting of the Gospel in Jesus name amen do you believe him God bless you how many believes that's a truth to my left raise your hand coming to the right raise your hand God bless you as far as I see everyone that's truth friends God knows that's true now while in him being in him you have access to everything he died for and what did he die for he was wounded for our transgressions bruise for our iniquity the chastim is our peace was up on him and with his stripes we were healed do you believe that you're believing his atonement for healing now is there any sick among us let them raise your hands right or left great crowds of sickness I can't call the line you see I haven't I can't come up on the platform there's no way of doing it they're having prayer meetings out in the other places for the sick and the churches and things down the Tabernacle I'm going to ask you something how many Believers is there raise your hand all right I'm going to quote to you the word which is Christ Jesus likes commission to the world and to the church brother he said this these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover how many knows that's true Mark 16 say Amen all right I'm asking you as a Believer to lay hands on somebody in front of you just lay your hands over on somebody in front of you unless each one pray a prayer for each other now put your hands over on somebody around Lord here before me is a box of handkerchiefs little pieces of goods some old mother Lane some were dying a baby near death sick people everywhere we read in a Bible that detect from the body of Paul handkerchiefs and aprons and they were placed upon the sick and evil spirits and unclean spirits and sicknesses and diseases departed from the people now Lord we know we're not Saint Paul but we know that you still remain Jesus the only God provided place of worship and now today these people has confessed their same faith as believing like those people did surely you have made a way for them and I put my hands upon these handkerchiefs and asked that the diseases and afflictions leave the bodies of the people these will be laid on in the name of Jesus Christ now we are taught that as Israel was coming out of Egypt in the line of duty they were on the road to the promised land the Red Sea got in their way and God looked down to the pillar of fire and the Sea got scared rolled back and let Israel pass to the promised land oh god look down through the blood of Jesus tonight and may the sickness roll back and Satan be cast out and may the people pass to that promise of good health and strength that God set up of all things I wish you would prosper in hell now as you see Lord Jesus the hands of these people laying on each other they're symbolizing their faith that you said these signs shall follow them that believe they're praying in their own way for one another the next person's praying for them now Lord this challenge has been met that Satan the big Bluff he has no right to hold a child of God he is a defeated being Jesus Christ the only place of worship the only true name defeated him at Calvary and we claim his blood right now that he defeated every sickness ever disease and uh call for Satan to lead this audience in the name of Jesus
