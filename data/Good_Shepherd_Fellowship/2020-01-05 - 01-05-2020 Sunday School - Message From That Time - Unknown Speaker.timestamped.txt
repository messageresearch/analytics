[0:37] as Russia will follow the United States
[0:40] this coming Sunday night at 12 o'clock
[0:43] to say many predicted Pearl Harbor
[0:45] they're not putting it out cause people
[0:48] go Frannie I don't believe it now
[0:52] because he can't suffer atomic war one
[0:55] of there's pastors a sound mayor this
[0:57] way we'll throw in that way in the world
[0:59] we'll go to pieces something's got to
[1:00] happen yet before Jesus comes that's
[1:03] right
[1:05] for instance the young married couple
[1:09] there was a certain time that they got
[1:12] married and they they put their bowels
[1:15] together and they pledged one to another
[1:19] their loyalty and they said that we will
[1:24] love honor and cherish each other as
[1:28] long as we both live but there come a
[1:35] time that something happened all these
[1:41] things are there's a time when something
[1:45] happens and maybe all their vows and all
[1:49] the leagues of Nations and so forth
[1:51] maybe had good intentions
[1:54] but they all come to an end all become
[2:01] crumbling beneath the feet of man with
[2:08] all the good intentions we can have or
[2:11] almost come to nyan but there is a time
[2:17] that word man can come to something
[2:22] that's eternal that's one on man the
[2:27] time man meets God that's when something
[2:33] happens that eternal
[2:37] we do our mistakes and we make our vows
[2:41] on New Year's nights only break them the
[2:44] next day we turn new pages and we assign
[2:49] fouls and we go to priests we don't but
[2:53] Catholics do it make confessions and
[2:56] sign pledges and we come to the altar
[2:59] turn new pages for our baby for the next
[3:07] time somebody crosses our path or
[3:09] something
[3:09] that old tip reply right back again
[3:12] every time that we get into trouble or
[3:15] something it'll happen again
[3:18] but there is a place where a man can
[3:21] come to a time that will change him
[3:25] forever he that will come to me I will
[3:31] in no wise cast out said Jesus a man can
[3:36] come to God and his whole eternal
[3:40] destination is changed and a man to meet
[3:45] God and he can never be the same anymore
[3:48] you can't meet God in there to remain
[3:51] the same person you are if you turn away
[3:55] from him you'll be a worse person than
[3:57] you ever were if you receive him you got
[4:00] eternal life and you'll raise you up at
[4:04] the last day by his promise
[4:07] there was a time when there was a man
[4:10] called Abraham who come down out of the
[4:14] Chaldeans and he dwelt in the city of
[4:18] aira
[4:19] and he was just a man a good man perhaps
[4:24] maybe he might Oh
[4:25] his father perhaps worshiped idols cause
[4:28] he come from Babylon and he was just an
[4:32] ordinary man and he was getting old he
[4:35] was 75 and his wife was 65 I am Abraham
[4:41] one day when he was perhaps out in the
[4:45] field hunting or whatever he was doing
[4:47] picking berries or whatever his job
[4:50] he met God and from that time he was
[4:55] changed he could call things that was
[5:00] not as though they were because he had
[5:03] met God he is no that minute in the hour
[5:06] that he met God it changed him and God
[5:11] called him to be the father of many
[5:14] nations and believe God and believe his
[5:18] prize the cauchy and met God 25 years
[5:24] later they were discussing trying to
[5:28] disgust him telling me he believed
[5:30] something was wrong but the Bible said
[5:33] he got stronger all the time giving
[5:35] praise to God because he knows that God
[5:38] had to keep the problem that's when a
[5:42] man meets God it changes his makeup it
[5:45] gives him a super sense does I speaking
[5:49] the other night the natural man only has
[5:51] the five senses but the believer when he
[5:54] meets God he gets something different
[5:57] it's a super-sensitive lift him up above
[6:00] the shadows
[6:01] it makes him believe things that's
[6:04] impossible to come to pass he still
[6:07] believes they will come to pass because
[6:09] God said so when a man meets God
[6:15] something takes place that was a time
[6:19] when a man have been trained and all the
[6:22] wisdom all the theology of the word of
[6:26] God he noted by the letter he been
[6:29] school he had all the degrees he was so
[6:32] smart until he could teach the Egyptian
[6:35] scholars and their teachers he's no
[6:40] letter but a coward with it that was run
[6:46] and went out the backside of the desert
[6:48] and was herding sheep for a stranger but
[6:52] there come a time that one God made
[6:55] there in the burning bush and from
[6:58] how Moses was changed because he met God
[7:03] in a burning bush I faced the face of
[7:07] God he couldn't be the same anymore when
[7:10] on man or woman I don't care how many
[7:12] vows you make er how many new pages you
[7:15] turn I'll tell you these God you can't
[7:18] be changed but when you want to meet God
[7:20] then you're changed forever didn't only
[7:24] change Moses it changed Israel a change
[7:29] easier and changed the world at that
[7:32] time they called one man that God had
[7:36] talking about his word
[7:38] what we need today is somebody to meet
[7:41] God face to face and talk to a bad
[7:45] situation
[7:47] one man meet God things are changed
[7:52] certainly that's the only way that we
[7:55] can have things and from that time on
[7:58] Moses a coward Moses is the one that was
[8:02] rotten has been changed and from that
[8:05] time he become the servant of the Lord
[8:08] it always works that way when a man
[8:12] meets God things are changed that was a
[8:17] little girl one time not only eighteen
[8:20] years older maybe not that old that was
[8:23] on a road to well one morning to get a
[8:25] bucket of water down in Nazareth she was
[8:29] a nice little girl she believed she had
[8:33] pain but that morning she met God God
[8:40] told her something and she believed it
[8:44] and it changed the whole course of life
[8:47] for the woman
[8:48] make sure tomorrow oh yeah her name was
[8:52] Mary the mother of our Lord Jesus the
[8:58] little lady was just an ordinary little
[9:00] girl but she met God and from that time
[9:04] on something happened certainly that was
[9:10] a man mother
[9:11] name of Peter an old rugged fisherman
[9:15] probably just as rough as they could
[9:18] come and he was happy a great big who
[9:23] shut up bully because here's some time
[9:26] ago I seen the play called the big
[9:29] fisherman not what was a very good
[9:31] description off Peter because he was
[9:35] such a big old rugged fella he didn't
[9:38] care for nothing he didn't believe
[9:41] hardly anything but one day he met God
[9:45] and from that time he was changed from
[9:50] that time he become an apostle of the
[9:54] Lord Jesus Christ as brother David du
[9:58] plessis what's telling us a while ago
[10:01] about the Saul of Tarsus our murderer
[10:04] who helped to coat all the murders that
[10:08] and witness and give witness to the
[10:10] death of Stephens the martyr yet letters
[10:14] in his pockets that go down to the the
[10:17] head councils of the churches and rest
[10:20] the people that were making too much
[10:22] noise shouting and praising God he was a
[10:28] great man in the side of the Pharisees
[10:31] he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees but
[10:35] one day he was on his road to Damascus
[10:38] and he met God
[10:41] I like shouting around him I'm from that
[10:47] time home he was no more solvent but it
[10:52] was Paul the humble one the meat one
[10:56] because he met God and it changed him I
[11:04] was a leper laying at the gate all the
[11:09] remedies of the medicine could not heal
[11:12] him his beautified sores had gotten so
[11:17] great
[11:18] till his hands
[11:19] beyond raising up any more any speeding
[11:23] Harley dragon his case is hopeless
[11:29] but he met God one day coming out the
[11:34] gate and he fell down in worship is that
[11:36] if thou will doubt and make me clean and
[11:39] he said I will be thou clean and from
[11:44] that power he didn't had more leprosy
[11:48] because he met God there was a blind man
[11:54] sitting by the side of the road and he
[11:59] could not see the daylight from dark
[12:02] there was nothing could help him one day
[12:06] someone come walking out of the city of
[12:09] Jericho and we met God I'm from that
[12:15] time he could see his sight come to him
[12:19] the side of light had broke into his
[12:21] eyes and he could see again because from
[12:24] that time when he met Jesus he was a
[12:28] different man he had his sight one of
[12:31] the person me God something happens
[12:35] definitely there was a young man one
[12:39] time no doubt a good citizen of the
[12:43] country but spell was come on and he was
[12:48] so bad till the prison house couldn't
[12:51] hold him up and they bound him with
[12:54] chains and he had a lesion of devil did
[12:57] he break the chains and free himself and
[13:01] the Devils drove him to a graveyard
[13:04] where he stayed in there took the slabs
[13:07] and just don't need you to cut his
[13:09] ownself
[13:09] oh he was a terrible fella well those
[13:13] spells are leaving no doubt he'd think
[13:15] what am I doing here and about that time
[13:17] that Devils had come to him again and
[13:20] cutting and tearing but one day he met
[13:26] Jesus
[13:27] and from that time on the maniac of
[13:33] getting ahead is not right mine told me
[13:37] at his feet he could go back home as a
[13:42] gentleman he could return to
[13:44] civilization he could go back to his
[13:47] loved ones he could say from that time
[13:51] I've been changed yes
[13:56] one day yonder on Calvary when God and
[14:01] death met face to face when life and
[14:04] death come together but that's when live
[14:09] Christ pull the Stinger out of death
[14:12] [Music]
[14:14] since that time death hasn't had no
[14:17] stinger in it I'm so glad of that
[14:20] [Music]
[14:24] gasping God met together death hasn't
[14:28] been the same
[14:30] it ain't gonna worst angered you it down
[14:34] the Christian believer can walk right
[14:37] into its phases at home yep where is
[14:39] your stinger
[14:41] grave where is your victory why are they
[14:45] both met God they haven't been the same
[14:49] since then no man can be the same
[14:53] nothing can be the same when it was
[14:56] meets God you won't ever be the same I
[15:02] can remember laying on the hospital bed
[15:06] the doctors give me three minutes to
[15:08] live my heart beating 17 times to the
[15:12] minute God
[15:17] [Applause]
[15:18] since then I haven't been the same
[15:21] something happened to me no one can tell
[15:26] me any different something comment I've
[15:35] never been the same since that minute I
[15:37] met him he changed me
[15:40] he made me something different it wasn't
[15:44] taking a new years down but I met God
[15:49] many women when you ve got your changed
[15:54] we make our New Year vows like go back
[15:57] tomorrow morning to break him next day
[16:00] to break under what we need to do it's
[16:02] not a new year bother we need to come
[16:04] face to face with boss he was an old man
[16:13] one time and he couldn't make up his
[16:16] mind the devil kept beat him out of it
[16:20] one day out in the field I knelt down to
[16:22] pray while he was praying he drove down
[16:25] a stop he said let this be my sake
[16:29] if you ever come to me again I want you
[16:33] to this stop I'll tell you that right
[16:37] here I met God that it was settled from
[16:40] your own that's what we need maybe not a
[16:44] stop in a few home but somewhere some
[16:48] secret closet someplace not it Oh
[16:53] tonight there will be hundreds of hours
[16:55] taken thousands of them taken and next
[17:00] year we'll have to take them all over
[17:01] again we are saying we'll quit lines of
[17:04] good do
[17:05] we'll lay aside our tipper will do more
[17:08] for God will do this or that the other
[17:10] only the pilots in vain
[17:12] what man needs to do tonight is come
[17:15] face to face with God and from down he's
[17:19] a changed creature how I could tell it
[17:26] in a way that I believe it well when a
[17:29] man meets God he changed from that
[17:32] minute the rest of his day he'll never
[17:34] be the same because he's got eternal -
[17:37] he's a new creature old things have
[17:41] passed away and all things have become
[17:43] new to him he looks new
[17:46] the sick man can walk in the face of God
[17:48] one of the doctors who said he was going
[17:50] to die but he can walk in the face of
[17:53] God and plead his case and he'll come
[17:55] away and from that time on oh I remember
[18:01] congressman Upshaw sitting in a
[18:04] wheelchair for 66 years that matter in
[18:07] California when the Holy Spirit come
[18:09] down and begin to speak he met God and
[18:12] from that out he could walk without his
[18:14] crutches I've seen the time where cancer
[18:20] eaten people laid with nothing but a
[18:22] shadow and the doctors had passed by and
[18:25] said their dog their loved ones gather
[18:28] in to say the last words as they could
[18:30] to the encouragement but they faced God
[18:32] and from that time on they were changed
[18:36] they live differently I can see the foul
[18:39] woman your honor on the street I can see
[18:41] the drunkard down an alley I can see the
[18:44] hypocrite dollar in the church all those
[18:46] different kinds of people each new year
[18:49] turning a new sheet and trying to do
[18:52] something different
[18:53] trying to make restitution to do so
[18:55] forth let them meet God one time and
[18:59] from then on Jesus preached to those
[19:04] from then on that said in the regions of
[19:06] the shadow death and I say tonight if a
[19:10] man wants to have a real change come on
[19:12] in let him come face to face with God a
[19:15] medium one time then you could say from
[19:17] there
[19:18] from that time on I was a changed man
[19:23] I know by experience in a little while
[19:26] the church will be gathering here around
[19:28] the altar
[19:29] you'll be consecrating your lives anew
[19:32] you'll be giving up things and laying
[19:34] things on the altar rather let me give
[19:37] you some advice
[19:38] if you've never met God face to face let
[19:41] me tell you something you stay at that
[19:43] altar just stay there until you meet God
[19:49] then you can port your fingers back to
[19:51] that New Year night not say I've turned
[19:53] a new page
[19:54] I made a new vow but from that time on I
[19:58] met God and lifeless change and things
[20:01] were different and everything becomes
[20:03] new chilly again from that time on the
[20:07] time that you meet God it ain't meet a
[20:10] new year we're gonna face it in a few
[20:13] minutes after all about two and a half
[20:15] hours are supposed maybe less than that
[20:17] we'll be meeting our new year face to
[20:20] face
[20:21] we'll meet it with vowels we'll meet it
[20:23] with pledges we'll meet it with good
[20:25] intention we'll meet it say we'll try to
[20:28] turn a new page we'll try to do
[20:30] different that's all good
[20:32] I appreciate that brother it'll never be
[20:35] turtle I'll tell you to meet God first
[20:37] when you meet God first and from then on
[20:41] everything will be different
[20:44] let us pray when we bow our heads
[21:00] praise the Lord yeah I was just waiting
[21:04] for the prayer I think there was a
[21:07] little miscalculation day I asked for
[21:11] the last five minutes to introduce a
[21:13] subject and I think that was where all
[21:16] this happened
[21:17] I'll just waiting next week God willing
[21:22] we'll be starting a new topic I know we
[21:27] got through with the prayer last the
[21:30] very last week or so of December in the
[21:33] week before the last and before the year
[21:37] even ended I think probably 3-4 months
[21:39] to the end of the year I was thinking of
[21:41] the redemption plan of God but for some
[21:44] reason this came in so hard and I just
[21:47] put it on the Shelf so we are going to
[21:50] talk about tithing we are going to talk
[21:54] about tithing God willing I know when it
[21:58] comes to money Marez is almost like a
[22:03] no-go area people people don't feel very
[22:08] comfortable when we are talking about
[22:11] money issues in church it's not to maybe
[22:17] show who is paying tight and who is not
[22:20] paying tight I am not even in a position
[22:22] to know who preached that and who
[22:24] doesn't
[22:24] probably it rather steve is doing it
[22:27] that's a different thing
[22:28] why rather one is doing it that is a
[22:30] different thing but I don't know who
[22:32] paid tax and who doesn't so be rest
[22:34] assured you wouldn't feel bad and yeah
[22:41] so we just have to talk about it you
[22:46] know we don't talk about things because
[22:48] it's within our comfort zone that
[22:52] doesn't help us in any way so we are
[22:57] going to talk about tithing
[22:58] God willing next week it's not only for
[23:02] the waking brothers if you intend to
[23:06] wake is also for you and even if you
[23:09] decide you are never going to wake is
[23:10] also for you bill
[23:13] you can never tell when somebody one day
[23:16] hand you a hundred times a hundred
[23:18] thousand dollar check for deciding not
[23:23] to wake so um it's all for is for every
[23:27] one of us and it's a very good and I
[23:30] think and there is just a little secret
[23:33] someone which i think is very very
[23:38] important for us to know it's not just
[23:41] about pee in tights you can pay ties
[23:45] every single paycheck or every every end
[23:50] in you make you can be so diligent and
[23:52] so up to the task and still you will not
[23:56] be blessed why because there are rules
[24:00] to every game there is something very
[24:04] very small as small as it may be I think
[24:08] that carries the whole blessing and I
[24:11] think it will help us if we all come and
[24:15] then just see which will God leaves us
[24:18] so just be praying for it remember me in
[24:25] prayer and then God willing next Sunday
[24:30] is a very short topic probably three
[24:32] four Sundays we'll be done with it I'm
[24:36] not sure because most of the times I
[24:38] start something and then just keep
[24:39] coming and then that time yes by this
[24:43] time I'm trusting that maybe in three
[24:45] four weeks we'll be done with this and
[24:47] it's very very important tied in don't
[24:50] forget
[24:51] god bless you
