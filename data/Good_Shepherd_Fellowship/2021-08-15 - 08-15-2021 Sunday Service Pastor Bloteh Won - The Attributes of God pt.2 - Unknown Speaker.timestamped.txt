[27:09] hey god bless you brother
[27:13] god bless your sins
[27:15] good to see you brother good to see you
[27:16] tomorrow amen
[27:19] i have a little testimony
[27:21] uh it's probably a little less than two
[27:24] weeks now
[27:26] i was sitting
[27:28] joshua and myself
[27:30] and gas field
[27:31] all the way down
[27:33] uh just sitting in the living room
[27:36] and um i just said
[27:40] that the world has come to an end
[27:43] and that
[27:45] any time it will be over
[27:49] and joshua said yes it's true
[27:52] i said there is nothing in this life
[27:55] worth living for
[27:57] i said but what the devil is going to do
[28:00] he is going to just get people
[28:04] into technology
[28:06] into things
[28:08] just
[28:09] create an impression or let people
[28:11] create the impression
[28:12] that this world has
[28:14] another million years ago
[28:18] meanwhile the world is actually at the
[28:21] verge of collapse
[28:23] so we're just talking and probably for
[28:26] up to 10 minutes i can't go into all
[28:28] that we have no time and then
[28:31] all of a sudden i realized
[28:33] emmanuel was not in our midst
[28:36] so i said what is emmanuel they say he's
[28:38] upstairs
[28:39] and you know how children of these days
[28:41] are so addicted to technology
[28:43] so i said you know what go see what he's
[28:45] doing
[28:46] they went and called him down i said
[28:48] what were you doing he said i was
[28:49] writing i said no i don't believe it
[28:55] i said you were playing a game he said
[28:56] no i was writing i said gas will go to
[28:59] his room and bring his laptop
[29:01] so the one thing they brought it down
[29:05] and
[29:06] lo and behold
[29:08] what we were sitting down talking about
[29:10] he was upstairs
[29:12] typing it
[29:14] and this is the heading
[29:16] the end time is near
[29:18] now there are three paragraphs i'm just
[29:20] reading the first one
[29:23] what i want to talk on
[29:26] is the end time is here
[29:29] if there is any time to change it's now
[29:32] if you are reading your bible and
[29:34] praying keep doing that because that's
[29:38] what gets you closer to god
[29:41] but if
[29:43] if you are not
[29:45] now is the time to start
[29:48] so when we saw it in fact
[29:51] we were just blown away
[29:53] that what we were sitting down talking
[29:54] about he was in his room
[29:57] and he was typing the same thing
[29:58] upstairs
[30:00] so um he went and printed this i didn't
[30:03] ask him to
[30:04] and i didn't even know why he printed it
[30:06] until this morning when i asked for a
[30:08] copy
[30:09] then i knew why he went and printed it
[30:11] praise be to god
[30:13] and then joshua goes to work
[30:16] the following day
[30:19] and a friend who trained me
[30:22] i mean he's older than i am
[30:25] and then he came to joshua and told
[30:27] joshua
[30:28] are you prepared and joshua said prepare
[30:31] for what
[30:33] and he told joshua he said that the
[30:34] world is ending are you prepared
[30:39] and joshua said he was just blown away
[30:40] because we just talked about this the
[30:42] previous night
[30:44] and and joshua asked him so do you
[30:47] believe that then he said yes he like if
[30:49] you believe that why are you cussing so
[30:50] much
[30:53] then the guy said so oh so if you're a
[30:56] christian you don't curse and joshua
[30:58] said no you make the problem worse
[31:02] and the guy said then i have a long list
[31:05] and joshua says see that see that see
[31:07] that see what he was talking about he
[31:08] has a long list
[31:10] i said but the man is confessing to you
[31:11] what he has to do
[31:13] i said that is the spirit the age we are
[31:15] living in that people have a long list
[31:18] and they don't know they have a long
[31:19] list
[31:20] but if somebody has a long list and they
[31:22] know they have a long list it's a
[31:24] blessing
[31:26] i say you know what
[31:27] there are people
[31:30] that sit in church and they hear the
[31:32] word of god every day
[31:34] and they don't know they have a long
[31:36] list
[31:38] it's good to know you have a long list
[31:41] it's only bad
[31:42] not to do anything about it
[31:46] so
[31:48] are the amounts of two or three
[31:49] witnesses
[31:51] praise be to god this is not by
[31:54] coincidence and if it was coincidence
[31:57] then i want to know what the white
[31:58] coincidence actually means
[32:01] praise be to god god bless you since one
[32:03] of these days it will be all over
[32:08] [Applause]
[32:18] [Music]

[51:27] amen
[51:29] praise the lord
[51:33] amen
[51:38] let's turn to exodus chapter 15
[51:42] exodus chapter 15.
[51:48] wednesday night we we started to talk a
[51:50] little bit on the
[51:53] um
[51:54] the attributes of god
[51:56] which of course it might take us
[51:59] the rest of time that we have on earth
[52:02] in order of integrity
[52:04] for us to exhaust that subject
[52:07] so i'm not even going to try
[52:11] i'm not even going to try there was
[52:13] something that caught
[52:14] our mind and that was the reason why
[52:17] we decided to pick up a little bit on it
[52:20] so
[52:22] exodus chapter
[52:27] 15.
[52:38] i would read verse 11
[52:40] exodus 15
[52:42] 03 verse 11.
[52:46] this was mosaic
[52:48] moses sung
[52:49] the
[52:51] uh
[52:53] john said in in the book of revelation
[52:55] they signed the song of moses and
[52:58] lamb this was
[53:01] moses son his son right after
[53:04] the
[53:05] experience with the rescue verse 11 who
[53:08] is like on today
[53:10] oh lord
[53:13] among the gods
[53:16] who is like the
[53:19] glorious in holiness
[53:22] fearful
[53:24] in praises
[53:26] doing
[53:27] wonders
[53:29] praise the lord
[53:31] daniel chapter 11.
[53:58] daniel chapter 11 we commented a little
[54:01] bit on on uh
[54:03] on daniel vision and in
[54:05] wednesday night but let's just read
[54:07] verse 32. i was kind of a stumbling over
[54:10] this verse on wednesday night i was
[54:12] looking for it in chapter 12 where that
[54:14] is in chapter 11
[54:16] verse 32
[54:20] daniel 11 verse 32 and such as do weekly
[54:27] against the coveted
[54:29] shall he corrupt
[54:31] by flattering
[54:33] but
[54:33] the people
[54:36] that do know their god shall be strong
[54:40] and do
[54:41] explode
[54:43] so we realized that year
[54:45] uh there there's a group of people that
[54:48] will be corrupted by flattery in
[54:51] believing that that a man on earth can
[54:54] be a holy man
[54:56] and
[54:57] and they will be deceived by that
[54:59] but there's also a group of people
[55:02] there have been
[55:04] a promise and ordained to know their god
[55:08] and that's that's that's the that is the
[55:11] the
[55:12] the inspiration that is that is behind
[55:15] what i want to share is is knowing god
[55:19] amen let's pray father we just want to
[55:22] ask your blessings now
[55:24] upon your word come lord father take our
[55:28] feeble effort
[55:29] of studying and praying and waiting on
[55:32] you
[55:33] lord put it aside this morning you know
[55:36] our limitations of god you know father
[55:39] lord
[55:40] uh
[55:41] how much we need you
[55:42] when it comes to this time
[55:45] we just want to ask lord father if there
[55:47] be anything oh god that will stop the
[55:50] moving of the spirit this morning we
[55:52] want to bring it under the blood of
[55:53] jesus christ
[55:55] oh father god i pray that your word oh
[55:58] god we have the liberty oh lord jesus to
[56:01] be able to convict to rebuke
[56:04] even to heal
[56:07] because your word possess
[56:10] your internal attributes
[56:13] bless us now
[56:14] in jesus name we pray amen
[56:18] amen the lord bless you you may have
[56:20] your seed
[56:22] praise the lord
[56:24] amen is going to be in the house of the
[56:26] lord this morning so we uh
[56:31] talking this morning
[56:34] on the attributes of god
[56:36] you know i was i was reading in in
[56:40] studying
[56:41] this subject
[56:43] looking at different cults and also
[56:45] studying different other materials
[56:49] [Music]
[56:54] and i came across
[56:57] something that made me know to also
[57:00] think
[57:01] about
[57:02] some
[57:04] scriptures
[57:06] on wednesday night
[57:08] we read
[57:10] from the book of job where job says
[57:13] acquaint yourself with god
[57:17] and and i kept thinking about
[57:20] uh
[57:21] let's let's look at job chapter 35
[57:24] job chapter 35
[57:29] but before we go to 25 let's look at 26
[57:34] job 26.
[57:45] and as you read the book of job you you
[57:48] come across
[57:49] this expression but
[57:52] let's let's look at this one chapter 26
[57:55] verse
[57:56] 14.
[58:06] let's look at verse 13.
[58:09] and i could say let's go back to verse
[58:10] 12. and i will say go back to verse
[58:17] you know and you could just go back and
[58:19] go back and go back but this is job
[58:22] having an expression he's he's actually
[58:25] talking about god he's talking about the
[58:28] creator of heaven and earth
[58:34] amen
[58:37] verse 12 he divided the sea
[58:41] with his power and by his understanding
[58:45] he uh smothered through the prowl
[58:49] verse 13 by his spirit he have ganished
[58:53] the the heavens
[58:55] his hand have formed
[58:57] the crooks stepping
[58:59] verse 14 this is where my thought is low
[59:04] these are part of his ways
[59:08] but how little a portion
[59:12] is heard
[59:14] of him
[59:17] praise the lord
[59:19] these are just part all that we will say
[59:22] i mean if every one of us are giving the
[59:25] opportunity this morning we can all
[59:27] testify
[59:28] of how
[59:30] good god has been to us
[59:33] we can all talk of different unique
[59:36] situation
[59:38] but it's just a little portion that's
[59:41] right
[59:42] that would be heard of him
[59:47] praise the lord
[59:49] just a little portion
[59:52] that will be heard of him
[59:57] but the thunder of his power who
[1:00:01] can understand
[1:00:05] praise the lord
[1:00:07] so it's it's i mean it's it really shake
[1:00:10] you
[1:00:11] in your boots for you too for you to
[1:00:14] talk about
[1:00:16] god in in in his attributes
[1:00:20] but we would just we'll just talk this
[1:00:22] morning and and uh and the purpose of of
[1:00:25] this is just to be able to magnify the
[1:00:29] lord amen
[1:00:30] it's just to say how great is our god
[1:00:33] amen moses said among all the gods he i
[1:00:37] mean he grew in egypt he knew all the
[1:00:39] gods of the river the gods of the of the
[1:00:43] you know every all the different gods
[1:00:45] they have in egypt
[1:00:46] and uh uh god making himself known unto
[1:00:51] that prophet brought him to the place to
[1:00:54] have that expression among all the gods
[1:00:57] there is none that is like unto thee
[1:01:00] praise the lord
[1:01:02] job in his experience
[1:01:05] you read the book of job is tall it told
[1:01:08] us that there was there was not a man
[1:01:10] like job you know he was a man that was
[1:01:12] respected among his people you know he
[1:01:15] counsel people in the marketplaces he
[1:01:18] was a man that had such a reputation
[1:01:21] and i believe that job in his days
[1:01:24] taught like you and myself he taught he
[1:01:27] have god he have got a hold of god he
[1:01:30] have got a a a an understanding of god
[1:01:33] that he can be able to counsel people in
[1:01:36] their
[1:01:37] and and and give them comfort and they
[1:01:39] can hold to those things but when joe
[1:01:42] started to go through his life trial
[1:01:44] then he realized there is more of god to
[1:01:48] know
[1:01:52] praise the lord
[1:01:55] there is more of god to know
[1:01:58] because
[1:02:00] job head to his integrity and he knew
[1:02:04] that to the best of his knowledge there
[1:02:08] was not something that he knew that he
[1:02:10] did for which all of the calamity was
[1:02:13] coming upon him
[1:02:15] but yet he could not understand
[1:02:18] why a just god
[1:02:21] will allow him to go through those
[1:02:23] things
[1:02:25] but as he started going through
[1:02:27] his trial day after day
[1:02:30] the attributes of god that he never knew
[1:02:34] about
[1:02:36] started to come on display
[1:02:39] and god started making himself more
[1:02:41] clearer to job
[1:02:43] than he knew by just sitting in the
[1:02:46] church and listening to a preacher
[1:02:49] praise the lord
[1:02:51] but he knew by just you know holding to
[1:02:54] a water baptising confession
[1:02:57] sometimes they have to take those trials
[1:03:00] of our life
[1:03:03] where nobody have an answer for you to
[1:03:06] really really get to know god
[1:03:10] that's the reason why the psalmist said
[1:03:12] he he hid himself in darkness
[1:03:21] praise the lord
[1:03:22] but yet he's the god of light
[1:03:26] but he had himself in darkness
[1:03:30] so we i would just trust that the law
[1:03:33] will be able to help us this morning
[1:03:34] just like i said i read a few of this on
[1:03:37] wednesday night uh brother peterson was
[1:03:40] preaching last wednesday and then he
[1:03:43] he went into this path
[1:03:45] of talking about the full knowledge of
[1:03:48] god
[1:03:49] and
[1:03:50] it's a subject not only around the
[1:03:53] message but it's a subject that is
[1:03:56] greatly misunderstood
[1:04:00] praise the lord
[1:04:01] and and this this subject
[1:04:04] is greatly misunderstood because i look
[1:04:07] i look a little bit into church history
[1:04:09] and i realized that even back then they
[1:04:11] had that problem when it comes to the
[1:04:13] subject of full knowledge predestination
[1:04:16] in and and election
[1:04:19] and uh uh uh
[1:04:22] there's there's a concept
[1:04:24] you will you will you will pick that up
[1:04:27] there's a concept
[1:04:30] that uh
[1:04:31] uh
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:33] let's let's read here from adoption we
[1:04:35] read this wednesday night i tried to
[1:04:38] shorten it from what i had
[1:04:40] uh listening to this predestination look
[1:04:43] back to full knowledge i means election
[1:04:45] election looks back to full knowledge
[1:04:48] and predestination predestination looks
[1:04:50] to destiny look back and see there he
[1:04:54] predestinated a long time ago by full
[1:04:57] knowledge he seen that i
[1:05:01] will
[1:05:02] love him
[1:05:04] so
[1:05:05] he made
[1:05:07] a proportion through his son
[1:05:10] that through him i might
[1:05:14] become
[1:05:15] from a crocodile a grain of wheat
[1:05:20] praise the lord
[1:05:21] so the error that is in this teaching
[1:05:24] is that
[1:05:26] the error there is that
[1:05:29] it pulls some waltiness in the creature
[1:05:35] that's the error that is in the teaching
[1:05:38] that it puts some worthiness that god
[1:05:42] knew that
[1:05:44] you will want to be safe
[1:05:47] or god knew that you will love him
[1:05:53] putting that wealthiness in the creature
[1:05:56] separating it from the creator
[1:05:59] that the creed that that
[1:06:01] the god of heaven saw it
[1:06:03] and because of that
[1:06:07] he elected you
[1:06:10] it's wrong
[1:06:16] praise the lord amen
[1:06:19] it's wrong and and and the
[1:06:21] the softness in death is that
[1:06:25] it have made many
[1:06:28] uh believing christians
[1:06:30] in the word and and even around the
[1:06:32] message
[1:06:33] to think that
[1:06:36] there is something i don't understand it
[1:06:38] but there is just something in me that
[1:06:41] god saw from the foundation of the word
[1:06:44] praise the lord now to make that
[1:06:47] statement is to make you another being
[1:06:52] separate from god that existed at the
[1:06:55] foundation of the word
[1:06:58] which is which is wrong
[1:07:00] it was elohim alone
[1:07:03] it was god alone
[1:07:07] the self-existing god alone
[1:07:11] by himself
[1:07:14] if anything came into existence it came
[1:07:17] out of god
[1:07:24] are we together
[1:07:26] praise the lord because just like i said
[1:07:29] we have to we have to uh
[1:07:32] we have to know and understand why the
[1:07:36] efficient parallel joshua series was
[1:07:39] preached
[1:07:40] that series was preached brother branham
[1:07:42] says to answer the same question
[1:07:46] that god cannot lost that which he had
[1:07:49] already saved
[1:07:51] praise the lord
[1:07:53] because many people that run into the
[1:07:55] crisis of this understanding they get to
[1:07:58] the place where when it starts to go
[1:08:01] through trials in their life
[1:08:04] then they start to doubt the very
[1:08:07] existence of god
[1:08:11] because our first time they thought that
[1:08:13] oh god knew i would be saved that's why
[1:08:14] i'm saying but now why am i going
[1:08:16] through this so for the mother father
[1:08:18] there is no god at all
[1:08:26] praise the lord
[1:08:28] let's read a little bit
[1:08:31] let's read a little bit i'll read this
[1:08:33] and you will see how
[1:08:35] a prophet of god will rightly pre
[1:08:38] position the word he says by fall
[1:08:41] knowledge he's seen that i will love him
[1:08:46] so he made a proportion through his son
[1:08:50] that through him i might become a
[1:08:52] crooked but to a weak now
[1:08:54] where am i
[1:08:56] where am i at now i'm safe i'm walking
[1:09:00] in the grace of god what does
[1:09:03] predestination look to destinate
[1:09:06] where will he take me toll
[1:09:09] and where am i going amen
[1:09:12] there's
[1:09:13] uh that that got you there you are
[1:09:16] he goes down and he says here
[1:09:20] amen he says and let's read a little
[1:09:22] further and then he goes there and read
[1:09:24] that scripture
[1:09:25] over
[1:09:26] in ephesians chapter one having
[1:09:29] predestinated
[1:09:31] us on to the adoption
[1:09:33] predestinated
[1:09:35] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[1:09:39] christ
[1:09:40] to himself
[1:09:42] are calling
[1:09:44] to
[1:09:46] the good pleasure
[1:09:48] of his will
[1:09:51] a calling to the good
[1:09:54] pleasure
[1:09:56] of his will keep that in the back of
[1:09:58] your mind we'll come back to that what
[1:10:00] did he do by foreknowledge
[1:10:03] foresaw us
[1:10:05] knowing
[1:10:06] that
[1:10:07] he was a savior self-existing
[1:10:17] there was no angels
[1:10:19] no nothing just god
[1:10:22] held elohim the self-existent one
[1:10:25] nothing
[1:10:26] but him alone
[1:10:30] but in him was a savior
[1:10:34] well
[1:10:36] what he's going to say there is nothing
[1:10:39] lost
[1:10:41] nothing nor in there
[1:10:43] then he know
[1:10:47] that in this great attribute in him who
[1:10:52] project
[1:10:57] praise the lord
[1:10:58] because he's a savior
[1:11:01] so his attribute has to project
[1:11:04] something to be safe or as that thing
[1:11:07] will not be there
[1:11:10] his attribute has to project it
[1:11:17] are we together
[1:11:26] but in him was a savior well what he's
[1:11:28] going to save there was nothing lost
[1:11:31] knowing that then
[1:11:33] he know
[1:11:35] that his great attribute in him will
[1:11:38] project something out yonder
[1:11:41] that he
[1:11:42] could save
[1:11:47] then
[1:11:49] when it when it did that
[1:11:52] by full knowledge he looked down after
[1:11:55] his attribute has projected that but
[1:11:58] whether they projected it in his mind
[1:12:05] and he looked down and saw everyone
[1:12:09] that who accepted
[1:12:15] are we together
[1:12:20] we are talking about the self-existing
[1:12:24] god
[1:12:27] the god
[1:12:29] that dwelleth one time
[1:12:31] by himself
[1:12:36] and everything
[1:12:37] that is made was made by him and without
[1:12:41] him
[1:12:42] there was nothing me
[1:12:46] praise the lord
[1:12:48] amen
[1:12:49] i want to talk on himself as this
[1:12:51] self-existence
[1:12:53] the self-existing god how can you talk
[1:12:56] about self-resistance when he is just
[1:12:58] self-existent self-existing himself
[1:13:00] enough
[1:13:03] but that's is that attribute of god
[1:13:08] that makes him a god
[1:13:11] of solitariness
[1:13:14] because he's he was a god that dweller
[1:13:17] one time by himself
[1:13:23] praise the lord
[1:13:25] amen
[1:13:26] he was a god that endured one time by
[1:13:28] himself
[1:13:33] let's take this in there who is this
[1:13:39] let's chase the dick
[1:13:40] now in the beginning god word alone
[1:13:44] with his attribute as i spoke on this
[1:13:46] morning
[1:13:48] there's his thoughts
[1:13:50] his attributes is his thought there was
[1:13:53] nothing just god alone
[1:13:57] just like a great activity can sit down
[1:14:00] in his mind
[1:14:02] and draw out what he thinks
[1:14:07] he's going to build create
[1:14:10] now
[1:14:11] he cannot create he can take something
[1:14:15] that has been created he's talking about
[1:14:17] a natural architect now a natural
[1:14:20] architect cannot create he can take
[1:14:22] something that's been created and make
[1:14:25] it in a different form
[1:14:27] because it's god alone
[1:14:29] that can create
[1:14:31] praise the lord
[1:14:33] but he gets in his mind what he's going
[1:14:37] to do
[1:14:38] and there's his thoughts
[1:14:41] that's his desire is a thought
[1:14:45] and then he speaks it
[1:14:48] and it's a word
[1:14:51] a thought
[1:14:52] when is expressed is a word
[1:14:56] praise the lord
[1:14:58] amen
[1:15:01] chains of god
[1:15:03] what i want us to what i i'm trusting
[1:15:05] that the holy spirit would do for us
[1:15:07] this morning
[1:15:08] is to bring us to the place
[1:15:11] that when we sing the song how great
[1:15:14] they are
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:17] we will not leave nothing in us
[1:15:20] but we will give it all to him
[1:15:26] praise the lord
[1:15:27] amen
[1:15:29] because our very existence
[1:15:32] is in him
[1:15:36] like the apostle says in the book of our
[1:15:39] abs
[1:15:40] in him we move
[1:15:42] and we have our being
[1:15:47] praise the lord
[1:15:50] and what what it does for the believer
[1:15:52] is that
[1:15:54] it make us to actually appreciate
[1:15:58] the grace of god
[1:16:02] because as soon as you realize
[1:16:05] that god
[1:16:07] do not need
[1:16:10] your worship
[1:16:13] whether you worship him or not it don't
[1:16:15] take anything from god for the matter of
[1:16:18] fact worshipping god help you better
[1:16:22] than helping god
[1:16:28] praise the lord
[1:16:30] oh yeah brother branham says god made us
[1:16:33] uh uh for fellowship he made the angels
[1:16:36] to to to worship whether the angels were
[1:16:39] made or man-made
[1:16:41] god in his existence and his power his
[1:16:45] ability they all existed with him
[1:16:52] praise the lord
[1:16:54] the angels being made to worship god
[1:16:57] never made god any greater than what he
[1:16:59] was
[1:17:00] he only brought out an attribute
[1:17:03] he expressed an attribute
[1:17:06] but god remains god
[1:17:12] praise the lord
[1:17:14] see what job says
[1:17:17] job chapter 35
[1:17:29] you hear people sometimes they they go
[1:17:31] through trial of living and they get so
[1:17:34] angry
[1:17:35] god i'm not going to save you again as
[1:17:37] hefty said when you say that god oh my
[1:17:39] goodness
[1:17:41] why would you not accept me
[1:17:43] please please help me
[1:17:49] job chapter 35
[1:17:51] verse 7.
[1:17:58] verse 5 look unto the heavens and seed
[1:18:01] and behold the clouds
[1:18:03] which
[1:18:04] are higher than you than doubt
[1:18:08] if thou seen it
[1:18:10] what does that against him
[1:18:15] or if thou
[1:18:16] if that transgression be multiplied
[1:18:19] what does they are unto him it's not
[1:18:22] going to affect god
[1:18:29] affects you
[1:18:31] brother branham says the unbelief only
[1:18:33] handled the unbeliever
[1:18:38] amen it does not rob god of his holiness
[1:18:48] praise the lord
[1:18:49] amen
[1:18:54] if thou be righteous
[1:18:57] what give a doubt to him
[1:19:02] be righteous
[1:19:03] what have you given extra to god
[1:19:11] you don't give nothing extra to him
[1:19:17] that is the reason why a righteousness
[1:19:19] without him is still filthy
[1:19:25] it's still filthy
[1:19:27] he has to associate with it
[1:19:30] it has to be what he
[1:19:33] gave to you
[1:19:36] for him to accept god will only accept
[1:19:39] what he gave to you he will not accept
[1:19:41] what you breathe by yourself
[1:19:50] oh god you know i've been serving you
[1:19:52] for the day of my life i've been saving
[1:19:54] you i've been suffering for you
[1:20:02] praise the lord
[1:20:06] oh i hope that this will bring us
[1:20:10] to some consciousness
[1:20:12] because you see there's a people
[1:20:15] that have been
[1:20:17] where christ will have the preeminence
[1:20:21] and christ cannot have the preeminence
[1:20:24] in the bride when the bride thinks that
[1:20:27] she has
[1:20:28] some rights
[1:20:33] and god had to play
[1:20:38] to her demands
[1:20:42] praise the lord
[1:20:44] you hear all of these words goes down
[1:20:46] the the the the the penny custer
[1:20:49] caramaxed uh uh reign that god i declare
[1:20:53] and decreed
[1:21:01] praise the lord
[1:21:04] the lord help us will talk on the on the
[1:21:06] decrees of god
[1:21:12] so job said if thou be righteous what
[1:21:15] gave it down him
[1:21:19] or what received he
[1:21:21] of the hands
[1:21:33] that wickedness
[1:21:35] may hurt a man
[1:21:37] as thou art
[1:21:39] and that righteousness may profit the
[1:21:43] son of man
[1:21:45] it might encourage somebody somebody
[1:21:47] might get inspired from your way of life
[1:21:50] but it does not change god
[1:21:56] it does not change god it does not add
[1:21:58] one thing to him
[1:22:01] it don't take anything
[1:22:03] the moment we start to realize
[1:22:05] that god operates out of our time zone
[1:22:10] the bible said he sits on the cycle
[1:22:17] he's outside
[1:22:18] he's not into your 24 hours he's not
[1:22:21] into your 306th days he's not no god he
[1:22:26] he's outside he's his internal that's
[1:22:28] the reason why he have already
[1:22:31] determined and declared what will happen
[1:22:34] in our time space and it happened just
[1:22:37] like he said
[1:22:39] that's why he knows the end from the
[1:22:40] beginning
[1:22:48] god is now on a pressure oh i have to do
[1:22:51] something before this coronavirus kill
[1:22:53] all my children
[1:22:56] he's not under pressure
[1:23:00] he's now under pressure
[1:23:09] praise the lord you see that's the
[1:23:11] reason why
[1:23:13] serving god is a love affair
[1:23:18] when it's a duty you think that you are
[1:23:20] doing this for god so he can do that for
[1:23:22] you
[1:23:25] it has to be a love affair
[1:23:28] david said even if you slay me
[1:23:30] yes
[1:23:32] i will still love you
[1:23:36] it has to be a love affair
[1:23:50] so he's
[1:23:51] the self-existent god
[1:23:55] the self-existing guy now the thing
[1:23:58] about it there is that when you look at
[1:24:00] god in in his solitary attributes
[1:24:07] it's it's been it's been misunderstood
[1:24:10] by
[1:24:11] by by malta by by him because that that
[1:24:15] is an attribute
[1:24:16] that
[1:24:17] that is that is unique to god
[1:24:21] i mean
[1:24:24] man has has put themselves
[1:24:28] into isolation
[1:24:32] wanting to be solitary
[1:24:37] isolation and being solitary is two
[1:24:40] different things
[1:24:46] praise the lord
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:49] we'll look at that a little bit here
[1:24:53] praise the lord
[1:24:56] amen
[1:24:58] let me go down a little bit on this on
[1:25:00] these thoughts that we're reading here
[1:25:01] of this great god
[1:25:06] northeast those who have
[1:25:09] tonight internal life
[1:25:11] was with him and in him
[1:25:14] in his thinking
[1:25:17] before
[1:25:18] there ever was an injure a star a
[1:25:22] cherubin or anything
[1:25:26] that's intender
[1:25:29] praise the lord
[1:25:31] and if you have internal life
[1:25:34] you always was
[1:25:36] not your being
[1:25:38] not your being here
[1:25:40] not your physical body
[1:25:43] not your physical body
[1:25:47] there is a
[1:25:48] there is a stigma if i can say there is
[1:25:50] there is something
[1:25:53] something of the serpent
[1:25:56] that makes this flesh
[1:25:58] makes this body
[1:26:01] sometimes becomes so
[1:26:04] conscious of itself
[1:26:07] and in all the way that the grace of god
[1:26:09] is dealing with us and he's changing us
[1:26:12] and and and he's revealing himself to us
[1:26:15] there is just something of this body
[1:26:17] that just wants some kind of a praise
[1:26:20] some kind of a glory some
[1:26:23] just want to share in something
[1:26:27] it's an effect that comes from the
[1:26:29] serpent
[1:26:35] and as long as we live in this body
[1:26:37] that's what we have to wrestle against
[1:26:41] to bring this body subject
[1:26:43] to god's word
[1:26:54] that's where the fight is brother
[1:26:59] that's where the fight is
[1:27:06] and so when you look at you look at the
[1:27:08] thought let's let's read down a little
[1:27:09] bit here because this this is uh this is
[1:27:12] comforting amen
[1:27:16] and if he isn't infinite he isn't god
[1:27:21] god has to be
[1:27:23] infinite
[1:27:27] and he was only present not only seeing
[1:27:30] unimportant god
[1:27:32] if he isn't
[1:27:34] then he he can be god nor in all things
[1:27:38] all place
[1:27:39] because of his omnipresence
[1:27:46] praise the lord
[1:27:48] he dwell in the house
[1:27:51] but being
[1:27:53] on many sins he knows all things
[1:27:57] makes his
[1:27:59] omnipresent what he
[1:28:02] his own impression because he knows
[1:28:04] everything that's going on
[1:28:07] there can be a fleet but his eyes but
[1:28:10] what he knows
[1:28:12] praise the lord
[1:28:14] he knows it before there was a word
[1:28:18] i mean so
[1:28:20] paul said there that that is the god
[1:28:22] that we have we have to do
[1:28:25] we have to deal with that's the god
[1:28:27] that we are worshiping this is a god
[1:28:30] that is not limited in power
[1:28:33] he's not limited he's not learning
[1:28:35] anything new
[1:28:43] if god would just raise our faith to be
[1:28:46] able to embrace him
[1:28:49] in a way
[1:28:52] let's look at this god keep his word
[1:29:00] what happened
[1:29:03] you literally many years ago at the
[1:29:06] first reformation
[1:29:08] you held
[1:29:09] the torch light of freedom in your hands
[1:29:13] you were god's light what happened to
[1:29:15] you
[1:29:18] because
[1:29:20] you read in the bible the judge shall
[1:29:22] live by faith and you organize yourself
[1:29:26] around that one scripture
[1:29:29] and become a bunch of assolutionists
[1:29:35] and god took the torchlight out of your
[1:29:38] hands
[1:29:40] that's right
[1:29:42] the josh are laid by faith
[1:29:44] but there's
[1:29:45] more scripture
[1:29:48] than that
[1:29:50] so what better man madam showing here is
[1:29:52] that one time
[1:29:54] god was dealing with uh uh uh uh the
[1:29:58] lutheran's honor the uh luther revival
[1:30:01] when when he had that grace upon his
[1:30:03] life
[1:30:04] and uh and and god was using that to
[1:30:08] show himself his grace
[1:30:10] to the people the judge shall lay by
[1:30:12] faith he was dealing with them
[1:30:14] but what happened is that they organized
[1:30:17] themselves they took one scripture
[1:30:21] and you can take one structure you can
[1:30:23] take one cult you can take one idea
[1:30:27] and they organize themselves
[1:30:30] and became a bunch of
[1:30:33] in a sense that they cut everybody off
[1:30:36] if you are not in this movement god is
[1:30:38] not with you
[1:30:45] praise the lord
[1:30:50] it's a it's a way
[1:30:51] of
[1:30:53] creating your own self-existence
[1:31:03] praise the lord
[1:31:07] now follow me because i'm going to dwell
[1:31:08] on that a little bit
[1:31:11] because that is the thing
[1:31:15] that
[1:31:16] is killing
[1:31:19] people
[1:31:21] have
[1:31:22] isolated themselves
[1:31:26] amen
[1:31:27] creating their own self-existence
[1:31:35] the isolation isolate themselves just by
[1:31:39] and honestly this is the way i see it
[1:31:41] and everybody is wrong
[1:31:52] praise the lord
[1:32:01] uh
[1:32:12] but you see when god dwelled by himself
[1:32:15] [Music]
[1:32:18] as the great
[1:32:19] intent of spirit
[1:32:22] l
[1:32:23] elah elohim the self-existent god
[1:32:32] he had his attributes his abilities
[1:32:35] in him
[1:32:37] he had his thoughts
[1:32:46] and as god thinks about his children and
[1:32:49] he thinks about you know
[1:32:53] being the healer and being the savior
[1:32:59] showing that he's not
[1:33:01] selfish in his ways
[1:33:04] he decided to manifest his attributes
[1:33:08] praise the lord
[1:33:10] amen
[1:33:12] manifest his attribute condescend
[1:33:14] himself in the body of light that we
[1:33:16] call the logos to start the beginning
[1:33:19] the very beginning of the creation of
[1:33:20] god that's what the scripture says we
[1:33:23] went through that wednesday night
[1:33:25] and i saw
[1:33:29] but yet in his greatness also
[1:33:34] he was going to
[1:33:35] manifest his attribute as being the
[1:33:37] savior as being a healer and and all of
[1:33:39] that and we read also in collusion how
[1:33:42] all things was created
[1:33:44] by him
[1:33:45] and for him
[1:33:48] praise the lord
[1:33:51] and here in isaiah he says
[1:33:54] you know he created
[1:33:56] the good he created the evil
[1:33:59] because they were for him
[1:34:02] to manifest his attributes
[1:34:05] the bible make us to know that we are
[1:34:07] made for his pleasure we are made for
[1:34:10] him
[1:34:13] to do with us
[1:34:15] as he pleased
[1:34:20] praise the lord
[1:34:22] amen
[1:34:25] that's the reason why at least that mary
[1:34:27] knew when she said be it unto me not
[1:34:29] calling to that word
[1:34:35] liz did she know that
[1:34:37] all the things her life would have gone
[1:34:40] through all her plans that she made as a
[1:34:42] young woman was going to change
[1:34:47] from that day on because she wanted
[1:34:49] god's will and god word to be made
[1:34:53] manifest in her life
[1:34:57] praise the lord
[1:34:58] it becomes a a struggle word you start
[1:35:02] now to struggle between your own plan
[1:35:05] and in
[1:35:06] in
[1:35:07] accepting god's will
[1:35:10] because as as a young man or a young
[1:35:13] woman you have your ideas you have your
[1:35:16] ambitions
[1:35:18] you have your plans in your mind
[1:35:20] and then when god's will comes on the
[1:35:22] scene
[1:35:24] it becomes your struggle because you
[1:35:26] don't know his will you know your plans
[1:35:28] and your ambitions
[1:35:34] praise the lord
[1:35:37] amen
[1:35:40] let's take this show us
[1:35:42] the father
[1:35:43] and they will surpass us
[1:35:47] we have got a great product here
[1:35:51] but we are approaching the public
[1:35:54] wrong
[1:35:57] with it
[1:35:58] too much
[1:36:00] making us
[1:36:02] our solutions
[1:36:05] see
[1:36:07] it
[1:36:08] will sell itself
[1:36:10] just
[1:36:11] live it
[1:36:14] verb is talking about the message he's
[1:36:16] talking about his ministry
[1:36:18] he says we have a great product here
[1:36:22] if we if we just live it if we just love
[1:36:25] god and just live you know uh in love
[1:36:28] with god
[1:36:29] the product will sell itself
[1:36:37] he says but we are approaching the
[1:36:38] public the wrong way
[1:36:44] we are approaching the public the wrong
[1:36:46] way
[1:36:50] and we have made this move of god
[1:36:54] another group of
[1:36:58] isolationists
[1:37:00] that you have to be
[1:37:02] in the message
[1:37:13] it was selfish it would sell itself just
[1:37:15] live it
[1:37:16] see
[1:37:17] you are the salt of the earth
[1:37:21] the sword as long as
[1:37:23] the severed of the sword
[1:37:27] the the silver in the sword it will save
[1:37:31] if it comes in contact
[1:37:35] praise the lord
[1:37:36] but if you lose itself no matter how
[1:37:39] loud you shout
[1:37:41] and how you argued about doctrine and
[1:37:44] how you argue and condemn
[1:37:50] it's not bringing anybody closer to
[1:37:52] christ
[1:37:55] it's just only making you to feel like
[1:37:57] you are better than other people
[1:38:03] it's not changing life it's not healing
[1:38:05] the sake
[1:38:20] oh may god help us
[1:38:23] how we need the help of god
[1:38:26] the only
[1:38:28] reason why god spelled his life
[1:38:34] created his own blood cells
[1:38:37] and broke down blood sales
[1:38:42] was to bring his redeemed children back
[1:38:46] the reason why god
[1:38:49] give this grace for you to know him
[1:38:52] is that other will know him through you
[1:38:55] amen
[1:39:00] praise the lord amen
[1:39:11] that's the reason why
[1:39:15] when that birth comes in
[1:39:20] and starts to eat your life
[1:39:23] an area gets down in the soul
[1:39:27] you have sleep last night
[1:39:30] when you see young people stay on drugs
[1:39:34] when you see people in the street you
[1:39:35] see sinners
[1:39:37] you lose sleep overhead
[1:39:41] you don't become so glad all thank you
[1:39:43] jesus lord you saved me i thank you lord
[1:39:46] and you go to bed and sleep snow
[1:39:52] away when other souls are still dying
[1:40:04] praise the lord
[1:40:05] the true sense of grace will make you to
[1:40:08] prepare others lord i will have prepared
[1:40:10] you save thy men amen
[1:40:16] the true sense of grace
[1:40:32] but if he lost
[1:40:34] a savior no matter how loud we sh we we
[1:40:38] we shot down here then how much we jump
[1:40:40] up and down
[1:40:42] there got to be a life
[1:40:46] out here
[1:40:47] that backs that up
[1:40:51] and not a church life not a good
[1:40:53] shepherd life
[1:40:54] it must be the life of jesus christ
[1:41:04] not a message life
[1:41:07] praise the lord
[1:41:10] amen
[1:41:14] you know satan being an impersonator of
[1:41:17] god
[1:41:18] he have created this world
[1:41:21] of isolation
[1:41:24] that he brings people into
[1:41:27] praise the lord that yet they can be in
[1:41:29] a multitude of people and they are still
[1:41:31] isolated
[1:41:35] they can be in a room full of people
[1:41:39] and they are so i i mean that technology
[1:41:42] age has proven
[1:41:46] you find we are around the table and we
[1:41:49] are on our phones
[1:41:53] we we are connected
[1:41:55] to the fourth dimension moving
[1:41:59] right brother the presence around us
[1:42:02] that that is just an exposure
[1:42:05] of how much
[1:42:08] you can be sitting right here this
[1:42:10] morning under the sound of my voice and
[1:42:11] you are isolated
[1:42:15] you in your own word doing your own
[1:42:18] thing
[1:42:19] [Laughter]
[1:42:21] and nothing nothing in this building is
[1:42:23] connected to you it don't it don't even
[1:42:26] face
[1:42:26] you praise the lord
[1:42:32] but that's a word
[1:42:38] that the enemy
[1:42:40] has has created
[1:42:43] trying to impersonate
[1:42:49] the solitariness of god
[1:42:56] praise the lord
[1:43:00] you know you hear these things
[1:43:02] among people family church you know
[1:43:07] nobody called me nobody you know nobody
[1:43:10] loved me
[1:43:12] nobody come and visit me
[1:43:14] nobody call you who do you call
[1:43:19] praise the lord and you'll find that
[1:43:21] sometimes these people that do these
[1:43:22] things they have they have people
[1:43:25] that that they communicate with
[1:43:28] i mean if you're having a cell phone and
[1:43:30] you're paying bills and you're not
[1:43:31] calling anybody are you wasting money
[1:43:39] you're wasting money
[1:43:41] so in as much as you keep your cell
[1:43:43] phone there is somebody you talking to
[1:43:48] there is somebody you communicating with
[1:43:53] i mean even if there is just one
[1:43:55] favorable person you have that one
[1:44:00] praise the lord
[1:44:08] and i mean i can go down that road this
[1:44:10] morning
[1:44:12] but i don't want to
[1:44:14] let just stay with where we talking
[1:44:16] about
[1:44:19] but you see there's a word
[1:44:21] that the enemy
[1:44:23] has created
[1:44:26] i read a quote to you here
[1:44:36] brother brandon says listen to this he
[1:44:38] says here at that word he says i never
[1:44:40] could understand why our lord
[1:44:44] instead of
[1:44:46] as the day was over go down
[1:44:51] and talk over with a group of people
[1:44:58] or in the city he says but he always go
[1:45:02] alone to himself
[1:45:04] out in the desert
[1:45:08] way up away from the disciples and
[1:45:11] everything
[1:45:13] i wonder why he did it
[1:45:16] but i begin to understand
[1:45:20] now
[1:45:21] what
[1:45:23] begin to understand what he did he must
[1:45:27] it's
[1:45:28] setting parts of our lives
[1:45:31] must be absolutely kept alone
[1:45:37] praise the lord
[1:45:39] setting part of our life must be
[1:45:41] absolutely
[1:45:43] kept alone
[1:45:45] to ourself
[1:45:51] praise the lord
[1:45:52] i guess not that's not what he said
[1:46:00] but that's what we do
[1:46:04] a certain part of our life must be kept
[1:46:07] absolutely
[1:46:10] to ourself
[1:46:21] praise the lord
[1:46:24] when god dwelled alone he dwelled with
[1:46:27] his attributes
[1:46:31] you and myself we were in his mind
[1:46:34] and now that he have manifested us
[1:46:38] oh how he long to have that
[1:46:42] loneliness with you
[1:46:46] time with just you and the lord
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:53] reconnecting touching base
[1:46:55] [Laughter]
[1:46:57] as god will come down in the cold of the
[1:46:59] evening and say adam you are doing well
[1:47:02] boy
[1:47:04] you are expressing when you name
[1:47:07] that animal lion that was just what was
[1:47:10] in my mind
[1:47:14] praise the lord
[1:47:16] amen
[1:47:19] and that's the reason why even when adam
[1:47:21] fell he still came down
[1:47:24] and said adam where are you
[1:47:28] praise the lord he still came down
[1:47:30] because he needed that lonely time with
[1:47:33] him
[1:47:40] adam was looking for his own fake lee
[1:47:42] and finding his own place to hide
[1:47:43] himself looking for all the excuses it's
[1:47:46] the woman you gave me and i was here and
[1:47:48] everything was fine and you were just
[1:47:50] building a world around him
[1:47:55] when you are alone with yourself that's
[1:47:58] what happens
[1:47:59] you look for all the excuses in the
[1:48:01] world
[1:48:02] to make you to be right
[1:48:04] and other people are wrong
[1:48:06] [Music]
[1:48:08] but when you are alone with god is
[1:48:10] completely different
[1:48:11] [Laughter]
[1:48:13] it's completely different
[1:48:16] when you get along with god then you get
[1:48:18] burdened for other people
[1:48:23] when you're alone with yourself it's
[1:48:24] only yourself
[1:48:32] a setting part of our life must be
[1:48:34] absolutely kept along with god
[1:48:42] hating life in christ he says
[1:48:44] at my house the prayer room is the
[1:48:47] bedroom
[1:48:49] i had to drop this one in there because
[1:48:51] i love it
[1:48:52] many times i have went into
[1:48:55] little homes and see
[1:48:58] their mothers and sofa come out of the
[1:49:02] bedroom wave
[1:49:04] with a little
[1:49:06] check apron on whipping her eyes crying
[1:49:10] praying secret place meeting place alone
[1:49:13] with god isolated that's god's isolation
[1:49:17] when you are with him
[1:49:23] isolating yourself
[1:49:25] without god
[1:49:26] you are with the devil
[1:49:29] because he's going to blow your mind up
[1:49:31] give you every reason
[1:49:33] and before you realize that's why people
[1:49:35] hang themselves on their own ceiling
[1:49:50] praise the lord
[1:49:53] the devil has created a religious
[1:49:55] isolation for people
[1:49:59] everybody is wrong every church got a
[1:50:01] problem
[1:50:02] they are the only righteous person they
[1:50:04] are the one following the message
[1:50:08] making a poor example
[1:50:12] and they will want to raise their kids
[1:50:13] in there
[1:50:15] and don't realize
[1:50:16] that their sons will not marry their
[1:50:18] daughters their sons will have to go and
[1:50:20] look for somebody else's daughter
[1:50:26] to bring that same old arrogant selfish
[1:50:28] spirit
[1:50:30] to rule their home
[1:50:42] oh it's a marvelous place
[1:50:44] to be
[1:50:45] when a man take
[1:50:47] when a man ever takes his life out of
[1:50:50] these other places into that consecrated
[1:50:53] place with christ alone
[1:50:58] well some people
[1:51:00] so mean
[1:51:02] they can't even get alone with himself
[1:51:06] let alone with god
[1:51:10] praise the lord
[1:51:25] but that's the place we are
[1:51:27] that's the age
[1:51:30] that we are living in
[1:51:32] with the pressure that is on this edge
[1:51:36] paul called it this present evil word
[1:51:42] this present
[1:51:44] evil word
[1:51:46] i tell you young people you better get
[1:51:49] jesus in your boat
[1:51:53] praise the lord
[1:51:54] you better get jesus in your boat
[1:52:00] and just having in the body's net is not
[1:52:02] enough
[1:52:05] one time he got in the boat of simon
[1:52:08] and he told simon let's let's launch out
[1:52:10] in the demon he said where we we have
[1:52:12] told this whole place i mean last night
[1:52:14] we never slept what do you want to prove
[1:52:19] we went up and down this place not a
[1:52:21] bite we got
[1:52:24] but if he only knew
[1:52:26] that he was talking to the creator
[1:52:29] the creator himself
[1:52:34] so having him in your board is one thing
[1:52:36] but knowing who you have in your butt
[1:52:40] [Applause]
[1:52:44] praise the lord
[1:52:46] yes sir amen when peter finally decided
[1:52:49] to throw his net he couldn't bring it
[1:52:50] back
[1:52:54] he had enough strength to throw it out
[1:52:56] but he couldn't bring it back
[1:53:06] god is not a man
[1:53:11] amen
[1:53:12] god is not a man that he should lie
[1:53:17] he's not a man that he should lie
[1:53:21] neither he's the son of man to repent
[1:53:25] over what he have said
[1:53:31] the problem there is that
[1:53:35] theologic and theological theologians
[1:53:37] has reduced god
[1:53:40] from his infinite wisdom trying to
[1:53:43] explain the ways of god and and teach
[1:53:45] people how to get rich and teach people
[1:53:48] how to be blessed and teach people
[1:53:54] praise the lord
[1:53:57] they have just re reduced god to a
[1:53:59] gambler
[1:54:04] that you have to cast deaths and cast
[1:54:06] lots and all of that so god can bless
[1:54:08] you
[1:54:10] because it's how much you give to him
[1:54:12] that's how much he will give back to you
[1:54:18] praise the lord
[1:54:21] when he was creating this universe
[1:54:23] he never needed our help
[1:54:28] praise the lord
[1:54:30] amen
[1:54:33] he gave each and every one of us
[1:54:36] a unique design
[1:54:40] that there is no one like you
[1:54:45] even if they try to impersonate they can
[1:54:49] never be
[1:54:50] like you
[1:54:55] praise the lord
[1:54:57] after he used that more he threw it away
[1:55:03] praise the lord
[1:55:05] the south africans say you are a cut of
[1:55:07] your kind
[1:55:08] and we can find them all
[1:55:11] to reproduce you
[1:55:15] praise the lord
[1:55:23] so since
[1:55:25] the god of this
[1:55:27] great wisdom and knowledge i mean it's
[1:55:29] just i was sitting in the office there
[1:55:31] and
[1:55:32] and uh i was just praying and i was just
[1:55:35] saying to the lord how can i talk about
[1:55:37] you

[1:55:41] to break on jesus i'm just going to live
[1:55:43] his holy name
[1:55:45] praise the lord
[1:55:48] he says his glory he will give to no man
[1:55:53] praise the lord
[1:55:55] you know it's all about him
[1:55:59] it's all about him
[1:56:00] it's he is
[1:56:02] i mean uh it's it's
[1:56:04] he's a he said he's a god center
[1:56:09] there is no one in comparison
[1:56:13] you we can't do anything to impress him
[1:56:22] praise the lord
[1:56:26] he says but brother one then why do we
[1:56:28] serve him
[1:56:31] amen
[1:56:34] because he calls us to
[1:56:40] because he calls us
[1:56:42] [Music]
[1:56:44] praise the lord
[1:56:46] and when you think about it
[1:56:48] it just makes you to love him amen
[1:56:53] david say he know my uprising
[1:56:57] he know my down setting
[1:57:02] even if i make my bed in hell
[1:57:07] where can i go
[1:57:09] from the great knowledge of god
[1:57:15] that's the god we serve
[1:57:19] now you tell me now if we get to the
[1:57:21] place where we can trust him
[1:57:26] and if we are dealing with situation
[1:57:28] where we can place it in his hands and
[1:57:30] say god help me
[1:57:33] not trying to make ways for help
[1:57:36] but believing that he's more than able
[1:57:39] he can change the situation he is the
[1:57:41] creator
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:44] the creator of heaven and earth
[1:57:46] the very birth that we breathe comes
[1:57:48] from him
[1:57:55] why can't we just love him
[1:57:57] that's it
[1:57:59] why can't we just love him
[1:58:01] for who
[1:58:03] he is
[1:58:07] and the grace that he has given to us
[1:58:09] why can't we just love him
[1:58:11] while we always want to get in the place
[1:58:13] to do something
[1:58:16] impressive
[1:58:20] that's not what he's asking for
[1:58:28] he's asking for
[1:58:31] a life
[1:58:33] that is available
[1:58:35] for him to live through
[1:58:39] he's asking for a life
[1:58:41] for a young man or a young woman that
[1:58:43] would just surround her their life
[1:58:47] praise the lord
[1:58:50] just like peter giving his bought
[1:58:53] for jesus to huge and preach
[1:58:56] just like joseph giving his grave for
[1:58:59] jesus to be buried in
[1:59:02] i'm telling you there is nothing you
[1:59:04] gave to him
[1:59:05] that he does not take good care of
[1:59:07] [Laughter]
[1:59:10] there is nothing you gave him that he
[1:59:12] don't take good care of
[1:59:14] he would take
[1:59:16] too much good care of it that you the
[1:59:18] owner you will be so afraid to use it
[1:59:24] he will take too much good care of it
[1:59:27] that you'll be so afraid to pick out a
[1:59:28] cigarette in your finger
[1:59:31] or to take another whiskey to your mouth
[1:59:34] because the lord will take good care of
[1:59:36] your life amen
[1:59:39] that you'll be afraid to misuse it
[1:59:48] oh i just love him this morning
[1:59:51] i just came to tell you that i love him
[1:59:53] and i know you do the same
[1:59:57] praise the lord
[1:59:59] praise the lord
[2:00:02] amen
[2:00:05] amen
[2:00:06] they just all jesus
[2:00:08] yes
[2:00:09] i'm telling you it's all jesus
[2:00:12] is all jesus
[2:00:15] we are saved
[2:00:17] by grace
[2:00:18] amen
[2:00:20] so think that you deserve to be saved
[2:00:22] that's why god save you is to take grace
[2:00:25] out of the picture
[2:00:29] it's a web grace out of the picture
[2:00:33] praise the lord
[2:00:35] it's a thought that he had about you
[2:00:39] and he projected that thought
[2:00:43] praise the lord
[2:00:46] and for you to be a recipient
[2:00:51] how grateful we should be that's right
[2:00:55] how grateful
[2:00:57] we should be
[2:00:58] yes
[2:00:59] and if we if we
[2:01:02] appreciate the principle of esteeming
[2:01:04] others better than ourselves
[2:01:09] then we will realize
[2:01:13] that
[2:01:17] if the choice was there
[2:01:21] could you give your place to someone to
[2:01:23] be safe
[2:01:29] praise the lord
[2:01:37] what grace what a love
[2:01:40] that the father love us
[2:01:45] you see we are we we are privileged
[2:01:47] people
[2:01:49] to be able to have the kind of a
[2:01:51] ministry
[2:01:53] that god brought in this last day
[2:01:56] to open the word of god to us
[2:01:59] bring us to a level of understanding
[2:02:02] not to know god in the shadow
[2:02:07] because remember daniel says it's the
[2:02:09] people that know their god
[2:02:12] they're going to do explore
[2:02:15] amen
[2:02:16] the people that know their god
[2:02:19] they're not going to be
[2:02:21] reflects of all these things that are
[2:02:23] happening
[2:02:27] but like brother brandon says like that
[2:02:29] uh uh
[2:02:30] uh all mother on the flight
[2:02:35] going to see her daughter
[2:02:39] and he says there was uh
[2:02:41] turbulence the flight was just
[2:02:43] out of
[2:02:44] control
[2:02:46] and the old mama just bought her hair
[2:02:48] and prayed
[2:02:53] and he says that someone said to her
[2:02:55] mama are you not afraid she said no
[2:02:58] she says why
[2:02:59] since when this flight
[2:03:01] lanes i have a daughter home i'm going
[2:03:04] to meet
[2:03:05] if it please god to take me i have
[2:03:07] another one behind the curtain
[2:03:08] [Laughter]
[2:03:12] praise the lord so it's a win-win
[2:03:15] situation for a believer
[2:03:18] they have their hope in christ
[2:03:21] and i've come to this rest
[2:03:26] they have come to this place of rest
[2:03:36] i mean when we get to the place where
[2:03:40] the lord allowed a little try to perfect

[2:06:10] i mean you cannot even get out of this
[2:06:12] out of this church door without being
[2:06:15] picked up by the camera because we're
[2:06:16] having one right day
[2:06:22] brother jordan i don't know what i
[2:06:24] should have said or not but
[2:06:26] i've said it
[2:06:31] well what am i what am i driving talk we
[2:06:33] are living in an age of great
[2:06:36] surveillance
[2:06:41] and this is to also show to you how much
[2:06:44] god is keeping his eyes on you
[2:06:46] if the world is keeping their eyes on
[2:06:49] you the eyes of almighty god is keeping
[2:06:52] the one that do not sleep
[2:06:55] and do not
[2:06:56] slumber is keeping you
[2:06:59] on the surveillance as well
[2:07:05] [Music]
[2:07:08] but that's the age that we are living in
[2:07:13] our life is on honor surveillance
[2:07:20] praise the lord
[2:07:22] do you realize how much a life dedicated
[2:07:25] to christ
[2:07:26] can speak louder
[2:07:29] than the preacher behind the pupae
[2:07:34] because our life is under surveillance
[2:07:38] people are watching
[2:07:40] they are looking
[2:07:41] they don't even know what they are
[2:07:42] looking for they are not even looking
[2:07:44] for christ they're just looking
[2:07:48] and pretty soon they realize she's
[2:07:50] different
[2:07:52] she's different oh she's different
[2:07:57] i've never seen a guy like that he's
[2:07:59] different there's just something about
[2:08:01] him he will
[2:08:08] but that's the age we are living in
[2:08:11] that's the age we are living in
[2:08:14] where our life is under surveillance
[2:08:19] the devil
[2:08:21] assign his demons and and and uh
[2:08:25] uh
[2:08:27] you wash that one
[2:08:30] he's a son of god
[2:08:32] she's a daughter of god
[2:08:36] and at the same time
[2:08:38] the angels of the lord
[2:08:41] i ain't come about them
[2:08:44] that fear his name
[2:08:48] praise the lord
[2:08:50] was it not in the age of elijah
[2:08:57] that seven eyes were open to see the
[2:08:59] angels that was on top of the mountain
[2:09:05] because he was associated to a larger
[2:09:07] ministry
[2:09:11] if god would just open our eyes
[2:09:19] if he would just open our eyes
[2:09:22] people young people we will have no
[2:09:24] reason to compromise his word
[2:09:27] [Music]
[2:09:29] for fleshly things
[2:09:30] for perishable things
[2:09:34] because right in the time of the drought
[2:09:37] that's when the weather woman and her
[2:09:39] son
[2:09:41] experienced the miracle
[2:09:43] their sock never went dry the oil never
[2:09:47] finished from the gallon
[2:09:49] it was in the time of the drought
[2:10:02] the devil brings ten thousand questions
[2:10:04] to our minds
[2:10:06] but how what's about this how about this
[2:10:09] how about this
[2:10:11] and pretty soon our mount is our minds
[2:10:13] are so flooded
[2:10:18] we've thought that we take our god from
[2:10:19] in our eyes
[2:10:24] then we start to question
[2:10:28] but god that is rich in mercy
[2:10:34] he comes by and give you a little grace
[2:10:38] and do something later around your life
[2:10:42] just to tell you i'm always there
[2:10:46] i promise to never leave you
[2:10:49] to never forsake you
[2:10:52] yes
[2:10:54] do you love him this morning
[2:10:58] praise the lord
[2:11:02] musicians you can come
[2:11:07] musicians you can come
[2:11:21] we are getting in the time church
[2:11:27] we are getting in the time
[2:11:32] where more and more is
[2:11:35] is proving to us
[2:11:36] that satan is the god of this evil age
[2:11:44] and
[2:11:45] the governments of the world is right in
[2:11:47] his hands
[2:11:50] praise the lord
[2:11:52] but we know whose hands we are in
[2:11:56] amen
[2:11:58] he's holding us in his hands he has
[2:12:01] written our names in the palm of his
[2:12:03] hands
[2:12:05] praise the lord
[2:12:13] we can never know god by knowledge
[2:12:17] there is no no amount of preaching i can
[2:12:20] read all the quotes
[2:12:22] and i can read the different definition
[2:12:24] of all of god's attributes
[2:12:26] that was one of the things that struck
[2:12:28] me in the office as i was i was studying
[2:12:31] i just closed my book and i just prayed
[2:12:35] we can never know god by knowledge
[2:12:40] [Music]
[2:12:52] we know god by revelation
[2:12:55] [Music]
[2:12:59] it please the father
[2:13:01] to reveal himself
[2:13:05] and the way you know god
[2:13:08] that's the way you're going to serve him
[2:13:16] if it's a god that you have to appease
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:22] you're going to be involved in works and
[2:13:25] works and works and works
[2:13:28] making sacrifices bringing offerings
[2:13:35] but if it's a god that you love
[2:13:40] and realize that he looked beyond all
[2:13:43] your thoughts
[2:13:44] and he saw your needs
[2:13:46] [Music]
