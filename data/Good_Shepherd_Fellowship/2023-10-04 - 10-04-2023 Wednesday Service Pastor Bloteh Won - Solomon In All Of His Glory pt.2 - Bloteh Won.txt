that song we really did a good job on their one amen amen thank God I didn't spot it praise the Lord thank you musicians let's let's take our Bibles and go straight to the Book of Matthew chapter uh 6 Matthew chapter 6 on uh uh Sunday we read from Luke but we reading the same uh the same account uh uh uh we reading the same account uh that we read I'm going to continue in a little bit Solomon in all of his glory that's why we spoke on uh on Sunday uh we read Luke account of what Jesus said is uh it's as much as the same as what Matthew was saying here in uh chapter 6 so let's uh let's just go to uh Matthew chapter 6 praise the Lord amen amen let's read Matthew chapter 6 verse 28 Matthew chap 6 verse 28 if uh I'm right yet Matthew 628 praise the Lord verse 28 and why take ye thought of remen consider the ladies of the field how they grow they told all that needle do they Spain and yet I said unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not a ra like one of these praise the Lord let us pray tonight heavenly father almighty God we we just want to thank you precious Lord we we glorify your name tonight and we pray to God that you would just bless us now father as we go right into your word in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat and uh talking about uh raymen yes Solomon in all of his glory is uh uh is not a read like one of these what what considered raymen and uh as as we're praying for brother brother je BBE one of the one of the sisters after we spoke on the the message uh uh uh the T the hand of Jehovah I will just sharing with you what uh I experienced Lord visiting him and uh uh a sister had a dream and and uh and told me about it you know in dream and uh uh brother J BBE was thanking the church for praying for him and he says he was going home to change his clothes and uh and to come back to service and so when she told me that I said well uh uh it's to me it sounds like a good dream it sounds like a spiritual dream but there are there are too many here in my mind uh not an interpretation but just too many here in my mind of the change of clothes is either the person is changing from Health from sickness to health or they are changing from morar to immortality I said that's the two things that that is on my mind as I listening to what you are telling me so we just place it before the Lord whichever changing we still benefit amen amen so uh uh I just read this uh uh Solomon in all of his glory is not a real like one of them and so it came it come flashing back to my mind so uh uh we we were talking about this subject introducing on on uh on Sunday uh as we as we keep talking about the different things that the Lord is laying on our heart and uh I want to continue to go right into there U uh first king chapter 10 first king chapter 10 we want to read a little bit here so uh uh as we as we talk about this and uh uh we read in first king chapter 4 we we uh the scripture gave us a little bit of a picture of uh uh the the kind of for wealth that was around Solomon and we said that it was a type of the millennium it was a type of the Millennium uh Paul says eyes have not seen neither ears heard uh neither have it come to the heart of man what God have inore for them that love him praise the Lord but yet God in his word he has given us an idea let me say it that way he gave us a shadow he gave us an idea for us to just to imagine you know for us to be able to have a mental picture of what it would be be like so Solomon Reign was was one of those uh uh ideas uh uh as we would call it types but it was one of those ideas that God a picture that God was was trying to give us of how how the Millennium was going to be when the son of David sits upon his throne there's going to be peace everywhere there's going to be enough praise the Lord there's going to be enough because all that he want us to do is to just worship the lamb amen there will be enough so there there will just be no time for working and uh you know uh you can pack all your skills amen you can pack all your you know uh uh you know your degrees and different thing because you will not need it there there will just be enough praise the Lord so as we look through the scripture we see uh we see different we see different things and like I said Jesus you have to remember now Jesus is the one that is saying to his disciple amen knowing very well that Solomon was a type of him amen knowing very word you know thou son of David you have to remember the Jews had a hold on Jesus as that son of David praise the Lord but that that was for the Millennium so Jesus is the one year God in flesh the very same God that came down and and and spoke to the scripture says two times the Lord revealed himself to Solomon the first time he told Solomon I will I will bless thee because you have not asked me for the life of your enemy you have not asked me but you asked me for a Discerning Spirit I'm going to bless you with wisdom like no man have ever had praise the Lord like no man have ever had so Jesus here is now taking that and and and uh uh noring of how how how much Glory that was that was upon Solomon not only Solomon even the temple that he built you know like I said there there there have never been beside beside the melenia the only Temple that would beat Solomon Temple will be the millennial Temple amen because the millennial Temple will be built by the truth son of David Jesus Christ amen so is going to beat Solomon Temple praise the Lord now so Jesus was the one year that is taking this and he's saying that uh uh uh uh Solomon in all of his glory in all of his glory now the major thing that is that that grabed my attention to this it was when we were talking about the Tabernacle we're talking about the uh uh the Temple of Solomon and uh and and the beauty beside all the the gold like we said the outside part of the Tabernacle was M with with bries the inside PA were factioned with gold and all the tables and cheers and Thrones and everything was sitting in saver and uh uh uh uh and but the beauty of that Temple was the glory of God praise the Lord the beauty of that Temple was to see the glory that departed you have to remember in the Bible you know what ining the time of Eli the the the glory of God departed in so much that that the Philistines have to take the Ark of the Covenant away Eli fell right off his seat and died his sons were killed in battle the glory That Glory that departed came back amen and it came back in a visible form and the people could see the glory that that was was the the the greatest thing the greatest thing of of Solomon Temple and that's what that's what I want to go to that's what I'm asking the Holy Ghost to to carry me and uh uh uh for that because uh the the thing here is that uh you know uh uh when Jesus when he taught us how to pray the Lord's Prayer and wave the kingdom the power and what the glory the kingdom the power and the glory that's where we are going with with this with this subject that we are dealing with because that's that's what it's all about that's what it's all about you miss that you miss the whole picture the reason why he brings us together is because of his Kingdom his power and His glory that's what we are here for tonight praise the Lord that's what heaven me that's why Christ went through Calvary that's why God sent a prophet are we together so you see Jesus brought that he brought it over to the disciples because uh uh he wanted to get their attention from uh from from from the e Glory he wanted to get their attention from all of the things that our eyes our mind our flesh and everything is attracted to and he want them also to be able to see that beyond the things that we we are seeing the things that we don't see there is a glory there is a glory are we together amen there is a glory praise the Lord Beyond how many of us are in church tonight and uh H uh the songs that is sang The Young World whatever the preacher will preach tonight you I mean uh we can we can we can be caught in the channel to be able to understand what he says and everything but beyond all of that there is a glory there is a glory and and that is what God want us to break into when the church ever gets to the place of experiencing the kingdom the power and the glory every service is a wonderful service even if we don't preach if we don't preach a message the people can stay steps into the glory praise the Lord amen there is a glory and for us to also realize that each and every one of us we carry a portion of that Glory that's that's part of everything that we are going through that's part of all of our trials that's part of of uh of uh uh our our sickness that's part of our stumbling and everything there is a glory that is HD behind your Fallen flesh and if you can ever see that if it can ever be made known to you nothing in this life will matter to you nothing in this life will matter to you Isaiah said the Lord says I will share my glory with no man his glory belong to him and him alone God is very jealous of his glory he's very jealous of his glory so that's where we are traveling with this subject if the Holy Ghost can just help us we will get there amen if he don't help us we'll come back again and we'll try amen oh praise the Lord so we speak we we we spoke about uh uh Solomon glory and then Jesus over in Matthew 12 vers uh uh verse 42 he used another statement again when he said greater than Solomon is here praise the Lord speaking to to to to these Hebrews these Jewish people you know that are so caught up into uh uh uh you know their their their care for the temple and they always talk about the greatest rign the son of David you know and and they were hoping that that would come and he's telling them greater than Solomon is here praise the Lord amen so greater than Solomon we look at a little bit of there we we we realize that there was a birth that is greater than Solomon Jesus birth was a virgin birth amen amen Solomon birth was a woman that David Fell in with adultery and let her married before he was born praise the Lord and then God comes back again and give you the new birth it's greater than Solomon praise the Lord the new birth that you have is greater than Solomon if you you are born again you see that's the reason why the new birth is not an idea right the new birth is not a church membership the new birth is an experience are we together amen amen and then we says that uh uh uh uh uh uh greater in Solomon his Temple was greater than Solomon's Temple we spoke a a little bit about Solomon Temple and and the Bible says that uh uh uh when you when you read that the the the the scripture says the the the the the the throne know the temple yeah just like I said everything in the temple was made out of gold it was not painted gold it was made out of gold praise the Lord amen that's the reason why you you you see when when when uh when Nebuchadnezzar when they looted that Temple praise the Lord Babylon become rich just from looting Solomon's Temple right praise the Lord just imagine all of these foreigners enter right there you never been in war you maybe you but we saw a little bit of looting that was done around the city here during all of our time of Crisis you mean those gu bomb right into this into the temple they were they were surprised God I think they were even breaking the the the ground to pick up God never seen God like that before praise the Lord but Jesus said greater than Solomon if he's greater than Solomon then his Temple is greater than Solomon Temple praise the Lord and you are the temple of God praise the Lord yes sir and and the Bible says the Throne of Solomon was made of gold and and two golden Lions I mean my goodness me you just think about that think about that all the nations around Syria ter and Egypt they were just sending God everything that Solomon needed was supplying but if Jesus is good greater than Solomon like I said then his throne is also greater than Solomon's Throne praise the Lord amen and his throne is in our hearts his throne is in our hearts that God the creator of Heaven and Earth that said the heaven is his throne the Earth Is His full stone he can doell in Temple made with hands but a body he will prepare for himself that's why he brings us through the stages of Grace Church this is not an idea is an experience God is bringing a people through the stages of Grace to dwell in them to Res them on their hearts amen are we together now so we were looking at all of this so as we look into uh uh 1 King chapter 10 tonight let's read a little bit here and uh the Bible here will start about the the the Queen of Sheba now you have to realize when Jesus was talking about a greater than Solomon it was this woman how how she left Ethiopia and travel because she heard about the wisdom of Solomon praise the Lord amen and brother Brown will describe that or dramatized that how she went through the desert and people try to discourage her and says oh god there there there are white beasts on the on on the road uh uh you you will destroy yourself you know it's it's very dangerous for you to travel that way but she did not mind what they were saying she heard about the wisdom of Solomon she wanted to get there praise the Lord am and she was not just only going for sightseing she had questions praise the Lord and Jesus is picking up the testimony of this woman and challenging this generation he challenged that generation and he's challenging this generation that if that woman can come from the sound to hear the wisdom of Solomon we don't have an excuse this things must never be an excuse amen weather must not be our excuse crisis must not be at our excuse praise the Lord no matter what we are going through we must be able to go and meet the greater than Solomon praise the Lord amen we must be able to get over our HS we must be able to get there so he's using that so I thought a little bit that we would just read uh uh uh first king chapter 10 year small the Bible says and when the Queen of Sheba heard of the firm of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to prove him with hard questions praise the Lord she came to prove him with her questions brother bam says we we must never come to the to to to to to the house of God empty we must come with expectations we must come with expectations we must come brother Braham says we must ask God for big things we must ask him for hard things H amen and she came to Jerusalem w a very great train with camels that bear spices and and very much gold she brought gold and precious stone she coming to add to the the enough gold that he already had she's bringing more gold are we together and when and uh when she was come to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart and Solomon told her all her questions praise the Lord amen the gift of discernment like I said that was what listen to the scripture the Bible didn't say Solomon answer all her questions Solomon told her right all her questions but alesco said I have three questions to ask William Brandon he said I had three questions he said what I start with brother brandham brother brandham told me my three questions praise the Lord he said brother Bram told him his questions if a man can tell you your questions he should have the answer right right if he can tell tell you the question that you have in your heart then definitely he should have the answer and Solomon told her all her questions there was not anything hid from the King which he tore her not are we together amen praise the Lord and when the Queen of Sheba have have seen all Solomon wisdom and the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendants of his ministers and their appear the way they were dress that Parable where Jesus gave at the wedding supper where men are handed Rob that Parable came from here before you go into the the king's heart they gave you special close to word right amen we read that in in in in 1 King chapter 4 a parel was given to them they had to dress right and we must also dress right to come to the house of God Amen because we are coming to down with the King praise the lord we must dress right to come to the house of God praise the Lord so when she saw out of that his cup Bearer and uh and his asking by which he went up into the house of the Lord there was no more spirit in her when she just saw the order she saw the order people were not just moving here and there no everything was done in order this this was a queen she also have a kingdom praise the Lord and sometimes that's that's what happened I mean as a pastor you go you you travel somewhere and and you just see the people how they respect the church order and and and the worship you sit down you say oh God that that even happened to brother Brandon you read one of one of his Paradox message he says I went into a church and I saw how how he said the other that I saw I said oh God longed to look for the church where everything is in order he says and whenever we get to that place whenever we will get to that place he says sin cannot stay under that atmosphere he said the spirit is going to pick it up right away praise the Lord when she saw the other she saw the the the dress code and and everything the way it was said now you think about it now all of these things things is in the natural yeah in her mind she's thinking what kind of a wisdom it was the same wisdom that laid the stars in the heavens that gave every Star their position it was that same just a little bit of their God in there Solomon wave praise the Lord the same wisdom that constructed us that put the organs of our body together praise the Lord the wisdom that makes you that when you look in the in the mirror you like yourself if you don't like yourself you have a problem I can't help you with that one praise the Lord amen when she look at all of that the Bible say she did not have spirit in her she was mind blown how not just people talking across the A and people doing things that they're not supposed to do no and it was not even like it was drama it was it's almost like you go the first day you see the distance and you sit down you say okay let me see tomorrow what will happen you come back the next day you see the same thing everybody that comes they come in order they are giving their Rob they are dress they take their seat everything is done the Bible say she had no spirit in her she had no spirit in her she was she was overwhelmed my goodness man how she wished that she could she could h h h h have such an order in her kingdom but she didn't have the god of Solomon praise the Lord she didn't have the god of Solomon she didn't have that the grace that Solomon had at a time to have such an order in his kingdom are we together she said verse six and she said to the king it was a truth report that I heard in my own land of thy arts and thy wisdom how be it I believe it not I believe not the words until I came and my eyes have seen it and behold the half was not told me meaning that what I have seen now praise the Lord was more than what they told me praise the Lord so the the people that were saying they never even came half and you can think about it because they never went into the into the king's uh h h h h chamber they never went into his Palace so they couldn't tell her all of those things she was a queen so she had a right to go there those guys were just talking about what they saw around the town right but because she was a queen she could go into the palace so she SE more she saying the half of the story right was not told that was what that was that that is where that song came from amen we sing it yeah the half is not told that's where the the the writer of that song I believe God is inspiration from amen whoever Ro praise the Lord she said sister the have was not told me that wisdom and prosperity exceeded the frame which I heard now see what she says now happy are the men happy are these that seven which stand continuously before thee and that year thy wisdom praise the Lord and Jesus is saying greater than Solomon is he praise the Lord amen if this if if if if the queen you see why why Jesus used that and say she will condemn this generation she stood in the presence of Solomon and she says the people that are always in service they must be happy the people that always come in your pres to have the opportunity to be in your presence how can they live with sad faces how can they leave with questions on their mind what are they doing what are they not making use of the gift that you have I never even said one word to you you told me all my questions that I had if the greater than Solomon is here the Holy Ghost it must do the same to you and we can we should never come in the house of God with sad faces sir we must go better than how we came because they're greater than Solomon is here yes amen she saying Happy Blessed are these people that stand before you continuously they are seeing these things but you see what happened it becomes so common to us when we are there all the time when we are there all the time it becomes so common she's saying these people should be happy they are thinking like oh we have seen it all praise the Lord amen right maybe they were even guessing tomorrow he's he's he's wearing he's wearing Rose maybe Rose he wear Rose just bet me he will wear rose right praise the Lord amen and sometimes that's the way we want to treat the house of God it becomes like a common place to us in that way we lose our expectations yeah we just come dragging our feet barely trying it to make it a church looking for some Entertainer to entertain us for us to get happy when we supposed to come with expectation I was glad when he said let us go to the house of the Lord that what David said I was glad I was happy are we together and she was a queen that came from the South but the one that God has called to year his wisdom his predestinated children amen and you are called his bride yes sir praise the Lord you are called his bride that is the thing that destroyed relationship when when when when a bride stands to not not not not Mo expense of loose respect when the word of confidence when she starts to L confidence in the words of the bridegroom praise the Lord right amen when we start to lose confidence I mean when we look at our our our eff and natural relationship well yeah there are some things that sometimes people do and then you question it and you'll talk about it but that should that is not compared you see because sometimes when we talk these things it's so easy for us to fall in the natural and then we miss the the the spiritual aspect we are talking about our bridegroom Jesus Christ is there a reason why we must not have confidence in his word is there something that we going through in our life that we think that because we are going through this I can't believe God word anymore no sir praise the Lord happy are these men happy at these that seven we stand continuously before thee and that and I hear thy wisdom blessed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of Israel because the Lord love Israel forever praise the Lord she seeing such a wisdom making it so easy for her to believe in God God Of Heaven and Earth because no matter who what God she was worshiping what religion she believe she beli in she has come to believe that there is a greater power right amen there's a greater power because there cannot be order without an intelligence behind it amen there cannot be other that's the reason why all this B bang and evolution is just is just a trash there cannot be an other without an intelligence behind it every design the design of your clothes that you wear you see it you like it there is an intelligence that put it together right and that's what she was saying for the order that she have seen and and and and and the glory that she have seen she has come to believe that there is an intelligence called the god of Israel are we together all people we must not allow these things to become common to us we must not allow it to become common that's the reason why that prophet of God said that just one one one one message he says uh you know uh he said it's not a fair thing that we must be preached to all the times and there are people that have never heard the gospel once because it should take just one experience in God's presence to affect our life that we can we can never be the same and that's what the new birth brings that's what the new birth brings when that experience affect our life we can never be the same we might go through trials we might go through sicknesses even onto death but we will never be the same are we together Jesus says consider the lady and he ended there with that with that uh h h h famous statement seek ye first the kingdom of God and all of his righteousness and I told you on Sunday th word seek you know uh uh uh it it has been it has been so driving through the ages that it looks like we we we need to find the most brightest touch light and be looking around you can't seek the kingdom the Kingdom Come seeking you right the kingdom k to seek you you cannot seek the kiddom praise the Lord amen you can't seek the kingdom the kingdom was the one that sought you now that the kingdom has sought you what you are called to do is to discover discover that's why we call Revelation discover let me tell let me ask you a question we get cell phones we get 5G I don't know the next G that will come up we get all of these things that are now in the word let me ask you a question when did when did they came on Earth as long as the Earth has exist they were year that's right right they were here when Adam and Eve was here 5G was here right right whatever we are having as mod invention was already here men discovered them right they never brought it to Earth it was yeah and Men discover every truth in the Bible has always been in the Bible the sepy was here the the seals were here the church Ages were here they were already here amen and God sent his men and through Revelation they break into those things and they bring us the truth of God so that that seeking concept that seeking concept is not the thought of oh you got to get the doctrine right oh you got to get the church order right because that's the way our mind goes all the the Bible says seeking first the kingdom of God and all of his righteousness our mind goes in a form of seeking looking for something we not supposed to be looking we're supposed to be admiring the things that are around us admiring the thing that God is doing in your life appreciating it that his grace can keep me his grace can wake me up that he can bring me down to my knees to pray you s supposed to be appreciating there that's right wow where my life would have been if it was not the grace of God yes sir thank you Lord praise the Lord you cannot find the kingdom if God do not give it to you you can find it right Jesus told Nicodemus the same until you are born again you cannot see the of God you can't find it yes sir so you can run to all the message Church you want to go to seeking the kingdom you will not find it right because that kingdom is right in you and until you start looking to yourself and appreciating the thing that the grace of God is doing in your life every day amen seeking the kingdom is not understanding the Myster of the Bible there are men that can spin your hair with this Bible they can spin your hair they can take out things in this Bible but yet they don't know anything about the Kingdom right right they can carry you to the Greek and bring you back to the Latin and bring you back to the Hebrew and all of that Jesus said you being chief of the Pharisees you don't know what it means to be born again he was singing about going back into his mother womb praise the Lord seek he first the kingdom of God and I told you when you find the kingdom when you find the kingdom the next thing comes to pass power the next comes to Glory that's the reason why the church is far from its reality the church is very far from its reality we talk about the seals is open we talk about the mystery of God God sent a prophet yet and still we are still far we are living under our privilege the things that we must be enjoying like like children of God we have reduced it to all material things right we have reduced it to all material things praise the Lord amen that as that as a Son of God the devil will use those very things and then he afflect all with with with depression he afflect us with different things in our lives right it's because we are not discovering the glory we are not discovering Jesus says that they said the kingdom of God he said don't look here don't look that that kingdom is in you praise the Lord everything everything everything the driverless car the astronauts and everything Atomic B everything that they are making they are not bringing it from somewhere else they it was always here man is just discovering the Earth right they are discovering the Earth in we came from out of the earth so which mean also we can discover ourself we can discover our potential our abilities but you see the Devil Keep keep us away from ourself he makes other people our focus when you cannot when you cannot change those people lives when you when you cannot you cannot be like them he take you away from yourself and to look at your abilities right no matter what it is the man new creative power in you that you can be able to take a pen and write a p you can be able to take a pen and even write your own prayers your your the desire of your heart to be able to set it down and write it what we read in some is David prayer right oh oh Lord my God in you I trust we read that and we recite it but it was a man just like you right that was expressing his heart to God seeking first the kingdom of God Amen Solomon in all of his glory and you read down here I mean uh uh uh I I just I just stop here this another part of this uh chapter I wanted to go in it starts to talk about chapter 14 now the word of God that came to Solomon in one year 63 scores and six talents of gold that came to him just in one year and it's all of those things all of those things praise the Lord are we together so I didn't open my bottle I'm bringing it now you think about it think about it with with with the wealth that was in Solomon's uh uh Kingdom the wealth that was in solom Mon kdom and all the glory that was around this man think about it it's it's so it's so mysterious yet there were poor people that were in the Land There were people that was that was that was in need that's that's another face of this I I was going to bring to you uh uh because if you see what happened right after Solomon left and his son ream came praise the Lord because because you you see that's that that is the thing with with with wealth if you have it you got to keep it up that's the reason why the the the the man that has a he want more money because you got to keep it up and all of that but that's not what I want to go in tonight I'm just talking about Solomon in all of his glory and the brother Bram said yet as we as we read on on Sunday I'm going back to my to my my notes here on Sunday position in Christ he says we we should be so on fire of fire for God we should be goinging day and night nothing should be able to stop us and we should be so sweet so pleasant so kind so Christlike in our life it take everyday life Jesus said consider the lady of the field how it grows everyday life every day we must be looking for a growth every day it looks like every day we look for where we have filed the Lord then where his grace has helped us praise the Lord it looks like we driving this vehicle looking in the RAR view mirror and that's why we have in all of these scratches we have to be looking to him that is the Altar and the finisher of our faith how it grows tall and spin yet I said unto you Solomon in all of his glory is not a ray like one Solomon had robs that was RA with glorious skin and needle work in things but that wasn't what he was talking about see brother brother is saying that Jesus was not he was trying to get the people away from the physical glory to make them to see that the thing that was making the go to shine is the intelligence behind it praise the Lord the thing that was making the the the temple to be beautiful it was the glory than just the natural go and brid and saor the glory that was Hing in the in in the in in the temple but the people were admiring the the the go they were admiring the BR they were admiring the expensive thing but they were not seeing the glory right they were not seeing the glory that's the reason why when the glory departed Babylonians came men that were that were drunkers they would take the The Vessel of God to drink in it right praise the Lord that's what that's what happen when we are not seeing the glory then we subject ourself to to useless thoughts and useless things and and and and and and when when men are not seeing the the glory that is Hing in their life you give yourself to drugs and alcohol and sex and all of that enjoyment of life it goes away one night the next day you need it it was not the God it was not the all the sheers of gold and the Thousand sheeps and the Rob that he had it was the glory of God that came down just like the same Glory the people in the wilderness never had what Solomon had they were wearing the same clothes on their back that they came out of Egypt but the glory of God was there that it sustained their CLA the glory of God was down they never had a a medical facility but they had I'm the Lord that Health all your diseases and because the glory of God was in the camp they were drinking from uh from uh uh Branch water and all of that but God was keeping them healthy right are we together if we would just realize the glory of God that is Hing over our life that is Hing over our life that is keeping us healthy that is keeping us gring when we living in such a Time the prophet God says demon Spirits are streaming Up all In the Earth that menion dimensions of demon powers that science has given all sorts of scientific names for sicknesses right that the word has never seen before those are all demon powers praise the Lord that even some of the men that has the wealth of this word looking for where they can go to get healing and you are living in healing every day that's right every day you are living in healing praise the Lord right every day when you read the word of God you are taking in healing yes sir and yet we think it's a punishable life that we get so tired to read our Bible we think that it's a punishable life every day reading Bible every day Bible everyday Bible we think that it's a punishable life it's all because you have not seen the glory right you have not seen the glory you have not entered into it praise the Lord Solomon in all of his glory when he got down to idolatry with all of his wisdom to even know the question that were in the heart of a woman but yet he could not pick up the deception that were in the heart of all of those women that would lead him to to idolatry so what was God showing his glory was temporary his glory was temporary his knowledge was limited right even though there was no man that had knowledge like him yet his knowledge was limited it could not save him from adolat it could not help him to manage his 10,000 wives he had or thousand wives praise the Lord as the next part of that we were getting to are we together amen I was just I was talking to to a brother today that Pastor jam and we were talking about different thing I told him as as as Solomon had all of those wisdom but yet he couldn't handle women it don't take wisdom to handle women the Bible say husband love your wife didn't say be smart Solomon with all his wisdom he did not know how to handle a woman you have to know she has to make mystery of redemption you can't handle her by wisdom you have to handle her by the love of God praise the Lord if I can just get through one cot almost out of my time here tonight that was exactly where I stopped on Sunday so I don't know if I'm going to ever go any further than this that wasn't what he was talking about in order for the lady to grow a had to to both day and night praise the Lord like brother Bram like brother Bram would say you know like brother Bram would say you know I was when I was down over in Daisy uh we were over to uh uh uh one of the sisters house there she cooked some food so she cook uh uh uh she had a lot of lot of seful you know something kind of a seafood dish that she did so uh uh uh the uh the brothers some of the brothers they were you know they were just talking about CBE and talking about different things and you know all clams on and all of that I I don't even know why people eat that thing I I don't know what they eat so I told them I said I said to them I'm a man from the sea Co praise the Lord amen that's where my jam from even though I didn't grew up there but that's that's where my jam from my dad was a fisherman so I told him I say I says let me tell you anyway let me tell you something you know what brother BR said about taking the the the teaspoon of the ocean water he says every mineral that is in that ocean is in this teaspoon praise the Lord everything that the ocean I say so you see you see the the the the the the the the seafood that's what it has the the reason why the people that love SE the reason why they love it or the reason why they should love it is because of the mineral that it contains from under the ocean praise the Lord you find people that just spend their time on eating SE because they believe that in eating SE they will get the Min R out of it so like talks about the lady that it tolds in the mud he said that lady in the mud what is it doing with even though it's a dirty water it's a Moy water but but the lady spreads out her root to go and get the best substance the be best mining from the earth for that lady to be able to put out a flower where all the bees would come around to to pull from in the midst of the Dead water she's spreading out her root not caring what kind of a Messes in the water but she wants to get the mineral out of the earth she wants to get something valuable praise the Lord the only reason why you will fight a good Christian fight is because you believe that I have a more value out of this yes sir praise the Lord if you don't see the value I mean it's it's just a matter of time just the matter of time you will get on the shelf right all the men that have fought with all of their life is because they realize that there is a value the man that spend time in the word and in prayer in the presence of God they want to behold the glory of the Lord like David said inquire in his Temple I'm not just satisfied being a church member and just sitting in church and going home I want to behold the glory of God I want when I'm hearing the word of God let another music be speaking in my ear let me hear the sound of Heaven amen praise the Lord I'm not only tickle when they say brother Bram said no I hear more than what brother abam said I hear the voice of God yes sir I know it is full for my soul yes sir or if you ever get the attitude praise the Lord amen when when uh when you you you you ever at a place where a good food is cooking and then you feel sleeping praise the Lord you know when you fall asleep you go into me say what do you do oh you try to kick their sleep away that's what a Son of God or a daughter of God do you come to church right if you if you consider the word of God food for your soul you won't sit there and sleep and and be knocking your no you will stand up to your feet you'll go outside and get water to drink because I want to get this thing that's the reason why I'm here I'm not just here to show up I want my time in the house of God to be something I enjoy I must enjoy it because if you are not enjoying it it's just the matter of time you will fold up you will find an excuse not to come right true you must be able to enjoy it praise the Lord if I'm not making you to enjoy then get me I'll bring the right man in praise the Lord I have no problem get me out if I'm not if I'm not giving you the word that you must be enjoying then bring the right man in that's that's what it should be if now we've just becoming a denomination we just holding up a name we will we will not break into the glory we will not break into the glory we will be affected by seasons one time we are up another time we are down they said and and I mean that's that's not what it's supposed to be we must be going from glory to glory from glory to glory he's changing me praise the Lord from glory to glory he's changing me Hallelujah Jesus said the queen of of the South we condemn this generation but she can't stand to the bride she cannot stand before the bride amen because all she saw of Solomon was temporary and what we are seeing of Christ is interal right our glory is internal our glory is not temporary we
