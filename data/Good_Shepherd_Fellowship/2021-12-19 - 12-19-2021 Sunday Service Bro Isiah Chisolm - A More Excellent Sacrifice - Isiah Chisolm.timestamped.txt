[33:56] name of the lord jesus
[33:58] and uh
[33:59] good to see
[34:00] the grace of god on your faces and uh
[34:04] it's good to know that we have people
[34:06] that we can stand with and worship our
[34:09] king
[34:10] and and serve the lord god
[34:13] that
[34:19] praise the lord
[34:21] this morning we got a call that uh
[34:23] sister mimi is now feeling well she was
[34:26] rushed back to the hospital
[34:28] and uh
[34:30] it's pretty a little bit serious
[34:32] situation so we we we had the
[34:36] uh the deacons back there then into the
[34:39] office praying so we want to just keep
[34:42] our house before the lord
[34:44] that the lord will will be able to
[34:47] to bring our sister true amen
[34:50] praise the lord
[34:51] and
[34:54] the doctors
[34:55] i call into sister geraldine actually
[34:58] said that she might not be able to get
[34:59] through
[35:00] because of the situation there's a
[35:02] procedure that issue
[35:05] do on her body
[35:07] but
[35:09] her body is pretty weak for them to be
[35:11] able to carry out their procedures so
[35:14] and uh
[35:16] [Music]
[35:17] they asked whether they could pull the
[35:19] plugs and sister jordan said no
[35:22] and uh so uh
[35:24] uh that shows how serious the situation
[35:27] is
[35:28] but we serve almighty god that we have
[35:30] just sank about amen
[35:33] we suffered marty also we are believing
[35:36] this morning that god
[35:38] is in total control
[35:40] amen
[35:42] he's in complete control hallelujah
[35:46] amen
[35:47] and uh i mean if he please the lord to
[35:49] take her home we have another witness of
[35:52] one that was in our midst that have gone
[35:54] across amen so whichever way we are on
[35:57] the winning side but we are believing
[35:59] that the lord will be able to bring her
[36:01] truth
[36:02] praise the lord
[36:04] amen
[36:05] and uh
[36:07] yesterday we made a little comment here
[36:09] just at the end of the service
[36:11] and i want to read
[36:14] romans chapter 12
[36:20] just to back up that that coming
[36:24] romans chapter 12 the apostle paul said
[36:26] i beset you therefore brethren by the
[36:28] mercy of god
[36:29] their year present your body
[36:33] a living sacrifice
[36:35] holy acceptable unto the lord
[36:38] which is your reasonable service
[36:40] reasonable service means that is the
[36:42] most that you can do so just like i said
[36:45] yesterday
[36:47] is is this this this uh uh phrase
[36:50] presents your body
[36:52] now you see uh uh all the bible says
[36:56] present your body
[36:58] the way we understand it is prepare your
[37:01] body
[37:02] no the bible says present your body
[37:06] make yourself available that's all god
[37:08] is saying
[37:09] you know
[37:10] make yourself available
[37:13] and
[37:15] [Music]
[37:17] you know so
[37:21] the more we
[37:22] we make ourselves available
[37:25] the more we present ourselves for
[37:27] worship
[37:28] the more we say lord yeah i am
[37:31] yeah i am i'm i'm just i'm just i'm just
[37:35] here

[37:41] couch take me from here into your
[37:44] presence and take me from here into what
[37:46] you want to do what you want to achieve

[44:40] you know
[44:42] like paul says he says every joint
[44:45] supply that's how the body
[44:48] of god works that's our that's how our
[44:51] human body works so the the spiritual
[44:53] body works that way where every joint
[44:56] supply
[44:57] and uh
[44:59] [Music]
[45:02] you know the the preacher
[45:04] he prays and he he prepared himself
[45:08] then pretty soon he gets a burden that
[45:10] comes upon his heart
[45:12] in a form of a message
[45:15] he have it taught
[45:16] but he really don't have
[45:19] everything because he don't know
[45:22] you know how the service is going to go
[45:24] then he's trusting the lord and because
[45:26] of that he gets very nervous he gets
[45:29] very heavy
[45:30] and then he comes and and and then the
[45:33] people starts to pull the people starts
[45:35] to unload him everybody is reaching out
[45:38] and and taking something from the word
[45:42] and then after the service the preacher
[45:44] gets very tired of taking brother ajaya
[45:46] home yesterday last night and tried to
[45:49] get something for him to eat and and i'm
[45:51] talking about myself he fell asleep i
[45:53] look over i said oh my goodness this guy
[45:55] is tired praise the lord
[45:57] and and that's what what happened the
[46:00] preacher
[46:01] released the burden and now you take the
[46:03] burden home the word now becomes your
[46:06] burden you have to take it home you have
[46:08] to leave it you have to step into the
[46:10] victory the healing of that word it
[46:12] becomes your burden
[46:14] so uh
[46:16] so the lord gives it to the preacher and
[46:18] then he gives it to the people and then
[46:20] you take it out and then he leave it
[46:22] through us so uh
[46:24] we signed a song yesterday
[46:28] uh
[46:30] that was that was just the
[46:32] the first part of the song
[46:34] and we are the children of god

[46:39] uh the the south african words there

[48:03] the words on the ball make you nervous
[48:06] amen

[48:18] interpretation of what you are thinking

[1:07:44] never did
[1:07:45] god always wanted the holy spirit to run
[1:07:49] the church

[1:08:46] and abel was a keeper of the sheep
[1:08:49] but cain was a tiller of the ground
[1:08:54] and in the process of time
[1:08:56] that mean time went on
[1:08:58] time brings
[1:09:00] changes
[1:09:01] that's right
[1:09:02] and in the process of time it came to
[1:09:05] pass that cain
[1:09:06] brought of the fruit of the ground
[1:09:09] an offering
[1:09:10] unto the lord
[1:09:12] and abel
[1:09:14] he also brought of the first link of his
[1:09:17] flock

[1:09:24] and to his
[1:09:26] offering
[1:09:28] verse five but unto cain
[1:09:31] and his offering
[1:09:33] he had not respect
[1:09:36] and cain was very wroth
[1:09:39] and his countenance fell
[1:09:43] and the lord said unto cain
[1:09:46] why
[1:09:48] are thou wroth
[1:09:51] and why
[1:09:53] is thy continuous
[1:09:54] falling

[1:16:40] play but one sister came up and i she
[1:16:43] just kind of stood still so i came down

[1:16:50] he came on our level he he know what it
[1:16:53] feels like amen and i came down with his
[1:16:55] sister was that i said my sister i said

[1:17:14] nothing to grip onto
[1:17:17] she
[1:17:17] we lost connection
[1:17:19] somehow she got around somebody and and
[1:17:22] and she got discouraged
[1:17:25] you know she got discovered she got
[1:17:26] tired of going to church she got tired
[1:17:29] of hearing music songs after song same
[1:17:32] sermons
[1:17:33] you get tired you get weird oh he
[1:17:36] preached that before
[1:17:37] well how many times listen to the
[1:17:39] prophet messing every time you hear
[1:17:41] something different yeah that's right
[1:17:43] well you know the same old same when we
[1:17:45] we come in the church and that's the
[1:17:47] attitude that people get they come to
[1:17:48] church they don't look for nothing
[1:17:50] they they come they come to just say
[1:17:53] okay god i've been to church

[1:17:57] no more the week i'm i'm going home i've
[1:17:59] been to church but that that type of

[1:27:53] when you you you look at the word

[1:27:59] 11 and 4. that's where we withdraw our
[1:28:02] thought from this morning it's hebrews
[1:28:05] 11
[1:28:06] and 4.
[1:28:10] hallelujah hebrews 11 and 4.
[1:28:17] my
[1:28:20] y'all pray with me
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:23] hallelujah
[1:28:25] so much the glory of

[1:28:31] let's go back there now we we want the
[1:28:33] holy spirit to have full preeminence
[1:28:35] that's that is my prayer amen hebrews 11
[1:28:38] and 4.
[1:28:40] it says my thought comes from there by
[1:28:42] faith
[1:28:44] able offer unto god a more
[1:28:47] excellent yes
[1:28:49] sacrifice than cain so my thought this
[1:28:52] morning is
[1:28:53] a more
[1:28:54] excellent sacrifice when you you talk
[1:28:57] about
[1:28:58] more excellent
[1:29:00] i mean god is
[1:29:01] your sacrifice
[1:29:03] is great yes
[1:29:05] your sacrifice is fantastic
[1:29:08] your sacrifice is incredible
[1:29:12] that's right god says
[1:29:15] abel now understand that
[1:29:18] god didn't said abel i don't like your
[1:29:21] sacrifice it's terrible he didn't say
[1:29:23] that
[1:29:25] he said abel's sacrifice
[1:29:27] was more
[1:29:29] excellent
[1:29:32] than that of cain
[1:29:34] and we found out that
[1:29:37] we found out amen that
[1:29:40] cain
[1:29:42] and abel both boys
[1:29:44] was good church boys both boys would go
[1:29:47] to church
[1:29:48] both boys
[1:29:49] worship
[1:29:51] god amen
[1:29:53] and both boys
[1:29:56] will
[1:29:57] build an altar
[1:29:59] and i want to talk about
[1:30:03] consuming
[1:30:05] the sacrifice
[1:30:07] on the altar
[1:30:09] when it's consumed as meat is burnt
[1:30:12] that's right it's it's almost done away
[1:30:15] with it it's gone burnt
[1:30:18] and when you offer this sacrifice
[1:30:21] you want to burn it
[1:30:24] do away with it
[1:30:26] and
[1:30:28] in the old testament you you found how
[1:30:31] that they will offer up sacrifices unto
[1:30:34] the lord
[1:30:35] and we found out that
[1:30:38] when
[1:30:39] cain and abel offered their sacrifice
[1:30:41] unto the lord
[1:30:43] abel's sacrifice
[1:30:46] was more pleasing to god
[1:30:48] and lord that's my heart desire this
[1:30:51] morning
[1:30:53] lord i want to be pleasing
[1:30:55] in your sight
[1:30:58] i feel that this rapture
[1:31:01] is getting so close
[1:31:03] lord i want to be pleasing
[1:31:06] in your sight
[1:31:07] lord show me my wrongs
[1:31:09] amen yes
[1:31:12] you know you could be wrong in things
[1:31:13] you're not even realizing and nobody
[1:31:16] could tell you nothing
[1:31:17] lord if i'm wrong show me your god
[1:31:20] lord if if if i have a spirit
[1:31:23] if i got an arrogant spirit lord please
[1:31:26] help me
[1:31:29] lord if lord if i got a proud spirit on
[1:31:32] me
[1:31:33] lord help me
[1:31:35] god if i have a spirit that's tagging
[1:31:37] with me
[1:31:38] that seems like i can't get rid of it
[1:31:41] god help me
[1:31:43] because i'm getting ready
[1:31:45] to go in the present
[1:31:47] of the almighty god
[1:31:49] and when i bring my offering
[1:31:51] unto the lord i want my offering to be
[1:31:54] pleasing
[1:31:55] lord
[1:31:56] not because i come to church
[1:32:00] my pastors pastor warren
[1:32:02] lord i want to go beyond that
[1:32:05] i want to change heart
[1:32:07] i want my heart to change lord when i
[1:32:10] come to church don't let me leave but
[1:32:13] just don't let me be churchy
[1:32:16] just just churchy
[1:32:18] i remember back when i was a little boy
[1:32:20] i could tell my mom and all would go to
[1:32:22] church church had a a smell about it
[1:32:25] they my mama used to smell like
[1:32:27] peppermints that i knew they'd been to
[1:32:28] church a lot of people did this did they
[1:32:31] smell churchy
[1:32:33] but i i need something
[1:32:35] to go in the inside
[1:32:37] because
[1:32:39] i
[1:32:40] i talk about last night i was born in
[1:32:42] sin
[1:32:44] you were born in sin
[1:32:47] we was born with the wrong
[1:32:52] nature yes that's why job said i think
[1:32:56] uh job the 14th chapter says
[1:32:58] a man
[1:33:00] that is born of a woman
[1:33:02] is a few days
[1:33:04] i'm full of trouble
[1:33:06] without the lord we're in trouble
[1:33:09] we're just going to church but i found
[1:33:12] out over the years church look look how
[1:33:14] sacred it is
[1:33:16] you think about it church
[1:33:18] amen 2 million
[1:33:20] and a half came out of egypt
[1:33:23] two million and a half one out of a
[1:33:26] million
[1:33:27] and out of that
[1:33:29] only two of the original
[1:33:31] went in
[1:33:36] and all day i preach a message the day
[1:33:39] just before the flood
[1:33:42] and
[1:33:43] and i think and and i was telling my
[1:33:44] precious brother i said
[1:33:47] years ago i think about the scripture it
[1:33:49] said as it was in the days of noah so
[1:33:51] shall it be when the son of man would be
[1:33:53] revealed only what seven in order eight
[1:33:56] how many
[1:33:57] eight so noah was preaching seven that
[1:34:00] that small congregation but remember i
[1:34:02] believe it with all my heart as it was
[1:34:04] there i'm sure that there was a lot of
[1:34:07] people that was believing what noah was
[1:34:09] preaching
[1:34:10] but after a process of time things began
[1:34:13] to change the same it is today people
[1:34:15] are losing their joy
[1:34:16] and the love of many are whites and cold

[1:59:48] not giving credit to abraham but give me
[1:59:51] somebody that been with god ain't bad
[1:59:53] somebody say man that's why the greeks
[1:59:55] wanted to seek jesus who did they go to
[1:59:58] they went to those ignorance mans of god
[2:00:00] because those eager men knew exactly
[2:00:03] where jesus was at
[2:00:06] and see you need a man of god
[2:00:08] you need a man of god that knows exactly
[2:00:11] where he's at

[2:00:43] paul lamb just hollering and screaming
[2:00:45] and they were just pulling why was abel
[2:00:48] doing that
[2:00:49] because abel
[2:00:51] by revelation
[2:00:54] he knew it's going to take blood
[2:00:58] the boy didn't have a bible apparently
[2:01:01] told him about a bible amen but the boy
[2:01:04] got the animal and drug it to the altar
[2:01:07] brother brown to say mustard took a vine
[2:01:09] and put around his little neck and
[2:01:11] pulled it and threw it on the rock
[2:01:15] and he took that stone that pole animal
[2:01:17] just broke around and said it was like
[2:01:19] it was crying
[2:01:21] speaking in tongues
[2:01:22] that poland
[2:01:24] died on the altar
[2:01:26] they would cut it and blood and running

[2:14:06] build an altar
[2:14:07] wherever nor move he will build an altar
[2:14:10] moses would command joshua to build an
[2:14:14] altar
[2:14:15] build an altar
[2:14:16] lay stone building altar
[2:14:18] why why was the purpose
[2:14:21] for an altar
[2:14:25] they built an altar
[2:14:27] with that altar they would have
[2:14:29] relationship
[2:14:31] with god
[2:14:33] that uh that's why they build altars
[2:14:36] because they have relationship with god
[2:14:39] can i cannot speak foreign
[2:14:42] god will test us every son that cometh
[2:14:45] to god

[2:31:54] curtain back and told his son i said

[2:31:59] mike's i said

[2:35:11] here as you play
[2:35:13] for the one i remember and i wanted to
[2:35:15] say this lord to help me
[2:35:17] i started ministering
[2:35:20] i was
[2:35:21] 24 years old
[2:35:24] 1984 i start ministry we come from
[2:35:28] pentecost to the message
[2:35:30] i started preaching the message
[2:35:31] traveling
[2:35:32] things happen and i thank god what you
[2:35:34] say that's the anointing
[2:35:37] just because you got the anointing on me
[2:35:39] you changing the inside
[2:35:42] it brother brother brown blew my mind
[2:35:44] when he said you could have the genuine
[2:35:45] holy ghost and still die and go to hell
[2:35:47] how could you prophet how
[2:35:50] you don't you don't have the person you
[2:35:52] just got a new spirit but let me have
[2:35:54] the baptism the holy ghost in my soul
[2:35:57] i was preaching almost 29 years
[2:36:00] preaching traveling preaching
[2:36:04] 2013 i was at my local church on a
[2:36:08] friday night
[2:36:09] we was having prayer night
[2:36:11] i was on my knees praying to the lord
[2:36:14] praying crying out to the lord
[2:36:16] and the voice spoke to me
[2:36:19] and said the new birth
[2:36:21] no the bible the lord spoke to me and
[2:36:23] said accept the corner we fall into the
[2:36:26] ground and die i kept on praying sister
[2:36:29] he said accept the corner we fall into
[2:36:32] the ground and die
[2:36:33] i kept on praying it said accept the
[2:36:35] corner we
[2:36:37] fall into the ground and die
[2:36:39] so i was saying lord i hear you lord i
[2:36:42] hear you you got your ball and crossbow
[2:36:44] so i got up my brother
[2:36:46] and i sat beside the wall and i went to
[2:36:49] the gospel of john
[2:36:50] the 12th chapter
[2:36:52] where philip and andrew
[2:36:55] they wanted to see jesus
[2:36:58] and i'm afraid brother and sister
[2:37:00] millions of people brother brown said he
[2:37:03] saw what's left behind
[2:37:06] i'm afraid of people
[2:37:08] don't have the genuine holy ghost in
[2:37:11] their soul
[2:37:15] so the greeks
[2:37:17] there was good athletes
[2:37:19] they were they they wanted to see jesus
[2:37:22] they came to philip and andrew
[2:37:24] and philip and andrew
[2:37:26] took those greeks
[2:37:29] remember now those boys didn't had the
[2:37:31] holy ghost
[2:37:33] but somehow there was an instinct they
[2:37:36] knew where he was at
[2:37:37] let me tell you what i thank god the
[2:37:40] holy ghost led me to this message
[2:37:43] hallelujah glory to god
[2:37:47] now here's the part i want you to catch
[2:37:51] when those disciples took
[2:37:54] those greeks in the presence of jesus
[2:37:57] i don't know what jesus was doing but
[2:37:58] jesus must have looked brown
[2:38:00] and look at him
[2:38:02] he didn't say
[2:38:04] how did y'all heard about me y'all heard
[2:38:05] about the miracles
[2:38:07] did y'all hear about lazarus uh
[2:38:09] jericho's daughter
[2:38:11] oh y'all heard that i fed 5 000 no he
[2:38:14] wasn't interested in that
[2:38:16] look i'm not interested in you knowing
[2:38:18] about my past i want you to know about
[2:38:20] jesus
[2:38:22] you know i can tell you all day about
[2:38:25] the belt buck
[2:38:26] i can tell you about a sabine canyon but
[2:38:29] you need a personal experience yourself
[2:38:32] you need a new bird down in your soul
[2:38:36] don't leave until you know you got it
[2:38:39] cry for the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:38:45] jesus
[2:38:46] he told disciples
[2:38:49] this was he was interested in he says
[2:38:52] my hour has come
[2:38:55] he said my hour's coming
[2:38:57] where the son of man
[2:38:59] is going to be crucified
[2:39:01] y'all follow me and i think the first of
[2:39:03] the second verse he said
[2:39:06] accept the corner we
[2:39:08] fall into the ground
[2:39:10] and die
[2:39:13] except it died
[2:39:15] it abides alone
[2:39:19] a sister said one time to the past she
[2:39:22] said hard for me to die when everybody
[2:39:24] around me is living you got to shut
[2:39:27] everybody off
[2:39:28] and you got to die
[2:39:30] you got to completely ride
[2:39:33] you got the right church you got to stay
[2:39:35] there till you run your stinking way you
[2:39:39] got that rod then you got to be a
[2:39:41] resurrection it's got to be a new birth

[2:46:28] amen
[2:46:32] god has spoken
[2:46:37] let the church
[2:46:40] see
[2:46:42] amen
[2:47:06] hello bless you have your seat for a
[2:47:07] little while yeah
[2:47:10] we'll let you out
[2:47:14] we want to say we we count ourselves
[2:47:16] privilege
[2:47:18] and
[2:47:20] we think it's an honor for the lord
[2:47:23] to be able to speak to us in the way
[2:47:25] that he did this morning
[2:47:27] you know when when god allowed the storm
[2:47:29] to come or he allowed
[2:47:31] the wind to blow
[2:47:34] the wind is blowing and you see the
[2:47:37] trees are titting
[2:47:39] sometimes it looks funny sometimes it
[2:47:42] looks serious
[2:47:44] but that is god's way of
[2:47:47] allowing the roots
[2:47:49] to to get deeper in the earth
[2:47:52] and you see god built his people
[2:47:53] different i was talking to a preacher
[2:47:55] this morning
[2:47:57] and we were just we were just talking on
[2:47:58] different things
[2:48:00] and uh
[2:48:02] and you see god can give a preacher
[2:48:05] such a gift in such a way to carry
[2:48:07] himself
[2:48:09] there is a lot of humor that goes with
[2:48:11] it and he's preaching the word and and
[2:48:14] you know he frees with you and he said
[2:48:16] things and you laugh about it but you
[2:48:19] see it's god way of getting his word
[2:48:22] to the place he won in your life
[2:48:25] praise the lord
[2:48:26] maybe all that must stay in your mind is
[2:48:29] the laughter all he said is what
[2:48:32] but
[2:48:33] that's the word of god
[2:48:35] shifting and relaxing your spirit
[2:48:38] to be able to get that word down
[2:48:41] and then when you go home
[2:48:43] then he starts to deal with you
[2:48:45] and if you have an ear to hear
[2:48:48] you will hear what the spirit is saying
[2:48:51] praise the lord
[2:48:53] there's a family that have been with us
[2:48:54] for a while
[2:48:56] and we've with all the transition and uh
[2:49:00] uh the the sister came in and she had to
[2:49:03] be with uh her parents
[2:49:05] and uh
[2:49:06] uh and she was close to giving birth and
[2:49:10] and brother joseph came and right to
[2:49:12] work finding the place with all the
[2:49:14] transition we have not really had a
[2:49:16] proper way to kind of introduce them and
[2:49:20] uh because brother joseph he's a
[2:49:22] preacher too
[2:49:24] and but uh uh
[2:49:26] cecilia gave birthing and uh joe called
[2:49:30] me
