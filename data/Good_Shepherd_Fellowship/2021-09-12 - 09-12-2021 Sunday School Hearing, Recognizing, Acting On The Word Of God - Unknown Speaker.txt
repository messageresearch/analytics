========================================

couldn't do it he never was in him to be able to counterpass the things of the world the carnal things but jacob it was just so easy for him to do it now jacob one purpose jacob had and that was that he longed for that birthright no matter how he got it just so he got it and that spirit of that one birth is still represented in the world today and it's coming to a head now the spiritual believer and the carnal man carnal believer no one could say they wasn't both religious they were they didn't say that once served an idol and the other one god they were both servants of god now pay close attention to the scriptures now on this subject because i'm sure it'll help you now not everyone that saith lord lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven now if you notice jacob had one thing that he wanted because according to the word the blessings and the the good things laid in the birthright and jacob that was his only objective the only thing he had in mind was get that birthright and esau despised it the one that actually had it despised it or he was ashamed of it but jacob wanted it regardless of how he got it he wanted it that's the way with the spiritual believer today he doesn't care how much you laugh at him how much fun you make how ridiculous he has to act to the carnal mind his only objective is a birthright he wants to get to god because it's born in him he can't help it jacob means the planter our deceiver but after finding and coming into possession of the birthright he was changed that's the carnal change he was then called jacob a prince with the lord who's wrestled with him amen the carnal believer today oh as long as i go to church and do what's right what difference does it make that's esau's group he still makes fun and despises the birthright he doesn't care for it but jacob loved it and the spiritual man today and spiritual woman that's elected predestinated of god to come to eternal life if they have to sell everything they got if they have to take their name off of every church book in the nation they still want that birth right it's the only thing that matters to them just get that birthright that's all no matter how what level they have to come on if they have to get out the altar and cry boohoo if they have to run through the the places and go back and make things right and sell what they got or give away everything they have and become a pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter they want the birthright that's all they're interested in the birthright but don't blame them people they can't happen they were predestinated to that elected to it and then we see that these two carnal and spiritual people that's the way it always happens that's the way it is today it always has been that way cain and abel in the garden of eden when eden was created there were two trees for a man to take his choice one he become of wisdom the other he become life there was two boys cain and abel both of them religious one of them desired uh life eternal and he offered to god by faith a more excellent sacrifice than cain a perfect type of the churches today the church natural church spiritual and there's no doubt but what i'm talking to both classes right now and perhaps father tate will talk to tens of thousands of them but look the church natural it's just the church carnal they're never able to get above that little thing of i john church if i go to church if i do the best i can that's all god requires now that's the same thing kingdom he went and made an altar he made a sacrifice he brought the fruits of the land and he said here it is god that's the best i got it or leave it that's the way the carnal believer believes today lord i'll go to church i'll join the best group that i can find i'll pay in my dues to the church i'll do what's right now here's the best i can do i'll help buy some coal for the widow or i'll give the children some clothing that's all right nothing to say against it but that's it that's all if you want to take it if you don't you don't have to take it that's the attitude of the church carnal today but the church spiritual able by revelation by grace he's seen beyond that and by faith he offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain and it testified of his righteousness god the same thing took place in ishmael and isaac one was of the flesh and the other was of the spirit one of the bonds woman one of the three women it happened the same thing in israel and moab two great churches coming together and when israel was wanting to go to their promised place church spiritual jacob's people israel on the road esau's people met them moab church powerful and the great leader of the church balaam came down to curse his brother but he found that he could not curse his brother he failed with the blindness of his eyes to see the predestinated plan that and to see the word of god [Music] first faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of god then the believer hears it recognizes it and acts on it the carnal man i'll hear it the sound of it but never here means to understand it look at is looking at something but to see it is to understand it except the man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of god now here come israel coming up with god's promise that they were headed to the promised land not infidels but believers believers in the same god that israel had come out to try to curse his brother because he said his brother is surely was unrighteous because he had done lots of things that was bad but you see he failed to see the election amen same thing with esau and jacob esau seemed like a better man he settled down and done charitable things he took care of his old blind daddy got him venison and taking care of him i was a good boy there's many things that carnal believers do in the light of religion helping societies and and paying off hospital bills for people and religious things but that's not what i'm talking about was good a great nation a brother to him and jacob had done everything he had been a renegade but yet he had one thing to achieve that was to obtain that promise that birthright here come israel jacob's children with the same objective amen now who's going to be right balaam built seven altars in israel there were seven altars balaam offered seven sacrifices of clean beasts israel offered seven sacrifices of clean beast there is far if they take it ritually boy it was just as religious as israel was esau just as religious as jacob was and came just as religious as abel was but the election is what holds how blind how blind that esau's children spiritually speaking the movements looked down upon israel and said look at them they're not a denomination they're a bunch of renegades they live in tents and we're a great nation they've done evil and they have no organization among them they're just wiggling around following a prophet but he failed to see the bright serpent and the smith rock going before them he failed to see that called out elected group following the divine order of god to the promised land that's the way it is today they say it's a bunch of holy rollers it's a bunch of people who's this that and the other but they fail to see that it's following the direction of the word of god israel was on her way to the promised land god in his word made a promise jacob the reason that he chose to find that birthright regardless he wanted to get it because he knowed that birthright helped the blessings it helped life he didn't care how it comes just so he got it that was the main thing what plane had come home didn't matter he wanted it and he must have it and he got it blessed are they they do hunger and thirst for righteousness they shall be filled he was on his road and he was after it and he received it israel was on her road to the promised land no matter how many moba nights and curses they tried to put on them they went straight to the promised land today you'll never no matter how much law they get how much prosecution how much persecution how many evil things they say how many times they call holy roar how many times they say those evil things the church will move on it's got to it's staying in the word of god [Music] so [Music] you
