[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] the only thing can be done
[0:12] is orders that's been given by god for
[0:15] believers to lay hands on the sick
[0:17] that's been through the ages they've
[0:19] done that through revivals
[0:21] and they've called it god abraham's seen
[0:24] many signs
[0:25] but there come a time when abraham saw
[0:29] his last sign
[0:30] just before sodom was burned that was
[0:34] god manifesting himself
[0:37] in the form of a man you believe that
[0:41] did jesus say it would repeat now how
[0:44] many in here
[0:46] and out radio or out of the telephones
[0:49] across the nation
[0:50] if you're still listening in get ready
[0:53] now
[0:54] for prayer be free
[0:59] you just got these handkerchiefs here
[1:01] now
[1:03] i cannot tell god what to do
[1:06] no far be it from even trying it he's
[1:09] sovereign he does what he wants to
[1:12] i can only obey and i only can say what
[1:15] he says
[1:17] and now they're standing around the
[1:19] walls they're
[1:20] packed in as congested i wonder
[1:24] if we could ask god on these words
[1:27] what is this attraction
[1:30] if god would move among us again there
[1:33] may be strangers here
[1:35] and move among us and show his blessed
[1:37] face among us
[1:39] show his spirits here show that he's the
[1:42] same yesterday today and forever
[1:45] that every one of us after these two
[1:47] strong messages
[1:49] could believe it to be so could you do
[1:51] it
[1:53] all right instead of calling
[1:56] a prayer line man hot
[2:00] congested standing against wall i look
[2:02] around this way to call them a prayer
[2:03] line you couldn't do it look standing
[2:04] there
[2:05] going to call it this way you're sick
[2:06] cots everything else laying you couldn't
[2:08] do it
[2:10] so sit where you are
[2:13] and believe god
[2:19] if you do have a prayer card hold it
[2:22] it'll be good
[2:24] we'll get to you if you want to come to
[2:26] a line
[2:28] but you don't have to come to a line
[2:31] that mr shepard last sunday night never
[2:32] come through no line
[2:35] i don't i don't guess he had a prayer
[2:36] card is mr shepherd here tonight
[2:38] or is he is he here he's in the bank
[2:42] do you have a prayer card mr shepherd
[2:43] you didn't you didn't
[2:45] he's sitting right there again tonight
[2:48] that's a good place to be brother
[2:50] shepard
[2:51] not only have to be there but just have
[2:53] faith
[2:54] but remember a little woman touched his
[2:58] garment
[2:59] and he felt it and he's the same
[3:02] yesterday and forever
[3:04] and the hebrew letter in the new
[3:06] testament
[3:07] said that he's a high priest tonight
[3:10] that can be touched by the feeling of
[3:11] your infirmities
[3:12] you believe that have faith in
[3:16] don't doubt it believe it and it'll come
[3:19] to pass
[3:19] you can have what you what you've asked
[3:21] for if
[3:23] you can believe it but you got to
[3:24] believe it will you do it
[3:27] well all of you believe it how many will
[3:29] believe it now
[3:30] god bless you i don't know who's who
[3:35] i don't know none of you it's not my
[3:37] business to know any of you
[3:39] it's god's business to know these things
[3:42] but he will do it if you'll believe it
[3:44] will you believe it now
[3:46] now dear god
[3:50] surely we're not a bunch of hybrid
[3:53] christians
[3:54] we shouldn't be somebody has to be
[3:56] petted and babied
[3:58] you don't have that kind lord you have
[4:00] rugged believers
[4:03] the very presence of god sets a man's
[4:05] heart on fire
[4:08] like abraham
[4:11] he believed god you made yourself known
[4:15] to him then you appeared to him and
[4:17] performed a sign
[4:19] and he believed you you turned his body
[4:22] back to a young man
[4:24] also his wife which his wife was part of
[4:26] his own body then come forth the new
[4:29] child
[4:29] the promised son god you promised
[4:33] that it be the same thing in this day i
[4:36] pray that you'll confirm this word
[4:38] and we'll deal right on that one promise
[4:41] there that it would be like it was in
[4:43] sodom
[4:44] just before sodom was burned and
[4:46] judgment struck sodom the gentile world
[4:49] so judgment is fixed and strength
[4:53] the gentile world and the jews got three
[4:56] and a half more years
[4:57] through the period of tribulation
[4:59] jacob's trouble
[5:01] the continuing of the 70 weeks of daniel
[5:04] but the gentiles
[5:05] are numbered it's time to go
[5:09] and you'll give that sign and you said
[5:11] it would be again
[5:13] granted god there we're in your hands do
[5:16] with us as you see
[5:17] fit in jesus christ's name
[5:22] amen
[5:24] now don't be nervous
[5:29] what would it be if i was nervous
[5:32] now i'm making a thing here that it has
[5:35] to depend on the sovereignty of god
[5:40] but why do i do this he said it would be
[5:44] that settles it and if he makes yourself
[5:47] that
[5:48] confirmed like that before you
[5:52] well can't you believe him certainly
[5:56] you just have faith now and believe
[5:59] let me just look around see where the
[6:01] holy spirit will lead
[6:03] what he'll do i don't know
[6:08] what he'll do that's up to him
[6:11] but if you just
[6:14] only have faith only believe
[6:19] all things are possible to them that
[6:21] believe
[6:23] all of you believe that raise up your
[6:24] hands and say i do believe it
[6:28] with all my heart i believe it now
[6:31] three will be a confirmation
[6:35] if he'll do it three straight times to
[6:37] prove you
[6:39] that that's right
[6:45] i don't care where you are who you are
