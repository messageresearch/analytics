[1:34] jacob and jacob begat joseph the husband
[1:38] of mary of whom was born jesus who is
[1:40] called christ
[1:43] so all the generations from abraham to
[1:45] david are 14 generations and from david
[1:48] until they're carrying away into babylon
[1:49] of 14 generations
[1:51] and from the carrying away into babylon
[1:53] unto christ are fourteen generations
[1:58] now the birth of jesus christ was on
[2:00] this wise
[2:01] when as his mother mary was espoused to
[2:03] joseph before they came together she was
[2:06] found with child of the holy ghost
[2:08] then joseph her husband being a just man
[2:11] and not willing to make her a public
[2:13] example was minded to put her away
[2:15] privily
[2:16] but while he thought on these things
[2:18] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[2:20] unto him in a dream saying joseph thou
[2:22] son of david fear not to take unto thee
[2:25] mary thy wife for that which is
[2:27] conceived in her is of the holy ghost
[2:30] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[2:32] shalt call his name jesus for he shall
[2:35] save his people from their sins
[2:38] now all this was done that it might be
[2:40] fulfilled which was spoken of the lord
[2:42] by the prophet saying behold a virgin
[2:44] shall be with child and shall bring
[2:46] forth a son and they shall call his name
[2:49] emmanuel
[2:50] which being interpreted is god with us
[2:54] then joseph being raised from sleep did
[2:56] as the angel of the lord had bidden him
[2:58] and took unto him his wife and knew her
[3:01] not till she had brought forth her
[3:02] firstborn son
[3:04] and he called his name jesus
[3:19] now when jesus was born in bethlehem of
[3:21] judea in the days of herod the king
[3:23] behold there came wise men from the east
[3:25] to jerusalem saying where is he that is
[3:28] born king of the jews for we have seen
[3:30] his star in the east and i come to
[3:32] worship him
[3:34] when herod the king had heard these
[3:35] things he was troubled and all jerusalem
[3:37] with him
[3:38] and when he had gathered all the chief
[3:40] priests and scribes of the people
[3:41] together he demanded of them where
[3:43] christ should be born and they said unto
[3:46] him in bethlehem of judea
[3:48] for thus it is written by the prophet
[3:50] and thou bethlehem in the land of judah
[3:53] are not the least among the princes of
[3:55] judah for out of thee shall come a
[3:57] governor that shall rule my people
[3:58] israel
[4:01] then herod when he had privily called
[4:03] the wise men inquired of them diligently
[4:06] what time the star appeared
[4:08] and he sent them to bethlehem and said
[4:10] go and search diligently for the young
[4:12] child and when ye have found him bring
[4:16] me word again that i may come and
[4:18] worship him also
[4:20] when they had heard the king they
[4:22] departed
[4:23] and lo the store which they saw in the
[4:25] east went before them till it came and
[4:27] stood over where the young child was
[4:31] when they saw the store they rejoiced
[4:33] with exceeding great joy
[4:35] and when they were come into the house
[4:37] they saw the young child with mary his
[4:39] mother
[4:40] and fell down and worshiped him
[4:43] and when they had opened their treasures
[4:45] they presented unto him gifts
[4:47] gold and frankincense and myrrh
[4:51] and being warned of god in a dream that
[4:53] they should not return to herod they
[4:55] departed into their own country another
[4:57] way
[4:59] and when they were deported behold the
[5:01] angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in
[5:03] a dream saying arise and take the young
[5:05] child and his mother and flee into egypt
[5:08] and be thou there until i bring thee
[5:10] word
[5:11] for herod will seek the young child to
[5:13] destroy him
[5:15] when he arose he took the young child
[5:17] and his mother by night and departed
[5:19] into egypt and was there until the death
[5:21] of herod
[5:22] that it might be fulfilled
[5:24] which was spoken of the lord by the
[5:25] prophet saying
[5:27] out of egypt have i called my son
[5:31] then herod when he saw that he was
[5:33] mocked of the wise men was exceeding
[5:35] wrath and sent forth and slew all the
[5:37] children that were in bethlehem and in
[5:39] all the coasts thereof from two years
[5:41] old and under according to the time
[5:43] which he had diligently inquired of the
[5:45] wise men
[5:47] then was fulfilled that which was spoken
[5:49] by jeremy the prophet
[5:51] saying
[5:52] in rhema was there a voice heard
[5:55] lamentation and weeping and great
[5:57] mourning
[5:58] rachel weeping for her children and
[6:01] would not be comforted
[6:03] because they are not
[6:06] but when herod was dead behold an angel
[6:09] of the lord appeareth in a dream to
[6:10] joseph in egypt saying arise and take
[6:13] the young child and his mother and go
[6:15] into the land of israel for they are
[6:17] dead which sought the young child's life
[6:20] and he arose and took the young child
[6:21] and his mother and came into the land of
[6:23] israel
[6:25] but when he heard that archelaus did
[6:26] reign in judea in the room of his father
[6:28] herod he was afraid to go this
[6:31] notwithstanding being warned of god in a
[6:33] dream he turned aside into the parts of
[6:36] galilee
[6:37] and he came and dwelt in a city called
[6:39] nazareth
[6:41] that it might be fulfilled which was
[6:42] spoken by the prophets
[6:44] he shall be called a nazarene
[6:54] in those days came john the baptist
[6:55] preaching in the wilderness of judea and
[6:57] saying repent ye for the kingdom of
[7:00] heaven is at hand
[7:01] for this is he that was spoken of by the
[7:03] prophet isaiah saying the voice of one
[7:06] crying in the wilderness prepare ye the
[7:08] way of the lord make his paths straight
[7:11] and the same john had his raiment of
[7:13] camel's hair and a leather girdle about
[7:16] his loins and his meat was locusts and
[7:18] wild honey
[7:20] then went out to him jerusalem and all
[7:22] judea and all the region round about
[7:24] jordan and were baptized of him in
[7:26] jordan confessing their sins
[7:28] but when he saw many of the pharisees
[7:30] and sadducees come to his baptism he
[7:32] said unto them o generation of vipers
[7:35] who hath warned you to flee from the
[7:37] wrath to come
[7:39] bring forth therefore fruits meet for
[7:41] repentance and think not to say within
[7:43] yourselves we have abraham to our father
[7:47] for i say unto you that god is able of
[7:49] these stones to raise up children unto
[7:52] abraham
[7:53] and now also the axe is laid onto the
[7:55] root of the trees
[7:57] therefore every tree which bringeth not
[7:59] forth good fruit is hewn down and cast
[8:01] into the fire
[8:03] i indeed baptize you with water unto
[8:06] repentance
[8:07] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[8:09] than i
[8:10] whose shoes i am not worthy to bear
[8:14] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[8:16] and with fire
[8:18] whose fan is in his hand and he will
[8:20] throughly purge his floor and gather his
[8:23] wheat into the garner but he will burn
[8:25] up the chaff with unquenchable fire
[8:30] then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan
[8:32] unto john to be baptized of him but john
[8:34] forbad him saying
[8:36] i have need to be baptized of thee
[8:39] and cometh thou to me
[8:41] and jesus answering said unto him
[8:44] suffer it to be so now for thus it
[8:46] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[8:49] then he suffered him
[8:52] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[8:54] straightway out of the water and lo the
[8:56] heavens were opened unto him and he saw
[8:59] the spirit of god descending like a dove
[9:02] and lighting upon him
[9:04] and lo a voice from heaven saying
[9:06] this is my beloved son
[9:08] in whom i am well pleased
[9:14] then was jesus led up of the spirit into
[9:17] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[9:18] devil
[9:19] and when he had fasted forty days and
[9:21] forty nights he was afterward and
[9:23] hungried
[9:25] and when the tempter came to him he said
[9:27] if thou be the son of god command that
[9:30] these stones be made bread
[9:33] but he answered and said it is written
[9:35] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[9:38] every word that proceedeth out of the
[9:40] mouth of god
[9:42] then the devil taketh him up into the
[9:43] holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle
[9:45] of the temple and saith unto him if thou
[9:48] be the son of god cast thyself down
[9:51] for it is written he shall give his
[9:53] angels charge concerning thee and in
[9:55] their hands they shall bear thee up lest
[9:57] at any time thou dash thy foot against
[9:59] the stone
[10:01] jesus said unto him
[10:03] it is written again
[10:05] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[10:09] again the devil taketh him up into an
[10:10] exceeding high mountain and showeth him
[10:13] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[10:15] glory of them and saith unto him all
[10:18] these things will i give thee
[10:21] if thou wilt fall down and worship me
[10:26] then seth jesus unto him
[10:28] get thee hence satan
[10:30] for it is written thou shalt worship the
[10:32] lord thy god and him only shalt thou
[10:35] serve
[10:37] then the devil leaveth him and behold
[10:39] angels came and ministered unto him
[10:44] now when jesus had heard that john was
[10:46] cast into prison he departed into
[10:48] galilee and leaving nazareth he came and
[10:50] dwelt in capernaum which is upon the
[10:53] seacoast in the borders of zebulun and
[10:55] nephilim
[10:56] that it might be fulfilled which was
[10:58] spoken by ezias the prophet saying the
[11:01] land of zebulun and the land of
[11:03] nephthalem by the way of the sea beyond
[11:05] jordan galilee of the gentiles
[11:08] the people which sat in darkness saw
[11:10] great light and to them which sat in the
[11:13] region and shadow of death
[11:15] light is sprung up
[11:18] from that time jesus began to preach and
[11:20] to say repent for the kingdom of heaven
[11:23] is at hand
[11:25] and jesus walking by the sea of galilee
[11:27] saw two brethren simon called peter and
[11:30] andrew his brother casting a net into
[11:32] the sea for they were fishers and he
[11:34] saith unto them follow me
[11:37] and i will make you fishers of men
[11:39] and they straightway left their nets and
[11:41] followed him
[11:42] and going on from thence he saw other
[11:44] two brethren james the son of zebedee
[11:46] and john his brother in a ship with
[11:48] zebedee their father mending their nets
[11:51] and he called them
[11:53] and they immediately left the ship in
[11:54] their father and followed him
[11:57] and jesus went about all galilee
[11:59] teaching in their synagogues and
[12:01] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[12:03] healing all manner of sickness and all
[12:04] manner of disease among the people and
[12:07] his fame went throughout all syria and
[12:09] they brought unto him all sick people
[12:11] that were taken with divers diseases
[12:14] and torments and those which were
[12:16] possessed with devils
[12:17] and those which were lunatic and those
[12:19] that had the palsy
[12:21] and he healed them and they followed him
[12:24] great multitudes of people from galilee
[12:27] and from decapolis and from jerusalem
[12:29] and from judea and from beyond jordan
[12:33] and seeing the multitudes he went up
[12:35] into a mountain and when he was set his
[12:37] disciples came unto him and he opened
[12:40] his mouth and taught them saying
[12:42] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[12:44] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[12:46] blessed are they that mourn for they
[12:48] shall be comforted
[12:50] blessed are the meek for they shall
[12:52] inherit the earth
[12:54] blessed are they which do hunger and
[12:56] thirst after righteousness
[12:58] for they shall be filled
[13:00] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[13:02] obtain mercy
[13:04] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[13:06] shall see god
[13:09] blessed are the peacemakers
[13:11] for they shall be called the children of
[13:13] god
[13:15] blessed are they
[13:16] which are persecuted for righteousness
[13:18] sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[13:23] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[13:26] and persecute you and shall say all
[13:28] manner of evil against you falsely for
[13:30] my sake
[13:32] rejoice and be exceeding glad
[13:35] for great is your reward in heaven
[13:37] for so persecuted they the prophets
[13:40] which were before you
[13:42] ye are the salt of the earth
[13:45] but if the salt have lost his savour
[13:48] wherewith shall it be salted it is then
[13:50] forth good for nothing but to be cast
[13:52] out and to be trodden on the foot of men
[13:55] ye are the light of the world
[13:58] a city that is set on an hill cannot be
[14:00] hid
[14:02] neither do men light a candle and put it
[14:04] under a bushel but on a candle stick and
[14:06] it giveth light unto all that are in the
[14:08] house
[14:10] let your light so shine before men
[14:12] that they may see your good works and
[14:14] glorify your father which is in heaven
[14:18] think not that i am come to destroy the
[14:20] law or the prophets i am not come to
[14:23] destroy
[14:24] but to fulfill
[14:27] for verily i say unto you till heaven
[14:29] and earth pass one jot or one tittle
[14:31] shall in no wise pass from the law till
[14:34] all be fulfilled
[14:36] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[14:38] these least commandments and shall teach
[14:41] men so he shall be called the least in
[14:43] the kingdom of heaven but whosoever
[14:45] shall do and teach them the same shall
[14:47] be called great in the kingdom of heaven
[14:50] for i say unto you that except your
[14:52] righteousness shall exceed the
[14:54] righteousness of the scribes and
[14:55] pharisees ye shall in no case enter into
[14:58] the kingdom of heaven
[15:00] ye have heard that it was said by them
[15:02] of old time thou shalt not kill
[15:05] and whosoever shall kill shall be in
[15:07] danger of the judgment but i say unto
[15:09] you
[15:10] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[15:12] without a cause shall be in danger of
[15:14] the judgment
[15:16] and whosoever shall say to his brother
[15:18] reika
[15:19] shall be in danger of the counsel
[15:22] but whosoever shall say
[15:24] thou fool shall be in danger of hell
[15:27] fire
[15:29] therefore if thou bring thy gift to the
[15:31] altar and their rememberest that thy
[15:33] brother hath ought against thee leave
[15:35] their thy gift before the altar and go
[15:37] thy way first be reconciled to thy
[15:39] brother and then come and offer thy gift
[15:43] agree with thine adversary quickly
[15:45] whilst thou art in the way with him lest
[15:48] at any time the adversary deliver thee
[15:49] to the judge and the judge deliver thee
[15:51] to the officer and thou be cast into
[15:53] prison
[15:55] verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no
[15:57] means come out thence til thou hast paid
[15:59] the uttermost forthing
[16:03] ye have heard that it was said by them
[16:04] of old time thou shalt not commit
[16:07] adultery
[16:08] but i say unto you
[16:10] that whosoever looketh on a woman to
[16:12] lust after her have committed adultery
[16:14] with her already in his heart
[16:17] and if thy right eye offend thee
[16:20] pluck it out and cast it from thee
[16:23] for it is profitable for thee that one
[16:24] of thy members should perish and not
[16:27] that thy whole body should be cast into
[16:29] hell
[16:30] and if thy right hand offend thee cut it
[16:32] off and cast it from thee for it is
[16:34] profitable for thee that one of thy
[16:35] members should perish and not that thy
[16:37] whole body should be cast into hell
[16:40] it hath been said whosoever shall put
[16:42] away his wife let him give her a writing
[16:45] of divorcement
[16:47] but i say unto you that whosoever shall
[16:49] put away his wife saving for the cause
[16:52] of fornication
[16:53] causes her to commit adultery
[16:55] and whosoever shall marry her that is
[16:57] divorced committeth adultery
[17:01] again ye have heard that it has been
[17:03] said by them of old time thou shalt not
[17:05] forswear thyself but shalt perform unto
[17:08] the lord thine olds
[17:10] but i say unto you
[17:12] swear not at all
[17:14] neither by heaven for it is god's throne
[17:17] nor by the earth for it is his footstool
[17:20] neither by jerusalem for it is the city
[17:22] of the great king
[17:24] neither shalt thou swear by thy head
[17:25] because thou canst not make one hair
[17:27] white or black but let your
[17:29] communication be
[17:31] ye
[17:33] nay
[17:34] but whatsoever is more than these cometh
[17:37] of evil
[17:39] ye have heard that it has been said an
[17:41] eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
[17:45] but i say unto you that ye resist not
[17:48] evil
[17:49] but whosoever shall smite thee on my
[17:51] right cheek turn to him thy other also
[17:54] and if any man will sue thee at the law
[17:56] and take away thy coat let him have thy
[17:58] cloak also
[17:59] and whosoever shall compel thee to go a
[18:01] mile go with him twain
[18:04] give to him that asketh thee and from
[18:06] him that would borrow of thee turn not
[18:08] thou away
[18:10] ye have heard that it hath been said
[18:12] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[18:14] thine enemy but i say unto you love your
[18:16] enemies
[18:17] bless them that curse you do good to
[18:20] them that hate you and pray for them
[18:22] which despitefully use you and persecute
[18:24] you
[18:25] that ye may be the children of your
[18:26] father which is in heaven
[18:28] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[18:31] evil and on the good
[18:32] and sendeth rain on the just and on the
[18:35] unjust
[18:36] for if ye love them which love you
[18:39] what reward have ye
[18:41] do not even the publicans the same
[18:44] and if he salute your brethren only what
[18:46] do ye more than others do not even the
[18:48] public and so
[18:50] be ye therefore perfect
[18:53] even as your father which is in heaven
[18:54] is perfect
[18:56] take heed that ye do not your arms
[18:58] before men to be seen of them otherwise
[19:00] ye have no reward of your father which
[19:01] is in heaven therefore when thou doest
[19:04] thine arms
[19:05] do not sound a trumpet before thee as
[19:07] the hypocrites do in the synagogues and
[19:09] in the streets that they may have glory
[19:11] of men
[19:12] verily i say unto you they have their
[19:14] reward
[19:16] but when thou do astons
[19:18] let not thy left hand know what thy
[19:20] right hand doeth
[19:22] that thine arms may be in secret and thy
[19:24] father which seeth in secret himself
[19:26] shall reward thee openly
[19:30] and when thou prayest
[19:32] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
[19:34] for they love to pray standing in the
[19:36] synagogues and in the corners of the
[19:37] streets that they may be seen of men
[19:40] verily i say unto you they have their
[19:42] reward but thou when thou praised
[19:45] enter into thy closet
[19:46] and when thou hast shut thy door
[19:48] pray to thy father which is in secret
[19:51] and thy father which seeth in secret
[19:53] shall reward thee openly
[19:56] but
[19:57] when ye pray
[19:59] use not vain repetitions as the heathen
[20:02] do for they think that they shall be
[20:03] heard for their much speaking be not ye
[20:06] therefore like unto them for your father
[20:08] knoweth what things ye have need of
[20:10] before ye ask him
[20:12] after this man i therefore pray ye
[20:15] our father which art in heaven
[20:17] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[20:21] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[20:24] heaven
[20:26] give us this day our daily bread
[20:28] and forgive us our debts
[20:30] as we forgive our debtors
[20:33] and lead us not into temptation
[20:35] but deliver us from evil
[20:38] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[20:40] and the glory forever
[20:42] amen
[20:45] for if ye forgive men their trespasses
[20:48] your heavenly father will also forgive
[20:49] you but if ye forgive not men their
[20:51] trespasses neither will your father
[20:53] forgive your trespasses
[20:56] moreover when ye fast be not as the
[20:59] hypocrites of a sad countenance for they
[21:01] disfigure their faces that they may
[21:03] appear unto men to fast
[21:05] verily i say unto you they have their
[21:07] reward
[21:09] for thou when thou fastest anoint thine
[21:11] head and wash thy face that thou appear
[21:13] not unto men to fast but unto thy father
[21:16] which is in secret and thy father which
[21:18] seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
[21:22] lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
[21:25] earth where moth and rust doth corrupt
[21:27] and where thieves break through and
[21:29] steal but lay up for yourselves
[21:31] treasures in heaven where neither moth
[21:33] nor rust of corrupt and where thieves do
[21:35] not break through nor steal
[21:37] for where your treasure is
[21:39] there will your heart be also
[21:42] the light of the body is the eye
[21:44] if therefore thine i be single my whole
[21:47] body shall be full of light
[21:48] but if thine eye be evil thy whole body
[21:51] shall be full of darkness
[21:53] if therefore the light that is in thee
[21:55] be darkness
[21:57] how great is that darkness
[22:01] no man can serve two masters
[22:04] for either he will hate the one and love
[22:05] the other or else he will hold to the
[22:07] one and despise the other ye cannot
[22:10] serve god and mammon
[22:13] therefore i say unto you take no thought
[22:15] for your life what ye shall eat or what
[22:17] ye shall drink nor yet for your body
[22:19] what ye shall put on
[22:20] is not the life more than meat and the
[22:23] body than raiment
[22:25] behold the fowls of the air
[22:27] for they so not neither do they reap nor
[22:29] gather into barns yet your heavenly
[22:31] father feedeth them
[22:33] are ye not much better than they
[22:37] which of you by taking thought can add
[22:39] one cubit onto his stature
[22:42] and why take he thought for raiment
[22:45] consider the lilies of the field
[22:47] how they grow they toil not neither do
[22:49] they spin and yet i say unto you that
[22:51] even solomon in all his glory was not
[22:53] arrayed like one of these
[22:55] wherefore if god so clothed the grass of
[22:58] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[23:00] cast into the oven shall he not much
[23:02] more clothe you
[23:05] o ye of little faith
[23:09] therefore take no thought saying what
[23:11] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[23:13] where with all shall we be clothed
[23:15] for after all these things do the
[23:16] gentiles seek
[23:18] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[23:20] have need of all these things
[23:23] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[23:26] his righteousness
[23:27] and all these things shall be added unto
[23:30] you
[23:30] take therefore no thought for the moral
[23:33] for the morrow shall take thought for
[23:35] the things of itself
[23:37] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[23:40] thereof
[23:47] [Music]
[24:34] you
