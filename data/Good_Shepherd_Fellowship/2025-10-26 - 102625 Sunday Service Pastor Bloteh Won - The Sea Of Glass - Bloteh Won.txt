Help you, [Music] Lord. [Music] I give you praise. Yes, I am. [Music] It's in you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord, I gave you my heart and I gave you my soul. [Music] I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake, have your way. Amen. Praise the Lord. Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. We just want to thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity to be together and uh we just praying and asking that he will his presence that have been with us from the beginning will just uh see us through. Amen. I came in this morning and I mean just from uh uh the Sunday school and uh when I enter I came I got right under conviction. Amen. I just thought the whole service was going to be uh a prayer meeting because that was very strong. Amen. That was a very strong uh alter call brother Brandon had and closing that message uh of the church in this condition. And I f as to what we need. Uh uh I mean it was it was it was really convicting. I couldn't even do nothing. I just went straight in the office, put everything down, got on my knees and started seeking God myself. Amen. That was that was beautiful. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat for the while. And uh Thursday we were out uh uh there in Wnebago for brother Bobby's funeral. Uh we had grace to see brother Zia Brooks and his wife they send their greetings and also brother Steve Shelly uh uh also sent his greetings. I met him the first time there in uh Tennessee at uh uh Sister Shell's funeral, brother Bill Young's wife. And uh uh but it was it was good. And there was there was something that happened right after the funeral because brother Brooks had to leave and uh and and not many of the people we knew around. So I just thought, okay, right after the funeral, I would just leave myself, you know, I can get back get back to town early. But then uh uh when they were heading to the grave, I think Sister Jackie had two of her grandsons holding her and she saw me. I could tell by her eyes she was greeting me. So I so I felt okay maybe I might stay and just give her the proper greeting when I returned back from the grave site and uh uh so I said no let me just go you know uh so I got I got there and got in my vehicle I drove out I said no it's not nice let me go back so I went back and then I packed I sat down I waited for a Why? I said, "No, let me leave." I was just in between like that. But finally, I decided to stay and it was good that I stayed. It was very, very good that I stay because uh um uh by the way, Sister Nam, I gave your card just before the head to the graveside. So, that one was out of the way. And uh uh and and then I had the privilege to greet brother Bobby's wife, too. So, that was good. And then uh uh but then when I stay, I felt then I saw the reason why I felt that it was good for me to stay because uh I was able to meet Sister Jackie's children, you know, and and she was she was glad and excited that I was there, you know, and uh if you if you hang around Sister Jackie, you'll know that she's a special woman. Amen. She's special to that to that town. and uh uh you know but then while while I sit there you know because I I really never knew brother Bobby I just decided to to because brother Brandham had mentioned him on tape. So, I was sitting there and I just decided to go over, you know, some of the few things that Brother Bam was saying about him and uh uh uh and and you know, so and it's and it's there. So, and it was it was really a blessing to me, you know, it was it was a blessing and uh and we just thank the Lord for that. And then she told me and uh uh I even got to see her grandchildren that brought her one time. So we we just pray that the Lord would comfort the family. Amen. That the Lord would comfort the family. You know, uh I think about sister Jackie all the time. And uh uh there was there was a little there was a little video that I saw that really distract sister Jackie to me. And uh Emanuel, if you can play that for me. Uh I hope that it plays well. I was trying to I was trying to edit it. It was not giving me chance. So, we'll play it just the way it is. &gt;&gt; Walmart. Only seconds after Jacobe got into her car, a man jumped in the passenger side. The man told Jacobe he had a gun and that he would shoot her if she didn't give him money. &gt;&gt; I said, "No, I'm not going to give him my money." &gt;&gt; Jacobe told him no three times. Then she started to talk to him. &gt;&gt; You know, cookies, you kill me. I'll go to heaven and you go to hell. She told him to ask God for forgiveness. &gt;&gt; I said, "Jesus is in this car and he goes with me everywhere I go." And uh he just sort of looked around and the tears began coming in his eyes. &gt;&gt; Jacobe ministered the man for 10 minutes inside her car &gt;&gt; and he said, "I I think I'll go home and pray tonight." I said, "You know, I have to wait tonight. &gt;&gt; I said, you can just pray anytime you want to." &gt;&gt; As tears were rolling down the man's face, Jacobe voluntarily gave him all the money she had, $10. &gt;&gt; And when I told him I was going to give him the money, I said, "Don't you spend it on whiskey either." &gt;&gt; The man thanked her for the money and then &gt;&gt; reached over and kissed me on the cheek. Jacobe had just finished putting &gt;&gt; Okay, if you don't know Sister Jackie, that's typical Sister Jackie. That's typical Sister Jackie. You know the whole the whole uh when the Baker said they know Sister Jackie very well. They know and Jackie, you can't get her to wear pants. You can't get her to cut her hair. That's how they know her. And you know what? I I when I when I saw this little video, I just felt like uh how the presence of God goes with us, you know, and it can be right in your vehicle. I mean, she brought that man on a conviction. I don't think it was because she was an old lady that he felt sorry for her. I be I believe because the presence of the Lord was there. Amen. The presence of the Lord was there. You kill me and I go to heaven and you go to hell. What's about that? Amen. And you know that's that is just such a time that we are living in. And we we have to be very prudent. you know, uh whether you at the gas station or at the shopping mall, wherever you are, and uh uh if you would get out of your vehicle, uh just just close the lock of the next door because if someone want to rob you, they're not going to come through the door you are. They're going to come through the opposite door. So, just close the lock and then uh you can be But we pray that his presence will protect us. Amen. So we just we just thank the Lord for that and uh uh we have few prayer needs here. Okay. Now u uh sister be have uh she had a praise report with me yesterday about a young man that we prayed for. She called me and we prayed for him and uh uh he was he was honored uh spared of an evil influence and uh in the grace of God came down. And what what uh what really touched my heart uh uh talking about this is is is because uh you know when Jesus came to uh Zaku house he said salvation has come to this home. Amen. And uh and I share with you the last time meeting the lady that uh you know that uh sister uh uh laid by her place and and helped the family there and uh you know and what she said and and I just feel like uh uh uh salvation is in that home you know because uh uh those are Muslim family but it looks like the home is surviving on sister prayer that if there is anything that is happening in the home, they ask us they ask her to pray because they know that's that's the best and the only thing she can offer. So I pray that God will just have his way, you know, uh and then uh uh do what he's best known for doing. She also thanking God for her grandson. We pray for him too, her son also. And uh uh I just want to read another prayer uh media to you and then we go to the Lord in prayer. Praise the Lord. This came in our our prayer text group from uh uh I got this uh yesterday and u a prayer need a young lady uh was in the wreck last night came through the surgery. I haven't heard any further detail. I didn't realize she had two sons with her also. She was in an accident. One son is going into surgery this morning. Uh he has two broken legs and and and and broken jaw and multiple broken fingers. The other son has a broken nose. Praying for the Lord's mercy on them. Amen. And when I read this, I I just I felt like uh uh the brother might not know these people personally, but he witnessed the accident or was told about the accident. And I just and I just think that's an honorable thing to do. You know, uh you see an incident along the road, uh you don't need to know the people, but you know a God that can help the situation. Amen. I think that's an honorable thing to do. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer this morning. Heavenly Father, Lord God, we want to stand Lord and just remember their family. Oh Lord God, Father, oh precious Lord Jesus, oh God, we are not the police. We are not the judge to ask who fought it was and how did it happen. We just pray Lord and say they are in need. Oh God, they are in need. Father and until you step in the situation Lord God. Oh father it will be deadly Lord. We pray that you be merciful, Father God.

And uh we just we just thank the Lord. We thank the Lord for his goodness, for his love and mercy. And you know uh uh I was listening to uh uh news report and uh uh there's been a lot of uh situation in uh you know in Minneapolis with fraud cases and different things that is happening. I remember back uh during the time of the co and uh uh there's a group of people that wanted to come and bring us food and all sorts of things and uh uh at a time uh Jambi or bless the memory you know I met met him and talk and all of that and it really never sat right with me. It really never sat right with me. Uh for some reason I knew that uh you know there was co time you know uh shelves were empty and all of that but I just felt like okay are these food aspire foods or uh what what is what is the catch behind it and just to realize that all of that was part of all the fraud cases that is going on and it just brought some sense of peace to me that uh uh you know I mean they wouldn't have called me to court anyway you know, because I mean, I don't think they know me or they know the people that receive it, but the the thing that is just it just the good feeling to know that uh you know, you really didn't give into something just because there was a need, &gt;&gt; you know, it really really never felt right with me. So, I felt good about that. Sometimes good to feel good. Amen. We feel bad all the time. So, why not feel good? Praise the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. And uh uh you know I made a statement uh on Wednesday night when we were praying and just believing that uh and I came across this quote preacher brother sent this to me. Good friend of mine. We go back and forth and share thoughts and things on message testimony. Brother Brandon said this. He said this church was put here for the purpose. There is a spirit behind this church. Certainly spirit behind your home, behind every building, behind everything there is your motive and objective. This church come here to greatly exalt some human system or something. He said then it motive is not right. But if it is put here to try to achieve something for the kingdom of God, then the motive and objective both are right. If the motive is directly that way, amen. And like I said, we taking over the city. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether they like it or not, whether you like it or not. Amen. We just want for God to have his way. you know, taking over the city is not to achieve a great mega church, but just to be able to control the spirit of the city. Amen. Praise the Lord. Because I believe that because of a a righteous group of people, not our self-righteousness, but because we love the Lord, God can protect this city. God can bless this city. Amen. That uh we can be able to get a livelihood. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just be believe that you know it's is God's word just because of your dedication you know your your commitment to God can bless your company because you are dead amen just just one man that's what Abraham said is there one you know and God will save the city so uh uh you know we love that brother Brandon also said this in a message unpable sin he says uh but as a seer here who God shows vision. That's that not makes me any more than that drunker that was converted 10 minutes ago. Amen. He says that's right. He's a Christian. The same as I am. He go to the same heaven, enjoy the same blessings and the things that I hold or anybody else. There is no great people or big people in the kingdom of God. We are all one. That's right. &gt;&gt; Everybody just the same. Brothers and sister, whether you are yellow, black, white, wherever you are, we are one in Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And that's what we want to strive for. That's why we want to we want to strive for and uh uh just just uh you know pray that God will be able to bless us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's just sing that chorus. I thank God for the lighthouse. Just the chorus. Amen. I thank God for this lighthouse. I owe my life to him. Let's hear. Jesus is the lighthouse and from the rocks of sin. He has shown the light around me that I can clearly see a day for this house. where &gt;&gt; it should be. One more time now. I thank God for the lighthouse. I my life to him. Oh Jesus is the lighthouse from the ropes of heaven around me that I would &gt;&gt; I can clearly Seeing [Music] father is my house sh one more time again. I thank God &gt;&gt; for his life. my whole my life to him. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is the lighthouse from the cross of sin. He has sh around me that I see it may one thing for the house where will be [Music] The Lord bless you. Let's take our Bibles and uh thank you musicians. Thank you. Thank you for the music and uh helping the atmosphere. Praise the Lord. Amen. And Revelation chapter 4. Revelation chapter 4. I hope uh uh uh you know sharing these things uh be a blessing to you. Like I said, I'm not a teacher. uh a teacher would do a very good job, but I feel uh the inspiration of uh sharing some of these things to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm all over the place. I'm all over the place. And uh uh this morning, we just want to look at something. And when I look at my notes, I saw that that was back in uh uh 2016, I spoke on something like this. So, if you were here, you have forgotten. Amen. so I can preach it again. Praise the Lord. Amen. Revelation chapter 4. Amen. Let's uh let's uh uh Okay, for the scripture reading, let's just read from verse one. After this, I look and behold, a door was open in heaven. And uh the first voice which I heard was as a word the trumpet talking with me which said come up hiom and I will show thee things which must be hereafter. Then immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne. Brother man bake emphasis on this one on the throne not three. Amen. There's only one on the throne. And he that sat was to look upon as the jasper and sat in stone. And there was a rainbow around about the throne in inside like onto an amber. The amber color is produced by the reflection of the light from the jasper and the satin stones. Uh that reflection create an amber light. Amen. And then also uh in verse three, the rainbow was around the throne. Brother Brandon says he make emphasis on that when he used this statement. The half have never yet been told. So he said when God gave Noah the the rainbow, he gave him half of a rainbow. But when we get to the throne is a complete rainbow. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we only know half of the story of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what you know in the word, you just know half. &gt;&gt; The the the the fullness have not been told. Amen. Half of the story is not yet been told. So I just wanted to And around about the throne were four and and and and 24 seats. And upon the seats I saw four and 24 elders sitting clothed in white rim. And they had in their they had on their head crowns of gold. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; These 24 elders are the 12 apostles and uh the 12 patriots. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not it's not difficult to see that when brother Brandham said John saw himself because he was one of the 12 apostles. Amen. So when brother Brandham said when the seal opened and John saw himself, it was not like John seeing John that was born of his parents, but he saw a representation understanding that the 12 the 24 elders were the 12 apostles and the 12 patriots. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you can also see yourself when you know your where you are identified &gt;&gt; within there. We we will come to that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for helping me preaching because you are still standing. And out of the throne proceed uh likeness and thunders and boys and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God. We touched that last time. Verse six. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal. And in the midst of the throne and around about the throne were four be full of eyes before and behind. Watch that now. Eyes before and behind. But watch now. Pay attention. And uh the first beast was like a lion. The second uh beast like a cow. The third beast like the face of a man. And the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And the four beasts each had uh uh the four beasts had each of them six wings with him. And they have and they were four of eyes within. Now so the first verse say they have eyes before and behind. And this verse say they have eyes within. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh and and the and they rest not day and night saying, "Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty which was which is which is to come." That will also explain their eyes before behind and within which was which is to come. Let's pray. Father, we just want to thank you this morning, oh God, uh dear Lord, and and uh we just uh pray that you bless us in your presence and and uh that uh something of internal value be shared this morning. Something that will bring us closer, oh God, with better enlightenment, better understanding that the word in us will be quickened, Father. Lord, we thank you. We appreciate you, oh God. Father, and we just ask your blessings now. bless us in your presence and those that are streaming in the service this morning, we commit them into your hands as well. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat now. So uh uh uh uh if you can put my picture up. Let's remind oursel we've been talking about these uh these uh uh phobies. Praise the Lord. Our subject has been around this for a while now. I'm I'm I'm trying to see how uh I don't I don't feel like I'm leaving it soon. So, uh uh every time I I bring something later, I just want want to remind us. Here we have the four anointing and uh the the tapifi the the cherry beans and then on this side we have the four uh uh horse riders which also types the power that is waring against the church. This year types the church. Amen. And we read there in Isaiah chapter one where uh Isaiah speaks of uh you know coming to to the Lord in his holy mountain. So the congregation of God has always been tied as a mountain. The the the place of God. God took Moses on top of the mountain to give him the word. The act rested on top of the mountain. So it it just it just give us that sense of God's presence, God's house and all of that. Now, so uh what what we what we uh we were uh are drawn to to go into this is just to show us the powers that are waring against us. Amen. We fight not against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness in in high places. So we we we realize that uh there are these spirits, you know, that that uh that are waring against us. And as as we will look into uh I wanted to find a way to to break it down down in a way that where I was going to split all of these beasts and make the pyramid go little by little. Uh still working on that. But uh uh we realize here in revelation chapter 6. So if you read revelation chapter 4 what where where we have just read it it shows to us it identify these living creatures which is the lion, the ox, the man and the eagle. in Revelation chapter 6 brings us uh these uh uh uh horse and horse riders and and one of these say come and see and then they show us the white the white horse and he had a bold and and the crown was given to him. Now, so uh uh as as we look at this, we realize that uh these are these are the power. You go you go right back. We try to show that how brother Brandon says you can pick them up in the Old Testament. They has been there right from time. Amen. And uh uh and also this anointing has been guiding the church since uh the beginning. uh we see God pull the cherub bean in the in the garden of Eden to pro protect the tree of life. It was the presence of this anointing. Now another thing that we try to to you know to to uh uh remind you or say because in the old testament they were under the blood of bulls and goats. So this anointing and this power really never came to a clear view. They are there but they are not they are not visible as you can see them being visible in the book of revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because uh uh the church we have just come under the blood of Jesus Christ the sacrifice the the perfect atonement has been has been uh has been made. So uh uh under that blood we see things more clearer. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now so uh uh uh we trying trying to review here we see that this lion anointing uh was in the first three church ages. The first three church ages were under the lion anointing. Now also they first rather started here under these first three church ages in the beginning. That's the reason why the the power is why because it was very innocent. Amen. It was it was very innocent. It was just a thought. Praise the Lord. It was just a thought. But as it moved to the next age, it started becoming stronger. It started being established. And then when we got to the to the third church age, we we will find I will find time and and we will really go there because I I have another picture that will really explain it to us. I'm just trying to recap on something here. When it got to the third church age, that's the reason why in the first age he had a bowl. In the in the third age, he got a crown. That's where the trinity doctrine was crowned. Now, it has a crown. It has been given a throne. You know, it's now is now you know what among the people. Now, the ox anointing was only in the the fourth church age, which is the dark age. That was the age of great persecution and God anointed his people for that. The man anointing came up here uh with uh uh uh uh honor the man's anointing. Both uh the next three church ages will be under the man's anointing. Now the eagle anointing picks up from under the seven church age here and goes into the capstone age. It's a flying anointing. It picks up from Revelation chapter 3. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When when the Bible says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." &gt;&gt; Okay. So, uh he was standing at the door and knock. And brother Brandham said when he was doing that, then Revelation 18:4 sounded. He said, "Come out of all my people." &gt;&gt; We are. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? You see the thing about it then is that like like we shared the last time uh uh where brother Brandham says this is not a verse by verse happening. &gt;&gt; That is the reason why the book of revelation has been difficult for people to understand because it's not a verse by verse happening. &gt;&gt; Until God h give us a prophet we will now understand it. &gt;&gt; It's not a verse by verse happening. You see, so when Revelation 3 says, "Behold, I stand at the door and not uh uh when when when when when he was there at that time, the church has locked him out. So he was not going back into the church." So he he sounded Revelation 18:4, "Come out of my people." And then Revelation 4, what happened? The Bible say there was open door in heaven. The church closed his door or closed her door to Christ. But yet there is an open door in heaven which is a further revelation. Now God is taking the church out of her creed and dark mind into a further revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't think I've done a good job of reviewing but anyway &gt;&gt; we will we will get there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will get there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will get there. So this this morning and uh uh uh as we talk about this and we we we talk about where he says come and see you know uh uh the you know one of one of the uh the be said come and see and then he show us the house. So as we talk about there we also try to make us the Bible says uh uh he that overcome will be granted you know all the rewards of the overcomer was was promised through the church ages. How did the church overcame? John would tell us that they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the words of his testimony. the words of his testimony was what was given to these uh uh anointing as as as the message. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So you see actually is the message from this anointing or that that that influence the messenger through the church ages that make us overcomers. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are now overcoming in our power because he said it to Zachchariah. It's not by power. It's not by might but by my spirit say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So just like how we demonstrated here getting four brothers and we lock our arms together to show how the church is in the middle of the four beasts. Amen. The lion is here. The ox is here. The man is here. The eagle is here and their wings are locked together. I was I was listening to something this morning and brother Brian was talking about u he says how he says how how how was the week of that of that uh patron of my sons said he said how was the week form on Jesus he said it was the wings of the angels &gt;&gt; okay so it is the same thing here like I said it before it's the same thing when uh uh the when when Isaiah said his train filled the temple that pain was the locking of the angel's wing. He said it was moving about like a train. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's that is the way that uh this anointing are protecting the church because their wings are locked. Now you tell me now how can the devil ever get in a group of people like that when these beasts have eyes before they have eyes behind. They have eyes within. How is the devil ever going to sneak in that group &gt;&gt; unless God allowed him? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There is no way you can bypass uh h that anointing. You needs uh you needs uh you need h a person needs uh to be allowed. God has to allowed. Whatever comes upon the church, whatever comes upon the people, God has to allow it. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because the church is fully secure, fully protected, honor God's protection &gt;&gt; and nothing can harm us unless God allow it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's something like that we want to look at this morning. So just just trying to to build here. So we see here that uh uh uh Satan have this power waring against the church but yet God has an anointing. He has an anointing and like I said before even in our individual life we are influenced by this anointing. &gt;&gt; There's a time where you are you your faith is up. You are believing God. You you know you are under the lion's anointing. &gt;&gt; There is not one anointing that is constant to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need the ox anointing for the trial of your faith. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need the man's anointing for the understanding of the word. You need the ego anointing for for spiritual gifts. Entering the heavens, &gt;&gt; breaking in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Getting out of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Sometime just being &gt;&gt; and people think you crazy. Sometime the ego's anointing job you a little bit and it shakes you. You say, "What's wrong just now?" Amen. you. But the thing that is that you cannot be just like there was no church age that was on I mean all the church ages were not just on a one anointing but they were supported &gt;&gt; by every anointing. &gt;&gt; So every anointing support the believer individually. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I I I I try to bring this uh uh and then sometimes you know uh uh because we we we have come to this place where uh uh uh not understanding how God is dealing with us or how he dealt with us through the church ages. Sometime we can come to a place where we misunderstand what God is doing in our lives. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a person can can can come under an ox anointing a time of trial and they just think that maybe there is some kind of a family sin. There is some kind of a sin in their life. That's why this thing is happening. And and and you see the thing about it that it does not bother God because he knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you see then we have all of these uh uh uh preachers and false prophet in the age that are that are that are witch hunting. They tell you, "Oh no, you get a family line. You get a you know something in your family. Your your your great-grandparent was was this and that and all of that." Praise the Lord. The new birth, the new birth &gt;&gt; when we are born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The new birth starts a new generation in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are born again by by by you know by the word of God and you receive the spirit of God, it must be able to cut you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it brings you honor. Honor. God start dealing with you and you know that's that's the reason why at the beginning when you receive the Lord Jesus you know you are you are you are on fire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's that's a lion anointing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You ready to tell the truth any any word you ready to rebuke people. You want to save anybody. &gt;&gt; Right. Because you honor the lion's anointing is just an influence of it. The liar just passed by your side. That's all. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But then after the period of time things start happening in your life. &gt;&gt; Now if you don't understand it then you start questioning am I really safe? &gt;&gt; Why am I going through this? &gt;&gt; Why am I going through this? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; One time Job prosper. One time Job the Bible says the the children of the street came to him. When he pass in the marketplaces people bring their their problem their own problem. I mean, he was under the lion's anointing at that time, &gt;&gt; but then when his children died, his cattle died and everything died, God put him under the ox anointing. &gt;&gt; So, it's something that has been through all the ages. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is that is the reason why when brother Brandon preached the message influence, that's what he was trying to teach us. We are influenced by anointing. &gt;&gt; He says those those those angel influence Isaiah. It changed his influence because he was under the influence of Yuzia. But when he went into the presence of God and the angels move around his train filled the temple. He was lifted up it influenced him. &gt;&gt; So just like how Isaiah got influenced. We are under the influence of seven angels that have opened the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Our influence is not coming from from Jeffersonville. Our influence is not coming from a church. Our influence is coming from seven angels &gt;&gt; that open the book and reveal the seals. &gt;&gt; So there is nothing you can do without influence. Just just remind yourself &gt;&gt; the question we must ask is what is influencing me? &gt;&gt; You cannot do anything without influence. &gt;&gt; Another thing there is that you are influencing somebody. &gt;&gt; Somebody is influencing you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have have an existing without influence. You are influencing somebody or somebody is influencing you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is just my introduction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just my introduction. I don't want to forget that we have a prayer meeting tonight and uh with with a community service. So, you are welcome if you have the time to be with us. And then also we will be having brother forest farmer uh coming from u um I sir to be with us uh next Sunday and uh uh uh Saturday and Sunday sorry that will be the first and the second of uh November and then on Wednesday that's supposed to be the fourth if my dates are right we'll be Brother Andre from Germany.

But if you can come this Wednesday, come also. Amen. &gt;&gt; We love to we love to see you. We always love to see you. Now, so that's that's what we want to that's what we want to deal with this morning. So uh uh uh we cannot do anything without influence. We cannot do anything. Uh you go you go to the book of of Daniel. Daniel show us how politics is under this influence. The word powers they are under this influence. &gt;&gt; It's from the bottomless pit. &gt;&gt; Put whoever you want on the throne. &gt;&gt; It's not the man is the influence. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It's not the man is the influence. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So Revelation 6 now show us this influence. Now when you read there the Bible say it was where? before the throne. Before the throne, these four beasts, they were before the throne. That's what that's that's what I want I want us to think about. So, you must realize that uh uh uh uh we are being influenced directly from the throne of God, &gt;&gt; not from some hellquarter. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Directly from the throne of God because this anointing are before the throne. &gt;&gt; Now, so when you look there also, there is something that I want to go into this morning. I'm just I'm just uh uh all over the place, but uh we will soon land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so you read down here, you find another thing that we talk about. Verse 5. And out of the throne proceed lightning and thunder and voices. And there were seven seven lamps of uh fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God. We started talking about the seven spirits of God the other Wednesday night and we chose you know is is you know uh uh there is there is one Holy Spirit but these seven spirits of God the they the uh the uh let let me show you something. Uh praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh let's go to the book of Isaiah. Let's go to the book of Isaiah. If uh if uh you know if I'll be able to remember now, let me see if I can run there before you. I thought I was going to share this with you. Okay, let's let's Okay. Isaiah Isaiah chapter 11. Isaiah chapter 11. Isaiah chapter 11. I want you to to pay attention here. And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse. A branch shall grow out of his root. Who is this? Jesus Christ. He's the root and the offspring of David. &gt;&gt; Jesse is the father of David. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So this is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now listen now. Verse two. And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him. The spirit of wisdom, the spirit of understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What do you see in it? &gt;&gt; What do you see in it? If you pay close attention, there are seven spirits. So these are the ingredients of the seven spirits. &gt;&gt; These are the ingredients. &gt;&gt; Each each of the seven spirits that will dwell on the seven messenger of the of the angel will have these ingredients. &gt;&gt; It will have to be the spirit of the Lord. It will be the spirit of wisdom. It will be the spirit of understanding. It will be the spirit of that's the ingredients. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the fear of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, man, I'm using all my time on the review. Amen. &gt;&gt; But, uh what what what I note is that uh uh uh I think I think it's a blessing to somebody. Somebody is pulling it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I want to go into what I want to go into and yet I keep hanging around here. So &gt;&gt; So this these are the ingredients of the seven spirits. So each of these ministers or each of these messenger of the ages will have to have the spirit of the Lord. The pre the primary thing they will have the spirit of wisdom. They will have the spirit to be able to deal with what they were dealing with in their age. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, yeah, you you can you can read it. You can read the rest and when you get home and uh put that in your notes. Let's go forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go forward because if not, we're not going to move from you. Revelation chapter 4. That's where we are. Now, what I want to talk about this this uh this morning is the seed of glass. I want to talk about a seat of glass. I was sitting down, you know, uh uh doing some few few counseling, talking to to different few folks and and uh uh you know u so uh uh Sister Bu your question or whatever we talk about kind of a influence drove me into this because I was just sitting there and I was just asking the Lord, how can I get back into the subject? What should I pick up? And then uh uh she shared uh something with me. She shared a dream with me. And then when we got through praying, I just felt it in my heart. Okay, that's what needed you need to deal with. So, so that's what I want to talk about this morning, the seed of glass. So when you read Revelation chapter 4, the uh the the scripture led us to know those four anointing that we have up here. Okay. uh and uh they were before the throne of God. Now you come to verse 6. Revelation 4:6. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A sea of glass that is like unto crystal is a sea that is transparent. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's what it means. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; It's a sea that is transparent. You can see through it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now, you have to realize that all of these things are are symbols, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But we can find the representation in the Old Testament, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do. So, the the seed of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and around the throne were the four beasts full of eyes behind before and behind. Now, so we also see now the the the the four beasts are also now associated with this sea of glass. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all is before the throne. So if they are the influence that are that are that are the anointing that is protecting the the the throne, then they are also protecting this seat of glass. That's what I want. That's that's where I want to bring the the the the the study to this morning. They are also protecting the seat of glass. So what is this seed of glass? That's what we want to look into. Amen. What is the sea of glass? Now let's let's just take some of our notes here. It will help us to go quickly. Uh Revelation Revelation uh chapter 4 uh the throne of mercy. Let's get to our quote. Let's take this and then we can be able to uh go into it quickly. Revelation chapter 4. Now, now we want to study it just a little bit. The sea of glass is is symbolized in the Old Testament. So in the Old Testament, there is a representation because when Moses came down from the mountain, God gave him a pattern to build a tabernacle according to the faction in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever he was going to build that was going to be that tabernacle has its representation before the throne of God. Are we together? So we see that the seed of glass is is symbolized in Moses tabernacle. For Moses was commanded of God to build a tabernacle on earth like he saw in heaven. Everyone knows that. All right. And and and let me just draw a little bit here. Trying to uh draw the Old Testament tabernacle. All right. Right. Next h uh this was called the holiest of holy. That that is the holy place. The next place was the altar. It was called the holy place. And right before was the sea of glass. It was called in other word it was the place where the sacrifice was the sea of brass. Amen. The sea of brass was called. Now, if you look at the Old Testament tabernacle, there were three mineral rod that were that were permanently used. It was br, silver, and gold. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The outside part of the tabernacle was fashioned with brass. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brass symbolize judgment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? The inside of the tabernacle if you read Exodus or Leviticus you'll find out there all the tables they are stand they were all sitting on savor. &gt;&gt; Yeah &gt;&gt; that represent redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then in the holiest of holy the ark of the covenant was built with what? Gold. &gt;&gt; Representing deity. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So brass was on the outside representing judgment. Savor was in the on the inside representing rep I mean redemption and then gold was in the holiest of holy. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; now? So this was called in the old testament uh the sea of brass. Why? Because the lava that the water was put in to wash the sacrifice was made out of brass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Between brass, silver, and gold, brass can stand more fire more than the other two. So brass is a symbol of judgment. Are we together? Now, so uh uh uh just to give you so in the Old Testament, it was called the sea of brass because it was it was a water that was put into a brass lav for the watching of the sacrifice before, you know, uh uh uh it will be killed and be and be offered for the people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So here in the New Testament or in the book of Revelation is called the sea of glass like crystal. But in the Old Testament it was called the sea of brass. Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you follow me, if we stay together, we will arrive. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will arrive. &gt;&gt; So let's read down a little bit. Uh uh uh uh. It was the place where the sacrifice was watched year before they was received at the altar at their bride altar or the brazing altar where the sacrifice was burned. This was called the sea of brides. It wasn't quite big. It was uh set over more or less positionally in the temple. It was set alone about like this. All right. I wish that I had a picture of the old of the tabernacle, but let's just go. It will it will just it will throw me off. Let's go. Uh it was a sea of brass. It was a lava made out of brass where they washed the sacrifice. And before the sacrifice was burned or accepted, it had to be washed. Before the sacrifice was received to God, it first got to be washed. not emotionally but watched by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So whatever was done in the Old Testament uh uh the the sacrifice was watch the the the priest was watch. Amen. &gt;&gt; The believers was were watched. The sacrifice was watch. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before the the priest would go into his uh into his service, he had to wash his feet also in the brazing lava before he goes into into the holy place. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now you will see Jesus comes and just before his crucification, he take a basin and he start washing the disciples feet. And Peter said, "No, you're not going to wash my feet." Not me. No. Jesus said what I'm doing you don't understand it now. He said well then then just wash my whole body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus said he whose feet is washed don't need his whole body to be washed. Now so what is happening is that earlier Jesus have told them you are clean by the words that I have spoken to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But yet he's bringing an Old Testament representation to the disciples and he's going to tell them that before the priest comes into his office there is a general body watch. Moses put him in a basin and wash him, anoint him and dress him. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the general watch. But for every service, every time that he will go into the the the tabernacle, he have to wash his feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That was for daily sacrifice. When we when we come to the Lord, Paul says we are watched by the water of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He he he sanctified us. He draw us to ourself. But we need a daily watch. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need a daily watch where the Holy Spirit will be able to touch those little places in our life where we need to bring on our prayers. We need to commit it to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see that this whole sea of brass or sea of glass it all has a representation of watching. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So now the influence of the four beasts around the the the the sea of glass is that uh these beasts uh h are uh influence. Like I said they are beasts of influence. the the they influence uh uh our cleansing and let let me say it that way uh in a sense that uh uh uh they are the anointing in in each age that is given to the church to be able to measure up to God for that age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say that again. We see the the the the sea of glass before the throne. And yet we see these four beasts that are are creatures of influence. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in Revelation chapter 4, you you will soon you will soon see uh uh uh where the picture gets beautiful. In Revelation chapter 4, the Bible says, "This sea of glass is like crystal." &gt;&gt; Amen. is clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What does that represent? The reveal word, the open book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's clear. When you look inside, you must be able to see yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The very same thing like James says, the word of God is looking like in a mirror. &gt;&gt; The reason why it's clear is because it has to be reflective. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What happened in the Old Testament tabernacle? When you go to the lava to wash your feet, there is a light coming from the shakana glory that shines in the lava and you see yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now on this side is a is is crystal. The reason why it is crystal is because it's reflective. &gt;&gt; You must be we must be able to see ourself in the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must be able to see ourself in the preaching of the word. That is the influence that is coming from this anointing around the throne. Not seeing somebody else, not preaching somebody else. We must be able to see ourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; And you see uh uh uh uh the more that's the reason why we need a daily watch because the more that we we we look into the word that's why it's crystal it becomes clearer. &gt;&gt; We start to see things clearer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me take you down a little journey here this morning. Am I open to you? Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God called Abraham, the Bible says &gt;&gt; God told him he will make him a father of nations. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Abraham was seeking for a city. &gt;&gt; Whom maker and builder is God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe when when Abraham met me because he was he was he was a king and a priest. Abraham thought he has arrived. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You realize that Abraham looked for the city all through his life. But the thing about it then is that every time he was going he was guessing that this might be the place. Then he realized it's not the place but he got an understanding and God bless him. Then he moved to the next place. He thinking that this might be the place. He realized that it is not the place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I was looking at this yesterday. It really blessed me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrew chapter 11 verse uh 10 the Bible says let's read that it really blessed me yesterday 11:10 the Bible says 11:10 okay I thought they would get there before me but I'm there before them for he looked for a city which have foundation s whose builder and maker is God. &gt;&gt; Where was this city's foundation? &gt;&gt; What was the foundation of the city? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was looking for a city whose builder and maker. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at those words very closely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At one time and and and and Abraham thought that this was a physical city, &gt;&gt; but as he kept going along with God and he kept going along with God, he starts to realize that this this might be something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a physical city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Then Jesus would come and said you are a city on the hill. &gt;&gt; So what what Abraham was looking for outside was in him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The city was in him and he was looking for it. &gt;&gt; Is that not the same thing that we are doing? &gt;&gt; Whatever you are looking for in this world is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You are a city on the hill &gt;&gt; that cannot be hid." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Revelation, the new Jerusalem, come down like a bride, &gt;&gt; a door for her husband." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was looking for the physical city &gt;&gt; when God was building a city within him. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says, "Who builder and makerise?" &gt;&gt; When God, Genesis 1, the Bible says God made man in his image. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the maker. He made man in his image. &gt;&gt; In the New Testament, Peter let us know he's building a church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So he made man in his image and he's building a bride. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; according to his character, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Who's builder and maker? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the the sooner we realize that uh we are more spirit being &gt;&gt; put in the flesh &gt;&gt; to discover who you are. God put you in the flesh so you can discover who you are. &gt;&gt; So you can discover what is in you. &gt;&gt; That is the mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, one day we realize that heaven is not a place physically that we are going. It's just a dimension. And that dimension is here. Jesus said when they say that the kingdom come, don't look left, don't look right because the kingdom is in you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Ah when we start paying attention to what God is doing in us and you start you start taking more value to yourself than those people on Facebook than those people that you watch on television. If you start appreciating what the grace of God is doing in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll get closer to God. That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It took me a while to get here, &gt;&gt; but I'm ready to preach. &gt;&gt; It took me a while to get right here. &gt;&gt; This is where I was struggling to get. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is where I was struggling to get. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So now I can preach. You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was looking for a city who build a maker is God. You hear about what Lot and and and is achieving down there in Sodom. I mean being being a human being he could get discouraged. Man this this this was just my nephew. I brought him alone and now he has finally a city that he's prospering. Where is my city? &gt;&gt; He was carrying his city alone. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was carrying his city alone. &gt;&gt; If he could just stop and why &gt;&gt; and say, "Who am I &gt;&gt; that God would come in flesh and visit with me? Who am I? [Applause] Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Happiness does not comes from the things &gt;&gt; that we acquired. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can't get it in you, you will not get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can't get it in you, you will not get it. Healing don't comes from the doctors. The doctors only facilitate. &gt;&gt; But healing is in you. &gt;&gt; Why they have to take your blood? &gt;&gt; The doctor take your blood. &gt;&gt; If they had healing, you will go there and say I'm sick. They say okay wait. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Take it. You are healed. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; They say sit down. &gt;&gt; What wrong with you? Let's let test your paws first. &gt;&gt; They are looking for healing in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; They are searching for it. &gt;&gt; Saying you don't know that healing in you. They are looking for [Applause] &gt;&gt; take the blood. They swap one. You coming for blood again? Yeah. Yeah. We're coming to take blood. They thinking &gt;&gt; they take another one. They come back again. &gt;&gt; They are looking for healing. &gt;&gt; It's in you. my my &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why poverty is just a concept &gt;&gt; that is plaguing the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But for the fact that you we can wake up &gt;&gt; and you have the breath of life &gt;&gt; that is the most expensive thing. &gt;&gt; Even the people in Hollywood &gt;&gt; the richest men don't have money for to pay for the breath of life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have the breath of life, you are rich. &gt;&gt; You are wealthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Since you can breathe, you are without [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's right there in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All you have to do just a nourish it. Appreciate it &gt;&gt; every day. Appreciate it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why you appreciating what other people have and you don't want to appreciate the one you have. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Ecclesiastes chapter 3. &gt;&gt; Let's let's just touch this and we close here since we have to come back this evening for prayer meeting. Uh you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see the seat of glass is transparent. You have to look in it. And when you look in it, you see yourself. &gt;&gt; That's what the word is all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. You look inside, you must see your don't see somebody else. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't appreciate somebody else. &gt;&gt; When you start to to to learn to value the grace that God has given you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you start becoming healthy. You start becoming happier. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You start becoming rich. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this this is Ecclesiastes chapter 3. This is a famous very famous chapter and uh that's that's one of the chapter I mean uh every every every Bible student Bible reader knows a time for everything. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A time and a season for everything. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you have to read this closely and ask yourself what is this man saying? What is the preacher saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A time for everything. A time to be born. A time to die. Amen. &gt;&gt; A time to kill, a time to be broken. Now, in one sense, if you take it a little bit, you will you can you can apply it to the influence that we just talked about. Moving from under one influence to another, moving from under one uh one beast, influence of of an anointing to another might carry us through all of this. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember remember that uh let's go to Genesis. We'll come back to to Ecclesiastes, but let's go to Genesis. It's uh this is uh one of my uh favorite chapter. I think that's chapter 28 if I'm if I'm right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter Did I say chapter 28? I think I'm telling guys I'm not supposed to. It's chapter 8, not 28. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's chapter 8. Listen to this now. God speaking to Noah and says chapter 20. Chapter 8 verse 22. That's where the 20 come from. Chapter 822. While the earth remainth, While the earth remainth, sea time, harvest, &gt;&gt; cold, heat, summer, &gt;&gt; winter, day, night shall not cease. It's the same thing that Solomon is saying, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; in Ecclesiastes chapter 3, there's a time for everything. God is telling Noah as long as this earth remains. So also it bring us back to our principle. There is no one constant anointing. &gt;&gt; You will always have this uh you always you know there will always be this this this thing where you are you are up and down. You know that's that's what life is. It's a struggle. It's a fight. &gt;&gt; You just have to understand what is happening. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'm going through a trial, it's not a sound of God's rejection. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why Paul would say, uh, you know, we rejoice in our tri. If you don't understand it, you will not rejoice in it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You will not rejoice in it. God, please, you honor that anointing. You knowh is it's is it's is it's even seen in our health. It's seen in h sicknesses. We'll get there if uh if uh if we don't burn all our time yet. So we see here is the same as long as the earth remains. As long as you are in this body because this body is from the earth. &gt;&gt; As long as this body remains, you will always have a seeding time. There will be a time where things will be sold in your life. What I'm doing this morning, I'm planting seeds in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you will have a harvest time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You will have a just is coming. Not too long. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; A cold is coming. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will have winter. You have day and night. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes chapter 3. Let's get there quickly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something I want to I want to pick up from you. Are we together &gt;&gt; now? So you go through, we go through all of those seasons and everything and Solomon says all of that and then he comes to this place of uh uh chapter 3 verse verse 10. Let's take verse 10. He says, "I have seen a a a travel which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. This is for our exercise that that our gym work here. &gt;&gt; Your gym is to be able to understand what is happening around you. &gt;&gt; God has given us this thing for us to exercise ourself in it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because our destiny is determined by him. &gt;&gt; It's not determined by what season we are in. &gt;&gt; It's not determined by what is going on around our life. He has just given it to us for us to exercise ourself, &gt;&gt; exercise our mind, exercise your faith &gt;&gt; to be able to understand what is happening in the moment that is happening. That is the thing that rejoice the father. &gt;&gt; Not not not our complaints and our argument and our fusses and looking for somebody to blame and all of that. I know &gt;&gt; that don't help the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've seen the trial which God had given to the sons of men to be exercised in verse 11. He have made everything beautiful in his time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. will go through all of it, but in his time &gt;&gt; it will be beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Also, he has said the word. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you read in the amplifier, it says that he has put eternity &gt;&gt; in the heart of men. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He have set a word in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can we can we can put ourself on diet. We can put oursel on this discipline. The doctors can put you on this medication. I it's it's it's just it's just like that uh you know that that little uh uh uh thing in the vehicle where you put on it you get you get into the side of the road there push your vehicle here like this &gt;&gt; it just push you back on on the lane that just all what this thing is doing it's not really determined. Amen. If you fall asleep, you're going over that road. It's not going to push you back. It reject you. If you if you are not awake, you'll find yourself somewhere else. Now, but what am I saying here is the uh God gave us these things for us to exercise ourself in. Why? Because he have placed in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Paul says we are having &gt;&gt; heavenly treasures &gt;&gt; that is put in vessel. That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus said it like this. He said, "It's a man that found a treasure in the field." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And because he found a treasure in the field, so what he did? He bought the entire field. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He bought the entire field &gt;&gt; because there is a treasure in the field. &gt;&gt; And what is that field? All through what it's been tapping land and spaces, but now it's a people. &gt;&gt; It's a body. &gt;&gt; Will thou prepare me? &gt;&gt; A body &gt;&gt; that God has dropped a deposit of himself in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that we never knew about. We just thought we were uh you know what? Whoever we were, our tribe, our names, our country, whatever it is, but then the grace of God brought us to the place where something spark in our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We start to we start to have a little sense of consciousness &gt;&gt; of what grace is doing around our life. &gt;&gt; That is the thing we need to pay attention to. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you just realize the Bible says when God made man, he made man in his image and God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; So Genesis chapter 1:26, you were made a spirit person. &gt;&gt; And then 2:7, he put you in flesh so you can discover who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why people discover? &gt;&gt; Because things are covered. Amen. &gt;&gt; People make discovery of things that are cover. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you see that is the representation we see here. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. I can't get this thing out of my head. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then I realize I don't have time to say everything. &gt;&gt; And then it's there in my head. I might go crazy. I might go crazy. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; I read one thing to you and then we close. &gt;&gt; Because if I keep you, Lord, we won't have time to If you can put my Revelation chapter 5 uh uh quotes up. Let's read it together and we close. Let me close this Bible. Let me close this note and then let's just read this together so we can be able to pray. Follow me as I think it come to a time that when we have got to know how to how we stand. &gt;&gt; We have got to know how we stand. Paul said in Ephesians chapter 8 he said take on the whole armor of God to be able to withstand and having done this stand. &gt;&gt; Then in verse 14 he said stand. We must know how to stand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How to stand. How can you do anything unless you got faith in what you are doing? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe it, then forget about it. It's not going to work. You have got to have faith. and and and and that is my purpose of doing this with the church here is to give the believers faith and confidence in what they are standing for because it is the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Then as long as uh through the scripture sovereignly place from from Genesis to Revelation back and forth up and down not a way for the devil to move in there and away then then you've got perfect confidence. Praise the Lord. Knowing where you are standing because you you you have been able to look at it thoroughly through the word of God. what I'm doing, my choices. Is this thing the word of God or I'm just only pleasing myself? &gt;&gt; I'm just stuck on a on a on a on an attitude or stuck on a on a habit and then find some kind of a thing uh uh uh uh some kind of a uh uh Bible verse or man concept to appease myself to back myself up. No, it must be it must be thoroughly looked at through the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Something will be like our sister here that is in a wheelchair or maybe others that are sick and afflicted. You can you can have perfect understanding. Listen to this. I I was looking for this for the long time because I I had it somewhere and then uh I couldn't find it but it was it was beautiful when I saw it. You can have perfect understanding that is God's good pleasure to make you well. There isn't enough devil in the country to keep you sick. Now listen to this now. Listen to this. Because the person is sick. She's in the wheelchair, but she's been she's been encouraged to have perfect understanding that it is not God desire &gt;&gt; for me to be in this wheelchair. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having that understanding &gt;&gt; creates something in her &gt;&gt; to stand up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. She might try to, &gt;&gt; she can make it. But she's saying to herself, it is not my God's desire &gt;&gt; for me to be in this wheelchair. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's having a perfect understanding. Even though her body has not come to that place, &gt;&gt; even though things are all in her body, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. But she stole a place of perfect understanding. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not an automatic thing. &gt;&gt; It's a principle. &gt;&gt; It's a principle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at look at that that that little old woman we showed this morning. She was not bad. You came in. Came and go to heaven. and then you go to hell. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She was not terrified &gt;&gt; because she have resolved in her heart &gt;&gt; that if death meet her today, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, she's going to heaven. &gt;&gt; Whether it is by an accident, whether is you want to send me quicker, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, or whether is she has resolved in her heart &gt;&gt; that wherever death meets her, &gt;&gt; she's going to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a settled thing for her. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's an understanding. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Jesus puzzle an Nicodemus. You being a preacher, a scholar, and you don't understand these things. &gt;&gt; Then what is driving your faith? It's just your creed and dogma. &gt;&gt; You are doing things to please the church. It's not real to you. He said you being a rabbi, you don't understand this thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the power of understanding which is not knowledge. It's different. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You read proverb, you see Paul, I mean Solomon, he brings out three things. Wisdom, &gt;&gt; knowledge, &gt;&gt; and understanding. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The worst of the three is knowledge &gt;&gt; because Paul tells you that knowledge puff up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is very proud. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Like the sister here in the wheelchair or maybe others that are sick and afflicted. If you have a perfect understanding that it is not God's good pleasure, &gt;&gt; I don't know when, I don't know how, but I know it's not God good pleasure &gt;&gt; for me to be like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know it is not God good pleasure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can't find anything in the word that tells me &gt;&gt; that I have to be like this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are &gt;&gt; we together? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that God good pleasure? &gt;&gt; There there isn't enough devil &gt;&gt; in the country. &gt;&gt; As long as that is established on your heart, &gt;&gt; there isn't enough devil &gt;&gt; in the country. &gt;&gt; Amen. the one from India &gt;&gt; and from France, they can all come and join them. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; But this believer knows where he's standing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She knows where she's standing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. When you understand that is God's good pleasure to make you well, when you understand that what bother you matters to him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's just understanding. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's all the mind. &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you &gt;&gt; that was in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; If we can just work on our mind, direct our mind in the right places, &gt;&gt; think on the right things. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you understand that it's God's good pleasure to make you well, &gt;&gt; that he has did it for you. It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; You know, it's not like when we pray now, let's pray. Let's pray for this brother. And when we pray now, then God will not say, "Okay, angels, they are finished praying. I just saw good shepherd pray for that brother. &gt;&gt; Let's No, no, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Amen. But say if Jesus was here this morning, you come to him, he will say, "I've already done it." &gt;&gt; It is for you to understand it &gt;&gt; and accept it. &gt;&gt; And begin to step into it because it's already done. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you stop begging God. &gt;&gt; He's already done it. is for you to believe it &gt;&gt; and condition your mind &gt;&gt; to constantly tell yourself, "It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's a finished work." &gt;&gt; Satan, I don't care what you say is already done. &gt;&gt; I need grace daily to walk into it. He did it for you and you understand that how that you are you are to go to do a certain thing. It's like this. If I told you with all of my heart, you were hungry and starving to death and and and and and you had a supreme confidence in me as a a truthful person. And I told you where there was a thousand dollar laying. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How you did get it, what what road you will go, exactly where to go. You know, as I was reading this, I was thinking of a bird down testimony. I was in the office. &gt;&gt; I was saying to myself, I was say, "If I find this money, I will testify." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "If I find this money, that desperation people Praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; You know, I was I was talking with a brother. We were, you know, just having some conversation and you know, it was almost like, you know, some people testify and then you send them, you send the deacons to come and take them off there and cut their testimony. Now we just had that conversation and here to deacon giving his testimony. He's thinking all the time I'm saying there Lord Jesus. Oh father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh praise the Lord. Glory be to God. I said they're going to chew me on this one again. But you see that like I always say I've been bored. I've been fried. I've been roasted. They have some driving. &gt;&gt; So I don't know what you would do that would deter me. But just love me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And bear with me &gt;&gt; like this. If I told you that there is a $1,000 and you go get it, the road you will take exactly where to go and you understand exactly where the money is laid. See? Then will you start rejoicing right then? For sure. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just the same as you have the money if you believe me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The thing about it there, sir, the thing about it there is that you will not even go to that place. &gt;&gt; If you believe me, you will not go. You you already know it's there. So, you go do some other things because you know it's there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The the weight &gt;&gt; of your knee will just vanish. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you were desperately looking and and and searching, that weight will just vanish. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see before you ever get there feel any different or anything else you can you can just as uh happen over your healing in saying you got it because you are positive show you got it because you got confidence in the one that promising to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your confidence is that he cannot lie. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he and he told you exactly where it was lame. Amen. You got confidence that you are you are going. You got it already because that your faith wish is the earnest of your redemption. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In other words, you are trying &gt;&gt; to be redeemed from sickness and your faith is the substance &gt;&gt; of that bless or rather is the earnest of your healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as as something says in your heart, I am the Lord that heals you. &gt;&gt; You can rest assure you will walk out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. musicians you can come that's just as good. Oh, you can start just as happy no matter what happen. But you see the thing about it is that it's hard for us to raise our faith above our symptoms. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the symptoms is there. The symptoms get a hold of us and you think that you don't have faith but it's there. It's live. It's hard for you to hard for you to channel it. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads this afternoon. &gt;&gt; Fill my cup, Lord. Let's just sing this offering now to the Lord.
