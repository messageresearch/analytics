[39:31] conversation out there and he said he
[39:33] was passing by and he heard you know uh
[39:37] the music I I mean the Sunday school was
[39:39] going on at the time so he just came
[39:42] around and he asked when service starts
[39:45] and when service closes and then he said
[39:49] he wasn't prepared but he just said I
[39:53] will stay that would not kill me it will
[39:55] make me better
[39:57] praise the
[39:58] Lord

[53:57] I was going to speak on the people of
[53:59] the atonement this morning but the Lord
[54:02] uh impressed this one strongly in my
[54:06] heart uh and I hope it's a blessing to
[54:12] somebody ABAC chapter
[54:14] 2 verse 2- 4 and then we shall read also
[54:19] Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11
[54:31] if you are there say
[54:34] heyen and the Lord answered and said
[54:38] write the vision and make it plain upon
[54:41] tables that he may run that reth it for
[54:46] the vision is yet for an appointed time
[54:50] but at the end it shall speak and not
[54:54] lie though it t
[54:57] wait for it because it will surely come
[55:01] it will not
[55:03] t behold his soul which is lifted up is
[55:08] not upright in him but the just shall
[55:12] live by his
[55:14] faith
[55:15] amen Jeremiah chapter
[55:19] 29 the 11th verse
[55:30] he said for I know the thoughts that I
[55:33] think towards you sayith the Lord
[55:37] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[55:41] give you an expected
[55:43] hand may the Lord add His blessings to
[55:46] the reading of his holy word God bless
[55:49] you may please be
[55:54] seated I'd like to greet every one of
[55:57] you this morning in the name of the Lord
[56:00] Jesus Christ amen and uh I want to thank
[56:05] God
[56:06] for uh making it possible for me to pass
[56:09] by here I never thought I would be able
[56:11] to pass by I was just going to
[56:16] quietly uh move through the east coast
[56:18] to the
[56:19] Caribbean and uh but the
[56:24] pastor challenged me int
[56:28] intentionally and
[56:31] uh I find out that it looks like I was
[56:33] committing a sin by that Omission so I
[56:38] had to make
[56:39] restitutions and that somehow we're able
[56:42] to work it out uh for me to be here
[56:46] today and I'm so grateful for the
[56:50] opportunity and I thank him also very
[56:52] much for his
[56:54] confidence uh to have me stand before
[56:57] the people of God and uh even in his
[57:00] absence he didn't tell me it wasn't
[57:02] going to be around but at a point you
[57:06] know we were sled for a meeting together
[57:09] uh to help attend to some matters in the
[57:13] uh East Coast so but at a point shortly
[57:16] before I came it said you know you know
[57:18] how your pastor
[57:19] talks he navigated and uh pass it to me
[57:23] in a way so I was wondering okay what
[57:27] will that mean will it mean it will be
[57:29] here or it will not be here but by the
[57:32] time we we had the meeting uh it became
[57:35] clear to me that it wasn't going to be
[57:37] here and uh well all is well I think
[57:41] this was the certain the Lord saw before
[57:42] the foundation of the world and it's
[57:45] just good enough for us to be in the
[57:46] program of God so I'm glad I'm here
[57:49] today uh in the will of the Lord and I'm
[57:53] glad to see everyone of you uh doing
[57:56] well in the Lord also I bring the
[57:59] greetings of the Saints back in Nigeria
[58:02] and that of my wife in the house they
[58:05] are all doing well by the grace of God
[58:09] I've uh it's been a journey of few week
[58:12] uh few weeks for me now uh though I had
[58:15] a small break in Nigeria coming from
[58:18] Canada United Kingdom and then here and
[58:21] uh all the saints along the way they
[58:23] told us you know they will ask where am
[58:25] I where will will I be next and once I
[58:28] tell them they said you must carry our
[58:29] greetings to the Brethren there so I
[58:32] don't know I don't know you will meet
[58:33] who you will not meet just in case you
[58:36] meet somebody and say did that brother
[58:39] pass our greetings please let them know
[58:41] I did thank you very much God bless you
[58:45] and uh I was warmly received yesterday I
[58:48] appreciate BR arel for uh doing my
[58:51] airport and the church
[58:53] runs thank you and uh thank the pastor's
[58:56] wife and the old Mama there also for
[58:59] their cares glad to see all of you my
[59:02] land lady where she where she okay she
[59:04] stepped out glad to see you br sit here
[59:07] and ah BR P sister Jen yeah I can
[59:11] mention all of you now all right but let
[59:14] me spear that so we can have more time
[59:16] for the word the Lord bless you richly
[59:18] it's just expressing my heart of joy
[59:21] that at last I was able to be here God
[59:24] bless you all right God helping us this
[59:28] morning which I believe he will I want
[59:31] to speak on the subject that was so
[59:34] impressed upon my heart that replaced
[59:37] what I had in
[59:38] mind it is uh the vision is for an
[59:42] appointed
[59:43] time the vision is for an appointed time
[59:48] uh from the scripture that we read in
[59:50] the book of
[59:52] ABAC uh the prophet of God was saying
[59:57] uh the vision is for an appointed time
[1:00:00] he said though it
[1:00:03] t wait for it then he also said it will
[1:00:07] not
[1:00:10] t ahuh so the Bible is not actually
[1:00:15] contradicting itself but the scripture
[1:00:18] is taking into account that uh the
[1:00:22] interaction of that scripture is between
[1:00:24] two dimensions
[1:00:28] the one who is speaking lives in
[1:00:31] eternity Dimension we time does not
[1:00:35] matter and the one who is been spoken to
[1:00:38] lives in a Time Dimension where time
[1:00:41] counts you understand and uh how you
[1:00:45] begin to appreciate the scripture is
[1:00:47] this uh the Bible said uh a day in
[1:00:51] eternity is as a thousand years on Earth
[1:00:55] is that right right so if the Lord gives
[1:00:57] you a promise
[1:00:59] now and uh you are looking at your clock
[1:01:03] and you say it's 10 years I've been
[1:01:05] waiting for this thing and uh you are
[1:01:08] bothering God in prayers I'm just giving
[1:01:10] an illustration then he will look at his
[1:01:13] own time and say Bo it's just some few
[1:01:15] seconds away away that I talk to this
[1:01:17] can't this child just be a little
[1:01:19] patient few seconds so that is why what
[1:01:23] looks like it's staring before you
[1:01:26] is just in time before God and that is
[1:01:30] why the scripture said though itari is
[1:01:32] speaking your language there he said you
[1:01:34] wait for it but hope there nothing
[1:01:37] ties because everything happens
[1:01:40] according to the appointed
[1:01:42] season and I want this understanding to
[1:01:45] register in our heart very
[1:01:48] deeply and to know that look we
[1:01:52] ourselves we the thoughts of God
[1:01:55] expressed
[1:01:56] you understand and the thoughts of God
[1:02:00] they are very real and very certain
[1:02:04] nothing can be added to it nothing can
[1:02:06] be taken away from it so if you are that
[1:02:10] expressed thought the beginning of your
[1:02:12] Advent on Earth till you will live it's
[1:02:16] all an unfolding of God's thought are
[1:02:19] you following so really nothing can be
[1:02:22] added nothing can be taken away from it
[1:02:26] brother Braham said it gives you
[1:02:28] yourself an eternal quality because you
[1:02:31] came from the mind of God now in that
[1:02:34] Mind Of God he had
[1:02:37] season that he has appointed for certain
[1:02:40] things in your
[1:02:42] life and until God comes to its season
[1:02:46] by his thoughts conclusion about you
[1:02:50] what you are expecting may not come to
[1:02:54] pass now the the challenge we have is
[1:02:57] for human beings who live in time to
[1:03:00] always try to outrun God you want to do
[1:03:04] things out of season you want to help
[1:03:07] yourself Sarah would still have had a
[1:03:11] child
[1:03:12] anyway are you with me Brethren because
[1:03:16] sometimes if you don't make it
[1:03:17] illustrative people don't get it now
[1:03:19] Sarah will still have had that child you
[1:03:21] know why because God promised it and
[1:03:25] Heaven and Earth will pass away whatever
[1:03:28] God promises or say must come to pass
[1:03:32] even Christ himself said my we will not
[1:03:35] return to me
[1:03:37] void how many believe
[1:03:39] that so Sarah will have had that child I
[1:03:43] don't care how old she grew she would
[1:03:46] still have had that
[1:03:47] child and the scripture proved it that
[1:03:50] she will have had it because she had it
[1:03:53] when God yeah when God was ready to
[1:03:56] bring it to pass nature meant nothing to
[1:03:58] God I'm growing old I'm growing young
[1:04:01] I'm entering menopause those things
[1:04:03] meant nothing to God what go you know
[1:04:06] what means something to God is what he
[1:04:09] had said because behind every statement
[1:04:12] of God lies his
[1:04:14] reputation and there is nothing of demon
[1:04:17] not even Satan that can soil the
[1:04:20] reputation of
[1:04:24] God but you see here is the same
[1:04:28] sah who went to her husband she wanted
[1:04:32] to she wanted to help the program she
[1:04:35] said you know what get my maid maybe
[1:04:38] through her that is your own invention
[1:04:41] God does not need
[1:04:43] assistance God does not need any human
[1:04:46] support what he needs from you is Faith
[1:04:50] what he needs for you is to believe
[1:04:52] brother Braham said God expects that
[1:04:54] when he speaks his children just take it
[1:04:57] like
[1:04:57] that you know you tell a little child
[1:05:00] you say I'll buy you candies when I'm
[1:05:02] coming he will never doubt it he's just
[1:05:06] waiting for candies when he sees the car
[1:05:08] pull out it comes
[1:05:11] out without any provision for
[1:05:13] disappointment Dad where is my Candice
[1:05:17] because he believed you and that is the
[1:05:20] way you must believe God God where is
[1:05:24] your promise
[1:05:27] you can fail you told me and I'm holding
[1:05:32] onto it like a
[1:05:35] Lifeline but the prophet said anytime we
[1:05:38] try to help ourself it will
[1:05:43] backfire so when Sarah tried to help the
[1:05:46] project you all knew what
[1:05:48] happened eventually it backfired she
[1:05:52] even couldn't live with what she called
[1:05:54] her achievement
[1:05:56] because it was an achievement for her to
[1:05:58] get a child a child by the
[1:06:01] maid said maybe when I know the child it
[1:06:04] will condition me to have my own very
[1:06:06] good thought but that wasn't God's
[1:06:09] program amen because Sarah has had a
[1:06:13] definitive word of God on that matter
[1:06:16] once you hear God speak definite just
[1:06:20] hold on to that and don't ever look at
[1:06:23] yourself look con stantly at that word
[1:06:28] when every other thing fails that word
[1:06:30] will never fail that is why the prophet
[1:06:33] said we can hold on to his word as a
[1:06:39] Lifeline God bless
[1:06:42] you the
[1:06:46] Lord who created
[1:06:49] seasons for planting and
[1:06:52] harvesting is only trying to express his
[1:06:56] nature or his own desire the way he
[1:06:59] works by
[1:07:01] Nature I tell you that God can plant his
[1:07:05] seed
[1:07:06] today his seed of wheat today and
[1:07:09] harvest it the next
[1:07:11] second is that okay you don't believe
[1:07:14] that okay what do you think happened
[1:07:17] when after his convention there were
[1:07:20] 5,000 people who will have been stranded
[1:07:22] Because by the time they left the place
[1:07:25] McDonald's and the rest will have
[1:07:28] closed and they said the time is so
[1:07:31] late dismiss the audience but Christ was
[1:07:34] enjoying their Fellowship isn't it it's
[1:07:37] said don't worry let me finish the
[1:07:39] service when he finished the service
[1:07:40] they knew nobody will get
[1:07:43] food and he said make all the people to
[1:07:46] sit down and what do you have let's give
[1:07:48] them they said pastor is there is there
[1:07:51] something wrong we are talking of 5,000
[1:07:54] men besides women so the crowd could
[1:07:56] have been 10 or 12,000 if you had the
[1:08:00] children and you are saying what what
[1:08:02] could we have had to take care of all
[1:08:05] this he said let them sit down because
[1:08:08] God knew there was a little
[1:08:11] boy who will bring food because he
[1:08:13] inspired the mother because he knew what
[1:08:16] he wanted to do uhhuh uhhuh these things
[1:08:20] there's no coincidence in God's economy
[1:08:23] there's no chance event
[1:08:27] so when they brought the food see what
[1:08:30] happened the Bible said he blessed the
[1:08:33] food and he
[1:08:35] distributed to the disciples start
[1:08:37] serving so what do you think happened
[1:08:40] when they cut the
[1:08:43] bread it grew
[1:08:47] back when they caught it kept growing
[1:08:50] back until 5,000 men besides women and
[1:08:54] children
[1:08:56] were
[1:08:57] fed is that right now so what happened
[1:09:00] in the hand there was that whe was
[1:09:04] planted yes
[1:09:07] harvested processed into flow gone to
[1:09:12] Bakery baked as a
[1:09:15] brad amen all in one chance is there
[1:09:19] anything too hard for the Lord no
[1:09:22] impossibility in his
[1:09:24] economy so this God who can do
[1:09:27] this taught you that there should be
[1:09:30] planting
[1:09:32] season cultivating season and then
[1:09:36] harvest
[1:09:38] season and he likes you to follow the
[1:09:41] direction of
[1:09:42] seasons and in the way he did the
[1:09:45] calendar he did it in such a way that
[1:09:47] the son you know the eat of the Sun
[1:09:51] during planting is different from the
[1:09:53] one at Harvest yes
[1:09:55] because if you have the aest son during
[1:09:58] planting you are going to burn your seed
[1:09:59] in the ground so it makes it mild in
[1:10:03] planting and it makes it a little tough
[1:10:05] in Harvest so that he can promote
[1:10:08] ripening is to tell you that I have
[1:10:11] appointed season in which I do certain
[1:10:14] things and let me tell you it's only God
[1:10:17] that can act out of
[1:10:19] season because he's the creator of
[1:10:23] Seasons amen he can act out of season
[1:10:27] but he expects you in your followership
[1:10:29] of him to follow his appointed
[1:10:33] time anytime you take the matter upon
[1:10:36] yourself you are bound to
[1:10:38] fail so let us learn to wait upon God is
[1:10:42] that those who wait upon God shall renew
[1:10:45] their strength they shall M up with
[1:10:47] wings as an eagle they will run and not
[1:10:50] be weary and they will walk and never
[1:10:52] faint may the Lord teach you to wait
[1:10:54] upon him
[1:10:56] amen you love him this morning okay with
[1:10:59] that
[1:11:02] background let me tell you what inspired
[1:11:05] me for this
[1:11:07] subject the prophet of the Lord shared
[1:11:10] an experience of his own life with us
[1:11:14] amen now for our guest when I said the
[1:11:16] prophet of the lord we believe God sent
[1:11:18] us a messenger in this age amen but let
[1:11:21] me leave it at that so if by his
[1:11:24] experience your appetite is W you can
[1:11:26] ask for more and then we can we can stay
[1:11:29] whole day this is all I do in my life
[1:11:32] this is all I do amen 24 hours I'm ready
[1:11:35] praise God I love to talk about
[1:11:38] Jesus praise God so that's fine amen
[1:11:43] so he told
[1:11:45] us of an experience that the had you
[1:11:48] know with God through the event of a
[1:11:52] brother there's a brother called brother
[1:11:54] John hem
[1:11:57] he was somebody like you and I he
[1:12:00] believed the law the word he was
[1:12:03] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he
[1:12:05] started attending services at Braham
[1:12:09] Tabernacle but one thing led to the
[1:12:12] order it backs leaded on
[1:12:16] God don't ever leave your place of safe
[1:12:23] Retreat I know we backl every
[1:12:26] day yeah and the word says anytime we
[1:12:30] fail to do what we should do it's a
[1:12:32] Backle inness and we must repent every
[1:12:36] day that's what Paul said I Die
[1:12:39] daily are you with me Breen but you see
[1:12:43] no matter what happens to you you are
[1:12:45] still better off under the cover of the
[1:12:48] blood than outside
[1:12:51] there let nothing take you out of the
[1:12:54] range of the Lord I'm talking to
[1:12:57] somebody to you this morning if the
[1:12:59] devil is teaching you or trying to
[1:13:02] pressure you to walk out on the Lord
[1:13:06] amen you need what I'm
[1:13:10] saying whatever is happening to you that
[1:13:14] you are being frustrated about is
[1:13:17] happening in t to your people who are in
[1:13:19] the
[1:13:21] world and that's why there are suicides
[1:13:23] and all kind of things every day
[1:13:26] but you are still standing because you
[1:13:28] have a
[1:13:29] bumper something that is cushioning the
[1:13:32] effect for you until you lose it you
[1:13:34] won't appreciate its value so you are
[1:13:37] better off to stay under the blood than
[1:13:41] outside of the
[1:13:44] blood because when you walk out on God
[1:13:48] you are like a man leaving Jerusalem
[1:13:50] going to Jericho is a wrong
[1:13:53] direction every body should be ascending
[1:13:56] towards Jerusalem amen there you know
[1:14:00] when you are descend you to leave
[1:14:02] Jerusalem to go to Jericho is a
[1:14:04] dissension
[1:14:06] yes but to go from Jericho to Jerusalem
[1:14:09] is an Ascension I'm pressing on the
[1:14:12] upward Way new ID I'm ging every day
[1:14:15] still praying as I'm onward bound Lord
[1:14:17] plant my feet on IR
[1:14:20] ground that is the way it must be
[1:14:22] getting with us every day
[1:14:25] Hallelujah ascending into the heavenlies
[1:14:27] getting better each day but when you are
[1:14:30] descending you are
[1:14:32] backsliding you are coming from the
[1:14:34] heights that you should retain Believers
[1:14:37] don't live low they live in Heavenly
[1:14:39] places in Christ Jesus far above
[1:14:42] principalities and
[1:14:46] powers that was why because he was
[1:14:49] taking the wrong direction he met the
[1:14:51] wrong
[1:14:53] people the there is nothing for you when
[1:14:56] you backslide when you descend the road
[1:14:59] of Jerusalem you are going to meet
[1:15:01] thieves and
[1:15:02] robbers and they're going to deal with
[1:15:05] you amen you know why because you have
[1:15:08] isolated yourself from the protection of
[1:15:10] the
[1:15:11] blood are you getting it so nothing will
[1:15:14] be there to Bumper To shield and to
[1:15:18] protect you if you're on that road this
[1:15:20] morning you are the reason for this
[1:15:22] message please come back to Christ amen
[1:15:26] because you won't you won't meet angels
[1:15:28] in that direction if you ever met them
[1:15:31] is to tell you to go
[1:15:33] back and if you refuse their warning you
[1:15:36] are going to get robbers and thieves who
[1:15:39] are going to deal with you so badly
[1:15:42] wound you so heavily and M you
[1:15:46] terribly until they will leave you half
[1:15:49] dead which the prophet said physically
[1:15:51] alive but spiritually dead amen
[1:15:56] yes that was the experience of this
[1:15:59] brother John
[1:16:00] Hil when he went out on God he suddenly
[1:16:04] found himself
[1:16:06] fighting you know when you take a coal
[1:16:10] of fire from a bunch of coals of fire
[1:16:15] the day you isolated from that Bunch you
[1:16:17] killed it yes but the death will not
[1:16:20] immediately
[1:16:22] manifest because it takes the collection
[1:16:25] of the Cs so to sustain each other's
[1:16:27] Fire by the time you take one out it
[1:16:30] will still be burning for a while but
[1:16:33] you see it's gradually
[1:16:35] extinguishing the light is the spark is
[1:16:38] not getting higher it's getting
[1:16:41] lower until it will die so when em left
[1:16:46] God it didn't you know look like a bad
[1:16:49] man
[1:16:50] immediately but gradually he found
[1:16:53] himself fighting
[1:16:55] isn't that bad then he found himself
[1:16:58] committed mother in the process of
[1:17:00] fighting he killed the person and in
[1:17:03] killing the person he was jailed he
[1:17:05] became a prisoner and he served time for
[1:17:08] many years and in the process his first
[1:17:11] born
[1:17:13] died everything was just falling like a
[1:17:16] pack of cards on brother
[1:17:18] John then he came out trying to pack the
[1:17:21] beats and pieces of his
[1:17:23] life is surviving son the only son left
[1:17:27] because he's got two children also took
[1:17:29] ill and was going to die then brother
[1:17:33] John said I must do something about my
[1:17:36] life and I thank God for him he ran to
[1:17:38] the right place now for you to know that
[1:17:41] that was the Finger of
[1:17:44] God the prophet said when jario daughter
[1:17:48] took very heill and nobody could help
[1:17:52] that girl he said it was God's f finger
[1:17:55] to make jarot to reveal who truly he is
[1:17:59] because he has been a secret
[1:18:02] believer and God wanted him to testify
[1:18:05] about Christ openly
[1:18:08] am he wants him to openly
[1:18:11] identify so sometimes the challenges of
[1:18:14] our life they are not to destroy us they
[1:18:16] are not even to decimate us it is to do
[1:18:19] what is to cultivate a
[1:18:22] virtue are you with me
[1:18:25] and let me tell you God will get you
[1:18:27] except you are not a seed of God if you
[1:18:31] are a seed of God there's no much to
[1:18:33] worry about if I could confirm that that
[1:18:35] fellow is a seed of God I don't care
[1:18:37] what he's doing let him be in the brutal
[1:18:40] it doesn't matter to me let him be
[1:18:42] drinking himself to stup or even on
[1:18:45] drugs it doesn't matter to me I know at
[1:18:47] God's appointed time amen God will do
[1:18:51] something amen amen some will take make
[1:18:54] it easy God will give easy appoint
[1:18:57] invitation but if they don't mind God
[1:19:00] because God cannot lose anyone for whom
[1:19:03] he has given Thanksgiving by the way do
[1:19:06] you realize that he gave Thanksgiving on
[1:19:09] all of you that are here he said father
[1:19:11] I thank you for all that you gave unto
[1:19:13] me I lose none John chapter 10 except
[1:19:17] the son of pedition that he might go to
[1:19:20] his own place God couldn't have offered
[1:19:22] Thanksgiving about you and withdraw it
[1:19:24] back it's
[1:19:27] impossible so he will do all he could
[1:19:30] and all he should to bring you
[1:19:32] home Hallelujah if you accept his easy
[1:19:35] Pro soft proposal he makes it soft for
[1:19:38] you if you want hard proposal it's going
[1:19:40] to make it hard for you but guess what
[1:19:43] God will have his
[1:19:46] way in your life and in my life he will
[1:19:50] have his
[1:19:51] way so this morning prepare to meet you
[1:19:54] your
[1:19:55] Lord are you enjoying the Lord praise
[1:19:59] God
[1:20:00] Amen all right so for you to know it was
[1:20:05] all God's finger on John Emil's
[1:20:08] son before John Emil rose up because he
[1:20:12] thought what must I do now let me go and
[1:20:15] look for my pastor that's brother Braham
[1:20:19] and go back to him to see if you could
[1:20:21] come and pray for my son so that they
[1:20:24] will be relieved
[1:20:25] but before he got to the prophet God had
[1:20:28] given the prophet a vision of the same
[1:20:31] John
[1:20:33] H a man who had long
[1:20:36] backed for you to see how much God was
[1:20:39] mindful of that brother he gave the
[1:20:42] prophet a vision about him that this is
[1:20:45] the condition of this boy this is the
[1:20:48] condition of this man his son and this
[1:20:50] is what I'm going to do so God took the
[1:20:53] prophet practic Ally to the house of
[1:20:55] John he saw everything and he even saw
[1:20:58] the healing of the boy so by the time
[1:21:00] the prophet was coming out of the vision
[1:21:03] he was hearing a knock at his door and
[1:21:06] guess who came in the same man he saw in
[1:21:08] the
[1:21:09] vision then he told him he said don't
[1:21:12] worry brother
[1:21:14] John your son will be all right so in
[1:21:17] that Vision brother Emil had seen his
[1:21:20] cousin who is uh brother Graham Snelling
[1:21:23] in the vision no no no brother Braham
[1:21:25] had seen that cousin but you see it has
[1:21:28] to be God arranging the picture by
[1:21:30] himself so suddenly John Emil said okay
[1:21:33] before we go the prophet said I'll go
[1:21:36] with you he said but before we go while
[1:21:37] you are preparing let me go get my
[1:21:39] cousin gram Snelling because in that
[1:21:42] Vision Graham Snelling was there all
[1:21:45] right so he went to get Graham Snelling
[1:21:47] and they were all they started on the
[1:21:49] journey and as they were going the
[1:21:52] prophet said in your heart do you have a
[1:21:55] d fold chair whatever that means a blue
[1:21:58] color he said yes it's there in my house
[1:22:02] he mentioned certain things yes is there
[1:22:04] he said this little boy we're going to
[1:22:06] pray for does he have a pair of codron
[1:22:08] jeans he said he's wearing it right now
[1:22:11] then all of a sudden he felt Jed said
[1:22:13] have you been to my house before and the
[1:22:15] prophet said yes I've been to your house
[1:22:18] before but not in the form you
[1:22:22] taught then he told him is brother John
[1:22:25] if you say you were a church member here
[1:22:27] before before sin took you out you must
[1:22:30] have had me spoke of Visions Andor he
[1:22:33] the Lord he said you see whoever is
[1:22:36] telling me those things has never failed
[1:22:38] for once that same person came back to
[1:22:41] tell me before you came he showed me the
[1:22:44] healing of your son he said John your
[1:22:46] son is going to be all right oh then
[1:22:49] John broke down he quickly pked the car
[1:22:53] he wept like a baby to see how much God
[1:22:55] could be so mindful of him even in his
[1:22:58] low condition and brother Braham said
[1:23:01] ride on that road we restore John back
[1:23:03] to the
[1:23:06] Lord so in the excitement and the joy of
[1:23:11] seeing a child of God came back
[1:23:15] home you know the Bible said Heaven
[1:23:18] rejoice when his sinner returns amen the
[1:23:21] hell Satan count his losses but God
[1:23:24] count His blessings and we will also be
[1:23:27] happy with you this morning if you can
[1:23:30] make your way to Christ the world has
[1:23:32] got nothing to offer you but you've got
[1:23:35] every blessing in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:38] you say what kind of blessing until you
[1:23:40] come you won't appreciate it come in
[1:23:44] first glory to
[1:23:46] God if I was eating an apple and I tell
[1:23:49] you so
[1:23:50] sweet you may believe me but you say how
[1:23:53] do I know he sweet
[1:23:55] I say you need to eat a portion to
[1:23:56] appreciate it isn't it so come eat a
[1:23:59] portion this morning Jesus is so sweet
[1:24:02] I've been preaching him for 35 years
[1:24:04] it's getting sweeter every day amen you
[1:24:08] say how do I know it's sweet come tast
[1:24:10] it with come tasting with me and your
[1:24:13] life will never be the same again he
[1:24:15] said is no secret what he can do what he
[1:24:18] did for one he can do for the other keep
[1:24:20] your hands wide open and accept him this
[1:24:23] morning John Emil came to Christ right
[1:24:27] there and everybody get excited and
[1:24:30] happy and as soon as they got home in
[1:24:33] that excitement the prophet never
[1:24:36] waited for the vision to come in
[1:24:40] order okay he just asked for the baby he
[1:24:43] said bring me the baby now because he
[1:24:45] saw him healed in the vision and he
[1:24:47] carried the baby and he prayed for him
[1:24:50] and instead of the baby getting better
[1:24:52] he got worse
[1:24:56] the vision is for an appointed
[1:24:59] time it got so
[1:25:02] worse until he was almost lifeless and
[1:25:07] they had to put him back on the floor or
[1:25:09] somewhere
[1:25:11] there you can imagine what that would
[1:25:14] mean to somebody who is been looked up
[1:25:17] to to come and offer help and instead of
[1:25:21] offering help he offered more damage
[1:25:27] I can imagine how what a tension it
[1:25:28] should be for the prophet at that time
[1:25:31] and you see in retrospect we could
[1:25:34] easily relate with the problem why the
[1:25:36] reason but he didn't even know
[1:25:40] immediately he was just there what could
[1:25:42] have gone wrong what could have gone
[1:25:44] wrong what could have gone wrong what
[1:25:47] could have gone wrong he never had that
[1:25:50] answer until almost 24 hours
[1:25:55] the prophet did a full day A W day I
[1:25:58] think in the afternoon or so it he
[1:26:01] didn't leave the place throughout the
[1:26:03] night till the day
[1:26:07] break because he just didn't know what
[1:26:10] to do he didn't know what went wrong but
[1:26:14] what went wrong was the fact that he
[1:26:16] never waited on God for the pieces of
[1:26:20] the vision to come
[1:26:22] together that is what you life is all
[1:26:24] about when God conceived you in his
[1:26:27] thought he got
[1:26:29] pieces of the puus that must come
[1:26:31] together for you to get to certain
[1:26:35] mileage amen so God has to be patient
[1:26:39] with his own Vision about you but most
[1:26:41] times you don't appreciate that you
[1:26:43] start jumping here and there H the Bible
[1:26:46] said there are many devices in the heart
[1:26:49] of a man I think I spoke on that the
[1:26:50] last time it's but the counsel of the
[1:26:53] Lord is what with
[1:26:57] stand so I'm giving you this to give you
[1:27:01] peace and to make you settle
[1:27:04] relax because nothing can be out of ker
[1:27:07] oh what peace you hav
[1:27:11] forfeit oh what needless pain you
[1:27:15] bear rest little bright all is
[1:27:20] well if you've got Christ on the boat
[1:27:23] what would make you ever to imagine that
[1:27:26] the boat can be sunk It's
[1:27:29] Impossible the disciples were borning
[1:27:32] energies and they were expecting Christ
[1:27:34] to appreciate them when the boat was
[1:27:36] about to be sung you know they were
[1:27:38] sweing thinking that they want to save
[1:27:40] Jesus who can save Jesus and Jesus my
[1:27:43] Lord was in the boat
[1:27:45] sleeping forgive me probably
[1:27:49] snoring and just having a good time
[1:27:52] sleeping and he never bought about the
[1:27:55] storm when they got tired of their
[1:27:58] effort they asked to go wake Jesus all
[1:28:00] you need is Wake
[1:28:03] Jesus is said master car not that we
[1:28:06] perish that is that is a most
[1:28:09] uncomplimentary statement you have Jesus
[1:28:12] in the both and you are making provision
[1:28:14] for Destruction is that possible and you
[1:28:17] expect Christ to get up and say and and
[1:28:19] commend them for their effort he never
[1:28:21] did read your
[1:28:23] Bible rather he rebuke them he said you
[1:28:26] of little faith you are insulting me
[1:28:30] that my presence is not capable to
[1:28:32] protect you I'm right here in this boat
[1:28:35] and you are Imagining the boat could
[1:28:37] capsize that's an insult to the presence
[1:28:40] of
[1:28:42] God he still an insult you
[1:28:45] today that's why the prophet said all I
[1:28:47] labor is to do is to bring you to the
[1:28:50] recognition of the presence of God in
[1:28:52] our midst when when you recognize his
[1:28:55] presence there are some things you know
[1:28:57] you just key into that presence and you
[1:28:59] start receiving things that's right oh
[1:29:02] my I pray God will reveal it to his
[1:29:08] church he got up and he said peace be
[1:29:12] still hey then the people said what
[1:29:14] manner of man is this that even the
[1:29:17] storm even the waves obeyed his voice
[1:29:20] that's the kind of God I serve and
[1:29:23] that's the kind of God you have you've
[1:29:26] got to be conscious of that in any
[1:29:28] situation that with Christ nothing can
[1:29:31] get out of
[1:29:36] C you love
[1:29:40] him so here was the
[1:29:45] prophet couldn't make it out why dis us
[1:29:48] to
[1:29:49] be then everybody was helpless I I want
[1:29:54] to believe that there was no sleep in
[1:29:55] that night because everybody must
[1:29:58] fashion out what is the next
[1:30:01] step as far as they are concerned John
[1:30:04] help me believe that his only Last Hope
[1:30:06] rest in this man's prayer and this man's
[1:30:09] prayer hasn't relieved anything but
[1:30:11] created more
[1:30:15] problems then the grace of God came on
[1:30:18] the prophet and said you know what
[1:30:21] happened you went ahead of the vision
[1:30:25] the vision is for an appointed
[1:30:28] time it said in that Vision you saw an
[1:30:32] old
[1:30:34] woman who was part of the
[1:30:38] scene where is the woman brother brah
[1:30:41] said that is true that is true the old
[1:30:44] woman is not here and he can go and
[1:30:46] bring any old
[1:30:49] woman did you get it you can't work it
[1:30:51] out you can't arrange it God has God who
[1:30:54] gave it as to arrange the puzzle by
[1:30:57] himself the prophet said if I see a v in
[1:31:00] the vision this Anker Chief handkerchief
[1:31:04] on the pulpit standing here for instance
[1:31:06] he said if in reality he still standing
[1:31:09] here I cannot do anything and I cannot
[1:31:12] take the handkerchief myself except I
[1:31:15] was the one in the vision who took it if
[1:31:17] I was not the one I must wait for the
[1:31:20] handkerchief to move from here to here
[1:31:24] amen that is how detailed God is in
[1:31:28] bringing his word to
[1:31:30] pass all I'm saying be taken it as a
[1:31:34] story of your own life this is the
[1:31:37] answer to he said why this why that why
[1:31:39] this it all the puzzles that God is
[1:31:43] arranging allow God the right of way
[1:31:48] amen you know
[1:31:51] so it said the whole woman is not there
[1:31:53] yet he said ah Lord I'm sorry he said
[1:31:55] not only that he said the mother of the
[1:31:58] baby ought to be leaning by the do poost
[1:32:02] of the door
[1:32:05] weeping said she's not
[1:32:07] there then gram snailing your cousin
[1:32:11] ought the cousin of johnil ought to be
[1:32:13] sitting where you brother Braham is now
[1:32:16] sitting and he cannot invite him come
[1:32:18] and
[1:32:19] sit because it was God who arranged
[1:32:22] everything by himself so what he needed
[1:32:25] was patient to wait for God based on his
[1:32:28] own timing God didn't give him the
[1:32:30] number of hours he going to take but he
[1:32:33] couldn't have Minister any blessing
[1:32:35] until he sees the picture
[1:32:39] perfect so he said oh oh I missed it
[1:32:44] completely I was too excited I saw John
[1:32:47] came back to Christ I was too excited
[1:32:50] God said no problem now this o thing ran
[1:32:53] from the afternoon or so till the next
[1:32:56] day MH when morning
[1:33:00] Came John brother Graham Snelling was to
[1:33:03] go back to work was to go and resume
[1:33:05] work John was going to carry him hey
[1:33:08] brother Braham said God have mercy upon
[1:33:10] me if these two people leave that means
[1:33:13] I cannot leave here until they returned
[1:33:16] because in the vision they were
[1:33:19] there but he couldn't tell them please
[1:33:21] don't go are you say it he couldn't said
[1:33:26] you don't you shouldn't go there's
[1:33:27] something I'm working out no sir he is
[1:33:29] not the one to work it out you are not
[1:33:31] the one to work it out you are only to
[1:33:34] take the program
[1:33:37] yes so he said in my heart was saying
[1:33:40] Lord have mercy I've done a night and a
[1:33:43] day if these people leave I will be here
[1:33:45] another full day until they
[1:33:48] return then so they dressed up they were
[1:33:52] ready to go and asked brother Braham
[1:33:54] would you want us to drop you at home h
[1:33:56] brother Braham said no I can go for now
[1:33:59] I can go I have to be here he said okay
[1:34:01] I'll go drop brother Graham and come
[1:34:04] back to you so they actually stepped out
[1:34:07] and they actually got into the
[1:34:10] car then the old
[1:34:13] woman that is saw in the vision came
[1:34:16] from the behind through the
[1:34:18] kitchen she turned out to be the
[1:34:21] grandmother for that baby and and she
[1:34:24] ask her daughter how is the boy and the
[1:34:27] lady said mama she is no good and the
[1:34:32] whole woman started crying and the
[1:34:34] mother of the baby started crying it was
[1:34:36] their cry that attracted the attention
[1:34:39] of John and Graham and they asked to
[1:34:42] come out of the car and came back
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:46] inside you see how God is arranging his
[1:34:49] things so they now had to come and
[1:34:52] console the two women and as they were
[1:34:54] consoling the two women after they felt
[1:34:57] a bit relieved there was an apron That
[1:34:59] was supposed to be on the wall cabinet
[1:35:02] the old woman just went for the apron
[1:35:04] where it was and put it on the wall
[1:35:06] cabinet brother brah said thank God he
[1:35:09] coming
[1:35:11] [Music]
[1:35:12] Hallelujah the picture is coming back
[1:35:15] and uh the prophet said I got up from
[1:35:18] where I was sitting knowing Graham
[1:35:19] should be sitting there so I got up I
[1:35:22] was walking around and uh John and
[1:35:25] Graham looked at themselves they
[1:35:26] realized that the atmosphere is not
[1:35:28] right for them to leave so Graham went
[1:35:31] and sat exactly where the Prophet saw
[1:35:34] him the prophet said Thank God he's
[1:35:36] coming
[1:35:38] amen then the old woman after her crying
[1:35:41] she went and sat on the sofa the prophet
[1:35:43] said Thank God is coming and he said in
[1:35:46] his that if this lady could just go to
[1:35:48] where I saw her that's the mother of the
[1:35:50] baby and you know he can tell her you
[1:35:52] know you go you go save my time and he
[1:35:55] was there waiting and after a while the
[1:35:58] lady just walked towards that door
[1:36:00] leaned on the door post and she was
[1:36:03] weeping that was the picture perfect
[1:36:06] then brother Bram got up Hallelujah he
[1:36:09] said brother John do you still have
[1:36:12] confidence in
[1:36:13] me Hey Brother John said by every means
[1:36:17] I have confidence in you Pastor he said
[1:36:20] some of you your confidence that's a
[1:36:22] lesson your confidence is so cheap so it
[1:36:26] is easily lost yeah if you have
[1:36:29] something of value you don't lose it any
[1:36:32] any little conversation I lost
[1:36:34] confidence in you what's wrong with
[1:36:37] you here is a man who could really have
[1:36:39] done it but no brother Braham said if
[1:36:44] you truly have confidence in me lift up
[1:36:47] that boy carry him and bring him here
[1:36:50] and the prophet said you will not
[1:36:52] understand what that meant
[1:36:54] because the ponia had create some
[1:36:57] H meaning the boy is already bleeding
[1:37:00] internally so if care is not taken the
[1:37:03] way you carry him may make him bled to
[1:37:05] death but John said I will do anything
[1:37:09] you tell me he went for his boy and
[1:37:12] carried and give it to the prophet then
[1:37:14] brother Braham said you know why this
[1:37:16] boy did not heal it was because I'm the
[1:37:19] problem I went ahead of the vision he
[1:37:22] said but now everything I saw it's in
[1:37:25] its place so there will be no reason for
[1:37:27] this boy not to be all right and in less
[1:37:30] than two minutes of prayer the boy
[1:37:32] jumped out of the hands of the Prophet
[1:37:34] amen perfectly whole amen am the vision
[1:37:39] is for an appointed time so brother
[1:37:42] Braham said in the vision I saw the boy
[1:37:45] made three twists meaning it will be
[1:37:48] three days that he will be perfectly
[1:37:51] fully recovered he said said and on that
[1:37:54] third day I'm going to come back here
[1:37:56] and watch if that boy he said that boy
[1:37:59] when I come back wherever that boy is
[1:38:01] playing he will get up with milk
[1:38:05] mustache amen covering his lips amen and
[1:38:09] walk up to me and hel out hold out his
[1:38:13] hand and shake me and said brother
[1:38:14] Braham I am perfectly well now the
[1:38:17] prophet said if that does not happen
[1:38:19] like that call me a false prophet amen
[1:38:23] amen amen and thankfully it turned out
[1:38:27] to be a Wednesday this was Sunday this
[1:38:29] was Wednesday all right amen and uh on
[1:38:33] Wednesday when he announced that a lot
[1:38:35] of people said we want to follow to go
[1:38:37] and see what
[1:38:38] happened so these Breen jumped in their
[1:38:41] cars and they were going they were going
[1:38:43] they were they got to the house I'm sure
[1:38:45] some were nervous what if it did not
[1:38:48] happen and brother Braham who knows that
[1:38:50] do see the Lord can never fail
[1:38:53] he walked boldly towards the door where
[1:38:57] they have an inscription God bless our
[1:38:59] home he knocked at the door and the
[1:39:01] mother of the baby opened the door as
[1:39:05] the prophet stepped in the Breen were
[1:39:07] watching from the window to see what was
[1:39:09] going to happen as the prophet stepped
[1:39:11] in the boy by the power of that prophecy
[1:39:14] turned from where he was playing with
[1:39:17] little neighbor's children and got up
[1:39:19] with milk mustache amen and they walked
[1:39:23] to the prophet and he said exactly the
[1:39:25] same word does say the Lord can never
[1:39:29] fail the vision is for an appointed
[1:39:34] time though itar amen wait for it amen
[1:39:39] in heaven nothing ties in heaven
[1:39:42] everything happened according to plan
[1:39:46] amen Lazarus was not meant to just be
[1:39:49] sick he was meant to die amen
[1:39:53] he wasn't just meant to die he was meant
[1:39:56] to be
[1:39:57] corrupting sometimes you don't see God
[1:39:59] on the scene until it becomes a
[1:40:02] perfectly hopeless case amen and some
[1:40:05] those things are not because maybe you
[1:40:07] are a wor sinner or anything amen God is
[1:40:10] only building trust and confidence amen
[1:40:13] are you with me he allowed Daniel to get
[1:40:16] into the lion's den it could have
[1:40:18] prevented him entering amen but is said
[1:40:20] getting there and let's give the devil a
[1:40:24] run for his money or for his power and
[1:40:26] Daniel got in there and instead of the
[1:40:29] lions attacking him a millennium started
[1:40:32] there God allows certain things so that
[1:40:34] the story can be written like that in a
[1:40:37] manner that you produce a testimony and
[1:40:40] virtue for somebody else to tap into he
[1:40:43] allowed the three Brew children to get
[1:40:45] into the fire and became number four man
[1:40:47] amen and he didn't hide his identity
[1:40:50] when Nebuchadnezzar came he introduced
[1:40:52] himself
[1:40:53] I am the I am the Son of God I am the
[1:40:56] number four man in here I identify with
[1:40:59] my home people through th in anywhere
[1:41:03] even Nebuchadnezzar despite his adolat
[1:41:05] Tendencies could recognize that the
[1:41:07] appearance of that number four looks
[1:41:10] like the Son of God everybody ought to
[1:41:11] know who our Lord
[1:41:15] is so it could allowed you to get to the
[1:41:18] dead end amen amen Israel got to a dead
[1:41:23] end
[1:41:25] isn't it the sea before them looking
[1:41:28] back it was Pharaoh and on either side
[1:41:31] Hills and Valleys so there's no option
[1:41:34] they were in a closeup amen and God
[1:41:37] could get you into that Dead Hand
[1:41:39] sometimes just to show his power if you
[1:41:42] have tasted salvation you must taste the
[1:41:45] power of God it's all the blessings of
[1:41:49] redemption only believe all things are
[1:41:53] possible POS my
[1:41:55] friend
[1:41:57] Hallelujah all right do you still have
[1:41:59] few more times to go okay we can
[1:42:02] continue a little while okay
[1:42:06] now you look at
[1:42:12] Joseph God gave a vision to
[1:42:16] Joseph now in Joseph you will see
[1:42:20] that there are things God chooses to
[1:42:24] reveal and there are things he keeps to
[1:42:27] himself so your journey with God must
[1:42:30] always be a journey of
[1:42:33] trust when you come to a point in your
[1:42:36] life that you realize that whatever no
[1:42:38] matter what happens God cannot be wrong
[1:42:41] then you are coming to
[1:42:43] Christianity right are you with me the
[1:42:47] cstone Revelation you must have above
[1:42:49] every revelation of mystery is to know
[1:42:52] that God cannot not be
[1:42:54] wrong there are many things you will not
[1:42:57] be able to
[1:42:58] understand and God himself will put you
[1:43:01] on the spot to make your ability to
[1:43:04] defend him impossible underline it in
[1:43:06] your
[1:43:08] mind what would you have thought how
[1:43:10] what answers will Mary and Mata have
[1:43:12] given to critics when you know the Bible
[1:43:16] said when they wrote to Jesus to invite
[1:43:21] him home to pray for Lazarus they wrote
[1:43:24] an intimate letter Lazarus your friend
[1:43:28] whom thou
[1:43:30] love is
[1:43:34] sick but despite all the qualification
[1:43:37] of the relationship did it affect Jesus
[1:43:40] to come no Jesus never came now to a
[1:43:43] natural eye would that not look like a
[1:43:45] callous insensitive
[1:43:47] position it will give a good Revival to
[1:43:50] those who are critics of Jesus
[1:43:53] say look at the men they give their all
[1:43:56] to and according to
[1:43:59] history the cloth of Many Colors the
[1:44:02] clothes that was woven without SE that
[1:44:05] the soldiers were parting among
[1:44:07] themselves on the cross was actually
[1:44:09] given to Christ by that
[1:44:12] family when they accepted Christ they
[1:44:16] defied all the denominations the
[1:44:18] structure of religion in that
[1:44:20] day they damed all of them and kill to
[1:44:23] Christ they housed Christ they fed
[1:44:27] Christ they give Christ cloth this is
[1:44:30] all you can do for a servant of God or
[1:44:33] for the things of God so they met all
[1:44:36] requirement for Christ to be there for
[1:44:38] them in their hour of need but the more
[1:44:42] they called Christ the father he
[1:44:47] went you didn't C he was in I when David
[1:44:51] when uh yeah because we've dream driven
[1:44:53] to AA before I said brother brother one
[1:44:56] he drove going I drove coming or I drove
[1:45:00] going he drove coming about three less
[1:45:02] than four hours strip that was some
[1:45:04] years ago all right so AA is quite close
[1:45:07] isn't it when Lazarus was sick Christ
[1:45:11] was in
[1:45:13] IA by the time his condition was worse
[1:45:16] they called him to come instead of
[1:45:18] coming he moved to the his
[1:45:20] coast and you know New York in Atlanta
[1:45:23] they are major hubs so he just got on an
[1:45:26] international flight and boom he was in
[1:45:29] Africa he was so far away that by the
[1:45:32] time Lazarus died he was too far away to
[1:45:35] even come in time for
[1:45:37] burier and you will call that a pastor
[1:45:40] to
[1:45:43] Lazarus so if the critics brother Steve
[1:45:46] if the critics were asking Mary and Mata
[1:45:49] about Christ how do you think they will
[1:45:51] defend him if acted in a manner that
[1:45:54] defending him became a
[1:45:57] burden but that is how my lord
[1:46:00] does are you with me that is how my lord
[1:46:04] does to prove
[1:46:09] you if you think that in itself can Dent
[1:46:12] his reputation you on a long
[1:46:15] thing because he knows what he's doing
[1:46:19] do you know the Lord said deliberately I
[1:46:21] was not there
[1:46:24] when they announced to him that he was
[1:46:26] dead he said I am glad for your sakes I
[1:46:28] was not there so meaning his action was
[1:46:31] deliberate was intentional it wasn't an
[1:46:34] accidental or something he was helpless
[1:46:37] about he did it like
[1:46:39] that okay if I was there the day he died
[1:46:42] they would say he actually wasn't
[1:46:45] sick right if I healed him when he was
[1:46:48] sick they would say he wasn't sick they
[1:46:50] only pretended so that they can you know
[1:46:52] rais my profile before the people if he
[1:46:56] died and he raised him up they would say
[1:46:57] he actually fainted he didn't really die
[1:47:01] so he left everything it was before them
[1:47:04] he got sick they saw him when he died
[1:47:06] actually they conducted the funeral and
[1:47:08] buried
[1:47:09] him so there's no controversy to the
[1:47:12] fact that the man was dead and
[1:47:14] scientifically after 72 hours corruption
[1:47:17] set in so for one full day corruption
[1:47:21] was working on Lazarus then Jesus
[1:47:24] came now when he came was he
[1:47:27] late amen came forth this later but it
[1:47:31] was still on
[1:47:32] time he changed the narrative by his
[1:47:36] coming and he's still the same God he
[1:47:39] will change your life's narrative when
[1:47:41] he appears only believe all things are
[1:47:45] possible don't take the matter into no
[1:47:49] no no no leave it let go and let go
[1:47:53] there is not no matter how complex your
[1:47:55] matter is is not outside of God's
[1:47:57] jurisdiction to
[1:48:01] handle you love
[1:48:03] him so here we have Brother Joseph a
[1:48:06] very spiritual brother in the
[1:48:08] church and the
[1:48:10] Lord has the purpose for Joseph's life
[1:48:15] amen now he gave him a
[1:48:19] vision and Joseph was somebody who is
[1:48:21] very expressive
[1:48:24] he came to church Brethren the Lord has
[1:48:26] just blessed me with a vision I don't
[1:48:27] know what it means but I saw something I
[1:48:31] saw me and my brothers we gathered our
[1:48:34] shav and uh after we maned them the
[1:48:39] sheaves of my brothers all these my
[1:48:41] brothers fell down to my own shav in the
[1:48:45] church that day brother said keep quiet
[1:48:48] what kind of a testimony are you
[1:48:51] giving you will expect Joseph to be
[1:48:54] courtious the next service another
[1:48:56] Vision had come he said Breen I have
[1:48:58] another
[1:48:59] testimony this time around 12 Stars sun
[1:49:02] and moon so mother and father
[1:49:05] included and all the 11 stars and sun
[1:49:08] and moon bow to my one star I said this
[1:49:11] boy now I'm saying that in Joseph's life
[1:49:15] we will see the revealed will of God and
[1:49:18] the secret
[1:49:21] Wills sometimes it shows you your
[1:49:23] destination but it never tells you how
[1:49:25] you will get
[1:49:27] there if he told Joseph how he's going
[1:49:29] to get there he wouldn't want he will
[1:49:32] want to frustrate the Fulfillment of
[1:49:34] that
[1:49:35] Vision but you see whatsoever the Lord
[1:49:38] has done it shall be forever nobody can
[1:49:41] have nobody can take away you must just
[1:49:44] accept it let's join in his life a
[1:49:46] little to see the nature of God in
[1:49:48] another
[1:49:49] way now what was the reason
[1:49:53] Moses said the secret things belong to
[1:49:55] God right he said but those things that
[1:49:57] are revealed are for her now what was
[1:50:01] the reason that God was giving Joseph
[1:50:03] such a
[1:50:05] vision if they were spiritual Brethren
[1:50:08] they will realize that what God was
[1:50:10] doing was to
[1:50:12] announce the reassignment of
[1:50:16] Birthright follow me
[1:50:18] now
[1:50:21] right I I think it was in Genesis uh was
[1:50:25] it 27 or 28 somewhere there Reuben who
[1:50:30] was the first born in that family who
[1:50:33] has the right to three blessings yes by
[1:50:36] being the first born he has the right to
[1:50:39] the birth right to rulership the
[1:50:42] leadership of the entire them and also
[1:50:46] to the
[1:50:47] priesthood the first Bor takes the
[1:50:51] three but because Reuben committed
[1:50:56] fornication that is why Apostle Paul won
[1:50:59] the church and is will still stand as a
[1:51:01] great warning today do not be a
[1:51:05] fornicator amen you don't want to say
[1:51:07] Amen to that all right okay suit
[1:51:11] yourself am amen but I we preach the
[1:51:15] word amen praise God hallelujah amen do
[1:51:18] not be a profane person amen or a
[1:51:21] fornicator there were two Birthright
[1:51:24] losers in the
[1:51:26] Bible Esau Reuben Esau wasn't the
[1:51:31] fornicator but he was a profane person
[1:51:34] profanity means taking Divine
[1:51:36] instructions
[1:51:38] lightly
[1:51:40] yeah when he sees the word the DeMent
[1:51:43] the instruction of the word he can say
[1:51:45] maybe God does not really mean it like
[1:51:47] that some of us are like
[1:51:49] that and that is why it's so easy for us
[1:51:52] to be rationalizing our action we never
[1:51:55] repent
[1:51:57] amen you will lose your inheritance like
[1:52:00] Saul did
[1:52:04] amen but Reuben was a
[1:52:07] fornicator he discovered his father's
[1:52:10] bed and the Bible said Jacob heard it
[1:52:13] but he never talked he kept it until the
[1:52:17] day that he was to
[1:52:19] leave and as a father he must pronounce
[1:52:22] blessing on
[1:52:24] Hall that was the day Reuben knew his
[1:52:27] father
[1:52:29] knew he say you are the beginning of my
[1:52:32] strength Excellency in dignity but as
[1:52:35] unstable as the waters are you will not
[1:52:38] Excel because you went to your father's
[1:52:41] bed is there in the
[1:52:44] Bible sin cost you amen and takes you
[1:52:49] further than you are prepared to go the
[1:52:52] way of of a transgressor is always very
[1:52:55] bad amen Sean sing this morning amen
[1:53:00] amen repent come to Christ is God the
[1:53:05] power to save from sin no man can
[1:53:09] deliver e or herself but all God needs
[1:53:12] from you is Readiness and willingness
[1:53:15] when he sees that desire he will come
[1:53:17] through for you amen you love him this
[1:53:19] morning
[1:53:20] amen now when Reuben did what he did God
[1:53:25] decided to take all the three blessings
[1:53:27] from
[1:53:28] him if I have time I will show you the
[1:53:31] scriptures take note either first or 2
[1:53:33] Chronicles chapter 5 you will see it
[1:53:35] there he took the priesthood and gave it
[1:53:39] to the Levi gave it to Levi he took
[1:53:42] their rulership and gave it to Judah
[1:53:45] that was why Christ came from the tribe
[1:53:47] of Judah
[1:53:48] amen as the coming King
[1:53:52] are you with me then he took the birth
[1:53:55] right and gave it to Joseph meaning
[1:53:58] Joseph will be the soer and the provider
[1:54:02] and the protector of the entire family
[1:54:04] amen that's what Birthright means amen
[1:54:07] he will be the one to distribute all the
[1:54:09] assets of the
[1:54:10] father amen and yet he wasn't near the
[1:54:14] first born he was number 11 yes amen so
[1:54:18] when all these people were bowing to
[1:54:21] Joseph in the
[1:54:23] it was God's way announcing the
[1:54:25] reassignment of Birthright you see how
[1:54:27] do I know when you go back to the
[1:54:29] scripture and read the blessings of
[1:54:32] Birthright that Isaac pronounced on
[1:54:34] Jacob take note of these things go read
[1:54:36] them they will help you the world reads
[1:54:39] stories in the Bible we read
[1:54:41] life yeah so if you go read there one of
[1:54:47] the Articles of prayer was that let your
[1:54:50] brethren the children of your parents
[1:54:53] bow to you amen be thou their sorer be
[1:54:56] thou their provider amen is there Isaac
[1:54:59] said it
[1:55:00] am so the vision of Joseph is in line
[1:55:04] with the prayer of
[1:55:06] Isaac so he has a scriptural Vision but
[1:55:09] those Brethren were not spiritual enough
[1:55:12] to understand that this was what God was
[1:55:16] doing amen so they decided to do what to
[1:55:20] attack the vision it's it's a waste of
[1:55:23] time did you hear me you cannot stop the
[1:55:28] arrival of a carrier of a blessing he
[1:55:31] will
[1:55:33] arrive am you hear some people say uh it
[1:55:37] cannot be it cannot be denied but it can
[1:55:40] be delayed delayed by who am I defy that
[1:55:44] statement amen delayed by
[1:55:48] who God is doing something you say you
[1:55:50] are delaying it
[1:55:52] amen you are not fit amen
[1:55:58] amen what you don't understand is that
[1:56:01] God's program work according to his own
[1:56:03] appointed am do you realize that David
[1:56:07] was anointed king and he never took the
[1:56:10] throne until 15 years read your Bible he
[1:56:14] took the throne of Judah on the seventh
[1:56:17] year and it took the entire Throne of
[1:56:19] Israel another seven years
[1:56:22] 14 years went pass before David could
[1:56:26] become the king that is be anointed for
[1:56:30] earlier so the question becomes why did
[1:56:32] go why was God in a hurry to anoint him
[1:56:35] when he wasn't ready to install
[1:56:37] him am have you ever asked yourself that
[1:56:41] God only showed him his destination am
[1:56:45] what he will become to give him faith
[1:56:48] for the journey that no matter what
[1:56:50] happened this will be where we arrive
[1:56:53] but before you get to your destination
[1:56:56] God must work on
[1:56:58] you this is the story of rapture
[1:57:00] Brethren this is the story of adoption
[1:57:03] God must work on you he must fashion
[1:57:06] your image your your character in his
[1:57:10] likeness and that was why through that
[1:57:13] Journey David received the most
[1:57:16] sensitive
[1:57:17] Temptations are you with me amen he got
[1:57:21] caught
[1:57:22] with Sal twice that could have killed
[1:57:25] him because when David gets to the
[1:57:27] throne he's going to have unch
[1:57:29] unchallengeable power and God wanted to
[1:57:32] be sure that this man that will be
[1:57:34] entrusted with this Grace will be able
[1:57:36] to hold it right amen so he was working
[1:57:39] on his character amen for those periods
[1:57:42] there must be a character Amen to match
[1:57:44] every
[1:57:46] achievement otherwise you will lose
[1:57:48] yourself and what was meant to be a
[1:57:50] blessing will eventually destroy you
[1:57:53] amen it is the blessings of God that
[1:57:55] make it rich and added no sorrow so that
[1:57:58] you will not have sorrow God must work
[1:57:59] on you and build you in a fit maturity
[1:58:03] to be able to handle the success
[1:58:10] amen but since the vision was definite
[1:58:13] to David he knew he will rule he knew he
[1:58:16] will reain no matter the assault no
[1:58:18] matter the attack no matter the
[1:58:20] hindrance and that is is the faith it
[1:58:22] must build in you and I we shall surely
[1:58:27] arrive Hallelujah so this Breen said we
[1:58:30] will stop
[1:58:32] it they took it upon themselves let us
[1:58:35] see how Joseph will get there and you
[1:58:38] can read the story in the
[1:58:39] Bible but you see through it all God was
[1:58:43] guiding his
[1:58:44] vision because there must be an expected
[1:58:47] end that's right huh huh huh when they
[1:58:52] plotted to kill him God used
[1:58:54] Reuben the Reuben that created the
[1:58:57] problem to destroy the
[1:58:59] plot he said let us not kill him am amen
[1:59:04] God has not created a vessel that he
[1:59:05] cannot use amen whether you are Satan or
[1:59:08] you are Saint he will use you amen how
[1:59:11] many believe God is using
[1:59:13] Satan ah you don't believe
[1:59:16] that how come you have challenges that
[1:59:19] throw you into prayer
[1:59:23] sometimes your prayer life is so slack
[1:59:24] and God wants to wake it up he will call
[1:59:27] that guy said do something for this said
[1:59:29] but you ain't going to touch him you AR
[1:59:30] going to touch his life oh
[1:59:34] sure Satan is a use and dump in God's
[1:59:38] economy
[1:59:41] yes who created him by the
[1:59:44] way he created him for his
[1:59:49] pleasure the purpose of God is designed
[1:59:52] must Prosper must come to pass and
[1:59:54] without Satan that purpose is not
[1:59:56] complete if all you have is perfection
[2:00:00] this journey of Christianity will be too
[2:00:02] dull for
[2:00:03] you it will be too
[2:00:05] boring God must make thank you my land
[2:00:07] lady God must make you relate from
[2:00:10] somewhere you saw the way you sang
[2:00:12] Amazing Grace a while ago how did you
[2:00:15] feel about it so wonderful huh that was
[2:00:17] what Satan helped us
[2:00:20] produce ah they don't catch
[2:00:24] that Satan must bring to pass what is
[2:00:28] necessary to the purpose of God Amen if
[2:00:31] all you had was Perfection I say
[2:00:33] everything would be too boring and dull
[2:00:36] so God brought the devil to upset
[2:00:38] Perfection so that Redemption could be
[2:00:41] made necessary and through Redemption
[2:00:43] plan you can seek God you can t God as a
[2:00:47] Healer as a savior as a redeemer as a
[2:00:50] deliverer by the time you enjoy him in
[2:00:53] his attribute you are connected to him
[2:00:56] Beyond just being an object of
[2:01:00] worship
[2:01:02] amen but let me say something for a seed
[2:01:05] of God there is not enough activity of
[2:01:08] the devil that can send you to
[2:01:10] hell it will act to bring you to
[2:01:13] Perfection praise God so God used Reuben
[2:01:18] to save the day because he was
[2:01:20] protecting his word and Reuben said
[2:01:22] let's not kill him let's just throw him
[2:01:24] into the dungeon let if anything will
[2:01:26] happen to him let it happen naturally
[2:01:28] the Bible said in his heart he planned
[2:01:31] to come and rescue the boy and go and
[2:01:33] give him to his father but he say as
[2:01:35] good as his plan was it wasn't the
[2:01:37] program of
[2:01:39] God your Shepherd select the path you
[2:01:42] must tread in life before Reuben could
[2:01:44] come to fetch him out of the dungeon
[2:01:47] Brethren God brought the Arabians
[2:01:50] Merchants they fetched him out by
[2:01:52] themselves and the Breen came there and
[2:01:54] took money and that began the journey to
[2:01:58] the realization of the vision the ways
[2:02:02] of God are pass finding God does not see
[2:02:05] as men seeth he doesn't think like you
[2:02:08] do when you think this thing is all
[2:02:10] about adversary problems and challenges
[2:02:13] it is God's part way to bring you to
[2:02:15] that expected end that he has proposed
[2:02:18] for you you see God must blindfold and
[2:02:20] make a fool out of the devil sometimes
[2:02:23] because while those things was going on
[2:02:25] these guys were claiming Victory he said
[2:02:28] it's even good from dungeon to slavery
[2:02:31] as he was going the man who will rule
[2:02:33] over us go and rule over your fellow
[2:02:35] slaves I'm sure you will make a good
[2:02:38] slave for somebody in Egypt that's your
[2:02:40] hand man and truly it looks like that
[2:02:43] was his hand he got to Piper's house but
[2:02:46] you see the power of Promise of that
[2:02:49] prophecy was following this guy
[2:02:52] and look you've got to have the right
[2:02:54] attitude also for your challenges and
[2:02:58] that will only come if you have the
[2:03:00] revelation of what is going on did
[2:03:03] Joseph have the Revelation I say yes
[2:03:06] read your Bible when his Brethren came
[2:03:08] to beg for their lives he said you meant
[2:03:11] it for evil but all this episode was God
[2:03:14] sending me amen it wasn't you you were
[2:03:18] just being used Amen to send me ahead to
[2:03:21] serve your lives amen amen
[2:03:25] amen so many things he couldn't explain
[2:03:29] but he believed it was God working amen
[2:03:31] and that was why in all his situations
[2:03:34] he was having the right positive
[2:03:36] attitude am you never saw him dull you
[2:03:39] never saw him join the pity party you
[2:03:41] say how did you know Mr preacher hey
[2:03:43] this guy got to Piper's house and by the
[2:03:46] time P looked at his Carriage his
[2:03:49] conduct is said
[2:03:50] man there's something about this guy
[2:03:53] he's a complete stranger amen an
[2:03:56] undocumented immigrant
[2:03:59] amen amen he was an Egyptian he wasn't
[2:04:02] an Egyptian amen and yet a lord of Egypt
[2:04:07] could do what handed over his entire
[2:04:10] house even pitifer himself said that the
[2:04:13] only thing I know is the food I ate on
[2:04:14] my table if you want to know how much
[2:04:16] I'm worth the assets I have go ask
[2:04:18] Joseph amen how could that have happened
[2:04:22] amen if you was looking miserable
[2:04:25] dejected am don't give yourself on due
[2:04:28] high blood pressure amen but the the
[2:04:32] Bible told me my Lord told me he said by
[2:04:33] one anxiety you cannot add a centimeter
[2:04:36] to your stature in other word you cannot
[2:04:38] improve your life by worry no wonder our
[2:04:41] Prophet said worry is a curse
[2:04:44] amen amen mhm you said but who is free
[2:04:48] from worry Christians are free from
[2:04:49] worry amen amen
[2:04:53] God wants you to be happy let nothing
[2:04:56] temper with your joy
[2:04:58] amen look at every situation tell the
[2:05:01] situation I will crest you amen I will
[2:05:04] overcome you you cannot submerge me amen
[2:05:08] and let it give you a lift of positive
[2:05:10] attitude amen amen when you are positive
[2:05:13] in all situation you get Satan confused
[2:05:16] I don't know what I would do to this guy
[2:05:18] to upset him in his life that is a life
[2:05:21] we must leave Brethren get him confused
[2:05:24] all the time I've given you an example
[2:05:27] now if he was looking dejected and
[2:05:29] miserable will they appoint him the head
[2:05:32] of the house no you see the truth the
[2:05:35] blessings are hidden between the
[2:05:37] lines you don't entrust your house to
[2:05:40] somebody who is unhappy am somebody who
[2:05:44] is so sad
[2:05:46] discontented
[2:05:47] dejected uh what do you call it
[2:05:49] depression prone amen how would you entr
[2:05:52] and those are the things we walk
[2:05:54] ourselves
[2:05:56] into when God has given you the
[2:05:58] blessings of his word who will wake up
[2:06:01] every morning and read the promises to
[2:06:03] his ourself and tell his soul our soul
[2:06:06] don't worry the Lord will make a way
[2:06:09] somehow I don't know it's going to be
[2:06:11] fixed but I know he will fix
[2:06:15] it that is a positive attitude of a
[2:06:18] Believer not to sit in the pity party
[2:06:20] corner and allow the devil to be telling
[2:06:23] you your problem is the most peculiar on
[2:06:25] the earth he
[2:06:26] lies and because you also oh
[2:06:31] God you have you have you have element
[2:06:33] of deception you will take that how can
[2:06:36] how can the devil tell you you have the
[2:06:39] most peculiar problem on Earth how many
[2:06:40] people do you know on Earth in the what
[2:06:43] is the sample population is using for
[2:06:45] you in the streets where you live how
[2:06:48] many people do you know there how many
[2:06:50] homes have you entered I'm challenging
[2:06:51] you
[2:06:52] now don't you think it's possible in
[2:06:55] some of the homes in there in some of
[2:06:57] the apartments there are people who have
[2:06:58] been bed reading for 12
[2:07:01] years do they look like what sinner than
[2:07:05] you
[2:07:06] oh and he'll be selling you a lie and
[2:07:09] you'll be absorbing
[2:07:11] it and everybody will be under tension
[2:07:14] oh God help our sister we are wasting
[2:07:16] your time and you are wasting our time I
[2:07:19] like it if Paul could come and tell you
[2:07:21] there's no problem that is
[2:07:23] uncommon come on snap out of that
[2:07:26] rubbish
[2:07:27] uhuh you need such voices sometimes it
[2:07:31] may sound offensive but it will jolt you
[2:07:33] to
[2:07:35] reality and when we tell you that we
[2:07:37] will had it also for you that but God is
[2:07:40] faithful who will not tempt you above
[2:07:42] what the the faithfulness of God is such
[2:07:44] that it doesn't tempt above the capacity
[2:07:46] of
[2:07:48] us so if God allow you to go through
[2:07:50] anything is because he and chest out on
[2:07:52] your behalf like he did for job have you
[2:07:54] considered my servant job of all my
[2:07:56] house righteous integrity and
[2:07:58] everything and did job disappoint him
[2:08:02] the power not to disappoint has already
[2:08:04] been put in there look those things are
[2:08:06] in you God has put it in there allow it
[2:08:10] amen allow it to come
[2:08:12] out take
[2:08:15] advantage prise
[2:08:18] God don't look into your problems look
[2:08:20] full in the wonderful face of God Joseph
[2:08:23] may not be able to explain all things
[2:08:25] but he knew that all these things is
[2:08:27] working for his
[2:08:31] good then when God looked at he had
[2:08:34] stayed too long in the house of pitifer
[2:08:37] it stayed enough time he created
[2:08:40] adversary through the wife of
[2:08:42] portier and they told lie on
[2:08:45] him and nobody could plead the cause of
[2:08:48] an helpless servant and but you see it
[2:08:51] was God's part again each part was very
[2:08:55] adverse are you catching that but it was
[2:08:58] bringing him
[2:09:00] nearer to the
[2:09:02] Fulfillment of the
[2:09:05] vision so the revealed with of God was
[2:09:08] what he was going to become the
[2:09:10] unrevealed one was how he was going to
[2:09:13] become it amen but is God to trust God
[2:09:17] each step of the
[2:09:19] way they put in prison but I tell you
[2:09:24] even though Joseph couldn't explain why
[2:09:26] it's Calamity upon Calamity he never
[2:09:29] lost
[2:09:31] himself he ped himself together he
[2:09:34] remained positive until the controller
[2:09:36] of prison said ah there's something
[2:09:37] about this guy am you see do you know
[2:09:40] that Christians are the people who live
[2:09:42] not with a fake facade but with a
[2:09:45] genuine continent like they have no
[2:09:47] problem
[2:09:49] amen you know why they've cast their
[2:09:51] heavy
[2:09:52] burdens he said they took it to the Lord
[2:09:55] and did what leave it there they don't
[2:09:58] take it there and take it back it will
[2:10:00] be too heavy a load so they rolled it
[2:10:02] they drop it there and they went home
[2:10:04] free and you ask them about their
[2:10:06] challenges is at the feet of the
[2:10:09] Cross that's why they can retain their
[2:10:13] Peace
[2:10:14] uhhuh So
[2:10:17] Joseph looked great again and they
[2:10:20] control up this something about this guy
[2:10:23] said you know what you are the defacto
[2:10:25] controller of prison now and let me warn
[2:10:27] you there's no jail break here you will
[2:10:31] account for every guy in this place so
[2:10:34] Joseph became the de facto controller
[2:10:36] and the pastor of the group of the
[2:10:39] entire
[2:10:41] prison let me go all the while with a
[2:10:44] song and a smile fill my way every day
[2:10:49] with your love
[2:10:51] amen nothing could disintegrate his
[2:10:55] person I like characters like this if I
[2:10:59] want the model these are my models
[2:11:00] friends they did this before the cross
[2:11:04] how much more after the cross they did
[2:11:07] this when they do not have the Holy
[2:11:09] Ghost as a possession but just as an
[2:11:11] inspiration how much more you that have
[2:11:13] the right the benefit of receiving Holy
[2:11:16] Ghost inside of you and you will tell me
[2:11:18] the quality of life will be lower than
[2:11:19] that tell somebody
[2:11:24] else am I jolting you to reality that
[2:11:27] some of the things that you know we have
[2:11:29] to prod and beg and push us
[2:11:32] about it shows the
[2:11:35] quality if before the cross this BR were
[2:11:39] this Gallant go read Hebrews 11 great
[2:11:43] Saints many lived before the cross and I
[2:11:46] tell you it was a balanced report as it
[2:11:48] was much for the men so was it much for
[2:11:51] the
[2:11:53] women and you were expecting to go to
[2:11:56] the same Heaven they went come and tap
[2:11:58] into your grace and live better than you
[2:12:01] are doing praise God Amen I'm winding
[2:12:05] down but get this
[2:12:07] quickly all right and then Joseph became
[2:12:12] the controller again because his person
[2:12:15] was not
[2:12:17] disintegrated there is no challenge no
[2:12:19] problem that could break him that's what
[2:12:22] I'm telling you you say is it possible
[2:12:24] I'm giving you evidence show me
[2:12:27] otherwise what we need is not to be
[2:12:30] looking for is it possible With God all
[2:12:33] things are tap into the grace that makes
[2:12:35] it possible amen I'm raising your faith
[2:12:39] level and I'm challenging your
[2:12:45] faith and one day Joseph saw two of his
[2:12:49] uh church members the ejected maybe they
[2:12:52] didn't come for prison fellowship
[2:12:54] amen and uh he he went to look for them
[2:12:57] and he saw the two of them dejected
[2:13:00] having conversation between themselves
[2:13:02] said brethren we didn't see you at the
[2:13:03] prison fellowship what was going on here
[2:13:07] sir I saw a dream and I saw a dream okay
[2:13:10] tell us your dream my dream
[2:13:13] says uh I was uh you know he said his
[2:13:16] own the butler said his own he said okay
[2:13:19] and you Baker this is my my dream ah
[2:13:22] said brother Baker God be with you till
[2:13:25] we meet again you aren't going to come
[2:13:27] out of this Pharaoh will kill you he
[2:13:30] said but brother Butler you're going to
[2:13:33] be restored back to the White House you
[2:13:36] will serve the president again am and he
[2:13:39] said please when you get back remember
[2:13:42] me amen as a man Joseph
[2:13:46] pleaded for
[2:13:48] assistance but let me tell you if the
[2:13:51] assistance came at that time it will be
[2:13:55] an alteration to the
[2:13:57] vision am did you catch that look some
[2:14:01] of you looked up to some people
[2:14:03] sometimes you looked up to your uncles
[2:14:05] even to your parents to somebody who you
[2:14:07] feel it so connected and it could have
[2:14:09] made things happen for you if they are
[2:14:12] not part of the
[2:14:14] vision it's not going to work you see
[2:14:18] Christians must Rise Above This uh
[2:14:21] sentiment of attachment your greatest
[2:14:23] connector is the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:14:28] himself he must be the one to take glory
[2:14:31] in all your
[2:14:34] circumstance if that person couldn't do
[2:14:36] it don't have no issue against any man
[2:14:40] don't be bitter against nobody it's
[2:14:42] because they were not part of the
[2:14:45] vision God will not walk outside of his
[2:14:48] vision his program for your life because
[2:14:51] you are thought
[2:14:53] expressed so Those whom you have held in
[2:14:56] your heart go and release
[2:14:58] them it's not necessary it's not
[2:15:00] necessary they will hinder you from
[2:15:02] making it they will hinder you from
[2:15:04] making it here and making it in glory
[2:15:07] because if you have what against anybody
[2:15:09] you are walking over the dangers of Hell
[2:15:10] Fire release them how many will promise
[2:15:13] to release them oh releasing
[2:15:19] them the botler went back to the White
[2:15:22] House he went back to the throne and as
[2:15:25] he got back God took away the
[2:15:29] memory it wasn't natural for you to have
[2:15:32] related with a person for so long in the
[2:15:34] prison and he was the one that even gave
[2:15:37] the prophecy of your deliverance huh and
[2:15:40] you expect you will get back to your
[2:15:43] office and forget him is it natural it's
[2:15:45] not possible their event their meeting
[2:15:48] was not a chance meeting they have a
[2:15:49] relationship
[2:15:51] and the man go back to the throne and he
[2:15:53] didn't remember Joseph no for one day it
[2:15:56] was the Lord's working he took it out
[2:16:00] you know why God doesn't want nobody to
[2:16:03] share his
[2:16:05] glory over Joseph he doesn't want he
[2:16:08] doesn't want he doesn't want Joseph
[2:16:10] being brought out of pity amen and
[2:16:13] somebody will say if not for
[2:16:15] me say again I should say it again all
[2:16:19] right he doesn't want Joseph
[2:16:21] being brought out of
[2:16:23] pity so that somebody will say come on
[2:16:27] keep quiet if not for me it will always
[2:16:30] be even not for
[2:16:34] God he want Joseph brought out of
[2:16:37] necessity amen when it will become so
[2:16:40] necessary instead of we preing him we
[2:16:43] are the one that needs his messy
[2:16:46] now he wants him to come out out of
[2:16:48] Honor
[2:16:50] so he wiped up the memory and everything
[2:16:53] seemed to continue the man was busy with
[2:16:56] his work and they were enjoying
[2:16:57] themselves with the King then one day in
[2:17:00] God's appointed season according to the
[2:17:05] vision you see how your life is working
[2:17:08] now ahuh is a story of your life I'm
[2:17:11] telling you in God's appointed season
[2:17:14] according to the vision God went to the
[2:17:17] king of Egypt he had a dream the dream
[2:17:20] look so simple Brethren but when God is
[2:17:23] ready to single you out for honor it
[2:17:27] makes everybody looks foolish around
[2:17:31] here so that is why you must not take
[2:17:34] glory for anything you must always say
[2:17:36] thank
[2:17:38] God huh
[2:17:40] huh all right God bless you
[2:17:44] so they saw the he saw the dream nobody
[2:17:47] could help him the King was becoming
[2:17:49] frustrated helpless and an appless and
[2:17:52] in the process he was getting mad
[2:17:54] deciding to deal with the people and
[2:17:57] maybe the uncle of the botler is one of
[2:17:59] the people to be dealt with everybody
[2:18:00] was wondering what would happen then God
[2:18:03] said now it's time then God just blew
[2:18:05] the
[2:18:06] braid and he
[2:18:10] said sister Nami how could I have
[2:18:14] forgotten ah how would I face Pastor
[2:18:18] Joseph now this many years
[2:18:21] have been restored to my position and I
[2:18:23] didn't remember Pastor exist oh God oh
[2:18:26] God but nevertheless uh better L than
[2:18:29] never he went to the king he said you
[2:18:31] know what all this problem we are having
[2:18:34] that is creating tension in government
[2:18:35] in the nation is a simple
[2:18:37] problem so you know that all along and
[2:18:40] you are allowing us to go into the no
[2:18:42] it's not about me it's about
[2:18:45] uh one man said where is he he a
[2:18:50] prisoner
[2:18:52] who is a
[2:18:57] immigrant
[2:18:59] ah Pharaoh said get next to
[2:19:02] yourself I'm we are talking of serious
[2:19:05] national issue you are talking about hey
[2:19:08] you better take it serious in this our
[2:19:11] dark time this is the only man who can
[2:19:12] turn on the light if you really want
[2:19:15] light let's go get this
[2:19:18] man ah there's a man who can turn on the
[2:19:21] [Applause]
[2:19:23] he said okay okay okay okay let's go get
[2:19:26] him they went to the prison Brother
[2:19:29] Joseph took him for grooming nice
[2:19:31] appearance looking great and sharp and
[2:19:34] he came before the king ah welcome Mr
[2:19:37] Joseph I was told you can solve our
[2:19:40] problem said no sir I can't solve no
[2:19:43] problem if he was a man who has been
[2:19:45] dejected and disappointed in God will he
[2:19:49] check the king on the glory he was going
[2:19:52] to give
[2:19:53] him he checked him he said no it's only
[2:19:57] god of Heaven who I serve before Pharaoh
[2:20:00] Joseph was testifying about God who had
[2:20:03] taken him through all those challenges
[2:20:05] that speaks volume of his
[2:20:08] relationship little light Affliction
[2:20:10] some of you don't come to church again
[2:20:11] you don't read your Bible you don't want
[2:20:14] to pray again how will your testimony
[2:20:16] stand before
[2:20:17] Joseph do you know the span of years he
[2:20:20] went through all these challenges and
[2:20:22] yet nothing could break
[2:20:24] him because he's God God he that is in
[2:20:27] you is greater than he that is in the
[2:20:30] world is greater than that problem he
[2:20:33] greater than that
[2:20:34] challenge they can't submerge you
[2:20:37] because you got the great
[2:20:39] God and by the great God you got Greater
[2:20:42] Grace Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that
[2:20:45] is greater
[2:20:50] he saidh there's a God who can do that
[2:20:53] said
[2:20:54] yeah the god of Heaven whom I serve will
[2:20:57] deal with your matter explain your
[2:20:59] matter when he explained Joseph you all
[2:21:02] know the story Joseph gave all the
[2:21:04] explanation the interpretation and
[2:21:07] Pharaoh was so pleased then he said what
[2:21:10] is the solution God gave the
[2:21:12] interpretation he gave the
[2:21:14] solution
[2:21:16] mhm any Vision any Prophet that is in
[2:21:19] your problem but is not offering
[2:21:21] solution is a counterfeit
[2:21:23] Prophet oh
[2:21:25] yes especially you
[2:21:30] Africans who love your prophets they
[2:21:33] will always tell you who is undoing you
[2:21:36] but they will never show you how to come
[2:21:39] on they only playing on your on your
[2:21:42] emotions you know the devil DS with a
[2:21:45] man the way his mind runs they know what
[2:21:47] will exite you and they are giving it to
[2:21:48] you in tongs shame on the devil this
[2:21:51] morning amen
[2:21:53] amen amen he gave them the
[2:21:57] interpretation he gave them solution and
[2:21:59] he said let a man be appointed to take
[2:22:02] care of all this business Pharaoh
[2:22:03] laughed I said let a man be appointed
[2:22:06] who is the man with whom is the spirit
[2:22:08] of God like this that can handle this
[2:22:11] matter or that this Joseph are you all
[2:22:13] listening to me Joseph you are the man
[2:22:17] from today amen you take over amen you
[2:22:19] are the prime Minister he removed his
[2:22:22] ring he gave it to him from prison to
[2:22:24] the throne amen he said it is only in
[2:22:27] the throne that I'll be your Superior
[2:22:30] you take charge of
[2:22:32] everything thus say the Lord can never
[2:22:35] fail the vision is for an appointed
[2:22:42] time and I can see the years of plenty
[2:22:44] finishing and I can see the years of him
[2:22:47] in coming and I can see Jacob telling
[2:22:50] the brother
[2:22:51] we learned that a great Revival is going
[2:22:53] on in Egypt there's a mighty prince in
[2:22:56] Egypt who is turning things around go to
[2:22:58] him maybe we can find favor and Jacob
[2:23:02] never knew Israel never knew that was
[2:23:03] his own son and I can see the brothers
[2:23:06] came and they said before as they came
[2:23:10] god with their eyes and he opened the
[2:23:12] eyes of Joseph and they saw that these
[2:23:15] were his brothers he said you know these
[2:23:17] guys they are not ordinary buyers
[2:23:19] customers send them in to come and do
[2:23:21] their transaction then they told them
[2:23:23] you must deal with the prince of the
[2:23:25] land for this your transaction because
[2:23:28] it's just the protocol it's a special a
[2:23:30] presidential order and there's nothing
[2:23:32] we can do about are you ready to face he
[2:23:34] said what did we do don't take us to the
[2:23:36] Prime Minister what did we do said you
[2:23:38] must come and as they came I can see
[2:23:40] them fell down
[2:23:42] flat did they bow on
[2:23:44] us did they bow or not
[2:23:49] am can you Stamper with the vision no
[2:23:51] way it came to pass not one time not two
[2:23:55] times I counted about five times you say
[2:23:58] maybe it was when they didn't know it
[2:23:59] was Joseph let me take you
[2:24:02] further after Joseph had revealed
[2:24:05] himself amen and there seemed to be no
[2:24:09] problem again and their father died they
[2:24:12] said they became afraid they said H it
[2:24:14] was our father that gave us favor before
[2:24:17] Joseph that's why he didn't destroy us
[2:24:19] but now that they our father has died
[2:24:21] Joseph will now visit you see if you are
[2:24:24] wrong if you if you if you are doing
[2:24:28] wrong and you didn't make it right
[2:24:29] properly the guilt of sin will never
[2:24:31] leave you when you make it right
[2:24:34] properly the devil will still want to
[2:24:36] call you on it but tell him old Satan
[2:24:38] say my Lord was gone and will not hear
[2:24:41] my prayer but thanks be to God the work
[2:24:44] is done if you make your way right
[2:24:47] properly the blood avails automatically
[2:24:50] you don't need an audible voice to tell
[2:24:52] you you already forgiven accept your
[2:24:55] pardon and rise above
[2:24:58] it but this Breen couldn't just come out
[2:25:01] of it so the Bible said they came
[2:25:05] together they formed Society of guilty
[2:25:08] brothers and came again now knowing
[2:25:10] Joseph and come to beg for their life
[2:25:13] and the Bible say when they came they
[2:25:15] did what again they bowed amen thus say
[2:25:19] the Lord amen
[2:25:20] can never fail they bowed according to
[2:25:23] the dreams of Joseph they fell before
[2:25:26] him flatly and Joseph became their
[2:25:28] provider through to the blessing of
[2:25:31] Birthright the nourisher of their lives
[2:25:34] until the seasons of faming were over
[2:25:37] Joseph relocated them to Egypt in order
[2:25:40] to fulfill the larger promise of the
[2:25:42] word so there's always a large picture
[2:25:45] which other subsections of pictures must
[2:25:48] bring together in order for the expected
[2:25:51] end that God desires will be achieved
[2:25:54] that is the story of your life God bless
[2:25:56] you God bless you thank
