Again, we greet you and even those that are home and online tonight, we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's read from James chapter 5 tonight. [clears throat] James chapter 5 to the tech team. I just uh u send you my my notes I will be using when I got him. So if you if you have not got it just look in the email you see it. Let's read James chapter 5 tonight is uh let's read from verse 13. Very familiar. Very familiar. Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any married? Let him sing psalms. Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church and let them praying over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On Sunday, we spoke a little bit on the anointing. The anointing break the yolks. That's one of the reason why I read this scripture tonight. But let's continue. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up. And if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stop right there. Father, we will ask blessing upon your word tonight. We want to go in the same land of thought uh uh the anointing of the hour that the church has to respond to. So we just pray that you would come and bless us now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Now, so I want to I want to just uh start up here by reading something to you from uh faith [snorts] in the son of god. [clears throat] Faith in the son of god. And we'll go into our subject tonight. Good good faith in the son of god. Now the pastor if if he's not a gifted man or sofa with understanding he did better anoint the man with oil because that's what stands between him and the sickness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's that's one of the main reason why I read that scripture tonight. It is It's a Bible ordinance. It's a Bible instruction. &gt;&gt; Call for the other and let him and and let the sick be anointed with oil. Amen. It remain the word of God. It stays remain the truth. But why is it done? Why do we do it? The reason why is there uh uh sometime ago one one brother a friend of mine called and he says uh he says brother one do you have anointing oil? I said yes I do. He says, "I would want some." I says, "For what?" Said, "Well, I I just I just want to have some in my house to, you know, to uh to anoint my home and uh uh I can't remember the details. What for bad dreams and all that, praise the Lord." And I was I was trying to pull his legs a little bit. I says, "Well, the Bible say we must call for the Amen. &gt;&gt; I said the Bible says we must call for the elder and uh uh have you got your editorship yet? Praise the Lord. Now because I say this because uh I mean with uh with uh uh this Laia age is a is a spiritual age. It's a very high religious age. Amen. and uh and and all of that all of these things are done. You know, people just think, you know, you get an anointing oil or you you shake it in the corner of your house and you know, you going to drive demons away or you going to drive evil spirits away. Praise the Lord. I will tell you that those spirits will not go away if there is something in your life that is attracting it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The spirits just don't come in a board in our home or in our neighborhood is is is the people that attracts it. We have to realize that spirits are spirits and and and uh uh they don't have no ability. They can do nothing until they have a vessel &gt;&gt; to work through. Praise the Lord. Until that spirit have a vessel, until that spirit has a nature that it can attach itself to is powerless. Both the spirit of the devil and also the spirit of God. Until the spirit of God has a body that he can work through, he's just going to remain almighty God with all of his power and everything that he can do until he has a vessel that he can work through. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh uh uh uh I I had I had to look for this quickly to just throw it into my my presentation tonight. Uh uh [clears throat] I was talking talking with a sister on Sunday and and this came across my mind. So uh I remember it tonight. So I said well okay I know uh used this long time ago now. So the pastor once again if he's not a gifted man or so forth with uh understanding he he he did better anoint the man with oil because that's what stands between him and and the sickness the the the anointing oil stands between the sick person and the sickness. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It also stands between the preacher and the sickness. Are we together? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Or he could take it himself. Now he takes he takes the order that James gave them the elder of the church and let him anoint him with oil and pray over them. That's exactly the church to anoint with oil. That oil represent the Holy Spirit stands between the pastor and the sickness. That's right. He anoints them with oil representing the Holy Spirit. Just giving over to the Holy Spirit. You are giving the situation over to the Holy Spirit. Amen. Then he prayed for the person. And I have seen it. I have seen it. I've seen uh uh uh uh praying for someone that is sick. I mean, we were one many years ago praying for the sister that was dealing with something. And because of the way that she was moving herself, we had to bring in some of the the sisters, the pastor wife and all of that. And right after they s their prayer, the the the brother's wife got so sle. You know, it was just very resol. She she had to be with him for for a while and we knew straight that. Yeah. That was that was an effect of there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, uh I just that is just an appetizer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just had to go that way tonight so I can I can be able to where to balance. But uh it's good to be with you tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. It's good to be with you tonight. So uh uh on uh on Sunday, we were talking on the church responding to her anointing. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were talking on the church responding to her anointing. If uh if uh if the brothers Emmanuel, if you can go back to my note on Sunday and uh uh we were talking on the church responding to her anointing and we want to read we want to read uh uh uh the quote that we read there from the fifth seal. Praise the Lord. Amen. I have a portion of it uh drawn with this but I want to go back to there for for some reason now from the pill this this is what we read and that's where our inspiration was from don't forget this church and you brethren on tape I want you to examine this how could a man do anything else beside the power of God that has been released to them. Praise the Lord. How can a man do anything else beside the power of God that been released to them? I'm going to set this box up here to represent that if God send a certain spirit among them, that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that is working among them. Praise the Lord. Now we will prove to you by the history of the church and the opening of the seals and the power that is left loose. Now watch exactly the church responding to the anointing and it couldn't do nothing else. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh, uh, this this whole thing of, uh, Revelation 4, five, and 6 that we've been dwelling on, like I said, I'm I'm not a teacher. I'm not a teacher. Uh, uh, so I had uh there there there's a tendency of uh making teaching to preaching. And that's what I've been doing because I'm not really staying on the subject to be able to just carry you through like the way a teacher would do it. So, uh, so I'm sorry I'm doing a very poor job. Praise the Lord. But, uh, uh, I need I need to do it because that's what my inspiration is. So, I hope that is a blessing to you. Praise the Lord. and uh uh down there in um Zimbabwe after after the the meeting uh we preach one of the live message to close the meeting and uh the brother said well brother War is uh you you are a teacher I said no I'm not a teacher says well but what you did was a teaching I well I hope you know who a teacher was amen and praise the Lord so Let's uh let's go ahead here. Emmanuel, if you want to put my image up. If you want to put my image up. The one with the parade. Good. Good. Good. Good. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6. Let's go back to Revelation chapter 6. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh we were we've been dwelling on this for a while, a whole while. And and I think if I stay more on it, you might start seeing it in your dreams. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it should not make you afraid with everything that we have said about this. When you dream about it, it should not make you afraid. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh uh uh these were representing the full uh evil power, evil beast that is waring against the church. If you read uh Revelation chapter 9, you will understand that when the bottomless pit was open, there was a dark smoke that came out of the bottomless pit. That was a release of demon powers into the earth. So that's what this represent. So these are the powers. Amen. And uh uh if you also read the book of Daniel, you'll see where Daniel is talking about, you know, the the different beasts and different powers that that was waring in his age. They are all represented here one way or the other &gt;&gt; and these are also the anointing that is given to counter this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When the enemy come as a flaw, &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord will raise up &gt;&gt; extender. &gt;&gt; So this anointing was the standard of God in the church ages. [snorts] Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were the standard of God in the church ages to resist the lies of the devil. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To resist the lies of the devil. Now, because if we know how these things work, if we know how they work, we will know how to be able to to order our thoughts. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Now take take for example the greatest battles ever fought. The mind is the battleground. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And it is these two powers that are war against our mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what happen is that sometimes we blame ourself for those thoughts and we don't re really realize that is the enemy that is channeling those thoughts through our mind. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So uh uh that's the reason why we want to look we want to look at it very close. We want to look at it very very close. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What an awesome God we serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful, wonderful father we have. Praise the Lord. Now so we said uh uh uh there is something I want I want to come to tonight uh uh because you see our age which is under the ego's anointing is is a little bit different from the rest of these ages. Praise the Lord. Okay. All of these rainbow color blocks representing the seven church ages. Our age is a little bit different. And and that's what I want us to I want us to be able to pay attention to. The reason is that the reason when Jesus said you are in this word but you are not part of the word. Praise the Lord. You are in this word. He was speaking to his disciples but you are not part of the word. It kind of describe our age. Praise the Lord. Because the age in general is the Laudisha church age. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh uh let me see. Do we have another block that has the church ages name by the side in uh in all our pictures? Okay. Yeah, let's use this one. Yeah, let's use this one now. So, uh uh uh Okay. Yeah, it comes with the statue of the perfect man now. So, uh like I said, our age is a little bit different and it's it's beautiful. Yeah, let's let's use this one. It's beautiful. The anointings are there. The messengers are there. The church ages are there. Okay, let's deal with this now. So, uh when we look at this, like I said, the lion's anointing right here operated in these three church ages. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It operated in these three church ages. the Ephesole, the Samad and the Pagamos church ages were under the lion anointing. Now under these these uh uh three church ages, that was where the white horse rather ruled. Amen. Revelation chapter 6. Let's go there. Let the picture stay up. Turn to your Bible if you have it with you. If not, just follow the reading. We'll keep the picture up for now. And I saw when the lamb opened one of the seal. We said on Sunday we will represent the lamb because we have the Bible in our heads. The Bible represent the book of life. The book that was sealed with seven seals. So we will represent the lamb. And then you are John. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are John because John represent the bride. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So [clears throat] John is the one narrating to us here. And I saw when the lamb open one of the seal are open and he says and I heard as it was a noise of thunder and one of the four beasts which is one of these anointing. And in this in this condition now where we are reading it will be the lion anointing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The lion anointing is the one now that is saying one of the four beast saying come and see. Praise the Lord. Amen. So uh uh this beast is calling to you John to come and see what I have open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lamb has the book open. And this anointing is calling to the church to come and see what is on this seal. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh here here is the principle that that is lying in there that actually you cannot see when Jesus said the devil comes to steal, kill and destroy. There is no way you can be able to identify it in your age until you have heard the voice of your anointing that is saying come and see. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We as humans there is no way we can be able to identify the working of the devil. I will tell you tonight that there are even things that war in our life that we can attribute to the devil because of the way uh uh the nature of that thing is. But actually when you when when when you really look at it through the eyes of your messenger, he will tell you that it's your family strain. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He will tell you that it's your family strain. And and some of these family strain that we deal with in our life, they are things that we will have to keep under the blood. We will have to keep like like brother Brandham says, we will have TO KEEP IT HONOR PRAYERS BECAUSE THOSE are the areas WHERE THE DEVIL HAS THE right to hit you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will have to keep it honor prayers and and and and for some of us it will be until we get a body change. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Until we get a body change. Now, so that is the thing that is important because you see there is there the the church in many ways uh uh uh you know uh believing in God. Where did I put my mark now? Okay. Know where my hand? Okay. Have it right here. Now the church in many ways it brings us to the place where sometimes we we we get frustrated. Amen. Now take this even with the apostle Paul that that familiar scripture my grace is sufficient my strength is made perfect in your weakness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that what Paul was referring to that the Lord told him his grace was sufficient is because Paul had an eye problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not something that he was born with. It was something that affected his eyes from the light of the pillow of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God uh humbling that educated uh jewel that that that young jewel boy that was so zillious. God way of humbling him was to be able to affect him. I mean HE SAW THE LIGHT UH UH SHINING so bright and he could even identify it scripturally when he said Lord who art thou? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he heard the very name that he was he was persecuting. I'm Jesus. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I call him to the testimony. Paul got blind. He was led. The book of Acts says they led him by the hands and and and and and God had to tell Ananas to go and meet Paul somewhere. He's blind. I just blinded him. Go and meet him. Ananas said, "Well, I've heard that that is the man that is persecuting the church." God said, "Don't worry. That one I've already knocked him off." Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Don't be afraid. I've already knocked that one. He's one of us now. &gt;&gt; So, Ananas went prayed for him. He received his sight. But the eyes still have problem. And until he died, he never got healing to his eyes. The more he prayed about it, the more it bother him. In one of his writing, he said, "I even had to write with big letters because of my eyes." Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see, that never had anything to do with the Holy Ghost. He had &gt;&gt; that never had anything to do with his new birth. &gt;&gt; That never had anything to do with what God was doing in his life. Even with THE EYE PROBLEM, PAUL WAS UH I mean he was he was he was uh h bold to stand in THE SYNAGOGUE. EVERY GIVEN OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every given opportunity. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see we cannot be able to rightly identify the working of the devil. &gt;&gt; Remember now Hebrew chapter 4:12 tells us that the word of God is sharper &gt;&gt; like a two-edged sword. And what it does is that it counts and it separate. It goes at the dividing aunder of your soul and your spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I was I was looking at there today is it's very beautiful. I was I was actually looking at there today and uh uh uh &gt;&gt; are we together? Sometimes that's what happen when uh when it's not exactly what you want to preach, but because you were studying it, it has a way of coming back to haunt you. Uh uh Matthew chapter 22. Let's go there quickly. Let's go there quickly. Another time when I'm speaking on it, you will know exactly what I'm talking about. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Matthew 22 uh verse 34. But when the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. Then one of them which was a lawyer which mean a student of the word that what it means a lawyer somebody that is a student of the word asks him a question tempting him and saying master which is the greatest commandment in the Lord. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now follow this. Now Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mind here will be the same as your spirit. The mind and the spirit, Paul used that interchangeably. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, love the Lord with all of your heart. Love the Lord with all of your soul. Love the Lord with all of your mind, all of your spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. the the spirit is willing and the flesh is weak. &gt;&gt; That was a statement that came in the temptation of Jesus when he told the disciples to pray. And because all hell was against what was happening, the disciples couldn't even find strength to pray. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't find strength to pray. Now the question there was that the why why I'm coming in here so you can see is that uh uh uh Jesus he's using this verse from from from Moses and and and he's trying to make us to see something. Love the Lord with all of your heart, all of your soul and all of your spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so it's in a place that when your flesh is weak, it does not change the love of God that is in your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you're bothered, when when when you are affected, when when you are on a depression or you are worrying, your spirit is affected, you are worrying, you are trouble in your spirit. It do not change the love of God in your soul. Because Paul tells us in Romans chapter five that the love of God, Amen. &gt;&gt; He says the love of God is brought about h by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In our soul. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is beautiful. &gt;&gt; Yes. when we look at it together here. So he said, "Love the Lord with all of your heart, all of your soul, all of your mind. This is the first and the great commmenting." &gt;&gt; I was studying this today, but I was looking at it on a different subject, but this is what I learned as I was as I was studying the scripture right here. This is where Jesus divided the ten commandments into two. When you read all the Mark or Luke account, Jesus says uh the ten commandment, they are just two. Love the Lord with all of your heart and love your neighbors as yourself. And when you look at the way the ten commandments is listed, the first four commandments have to do with loving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first four commandments have to do not worship an engraven image. Do not do not bow down to them. Do not take the Lord your God the name of the the Lord your God in vain. And the fourth one is that honor the Sabbath. All of that have to do with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he called that the great commandment. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And the second he says here, "And the second is likely unto this." is likely unto this. Meaning that from the the the the fifth commandment COMING DOWN, EVERY ONE OF them are likely. They have to do with somebody. They have to do with your neighbors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fifth commandment, honor your or your father and your mother. They are your neighbor. They are your closest neighbors. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The next one, DO NOT STEAL. DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS. I mean, do not steal. It's is your neighbor. Do not bear false when against your neighbor. So it has to do with people. And what I learned in this is that what I learned in this that was nothing part of this tonight but I don't know how I got there. But what I learned in this is they are there the the the the second commandment. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They are six. Four have to do with the Lord your God. The six has to do with loving your neighbors as yourself. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Six is the number of men. &gt;&gt; So there are PEOPLE WITHOUT THE HOLY Ghost that can keep the rest of the six. There are people that not BORN AGAIN. THEY LOVE their parents. They honor their parents. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T GO TO CHURCH, BUT THEY WILL NOT STEAL from their neighbor. &gt;&gt; THEY WON'T BEAR FALSE WITNESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said they are likely like this. They are connected. They have to do with the people around you. They have to DO WITH YOUR ENVIRONMENT. WHILE THE FIRST FOUR HAVE TO do with the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need God &gt;&gt; to honor the first four. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need a revelation to honor the Sabbath &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HONORING THE SABBATH IS PUTTING GOD FIRST. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So the word OF GOD IS SHARPER THAN THE TWO-EDGED SWORD. So when the word comes in your life, when the word is revealed to you, it goes and it divide gets to the divide in the sun of your soul and your spirit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your your soul is u is a it's a home IS IT'S A DWELLING place for the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a dwelling place. The word gets right in there. David will say, "Restore my soul." Amen. &gt;&gt; The word goes in there your soul to bring true consciousness of God to you. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A person spirit can comes on an influence of the word. They can become religious but they never receive a birth in their soul. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; they are going to be religious and still have an animal nature &gt;&gt; right in the face of the word of God. They can do the most craziest thing because their soul is not delivered. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I was coming to when I say our age is a little bit different. The reason why I say that is because this age is harvest time. &gt;&gt; This is the age of the fullness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We cannot play religion under the message. We can't be religious under the message. We can't play church under the message because the word has come to deal with us face to face. &gt;&gt; THE WORD HAS COME TO BRING US REALITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And if we get serious with the word, WE'RE GOING TO KNOW OURSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE WILL KNOW OURSELF. WE WILL UNDERSTAND OURSELF. WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THE GRACE OF GOD IS DOING. YOU WILL YOU WILL SEE THE DIVIDING the sun. You will see the grace of God dealing with your soul CHANGING YOUR LIFE. You will see THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO WAR WITH IN YOUR SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So that's why I said our age is a little bit different. So the lion anointing had to warn against it. It it has to battle yet in this in these three church ages. Yeah. The deed the deed of the nickel was was introduced in this in this age here. It just started as a deed as a as a good thought good good intention. Praise the Lord. Good intention. And then we we just need to have some choirs. You know, everybody can sing. So let's let's just pay some people to train their voice. I mean, they would do the singing for us because when we singing, we just out of tone. Out of tone. Doesn't that sound nice? Praise the Lord. We out of tune. We can't even clap our hands straight. The musicians are playing one thing. The singers are singing another thing. Sometime I don't even know if I'm host or my voice is clear. Praise. Good idea. Good idea. And pretty soon I said, "Oh, wow. Yeah, we will pay them. We will pay them. We will pay them. They will dedicate themselves to to training, to singing, you know, uh they will do the worship. And that was not just a wound thing. They were taking away this this the liberty of the spirit from the people. &gt;&gt; They were bounding the people and the people never knew that. They were making them cold to just come and sit down and become spectator. And they didn't know that. &gt;&gt; It came in very that's a good idea. That's a good thought. Praise the Lord. Why if you go in the desert, you you you you save somebody in the desert and and there is no water for you to baptize them. What are you going to do? Well, you can just take water from your camper and just sprink it over their head. That will be easy. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT OPENED THE RARE SEAT AND CAUSE A PATH THROUGH THE RED SEA. Can he open the desert and pour water there? &gt;&gt; And won't need to be baptized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see all of those ideas, they came across slowly and the church embraced him. And as the people embraced him is is slowly drive the spirit away. And that's what Paul was dealing with in this age. When you real when you read church history, you realize that uh when Paul right there in in Rome when the Roman church because there were two churches in Rome. There were two churches in Rome there. There was there was the the Roman church and there was a small group of believers that choose to stay with the apostle teaching. Praise the Lord. The ones that were known or called to be fanatics And these other ones, they were happy because uh I mean h big men of the Roman government is now coming to their churches. Did you hear that? uh uh uh uh uh you know uh the the the the centurum from from uh uh you know uh uh where's the blessing he's he I heard he will be in church Constantine invited him praise the Lord. So now that that church that was looking like just like an old struggling church, now they have big men associated with them and and you know and and then the status go. But then the thing also is that you can't sit down beside the big men. So all of you people that are little class, y'all go back. You leave the front seat for the generous and the the big people. nicolating &gt;&gt; dividing &gt;&gt; and then that just how it started creeping in the church. So Paul this anointing of uh of Paul teaching how to fight against this in these three church ages. But we will learn from Revelation chapter 6 that the the the the deed got a crown. So that doctrine, trinitarian doctrine was crowned right here. And when it got a crown, IT HAS SO MUCH POWER TO DO WHAT? Move to the next edge and create death. Praise the Lord. And sometimes that is the same thing that the enemy tried to bring to us. You know, he tried to give us reason to, you know, to relax, not to just be I mean overzeilious. He He just tried to take all your little spirituality away from you and before you realize &gt;&gt; you are spiritually dead. &gt;&gt; The thing that will move your heart uh uh WITH GOD IN PRAYER and and and and I mean when it used to be before you fell empty AND YOU FELL BACKSLIDING IN YOUR WAYS, YOU WOULD CRY to God. It's no longer there. Everything now is just reasoning in your mind. Are we together? &gt;&gt; When it got a crown here, it moved here and it became death. Let's go. Let's go. Go change the picture now. Go over to to our quote on the fifth seal. If you have it, let's read a little bit. I want to I want I want to pick up something. It's 9:00. I should be closing. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will just read there. Okay, I'll go ahead and they will catch with us. was exactly like the church responding to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else. Now the first was that lion that ro pure unadulterated word. The second in territorial was the ox anointing the burden a beast of burden pardon me. It it was uh also a a sacrificial beast. And wasn't that exactly the poor little church? Rome have settled down there to a thousand years of dark age and and anything that didn't profess to be a Roman church was put on death immediately. Amen. Praise the Lord. That's under the second church age. Now the third beast that went forth that went out from the devil was this black her say see and the ter beast that went out a power from God to combat him to combat the power of the black horse was a man. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we realize here the man's anointing went out. [clears throat] Okay, that's right. So the man anointing went out and uh it was cunning. It was smart with the wisdom of God. Now that's that's that just where I want to get you get you to tonight because honor the man's anointing. You see what brother Brandham say was it was smart with the wisdom of God. You know a man is is is smarter than any of the beast. See he's he is smarter because he can outweight him mostly. He's coning his troll. See now so you will realize that it was under this age that the printing press started. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It was only at this age that they started writing the Bible. They started printing the Bible. So, so honor this age these people are responding to their age. So, honor the age man gets an idea to start the printing press. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it looks common but it is God's way of fortifying his church. WHY? BECAUSE NOW THE BIBLE IS GOING TO BE PRINTED. THE BIBLE IS GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DISTRIBUTED. And now the believers will have direct ACCESS TO THE WORD TO be able to stand against the Catholic doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. IF THE BIBLE WAS NOT PRINTED, THERE IS NO WAY THAT LUTHER will have come out against the Catholic Church to say the just shall live by faith &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHY? IT WAS JUST IN THE HANDS OF THE Catholic priest. &gt;&gt; He was just telling the church and in some places he read he reads in Latin &gt;&gt; when he don't even understand Latin. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He taught to read in Latin but never taught to understand what he's reading. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Man, brother there in in uh in uh uh uh I think St. Louis, uh, Missouri. Uh, brother brother James Miller's son, brother Tim, they have a they have a church there and, uh, they they are beginning to to to have lot of, uh, Amish people, &gt;&gt; lot of Amish people coming out of that movement. And now, why? Because they have got a hold of the Bible. Because the Bible that they are reading to them is in a old German language &gt;&gt; in an old German language. &gt;&gt; So whatever the man reads and tell you that's what it means, that's what you believe &gt;&gt; because you don't know how to read it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. a year now. These these Amish people uh uh one of one of the the the the man and his wife came to the meeting there in enforcement uh with uh brother Prader, brother Prader meeting. They drove down with uh uh brother Millers and his family and and you know Tim was testifying to me how you know they are having Bible studies and these people are just asking question. You can just see the hunger in them. It looks like they have been stabbed all of these years &gt;&gt; and now they are exposed to the Bible &gt;&gt; and now they are realizing that what they've been telling them in German is alive. &gt;&gt; So as much as IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS A PHYSICAL thing the opening of the printing press but that was God's way that was God's power that was the beast of the age. So the men of that age was responding. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you were if you will have good Bible literature, if you read books of of of of people from from that time, the the 18th century, you say, "Wow." Because you you you could tell that they were touching something. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He would you could tell that I mean like h Charles Lying the one that uh you know people uh uh since oh brother Brandon copy from here and and that that's the age that he came from. Praise the Lord. If you read your books I'm not a good reader but I have I love books. So I have I have them I have them and and and and I like when I get inside you you just see that oh my God. It was not the time for the opening of the word but those men were in the word &gt;&gt; because it is God that gives revelation. You don't get revelation by learning &gt;&gt; but you could tell that they were in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because I mean it will bring types and shadow out for you. You will say, "Oh my god. Oh my god." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'll stop right here and uh but what where I wanted to go with this is to allow us to see that uh the man's anointing the man's anointing Let's let's drop down and read read a little bit in our close here. That age from the dark age coming out to the dark age. Now the other side when this when this black house was riding when when they charge their their sacrifices and everything they done the money and money. Oh, you know that. Now the next thing that went out to combat death was the beast with the face of a man smart, educated, true, fine, anointed with that spirit of the dead. You notice it now. He went he went to combat with the holiness of God's wisdom. So first see it was the reformer zingling. all who are not scarving and and all of those men they were all under the the the man's anointing. So you see that's the reason why when they started their movement their movement started on the base of the word but when the men died they denominated &gt;&gt; and went back praise the Lord. So the man's anointing went all the way to Pentecost. The man's anointing went all the way to Pentecost. Went all the way to Laudishia. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will leave you right here tonight so when I pick it up, I'll be able to have enough comfort to pick up to go right into the ego's anointing because because you we will we will learn from the word that the eagle anointing really didn't start with uh uh uh the laudisha church age the ego's anointing started with 1963 the opening of the seal praise the Lord &gt;&gt; Amen. And the reason why I I want to bring this is because this will help you to understand that uh uh all of the things that we try to major major on our dress code and and all of those things you will realize that they will all stay still under the man's anointing. Baptism in Jesus name. It was not the opening of the seals that brought it. Pentecostal were baptizing in Jesus name. Believing one God. It was not the opening of the seals that brought it. Praise the Lord. So you see all of these things we we try to measure on and and and we think it is the message. We think it is the message. It's all under the man's anointing. The ego's anointing comes up to SHOW YOU YOUR PLACE IN GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT COMES TO SHOW YOU YOUR PLACE, YOUR PURPOSE, YOUR CALLING. IT HAVE TO DO WITH YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It it does not HAVE TO DO WITH YOU UH h obeying one certain doctrine BECAUSE ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT MEN that men try to make doctrine of they were all under the men's anointing. All of these men they held to those things strongly. Praise the Lord. Even till now some very good oness Pentecostal church you get there I mean those sisters uh from up down completely the Lord decent some of our sister will even look wall praise the lord &gt;&gt; so it is not in the dress code it is not in it I'm I'm I'm not playing on that I'm not saying because the revelation of the word you knowing your place in God &gt;&gt; you don't need a preacher to tell you to dress this &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you don't need a preacher &gt;&gt; and and and it's because of that &gt;&gt; that we have given ourself and giving a pit to people that come they just they just insult the bride &gt;&gt; when the bride supposed to be showing hopeless in the word &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; praise the Lord When brother Randon was honored the gift of an evangelist, he was out in the denomination calling calling the bride out. But where where is our evangelist? They are in they are in the bride. How can you evangelize the bride? How can you evangelize the bride? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; No, the bride don't need to be evangelized. The bride needs to be shown her position. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So in many in many sense in a very broad way we have gifts that are out OF PLACE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS THERE the as the people are shown their position. If uh if if an evangelist comes he has a gift and his gift is to rebuke sin. HIS GIFT IS TO CALL THE PEOPLE out but not in the pride. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is what is what what is what WHAT WHAT IS GOING TO happen is that he takes the pulpit. Now I'm not I'm not casting down on evangelism. No, you know we bring preachers through. I'm just trying to tell you &gt;&gt; where we are. &gt;&gt; Because a brother could come and he's anointed, he has a message, he can come and preach and before you realize you start looking for something in your life that is not there. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because that gift is rebuking sin. Is telling you clean your life. Is telling you check your life and then you goes back again when when actually you're supposed to be going forward. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Remember brother Brandham says when a bride find her place [snorts] &gt;&gt; the rapture we go. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the reason why when you watch many of the brothers, I've watched them, brother Dale Smith, brother brother Daryl Ward and many many many evangelists they comes to the pulpit they preach even like brother brother forest farmer that came and preached for us. You're listening to that message does not even looks like an evangelist preaching. Why? because their gift is responding to our position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the church is in the word, when the church is desiring to go higher, you create the demand WHAT THE PREACHER MUST PREACH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The preacher can come with his message. I'm going to blast this. You demand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just like you go you go over to the restaurant to eat. I DON'T FORCE you to eat to say look this is what I have. You have to eat it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, you tell me what you want to eat. &gt;&gt; It is MY DUTY TO GET BEHIND THERE and visit. &gt;&gt; Or else you say I I leave from here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't tell you say it's old meal we have for dinner. &gt;&gt; The old meal we have. &gt;&gt; You say I want steak. I say it's old meal that we have. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sit down and eat the old meal. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's the way we preachers we are. &gt;&gt; When the WHEN WHEN THE DESIRE in the people is to go up higher. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we say, "Let's come to fast and pray. LET'S FAST AND PRAY. LET FAST AND PRAY." &gt;&gt; NOW, be careful. I'm not &gt;&gt; I'm not kicking those things out of the church, &gt;&gt; but it is you &gt;&gt; that create the demand. &gt;&gt; It is your position &gt;&gt; where you are in your walk with God. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so the bride is responding to her anointing &gt;&gt; and she cannot do anything else. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is the same thing when this church is anointed with people that are praying and reading the word. &gt;&gt; Any preacher that comes behind here, &gt;&gt; he will have to respond to our anointing. &gt;&gt; You see the picture? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads and pray. Dear father, we just want to thank you tonight, Lord. Thought that Lord God, we must labor on this a little bit just to be able to help your people to grab the picture. Like I said, not being a teacher Lord, Father, I take these things into preaching, but Father God, uh, uh, coming over it and the second time and the third time, the people might grab it. It might get clearer today, Father. It might get clearer today. Brother Brandham told us, it's not the preacher that brings the revival to time. He said it's the people. He said it's the people that has the revival. So many times we have preachers, they come and preach, you say, "Oh, wow. I enjoyed that. I enjoyed the brother." Yeah. We enjoy him because he yielded to the Holy Ghost. But you are the one that create the atmosphere. You are the one that has the anointing. And [music] that's the reason why when we come to church, we are down. We are we are distracted [music] and and and uh we are not prayed up and we not ready for the word. We are now worshiping. You are dictating [music] how the service must go. Heavenly Father, precious Lord, we we just pray to God, Father Lord, as we say over over and over, Father God, Lord, we we want to labor for the atmosphere that work in this place where we come together. Father, Lord, we have our little children that needs the Holy Ghost. We have our young people that are dealing with peer pressure, Father God, and different things.
