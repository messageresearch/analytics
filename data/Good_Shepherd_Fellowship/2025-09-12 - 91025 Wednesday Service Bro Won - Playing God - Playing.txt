Let's take up a few prayer needs tonight and and just uh praise the Lord. What an awesome God we serve. Amen. We want to thank God for giving us this opportunity to be in the house of the Lord. And uh [Music] let's take this one u from uh our many prayer requests that came in the week. Hi s this came from sister Pam Canada. Uh she is asking prayer for her sister-in-law Penny. Penny call for prayer. About a month ago, Penny had a mini stroke. It didn't seems like any major damage was done. Just a tiny drop. And uh one eyes laid a few week later. However, her eyes laid shut and now it won't open on its own. She had she she had to hold it open to see out of that eye. Her vision in that eye is is damaged. The doctor says there is nothing they can do and it won't recover. Sister Pam encouraged her not to accept that and to believe God will heal her. Please pray for healing and restoration of that eye for his glory. Amen. Penny will know it uh was him since the doctor can heal. She has a family that depends on her greatly. God bless you. Amen. You see many of these uh prayer need comes in and sometimes uh I like to share them because it kind of uh uh encourage us. I don't know how prayer will prayer needs will encourage you but it it do encourage me because there is there in God's word many are the afflictions of the righteous. Praise the Lord. So we get to see that God's people everywhere is dealing with the same and I was just uh uh hearing my wife a little bit uh this evening uh similar condition uh sister Elizabeth had been having heaviness in her right leg and uh the doctors had drawn few option on her uh they wanted for her to take a shot. The shot is not working now she's wearing a brace and she was into a caterp thinks that she needs surgery in the legs or else she might be we chair bound and uh that's the doctor's report.

Let's stand on our feet tonight. Thank you, brother Ariel, sister, and uh Sister Joy. Thank you for the music. Brother James also uh thank you all for making sound to the Lord tonight. Second Thessalonians chapter 1. Praise the Lord. And um many of those uh uh or all of those uh young sisters that came out on u uh Sunday to watch their friend being baptized. They all came from a kiddo &gt;&gt; and a bunch of them had to work. So, uh, my long preaching was not favorable to them. Amen. But I think, uh, they enjoyed the service. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians chapter 1, let's read from verse one. Paul and uh Savinus and Timothy unto the church of Thessalonian which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ. Svenius is Silas. Paul and Silas that was in praising. Silas is just a nickname which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to God always for you all making mention of you in our prayers. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat while we continue to read. &gt;&gt; I love this when Paul says this. You find there he say the same thing in Romans chapter 1 verse 8 in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 16. making mention of you in our prayers. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank God always for you all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's a there's a phrase that I picked from brother Ben and I love he's always says let's give thanks. I love that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says uh the scripture says in all things we must give thanks. So he loved that phrase. Let's give thanks and make it part of my vocabulary. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank uh uh we give thanks to God always always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your works of faith, your labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ and in the sight of God and our father. Knowing brethren, beloved, your elections of God, for our gospel came not unto you in words only on it, but also in the power and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance, as ye know what manner of man we were among you for your sake. Praise the Lord. And ye became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost, so that ye were examples to all the believers in Macedonia and Asia. For from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia, in Asia, but also in every place. Your faith to God world is spread about. Amen. So that we need not to speak anything. Praise the Lord. Now uh uh let's just finish our our chapter here. That will be a good thing. For they himself showed Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Show of us what manner of uh entering in we have unto you and how ye turn to God from idols and serving the living and the true God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm out of script tonight. my my scripture reading actually should have come from second Thessalonians chapter one. So I'm completely out of straight. Amen. But uh you will see that uh Paul also in second Thessalonian he have uh uh Silas and Timothy with him as he write onto this church. uh by by a matter of fact is that uh uh the the the second Timothy letter. The second Timothy letter. If I can just if I can just go back and look at my uh my uh my notes here is that uh Paul wrote the second Timothy letter few months after he had sent that letter to first the the letter uh the first Timothy letter and like we said on Wednesday night the second Timothy letter came because there was uh you know uh some people that were inciting in the church that uh you know uh uh uh you know Paul have instructed them or they were calling the persecution that have come on the believers the tribulation. So the brothers started becoming a little bit troubled you know that if this is the tribulation because you will see in first Thessalonians chapter 4 that's where Paul talks about the rapture. Amen. He talks about the rapture in in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4. So if they are calling this persecution the tribulation then these believers are they are a little bit confused they a little bit concerned because as you will as you will see in uh uh uh as you will see in in second Thessalonian chapter in 2 Thessalonians chapter one Uh I thought I will I will pick this and u and share this with you. Praise the Lord. Okay, it's actually in chapter 2 verse 5 Paul will says here that remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things. So Paul has taught them. Paul has taught them and uh and and and let's let's look at it like this. Uh uh that these people were were were new believers but yet they were taught deep things of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there is there is really no time uh uh uh you know uh to to uh just be babying people around and and just be enduring with people you know uh uh that does not want to that does not want to change that does not want to submit to the word that does not want to grow in faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; No there is no time for that. These were uh young uh uh when you go back to the book of acts which of course we will go there uh I have a little subject I want to take from there. So uh I will carry you back to the whole history of this Thessalonian church a little bit. But yeah Paul is telling them remember that when I was with you I taught you these things. I taught you the sequence how things will happen. Why are you troubled? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why are you troubled? So tonight we back to our little subject on playing God. I did a whole lot of background on Sunday and I couldn't get to it and uh so we want to get there tonight. I have one quote that I want to share with you tonight is from question and answer 1959. Let's get to it and then we get right into our subject. Praise the Lord. Luke chapter 10 verse 18. He said unto them, Jesus speaking, I beheld Satan as lightning falling from heaven. See, Satan was the original arch angel. Uh he once dwared in heaven. He w uh he once was the greatest person in heavens outside of God. He was God right man to fellowship and he got puffed up in his heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Luke chapter 10 and the background again we read that again uh that was the beginning of the church just the beginning the believers have gone out to put the word into practice what Jesus taught them they came back rejoicing uh devils are healed and and and and Jesus say hey guys stay right there stay right there you know uh because I saw I I saw Satan falling you know uh uh uh through your prayers through your manifest estation through I saw him falling like a lightning but I would tell you it is not in those things that we rejoice we rejoice because our name is written in the book amen &gt;&gt; and and later on that's where you will see that one of the places where the Bible record Jesus praying the Bible says he lift his eyes and he said father I thank you &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; amen that's one of the place where you see Jesus praying the bible says he lift for his eyes up unto the Lord and you say, "Father, I thank you that you have hidden these things from the wise and the prudent, &gt;&gt; but you have revealed it unto the babies. &gt;&gt; You have revealed it unto these young ones." Amen. &gt;&gt; They are young in the faith, but yet they are now rejoicing in uh in in in heavenly authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, yeah. uh uh uh uh he was God right hand man to fellowship and he be and and he got puff up in his heart and isn't that just the way the people get today let God just bless a fellow &gt;&gt; and put a little confidence in him and he get to be a know it all &gt;&gt; he get to be he's got to start an organization or he got to do something that's different. Praise the Lord. Amen. God just gave him a little little confidence and then he ready to start a worldwide ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he starts to he want to do something different now. But uh uh as we as we as we continue to go here, why are thou falling from heaven? Now you see he's he's he's he's connecting Isaiah prophecy with with Jesus's vision. Jesus say, "I saw Satan falling." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah has already prophesied on a vision looking back to the beginning that why are thou falling from heaven? Oh Lucifer, like I've said that over and over year is that it's a dimension and that dimension is a falling dimension. &gt;&gt; You just keep falling. That's why the Bible call it the bottomless pit. There is no rest. You keep falling. You fall from one thing to another thing. You keep falling. You keep descending. You keep uh uh degrading and uh and on and on. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, how about that fallen old Lucifer? God has had a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that we stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God call him to do something. &gt;&gt; You believe there? See, &gt;&gt; a man that God can bless and he will still keep himself a man, &gt;&gt; not be an angel or a God. &gt;&gt; He won't be angel or he will not be playing God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He will not be playing God. That's one thing you can't play and survive. &gt;&gt; You can't play God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can play a manager. You can play uh uh you know in in the business world it says uh uh you know you got you got to think it. You got to dress it. So you dress like a million even though you don't have a dime. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You dress like a millionaire. You know you are always in suit. You know you you know you keep keep speaking money. you know, uh you make big promises and you know, uh uh uh uh you know, I'm I'm going to be you people a three-story church and uh you know, you just just keep speaking it, but you can play God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can play God. &gt;&gt; And and and the reason why I want to go down this line, I could preach this in an in a in an evangelistical way. I'm trying not to. I want to bring it to you uh uh uh as a church because the Bible says this in the book of uh proverb chapter 4. Let's look at proverb chapter 4. Proverb chapter 4. Let's look at that quickly. We'll come back to our quote. That's the only quote I have to read to you tonight. And uh I purposely did it like that so I will have uh uh a few time to just catch up on something because I'm setting the stage for something. Amen. Proverb chapter 4 is uh is uh a favorite verse here to many of us. Verse 23, the Bible says uh keep the heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there is one thing that we must guide &gt;&gt; is our heart. &gt;&gt; Why? Because your heart was built for a throne. &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not, something will sit on your heart. Something will rule your life. Something will rule from your throne. &gt;&gt; You have a throne. And whether you like it or not, something will sit. When a throne is made is made to be sat. Brother Brandham said, "A throne means a domain, a place of power. He that overcome will sit with me in my throne, even as I've overcome and sit down with the father in his throne is a place of domain, a place of power." And Solomon is saying here, "Guard your heart. Guard your heart." Because when when when when people sit on the throne, it's not so easy to get them off. &gt;&gt; When spirit sits on your heart, it's not so easy to get it out. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh uh guide your heart for out of faith because I mean I mean it it can be it can be so easy. It can be a religious spirit. It can be an arrogant spirit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It can be a a deceiving spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, uh, like he said, and we and and we want to take that, God has a hard time trying to get a man that he can deal with, that will stay humble, meek, and stay in the place until God God called him to do something. Do you believe that a man that God can bless and he will still keep himself a man not be an angel or a god? As soon as man get blessed and has a little something given to him, he want to become a god. He want to be a god. And you have to know that that that was that was the offer that was given to our mother Eve. You will be like God. And Satan robbed her from her deity. She was a daughter of God. Came right from the hands of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When he made man in his image, he made man male and female. She was an express image of God. But yet the devil talked her out of that place. &gt;&gt; Instead of being God, he wanted her to play God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Instead of being God, he want us to play God. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's that's where we going with this thought to h uh tonight or uh as long as we'll be on it. As soon as a man get blessed and has a little something given to him, he want to become a god, he want to become an angel, he want to become a great person, me my all that. That's the wrong attitude. God hunting for somebody who he can bless and pour out the blessing. And the more he's blessed, the little the man will become. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you want to be like that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray that the Lord make me like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; The more that he bless us, the little we'll become. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The more he bless us, the more service we will give. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But as soon as people start being blessed, then they want people to give them service. They feel now that you know they must they are the one now that must be that must be treated. You know I was talking with my friend there uh in uh uh uh uh uh South Africa and we were just talking there and I told him I says I I I don't understand these things you know uh uh uh look at kale at at at 80 years old. He says uh my strength is just as the same as that day when uh when when when Moses called Joshua and myself. He said my strength is still the same. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The more he was he was in age, the more he was strong to fight the same fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the more we grow, you find people, you know, I was I was talking to him. My sister, you you find that you know uh the word oldtimer is not a bad word but when when people make oldtimer to be a word to take h to retire on god then that's a bad word. &gt;&gt; You being an old-timer does not send you into retirement. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. We've been around this message. You know we are old-timers. You know, we have put our sheer in and you you you you are backsliding. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The more old you go, you be just like Caleb. I I I let your strength be renewed &gt;&gt; to be able to put into God's service just like the first day you got saved. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you find that you uh uh you know people we we do that we think that okay yeah you know uh uh we being around here now all of these newcomers is their time to self and what what you're doing there is that uh you you you you are breaking down that that strong protection because when God raised up people h just let me let me just come home with this people that have known the history of this church people that have known you know the things that we have gone through here and not people that are supposed to lay back are people that supposed to be standing and fighting every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because just like I said, as long as Jesus starting, if you don't bless us with a new church, we will still right here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're doing the best that we can in every We were still right here. I mean, there's not a lot of pressure on us to get out of here, you know. We were still right here. Your children are growing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. In in few years if Jesus start there will be a change of generation. All of these little ones uh you know that we dedicate right from this pull pit will now be going to college and we'll be talking about their wedding and and and and it's it's a complete h you know but uh uh uh uh uh God want people that can be able to hold the values. as uh as as a young generation come up, they will see their parents standing with the word. They will see their people in church, you know, worshiping the Lord, singing special. That's the thing that uh you know that that that sustain the future generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the thing that sustain the future generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Being an old-timer there is no it's not a word to go retired on God. &gt;&gt; You know the brother was telling me there one time you know the brother was preaching. He said we we are oldtimes you know that brother you know he's preaching he's taking too many time and this guy is sleeping in church. You are old-timers. So now you can sleep because you know everything. There's nothing there. There's nothing can be preached that you have not heard. It's just the devil way of making you a religious backslider creep. &gt;&gt; Amen. And pretty soon you just start criticizing and condemning everything that people do &gt;&gt; because you are an oldtimer. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Let God start to bless him and pretty soon he start playing God. He want he he he want to be saved uh uh you know uh uh uh and then uh uh he become a highmaintenance person because uh this one is not good and that one is not good and I don't like this and I don't like that and pretty soon we don't even like you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because if we can't help you then we don't need you. And I'm I'm I'm saying that uh as uh you know if we can't help you then we don't need you because because we are we are called here to help one another. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You will not be a blessing to us if we can't help you. You are not a blessing to us if you can't help us either. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see here Solomon says God he says he says here God guide your heart guide your heart guide your heart you realize here is that Jesus was the first one Jesus was the first one that that that that introduced the subject of uh uh uh speaking to our body as a temple. St. John chapter 2, he said, "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up." Now, because the Jews have never had an idea when they talk about temple, it was a physical building. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They look at the temple as a physical building. So they thought, I mean, how rude can he be? In three days this temple was built in 40 plus years. You say in three days you will raise it up. &gt;&gt; But there the Bible say he speaks of himself. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he was referring to his body as the temple of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was referring to his body as the temple of God. So Paul comes on now. He picks that up and say ye are the temple of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he see he see that he he he got converted. Now he's out of Judaism. The skills had dropped from his eyes. Now he has a revelation that the God that dwell behind the curtains now he's dwelling in the heart of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When he got the revelation that Jesus was God, he got the revelation that Jesus was the tabernacle of God, then he understood that God is also tabernacling himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like how his fullness was in Jesus. He he he's he's pouring himself out in his people by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Jesus says, "Destroy this temple. Three days I will build it." Paul picked that up as a revelation. He understood it &gt;&gt; that Jesus was just a temple. He was just a dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Knowing that you yourself, you are &gt;&gt; a temple of God." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are a temple of the living God. The reason why you were made, the reason why God made you &gt;&gt; was for expression. &gt;&gt; Hebrew chapter 1, the Bible called Jesus the express image. &gt;&gt; So when God made man, he made us to express himself through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because h if if he he had the attribute of a healer. Let me not say if because that that would not be the good English to speak. Amen. He has the attribute of a healer and then uh there is no way that he can manifest that healing until he express it through our sickness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So when I get sick and he express his healing virtue through me, then his attribute of a healer is known. &gt;&gt; So the only reason why we are made is not to to show up ourself and rule one another. We are all made as an expression. &gt;&gt; God want to express himself through us from the day that we were born to the day we go to the grave or the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Bible says we are made for his pleasure. What is that pleasure? Expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are made for expression. And how can God express himself through us unless he's sitting on the throne of our heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God is sitting on the throne of your heart, you are not playing God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You become God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Because it's deity in you. &gt;&gt; You are not playing God. &gt;&gt; But if God is not sitting on the throne of your heart, &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, you will go in and out of playing God. You play God to yourself. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime you are the God of mercy. Sometime you are the God of judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; So we see here that uh uh this this church like I said on Sunday was the first first church that that really got that they got a weight. We we we know that at the beginning Paul and Silas they were whipped but you see they were not whipped by the Roman they were whipped by the Sanhedrin's council. So it was the church, the Sanhedrin's council that were trying to stop uh Peter and John for speaking in his name. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But what what these people experienced here uh uh Paul and Silas and and all of these men that was in prison this this time it was under the Roman government. &gt;&gt; Christianity was spraying out. The lion's anointing was moving and and and converting the hearts of men. and the empire become threatening because people were speaking more of the name of Jesus. History even tell there was a plague that came in Rome and when the plague came in Rome it was only where the Christians are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and the people they started they started spreading gossip and what they said is that the Christians you know they they they you know the Bible says that the Pharisees sold that story to them it says that you know they they they took Jesus body from the grave and that's why they are eating &gt;&gt; that's why they are not getting sick &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; because every every time the year said this is my body you know we are blessing that my blood, you know. So they said, you know, that that that was how they were spoiling the minds. They were spoiling the minds of the people against the Christians. &gt;&gt; But more but more people were sneaking in and glory to the Christians to be prayful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That was one of the thing that that that uh that that that make the the Roman Empire uh uh furious against the Christian church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it looks like that's a name that is now moving among the people. &gt;&gt; They're no longer talking about the Empire Caesar. I keep hearing Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And pretty soon the church came on under the spotlight of hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; Honor the spotlight of hell. And then can can you imagine all of these people stay young in their faith? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That that that fresh zeal. You just think about the the the time you got converted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The time you got converted and and and and and God became real to you. That fresh zeal is the zeal where you are ready to die for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You read you read the gospel and you hear what he went through and the price that he paid and the suffering that he had. You you says, "I'm I'm I'm ready. I'm ready now." &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; But the thing that was troubling the church was not it was not the persecution itself but the way that it was interpreted. Now if we have missed the rapture why why then should we be persecuted. That's that's the way the believers were thinking. If we have missed the rapture, then it's just better let's just go back to the word. Because if this is the tribulation and we have missed the rapture according to what Paul has taught us, it's either we seal our life with our testimony. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or let's just go back to the word because we have lost our reward. So that that was the thing that was troubling these people here. So Paul now has to come back and and then and re-echo quickly write them. He he quickly wrote this this letter uh uh uh called second Timothy. We see only have three chapters there and and then if you if you if you read the three chapter you see how how he he uh he he enforced certain things &gt;&gt; to the brethren. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He he make them to understand. Chapter two. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the coming of the Lord Jesus. That's 2 Thessalonians chapter 2. That's what we read from on Sunday. And by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in your mind or be troubled, neither in your spirit nor by words or a letter as from us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine somebody going around and say they get a letter from Paul? Oh, he gave me in a private letter when I was having lunch with him. He wrote this thing privately. I kept it in my Bible. The same thing men has done. &gt;&gt; And they have built doctrine around this message. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I was hunting with brother Brandon. He told me this. I was hunting I mean uh what is so special that he can tell you that he cannot say from the back of the pit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now he's he's telling these people not not even letter from us. Don't don't don't don't don't even accept it that anybody say they get some kind of a special letter that they've been keeping in their Bible. Let no man deceive you by any means for that day for that day shall not come. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For that day shall not come. Which day? the day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The day of the Lord. Uh I hope I'll be able to find find a a place here and and go into that a little bit and and just and just and just tell you because even when it comes to the church age book when brother Brandham talks on the day of the Lord and the Lord's day uh uh many people get it confused and they think it's two different time. No, it's the same. When Paul says, "I was in the spirit in the Lord's day," it is just the same as the date of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Which of course you go right through all the Bible, the date of the Lord is the day of judgment. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we'll find time and go into that. Love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so he says uh nobody must bother you about that day for that day shall not come except that there come a falling away first there come a falling away and the man of sin be revealed the son of pedition. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The man of sin be revealed the son of pedition. Now, so we see we see all of that. We see all of that. Uh uh uh. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was called the son of life, the prince of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here the scripture is now referring to a man that will be called the son of pedition. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A son of waste, son of uh uh damnation. All of that goes. Then the Bible says here that son of pedition who upholdeth and exalted himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God seated in the temple of God. Now so this is a prophecy like like I said on on Sunday uh the powers are gathering. Amen. &gt;&gt; The powers are gathering. the the the anointing that is leading the church is gathering to take the church in the rapture and all the evil powers that is waring against the church is also gathering and it will come to a climax. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the believer, it will come to a climax word that all that power will be gathered in a group of people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Called the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will have there there will be a messenger. That's the reason why St. Luke 17:30 identified a ministry that is called the son of man. Jesus said in the day where the son of man is being revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is the son of man? Is the gathering of that power that anointing in in one ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it's is it's is also going to endure in a people. And then we see here also on this side uh there is there is also a gathering you know of power that that is going to get into one man uh uh uh uh uh called the antichrist and is also going to possess a group of people that will be on the road in the leadership of that man. Praise the Lord. But here is where I want to go. Here is where I want to labor if I just would take a few minutes here and and work with you. Now, seeing here, see see what Paul says. He uh uh uh uh uh he opposite, he exalted above all that is called God, all that is worship. So that he as God sitted in the temple showing himself that he is God. He said, "Remember ye not that when I was with you, I told you these things. &gt;&gt; And now ye know what that he might be revealed." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; For that fullness to come, there is something that is stopping it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this is where the catch is for our our our our subject. For the mystery of iniquity does already work. It's already working. It has not come to a fullness in a man yet, but it's among us. &gt;&gt; And if it's ammon, sorry. If it's ammon, what does it want to do? Go back. It want to oppose and exalt himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; A spirit that is among us want to oppose and exalt himself above all that is called God. That spirit want to be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It want to be worshiped. And uh he want to sit in the temple. He want to sit in your temple. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your body that's supposed to be a temple of the living God. That spirit want to sit in your temple &gt;&gt; and make you worship him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And make you worship him. You know, brother Brian was asked if Jesus is God, then who was he praying to? He says it was Jesus subjecting &gt;&gt; this body to deity. &gt;&gt; To the deity that was in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was submitting his human will &gt;&gt; to the deity that was in him. And that is the Christian life. And that is where the greater battle is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is is is is you subjecting yourself, humbling yourself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not feeling like you know better than somebody or you more spiritual than somebody. &gt;&gt; No, it's you constantly bringing yourself subject. Not my will, Lord, but your will be done. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Not my desire, but what you desire to work in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the Christian life is. That's where the greater battle is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're not ready to fight that, I get a good I get a a good news. It might be a bad one, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. is that you already have a God on your throne &gt;&gt; that you are worshiping. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was Habacu that says the Lord is in his holy temple. Let the earth keep silence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord the word when it gets there every every element of your body keeps silence. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the word is ruling your life, &gt;&gt; whether it's a thought, whether it's a feeling, if it is not of God, it keep silent. &gt;&gt; It don't have a voice in your body. &gt;&gt; If it's a sickness, it don't have a voice in your body because the Lord is in his holy temple. &gt;&gt; Let this earth &gt;&gt; keep silent. &gt;&gt; Let this earth come to obedience. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's when you have the the the Lord uh uh on the throne of your heart. It's when you have the word on the throne of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But until we do that, &gt;&gt; there will always be something that will be exalting itself in our lives. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil would never come as the devil to exalt himself. He tried that. &gt;&gt; He tried that. In Isaiah, the Bible says he tried. He says, "I will exalt myself." And right away, he was cast down. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So, he never come again and and and and say, "I will exalt myself." But you know how he comes? &gt;&gt; He comes and says, "I'm your pastor. Without me, you can't go to heaven." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So, he takes a man and and and and he exalts that man in your life. You become so fearful of that man more than being fearful of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes is run even run their home. I'm your father. I born you. &gt;&gt; No, you must understand that you are just a steward. &gt;&gt; God sent a son of God through you. He sent a daughter of God through you. They are not your property. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. When we do that, we are playing God &gt;&gt; in the lives of our children. &gt;&gt; That must not be a language &gt;&gt; to use. I'm your father. I born you. They don't know that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then we are we we are exalting ourself. &gt;&gt; They already carrying your name. They should know better. You didn't buy them from from Walmart. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see, you see this place of playing God. You see this place of playing God is something that is so is so is so evil. Evil so simple and and and and then we we can we can go in that place so easily. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so yeah, Paul is saying here that the that that mystery of iniquity does already work. Already work. Knowing what is what is good and and and and failing to do it. Praise the Lord. Knowing what what is right. We know that we must not exalt ourself over one another. &gt;&gt; That's why the word of God said we must encourage one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; But because it's a spirit that is already working, the devil will not come and says, "I want to exalt myself." No. He will either use somebody. He will either come through a religious spirit or he will come through something that would take the dominance over your heart. Something that you will tremble at &gt;&gt; and even trembling at the word of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When we get to the place where I mean h we we we we we we we tremble at our job as as if our life depend on it. No, your life depend on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It does not depend on on a job. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It depend on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let the job play God in your life. &gt;&gt; Nothing must play God because you already have a living God. He's real. his truth to you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing where I'm going with this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you must guide your heart. That's what issue life. &gt;&gt; Anything that conquer your heart conquers your entire body. Your heart is your throne. &gt;&gt; When the throne is conquered, the entire h city is subject. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. That's why you see the uh uh in a time of wars uh uh uh the rebelling force they don't they don't go to the marketplace where they are targeting they are targeting the throne they want to get to where the leader is where the president is &gt;&gt; the moment they get there even if it is there for one minute they can tell you says I'm your president &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; you say in the marketplace they will not believe it you know the devil can blast your mind and and you you know trouble your mind, speak lies to your mind, speak fears to your mind, you can you can you can fight through that that will not conquer you. But when he take when that thought resides on your heart, &gt;&gt; when fear now resides on your heart, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That fear that is dwelling on your heart start creating voices. &gt;&gt; You start hearing voices of fear is coming right from your heart. It's not coming from the kitchen. It's not coming from the ceiling. Don't look for it. It's not there. It's coming right from your heart because a spirit of fear has captured you. &gt;&gt; That's that's the that's where sometime people get on a a a spirit of delusion. We'll get to that. Yeah. Paul also identify that in the scripture to the believer. Strong delusion. &gt;&gt; Believing in a lie. &gt;&gt; But that lie is covered with a religious spirit. Are we together? &gt;&gt; We're not called to play God. We are called to be gods. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus says them that the word of God come to is it not written in your word that they are Gods. Praise the Lord. And if you have received the word of God for this age, you have received the word of God for this hour, &gt;&gt; that word is calling you up, &gt;&gt; to the to to the the the place of power and potential so you can take your your position as a son of God. Just like an Adam, you can speak to little things in your life. &gt;&gt; You can speak to little things in your mind. &gt;&gt; You can speak to little circumstances around you and little by little, your faith starts to grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because that word is sitting on your heart. &gt;&gt; You are getting command from the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are getting command from the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's great. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If not, the devil will keep playing God in our lives. He will keep playing God. He knew that it it would not happen if he says I will exalt myself. He know that it will not happen. The angels threw him out. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now he says well now so I will go among the people. I won't use my voice. I will use their own voices in their head. I will use their own voices and I will rule them. I will be God in their life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They will take their time to go to church. to stay right in the church and they worship me the devil. &gt;&gt; They are far away from the living God. They are far away from the worship of the true God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because all that will be ringing in their mind, oh, I need to go to church before I go to hell. &gt;&gt; He will put that fear on them. I need to go to church before I go to hell. No, you don't need to come to church to go to hell &gt;&gt; or to stop you from going to hell. We come to church to fellowship. We come to church to enter in. &gt;&gt; Enter in fellowship around the word. &gt;&gt; All the word you've been reading from the beginning of the week. All your prayers, bring it together. Let's fellowship. Let the Holy Spirit be speaking from the pit and in your heart. You say, "Yeah, I read that in the scripture. Oh, glory be to God. Thank you, Jesus." That's that's what that's what the service is about. &gt;&gt; It's not for you to sit down and then one man just be shouting. No. is to draw us into fellowship &gt;&gt; so we can be rejoicing in the promise &gt;&gt; I always had a question about that but the Lord spoke to me today he answered my question thank you Jesus &gt;&gt; then church don't become a d place church become an exciting place to go because I know God is going to speak to me &gt;&gt; I know he's going to speak to me &gt;&gt; if I have an answer question on my heart, I know exactly where to go. &gt;&gt; Because if I if I if I just stay there a little while, if I just paid attention, if I just enter in, he will call my name, he will say something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The world will come alive. &gt;&gt; But we have just make this thing. We uh the devil, that's why brother Brian preached the message s on Eden. The message s on Eden. That's that's exactly what he preached. The devil has played God &gt;&gt; and the world is worshiping him as God. &gt;&gt; He has played God in our lives. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When we all realize that we are all saved by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's only by his grace that we are saved. &gt;&gt; And if we are saved by the grace of God, &gt;&gt; if that grace was enough to pick you up, that same grace can save a sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen.
