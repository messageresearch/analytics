========================================

but until then we have to wonder about the source of the tongues you can see right now that if you back up a tongue's evidence and don't know what is being said you have to finally come to the place where all tongues have to be of god that would lead us then to believe that the devil cannot speak in tongues that is not so no not for a minute any true missionary on a foreign field knows only too well that devils speak in other tongues the same as i know it by experience pentecostal theologians admit that they have no scripture setting forth that people speak with tongues when baptized by the holy ghost they admit that they infer it from the experiences set forth in the book of acts wherein three out of five times the people spoke with tongues and they also say without any scripture that there are two kinds of tongues one is the tongue you speak in while receiving the holy ghost and it is the evidence while later on if you believe you can receive the gift of tongues whereby you may speak often however they say once having spoken in tongues as the evidence of receiving you may never speak again once more we are anxious to know where this is found in the word if it isn't there then god hath not spoken it and woe unto him who would add to that word but there is something in the word about this very subject that they ignore completely first corinthians 13 it mentions tongues of men and angels these would be known and unknown tongues modern pentecostals say that they can receive the holy ghost speaking in unknown or angelic tongues they have the cart before the horse for in acts 2 the people spoke in a perfect dialect which even unbelievers heard and understood now when god is silent we had better be silent but where he has spoken we had better speak to and say what he has already said he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the holy ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of paul those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word received it and lived by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin in every age and every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer i say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it i know it is a great temptation to refer back to the day of pentecost and also to the day when the holy ghost fell in the house of cornelius and then set those two identical experiences as the evidence of the baptism with the holy ghost but on each occasion the tongues were understood by the listeners this is a far cry from the modern babble of confusion of pentecostal meetings and if this were not enough to persuade us to leave off such reasoning what will we do when we are confronted with the fact that people who have never spoken in tongues have some of the other eight manifestations in their lives such as word of wisdom the discerning of spirits a word of knowledge faith healing and even miracles and this observation is even more interesting in the light that tongues is the least of the nine gifts so when we see people who do not nor ever have spoken in tongues use greater gifts than those who do speak in tongues we must discount such a doctrine even more completely than before so you can see now that we cannot afford to say what the bible has not said when scripture teaches us that the work of the holy spirit and the manifestation of that blessed person is to bring the truth of each age to the true seed of that age then we know that the spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive the truth for that time amen that is exactly correct and if these ages bring out anything they surely bring and bear out this truth now before we leave this subject i want to make myself very clear on what the baptism with the holy ghost is according to the word it is not according to me and it is not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the lord or we are falsely led amen to begin with you will notice that in my meetings when i have finished preaching an evangelistic service or some teaching message i cast the net and invite a response from the people i ask them to come forward and receive the holy spirit my pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that i am inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the holy ghost because they are already born again so when i invite those who are spirit-filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such manner as to encourage them to yield to god and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and i want to tell you exactly what i mean i mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of christ by the holy ghost which is exactly what took place at pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the holy ghost it is one in the same now i realize that it is going to be confusing for a moment here as most people know that i was ordained a baptist preacher and i have steadfastly declared that the baptists have missed it for saying you receive the holy ghost when you believe for that is not so you receive him since you believed acts 19 2-6 he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since he believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto john's baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied there it is paul asked have you received since not when you believed and there is a great difference there for it is after we believe that we receive ephesians 1 13 is an exact word repeat of what happened in ephesus according to acts 19 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed not when ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise now here is my point too many of our modernists and even our fundamentalists so called believe unto salvation at a certain specific time which in many cases is called making a decision and that has been called receiving christ or being born again now to receive christ is to receive his spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the holy ghost amen these folks believe that is wonderful but they stop there you receive the holy ghost after you believe it has always been that way and always will be the very first word of direction to the people was by peter at pentecost and he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call these directions came as a direct answer from peter relative to what had actually happened at pentecost what came to pass was that god according to joel was pouring out the promised holy spirit upon all flesh he was not poured out before that time or given before that time this was it but this was to come from now on by repenting being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and then god was duty bound to fill the ones who came peter or any of the apostles never said ye must be born again and then filled with the spirit that this is the pattern of experience relative to receiving the holy spirit note carefully the very next time that the spirit fell upon a people acts 8 5-17 then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that city but there was a certain man called simon which before time in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wandered beholding the miracles and signs which were done now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost according to verse 12 they believed the word they were then baptized in the name of the lord jesus but according to verse 16 in spite of all that they had still not received the holy spirit it was only after believing and being baptized correctly but they received the holy ghost that is the exact pattern is set forth by peter in acts 2 38-39 another scripture that casts wondrous light on this is found in galatians 3 13-14 cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ but in order that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith now by no means can it be said that the blessing of abraham is the rebirth and that the promise of the spirit is the baptism with the holy ghost as two separate events for the scripture reads thus jesus died on the cross and by means of that death and resurrection the blessing of abraham came on the gentiles leaving the jews this transpired in order that the spirit might become available to the gentiles to understand what i have just said is to clear up why students have never ever found paul saying at any time be born again and then be spirit filled they have inferred it is there and they have put their own meanings to make it say it but scripture does not say that jesus never said it either look at john 7 37-39 and read it now with understanding in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified now it says here distinctly and emphatically that the believer upon drinking by coming unto jesus in faith would have rivers of living waters pouring out of him and it places this experience at pentecost now keeping this thought in mind we read john 4 10 and 14 if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldst have asked of him and he would have given thee living water but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life this same living water is mentioned but this time it is not called a river it is called an artesian well there is where the people make their mistake because it is called a well and a river they think that in one place it is eternal life given by the spirit and in the next place where it is called a river implying a great dynamism it has to be the spirit now given as an endowment of power not so it is one and the same it is the spirit that gives life and power and that came at pentecost what is it that caused this misunderstanding the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not the word away with experience as your measuring line there is only one plumb line only one rod and that is the word now watch carefully and get this peter said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost paul said have you received the holy ghost since he believed this is the whole of our problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in water but they don't go on and receive the holy ghost you believe unto receiving the spirit believing on jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the holy ghost but the people stop there they go as far as water and then stop they believe and then stop the bible does not say that you receive when you believe it is have you received the holy ghost since you believed the exact and literal translation is did ye having previously believed receive the holy ghost the people believe and then stop you don't receive the holy ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the holy ghost do you see it that is what is wrong with our fundamentalists they have no power for they stop short of pentecost they are like the children of israel who came out of egypt and stopped short of the promised land now those children of israel left egypt about 2 million strong they all journeyed together all saw the same miracles of god all partook of the same manna and water from the smitten rock all followed the same cloud by day in the pillar of fire by night but only two reached the promised land only two were true or real believers that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter in hebrews 3 19 then since that is so and only two entered then the rest were not true believers what made the difference two stayed with the word when the hearts of the ten spies failed at kedesh barnia joshua and caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more than able to take the land they knew they could because god had said i have given you the land after all those israelites saw of the power and goodness and deliverance of god they did not enter into rest which is a type of the holy ghost so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of god all right we have come this far now i want to go further and when i do i know i am going to cause some emotions to rise but that is something i am not responsible for i am responsible to god and his word and the people god has sent me to i have to be faithful in all he gives me to say in john 6 37 and 44 it says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i shall in no wise cast out no man can come to me except the father draw him and i will raise him up at the last day john 1 12-13 but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god ephesians 1 4 through 5 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us onto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now without getting too involved in the subject of sovereignty of god for that would take a book in itself let me point out here that according to these verses jesus christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their brides today the bride today does not simply decide she is going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride john 15 16 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you now according to the word of god the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself ephesians 1 9 and in romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of god according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of stardust before god was god god is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially god and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of god they are eternal are they not the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see this you will see many things god is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as god must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is god thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of god see how this works god always had his thoughts for adam adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed psalm 139 15-16 will give you a little idea of this my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book were all my members written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there were none of them that as i said was not written about adam but it gives you the idea and knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed so when adam was formed of the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by god then adam became god's thought expressed and those eternal thoughts were now manifested down through the centuries we could go we find a moses a jeremiah a john the baptist and each one of these were god's eternal thought expressed in its season then we come to jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be now it says that he has chosen us in him jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of god before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that let me inject a thought in here even our natural birth is based upon election the female ovaries produce many many eggs but why is it that at a certain time a certain egg comes down and not another one and then amongst the male sperm for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to the egg while others that could have just as easily attached themselves or had a better opportunity to do so did not do so and perished there is an intelligence behind all this otherwise what determines whether the baby is a boy or girl blonde or brunette light or dark type of eyes etc with these thoughts in mind think about joshua and caleb did not jesus say in john 6 49 your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead those parents that died were necessary as the forefathers of the people to whom jesus was speaking they perished yet they were in the election of god naturally as joshua and caleb were spiritually but to go on these elect were not only the eternal thoughts of god which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these same elect are called by another name romans 4 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all romans 9 7-13 neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all the children but in isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son and not only this but when rebecca had also conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated galatians 3 16 now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ galatians 3 29 and if ye be christ's then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise according to romans 4 16 we find that god has given a sure promise to all of abraham's seed and paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he says abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it for in galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promise as having to do with election or the choosing of god and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed are the elect of god are the predestinated foreknown of god and were in the mind of god and his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god in a many membered body or as once god was manifested in one member even our lord jesus christ now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many-membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to quicken hold this carefully in mind now take the next step [Music] you
