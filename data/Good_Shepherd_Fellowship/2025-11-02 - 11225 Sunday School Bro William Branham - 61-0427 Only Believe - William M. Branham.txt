TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God has given you so together we can serve the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so happy today on the private interviews how the Lord done some great things and I just so thankful about it. And now uh tomorrow night uh tomorrow is Friday. I was thinking tomorrow was Saturday. We won't won't forget the businessman's breakfast will be held here, I believe, at this school. And I suppose they sell tickets for them, don't they? and they I guess everyone understands just how you get the u the tickets and so forth for the breakfast. We'd be happy if you could come along and see uh feel led to come. Now uh Billy always tells me he said there's one thing that you do, Daddy, is wear the people out. They're wore out any house. They've been sitting there for hours. He preached so long and I said, "Well, son, I'm going to try to make it in Chicago meeting." I said, "I'm going to set my watch at every 20 minutes and then when it alarms, I'm going to quit right then and call the prayer home." He said, [music] "Uh, you might as well not set it because it go, you know, it went off two or three times and just alarmed itself down. I never did. I'm making so much noise up here. I didn't even hear it when it went off." And so I I just have to um just uh I hope I don't bore you, you know. I don't I don't come here for that. I I come and I love him so much and know we've got so much that ought to be done right at this time and I just try to push too much of it in one night. You see, and not knowing just what time that we're going to be called away. And then I think, well, I don't know what time I'm going to be called away. And none of us know that. And so we just might as well do what we can while we can do it. I've heard my mother. I never was at a dance in my life, but I heard only a holy dance one time in church. I [music] never forget that when we were still a Baptist church, I would always criticize and kind of in my heart I wouldn't say it out loud because I I'd be afraid to do that anything that God does. I always kind of thought it was kind of strange [music] to see I seen first got acquainted with the Pentecostal people see them dance you know dance around I thought now you know that ain't in the Bible what what are they dancing about and then one night I was teaching from a chart on Daniel and Revelations. It was New Year's night. I was going to uh teach on the chart until midnight. wasn't a chart like a blackboard. I was teaching and and there was a some Pentecostal people had come from Louisville. They had a oh some sisters a sister pastored a church over there and she had a they had washboards and thimbles and and all kinds of little things to make rackets with and and they uh all got it harmonizing some way. I don't know what it was. And they and she started playing the pen and all these girls up there got to hit them with these thimbles on washboards and things and and they they got this playing that song. There's going to be a meeting in the air and the sweet by and by or something. Well, that little girl that was playing little lady [music] pastor, she just turned white all just like a chalk [music] and she just began to uh playing it in such a way I don't I never seen anything play like it in my life. And I thought, now what's that? And then one on the washboard, she got to doing the same thing. Then your two or three got up and a little blonde head got to dancing right in the floor. Oh my. Right up and down the floor as hard as she could go just dancing away like that little old girl about 16, 18 years old. I was just a young fellow myself. And I now isn't that something right here in my church. How I'll ever live that down. I'm watching her like that now. Why do they do that for? Why they have to do that? Why couldn't they just played their [music] music and went on and let it alone like that? I thought, well, that's terrible. I got thinking now in the Bible, is there such a thing as dancing? And I remember that David danced around the ark when he saw the ark coming. See, he danced before the Lord. And the Lord said, "He's a man after my own heart." I thought, "Well, now that's he what did he dance for?" Well, they had a victory and Miam when they crossed over the Red Sea, Moses sang in the spirit and Miriam took a tambourine and began to beat it and they went down along the bank, all the daughters of Israel dancing in the spirit. And I seen that dancing was when they had victory. I thought got thinking, well, maybe I haven't got victory enough. Think I got thinking about it. You know, after a while, I got to pat my foot and before I noticed, I was out there dancing with that girl. I was Mark then. I could just see the expression on those people's face yet seeing their past on the floor. This that little girl dancing around here. I was right out there, too. I never was on a dance floor in my life, but I'd have to take it back and say it was on that one. But that was a church what were so when we uh you know all the devil's got he he he copied it after some real thing that God's got you know just exactly the devil cannot create he's just a perverter of what's been created you see so he cannot create he's not a creator he's a perverter what is what is unrighteousness is righteousness perverted see it's uh legal for a man to take a wife and and be a uh a husband to her and family relationship but the same woman another woman [music] on the same act condemn him and send his soul away. See it's wrong. What is it? Righteousness perverted. See the truth is always right. What is a lie is the truth perverted. See makes a lie. So that's way all sin is is righteousness perverted. So when I used to hear my mother say she used to go to dances the old her and daddy on them kind of see him they had the old fiddler would come and stand on the corner and play the fiddle and them Kentucky people and pop he didn't have any money you know you're supposed to have a little money to jangle your pockets and I see him go out the ke get some nails put them in his pockets you know and dance around here and mama they'd win prizes I can see her pull a skirt out like this you know that jig dance you know right around around one another like that I'd see Pop. I thought [music] that's that's bad. Pop. That's nails. That's not money. See, I know he didn't have any money. He had some nails in his pocket jingling up and down like that. See? And they do that come on till around daylight. And some of the people leave home the all the old Kentucky people come over and they'd have the dances from one house to the other. And then [music] they go home of a morning packing their shoes in their hands because their feet was so sore from dancing. Well, if you can do that for the devil, then why not stay and let's preach all night and let's praise God and get in the spirit and see. Sure, if that if that's for eternal separation, what about eternal life? Let's we can appreciate this as much more than we should that of course. But Satan would wear us out on this right quicker. Tell us who's too tired. But I tell you, he's had an awful time with me. He wore out on it. I remember when I was healed of stomach trouble, he Satan said, "Well, you better not eat." Said, "Because the doctor said if you eat, you die. You had an ulcered stomach." And said, "It's just one big bloody ulcer." But the Lord said he healed me. So, I had to take somebody's word. So, I I took God's word. And so, oh, I'd like to burn me up. I would just hot water run down my mouth. And so, two or three days, I was going around holding my stomach like this. Said, "How you feeling, Mr. Brandom?" I said, "Oh, I feel fine." tamping away like that. Someone said, "You lied." I did not. I was making a confession. Confess means say the same thing. By his stripes, I was healed. So that's that does it. See, I was making confession. And so Satan said to me, said, "You're bringing reproach." I said, "Now look at here." Oh, if you enjoy hearing me testify, you [music] stick around. But if you don't, you might as well get away. I'm going to testify anyhow. So that's it. You just got to let him know what side you're standing on and then make her stand and then stand. And that's just the way we got to do always is get where we know that we're right and then got faith in that. You can't have faith unless you know you're right. Don't you try to do that to bluff him now. He won't take your bluff. See, don't bluff him. But when you really believe that you're not bluffing, then something's already witnessed to you. Then you then you're right. I don't care. You might not No one never lay hands on you. You might not never hear uh anything, but just as long as something has confirmed it in your heart that it's God's word and God's will for you, that's all necessary. And many times these gifts and things, they just encourage. I'm watching a Baptist preacher sitting here in front of me tonight. If I'm not mistaken, is this Mr. Dalton sitting here from Somerset, Kentucky? I thought it was I remember brother Ed Dalton. Oh my Baptist, right? And they u come up and but he believed and [music] come up to the church, received the Holy Ghost, went back down and of course all of his neighborhood let him down as [music] usual. And so then when the Holy Spirit had come and on the what we're looking for to happen at any time now another [music] gift that's going to be added to the church and uh it's a marvelous thing and we probably you've read the articles in our religious [music] papers about it about the squirrels and so forth and brother Dalton had two children well I think how many about eight children I nine children. Nine children and uh teenagers and you know how the archani and a poor father and mother how they prayed so hard that God saved their children. One day at the tabernacle he'd seen the Holy Spirit speak to a woman and tell her just ask what you will right now. And God told me to give you said what must I ask? I said, 'Well, you got a crippled sister sitting here has been crippled from birth, and there's a man sitting here tonight, Bankswoods, who's sitting right with me. The woman's name is Mrs. Wright. And I said, you got an age father and mother. You're living on less than $200 a year on that little poor farm over there, a widow woman. I said, there's many things you could ask for, Sister Hadtie. But I said, the very God that told me about those squirrels when I spoke, those squirrels are standing right there. and did that seven straight times standing right there whether you look and see it when it's just impossible for one to be sitting on the wall there just to confirming something and I said he tells me to have you to ask what you will he said you'd asked it for me to say it she said well what should I say I said ask for whatever you will it'll be given right here if it isn't then I told something wrong and she said well said I don't know what to ask brother Brandham. She said she had two teenage boys and talk about renegades they were. And so just giving her heartaches all the time. Poor little widowed mother. And so um her husband I'm married she to her husband and they were her husband had gotten killed on a tractor and those boys had just gone wild. And she said well the salvation of my two boys I said I give you those two [music] boys in the name of Jesus Christ. and both of them fell across her lap come to Christ. Brother Bankswoods is somewhere sitting here in this building tonight that was present to see that happen. Both them boys are finally taking feet washing all the time communioning at church and when we're taking feet washing the ones washing the feet we lay our hands over on them and pray that little fellow the other night about 14 years old our pastor brother Neville had his hand in praying for him the cutest little thing. So brother Ed Dalton seen that happen. He was praying for his children. Got outside and he turned back around and the Holy Spirit said, "Speak for Ed's children." And I said, "Brother Dalton, the Holy Spirit tells me by that same gift that we're looking to be perfectly manifested soon, I give you your children in the name of Jesus Christ." And when he got home there, his daughter and sons [music] already give their hearts to Christ. It's a few miles down the country from me. And I think every one of your children is saved and filled with the Holy Spirit. Ready? Is that right, Brother Dalton? Is there any of them with you? &gt;&gt; One daughter. Was that the one was saved right away? The oldest daughter was saved the next morning. And every one of his children is now saved. How the Holy Spirit when God says anything, he keeps his word. [music] See, now how could I save those children? See, it it isn't if it's not your own words, if it isn't your own thinking, then it's it's ever what's inspiring you. And if it's God, then it's God's word. See, so that's way on on the meeting here at night when you see those things happening, that's not me. I couldn't do that. It's God doing that. And if you'll just believe it, then that's all you have to do is just just believe it. Now, well, it's almost time called prayer line, Billy. I'll just take up so much time, but you know, I want to I want to make a an appointment with all the people around Chicago here. And this uh this brother sings here at night, Brother Melvin, how I love to hear that boy sing. I I want to hear him sing uh Remember Me. one of these nights before leaving. And there's a colored sister that sings at the Christian businessman. Oh my, you you should hear her sing ship a hoy. And um I told my wife, she's sitting back there tonight. And I'm I told her I hope she gets to hear that lady sing ship aoy. And brother Melvin sang remember me when tears are falling down. Oh, I sure hope we get these. And there's a little brother over there at that meeting the other morning. He's sitting back here somewhere. I shook it. Here he is. he and his wife. My talk about singing and when you get over in glory and I I wish always wanted to sing. I'd rather sing than preach anytime. So I I love singing so well. So I always said all the great singers of earth will be gathered over there singing the stories how they overcome over on a great big hillside in glory just across the river of life over on the other side. I want to sit and listen at him. So, I want to invite all you Chicago people to meet me over there now. And and um and we'll sit down and listen at him sing. So, we won't have any have to hurry and see if the children's going to get hurt or anything. They'll be there with us. There'll be nothing to hurt or destroy. [music] And we'll have plenty of time then. And we'll just talk long time. &gt;&gt; Just have plenty of time to talk. Now, I've got several scriptures that I want to refer to. I got some wrote out here and some pages [music] here. And I want to start tonight and read first a scripture found in St. Luke 8:50 for uh a text. And my subject tonight is the theme song they sang just before I come in, only believe. And uh uh St. Luke 8 chapter and the 50th verse. But when Jesus heard it, he answered him saying, "Fear not. Believe only, and she shall be made whole." Let us bow our heads just a moment for prayer. Gracious God, who brought again the Lord Jesus, thy son, from the dead, and has presented him to us after 2,000 years. We see him day after day and night after night in the invisible body of his working in the visible body of his church, bringing to pass his words. And as we were speaking the other night, you're right on schedule. Everything's hitting just right. God's great time clock's ticking just to the moment. Then tonight, when we see that that last midnight stroke is fixing to strike, oh great Jehovah God, be merciful to us. And as I think tonight you're before me, holding the purchase of your blood, their attention for the next 30 or 40 minutes, what must I say, oh God? These few words that's been prepared would be insufficient, Lord, without your anointing. So I pray that you'll anoint the words tonight of this text. And may they find their resting place and provide for us just what we have need of to be prepared for that hour. and Jesus does come because God noticed when my eyes opened a few moments ago laying here before me is that book of the Christian businessman where our precious brother Tommy Nichols translated from that tape that vision or whatever it was. Lord, you let me see across the curtain there. Oh God, I said if I could only go back for a I'd persuade, I'd beg people. Oh, they mustn't miss that. Lord, there's people here that's divided. They're living with me for me and my children between them and their children. I pray God that somehow another can be said tonight that will that we might have Christ divided among us tonight. That he might be the savior of every one of us and the healer of every one of us and our coming king. And that hope leave here in our hearts. May we live eternally with him over in that land where there's no sickness. I can think of them women how they were once recognizing here's old women 90 years old and there they was beautiful and young and those gayheaded man here on earth. There they was young and in their youth for eternity. &gt;&gt; God we couldn't afford to [music] miss that. Grant Lord tonight that each and every person will take new hope tonight. bless the saints and heal the sick for we [music] commit ourselves with this text in the name of Jesus Christ for thy glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus had just been turned down from a great revival. He was always about the father's business. I I like that. We me myself I have so much time that I'm I think I I foolishly used and uh all of us feel that way and we uh get so wound up till we've got to go somewhere and unwind but we have found Jesus always about the father's business. I love that. And that's the way we should be. We should never be idle in our time. What time we have, we must spend it for and [music] and conserve the time, redeem it because it is precious. Every time we get a chance to put in a plug for Jesus, do it. Every time we get to put in a plug for God, do it. Do something for the church and for in betterment of people. Many peoples, that's how we come to know these things is by what somebody's [music] told us. Jesus had left Galilee over in the land that he came from and crossed over the sea feeling led no doubt to go over to Geria for revival. No doubt but what the father had led him over across the sea to Geria. And you we all know the story that there was only one person saved. That was a maniac uh in Geria. And he was out into the fields and the cemetery. He would went wild and they put chains on him and the demon power could break the chains. And and I've often thought going around insane institutions and watch a person who's &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh been possessed with those evil powers, how strong they are. They take a policeman sometimes to beat him down. Remember down in Florida one night a man that wouldn't weigh over 120 lb whip five policemen just as easy as you'd whip your child. And um and then when that evil spirit went off of him, well, there was nothing. Harling just as meek as he could be. But it was an evil spirit. And I thought if a man possessed with an evil spirit could break chains, [music] what could he do if he's completely surrendered to God with the power of God possessing him like that? He could straighten every crippled leg and uh do [music] great things. if he could just be so anointed with God's power as the devil could completely uh get a hold of him. &gt;&gt; Did you notice that devil was so completely a hold of that man until he he even confessed Jesus said we know who you are the holy one of God. Why cometh to torment us before our time comes? See [music] he was so completely surrendered to the devil until the devil could use his tongue. And you know, I like that. I hope this don't hurt nobody's feelings, but we can get so completely surrendered to God that he can use our tongue, too, &gt;&gt; to speak in other languages and to preach the gospel, to sing the gospel, to speak visions that we're looking at and the mysteries of God. If we just completely surrender to the power of God, that's all. &gt;&gt; And if the devil can get a man under his control and do that, what can do God do with one get one under his [music] control? So this maniac and you notice when Jesus was crossing the sea, the devil knowed that he was on the road to a great win a great victory for God and he tried to drown him that night [music] caused a storm to come up and but Jesus knowed that God had sent him because he did only what God led him to do. Wouldn't that be nice if we had a testimony like that, brethren? I do only that which pleases God. Wouldn't that be wonderful? like Enoch walked with God 500 [music] years and had a testimony that he pleased God and didn't have to die. Just went up. So then uh a little afternoon stroll and just started walking out. Really thought, well, I've been on earth long enough. I'll just walk on up and just start by faith. He thought, well, I've been here long enough, so I'm kind of tired of being around here. I think I'll just stroll on up till hit the Milky White Way and just walk on up, knock on the door. So that's what he did. See, by faith he did it. The Bible said so. See, he just got tired standing here. He said, "Well, I'm just going to walk up home." God just went on up through the air walking. He did that by faith. The Bible said he did. And so, oh, I I when I feel death come knocking around my door, I I want to have that kind of faith. Don't you just say, "Well, hold on, old world. I'm going to walk away from you now." And just start walking on. just walk right on up and pass the moon and stars and strike the Milky White Way and go on into the spheres and spheres and out of the spheres and just go on into glory. That's right. And then um we find out that the devil can't destroy God's servant as long as he's in the will of God. [music] &gt;&gt; So he's we see him rise up that night and the devil all so angry and go to try to drown him out there on the sea [music] raised up and he said, "Why are you so fearful? You think I'd be doing anything less is in the will of God? Why are you so scared about? &gt;&gt; Why are you worried about anyhow? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why are you all upset? That's the same thing he'd say to us tonight, brother Andre. What are you so scared about? &gt;&gt; What's the matter? Are you afraid to trust me? He said, "Peace be still." And the winds and the waves obeyed him. &gt;&gt; Crossed over the sea. Oh, how beautiful. [music] there. He got on the other side and this maniac met him and and when he did, he was going to come out to tear him to pieces. And then the devil found out that that was little more than a man coming walking up there with those other 12 men. And then when he confessed him to be the son of God and confessed that he is future torment, Jesus said, "Hold your peace, but come out of him. &gt;&gt; [music]
