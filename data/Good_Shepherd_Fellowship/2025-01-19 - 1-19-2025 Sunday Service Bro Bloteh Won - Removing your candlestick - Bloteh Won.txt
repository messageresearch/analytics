uh prayer meeting this morning I would hope not to hold you long uh unless you allow me to and uh but uh we we would like to uh once again thank you all for coming out uh and uh being part of the service this morning and and we just want to thank you um with a heart of gratefulness Wednesday night we share with you u a little bit what was happening around our family and uh lost brother uh to uh after doing his liver transplant and then uh uh Friday night man I was just I was just I was just going through a whole lot I think it was the enemy was trying to get himself to me and uh uh and then around 2:00 a.m. in the morning I got a text uh from Nigeria a very good friend of mine uh he's actually a brother- inlaw to brother Deli a very very good friend brother Samson went to be with the Lord and I mean I was just I was just Crush you know uh uh he's a he was a pastor of a local church and uh uh and uh he's he's a a wonderful character very wonderful character and a good preacher very wonderful character I remember 2010 we did a convention that was just before I travel so we did a convention in April and then I traveled to the US in in in May and during that convention we we shared the convention together many many preachers and uh he preached an evening service I can remember and he said this evening he's a he's a doctor he said this evening we are going to do a surgery and our patient is going to be mosquito he says you see how mosquito is very tiny to do a surgery on mosquito you got to pay attention because anything you touch on mosquito can take mosquito life away so he said we're going to do a careful surgery to see you're going to join me in the theater for us to do a serery on mosquito and I mean no one knew where he was going with that but that's the kind of a character he was and I mean he brought the house down that night that evening and uh uh you know couple of uh months back I think some part of last year they were in a building construction and uh and I think uh he was trying to to help out the bed inside and he I think was trying to pick up a bag of c and he he caused a problem in his back and they sent him off the pullit for for many months I learned last Sunday was his first time back in the pit preaching so I remember he sent me the text very I mean very funny character very funny character he's a he's a good he's a good man and he sent me the text he says uh uh uh I'm I'm telling you I'm not feeling well brother W he says uh uh I if I die now you're going to send you're going to send all the support to bury me I don't need it then I need it now so when uh when I got the text he passed away all of those thoughts just flood through my mind you know they just flood through my mind I was lying there on the bed I said oh my God oh my God but uh I'm hoping to talk to his brother he and his brother his brother is uh uh Simon he also pastored another church both of them came out of uh a Muslim family their dad was a Muslim when they believe the message as young young boys so they had to go away from home and uh and that was just how their life Journey started so we we want to stand with them and and I'm hoping to talk to brother Del or his brother sometime in the week praise the lord well we don't know when is going to be our [Music] time so we want to we want to put the best that we that we want to put in this morning I was actually going to speak on uh on a t uh and uh what I wanted to talk on actually was to encourage uh uh uh responsibility and uh and then I I I thought like I said I was I was kind of a struggling between two thoughts where to go this morning uh because I I didn't want it to be to be misunderstood and uh uh but yet uh i t that uh with the time maybe we can just take something to encourage you this morning praise the Lord amen and then thinking about uh uh thinking about uh uh the loss of our brother brother I was just I was just so much uh caught in the place where I will I think I would just change my route this morning so uh doc you can look in the mail there I will send you something different from what I want to talk on this morning let's stay into our feet and we go to Revelation chapter 3 let's go to Revelation chapter 3 take the notes on Candlestick they use the one on Candlestick instead of the first one I sent you Revelation chapter 3 oh no not chapter 2 read um I'm thinking about the loud isue church age but it's in Chapter 2 Revelation Chapter 2 it's just it's just a little exitation I've thought about this for uh for a long time Revelation Chapter 2 let's read from verse one and unto the angel of Ephesus write this thing said he that holdeth the Seven Stars in in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven goaling candles STI I know th work that thou and thy labor and thy patient and how thy cannot bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and and have born and have patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from when thou are fallen and repent and do the first work or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove their Candlestick out of his place except thou repent let us pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus uh I labor under these thoughts on the weekend thought I could change it this morning still feeling the impression of going that direction I want to ask your blessings upon it Lord and father something will come out of faith that will be a blessing to your children dear Lord God sometimes you give a man an inspiration Maybe not for these people maybe for somewhere else maybe for the individual himself but Lord as we trust you together we just want to Fellowship around these thoughts we know your word is inspired we know your word is blessed we need the blessing Lord we want that God you condition our hearts and mind this morning that we can be able to receive from you in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord praise the Lord you love the Lord amen H the Lord is good all the time he's good amen now so uh uh with this with this Tau uh praise the Lord I will I will start off with this and uh uh uh there is something uh many years that uh I read in the church age book and and it have it have it have stayed with me for a while let me let me read this um this is from the Ephesian Church age that will be the second quot do has not the first how beautiful the Savior praise and command his children he takes full account all of the fine spiritual attitude and behavior just just pay attention here to me he takes full account of the fine spiritual attitude and behavior he know that there is weakness among them when we read uh uh uh Revelation Chapter 2 God is acknowledging to the church he says I know your word works I know your works so that's what brother brand is referring to here saying he he acknowledged that there is weakness Among Us he knows that there are failures Among Us he knows some of the things that we are dealing with and he says but yet he does not cry against it isn't that just like the Lord he knows how to encourage us in the right thing the right matters and discourage Us in the right matters see what he says here that got my attention we could all learn a good lesson here in running the church and our family what is the lesson that we could learn how to encourage the right think and how to discourage the wrong thing praise the Lord amen amen the Lord just done punish us for everything that we does he knows our our abilities he knows some of the things we are dealing with but yet he comes around and try to encourage Us in the right thing and discourage Us in the wrong thing and he says this a good lesson we all can learn that in running the church and running our family and better still we could all learn a good lesson in that God deals with each one of us in the exact way praise the Lord am amen he deal with us in the exact way he has a way to come around and discourage the wrong things if we are listening he will find a way to come around and also encourage Us in the things that we are doing well if we are listening better still we could all learn a good lesson in that God deals with each one of us exactly this way don't ever be discouraged saints of God for God is Not on gracious to forget your labor of love whatever we do even giving a cup of water to someone has a reward and the blessings from the Lord that's what Jesus said amen so let's let's uh let's uh whatever we find you know our hand in our hands to do let's let's do it amen let's do it as unto the Lord because he is the one and the only one that rewards praise the Lord yeah he's is the one and the only one that rewards so uh uh like I said I like to start up with this and I will go back to the the first let's go back to the first one I kind of a change on her so I have to help her out now it's almost the same scripture we read remember and repent that's what he says there remember therefore from when thou are Fallen where did you come from from Pentecost now he's talking to the church now he's talking to the church age where was the church birth at at Pentecost and Pentecost is not a denomination Pentecost is an experience amen we are Pentecostal by experience Now by denomination are we together where did the church come from from Pentecost from Pentecost you fell down to where you are now backsliding repent and do that first work go back to Pentecost again go back to your old experience amen go back to your uh or S I will come onto thee quickly and I will remove that Candlestick see who is it don't you his place except thou repent otherwise if if if you got if you got a god filled Pastor filled with the Holy Ghost now this is where now I don't want to be misunderstood because I'm not only saying this for myself and as I go on you will see why I'm saying it I'm trying to talk about uh leadership I'm talk trying to talk about responsibility and like I was telling the brother last night we were talking on I was sharing this with him I said I realize that's where we have failed you you hear about a lot of you know fces and Division and split Church plates and all of that I want us to just grab this concept now so pay attention he says uh if you get a go filled Pastor filled with the Holy Ghost and you try to hold him uh you try to hold him under your finger and say well if you say anything about us having a rough quiet if you say anything about us wearing makeup uh uh we will excommunicate him don't you worry God will do that before you get a chance to he will go out and preach to stones on the street before he did compromise with that kind of stuff you got a pastor that's really that that really tells you the truth you ought to H and stay in the and and and and stay in the spirit now let me go back again let me go back you got a pastor that really tells the truth you ought to honor God not the man you ought to honor God and stay in the spirit and worship God realize that you are going that you are going to be lost if you don't praise the Lord amen amen let me read on then I will I will come back to but people live today like the they are goinging this is the only thing there was life here on Earth that's all you don't realize you got a soul that going to leave here and go somewhere and you and and you seal your destination right here the way you live and the way you do out holding Gres mean and everything and then run to church oh mercy shame on you you bring a reproach upon the cause of Christ isn't that right don't we do it the the the bottle leer unhe hurting the church is unhe hurting dead is isn't The Prostitute that is hurting the church is the people who profess to be Christians that are hurting the church uh we know the bottle leer is we know who the bottle leer is we know what the prostitute is when our sisters dress like that that's different that's what hurt the church when the man drink like like the men drink the men of the church drink like the bottle leers well then that's what Hur the church they are professing to be Christians and then do that the people look for you that name let him that even named The Name of Jesus Christ depart from sin see get away from it oh we we are so short Brethren me you all of us we are so short of what Christ want us to be and right here in this day at uh uh it's time to lay aside every sin that easily beset us and wrong with patient the race that is set before us amen amen remember and repent oh I will remove the light of the sty out of out of his place what what his place in the church church but if you don't repent and go back to where you was at your first place I would I I will I will take your pastor right away from you and remove him out of this place now if you read in the church AG book he said it he said is for a church the pastor he said for the home it could be the husand now this is where I want to go with this whole thing or the Candlestick the Candlestick is the light bearer amen amen the candle is the light Barrel it's uh is is what is what the light the light uh uh uh you know what the what was placed in the Tabernacle to be able to Bear light to keep light in the Tabernacle so when we talk about the candles steak and the removing of the candle steak this is where my thought went with the whole thing because the Candlestick is said in Revelation a Candlestick but the Candlestick actually in the Tabernacle of of uh of of of Israel it was like a lamb standand okay and those and those lamb they were light that's what BR B said Church H book he said they were light from the fire from all of the altar now follow my thought now yes's the Candlestick but the Candlestick got their light from the fire from off of the altar are we together amen okay and uh when the priest goes into the Tabernacle he takes uh uh the the the light from The Altar and then he comes and light the Candlestick the first one one and then from the first one he goes and light the second one and from the second one he goes and light the tear one so it's it's a continuation of light it's the same light it's the same fire are we together amen but it's going from one Candlestick to another Candlestick to another Candlestick until the seven lamp stem or the seven Candlestick is lighted are we together amen and he he said that the the Candlestick or the lampstand they wheat the the the the wheat that that that pulls the the oil to keep them they all they all survive from one board okay the whe go down to one board and then it pulls and keep the Candlestick lighting now see where I want to go with this thought praise the Lord St John chapter 1 St John chapter 1 see where I want to go with this talk now praise the Lord our life every one of us our life when we when we give our first cry in the hospital it was just like our our Candlestick was turn on Okay we all are just like a candle light we all are just like uh uh a candle light St John chapter 1 let's read verse one here in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made listen to this in him was life and that life was the light of men so when you got the breath of light the Breath of Life a light was turned on from from the source of Life the the the the the Zoe The Giver of Life the Bible says in him was life in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God that word was made flesh all things was made by him praise the Lord amen and in him was life and that life was the light of men that's what I want us to pay attention so just like the Old Testament now you have to realize Moses built the Tabernacle according to the faction that he saw in heaven so just like the Old Testament Tabernacle the candle state in the Tabernacle were light from the Great Fire of God your life that you have this morning in this building the day that you were born your body was a Candlestick when life came into that body a light was turned on Amen because life is light are we together that's what the scripture is saying here are we together are you are you get grapping the concept okay let's look at another let's look at another comparison in the scripture 2 Samuel chapter 21 I'm uh I hope I can be able to bring it in a way that it will be a blessing to you this morning amen 2 Samuel chapter 21 the Bible will describe something here of isra wanting to go to battle uh the Philistines were making war with them okay let's let's read verse 17 you can read the entire story but 17 is where word m i will our tau is this morning are we together amen praise the Lord second Samuel chapter 21 2 Samuel chapter 21 on verse 17 amen so uh if you look at verse 17 here the the Bible says and Abel the son of zero seced him and smot the Philistines and killed him and uh uh let's let's let's go back to verse 15 we will get a good picture because what is happening there is that he have just protected David he had just protected David so uh verse 15 moreover the Philistine had yet wared against with W uh again with Israel and David went down and his servant with him and fought against the Philistine and David walks faint now David was older now than he was when he killed Goliath this is not the young David this is the older David now David has been King for many years and he's old and uh Ash which was the son of the Giant and and uh uh the weight of who spear weigh 300 shakers of Bri in weight he been gather with a new sword for Tau to have slain David now this is one of the Giants son but AB be sh shall the son of zero secur him which mean he he kind of covered David he shaded David and he smart the Philistine and killed him then the men of David swar unto him saying thou shal no more go with us to battle that quench not the light of Israel praise the Lord amen why they call him the light of Israel because he was the king are we together amen he was the king he was the head of the nation so in that sense he's the light of Israel amen just like the pastor is the head of the church he is the light he is the Candlestick he is not the only light are we are we together now I want you to understand this now just like the man is the head of the home he is the light what is the light for the light is to show the pathway okay it's a sense of leadership so here the man of Israel decided that David will no longer go we don't want to quench the light we don't want to be without a king we don't want to be without a leader so what they would do is now they will keep David home that he can no longer go to war are we together are you are you grapping the principle because it's it's all about uh uh uh uh understanding the principle then you'll be able to appreciate you know where where we going with this thought praise the Lord so the Bible says the word in the beginning had the life and that word was the light that lighted every man that cometh in the word so it makes us we have our individual light which a is our life and uh we we could we could carry it in a progressive way but I want to just I want to keep it in context this uh uh uh let's let's also look at Luke Chapter 2 let's look at Luke Chapter 2 and then we will go back to that code and then I will share my thoughts with you I'm hoping not to keep you long that was the plan praise the Lord Luke Chapter 2 let's look at verse 32 and I I will say some things here that will that will will you know that will kind of uh bring some balance to what we are we are sharing this morning Luke 2:32 this is uh Simon uh the blind prophet when Jesus was dedicated this was his speech let's read from verse 29 Lord now let that seven seven depart in peace according to Thy word for my eyes have seen their salvation which there has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles now you could take this back to Isaiah chapter 9 Isaiah chapter 49 Jesus was promised to be the light that will men that have sat in darkness great light has sprung unto them praise the Lord amen so in one sense also the messenger of the age becomes the lightbearer of the age are we together that's what the Candlestick represented Candlestick is just a light bearer are we together amen now so here is where this whole thought is going if the Candlestick if the lamp stem in the in the Tabernacle is light from the great altar of God the fire is taken from the altar of God is put on the first candles stick and it goes onto the next candles stick you see how uh uh brother Brandon talks about that in the church age how every uh uh the succession of Ages Every age inherit from the age that have passed are we together am the blessing of the Ephesus Church age went to the SAR Church age also the battle of the of the Ephesus Church age because they started dealing with the nicolan spirit it also went to the second Church age that's what make the seventh Church age h h h h a more difficult age because we inherit all the blessings and we also inherit all the battles I would together so one lamp stem was light from the next one then the tear one was light from the second to the tear the fourth from the so just like that but I also believe that uh it was God God was also setting a a a president to show us how responsibility is transfer praise the Lord let's go back to Genesis chapter 1 the Bible says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth he was the one there he said let there be light and there was light he did all the creation and then on the sixth day God Will Make A Man In His Image and in his likeness and then on the seventh day God will rest what is the pr principle there God in all of his work he never took rest until he was able to get a Man In His Image are you seeing the the principle so when God was able to achiev to get a man in His image and in his likeness what happened the work will continue now God can rest amen amen amen are you seeing the principle so you you see what happened is that if the if the Candlestick if the first Candlestick is light and the light don't move to the second candles stick if that first Candlestick go off what happened everywhere is dark because the light was not being able to transfer so you see in every age in every age I'll read something to you that's how all these for his people and he bring those very same thing down to us as far as a church he bring it down to us as far as in our home praise the Lord amen are we together am amen that as a lightbearer if you don't like the Next Generation why ever you have year when you die it die with you praise the Lord amen if you don't light if you don't pass the light on as a as as as a family if we cannot be able to pass the light on to to our children if we cannot bring them to the place to be able to understand uh you you know what uh uh uh what is this Christian Life all about what what are we taking them to church for if we cannot get that light if we cannot get those candlesticks light off praise the Lorden God God is Sovereign I'm not I'm not going to put God in a box okay I'm only trying to show you a principle praise the Lord amen I'm trying to show you a principle yes amen because we we see it everywhere and uh uh uh lately we have seen it a whole lot in our community of uh message Believers praise the Lord amen the the pastor de he's uh he's he's the man you know we love him we appreciate him but sometimes it becomes all about him and the light do not pass on and then when that Candlestick is removed sometimes the people go in darkness for the why the church plate the F and all of that is because the light do not move on are we together think about the great light of God the Bible says he was the light to light the Gentiles take this I'm I'm trying to make it in a way that you will picture it in your mind when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost what did the Bible says the Bible says the Holy Ghost fell and upon their head it was like tongue of fire and tongue of fire is just like how the Candlestick is when the candle light is light is just that's what it's called tongue of fire it's just like like a tongue and the tongue is in a kind of a a little bit like a paramid shape but it's round so that light Jesus lighted all of those 100 that was in the upper room amen praise the Lord do you see why the first church was successful when they killed him all every one of them got discouraged they went back to their fishing net those that were C went back I mean now Matthew didn't have anywhere to go he was a tax collector he was working for the Roman government now he have joined himself with this religious group and I mean they were all discouraged but when Jesus resurrected and show himself in their midst praise the Lord amen all they were all encouraging and they were keeping he told them you go and wait in the upper room until I Endure you people with power amen so what was he going to do he was going to use that great light that he was to light each of those Candlestick why because he wanted the responsibility to go onen amen amen even Mary the mother of Jesus Salomon and the other women they were in the upper room wanting to be lighten because it's truth the man is the head but most of the time the man is not spiritual not every time sometimes and in many hom the woman holds the spiritual responsibility she's the one fasting she's the one praying she's the one and I mean the the God is just breaking his brain to bring all the money home even though it do not it it it do not change the placement in the family why because one time God raised a debor as a George she was the spiritual woman she was the prophetess she was the one that was receiving word from the Lord to be able to tell Barack how to go into battle amen so sometime God does that yes are we together praise the Lord I'm may not be preaching your typical message message but it's okay praise the Lord hallelujah amen but I want you to grab this I want you to grab this Con uh H H uh this concept because brother brandom say it's a good lesson we can teach it at church we can also teach our family there praise the Lord amen because sometimes where where we we we we we fail as parents is that we send the children to school to learn they're just going to gain knowledge it does not make them responsible we don't we don't we don't teach them responsibility we don't transfer responsibility to them amen amen they learn they learn grammar and different things you know and then they correct you when you when you're when you're speaking is not right he said no papa that's not the way to say it this is the way they can say it as much as that is beautiful but there is a god-given responsibility and that's what I'm I'm trying to do this morning I'm trying to show that each and every one of us have a god-given responsibility that's right amen amen amen amen life was candle in us when when when when uh when when we were giving birth to a candle light was light as as we come down through through the through our age of life God in his Mercy also candle our light by giving us another spiritual light praise the Lord but you see what happened is that uh men become so selfish with their light it's only for them and when that Candlestick go off it's dead nobody they just they just remember you but you see when you live on you live on when you rais men to carry on the work praise the Lord Moses live on yes when he had a Joshua and a Caleb to take the people over to the promised land and put them in their inheritance yes amen they could tell the children of Israel this is the place that Moses spoke about even though he was not there but he live on Amen we can say a prophet say we can say brother brand said yes why because that pillow of fire has candled some some people amen it has been able to light some other men that can take the message faithfully and carry on amen amen praise the Lord amen that's why we see politics is fing because men are only learning the corrupt part of politics there is no men that are learning how to fight like the the old fathers fought for rights and fought for what was right they are not learning it just only learning the corrupt how to you know build their pocket up and build their Marions and make their family better it's just s you die all that money stay in the bank is is for nothing that's true God never rested until he got a man in His image until we can be able to bring forth another generation that can carry the fire of God until we can be able to be impart for in the little way that we can amen that's what it's all about you see some some some families you know what I mean I mean just many different examples we can give you when the head of that home is gone the family can no longer keep themsel there and before then it all it looks it almost looks like oh yeah you know they they were all wonderful but sometimes sometimes and many times we are just guarded by fear we are just been kept there by fear and keeping by fear do not last it's the same when you keep people under a legalistic teaching it do not last because you know what is happening it is only truth that can reside in your soul your soul can only feed on Truth your spirit can be intimidated your spirit can be it only dwells in fear fear will just keep you in that place and keep you religious and do not give birth are we together amen so you see when God set up that he set up that principle that's why brother Bram taught in the church ages he says as the as the Candlestick is life from the fire of God and he light the first Candlestick he says just like how that Candlestick is light he says that's how every Minister H that Messenger will have that same burning bush experience amen amen just saying brother brandham said it's not enough if we say brother Bram said and we don't have the life to back it I mean we just we just have it a public speaking the word do not have an impact the word do not grab the people are we together amen so just like how the the the the messenger is light by the fire of God the minister on him must be light by the fire of God and then he must also be able to transfer that fire of God upon the people amen amen amen are we together it's not the ministry of the preacher that makes the church no sometimes we think that's that's what it is now we yet about this man we it's just it's just the name of the minister that is out there but that's not what makes the church is the pillow of fire is the Lake of Fire is God taking that word and sparking your life and sparking your life and Spark in your life are we together amen that's what God wants to do it's it's it's a it's a continuation walk in the light as he is in the light it's a continuation he want to carry out that responsibility sometimes you think about that you find a wonderful group of people together all looks like a loving group of people when that fire of God is Not candle in the hearts of the people let little situation Rises this people that were looking like a loving group of people it looks like they have never seen one another it starts to say horrible things about one another that's right amen what were we doing we're just making another denomination yes we are all lightbearers the Bible say he lighted every man that cometh into the word we are all light bearer are you seeing the are you seeing the channel of thought that I'm I'm taking this morning I didn't wanted you to missunderstanding you know you know you read this you know uh God take take the pastor away it looks like I'm coming to die and I'm giving my found of speech I'm not dying now okay I'm not dying now it's not fairw message I'm preaching to you but it's just that it's necessary for us to let ourself know because the truth of it is that that's where we are faing that's where we are faing in our homes that's what we are feeling if we cannot carry this light you know uh uh for for for for the Candlestick of our children to be light when we are no no no longer around or they get to that age of challenge they don't know how to on the light they don't know that they are lightbearers they don't know that they are individual lightbearers why because they just been following your light daddy say I must not do this mommy say I must not do this they never come to the place to realize that they have their individual Candlestick and they have to shine light in their little corner amen amen when the child comes to that place of conviction they can be able to stand among their friends and say no I can't do that because it's not right I'm a Christian then that little light is beginning to shine are we together am are you seeing what I'm going with this praise the Lord well thank God I can be able to bring it to you so you won't S there U now now brother bam said this in why why are people to us about let's read that one there are seven goaling candlesticks by that Holy place and is giving light the candle stickes are giving light there to the man who quit his drinking quit his smoking quit lying quit stealing treat his neighbor right good to his wife or her good to her husband the same way men and women the Believers he come into a place where he quit all his meanness which which is through the blood with sanctification he's called to a new life and he walks in there he don't have to walk by the light out there he's got a better light he's walking by the Light of the seven golden Candlestick which is burning olive oil and the olive oil which represent the Holy Spirit the fire was the baptism which brought which brought baptizing or or even baptized right in there by the whole Holy Ghost amen now so when he when he taught that message why people are talk about he was all he was also in the same line of thought you know that people come too far they come so far to a sanctify life and never get a light from the altar are we together amen what did Isaiah said Isaiah chapter 6 when he repented he said who is me I'm a man of Da he said there was an angel that flew from off the altar with a core of fire and came and touched his lip why because that's that was what he told God I'm a man of unclean lips the fire of God came and sanctify his lips praise the Lord and when we talk about the pillow of fire that's what the pillow of fire is I'm I'm in as much as I believe that that that that God can create a glory of light that can hang on me what is the need of that light if my life is not changed I want a pillow of fire that can drop down in my heart and change my nature amen am amen amen amen praise the Lord amen think for example the children of Israel they follow the pill of the pill of fire hang over them 40 days 40 night everywhere they were going in the day it turned to the pillar of cloud in the night it was a pillar of fire yes with all of that they were still gossiping they were still aring they were still disobeying Moses so what is the need of that if that pillow of fire Cannot drop down in my heart sanctify my lips clean my Minds from Evil thought change my nature that's what I want that's the kind of a pillow of fire I want amen are we together amen so you see that is uh that is the way God transferred his responsibility when he rais up a man he take that fire to the next faithful generation praise the Lord amen if not the work of God will be dead that's right the light of God will go off let Israel in battle they are seeing they are seeing how weak David is he's not as strong as he was and these Giants are trying to revenge and kill him they said no we will not bring the light of Israel to war anymore because when the king is dead the nation goes into darkness until another king is raised up praise the Lord amen so they pull him out of battle because he was the light to the nation yes as husman we all light to our home it's not enough to just say I'm the man of this house no that's is not enough that's right we must be able to take that fire from off the altar amen through prayer a life of Consecration and say Lord uh I light my children I light my wife Let the Fire of God burn in this house yes I can I can pull all the millions of cot on respect your pastor and can't write in and just say the brother BR said respect your pastor you must respect the man you must respect his off I can do all of that it does not change anything right praise the Lorden but when the fire of God can come from out of the pages of the word if God can be able to say something that would grab the people heart and create a prayer life in them and create a life of concentration in them but not need to be whing people on their back amen they are not slaves for us to use coat and be weeping them they are the redeemed that must be rejoicing in the word when the word is preached we must know that is our labor T we must rejoice in it amen amen amen are we together the Lord is beautiful you know you think about all of that you think about all of that I'll read this to you I might pick it up another time I thought that I would finish at 1 1 p.m. today so I don't want to go above that time let's read this spoken word is the Original Seed I will pick I will pick up from there another time that's what every generation has its own Revival and Chang at the word so The Sovereign God at the Judgment Wesley group will rise up and these uh STW Methodist of today will answer for Luther will rise up the Catholic Will Rise Up from back behind Arena's Mighty poap and all those and will have to stand the Judgment for hybriding the word of God to Dogma now I remember correctly that's why each generation has its own Revival it gets a chance at the word so you see God gave us a chance praise the Lord amen we can sit down yet and say world if we were at we can sit down yet and weep to have been at Aza weep to have been there when Luther put the Theses there but God has given a chance at our own Revival where the word can live in our midst that's right if we all can put our shoulder to the will and know that we are responsible for this little group we have a chance at our Revival what is the Revival is to make this word live amen not just wearing a h h h attack on us I'm a Believer but living like one and creating an atmosphere where others can also come come in and live as at once we had a CH we have a chance at re Revival it is on our hands amen it is whatever we do with it praise the Lord amen if you know and realize how this little group is a blessing to the Feld that comes here and uh to the Community Praise the Lord amen in some way we will not be caress like the way sometimes we are we will know that it is our responsibility to pray all the time is our responsibility to do whatever we can do or we supposed to do for the light of of God to keep burning that this little place will be a lighthouse that's right praise the Lord therefore how no we don't know how long that God will keep us here praise the Lord amen you know every every every Revival every messenger wish that the Rapture took place in the time of their Revival why because look at even Paul he called he called the ERS of the Ephesian church right there out of Ephesus where he told these words to them at my departure gravier wolves will come among you to scatter the Sheep it's it's always the fear of the leaders of every Revival why why why they have that is because they don't want the Revival to die that's right amen amen so he's urging the people you got to fight because there are men that have creeped in will try to scatter this revival every age God gave us a chance every group of people yeah we have a chance to our Revival amen we can have God moving in our M moving in our life amen now poting into what happened in the past but we can say God is with us I see God dealing with me I see God moving in my home amen why because we are spraying the fire of God musicians you can come I can I can go on and on but This Little Light Of mind let's just sing that together before we pray that's how I feel I feel that this little lot of M Let It Shine amen amen I'm not going to hide it under

don't know where you are in your walk with God but I need more of God brother brand says the Dynamics to this church will be the refilling of the Holy Ghost and the reason why is because it's a constant refilling we will need it as the day gets tougher we you were need it when you feel dried in your prayer life in your Christian Life you feel negative you just feel discouraged you need another dose of the Holy Ghost you need an altar you need another place to get down and cry to God oh Father we lift our hands to you Lord we lift our hearts to you oh god oh Father Lord before my
