let's pray from The Gospel Center okay let's read from judges first get this chapter 15. and then we read from Saint Luke yes to encourage ourselves hear this chapter 15. let's read from verse 14. and when he came and when he came unto leche the Philistines shouted against him and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and the cause that will upon his arms became as Flex that was paint with fire and his bands loose from off his hands and he found a new job bone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand Philistines there with thousand men there with and Samson said with the Jawbone of an ass hips upon hips with the Jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand men and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he Cast Away the jaw bone out of his hand and call that place Rama Lehi and he was so attest and call upon the Lord and said that has given this day thus giving this great Deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall I die of testing and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised by God clef and Hollow please that was in the Joe and there came watered there out and when he had drunk his Spirit came again and he revived therefore he called the name thereof and hakiro which is inlay until this day I mean let's be seated let me read from the gospel said look chapter one you love him oh yes it's so good yeah oh Luke chapter one let's hear what this creature said from verse 30. and the angels said unto her fear not Mary for that has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb they shall bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus let me guess to save time just say okay let's read it all right amen it's wonderful to read the Bible the word of the Lord behold acts 31 behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb they shall bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus it shall be great it shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom and of his kingdom there shall be no end they say Mary unto the English how a distance be see I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the only thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she have also consumed a son in a old age and this is the sixth month we Faith who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible amen so today also we've got nothing shall be heard let's read one more scripture praise the Lord look chapter four it's about our lord Jesus chapter fifth let's read from chapter 16. and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and it's custom and asked that and as is custom was he went into the synagogue on this sabbath day and stood up for to read he had a custom he goes to church Jesus as his customer that's the Bible say as his custom was he went to the synagogue so Jesus goes to church brother Brown said God goes to church he said if God is in your heart you will not wait for the elders to be open yeah that's right so not just speaking but that's the scripture as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiahs and when he had opened the book he found a place where it was written yes so Jesus read books so he brought a brand read books Jesus read books always read from other people Jesus reform other people are talking around and brother Brown read the books here he read this man Bruce brother Branham he told us instead told us I read books said I understood by the books yeah that books not the prophets they read from one another when Jesus said my son only by breath alone but Moses has already said it was decided where Jesus was here he said you have had a vote it is written like this but I say to you so he read he knew and he added to what has not been done the prophet came in he read Luther Wesley different things but then he came to gather the Loose Ends what they left behind he gathered it to give it to the bride and he said when the mystery has been done the work has been done the worst is done then God came back to reveal it yes to show us what has been what was and what to be praise the name of the Lord talking to somebody yesterday or day before and we're talking about oh they said somebody prophesied that man because he has exhorted himself or glorified himself God is going to take him away and God took him away I said so what go to Moses because you failed to glorify me I'll take you away now go to Joshua the fees that Moses give to you meditate upon a day and night yeah so God taken away has nothing to do with what Moses said if Moses glorify himself and God took him away okay glorify himself and God took him away it has nothing to what he has said [Music] Joshua meditate upon that with my servant Moses according to you yes day and night don't depart to the left or to the right stay right with it [Music] um praise the name of the Lord I want to encourage you to stay with the message [Music] and meditate upon a day and night don't deviate to the left and right oh somebody I said look if you want to pray for me pray like this that which I have read ahead from the prophet of God that God will give me Grace to live by it that's all my prayer that's the request I give also to you that what you hear on the test and the man that preaches this Christ and he glorified Jesus Christ and he preach on Holiness and he's talk about the preeminence of Christ that Christ is everything not the second person not the third person but the very God of creation and he tells you your men the way we should live young women the way we should live matters the way we should live Father's day where we should live husbands and what the way we should live that Christ will be all you know if a man preached like this and he preached on the importance of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the kids and every one of us must get the Holy Ghost and leave Christ you call that man the first prophet I will stay with him [Music] because I know what the word of God has done in my life [Music] I know where I'm coming from and I know where I have been brought to you that made this book open Hallelujah you know when Jesus Christ what we read from either the spirit of the law was upon me as I spoke it under this anointing Isis is the one is that prophesied the spirit of the Lord is upon me he has anointed me to preach this good tithing but the Brokenhearted and this and the acceptable you of the Lord and the Vengeance of our God Isa has spoken and then the Lord Jesus went to the temple that day and this girl was given to him and they begin to read and when you read to the acceptable you of the Lord he stopped he stopped he didn't continue so Iraq's first verse and the second verse is stopped it didn't complete the second verse because the second verse spoke about and the Vengeance of the Lord we have not been reading but listen he said because what he read and stop what for the time he came the acceptable you of the Lord he took a prophet William Branham to break us break it for us to know that hey that's why he stopped over there the prophet of God was preaching on best pains and he had this Bible new Bible that was given to him because it was a new book a new Bible the lifters were joined together you open John chapter 14 and then this side chapter 15 and what is this in a Roman priest took his own Bible he came right to the front he came and he hand over to the prophet behind exactly they said he said my son be still yes God is fixing to do something he said thank you sir and brother brown red on bethpaste and he was preaching on judgment and birthplace and the way when a woman is going to have tried the process you go through when the water breaks and this coming the blood clamps before Life coming and it was just preaching and the Finish is preaching he was going home and he was talking he was embarrassed because the wife was embarrassed because she gave the Bible and then in that discussion the law came down he said did you remember that Jesus went into the temple and a priest gave in the Bible Hallelujah and Jesus spoke on the acceptable year of the Lord do you see what happened over there who gave you the Bible a priest Catholic please give me the bible to read and brother Brown came back and preached this day this scripture fulfilled [Music] the Vengeance of the Lord was declared [Music] through a prophet God used that Voice Jesus Christ again in his servant what are you talking about you all this this happened just like that just like coincidence it was planned by Jehovah God so we have not believed cannily devised Fables are we together [Music] oh man may God help us my prayer this things God help me to live by it let this thing be made flesh in me [Music] let this word be made flesh he made the review word to line up with this word what are they talking about and your mind is moving like this and that no double-minded person can have anything from God you must be convinced you must be concerned yeah because these things are the true say of almighty God that's happening for happiness sake what are you talking about are you crazy brother said do you think God will give me the ministry he has given me if indicate it all over the world and leave me in error he says certainly not I know where I am standing if you don't understand anything that doesn't make it wrong remember you don't understand it so if you don't understand the limit please God help me amen yes don't try to put your interpretation to it I believe that day when Jesus read that scripture he said every eye was set and we said this is the discreeter everybody was looking and what is he talking about is he is he meaning that this thing is concerning yes it was concerning he knew the scripture that concerns his ministry amen God help us are we together what I want to speak on little is uh the Supernatural coming upon the natural praise the Lord I want you to know to know that God said before Miracles can be done the supernatural must come upon we are flesh and blood there is nothing good in US but remember we have been brought here for a purpose and before you can save that purpose the supernatural has to come down Glory and nothing must come down [Music] must anoint you to fulfill the purpose for which you are brought here that is why the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a mass yes because even the disciples don't go out and preach don't do anything wait for the promise of the father praise the Lord what because you need that anointing Jesus started this ministry with the anointing I saw the Spirit descending upon him like the form of a dove so Jesus of Nazareth the Bible said was anointed and he went out doing good the anointed that came upon him was for a purpose to do the will of the father to set the purpose of the father for you to set the purpose of the father you must get the same anointing it's not your size it's not my side it is God has to anoint us young women if we are going to do it we must get that anointing sisters we must get that anointing the power of the highest the supernatural must come upon the natural the Bible tells us like in the days of old before Christ came in they had a pool of bethesia and the Bible tells us in John chapter 5 thousands of people hundreds of whatever might be gathe he said because at the certain time or certain period And in the acceptance season and Angels steps into the water still the water moves the water and whatsoever will get there first we get healed drop into the water jump in is healed and according to history people fight over there of course if I was there I would fight yes because you want your healing and there were hundreds or what thousands over there and everybody was just looking and the Supernatural is that the water is from one way but when the engine moving it goes that way so the everybody oh man you might be going this way but when that anointing comes it diverse go this way the supernatural because it is ordinary the water is just flow like this but the power of God that comes down takes it over why is back it is the current take this everything he moves upon it and stop it and go this way and whatever condition you are in whatever situation you are in whatever state you're going let the power of the highest come down and change your course to the right direction to the way God wants you to go not where you want to go not how you want to live know what you want to do but the power of the highest we come down upon us and turn our cross thank you Lord praise the Lord Hallelujah praise the Lord are we together are we following that the supernatural comes upon the Water the natural also unto the angel steps in instead of water it Remains the Same it's just water you're jumping nothing happens you're getting nothing but when that angel moves in when the supernatural comes down turn it this way and then whoever gets in WoW can you imagine what was happening over there fighting because hey we are all sick when we are all if you are there you are circums everybody you think about yourself before you can think about somebody else as we are sitting we are both tell the bee will be out before I say I'm telling you nobody will come from the back say are coming to fix my wife first no body will be struggling because you don't know what they say you just said that noise they are coming everybody scattered you come up before you say hey I left my wife mothers will leave their children oh my God so that was struggling over there for physical healing the prophet of God said if there is a drug that if you take that drug you will live 100 years straight or whatever years will be he said you have to get militia people to come and control the clouds because they'll be fight yeah because if you have a guarantee that if I take this tablet I will be straight hundred years or 120. everybody will struggle for it yet yet we are offering eternal life we have been giving eternal life and nobody wants it and people don't want it and you are not serious about it a young man you are playing with this and young women you are playing with it the mothers and fathers are playing with this this is eternal life that you will live

thoughts again you don't want to have your own way again you don't want to do your own things again you want to do what places the master we need to fulfill God's will for our life I will try and be brief but this thing is wonderful now we read in that dark day the supernatural has to come down so that the change comes the prophet of God said God has no hands but your hands no less of it but mine and yours no eyes but our eyes Moses at the back side of the desert we read about the tree a bush bunny the supernatural came before that thing was happening the supernatural came down and Moses saw that three and ah what is this the supernatural always comes down Moses said let me see what is happening and go and God you are on Holy Ground and the man at the age of 80 got 10 things around like this he can do it for you too [Music] I'm a failure I'm just a Shepherd you might just be a student you might just be a young man you might just say young woman just an old lady but God can turn it around and your testimony your life will be a testimony oh who am I am just a sinner a sinner saved by grace who am I ever slider saved by grace God restored by grace I'm not worthy yes none of us is worthy and none of us will ever be worthy but the supernatural comes down God takes on worthy things and make us Worthy for by grace are you saved not of yourself not of your words none of us none of us would never will ever be that worthy it's just God's grace the supernatural oh that God will come down that the power of the highest will come upon us that the presence of the king will come upon us that anointing will come upon us if Jesus our lord could not do it but the spirit of God has to come up on there are nothing has to come upon any and it went about doing good how can you do with that the Holy Ghost how can you do it without the Holy Ghost hey I'm not talking about coming to church I'm talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about God coming into your life I'm talking about the power of the highest to overshadow us and when we are overshadowed read what the angel to marry because when the angel spoke to Mary and it's so near but what is going to happen I don't know a man how can it be you might be asking how can it be hey let the power of God comes down then you will not think your thoughts again you can say that's like Madison let it beat unto me I don't understand these things I cannot explain these things how a virgin a young woman with that man can give birth I don't know I've never heard it before but be it unto me I don't want to raise it I
