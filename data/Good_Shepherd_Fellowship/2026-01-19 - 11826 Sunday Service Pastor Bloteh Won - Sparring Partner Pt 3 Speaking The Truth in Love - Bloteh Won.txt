And it came to pass when he have made an end of speaking to Saul that the soul of Jonathan was not with the soul of David. And Jonathan love him as his own soul. And Saul took him that day and will and will let uh him go no more home to his father's house. Then Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul. And uh Jonathan stripped himself of the ro that was upon him and gave it to David and his gathering even to his soul. and to his bone and to his ghetto. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord. Whenever I come I come back here, I get so nervous until I start missing everything. We have a baby that we should dedicate this morning. I think that was the first thing we were supposed to do before reading the scripture. But now that the scripture is read, we'll put the David dedication right into the preaching of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.

Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we read a portion of our scripture and u we've been speaking on spiring partners. We want to see how we can bring that uh uh talk to an end this morning. Um we want to see if we can bring that thought to an end. Thank you, brother Dan, for for reminding me. Uh so all all our little ones, you can go back there. Uh uh all our little ones, you can go back there. Our Sunday school ones and then uh uh one of one of the sisters working to go back there. Praise the Lord. Amen. the little ones are enjoying it. So why not? Let's give it to them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's give it to them. &gt;&gt; So uh uh we like I said, we want to see how we can trust the Lord to to uh close this subject aspiring partners. But I kind of titled it this morning speaking the truth in love. And uh uh there's a that I wanted to get to with this thinking and um I don't know if uh uh it's not the right time or or whatever it is, but I'm going to I'm going to do my best this morning and take another route here. Uh so the scripture that we read was uh actually uh pointing to the friendship that was between uh Jon and David. And we we use We talked about uh uh Barnabas and Saul last week uh showing an aspect of uh aspiring partners. This morning we want to take uh uh Jonathan and David and uh we just we just want to use them as a type of uh of uh uh men that God brought together. And and in the way with the story of Jonathan and David, you can see that uh uh uh Jonathan was uh the one to be to to inherit the throne after his father uh uh Saul. But when he recognized the gift of God in the life of David, when he recognized what God was doing in David, he was willing to somehow uh uh surrender that office. He was willing to protect David. He was willing to fight for David even against his own father. Praise the Lord. So the scripture we read it speaks about uh uh uh journey turn and David that is just after 1st Samuel chapter 17 that speaks about the wall between David and Goliath. So journey turn watching a young man whether David was younger than him or or he was younger than David but they might have been age group they might have been youth and just to see the courage that a young man had to be able to stand against the giant that terrify uh the the not only the armed of Israel but the people of Israel. Praise the Lord. just to be able to see such a courage that David had and uh uh he uh he he thought that there is something about this guy. Amen. There is something about this guy and the Bible say he loved David as his own soul. Amen. He he loved David with everything that was that is within. So when you read uh uh chapter uh um you read chapter 18 uh it talks about that relationship you get over in chapter 20 let's look at chapter 20 verse4 and the bible will speak here then said jaton unto David whatsoever that thy soul desire I will even do it unto I will even do it for thee and David said unto jaton behold tomorrow It is the new moon and I shall not fail to sit with the king to sit with the king at meat. But let me go that I may hide myself in the field onto the onto the third day at evening. Now you have to realize now David is doing this because couple of times Saul has used javelin to to to hit at David. Now so they are going to to have this feast. They will be sitting in the room the family by themsel David in his mind thinking that Saul could kill him right there and nothing will come from out of it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He was thinking in his mind, this is a very close range. I'm going to be right there. He's going to be there. So well, he advised himself to go away. And now he's telling Jonathan near verse six, if the father had all missed me, then said David earnestly asks, "Leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem, his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family. If he said thus, it is well that seven shall have peace. But if if he be very rough, then be sure that evil is determined by him. Praise the Lord. Therefore uh uh thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant. For thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee, notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself, for thou shouldest thou bring me to thy father. Now, so David is saying all of this to him. Jonathan can't believe it that his father will ever be thinking to do any evil to this man that have never done anything. This man that has brought proud upon the nation. He just can't believe it. So now they setting all of this up and then uh let's drop a little bit down to verse 25 just to cover our jun and uh and David's story yet a little bit. Verse 25. Verse 24. So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon was come, the king sat the king sat him down to eat meal, and the king sat upon his his seat as at all times, even upon the seat by the wall. and Jonathan the rose and Abnad uh uh sat by Saul's side and David place was empty. Nevertheless, Saul speak not anything that day, for he thought uh something had befallen him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean. Talking about David now. And it came to pass on the tomorrow which was the second day of the month and and David place was emptied. And Saul said unto Jonathan his son, where wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meet me yesterday not today? And Jonathan answered Saul David earnestly asked me ask leave of me to go to Bethlehem just like they planned to say. And he said, "Let me go, I pray thee, for our family have a sacrifice in the city, and uh my brothers, he have commanded me to be there." And now, if I have found favor in thy eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore, he cometh not unto the king's temple. And saw then saw anger was counted against journey and he said unto him, "Thou son of a perverse, rebellious woman." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh do not I know that thou has chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and onto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. in in is is a kind of a ugly expression. is an insult and uh uh but but you you can see the picture here now uh uh uh Jonathan has really proven you know what David told him that there is there is evil in the heart of Saul you know he want to kill this boy so now uh Jonathan can't believe it that his dad is is just full of rage and evil like that just to hear that David gone to greet his people now then and we know that the rest of the story Uh they have planned that Jon will shoot an arrow to announce that do not come back here. You know he says if I shoot the arrow on the right and send the young man to pick up the arrow then you should come. If I shoot it on the left far above you, it means that you should flee. Praise the Lord. So u uh uh uh uh the thing here is that the picture we want to look at here is is God bringing these two men together. And uh uh because David was the one that was anointed to be king as we as we know there from the time of Judah. If you if you go back uh to Ruth and you go back to the history uh when when when when uh Jacob prophesied the scepter will come out of Judah, we know that it was a promise of a kingship in Israel. So right from that time uh uh uh David is the one that is fulfilling that kingship because Israel had never had a king. The king was supposed to come from out of the heart of Judah, not out of the house of Benjamin. Saul was out of the house of Benjamin. So he was out of place. He was he was a permitted king. He was in the permissive word of God. That's the reason why he he could fail. He could never prosper because he was in the permissive word of God. The king was supposed to come from out of the house of Judah. Now Samuel came and anointed David to be king. So we see everything playing out here. But yet God has raised up a man in the house of Saul to be able to protect David to get to the kingship. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see in this in this partnership, it's all about God's purpose. &gt;&gt; It's not about our greed and our selfishness and what we want. It's all about God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Last week we look at Paul and Barnabas. Barnabas was the one that went and got Paul and brought Paul and the bread the brethren. Amen. Introduced Paul over to the apostles and talk about Paul. But when it came to the place where Paul felt that uh h was not you know he was not he was not mature or he was not ready for the job you know he and Barnabas fall apart. But the picture in that also is not their argument and their disagreement. God allowed that so Paul can fully go into his ministry &gt;&gt; to become the chief apostle &gt;&gt; to become the prophet to the Gentiles. Because as long as he was with Barnabas, Barnabas will always overshadow him because Barnaba was the one that brought him in. &gt;&gt; Okay? So God allowed a little misunderstanding there and we saw that uh Paul when he took uh Silas with him he was able to get Timothy get Titus ordained this man and Paul was right into his ministry. At the end of his ministry he sent for Mark the very same John Mark. Okay, sure. &gt;&gt; He sent for him and says, "Bring back unto me, he will be much profitable." &gt;&gt; So you see God's ways upon it past funny that &gt;&gt; this whole thing is God's program &gt;&gt; and we have to watch it and see it that way. Even the way that he brings us together as a church, the way he brings us together as a family, I must never get to the place and feel that well yeah, you know, I went down to this place and I choose this woman to be my wife. It was my choosing, you know, and and you have to see there it is God's design. &gt;&gt; And if it is God's design, God has a purpose. And it is only the things that serve God's purpose, his promise, a resurrection. &gt;&gt; So this whole thing about partnership is tied to redemption. It's tied to God's plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's tied to God plan of redemption. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's let's look in uh uh u Ephesians chapter 4. That will have been our our second scripture reading. But since the baby dedication became part of the preaching, we are going right ahead. Amen. We are going right ahead. Oh my goodness me. I was glad that I I caught myself even if I would have started preaching and remember I was going to stop preaching and dedicate the baby because I know they are tough. The girls wouldn't have spared me to the house. Amen. If I would have just continued. Ephesians chapter 4. Praise the Lord. Ephesians chapter 4. Let's look at this also. We see here in verse uh 11, the Bible says he gave he he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifiring of uh the body of Christ. Till we all can come come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man onto the measure of the statue of the fullness of Christ. There. Henceforth we be no more children toes toe and for and carried about with every wings of doctrine by by the by the sides of men and a cony craftiness whereby the delight in which to deceive. But speaking the truth in love may grow up into him uh in all things which is the head even Christ. Praise the Lord. yesterday that as as I was thinking about this I was uh uh there was something I felt strong to go into but then at the end of the day that I just said no maybe I might talk about it uh another time you know uh with with everything that is happening around the country and around the world uh as as as Christians as Bible believers you know we listen to the news and then we also look into prophecy. So I started looking through the message and trying to find what brother Brandham said about Greenland and I saw some very interesting quote you can check it up yourself is is something that is open to to the to the public domain. You can search it out. I saw some interesting thing that Brother Brandham said about Greenland and uh but then looking into that and and and reading what brother Brandham said and also searching out history, a uh it brought me to a place where I will have talked about uh uh some things that have to do with the with the economy and different things, but I just thought that well I mean we we we just have we we we already have this kind of ugly cloud hanging over us in Minneapolis that is that is you know that is easy to make people to be panicking and uh so let me not let me not quote talking about people finance and all of that let me leave that one for now maybe another time we will look into it &gt;&gt; but it was very interesting you know just like just like I say all the time any you know we will always say that uh we don't we don't believe in in uh you know Bible schools we don't go to Bible school but I would tell you that the message of the hour is one of the greatest uh uh document that is search and search can you imagine how many preachers search the message of the hour every week &gt;&gt; to be able to find something to preach &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; and and and and for many of us uh uh uh years back uh you know uh believing the message in the time of war the message of the hour was a very it was a very great source of education to us &gt;&gt; you know every everything uh you know unless I don't think about it that way but when it catch my mind I try to look to see what a prophet has said about it so maybe sometime we will we will look at it but it was very interesting to see that how global politics is playing. &gt;&gt; And sometimes uh uh uh even the people that are championing all of these politics don't know the things that they are playing with. &gt;&gt; Like I always say, prophecy is stronger than politics. &gt;&gt; And as children of God, let's realize prophecy is what is driving this thing. And if you believe God and you believe the uh God's word, then you must rest on that &gt;&gt; and don't rest on the politics &gt;&gt; because prophecy is what driving what we have happen. &gt;&gt; It's around the word. Everything is driven by prophecy. So uh uh that's not what we're looking at this morning. So let's go back here now. So we see that God uh has ordained a five-fold ministry. God has ordained a five-fold ministry. Men that uh that he called and he gave gifts just like Jesus had 12 disciples. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He has 12 men that he drew closer to him. There were 17. Out of the 17, he drew 12 that he he he the scripture called disciples that he taught them a little bit. Mark chapter 6. Let's let's just look at how how Mac uh uh speaks of them here a little bit. Mark chapter 6. Praise the Lord. Mark chapter 6 and and and again uh just uh just uh for our information this book of Mark Mark was never a disciple. He was not a disciple. He was not among the 12. This is the very same John Mark. &gt;&gt; The very same John Mark. He he's writing this and scholars believe that this is Peter's account of the gospel. But Mark wrote it. That's what many scholars believe. &gt;&gt; So this is the very same John Mark, you know, he's uh left his mother house and followed Banner and and and Gary said he's he has grown to the place to be able to give us an account that we can rely on this morning. So Mark chapter 6, let's read from verse 7. Mark chapter 6 from verse 7. Jesus has come back to his own city and uh and and and when he came back there there was there were just a whole lot of things that the people had to say about him you know where he make that statement a prophet is not without honor but in his own country and among his own kings and in his own house. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But uh verse seven will tell us that and he called them and he called unto him the 12 and began to send them forth two and two and gave them power over unclean spirit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now according to the according to the scripture over in the book of Deuteronomy the Bible says uh uh uh uh on any matter you can only accept uh the witness of two. &gt;&gt; So two has always been the number of a witness. You just can't accept only one person. You have to have another person that witness the same thing in the mouth of two or three. That's where that came from. Amen. Let everything be established. So we see here that Jesus is also carrying this principle out in the way that he sent out his disciples. He sent them out two and two. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Solomon, brother Solomon, the great uh the great uh mind of wisdom in Ecclesiastes chapter 7, he also said this. Let's read it together. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh, chapter 4, sorry. Ecclesiastes chapter 4. From chapter 3, Solomon will start to talk about how everything under the earth, there's a time for everything under the earth. In chapter 4, he will go and uh and start looking at uh uh uh governmental stuff, how how things were wrong by the Lord and how people were oppressed and and you know and all of that. He's looking at it. But then when he comes down here, Solomon would pick up four men. You would talk about four kind of a man. You would talk about uh uh uh uh verse four again. I consider a travel that that uh that every right work that that for this man is envy and and his neighbor this is vited investigation of spirit. He would talks about the food. He would talks about the independent man. He would talks also about the industrial man and uh and and on and on. But as he speaks of them, he will come to this this other line of conclusion which is in verse 8. That's the conclusion he talks when he talks about the independent man. He said there is one alone. That's the independent man. He's alone. And there is not a second. Yet yet he had neither child nor brother. Yet is there no end of all his labor. Neither is his eyes satisfied with riches. Neither said he, for whom do I labor? and believe his soul of good. This is also vanity yet it is a soul of travel. He's an independent man. He's working. He get all of his wealth yet he don't have anybody to pass it down to. So from that Solomon will come up with this statement that we all are familiar with. Verse nine, two are better than one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They have a good reward. It is not more in the substance of what they gather, but the way they reward one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Two is better than one because they learn to reward one another. Because I'm telling you, if if they just only gather reward separate for themsel, they will kill themselves over that reward &gt;&gt; with the unconverted nature of men. &gt;&gt; But when two men works together and they learn to reward one another, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They learn to to to look for the progress and and the advancement of one another. That's what he that what he means. They have good reward for their labor. For if they fail, the one will lift up his fellow. &gt;&gt; But woe unto him that is alone when he when he fall for he have not another to help him up. &gt;&gt; He don't have a sparing partner. &gt;&gt; Somewhere he's greeted. &gt;&gt; Amen. In some way he's greeted in some way life throw that at him. But in in whatever way that life throw it at us. Again if uh two lie together then they have heat. &gt;&gt; But how can one be warm alone? And if one prevail against him, two shall withstain him and a threefold call is not quickly broken. I read that for the purpose. &gt;&gt; The reason why I read that, the purpose that I read for is because in most cases that is tied. It's it's normally read during our marriage ceremony. But just like I said on the first day, you you will realize that uh uh uh God internal laws and press and principle. We we sometimes try in our human mind to understand it. There are so much we reduce it to our canality and perversion. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God's intents behind us is more than just our fleshly desire. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there there are many that are not married. They still living. They are not dead yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have not frozen to death. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So in as much as we can we can read it, you know, and and encourage couples, we can read it and encourage people and say, "Well, get married. The Bible says that." But you cannot reduce that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord &gt;&gt; to that alone. And and that is and that is some of the things that I really want to get to here. That is some of the things that I want to get to. And as we look into this sparring partners, hope that I can be able to finish it today. I will ask one question. What is our principal responsibility as humans, as creatures of God? What is our principle responsibility? I believe our principal responsibility, our purpose of being alive is to glorify the father. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh the the the principle reason why God made everything like like David was said, the heavens declare the glory of God. &gt;&gt; It glorify God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; The snow that is falling glorify God. We don't like it. God like it. He made it for it to for it to glorify him. &gt;&gt; So the principle reason why we were made is to glorify the father. &gt;&gt; If we miss that we miss our purpose of life. &gt;&gt; Every other things can be our achievement. We achieved this, we achieved that. But what is the purpose? &gt;&gt; What is our principle responsibility? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Jesus will say in St. John 15:8, he says, "Yay in is my father glorified &gt;&gt; that ye bear much fruit." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if if if if if our purpose is to glorify the father, then we must be able to bring forth those fruits. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We must be able to bring forth those fruits that will glorify &gt;&gt; the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you are you grabbing my my line of thoughts here? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because we've been looking at this subject. The purpose of redemption uh h or the work of redemption is is partnership. Last last uh uh Sunday we talked read a quote where brother Brandham says uh you know uh Satan was was a co-artner to God and we show his co-artnership because there is no evil. evil do not proceed out of God. So God has to make a creature that will be responsible for for for evil. So in that way he was he was made a partner with God because the evil that will proceed out of him will bring out God's attribute. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just like your tool, your tool is your partner to get the job done. You have the knowledge, but if you don't have the stru the the boat is not going to come out, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the the the the the wrench or whatever tools you are using become a partner for you to get the boat done. But when that work is done, you throw that partner down. You have brother Johnny that is helping you and he's a partner that you can travel with. You only knew need is true for that job done but you need brother Johnny for your to be able to go along with. So on this side God has his attribute. He has his children as his partner. On this other side he has the devil that is a tool just a partner to use in in in in certain situation. He will throw him down for but for you and myself is eternity. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our partnership we go along with the father through eternity. &gt;&gt; So we were looking at that. It is in that sense that brother Brandon call him a co-artner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would tell you truth. I was listening to this message that we going to read now one of the morning uh uh while I was there in South Africa. That's that's what brought me into this whole partner thing here. And I was listening to this message, super sign. Brother Brandham said this and and it really blessed me that morning. I I I remember reading it to to the congregation there in South Africa. Listen to this. He said, "But Abraham, if you can catch it, praise the Lord." Are you ready to catch it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have your gloves on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And are you in position? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; A catcher got to position himself &gt;&gt; to really catch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't position yourself, you fall over your head. Now he says if you can catch it, he have faith in God. Abraham have faith in God. Listen to this. which united the spirit of God with his flesh. Abraham faith in God united the spirit of God with his body. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Your faith in God unites you with the spirit of God &gt;&gt; and then it has effect and then your body express it. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture? &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance of thing hoped for. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Faith, can you believe it? That is the only thing that we have to go to heaven. &gt;&gt; The only thing we have for a resurrection is faith. &gt;&gt; Show it to me. You can't do it visibly. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot do it visibly. &gt;&gt; But you believe it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh, I believe it so so well this morning that I hang my life on it that if I drop dead here this morning, in the next minute I'll be in a brand new body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I mean, you believe it. That's the reason why you live for it. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why YOU TIE THE PURPOSE OF YOUR LIFE TO it because you believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, see what he's saying. Your faith, your faith in God unite with the spirit of God or it unite the spirit of God with your flesh. Let's let's read on a little bit here. Amen. There is where the faith comes. That is why he he could be the Abraham seed. Not all flesh, but their uniting of the spirit and the flesh together. The uniting of the spirit and the flesh together. And what do what do that uniting? What does it &gt;&gt; your faith? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what your faith does. As you hear the word of God, as you hear the promise of God, faith is built in you. And what it does is that a a a a it create an avenue for the spirit of God to bring that promise of God to pass in your flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is not it is not reasoning. It's not just mental conception. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, it's not just mental conception. It's not it's not it's not being intellectual either. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Oh, I just I just pray that this can become real to you. I can stop right here, spend the rest of the morning here, and then uh and then we can go home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because this is this is where our Christian faith, all of the things that we are doing, believing God, believing in his promises, looking for the supernatural, wanting God to work on our behalf, wanting God to make himself known. This is the way it happens. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your faith in God will unite the spirit of God with your flesh. &gt;&gt; It's not you practicing to be good. &gt;&gt; It's not you practicing to be holy. That's the same thing with divine healing. Your faith in God is going to unite YOUR BODY WITH THE PROMISE of God and wake it out of sickness. &gt;&gt; Oh man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe another preacher can come and tag me up and preach this thing better and and then just run it home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There is why he could be the the the being. But Abraham see not all flesh but the uniting of the spirit and the flesh together. God, man. God making himself tearing out, rooting out all evil, bringing into summation the flesh, &gt;&gt; the dust that he created, this dust, &gt;&gt; rooting out all evil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Evil desire, evil thought, How is he doing it? He's using your faith. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus would say, "Be it unto you I calling to your faith." &gt;&gt; LET YOUR FAITH OPERATE THE WORD OF GOD IN your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; LET YOUR FAITH OPERATE. Oh my god. I'm trying to see how I can how I can how I can preach this thing. Lord, help me this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; THAT THAT'S THE CHRISTIAN LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's the Christian life. That is the thing that is HAPPENING TO US EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we play down on the word of God, there is no way THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL UNITE WITH THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; When we take the word of God not to be real, not to be present, not to be true, THERE IS NO WAY that the spirit of God will will unite to death. Listening to brother Brand this morning, coming to church, a a spirit of truth. And he's talking about how uh he told those brothers there, there's going to be a carbo there on the hill. He's going to get a a a a grace band and all of that s and and and the brother is telling him, "Look, I have haunted on THIS MOUNTAIN ALL OF MY LIFE. I HAVE NEVER seen anything." He said, "But God told me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, are you GOING TO JUST DWELL on what you know? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. than letting go what you know AND ALLOWING THE SPIRIT OF GOD TO UNITE WITH YOU. TAKING GOD'S WORD THAT GOD is more than able. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh &gt;&gt; man. &gt;&gt; Oh man. When we talk about this partnership, it looks like we are trying to recruit members for good sheeperd fellowship, but that's not exactly what it is. What it is is that God is the one that is recruiting his people that will be able to stand for him in this day. People that will believe the WORD OF GOD, THAT'S PART OF WHAT IS HAPPENING around their life. &gt;&gt; And they will hold to God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the prophet of God says your body will obey your confession, &gt;&gt; that's what he's talking about. &gt;&gt; When your faith can hold to God's word, UNTIL YOUR BODY obey your confession, &gt;&gt; because your your body is confessing what God's word says. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I feel like reading it again. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Do it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel like reading it again. I was just I was just I just I just relied on this one code for the rest of the meeting. And and I just thank the Lord that he just he he I was pressing my clothes and trying to get myself ready and just listening. And brother Brandham said I said, "What did he says? My faith &gt;&gt; unite with the spirit of God." &gt;&gt; No, no. Let let me go back and see what he said. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. It changed my life. It really affected my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It really affected my life. If you can catch it, he have faith in God which united the spirit of God with with with the flesh of man. There is where faith comes. The faith comes. There is why he could be the seed of Abraham. Not all flesh, but the uniting of spirit and flesh together. God making himself tearing out, rooting out all evil, bringing into subjuggestion the flesh, the dust that he created. The flesh which is the dust that he created &gt;&gt; and live with you as a partner. &gt;&gt; That's how God get his partners &gt;&gt; in all the ages. That's how he his partners is not church membership. His partner is not how many years you've been in the message. &gt;&gt; His partner is when he can be able to unite your faith with his with his word, with his spirit AND BRING YOUR BODY ON A SUBJECTION. &gt;&gt; That's how he gets his partners. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say Lord, make me your partner. &gt;&gt; Oh, make me your partner, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let let let my let my let my faith Lord unite, oh God, with your spirit &gt;&gt; that it can bring the desires of my flesh on a subjuggestion. Amen. &gt;&gt; That it can bring my mind and all the negativity, all the negative energy in me. Yes, &gt;&gt; he can bring it under suggestion. &gt;&gt; Make me your partner. That's the kind of a partnership we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of a partnership we're talking about. Oh my. Oh, glory be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God we serve. You love the Lord this morning. Is there is there is there any is there any in uh uh uh confusion? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you have a question? And then write your question down and and send it. Let's uh you know let's let's answer your question if there's a question that comes in your mind concerning this. Now, so when we started this, I read something that brother Brand said in the message uh spoken word is the original seed and uh and I'm I'm still laboring with that in this subject to be able to to to bring that to you because now remember now our principal responsibility our principle responsibility is to glorify the father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our question in everything that we do, &gt;&gt; are you glorifying the father? &gt;&gt; Is the father getting glory &gt;&gt; out of what you are doing? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whether you are at work, whether you are at home, &gt;&gt; is the father getting glory &gt;&gt; out of what you are doing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because that is our our our principal purpose. Now, so we want to look at this. We want to look at this because just like just like I was telling you, I was listening to to to that I mean studying on that thing and brother B was talking about some things there in the message on setting song one of the series that he preached and I mean he was just he was talking about the uncertainty of times that we are living in. Talk about how our national security is uncertain. Our job is uncertain. He says uh uh uh uh even even family life is uncertain. &gt;&gt; Yes. He said family life is uncertain and and I mean he goes right into it. You know uh uh people divoring and all sorts of things and you talk about church life, people walking away from the faith and I mean he was just he was just talking about those things and I was just sitting there. I was saying oh my god this prophet of God is speaking in 1961 &gt;&gt; but addressing exactly what is happening in our land. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's speaking in 1961, but as addressing exactly what is happening in Abu Dh. I mean, I can go I can go back there and just read some of some of those things to you. Yeah. Uh uh and it will take much of our time. But he gets down and just talk about the uncertainty. The uncertainty that is that is just around us. Talk about how people are so afraid and they are digging holes and and trying to find safety in the earth. He says one of those those miser bombs can blast the whole earth and and get your bunger from under the earth. And I mean he's talking about all of these things and and uh uh uh you know and and and and and you just look at our time that we are living in and you see s uh man you see you see people uh you know uh uh people are crossing the border trying to go to to to Canada hoping that they can get you know uh a peaceful stay there. You get Canada has his own problem. Amen. He has his own problem. You know &gt;&gt; people, God sent us a prophet. &gt;&gt; We are honored a prophetic voice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know how much your faith has rised up to believe that Malachi 4 is the voice of God of this age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I know uh uh uh the media is waring against it and all sorts of thing is worrying, blasting people mind. But I'm I'm telling you this morning that God sent us a prophet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If I ever come back to you and tell you that brother Brandham is not a prophet, don't believe me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't believe me? Stay with your faith. Let me go with my error &gt;&gt; because it would definitely be a spirit of error on me. And an age of information is just filling our minds. We are in we are in an information age. We are in an information age. You can search it out, you will find it. And that is the thing that is just that is that is uh is is is is conflating. It's conflicting because lot of the things that are said in the Bible, a little year, a little day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A little year and a little day. And the scriptures will tell us something and don't give us the the entire story. And now if our society now bring that thing on question, we have lot of scientific proof &gt;&gt; to fight against just one verse in the Bible. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I read uh uh uh Mark chapter 6 this morning, as I was studying, I was I was looking into some commentary and uh uh you go back to Mark chapter 6 and tell you that Jesus came back to his own hometown where he grew up and all the people says is this not a carpenter son? is not his brother's uh uh and sisters called or his family name because Jesus is teaching in the temple and they are wondering where did he got this knowledge from. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We were right here. We saw him growing up. &gt;&gt; For most of his life he was behind that wooden box in that carpenter shop. We never saw him going to school. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and you really think about it is that uh we believe the Lord Jesus as our savior. You know, we we we hang our life on the testimony of his LIFE AND HIS RESURRECTION. BUT THIS BIBLE DID NOT REALLY tell us a lot about his upbringing. &gt;&gt; You read in the gospel, you really don't find some of the things of his upbringing. Do you know why God b God tithe in prophecy? &gt;&gt; Oh, it blew my mind this morning. Let me share with you a little bit. &gt;&gt; I know I'm completely out of what I'm supposed to be preaching this morning, but u if I tell you once, I don't have to tell you again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; At least God will know that I try my effort to tell you. Psalm chapter 69. Psalm chapter 69. Amen. Psalm chapter 69. Let's first look at this verse. We'll get back to the whole thing. Verse 9. Psalm chapter 69:9 the Bible says, "For the zeal of thy house have eaten me up, and the reproach of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me." St. John chapter 2. I'm just supposed to preach my message. Go ahead. You already said I've come come here. And u St. John chapter 2. If you look in St. John chapter 2, you realize that the Bible says from verse 14, he found in the temple those that that sold oxins and sheep and dove and the changes of money sitting. And the Bible says, "And when he had made a scotch of small call, he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and and and pour out the changes of money and overthrew the temple and said unto them that sold dove, take these things hands, make not my father house, a house of merchandise." Listen to this now. and his disciple remember that it was written, "The zeal of the house has eaten me up." Let me see if I can be able to bring this to us this morning in a way that you can be able to capture it. Yes, Jesus. David said this hundreds of years ago. They had read it in B in Sunday school. They read it in the chapel and everything. That day when Jesus came into the temple and he took his whip and started whipping this man up, the spirit of the Lord, the Holy Ghost brought to their mind that this what he's doing is what David said. When David said in the psalm that the zeal of the house has eaten me up, this is the fulfillment of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so you think about that. When you when you just think about that, then you realize that it was not only the zeal of the house has eaten me up. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT DAVID said in the psalm that was concerning him. &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 69. Let's go back there. Praise the Lord. Oh man. Lord, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalm chapter 69. Now you can read the whole psalm. You realize that this this this psalm brings out some places in Jesus upbringing that you never that we would never never never think about. It starts right here. Save me, oh God, for the waters are come up. The waters are come in unto my soul. I sink in a deep mar where there is no standing. I am coming to deep waters where the floor I am wary of my crying. My throat is dried, my eyes, they that hit me without a cause are more than the head of my hand. They thou will destroy me being uh uh being my enemy wrongfully I might then I restore that which I took not away. Oh God that knoweth my foolishness my sin. Let not them that wait on thee, oh my Lord of hosts, be ashamed for thy sake. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he starts to talk here now about the reproaches when you drop down here to verse seven. Because for that sake I have borne reproach. Shame has covered my face. I become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother's children. And then we read that verse there. When I weep and casting my soul with fasting, that that was to my reproach, I make cyclops also my gardening, and I became a proverb to them. They that sat in the gates speak against me. And I was a son of the drunker. You check David live, you will never find these things. You will never find it. But if you check Jesus life, you will find it. Do you know what it was to be growing when nobody would believe that Mary saw an angel? The man that sat at the gate, even the drunkers, they make music out of his birth. vulgar music they made out of his birth. Can you can you imagine that? The kind of a reproach that came that came on him. You see, I made cycl my garment and I became a proverb. things that people will say they will make all sorts of slogan all sorts of things they will say about the creator when when you just read some of David's psy and and you really getting it you realize that uh honor prophecy the same way he prophesied the zeal of the house has eaten up and the disciples could remember by the spirit of God bringing back to their mind that this is the one that David was speaking about and And there are other things written right in this psalm that the Holy Ghost can help us to see that those things were never said about David. It was never said about David. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not treated that way. David never came to firm until he came out there and challenged Goliath. And when he challenged Goliath, nobody never said evil about David. Nobody even thought about his childhood. They knew him as the giant killer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the songs that he sang, the proverbs that they make about David was always a hero. He was always a hero. &gt;&gt; He was a man that took shame from our face. &gt;&gt; When Saul and his men COULD NOT DO ANYTHING, GOD GAVE US A LITTLE BOY. THAT WAS WHAT THEY SAID about David. What about our Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; They make proverb concerning his birth. Can you imagine that? All they knew about him was just a capital sun. &gt;&gt; That's all they knew about him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That even he comes back to his own city, he can feed it. He can feed the rejection because it's on the minds of the people. They can never get over what they have perceived him to be. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT HE RAISED a Jara's daughter or whatever they said, when he comes back to his own city, he meet the same old news. &gt;&gt; He meet the same old ideas of the people. &gt;&gt; What they think of him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They can never go beyond that. Said a prophet is without honor except in his own hometown. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, may God just help us this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read there. The spoken word is the original seed. Like I said, I try to find a place to close this because from the beginning when we talk about uh uh uh God's partnership from the beginning, I was trying to bring to us to understand that when God made man in Genesis chapter 1 26 he made man male and female created he them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He make man male and female created he them. So he make two identity. He make two uh uh uh uh uh and and and there's a reason and we see right there that even from from the first thought of bringing forth himself in flesh, he brought them as a partner made and female. Praise the Lord. And the Bible would tell us in Genesis chapter 7, he made man out of the dust of the earth, but the female was not around. And there will be a time where God God himself will say it was not good for the man to be alone because in his purpose in his plan of redemption two is better than one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In his plane of redemption partnership, a man cannot be partner to himself. In the plan of redemption, it was all built on partnership. God will raise up his attributes to be partner to him. I'm going to say some things to you this morning and it's uh I hope that you be able to take it in good faith &gt;&gt; and understand it. &gt;&gt; So when he brought the woman as a helpmate, praise the Lord. You have to realize, like I said, it was not Adam that was wanting a helpmate. IT WAS GOD THAT was bringing a helpmate. For what purpose? For his purpose. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; For this great picture that was in his mind. So if if our if our principal responsibility, our purpose is to GLORIFY THE FATHER. ADAM WAS GLORIFYING the father in one way and the way he was glorifying the father is to name the animals and and name the creation and name he was displaying God that way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER HAD THE ABILITY to display the the the redemptive nature of God. &gt;&gt; He never had it. He never HAD THE ABILITY TO DISPLAY GOD as a healer. it was not in him. &gt;&gt; SO HE HAD HIS PURPOSE AND NOW GOD HAS TO BRING THE WOMAN ON the scene for her to also display her own h attributes that that that that was going to be displayed through her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She was going to meet her own purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. AND THROUGH HER, THE ATTRIBUTE OF GOD BEING A SAVIOR, A HEALER, a deliverer, and all of these things will be manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we seeing it? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, YOU REALIZE THAT GOD HAS A PURPOSE FOR EVERY ONE OF US. &gt;&gt; And the beautiful thing about it then is that it's unique. &gt;&gt; Sure. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's very unique. &gt;&gt; It's when we can be able to see in THE NEXT PERSON OR HELP THEM THAT THEY CAN BE ABLE TO GLORIFY GOD. &gt;&gt; That God can BE ABLE TO GET GLORY OUT OF THEIR LIFE. I must be able TO HELP YOU FOR GOD to be able to get glory out of your life. I mean uh uh uh uh your glory is not attached to mine. &gt;&gt; Let me say it that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE SELFISH OF ME JUST TO WARN ALL OF THE PRAISE. Y'ALL PUT MY NAME IN the song when we are singing. LET'S SAY BROTHER ONE, LET'S I mean, LET'S LET LET IT JUST BE LET IT JUST I MEAN IT IS VERY SELFISH BECAUSE THAT THAT IS NOT GOD'S PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; HE WANT TO GET GLORY FROM EACH AND EVERY ONE OF OUR individual lives. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO OUR PURPOSE IN partnership &gt;&gt; is TO BE ABLE TO HELP ONE ANOTHER THAT THE FATHER WILL BE GLORIFIED IN YOU AND YOU WILL HELP ME THAT THE FATHER WILL BE GLORIFIED IN ME. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see when the devil introduced his idea in Genesis 3, you have to know that Satan idea is &gt;&gt; seage. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE THAT INTRODUCED THIS IDEA WHERE WE think the purpose of the woman is for the man to be glorified. See what brother Brandham said. My my my my &gt;&gt; see what he says here. Spoken word is the original seed. All of God's songs must be the same. Yes, sir. To be born of the word and the spirit bring us back to the spoken word again. Like John chapter 3, you must be born again. He said to be born of the of the word and the spirit, it bring us back. It bring us back to the spoken word again. To be born of the water and the spirit, what does what does it do? It will bring you right back again onto the place of where you should have been at the beginning. See, that is the reason for Christ's death. bring us back again toward sons of God. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this now. This is where he says this. If Eve, if Eve will have brought forth that child, she will have finally done it. Praise the Lord, the virgin shall conceive. Eve will have done it. It will have brought forth a child without sex. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS IN IT WAS IN THE PURPOSE THAT GOD DESIGNED FOR HER. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. SO YOU SEE, EVEN THOUGH SHE FAILED, GOD STILL CAME BACK IN GENESIS 3:15 and said, "The seed of the woman &gt;&gt; will bruise the head of the serpent." &gt;&gt; Because in God's mind, THE WOMAN WAS GOING TO BRING A seed without man intervention. &gt;&gt; That was what was in God's mind. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HER MAKEUP WAS TIED TO REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I think many of us we are operating on a Genesis chapter 3. We need to go back before Genesis chapter 3 because that's where the the actual and original marriage uh covenant was was. It was not in Genesis chapter 3. Genesis chapter 3 was WHAT THE SERPENT INTRODUCED TO US. And then when we come to this place where we we we we strive with one another and and and then we put pressure on our husbands and put pressure on our wives and we think that yeah yeah you know that and we quote all of this scripture and then in most cases it is just our own selfishness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just our own selfishness. You you see right there Paul will speak in Corinthian where he will say that uh when when a when a man is is is not married he he served the Lord better. He gave his service to the Lord. NOW IF HE'S MARRIED HE HAS TO BRING THAT SERVICE ALSO through his wife. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why you find that uh sometimes in many cases you will realize that oh so it a destroy family a throw home whom a PART IT AFFECTS THE LIFE OF THE CHILDREN. But when a man has has his faith rooted in God and in the word of God or the woman has her faith rooted in the word of God if a man will will abandon her she will still serve the Lord. And if God give her grace, she will still live up to that purpose of glorifying God. &gt;&gt; Cuz she's not going to get crazy and say, "Why he leave me?" So she start running around with every man. No, she will realize that she has a higher purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She has a higher purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even a man if the wife misbehave and and just RUN AWAY HE REALIZED THAT oh well okay this was part of it but the first HE WILL STILL LIVE HONORABLE. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THERE IS A HIGHER PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But you see when we run our life ON GENESIS CHAPTER 3 WHICH IS THE SERPENT SEED. When we run our life on a debt, then all we do is that we just we want to destroy one another. &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE WE THINK OUR LIFE is just tied to Satan purpose and not to God's purpose. &gt;&gt; MAN WAS GIVEN HIS responsibility before Genesis chapter 3. MAN WAS GIVEN HIS PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when Genesis chapter 3 comes, we we we bring all of those things to our own self-gratification, our own selfishness. We want to be worshiped. Either the man want to be worshiped now as the king or the woman must be worshiped as the queen. And then we leave God out of the picture. &gt;&gt; If you leave God out of the picture, it's three calls. Solomon says that will not be broken. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Three calls that is bound together. That's what that is that is not broken. And that's what that's what we have to see. Our calling is to be able to EDIFY ONE ANOTHER, EMPOWER ONE ANOTHER, STRENGTHEN one another to be able to meet their purpose. &gt;&gt; LET ME HELP YOU. SO, SO, SO, SO YOU CAN BRING GLORY TO GOD. HELP ME. LET ME BRING GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Not one person wanting the glory. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because our PURPOSE IS TO BRING GLORY TO THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; You watch over the life. You find that you find that in many many successful people life. The moment they start becoming successful and the success is only tied to one party, the next party get jealous. &gt;&gt; It's only this person name the person feel that I'm not part of the success. So the next thing they try to do is either let's split it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I can go and build my own foundation and call it h Jeremiah foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can stay with yours Susanna Foundation. &gt;&gt; Because I want I want my name to be here also. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is the reason why it will be an evil thing young people for you to tie the purpose of your life to a man that you don't know about &gt;&gt; or a woman that you don't know about &gt;&gt; saying to yourself that when I get married &gt;&gt; TIE YOUR PURPOSE TO JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; AND KNOW THAT IF GOD GIVE YOU A PARTNER I WILL DO THE BEST FOR HIM TO GLORIFY GOD. I want him to do the BEST FOR ME TO GLORIFY GOD. &gt;&gt; But if you just you just you just make yourself like you don't have life. There is no future for you because this special person has not come. The special person is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The one that have show you decency. &gt;&gt; That's the special person. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then whoever come along, we work together &gt;&gt; to glorify this Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; WE WORK TOGETHER TO GLORIFY THIS JESUS CHRIST THAT PUT THE VALUE UPON MY LIFE THAT you saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S HOW GOD DESIGNED IT. &gt;&gt; HE said his glory he will give to no man. That's right. &gt;&gt; He don't want YOU AS A SON OF GOD GIVING HIS GLORY TO YOUR WIFE. &gt;&gt; NEITHER DOES HE WANT THE WIFE GIVING HIS GLORY TO YOU. &gt;&gt; NO, we must bring the glory to the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must bring it to the father. &gt;&gt; It help us to be able to identify the unique ways that God has built us &gt;&gt; because we are all not built the same. &gt;&gt; We are not controlled by a remote. We are controlled by a divine presence of God. &gt;&gt; And when we can BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT AND BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND BE ABLE TO PRAY for one another and be able to appreciate THE UNIQUE WAY THAT GOD HAS BEEN ABLE to to make us because he's the God of varieties. &gt;&gt; HE'S A GOD OF VARIETIES. HIS BUCKET HAS DIFFERENT COLOR flowers and different shapes. That's the way he designed man. &gt;&gt; And that's the thing that is carrying our generation so crazy. So crazy. They put their life on hold. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THIS SPECIAL PERSON. WHEN THIS SPECIAL person come the whole thing, it become a different story. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It become a different story. Do you know what it is? When you when you start TO REALIZE THAT MY PURPOSE in this life is to glorify THE FATHER AND I'M GOING TO GLORIFY HIM IN EVERYTHING THAT HE PLACED IN MY HAND WHATEVER THAT COMES BEFORE ME THE BEST THAT I CAN DO. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT COMPARING MYSELF TO ANYBODY. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE ANYBODY. I don't want to be a superstar. I don't want to be anybody on the internet. I want to be me. &gt;&gt; I want TO BE A SON OF GOD THAT IS ME THAT CAN live like me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; give me grace." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me grace and help me. &gt;&gt; When I fail, I come back and say, "Lord, help me. I'm failing. &gt;&gt; I realize I'm not bringing I'm not bringing glory to you in the things that I'm doing." &gt;&gt; I'm becoming selfish in my attitude. &gt;&gt; I'm becoming selfish in my ways. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you hear my If two young people comes with that idea, &gt;&gt; their life is so driven by glorifying God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And they can look at this person and says, "Well, you you I mean, why you stop your prayer life? I'm not seeing you praying. I'm not seeing you reading the word." &gt;&gt; These are all OF THE THINGS YOU WERE DOING BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED. WHY YOU STOP doing it? Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY THAT GOD DESIGNED IT. &gt;&gt; That's his design. &gt;&gt; But you see the same thing that people do, they do the same thing. We feel like the church need us more than we need the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So if they make BBS, I'm not even going back to that place. That church said is not that not the only church you that's that's the kind of an attitude that people feel that they have take the word and correct them they get angry &gt;&gt; they can find another place and go praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is the same thing that we do. We bring that thing right into our relationship into our lives. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE GET A JOB, we feel like we need this job. &gt;&gt; I need this job to pay my bill. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So everything at a job is Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because you feel like you need it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When it comes to our home and our livelihood, the church of God know they need you. So they have to beg. Brother, we didn't we are not seeing you in church. We are not seeing you in a few days. Yeah, bro. You need to be in church, man. Praise the Lord. What kind of a biblical pattern is that? Son of God, I will beg you to to to fulfill your divine purpose. that we should beg you to come to church. &gt;&gt; Well, I've not been in church for one week. Nobody call me. Who did you call that you were not coming to church? &gt;&gt; Whom you told that you were not coming. BUT THAT IS THE MENTALITY that the church needs you because why? You feel like you are a member. You only do those things in clubs and organization. Why? Because you are donating to them. They need your donation. &gt;&gt; So if if they don't see you, they have to call you so you can bring your donation. &gt;&gt; You don't do that to the to the to the the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Do that to the house of God where you supposed to know you are a son of God. You have a purpose. And God gave you a little body, a little boy CALLED A CHURCH WHERE YOU SUPPOSED TO COME AND AND AND AND HELP THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You want to be so special that we should beg you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we bring those things into our home. Something will go wrong. WE SHOULD SIT DOWN AS AS FAMILY AND TALK FOR THE BETTERMENT of our home. He says no you will have to beg me and before you really realize you are destroying what's supposed to be a divine structure &gt;&gt; was supposed to be that something that God ordained through which you will be able to glorify himself we destroy it on the basis of our own selfishness &gt;&gt; because We want to be the person in the room. We should be the person that should be praised. We should be the person that should be thanked. We should be the person. Then we are the person that we are worshiping. Then &gt;&gt; why you say you worshiping God? When you have set yourself on the throne as God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why he redeem us from sin and make us better. He's making us better so we can bring better praise to him. &gt;&gt; Because if he make us BETTER AND GIVE US RIGHTEOUSNESS, WE WILL LIVE A RIGHTEOUS life and people will see our life and glorify the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WORK. WE MAKE GOD BETTER AND HE MAKE US BETTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T MAKE GOD LIKE A GOD THAT DON'T KEEP his promises. Praise the Lord. EVEN IF IT IS NOT HAPPENING, WE SHOUT ON THE HELL AND SAY, "I KNOW MY GOD IS ABLE." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I know he's able. &gt;&gt; Because he's an able. He's a able God. &gt;&gt; We have reduced the righteous commandments of God to our selfish ambition, our unconverted ambition. That's the reason why sometimes when we are trapped in things we don't know how to come out &gt;&gt; because we have failed ourself with our own you know our own selfishness. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a what a mighty God we serve. Oh what a mighty God we serve. But says Eve will have brought that child if she did not listen to the serpent, she will have brought even though she failed, God still came back and said the woman will have a seat. Why? Why he had to say that? Because it was his thought concerning her. Even though she failed, he will still have a woman that will be a virgin that will bring forth a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that was his purpose for her life. &gt;&gt; God don't turn his back on us when we fail. &gt;&gt; When we fail in our purpose, &gt;&gt; he don't say get up from here, you fail. &gt;&gt; He stand back. He want to watch you as a son and as a daughter and see what your attitude will be. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you really believe in your purpose? &gt;&gt; Because it's God that has the purpose. Do you really believe in it? When you believe in it, then you go back to God and say, "Oh God, have mercy on me. I HAVE FAILED YOU, LORD. REDEEM ME. RESTORE ME." &gt;&gt; Then God step on the scene. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And starts to bring that thing through you. AND BECAUSE YOU REALIZE YOU FAIL, you become so humble. You say, "Lord, I'm not watching for you to use me. Oh God, I FAIL YOU." BUT YET STILL YOU TRUST ME. &gt;&gt; The kind of a God we serve. The same way we we operate with our selfish purpose, we apply it to God because we are selfish. So we think that he's selfish. When we fail, then we say, "Lord, God will not use me again. I don't think he can ever make anything out of me again." Praise the Lord. Then we start going away from the Lord and start going away from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But God is determined in his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's determined. Very determined in his purpose. &gt;&gt; Very determined &gt;&gt; in his purpose. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Very determined in his purpose. Her last uh uh Sunday, a good friend, good friend of mine, a preacher, uh the brother Steven that brought us the the goat. We went to Liber. Yeah. Good friend of mine. He went to be with the Lord. died in in an accident and I was so told yesterday I mean last Sunday didn't leave for me. I was so tall cuz I just spoke with him and um and I really had on my heart to talk to him about something that I heard and I I was so when he called me, he called me from Nigeria because he was there. His son was getting married and he called me and I I told him I said we spoke a little bit and I says, "Yeah, I really need to talk to you when you get back home. Call me." And uh uh we never got talk. He he died on on Christmas Eve. And I I just I was just so so troubled and I just felt like well okay I think the Lord knew best and the Lord took care of him. The Lord took care of him. Living in such a time of uncertainty you know think but they have very good brother good brothers. He moved to one of the region of our country that he started work there and uh lately I heard he's you know he was uh uh he have moved to another area start another church and and he was going to dedicate some instruments that are bought and all that and and his life came to an end but we have to realize God's purpose of our life is far above all our human achievement all of the things that we can achieve and all of the things that we can do, all of the names that we can make for ourself. We have to understand what his purpose is. That's the thing that when you grab it brings satisfaction. It bring you to a place of rest because you realize that I think this is what he want me to do. I think this is where this is this is this is the reason why I was born. This is what he designed me for. It brings such a rest. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I might never get to the place to have all of the things that uh uh really desired in this life. But just to know that he loved me, &gt;&gt; just to know that he thought of me, just to know that he designed a purpose in his economy for me. &gt;&gt; That is more than enough. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That is more than enough. And whatever I will do that the father will be glorified. And in the same word, I will be able to encourage others to be able to hit their own purpose. It's not like forget what you doing. You focus on me and just me now and me now and me. That's selfishness. That's selfishness. That's the that's that's that's Genesis chapter 3 that was introduced by the serpent sea. That's not God's intended purpose. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the word help me that word has just we have used it all sorts of way around the message. But really go instead of look at that word, really go and look at the the the the concordance and and see that when the when the Bible says the Lord is my help is the very same root word where that word help me comes from. The Lord is my help. So if God gave a man gave a man a wife to be a helpmate, it is not just only for his purpose. He sees somebody through whom the Lord is my help. And in any way that God will use her to be a help to bring you on your knees and straighten your life up, God will do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. One time he gave Moses a stubborn one. &gt;&gt; And she said, "What a bloody husband you are. You're running after the commission and your sons are not even circumcised." And the prophet of God will come and tell us that if there were not a zapora, there would not be a Moses. &gt;&gt; Oh people, God didn't send us a message to make a religion. God sent us a message to bring us in relationship with him for us to be able to understand his mind and understand his purpose for our life. The thing that will give our life a meaning is not just to join a church and get a certain dress code. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Well, I I hope that uh I labor with you today to be able to to bring a certain level of honesty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right from the beginning, he make man male and female. Right from there, that's God's in everything he needs. He needs a partner. He partnership us in every way. &gt;&gt; Give us two hands so one can help the other. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He gave us two feet so one can help the other. Two ears. So if this ear don't hear what this they are saying here this one will hear it &gt;&gt; and even the way that he designed our body he design it in a way of partnership. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God may he be able to find a partner in you. &gt;&gt; May God be able to find a partner in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God be able to partnership with himself with you &gt;&gt; to be able to bring forth his purpose, his desire to make it known in your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; For him to be able to make it known in your life. You look at the I was just thinking about the life of uh of uh of many many people uh many people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I was s watching a little documentary yesterday on u a single that I love, Dy Rambo. Me and my guest were watching it a little bit and and uh I've watched it before, but I was there was something that was on my mind I wanted to look at and uh in and uh uh You can you can see that all through the ages with different people that God used even with John Wesley. John Wesley dad Samuel was a very ragid Methodist preacher and he was just so such a rough man that he never helped. John had a sisters to have a successful marriage. None of them had a successful marriage. That's the reason why in the in the 17 children of Susanna Wesley, you only hear about John and Charles because their father and that thing affected John. It affected it affected John. He never got married on time. Never got married early because he affected him. He saw how his older sisters, you know, ran from one divorce to another. It affected him. So even when he got married, being the preacher, he got married to a lady that had a different she she had a different almost like a different vision. She was not caught like John to be able to support the ministry and all of that. She will lock that preacher up from traveling. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm telling you a true story. I mean it's all in the public domain. You can go and search it out. But you know what happened? John Wesley attributed the success of his ministry to his wife. He said every time she would do that, it would take him into praying. &gt;&gt; And he will cry to God and he will cry to God. That woman will pull John by the hair from one part of the room to the other. So there not only men can abuse, women, women can abuse also. &gt;&gt; Let me just leave you right there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But this what this is a churchish messenger. &gt;&gt; You see the pre the reason there is that John saw his purpose before he met his wife. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knew his purpose. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So there is nothing that she was doing, &gt;&gt; he was protecting his purpose. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW HE WAS TREATED, he kept his purpose. &gt;&gt; He knew he was called to preach the gospel. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; She would get mad. John is traveling and they will settle it and then he will travel again. But the final thing there is that the beauty of this picture he gave his wife his crown. He says I attribute the success of my ministry to her because she kept me on my knees. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he saw his purpose. Tony Rambo 8 years old. &gt;&gt; She was playing in the pool and and and the Lord just started to break. You you can even look at there look at the life of Fanny Crosby the very same thing. She was a gifted woman. Right. Right from a child, very gifted. She started writing songs. It would just come to her head, you know, compose. She would compose songs. The first song her mother told her, her mother said, "You pay a price for this." She said, "I as a little girl, I did not understand what mama meant. Because as a eight years old to compose, to have such a composition, it has to be a heavenly gift. &gt;&gt; Her daddy wanted her to play h rock and roll, country rock and roll music. And when she gave her heart to the Lord, she had to go away from home at 12 years old because she would not play for her daddy in the club. her father kick her out of the house. 12 years old, little girl going away and getting over there to a a little church. She started playing singing and the Lord was just blessing her life. A very same very same story with Fanny Crosby. If you if you ever read your life, you realize that that was where she met her husband. You see, he was attracted to her gift. &gt;&gt; It would have been better if he found his purpose. &gt;&gt; Well, he was attracted to her gift. They got married. They had a child. Uh because of complication, they couldn't have other children. But you have to real she you have to realize that this this this young lady just from a childhood you know she had this gift and as and as their music thing started to to to uh to grow up it's almost like he was feeling like he was left out because it was Dy Ramble they wanted to hear singing it was Dy Rambo And that affected him and he started to live wrong in their relationship. Oh, how how he almost destroy her life. She attempted to take her own life. But God in his mercy rescue her. After the second time, after the third time, she said, "I went down to a little creek, a little cabin, and just prayed and and cried to God, what is this happening to me?" And she realized that the Lord said because you stopped trusting me. And when she when she when she could just gain the courage to ask God for grace and mercy you see so these things happen. I read something here to you and then I close. I don't know how I got myself into this supposed to close ever since. But have brother Brandham said this morning. He said, "I'm so glad." He said, "From a young man, the Lord showed me this that I'm so glad that the Lord got a hold of me before the church." &gt;&gt; He said, "So, no matter how much how how bad the church treat me, &gt;&gt; I'm glad that the Lord got a hold of me." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what I would say is let the Lord get a hold of you before this message. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham in the message paradox he talks about a young man you know that was born in a certain family with a certain attitude and he says here I said that may be all right the the the the outall okay you are not seeing this all the outward motion he He might be identified as a believer with the believers. Identify as a believer because he's with the believer. But until he is regenerated, born again, I advise that the young man to never marry a woman, he will make hell on earth for her until that gentle, sweet, forgiving spirit of Christ comes in. &gt;&gt; Right? then that will be a paradox. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and many times that's what we are seeing because why people tie their purpose to marriage. Your purpose is not to marry. It's part of it. &gt;&gt; But that's not your purpose. You mean that the only reason why God made you is just to be a wife to somebody? &gt;&gt; You have they will have married you from the day you were born. &gt;&gt; If that was your purpose, we have hold you as a baby and do your wedding and turn you to your husband. But that's not your purpose. That was part of it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted you to be a daughter &gt;&gt; that will enjoy your daddy and enjoy your mommy. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he can be able to get glory out of your youthfulness. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be you to be a young lady where you can be able to glorify him with decency. &gt;&gt; When every young woman is ruining their life with one, two, three, five boyfriends, God will keep his hand on you for you to be a young woman. that says until I walk until I walk down thy eye and he got glory out of that and then he will want to bring you also into a relationship but not to be a slave to a man. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; No, he will also want you to glorify him with motherhood. Just like you glorify him with womanhood and you glorify him with your virgin saint, he will want you to glorify him with motherhood. And the purpose of your husband is to bring you to that place to give you all the support for you to be a successful mother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the very same thing with the man. He want you to to be a to be a father to be able to experience having a vision for the family and holding responsibility. Then you want the wife to be able to support you to be able to grab that vision. When a woman can be able to make the man the kind of a man that that she wants and a man makes the woman the kind of a woman that he wants is that when he faction in his mind and expect you to correct yourself quick quick quick just because of the fantasy of his mind. &gt;&gt; No. God bless you. God bless you. I I I want you to see the I want you to be able to grab the principle. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just get into this thing as if to say I'm I'm kind of angry. I'm, you know, I'm I'm I'm witch hunting somebody. I'm not witch hunting anybody. You see the the thing there is that it some of the things that grabbed you and you say, "Oh my god, why I didn't see this thing all along?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Why I didn't realize that this is what it is that this is what it is. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, can can you imagine for you for for you to expect me to be the kind of a pastor that you want me to be when you really did not make me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, I I would just be working on everybody remote control &gt;&gt; because it would just all to be at a place I want to satisfy you. And then I I gets to the place where I just I I want you to be the kind of a church that I want you to be. So you know what is going to make me an ANGRY PREACHER. EVERY SUNDAY I COME I GOING to be shouting. THE BROTHER BRANDON SAID 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE DOOR OPEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOWN there when I'm not helping you to bring you to church. I'm not contributing to how you are sustaining yourself through the week. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see? So which mean I have fashioned something in my mind &gt;&gt; and because I have faction it or maybe I'm looking at the other church that's what I'm looking at. So I create that picture in my mind now it makes me a frustrated preacher &gt;&gt; AND ALL I DO IS JUST COME and hear are the people. &gt;&gt; That's that's not the way God designed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, that's not the way God designed it. He designed it for me. IF IF IF THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT OF YOU, I I need to help to bring you there. &gt;&gt; I'm your helpmate &gt;&gt; just like you are my helpmate. &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come Sometimes you get all of these fantasy in your mind. I was listening to a young preacher that says how he complained about everything in the church. He complained how the preacher can preach long. He complained about this. He complained about that. When he finally became the pastor of that church, he realized how wrong he was. How wrong he was. That everything he was complaining about, it was just a fantasy in his mind. It was just a MENTAL WORKOUT FAR from the reality. And sometimes that's the way we are. We get things so woke up in our mind and it's far from the reality. Oh, let my faith let my faith unite my body with the spirit of God. My faith and my and the spirit of God uniting to be able to bring my body under subjection. Lord, I want to love you more than I ever have before. You are easier to adore. Lord, I want to love you more. Oh Lord, I want to love you more than I ever have before. You so easy to adore. Lord, I want to love you more. I want to praise you. Lord, I want to praise you more than I ever have before. You so wanted to be praised. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to praise you. Let's praise him now. Oh Lord, I want to praise you more than I ever have before. You worth to be praised. Lord, I want to praise. I want to serve you, Father. Yes, Lord. I want to serve you more than I ever have before. Serving you is such a joy. Lord, I want to serve you more. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I want to serve you more. than I ever have before. Serving you is such a joy, Lord. I want to serve you. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. I hope you understood. I hope I hope the grace of God help you to understand where I'm I'm going this uh this morning and uh uh I just pray that the Lord will will be able to deal with your heart and he will he will be able to to make the picture more clearer to you and then you'll be able to reveal reveal his purpose to you. When you grab that thing as the purpose of God and and you know your your life is settled on it, you will have disappointment here and you will have disappointment there and uh sometimes your children may not even turn out to be uh what you really want them to be. But in all of that, God will also help you to realize that he has a purpose for their life. And and and and and you trusting in his purpose. You are not the one that is driving everything. You you are looking to the father. You are believing the father. You know, you you are resting on the father. You know that uh with God, he can never fail. His purpose is never defeated. Even if you are you are disappointed in a certain areas of your life, he will come around and and make you to see the bigger picture. And then he will make you to rejoice. He will say I I I thank God that he have me in this place. I thank God that uh you know he's he he placed this person in my life. It's God's choosing. It's God's choosing. Even for us to be here is God's choosing. I came with a dravening desire in my heart to to go down to Lama, Ohio. I wanted to be there with Looney Jenkins and get so involved in mission and well I mean God wanted me to be here and when when it all get over he's going to ship my next destination. If we can just learn to look at our life from God's perspective, Lord, your purpose, the things that you have designed, the things that you have appointed for us. Let's bow our house together. Heavenly Father, Lord, just just caught up in this uh channel of thought, Lord. I can just go on Lord God in preaching. But Father, my my desire, Lord God, is that the people will be able to see it. Our responsibility to live every day is to glorify you. Every day, Lord God, when you give us the breath of life, every day, Lord, Father God, when you give us strength in our body, at the end of the day, can we sit down and be able to see how many fruits that we brought to the father? How was God glorified in the things that we did? Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Blessed be your name. Father Lord God. We have labored around this subject Lord. We have labored around this thought God. Father, Lord, our desire, Lord God, is that you would just be able to bring the internal ingredients, Lord, the internal thoughts out of it, Lord, Father, to help your children, oh God, and we have to go through trials in this life. And the moment we can understand it that is all part of God's purpose for our life. It bring us comfort. It bring us relief. We can say it there. We can say just like Shedra, Misha and Abednego. Even if the Lord do not deliver us, we will not deny him. But we know that our God is more than able. Father, I pray this afternoon, Lord God, that your grace, Lord, would just help every one of us, Lord. Everyone under the sound of my voice, oh God, Father, and even those, Lord Jesus, that will have the opportunity to follow the service, Lord, watching, oh God, I pray that Lord, you will be able to bring out, Father God, the internal thoughts, Lord, Father, that is behind this. That's what matters. That's what matters, Lord. That's what matters, oh God. Let's just forget about ourselves. I'll concentrate on him and worship him. Help me to forget about myself, concentrate on you and worship you. Oh, let us forget about ourselves. Concentrate on Christ and worship him. Worship him Jesus Christ. Father, may we go in the peace of the Lord, God. And we we continue to ask that, Lord. Father, may your presence, Lord, your your your ever abiding presence go with us, Lord, Father, as you promise to never leave us and never forsake us, oh God. Watch over your children as they travel back home safely. Watch over, oh God, Father. Lord, your people, oh God, that you, Lord God, will bless them, oh God. Father, Lord God, your grace will be with them, oh Lord. We ask oh father God you would just keep us from all the harm and danger Lord God that is around the city. The children will be going to work oh God Lord the ones going to schools. Oh father we just prayed keep us Lord keep us Lord Father only your arm of protection. Keep us away from harm and danger.
