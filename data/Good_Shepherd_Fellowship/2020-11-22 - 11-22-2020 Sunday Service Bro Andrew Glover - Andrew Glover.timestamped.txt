[59:25] lord you loved us when we was unlovable
[59:27] you called us lord when we was
[59:29] uncallable
[59:30] lord you you beckoned to our hearts and
[59:32] there was a seat there
[59:33] it was placed there for before the
[59:35] foundation of the world
[59:36] lord desiring that quickening power the
[59:39] holy ghost
[59:40] may you move here today father satan you

[1:00:01] name we ask

[1:00:06] amen god bless you this morning as you
[1:00:07] have your seats i want you
[1:00:09] by the help of the lord here just to
[1:00:11] speak to you for a few moments
[1:00:13] and if i would title this today i want
[1:00:15] to speak to you for a few moments here
[1:00:16] on
[1:00:16] lord i am thankful lord
[1:00:20] i'm thankful how many this morning we
[1:00:22] could just open up the service and say
[1:00:24] lord i'm thankful
[1:00:25] lord i'm thankful i i realize you've
[1:00:28] done a lot for me you
[1:00:29] you provided a lot for us you brought us
[1:00:32] through another year
[1:00:33] you sustained this through a world
[1:00:35] that's fallen apart through confusions
[1:00:37] through all kinds of things
[1:00:38] lord i'm thankful you've been good to me
[1:00:40] and i think of here how
[1:00:42] david in psalms 104 says enter into his
[1:00:45] gates with thanksgiving and into his
[1:00:47] courts with praise
[1:00:49] and be thankful unto him and bless his
[1:00:51] name now we all realize this morning
[1:00:53] that we are in the house of god we have
[1:00:55] gathered here
[1:00:56] in the house of god we've gathered here
[1:00:58] for one purpose that is to worship him
[1:01:00] that is to magnify him that is to
[1:01:03] amen to lift him up above all of our
[1:01:05] problems to lift him up above
[1:01:07] all the things we're going through and
[1:01:09] to bless his holy name and i think it's
[1:01:11] amazing how
[1:01:12] that david gives instructions on
[1:01:14] entering the house of god he actually
[1:01:16] gives us instructions
[1:01:17] he says when you come into where you've
[1:01:19] been invited to
[1:01:20] he said first of all recognize that this
[1:01:23] is his house amen
[1:01:24] recognize this as his gates and in other
[1:01:27] words david is saying
[1:01:28] amen be thankful that you've been
[1:01:30] invited into his gates
[1:01:32] be thankful that he's given you a
[1:01:34] privilege be thankful that he's given
[1:01:36] you a call
[1:01:37] amen to come into his house and then
[1:01:39] david shows you
[1:01:40] amen that when you come in here how you
[1:01:42] should come in
[1:01:43] amen you should come in with
[1:01:45] thanksgiving unto god
[1:01:46] amen with praise and blessings unto his
[1:01:49] name david knew
[1:01:51] amen that if praises went up then
[1:01:53] blessings would come down amen
[1:01:55] amen when praises go up amen blessings
[1:01:58] come down and to thank this morning
[1:02:00] church
[1:02:00] amen that we come to church too many
[1:02:02] times and we come
[1:02:03] even with all kinds of things on our
[1:02:05] mind the troubles and the situations and
[1:02:07] the trials and
[1:02:08] all the things we're going through we
[1:02:10] come with those things amen up on our
[1:02:12] mind and it's so easy
[1:02:13] amen to come in here and still be
[1:02:15] thinking about those things it's so easy
[1:02:17] they meant to be sitting there hearing
[1:02:19] the word amen and be thinking about all
[1:02:21] the troubles and all the things you're
[1:02:23] going through
[1:02:24] amen but to think here this morning amen
[1:02:26] that we have not come here to give our
[1:02:28] attention to the problems
[1:02:30] amen but we've come to give our
[1:02:31] attention to the problem solved
[1:02:33] amen we've not come here have been to
[1:02:36] talk about our troubles and talk about
[1:02:37] our problems
[1:02:38] amen but to remember that there is still
[1:02:40] a god amen that can change the situation
[1:02:44] my when i think of that i think of how
[1:02:45] the prophet says lord
[1:02:47] i am thankful i i am very thankful
[1:02:50] thanksgiving to you lord
[1:02:52] amen not for natural feud yet that but
[1:02:54] lord the end time is here
[1:02:56] amen how many will agree this morning
[1:02:58] the end time is here
[1:03:00] amen i'm thankful for this spiritual
[1:03:02] food amen amen lord the spiritual food
[1:03:05] of the seven seals was promised to be
[1:03:07] open you say that'll be something
[1:03:09] different no no
[1:03:10] you can't add one word it's already in
[1:03:13] there
[1:03:13] it's just he and it's sealed how many
[1:03:16] understands that say amen
[1:03:17] amen see well that's a mystery will come
[1:03:19] forth oh no
[1:03:21] it's already written you can't add
[1:03:24] one word to it or take one word from it
[1:03:26] it's in there
[1:03:27] already in there it's just got to be
[1:03:30] revealed in the last day
[1:03:32] amen now if we were living in any other
[1:03:34] day amen then that quote right there
[1:03:36] should not cause us to say amen
[1:03:38] if we was living in another age amen
[1:03:41] that quote would not inspire a praise to
[1:03:43] come out of our hearts
[1:03:44] amen but because we're living amen in
[1:03:47] the end time amen
[1:03:48] we're living in the last days amen well
[1:03:51] what is head
[1:03:52] has been revealed amen what right to
[1:03:55] shout and dance
[1:03:56] and rejoice in the spirit of god it's
[1:03:59] the bride you say why
[1:04:00] amen because the word has come open and
[1:04:03] it has produced a food
[1:04:05] it has produced a sustaining food it has
[1:04:08] produced a word that will change our
[1:04:10] bodies
[1:04:12] my i'll say it like the prophet said
[1:04:14] lord i'm thankful
[1:04:16] amen lord i'm thankful i'm thankful this
[1:04:18] morning

[1:04:23] not preaching from a mystery
[1:04:25] i'm thankful this morning that my god
[1:04:27] amen is not hid behind a veil
[1:04:30] amen but he sent a man by the name of
[1:04:31] william branham amen that would fulfill
[1:04:34] malachi 4
[1:04:35] and would fulfill revelation 10 and when
[1:04:37] fulfilled luke 17 30
[1:04:39] and would fulfill first thessalonians 4
[1:04:41] and would take the mighty god
[1:04:43] amen and unveil him before the church
[1:04:46] and say now church

[1:05:15] types of people

[1:05:18] people and then there's going to be an

[1:06:52] apple tree
[1:06:53] and the apples would beat him on the

[1:08:58] identification

[1:15:11] especially
[1:15:12] especially as the bride of the lord
[1:15:15] jesus christ
[1:15:16] i believe we should dwell in the spirit
[1:15:19] of thanksgiving
[1:15:20] amen i don't think we should be thankful
[1:15:22] amen one week out of the year
[1:15:24] no i don't think we should be thankful
[1:15:27] one service out of the year
[1:15:29] i don't think we should be thankful amen
[1:15:31] just on the sunday before thanksgiving
[1:15:33] or the sunday after
[1:15:35] thanksgiving but i think on the fourth
[1:15:37] of july we ought to be faithful
[1:15:39] i think in the middle of march we ought
[1:15:41] to be thankful i think in the middle of
[1:15:43] august
[1:15:43] we ought to be thankful every day amen
[1:15:46] that we live upon this earth
[1:15:48] we ought to be faithful we ought to be
[1:15:50] thankful we ought to be
[1:15:52] thankful amen that god saved our soul
[1:15:55] amen that god ain't been provided a lamb
[1:15:58] and then god provided a sacrifice i
[1:16:01] thank you this morning lord
[1:16:02] i thank you for healing my party i thank
[1:16:05] you for saving my soul
[1:16:07] i thank you for the holy ghost i thank
[1:16:09] you for the message of the hour
[1:16:11] i thank you for a message church i thank
[1:16:13] you for a message pastor
[1:16:15] i thank you for divine healing i thank
[1:16:17] you for redemption
[1:16:19] i thank you for restoration i thank you
[1:16:22] lord lord i'm thankful
[1:16:27] oh lord i'm thankful amen by losing the
[1:16:31] spirit of thanksgiving
[1:16:32] you know what it does it opens the door
[1:16:35] to corruption
[1:16:36] by losing the spirit of thanksgiving
[1:16:40] it opens the door to corruption paul
[1:16:42] said in romans 1 21
[1:16:44] because that when they knew god they
[1:16:47] glorified
[1:16:48] him not as god amen notice what paul
[1:16:50] says
[1:16:51] and neither were thankful
[1:16:54] amen when they knew god they glorified
[1:16:57] him not as god
[1:16:58] and neither were thankful but became
[1:17:01] vain
[1:17:02] they become vain in their imaginations
[1:17:04] and their foolish heart
[1:17:06] was darkened even see what that word
[1:17:08] glorified means
[1:17:09] it means to cause the dignity amen the
[1:17:12] worth of some person
[1:17:14] or the thing amen to become manifest
[1:17:17] and acknowledged amen the re they they
[1:17:19] reasoned away
[1:17:20] amen they are reasoned away the
[1:17:23] manifestation of god in the church
[1:17:25] amen they reasoned away the power of god
[1:17:27] they reasoned away the ability of god
[1:17:30] amen and in doing that they devalued the
[1:17:33] power of god
[1:17:34] amen among his people
[1:17:38] now and the message is your life worthy
[1:17:39] of the gospel he said the other day down
[1:17:41] here a certain little church little
[1:17:42] league team
[1:17:43] was playing down here at the park and my
[1:17:45] brother-in-law's with a boy is a pitcher
[1:17:47] amen for some of their teams he said
[1:17:48] there was a pastor with these little
[1:17:50] fellows out there on the ground
[1:17:51] amen playing and the pastor smoked a
[1:17:54] cigarette after cigarettes
[1:17:55] of a real neighborly church right here
[1:17:57] by us and can you imagine even people
[1:17:59] sitting in the audience noticed it but
[1:18:01] it's getting so that they don't even pay
[1:18:02] attention to it
[1:18:03] and a certain great church a baptist
[1:18:05] church that i know of lets the church
[1:18:07] out from sunday school
[1:18:08] 15 extra minutes so that the pastor and
[1:18:11] all them can stand outside smoke
[1:18:12] before they come back in to serve the
[1:18:14] duty of the lord he said john smith
[1:18:16] the founder of that church prayed so
[1:18:19] hard that god sent a revival
[1:18:21] till it swolled till his eyes swole shut
[1:18:24] at night
[1:18:24] and his wife had to lead him to the
[1:18:26] table and feed him with a spoon
[1:18:28] that man would turn over in his grave
[1:18:32] yes if he know that church had got in
[1:18:35] that condition
[1:18:37] he said what is it they were bidding to
[1:18:40] come
[1:18:41] and turned it down they were bidding to
[1:18:44] come
[1:18:45] and turn it down that's the
[1:18:48] only thing and you remember jesus said
[1:18:52] in here
[1:18:53] that those were bitten amen turned it
[1:18:55] down
[1:18:56] would not taste his supper amen now
[1:18:59] think of this church
[1:19:01] those that were bitten amen would not
[1:19:04] taste his supper now let me say this the
[1:19:06] hour has come
[1:19:07] when the people of this nation because
[1:19:09] they're unthankful
[1:19:11] amen will accept something of earthly
[1:19:13] value
[1:19:14] amen and reject the things of heavenly
[1:19:16] value
[1:19:17] which is of eternal value amen what are
[1:19:20] you talking about preacher i'm saying it
[1:19:21] like this
[1:19:22] amen the denominations are in the
[1:19:24] condition they're in this morning
[1:19:25] because they accepted they meant a man's
[1:19:28] idea
[1:19:29] about the bible than to accept the
[1:19:31] prophet amen that god sent in this
[1:19:33] generation
[1:19:34] with more than an idea about the bible
[1:19:36] amen but the perfect interpretation
[1:19:39] of the scriptures now in luke chapter 19
[1:19:43] verse 41
[1:19:44] and when he was come near he beheld the
[1:19:46] city and wept over it
[1:19:47] amen saying if thou has known even now
[1:19:50] at least in this day
[1:19:51] the things which belong unto thy peace
[1:19:53] amen but now they are hid from that eyes
[1:19:55] for the days shall come upon me that
[1:19:57] thine enemy shall cast the trench about
[1:19:59] me
[1:20:00] and capacity round about and keep me on
[1:20:03] every side
[1:20:04] and shall lay even thee with the ground
[1:20:06] and thy children within thee
[1:20:08] and they shall not leave in thee amen
[1:20:10] one stone upon another
[1:20:11] because thou knewest not amen the time
[1:20:14] of thy visitation
[1:20:16] amen somebody say the time of thy
[1:20:18] visitation
[1:20:20] they knew us not amen the time of thy
[1:20:22] visitation
[1:20:23] now that word visitation actually means
[1:20:25] inspection
[1:20:26] it means visitation the act by which god
[1:20:29] looks into
[1:20:30] and searches out the ways amen deeds and
[1:20:33] character
[1:20:34] men in order to judge them there lot
[1:20:37] accordingly whether joyous or sad
[1:20:39] to investigate now the prophet picks
[1:20:41] this up and says what if i was giving
[1:20:42] away capsules here
[1:20:44] that's scientifically proven that this
[1:20:46] capsule would make you live a thousand
[1:20:47] years
[1:20:48] well i'd have to get a militia out here
[1:20:50] and swarm them away from the place you
[1:20:51] wouldn't have to make an altar call for
[1:20:53] you would just have to beat them away to
[1:20:54] live a thousand years and yet
[1:20:56] scientifically proven
[1:20:58] that the eternal god all his power of
[1:21:01] his resurrection which promises you
[1:21:03] eternal life
[1:21:04] and satan will put his legions out there
[1:21:06] and keep you away from it see
[1:21:08] yet you can look and sensible enough to
[1:21:10] look the face of it and see it's right
[1:21:12] but then turn it down see something
[1:21:14] ain't some kind of an excuse it's too

[1:22:39] and another said i have bought five yoke
[1:22:41] of oxen and i go to prove them
[1:22:43] i pray they have me excused and another
[1:22:46] said i have married a wife
[1:22:47] and therefore i cannot come so that
[1:22:49] servant came
[1:22:50] and showed his lord these things then
[1:22:53] the master of the house being angry
[1:22:55] said to his servant go out quickly in
[1:22:57] the streets
[1:22:58] and the lane to the city and bring in
[1:23:00] hither the poor
[1:23:01] and the maimed and the halt and the
[1:23:03] blind and the servant said lord it is
[1:23:06] done as thou is commanded
[1:23:07] and yet there is room and the lord said
[1:23:10] unto the servant go out in the highways
[1:23:12] amen and the hedges and compel them to
[1:23:15] come in
[1:23:15] that my house may be full be filled for
[1:23:18] i say unto you that none of those men
[1:23:21] which were bid and shall taste of my
[1:23:23] supper amen
[1:23:24] they were they were asked they were bid
[1:23:27] and there was a call given
[1:23:28] amen come and partake of this amen and
[1:23:30] let me say this they turned it down
[1:23:33] amen in other words they missed amen
[1:23:35] their day of hesitation
[1:23:37] amen they separate amen are you with me
[1:23:40] this morning
[1:23:40] amen they separated themselves from god
[1:23:43] amen by rejecting the invitation
[1:23:46] to come to the feast amen and let me set
[1:23:48] this way christ
[1:23:50] has given an invitation amen to the
[1:23:52] spiritual feast of the lord
[1:23:54] of these last days prophet says now we
[1:23:57] see when god gives a man an invitation
[1:23:59] to receive the invitation we find that
[1:24:01] man is done in all ages
[1:24:02] he gives excuses when god said noah his
[1:24:07] servant
[1:24:07] amen and made a way of escape for all
[1:24:09] the people who want to be saved
[1:24:10] but the people only laughed and scorned
[1:24:12] it noah but god
[1:24:14] made the way but they had an excuse
[1:24:17] amen he said they made an excuse in the
[1:24:18] days of moses made an excuse in the days
[1:24:20] of elijah
[1:24:21] made excuses in the days of christ and
[1:24:24] they make excuses today
[1:24:26] not him speaking directly to israel the
[1:24:28] ones that was called to the feast
[1:24:29] then i would also apply the day to men
[1:24:31] the church who has been been to come the
[1:24:33] feast and won't do it
[1:24:34] the spiritual feast of the lord and they
[1:24:37] won't do it they don't want to do it
[1:24:39] they've got other things to do they find
[1:24:42] excuses amen now now have you ever just
[1:24:44] taken time to read through there
[1:24:46] in the book of luke and hear the excuses
[1:24:48] they give like this
[1:24:50] i bought about oxen and i've got to go
[1:24:52] prove them
[1:24:53] i bought cattle i've got to go prove
[1:24:55] them let me ask y'all something
[1:24:56] who buys cattle without looking at him
[1:24:58] first
[1:25:01] are you hearing me amen they were coming
[1:25:03] with all kinds of excuses
[1:25:04] amen and you know what their excuses was
[1:25:07] as weak as this water
[1:25:08] amen y'all just have to forgive me i'm
[1:25:10] just a country preacher okay and that's
[1:25:12] all i can use is country terms
[1:25:14] amen their excuses had no value to him
[1:25:17] amen but notice here the prophet said
[1:25:19] what they were doing
[1:25:20] is they thought they were just excusing
[1:25:22] themselves from a feast
[1:25:23] but they was excusing themselves from
[1:25:25] the presence of the lord jesus christ
[1:25:28] and he said today the same excuse
[1:25:32] the same thing they don't want to come
[1:25:35] to the spiritual feast of the promised
[1:25:37] vindicated word
[1:25:39] so they don't come the spiritual feast
[1:25:41] they're invited to
[1:25:42] do you believe that god has given
[1:25:43] america an invitation the last 15 years
[1:25:46] to a great revival
[1:25:47] to a spiritual feast amen did they come
[1:25:49] no sir
[1:25:50] no sir then to reject to come is that
[1:25:53] life worthy of the gospel
[1:25:54] though they call themselves that amen
[1:25:57] see without even opening their mouths
[1:25:59] amen their very actions of refusing to
[1:26:02] come
[1:26:02] amen identified that their life was not
[1:26:05] worthy of the gospel or of the spiritual
[1:26:08] feast
[1:26:08] let me just quit get to the punch of
[1:26:10] this the message of the hour
[1:26:12] is the bride spiritual thanksgiving
[1:26:15] feast
[1:26:17] the message of the hour is
[1:26:20] the bride spiritual thanksgiving feast
[1:26:23] let me just go and preach here for a
[1:26:24] second
[1:26:25] if you're feeding on anything outside of
[1:26:28] this message
[1:26:29] you are wasting your time if you're
[1:26:32] eating
[1:26:32] on any other food outside of this
[1:26:35] message
[1:26:36] you are wasting your time this message
[1:26:39] is the promise vindicated amen inspired
[1:26:42] food of the hour
[1:26:44] and is going to lift the church off of
[1:26:46] the ground someday
[1:26:47] this is the message of the hour
[1:26:52] my then to thank this morning church
[1:26:55] amen that the prophet said now upon that
[1:26:57] basis we come to the feast of the
[1:26:59] trumpets
[1:26:59] amen they hid mysteries it's prophesied
[1:27:02] it was to be that way therefore
[1:27:04] it had to be revealed in the day it was
[1:27:06] but to be revealed in this last day
[1:27:08] to fulfill exactly what i'm just saying
[1:27:11] amen malachi the fourth chapter
[1:27:13] luke 17 30 hebrews 13 8 hebrews 4 12
[1:27:17] and many of those scriptures that tell
[1:27:18] us now if that's foreign to some of you
[1:27:21] may i say that god always is known
[1:27:24] amongst his people
[1:27:25] by being prophetic amen let me just
[1:27:28] preach this morning
[1:27:29] if you have a problem with a prophet
[1:27:31] then there's a problem
[1:27:34] if you have a problem with this message
[1:27:37] you got a problem
[1:27:38] and if you got a problem with william
[1:27:41] branham being the fulfillment
[1:27:42] of malachi 4 and luke 17 30. then you've
[1:27:46] got a problem
[1:27:49] because god promised to come
[1:27:52] in the prophetic as a matter of fact he
[1:27:55] said they would return
[1:27:56] amen a prophetic message that would come
[1:27:59] to a prophetic people
[1:28:00] amen by a prophetic utterance oh church
[1:28:02] don't you see why the devil hates you
[1:28:05] it's because you're not a religious
[1:28:06] people amen you're not amen just
[1:28:08] citizens of a country
[1:28:10] even but you are a prophetic class of
[1:28:13] people that is received
[1:28:15] amen a prophetic message that'll lift
[1:28:17] you off the earth one of these days
[1:28:20] my mercy amen then to thank this morning
[1:28:24] church
[1:28:24] the prophet said god in sundried times
[1:28:27] that's what the bible says
[1:28:28] right in diverse matters amen spoke to
[1:28:31] the fathers
[1:28:32] through the prophets in this last days
[1:28:35] somebody say in this last days in this
[1:28:38] last days
[1:28:40] through his son christ jesus amen now
[1:28:43] notice here
[1:28:44] people argue and say there there can't
[1:28:46] be a prophet in this last day
[1:28:48] amen but paul says in ephesians 3 5
[1:28:51] or 4 whereby when you read you may
[1:28:53] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[1:28:55] of christ
[1:28:56] verse 5 which in other ages was not
[1:28:59] made known unto the son to man as it
[1:29:02] is now revealed unto his holy apostles
[1:29:06] and prophets by his spirit
[1:29:11] now when you think of this you begin to
[1:29:12] realize the prophet says what we've got
[1:29:14] today is a bunch of modern day lots
[1:29:18] are you with me they meant a bunch of
[1:29:19] modern day lots now what was lot
[1:29:21] they meant a lot amen abraham was a
[1:29:23] silver dollar
[1:29:24] amen lot was a penny right you know
[1:29:26] brother i'm taught that amen
[1:29:28] abraham was a super dollar he said now
[1:29:30] watch lot
[1:29:31] did not have the guts to make a stand
[1:29:33] amen lot did not have the backbone
[1:29:36] amen to go out there you realize a lot
[1:29:38] didn't agree with what was going on
[1:29:39] the bible i've got it right here in
[1:29:41] front of me the bible says for that
[1:29:42] righteous man dwelling among them
[1:29:44] and seen in hearing it vexed his
[1:29:47] righteous soul
[1:29:48] from day to day with the unlawful deeds
[1:29:52] amen what what lot was seeing done amen
[1:29:54] it vexed his soul
[1:29:56] they mean he knew it was wrong amen but
[1:29:58] there was not a backbone there
[1:29:59] ain't meant to go out there and stand
[1:30:01] face to face and say what's going on in
[1:30:03] this city
[1:30:04] is wrong it's an abomination amen and a
[1:30:07] prophet takes that
[1:30:08] and says do you realize we've got a lot
[1:30:10] of modern day lots amen but they're
[1:30:12] modern day lots when it comes to the
[1:30:14] pulpit
[1:30:16] he says now look how many lots in
[1:30:18] america yesterday reading their bible
[1:30:20] to prepare their message for the day and
[1:30:22] run across the water baptism
[1:30:24] in the name of jesus christ how many of
[1:30:26] them run across the baptism
[1:30:27] of the holy ghost how many ran across
[1:30:29] mark 16 john 14
[1:30:31] 12 if he abided me my words and you ask
[1:30:33] what you will shall be done
[1:30:35] how many lots saw that but because of
[1:30:37] their excuse
[1:30:38] of their denomination they look out and
[1:30:41] see in the bible
[1:30:42] look at their congregation of bob-tared
[1:30:43] women and they know the bible condemns
[1:30:46] it
[1:30:46] look going down the street is their own
[1:30:47] church members going down the street
[1:30:49] with shorts on
[1:30:50] and they know the word is against it but
[1:30:51] they haven't got the nerve to call out
[1:30:54] against it
[1:30:55] do you see why they don't have the nerve
[1:30:57] to call out against it
[1:30:58] it's because when they knew god they
[1:31:01] glorified him not as god
[1:31:02] and was unthankful and they bet oh god
[1:31:05] help me church
[1:31:07] and the spirit of corruption amen come
[1:31:10] in the church
[1:31:10] and they lost their guts to make a stand
[1:31:13] let me just go and take the breaks off
[1:31:15] and preach amen ain't got the guts to
[1:31:17] make a stand
[1:31:18] because they're an unthankful people but
[1:31:20] you're looking at one preacher this
[1:31:21] morning
[1:31:22] i am thankful for the message of the
[1:31:25] hour
[1:31:27] i am thankful for the voice of
[1:31:30] revelation 10
[1:31:31] 7. i am thankful for the spirit of
[1:31:33] prophecy
[1:31:34] i am thankful and as long as i've got
[1:31:37] breath in my
[1:31:38] body i'll make a stand for this message
[1:31:43] oh
[1:31:44] my they ain't got the nerve to call out
[1:31:47] against it
[1:31:48] he said give us somebody that'll crowd
[1:31:50] against it amen they made excuses what
[1:31:52] they didn't realize was their excuses
[1:31:53] actually killed the prophets
[1:31:56] now the prophet said it this way they
[1:31:57] accepted their creeds that men had given
[1:31:59] them instead of taking the word of god
[1:32:01] and by doing so
[1:32:04] they made the word of god of no effect
[1:32:10] they accepted a creed they accepted
[1:32:13] a dogma they accepted a tradition
[1:32:17] they accepted some man's idea and made
[1:32:20] the word of god of no effect
[1:32:24] now let me just go ahead and go into
[1:32:25] something else i'm thankful for lord
[1:32:27] i'm thankful that the scripture is of no
[1:32:29] private interpretation
[1:32:31] but we have been given the perfect
[1:32:34] interpretation
[1:32:35] see peter says amen knowing this verse
[1:32:38] that no
[1:32:38] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:32:42] private interpretation for the prophecy
[1:32:45] came not an old time
[1:32:46] by the will of men amen but the holy men
[1:32:49] of god spake
[1:32:50] as they were moved by the holy ghost
[1:32:53] amen now if you look at that word
[1:32:54] interpretation
[1:32:56] it's a powerful word you know brother
[1:32:58] what that word interpretation means
[1:33:00] it means lucy it means to unleash
[1:33:02] something
[1:33:03] amen to interpret something means to
[1:33:05] loose it
[1:33:06] amen it means to unloose it amen see now
[1:33:08] what private interpretation does
[1:33:10] is private interpretation binds it
[1:33:14] brings a fear
[1:33:15] it brings a scare it puts a chain upon
[1:33:17] somebody
[1:33:18] and then that if you don't come to who's
[1:33:20] got the private interpretation then you
[1:33:22] don't understand it
[1:33:23] amen see private interpretation binds
[1:33:26] the church
[1:33:27] amen do you see why they hated a prophet
[1:33:30] coming on the scene
[1:33:31] because the world was full of private
[1:33:34] interpretation
[1:33:36] private interpretation on the godhead
[1:33:38] private interpretation on the baptism
[1:33:41] of the holy ghost amen but when god sent
[1:33:44] a prophet the days
[1:33:48] of private interpretation was now
[1:33:51] over amen and by the message of the hour
[1:33:55] he would stand there and in season
[1:33:58] by the message would loose the church
[1:34:01] by the perfect interpretation now do you
[1:34:04] see why i said lord
[1:34:06] i'm thankful for the perfect
[1:34:09] interpretation
[1:34:10] of the scriptures
[1:34:13] you say what are you talking about well
[1:34:15] the prophet says this way the message
[1:34:17] actually qualifies the messenger if you
[1:34:19] look at question answers he said now
[1:34:21] what
[1:34:21] if jesus would have come and said now is
[1:34:23] moses come taking you all out of egypt
[1:34:25] i've come taking you somewhere else what
[1:34:27] if he said let's go to work and build an
[1:34:29] ark
[1:34:29] i'm the lord god i'm going to float the
[1:34:31] world away now i'm going to drown the
[1:34:33] world all them
[1:34:34] why he had been out see the scripture
[1:34:36] never said he'd come like that
[1:34:37] he wouldn't have been the messiah no
[1:34:39] matter how much ark he had built
[1:34:41] or whatever he had done he had not
[1:34:43] qualified the messiah
[1:34:45] there you are it's the qualification see
[1:34:48] oh my when that which is perfect has
[1:34:51] come
[1:34:52] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:34:54] away with
[1:34:55] so all these little things of jumping up
[1:34:58] and down like a kid
[1:34:59] and trying to talk in tongues and all
[1:35:01] these other things when that which is
[1:35:03] perfect
[1:35:03] has come and we do have today
[1:35:07] by god's help the perfect
[1:35:10] interpretation of the word with divine
[1:35:14] vindication
[1:35:18] if anybody has got a right to be happy
[1:35:21] this morning
[1:35:22] it's the bride of jesus christ we
[1:35:25] now have the perfect interpretation
[1:35:30] oh what are you thankful for this
[1:35:31] morning lord i'm thankful
[1:35:33] for the spirit of prophecy i'm thankful
[1:35:36] for the spirit of prophecy
[1:35:38] that the spirit of prophecy came upon
[1:35:39] the prophet joel
[1:35:41] and spoken said i will pour out my
[1:35:44] spirit
[1:35:44] in the last days see you'll either
[1:35:47] accept
[1:35:48] amen the fulfillment of the prophecy or
[1:35:50] you'll reject it
[1:35:51] amen and to accept it a minister come to
[1:35:54] a thanksgiving feast
[1:35:56] amen to reject it is to go into
[1:35:58] corruption
[1:35:59] to reject it is to go into bondage you
[1:36:01] say what are you talking about the
[1:36:03] prophecy when the holy spirit poured out
[1:36:04] on russia
[1:36:05] they was called to a feast of pentecost
[1:36:07] spiritual feasts
[1:36:08] and they turned it down england the holy
[1:36:10] ghost was poured out upon
[1:36:12] them and they turned it down america the
[1:36:14] holy ghost was poured out upon them
[1:36:16] and they turned it down he bit three
[1:36:19] times three times
[1:36:20] he sent out they did not listen he said
[1:36:22] oh there is still room
[1:36:23] i believe that maybe within the next few
[1:36:25] months or something or a year or
[1:36:26] whatever it is
[1:36:27] god is going to sin another shaking
[1:36:29] across the country
[1:36:31] for there is somebody still out there
[1:36:33] somewhere
[1:36:34] that's a predestinated seed let me just
[1:36:37] quit preacher for a second
[1:36:39] i do not believe that you receive a seed
[1:36:42] at the altar
[1:36:42] i do not believe amen that mama planted
[1:36:45] a seed in you
[1:36:46] when she set you on her knee but a
[1:36:48] prophet said
[1:36:49] there was a gene seed of god amen laying
[1:36:52] on the inside of you
[1:36:54] which was eternal life which always
[1:36:57] was there always was in there waiting
[1:37:00] for the quickening power
[1:37:02] of the holy ghost
[1:37:05] you say now where are you getting that

[1:57:17] done on the earth he said three stars
[1:57:20] lined up
[1:57:20] and then three magis on the earth lined
[1:57:23] up under those stars
[1:57:24] and they followed that bright star until
[1:57:27] it went all the way over
[1:57:29] amen to to where the baby was laying now

[1:57:40] the valleys they went down to the
[1:57:41] mountains
[1:57:42] they went up on top he said whenever the
[1:57:44] star stopped they stopped
[1:57:46] he said but when the star stopped there
[1:57:49] for good
[1:57:49] he said they knew it was there because
[1:57:52] there was
[1:57:53] let me say it this way in other words
[1:57:55] they were not wondering where he was
[1:57:57] they knew if the star was there then
[1:58:00] somewhere
[1:58:01] was going to be the manifestation of
[1:58:04] what the star was pointing to
[1:58:07] right you realize what they done those

[2:06:20] spirit
[2:06:21] back in the church not a celebration
[2:06:25] but a feeling then that ought to be our
[2:06:27] thanksgiving day celebration as we would
[2:06:29] call
[2:06:30] it it ought to be the holy spirit
[2:06:33] coming into our lives if we could eat a
[2:06:36] turkey

[2:13:42] system and it falls into
[2:13:44] his heart and their anchors
[2:13:47] then then satan
[2:13:50] makes you prove it and if it ain't there
[2:13:55] you're gone you know
[2:13:59] how many will agree that we need an
[2:14:00] anchor during these times
[2:14:03] i think of how the prophet of god
[2:14:05] preached so many things
[2:14:08] time and time and time and time again
[2:14:12] but he says at this speaking about when
[2:14:13] he went through his trial of losing his
[2:14:15] wife and baby
[2:14:17] he said there laid the baby before the
[2:14:18] hospital the isolated ward flies all
[2:14:20] over her little eyes like that
[2:14:22] i took the old mosquito bar and shoot
[2:14:24] them away and put it over here i got
[2:14:25] down i said god
[2:14:26] there lays my daddy and my brother
[2:14:28] yonder the flower is on their grave
[2:14:30] there lays hope laying yonder and here
[2:14:32] is my baby dying
[2:14:33] don't take her lord he just pulled down
[2:14:36] the curtain as if say
[2:14:37] shut up i don't want to hear you at all
[2:14:40] he wouldn't even talk to me
[2:14:42] then if he wouldn't talk to me it was
[2:14:44] satan's time he said
[2:14:46] and i thought you said he was a good god
[2:14:48] what's all this you're hollering about
[2:14:50] you're just a boy look around over the
[2:14:52] city every girl every boy you ever
[2:14:54] associated with think you've lost your
[2:14:55] mind
[2:14:56] you have now he couldn't tell me there's
[2:14:58] no god
[2:14:59] because i'd already seen it but he told
[2:15:02] me he didn't care for me
[2:15:04] continue to talk to him and i said
[2:15:05] that's right i begin to think well what
[2:15:08] see
[2:15:08] everything began to break away when it
[2:15:10] come to reasonings
[2:15:11] but when it come to that that hung it
[2:15:14] stayed there i was just about ready to
[2:15:15] say then i'll quit
[2:15:16] but when it got down to all the
[2:15:18] reasoning powers that broke away
[2:15:20] then it come to that eternal life that
[2:15:21] new birth what if it hadn't been there
[2:15:23] what if it hadn't had we wouldn't have
[2:15:25] known one another the way we do now
[2:15:27] the church would have not been here like
[2:15:28] this the thousands and millions around
[2:15:30] the world
[2:15:30] but thank god it was there then i
[2:15:34] thought
[2:15:34] what are you talking about andrew i'm
[2:15:35] thinking lord i'm thankful for an anchor
[2:15:37] then i thought what who am i anyhow who
[2:15:39] am i to question his majesty
[2:15:41] who am i to question the creator that
[2:15:43] give my very life give his very life
[2:15:44] here on earth

[2:15:47] me not mine anyhow
[2:15:48] he just loaned during me for a while and
[2:15:50] i said satan
[2:15:52] get away from me i went over and laid my
[2:15:54] hand on the baby i said god bless you
[2:15:56] sweetheart

[2:28:49] may have your seat
[2:28:51] we will worship you at a little bit as
[2:28:52] we express our
[2:28:54] our gratefulness to the lord but we we
[2:28:56] want to thank the lord
[2:28:59] we can say lord i'm thankful amen i hope
[2:29:03] that is not just a salmon i hope that
[2:29:06] would be our language amen
[2:29:08] the lord i'm thankful praise the lord
[2:29:12] amen you know uh
[2:29:15] when brother brandon preached invisible
[2:29:17] union
[2:29:18] message he actually said that was his
[2:29:22] thanksgiving message
[2:29:24] he preached there a lot of messages he
[2:29:25] preached around thanksgiving
[2:29:27] but invisible union message
[2:29:31] was a thanksgiving message and one of
[2:29:33] the things that is
[2:29:35] that is uh that is that is uh a blessing
[2:29:38] in that message
[2:29:39] is because there was after the opening
[2:29:42] of the seals
[2:29:43] amen and after the seals has been opened
[2:29:47] the mysteries has been revealed
[2:29:50] all we have to do is to be thankful
[2:29:53] praise the lord you know
[2:29:56] the the the the denominationer which
[2:30:00] wishes that that jezebel
[2:30:02] spirit that has that has control
[2:30:05] denominationalism
[2:30:07] in every revival the the failure of
[2:30:10] every revival
[2:30:11] was where the people got to the place
[2:30:13] and they thought they could do something
[2:30:16] they could do something to make the
[2:30:18] revival to sustain the revival
[2:30:21] praise the lord instead of being
[2:30:23] thankful
[2:30:24] for what god has given them praise the
[2:30:27] lord
[2:30:28] we always trying to think is because we
[2:30:30] have prayed a lot
[2:30:32] are we faithful in church or we are
[2:30:35] paying our tithes
[2:30:36] that's the reason why god is blessing us
[2:30:38] no that's not
[2:30:40] god has already made a provision and all
[2:30:43] we have to do is to be thankful for what
[2:30:45] he has given us
[2:30:47] praise the lord amen the reason why we
[2:30:51] do these things
[2:30:52] is an expression of our gratitude we are
[2:30:56] not doing it to gain god's favor
[2:30:58] praise the lord you're not in church
[2:31:00] every church service to gain god favor
[2:31:03] but if you appreciate what he has done
[2:31:05] for you you will not wait for those
[2:31:06] doors to be open
[2:31:08] praise the lord some people think that
[2:31:10] you have to get on the
[2:31:12] on the mountain or go in the desert like
[2:31:14] moses you know you gotta you gotta
[2:31:16] you gotta you gotta do penis before god
[2:31:19] that was one of the things that the
[2:31:20] catholic church introduced to the church
[2:31:23] that you gotta do pennies you gotta
[2:31:25] reassure to god that you are sorry for
[2:31:27] your sin
[2:31:28] so you got to crawl on your knees you
[2:31:30] got to bleed in your hands
[2:31:33] there is only one blood that god
[2:31:36] will take for the sin of man that's the
[2:31:38] blood of jesus christ
[2:31:40] now your blood now your sweat god will
[2:31:43] not take your sweat
[2:31:46] but what he wants you to do is to be
[2:31:48] thankful
[2:31:49] for what he has done for you we live a
[2:31:52] life of
[2:31:53] appreciation it's not alive to gain
[2:31:57] god's favor
[2:31:59] there is nothing you can do for him to
[2:32:01] not love you
[2:32:02] there is nothing you did for him to love
[2:32:04] you
[2:32:05] praise the lord amen if god has set his
[2:32:08] love upon you
[2:32:10] he's not going to draw back he's not
[2:32:12] going to take it back
[2:32:13] because he's depending on his own
[2:32:16] ability and not your ability
[2:32:19] praise the lord verbatim in
[2:32:22] a invisible union he said this
[2:32:25] he was talking about the revival it's
[2:32:28] very important he said this
[2:32:30] he said oh my lord i'm thankful
[2:32:34] amen he talks and he says
[2:32:39] the word i fell on the day of pentecost
[2:32:42] will now work this day
[2:32:45] he says so that was for pentecost
[2:32:50] this is for the bride going home
[2:32:54] or the bride so so we got
[2:32:57] something different and what we got
[2:33:00] different
[2:33:01] is that we can be thankful
[2:33:06] is that we can be thankful jesus says
[2:33:10] when you pray say father who are in
[2:33:13] heaven
[2:33:14] hallowed be your name i'm thankful
[2:33:19] i praise you i worship you
[2:33:23] praise the lord you start your prayers
[2:33:26] with praise and worship and you end your
[2:33:29] prayers
[2:33:30] with praise and worship you start your
[2:33:32] day we praise and
[2:33:34] worship and you end your day with praise
[2:33:36] and worship
[2:33:38] that's what this seventh season has come
[2:33:40] for this this seventh seal message
[2:33:42] is to take from in your hands that there
[2:33:44] is nothing you have to do
[2:33:46] you have to appreciate what god has
[2:33:48] given you
[2:33:50] you have to appreciate what the message
[2:33:52] has given you
[2:33:53] the message has put neckties on your
[2:33:55] neck gave you decent dress
[2:33:58] or as you have been just like the ones
[2:34:00] in the street
[2:34:01] with our clothes on walking naked is
[2:34:03] this message that have dressed you
[2:34:06] it is not what you have done is that
[2:34:08] because you have been in the messy i
[2:34:10] read the message and
[2:34:11] no you know what one thing this message
[2:34:14] also did for us is there
[2:34:17] amen under the roman system under that
[2:34:20] jezebel's uh religion
[2:34:23] it lift up the priests they lift up the
[2:34:25] bishop
[2:34:26] and it corrupt the people they condem it
[2:34:29] kept the people
[2:34:30] out of condemnation all the time amen
[2:34:33] in this message we're not lifting up
[2:34:36] william branham
[2:34:38] amen praise the lord god waved that
[2:34:41] ministry before
[2:34:42] us because he has called you all
[2:34:45] he's lifting the people up is not to
[2:34:48] live for one man and condemn the people
[2:34:51] no it's to say god used one man and
[2:34:53] brought that man to that place
[2:34:55] and he can bring you to that same place
[2:34:58] as a child of god as a daughter and son
[2:35:00] of god
[2:35:02] [Music]
[2:35:06] that's what we are thankful for that's
[2:35:09] our thanksgiving
[2:35:11] it's that what you can do is
[2:35:13] appreciating what god has done for you
[2:35:16] if you don't appreciate it there is
[2:35:18] nothing you would do
[2:35:19] to ever get yourself to where you think
[2:35:21] you want to get yourself
[2:35:22] you have to appreciate everything what
[2:35:25] god has given you
[2:35:26] the people he has put in your life amen
[2:35:31] just like brother andrew said god line
[2:35:33] up three stars
[2:35:35] to identify that the bridegroom was on
[2:35:38] earth
[2:35:39] he landed a five planet
[2:35:42] a vindication of the fightful ministry
[2:35:44] to identify this bride
[2:35:46] that's the work of the fightful ministry
[2:35:49] to tell you that he has made you walking
[2:35:52] not to make you to work work yourself
[2:35:55] out
[2:35:56] but to tell you appreciate what god has
[2:35:59] given to you
[2:36:01] if god has given you a family
[2:36:02] appreciated if god has given you a
[2:36:05] husband appreciate it
[2:36:06] if he have given you a father that would
[2:36:08] that would that would discipline you by
[2:36:09] the word of god appreciate it
[2:36:11] if he gives you an assembly appreciate
[2:36:13] it
[2:36:15] is having a heart of thankfulness
[2:36:19] just having a heart of thankfulness can
[2:36:22] heal you
[2:36:23] from sicknesses just being thankful
[2:36:26] to know that the lord is my healer
[2:36:30] i'm thankful that he's my healer no
[2:36:33] matter what pain i feed in my body
[2:36:35] but i'm thankful that he's my healer
[2:36:45] we always want to tell people what we
[2:36:47] have done
[2:36:48] and what we are doing and what we can do
[2:36:51] instead of telling people what he has
[2:36:54] done
[2:36:55] what he is doing and what he can do it's
[2:36:58] all about he
[2:36:59] and not about you
[2:37:04] that's the thanksgiving message
[2:37:10] we got to be thankful for the message
[2:37:13] thankful for the messenger
[2:37:22] oh praise the lord amen
[2:37:26] i just believe this was a wonderful
[2:37:29] wonderful lord i'm thankful
[2:37:33] praise the lord
[2:37:58] oh
[2:38:26] true
[2:38:54] yes
[2:39:08] yes
[2:39:13] [Music]
[2:39:26] lord we worship you
[2:39:50] so
[2:40:04] yes
[2:40:20] you know what if you grow up in the
[2:40:22] system
[2:40:23] in the family where you would never
[2:40:25] praise
[2:40:27] well you were never appreciated when you
[2:40:30] were never taught to give praise back
[2:40:33] be able to say thank you to say i
[2:40:35] appreciate you
[2:40:36] and you have not grown under there
[2:40:40] [Music]
[2:40:44] because it was it was at a time where
[2:40:46] you did something before you were ever
[2:40:48] appreciated
[2:40:49] so it almost looked like we want to work
[2:40:51] our way in
[2:40:52] we want we want to impress god that we
[2:40:54] are doing something no
[2:40:55] we have to be thankful amen we have to
[2:40:59] be thankful
[2:41:00] because it's what he's doing it's not
[2:41:02] what you are doing
[2:41:04] praise the lord it's not because you
[2:41:06] pray that god
[2:41:07] answered your prayer no there are
[2:41:10] millions in the word
[2:41:11] people out there they don't pray and say
[2:41:14] god provide
[2:41:15] my daily bread but because he's the
[2:41:17] father of creation
[2:41:19] he makes sure he provides for him
[2:41:21] [Music]
[2:41:24] our prayer to god is an appreciation
[2:41:27] the bible say even before you ask him
[2:41:29] you already know
[2:41:31] but brother branham said we have to come
[2:41:32] as children and appreciate him
