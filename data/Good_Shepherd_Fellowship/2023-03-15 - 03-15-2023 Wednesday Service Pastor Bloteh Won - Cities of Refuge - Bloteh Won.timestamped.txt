[54:12] feel like we should just read Psalm

[54:16] amen so well
[54:19] but we want to thank the Lord Brother
[54:21] Crosby spoke with him today he got back

[54:36] glad to to to be able to come out we're
[54:39] looking forward to come back again
[54:41] praise the Lord
[54:42] amen now now there is uh uh you know I
[54:47] was
[54:48] I was uh
[54:50] you know you think about uh
[54:53] uh the meetings you watch to see how the
[54:58] law was dealing with us dealing with
[55:00] every one of us
[55:01] and uh
[55:07] so I was looking at this at this
[55:09] scripture actually I had on my mind to
[55:11] talk on something tonight but I thought
[55:13] that well okay and I will leave it since
[55:16] it's uh Wednesday night we would just uh
[55:19] speak on something around the City of
[55:22] Refuge
[55:23] and take the various cities and their
[55:28] names and and look at them through the
[55:30] scripture as we as we go on tonight
[55:34] praise the Lord just to be able to
[55:37] encourage you but let's look in uh
[55:40] Revelation chapter 21 let's look in
[55:43] Revelation chapter 21 before we go that
[55:46] way I've used this uh uh uh I've used
[55:50] this uh verse before
[55:54] Revelation chapter 21.
[56:03] Revelation chapter 21 verse 7.
[56:12] Revelation 21 verse 7.
[56:15] he that overcome it
[56:18] shall inherit all things
[56:22] and I will be his God
[56:25] and he shall be my son praise the Lord
[56:29] amen
[56:31] now that that word son is not only to
[56:35] the male it go back to the beginning you
[56:38] know uh it speaks of of of a place of
[56:43] position
[56:44] mobile being just a meal
[56:48] verse 8 says
[56:50] verse 7 again he that overcome it shall
[56:54] inherit all things
[56:56] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[57:00] son
[57:02] but the fearful
[57:06] if I want to read any other thing again
[57:09] that's what I want to put in my mind
[57:12] but the fearful
[57:14] their unbelieving
[57:16] and the Abominable the murderers the
[57:19] warmongers the sorcerers and you and you
[57:22] name you see all of that as uh as the
[57:26] Apostle John uh is listing down here uh
[57:31] shall have their part in the lake
[57:34] wishburner will fire you in Brimstone
[57:37] which is the second death
[57:41] now you think about uh uh the ones that
[57:46] uh you know that would be that would be
[57:48] cast off now the Bible here is placing
[57:52] the Overcomer at the place of where God
[57:56] is telling the Overcomer you will
[57:58] inherit everything
[58:01] praise the Lord now most of the time we
[58:04] look at inheriting everything as humans
[58:06] our mind is is uh you know uh first
[58:11] capture by our our physical senses so we
[58:15] think about having the Earth and having
[58:18] everything but it's it's I mean uh the
[58:21] land the houses and you know and all of
[58:23] that but uh it is it is actually in a
[58:27] place that when we come down to this
[58:31] place you will realize that this
[58:34] Overcomer is actually inheriting
[58:37] everything that God has everything that
[58:41] God
[58:42] Ace
[58:44] praise the Lord
[58:46] because like the scripture says he will
[58:48] inherit
[58:50] all things
[58:51] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[58:56] son so it is almost like brother Branham
[58:58] saying taking a teaspoon and dipping it
[59:01] down into the ocean amen
[59:04] and it's almost as uh God creating Man
[59:08] In His Image
[59:10] so when God brought for ah I mean Adam
[59:14] out of him Adam actually had all things
[59:21] praise the Lord he was a possessor of
[59:24] all things that's the reason why he
[59:26] could be able to manifest the thoughts
[59:28] of the father he could name things and
[59:32] the father had no problem with faith he
[59:34] could do because he was possessed of all
[59:37] things not only physical thing but the
[59:39] very nature of God
[59:42] then the scripture will come down to the
[59:44] next verse and says but the fearful
[59:49] and their own believing
[59:53] praise the Lord
[59:54] now we we think about them that will be
[59:58] cast in the Lake of Fire you know it's
[1:00:00] it's easy for us to take the people on
[1:00:02] drugs and the ones that are drunk and
[1:00:05] the ones that are uh uh are living wrong
[1:00:08] can uh you know our mind goes to that
[1:00:13] but uh
[1:00:15] we are seeing something here that we
[1:00:18] face all the time being fearful
[1:00:23] praise the Lord
[1:00:24] and also year year is also giving us an
[1:00:30] idea that uh uh fear was attached to men
[1:00:35] when he fell from uh from from from
[1:00:38] Grace when he fell in the Garden of Eden
[1:00:40] he pick up that spirit of fear
[1:00:44] praise the Lord and yeah God is now
[1:00:47] restoring his son giving his sons back
[1:00:51] everything
[1:00:52] and then he's casting their fearful
[1:00:55] nature in the Lake of Fire
[1:01:00] praise the Lord
[1:01:02] amen
[1:01:03] so he that is fearful
[1:01:06] and uh we don't we don't think about it
[1:01:11] that way but uh we have to we have to
[1:01:15] come to the place to realize that we
[1:01:18] don't have nothing to be afraid of
[1:01:22] praise the Lord
[1:01:23] We There is not anything that we have to
[1:01:27] be afraid of
[1:01:30] praise the lord we are serving the god
[1:01:32] that is more than able
[1:01:36] praise the Lord
[1:01:38] so uh if we are inheriting all things
[1:01:42] tonight we must realize that and we are
[1:01:46] inheriting everything by the word you
[1:01:48] know the restoration of the word that
[1:01:51] has restore our soul back to God is
[1:01:54] giving us everything and that also is is
[1:01:58] is literally dealing with the spirit of
[1:02:00] fear
[1:02:02] the word is dealing with the spirit of
[1:02:04] fear it's not it's not how how much you
[1:02:08] Brave yourself up
[1:02:10] is the word that we cast out the spirit
[1:02:13] of fear for he have not given us a
[1:02:16] spirit of fear but he have given us a
[1:02:19] sign mine
[1:02:20] praise the Lord
[1:02:22] so uh just thinking about that uh
[1:02:28] that's not where I was going going
[1:02:30] tonight
[1:02:31] like I said I wanted to talk about the
[1:02:35] city The Refuge if I have a I have I
[1:02:38] have a map on the City of Refuge if they
[1:02:41] can put that up for me tonight
[1:02:43] being that is is uh is is Wednesday and
[1:02:48] we we want to recover from the services
[1:02:50] on the weekend
[1:02:52] praise the Lord
[1:02:54] I taught that uh I would just bring
[1:02:57] something
[1:02:59] just to kind of encourage you tonight
[1:03:02] praise the Lord
[1:03:04] amen
[1:03:08] now we will go we will go to the
[1:03:10] scripture and we will try to look at
[1:03:12] that no I should have a map on a day I
[1:03:15] don't know if the image came through
[1:03:17] okay the image never came true okay
[1:03:19] that's the image I wanted uh-huh
[1:03:24] yeah that's
[1:03:26] that's what happened when I do
[1:03:29] a very poor job
[1:03:33] praise the Lord
[1:03:35] I'm going to try one more time
[1:03:39] I'm going to try one more time
[1:03:46] I hope this time it works
[1:03:51] now we know brother Branham took this
[1:03:54] scripture in the message letting off the
[1:03:56] pressure
[1:03:57] and uh
[1:03:59] he used that scripture in preaching that
[1:04:03] message and then in the in the message
[1:04:06] letting of the pressure vertebrand kind
[1:04:09] of for referred to the City of Refuge
[1:04:13] how God made a provision for his people
[1:04:16] but there are a few things that are that
[1:04:19] are that are attached to that to that
[1:04:22] City that are wanted for us to do cities
[1:04:24] sorry that I wanted for us to be able to
[1:04:27] look at tonight Israel were giving 48
[1:04:31] cities
[1:04:32] you know they were they were going to
[1:04:34] inhabit 48 cities as they go into the
[1:04:39] promised land and and and God is telling
[1:04:43] them to take six of those cities for
[1:04:46] those to be Cities of Refuge
[1:04:50] praise the Lord
[1:04:51] so uh why the uh
[1:05:02] if our sisters would be able to give us
[1:05:04] the image why they work on it okay
[1:05:09] okay we will go back and forth uh with
[1:05:13] that
[1:05:15] praise the Lord
[1:05:20] now one thing uh uh I would want for us
[1:05:24] to
[1:05:25] to realize is that uh
[1:05:28] uh
[1:05:30] these cities are placed uh
[1:05:35] in in a kind of a position where
[1:05:39] it should be very easy
[1:05:42] for the one that is needing help
[1:05:47] to be able to run to any one of these
[1:05:49] cities so wherever you are it should be
[1:05:52] very easy for you to get into one of
[1:05:54] these City and as I was as I was
[1:05:57] studying on the City of Refuge there
[1:05:59] were a few things that I realized is
[1:06:01] that uh there were laws that were put in
[1:06:04] place that those City Gates were never
[1:06:07] locked
[1:06:09] you can have access anytime
[1:06:13] praise the Lord
[1:06:14] and and the roles and the bridges that
[1:06:19] lead to the city have to be repaired all
[1:06:21] the time
[1:06:25] because you need to have access to it
[1:06:30] praise the Lord
[1:06:31] amen
[1:06:33] and they have provisions
[1:06:37] they have Provisions in the city all the
[1:06:41] time there was food
[1:06:43] enough food enough water
[1:06:46] praise the Lord
[1:06:48] so as as the as the the children of
[1:06:53] Israel do their farming you know when uh
[1:06:57] as they they would take up the attire
[1:07:00] from their crops and and all of that and
[1:07:03] then uh some of what they give as uh as
[1:07:07] as an offering or the over plus goes to
[1:07:10] these cities because the need to have
[1:07:13] food all the time
[1:07:16] praise the Lord
[1:07:19] amen
[1:07:22] foreign
[1:07:23] so let's look in let's look in our
[1:07:26] Bibles tonight
[1:07:36] glory be to God
[1:07:43] Numbers Chapter 35.
[1:07:56] I pray to be able to do a good job here
[1:07:58] for you tonight
[1:08:00] praise the Lord
[1:08:13] Numbers chapter 35 Let's uh we will read
[1:08:16] reading from verse one and the Lord
[1:08:19] speak unto Moses in a plane of more
[1:08:22] by Jolly near Jericho saying command the
[1:08:25] children of Israel that they gave unto
[1:08:28] the Levites
[1:08:30] of the inheritance of their possession
[1:08:34] cities to do it in
[1:08:38] and yes I gave also unto the lever
[1:08:42] suburbs for the city round about them
[1:08:46] and the cities
[1:08:48] shall they have to do it in and the
[1:08:51] suburb of them shall be for the akatos
[1:08:55] and for their Ghouls and
[1:08:59] for all the abyss and the suburbs of the
[1:09:03] city which year shall give unto the
[1:09:06] Levites cherish from the wall of the
[1:09:10] city and outwall a thousand kilbit
[1:09:14] around
[1:09:15] praise the Lord
[1:09:17] and ye shall measure from without the
[1:09:21] city on the east side
[1:09:24] 2000 Cubit and on the South Side 2000
[1:09:28] Cubit on the West Side 2000 Cubit on the
[1:09:31] North 2000 cubic and the city shall be
[1:09:35] in the midst
[1:09:37] this shall be to them the suburb of the
[1:09:42] Cities
[1:09:43] and among the cities which yes I gave
[1:09:47] unto the Levites
[1:09:50] there shall be six Cities of Refuge
[1:09:56] which year shall appoint for the man's
[1:10:01] Slayer
[1:10:03] praise the Lord
[1:10:05] that he may flee haterton
[1:10:08] and to to them ye shall add 40 and two
[1:10:15] cities
[1:10:16] now so we realize that the Levites were
[1:10:21] not giving uh uh inheritance praise the
[1:10:25] Lord amen so there were two in some
[1:10:29] sense kind of was quite in these cities
[1:10:31] and but yet
[1:10:33] God was kind of for making provision for
[1:10:37] his people I want you to be able to grab
[1:10:39] this picture in your mind knowing that
[1:10:42] uh uh the people coming out of Egypt and
[1:10:48] uh uh and and seeing the miracle of
[1:10:51] opening the rare seed and everything
[1:10:53] that God did for them you know uh
[1:10:56] turning the beta water mirrored into
[1:10:59] water for them to drink providing food
[1:11:01] and all of that but yet the heart of the
[1:11:04] people was not converted praise the Lord
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:10] almighty God seen uh how much uh uh sin
[1:11:16] has affected the heart of man he's
[1:11:19] making here a provision
[1:11:21] it is he's not he's not absent money
[1:11:23] that these people will have a time where
[1:11:26] somebody will get angry or somebody will
[1:11:28] make mistake or somebody would do
[1:11:30] something that is uh you know uh that
[1:11:33] they will need help
[1:11:35] so he's making provision for them
[1:11:38] praise the Lord amen noun is is the kind
[1:11:43] of a picture that brother Branham was
[1:11:45] said before there was sin there was a
[1:11:47] savior
[1:11:51] praise the Lord
[1:11:53] amen that is the beautiful thing about
[1:11:56] the the Old Testament
[1:11:59] in a way where it parks that types and
[1:12:03] shadows
[1:12:06] so here is God
[1:12:08] Moses
[1:12:13] that when you when you get over to this
[1:12:16] place
[1:12:17] you need to have
[1:12:20] these cities
[1:12:22] of Refuge
[1:12:24] praise the Lord
[1:12:26] so the man
[1:12:27] that had made a mistake
[1:12:31] we have a place to run for shelter
[1:12:36] he knows our weaknesses
[1:12:39] God knows that we will make mistake
[1:12:43] praise the Lord he's making provision
[1:12:46] for us to come to him when we make
[1:12:50] mistakes
[1:12:53] praise the Lord
[1:12:55] he know what we are made out of
[1:12:58] he knows our strength he knows our
[1:13:02] weaknesses we cannot impress God
[1:13:08] are we together
[1:13:11] praise the Lord
[1:13:13] you know because uh tonight I was
[1:13:16] actually uh that there is there is one
[1:13:19] of the Cities there let me not get ahead
[1:13:22] of myself but you know it's it's some of
[1:13:25] the things that we preachers enjoy doing
[1:13:27] getting ahead of ourselves
[1:13:30] amen if it's for some reason it makes
[1:13:33] our brain to work better that way
[1:13:36] foreign
[1:13:38] you know I I decided to switch over to
[1:13:41] the city of The Refuge I were actually
[1:13:42] stay in this couple of days ago I
[1:13:45] decided to switch to this
[1:13:48] because I was actually going to speak on
[1:13:50] something tonight but what caught my
[1:13:52] mind was that if you remember the story
[1:13:55] of where Joe Shafer Ahab sent for Jerry
[1:13:59] Sheffer for them to go and get a lane
[1:14:01] one of these land that they were going
[1:14:04] to get we will see it in the reading as
[1:14:06] we go along one of them were actually
[1:14:09] one of those cities
[1:14:12] amen Raymond Gill it was a City of
[1:14:15] Refuge
[1:14:17] so Ahab was uh he was he was his his
[1:14:23] desire of having the city was a wealthy
[1:14:26] one because there was a city that
[1:14:28] belongs to Israel
[1:14:30] now that kind of a drifted my mind to
[1:14:33] this because I was actually looking at
[1:14:36] some things that we were going to talk
[1:14:37] about from the message enticing spirit
[1:14:42] there are two words that Paul used Paul
[1:14:45] used enticing spirit
[1:14:48] and he also used seducing spirit
[1:14:52] but wherever Paul you seduce in spirit
[1:14:57] he tied that to
[1:15:00] demon powers
[1:15:04] he tied it to uh being said used by
[1:15:07] demon power you know he he ties there
[1:15:10] and when Paul used enticing Spirit like
[1:15:15] he used in First Corinthians chapter 2
[1:15:17] that's where my reading will have come
[1:15:19] from he said that talks about
[1:15:22] interesting spirit in that way he says
[1:15:25] uh uh uh you know when I came to you I
[1:15:29] never came to you with uh in touch and
[1:15:31] spirit of man wisdom
[1:15:34] praise the Lord
[1:15:36] now brother Branham in uh uh the message
[1:15:41] enticing Spirit I'm kind of for drifting
[1:15:43] a little bit but it's good that's where
[1:15:45] my heart was for tonight so uh uh you
[1:15:49] cannot take a preacher away from his
[1:15:50] message so that's exactly what is
[1:15:53] happening so brother Brennan in the
[1:15:55] message enticing Spirit what he was
[1:15:57] trying to help us to see was the other
[1:16:01] uh
[1:16:03] he talks about
[1:16:05] just the same way uh demon powers are
[1:16:10] responsible for the sickness that that
[1:16:14] is in our body it says every sickness is
[1:16:17] from the fourth dimension
[1:16:19] every sickness is a fourth dimension
[1:16:21] sickness
[1:16:23] then he's making also also realize that
[1:16:26] is the same way things that make people
[1:16:29] to drift away from the word of God is
[1:16:32] also demon powers are responsible for
[1:16:36] that
[1:16:38] praise the Lord
[1:16:40] amen and the same way demon powers will
[1:16:45] affect people's body and bring diseases
[1:16:48] upon them and and he says that is the
[1:16:50] same way demon powers will also affect
[1:16:54] people's body now but what I was it will
[1:16:57] affect uh the the human Spirit you know
[1:17:00] to be able to drift them away from the
[1:17:02] word of God but what I was looking at
[1:17:04] tonight it was it was actually
[1:17:07] tremendous to see that uh brother brand
[1:17:10] name he says that every disease
[1:17:15] is from the fourth dimension
[1:17:19] now when brother Branham is talking
[1:17:21] about
[1:17:22] uh enticing spirit
[1:17:25] he read his scripture about no man can
[1:17:28] go to war unless he count the cost
[1:17:32] but then when he gets into the message
[1:17:34] he goes directly to the scripture where
[1:17:38] Ahab sent for jehoshapher
[1:17:41] and he dwells on that
[1:17:44] and he's using that particular scripture
[1:17:47] to make us to see how enticing Spirit
[1:17:51] works
[1:17:53] praise the Lord
[1:17:55] it is Ahab that is taking a structural
[1:17:59] position he's taking a scripture from
[1:18:01] the Bible
[1:18:03] he's calling another Son of God
[1:18:07] and saying see this is a promise the
[1:18:10] Bible says there will be there will be
[1:18:12] uh uh we will let our hands on the sake
[1:18:15] and the sake
[1:18:17] will be healed
[1:18:19] the Bible said the gift supposed to be
[1:18:22] in the church
[1:18:25] he's he's pointing out a promise
[1:18:29] praise the Lord
[1:18:31] but how to go about and fulfill that
[1:18:34] promise the Bible gave us promises and
[1:18:37] the Bible also instructs us
[1:18:40] how those promises will come to pass
[1:18:45] are we together
[1:18:47] now so
[1:18:50] as The Story Goes On
[1:18:54] in the Bible the Bible make us succeed
[1:18:57] there
[1:19:00] wide
[1:19:01] Ahab was thinking about getting this
[1:19:04] slang he has already consulted With His
[1:19:07] prophets
[1:19:09] praise the Lord
[1:19:13] we'll come back to the City of Refuge
[1:19:18] you have already considered consulted
[1:19:21] With His prophets he sent for Joe
[1:19:23] Shepherd
[1:19:24] and uh Joe Sheffer wanted to be sure
[1:19:28] that uh you know well yeah I can see it
[1:19:31] I can see it that this land belonged to
[1:19:34] us this is a promise that belongs to the
[1:19:36] church
[1:19:37] well can we pray about it
[1:19:40] praise the Lord
[1:19:41] he said while I you know I have I have
[1:19:43] all of these men of God here that uh
[1:19:46] I've talked to them and every one of
[1:19:48] them told told me you know it's in the
[1:19:50] word you know well let's go for it
[1:19:53] praise the Lord
[1:19:54] are we together
[1:19:56] and he says is there now one more
[1:20:02] oh yeah there is one that will never
[1:20:04] speak any good thing about me
[1:20:07] praise the Lord instead did not convince
[1:20:10] our Jehoshaphat in a way but what
[1:20:12] brother Branham is bringing out I will I
[1:20:14] will say that and then go back to what I
[1:20:16] want to talk about here is that uh
[1:20:20] with all of this decision
[1:20:23] that are happening in all of these
[1:20:26] prophets agreeing together there is
[1:20:28] something happening in the Unseen
[1:20:34] praise the Lord
[1:20:37] Mikhail had a vision
[1:20:40] and uh and and and the law show him a
[1:20:43] vision because Ahab had a prophecy
[1:20:46] hanging over him that the dogs is going
[1:20:48] to lick his blood
[1:20:50] now here is it lying spirits
[1:20:54] now so what brother Branham is showing
[1:20:57] in interesting Spirit just like how uh
[1:21:01] uh diseases in the body is influenced
[1:21:04] from the fourth dimension
[1:21:07] enticing spirit that leads men away from
[1:21:10] the promise of God even though they
[1:21:12] claim to be preaching the Bible they
[1:21:15] claim to be preaching the message the
[1:21:17] interesting spirit is also influenced
[1:21:19] from The Fifth Dimension
[1:21:22] because those lying Spirit came from The
[1:21:24] Fifth Dimension
[1:21:27] and it anointed those men it made every
[1:21:30] one of them to agree they said the same
[1:21:32] thing
[1:21:38] praise the Lord
[1:21:41] they all say the same thing
[1:21:54] and you know we give you
[1:21:57] a lot of things to think about
[1:22:00] when you when you get down is that
[1:22:03] studying and looking at that subjective
[1:22:06] it just makes you to look at a whole lot
[1:22:09] of things but uh as the Lord will be our
[1:22:12] help we will we will have time to look
[1:22:14] into it praise the Lord
[1:22:16] oh I'm I'm sure I was trying to put some
[1:22:19] things together I didn't get
[1:22:21] everything that I needed for tonight so
[1:22:23] I just thought that I will I will go
[1:22:25] this way but that's what brought this to
[1:22:28] my mind because Raymond Gallery is also
[1:22:31] part of uh the six Cities of Refuge
[1:22:36] praise the Lord
[1:22:37] and and you know then and uh
[1:22:41] uh
[1:22:43] yeah and there are a lot of other things
[1:22:45] that brother Branham talks about that we
[1:22:48] will be able to look into but let's
[1:22:49] let's stick with this thought tonight so
[1:22:51] I won't keep you long or else I will end
[1:22:54] up preaching two messages tonight
[1:22:57] I only have time for one
[1:23:00] now so we see here that God now gnawing
[1:23:04] the need of his people
[1:23:07] he sees uh he's making provision for
[1:23:10] them
[1:23:12] and he's making provision
[1:23:17] where his people can be able to help now
[1:23:20] you have to realize
[1:23:22] that Israel
[1:23:24] as the journey
[1:23:27] they never had no police station
[1:23:32] praise the Lord there was no police
[1:23:34] station
[1:23:37] if a man was caught doing evil
[1:23:40] and the Lord Justified his Stone to
[1:23:43] death there was no praising
[1:23:50] praise the Lord
[1:23:51] amen there was no praising you read over
[1:23:54] there in the book of Deuteronomy the
[1:23:56] Bible says if a man is caught doing
[1:23:59] something
[1:24:02] the the witness that saw him
[1:24:05] will be the first to Stone him
[1:24:09] why because if he's little proving that
[1:24:12] is wrong the witness also will be stoned
[1:24:14] to death
[1:24:16] you say you saw him you believe it it
[1:24:19] happened yeah okay you take the stone
[1:24:20] you'll be the first one to trade
[1:24:22] right
[1:24:25] praise the Lord there was no praising
[1:24:28] there was no police station they're
[1:24:31] there with it there and done praise the
[1:24:33] Lord
[1:24:35] amen
[1:24:36] now you can see why God is giving them
[1:24:39] this provision
[1:24:42] amen
[1:24:44] because they are still under the nature
[1:24:47] of sin honor the blood of bulls and God
[1:24:52] a man can tell lies and say I saw him
[1:24:55] doing it because I want them to kill
[1:24:57] these guys here I saw him doing it
[1:25:02] so God gnawing
[1:25:06] the nature of his people that's that's
[1:25:08] what I want to bring out tonight
[1:25:10] he knows our nature every one of us
[1:25:14] sitting here tonight
[1:25:16] he knows Where We Are
[1:25:19] in location toward the City of Refuge
[1:25:25] if he will place us on the map just like
[1:25:28] that map was on he knows our position
[1:25:31] spiritually where we are and how much we
[1:25:35] need to run to the city of The Refuge
[1:25:41] praise the Lord
[1:25:44] he knows the nature of his people
[1:25:48] he's making provision for them
[1:25:52] Hallelujah
[1:25:55] praise the Lord so there were three
[1:25:58] cities on the east side and there were
[1:26:00] three cities on the west
[1:26:03] praise the Lord you look at the City of
[1:26:06] Refuge it's it's tonight it's a
[1:26:08] Wednesday night
[1:26:09] you will see that uh
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:14] you have this seated kiddish
[1:26:18] we could look through the different uh
[1:26:22] uh Bible verses on them but it would
[1:26:24] take us a whole lot
[1:26:27] as you you go through it but that that
[1:26:30] City carriage
[1:26:32] uh it's not that's not Kadesh bennel no
[1:26:36] this is a different kiddish praise the
[1:26:38] Lord but uh by the way if you look in
[1:26:42] the Book of Judges that was the city
[1:26:45] where uh Barack
[1:26:48] came out of
[1:26:50] so that was completely different from
[1:26:53] where the children of Israel you know uh
[1:26:56] uh turned down the promise where they
[1:26:58] saw the Giants and all of that that is
[1:26:59] completely different but this word means
[1:27:04] righteousness
[1:27:07] amen
[1:27:09] it means righteousness
[1:27:12] when you look at it in the Hebrew
[1:27:16] so God in their making provision for his
[1:27:20] people we know the Bible says they are
[1:27:23] the uh uh if a man was throwing an ax
[1:27:27] trying to cut wood in the head of the
[1:27:30] ash came out and hit another man and he
[1:27:33] died uh let his start running straight
[1:27:36] to the city The Refuge
[1:27:39] praise the Lord he gets to the city and
[1:27:42] he go
[1:27:44] to meet the high priest
[1:27:47] he missed the ever and he tell his story
[1:27:52] praise the Lord when you go to the
[1:27:54] center of Refuge nobody speaks for you
[1:27:56] you speak for yourself
[1:28:01] are we together
[1:28:03] amen
[1:28:04] I want us to keep in our mind that Jesus
[1:28:07] is our City of Refuge the name of the
[1:28:10] Lord is a mighty tower that the
[1:28:12] righteous run into
[1:28:14] praise the Lord
[1:28:16] amen we can share with people I'm
[1:28:18] dealing with this pray for me brother
[1:28:21] I'm struggling with this pray for me but
[1:28:23] you see the uh the father love it
[1:28:27] when you come and tell him your story
[1:28:32] praise the Lord
[1:28:34] when you come and say it to him just as
[1:28:38] a happen
[1:28:42] praise the Lord
[1:28:45] are we together
[1:28:48] why because he is our righteousness
[1:28:56] he is our righteousness you will see
[1:28:58] that the the Redemptive name play out in
[1:29:01] here as well
[1:29:10] and because he is our righteousness
[1:29:14] there is uh
[1:29:18] when you get into the City of Refuge we
[1:29:22] we you
[1:29:24] are Justified
[1:29:28] you tell your mother to uh uh to the
[1:29:32] high priest
[1:29:34] and uh you are receiving and and I mean
[1:29:37] you are you are protected as long as you
[1:29:40] are in the City of Refuge
[1:29:42] you can never be accused the second time
[1:29:48] praise the Lord
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:53] you cannot go to the city of The Refuge
[1:29:55] and say Sir uh well well he he was the
[1:29:59] one that came in my space
[1:30:03] if he wouldn't have come in my no no I
[1:30:06] did it
[1:30:09] I'm guilty just as I am
[1:30:12] without no plea
[1:30:14] praise the Lord you don't make your own
[1:30:17] plea
[1:30:19] the high priest makes your play
[1:30:22] just like Christ makes our place
[1:30:30] you see this city also the next one is
[1:30:33] uh
[1:30:34] uh which means it means a shoulder
[1:30:39] it gets to the place of uh just like
[1:30:43] brother Branham says the shepherd
[1:30:45] carries the Sheep
[1:30:48] it's a city where Abraham
[1:30:51] started from back in Genesis chapter 12
[1:30:53] you you read that but that is is so it
[1:30:57] has a place of uh uh
[1:31:01] a sense of a Shepherd that carries
[1:31:05] the Sheep which lay has been broken
[1:31:10] praise the Lord
[1:31:12] are we together so when we run into the
[1:31:17] the the cellar of Refuge we realize that
[1:31:20] because there is a shepherd
[1:31:24] and we need to be carried
[1:31:26] amen
[1:31:29] we can defend ourselves
[1:31:33] praise the Lord
[1:31:38] Abram was another
[1:31:41] City Genesis Chapter 13 Verse 8 the city
[1:31:45] is mentioned in
[1:31:47] you will see that this uh City uh Hebron
[1:31:52] it has a sense of meaning of Fellowship
[1:31:57] it means Fellowship we enter into
[1:32:00] fellowship with him
[1:32:03] praise the Lord
[1:32:05] when we go into the City of Refuge we
[1:32:08] enter into Fellowship
[1:32:11] with him
[1:32:13] praise the Lord
[1:32:15] the reason there is because when we go
[1:32:18] and tell our story when we go and
[1:32:21] confess our thought
[1:32:24] the high priest there is no reason for
[1:32:27] you to feel guilty
[1:32:32] amen
[1:32:33] the sense of feeling guilty is because
[1:32:36] you it means that you intentionally did
[1:32:39] it
[1:32:42] the reason why you can feel no guilt
[1:32:44] because you never did it in the first
[1:32:46] place or it was by mistake
[1:32:49] sure
[1:32:50] praise the Lord and you see when a
[1:32:53] person is dealing with guilt it's hard
[1:32:56] to enter into Fellowship
[1:33:01] praise the Lord
[1:33:02] so you see the center of Refuge uh uh
[1:33:06] hard and atmosphere that when we come
[1:33:09] into it we have to have confidence
[1:33:12] you have to have confidence that when
[1:33:15] you step your fault into that City the
[1:33:18] adventure of blood can do nothing to you
[1:33:22] you don't have to be looking over your
[1:33:24] shoulders
[1:33:26] you have to believe in the protection
[1:33:32] that it has given to you
[1:33:34] praise the Lord
[1:33:36] amen and that is the place where the
[1:33:38] believer should be
[1:33:40] we should believe that
[1:33:43] this Holy Ghost has everything in it
[1:33:48] amen we must believe that everything we
[1:33:52] need for our joining has been given to
[1:33:54] us
[1:33:56] you see that's the that's that's some of
[1:33:59] uh uh the the the problem the the the
[1:34:03] the the the Hebrew heart coming out of
[1:34:06] Egypt
[1:34:08] their problem was they could not believe
[1:34:14] there there was something better than
[1:34:16] the city they came out of
[1:34:20] amen going in the desert meeting the Red
[1:34:24] Sea
[1:34:25] we didn't have to deal with sea we have
[1:34:27] swimming pools
[1:34:30] praise the Lord
[1:34:32] every time the the meter challenge their
[1:34:35] mind goes back to Egypt
[1:34:37] they try to think of
[1:34:40] they make you know they they compare
[1:34:43] what Egypt was with what their trial is
[1:34:48] that I would have been better been back
[1:34:50] in Egypt
[1:34:54] praise the Lord
[1:34:57] if we don't believe that what God has
[1:35:00] given us in this hour as the message of
[1:35:03] the hour that we can find all our
[1:35:07] questions
[1:35:08] the answer to all of our questions
[1:35:12] if we if we can't come to that place to
[1:35:14] believe that there is not an additional
[1:35:17] word coming God has already given us
[1:35:20] everything we need for the body change
[1:35:23] praise the Lord you see that's the thing
[1:35:26] that gives you the desire to such the
[1:35:29] message
[1:35:30] that's the thing that gives you that
[1:35:31] desire to look for your answers in the
[1:35:34] scripture
[1:35:36] because you believe that everything is
[1:35:38] here
[1:35:40] you don't have to look elsewhere
[1:35:45] the man that runs into the City of
[1:35:47] Refuge
[1:35:49] you can you can stop thinking about your
[1:35:52] bank account outside you will not go
[1:35:54] back there
[1:35:57] because if you step outside
[1:35:59] the adventure of blood is going to get
[1:36:01] you
[1:36:03] so you have to believe that every
[1:36:05] provision that is made in this city is
[1:36:08] enough
[1:36:13] praise the Lord
[1:36:16] it makes you to go get into Fellowship
[1:36:22] you believe uh you have confidence
[1:36:27] that as long as the high priest is alive
[1:36:31] amen
[1:36:36] you imagine after after you you tell
[1:36:40] your story
[1:36:43] and the time of sacrifice
[1:36:46] arrive in the high priest brings you
[1:36:49] alarm
[1:36:50] and say son
[1:36:52] for the wrong that you have done this
[1:36:55] line is going to be slave for you
[1:36:58] praise the Lord
[1:37:04] how you appreciate it because here is it
[1:37:06] now you are in the City of Refuge you
[1:37:08] you you are a refugee here you don't you
[1:37:11] don't you don't have a farm you can
[1:37:13] bring a lamp Now alarm is provided for
[1:37:15] you
[1:37:17] praise the Lord
[1:37:20] you first have to be grateful
[1:37:24] that I have a lamb
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:28] and the the the the the the confidence
[1:37:31] that it brings their eyes the priest
[1:37:34] takes you there and you lay your hand
[1:37:36] upon the lamb and you confess your fault
[1:37:41] the confidence that it gives you
[1:37:46] that the wrong that you have done
[1:37:49] has been placed under the blood of that
[1:37:52] bleeding lamb
[1:37:56] praise the Lord
[1:38:03] we have to remember that the worshiper
[1:38:05] was never
[1:38:07] on the examination
[1:38:11] amen
[1:38:14] the worshiper was never on the
[1:38:16] examination
[1:38:19] so he sees here that uh cadage speaks of
[1:38:22] righteousness he is our righteousness
[1:38:25] we can never be accused the second time
[1:38:28] speaks of
[1:38:31] a Shepherd he's the one that carried us
[1:38:35] praise the Lord he's he was the one that
[1:38:38] makes the provision there and then uh
[1:38:41] Hebron speaks of Fellowship
[1:38:44] and we have entered into fellowship with
[1:38:47] him
[1:38:48] praise the Lord
[1:38:51] bezel it speaks of Fortress
[1:38:54] he is our Fortress and in him we are
[1:38:57] safe
[1:39:01] praise the Lord
[1:39:05] he is our Fortress
[1:39:09] Raymond Raymond Gila speaks pretty much
[1:39:12] of the same it speaks of a height
[1:39:15] the word there means a height
[1:39:18] and uh and and yeah in the scripture
[1:39:22] that is associated with it goes directly
[1:39:24] back over to the book of Kings where he
[1:39:27] speaks of the city that Ahab wanted to
[1:39:31] go and redeem
[1:39:33] praise the Lord
[1:39:36] now brother Branham make us to realize
[1:39:40] Christ is revealed in his own word
[1:39:45] you talk about the Seven Seals you talk
[1:39:48] about the first horse rather you talk
[1:39:51] about uh uh the second horse rather you
[1:39:56] talk about the the the
[1:40:00] anointings of the living creatures and
[1:40:03] all of that he make us to realize that
[1:40:07] all of those things are there activities
[1:40:11] that happens around the seals
[1:40:14] but in Christ uh revealed in his own
[1:40:17] world brother Branham says what is the
[1:40:19] seal he said the seal is Christ
[1:40:26] the Lord
[1:40:29] amen
[1:40:31] the seal is Christ
[1:40:35] so you see this right from God's mind
[1:40:39] knowing the things that we would deal
[1:40:42] with
[1:40:44] there's there is there is a scripture
[1:40:45] over in the book of Deuteronomy let's
[1:40:48] read that chapter 5. uh I will I will
[1:40:52] soon close to you
[1:41:14] let's read verse 28 and verse 29.
[1:41:23] just for this uh prayer time
[1:41:27] chapter 5 verse 28.
[1:41:31] and the Lord year the voice of your
[1:41:35] words Moses now telling them
[1:41:38] when God spoke on the mountain
[1:41:43] and it was sounding like tundles
[1:41:45] and likely
[1:41:48] you have to remember now that's where
[1:41:50] Israel made their filter mistake
[1:41:52] in in Exodus chapter 19 word it says all
[1:41:56] that the laws here we would do now Moses
[1:41:59] is addressing them these are the last
[1:42:01] words of Moses he says and the Lord
[1:42:03] heard the voice of your words when ye
[1:42:07] speak unto me
[1:42:09] and the law said unto me I have heard
[1:42:11] the voice of the words of these people
[1:42:15] wish they have spoken unto thee
[1:42:19] they have well said all that they have
[1:42:23] spoken
[1:42:24] oh that there were such and hot in them
[1:42:31] praise the Lord
[1:42:33] that they who fear me
[1:42:36] now God is referencing to what their
[1:42:39] mouth said
[1:42:41] but he's looking at their heart
[1:42:45] they were saying all that the laws have
[1:42:47] said we would do
[1:42:49] and their heart will stay in Egypt
[1:42:58] all that there was such
[1:43:01] an heart in them
[1:43:03] that they will fear me
[1:43:06] and keep all my commandment always
[1:43:10] that it might be well with them
[1:43:13] and with their children
[1:43:16] forever
[1:43:17] he said I I hear I hear their word I I
[1:43:20] heard you know then and they spoke well
[1:43:23] they spoke seriously
[1:43:26] but they not they didn't know how the
[1:43:28] heart
[1:43:29] for what their mouth was saying
[1:43:41] praise the Lord
[1:43:44] our God is not an idol
[1:43:47] we did not make the god that we are
[1:43:49] worshiping he made us
[1:43:52] and he knows us better than we know
[1:43:55] ourself
[1:43:58] praise the Lord
[1:44:00] he know us better
[1:44:04] young people then we know ourselves he
[1:44:07] knows our struggle
[1:44:10] he knows our doubts he knows our fear
[1:44:14] praise the Lord
[1:44:16] let's tell him he already knows how can
[1:44:20] you hide something from someone that
[1:44:21] already knows
[1:44:27] let's tell him
[1:44:30] let's deal with God from the heart
[1:44:36] because he's not impressed only by the
[1:44:39] words he's looking at our heart he's
[1:44:41] looking at the heart that is behind your
[1:44:43] word
[1:44:47] the heart that is behind your appearance
[1:44:52] the heart that is behind your desires
[1:44:54] your your strength and all of that he's
[1:44:57] looking at the heart
[1:45:03] are we together
[1:45:04] all that all that there was such a heart
[1:45:09] in them
[1:45:11] if they really had the heart
[1:45:14] for the things that they were saying
[1:45:20] all that the Lord says we will do and in
[1:45:23] no time they were about to Stone Moses
[1:45:25] because we are tired with this with this
[1:45:28] manner with his fleshing and we want to
[1:45:30] get back to Egypt
[1:45:39] praise the Lord
[1:45:41] so my thought tonight of bringing
[1:45:44] they saw
[1:45:46] a subject of the City of Refuge is not
[1:45:49] to go into mystery or go into anything
[1:45:51] tonight
[1:45:53] is to just help us to see that he's not
[1:45:57] very far from our need
[1:46:00] in whatsoever area that we lead God he's
[1:46:03] not far
[1:46:06] that's what the city was placed in those
[1:46:09] positions that when the people had a
[1:46:11] need
[1:46:12] there will be a city for them to rush
[1:46:15] into
[1:46:16] God is not far from our need
[1:46:20] his hands are not too heavy
[1:46:23] his ears
[1:46:25] and that block that he can hear
[1:46:29] most of the time the problem with the
[1:46:33] church is the heart
[1:46:38] is the heart of the
[1:46:41] people we allow prayer to sit in our
[1:46:43] heart
[1:46:45] unforgiveness to sit in our heart
[1:46:53] jealousies and all of those things to
[1:46:55] sit in our heart
[1:46:59] then we cannot go on with God
[1:47:02] you know we we just have this form of
[1:47:04] appearance
[1:47:08] but as soon as something happened that
[1:47:11] something happened between uh a brother
[1:47:13] and a sister or the sister and says the
[1:47:16] heart comes out the things that we say
[1:47:20] you can't even believe that my goodness
[1:47:30] that's my thought tonight he is not far
[1:47:33] from our need
[1:47:35] he is not far from our need
[1:47:39] even if it is sickness in our body he's
[1:47:42] not far from it
[1:47:45] praise the Lord
[1:47:46] if there is mind battles that we're
[1:47:48] going through he's not far from it
[1:47:51] praise the Lord
[1:47:57] he's a present help
[1:48:02] of trouble
[1:48:04] no matter what we are dealing with
[1:48:08] brother Branham will always point us
[1:48:10] back look at your motives
[1:48:12] and your objectives it goes back to your
[1:48:15] heart
[1:48:17] all that there was such a heart in there
[1:48:22] see see see the mind of God
[1:48:25] that he was not giving things to these
[1:48:27] people
[1:48:28] to punish them let me give them
[1:48:30] commandment let me see how much they
[1:48:31] love me no
[1:48:35] he was looking at their heart

[1:49:26] to our Psalms we preach the word tonight

[1:49:31] about
[1:49:32] you see sometimes and even even being at
[1:49:35] being a minister
[1:49:37] you will see that uh
[1:49:41] sometimes that's that's the thing that
[1:49:43] drives the the preacher is the burden
[1:49:46] that he has on his heart
[1:49:48] the way he's feeling in his heart that
[1:49:50] the need the thing that he really want
[1:49:52] to bring to the people
[1:49:54] he goes all around the block and he's
[1:49:57] saying this and he's quoting this he's
[1:49:59] putting up another code

[1:55:50] the heart
[1:55:51] that he needs
[1:55:54] and not a Pentecost would break here
[1:55:56] tonight
[1:55:58] if there was such a heart in US

[2:13:45] brother Branham said just like how that
[2:13:48] raw was in the hands of Moses
[2:13:50] he says that's how the name of Jesus is
[2:13:53] to the church
[2:13:55] praise the Lord
[2:13:56] he says that's how the name of Jesus is
[2:13:59] to the church
[2:14:01] and uh
[2:14:03] he said if the Egyptian knew they would
[2:14:06] have just taken that role from Moses
[2:14:09] praise the Lord
[2:14:11] and when the name of Jesus is taken from
[2:14:13] the church that is that is very powerful
[2:14:16] that's very powerful trying to keep
[2:14:19] myself from preaching tonight
[2:14:21] but it's very powerful
[2:14:24] it's very very powerful
[2:14:27] you realize that is is right in the Ten
[2:14:29] Commandments the using of the Lord near
[2:14:32] me vain
[2:14:33] that's very powerful that's that's what
[2:14:36] has taken the power from the church
[2:14:39] because the name of the Lord is using
[2:14:42] vain
[2:14:43] the people are saying it
[2:14:45] and their heart
[2:14:47] is not in obedience to the world
[2:14:50] but let the Lord may the Lord be our
[2:14:52] help
[2:14:53] that's not the bride portion praise the
[2:14:56] Lord
[2:14:57] God has called us in this age and it's
[2:15:00] with the bride that Jesus is going to
[2:15:02] have the preeminence so he will have a
[2:15:05] people that will live up his name
[2:15:08] and he said if he be lifted up
[2:15:11] praise the Lord
[2:15:13] you will make all men to know amen so uh
[2:15:16] that's that's that that's the bride
[2:15:18] position
[2:15:19] but we can see why the church is in the
[2:15:23] condition it is
[2:15:25] because the name of the Lord is out of
[2:15:27] the church
[2:15:28] even though that we might be called this
[2:15:30] we might be called that but the name of
[2:15:32] the Lord is out of the church amen let's
[2:15:35] put him in this right place
[2:15:37] let's put him in his right place and uh
[2:15:40] the power will come back to the church
[2:15:42] the prophet of God said it will not be
[2:15:44] on our human effort you know he says it
[2:15:47] will surely be the grace of God back to
[2:15:49] the church and God is Desiring to move
[2:15:53] him on his people more than we are
[2:15:55] Desiring to see God move
[2:15:57] God is Desiring to heal his people his
[2:16:01] power to be seen we don't have to
[2:16:03] manufacture it
[2:16:04] we just have to line up with the word
[2:16:06] remember the brass Revival is lining up
[2:16:09] with the word the Lord bless you I will
[2:16:11] see you on Sunday pray for me I will
[2:16:14] pray for you
[2:16:16] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:16:24] blessed
