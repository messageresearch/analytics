lord praise the lord and go to see each and every one of you praise the lord good to see you brother matt how are you praise the lord praise the lord that's brother mike wilson you know i i really i was thinking about you just uh just before then i saw your call you know and after being praying i said lord you got to put some fire on the brother mac i need to see him you need to wake him up from uh one owner but it's good to see you how's your wife great she's doing good okay praise the lord praise the lord and now and we greet each and every one of you good to see you all in uh [Music] good to see you mom this morning that's my answer in the back there and uh praise the lord know uh i was following the service yes last week and uh i saw brother lawrence uh greeting you sister naomi uh good to see you since we last saw and it's good to have you back in church praise the lord amen amen we we are so thankful very thankful for the hope that we hold in our hearts amen and uh if you realize i've not even given my tribute to brother scott yet because it's a whole message that i have to preach so the reason is because i give every one of you three meanings if i should take more than three minutes it would not be just so i make it a message that i have to preach just to hide behind that cement and say everything that i want to say [Music] praise the lord the strange thing there is that i was just reading my first email that i got from him 2007. that was the first time he wrote me when i was back in africa i was reading that this morning and uh [Music] uh praise the lord but before i forget we will have community service the sunday after christmas that would be the last sunday of the year just because we will not be able to do with the teddy first night and i don't want to crowd the night up for whatever we might have going on so [Music] we should be the sunday after christmas we will definitely have communion and [Music] so let me uh send that out before i forget you but it's uh it's it's kind of a good it's good to to serve the lord jesus in the time that we are living in with everything that is that the word is happening that is happening around the world and uh the different faces and variants of kovic that is coming you know i was just just talking that all the time you know it was just just like it was in egypt there was one plague after another praise the lord you know brother brandon 1956 he said we were we were we were hitting troubling waters you know and and and there were things that was going to hit the earth uh uh you know [Music] the doctors will now find keto and we realized that these things are unfolding in the time that we are living but what a privileged people we are to have been told by a prophet praise the lord that's the privilege that we have that's the benefit that we have you know when when when you are warned then you know uh it it erase the fear it takes away the fear you don't have to be afraid because you have already been told that this will happen and you've been told how to prepare yourself you know just like jesus warning his disciple he that is on the hill let him not come down on the housetop don't come down in the field you just stayed there because there were horrible things that was going to be for jerusalem at that time you know so uh you know like the nigerians who said no shaking we are right here no shaking come what may praise the lord the church of the living god is moving on amen and our direction is upward to the rapture amen that's our direction so we just i want to comfort ourselves we want to encourage ourselves you know we want to get away from you know all those childish things we want to now instead looking into the face of the one that we love we want to start beholding his face we want to start expressing our hearts to him amen not just talking from our lips but expressing our hearts the inner of our hearts praise the lord and all of those things you know i was just i was just looking at something this morning you remember before we left uh or just before uh we had a kind of a change around the church in the sense of home going to brother scouting all of that we were talking a little bit on the subject of of of teaching and uh [Music] and i realized you know like brother branham said he said that uh the church was promised the letter rain and the former rain [Music] and one of those rain was scoring the the latter rain was the sowing rain and the former rain was the harvest rain praise the lord and the leather rain in another sense it was the calling rain [Music] amen praise the lord and uh or the former rain was the calling rain sorry i'm getting both of the mix of year and and the letter rain is the teaching rain and i feel in my heart that [Music] if there is ever the time that the church need to be taught is this time i was just reading that this morning or last night uh uh brother branham says he says that's a problem with pentecostal people he says uh uh we have not been taught you know we have all of this information that we call the message yes praise the lord but the reason why we're not rightly using it is because we have not been taught you know and i think that's that's one of the that's one of the things that the holy ghost is kind of for measuring on even in our individual lives he's majoring on getting us to be taught in the way that he's dealing with us personally on the church getting us to be taught of what he want to achieve in the body praise the lord and and and as soon as we understand that there will be no need for a right race there would be no need of comparing one with another there will be no need of all of these things that we have been seeing and happening so we pray that the lord will help us amen we pray that the lord will help us amen praise the lord [Music] by wednesday night as i started the subject and i want to go i want to just go back to that a little bit and uh just to you know reintroduce myself back to the pulpit after the thanksgiving meetings with brother andrews then we had another weekend we brought a team so i feel like a stranger praise the lord so i need to need to warm myself up back to the people amen but let's stand to our feet and there is there's a there's a chorus that we used to sing is it's an old [Music] southern african chorus humble yourself before the lord amen and he will lift you up praise the lord amen amen humble yourself before the lord god he will lift you up you know this the the speaker the sound is so much in my ear that it looks like i'm listening to someone else but it's good amen let's go now humble yourself [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] up [Music] [Applause] [Music] will lift you [Music] have to up is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that was a good process but we didn't get it yet we are not there yet now you see some of these songs they have their origin praise the lord i'm i'm i'm hearing all the liberian word of singing it you are not the same you are not the one that composed these songs these songs have their origin you might think the way you're singing it that's how they sing it unless you go back to the origin of the song somebody wrote it that's right praise the lord praise the lord so we it's good we're getting there yet amen i just i was trying to get a little feed about you amen amen let's try it again [Music] [Applause] [Music] all you have to do is [Music] humbly [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all you have to do [Music] [Applause] he will lift you up [Music] before [Music] oh yes he will let he will lift you up [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen and you know how god left us up we want to go up when we lift him up praise the lord hallelujah you don't want to go above the lord you know amen satan tried to do it one time he cast enough and the way he lift us up is when we lift up lift him up jesus said if i be lifted up yes i will draw all men unto me amen the way up is down amen praise the lord hallelujah thank you musicians that will be all for the music amen we were learning the song on sun on wednesday night so please remind me on wednesday so we can we can make another practice again before we forget and it become a history let's go to ask chapter 2 this morning i wanna i wanna go back to what i spoke on wednesday night uh the redemption rob but this morning i i wanna i wanna entitle a redemption god's deliberate plan redemption it was a deliberate plan but let's read as chapter 2 this morning praise the lord amen it's good to see each and every one of you good to see you jonathan amen what a wonderful jesus we serve praise the lord what a wonderful jesus yourself let's ask chapter 2. let's uh let's read from verse 22. i want to read this repeated message brother branham said he was standing on a soapbox when he preached you know brother brandon he added i don't know where he took all of those things from he said peter just got himself a soapbox and stand on there begin to say yeah man of ezra hear these words jesus of nazareth a man a proof of god among you by miracles and wonders and sign which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourself also known amen nicodemus testified to that he said we know that no man can do this except god be with him so peter is saying that you people knew that you knew that you discussed it in your counsel that he was a man sent from god well verse 23 he said him being delivered by the determined counsel and full knowledge of god so peter is making us to understand that jesus was actually placed in the hands of the sahendra council by god determined counsel amen let's follow the reading there now he said don't boss to think that you got a hold of him no him being delivered by the determined counsel and full knowledge of god yeah have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain so in one sense he's saying god by god determined counsel he delivered him and then you by wicked hands you took him oh praise the lord whom god have raised up having lose the uh the pains of death because it was now possible right that he should be in holding of faith for david speaking concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glide moreover also my flesh shall rest him hope because thou will not leave my sword in hell neither will thou suffer that holy one to see corruption now as we as we spoke on this before just to just to bring you back to that and uh for us to realize here that david year was speaking in the first person you see the entire mystery of the godhead is the mystery of the first person that is revealed in the second and the day so if we don't understand the mystery of the first person there is no way you will understand the godhead because there are many places in the bible where the prophets of all spoke in the first person so david year is speaking in the first person i saw my lord always before my face and i shall not be moved my heart shall rejoice my tongue shall be glad my flesh shall rest in hope for he will not leave my soul in hell david was speaking as he was speaking of himself but actually it was christ in david let's buy our house together we'll talk a little bit on there before we get into our thoughts this morning heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus we want to ask your blessings upon your word thank you for the spirit of worship as we continue to ask that you pour such a spirit in our midst lord father because we know it prepares the hearts it prepares the minds of the people it takes away stress and worry lordy give us an entrance into your presence so lord i pray that father in the name of jesus christ this morning if there is one that have not breakthrough this morning lord to be fully surrounded and on the expectation to receive from you only you can pull us through we ask the lord you get ahold of us this morning father may there be nothing oh god father to create a hindrance or distraction lord we want to receive from you take your word break it to our hearts this morning speak to us in a way our soul will understand and our heart will rejoice bless us now in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seat and while you you take your sita uh we will we will look at uh uh we will look at some few uh chapters in the bible and let's look at psalm chapter 16 psalm chapter 16. because i've been i've been kind of a dwelling on this mystery of the first person and uh because there are many things that have that have created you know uh uh doctrines that should not create doctrines you know uh brother brahms says i'll rather straight again it created a return ministry doctrine but it should not if you understand the mystery of the first person you will not you will not uh you know you will not be expecting brother branham you'll be expecting the holy spirit that rolled through that ministry to come back again and ride on his bride he was just only speaking in the first person not meaning him william branham but speaking just like david spoke let's look a few of that in and uh and and just trust that lord hepa psalm chapter 16 verse 10. david said they they are enclosed in their own thoughts with their mouth they speak proudly they have now come oh i'm reading something different oh yeah supposed to be reading 16 reading in 17. i think that's what we just read verse 8. i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand this is david talking many years before peter will pick that in the book of arts and say when david spoke he was speaking that was the spirit of christ but those that were standing around david in david's church will think that david was talking about himself praise the lord they would think that david was talking about himself that's that's the whole thing about the godhead that's what make the godhead so complicated uh uh like like uh like uh paul would say great is the mystery of godliness it's so complicated to the complicated mind to the people that want to overthink it amen are we together therefore my heart is gliding and and my glory rejoice my flesh shall rest in hope for that i will not leave my soul in hell anybody's anybody around david you know there was nobody there that heard him saying this that would think that it was christ they did not know about it what a privileged people we are america amen psalm chapter 89 the same thing over here in psalm chapter 17 you read you just hear a bunch of uh voices of psalm chapter 89 let's let's take let's take uh uh and then i will show you something again psalm chapter 89 verse 27 david cried out here all the psalmist said let me let me say that [Music] also i will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth praise the lord you go over image in john chapter 3 you will see where that psalm is fulfilled you know in st john chapter 3 that's that's where the fulfillment of that is but look at one of the the most common one that might help us here for us to go this is not actually what i'm preaching on i just got caught in it because of that we read in that's chapter two but look at first samuel chapter 10 look out for samuel chapter 10 first samuel chapter 10 praise the lord first time in chapter 10 verse 8 i think the the technicians back there can help us faster than i can get to it but chapter 10 verse 8 is that what i said yes i said david said and thou shalt go down no this was samuel talking to saul and thou shalt go down before me to give god and behold i will come down on today to offer burnt offering and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offering seven days shall doubt harry till i come today and show them what thou shalt do samir is giving saul an instruction but look at chapter 13 look at chapter 13. let's look at chapter 13. chapter 13 verse 13. you know the story samuel gives i saw this instruction saw god there he started doing his own thing and then when samuel came verse 13 the bible says and samuel said unto saul thou has done foolishly thou have not kept the commandments of the lord thy god now saul could have a serious argument with samuel and said when you told me down there you never said the law said praise the lord when you told me back there to come you never said the lord said you said i should do this thing like like you command me but here samuel is saying you did foolishly because you never heed it to the commandments of the lord so what was happening when samuel was instructing saul he was speaking in the first person and saul just took it casually like okay okay i'm just listening to you he said you have not kept the commandments of the law thy god which he have commanded thee for now will the lord have established that kingdom upon israel forever what saul talk simple and common rip the kingdom from honor him why because he never honest to the mystery of the first person that's what people are going into idolatry that's why people are stumbling and say brother branham said this because they never understood the mystery of the first person this ministry was now william branham ministry it was the ministry of their son of man that was revealed in this generation let me read something to you and uh i got my i want to talk about redemption a little bit here but let me read something to you brother graham says peffect i i don't have it down there though as sister fate it's not part of my notes i'm reading from from another notes i'm reading from a little bit of something i preached last week while i was away he says the great physician this is from perfect faith who is here these sons shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and if you say to this mountain be they are removed and don't doubt in your heart he says whatever you ask and don't doubt in your heart but can believe that he can create score he says who has no way at all of or nothing there to believe way it's my faith that goes and does that my faith in what he challenged me to ask you know now brother branham comes down here he's he's building the fate of the people he says he says i'm your brother standing as your brother an intercessor trying my best to hold you before god i'm standing here right before the white throne now he's in jeffersonville and he says i'm standing here right before the white truth now praise the lord do you see how a statement like that can make people to go wide oh my goodness he was before the white room judgment if you understand the mystery of the first person or you understand representation by predestination or by condemnation you will know that god just like the wave sheep that he weighed before the congregation thou won't she represent the rest of the field the rest of the crop that is in the field praise the lord god has always worked with representation brother branham says he says i'm i'm your brother i'm uh standing as your brother and an intercessor trying my best to hold the people before god i'm standing right before the white throne now pointing my finger at that bloody sacrifice did and speaking through his name that it is done praise the lord so it's impressive he said another one talking about the same ministry of intercession he says there's there will be a lot of a lot of impersonation he said here come the lamb that was slain come back to make intercession watch him there will be a lot of impersonation a lot of everything else but there was really somebody was going to be saved the church was predestinated without spot or wrinkle she's going to be there and the lamb died the lamb died for that purpose that's what i'm going to do on this morning and then when when the last name on the book was redeemed listen to this now when the last name on the book was redeemed he said the lamb came forth and took the book i'm the one that did it praise the lord oh my goodness he's the lamb amen he said i'm the one that did it oh my goodness he's the lamb tracey's birth go and get his birth certificate he was not virgin born so what is that ministry doing speaking in the first person that's all he was doing he was not making himself god he was not making himself the lamb he was only speaking in the first person are we together now so this morning we want to talk let me go to my subject because it looks like i'm i'm getting on the trail yet amen and i see all you message people just just looking at me praise the lord thank god there's a door here i can get out amen not this winter cold money though well uh wednesday night we were talking on the redemptive rock where we we we talked the subject from uh uh first timothy chapter two adam was not deceived so that's why we were talking on wednesday night and brother branham called that the redemptive rob so uh we we treated that called their position of the believer in christ but let's read uh our first first timothy chapter two like we did wednesday night and uh first two minute chapter two you see people what i'm trying to do when i when i kind of throw some of these things out is the other you know uh sometimes people say well we don't really know his position my position is in christ in a way and uh you know while uh esther and all of those all of those virgin girls that were going to be wife to the king there in the time of esther there was a reason why each one of them was giving chamberlains to take care of them is because there there's a certain time to go before the king there's a setting close to where there is a certain way to walk uh uh i mean now because uh the king wanted a bride and and they were virgins so i mean they could just come in and and do and no they were giving chamberlain so they could be taught praise the lord they could be taught how to walk before the king how to dress and and the things to do they could be taught a little bit of royalty and i believe that's what the holy spirit is doing for us amen praise the lord he's uh he's he's trying to teach us royalty how to approach this holy god amen praise the lord and i saw we we read here the first time to chapter 2 for adam was first formed than eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression praise the lord amen now we know adam was first formed in eve you realize that this talks about genesis 2 7 and not genesis 1 26 because it's in genesis 2 7 that man was formed from the dust of the earth so what paul was dealing with here is chronological order are we together paul was dealing with chronological order paul was not dealing with uh rulership and leadership no he was dealing with the order that god brought eve adam and eve because we all know in genesis 1 26 both of them was represented are we together and adam was not deceived by the woman being deceived was in the transgression now so we read here the uh on wednesday night position in uh of the believer in christ let me check something here okay i'm only checking to make sure that i throw my notes back there adam adam he says adam sinned it and and and condemned and was driving you know from the garden of eden see the redemptive robe over him show that well what i said that adam seen willfully praise the lord amen and then wednesday night we read also from hebrew he that sin wayfalling he that sin wayfully that's why hebrews said that's what paul said after knowing the knowledge of the truth there remained no more sacrifice and brother branham is saying adam seemed wavefully but eve was deceived so which one of them deserve the mercy of god it's the one that was deceived when it comes to justice the man that did it willfully must be condemned are we together adam seemed wavefully see eve was actually deceived but adam was not deceived he deliberately he deliberately so this morning i want to show i want to speak on redemption god deliberate plan redemption was a deliberate plan of god [Laughter] god was deliberate in putting you in the family that he puts you in he was deliberate in bringing you at the time that he brought you praise the lord amen what do you want your name to be jones or what god was deliberate very deliberate to give you your height he was so much deliberate that he count the number of hair on your head praise the lord if mine is more than yours is because he gave me the big head and he had to fill it up glory to god thank you jesus i love you for the big head he was deliberate praise the lord he was very deliberate when he thought of what gender to make you he was deliberate that's the reason why he did not ask your contribution he did not seek counsel from anybody because he was very deliberate his determined counsel that's the way the apostle peter said by his determined counsel he brought us coronavirus he allowed coronavirus by his determined council redemption is god's deliberate plan praise the lord are you ready for me this morning amen are you ready adam was now deceived he deliberately sinned amen deliberately ignoring what he was doing because of his wife he took position with his wife praise the lord he was deliberate he took position with his wife my goodness my my my mind praise the lord are we together amen he says then they went before god and both of them were condemned and jesus not ignorant of what was he not not ignorant of what he was doing came down and took his place with the sinner the church that he might redeem the church back to himself praise the lord that he might redeem the church he was not ignorant of what he was doing so it's it's it's pretty much that what god allowed in the life of adam was just a type it was to give us a preview of what the second adam would do are we together oh thank god for for a prophet amen that can be able to help us and bring bring these things because i mean uh uh we read it right there in the bible the bible says eve was deceived but yeah we get so mad with her amen and people would preach messages and and and and talk about eve and talk about woman and you know they were just use their statement she was deceived she quit to be deceiving and just knock her down to the ground praise the lord and not realizing that when we do that we're not even leaving any hope for ourselves because we are in the representation of eve you being a man you are not adam when it comes to this just like the preacher that says no illegitimate children will go to heaven i wonder how i would make it he said he wonder how he would make it because he's born illegitimate if you don't believe you'll go to heaven why are you preaching can be more righteous than the lord of god no you can be are we together he says but adam did sin but he did it with his eyes while open intimidating that adam was not the adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression see eve actually taught she was right she actually thought she was she was arguing with the serpent god i mean when the serpent told her the first thing she refused no god said we should know he only got into that channel of reasoning with her amen and make her to oh wow i never saw it like that no but he could not do it to adam praise the lord amen are we together now so he says here she actually thought she was right but sit on deceive her but he didn't deceive adam he knew it was wrong but because of the love for his wife praise the lord can't you see yourself in that for god so love the word can't you see it and christ represented himself with his church full of sin and was condemned and his soul went to hell that's right and god raised him up on the third day you believe that it wasn't that he he it wasn't dead he didn't sin he did god wouldn't have sent him to help heal he had to send him to hell condemned because he took our sins and christ did not righteous he died as sinner see christ never seen himself but he took our sin upon him praise the lord and we and we spoke a little bit about the the the scapegoat the two goats amen are we together praise the lord so as as we look at this we realize the other god play our redemption praise the lord he played our redemption right from the beginning even in the first chapter of the bible redemption is played out all through the scripture god was sounding out this plan of redemption because we have to realize that was god's major purpose of time the reason why the internal god the self-existent god will leave that state of being self-existent internal spirit to create something was all because he had a plan in his mind that's why brother branham called his one goal praise the lord amen you know when i read crisis the mystery of god revealed many years back it's uh it's funny sometimes the way your mind runs on things and whether is the law that help you to understand things like that or whether you know it is the way you are but now one of the reason that is because you know i i used to love soccer and as they do and uh uh so reading crisis the mystery of god reveal and yerin brother branham talking about uh god having one goal all that runs to my mind is that when you play in the soccer game and you defeat the opponent one goal oh my goodness nothing hurts then winning one god you know because it's a game that is so tight yes but for you to just scroll one goal and it can redeem oh my goodness i mean that's all you surround to my mind you know as a young man reading the the message so i had in the back of my mind that we had one god against the enemy that he would never be able to redeem and we would come on the other side as the winning team but that was god's one god god's one purpose it was an internal purpose that plan of redemption the reason why there is a creation is because of redemption that's that's all god wanted to achieve because redemption allowed god to manifest his attributes that's the reason why it was called the seven redemptive names redemption is it's all it's all that i mean that's that's that's the whole story that's that's a story about salvation that's the reason why a five-fold ministry was giving when jesus says i would build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it it was not because of having meager church the plan was because of the plan of redemption that's god's one goal god's one purpose that's the reason why as children of god we we must get there at the back of our mind when we're dealing with ourselves and we are dealing with others don't deal with them because oh i'm angry at them redemption must be the thing that is driving us that's god's only purpose for time the only reason why what the great internal spirit will condescend condition break down to become an element it's all because of redemption praise the lord and god was deliberate with that plan he was deliberate he was deliberate in making known his attributes and one of the way he could do it was to be able to form his own enemy praise the lord and in our side the bible says lucifer was made perfect god made him perfection that's what that's that's the way the bible says he was made imperfection so he he god made a perfect enemy the only one that could that could be able to bring out his attribute you see that's that's what happened when a person is determined when a man or a woman is determined that i will do this you don't become determined and allow people to to facilitate you with what you need you're just bragging when you say i would do it just see i would do it and you're not doing anything about it you are just bragging when the person is determined you get to work i would do it you start bringing things together i said i would do this thing you start bringing things together then you are determined if you're just telling us i will do it and we can't see anything we know you're just bluffing it's just it just it's just uh uh some fancy word but god was determined and because he was determined he left his internal glory he left the state of being self-existent he broke himself down and condescended to become the logos he reduced himself to become tangible and then he created his own adversary i will make you so perfect that you will not miss one's part of your job you see that's the reason why we are not creating perfection our perfection is not to do everything right our perfection comes back to the world but satan's perfection he was made that way he will he's perfect in lying perfect in deceiving that he's perfect in everything that is evil because god is a perfect god he had to make a perfect enemy [Laughter] that's a determined god praise the lord well you see he never makes satan in a way when satan would try and says no i'm tired i'm tired no i'm tired no you know he put an element in the devil that the devil is never tired let's stay the whole day let rebuke him let's breathe as now you step outside he's waiting for you that one element he gave the devil he's never tired [Music] oh my goodness automatic god we self praise the lord but of adam says greatness is not seen in outward appearance he said when you see great men are the man that brings himself down to your level praise the lord i was reading a story offer of a veteran that fought in one of the wars he was one of the survivors fell down from the parachute the god captured and all of that and then after he got released and came back lost all his body he went to the academy i think it was the navy academy and he applied as a civilian to be a journalist and he was a journey to cleaning the bathroom and cleaning every word but uh i think he did it to kind of for you know uh ease his mind to stay get the feeling of the military but every time the the the the young soldiers will want to talk to him he would just greet them he would not want to get in conversation with him so there were some boys that decided to say well we need to check on this guy so one of the boys went and made some research just by his name and find out that this was a veteran this was a man that survived a war that don't need to be a janitor he need to be honored why are we having him as a janitor when we are all young soldiers just running around we have never faced any battle this man survived a war he survived prison so they got their group together they make they make a plea and something like that that was during the time of reagan so i think it was uh either a veteran day amphorce is the one of those ones and uh uh and and president reagan decided to celebrate it on that camp to honor this man that have worked there for many years and all of these young people they will come from the bathroom and you know master place of wastewater hey come and clean it he was honored that day he was decorated and can you imagine how many of those boys thought if they if they ever they spoke to him rudely what might have gone through their mind oh my god wow greatness is not in appearance greatness is in character that the creator of heaven and earth come down can't be seen praise the lord create a universe and step out of it and allow us to choose what we want to do he stepped out of faith and people says where is god if there is a god why all of these things are happening if he can t if he can create it which means he have it under control praise the lord he have it honor control he have a spare path for everything that he have created praise the lord and we can make choices and we can do what we want to do it's my life i can do whatever i want to do with faith and the creator will just sit there and look at you paul says they are worshiping the creatures than the creator praise the lord i've been studying the book of romans a little bit we've been reading the home but i've been personally studying it and i realize when i look into some of the account the book of romans is one of scala says one of the unique piece of literature the book of romans romans chapter 1 will tell you about the unconverted man called the pagan every unconverted man is pigging whether you were born in a message or you're born out of the message until you are converted you are a pagan praise the lord romans the way paul treated the book of romans man as i was studying through us is my goodness what a treasure then romans chapter 2 bring us the moral man praise the lord and many times around the message we go through these stages we get saved and then we become more a people we get good morals that don't have nothing to do with salvation we just learn the dress code we learn the message called how to greet how much feet to stand away from a brother or from a sister praise the lord then romans chapter 3 talks about the religious man he's not saved yet he was a pagan he just moved to good morals he don't cost any more praise the lord and now he move over to being religious that's where that's when he's dangerous because he can go on the airstream anybody that don't believe that he cut them off you go into hell this message is not for everybody this message this message is hot it's hard and you save he's just a religious guy what am i preaching this morning people praise the lord where did i slept last night glory be to god i woke up this morning at five o'clock i thought it was 6 00 am and then it took me almost 30 minutes for me to realize that it's not 6 am so you can see where i woke up this morning oh praise the lord we are talking about god determine counsel young people if we don't understand these things we'll make a shipwreck of ourselves that's why many have packed their bibles and they're selling their message book on amazon because they have made a shipwreck of themself let's get back to subject here this plan of redemption you know what socrates said socrates one of the the greek wise men that live many centuries before christ he said he said i think to believe that deity can forgive but i don't know how his struggle is how can a holy god reconcile a sinful man how he was one of the wisest man in his generation but yet he could not see redemption because redemption comes by revelation god has to reveal it to you he says i think to believe deity can forgive but i don't know how praise the lord that was the thing that struck luther habakkuk 2 4 that's where the prophet said the just shall live by faith praise the lord one of luther frank gave him that verse before he went to rome the first time praise the lord amen when he went to rome his first time you have to remember that he wanted to be become a lawyer because his his father had a shoe making shop and he never wanted to end up like his father so he went into steady but he had a friend that died and that troubled him of word when he spent eternity and because of that he he he changed course and he went to become a monk those were the people that dedicated himself those days to catholicism to get closer to god they walk they crawl on breaking a breaking bottles because the church taught them that you got to afflict yourself jesus suffer you got to suffer more than him and he did all of that but there was a constant struggle in him he realized that he could never never attain to the righteousness of god he tie ropes in his room he hang himself up for many nights hang himself up in the night until in the morning he just hang like that when he tired he get down he realized he have not even gone closer to the righteousness yet praise the lord then he decided to travel to rome he wanted to go and meet the the the the catholic hop and see how things are done there maybe when i get closer to the pope i might get holy but when he got closer that's when he saw his biggest disappointment in the church he saw the abuse the way young women that were that were kept to be uh uh a symbol of marriage in in in uh chastity and all of that the abuse that was happening he just couldn't stand it on his way back then he remember habakkuk two 2-4 the just shall leave by faith praise the lord the scripture started ringing in his ears just like isaiah said this way this is the way walk here in it you will not turn to the right you will not turn to the left but you will hear that this is the way and it was echoing in his head and he got back home and started reading the bible so the book of romans was was one of luther's favorite book because there where he honors to the righteousness of god the righteousness of god that has been attributed to us praise the lord especially when the scripture says no man seek after god amen if no man seek after god then everything is god's own initiative he fined us he called us because he predestinated us and he cleans us and he lives his life through us are we together so that's god's determined oh god deliberate plan his his determined counsel god was so determined that he makes he make his own adventure and and make him so perfect he was determined that he that he predestinated us praise the lord and in doing that he set out the time that we will come praise the lord oh church what what a comfort what a counsel let's look at the scripture yamato looks in luke chapter four see luke chapter four adam was not deceived the next time you read that scripture you will not think about yourself because sometimes some of us brothers we used to settle that asset you know in the house that's why the bible say adam was not deceived using that scripture you're kicking yourself out of grace because you are not adam see luke chapter four let's take males in luke chapter 4 comes out here right after this great notable statement this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears jesus has just made that statement verse 22 and all bear him witness and wonder are the gracious words that proceed out of his mouth and they said it's not this joseph's son and he and he said unto them yeah will surely say unto me this perfect physician heal their self whatsoever we have heard on in companion do also here in this country in that country and he said verily i said unto you no prophet is acceptable it's accepted in his own country are we together now listen to this now but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heavens were shot for three years and six months when great farming was throughout all the land he said many widows but but onto none of them was elias sin served the the the seraphtide a city of sedum onto a woman that was a widow and many lepros were in the were in israel in the time of elisha the prophet and none of them was claiming seth nema the syrian and all they in the synagogues when they heard these things were filled with wrath and rose up and trust him out of the city praise the lord now when he took the book and read the spirit of the lord god is upon me for he have anointed me praise the lord the bible says the eyes of of of them all in the synagogues were fasting on him and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled but then jesus continued and he brought this thing about the time of elijah and the time of elisha now do you realize or do you realize wha what actually got them angry few minutes ago they were so captured that he walked right into their cylinders stuck the pulpit open the straw now realize now when jesus spoke about the time of elijah which is dear prophet what kind of a woman did he associate a gentile woman when he talked about elisha which was also a prophet of israel who did he associate a gentile king now so what troubled then the subject of election so all that jesus was talking about was the plan of redemption there were many widows only one election there were many lepers only one election are we together now because there is a bunch of religious people that believe that they are the seed of abraham they are the people of god we are in the message and here jesus in their own church is telling them that this plan of redemption is bigger than you this plane of redemption god's plan of redemption is older than you is from the foundation of the world from the back part of god's mind don't interpret it to your own convenience praise the lord don't interpret it to your own convenience because we have that way of interpretation that's the reason why one time we are elect and another time we are not elect this is a determined council this is a deliberate plan of god if he has to break your legs to get you in he's determined and he will do it if he has to stick you on a sick bed and get iv all around you for you to get your heart right god is deliberate he will do it this is a determined council [Music] that's the reason why ananiah said paul sword is hard to kick against the praise the approach is a very sharp object you can kick against the nail can you see a nail and kick it you know what will happen this is a determined council people young people god they not made a mistake to pass you through the parents that you came through and to have this message laying on your laps [Music] praise the lord it will either make heaven comes easy for you thank you thank you oh i will take you to hell and bring you back praise the lord this is a determined counsel god is deliberate he's deliberate in what he's doing to have you sitting down here this morning he meant it he taught about it praise the lord but my wisdom called me yesterday we're talking he says yeah i'm coming over brother i'm tired of sitting down here i said well okay i'm just tired sitting down here i need to come out a little bit when god is determined he's determined god had his mind made up you you are the one that now is thinking i have my mind made up his mind being made a long time you just made up your mind praise the lord i have my mind made up and i won't turn back his own being made a long time he don't know where back is that's right yes praise the lord the god that don't sleep and don't slumber he knows what he's doing and he mean it praise the lord he mean it glory be to god if he promised to give you the holy ghost he mean it hallelujah and he's going to do anything everything whether you say amen or not god is going to do everything to get that holy ghost down in you and give you peace and then see what you would do with him praise the lord he's determined that's what redemption is all about it's a deliberate thing of god it took god from his self-existent state this is not a church matter it's not a doctrine matter it's something that god is attached to he said i would get a church without spot or wrinkle praise the lord amen and he mean it god mean it so don't look at your church and judge the bride don't look at your personal life and george the bride the god that had promised that god have said it is more than able to produce a church if you are not up to it god is up to it some of you young people you think you're smart but no matter what move fast there is always an eye that sees it praise the lord that's something that god placed in nature no matter what moves fast there will always be something that will see it you saw that what praise the lord oh my job what is he jehovah god he's a redeemer hallelujah he's here in this building now confirming his word he live in rain he's gone redeemer he's the kingfolk to me he become my brother he is my god he's my savior he is my coming king he's my healer he's my father he's my mother he's all that i have in this world all in the word to come praise the lord how little with this delegates of this uh association ever remember when when they think of redemption even till the time from the very beginning they will recognize it and and and when we are the palm bearing group that comes up watch in the blood of the lamb with palms in their hands and white robes and and we will take our position at the seat of the throne of the father or the throne of the son of david sorry hallelujah we we we will sing redemption songs to him yes oh hallelujah all show we will yonder to see adam and eve that first little sweetheart there in the garden of eden i see adam there when he put his arm around his little sweetheart to walk out with her for god i condemned him and he started out with his arm around around his darling adam was not deceived he didn't have to walk out but he walked out because he loved his wife when you read for god so loved the word adam never had a choice amen he didn't have a choice there was no choice in his mind he never had another option i said well if you don't make your life right i'll kick you out to him that was just the thing to do he came home eve all crying all crying and weeping he just came home embraced her and she telling me everything there was no time to say what was that who was that for god why we were yet sinners why we were yes sinners wicked in our hearts evil christ died for us put his redemptive wrath on us while we were yet sinners praise the lord preaching away from home i started that subject you never had time to get back to it but i've been thinking about it lately i was preaching on the abuse and trying to show that the reason why we have all the complex and things that we deal with is because our first birth was on abuse they abuse between the serpent and eve we all fall under that right that's why we deal with all of the things that we deal with praise the lord is because our natural birth is an abuse you see that's the reason why the new birth is not a suggestion jesus said must you must be born again that's the only way for you to be free from this abuse amen and the tendency of people that are abused thinking that they are protecting they always turn to abuse others i don't want to go ahead of myself we'll have time to look into it if the lord allowed us to praise the lord then we will appreciate the ministry of malachi 4 praise the lord it will not only be a message of doctrine and calls in order for us god really sent us a prophet to deliver us from religious abuse from every form of abuse that's what the holy ghost is for hallelujah that's what the holy ghost is giving for praise the lord thank you lord when you identify things why things are happening it's easy to bring you some level of grace because some people get so mad with themselves why this thing keep happening to me my life oh god just kill me but it's not your fault you were just abused you are just reacting to an abuse now think about a child living in a home maybe the parent the father never beats their child but they see how much abuse their mother is taking it affects the child praise the lord the child can be in class and the teacher is talking to another hey you stop sleeping they just kept fighting why because that's all the witness at home child is abused emotionally and that's what our first birth produce david said in sin did my mother conceive me come into the word speaking lies because of the abuse that's the first thing we turn to we we turn to lie because we are afraid don't look at your natural home and natural family and natural things that you have gone to retracing this back to the beginning that's what took place in eating he deceive her and abuse her and then in genesis he becomes the accuser he's the abuser and the accuser praise the lord that's why we cannot break in our natural family as much as we love our family name and we must respect our parents but you cannot break in that line you have to come back to the new birth if there is anything we must glory in is the birth that comes by the sea incorruptible praise the lord can you imagine on a thanksgiving meeting preaching on the abuse after the service i started thinking what have i done i mean i'm supposed to be talking about giving thanks to god you know that one of the sisters told me say sir when i say we'll be talking on the abuse her daughter said what abuse my goodness why the church service tonight but all i was trying to tell the church is that if there is one thing we can be thankful for is that malachi 4 said behold i send elijah the prophet before the great and the dreadful dying we can be thankful that god sent us a prophet praise the lord amen if not we will have all been in different systems different churches doing horrible things and thinking that we are serving god will be doing horrible things and thinking that we are serving god we trust the lord let me just read this down and find a place to close here a far past my time let's think closely 4 000 years later yandere in the center of jerusalem let's change the saying and look reading from job here he says come down the street jerusalem bumpy bumpy bomb out of the gate of damascus jan the ghost towards gogota a little fellow with a crown on his little brown on his head and a cross over his shoulder look all over his back this little red spot what are they look back yonder where adam was leaving with his sweetheart growing under condemnation with a sh with a shadow of redemption somewhere because there was blood running over them somewhere there was a shadow he knew it and i heard something goes brother branham clapped he says what is that is that all bloody ships came beating up and down his legs god wrapped him in a bloody sheep's king praise the lord that's the reason why the bleeding word is our covering the bleeding word is the word for our day not an imaginary cavalry but when we walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood cleans us so the blood of god to every age is the light of god the message of the hour praise the lord how do we overcome walk in the light just walk is it difficult to walk the reason why you think it's difficult is because you want you you're trying to make stuff walk that's right this is what i'm saying pick up your legs no i'm doing i'm doing it too fancy walk am i making star no just walk just walk just walk walk in the light but we make it too complicated so i use my left foot before the right just walk just go walk in the light and more will unfold we want to understand before we start no just walk just walk just walk and more we unfold and you start finding that you have overburdened yourself what a god we self what a mighty god we sell just like we said on wednesday night that's the reason why paul in the boca for romans chapter five that was what we close with wednesday night let's just read there and we can close this up tonight amen hallelujah praise the lord in romans chapter 5 i was just listening to brother branham speaking on the same thing this morning condemnation by representation that was exactly what brother branham was talking about he says one man for one man's sin one man and an employee in in romans chapter 5 when he takes the subject verse 12 he says wherefore asked by one man sin enter into the word and death now he didn't say one woman paul never accused eve here he said one man why because it was the man that did it deliberately he never took an issue with the woman because she was deceived [Laughter] oh my the legalistic brothers are going to just blow my head off but that's fine i will just go before you amen i mean they're just going to blow me off what is god is preaching my goodness me brother branham says the woman she's out she's the weaker vessel the woman is the bad product of the woman my goodness when they don't realize that they also are honored that group that's why our invisible union brother branham said when paul preached the book of romans he said paul preached on a prophecy he was prophesying he was now very fascinated about a literal woman and the literal man he was preaching on a prophecy because he's the prophet praise the lord you see after the reformation that's when when martin luther stepped out and started to preach the church starts to break in the grace of god the people started to feel the fresh breath of aid oh my goodness the kind of things that the catholic church put on the people you got to pay money for this you seen you got to pay money i mean people were selling their farms starving their children just for indulgence and when he came out with that message the joshua led by faith the church started to breathe people cannot even find food in their house to eat you see that's the reason why different movement movement also followed that because there were a bunch of people that just drummed on the wagon preacher brother preaching they never even got the revelation we have in amish people we get a lot of their sins we get jehovah witness every one of them came out of that when a man does not understand the grace of god you will either become a legalist or you will make a disgrace out of grace you will either become a legalist jesus says they stop themselves from entering they stop everybody else but the prophet god said if i cannot walk like enoch i won't stand in the way of any man that has enough faith what a contract yes this message is this message is high now this message it's hard what is that that you make it hard oh this they can't believe it no they can be my family can believe this message because you're not living it right yes because you are not living a right you are not becoming sweet you need to enter romans chapter 4 and then go to romans chapter 5. you just been walking from one to three a pagan that had just had good morals and now he's religious very dangerous he can put bumps on himself and blow a whole plane off praise the lord that's what people been doing they put religious bomb on themselves and blow their whole family to hell misrepresent the word misrepresent the message and say i'm taking the stand this is god determined counsel praise the lord no man choose me in no man can write me off [Music] this is god determined counsel praise the lord god was deliberate when he choose you he never did it because of your parents no he did it because of his personal intention for your life and he mean it he mean it if a hand will have to come out and slap you for you to pay attention god mean it some of us that's what we want that's why we want lord if you can just slap me if god slaps you you will live praise the lord musicians you can come come let's just worship the lord let just thank god let's just thank god let's stand on our feet scenes for god should love the sin of such as ah amen i just can't get through all of my thoughts you're such a wonderful people to preach though amen i get used to the bad habit of preaching long now i go out i get in trouble they gotta bring begin bringing paper to me brother your time is out [Music] oh my father we thank you we thank you jesus it's something that is far beyond our mind to comprehend lord the lord that you love us thank you for your determined counsel thank you for your deliberate ads to our life lord when you bring trials in our life you are very deliberate you mean it lord when you allow us to go
