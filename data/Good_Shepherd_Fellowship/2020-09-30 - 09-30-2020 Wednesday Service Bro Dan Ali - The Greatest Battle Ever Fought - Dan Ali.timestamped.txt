[41:50] same message we just gave a different
[41:52] different topic

[41:57] you know so you know most of the time
[42:00] when i tell the brothers to testify
[42:02] you know they uh is is uh it could be
[42:06] something personal of their self it

[44:22] our most gracious and eternal father
[44:26] we thank thee once again for this
[44:29] opportunity that we have come

[44:55] started in us
[44:58] for we know without any shadow of doubt
[45:02] that will turn out good we are so very

[45:06] for tonight and for the time we have to
[45:10] spend before you
[45:12] we have driven far and near
[45:16] to come and worship and in return
[45:20] have you speak to us in any way it
[45:23] pleases tonight
[45:25] may you come and touch every heart lord
[45:27] touch every soul
[45:29] and quicken your word or god into our
[45:31] souls
[45:32] and let our name be honored in jesus
[45:35] name father we pray
[45:37] we're transgender amen
[45:40] shall we be seated
[45:44] god bless your saints
[45:55] i had a very very rough two days
[45:59] when i spoke with brother one on monday
[46:04] right away a message came into mind
[46:09] and i said no it's too long
[46:13] for a wednesday night
[46:16] so let me look for something that would
[46:19] complement the time
[46:23] so i right away i got another substitute
[46:27] and i was sure that was the message
[46:31] all through the night i thought about it
[46:34] went to work yesterday in the morning
[46:38] and then it happened it wasn't the
[46:40] message something else came in
[46:43] i said okay this is good our setting
[46:46] that was it
[46:48] this time preparation around 1
[46:51] 1 30 in the afternoon yesterday
[46:56] it changed again i got down i got
[47:00] another message
[47:03] driving home after work i realized no
[47:05] that wasn't the message
[47:08] only to realize that the first message
[47:10] that came to me and i said it was too
[47:12] long
[47:13] was the message i was coming to talk
[47:15] about tonight
[47:17] and i spent time
[47:22] preparing of course we never put our
[47:25] hopes in our preparation
[47:28] and then i went to bed around around 11
[47:31] last night
[47:35] went to work this morning had my notes
[47:40] to get them on the computer i did the
[47:43] first one
[47:44] on my lunch break came the second time
[47:49] and i realized the notes were gone
[47:53] not knowing when i came on break
[47:57] and i was leaving i had a paper towel in
[47:59] my hands
[48:01] and i heard the notes and i dumped all
[48:04] in the trash
[48:08] so that was very very interesting so i
[48:11] was thinking about it
[48:13] i said no thank god
[48:16] even without a nose by the grace of god
[48:18] we'll have service tonight
[48:20] but praise be to his holy name that i
[48:23] have a bit of it here
[48:26] the devil did not take all away i think
[48:31] just because i was coming to talk a
[48:32] little about him he wasn't happy
[48:35] and he wanted to come in the way but by
[48:37] the grace of god
[48:39] we are going to see what god has for us
[48:41] tonight
[48:43] and i hope we are prayed up praise be to
[48:47] god
[48:48] now the prophet preached a message
[48:52] which we are all conversant with
[48:55] and he titled it the greatest battle
[48:58] ever fought
[49:01] now there are three scriptures here
[49:03] because of time
[49:04] i think i'll probably take only one
[49:09] and then the next two you can read them
[49:13] at your own time if you can please take
[49:16] your bibles
[49:17] and turn over to first peter 5
[49:23] first peter 5 8 to 10.
[49:41] first peter 5 8
[49:44] to 10 be sober
[49:49] be vigilant because your adversary the
[49:53] devil
[49:54] as a roaring lion what if about seeking
[49:57] whom he may devolve
[50:00] whom resist steadfastly
[50:03] in the faith knowing that the same
[50:06] afflictions are accomplished in your
[50:09] brethren
[50:10] that are in the world by the word
[50:14] of all grace by the god of all grace
[50:19] who have called us unto his eternal
[50:21] glory
[50:22] by christ jesus after that
[50:25] you have suffered a while make you
[50:28] perfect
[50:29] establish strengthen
[50:33] settle you praise be to god
[50:36] you can be seated
[50:40] next scriptures are ephesians 6 10
[50:43] to 17 daniel 12
[50:46] 1-14 you can write that down
[50:50] and then at your own time
[50:54] go through it praise be to god
[50:56] [Music]
[50:58] now what i want to say
[51:02] in starting this message
[51:06] is that we are not at the mercy
[51:10] of the devil
[51:14] it is the devil who is at our mercy
[51:18] the devil has no control over the
[51:22] life of any child of god
[51:26] amen
[51:29] we have been given authority over the
[51:32] devil
[51:34] and if we know who we are and we take
[51:36] our stand
[51:37] in god and we stay our course
[51:43] we can put the devil to flight every
[51:45] single moment
[51:47] we can cause the devil to put his tail
[51:50] in between his legs
[51:51] and you have no place to stand
[51:55] normally we allow fear to dominate our
[51:58] lives
[52:00] we allow fear to take over
[52:04] and the devil oppressed so much
[52:07] by fear so once fear comes in
[52:12] you lose control
[52:16] praise be to god the greatest
[52:20] battle ever fought now growing up
[52:25] we learned in our history lessons
[52:28] and we read about some of these battles
[52:32] the world war one that was fought
[52:36] within a period of four years
[52:40] 1914-1918
[52:43] and we also read about the second world
[52:45] war
[52:47] which lasted longer and
[52:50] tens of millions of people lost their
[52:53] lives
[52:56] all these battles put together
[53:00] were the bloodiest battle
[53:04] that man fought
[53:08] they lost count of how many people lost
[53:11] their lives in these battles
[53:14] so normally they would estimate it
[53:18] so you never get an accurate figure
[53:21] and all the two was put together close
[53:24] to 100 million people
[53:26] lost their lives in the battle soldiers
[53:29] civilians
[53:33] mothers children there was no count to
[53:37] it
[53:40] and you would look at it and say oh that
[53:42] was probably the greatest battle
[53:44] that was ever fought
[53:48] and then also you think about in the
[53:50] dark ages
[53:54] that tens of millions of christians that
[53:57] lost their lives
[53:59] what happened in the dark ages was a war
[54:01] against christianity
[54:05] and they lost count of how many people
[54:07] died
[54:09] record has it that close a hundred
[54:11] million people
[54:12] lost their lives we can talk about the
[54:16] holocaust
[54:18] 60 million people died
[54:22] and there are other ones we can talk
[54:23] about that we know happening around us
[54:26] here
[54:27] the american vietnam war in africa we
[54:29] have a lot
[54:30] i mean and you can tell
[54:35] that all these depending on how you look
[54:39] at it
[54:40] you can justify why maybe one or two of
[54:44] them
[54:44] could be the greatest battle that man
[54:47] ever fought
[54:50] they were very very bloody
[54:55] and then you come to think about it
[54:59] that the prophet of god comes on the
[55:02] scene
[55:04] and then he says the greatest battle
[55:06] that was ever fought
[55:10] was not any of these
[55:13] when you take any of these barrels
[55:16] they had a start time and they had an
[55:20] end time i don't care how long the
[55:23] battle lasted
[55:25] there was a time it started there was a
[55:27] time it ended
[55:31] but there was one battle that started
[55:34] in heaven and all through humanity
[55:39] all through the history of man the
[55:41] battle is still raging on
[55:44] amen and again when you want to look at
[55:47] the number of people who lost their
[55:48] lives
[55:49] and then you use that as the pointer to
[55:52] determine which was the bloodiest
[55:54] and which was the greatest barrier that
[55:56] was ever fought
[55:57] you are still going to get it wrong we
[56:00] can say
[56:01] that in the first and the second world
[56:03] war about a hundred million people died
[56:06] so that was bloody in the dark ages
[56:09] about a hundred million people died that
[56:11] was bloody
[56:15] in the holocaust 60 million people that
[56:17] was bloody
[56:18] but when you put all these wars together
[56:22] you realize that they don't come
[56:25] anywhere
[56:28] close
[56:30] because just imagine
[56:35] what people call death we know is sleep
[56:43] anything that has a physical the
[56:46] spiritual side
[56:47] is by far more superior than the
[56:50] physical side
[56:54] so when you look at people physically
[56:56] losing their lives
[57:00] and you compare that to people that are
[57:03] spiritually losing their lives
[57:05] on a daily basis in billions
[57:09] you realize that all the walls that man
[57:12] fought
[57:13] and all the loss of lives do not come
[57:16] anywhere close
[57:17] to the spiritual death that has plagued
[57:21] the earth
[57:24] the greatest barrel ever fought
[57:28] now the bible says that there was war in
[57:30] heaven
[57:33] between michael and his angels and
[57:36] lucifer
[57:36] and his angels
[57:40] why because lucifer wanted to pitch
[57:43] his throne above the throne of god
[57:48] and he was cast down he was defeated he
[57:51] was cast down
[57:52] there was no place left for him in
[57:54] heaven anymore
[57:58] now when the devil came he had an avowed
[58:01] ambition
[58:04] to turn the hearts
[58:08] of every child of god against god
[58:16] you don't know what you have
[58:23] we can see that in the life of job
[58:27] a man that god himself boasted about
[58:32] that the devil rose against him and what
[58:36] was the purpose
[58:37] of the devil to turn his heart
[58:41] against god so he could cast god
[58:44] praise the lord
[58:49] and the devil never stopped there
[58:52] so the devil has an about ambition
[58:57] so you realize that the world that was
[59:00] a war of angels has not become a wall of
[59:03] men
[59:04] amen the war that was fought
[59:07] by angels human beings are now fighting
[59:11] the battle
[59:12] it's one thing when you are in the ring
[59:14] with your opponent
[59:16] and you can see him physically
[59:20] and you are dishing the blouse and he is
[59:22] dishing the blows
[59:23] you know when you are getting him you
[59:25] know when he is weak
[59:27] you know when you are on top but it's
[59:30] another thing
[59:31] when you are fighting an opponent you
[59:33] don't see
[59:36] that is where we find ourselves
[59:39] that the enemy we are fighting we don't
[59:42] see him with his fiscal eyes
[59:44] but christ to god but by eyes of faith
[59:48] we know when he's around we know his
[59:51] moves
[59:53] praise be to god amen amen
[59:56] so we are fighting
[1:00:00] a wall that was once fought
[1:00:03] by angels now
[1:00:07] what is going on here
[1:00:13] there are two powers that are staked
[1:00:17] the power of god and the power of satan
[1:00:23] now brother brother said the satan's
[1:00:26] power
[1:00:28] is perverted it's a perverted power
[1:00:33] it's god who has the real power
[1:00:36] satan only takes what god has made
[1:00:39] and then he prevents it
[1:00:43] there is nothing he can create he is a
[1:00:45] perverter
[1:00:47] yes that is why when you see people
[1:00:53] that think they have it all in the world
[1:00:56] and they live a life and they say they
[1:00:58] are enjoying
[1:00:59] their joy they have it's a perverted joy
[1:01:01] yes
[1:01:03] that's right never crave
[1:01:08] for anything of this world
[1:01:11] as a matter of fact if there was no
[1:01:13] heaven
[1:01:15] it would still be better to live a good
[1:01:17] christian life and die and go ahead and
[1:01:19] go to hell
[1:01:20] if there was no heaven by
[1:01:24] all standards
[1:01:28] living a good christian life is very
[1:01:31] rewarding
[1:01:35] there is nothing out there
[1:01:38] i can tell you from my personal
[1:01:40] experience that there is
[1:01:42] nothing out there the devil will make
[1:01:44] things look so
[1:01:45] flashy so flamboyant so
[1:01:48] promising and you think that you are
[1:01:51] losing something
[1:01:52] in being in the economy of god when you
[1:01:54] leave the economy of god
[1:01:56] and you enter in there that is when you
[1:01:58] know that oh
[1:01:59] after all there was nothing there
[1:02:02] you never know what you have until you
[1:02:04] have lost it
[1:02:08] in northern ghana where i lived for
[1:02:10] probably i don't know how many years
[1:02:11] i have no time to check that one time
[1:02:17] i was going somewhere with my brother
[1:02:20] and there were two mad men
[1:02:23] here in america you don't see those
[1:02:25] things
[1:02:27] the mad men they give them medicines to
[1:02:29] calm them down
[1:02:30] so they don't get dangerous until they
[1:02:32] get the guns before people know that no
[1:02:34] these are dangerous human beings
[1:02:36] praise be to god but back where i come
[1:02:39] from
[1:02:40] you see them from a distance you know
[1:02:42] that oh no there is something wrong
[1:02:44] upstairs
[1:02:45] with this person and by the way they
[1:02:48] dress
[1:02:49] and as one was coming down the hill
[1:02:51] another one was climbing the hill
[1:02:55] that was a normal scene for us it was
[1:02:58] nothing new
[1:03:01] one was stuck naked the other the other
[1:03:05] one had clothes
[1:03:06] very tired dirty of course you don't
[1:03:09] expect it to be clean
[1:03:11] now as they came close and they were
[1:03:14] passing by each other
[1:03:18] what they they just for for whatever
[1:03:19] reason they just stand and they were
[1:03:21] looking at themselves
[1:03:24] and then the one that was clothed half
[1:03:26] clothes
[1:03:27] took his clothes off he wanted to be
[1:03:31] like the one that was naked not knowing
[1:03:34] that
[1:03:35] the naked one also admired him for
[1:03:37] wearing the clothes
[1:03:39] so when he took down the clothes and was
[1:03:42] going
[1:03:43] the one that was naked came and took the
[1:03:44] clothes and wore it
[1:03:47] and then he turned back and saw that no
[1:03:49] that guy looks better than him
[1:03:51] so now he went after his clothes two
[1:03:53] madman fighting who was going to
[1:03:55] separate them
[1:03:59] that was why we left we didn't know how
[1:04:00] it ended
[1:04:04] so you know what there are people around
[1:04:07] you
[1:04:08] who would look at your life and they
[1:04:11] envy your good christian life
[1:04:13] the life you are living and they wish
[1:04:16] they could live that type of life
[1:04:18] and they are not able and they will try
[1:04:20] to talk you
[1:04:22] into things and you will think that they
[1:04:26] are enjoying they are regretting
[1:04:29] if they are regretting where they are if
[1:04:31] they will be true and sincere
[1:04:33] they will tell you how they are
[1:04:34] suffering and if the grace of god does
[1:04:38] not help you
[1:04:39] you want to be like them as soon as you
[1:04:41] type your foot there
[1:04:43] then the devil opens your eyes and then
[1:04:46] you see what you have lost
[1:04:49] there is nothing worth trying in the
[1:04:51] world
[1:04:52] there is absolutely not wait there is
[1:04:56] nothing worth dying for in the world
[1:04:58] amen amen
[1:04:59] the world we are living in is dying is
[1:05:02] dying
[1:05:03] why would you want to live in a world
[1:05:05] like this it's corrupt
[1:05:08] there is nothing good that act for you
[1:05:10] absolutely not
[1:05:13] be happy who you are
[1:05:16] rejoice as a good christian brother as a
[1:05:19] good christian sister
[1:05:21] praise god for who you are it may look
[1:05:23] like this
[1:05:24] are not good it may look like you are
[1:05:26] suffering praise be to god
[1:05:28] look if we have to suffer for a while
[1:05:31] amen if we have to suffer for a while
[1:05:35] die poor and wretched in this life and
[1:05:38] have peace
[1:05:39] with god is the best a man can have
[1:05:44] there is nothing out there
[1:05:48] they may look flashy they may look
[1:05:50] attractive
[1:05:51] it's nothing but depth
[1:05:56] when a fisherman goes to fish he has a
[1:05:59] hook
[1:06:01] the hook is starting by death and then
[1:06:03] he puts a bait on the hook
[1:06:06] and most of the times
[1:06:10] the bait is far less expensive than the
[1:06:13] hook
[1:06:15] just to attract you to it and in the end
[1:06:19] it would cost you your life
[1:06:22] there are a lot of baits around
[1:06:26] praise be to god it looks like i'm
[1:06:29] getting away from my message
[1:06:32] i don't intend to finish it because i
[1:06:34] knew i was not going to finish
[1:06:38] praise be to god so i'm not going to
[1:06:41] finish anything
[1:06:42] and all the course i had i didn't find
[1:06:44] them anymore but praise be
[1:06:46] to god we are going to have service
[1:06:47] tonight
[1:06:51] the greatest battle ever fought so there
[1:06:54] are two powers that are at stake
[1:06:58] the one to whom you yield yourself
[1:07:02] dominates your life he works through you
[1:07:06] and he works with you
[1:07:12] the power of god and the power of satan
[1:07:18] now when the fall took place
[1:07:25] man lost his estate
[1:07:32] and from that time on this
[1:07:35] bath is condemned
[1:07:39] this bed that is why a man must be born
[1:07:43] again
[1:07:43] you must it's not when you feel like it
[1:07:47] you must be born again because this
[1:07:51] break
[1:07:51] is condemned
[1:07:56] the bible says in sin did my mother
[1:07:58] conceive me
[1:07:59] and in iniquity was i shaping
[1:08:04] come to the world telling lies you don't
[1:08:10] have to commit
[1:08:11] the first sin to be a sinner you come
[1:08:15] right into this world a sinner that is
[1:08:17] who you are at birth
[1:08:21] you can't help it you don't have to tell
[1:08:25] the first line
[1:08:32] i remember when i was a child my dad was
[1:08:35] a soldier
[1:08:37] and my mom was selling a petition that
[1:08:39] is screen juice
[1:08:41] but andrew knows what i'm talking about
[1:08:44] you guys wouldn't know it but you can
[1:08:46] vodka vodka is just the equivalent of
[1:08:48] what i'm talking about
[1:08:50] and i will see people come in they will
[1:08:53] just come
[1:08:54] and then pour some on the floor and then
[1:08:57] strike a match to it
[1:08:58] and it will catch fire they say oh this
[1:09:01] is good this is good
[1:09:03] and they will drink and they'll squeeze
[1:09:05] their face and they'll knock their
[1:09:06] chests
[1:09:07] and i was wondering what is going on one
[1:09:10] day my mother left
[1:09:11] i don't know where she went before she
[1:09:13] came back
[1:09:15] i just went for the bottle i don't know
[1:09:18] how much i drank
[1:09:19] i was lying on one side the bottle was
[1:09:21] lying on one side
[1:09:22] when my mother came in and said oh i
[1:09:24] have killed my son
[1:09:26] she thought i was dead that was the last
[1:09:28] time she ever sold drink
[1:09:32] praise be to god
[1:09:37] you don't teach those things you do them
[1:09:40] because
[1:09:41] that is who you are at best you couldn't
[1:09:43] help it
[1:09:46] and my father would send me to go and
[1:09:48] buy drink and when i
[1:09:50] buy the drink i would just lift it up
[1:09:52] and look at the level
[1:09:53] and i'll scale it down and i bring it
[1:09:55] the rest to him
[1:09:58] he was sharing the drink
[1:10:03] you don't teach a child how to steal
[1:10:08] i remember i would enter this kitchen
[1:10:10] and we still meet
[1:10:11] sometimes i'll be there and i hear
[1:10:12] somebody's walking in and i'll put that
[1:10:15] hot meat in my pocket
[1:10:16] and as they are coming in i'm jumping
[1:10:18] out
[1:10:22] you can't help those things
[1:10:25] that is who you are at best yes
[1:10:29] now it's amazing it's amazing
[1:10:34] that god by his wisdom
[1:10:38] deposited the gem of life in your soul
[1:10:44] man is a triangle as the prophet said
[1:10:47] in this message
[1:10:51] he changed the position of the spirit
[1:10:53] and the soul
[1:10:54] back in other messages he corrected it
[1:10:58] he came and he said the soul the soul is
[1:11:01] actually
[1:11:02] in the inner core the spirit and the
[1:11:04] flesh
[1:11:07] so that's i mean it's something i think
[1:11:09] we all know
[1:11:10] so i'm not going to go into that now
[1:11:16] the seed of life god puts that seed of
[1:11:20] life
[1:11:20] in your soul and that seed
[1:11:24] is lying there dormant
[1:11:27] there is life in that seed
[1:11:31] there is every season there are seasons
[1:11:34] in god
[1:11:36] in our work with god there are seasons
[1:11:39] and that seed is lying there waiting for
[1:11:42] its
[1:11:42] spiritual rain and sunshine
[1:11:46] there is life in it it's like when a
[1:11:49] farmer plants a seed
[1:11:50] in the soil there is life in the seed
[1:11:55] the seed is flying there is covered
[1:11:58] by the earth it is covered by darkness
[1:12:02] the earth has no control over it
[1:12:05] that darkness has no control over it
[1:12:09] as the seed is lying there is just
[1:12:11] waiting
[1:12:12] for rain and sunshine and as soon as the
[1:12:15] rain and sunshine comes
[1:12:16] and the right atmosphere is created it
[1:12:19] begins
[1:12:20] to germinate and once it starts
[1:12:24] germinating
[1:12:25] nothing stops it
[1:12:28] it will begin to grow it will flourish
[1:12:31] it will bear fruit
[1:12:33] and people will taste of it or eat of it
[1:12:37] that is the same
[1:12:40] with our work with god that the seed of
[1:12:44] life is there
[1:12:46] it doesn't matter what we do that seed
[1:12:50] can never be defiled
[1:12:54] it can never be defiled the devil will
[1:12:58] carry you the furthest he can
[1:13:00] but that representation of god in you
[1:13:02] would bring you back where you belong
[1:13:04] amen praise be to god
[1:13:08] so the devil comes in and what is he
[1:13:11] trying to do
[1:13:12] he just gets you to do things gets you
[1:13:16] to do things
[1:13:17] and you think it's an enjoyment you have
[1:13:20] get it to do things
[1:13:22] going to places you shouldn't go of
[1:13:24] course you don't even know that you're
[1:13:25] not supposed to go there
[1:13:27] you enjoy what you are doing the life
[1:13:30] you are living
[1:13:30] people look at you they regret what you
[1:13:33] are going through but you enjoy it
[1:13:36] why the devil
[1:13:40] has taken so much control in that life
[1:13:43] that is leading you the way into the
[1:13:46] things you are doing
[1:13:48] but that representation of god in you
[1:13:52] is never defined
[1:13:55] when the devil says lie down you don't
[1:13:58] ask why
[1:14:00] your question is for how long
[1:14:04] when the devil says jump you don't ask
[1:14:06] why your question is how high do you
[1:14:08] want me to jump
[1:14:10] when it says row no question
[1:14:13] how fast you want me to roll
[1:14:18] and the devil keeps telling us here and
[1:14:20] there telling us here and there
[1:14:24] but a child of god a child of god
[1:14:28] the devil can never mislead you for too
[1:14:30] long
[1:14:32] oh praise be to god amen i remember one
[1:14:35] time
[1:14:36] oh my goodness and my work with god has
[1:14:40] been a rough journey
[1:14:42] one time i went and i went and i went
[1:14:45] so so far could i could look back and
[1:14:49] never trace my steps
[1:14:53] and i could say to myself that i know
[1:14:56] it's done
[1:14:59] and i remember i am saying this to the
[1:15:01] glory of god
[1:15:02] i went to a fetish priest somewhere
[1:15:06] and as i sat down and i was in the open
[1:15:10] and he did something for me and i was
[1:15:12] just holding it
[1:15:14] oh i heard a voice
[1:15:17] not an audible voice like i'm speaking
[1:15:19] to you
[1:15:20] but i had a voice do you know you are a
[1:15:22] child of god
[1:15:23] and do you know you are not supposed to
[1:15:25] be doing this my goodness
[1:15:27] it broke every bone in me amen
[1:15:30] amen it broke every bone in me
[1:15:33] oh i have never forgotten it that thing
[1:15:37] comes
[1:15:37] over and over over and over
[1:15:42] the devil can never carry you further
[1:15:46] than god will redeem you
[1:15:50] why is he going to carry you that god
[1:15:52] will not come after you
[1:15:54] praise the lord so all the devil is
[1:15:57] doing
[1:15:58] is trying his best
[1:16:02] to make sure that you never get to the
[1:16:05] light of the world
[1:16:07] now all this while you don't know who
[1:16:09] you are
[1:16:10] you don't know why you belong all you
[1:16:13] know is that you are enjoying life
[1:16:15] but as a child of god when you hear the
[1:16:18] voice of god
[1:16:20] you hear the word of god preached
[1:16:22] something happens
[1:16:25] which is beyond explanation
[1:16:30] you can't explain it
[1:16:33] oh my you can't explain it
[1:16:37] i remember when i was in the church of
[1:16:40] pentecost
[1:16:41] i was not just satisfied i said to
[1:16:44] myself i was looking for something
[1:16:46] i didn't know what i was looking for if
[1:16:49] you ask me what are you looking for
[1:16:51] i will tell you i don't know but i knew
[1:16:53] i was looking for something
[1:16:55] that's right then one day i went out
[1:16:58] as usual doing my own things in the
[1:17:00] night
[1:17:02] and there was a crusade brother team was
[1:17:04] preaching
[1:17:06] and then when i got there they had
[1:17:08] finished preaching
[1:17:10] by then when a preacher man finishes in
[1:17:14] his
[1:17:14] rig capping that was where i got to
[1:17:18] and i heard what he was saying and i
[1:17:20] stopped right there i said this is what
[1:17:22] i'm looking for
[1:17:25] i had a muslim roommate he's in
[1:17:28] pennsylvania now
[1:17:29] i went back and i said mohammed i have
[1:17:31] been looking for something i have found
[1:17:33] it
[1:17:34] praise be to god when the word
[1:17:38] strikes when the deep calls there's a
[1:17:40] deep to answer
[1:17:42] you can't explain it but the word comes
[1:17:46] and then you check yourself the
[1:17:48] atmosphere changes
[1:17:50] that is why you can find 10 20 100
[1:17:53] people standing
[1:17:55] and then you have one person come out
[1:17:58] and the rest don't seem to understand
[1:18:00] what is going on
[1:18:02] it doesn't mean they are not child of
[1:18:04] they are not children of god maybe
[1:18:06] it is called yeah their season
[1:18:09] but when the season comes the devil
[1:18:11] cannot stop it
[1:18:13] and when the word strikes the word of
[1:18:16] god is light
[1:18:17] thy word is a lamp unto my feet the word
[1:18:20] is
[1:18:20] the word of god is light and jesus said
[1:18:23] this is not the condemnation
[1:18:25] that life has come but men still love
[1:18:28] darkness
[1:18:29] because they are this way evil the word
[1:18:31] of god is light
[1:18:32] so when the light strikes yes
[1:18:36] that life of darkness you've been living
[1:18:38] all your years
[1:18:41] something happens it's like lightening
[1:18:45] striking in the midst of darkness thank
[1:18:47] you jesus something happens
[1:18:51] and then you begin to check yourself
[1:18:56] the atmosphere changes
[1:19:01] and as you give yourself to the world
[1:19:04] and you begin to feed on the word
[1:19:08] the more things are happening
[1:19:11] but before then as the product of god
[1:19:14] said
[1:19:16] this physical man here has five senses
[1:19:19] the spiritual man has five senses but in
[1:19:22] the soul
[1:19:23] there is only one sense it's either
[1:19:25] doubt or
[1:19:26] faith and
[1:19:29] faith coming by hearing and hearing by
[1:19:32] the word of god
[1:19:34] so all your life all your life
[1:19:38] until you started hearing the word you
[1:19:41] were living in the midst of darkness
[1:19:43] doing the taste of darkness there was no
[1:19:47] faith
[1:19:49] there was no faith
[1:19:52] you were living in doubt in unbelief
[1:19:58] but when the world comes and you embrace
[1:20:00] the way amen
[1:20:03] now and you keep giving yourself to the
[1:20:07] world
[1:20:08] faith begins to grow yes
[1:20:12] faith begins to grow amen your faith
[1:20:14] begins to grow
[1:20:16] and as your faith is growing doubt is on
[1:20:19] its way out
[1:20:21] now light and darkness there can never
[1:20:24] be any form of
[1:20:27] association between light and darkness
[1:20:31] why there is darkness there is darkness
[1:20:32] because there is no light
[1:20:36] but when light comes darkness must leave
[1:20:39] so when the light of the world comes
[1:20:41] into your life
[1:20:42] ductless must find its way out so
[1:20:46] said that the fight starts in the soul
[1:20:52] it starts in the soul in the soul
[1:20:54] because
[1:20:55] at birth the devil has taken a hold
[1:21:00] that you are full of darkness
[1:21:03] the devil is inside there but don't
[1:21:06] forget
[1:21:07] that seed of god is planted in there
[1:21:14] so when the world first strikes
[1:21:18] now there is a fight right there
[1:21:22] between god and satan between what is
[1:21:26] right and what is wrong
[1:21:27] between light and darkness between just
[1:21:30] and unjust
[1:21:34] but as we all know satan is no match for
[1:21:36] god
[1:21:39] amen and if you are child of god
[1:21:42] filled with the holy ghost satan is so
[1:21:44] much for you
[1:21:47] yes we can't fear god
[1:21:51] and fear satan
[1:21:55] satan is no match for any child of god
[1:21:59] thank you jesus he belongs under our
[1:22:01] feet yes
[1:22:04] praise him he is a coward yes
[1:22:08] thank you jesus we belong to god we are
[1:22:10] children of god
[1:22:12] we have been given authority over satan
[1:22:14] and over his works
[1:22:17] if you live in sin it's just your choice
[1:22:22] that's right if you are doing things you
[1:22:24] shouldn't do it's just your choice
[1:22:26] yes
[1:22:30] sometimes we do it and we blame it on
[1:22:32] the devil
[1:22:34] the devil can go only go so far as we
[1:22:37] are we'll be looking at it here
[1:22:40] praise be to god amen
[1:22:44] i don't know why my voice is changing
[1:22:45] very fast
[1:22:50] satan is a liar
[1:22:53] so
[1:22:58] god bless you brother one that was
[1:23:01] exactly what i was looking for
[1:23:04] amen
[1:23:14] praise be to god amen
[1:23:17] so when the devil is cast out
[1:23:23] he doesn't go
[1:23:26] he doesn't go remember
[1:23:31] just so long as we are in this body
[1:23:35] the devil has a claim
[1:23:39] on you because this flesh
[1:23:44] this flesh is irredeemable it can never
[1:23:46] be redeemed
[1:23:49] it was taken from this earth and satan
[1:23:52] is the god of this earth
[1:23:54] and he can always appeal to the flesh
[1:23:59] and that is where the battle starts
[1:24:03] he has no control over your life
[1:24:07] and when he is cast out he doesn't go
[1:24:13] he comes back
[1:24:16] now when the word first comes to you
[1:24:20] and you feel god dealing with your heart
[1:24:23] it's a very very difficult moment
[1:24:27] sometimes people print a picture and let
[1:24:30] you think
[1:24:30] that it's very very easy no it's a very
[1:24:33] difficult journey with god
[1:24:38] because this is the time that the devil
[1:24:40] is going to tell you
[1:24:42] you are not wet being a christian
[1:24:46] look at the life you have lived you
[1:24:48] lived a very wretched life
[1:24:51] you live a very shameful life you lived
[1:24:54] a very disgraceful life
[1:24:56] you are good for nothing you are bad
[1:24:58] news
[1:25:00] that's right tell the devil yes
[1:25:03] point the devil to the blood
[1:25:06] point the devil to the blood amen amen
[1:25:10] praise be to god amen thank you now god
[1:25:13] became a man
[1:25:14] for our sake he died to redeem you and
[1:25:17] me
[1:25:20] the bible says we are bought and paid
[1:25:22] for
[1:25:24] by his blood amen
[1:25:31] and the devil just sits around
[1:25:36] and waits for the light to go deep
[1:25:39] then he concussion on you thank you that
[1:25:42] is why
[1:25:44] when you get into the economy of god you
[1:25:47] have to mean business with god
[1:25:49] it is no longer there is no plan it's
[1:25:51] not time to play church
[1:25:56] the devil knows that his time is at hand
[1:26:00] he knows it more than we know that our
[1:26:04] home going is near
[1:26:07] and he is working over time
[1:26:14] the devil is working over time
[1:26:18] just to make sure that you don't get to
[1:26:21] where you should go you should be
[1:26:25] this is the time we should see god and
[1:26:28] see god endlessly
[1:26:31] to make sure that we've gotten a hold of
[1:26:34] god
[1:26:37] to make sure
[1:26:40] that every question about our salvation
[1:26:42] is settled
[1:26:49] the devil can never concede god when god
[1:26:52] has taken over
[1:26:57] deathless can never come into your life
[1:26:59] and overthrow light
[1:27:02] but what the devil does is that
[1:27:05] he begins to pump things
[1:27:09] into your mind
[1:27:13] and the greatest battle that was ever
[1:27:15] fought is in the mind here
[1:27:21] that god and satan meet right in here
[1:27:26] and satan will tell you things
[1:27:31] and once the mind accepts it
[1:27:35] it passes it down to the soul
[1:27:41] the devil can never unseat god
[1:27:44] but the devil will try to get you to
[1:27:46] lose confidence
[1:27:47] in the word of god and when you
[1:27:51] lose confidence in the word of god you
[1:27:53] are disarmed
[1:27:55] and once you are disarmed the devil
[1:27:58] finds his way back
[1:28:01] and your end will be worse than the
[1:28:03] beginning
[1:28:10] when the brother said one of the quotes
[1:28:13] i don't have it here
[1:28:15] that was what the devil stole but we put
[1:28:18] it together anyhow
[1:28:21] that the devil is almost powerless
[1:28:25] until he can find somebody to use
[1:28:32] so he always needs a vessel
[1:28:38] and god also needs a vessel
[1:28:42] god is a man to work with and satan
[1:28:45] needs a man to work with
[1:28:51] so the devil comes
[1:28:54] and then he can pollute your mind
[1:28:59] sometimes you see a brother you see a
[1:29:01] sister
[1:29:04] just living a very good life it looks
[1:29:06] like everything is fine
[1:29:08] until you get into their lives you don't
[1:29:10] know what you're going through
[1:29:13] we are all fighting a battle of one kind
[1:29:16] or the other
[1:29:19] sometimes all through the night
[1:29:23] you are awake going through battles
[1:29:27] mind battles the devil is just
[1:29:31] pumping you here and there all he is
[1:29:34] doing
[1:29:35] is trying to get to the inner monday
[1:29:39] trying to get you to lose confidence in
[1:29:41] the word of god
[1:29:44] that's right that the word of god says
[1:29:45] by my side you are healed
[1:29:48] and you go to the hospital with the
[1:29:50] condition
[1:29:52] and the doctor tells you this
[1:29:56] science has no solution to this problem
[1:30:00] we have given you six months to live
[1:30:03] there is nothing we can do about this
[1:30:10] what do you do you have the word of god
[1:30:14] that says by myself you are healed
[1:30:18] do you listen to god are you listening
[1:30:20] to satan
[1:30:28] the devil can come and tell you that
[1:30:30] everybody in the church hates you
[1:30:34] and sometimes their eyes
[1:30:37] see things that don't even exist
[1:30:44] that somebody will pass and they are
[1:30:46] looking on the left
[1:30:47] you are on the right and it's like they
[1:30:49] looked at you
[1:30:50] and then they sized you up and it's okay
[1:30:53] did i not tell you
[1:30:56] sometimes we look for things that are
[1:30:58] not even existing
[1:31:01] and if you are looking for things that
[1:31:02] don't exist you will find them
[1:31:08] the eyes don't just see things that are
[1:31:10] around
[1:31:12] it is the mind that tells the eyes what
[1:31:15] to look at
[1:31:18] i go to the room most of the times
[1:31:20] looking for something
[1:31:22] and my mind is telling me to somewhere
[1:31:24] and i'm looking at a 10 right sitting in
[1:31:26] front of me
[1:31:29] and i'm looking for it everywhere
[1:31:37] we go through a lot of mind battles
[1:31:41] yes and sometimes the people that are
[1:31:44] bearing you up
[1:31:45] that are keeping you up there are your
[1:31:48] supports spiritually and are bearing you
[1:31:52] up by day and by night
[1:31:54] they are the people that the devil with
[1:31:56] his ex
[1:31:57] inside you against because the devil
[1:32:00] knows
[1:32:01] what you are doing and the devil knows
[1:32:05] that if they could get them out of the
[1:32:07] way they could get to you
[1:32:15] we go through a lot of mind battles
[1:32:18] and that is where the greatest battle is
[1:32:21] fought
[1:32:23] once you accept it
[1:32:26] once the mind accepts it it sends it
[1:32:29] down to the soul
[1:32:31] then the soul would accept it that is
[1:32:34] why the prophet of god said
[1:32:36] that name when the thought comes and it
[1:32:40] does not line up with the word of god
[1:32:42] just blow it off
[1:32:45] do not entertain it
[1:32:49] a lot of the times we entertain it
[1:32:53] and we feed on it and we we just
[1:32:56] baby it we keep it like a treasure
[1:33:00] and it grows and before we away
[1:33:04] we are beginning to deal with things we
[1:33:07] don't have to deal with yes
[1:33:11] when it comes blow it off
[1:33:15] when it comes blow it off
[1:33:19] the devil just comes to reasoning like
[1:33:22] it happened to him if
[1:33:27] eve knew what to do and what not to do
[1:33:32] but she stopped for a moment
[1:33:36] just for a moment to listen
[1:33:39] and the devil just passed that thought
[1:33:42] to her
[1:33:44] she did not reject it she entertained it
[1:33:50] she started to reason with the word of
[1:33:52] god
[1:33:54] and that brought about the fall and that
[1:33:57] has created
[1:33:58] all the problems that man has to go
[1:34:01] through in this life that's right
[1:34:03] all the wars all the hatred
[1:34:07] all the malice
[1:34:10] all the fights all the bloodshed
[1:34:14] just because she stopped for a moment to
[1:34:17] listen
[1:34:22] do not reason with the word
[1:34:26] we are not called to understand we are
[1:34:29] not called to reason
[1:34:31] that is how we don't save god based on
[1:34:33] our feelings
[1:34:35] it's by faith
[1:34:39] because the devil
[1:34:42] can penetrate the devil uses the five
[1:34:47] senses
[1:34:48] of the soul of the spirit
[1:34:51] to get to you
[1:34:56] praise be to god
[1:35:00] the greatest ever as i said i never
[1:35:02] intended to finish this
[1:35:04] because part of my notes are gone
[1:35:08] and what i have here i believe by the
[1:35:11] grace of god
[1:35:14] somehow what is going to touch i mean
[1:35:17] speak twice in one way or the other
[1:35:27] so in closing
[1:35:33] we need to guard against our mind
[1:35:37] the mind is very very very strong
[1:35:50] a mass heart can stop beating
[1:35:55] if the brain does not stop working
[1:35:58] they don't pronounce him dead they will
[1:36:01] tell you he's in coma
[1:36:05] because the brain is still working
[1:36:10] and the prayer of god said the mind
[1:36:13] is the door to the soul
[1:36:18] so you can choose to open it or close it
[1:36:24] and you should be worried what you are
[1:36:26] opening your mind to
[1:36:33] be careful the thoughts you entertain
[1:36:43] because they can ruin your life
[1:36:47] if anything comes into your mind there
[1:36:50] are things you can never stop
[1:36:52] from coming into your mind
[1:36:55] but you don't have to entertain them
[1:36:58] they don't have to come and stay
[1:37:00] a lot of the times we provide shelter
[1:37:03] for the enemy to come and sit down and
[1:37:06] have fellowship with us
[1:37:10] know that you are a child of god
[1:37:13] you belong to the economy of god
[1:37:16] that we have an adversary that we are
[1:37:18] fighting
[1:37:21] the devil is seeking to destroy you
[1:37:27] and this battle
[1:37:31] is never ended until we are out of this
[1:37:34] life
[1:37:35] yes for every day we live
[1:37:38] we are fighting a battle
[1:37:42] whether at home whether in your marriage
[1:37:44] whether at school
[1:37:45] whether at a mall whether at work
[1:37:48] wherever you are
[1:37:49] you are fighting a battle
[1:37:57] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:38:00] speaking
[1:38:03] you never know what is in the mind
[1:38:07] until it is let out of the mouth
[1:38:13] the greatest battle ever fought is in
[1:38:15] the mind
[1:38:20] i go through it
[1:38:25] and i believe some of us if not all of
[1:38:26] us go through it
[1:38:33] the devil will try to lift your past
[1:38:38] bring it before you what is he trying to
[1:38:40] do
[1:38:41] let you lose confidence
[1:38:46] and things that don't exist the devil
[1:38:49] will try to put them in your mind
[1:38:53] praise be to god and i want us to know
[1:38:56] tonight
[1:38:59] that every step we take in this life god
[1:39:01] is interested in that step
[1:39:02] yes that the steps of the righteous are
[1:39:05] ordered
[1:39:06] of the lord that nothing
[1:39:09] can go wrong some of the things that we
[1:39:13] see go wrong
[1:39:14] they are for our own good god permits
[1:39:17] them
[1:39:19] it's not that the devil is having its
[1:39:22] way no
[1:39:24] the devil can never have his way with
[1:39:26] any child of god
[1:39:27] but sometimes god would allow things to
[1:39:29] happen
[1:39:31] and it is for our own good it is not
[1:39:35] a time that we want
[1:39:38] trials and temptations are very
[1:39:40] difficult moments for any believer
[1:39:43] but god allows those things
[1:39:47] for a good reason
[1:39:51] when a plant grows
[1:39:56] the root takes a hold of the soil
[1:40:08] once it was buried in there
[1:40:11] once darkness overshadowed it
[1:40:15] but once it grows and it becomes a tree
[1:40:19] it takes a hold of that soil
[1:40:25] the flesh and the desires of the flesh
[1:40:28] has no control over your life
[1:40:35] they should be subject to you
[1:40:38] we are not subject to it
[1:40:43] praise be to god thank you jesus
[1:40:48] i think this is a very good place to end
[1:40:52] and god bless you
[1:40:59] for bearing with me tonight
[1:41:10] and i trust and believe that somehow
[1:41:15] god has spoken to you
[1:41:19] because the bible says his word will not
[1:41:21] go out and come back void
[1:41:23] but whenever his word goes out it would
[1:41:26] accomplish
[1:41:27] the purpose for which is being sent out
[1:41:32] i believe that the word of god tonight
[1:41:37] did not come in vain
[1:41:41] praise be to god thank you jesus
[1:41:44] i want us to go to the lord in prayer
[1:41:49] just talk to god whichever way god may
[1:41:52] have spoken to you
[1:41:54] i have no way of knowing it but the word
[1:41:57] of god has come to us
[1:42:00] in one way or the other we are all
[1:42:02] fighting battles
[1:42:04] and a lot of the times we leave our
[1:42:07] god-given positions
[1:42:09] and once you leave your god-given
[1:42:10] position you have given the enemy
[1:42:13] a weapon against you we are going to
[1:42:16] pray tonight and ask god to help us
[1:42:19] to keep to keep our position
[1:42:22] in christ to stay our grounds
[1:42:26] because if we should all stay our
[1:42:28] grounds
[1:42:29] if we should all keep our position in
[1:42:31] christ
[1:42:32] the devil has no place in our midst
[1:42:37] it's not to say the lord is not going to
[1:42:38] fight the devil is going to fight
[1:42:41] but the devil has no place in our midst
[1:42:43] praise be to god
[1:42:44] yes shall we go to god and pray
[1:42:47] tonight our lord and our savior jesus
[1:42:55] we thank you so much oh god for your
[1:42:58] word that has come to us tonight
[1:43:01] we are so very much grateful
[1:43:05] for the pieces of words father oh god
[1:43:07] that have been spoken from behind the
[1:43:09] pulpit tonight
[1:43:12] they may not mean anything further
[1:43:16] but it's my prayer dear lord jesus
[1:43:19] that you will unite them in the house of
[1:43:21] your sons and daughters tonight
[1:43:24] and let them mean something lord
[1:43:27] let them mean something in our lives oh
[1:43:29] god
[1:43:31] for we did not come to hear a man speak
[1:43:34] we came that you may speak to us
[1:43:36] oh god and your word has come lord
[1:43:40] and the bible says your word would not
[1:43:42] go out and come back void
[1:43:44] the purpose of which your word came out
[1:43:46] tonight we pray the father tonight
[1:43:49] and we beseech you in the name of jesus
[1:43:51] let it be accomplished in our lives oh
[1:43:53] god
[1:43:54] and let our lives blossom
[1:43:58] let our lives bear fruits lord where do
[1:44:01] you have repentance lord
[1:44:03] and let us live the life knowing that
[1:44:06] our homegoing time
[1:44:07] is nearer than it has ever been
[1:44:11] we know that the devil is fighting to
[1:44:12] finish
[1:44:14] to get us down but we know oh god
[1:44:18] that heaven is behind us and we are
[1:44:20] never going to lose this battle
[1:44:23] we commit ourselves into your hands oh
[1:44:25] god
[1:44:26] we yield ourselves father we surrender
[1:44:30] all that we are into your hands oh god
[1:44:33] and we pray dear lord jesus come and
[1:44:35] take
[1:44:36] absolute control over our lives yes
[1:44:39] speak through us oh god touch every
[1:44:41] heart lord
[1:44:43] quicken your weight further into our
[1:44:44] souls tonight

[1:44:48] with us
[1:44:49] and open our minds
[1:44:53] open our eyes to see take the skills of
[1:44:57] our eyes oh god may you touch us in a
[1:45:00] very special way oh god
[1:45:04] as many as i've got it father oh god and
[1:45:07] as many as father have joined the
[1:45:08] service online

[1:45:16] lives

[1:45:40] it and what you have undone
[1:45:43] the enemy can never do it we know that
[1:45:47] our lives are safe

[1:46:16] hey thank you
[1:46:19] hey
[1:46:24] brother one don't know
[1:46:50] tonight we know we are in uh
[1:46:54] in the greatest battle ever thought you
[1:46:56] know when
[1:46:57] uh i was reading something
[1:47:00] uh the other the other day there in our
[1:47:03] devotion
[1:47:04] and brother branham was testifying of
[1:47:06] the devil speaking to his mind that
[1:47:08] this man jesus could have just been an
[1:47:12] ordinary man and people just talk about
[1:47:15] him and just make him
[1:47:17] and he just went about talking about you
[1:47:19] know how
[1:47:20] satan was just trying to make jesus like
[1:47:23] an ordinary man he was
[1:47:24] you were just like an ordinary man like
[1:47:26] any man that one slave
[1:47:28] and what was going on was the greatest
[1:47:30] battle in his mind and just like our
[1:47:33] brother said
[1:47:34] you know brother branham said is to be
[1:47:36] able to bring us to that place where we
[1:47:37] can lose
[1:47:38] confidence in the world praise the lord
[1:47:41] amen so we just want to thank the lord
[1:47:43] we want to thank the lord for uh
[1:47:46] that encouragement tonight for reminding
[1:47:49] us
[1:47:50] you know that we have to guide our mind
[1:47:52] we have to guide our hearts
[1:47:54] you know as i encourage us to do that
[1:47:58] to be able to guide our hearts and the
[1:47:59] way to do it
[1:48:01] is to guide our heart by the word of the
[1:48:02] lord amen
[1:48:04] let's meditate upon the word praise the
[1:48:06] lord
[1:48:07] you know what brother branham says
[1:48:08] christian life is a life that is easily
[1:48:11] to be misunderstood
[1:48:13] praise the lord why because we are
[1:48:15] living we are living a dual life we have
[1:48:17] a spirit man
[1:48:18] and we have a physical body and
[1:48:21] something but dan said that was
[1:48:23] that that i've just wrote on he talked
[1:48:25] about
[1:48:26] satan's claim you know satan has a claim
[1:48:29] and he says certain claim is it's upon
[1:48:32] this flesh
[1:48:33] and the flesh is not redeemed just think
[1:48:35] about it satan has a claim that is not
[1:48:37] redeemable
[1:48:38] you know and that's as far as he can go
[1:48:42] because his claim is not redeemable but
[1:48:45] we have a kingsman redeemer
[1:48:47] you know whose claim is redeemable
[1:48:50] praise the lord
[1:48:51] so we want to thank god for all of that
[1:48:54] let's just
[1:48:55] stand to our feet tonight and praise the
[1:48:57] lord and uh
[1:49:00] let's turn to our feet tonight let's
[1:49:02] just find a song we can sing
[1:49:05] and just thank god you know he's the
[1:49:07] captain of our salvation
[1:49:09] he's the one that is fighting the
[1:49:11] battles and we
[1:49:13] are claiming the victory praise the lord
[1:49:15] that's the reason why
[1:49:17] we are more than conquerors because he's
[1:49:19] the one that is fighting the battles
[1:49:21] praise the lord amen amen
[1:49:25] if the enemy brings things upon our mind
[1:49:28] let's be able to take it back to the
[1:49:30] word of the lord
