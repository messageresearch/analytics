[7:41] read for the opening of

[7:50] get kind of comfortable with the fact
[7:51] that we're going to be here for a long
[7:52] time

[33:20] [Music]
[33:38] that was really precious
[33:40] and the timing couldn't be better
[33:42] because they have a testimony my plane
[33:45] and everything you know our we're a
[33:47] supernatural people I tell you
[33:49] even if we things aren't going the way
[33:52] we think they should go God's Got A Plan
[33:56] and this might be it's going to be
[33:58] really hard for me to tell you
[33:59] but
[34:01] my flight because I saw a God and it's
[34:04] so bad I love kids so much
[34:07] um my uh
[34:09] well it wasn't delayed it was actually
[34:11] canceled I was standing and waiting at
[34:14] the airport and we were supposed to
[34:16] board in a half an hour and the flight
[34:18] was totally canceled just disappeared
[34:21] out of nowhere and my bags were packed
[34:23] and they were sent in the baggage and
[34:25] one ended up in Baltimore and the other
[34:27] one stayed in Nashville and they didn't
[34:29] tell me
[34:30] anyway so just I finally got the bags
[34:33] back but anyway
[34:34] so we we had to wait to get a flight and
[34:38] all you up here I was in I was with you
[34:40] in spirit even though I wasn't in the
[34:42] cold with you I'm sorry but we did have
[34:44] some cold in Tennessee it was actually
[34:46] below zero in Tennessee no kidding for
[34:49] two days only though but um anyway
[34:53] as it turned out
[34:54] um I got a flight coming back on Sunday
[34:58] um this last Sunday
[35:00] and got in the plane and there was a
[35:04] little girl sitting by herself
[35:09] and so I
[35:12] so I drove with her and she was
[35:14] traveling alone she comes from a broken
[35:16] home
[35:17] I mean I'm gonna cut a cup short so I
[35:19] don't cry but anyway I couldn't get her
[35:22] name because of the the airline had to
[35:26] protect her and she wasn't supposed to
[35:28] tell any of her information but I just
[35:31] knew it was a god-appointed meeting and
[35:34] the gods stopped my plane the week
[35:36] before
[35:38] because that little girl she told me
[35:40] she's nine years old
[35:43] and she told me she said I just left my
[35:46] grandma in in Nashville and now I have
[35:49] to go back to the cities and it's a
[35:51] broken home thing and she would have
[35:53] been turning toward the window crying
[35:57] and she said I'm so glad that you sat
[35:59] with me
[36:02] and she said we used to go to church
[36:06] she said um
[36:09] she said when I can't sleep at night she
[36:12] said I pray she says Heavenly Father
[36:15] please help me go to sleep
[36:20] never you know I mean our our lives are
[36:23] in his hands and you know our steps are
[36:26] ordered of the Lord and we're
[36:28] Supernatural people we don't realize
[36:30] what we're doing when we're just going
[36:31] about our regular stuff
[36:34] but I gave her my information but I told
[36:37] her I said no I know I will see you in
[36:41] Heaven someday
[36:42] she's got a part of God in her heart
[36:45] she's had people sit next to her in the
[36:47] plane
[36:48] that have showed her adult content
[36:50] videos isn't that horrible and she she's
[36:53] so mature she said

[36:58] stop and think they're showing this to a
[37:01] child she's nine she's more mature than

[37:10] name and God knows what it is but just
[37:12] pray for her
[37:15] um that the seeds of love that I shared
[37:17] with her I was telling her stuff before

[37:21] 12. she's tall but she um I was telling
[37:25] her stuff that happened to me when I was
[37:26] nine
[37:27] and I didn't even know
[37:30] I just experiences with the Lord that I
[37:32] had when I was nine so anyway I
[37:34] appreciate that and uh so much more
[37:36] could be told but I'm gonna cut it short

[58:04] the story last week and uh
[58:10] praise the Lord
[58:15] then let's let's drop down to uh verse
[58:19] 25.
[58:22] let's drop down to verse 25
[58:28] praise the Lord
[58:40] let's read from verse 24 it will give us
[58:42] a good background year and it came to
[58:44] pass about three months
[58:47] three months
[58:49] after that it was told Judah saying tema
[58:54] thy daughter-in-law have played the
[58:57] Harlot
[58:59] and also behold
[59:02] she is
[59:05] with child of wodom
[59:09] and Judah said bring her forth and let
[59:13] her be burned
[59:14] no flesh will be justified by the Lord
[59:19] that's what the law will do to our flesh
[59:22] the Lords the Commandment whichever way
[59:24] we term it no flesh will be justified if
[59:27] we did near High Grace
[59:29] none of us will be here this morning
[59:32] praise the Lord I had the brother
[59:33] opening the service this morning and
[59:35] said we condemn our hearts before they
[59:37] and then I said in the office I said
[59:39] Lord but we thank you for your grace
[59:42] amen
[59:44] amen
[59:46] that's that's exactly what happened
[59:48] we condemn our hearts all the time
[59:51] before the Lord it is only Grace that
[59:53] gave us face for us to live our faces up
[59:56] amen praise the Lord
[59:59] and uh verse 25 when she was brought
[1:00:03] forth she sent to her father-in-law
[1:00:07] saying by the man
[1:00:09] whose these are I am with child
[1:00:14] and she said discern
[1:00:19] discern
[1:00:21] go beyond the Lord go beyond go beyond
[1:00:25] being legalistic
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:30] go beyond discern that's when wisdom is
[1:00:33] needed pause for the Y she said pause
[1:00:36] for the wine
[1:00:37] open your eyes look at these things
[1:00:42] praise the Lord
[1:00:43] amen there that was the same thing Jesus
[1:00:48] did with those people that took up the
[1:00:51] stone to Stone that woman he he said if
[1:00:55] there's one among you without a sin you
[1:00:58] know that word he discerned their heart
[1:01:02] praise the Lord
[1:01:04] and uh
[1:01:06] and he says woman neither do I condemn
[1:01:10] thee
[1:01:12] in another sense you are right trust in
[1:01:14] I I don't want to go in there let me
[1:01:16] just rewrite here praise the Lord I
[1:01:19] don't want to get ahead of myself this
[1:01:20] morning
[1:01:23] about a man who decide I'm with chai she
[1:01:26] said discern I pray thee who's are these
[1:01:30] the sing they're the bracelets and the
[1:01:32] staff
[1:01:33] and Judah acknowledged him
[1:01:36] he acknowledged him
[1:01:39] praise the Lord
[1:01:42] if he was a cold winter morning he was
[1:01:44] sweating
[1:01:47] he acknowledged him he dropped his heart
[1:01:53] that's what truth we do truth will
[1:01:55] humble you
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:01:58] truth will drop your heart
[1:02:00] and uh
[1:02:02] and have your mouth hanging
[1:02:06] and Judah acknowledged him and said she
[1:02:10] has been more righteous than I
[1:02:13] because I gave her net
[1:02:18] to Sheila my son
[1:02:20] and he knew her again no more now before
[1:02:25] we said
[1:02:26] there there is there is something that
[1:02:28] is playing out here
[1:02:30] amen if you go to the to the to the

[1:04:09] now now is there anyone with uh a coffee
[1:04:13] Bible
[1:04:15] is there any in his coffee Bible says
[1:04:18] Alice yeah you get a coffee Bible there
[1:04:20] did you just coffee Bible on the top of
[1:04:23] itself parentheses good okay
[1:04:27] now I make mention of that uh last week
[1:04:31] it's coffee uh he uh he was a scholar he
[1:04:35] you know he was a man that uh the law
[1:04:38] blessing uh and and his his Bible is one
[1:04:43] of the known Study Bible you know it's
[1:04:46] coffee Bible Thompson Chain and all that
[1:04:49] uh
[1:04:51] so uh
[1:04:53] it's a Bible that uh you know the
[1:04:55] program or love for Faith even though a
[1:04:58] places he says There Are Places I don't
[1:04:59] agree with coffee but there are other
[1:05:00] places he commented him
[1:05:03] and so
[1:05:06] there are places in uh in uh
[1:05:09] in this coffee Bible where he uh he term
[1:05:13] out as a parentences
[1:05:15] and what I believe was happening is that
[1:05:19] as a scholar as he was studying he
[1:05:22] realized that
[1:05:24] something is introduced
[1:05:27] because when you read that story right
[1:05:29] there you see uh the Bible talking about
[1:05:33] about Joseph
[1:05:36] is talking about Joseph
[1:05:39] amen
[1:05:40] is talking about Joseph the Bible just
[1:05:44] came out of
[1:05:46] Joseph
[1:05:48] being being put into the well
[1:05:54] a type of death burial and Resurrection
[1:06:00] a type of cavalry
[1:06:03] praise the Lord
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:06] is talking about Joseph he he's he's
[1:06:09] born with this gift of Dreams he's
[1:06:11] dreaming his brothers uh you know and
[1:06:13] are happy with him and all of these
[1:06:15] things are going on in his life
[1:06:17] but right here
[1:06:19] the Bible just came and introduced this
[1:06:22] story
[1:06:24] you know what is the significance what
[1:06:27] what what relationship it has and then
[1:06:30] after chapter 38 it picks up with Joseph
[1:06:33] again
[1:06:37] praise the Lord
[1:06:40] and even when you look at the story you
[1:06:43] look at the story
[1:06:45] in the human mind you know one time I
[1:06:48] was I was talking with uh with with with
[1:06:50] with a Muslim guy and then he was he was
[1:06:55] uh
[1:06:56] he was he was trying to talk about uh
[1:06:59] you know how how indecent the Bible is
[1:07:03] you know he his argument was I mean how
[1:07:06] can the Bible put a a story about lost
[1:07:10] sleeping with his daughters I told him I
[1:07:12] says it does not matter if it's the
[1:07:14] truth
[1:07:17] right if it is the truth it does not
[1:07:19] matter
[1:07:21] praise the Lord amen amen the thing
[1:07:24] about us human is there we always like
[1:07:27] to talk about the nice thing of
[1:07:29] ourselves
[1:07:31] we never come up in the public and say
[1:07:33] you know I used to be a rogue
[1:07:35] I used to be this you know because we
[1:07:38] always want for people to perceive her
[1:07:40] but you see this proved that this is the
[1:07:42] word of God
[1:07:43] because everything that happened in this
[1:07:45] Bible is truth it's not makeup
[1:07:49] if it was makeup those men would choose
[1:07:52] the best story
[1:07:53] they're stored about uh uh uh uh Genesis
[1:07:56] 38 it's not a decent story
[1:08:01] this is a father-in-law sleeping where
[1:08:03] his daughter-in-law is not a decent
[1:08:04] story but it's the truth
[1:08:07] it happens
[1:08:14] are we together
[1:08:19] but then when Glory called it
[1:08:22] implicit in the Bible
[1:08:25] he place it there for a reason
[1:08:30] in his great wisdom
[1:08:33] he placed there there for a reason
[1:08:39] man I was looking at some few things
[1:08:40] this is something that I kind of look
[1:08:42] look into long time ago but just for
[1:08:47] to be able to help you I I thought that
[1:08:49] I'll go back into it and and uh and and
[1:08:52] and help you again because for many for
[1:08:55] many years uh many years back I mean
[1:08:58] just just like just as a boy preacher
[1:09:00] I'm still a boy but when I was Marshall
[1:09:03] boy
[1:09:05] I praise the Lord
[1:09:06] that caught my attention they had caught
[1:09:09] my attention and then I started I
[1:09:12] remember there was uh either back 1998
[1:09:16] when I got my first coffee Bible Lonnie
[1:09:18] Jenkins sent it for me and he was my
[1:09:21] good friend
[1:09:22] and uh uh I stayed I stick I kept the
[1:09:25] letter until until uh you know somewhere
[1:09:30] I lost it Susan Brooks was the one that
[1:09:33] bought the Bible his uh his secretary
[1:09:35] Secretary of the church there in in uh
[1:09:38] and then they mailed it to me
[1:09:41] and I was so excited I was I went
[1:09:44] through the Bible I I had it I had it on
[1:09:48] my table this morning I was going to
[1:09:49] bring it but I just thought I'll leave
[1:09:51] it back I went through it back to back I
[1:09:55] had to sew the back because the back was
[1:09:58] falling apart and uh and then a little
[1:10:00] on uh I you know I I got a company that
[1:10:03] gave me the a letter back
[1:10:06] praise the Lord
[1:10:08] amen and I was going to put my name on
[1:10:10] the Bible so I wrote my name uh
[1:10:14] uh I was just going to put brother on
[1:10:17] you know and then uh they did the first
[1:10:20] work they never did a good job they got
[1:10:22] back to me and they asked me to uh uh uh
[1:10:27] they apologized you know they wanted to
[1:10:28] do a good work and that's why I said
[1:10:30] okay this time I would not put brother
[1:10:31] one out for pastor one so now they
[1:10:34] pulled Pastor brother won
[1:10:40] praise the Lord
[1:10:46] and he did it free
[1:10:47] because their first job was not good I
[1:10:50] mean their company was going through a
[1:10:51] lot of things
[1:10:52] so but that caught my attention many
[1:10:55] years ago
[1:10:56] I was looking there I was saying there
[1:10:58] is something about this parenthesis
[1:11:00] in the in the coffee Bible you go to
[1:11:03] Revelation chapter 10 the same thing
[1:11:05] over the top of relation chapter 10
[1:11:06] there's a parenthesis there is something
[1:11:08] about it also but uh
[1:11:12] give her instruction to Daniel down here
[1:11:15] the prophet standing in the Holy place
[1:11:18] now look in your Bible
[1:11:20] it is parenthesis
[1:11:23] where the Bible says whosoever readeth
[1:11:26] let him understand
[1:11:30] it's in parenthesis
[1:11:33] which means
[1:11:35] God is calling your attention pay
[1:11:39] attention to this
[1:11:40] pay attention to this
[1:11:43] these are the internal thoughts of God
[1:11:48] put into words
[1:11:51] and all the words in this book just like
[1:11:54] the book of Saint John said if all the
[1:11:57] things that Jesus did was recorded we
[1:11:59] will not have a book to carry it
[1:12:02] won't have a book to continue
[1:12:06] these are not just the Mad worlds of men
[1:12:10] that we can just put our human
[1:12:12] interpretation tall
[1:12:14] whosoever read it let him understand
[1:12:20] question and answers
[1:12:22] uh See Jesus refer to it said and in
[1:12:27] parenthesis you go in the gospel Jesus
[1:12:30] also referred to the same thing he says
[1:12:32] let him that readeth understand
[1:12:36] perfect strain wash these parenthesis
[1:12:39] that is this one is from Hebrew 11.
[1:12:42] of whom the word was not worthy of
[1:12:46] when the Bible was talking about all the
[1:12:49] heroes of faith the man and the women
[1:12:52] their their faith was projected Through
[1:12:56] the Bible says of whom the word was not
[1:12:59] worthy of
[1:13:01] and the scholar choose to put that into
[1:13:05] parentheses
[1:13:07] it has a weight
[1:13:10] it has a weight
[1:13:12] praise the Lord
[1:13:15] they wander in desert in mountains and
[1:13:17] dens and in order there the perfect
[1:13:21] strength of such a perfect man he used
[1:13:23] the same uh talking about that and all
[1:13:26] the her trials crew or Morgan sculpting
[1:13:29] yemo over bounding imprisonment they
[1:13:33] were soon they were sword asunder they
[1:13:37] were tempted they were slain but with a
[1:13:40] sword they wandered about in in
[1:13:42] sheepskin and ghost King and being
[1:13:45] destitute and Afflicted to method of
[1:13:48] whom the word is not worthy of see in
[1:13:51] parenthesis there you know this in your
[1:13:54] Bible
[1:13:56] piece of the trumpet
[1:13:59] now notice Revelation 1 to 7 all the
[1:14:02] Mysteries are to be revealed toward the
[1:14:05] bride
[1:14:07] by the messenger the loudisha church
[1:14:10] has anybody got a
[1:14:13] revised version Bible
[1:14:16] if you have you will notice
[1:14:20] there's where it says the angel
[1:14:23] it's in parentheses
[1:14:26] it says the ego
[1:14:32] now so parenthesis uh
[1:14:38] uh it's like an addition by the way of
[1:14:40] explanation
[1:14:42] is somehow complete in itself it holds a
[1:14:45] message
[1:14:46] is complete in itself
[1:14:50] amen
[1:15:00] you know so we see uh I brought all of
[1:15:03] this just to to show you that this story
[1:15:06] is dropped in here
[1:15:08] uh
[1:15:11] in the parentheses
[1:15:16] even though
[1:15:18] uh
[1:15:21] you know it has it has
[1:15:25] not much attachment to the the Joseph
[1:15:29] story but
[1:15:33] it has some some deep application to it
[1:15:38] in some deep way
[1:15:40] now you will see this will give you an
[1:15:44] idea of
[1:15:45] of what the seals are
[1:15:50] you know the seals are not something
[1:15:52] that are away from the scriptures the
[1:15:56] cus are right in the scripture
[1:15:58] is it will also help you to understand
[1:16:01] uh the language reading between the
[1:16:05] lines
[1:16:06] okay so this story about Judah and tema
[1:16:13] it reads between the line it it shows uh
[1:16:17] uh you know of what is uh is is taking
[1:16:22] place here what God is doing right here
[1:16:24] in the life of Joseph in the life of his
[1:16:28] I mean the history of Israel and uh uh
[1:16:33] uh going over to the
[1:16:38] Egypt and back to the promised land
[1:16:42] so last Sunday we spoke on she's more
[1:16:45] righteous than all I will I will take
[1:16:48] this as a part two to that
[1:16:50] and uh
[1:16:53] so just like I said if you if you look
[1:16:56] through uh the story here you will see
[1:16:59] that uh uh Judah first gave Tema uh his
[1:17:04] daughter-in-law
[1:17:07] to his son Earth
[1:17:09] there was uh
[1:17:12] uh the first man
[1:17:14] in her life
[1:17:19] was also giving to her to raise it onto
[1:17:23] his brother he refused and the Lord
[1:17:25] slayed him for that and that's the
[1:17:28] second man and then uh Sheila will be
[1:17:32] the third man praise the Lord
[1:17:35] and uh if you listen to the story here
[1:17:39] in Judah uh uh confession he says that
[1:17:44] because I refuse because I gave her net
[1:17:48] to Sheila my son
[1:17:50] so that's the reason why she did this
[1:17:53] and then now Judah will also now be the
[1:17:57] fourth man in her life
[1:18:00] praise the Lord
[1:18:03] but if you bring all of this over to
[1:18:06] Revelation chapter 6
[1:18:09] you will see that uh
[1:18:12] just like how the the the Full House
[1:18:16] rather was trying to stop the blessing
[1:18:19] from coming to the church God also have
[1:18:22] a full anointing Through the Ages that
[1:18:25] was also as a defense unto the church
[1:18:29] praise the Lord amen
[1:18:31] so uh uh
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:36] I mean there is there is just so much in
[1:18:38] this that I could I can just go out of
[1:18:40] out of strip and just go on and on and
[1:18:43] on
[1:18:44] but we want to we want to stay in line
[1:18:47] this uh this uh this morning uh we
[1:18:50] started off the subject uh talking on
[1:18:52] this Jesus in Matthew Chapter 5 to the
[1:18:57] disciples that accept your righteousness
[1:19:00] exceed the righteousness of the stripe
[1:19:04] and Pharisees you will no longer uh
[1:19:07] inherit the kingdom of heaven so we were
[1:19:09] looking at exceeding righteousness what
[1:19:12] is that exceeding righteousness that's
[1:19:14] what we were looking at so for us to be
[1:19:17] able to grab the picture we have to go
[1:19:19] back to Genesis and look through the
[1:19:22] Bible and see how God play out his
[1:19:25] righteousness
[1:19:26] amen because the Bible make us to know
[1:19:29] our righteousness is just like a filthy
[1:19:31] Ray
[1:19:32] amen and and and and uh if we have any
[1:19:37] righteousness is what God imputed
[1:19:41] amen is what God imputed unto us and is
[1:19:45] very very beautiful because when God
[1:19:48] started dealing with our Father Abraham
[1:19:51] the Bible says Abraham believed God
[1:19:55] and it was imputed
[1:19:58] unto him
[1:20:01] amen
[1:20:02] it was not something let me just say
[1:20:05] like this let me say like this so you
[1:20:07] can grab where I'm going this morning I
[1:20:09] will not carry you down through the all
[1:20:11] around the Rabbit Trail
[1:20:14] Abraham believed that whatever he was
[1:20:17] doing was right
[1:20:21] praise the Lord
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:24] Abraham was well acknowledged of uh uh
[1:20:28] of his weaknesses praise the Lord there
[1:20:32] over in Egypt he was reasoning in his
[1:20:35] mind if I tell these people that Sarah
[1:20:37] is my wife they're going to kill me and
[1:20:39] take her so he lied
[1:20:42] amen he faction everything in his mind
[1:20:45] he tore a line
[1:20:49] are we together
[1:20:50] praise the Lord
[1:20:52] and uh uh
[1:20:56] uh uh
[1:20:58] Hebrew chapter 11. let's look at Hebrew
[1:21:00] chapter 11.
[1:21:02] because we we need to get down we need
[1:21:04] to get this down
[1:21:12] we need to try to nail this down
[1:21:23] Hebrew chapter 11.
[1:21:25] we are trying to look at exceeding
[1:21:27] righteousness that's the picture but for
[1:21:30] us to be able to understand what Jesus
[1:21:33] meant we have to go back to Genesis
[1:21:36] because the Old Testament is a shadow of
[1:21:39] the New Testament so God play out those
[1:21:43] things in the life of his people verse 4
[1:21:45] the Bible says by faith
[1:21:48] in their offer unto God and more
[1:21:53] excellent
[1:21:55] she's more righteous than I
[1:21:58] he offer unto God a more excellent
[1:22:03] praise the Lord sacrifice than King
[1:22:07] by which he or team Witness
[1:22:10] that he was righteous now you see when
[1:22:15] Abel was doing that Abel was not doing
[1:22:18] it with the Consciousness that I'm
[1:22:21] righteous that's why I'm doing this
[1:22:25] no he was not doing you know this is the
[1:22:28] righteous way to do it no
[1:22:31] but one thing for sure is that he was
[1:22:35] convinced that whatever he was doing was
[1:22:38] right
[1:22:39] man
[1:22:40] praise the Lord or you have to be
[1:22:42] convinced that you are in the right
[1:22:44] place this morning
[1:22:46] you have to be convinced I can be
[1:22:48] convinced for you I'm convinced that
[1:22:51] whatever I'm preaching to you is the
[1:22:52] truth I'm convinced because I know if I
[1:22:55] lie to you I'll be condemned to hell
[1:23:03] praise the Lord
[1:23:04] amen oh I'm not I'm not coming with a
[1:23:07] mind that whatever I appreciate is going
[1:23:09] to change their life no I'm more
[1:23:11] convinced that this word is true I
[1:23:14] convinced that it has the power to
[1:23:16] change our life
[1:23:18] praise the Lord
[1:23:25] are we together the Bible says he
[1:23:28] attained a witness
[1:23:31] that he was righteous
[1:23:35] God testifying of his gift
[1:23:41] so it's not Abel
[1:23:44] blowing his own trumpet
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:49] it's not able being critical of of uh of
[1:23:54] of King's sacrifice
[1:23:57] amen and I would tell you also that King
[1:24:00] was convinced that he was doing the
[1:24:03] right thing
[1:24:05] he was convinced
[1:24:08] praise the Lord
[1:24:09] but it will tell you that uh it's not
[1:24:13] all about how sincere you are
[1:24:16] but what your sincerity is based on
[1:24:21] right praise the Lord because Faith must
[1:24:25] have a resting place and the resting
[1:24:28] place for faith is God's word not our
[1:24:32] ideas not our good intention it must be
[1:24:35] God's word because only God's word will
[1:24:38] never fail
[1:24:42] our good intentions will fail
[1:24:46] praise the Lord and sometimes that's
[1:24:48] when it hurts you so bad
[1:24:50] because your intention was good and you
[1:24:53] mean good
[1:24:55] praise the Lord
[1:24:57] that's when it can really get down to
[1:24:59] you
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:03] but it had to be based on God's word
[1:25:06] praise the Lord it had to be based on
[1:25:09] God's word let me tell you this Bible
[1:25:11] you hold on your life for we preaching

[1:26:28] same
[1:26:30] Hallelujah your life will never be the
[1:26:33] same if you can break into those uh uh
[1:26:37] channels of blessing amen Hallelujah
[1:26:40] sometimes we trust our bash more than we
[1:26:43] trust the pages of this Bible Hallelujah
[1:26:47] glory be to God
[1:26:49] amen
[1:26:51] as soon as
[1:26:53] you know the whole day will go won't
[1:26:55] even ask where the Bible is it's not

[1:27:15] that building
[1:27:16] amen and the day they want to take it
[1:27:18] from you they would they would speak to
[1:27:21] you nicely
[1:27:23] and tell you just lay on the table
[1:27:29] praise the Lord but the one that make
[1:27:31] these promises
[1:27:33] he never take his word back amen
[1:27:37] he never take his word back the only
[1:27:39] thing that is limiting you from
[1:27:41] assessing is you
[1:27:48] the one that put his blessings in the
[1:27:51] pages of this book never take it back
[1:27:53] he's not an Indian giver
[1:27:59] colony
[1:28:08] praise the Lord
[1:28:09] Hallelujah the scripture says that evil
[1:28:14] had a witness
[1:28:17] he had a witness God testifying in so
[1:28:21] much that God allowed his blood to speak
[1:28:24] out of the Earth
[1:28:26] God testifying
[1:28:29] that he was righteous
[1:28:31] but when you look at the scene you look
[1:28:35] at the scene praise the Lord
[1:28:37] and that's all I want to tell you this
[1:28:40] morning you must be convinced of what
[1:28:41] you are doing
[1:28:43] praise the Lord he must be convinced of
[1:28:45] what you are doing that's why you cannot
[1:28:48] serve two masters
[1:28:49] amen there's no time to play church and
[1:28:52] play games
[1:28:55] you are either out in or you are out
[1:29:04] praise the Lord
[1:29:07] I mean he was just uh uh uh a Shepherd
[1:29:12] boy and uh uh and and and and and and
[1:29:15] and and time for worship he just he just
[1:29:18] felt like how you know this was the
[1:29:19] right thing this was the writing now you
[1:29:22] see that as as message Believers we have
[1:29:25] been exposed to such a Ministry that
[1:29:27] have opened the scriptures to us the
[1:29:29] first thing that comes to our mind
[1:29:30] Revelation what we call revelation what
[1:29:33] you call revelation
[1:29:35] what you call Revelation is something
[1:29:39] that has already been revealed to a
[1:29:40] prophet and he helps you to understand
[1:29:44] praise the Lord so to many many of us
[1:29:46] what we call Revelation is just
[1:29:48] knowledge
[1:29:50] it's just knowledge it's an after effect
[1:29:58] praise the Lord you understanding your
[1:30:02] understanding that it was blood in the
[1:30:05] Garden of Eden your understanding that
[1:30:09] God Rob Adam and Eve in a bloody Court
[1:30:13] took the fake Leaf out of them and and
[1:30:16] slay alarm and and wrap them up in that
[1:30:20] code your understanding linking it
[1:30:22] toward Abe sacrifice is
[1:30:26] that's why you call revelation
[1:30:32] I got the revelation
[1:30:35] it's called an understanding
[1:30:40] praise the Lord
[1:30:42] you just got an understanding you know I
[1:30:44] mean we then we get so excited about it
[1:30:46] that's the reason why Paul says he said
[1:30:48] knowledge puff up
[1:30:51] he says normally because when you get
[1:30:54] that understanding that then your head
[1:30:56] become big on your shoulders
[1:30:58] and you think now now you know the Bible
[1:31:01] I gave a revelation of discipancy
[1:31:05] you just have a knowledge
[1:31:09] you just have a knowledge
[1:31:12] now when that knowledge
[1:31:15] starts affecting your life
[1:31:19] when that knowledge that Suburban talks
[1:31:22] about the Supernatural part of
[1:31:24] Revelation one part is the unveiling one
[1:31:27] part is the knowledge there is another
[1:31:28] part
[1:31:31] that affects you
[1:31:34] right praise the Lord
[1:31:35] that Beyond
[1:31:38] able beyond the lamb that was slain in
[1:31:41] the Garden of Eden Beyond yet their
[1:31:43] sacrifice you now starts to see your own
[1:31:47] filthiness your own nakedness you now
[1:31:50] start to understand that Jesus died to
[1:31:53] cover the nakedness
[1:31:55] that sin is supposed to
[1:31:58] praise the Lord amen
[1:32:01] their noun is becoming a revelation
[1:32:03] because that knowledge now is now
[1:32:06] affecting you it's coming home
[1:32:12] you see that's the reason why the man
[1:32:14] can have a knowledge of the word he can
[1:32:17] talks about it he can argue about it
[1:32:21] but he can live under the privilege of
[1:32:24] the blessing
[1:32:25] which means it has no effect on his life
[1:32:32] praise the Lord
[1:32:34] it has no effect
[1:32:37] and those are the people that can get
[1:32:39] angry they can ready to fight for their
[1:32:40] revelation
[1:32:42] they're ready to beat you
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:50] because there is really no after effect
[1:32:57] there is really no after effect get into
[1:33:00] a conversation
[1:33:02] just cross their path a little bit
[1:33:05] they get irritated they're angry
[1:33:09] you are expectancy you're going to help
[1:33:16] it's all because they are afraid of hell
[1:33:18] that's why they are blowing hell out
[1:33:23] now so we we are looking at this so we
[1:33:26] see here that
[1:33:28] evil evil
[1:33:32] his his approach to God
[1:33:35] his approach to God come in
[1:33:38] just us
[1:33:42] bringing the alarm you know like Barbara
[1:33:44] says there was not a knife so he took uh
[1:33:48] uh uh uh a rock
[1:33:53] and how cruel that looks like taking a
[1:33:56] shot Rock and then and just turning that
[1:33:58] little lamb head and you know and
[1:34:00] stripping the Rock and the blonde
[1:34:03] streaming and all of that
[1:34:06] praise the Lord
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:11] but because he was convinced that he was
[1:34:14] doing the right thing
[1:34:17] praise the Lord
[1:34:19] because he was convinced that he was
[1:34:21] doing the right thing I mean he didn't
[1:34:23] know uh uh uh uh put the alarm down and
[1:34:27] try to cut it stacking yeah yeah
[1:34:31] no
[1:34:33] he was convinced that he was doing the
[1:34:34] right thing so he held that line down
[1:34:37] he wanted the blood to come out he
[1:34:40] wanted to put it on the altar
[1:34:43] praise the Lord
[1:34:46] some of the struggle we go through
[1:34:49] amen
[1:34:51] blood splashing all over him
[1:34:57] I was telling you my king saying how
[1:34:59] cruel he can be
[1:35:01] oh my God that God is clearer
[1:35:05] praise the Lord
[1:35:11] for hundreds of years the cruelty of our
[1:35:13] sin
[1:35:15] the cruelty of our sin
[1:35:18] will take an innocent Christ to the
[1:35:20] cross
[1:35:22] the Lord
[1:35:24] amen so you see it is dead is that it's
[1:35:29] it's one fit in it fit is if if they'll
[1:35:33] believe that what he was doing and
[1:35:35] because he was convinced he was doing
[1:35:37] the right thing
[1:35:39] amen
[1:35:43] the Bible says God bear him with us
[1:35:46] that he was righteous
[1:35:49] so in a sense God imputed righteousness
[1:35:52] to Abel
[1:35:55] because he did the right thing
[1:36:01] praise the Lord
[1:36:03] amen King was convinced he was doing the
[1:36:06] right thing
[1:36:08] but even after he did it and realized it
[1:36:11] never provide produced the result he got
[1:36:14] angry that's the difference
[1:36:17] hmm
[1:36:19] he took an offense
[1:36:22] he got angry that is the difference
[1:36:27] you believe that you are doing the right
[1:36:29] thing is it's good but when you realize
[1:36:32] that you have failed you must accept
[1:36:35] that I I have fear
[1:36:38] I need to come back
[1:36:40] and start again I need to get this right
[1:36:48] praise the Lord
[1:36:50] amen now not not getting
[1:36:54] because of your failure you get you get
[1:36:57] angry with everybody you know everybody
[1:36:59] the devil
[1:37:02] so the problem is not the people it's
[1:37:04] you that's right
[1:37:06] the problem was not able it was King his
[1:37:10] heart was not right
[1:37:17] praise the Lord
[1:37:23] the Bible says God is Not unjust
[1:37:26] to forget our labor of love
[1:37:29] God is a rewarder of them that diligent
[1:37:33] is seeking God reward he's he's the
[1:37:37] father that passes on our back when we
[1:37:40] do the right thing
[1:37:42] praise the Lord so whenever we do the
[1:37:45] right thing we do the right thing
[1:37:47] because it's the right thing to do not
[1:37:51] the right thing because I want a name or
[1:37:53] I want to be praised it's the right
[1:37:55] thing because it's the right thing to do
[1:37:58] women
[1:37:59] amen praise the Lord
[1:38:02] thank God
[1:38:04] impute
[1:38:06] righteousness
[1:38:11] praise the Lord
[1:38:12] he impaled righteousness
[1:38:15] now you see the Pharisees they are
[1:38:17] righteousness was a self-righteousness
[1:38:20] because it was it was all according to
[1:38:24] the book the length of the of the of
[1:38:26] their garment they are scared you know
[1:38:28] wide in every everything was according
[1:38:30] to the book
[1:38:33] praise the Lord
[1:38:35] amen
[1:38:36] it was all according to the book
[1:38:39] but you see when Jesus spoke to them he
[1:38:42] said you are just like a grave
[1:38:46] that is painted white outside
[1:38:50] but your heart
[1:38:52] behind the white garment is like Dead
[1:38:54] Man Bones
[1:38:59] you actual desire in your heart
[1:39:03] is different from what your outward
[1:39:05] appearing is reflecting
[1:39:10] praise the Lord
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:13] time I've been around for a while
[1:39:16] should be in a while around for a while
[1:39:19] praise the Lord
[1:39:21] amen
[1:39:22] she knew they had this who who have
[1:39:26] caused so death if he was the wrong
[1:39:28] person
[1:39:31] so you see she set herself out for the
[1:39:34] father himself
[1:39:37] amen
[1:39:42] she said herself Our Father father
[1:39:43] himself
[1:39:46] just like we said uh uh uh last Sunday
[1:39:49] she wanted to be identified With the
[1:39:51] blessings of Abraham
[1:39:54] she wanted to be identified with The
[1:39:57] Blessing of Abraham but tell me tell me
[1:39:59] now do do tell my ever had a mind I want
[1:40:02] I want to be if I do this thing
[1:40:05] if I if I if I present myself as a halot
[1:40:10] I would be in the language of Jesus
[1:40:13] Christ that she ever had an idea on that
[1:40:15] no
[1:40:17] the right thing the hope for her the
[1:40:20] right thing is that
[1:40:22] I want to be redeemed
[1:40:25] amen
[1:40:28] I want to be redeemed the Bible says she
[1:40:30] was a Canaanite woman
[1:40:33] she wanted to be brought into the
[1:40:36] blessing
[1:40:39] praise the Lord
[1:40:40] because that was the thing that changes
[1:40:43] the strangers in Israel if a man was a
[1:40:48] stranger in Israel and you will you
[1:40:51] embody the camp you have to be
[1:40:53] circumcised
[1:40:56] even though you are a stranger if you
[1:40:59] are a second son if you are circumcised
[1:41:01] you take on the mark of the blessing of
[1:41:04] Abraham
[1:41:06] now they can count they can call you
[1:41:08] their own
[1:41:10] now for a warmer
[1:41:13] because the sign of circumcision was
[1:41:16] brought by marriage
[1:41:18] amen so for the woman she will want to
[1:41:21] have a seat she will want to have a
[1:41:24] child
[1:41:26] to be counted for the blessings
[1:41:30] or counted in the family
[1:41:33] in the household
[1:41:36] so all they tell my mind is the other uh
[1:41:40] if I just sit down here and do nothing
[1:41:44] praise the Lord

[1:41:52] amen
[1:41:57] have you seen what I'm going with this
[1:42:00] so in in in her mind
[1:42:06] she wanted to be identified that the
[1:42:08] thing that drove her to that
[1:42:11] was to be counted in the blessings of
[1:42:15] Abraham
[1:42:17] praise the Lord
[1:42:18] amen
[1:42:21] coming from a house
[1:42:23] wow I never seen a halot here
[1:42:26] Howard are increasing these days she's

[1:42:47] for she believed that she believed that
[1:42:50] if this happened I'm in the season of
[1:42:53] life
[1:42:54] if this can happen I believe
[1:42:58] praise the Lord
[1:43:01] Hallelujah
[1:43:03] oh no doubt there were many men that
[1:43:06] came in and and tried to call unto her

[1:43:14] and I praise the lord well that your
[1:43:17] business

[1:43:42] Hallelujah
[1:43:46] are we together
[1:43:49] what was what was the desire in her
[1:43:52] heart what was pushing her was to be

[1:44:00] praise the Lord
[1:44:02] amen
[1:44:04] if you can tell that
[1:44:06] from Judah expression
[1:44:11] she's more righteous
[1:44:14] than I
[1:44:17] because I give not Sheila my son
[1:44:21] to her
[1:44:23] praise the Lord
[1:44:24] amen
[1:44:28] now so let's let's just deal with some
[1:44:31] few things on on righteousness here
[1:44:34] foreign
[1:44:35] let's just deal with some few things on
[1:44:37] righteousness because you see the uh
[1:44:41] since we are
[1:44:45] we were I mean uh even nature around us
[1:44:48] I mean the way the weather is going and
[1:44:51] everything is going oh my goodness
[1:44:53] praise the Lord you just think about uh
[1:44:56] you know even now I mean
[1:45:00] Hollow that uh uh this nation that God
[1:45:05] himself raised
[1:45:07] praise the Lord
[1:45:09] amen parallel to Israel
[1:45:13] and to see the things that is happening
[1:45:16] around this nation where we find
[1:45:19] ourselves
[1:45:21] praise the Lord
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:24] is mind-blowing
[1:45:26] it's just telling you how dark the days
[1:45:29] are getting
[1:45:31] in one of the most re respected
[1:45:35] political parties they just had a drama
[1:45:37] the entire week
[1:45:41] it just shows how when the principle of
[1:45:45] God's word
[1:45:49] is overlooked
[1:45:51] a man is nothing but a beast
[1:45:58] praise the Lord
[1:46:00] amen
[1:46:02] so that's that's what I want you to I
[1:46:06] want us to be able to grab you know I
[1:46:09] want us to be able to grab because just
[1:46:11] like we said we were getting there and
[1:46:13] and and talk about it you know uh uh uh
[1:46:18] uh fact the way that God deals with us
[1:46:21] it blew my mind you know uh uh you you
[1:46:24] you uh you you listen to uh the
[1:46:28] discernments and and a lot of those
[1:46:30] things that are on tape you will realize
[1:46:32] that the discernment in most cases goes
[1:46:36] to what was lying in the people's
[1:46:39] subconscious
[1:46:42] amen here is a person here dealing with
[1:46:45] with uh with with sickness in their body
[1:46:48] a person here dealing with uh with with
[1:46:52] I mean they are so fearful so scary
[1:46:54] another prophet of God under honor the
[1:46:57] gift of God will go back in there in in
[1:47:00] in India alive that when they were six
[1:47:03] years old a dog make you afraid
[1:47:06] and that thing affected your spirit and
[1:47:09] make you nervous
[1:47:10] and all of these like all of these years
[1:47:13] you have been so nervous
[1:47:15] it is just because of that thing that
[1:47:17] affected your spirit when you were six
[1:47:20] years old
[1:47:21] so you see what the gift of God does is
[1:47:23] that it goes down to your subconscious
[1:47:26] because your subconscious is the real
[1:47:29] you right
[1:47:33] right praise the Lord your first
[1:47:34] conscience is just the vehicle that is
[1:47:38] driving your subconscious
[1:47:40] your subconscious is the real you the
[1:47:44] things that you deal with and you hide
[1:47:46] down in your feelings and in your
[1:47:48] emotions that's the real you
[1:47:52] that's the reason why I always say let's
[1:47:55] forget about it never solve a problem
[1:47:59] if it's a problem we must not forget
[1:48:01] about it let's deal with it
[1:48:06] I'll let you forget about it it does not
[1:48:08] solve a problem
[1:48:10] it does not solve a problem
[1:48:12] take that from out of your vocabulary
[1:48:14] because it's not going to help you if
[1:48:17] it's a problem let's deal with it right
[1:48:20] because the sooner we can deal with it
[1:48:22] the better we will be
[1:48:24] because if you just forget about it
[1:48:27] you have to realize that
[1:48:30] you have one ability
[1:48:33] by the the nature of falling is that you
[1:48:36] cannot forget
[1:48:39] what you think you are forgetting about
[1:48:42] you are just sending it back to your
[1:48:44] subconscious keep it for me you chunk it
[1:48:46] like this keep it for me
[1:48:48] praise the Lord then your subconscious
[1:48:51] gravity hope
[1:48:54] and just put it down
[1:48:56] praise the Lord
[1:48:58] let's forget about it
[1:49:00] in two months that's the same thing you
[1:49:02] did the last time I said I forget about
[1:49:03] it that was the very same thing
[1:49:10] glory be to God the subconscious that
[1:49:13] gave you a pass
[1:49:15] and you pick it up and then you start
[1:49:17] running with it to go do a touchdown
[1:49:28] so you see
[1:49:32] you
[1:49:32] we all dress ourselves up nice letting
[1:49:36] you know try keep a smile on our face
[1:49:39] this morning and we all trying to pay
[1:49:41] attention and you you're trying to keep
[1:49:43] as smart I mean but you see reality the
[1:49:46] preaching of the word goes beyond all
[1:49:50] your
[1:49:51] beautiful nice faces
[1:49:54] the preaching of the Gospel
[1:49:57] it's ordained to go and hunt
[1:50:01] in your subconscious
[1:50:05] praise the Lord
[1:50:07] amen
[1:50:08] that's the reason why the preacher can
[1:50:10] say it's one thing and you are just
[1:50:12] caught in it
[1:50:14] your mind's like oh yeah
[1:50:16] and and the rest of the rest of the
[1:50:18] thing he's saying you you are not with
[1:50:20] him for a while because that thing just
[1:50:22] have been identified with something in
[1:50:25] your subconscious and you are just
[1:50:27] dwelling in debt for a while
[1:50:31] and all the the one hour I take yelling
[1:50:34] and everything is that one thing you
[1:50:36] remember why because the subconscious
[1:50:38] pick it up
[1:50:40] and say there is something here that
[1:50:41] identified with what I'm dealing with
[1:50:46] praise the Lord
[1:50:49] have everybody I see our service today
[1:50:51] oh wonderful what did the preacher
[1:50:53] preach I don't
[1:50:55] know
[1:50:56] praise the Lord
[1:50:58] and sometimes you you want to feel bad
[1:51:00] about it but it's nothing to feel bad
[1:51:02] about
[1:51:04] praise the lord it's nothing to feedback
[1:51:06] you should only feel bad if you were
[1:51:08] sleeping right
[1:51:10] praise the Lord
[1:51:11] because it will have been better for you
[1:51:13] to stay in your bed
[1:51:15] where you are stretching flat
[1:51:19] amen
[1:51:21] then to be knocked in your head and
[1:51:23] almost want to knock the person before
[1:51:24] you
[1:51:29] praise the Lord
[1:51:32] amen
[1:51:34] why because what happened is that as you
[1:51:39] are hearing the word the Bible says
[1:51:41] faith come about hearing and hearing of
[1:51:43] the word of God as you are hearing the
[1:51:45] word your subconscious is pulling
[1:51:49] and
[1:51:50] your subconscious is pulling on the word
[1:51:53] and and and that's the same thing that's
[1:51:55] that's what faith is that's what
[1:51:57] Revelation is
[1:52:01] praise the Lord
[1:52:03] sometimes you are reading something in
[1:52:05] God's word and and it just and honestly
[1:52:08] just open to you you love it and for a
[1:52:10] while it gone oh man I couldn't just I
[1:52:13] can't remember
[1:52:14] yeah I can't remember it it was good
[1:52:17] no it's just going down
[1:52:21] praise the Lord you realize as you go on
[1:52:24] couple of weeks when you feel you are
[1:52:26] reading the word or something you are
[1:52:27] doing it will just pop out again there
[1:52:29] will be some action that that word that
[1:52:31] is so down in your heart will be
[1:52:33] identified with
[1:52:39] praise the Lord and that is the same
[1:52:41] thing with fears that is the same thing
[1:52:43] without
[1:52:50] I was listening to uh
[1:52:53] to something on trauma
[1:52:56] the last time
[1:52:58] or this this gone week
[1:53:02] two weeks now I've been I've been
[1:53:04] listening to it and I mean a very
[1:53:06] beautiful research
[1:53:07] very beautiful
[1:53:09] research uh
[1:53:11] uh and
[1:53:13] and something was said
[1:53:16] that that just I just it's not that it
[1:53:19] blew my mind but it's just it just makes
[1:53:21] me to see the other side uh uh and uh
[1:53:25] and and this doctor was saying the other
[1:53:29] oh man I hope I hope I can be able to
[1:53:32] to really digest the whole thinking and
[1:53:35] you know that God can be able to bless
[1:53:37] it in a way we can be able to take
[1:53:38] something from there to to be able to
[1:53:41] bring you see I was I was I started
[1:53:44] speaking here on on the message uh
[1:53:47] entitled to the abuse for some reason I
[1:53:49] can't get back to that message here I
[1:53:52] don't know why every time I look at the
[1:53:55] subject I want to get back to it uh uh
[1:53:58] for some reason I don't know why I'm
[1:54:01] just not uh uh not having the Liberty to
[1:54:05] to get into it but it's it's something
[1:54:07] that when I when I get back to studying
[1:54:10] and look into it and every time I deal
[1:54:12] with all of these things trauma and
[1:54:13] different things it it kind of for
[1:54:16] waking the reality of that to to me of
[1:54:20] how much that uh every one of us every
[1:54:23] man born of a woman is one way or the
[1:54:26] other we have experienced some level of
[1:54:28] abuse in our life
[1:54:31] praise the Lord just for the fact that
[1:54:34] we are born in sin it's an abuse
[1:54:37] it's an abuse the serpent abuse our
[1:54:40] mother Eve
[1:54:44] and it has affected us with a sinful
[1:54:47] nature
[1:54:49] praise the Lord
[1:54:51] and all of those things whatever we deal
[1:54:53] with
[1:54:54] the the good things like the the word
[1:54:58] the revelation of the word as it goes
[1:55:00] down and and and and and so in our
[1:55:04] subconscious as Faith that's the same
[1:55:07] way with the negative things we deal
[1:55:09] with
[1:55:12] praise the Lord they said there
[1:55:16] they say they especially when we don't
[1:55:18] deal with them
[1:55:21] as a Believer we have been giving the
[1:55:23] grace to be able to deal with those
[1:55:26] things and by God's grace we can bring
[1:55:28] them to the Fountain drain from Immanuel
[1:55:31] vein and we can place some of those
[1:55:34] hurtful things under the blood
[1:55:36] we will not forget about them but every
[1:55:38] time they comes to our mind we will have
[1:55:41] the grace
[1:55:42] to know that his grace is sufficient
[1:55:45] praise the lord we will have the grace
[1:55:48] we will continue to claim Lord your
[1:55:51] grace is sufficient your strength is
[1:55:53] made perfect in my weakness
[1:55:56] praise the Lord Hallelujah and and that
[1:56:00] and and and for for for for most of the
[1:56:03] fact is that's the reason why they are
[1:56:05] hard to talk about because they are
[1:56:07] hurtful
[1:56:10] foreign
[1:56:16] and this guy was saying he says uh uh he
[1:56:19] says the more the doubt the more the
[1:56:23] awareness
[1:56:27] as I pause it for a while I said
[1:56:31] is there a good thing in doubt
[1:56:35] praise the Lord
[1:56:37] amen he says the little the doubt the
[1:56:41] little your awareness
[1:56:45] the more you doubt
[1:56:47] the more your awareness
[1:56:50] processes
[1:56:52] um
[1:56:55] okay
[1:56:57] okay
[1:57:04] so you see that as we talk about these
[1:57:07] ones of faith
[1:57:09] and these ones that
[1:57:12] righteousness
[1:57:16] was imperative
[1:57:18] you will realize that uh uh
[1:57:24] uh just like we said they were living
[1:57:25] their life and they were not they were
[1:57:28] not trying to uh uh you know they were
[1:57:32] not trying to to live out God's
[1:57:36] righteousness you see the the that
[1:57:40] deceitfulness
[1:57:41] that have happened in the recent time in
[1:57:44] the Christian age
[1:57:45] and it all goes back to that mother of
[1:57:49] heart
[1:57:50] she had brought such a deceitfulness
[1:57:53] upon the church
[1:57:54] and all of that thing has has made us to
[1:57:59] uh to uh uh to to put on you know a lot
[1:58:04] of self-righteousness
[1:58:07] praise the Lord when the church
[1:58:09] separated a certain group of people and
[1:58:11] it says these people they are just like
[1:58:13] uh the Virgin Mary and and these other
[1:58:16] people they are the holy fathers and
[1:58:18] they put them in white garment and over
[1:58:21] the years they have been highly esteemed
[1:58:23] and highly respected you know we we look
[1:58:26] at their outward closed and we just
[1:58:28] think oh my God these people are holding
[1:58:30] and all of that it it has just it have
[1:58:33] just it has Spilled Out a spirit of
[1:58:36] hypocrisy praise the Lord that we just
[1:58:40] think that you know our our Christianity
[1:58:43] is in our fine dresses that we wear our
[1:58:46] decent clothes that we wear we need to
[1:58:48] get the best clothes and the expensive
[1:58:50] one and all of that and we so it just
[1:58:53] all brought down to that
[1:58:56] praise the Lord oh yeah we must be
[1:58:58] decent amen I love to be descent it's
[1:59:01] it's a good thing I'm not I'm not crying
[1:59:04] on there but I'm just I'm just trying to
[1:59:06] show how uh uh the dominance of Catholic
[1:59:10] Spirit over the church is Spill out
[1:59:13] hypocrisy
[1:59:17] praise the Lord
[1:59:19] amen is spew out
[1:59:23] do you know even in a time of
[1:59:24] reformation
[1:59:26] in in a time of the Reformation
[1:59:31] your position in the church I mean where
[1:59:34] you sit
[1:59:36] it was based on how much money you make
[1:59:41] do you know that
[1:59:43] oh yeah
[1:59:49] it was based on how much money you make
[1:59:53] the rich bought their seats
[1:59:57] in the church
[1:59:59] the boy they are places
[2:00:01] these places was father Jones
[2:00:04] that's that's their Road nobody can sit
[2:00:06] there because every month they pay this
[2:00:09] amount of money
[2:00:13] amen
[2:00:15] the pleasant state to the back
[2:00:17] and sometimes they just have to stand up
[2:00:20] because even though
[2:00:23] the June says are not there but nobody
[2:00:25] can sit in their seats
[2:00:27] the seat is left empty
[2:00:32] it took one reformer Mela he he was the
[2:00:35] one that blasted against that
[2:00:37] in the England Church
[2:00:41] before it started coming
[2:00:43] an awareness to the people
[2:00:46] praise the Lord
[2:00:55] as I talk about this now there are just
[2:00:57] a lot of things that is going through my
[2:00:58] mind
[2:01:00] there's a lot of things that is going
[2:01:02] through my mind you look at the Bible
[2:01:04] look at the New Testament
[2:01:07] you look at the New Testament that's the
[2:01:10] reason why in every in every
[2:01:15] episode Paul always address something
[2:01:19] where he says uh Master be kind to your
[2:01:23] slave
[2:01:24] slave become to your masters
[2:01:26] because the New Testament Church
[2:01:29] was filled with those kind of for people
[2:01:34] amen the people that were finding hope
[2:01:38] in Redemption
[2:01:40] hope and salvation
[2:01:43] where the slaves
[2:01:50] praise the Lord
[2:02:00] those were the people
[2:02:03] hearing about a Redemption about a
[2:02:06] freedom
[2:02:08] they are the gospel could bring today
[2:02:12] praise the Lord
[2:02:17] and when they will sit down honor the
[2:02:20] teaching of of Paul
[2:02:22] and will realize that the gospel can
[2:02:25] make them and their masters to sit on
[2:02:27] the same table
[2:02:30] praise the Lord
[2:02:32] amen
[2:02:35] that even Paul will get right there and
[2:02:37] and and then he will frowned I peed it
[2:02:41] because he saw the Jews and he wanted to
[2:02:43] separate himself from the brethrings
[2:02:46] Paul will frown at him and said this is
[2:02:49] not what Christ died for
[2:02:53] praise the Lord
[2:02:56] glory be to God I'm kind of for straight
[2:02:59] in from my from my thoughts here but
[2:03:02] what I wanted what I was driving to
[2:03:04] before I got into all of this thing is
[2:03:07] to let us to know that uh uh uh I mean
[2:03:11] uh whatever the economy is going
[2:03:14] whatever wherever the nation is going
[2:03:17] wherever the word is driving tall
[2:03:21] in one sense
[2:03:24] it's not in our favor
[2:03:27] this word is not our home
[2:03:31] amen
[2:03:32] is going to get more nasty for the
[2:03:34] Believers
[2:03:37] it's going to get more uncomfortable for
[2:03:40] the Believers
[2:03:42] praise the Lord
[2:03:43] and let me tell you there are a lot of
[2:03:45] things that will happen that will make
[2:03:47] us over and over to doubt our faith
[2:03:52] right here
[2:03:55] and I think it's because we are getting
[2:03:59] in the wine press the Bible talks about
[2:04:01] a wine press in Revelation
[2:04:04] God is allowing these things to begin to
[2:04:08] squeeze us
[2:04:10] praise the Lord so we can realize what
[2:04:13] we are made out of is actually inside
[2:04:21] what we are made out of the things that
[2:04:23] is carrying you the thing that is
[2:04:25] governing your life
[2:04:29] praise the Lord
[2:04:33] that is not the bank account it's now
[2:04:36] your your job title it's not your
[2:04:39] position
[2:04:40] is now your achievement
[2:04:43] but it's what God has invested in you
[2:04:47] the investment that he made to have kept
[2:04:50] you from the day you were separated from
[2:04:52] your mother warm the things he allow you
[2:04:54] to go through
[2:04:57] also the things that Grace
[2:05:00] through the preaching of the Gospel have
[2:05:02] imparted to you
[2:05:06] praise the Lord
[2:05:09] all of these things
[2:05:13] all of these things
[2:05:15] we are getting
[2:05:17] to the wine praise
[2:05:21] the Lord
[2:05:22] amen
[2:05:24] so more and more
[2:05:27] he's making us to begin to look inside
[2:05:33] begin to look inside
[2:05:37] and appreciate those things
[2:05:39] that Grace is doing inside
[2:05:43] praise the Lord
[2:05:45] amen
[2:05:47] that Grace is doing inside
[2:05:52] we go through
[2:05:54] different trials and different things we
[2:05:57] deal with
[2:05:59] glory be to God
[2:06:05] and we are looking to something you know
[2:06:08] uh uh maybe uh
[2:06:12] a job application a change of job you
[2:06:16] know maybe to raise my income we are
[2:06:18] looking to more to those things
[2:06:20] it's not don't don't think that I'm
[2:06:22] frowning at that we are looking to those
[2:06:24] things that's that's the thing
[2:06:25] consciously we look to
[2:06:27] but the things that is holding you until
[2:06:31] those things come
[2:06:33] on Amen why you don't have those things
[2:06:36] here you don't have the degree you don't
[2:06:39] have the job you don't have the position
[2:06:41] the thing that is holding you and
[2:06:43] carrying you daily
[2:06:45] before those things come if they will
[2:06:47] ever come
[2:06:51] praise the Lord
[2:06:53] sometimes we ain't know it
[2:06:56] sometimes we pay no attention to it
[2:06:59] amen
[2:07:02] you don't have that year but there is
[2:07:04] something that is bringing you some
[2:07:06] satisfaction
[2:07:10] all right praise the Lord
[2:07:17] we are getting to
[2:07:19] dark Waters
[2:07:21] these are becoming glooming not day not
[2:07:25] night will be in promised in the evening
[2:07:27] time there shall be light this light has
[2:07:29] been shining praise the Lord use that
[2:07:32] light to brighten your path amen because
[2:07:35] the date is getting more darker
[2:07:38] it's getting more darker and there are
[2:07:40] things that are happening I mean the
[2:07:43] church is getting to its lowest part
[2:07:46] you know with criticians and all the
[2:07:48] things that is happening you know and
[2:07:50] and all of that
[2:07:53] but let's go ahead here and and be able
[2:07:55] to look at this I think that's that's
[2:07:57] one of the reasons why I feel that I'm
[2:07:59] dry I'm I'm I'm I'm being driven in this
[2:08:02] area because I want us I'm hoping that
[2:08:05] the grace of God will be able to help us
[2:08:07] to see that uh uh God
[2:08:12] has made some investment in our lives
[2:08:15] we've been playing the message
[2:08:16] investment
[2:08:18] God has made some investment in our
[2:08:20] lives
[2:08:22] praise the Lord
[2:08:23] and where your treasure is
[2:08:26] there your heart will be
[2:08:28] so it shows where God is
[2:08:31] is where his treasure is
[2:08:33] amen if you are God's treasure then his
[2:08:36] heart
[2:08:37] is after you
[2:08:39] praise the Lord because he have invested
[2:08:42] in your life all of these years every
[2:08:44] time you come to service there is
[2:08:46] something that is said and your
[2:08:47] subconscious pick it up and just drop it
[2:08:49] down amen some people you know the the
[2:08:54] you know they have uh they have some
[2:08:57] people use ATM machines some people go
[2:08:59] right to the counter and and turn all
[2:09:01] the bills to the person there some
[2:09:03] people use piggy bank maybe I'm a piggy
[2:09:05] bank guy you know little toss just drop
[2:09:08] down
[2:09:09] Nicholas and dime
[2:09:12] but
[2:09:14] God has invested in our lives
[2:09:17] amen
[2:09:19] he has invested in our lives and you put
[2:09:21] all of those piggy banks are for rainy
[2:09:23] days
[2:09:24] and the things that God have invested in
[2:09:26] our life is for these dark days
[2:09:30] praise the Lord is for all of these dark
[2:09:33] days and the gloomy days and the things
[2:09:35] that is coming upon the word and all of
[2:09:38] that
[2:09:39] but God has invested because he has a
[2:09:42] people on Earth he has invested because
[2:09:45] he has a bride
[2:09:47] amen
[2:09:48] let the enemy come as a floor amen God
[2:09:52] has a people that will be extender there
[2:09:54] will be a people that will live out his
[2:09:57] righteousness
[2:10:01] that is for us to understand how he's
[2:10:03] dealing with us
[2:10:05] how he's dealing with us
[2:10:08] more on the subconscious level
[2:10:11] praise the Lord
[2:10:13] more on the subconscious level trying to
[2:10:16] steal things down there so all of those
[2:10:20] faith that has been lying dumbing
[2:10:24] will start to burst forth
[2:10:26] because I'm telling you this bride will
[2:10:28] not barely make it she will overcome
[2:10:31] amen she will overcome he that overcome
[2:10:35] praise the Lord amen she will overcome
[2:10:39] because that's what the word says
[2:10:41] and the world overcome means to overcome
[2:10:45] that's what it means
[2:10:47] it means to overcome
[2:10:50] Hallelujah
[2:10:52] believe I'm talking about Zacharias he
[2:10:55] says Zacharias a righteous man not a
[2:10:59] sinless man
[2:11:00] but a man that depends on his
[2:11:05] righteousness depend on God's
[2:11:08] righteousness by confessing his wrong to
[2:11:12] God
[2:11:15] the Bible says uh Zacharias was a
[2:11:17] righteousness take this and say it's not
[2:11:20] a sinless man now a sinless man because
[2:11:23] you see that's the same thing I'm saying
[2:11:26] because of what the the mother church
[2:11:28] has done that mother hollowed because of
[2:11:31] the way they have gravitis sin amen so
[2:11:36] the way that we understand righteousness
[2:11:39] is to be sinless
[2:11:43] praise the Lord that's why you are uh uh
[2:11:47] uh you know we we feel condemning and
[2:11:50] Lord I'm not watching Lord I'm a sinner
[2:11:52] saved by Great Law I'm a sinner yes yes
[2:11:55] you are a sinner but Grace has already
[2:11:57] saved you
[2:12:01] Grace have already saved you Grace is
[2:12:03] changing your life
[2:12:07] praise the Lord
[2:12:09] now when will we say Lord thank you I'm
[2:12:11] a Son of God Lord thank you I'm a
[2:12:14] daughter of God I was a sinner saved by
[2:12:16] grace but now I'm a Child of God
[2:12:23] praise the Lord
[2:12:24] amen what would that be our confession
[2:12:27] our confession is always brother brother
[2:12:28] Johnny I've ripped this thing off
[2:12:32] praise the Lord
[2:12:36] that was what happened when we get
[2:12:37] excited
[2:12:39] he he takes another one here that speaks
[2:12:42] about Elijah in in James chapter 5.
[2:12:46] the effectual faith and prayer of a
[2:12:48] righteous man
[2:12:51] now you see where we are going
[2:12:54] Judah says she's more righteous than I
[2:12:57] amen
[2:12:59] now take Judah as the father he was the
[2:13:02] father-in-law Tema was the bride
[2:13:08] praise the Lord it means that this bride
[2:13:11] is going to express more of God's
[2:13:14] righteousness
[2:13:18] God is going to express his
[2:13:20] righteousness through his people in a
[2:13:23] way that it will be hard for our mind to
[2:13:26] comprehend because our mind has been so
[2:13:29] abused
[2:13:33] praise the Lord
[2:13:35] that we feel condemned for the least
[2:13:37] thoughts that comes through our mind
[2:13:41] but God is going to express his
[2:13:44] righteousness through Us in so in such a
[2:13:48] way
[2:13:50] when the whole world and and and and and
[2:13:53] and especially the internet age and all
[2:13:55] of the things that is projected there
[2:13:59] is to abuse the mind and and destroy the
[2:14:02] youthfulness but if God by his grace is
[2:14:05] God in your heart as a young man if God
[2:14:08] by his grace is giving you discernment
[2:14:10] to know what to turn away from praise
[2:14:13] the Lord then that is his righteousness
[2:14:15] that's being projected to you
[2:14:27] praise the Lord
[2:14:30] you are God's righteousness
[2:14:32] in this filthy age
[2:14:37] praise the Lord
[2:14:40] the grace that is given to fight against
[2:14:42] evil thought
[2:14:47] he's going to express his righteousness
[2:14:50] see how Tema Express a righteousness
[2:14:54] that was greater than the righteousness
[2:14:57] everybody respected Judah when he walked
[2:15:00] down the city everybody knew that that
[2:15:02] was Judah
[2:15:03] he was a prince
[2:15:06] that's why the star the bracelets all of
[2:15:08] those things man he was the prince
[2:15:10] highly respected by the Lord
[2:15:13] but see how that righteousness of tema
[2:15:17] beat him
[2:15:19] amen
[2:15:21] you will never even think that it was a
[2:15:23] righteousness
[2:15:26] because of the way she disguised herself
[2:15:29] how can she put herself out there
[2:15:32] can you imagine the whole Council
[2:15:34] sending up all the others and Tama
[2:15:38] coming and says tell me about a man to
[2:15:41] have this
[2:15:43] can you imagine what happened to the
[2:15:45] people they were standing there with
[2:15:47] their mouth drop open
[2:15:52] wow
[2:15:55] how did she did this
[2:15:58] how

[2:16:05] their homes

[2:16:16] I don't want giving me a problem in the
[2:16:18] house

[2:16:30] burned
[2:16:32] can you see everybody coming together
[2:16:35] the story they came with they went back
[2:16:38] with a seal open they went back with a
[2:16:41] revelation that they had never thought
[2:16:43] about in their life
[2:16:46] everybody came that morning with
[2:16:48] different story in their mind
[2:16:50] praise the Lord that's one thing about
[2:16:52] this Canada woman you can never trust

[2:17:29] she's more righteous
[2:17:38] praise the Lord
[2:17:41] amen
[2:17:44] that's the reason why I don't tell God
[2:17:47] Gave You Grace
[2:17:49] to understand the tasks that were behind
[2:17:51] this Prophet you will hold this very
[2:17:54] message and live in legalism

[2:18:00] you will be wanting to please brother
[2:18:02] Branham more than to please God
[2:18:04] when brother Brannon was bringing God's
[2:18:06] thoughts

[2:18:10] line and friendship

[2:21:42] and take out some of those things let's
[2:21:44] read this and find a place to close here
[2:21:46] now the righteous man is not a sinless
[2:21:50] man
[2:21:52] for you notice he said that's James
[2:21:56] Elijah was a man subject to like passion
[2:22:01] as we are
[2:22:03] that's what James said the Elijah was a
[2:22:06] man subject to lack passions like we are
[2:22:09] we saw in the scripture he got angry and
[2:22:12] caught a bear to eat of those children
[2:22:15] he had his ups and downs and his
[2:22:19] differences and the scripture
[2:22:22] of his life
[2:22:24] proved that he had his ups and down
[2:22:28] like we do
[2:22:30] he had his his time of wandering
[2:22:34] in his time that he was his time his
[2:22:39] Temple got away from him
[2:22:41] praise the word praise the Lord

[2:23:02] Temple is good it's bad when you lose it
[2:23:07] glory be to God
[2:23:10] amen
[2:23:15] and yeah he he got his temper away from
[2:23:18] him
[2:23:19] and he had a lot of things that went
[2:23:22] wrong
[2:23:22] but he was still a righteous man because
[2:23:27] he confessed his own wealthiness
[2:23:31] and believe in God
[2:23:34] praise the Lord
[2:23:35] amen
[2:23:37] he confessed his own righteousness and
[2:23:39] he believed in God
[2:23:41] so
[2:23:43] that's what made him righteous
[2:23:47] praise the Lord
[2:23:49] you see what was happening with those
[2:23:52] Patriots was around them
[2:23:55] all the nations around them were hidden
[2:23:59] Nations
[2:24:00] amen
[2:24:02] all the nations the Canaanites all the
[2:24:04] nations were the nation seven forced God
[2:24:09] what is difficult for us
[2:24:11] is
[2:24:13] the hypocracy
[2:24:16] amen that the mother Church the the
[2:24:19] impersonation that the Catholic church
[2:24:22] has put upon the word
[2:24:24] and has given birth to all of this
[2:24:27] church all of these different groups
[2:24:30] that is claiming to be Church of Christ
[2:24:31] Church of the Living God and all of that
[2:24:34] so it important but you see you see the
[2:24:37] uh with with the Patriots the old says
[2:24:40] all the nations around them were hidden

[2:24:44] so you see no matter what they were
[2:24:46] dealing with they they I mean it was
[2:24:49] hard for them to be Chalet because they
[2:24:52] had to look up to God
[2:24:54] violence
[2:24:56] praise the Lord
[2:24:59] by any religious cycle this group want
[2:25:02] to be better than this group you know
[2:25:04] because we are looking and comparing
[2:25:05] ourselves one with another
[2:25:12] he confesses on walterness and he
[2:25:15] believes in God so that's what make him
[2:25:17] righteous we are not righteous with
[2:25:21] ourself
[2:25:22] within ourself we are righteous through
[2:25:25] Jesus Christ
[2:25:27] I cannot be Sanctified within myself I
[2:25:32] am Sanctified through Jesus Christ who
[2:25:34] stands in the presence of God

[2:25:57] mind in myself uh you know no we we have
[2:26:00] to be looking to our sacrifice

[2:26:06] that uh that is standing in the presence
[2:26:08] of God for us
[2:26:12] praise the Lord
[2:26:17] it is in my Holiness it's his Holiness
[2:26:19] my Holiness won't work at all but he's
[2:26:22] done because God God don't accepted him
[2:26:26] amen praise the Lord
[2:26:29] Hallelujah
[2:26:31] and in accepting he he had to accept me
[2:26:37] praise the Lord
[2:26:38] Hallelujah
[2:26:41] God did not accept Abel before his
[2:26:44] sacrifice
[2:26:46] Abel was accepted in his sacrifice
[2:26:50] praise the Lord
[2:26:52] amen
[2:26:54] we are made accepted in the Beloved
[2:26:56] that's what Paul says
[2:26:59] that's what makes it real isn't it then
[2:27:03] we don't have to depend on ourselves now
[2:27:07] that doesn't make us says we can sin
[2:27:10] brother if you sin you just you are just
[2:27:14] away from God that's all there is only
[2:27:17] one thing to do is confess it and get
[2:27:20] right get right with God as long as you
[2:27:24] desire to sin the desire of sin is still
[2:27:28] in your heart then it's time to stay
[2:27:31] down other altar till that thing is
[2:27:35] taken out of you
[2:27:37] praise the Lord so you see this net it's
[2:27:40] not making excuses here for weaknesses
[2:27:43] amen is giving it you you have a work to
[2:27:47] do you have to give it to him you have
[2:27:49] to surround it to him you have to
[2:27:51] surround those weaknesses those
[2:27:53] challenges to God and say let your
[2:27:56] strength be made perfect in my weakness
[2:27:59] praise the Lord now see how brother
[2:28:02] Brown did with this year he says as long
[2:28:04] as you desire to sin the desired of sin
[2:28:07] is in your heart he says then it's time
[2:28:09] to sit down at the altar
[2:28:12] till that thing is taken out now
[2:28:15] now you will sing
[2:28:18] you are bound to sin cause you just
[2:28:21] can't help it but not willful thing
[2:28:26] amen
[2:28:28] now willful sin
[2:28:30] what does that willfulness comes it tied
[2:28:33] to the desire
[2:28:35] amen a tie told the desire
[2:28:40] your sin you make mistakes
[2:28:43] praise the Lord
[2:28:45] amen you can't control the task that
[2:28:47] comes to your mind and the ones that
[2:28:49] don't comes to your mind
[2:28:51] praise the Lord
[2:28:53] Hallelujah sometimes you can't control
[2:28:56] the things that pass up on your phone
[2:28:57] but you have the willpower in you to get
[2:29:00] away from it
[2:29:04] praise the Lord you have the willpower
[2:29:07] to get away from it
[2:29:13] now when you go looking for it then
[2:29:16] which means there is something in you
[2:29:18] that is hungering fulfilled
[2:29:23] then that is that desire now you have to
[2:29:26] bring under the altar
[2:29:31] it's that place you have to say God burn
[2:29:33] this thing out of me
[2:29:37] and you got to hit it
[2:29:39] you got to get to the place where you
[2:29:41] hate it you are angry
[2:29:43] that is ruining your life is rubbing
[2:29:46] your mind
[2:29:48] it's taking your time
[2:29:50] you will sin you are bound to accurs you
[2:29:53] just can't help it but now well for he
[2:29:56] that sinned willfully after receiving
[2:29:58] the knowledge of the truth they remitted
[2:30:00] no more sacrifice but every day you are
[2:30:04] bound to sin
[2:30:06] you see the balance that he's bringing
[2:30:08] every day
[2:30:10] every day every day
[2:30:14] you will have one challenge or another
[2:30:17] if it is not what you hear is what comes
[2:30:20] to your mind if not is maybe there's
[2:30:21] something you said out of your mouth
[2:30:28] and you are bound to backslide
[2:30:30] constantly so it takes a constant prayer
[2:30:33] to God Paul says I Die daily and if poor
[2:30:37] had to Die daily how much more
[2:30:40] I'm going to have to stay there Dead all
[2:30:43] the time now that I would die let me
[2:30:45] stay there dead I don't even want to
[2:30:47] wake up
[2:30:49] if Paul had to die to stay right with
[2:30:53] God so we all have to do that
[2:30:58] just die out to yourself
[2:31:01] and that's getting and that's getting
[2:31:04] God's that's getting God's will now he
[2:31:07] says there is two will two ways to
[2:31:10] anything I want to read this in that
[2:31:12] close that's the right word and the
[2:31:14] wrong way
[2:31:16] and then and then ways are you your ways
[2:31:20] in God's way
[2:31:21] and you can be in your way in God's way
[2:31:24] at the same time
[2:31:27] you can be in your wedding God's way at
[2:31:29] the same time
[2:31:31] you have got to get out of your own way
[2:31:34] to get into God's way
[2:31:37] for as long as you are in your own way
[2:31:41] you are out of his way
[2:31:43] I love how he closed this he said
[2:31:46] so forsake your way forsake your
[2:31:49] thoughts forsake everything and just
[2:31:53] rely on one thing thus say the Lord what
[2:31:56] does God say the Lord the word
[2:31:59] the word is don't say the Lord
[2:32:03] bring it back to the word
[2:32:04] amen bring it back to the word don't
[2:32:07] make it to Faith
[2:32:09] if it Faith you will know the word is
[2:32:11] faded
[2:32:12] bring it back to the word
[2:32:19] praise the Lord
[2:32:22] if something in you that is condemning
[2:32:24] you to do that then leave it
[2:32:26] it's wrong
[2:32:28] because you will never believe yourself
[2:32:30] in that way
[2:32:32] you will never believe yourself
[2:32:35] God wants you to believe him
[2:32:39] amen
[2:32:41] Jesus said
[2:32:44] if you don't believe me believe the
[2:32:46] works
[2:32:48] God wants you to believe him
[2:32:52] and after we have believed him we must
[2:32:54] believe what his grace is doing in our
[2:32:57] life it brings us to the place for us to

[2:36:19] but Christ got to us
[2:36:23] before he even tempted

[2:36:28] so you will realize that
[2:36:31] we are not like Eve before even

[2:36:46] praise the Lord
[2:36:47] it says that's when you start Gathering
[2:36:49] things in your subconscious
[2:36:54] but where Prophet God will says when
[2:36:56] when you were born he says God slip that
[2:37:00] seed just like a body
[2:37:03] at your first birth

[2:38:29] we're going to talk about Imperial
[2:38:31] righteousness
[2:38:32] praise the Lord because I I believe God
[2:38:34] is saying this bride
[2:38:36] is righteous and I because he is the
[2:38:39] expression of my righteousness
[2:38:42] I became sin for her
[2:38:44] and she became
[2:38:47] my very righteousness
