[1:02:45] try to finish soon amen praise the Lord
[1:02:48] so that's a little quoti for myself but
[1:02:52] this morning I want to speak on uh the
[1:02:54] thought of a man sent from
[1:02:57] God I want to speak on the thought a man
[1:03:01] sent from God praise the Lord I want to
[1:03:05] speak on the top a man sent from God I
[1:03:09] was I was I was meditating this morning
[1:03:12] I woke up around
[1:03:13] 4:00 and uh just keeping my heart before
[1:03:16] the Lord and and saying Lord uh uh I
[1:03:20] cannot be any help to your people until
[1:03:23] you you uh you speak to me
[1:03:26] and I was thinking because we've been
[1:03:28] we've been going in uh in uh taking a
[1:03:31] trip year with what is man that God is
[1:03:35] mindful of him amen and the son of man
[1:03:39] that God visited him and we were looking
[1:03:42] at a different kind of visitation our
[1:03:44] Salvation is a visitation it's a DAT of
[1:03:47] the Lord God visit us amen the baptism
[1:03:50] of the Holy Ghost is a visitation you
[1:03:53] know uh uh uh it's it's it's some of
[1:03:55] those uh kind of a visitation where the
[1:03:58] father feels comfortable and he comes
[1:04:00] and stay praise the Lord healing is a
[1:04:04] visitation and different things we were
[1:04:06] looking at uh uh and then so we we keep
[1:04:09] looking at this this subject with with
[1:04:12] man and and what is man that God is
[1:04:15] mindful of
[1:04:17] him so this morning we want to look at a
[1:04:20] thought a man sent from
[1:04:23] God praise the Lord
[1:04:26] a man sent from God but before I get
[1:04:29] into my subject I will I will I would
[1:04:33] like us to read Genesis 4 verse
[1:04:38] 1 Genesis 4 verse1 there is a similar
[1:04:43] statement that is made by Eve when King
[1:04:47] was
[1:04:50] born and we want to look at that closely
[1:04:53] we want to look at that a little bit
[1:04:55] critical this morning through the eye of
[1:04:57] a
[1:05:03] prophet praise the Lord Genesis
[1:05:07] 4:1 the Bible says and and Adam knew his
[1:05:12] wife and she conceived and bear King and
[1:05:17] said I have gotten a man from the Lord
[1:05:22] am
[1:05:24] amen e
[1:05:27] is confessing I have gotten a man from
[1:05:30] the Lord praise the
[1:05:33] Lord and uh
[1:05:36] uh and we see that John on the
[1:05:40] inspiration of the Holy Ghost he's
[1:05:42] talking about a man sent from
[1:05:46] God praise the Lord
[1:05:50] amen but I want us to study uh Eve
[1:05:54] confession a little bit before we get
[1:05:56] into our subject if we don't get there
[1:05:58] then it give me another opportunity to
[1:06:01] continue but we let's look at Eve
[1:06:03] confession a little
[1:06:05] bit and uh uh uh she got a son and she
[1:06:10] said I have gotten a man from the Lord
[1:06:15] praise the Lord which of course that is
[1:06:18] an Earnest
[1:06:20] confession that
[1:06:22] is uh uh a truth confession because
[1:06:26] every life comes from
[1:06:28] God are we together am amen every life
[1:06:34] comes from God so Eve was truth about
[1:06:38] her confession she have gotten a man
[1:06:41] from the
[1:06:42] Lord
[1:06:44] hallelujah but let's look at it a little
[1:06:47] bit critical let's let's let's uh uh
[1:06:50] because looking at a critical will help
[1:06:53] us to be able to understand what John
[1:06:56] meant when he says what uh uh uh uh uh
[1:07:00] when he says uh a man sent from God
[1:07:04] praise the Lord John the apostles were
[1:07:07] talking about John the Baptist he was
[1:07:10] referring to John the Baptist as a man
[1:07:14] sent from God so we want to look at uh
[1:07:18] Eve confession
[1:07:21] closely let's let's uh let's take one of
[1:07:23] our our our reading Year from the semar
[1:07:27] church
[1:07:29] age praise the Lord are we
[1:07:33] together amen it starts with this
[1:07:37] comment when the church gets away from
[1:07:39] the word it will believe
[1:07:43] anything praise the Lord Wednesday night
[1:07:46] we were talking about uh uh uh a little
[1:07:50] talk about uh uh staying you know uh uh
[1:07:55] with the
[1:07:56] word
[1:07:59] amen coming subject bringing ourself
[1:08:03] subject to the word because we realize
[1:08:06] that was the difference between Christ
[1:08:09] as a son and we as a son he came
[1:08:12] directly uh and and we bypass our tiop
[1:08:16] so until we can get to the full body of
[1:08:19] the word we have to fight we have to
[1:08:21] struggle every day to bring ourself in
[1:08:24] subjection to the word that's what the
[1:08:27] Christian life is all
[1:08:29] about praise the Lord that's what the
[1:08:33] Christian life is all about is you
[1:08:35] bringing that's your part of redemption
[1:08:38] Jesus have paid the price amen he had
[1:08:42] paid the price on the cross of Calvary
[1:08:45] he spilled his blood and and as as a
[1:08:48] price for our sin our our part of
[1:08:51] redemption now is to submit ourself to
[1:08:54] God whereby we can be able to bring our
[1:08:58] body bring our thoughts bring our desire
[1:09:01] bring our tongue bring every fiber of
[1:09:04] our body subject to the Holy Ghost
[1:09:08] amen praise the
[1:09:10] Lord H Allelujah amen that's our
[1:09:14] Christian
[1:09:16] responsibility
[1:09:18] amen now so we were talking about that
[1:09:21] and so this morning we are still going
[1:09:24] in that same light of bringing ourselves
[1:09:26] subject to the word so we want to talk
[1:09:29] about staying with the word staying with
[1:09:31] the word so brother Bram used that and
[1:09:33] address address uh uh what we are going
[1:09:36] into and says when the church gets away
[1:09:40] from the
[1:09:41] word it will believe anything when a man
[1:09:45] gets away from the word he will believe
[1:09:48] anything when a woman gets away from the
[1:09:51] word she will believe anything when a
[1:09:54] family gets away from the word they will
[1:09:56] believe anything when a nation get away
[1:09:59] from the word they will believe anything
[1:10:03] hallelujah amen when the church gets
[1:10:07] away from the word it will believe
[1:10:09] anything see how he goes to explain this
[1:10:12] he says it is like Eve when King was
[1:10:15] born she said I have gotten a man from
[1:10:18] the Lord now do you realize that she
[1:10:23] really meant that
[1:10:25] she really meant that King was a man
[1:10:29] from the
[1:10:31] Lord praise the Lord he goes he says uh
[1:10:35] she thought that she had a man from the
[1:10:38] Lord you see once she had been deceived
[1:10:42] by taking the word of Satan instead of
[1:10:45] the word of God she then taught that
[1:10:50] whatever she said was
[1:10:53] right amen now you have to go back to
[1:10:57] she and Satan conversation he said to
[1:11:00] her that you will be like
[1:11:02] God Amen you will be like God you will
[1:11:06] know right and
[1:11:09] wrong are we together
[1:11:13] amen so you can look at the the the the
[1:11:17] the conversation in in the do away he
[1:11:21] was a man from God because God is the
[1:11:23] one that gave life amen amen he's the
[1:11:27] one that gave life so he was a man from
[1:11:31] God but when you actually look at the
[1:11:34] statement from her you will see that
[1:11:37] she's speaking out of deception she has
[1:11:40] St her deception to be
[1:11:45] truth are we
[1:11:47] together are you seeing what I'm going
[1:11:49] with this amen if you have not yet just
[1:11:53] stay with me you will get it praise
[1:11:55] praise the Lord let's go on a little bit
[1:11:57] she thought that she had a man from the
[1:11:59] Lord you see once she had once she had
[1:12:04] been deceived by taking the word of
[1:12:06] Satan instead of the word of God she
[1:12:09] then taught that
[1:12:11] whatever she said was right you know
[1:12:14] it's it's it's the place of speaking
[1:12:17] lies until the lies become truth a
[1:12:20] person believing
[1:12:22] lies until they faction it in their mind
[1:12:26] that it is
[1:12:29] truth praise the
[1:12:31] Lord and they can lay their head on
[1:12:34] chopping B for the lie when it is a
[1:12:39] lie are we
[1:12:45] together you see once she has she has
[1:12:49] been deceived by taking the word of
[1:12:51] Satan instead of the word of God then
[1:12:54] she thought that what whatever she said
[1:12:56] was right if she said that she had a man
[1:13:00] from God then she had a man from
[1:13:03] God but God has set laws in the universe
[1:13:10] every seed will bring forth of It
[1:13:14] kind that's Genesis
[1:13:16] 1:11 God said that Lord in the universe
[1:13:20] before he even manifested Adam and
[1:13:23] Eve it was a law that was in the
[1:13:26] universe that whatever you saw you will
[1:13:28] reap that's right are we
[1:13:35] together now so no matter what you
[1:13:37] believe it does not change God's
[1:13:40] law God's law was in the universe before
[1:13:43] you were
[1:13:45] born before we came to the Earth he set
[1:13:48] a law that every seed will bring for of
[1:13:51] his
[1:13:52] kind so no matter what she's believing
[1:13:55] year it will not change the Lord of God
[1:13:58] now we will realize that that's the
[1:14:00] reason why every man will be a liar and
[1:14:04] God's word will be
[1:14:10] truth are we together
[1:14:27] God has set laws in his Universe a good
[1:14:31] sea can only bring forth good fruit and
[1:14:34] the evil seed can bring forth only evil
[1:14:40] fruit praise the Lord amen
[1:14:44] amen uh you know it's it's simple I I I
[1:14:47] don't want to go into uh you know
[1:14:49] teaching on the sepen SE this morning
[1:14:51] but it should be very
[1:14:55] easy for us to understand God made Man
[1:14:58] In His Image he made Adam and Eve in His
[1:15:01] image they came directly from God like
[1:15:03] we said on the on the uh Wednesday night
[1:15:07] Adam was now born of a woman so he don't
[1:15:09] have a neighbor because that is our
[1:15:12] Connecting Point with our mother praise
[1:15:14] the Lord his toes were stuck in the
[1:15:17] earth God made him upright and when God
[1:15:20] breath in his nostril like I like to
[1:15:22] demonstrate he just shook his toes of
[1:15:25] the earth and on his way he started to
[1:15:28] go praise the Lord amen now so uh uh uh
[1:15:33] he came right from the hands of God he
[1:15:35] came right as a product from God and uh
[1:15:39] uh uh uh we know Genesis 3 uh sin has
[1:15:43] been introduced and uh and then the only
[1:15:46] way that man can ever manifest anything
[1:15:50] different from what God made is that his
[1:15:53] blood has to be contaminated
[1:15:57] so whatever took place in Genesis
[1:15:59] chapter 3 had to do with
[1:16:03] blood
[1:16:05] amen it had to do with blood there is no
[1:16:07] way we we could manifest attributes of
[1:16:10] our parents until their bloodstream has
[1:16:14] run down to
[1:16:16] Us Praise the Lord so let's leave that
[1:16:19] part of the blood let's deal with what
[1:16:21] is before us yet
[1:16:22] amen now so uh I I just have to put that
[1:16:26] there in because I I I I will find my
[1:16:29] way to run back to it a good seed can
[1:16:32] only bring FR of good fruit evil seed
[1:16:34] will bring forth only evil fruit now
[1:16:37] each seed though
[1:16:38] different will uzee the same
[1:16:42] Earth the nourishment the muster the
[1:16:44] sunshine but it will bring forth after
[1:16:47] its own
[1:16:49] kind amen amen notice the history of
[1:16:53] King line notice is the history of set
[1:16:57] line only one difference between them
[1:17:00] the original SE nothing El are we
[1:17:05] together back to Eve's statement if you
[1:17:08] look at this statement of Eve re real
[1:17:12] close you will notice that she had more
[1:17:15] of an understanding than uh most
[1:17:19] realized she did not attribute it the
[1:17:22] son to sedan for that will have make him
[1:17:26] equal with
[1:17:28] God only God could create the egg the
[1:17:33] egg in the womb of Mery Satan couldn't
[1:17:36] do
[1:17:37] that Eve knew that Satan
[1:17:42] Cann Satan can own it sorry
[1:17:46] pervert so he begil her with a wrong
[1:17:50] seed it was the serent seed that brought
[1:17:52] for King it it was Adam's seed that
[1:17:56] brought through abev and
[1:17:59] SE those seeds went through exactly the
[1:18:03] same process but the children were
[1:18:05] different for they were from different
[1:18:08] seeds praise the Lord amen she believed
[1:18:12] that King was from God she accepted the
[1:18:15] devil lied as a truth of God that is
[1:18:19] exactly what she that is exactly what we
[1:18:24] have now
[1:18:25] churches set themselves up as a fountain
[1:18:28] of truth but the truth is not in them
[1:18:33] yet their begotten children swear by
[1:18:36] them and will even kill to uphold their
[1:18:41] errors praise the Lord
[1:18:44] amen if we realize that every one of us
[1:18:48] here in this in this uh in this building
[1:18:51] this morning that this B that you are
[1:18:53] sitting in was breeded
[1:18:56] by by the
[1:18:58] devil praise the Lord amen if we realize
[1:19:04] there this morning and if God can just
[1:19:06] help us to to uh to to come to the place
[1:19:10] of of understanding that uh as long as
[1:19:14] we we we stayed in this life we will get
[1:19:17] headache we will get sickness we will
[1:19:19] get trouble we will feel discouraged we
[1:19:21] will get S and uh we will go through
[1:19:25] different faces of life because this
[1:19:27] body is not perfect amen this body is a
[1:19:30] product of the original sin amen are we
[1:19:35] together praise the Lord that's the
[1:19:37] reason why God will have to send a man
[1:19:41] from the presence of the Lord amen a man
[1:19:44] will have to come from from the presence
[1:19:46] of God for you and uh and for you and
[1:19:49] for me praise the Lord amen so let's
[1:19:51] let's just let's just travel a little
[1:19:53] bit but you see what we have to realize
[1:19:55] here is that no matter what uh family
[1:19:59] you were born in whether you were born
[1:20:01] in holy well or whether you were born
[1:20:03] and you never knew your father or you
[1:20:05] never knew your mother and no matter
[1:20:08] what the state of your life is we we
[1:20:11] will have to realize that uh uh uh even
[1:20:14] if you were born in the church and uh
[1:20:16] and and you know uh like like uh we like
[1:20:19] to say to you know we were born in the
[1:20:22] message and all of that and uh uh you
[1:20:26] don't want to you don't want to take
[1:20:28] that to your head you don't want to take
[1:20:31] that as an absolute you don't want to
[1:20:33] take your natural birth as an absolute
[1:20:37] you don't want to take the St of your
[1:20:39] natural birth you know whether which
[1:20:41] country you were born in which hospital
[1:20:43] you were born in which city you were
[1:20:45] born you never want to take that as an
[1:20:48] absolute because no matter where you
[1:20:51] were born we have to know that every B
[1:20:54] every bir birth is a mess it all goes
[1:20:57] back to Genesis chapter 3 it all goes
[1:21:00] back to the fall in the
[1:21:02] beginning are we
[1:21:04] together
[1:21:10] Amen Let me take something here from
[1:21:12] power of transformation and then I will
[1:21:14] go back to what we were
[1:21:17] reading I can brag on my birth now I
[1:21:20] can't break on my first birth there is
[1:21:23] nothing
[1:21:25] I'm ashamed of that but I'm not ashamed
[1:21:29] of my second birth no no I'm not ashamed
[1:21:32] of my second
[1:21:34] birth amen how did he do it by the
[1:21:38] watching of the word by the word amen
[1:21:41] True True predestinated Believers stay
[1:21:44] with the word and and they won't pervert
[1:21:48] it it can be perverted amen praise the
[1:21:52] Lord amen so we know our second birth
[1:21:55] comes by the word
[1:21:57] Incorruptible praise the Lord the sea
[1:22:00] Incorruptible which is the word of God
[1:22:02] so let's go back to there the reason why
[1:22:05] I I I want to dwell on this a little bit
[1:22:07] is because we have you have to realize
[1:22:11] there is deception that is lying in the
[1:22:13] cells of this
[1:22:16] body praise the Lord it was born on lies
[1:22:20] it was born out of
[1:22:22] deception amen
[1:22:25] amen you can have a good meal after
[1:22:28] church today and and you just feel so F
[1:22:31] before the night up you open in the
[1:22:33] refrigerator to find something to
[1:22:36] drink
[1:22:43] amen you can feel fine toight and uh
[1:22:46] feel like uh you are flying with wains
[1:22:49] over the word and tomorrow you on a
[1:22:51] blanket shaking like uh you are plug to
[1:22:54] an electric
[1:22:57] Port are we
[1:22:59] together so you have to realize that
[1:23:03] uh something
[1:23:06] happened Adam and Eve fell from a holy
[1:23:10] Veil they fell from a
[1:23:14] state and when she fell from that
[1:23:19] place into the state that she found
[1:23:21] herself now she she she she turned to
[1:23:25] find some way of
[1:23:27] comfort because all that they ever knew
[1:23:30] was going down in Eden and
[1:23:32] fellowshipping with God God coming down
[1:23:34] and communion with them and and I mean
[1:23:36] that I mean even before Adam would say
[1:23:39] some things to her she will pick up his
[1:23:41] thought and say well there I know you
[1:23:42] want this to be done I will get it done
[1:23:44] I mean she was co-equal with
[1:23:48] Adam are we
[1:23:50] together they were all in that image of
[1:23:53] God that God created him that image
[1:23:56] which is the word they were under the
[1:23:58] protection of the word but when she fell
[1:24:01] from there she fell from there she still
[1:24:05] tried to believe that everything that
[1:24:08] she's doing now it was stay as
[1:24:12] them praise the
[1:24:15] Lord that's why sometimes people
[1:24:17] struggle with with accepting their age
[1:24:19] struggle with the changes in their body
[1:24:22] struggle with different thing because
[1:24:23] you get in one state you get used to
[1:24:26] that state when changes are coming you
[1:24:28] you you want to always be like
[1:24:33] this so in her mind she could now fully
[1:24:37] perceive the effect of the
[1:24:39] Fall she could she could not fully
[1:24:43] perceive that things is no longer the
[1:24:49] same praise the Lord
[1:24:57] that's what brother Brandon started this
[1:25:00] wave when the church when a man or the
[1:25:05] woman get away from the word they will
[1:25:08] believe anything and live comfortably in
[1:25:14] it people that have grown under the sacr
[1:25:18] of
[1:25:19] Truth they have lived and experienced
[1:25:22] the supernatural of God when when they
[1:25:24] get away from the word they can believe
[1:25:26] anything and live comfortably in it
[1:25:30] that's
[1:25:31] right
[1:25:36] amen may God give us Grace to stay with
[1:25:38] the
[1:25:39] word and whatever it
[1:25:42] takes for my will to
[1:25:48] break that's what I will be willing to
[1:25:51] do because because we have to realize
[1:25:55] there's a spirit promise of this age the
[1:25:57] spirit of strong
[1:25:59] delusion that the people will believe a
[1:26:02] lie for the truth it's a spirit of this
[1:26:05] age why because we're going right back
[1:26:07] to Eden we are just on the junction The
[1:26:10] Same Spirit that was right there in Eden
[1:26:12] a strong delusion that this woman will
[1:26:16] believe that she has
[1:26:19] received a child from the
[1:26:23] Lord praise the Lord
[1:26:30] amen are we together
[1:26:40] am and he says that's that's exactly
[1:26:43] what we have now churches set themselves
[1:26:46] up as a fountain of
[1:26:48] truth but the truth is not in them yet
[1:26:52] they are begotten children swear by them
[1:26:55] praise the
[1:26:57] Lord
[1:27:00] amen we we we we read to you before show
[1:27:03] you right in the word is the word that
[1:27:06] comes predestinated I will show you
[1:27:08] there also as as we will look uh uh uh
[1:27:12] in the
[1:27:14] word and uh you see so we we see all of
[1:27:18] those things even in in the age where we
[1:27:20] have many of our you know uh uh
[1:27:23] believing parents trusting God for their
[1:27:26] children calling to God for their
[1:27:28] children and uh believing claiming you
[1:27:30] know applying the token for their
[1:27:32] children you have to believe it amen you
[1:27:36] have to believe it brother bam says am I
[1:27:38] go before you or am I come after you
[1:27:41] amen but you have to believe that God is
[1:27:43] going to hear your prayer amen you have
[1:27:46] to believe that Lord I I I I plac that
[1:27:48] child I I dedicated him uh uh to you on
[1:27:52] the eighth day I circumcised him just
[1:27:54] like jacobe did and and and and I give
[1:27:57] him to dedication and and and and Lord
[1:28:00] father you know he's he's he's on the N
[1:28:03] River I believe that in the midst of all
[1:28:07] the the the arig gillers you will keep
[1:28:09] him safe you will keep her safe we have
[1:28:12] to believe that but another thing I want
[1:28:15] to bring to you is that uh uh uh we we
[1:28:18] we didn't give birth to direct uh uh uh
[1:28:23] uh sons and daughters of
[1:28:27] God they have to be born
[1:28:29] again our children don't come from our
[1:28:32] war as as as Christians as
[1:28:35] believers they were born in sin shaped
[1:28:38] in iniquity praise the Lord they came to
[1:28:42] the Earth speaking
[1:28:44] lies and God has to meet them they have
[1:28:48] to have an experience with God they have
[1:28:50] to be born again praise the Lord they
[1:28:53] cannot just go on the testimony of Mommy
[1:28:56] and Daddy they have to have their own
[1:28:58] experience with
[1:29:01] God praise the
[1:29:03] Lord even though when they are born you
[1:29:06] know they look so
[1:29:09] cute they look just like a like like an
[1:29:13] angel so
[1:29:17] precious wish they could just stay that
[1:29:20] way all the days of their life
[1:29:24] then there will be no much trouble just
[1:29:27] feed them change their diapers that's
[1:29:29] all praise the
[1:29:32] Lord amen but when they start
[1:29:36] growing and uh uh then they have to go
[1:29:41] to the
[1:29:42] mountain just like Jesus went to the
[1:29:44] mountain and he was tempted of the devil
[1:29:48] amen they have they have to go to their
[1:29:51] higher Peck and their lowest point
[1:29:57] are we
[1:29:59] together so my my emphasis here is there
[1:30:03] just to see how when the person leave
[1:30:06] the
[1:30:07] word and hold on to something that is
[1:30:10] not the
[1:30:11] word how soon if God don't help that man
[1:30:15] or that woman they can start believing
[1:30:18] there to be truth and brother Bram says
[1:30:20] they are even ready to die for it or
[1:30:23] kill you for it
[1:30:27] praise the
[1:30:28] Lord with all the manifestation all the
[1:30:31] Miracles that the Pharisees saw in the
[1:30:34] life of our Lord Jesus Christ it says
[1:30:37] now for the Miracles and the good work
[1:30:39] that he's done we are crucifying but he
[1:30:42] being man call himself
[1:30:45] God they were they were ready to kill
[1:30:48] for
[1:30:50] it so that is something that we we we
[1:30:53] have to what
[1:30:56] amen we see those things happening
[1:30:58] around our ranks people that have
[1:31:01] preached this message over 40 years and
[1:31:03] and and and and and and you know just
[1:31:06] just young men and God blessed them with
[1:31:08] with with good wives and God blessed
[1:31:11] them their children came up right and
[1:31:13] and all of that they are walking away
[1:31:15] from the truth and and and and and they
[1:31:17] are beli in something praise the Lord
[1:31:22] amen that now the believe to be a
[1:31:25] truth and the thing that has made the
[1:31:28] cord of their life they are fighting
[1:31:30] against
[1:31:31] it that's how dangerous this is that's
[1:31:35] how serious it
[1:31:40] is praise the Lord amen how a person can
[1:31:43] believe a
[1:31:45] lie do you see how important for us to
[1:31:49] bring every thought of our mind back to
[1:31:53] the word every feeling of our body back
[1:31:56] to the
[1:31:59] word praise the Lord
[1:32:02] amen because if you don't bring your
[1:32:05] feeling back to the word the devil can
[1:32:07] make you to believe that you are not
[1:32:11] healed he will he will make you believe
[1:32:13] that was just a sensation you are not
[1:32:15] healed see how you are feeling if you
[1:32:17] were healed why are you feeling that way
[1:32:19] right praise the Lord if you don't bring
[1:32:22] your TS back to the word he can guess
[1:32:24] right there in your mind just like he
[1:32:26] did to our lord Jesus if you be the Son
[1:32:29] of God turn these stones into
[1:32:34] bread how important for us to bring
[1:32:38] every desire of our body back to the
[1:32:43] word is this thing pleasing to
[1:32:48] God praise the
[1:32:50] Lord because pray to on he can make that
[1:32:57] feeling a
[1:32:59] habit amen and he can he can he can
[1:33:03] justify
[1:33:04] it bring a lot of thoughts around your
[1:33:07] mind and and tell you why it's good for
[1:33:09] you to for you to be that
[1:33:15] way praise the
[1:33:17] Lord are we together
[1:33:24] for if you think
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:30] that let me just let me just Dru to the
[1:33:33] other ones realize I could stay on this
[1:33:35] and spend a lot of time here when the
[1:33:37] church allow herself to move away from
[1:33:40] the original like Adam and Eve death set
[1:33:44] in there is no strength in her she she
[1:33:49] has become uh monos headed the meaning
[1:33:53] that the church moved to moved towards
[1:33:56] form and ceremony and towards pries who
[1:34:00] by organizing the ministers into a group
[1:34:02] that desire leadership apart from the
[1:34:05] Holy Spirit and his word that very
[1:34:08] moment death
[1:34:10] enter and she and and and she's and she
[1:34:15] started to get
[1:34:19] sick it was just one word thou shall not
[1:34:23] not
[1:34:25] die when Eve stopped and reason with
[1:34:29] that one statement death set
[1:34:34] in Praise the
[1:34:37] Lord and she never knew she was
[1:34:41] died she never knew that she was getting
[1:34:44] away from God that she would get to the
[1:34:47] place to called a seent seed a man sent
[1:34:50] from
[1:34:52] God she never knew that she would go to
[1:34:55] that
[1:34:59] far are we
[1:35:03] together death set
[1:35:06] in the moment the church gets
[1:35:10] away from the
[1:35:12] word and starts to introduce things to
[1:35:15] make the people happy introduce things
[1:35:18] to to be like other churches
[1:35:28] that's why we should stay with the
[1:35:32] word to the best of our knowledge and
[1:35:34] the best of our ability are we
[1:35:49] together let me get down here you temper
[1:35:52] with God and you you will reap exactly
[1:35:55] what you
[1:35:56] injected man ought to learn that from
[1:36:00] nature you temple with
[1:36:03] nature he has injected his own idea into
[1:36:07] nature and and rearranged the molecules
[1:36:10] Etc and now he's reaping the wh wi just
[1:36:14] look how they have breathed the
[1:36:18] chicken it is so highly breeded that it
[1:36:22] is the laying machine that that that
[1:36:26] that that lay it
[1:36:29] out it is no good for food and so soft
[1:36:33] and poor to
[1:36:36] eat they injected substance into the
[1:36:39] meat we eat and because of that the
[1:36:42] human body is changing so that uh that
[1:36:47] uh uh we me I getting narrow and all of
[1:36:49] that but what what actually he's trying
[1:36:51] to tell us is that
[1:36:55] just the
[1:36:57] danger in tempering with the law of
[1:37:03] God because those law were placed there
[1:37:06] that was the first Bible the law were
[1:37:08] placed in the
[1:37:11] universe before man
[1:37:15] came and when we can see all of these
[1:37:17] results of things that are happening
[1:37:19] around us and and and uh the you know uh
[1:37:23] the all of these hybrid things how much
[1:37:25] more about the word of
[1:37:31] God when men shall not live by bread
[1:37:34] alone but by every word that comes from
[1:37:37] the mouth of God like brother brandham
[1:37:38] says he says that you go to a restaurant
[1:37:41] if they ever should bring you a soup and
[1:37:43] you see a fly in
[1:37:46] it man you will take your your your your
[1:37:49] phone and and and call the uh uh one
[1:37:52] agency and to that whole
[1:37:55] restaurant but yet people will not pay
[1:37:57] attention to what their soul is feeding
[1:38:01] on we can be so conscious about the
[1:38:04] things we put in our
[1:38:07] mouth but man will care they will care
[1:38:10] nothing about what their soul fees on

[1:38:18] way churches are yeah yeah yeah

[1:38:41] church don't get carried away with the
[1:38:44] emotion of the preacher sit there and

[1:39:03] together she believe it she believe
[1:39:09] it a way for her to escape with her
[1:39:12] guilt of what she did wrong is to
[1:39:15] believe a
[1:39:19] lie in that way she can get away with
[1:39:22] her guilt
[1:39:23] and go and live on I have received a man
[1:39:27] from the
[1:39:30] Lord praise the Lord is that now saying
[1:39:34] Amen to the devil gospel because he said
[1:39:36] you will be just like God you will know
[1:39:39] right and wrong so if she's censuring it
[1:39:41] which means she censuring it it was
[1:39:43] right it was good that I did this
[1:39:55] are we
[1:40:02] together no
[1:40:06] remorse no place of
[1:40:10] repentance praise the Lord amen that
[1:40:14] prophet of God told us uh you know what
[1:40:17] uh uh uh the the the the blessings of
[1:40:20] wealth and material thing is is is no
[1:40:22] sign of God's
[1:40:24] approv neither the denial of it if you
[1:40:28] don't have it is also not a sign what is
[1:40:30] the sign of God approv is his
[1:40:33] word is finding ourself in the word of
[1:40:37] God in the word of
[1:40:47] God a man sent from
[1:40:51] God so I will get back to to my to my
[1:40:54] subject now I just wanted to lay this
[1:40:57] out
[1:40:59] because Eve the mother of all
[1:41:03] living she said she received a man from
[1:41:07] the Lord when actually it was a SE
[1:41:10] seed that was not God
[1:41:15] creation amen it was the devil h h h
[1:41:19] breathing something
[1:41:23] are we
[1:41:25] together now watch this now back to St
[1:41:28] John chapter 1 let's go back there we
[1:41:31] will travel a little bit here
[1:41:35] hallelujah are we
[1:41:38] together
[1:41:44] amen John started to talk here and he
[1:41:47] brought this great introduction talking
[1:41:49] about in the beginning was the word he
[1:41:51] went right back to Genesis went back
[1:41:53] back to the beginning of creation the
[1:41:55] world was with God the world was God the
[1:41:57] same was in the beginning with God
[1:42:00] praise the Lord then verse six he
[1:42:03] introduced something and he says there
[1:42:06] was a man sent from
[1:42:09] God whose name was
[1:42:13] John the same came forth to Bear witness
[1:42:17] of the light that all men through him
[1:42:21] might believe
[1:42:23] glory be to God Amen let's go back to
[1:42:26] Luke chap 1 and we can go and look at
[1:42:30] the birth of John the
[1:42:37] Baptist
[1:42:38] amen we can go back and look at the
[1:42:41] birth of John the Baptist you will see
[1:42:43] that when John was born that Zachariah
[1:42:47] his father being a righteous man he was
[1:42:50] he was uh uh uh uh uh doing his duty in
[1:42:53] in the in the Tabernacle or the temple
[1:42:56] you know blowing incense and getting the
[1:42:58] place ready for worship and prayer when
[1:43:00] the angel Gabriel met
[1:43:02] him praise the Lord the Bible say he was
[1:43:05] a just man but when the angel met him
[1:43:10] John I mean Zacharias have come to a
[1:43:13] place in his life where he think that
[1:43:16] God has blessed him he has had
[1:43:19] a a successful marriage he and Elizabeth
[1:43:22] have been together Faithfully they went
[1:43:24] over the grieving time of having
[1:43:26] children and the Lord didn't give them
[1:43:28] children and and and and he was I mean
[1:43:31] he was to the place where he was
[1:43:33] satisfied he was saying it is the word
[1:43:35] of the Lord he accepted that to be the
[1:43:37] word of the
[1:43:38] Lord that the angel of the Lord the
[1:43:41] angel the same angel that announced the
[1:43:44] coming of Christ appeared to
[1:43:47] John appeared to Zacharias and told him
[1:43:50] that he would have a son he tried to ask
[1:43:53] arue with the angel the angel said no
[1:43:55] argument you won't talk until the child
[1:43:57] is
[1:43:58] born praise the
[1:44:01] Lord
[1:44:02] hallelujah oh if God could do do that
[1:44:05] for us it would be so easy for many of
[1:44:08] us praise the Lord it will be so easy
[1:44:12] for many of
[1:44:13] us the way we argue with
[1:44:17] uh accepting God's provided way praise
[1:44:20] the Lord but what I want you to see is
[1:44:25] there even when the child was born and
[1:44:28] they were asking how would the child be
[1:44:32] named praise the Lord John knew I mean
[1:44:36] Zachariah knew an
[1:44:38] angel has witnessed his child to him
[1:44:42] praise the
[1:44:43] Lord amen amen he knew that this was an
[1:44:47] angel from the presence of the
[1:44:49] Lord that have just spoke to him because
[1:44:52] the angel said you would not speak and
[1:44:55] right there he could not cry out for
[1:44:57] anybody to hear
[1:44:59] him so he knew that he was under the
[1:45:02] hands of God but yet when the child was
[1:45:06] born in
[1:45:10] Zacharias the Bible says here
[1:45:24] verse 23 and it came to pass that as
[1:45:28] soon as the day of his ministration
[1:45:30] would
[1:45:32] accomplish let me let me drop
[1:45:37] down I know you you are very familiar
[1:45:40] with
[1:45:41] this amen so I don't want to take a lot
[1:45:44] of time on on uh uh keeping you year but
[1:45:49] let's go back a little
[1:45:51] bit let's go go back to verse 13 because
[1:45:56] there is something I want you to
[1:45:59] see but the angel said unto him fear not
[1:46:05] Zacharias for thy prayers have been
[1:46:07] heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear
[1:46:10] thee a son and thou shall call his name
[1:46:14] John and thou shall have joyed and
[1:46:17] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[1:46:21] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[1:46:25] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[1:46:30] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[1:46:33] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[1:46:36] mother's
[1:46:37] womb and many of the children of Israel
[1:46:41] shall turn to the Lord their God and he
[1:46:45] shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:46:50] the power of Lies now Malachi 3 now the
[1:46:53] reason why I want you to see this is
[1:46:55] that a man sent from the presence of the
[1:46:59] Lord but see what Zacharias what the
[1:47:02] angel is doing here to Zacharias the
[1:47:05] angel is identifying John Birth by
[1:47:11] scripture amen the angel is identifying
[1:47:16] John Birth by
[1:47:20] scripture praise the Lord amen the angel
[1:47:26] said I read that again I mean uh uh many
[1:47:30] Will Rejoice he shall be great in the
[1:47:33] sight of the
[1:47:35] Lord the child will be a great child he
[1:47:38] will be born and right from the mother's
[1:47:40] womb he will receive the Holy
[1:47:43] Ghost but all of these things that the
[1:47:46] angel is saying about this child is
[1:47:50] not ascribed to the child natural ual
[1:47:53] birth but the angel is describing
[1:47:56] putting the child in the in in the pages
[1:47:58] of God's
[1:48:00] word so what is happening is God
[1:48:03] bringing his word to
[1:48:06] pass
[1:48:07] amen what what Malachi said in Malachi
[1:48:11] chapter 3 I will send my angel before my
[1:48:13] face here is that word coming to pass
[1:48:18] amen what Isaiah said in Isaiah chapter
[1:48:21] 4 a voice of one crying in the
[1:48:24] wilderness that word is coming to pass
[1:48:27] so the angel is describing John Birth by
[1:48:31] scripture praise the
[1:48:35] Lord Eve is not describing King's Birth
[1:48:39] by scripture she's describing King's
[1:48:42] Birth by what the seent told
[1:48:44] her praise the Lord so you see two men
[1:48:48] from the presence of the Lord two men
[1:48:50] from God but with different birth their
[1:48:53] birth is described
[1:48:56] differently we are now predestinated see
[1:48:59] because of our parents' birth or our
[1:49:02] parents bringing us for we are
[1:49:04] predestinated seed because the scripture
[1:49:06] said we are predestinated seed we have
[1:49:09] find a place in the world where we can
[1:49:12] identify ourself even though we were
[1:49:14] born by our father and mother but we can
[1:49:17] look back to God's
[1:49:19] word it's not our natural birth that
[1:49:21] makes us predestined a seed it's God's
[1:49:24] thoughts it's God's breath for
[1:49:28] you because you were in his
[1:49:31] mind
[1:49:33] amen he elected
[1:49:36] you praise the Lord he choose you from
[1:49:39] the foundation of the
[1:49:41] word and he was showed and setting that
[1:49:44] nothing will stop your
[1:49:47] birth that you will be here and you will
[1:49:49] hear the voice of God for this age amen
[1:49:54] Hallelujah you go through all your
[1:49:56] struggle and trial of life but there was
[1:49:59] a promise in this word I will have a
[1:50:02] people for my name's sake that promise
[1:50:04] was hanging over your life is that
[1:50:07] promise that brought you forth amen amen
[1:50:11] even if the doctor gave the wrong
[1:50:13] medication to your mama because that
[1:50:15] promise was hanging over you nothing
[1:50:17] could have happened to
[1:50:19] you Lord praise the Lord the mama didn't
[1:50:23] have good food for me to eat or to eat I
[1:50:26] will be a a a healthy child there was a
[1:50:29] promise hanging over my
[1:50:33] life I might have come up on a tough
[1:50:36] upbringing and never had shoes to word
[1:50:38] or close perfect close to word that did
[1:50:41] not matter because God was setting that
[1:50:44] nothing will stop you until this world
[1:50:47] will breath you
[1:50:51] for then now you can become a son and
[1:50:54] daughter from the presence of God not by
[1:50:57] your natural birth but by a message that
[1:50:59] have birath
[1:51:05] you oh I want I'm making sense if you
[1:51:09] can say I'm making sense we close this
[1:51:10] whole thing cuz I'm trying to make sense
[1:51:13] and I'm trying to understand
[1:51:16] myself praise the Lord Amen brother bam
[1:51:19] said Christ is the Myster of God
[1:51:21] revealed he said pre destinator he says
[1:51:24] there's the mystery he before Christ or
[1:51:28] anything else was ever on Earth you see
[1:51:32] his great mystery that he choose the
[1:51:36] bride noring Eve who
[1:51:39] fall from thisel in the word noring
[1:51:43] there she who fall but he who choose a
[1:51:47] bride that will never fall amen that
[1:51:51] will hold to th word regardless of what
[1:51:55] all the rest of the world had to say
[1:51:57] about it praise the
[1:51:59] Lord in his mind he knew evil fall but
[1:52:04] in his mind he knew there would come a
[1:52:06] bride there will come a people that will
[1:52:09] hear the voice of the seven Angel and
[1:52:13] people that will receive a message amen
[1:52:16] praise the Lord that will reshape their
[1:52:19] life
[1:52:24] are we
[1:52:26] together it is that word that been
[1:52:29] hanging over
[1:52:30] you is that prophecy being haunting your
[1:52:35] life is being haunting your
[1:52:38] life that's the reason why we couldn't
[1:52:40] find peace we couldn't find rest and
[1:52:43] until you meet God you will never find
[1:52:45] peace you will never find the the the
[1:52:47] fullness of joy there is nothing that
[1:52:50] will bring full satisfaction to you
[1:52:53] praise the Lord
[1:52:56] amen are we together
[1:52:59] amen you can get the newest phone when
[1:53:02] the next one come out you want
[1:53:04] it praise the Lord you can get the
[1:53:07] latest vehicle when you see the other
[1:53:08] one going around on the road you want
[1:53:10] that
[1:53:15] one that's all the natural man he I mean
[1:53:18] he just on the right race and you know
[1:53:20] he's all about that but the thing that
[1:53:23] brings
[1:53:24] satisfaction to the believer the thing
[1:53:27] that brings satisfaction to a son and
[1:53:29] daughter of God is to know I'm a child
[1:53:31] of the king amen it's to know I'm a
[1:53:34] child of the
[1:53:35] king that's where I get my joy right
[1:53:40] Hallelujah when the things of Life the
[1:53:43] hle of life gets on the hle where it's
[1:53:45] tough I can live for my head and say my
[1:53:48] father have thousands of
[1:53:50] cattles amen
[1:53:53] praise the
[1:53:54] Lord I can find joy in his promises
[1:53:58] that's right
[1:54:03] amen are we together am I making
[1:54:07] sense the angel said this child is born
[1:54:12] under a promise he will be a
[1:54:17] Nazareth from the date of his
[1:54:20] birth nothing will go through his head
[1:54:23] not not our our ludicious Nazareth that
[1:54:27] we are having
[1:54:28] amen they are on a different kind of
[1:54:32] influence but he says uh uh
[1:54:38] uh praise the
[1:54:40] Lord are we together
[1:54:51] amen kind of lose lose my place okay
[1:54:54] right here he shall go
[1:54:59] before he shall go
[1:55:01] before him in the spirit and the power
[1:55:05] of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[1:55:08] father to the children and the
[1:55:11] disobedient to the wisdom and the
[1:55:15] unjust
[1:55:16] John Zacharias is standing there
[1:55:19] listening to this Angel quoting to him
[1:55:21] Malachi 3
[1:55:23] three praise the
[1:55:25] Lord amen they have read malacha 3 in
[1:55:29] the
[1:55:30] temple the priest might have commented
[1:55:33] on it and this Angel is identifying the
[1:55:36] birth of his
[1:55:39] son Zachariah s with this
[1:55:44] scripture are we
[1:55:46] together praise the
[1:55:48] Lord you see the uh uh CH and and El
[1:55:52] Bram had nothing to do with brother
[1:55:54] brandham h h h
[1:55:57] Ministry amen that is their son the the
[1:56:01] birth him in the state of life and and
[1:56:04] the household of life and all of the
[1:56:06] things that they had to go
[1:56:08] through praise the
[1:56:11] Lord the reason
[1:56:16] why we hold to his message is because we
[1:56:19] find his identity in Scripture
[1:56:22] amen praise the lord we find his
[1:56:26] identity in
[1:56:29] scripture we see here that the angel
[1:56:32] only mention one part of
[1:56:34] Malachi he spoke on Malachi 3 but then
[1:56:38] he mention one part here of uh of uh of
[1:56:41] uh uh Malachi 4 turning the heart of uh
[1:56:44] the the fathers to the children and he
[1:56:47] left the other portion of Malachi
[1:56:50] 4 praise the Lord this is an angel from
[1:56:53] the presence of the
[1:56:57] Lord so you see John being a man when
[1:57:01] when when John the Revelator or John the
[1:57:03] Divine or John the Apostle said a man
[1:57:07] sent from the presence of the Lord and
[1:57:08] his name was John he was not talking
[1:57:12] about his his his uh his natural birth
[1:57:16] he was sent from the presence of the
[1:57:18] Lord because he came on a prophecy yes
[1:57:23] there was a word that spoke about
[1:57:26] him
[1:57:29] amen so when when when we said you can
[1:57:33] say the same about uh uh uh
[1:57:36] Paul the Apostle he was a man sent from
[1:57:40] the presence of the
[1:57:42] Lord because he was a light to the
[1:57:46] Gentiles Paul was able to identify his
[1:57:49] place in Scripture
[1:57:52] he saw there was a prophecy that this
[1:57:55] light the people that sat in darkness
[1:57:57] great light was going to shine upon them
[1:58:01] so Paul went under the commission of
[1:58:03] that great light and he was able to
[1:58:06] bring great light to the
[1:58:09] Gentiles praise the Lord oh that's the
[1:58:13] thing that makes the believer
[1:58:15] powerful if they can be able to find
[1:58:18] their own importance in God's word and
[1:58:21] stand behind it amen and say This
[1:58:23] Promise is mine every promise in the
[1:58:26] book is mine am praise the Lord
[1:58:32] hallelujah I I will tell you the devil
[1:58:34] knows if you believe
[1:58:36] it he
[1:58:38] knows he knows if you believe it he
[1:58:40] knows also if you are just a
[1:58:43] bluff praise the Lord he knows because I
[1:58:47] mean he's going to tempt you everywhere
[1:58:49] he's going to slap you everywhere and
[1:58:52] and ask you do you believe it he said
[1:58:54] well I don't
[1:58:55] know praise the Lord but a man or a
[1:58:59] woman that believe in the devil can turn
[1:59:01] them upside down lay them down on a sick
[1:59:03] bed they will still lay their hands up
[1:59:05] and say Lord I believe you are my healer
[1:59:07] I believe you are my deliverer though he
[1:59:10] slay me yet I will trust
[1:59:20] you amen man sent from
[1:59:23] God praise the Lord
[1:59:26] hallelujah and I believe that there are
[1:59:29] sons and daughters that are sent from
[1:59:32] God for this age amen amen God
[1:59:36] predestinated us for this age and we are
[1:59:39] sent to represent him in this age and
[1:59:42] that's the reason why we want to stand
[1:59:44] with the word yes we want to stay on the
[1:59:47] word
[1:59:52] are we together let me read one more
[1:59:54] thing to you and and and and close this
[1:59:56] thing for for
[1:59:59] today as position of the church ages the
[2:00:02] Ephesian Church age brother Bram says
[2:00:04] but fear not little FL stay with the
[2:00:08] word keep that word between you and the
[2:00:13] devil Eve did not do that and she
[2:00:19] fell praise the Lord
[2:00:23] your amount of years serving the lord
[2:00:26] matters nothing to the
[2:00:28] devil praise the lord the devil is not
[2:00:31] afraid of the name of your church
[2:00:33] neither the name of your
[2:00:35] pastor the devil don't even afraid if
[2:00:38] you says I believe brother brandham is a
[2:00:40] prophet the devil also believe that if
[2:00:43] you don't know that amen amen he
[2:00:47] believed that William brandham was a
[2:00:48] prophet because William brandham command
[2:00:50] him and he went
[2:00:53] praise the Lord am so but it does not
[2:00:56] intimidate the devil
[2:01:01] yes what scared the devil is when you
[2:01:04] keep the
[2:01:05] word praise the Lord when you keep the
[2:01:08] word between you and
[2:01:12] him praise the
[2:01:14] Lord when we bring all our thoughts back
[2:01:17] to the word we bring our desires back to
[2:01:21] the word
[2:01:24] are we living to please ourself or are
[2:01:27] we living to please God are we striving
[2:01:29] to please
[2:01:33] God or we are just championing something
[2:01:36] of
[2:01:40] ourself oh and how the devil can make a
[2:01:43] one to believe that what they are
[2:01:46] doing they are in the word of God he did
[2:01:49] the same to
[2:01:50] Eve you say I got a man from the
