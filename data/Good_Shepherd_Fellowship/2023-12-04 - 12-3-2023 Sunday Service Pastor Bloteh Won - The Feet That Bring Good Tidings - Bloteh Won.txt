wonder God oh something go is going to happen something good is same story we are together again just praising the Lord Praise the Lord God bless you thank you brother Ariel Let's uh let's just take our Bibles and we go right into the word this morning we will read from Revelation chapter 10 sorry I'm ahead of myself a little bit Romans chapter 10 Romans chapter 10 and then we Romans chapter 10 and then we will go over to uh where we want to stud it from this morning praise the Lord Romans chapter 10 let's read from verse 11 now we have to realize there other uh a couple of weeks ago we we spoke on the message um blessing are the feet that bring up Good Tidings and I want to continue in their path this morning and uh uh so uh but uh I was talking with a brother and uh you know we were having a conversation and he asked a question so uh I will try to bring that into what we were talking what we'll be speaking on this morning so Romans chapter 10 let read the scripture from uh verse 11 and then uh we will have you to have your seat and then we can go right into what we want to share with you this morning for the scripture says whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Greeks the Jews and the Greeks all right for the same Lord over all is reach unto all that called upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen praise the Lord how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they year without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sin as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things let us pray together father we love you and we appreciate you oh God we have read your sacred word and father we know your word is of no private interpretation so we will need all the help that we came from you this morning that father Lord will be able to rightly divide the word of Truth bless your word now to our hearts oh father in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen how beautiful are the feet that preach the gospel of peace and bring it Glide Tidings now while uh it's it's uh a little bit strange for us this time of the year normally we have uh most of our visitors coming uh between June July in August when uh when when we having nice weather but it's kind of a flip for us it looks like we having more visitor at the end of the year we have brother tan speaking for us last Sunday and brother Thomas on Wednesday night next week we will have a a brother from the Congo brother Ben below me he will be passing back he will speak for us on Sunday and then the Sunday after we will have brother uh uh brother Daniel frer that's brother Jordan's father he will be around visiting with with them so he we will have him to speak for us and now uh uh I I brought this subject of how beautiful are the feet that bring It Good Tidings because of all the visitors we were having and now we having more visitors amen so I believe maybe when we keep preaching on it we will have more visitors coming praise the Lord amen but uh we love the brothers we love the gift that is in the body and uh we love the the the the diversities of ministry so we pray that each one of them will be a blessing to us but this morning as I look at this subject of how how beautiful are the feet that bringeth good tidings now we want to remember that we took uh the prophecy from uh Isaiah 52 and it was speaking about the suffering seven uh it was a prophecy of our Lord Jesus speaking about the suffering seven is is introducing Jesus Christ uh uh uh from uh from the Old Testament coming right into the atonement coming right into uh uh uh his ministry there of uh Isaiah 53 so the prophet Isaiah talking about our lord Jesus or talking about the suffering sevenant Jehovah as a suffering Sant he he he brings out that statement how beautiful are the feet that bring the Good Tidings now so when we look at that the last time we said that is a prophecy that speaks of Jesus in uh uh uh you know in his mediatory work and it also speaks of Jesus what he will be doing in his body the church praise the Lord so this morning we want to look at uh uh let's go to re ration chapter 10 I want to take my time this morning and just bring few scriptural truth to you so it will it will looks like a Bible study it will looks like a teaching but uh uh I would just want to bring uh this to you this morning and uh I pray that the Lord will make it a blessing revelation chap 10 Revelation chapter 10 is a very uh uh it's a very familiar scripture to every one of us because it holds the prophecy they have to do with uh uh the opening of the seals the revealing of the seals the seven tunder the seven Angel messenger and all and all of that but I want you to pay attention to verse two I will read I will read from verse one but uh the reason why I'm I'm going to Revelation chapter 10 because in verse two the Bible say he had a little book in his hand he set his right foot upon the seed and his left foot upon the earth now that that that of that angel we want to identify this morning in the scriptures and in the message of the hour now because uh uh uh that has to happen to also fulfill the prophecy that Paul pick up in Romans chapter 10 now it was Paul that uh we read in Romans chapter 10 when he pick up the prophecy of Isaiah how beautiful are the faith that bringeth good tidings now yet in Revelation chapter 10 here we seeing an a mighty Angel standing with one foot on the seed and one foot on the earth that has to happen for us to have the message of the hour praise the lord we we would not be sitting here believing the message of the hour or uh if God didn't move in this direction so that's what I want for us to pay attention to this morning I pray that the holy spirit will be our help let's read from Revelation chap 10 verse one praise the Lord you love the Lord [Music] amen Revelation chap 10 verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillows of fire and he had in his hands a little book and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth now I was talking with a brother uh a couple of weeks ago and uh uh we were just we were uh visiting and then uh you know uh he he asks a question he says uh uh uh when did this happen you know he was he was of The View that uh uh uh the prophecy of uh uh Revelation chap 10 really do not address the ministry of the brother Brandon so he were asking when did this happen when did we see his foot upon the sand and upon the sea so I told him I says well I mean if you if you read the scripture you go back to Revelation chapter 13 you will be able to understand when did it happen you know so we talk a little bit and uh uh uh and I I I I realized that okay I think this is a teaching problem maybe he have he have not he have not been taught that he have not seen that but while I was driving back I drove almost two hours to meet this brother and while I was driving back I kept thinking about it I said well I mean uh uh I can I can see because if uh if you are not rightly placing the scripture you will never be able to see it so I started thinking about it so uh this going week while while I was studying and I was thinking about okay I've been speaking about the Fai that bringeth good tidings then I thought I said well okay I think I should use the privilege to be able to bring this to the church uh for the benefit of those that uh uh you know have not had that understanding to be able to see it as well so let's continue to read verse two again in and uh and he had a little book he had he had in his hand a little uh book open and he set his right foot upon the seed and his left foot on the earth and with a loud voice as when a lion ruleth and when he have cried seven Thunder utter their voices and when the seven tunder had altered their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunder alth and write them net and the servant and and the angel which I saw stand upon the seed and upon the Earth lifted up his hands to heaven and swore by him that liveth forever and ever who created the Heaven and the things that are dead in the Earth and the things that are therein that are there in are and the seed and the things which are there in that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sign the mystery of God should be finish as he have declared to his servants the prophets praise the Lord amen so as we as we want to look at this together I would want us to go to Revelation chapter 13 now pay attention and I told you I would try to take my time uh I'm not a teacher by calling but uh ask your your pastor I want to take take take my time to approach this praise the Lord now so when you go to Revelation chapter 13 which of course Revelation chapter 13 is very important because it holds a very very important Prophecy of the time that we are living in and also a very important Prophecy of the nation that we are living in brother brandham says uh United States comes out in Revelation chapter 13 that's what I want for us to try to see this morning as we'll be looking at uh few scriptures and few courts praise the Lord now in Revelation chapter 13 let's read from verse one John says and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea as as I'm going with the days I will be pointing you now remember now our focus is revelation 10 verse 2 the angel have one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth praise the Lord now in Revelation chapter 13 John is saying as I stood upon the sand of the sea I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven hairs and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head the name of blasphemy praise the Lord are we together amen let's read down a little bit and the Beast which I sought was like unto a leper and his feet were as as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seed and great Authority now we will not be able to understand this until we go back to the Book of Daniel Daniel the Prophet Daniel came in such a time where God God will speak a whole lot about the Gentile dispensation praise the Lord he will speak a whole lot about the Gentile dispensation we will see as we go to Daniel chapter 7 let's turn our Bibles to Daniel chapter 7 Daniel chapter 7 praise the Lord Danel chapter 7 if you read from verse one in the first year of belzar King of Babylon Daniel had a dream and a vision of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the PSM of the matter Daniel speak and said I saw in my vision by night and behold the four wings of Heaven stro upon the Great Sea and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another and the first was like a lion and had Eagle wings and I beheld till the wings thereof was plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and uh May stand upon uh the feet as a man and a man's heart was given to it and behold another Beast a second like a bear now remember now the first be was like a lion the second is like a bear and it rise up itself as uh itself on one side and it had three rapes in uh the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise th all much flesh and after this I beheld and lo another like a lepro now when you go back to Revelation chapter 13 this Beast that that John saw praise the Lord are we there let's go back to Revelation Chapter 30 we will come back to Daniel again just just I I want you to grab the picture so um uh uh I'm not going to to to get excited I'm trying to hold my feet in my shoes praise the Lord now in Revelation chap chapter 13 that we just read John is describing this Beast that came out of the seed with uh with uh uh 10 horns and seven head he said the beach which I which I saw in verse two was like a leper and he had a feet like a bed he had a mouth like a lion now in Daniel Vision Daniel is seeing uh uh in his vision he's seeing all of these beasts that is uh he's seeing the Beast rising up as a lion having great wings like an eagle but the Beast is a lion that's that's the Beast I want you to pay attention to he's seeing another Beast that is rising like a Beed and he's seeing another Beast that is also Rising like a leper praise the Lord now there is a fourth Beast that Daniel that Daniel saw we will read that also but this fourth Beast was so mysterious that it did not had uh and identification just like the first one was like a lion and the second one was like a bear the fourth Beast was very very mysterious now let's get a background before Daniel will have these dreams you will have to remember that the King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream that troubled him and in his dream he dreamed about an image that had a head of gold and the the the the breast was like sver and uh and and and the lungs like like Browns and the feet was like iron but he when he woke up from his sleep he forgot the dream the dream troubled him praise the Lord and then he will call all the wise men of the kingom and uh and and you know and no one will give him the interpretation until Daniel would come and give him the interpretation praise the Lord amen amen and when Daniel will give him the interpretation Daniel will bring the interpretation and the the interpretation will be concerning the Gentile Kingdom the succession of the Gentile Kingdom which will start from Babylon the head of God and the the the the the m and and Persian the uh the the breast of savor and then the the Greeks which which is brow and then the Roman which is iron that is in the lead now God is giving this Prophet Daniel an interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar dream that is going to cover the span of time from the bonian kingdom to the time that we are living in Praise the Lord amen just like I said to you before there is no time you will realize that even the time that we are living in right now is more spoken of in the Bible than any any time the Bible History have ever covered are we together praise the Lord God is giving Daniel an interpretation of this King's dream to be able to show the war power what we will call superpower according to God's word the superpower that will control the Gentile kingdom is not Russia is not America and know according to God's word it is these four Kingdom that one will go after the other and then after the other and now we find ourselves stay under the Roman Kingdom I will show that to you now so those were the political Powers Daniel will now have a dream and God will now show him four beasts praise the Lord because beast in the Bible represent in power amen it's also proven we talk about H power in our in our modern science and uh uh uh so God will now give Daniel a dream and the significance of this dream is to show to Daniel the influence that is behind all of these political power so what Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about was the political power that would Ru the Gentile Kingdom what God will reveal to Daniel is the influence the strength that are Behind These political powers are we together I are you getting the picture praise the Lord So Daniel we have have this dream back in Daniel chapter 7 back in Daniel chapter 7 we read verse six the next beat was like a lepr then verse seven Daniel we say after this I saw in the night vision and behold a four Beast it was Dreadful it was terrible and strong exceeding and it had great iron teeth it divor and break in pieces and stem the rested you with the the feet of it and and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had 10 homes it had 10 homes praise the Lord are we together back to Revelation chapter 13 now so in Daniel n Vision we are seeing four beasts that is uh uh identified in the in the form of a lion in the form of a bed in the form of a leper the fourth one is very mysterious amen different from all the others very very mysterious they come up with 10 horns when John in Revelation chapter 13 now see the span of time between Daniel n vision and John on the island of pmos Praise the Lord amen see the span of time and year God will be giving John H a visitation a vision on the island of pmos and he will and and and he will write and let us to know we go back to verse one again I st I stood upon the sand of the seed and saw a beast rise out of the sea having seven head and 10 horns now in Daniel Vision the last Beast that he saw had 10 horns it was very mysterious but if there is one thing that we can identify from that last beast and bring it back to what John is seeing here that that last Beast had 10 horns this Beast that join the seene rising from the sea also have 10 horns praise the Lord are we together now one of the thing that is that is very important that we help us is uh let's go back to John uh Daniel chapter 12 let's go back to Daniel chapter 12 praise the Lord you love the Lord amen that's what happen when you start teaching it gets very quiet because everybody is trying to pay attention there is no emotion amen for us to get excited because we have to understand before we get excited amen you just don't get excited because you want to be excited amen you have to understand what the preacher is saying now if you read in Daniel chapter 12 I want I want to pick up some few things here if you reading Daniel chapter 12 you realize that uh uh God is revealing some things to Daniel Amen and uh uh I just I want to pick up pick up a verse here so uh we can we can uh uh okay let's look at uh verse two quick and many of them that slept in the dust of the Earth shall shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that and and they that be wise as shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many into righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and forth and knowledge shall increase now the reason why I'm reading this is because lot of what God revealed to Daniel here the angel is telling him shut the book most of what I have revealed to you is for the time of the end now that's the reason why when God is dealing with John on the island of pmos he had to bring up some of the things that Daniel saw are we together so Daniel had this Vision God say shut up the book these things are for the time of the end praise the Lord amen now uh uh for for for for the for us to have a continuation we must have a sense of repeat or reveal so as God is revealing to John things concerning the time of the end what is he going back he's going back and picking up from Daniel Vision because Daniel Vision was concerning the time of the end are we together praise the Lord you will see where we come into the feet that bringeth good tidings praise the Lord because if you look through the scripture some of these feet that brought us good tidings they never came to us so easily amen you think about Moses after killing an Egyptian and running into the Wilderness and God will meet him by a burning bush and say go and tell Pharaoh let my people go that message was good Tiding but it never came so easy Moses first he have to go back and face his failure because he fell in Egypt praise the Lord and most of the people knew that he came up as a a great deliverer kill one Egyptian and run in the wilderness he had to go back and face his failure he had to go back and face H H Pharaoh praise the Lord amen which pretty much was uh was the the the very Pharaoh you you know in in the same uh uh House of uh of the of the Egyptian Kingdom when he was there praise the Lord and he never just went and said Pharaoh you know uh the Lord God said let my people go and pH say okay you're go no he he he got resistance pharoh said no get it from here and and we know the time of the plague and and and uh we we know the great Deliverance that came down the mighty Red Sea Hing they Rejoice about it but then when they got into the Wilderness he even had to deal with his own people praise the Lord so this feet that brings Good Tidings they just don't come on saor platter praise the Lord Joshua was supposed to take the people into the promised land God told Moses this is Joshua commission he will distri build the land but he had to fight for every inch of ground he was bringing them to their land he was bringing them to their inheritance it was a good it was a feet that was bringing Good Tidings but yet it had a resistance praise the Lord amen so that's what I want to show you as we look into this so God is telling Daniel shut up the book SE up these things from uh to the time of the end you know uh knowledge shall increase and and and men will run to and forth now back to uh Revelation chapter 13 praise the Lord are we together now so in Revelation chapter 13 yeah we look again in verse one I stood upon the sand of the seed and I saw a beast rising up out of the seed having seven hairs and 10 horns the 10 horns is identified there in Daniel vision and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head the name of blasphemy praise the Lord amen now so uh uh we can go to Revelation chapter 17 to be able to identify this uh uh Beast out of Revelation chapter 13 let's go to Revelation chapter 17 are we together this will give us uh uh a lot of reading but let's just let's just stick together the picture will come together amen Revelation Chap 17:1 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven VES and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee I will show onto Thee the Judgment of the Great Hall and they seated upon many Waters praise the Lord amen that Beast was rising out of the seed it was coming from out of the water so I want us to pay attention to that I know many of us you have an idea with whom the kings of the Earth have had fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away that angel carried me away in the spirit into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet color Beast full of names of blasphemic having seven head and 10 horns so we can push this back over to Revelation chapter 13 that Beast that came from out of the seed with seven head and and uh uh uh 10 horns praise the Lord amen and the woman was array in purple and and and scarlet color dark with God and uh uh and and all and all the arrayment there verse five and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of halot and the Abominations of the earth praise the Lord amen so what what I want us to see here and uh uh let's go down to verse 9 let's go down to verse 9 and here is the mind which have wisdom the seven hairs are seven mountains on which the woman sth praise the Lord amen and there are seven Kings five are fallen and one is and the other to come but I want us to to to be able to pay attention to that verse 12 will tell us that the 10 horns which they are saw are 10 Kings they are 10 Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet a king for him to be a king he has to have a kingdom so if if there are 10 Kings and there are no Kingdom so that it shows there these are detectors they don't have a kingdom but they have power as kings they have no Kingdom at yet but receive power as king one hour with the Beast now so I'm bringing all of this because I want to build this picture before I get back over to Revelation chapter 10 now so we see here that uh this uh uh uh 10 you know uh uh seven hairs and 10 horns and crowns and name blaspheming we see that the scripture interpreting itself is letting us know that this is all about uh uh a woman which is a type of a church and we know that uh it all goes back to the Vatican the Vatican is the only church that is on Seven Hills are we together amen now the reason why I'm saying this is that whether you like it or not from the time of our Lord Jesus that that Beast system that mysterious Beast that Dan saw took a clear watch to our our lord Jesus even what is happening now in Palestine in Jerusalem is all under the influence of this power after you have to realize it was after it was during the time of the Roman rule when our lord Jesus was right there when he was crucified amen Rome wanted to know what was the power behind that simple man pet Marvel when he knew that Jesus was not guilty but yet he would not defend himself they wanted to understand what what was this about this man praise the Lord and after our lord Jesus Jesus was crucified and he resurrected and the and the Holy Spirit came back on the church praise the Lord Rome watched closely they saw how the early the early Christian how they will realize and they talk about the power of Jesus and they talk about all of the things that happened that is the reason why when the when the Roman Governor Titus came and besieged Jerusalem after Jerusalem was bese praise the Lord amen Rome ruled that place for the why to erase the history of the raising Christ to erase the history of what happened there they were the ones that changed to change the the the identity of the place it was the Roman government that changed it from uh uh Jerusalem and named that place is Palestinian so for the while it lost its identity praise the Lord because you have to realize that uh uh H caias and uh and and and the sedran council H presented Jesus Christ as the king of the Jews praise the Lord because they thought that if they present Jesus as the king of the Jews is going to make the Roman h h h government Furious because they should have no other king beside Caesar are we together so what am I trying to bring to you this morning is there the uh we were going into a little bit as we go into Revelation chapter 13 but from that time Rome started taking over and that was when the persecution all the church started they were trying to stamp the name of Jesus Christ trying to stem God out of the people and on and on as we would come to see it there was there was there was a change from Pagan Rome to Papa amen praise the Lord and when Papa room came that was when uh H H uh Rome in in all of a uh uh uh idolatrous worship triy to emerge with the church so the Christian Church present it now we having a great challenge because all that we know over the history over the the spend of time of Christianity all that we have today is greatly influenced by Rome praise the Lord amen amen all that we have today because because uh cism took over they took the Bibles they took the pure word from the people and they gave us all of these forms that we have set up choirs so the clergy can be entertained praise the Lord and most of what we have around Christian D that we call the church today is influenced by calm praise the Lord amen but God reach in Mercy amen the god F of all Grace praise the Lord came down with an open book and he had onef on the sea and onef on the earth praise the Lord to deliver us to bring us Good Tidings if we will ever go back to the origin of faith if we will ever go back to a Church where Christ is in the center of the Believers praise the Lord if we don't have that we are just having the form form of godliness and denying the power thereof which of course Paul told us to turn away are we together praise the Lord that is how strong because just like all of those superpower or nation that that Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream all of those beasts that Daniel saw in his vision was the power that was behind the nation every nation has a spiritual power behind it am are we together amen every nation has a spiritual power behind it every group of people every tribe every Gathering of people and I also believe that every church has a power behind it and the power that must be behind the Church of the Living God is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost should be the one influencing what we are doing it's not men's coming together and deciding and making an idea how we can make a better church are we together praise the Lord So Daniel Nebuchadnezzar had a dream that shows the the natural kingdoms Daniel being the prophet he had Vision that revealed the power that was behind each of those Nations praise the Lord are we together so yeah we see that uh John is letting us to know that this Beast that he's talking about from Revelation chapter 13 is a power that has rise out of the seed and in Revelation chapter 17 he said the seed represent multitudes of people praise the Lord and this power uh it has it has uh seven heads which which of course is seven mountains and and 10 uh horns which of course uh represent is 10 Kings which of course they they don't have a kingdom how are they Kings because they are appointed by the popes praise the Lord they are appointed by the pope so we see here that's that's not where I'm going I'm just giving you too much information than where I want to go this morning but I need to do that because I I I want to get a hold of you amen I I want to get a hold of you that's that's where I am this morning that's what I'm struggling I want to get a hold of you because if I can get a hold of you then I can startop preaching so in verse two here we see John verse 213 the Beast which which I saw was like h h a leper and he had a feet like a Beed he had a mouth like a lion and the dragon now the dragon now will be this Beast that Daniel could not describe because Daniel had a beast that he could not describe which was the fourth Beast praise the Lord amen then uh uh uh John is saying and the dragon give give him his power and his seat and his authority praise the Lord amen and I saw one of his head as it it were wounded to death and his daily wound was healed and all the word one th after the Beast and they worship the dragon which gave power unto the Beast praise the Lord amen saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make wall with her let's just read some few things here uh that will that will try to help help uh us uh anchor this together are we together praise the Lord praise the Lord let me just share few things with you praise the Lord amen okay we let's let's read from the mark of the beast here there's that red dragon the devil not in Russia in Rome and said the devil gave him power give him his seat his authority red dragon n russer I've heard great ministers say the the Russian is the Antichrist why the Russian has nothing to do with the Antichrist that's communism the false tra of protest Pro protesting and cism has produced communism the reason that the Russian drove them out of there because they had all the money and had all the prayers said to them sins so they buil the biggest building and have all the wealth of the people and bundle it up like that now this this will give us uh a picture here you have to realize that uh uh uh most of these communist country they had their time of Revival if you go back to 1909 you will know that there was a Revival in North Korea that a Revival which was uh the the breaking out of the Holy Spirit they had they had the move of God now so here uh brother Bram is giving us a a a history of how how these nations turned to be communist nation is because of the misrepresentation of the Gospel praise the Lord here in America we are not we are not turning to communist but we having a a large growing of agnostic people and Atheism why because of the misrepresentation of the Gospel when we have all of our mega churches preaching Prosperity Gospel praise the Lord when we have men that are preaching the word of God and living completely different from what the word requir them to live all all it does is it just hiding the hearts of the people am praise the Lord it hide in the hearts of the people why should we preach something from the gospel and they can't see it we preach a god of love and there is just bunch of hatred among the people so that is affecting the society and brother Braham is saying that is the same thing that happened over in Russia that's the reason why they drove the Protestant Church they having their own Russian Orthodox Church why because capitalism was ended and all with this Purgatory you got to pay for the dead and they go after the rich people and and and they bring their children into the convent and make n a nons out of them just to go after their parents' wealth they did all of those things praise the Lord and they were gathering the wealth of the people and you will not be surprised it was some of the things that caused the persecution of the Jews because they thought that the Jews were they were the business men praise the Lord so all of those things things that affected uh H H uh the the church in Russia is because we have this uh H H system we have this system it's a system praise the Lord and that system is after every one of us it don't care what church you go to what the name is if the system can kill the effect of God in your life if the system can give you a Reas to believe that church is just a game the system get a hold of you praise the Lord because we will read from the scripture sh that that system is after the reach is after the pole and the Bible says it will cause every man upon the Earth To Worship the Beast what are you like it or not I we we together praise the Lord am so you have uh uh uh uh you have the the the the Russian Orthodox Church they do their you know they have their own uh worship you know whether they don't take they don't take uh uh uh direct order from the pope because if if you even if you even study uh the colanda you will realize that uh uh uh the Vatican gives us our yearly calendar when it comes to Christian event they are the one that decide when is Easter because it has to go by their length Season but if you go to the Russian calendar where a lot of the the the the Nations onor communist use their Easter comes right after our Easter praise the Lord I have a brother there in Romania and uh uh uh a couple of years ago he invited me to do an Easter meeting I told you I said well no uh we will be having Easter meeting back home he said no brother after your Easter is our Easter praise the Lord because they go by the Orthodox calendar are we together amen too much information but we we will get to where we want to go this morning by God's help so that's the reason Uh Russian drove them out because uh uh they had had all the money and had all the prayers for the Saints and and and they build big big uh biger building and all the wealth of the people and bundle it up like that and they seen that they live no different and was no different from any of the rest of the world praise the Lord and they spilled it out and formed communism praise the Lord that was how they kicked the church out and it came out with Communism now okay let's let's go back to Revelation chapter 13 there's a place I want us to get okay I see um I'm getting out of time here let me go very quickly now now let's go to verse three and I saw one of the hair that were wounded to death and his daily W was healed and all the world Wonder after the Beast and they worship the dragon which have given onto the Beast and and uh which are giving power unto the Beast sorry and they worship the Beast saying who is like the Beast and and who is able to make walls unto her praise the Lord let's drop down yet again who is able to make war like unto her I read another another quote here from Mark of the Beast who can make wall with her there there's no one man in the word only one man in the word in all the word h that has power as King Nebuchadnezzar Vision was amen them 10 TOS run out that uh stke of uh uh Roman iron Runs Out in every nation in the world there's only one man in the word got the sav Soul that's the pope of Rome president can speak in United States or the United St president can speak and and it's a law but there's other Nation he can speak into and it's nothing but the Catholic hierarchy can speak in Rome and every nation will holl to it that's right amen no man can make war like him verse five let's go quickly and there was given unto him a mouth a mouth speaking great things and blaspheming and power was given unto him to continue fored in two months and he opened his mouth in blaspheming against God blaspheming his name and his Tabernacle and them there DED in heaven uh that's that was beautiful let me let me read read something here to you in the fourth seal he opened his mouth in blaspheming against God there you are to blaspheme his name how did he blaspheme His Name by giving the church a title amen instead of baptising in Jesus name they give the church a title Father Son and Holy Ghost he blasphemed his Tabernacle how did he do that the Tabernacle of God which is the Holy Ghost that's the dwelling place of God but they replaced there to be Rome the Vatican as the holy place and the blaspheme them that dwell in heaven how did he do that blaspheme them by saying they are intercessor praise the Lord that they are interceding for the people that the de go into purgatory and will pray to you know all the sins that have gone C married and all of that they are blaspheming those people blaspheming the name of God are we together let's go quickly and it was giv him power to make Wars with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him uh over all Kindred over every thong and over every nation and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose name are nowar written in the lamb in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world he that have an ear let him Year Praise the Lord are we together amen then when you go to verse 11 I'm running out of time here and I beheld another Beast coming out of the earth and he had two HS like a lamb and he speak as the dragon the first Beast came out of the sea praise the Lord John is now seeing another Beast that is coming out of the earth praise the Lord now you will see here that uh uh uh let's let's let's just read this quickly and the inured of the Lord and the word of the little lamb that rose up in Revelation 13 it has uh it has two little homs probably little horns Savor and ecclesiastic power but after the lamb freedom of religion and so forth but after the wi it speak like the Beast like the dragon and exercise all the power the dragon did before him a bitter religious persecution we are nearing that time now so as we will look at that quickly the Beast that came out of the seed we we identify that with the Roman system we identify that with the seven head you know uh uh the the the seven the 10 horns and the crowns and all of that we identify that with the Roman system here we have another Beast that is rising out of the sea the Bible says that when this beig uh came out of the seed he had two horns like a lamb like a lamb it was not a lamb but it was like a lamb now brother brandham who says he says that is that is the American buffalo it's not a lamb he says that's where United States is represented in the scripture and I will tell you that there is no Nation Under Heaven that have pushed the gospel like the United States every denomination that that is found all around the world has found their headquarters somewhere here in the USA amen now so but it goes back it goes more than that it goes back to the history of the nation why he says here in the AM of the Beast he says two horn like a lamb not a lamb what is it is our American buffalo show he said two horns like a lamb but then what did he do he had the freedom of religion first he acted like a lamb that was what our the fing fathers brought they ran from Catholic persecution and they came to a land to give birth to a new nation a beast rising out of a land brother B says it was it was a land that needed to be inhabited are we together and what the Bro the freedom of religion like a lamb the lamb speaks of Christ are we together amen but this Beast that rise up out of this land is pretty soon going to start speaking like the dragon amen praise the Lord amen so you see it it's it's all because of the influence no matter what the nation is no matter what you know about the nation history all the nation leaders all is Army power there is a spiritual influence behind the nation that's what proves that your spirit is stronger than your body your your body is just a vehicle it's the spirit that drives it praise the Lord the nation in all his politics and all his governor and all of his judges is just a vehicle there is a spirit behind it that drives it praise the Lord amen amen the falling father came and then the late biblical principle you will find that even the forms of government that was established in America is from Isaiah go go go to the book of Isaiah you find all of his law they came with h that that place of founding the land to run away then break away from the suppression of the Roman Church that was ruling in in in Europe a beast rising out of the the Earth it came up so innocently like a lamb praise the Lord but not too long it start speaking like a dragon praise the Lord are we together I'll read something to you so I can find a place to close here let's go verse 12 and he exercised all the power of the first Beast before it it came up as a lamb but pretty soon it started exercising all the power of the first Beast that came out of the sea it started exercising the Roman power and now pretty soon all of our judges in the Supreme Court are Catholics our present president is a Catholic there's a huge Catholic influence that is behind the nation amen praise the Lord amen when they started taking Bibles from the school that was that was catholism approach take the Bible away and give the people what the church says praise the Lord are we together it's start exercising the power of the first Beast verse 13 and he does great wonders so that he make fire come down from heaven I I love this one I love this one because you will never not easily be able to pick that up until a prophet reveal that to you see what he says I love it Mark of the Beast here uh where we were reading from earlier he says Alam that's the American buffalo show he says two hn like a lamb and then what did he do he had a freedom of religion first he acted like a lamb it spoke like a lamb but remember he never did become an old L he was a lamb which mean it never grow up it stay in that infant state of religious freedom and then it was overtaken by the Beast now he goes ahead he says this country is only 150 years old he says and then he speaks like the dragon he exercis all the power uh uh uh the first Beast had before him the red dragon and causes all that on the earth that dwells upon uh upon on the the Earth To Worship the Beast whose daily wound was healed and and he does great Wonder so he make he make him a fire come down out of Heaven the atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb smart intelligent nation and so forth deceiving the Nations by these things now when you read that you think that it's like Elijah calling fire down from heaven brother brandham says no is the US making hydrogen bombs that's what he use on on Japan intelligent Nation are we together and he go ahead he says is here he says uh this United State will come to a time that church and state will unite together the Protestant and the Catholic with draw their things together to fight communist and it is exactly plain in the hand of what God Said right here praise the Lord so you see we we are we are walking on the pages of scripture everything that is happening around us everything that is happening around us like I always say prophecy is stronger than politics amen amen now with a few minutes that is left before us I have to find a place to close this I was thinking that U maybe uh uh as we start the the New Year if if Jesus started we might do a kind of a revelation series I would like to go from one chapter to another and uh uh I think if the Lord will allow us to do that I believe that will be a blessing amen so uh uh now what I want us to see where where I'm where I'm here now we have seen a beast rising out of the sea we have seen a beast rising out of the earth praise the Lord amen in Revelation chap 10 verse 2 when we read that ear the mighty angel came down with a book in his hands and that book is the Book of Revelation Revelation chapter 5 the book that was one seal with Seven Seals that no man was watering to take the seals of the book no man was wed to read the book no man was wed to even look upon the book amen and the he said to John weep net for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed praise the Lord and he would take the book and he will lose the seals thereof and when John turned around he saw a lamb a leading lamb now so it was that book that was sealed with Seven Seals now in Revelation chapter 10 we are seeing the mighty Angel ho in the open book praise the Lord and if you go back and and uh uh uh we did a lot of reading this morning but you go back to Revelation chapter 1 you look at the identification of the angel in Revelation chap 10 and you look in Revelation chapter 1 you will see that was Jesus Christ amen his feet like like uh fire pillow of fire that's what John said and and and in Revelation 4:3 he had a rboard around his head in Revelation chapter 5 verse1 that was the same angel that was our Lord Jesus Christ are we together amen you see how it fit in with a son of man Ministry he had a open book in his hands and the Bible says he had one foot upon the Sea The Very sea where that Beast will rise out of out of and he had another for upon the Earth the very Earth where the second beast will rise from with the open book now we see a power that rise out of the Beast and is rising out of the earth to unite itself and stem God's people praise the Lord are we together are you seeing the picture but here is a prophecy that the mighty Angel the Lord himself shall Des same yes Lord that's what Paul says in the book of Thessalon the Lord himself shall Des sin with a shout and the voice of the AR Angel and as he descend he put in his legs over those Powers over the power the influence from the Vatican church he's putting his legs over the power that is also influen amen praise the Lord amen are we together are you seeing the picture blessed are the feet that brings us Good Tidings let me show you a picture so it will become clearer to you Joshua chapter 10 when you go in Joshua chapter 10 you will read a story that is very very amazing over in Genesis chapter 15 when God gave the promise to Abraham God told Abraham that your seed was so jwn in a Strange Land and after 400 years I will bring them out the condition of bringing them out God says I will wait for the sin of the amorites he was waiting for the sin of the amorites to be fil now if you go to Joshua chapter 10 if we can quickly go there I just read a verse or two give you the picture here these are the kings of the Amor five kings that is coming against Israel what is what is very beautiful about this is that uh I'll show there to you you love the Lord amen what a wonderful Jesus we serve praise the Lord what whether we like it or not every nation is under the influence of this Roman power amen praise the Lord you never seen an evangelist on the field that is evangelising uh uh say I'm an evangelist from the Roman Church from the Catholic Church they don't have they don't have to evangelize all all they have to do is just build a church they just build a church maybe they give us a school or a clinic before a year end that church will be filled praise the Lord it has its Church all over the world that gives information to the Vatican praise the Lord Charles chin will give us an information in his book that he wrote 50 years in the Church of Rome what was amazing was he said before President Lincoln would be killed he came down to sin Cloud the priest in the dasis of the church in St Cloud knew that President Lincoln would be killed the next day this was not a a story that F that that that happen very far from Us Praise the Lord we live in a waron country Liberia and we knew some of those things I was right there in uh in in yipa the priest knew if the town will be attack he knew if the if the town would be attacked the Catholic priest knew praise the Lord let's take Joshua chapter 10 quickly here sorry I'm keeping you molding I thought I should but uh I try to close up on this here I just want to show you something it's it's it's very very beautiful amazing when you look at it praise the Lord verse one and it came to pass when Adon zc the king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua has taken you have to know Jerusalem was part of the land of the amorites before David make Jerusalem the city of Zion this was over in the land of the amorites now so here is a king this is not a Jewish King this is uh uh uh a gentile King are we together this is a gentile King what what is amazing here is that his name idon zc it means the Lord of Justice you have to know adona adona the name adona praise the Lord look at mechis EDC the king of salom that came to Abraham so here is this Gentile King having two Jewish name that looks like the king of Peace thousands of years even before Israel will be able to possess their inheritance here is a gentile King sitting right in the land of the Amorite that is the type of our Antichrist praise the Lord a gentile King and his name is adona zc the Lord of Justice the Lord of peace is that not our V the pope praise the Lord are we together now this King will gather the five Kings of the land of the Amorite and said we have to stop these people I will not take much of your time as I said and uh uh let's go over to verse 24 quickly they will come against Joshua and his men you love the Lord I hope I said something that that that uh that was a blessing to you amen not just an information not just uh uh uh you know being excited and shouting at you but uh just to be able to say something that will be a blessing to you the Bible says here and uh verse 22 when we read here in uh uh Joshua chapter 10 and Joshua then said Joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five Kings unto me out of the cave and the and they did so and brought forth those five Kings Kings unto him out of the Cave the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of and all of those kings verse 24 and it came to pass when they brought out those King unto Joshua that Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said unto the captain of the men of war that went with him come night put your feet upon the neck praise the Lord amen the mighty angel came down in Revelation chapter 10 where one fought upon the sea and one F upon the Earth and we know that Footprints means possession praise the Lord yes Joshua in a type he's capturing the kings of the land of Amorite the very land that God told his father Abraham I'm going to bring you to that land of the amorites praise the Lord and then when he got the kings of the land of amorites he laid every one of them down and he asked the men of War to come and put their feet a sound of possessing subjecting the powers that was ruling the land the very same thing that the Mighty angel will do for you and myself praise the Lord you see that's the reason why the promise of Malachi 4 those Divine mystery truth that will turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers praise the Lord amen this is not just about a man this is about what God is doing amen to be able to restore back the true Faith to the people that's the reason why is Not Enough by joining the church it has to take a birth it has to come by a new birth it has to come by a revelation because whether you like it or not we are all under this Roman power they are the one running our economy they have all the gold of the word praise the Lord amen whether you like it or not it is God in his word that revealed those four superpowers and the kingdom of of Babylon has gone the kingdom of the me and the Persian is gone the kingdom of the Greeks is gone but we stay under the Roman influence it's no no longer Pagan Rome that's why we don't have herses running through the street it's now Papa Rome it have taken a religious form praise the Lord It's called The M of harot and all the churches are her

Christmas tree up our Christmas light up and all of that whether you like it or not it's not your choice there is a power there is an influence amen praise the Lord oh but we can be grateful for the feet that have bring us Good Tidings because it has one foot on the earth and one foot on the sea and it has opened the book it has made this truth this mystery truth known to us so we can escape the power of the Beast praise the Lord whether you like it or not I can show you a prophecy in the book of Isaiah Babylon say I will never go childless that Spirit of Babylon it say I will never go childless she will always have a people under her influence praise the Lord but we want to be a people under the influence of the Holy Ghost we want to be a people under the influence of the voice of God I don't care what you call it praise the Lord it have opened my eyes it have changed my life they have made me to know the word that I'm living in hallelujah praise the Lord amen our leaders are

day I thank God for the feet that have brought us Good Tidings praise the lord it's not to make a church people no it's not to make a church this message is not about making church if you want church

that bring us good tidings glory be to God it might be a message that is greatly spoken against on the internet praise the Lord it might be a voice that sounds like an old kic preacher I cannot hardly find the right English grammar to speak but I'm telling you people of God he says in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God one mystery with three four purpose the mystery of God the mystery of God will be finished are we together praise the Lord as they I've always been many times when we we have a blessing we don't really know that we are
