[41:06] himself up when we needed to warm
[41:08] ourself up praise the Lord so we thank
[41:10] the Lord we thank the Lord and uh and uh
[41:14] actually uh I was I was uh uh talking
[41:19] with a friend down there and and we were
[41:22] keeping conversation actually this he's
[41:24] a guy that that that's that
[41:27] uh he's he's uh my babber so we were
[41:30] talking and uh there were a few things
[41:32] there they were trying to you know ask
[41:35] me and we were talking about and
[41:36] fellowshipping and then someone came in
[41:39] and then uh I think they goes to the
[41:41] same church and they started talking and
[41:43] says oh you you know what this coming
[41:45] Sunday is is uh Pastor appreciation
[41:49] Sunday and it's just you know and and
[41:51] and all of that I said oh wow you know
[41:54] uh uh how the word how how all of these
[41:57] things plan out you know and uh but I
[42:01] started thinking about it I started
[42:03] thinking about it where where did that
[42:05] came from I started you know trying to I
[42:09] never went searching on the internet
[42:11] nothing like that I was just thinking in
[42:12] my mind because actually uh uh this week
[42:18] uh uh you know
[42:22] um I think Tuesday a lot of lot of
[42:25] churches had this weekend doing uh trunk
[42:28] and treat you know a kind of a uh
[42:32] so-called religious name that is that
[42:34] that is put to uh uh uh you know a hiden
[42:38] practice and uh uh because uh uh Tuesday
[42:43] is Halloween now you you have to know if
[42:46] you remember last year we we did
[42:48] something which of course this year I
[42:50] thought that uh I will I will speak on
[42:53] uh uh lther and his thesis that was put
[42:57] upon the church I thought I I would be
[42:59] able to do that right after Halloween
[43:01] but I don't know how much I'm prepared
[43:03] for it but uh uh uh so I started
[43:07] thinking in my mind because the church
[43:10] came out with an All Saints Day you know
[43:13] on All Saints Day uh to be able to fight
[43:16] against that Halloween spirit not to
[43:19] fully identify with it but to fight
[43:21] against it but you see it takes it takes
[43:25] the word of God that is ordained for
[43:27] your age to be able to to to
[43:31] fight the spirit of your
[43:34] age now how clever we can reason in our
[43:38] mind how we can be able to make you know
[43:43] uh religious feast just so we can get
[43:47] ourself involved in uh uh you know
[43:51] circular
[43:52] practice if the word if it's against the
[43:54] word of God let be against it right
[43:57] don't go around it that's right praise
[43:59] the Lord don't say Well since all the
[44:01] word is doing that let's do our own this
[44:04] way because there are a lot of things
[44:05] that's it's I'm not preaching so let me
[44:07] not take the time of the preacher but
[44:10] the reason why I say that is that I was
[44:12] thinking about it y said that uh uh uh
[44:18] uh the the word is doing the uh uh a
[44:21] pastor Appreciation Day a dear pastor
[44:24] friend of mine uh someone that we know
[44:27] that's brother maran's dad brother uh
[44:29] Pastor Martin is from
[44:31] Nigeria uh I think he he T about me and
[44:35] then he sent uh uh somebody might have
[44:38] sent this out to him and he's he he also
[44:41] sent it to me today is Pastor day the
[44:44] pastor no one knows what a pastor hears
[44:48] no one know what a pastor
[44:50] see the secret he must
[44:53] keep the Temptation he encountered the
[44:55] tear ears he Shar the sorrow he endure
[44:58] the loneliness he managed the bitterness
[45:02] he experienced the lies level against
[45:05] him by some of the people
[45:07] he how he accommodate those who pretend
[45:12] they love him but behind they destroy
[45:15] him how he tried to live more than a
[45:20] human the lack he suffer the
[45:24] Discrimination he must must not reator
[45:28] the
[45:29] accusation he
[45:32] must uh he has to mute at the
[45:36] expectation he strive to CP
[45:39] with even a fellow pastor does not know
[45:43] what the other goes through and on and
[45:46] on and on we can we can be able to say
[45:48] read out of that to you and uh
[45:53] uh but I thought that it it kind of work
[45:56] very well for us that we will have uh a
[46:00] pastor to speak to us this weekend
[46:03] praise the
[46:04] Lord let me tell you my my one of my
[46:07] weaknesses one of my weaknesses uh that
[46:10] that I think the Lord deliver me you
[46:13] know when we when we uh uh set out to
[46:16] have a meeting and it turned out that uh
[46:19] for one reason or another that we can
[46:21] make the service and yeah we will have a
[46:24] guest and then we are not in church it
[46:27] used to bother
[46:29] me but I prayed about it you know and uh
[46:33] I I and uh if you remember I read a
[46:35] quote to you Wednesday night where
[46:37] brother bam was talking about the burden
[46:39] of the word of the Lord it don't have to
[46:41] be the burden for our church it has to
[46:42] be the burden of the word of the Lord
[46:44] praise the Lord even though we take the
[46:46] people as a burden on our heart but I
[46:49] would tell you that uh uh uh I had a
[46:52] good time in the Lord amen I enjoy the
[46:55] word of God preached last night and like
[46:57] I said to you before you know uh if you
[47:00] would just only think about this think
[47:02] about it this way we never have an empty
[47:06] service you know why because Angels
[47:09] brother brandham says since the
[47:11] resurrection of Jesus Christ he said
[47:13] from the beginning of the New Testament
[47:15] Church he said angels has been attracted
[47:18] to our
[47:19] message praise the Lord he said angels
[47:23] has been attracted to our message how
[47:25] much more about the opening of the
[47:28] seals praise the Lord amen how much more
[47:33] about the opening of the seals you know
[47:35] those those those Angelic BS you know H
[47:39] that cry before God holy holy they have
[47:42] no idea no knowledge of this great truth
[47:46] that God has given to us the Bible says
[47:49] the angels of the Lord are incam about
[47:51] those that fear if they don't have seed
[47:54] they incam about us if they have seat I
[47:57] believe they filled those seats
[47:59] amen praise the Lord but uh I I think
[48:03] it's a privilege for us to have brother
[48:04] doc Baker with us like he said we we got
[48:07] to know one another uh uh a little bit
[48:10] from a distance uh we met in few
[48:12] meetings there in North Carolina and uh
[48:15] that was the first time I sat under his
[48:17] ministry I enjoy the preaching of the
[48:20] word and uh and this time uh which of
[48:23] course he don't know there is something
[48:25] I was praying for uh uh I was praying
[48:29] for in the month of April that was
[48:30] something that was on my heart I was
[48:32] trusting the Lord and I was just
[48:34] committing it to
[48:35] God and then uh right in that time he
[48:39] then he sent me uh uh WhatsApp message a
[48:42] text message and said brother one we
[48:44] would love to have you to come and
[48:45] Minister for us uh in some way it was
[48:49] not a direct answer but it was it was a
[48:51] comfort I believe that uh exactly what I
[48:54] was I was I was taking thinking about I
[48:56] believe that the Lord hear me praise the
[48:57] Lord if brother Bam could comfort I mean
[49:00] the pro the Lord could comfort his
[49:02] Prophet by killing a carable deer you
[49:05] know well uh God gave that to brother
[49:08] Brandon for the comfort that his mother
[49:09] was going away so God have different
[49:12] ways of comforting his people different
[49:14] ways of speaking to us and uh and and
[49:17] then since that time we've been having
[49:18] wonderful Fellowship so uh uh we will

[52:54] again uh some new faces we didn't see
[52:57] last night and uh others that we got
[53:00] acquainted with for a few minutes um it
[53:03] is indeed a privilege to be here with
[53:04] you and uh we don't take that lightly we
[53:07] don't just say things to just say it
[53:09] it's a it's an honor to be here with you
[53:11] to be with the portion of the body of
[53:15] Christ uh the Northern Lights that's
[53:17] what I'm to call you I've always wanted
[53:20] to see them I guess I'm getting to see
[53:22] them here yeah once you're gone it'll be
[53:25] complete darkness here but for now
[53:29] you're the Northern
[53:31] Lights Hallelujah blessed be the name of
[53:33] the Lord thank you musicians God bless
[53:36] you my there's so many things that we
[53:38] could say but I I don't want to wear you
[53:40] out I I did take a little extra time
[53:45] it's your fault but I took a little
[53:46] extra time last night and um just the
[53:50] pull was I just get pulled different
[53:52] directions and um we just
[53:56] learn to surrender to the Lord and and
[54:00] trust that you know because we don't
[54:02] know what the needs are we don't uh and
[54:06] I love that I love the fact that we can
[54:09] wait on the Lord and show up and we
[54:11] don't get together with the pastor um
[54:14] and talk about okay well I got this
[54:16] problem or you know could you deal with
[54:18] this or that uh I think they do that in
[54:21] the organizations but we don't do that
[54:24] we just um look to the Lord and and um
[54:28] and then you hear afterwards uh wow you
[54:31] know this specific thing or that
[54:32] specific thing and we don't know about
[54:34] it and being a pastor myself we have
[54:38] ministers come in and and I will tell
[54:41] the let's say they're maybe they're
[54:43] going to have a couple of services yet
[54:45] ahead of them I tell them when the
[54:48] services are over because I don't want
[54:49] to say anything right now I'll tell you
[54:51] what the Lord was using you for because
[54:54] as a pastor uh we know what the needs
[54:56] are of the body and we know that it
[54:58] takes a five-fold Ministry um to uh
[55:02] bring to edify and to bring that body to
[55:05] maturity and so as a pastor we pray
[55:08] about it and the Lord will bring a
[55:10] different kind of a Ministry through
[55:12] sometimes they'll say the very same
[55:13] thing that that the local Pastor has
[55:16] been saying and then I'll have somebody
[55:18] in the congregation come up and say wow
[55:21] my I've never heard that and I'm
[55:23] thinking well you've only heard it about
[55:25] 20
[55:26] times but the truth of the matter is and
[55:28] we don't care you know all credit goes
[55:31] to the Lord we don't care we're not
[55:33] looking for credit what we're care about
[55:35] is that that the people get it so in in
[55:39] reality when they said I never heard
[55:41] that before it's true they didn't they
[55:43] heard the words but God sent a different
[55:46] ministering gift in and it dealt with it
[55:48] and maybe just a little different way
[55:51] and they got it and that's that's what
[55:53] we want
[55:55] right amen so I bring greetings from our
[55:58] church in uh Tucson Arizona for my wife
[56:01] um my first
[56:03] wife my only
[56:07] wife I'm going to get myself in
[56:10] trouble uh we've been married 42 years
[56:12] now and uh I I just I I was telling
[56:16] somebody I was talking to uh some of you
[56:19] after service last night and I don't
[56:22] think of myself as being 63 years old in
[56:25] my in my mind right and I will look at
[56:28] people that are my age and I look at
[56:30] them I think poor guy you know and then
[56:33] I look in the mirror and it's like well
[56:35] that's what I look like in my mind I
[56:38] don't feel like I'm that but it it
[56:41] happens quicker than you than you would
[56:43] imagine young people I I got tired of
[56:47] hearing that from older people but now
[56:49] I'm one of those older
[56:50] people and if the Lord carries you'll
[56:53] you'll be right where I'm at someday
[56:55] amen so we just thank the Lord for his
[56:57] goodness his Mercy we thank the Lord for
[56:59] his for the opportunity to be with you
[57:01] this
[57:02] weekend and our our fervent desire is
[57:05] that something would be said that would
[57:08] be a help that's that's all we want to
[57:10] do there's no big eyes or little 's we
[57:12] just want to want to put our shoulder
[57:14] behind the work that's here put our
[57:16] shoulder behind the pastor and just um
[57:18] serve you however we can and and may God
[57:22] be glorified in our midst anden may all
[57:25] of us be drawn closer to him and you
[57:27] know uh we as ministers we get
[57:30] ministered to also uh uh when we visit
[57:33] other places and so so we're just
[57:36] looking for God to have his way and uh
[57:38] as I said last night if I say something
[57:41] that doesn't quite sound right you just
[57:43] stay with what uh your pastor's been
[57:45] bringing and just allow it to my
[57:47] ignorance because I'm not I
[57:49] don't I'm not coming here to bring any
[57:52] kind of a different idea I'm coming to
[57:54] just bring what the Lord's put on my
[57:56] heart from the word and I trust that
[57:58] it'll be a blessing to you so I'd like
[58:02] to read this morning from Luke the 12th
[58:04] chapter and we'll read verses 42-
[58:08] 46 somebody say praise the Lord praise
[58:11] the Lord you know it won't make me
[58:12] nervous at all if you say Amen or praise
[58:15] the Lord or
[58:16] Hallelujah you know I'd hate to get to
[58:19] the other side to find out I could have
[58:20] enjoyed
[58:21] this I I was raised in the denomination
[58:24] s i I started going to church when I was
[58:27] 5 or six years old and got baptized at
[58:30] an early age I knew there was a God I
[58:31] believed that God was real I didn't know
[58:34] him personally I didn't know anybody
[58:35] that knew him personally uh we memorized
[58:38] Bible scriptures and and one day when I
[58:41] was uh 28 the message of the hour came
[58:45] across my path and the Bible became a a
[58:48] brand new Bible to me um but as as a
[58:52] Baptist we didn't uh and I'm not thrown
[58:55] off on you know everything's for a
[58:56] purpose I'm not thrown off on on anybody
[58:59] here um this morning but we were pretty
[59:03] reserved and pretty you know if somebody
[59:05] said amen everybody turned their head
[59:06] you know and uh um I didn't I didn't
[59:11] worship I
[59:12] didn't I didn't sing and I was actually
[59:17] didn't realize I was robbed of all the
[59:20] blessings that comes from being able to
[59:22] worship Our God from our heart and so
[59:26] anyway when the Lord got a hold of me
[59:29] this message became real to me and I'm
[59:31] being schooled uh by the message of the
[59:34] hour I had something to praise him about
[59:37] and I just oh my I just I didn't care
[59:40] what anybody thought and and first thing
[59:43] I know I couldn't wait to get around
[59:45] other believers and the first thing I
[59:47] know is I'm being labeled they're
[59:49] calling me a Pentecostal and I didn't
[59:51] know that that was a dirty word you know
[59:54] starts with a P they'd say the p word
[59:57] well he's Pentecostal you know I never
[1:00:00] was I never was part of that
[1:00:02] organization but I am Pentecostal from
[1:00:05] the top of my head to the bottom of my
[1:00:06] feet just as my Prophet just as my
[1:00:09] Prophet was don't get nervous now uh I
[1:00:13] worship my God and I don't apologize for
[1:00:15] it amen you know there's a there's a
[1:00:20] word uh uh there's a word called for
[1:00:23] mahide anybody familiar with that word
[1:00:26] so if when you brother Bram talks about
[1:00:28] it he says when you put somebody uh uh
[1:00:31] in a morg uh at a funeral parlor you
[1:00:35] take the blood out to make sure they're
[1:00:38] dead and then you inject them with for
[1:00:40] mahigh to make sure they stay dead right
[1:00:43] and then everybody comes together and
[1:00:45] and they tell stories and you know the
[1:00:47] the person that's in the casket a lot of
[1:00:49] times I'm not making light of this but
[1:00:51] the person in the cactus cactus in the
[1:00:55] uh casket thank you uh many times they
[1:00:58] look better in the casket than they did
[1:01:00] during life you know they they've got
[1:01:02] them all fixed up and then everybody's
[1:01:03] telling stories about him now if that
[1:01:06] guy stood up or made a sound it would
[1:01:10] scare you to death because you're not
[1:01:11] expecting that right because you're in a
[1:01:14] funeral parlor right and I found that uh
[1:01:19] that church people could be that way
[1:01:21] sometimes you know they just get it just
[1:01:22] scares them to death somebody says amen
[1:01:25] or shouts or gets excited right because
[1:01:29] I think they're not they're not
[1:01:31] expecting it in their funeral
[1:01:34] service but this isn't a funeral service
[1:01:36] it's a
[1:01:37] resurrection
[1:01:39] amen so we're not we're not telling
[1:01:43] anybody to act any certain way uh just
[1:01:46] don't criticize me when I praise the
[1:01:48] Lord when I worship you worship Him from
[1:01:51] the bottom of your heart I'll do the
[1:01:53] same amen amen blessed be the name of
[1:01:56] the Lord so I'm sorry I've got you
[1:01:57] standing I I I'll let you we'll read the
[1:01:59] word here in just a second but they
[1:02:01] inject him with felhide and I got to
[1:02:03] thinking about that the root of the word
[1:02:05] felhide is
[1:02:07] formal right formal right so they're
[1:02:11] injected with
[1:02:13] formalism
[1:02:15] and when this message really got a hold
[1:02:17] of me I had something to sing about
[1:02:18] shout about and you know this baptist
[1:02:21] boy was
[1:02:23] Pentecostal and people were trying to
[1:02:26] tell me to be careful and trying to get
[1:02:28] me to settle down you know and say well
[1:02:31] you know you're just immature and you
[1:02:32] you'll get out of that stage and I
[1:02:34] thought I hope I never do get out of the
[1:02:36] stage of wanting to worship Him and
[1:02:38] thank him and give him praise and we
[1:02:40] don't rely on any of that as a as any
[1:02:43] kind of evidence it's
[1:02:45] just we're worshiping the Living God
[1:02:50] right and we should enjoy
[1:02:53] it Luke
[1:02:55] 12:42 and the Lord said who is who then
[1:03:00] is that faithful and wise Steward whom
[1:03:03] his Lord shall make ruler over his
[1:03:05] household to give them their portion of
[1:03:07] meat and due
[1:03:08] season blessed is that servant whom his
[1:03:12] Lord when he cometh shall find so doing
[1:03:15] now notice this servant he's not just
[1:03:17] giving them meat he's giving them the
[1:03:20] portion in due
[1:03:23] season blessed is that servant whom his
[1:03:27] Lord when he cometh shall find so doing
[1:03:31] of a truth I say unto you that he will
[1:03:34] make him ruler over all that he hath but
[1:03:37] and if that servant say in his heart my
[1:03:40] Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin
[1:03:43] to beat the men's servants and the
[1:03:44] maidens and to eat and drink and to be
[1:03:47] drunken the Lord of that servant will
[1:03:49] come in a day when he lookth not for him
[1:03:52] and in an hour when he is not aware and
[1:03:55] will cut him in Sunder and will appoint
[1:03:58] him his portion with the unbelievers
[1:04:01] well that's a pretty sad state right and
[1:04:03] I trust that there's not a one of us
[1:04:05] that wants to be uh numbered in that
[1:04:08] number but we know that the script is
[1:04:10] written we know that people are going to
[1:04:12] play out this part but far be it from me
[1:04:15] I don't want that to be uh my Epitaph I
[1:04:19] don't want that to be the description of
[1:04:21] of my walk here on the earth I want to
[1:04:23] be faithful don't you and we'd like to
[1:04:26] be remembered in prayer and you don't
[1:04:27] just want to lift your hand up as we go
[1:04:29] to the Lord in prayer father as we come
[1:04:31] this morning Lord there's we're just
[1:04:34] we're your children Lord and we're so
[1:04:36] grateful to be uh gathered together it's
[1:04:39] a privilege Lord that you've allowed us
[1:04:40] to gather together with those of light
[1:04:42] precious faith and as I stand before the
[1:04:45] redeemed of of your blood Lord when I
[1:04:47] recognize the the pricelessness of your
[1:04:50] blood we know Lord that if we if we had
[1:04:54] a jar of your blood it would be so
[1:04:57] precious we couldn't put a price on it
[1:04:59] and we certainly wouldn't try to put a
[1:05:01] price on it we recognize the value of it
[1:05:03] but then Lord when we recognize that you
[1:05:05] exchanged that for something and I'm
[1:05:09] standing before a portion of what you
[1:05:11] exchanged that blood for and Lord you
[1:05:14] don't get a bad deal you didn't you
[1:05:17] didn't exchange it for something that
[1:05:19] was worthless you exchanged it for
[1:05:22] something that you that is of value to
[1:05:25] you and so Lord I I I stand Here humbly
[1:05:29] and I pray that you would help us Lord
[1:05:30] to get out of the way that you'd close
[1:05:32] our mouth Lord uh uh where you would
[1:05:36] close it that you would open it where
[1:05:37] you would open it I pray Lord that you
[1:05:39] would speak to our hearts you would
[1:05:41] teach us whatever it is that we're
[1:05:42] hearing and father that you would make
[1:05:44] it live that you would make it manifest
[1:05:47] I pray Lord that you'd meet each and
[1:05:48] every need every hand that was lifted in
[1:05:50] the building this morning I pray that
[1:05:51] you would meet every need and Lord we'll
[1:05:53] just go ahead ahead and thank you for it
[1:05:55] ahead of time because you're faithful
[1:05:57] and it's an honor and it's a privilege
[1:05:59] Lord to uh bring our requests and our
[1:06:03] needs before you knowing Lord that it is
[1:06:05] your good pleasure to do these things
[1:06:07] bless each and everyone Lord as we give
[1:06:09] you praise and honor and Glory those
[1:06:10] that are out sick those that are
[1:06:12] listening in Lord we ask that you'd
[1:06:14] bless them as well we love you and we
[1:06:16] thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[1:06:18] amen amen you may be
[1:06:20] seated so I want to title the thought
[1:06:23] here for
[1:06:24] next few minutes it's actually my title
[1:06:27] is going to be a question here this
[1:06:28] morning and I want you to think about it
[1:06:30] and the question is does the Lord delay
[1:06:33] his promise does the Lord delay his
[1:06:37] promise so we know that we're living in
[1:06:40] a time when many Christian churches are
[1:06:43] they're looking for the second coming of
[1:06:45] the lord it's not just us that are
[1:06:46] looking they were looking in the early
[1:06:49] 1900s they were looking in the 1800s uh
[1:06:52] they were looking for the resurrection
[1:06:54] of those that sleep in Christ and for
[1:06:57] the Rapture of the church and and
[1:06:59] there's been a looking for and an
[1:07:02] anticipation for his coming by many
[1:07:04] churches now for a 100 plus years and in
[1:07:08] that time frame we've seen Israel go
[1:07:11] from being a nation that was scattered
[1:07:13] across the globe uh uh to to being
[1:07:16] almost completely wiped out in Europe
[1:07:19] and and we've seen her come back into
[1:07:21] her own Homeland once again she's flying
[1:07:24] her own flag she's minting her own
[1:07:26] currency by her own government we've had
[1:07:29] two great Wars one of them was called
[1:07:32] the Great War and the other was called
[1:07:34] the war to end all wars but as you know
[1:07:37] it didn't end all wars did it the fig
[1:07:40] tree has put forth its Branch we like to
[1:07:42] quote that we like to focus on that but
[1:07:44] if you look at Luke's account Luke said
[1:07:46] when the Fig Tree brings forth its
[1:07:48] branch and all the other trees we've
[1:07:51] seen all these other nations come
[1:07:53] forward
[1:07:54] uh uh that uh as Nations have split up
[1:07:57] and we've got all these different uh
[1:07:59] names of all these other countries uh
[1:08:02] there's been Wars there's been rumors of
[1:08:03] wars men's hearts are failing literally
[1:08:07] for fear and men are turned to men and
[1:08:11] women to women with unnatural affection
[1:08:14] the spirit of leosa the focus on
[1:08:17] people's rights it's penetrated just
[1:08:19] about every cracken corner of the globe
[1:08:21] and it has to before uh the coming of
[1:08:24] the Lord but the word of the Lord also
[1:08:26] has to the the spirit of Christ also has
[1:08:29] to permeate uh uh and and find every
[1:08:33] seed wherever it might be whatever
[1:08:35] Nation it's in there's a union of
[1:08:37] Nations that's been formed to create a
[1:08:39] new world order of man there's a World
[1:08:43] Council of churches that's been formed
[1:08:45] and the stated goal is to unite all face
[1:08:48] together earthquakes are taking place on
[1:08:51] a scale and a frequency unknown until
[1:08:54] this age famines and plagues and
[1:08:56] disasters they are so common that they
[1:08:59] hardly shock us for more than a few days
[1:09:02] and then the next one comes perilous
[1:09:05] times have come when uh uh as as we read
[1:09:08] in second Timothy perilous times have
[1:09:10] come when men are lovers of themselves
[1:09:14] they are Covetous they are boasters
[1:09:16] they're proud they're blasphemers
[1:09:18] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[1:09:21] without natural affection truth
[1:09:26] Breakers truce Breakers false accusers
[1:09:29] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[1:09:31] that are good traitors heady high-minded
[1:09:34] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:09:37] God they claim to love God but they love
[1:09:39] pleasure more than God having a form of
[1:09:41] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:09:44] from such we are told to turn away this
[1:09:47] day this scripture is being fulfilled
[1:09:49] they are ever learning and yet never
[1:09:52] able to come to the knowled of the truth
[1:09:55] and as Janice and jambus withstood Moses
[1:09:57] so do these also resist the truth men of
[1:10:00] corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the
[1:10:03] faith 2 Timothy 3
[1:10:06] 1-8 and the long awaited restoration of
[1:10:09] the church that was prophesied by the
[1:10:11] Old Testament prophet in Joel chapter 2
[1:10:14] is coming to pass the revealing of the
[1:10:17] son of man in Luke 17:30 is taking place
[1:10:20] under conditions that were just like
[1:10:23] like they were in the days of Sodom and
[1:10:25] in the days of Noah the Seven Seals of
[1:10:28] Revelation chap 6 have been removed from
[1:10:30] the books how many believe that which is
[1:10:33] now the open Book of Revelation CH 5 and
[1:10:36] we see in Revelation chap 10 that this
[1:10:38] little open book comes down in the hand
[1:10:41] of the mighty angel of his own Covenant
[1:10:43] a rainbow over his head signifying a
[1:10:46] covenant uh which is Christ himself that
[1:10:48] the affinite Christ we know that
[1:10:50] Revelation chapter 9 Satan was cast out
[1:10:53] of Heaven once once again he was cast
[1:10:54] out of man's position and he was given
[1:10:57] the the keys to the bottomless pit
[1:10:59] apolon is what he's called and uh
[1:11:02] 200,000,000 which is 200 million demons
[1:11:05] have been released they're driving
[1:11:06] Israel back into her Homeland they're
[1:11:08] now going to turn and and come against
[1:11:10] the spiritual bride and drive us into
[1:11:13] our homeland of the word uh and and so
[1:11:16] all these things are are taking place
[1:11:19] all of these things are being fulfilled
[1:11:21] the Lord himself has spirit descended
[1:11:24] from heaven with a shout with a message
[1:11:26] with the voice of the Archangel and will
[1:11:28] soon sound forth the Trump of God first
[1:11:31] Thessalonians 4 ver verse 16 the prophet
[1:11:34] of Malachi 4 has turned the hearts of
[1:11:37] the children back to the faith of the
[1:11:39] apostolic fathers has he done that
[1:11:41] forerunning the second coming of the
[1:11:43] Lord uh uh and yet the Bible tells us
[1:11:46] that in spite of all of these biblical
[1:11:49] prophecies being fulfilled in our days
[1:11:52] many will say where is the promise of
[1:11:54] his coming it's like where you been yeah
[1:11:57] right where is the promise of his coming
[1:12:00] some will then begin to Smite others
[1:12:03] thinking that the Lord delays his coming
[1:12:06] but Bible readers know that God makes
[1:12:09] promises and that there's always a delay
[1:12:13] in Man's eyes before the Fulfillment of
[1:12:15] that promise and God does it on purpose
[1:12:18] he promised Israel that he would raise
[1:12:20] up a deliverer to take Israel out from
[1:12:22] Egypt and it was fulfilled 40 plus years
[1:12:26] later than they expect it to be and then
[1:12:29] another 40 years passed by because the
[1:12:31] people weren't ready the prophecy
[1:12:34] concerning a a seed being given to a
[1:12:37] woman was first prophesied in the Garden
[1:12:39] of Eden and then Isaiah prophesied again
[1:12:43] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:12:45] years later saying a virgin shall
[1:12:46] conceive and bring forth the Messiah and
[1:12:50] it was hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:12:52] more before that promise came to pass
[1:12:55] and it's during the time of delay
[1:12:57] friends that human beings become
[1:12:59] impatient we say God give me patience
[1:13:04] right
[1:13:05] now right we want instant answers yeah
[1:13:08] we've got instant this and instant that
[1:13:11] we got fast food uh if you drive up into
[1:13:14] a fast food line and they say I'm sorry
[1:13:17] sir it's going to take five more minutes
[1:13:19] to the french fries aren't ready people
[1:13:21] will have a heart attack I don't want to
[1:13:23] wait 5 minutes could you pull over here
[1:13:25] you're going to have to wait five it's
[1:13:26] such an age of
[1:13:28] impatience and and uh so it's during the
[1:13:32] time of delay that human beings become
[1:13:36] impatient so we want instant answers to
[1:13:39] our prayers well I prayed and I asked
[1:13:41] God to do this and it didn't happen and
[1:13:43] so uh uh Faith just sits there and uh uh
[1:13:47] fear and worry and doubt all these other
[1:13:49] things come in when Faith should be
[1:13:51] waiting for the promise and patience
[1:13:54] will be the reward of that Faith so God
[1:13:58] promises but he does not tell us exactly
[1:14:00] when the promise will be fulfilled isn't
[1:14:02] that right friends God exists outside of
[1:14:05] time uh uh if he says it that settles it
[1:14:09] and Satan knows this this very principle
[1:14:12] of God very well and he knows that
[1:14:14] Satan's best opportunity to inject
[1:14:17] himself into the picture is during the
[1:14:19] time of a delay God always makes a
[1:14:23] promise and that he waits to see who's
[1:14:25] going to be patient he waits to see
[1:14:28] who's going to believe he waits to see
[1:14:30] who's going to wait for the Fulfillment
[1:14:32] of the promise knowing that it cannot
[1:14:35] fail you know the highest compliment
[1:14:37] that you can pay God is to take him out
[1:14:39] his
[1:14:41] word in the Garden of Eden Eve couldn't
[1:14:45] wait in the time of the delay God told
[1:14:48] Adam he said multiply replenish or
[1:14:51] restock the Earth take Dominion over the
[1:14:53] Earth and God never makes a promise that
[1:14:56] he fails then to to come to pass and if
[1:14:59] he if he uh gave this directive there
[1:15:02] had to be a fulfillment of it right and
[1:15:05] there had to be a way provided for that
[1:15:07] to be fulfilled so this is what actually
[1:15:10] separates the True Believers that hear
[1:15:13] from God and trust God and patiently
[1:15:16] wait on God from the make Believers and
[1:15:18] from the
[1:15:19] unbelievers you see the makeb Believers
[1:15:22] they will wait for a
[1:15:24] season uh when the promise and the move
[1:15:26] of God is new it's uh you know it's
[1:15:29] exciting and uh it's something different
[1:15:33] and people are are stirred up but when
[1:15:36] the excitement and the newness is over
[1:15:39] the honeymoon is over they grow tired
[1:15:43] and they grow bored and they show that
[1:15:45] they never really had Faith to begin
[1:15:48] with they were caught in the NIT if you
[1:15:50] will remember the parable there's in
[1:15:52] Matthew Matthew 13 there's seven
[1:15:54] Parables and actually you could do a
[1:15:56] study on that and it covers the seven
[1:15:58] Church ages but Jesus told them the
[1:16:00] parable that his disciples and us also
[1:16:03] he told them the parable of the Gospel
[1:16:04] net that the net would be cast out and
[1:16:07] then it would be brought in and all
[1:16:10] kinds of things would be caught in that
[1:16:11] net but you weren't trying to catch all
[1:16:14] kinds of things you were trying to catch
[1:16:15] that rainbow trout that Covenant trout
[1:16:18] right brother brandom talks about it and
[1:16:21] sometimes he makes statements that
[1:16:23] you know I have to go and look up in an
[1:16:25] encyclopedia or look up in a dictionary
[1:16:27] because I'm not familiar with the terms
[1:16:29] even though uh my parents grew up in
[1:16:31] that part of the country so brother
[1:16:33] Brown said you throw out the gospel net
[1:16:36] You Pull It in he says you get you get
[1:16:38] eels and crabs and lobsters and and he
[1:16:42] says that they they get caught in the
[1:16:43] net and then they just crawl right back
[1:16:45] out where they were at right and he uses
[1:16:48] this term uh many times hell diver
[1:16:52] anybody ever heard of that word he says
[1:16:54] and and Hell divers and I'm thinking
[1:16:56] what is a hell diver uh I want to find
[1:16:59] out what a hell diver is and I want to
[1:17:01] make sure I'm not a hell diver so I I I
[1:17:04] did a little it's it's a bird it's a
[1:17:06] bird like a like a duck or one of these
[1:17:09] other kind of birds and this bird will
[1:17:11] it's built in a certain way that it can
[1:17:13] come down into the water and smack into
[1:17:16] that water not break itself up and and
[1:17:18] it can dive real deep I guess that's
[1:17:21] where hell diver comes from it's D to
[1:17:23] hell it can dive real deep and get
[1:17:26] something and then bring it up but you
[1:17:29] don't want to catch that in your net
[1:17:31] you're trying to catch fish right so
[1:17:34] brother bam expounds on that says
[1:17:36] there's all kinds of things that'll get
[1:17:38] caught but you're not trying to catch
[1:17:39] them you're trying to catch that that
[1:17:42] rainbow trout that Covenant trout that
[1:17:44] that what what it is that you're fishing
[1:17:46] for other words right so all these other
[1:17:50] things will be caught in it there was a
[1:17:51] mixed multitude in the first first
[1:17:53] Exodus out of Egypt we know it has to be
[1:17:55] that way we didn't write the script we
[1:17:58] don't assign the parts but we know
[1:17:59] somebody's going to play those parts so
[1:18:01] you just recognize and part of it is so
[1:18:03] that you don't get all tore up and uh uh
[1:18:07] Jesus had to tell us disciples you know
[1:18:09] you're going to go out and preach the
[1:18:10] gospel and you're going to pull people
[1:18:12] in and some of them are going to come
[1:18:13] against you some are going to crawl
[1:18:16] right back where they came from some
[1:18:18] will be family members they get caught
[1:18:19] in the net and since they're they came
[1:18:22] in with the family members now they're
[1:18:24] miserable but they can't go back and
[1:18:26] they're not comfortable where they're at
[1:18:28] so they'll just make everybody else
[1:18:29] miserable and so Jesus wanted them to
[1:18:32] know because they're going to wonder
[1:18:33] well you know we preached and they came
[1:18:35] in but it's not working for them what's
[1:18:37] what's going on and he had to explain to
[1:18:40] them oh they're not all uh the ones that
[1:18:43] you're fishing for that some will get
[1:18:44] caught we don't wish that on anybody but
[1:18:47] it just it's it somebody's going to
[1:18:49] fulfill those parts right just I don't
[1:18:51] want it to be me that's right so when
[1:18:55] the newness is is is over and they they
[1:18:59] they grow tired they grow bored uh
[1:19:01] showing that they never had Faith to
[1:19:03] begin with that they were caught in the
[1:19:05] gospel net when the dry times come uh
[1:19:09] when things are quiet when when uh
[1:19:12] Abraham and lot when the the contention
[1:19:15] rose up between their herdsman it was a
[1:19:17] dry time there hadn't been a whole lot
[1:19:19] going on and lot's testimony was Abraham
[1:19:23] said that God said Abraham said that God
[1:19:25] said Abraham said that God said but lot
[1:19:28] never heard it himself and in the dry
[1:19:31] times then you start to question and
[1:19:33] wonder you know maybe I should go off
[1:19:36] and do something else so the dry times
[1:19:39] come when things are quiet the newness
[1:19:41] is worn off and the first generation of
[1:19:44] Believers begin to go off into the grave
[1:19:48] and the persecutions and the ridicule
[1:19:50] then begin to follow but Satan Works off
[1:19:54] of our impatience are you with me this
[1:19:56] morning so from Genesis 1:
[1:20:00] 28 we read and God blessed them and God
[1:20:03] said unto them be fruitful multiply
[1:20:06] replenish the Earth subdue it have
[1:20:08] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[1:20:10] over the fowl of the air and over every
[1:20:12] living thing that moveth upon the Earth
[1:20:16] that that includes creeps everything
[1:20:18] that creepeth
[1:20:20] right so this is a promise this is a
[1:20:23] spoken word uh but there's no time
[1:20:26] element that's put on the Fulfillment of
[1:20:28] this but it has to be
[1:20:30] fulfilled God's word has to come to pass
[1:20:34] God didn't change his plan when Satan
[1:20:37] entered into the picture God knew that
[1:20:39] Satan was entering into the picture the
[1:20:42] plan included that so we find that Eve
[1:20:45] got impatient and Satan took advantage
[1:20:48] of this impatience he told Eve uh you
[1:20:52] know we we both know that God said to
[1:20:54] multiply but uh the reason it hasn't
[1:20:57] happened yet is well you haven't been
[1:21:00] taught how this is going to take place
[1:21:02] and your husband you know he he's kind
[1:21:04] of
[1:21:05] slow God's going to be mad at him before
[1:21:07] he knows it you know because you're
[1:21:09] supposed to be multiplying and so he's
[1:21:12] he's working on her and working on her
[1:21:15] uh uh he's saying you're husband is not
[1:21:17] being obedient so you need to take the
[1:21:20] Reigns before God gets upset
[1:21:23] you know I'm almost convinced that in
[1:21:25] the womb when uh I do believe in the Y
[1:21:28] chromosome and the X chromosome uh uh
[1:21:32] people can deny nature if they want they
[1:21:35] can say well I'm confused about what sex
[1:21:38] I am well just let me scrape off some of
[1:21:40] your cells put it under the microscope
[1:21:42] and I don't think I even need to do that
[1:21:44] unless you unless you've already altered
[1:21:47] your body but but I mean this is not
[1:21:49] rocket science right
[1:21:53] if if there wasn't an Adam and an eve if
[1:21:55] it was left to an
[1:21:57] opinion and and they decided not to uh
[1:22:01] follow God's plan we wouldn't be
[1:22:05] here
[1:22:09] so he then told her perhaps a story
[1:22:12] about the birds and the bees and uh
[1:22:15] explaining to her how two of each
[1:22:17] species multiplies and and when it came
[1:22:19] to the man he no doubt spoke to her
[1:22:22] through the serpent and told her how he
[1:22:25] could show her how this would take place
[1:22:27] brother Brown said that he was wise in
[1:22:30] the things pertaining to
[1:22:32] life and then she could then go educate
[1:22:36] her husband on these matters and Satan
[1:22:39] told her that the delay was due to her
[1:22:43] ignorance and he set about to be her
[1:22:46] school teacher we friends we that's what
[1:22:50] that's what causes a lot of uh tangent
[1:22:52] doctrines to rise up uh somebody's
[1:22:56] coming forth with an answer nothing's
[1:22:58] going on so this must be the answer and
[1:23:00] then they'll try to scare you into
[1:23:02] believing that and they'll say well this
[1:23:04] is our explanation what is yours I don't
[1:23:07] need one I'm just waiting I don't have
[1:23:09] to have the answers I'm just staying
[1:23:11] with him so uh
[1:23:16] uh he told her I'll show you this then
[1:23:19] you can now go and educate your husband
[1:23:21] on these matters
[1:23:23] so Satan told her the delay was due to
[1:23:26] her ignorance and he set about to be her
[1:23:29] school teacher so Eve had the right kind
[1:23:32] of a desire to have children but where
[1:23:35] she missed God was when she failed to
[1:23:38] wait on the promise and God's
[1:23:40] fulfillment of that promise she missed
[1:23:42] God's
[1:23:43] timing she should have never stopped for
[1:23:46] a moment to listen to
[1:23:48] Satan Adam should have never left her
[1:23:50] side she should have said God made me a
[1:23:54] promise and his word cannot fail and it
[1:23:58] will be fulfilled in due
[1:24:00] season so I was going to say here a
[1:24:02] moment ago I believe that when the cells
[1:24:05] divide and whatever and it turns out
[1:24:07] there's a y chromosome which means
[1:24:09] you're going to be a male or if you have
[1:24:12] an X and A Y X from your mother a y from
[1:24:14] your father you'll be a male if you have
[1:24:16] two ex chromosomes you'll be a female
[1:24:18] and uh uh in that sex chromosome uh I
[1:24:22] think that when it when it's the male
[1:24:26] chromosome I think uh uh something
[1:24:29] happens in a bunch of brain cells die
[1:24:32] because it's going to be a male right
[1:24:33] because women are quicker than
[1:24:36] men women are uh and they're like get
[1:24:40] after it come on and they're just
[1:24:42] they're just ready to jump in well he's
[1:24:44] not doing it and if I don't jump in it
[1:24:46] ain't going to happen and he just
[1:24:49] appears to be Dumber in a door knob and
[1:24:51] he's just you know he he ain't never
[1:24:53] going to get around well I told you I
[1:24:54] was going to get around to it yeah but
[1:24:57] when so she this is the impatience that
[1:25:00] that is working up in her and
[1:25:05] uh but her impatience caused her to stop
[1:25:09] long enough to listen and to reason and
[1:25:12] that's where we get into trouble she
[1:25:14] didn't have faith in the promise that
[1:25:17] God had given to her and her husband but
[1:25:20] Faith patiently waits for the promise to
[1:25:23] be
[1:25:24] fulfilled hope holds on for a time
[1:25:27] brother B said Hope and Faith are are
[1:25:30] twin sisters right now they're not
[1:25:32] identical twins because hope is actually
[1:25:35] prettier than Faith right so they're
[1:25:38] what do they call that uh fraternal
[1:25:40] twins hope is prettier uh than Faith
[1:25:45] Hope says I hope I win the lottery is
[1:25:48] that a sweet thought oh and you know
[1:25:51] when I live when I win the lottery I'm
[1:25:53] going to give Uncle so and so a million
[1:25:54] and I'm going to give Dad 5 million I'm
[1:25:56] going to give this and that the other
[1:25:58] and you're not even you never gave
[1:26:00] nobody nothing but all of a sudden
[1:26:03] you're
[1:26:04] generous that's hope right brother
[1:26:07] brandham said faith on the other hand he
[1:26:09] says she has hair on her chest and big
[1:26:14] muscles and faith is confessing what
[1:26:17] hope is hoping for but cannot see
[1:26:21] Hallelujah and and faith will wait
[1:26:23] patiently for the promise hope will hold
[1:26:26] on for a time hope is real sweet hope is
[1:26:30] real uh nice hope is real pretty but
[1:26:33] without faith hope then gets weak and
[1:26:36] hope gets weary and hope gets impatient
[1:26:39] we're not against hope but hope without
[1:26:41] faith cannot endure amen amen it will
[1:26:45] eventually fail if that hope is not
[1:26:48] mixed with faith so Satan tells her sure
[1:26:53] God will move for this one and God will
[1:26:55] move for that one but he's not going to
[1:26:57] do it for you does he tell us those
[1:26:59] things friends so today the promise of
[1:27:02] the coming of the Lord Jesus is it's
[1:27:04] given to the Believers uh in the Lord
[1:27:07] Jesus Believers in his word so we know
[1:27:10] that many of the people that are living
[1:27:12] today they will not be tested and tried
[1:27:15] by this seeming delay because they're
[1:27:17] not even looking for his coming it is
[1:27:19] those that have heard the message or the
[1:27:22] shout behold the bridegroom cometh arise
[1:27:25] and trim your lamps go ye out to meet
[1:27:29] them they are the ones that will be
[1:27:30] tested yes and they will be tested and
[1:27:33] they will be tried and they will be
[1:27:35] proven the bride will prove that she is
[1:27:38] faithful the bride will prove that she
[1:27:41] has has the patience and the endurance
[1:27:44] and the faithfulness to wait during the
[1:27:46] delay and the people said amen blessed
[1:27:50] be his wonderful name so the question
[1:27:51] for us us today is can we Faithfully
[1:27:55] wait so Eve was supposed to wait but
[1:27:59] instead she mingled her husband's seed
[1:28:01] with the seed of the serpent but the
[1:28:03] true church in this hour friends is
[1:28:05] going to believe God's word and they're
[1:28:08] going to believe God's word alone and
[1:28:11] the church that Christ said that he
[1:28:12] would build uh will believe and will
[1:28:15] stay true and will be ready uh for the
[1:28:19] time when this is completely fulfilled
[1:28:22] amen and she will patiently wait for it
[1:28:25] spoken word is the Original Seed brother
[1:28:27] Brown says Eve would have finally
[1:28:29] brought forth that child brought that
[1:28:30] child forth but she hybrid it brought
[1:28:34] the serpent in listening for wisdom and
[1:28:36] understanding and knowledge you know
[1:28:39] things can sound so reasonable that
[1:28:41] happened at the at the turn of our
[1:28:43] century when uh uh There Was An Open
[1:28:46] Door that was put before the church and
[1:28:49] uh the name of Jesus Christ was brought
[1:28:51] back and you could come in through that
[1:28:54] door and receive a a true birth 1906 and
[1:28:58] that door came open and it was only
[1:29:01] open uh for eight short Years brother
[1:29:05] Brown said it they organized by 1914 men
[1:29:09] got together and they said you know
[1:29:10] there's fanaticism and there's this and
[1:29:12] there's that and we want to bring some
[1:29:14] of the rich people in and you know the
[1:29:17] the people that are caught up in this or
[1:29:19] they don't know their left hand from
[1:29:20] their right and they don't Dr right and
[1:29:22] all that we want to be able to bring all
[1:29:24] these other people in and in their own
[1:29:26] minds they think they're doing God a
[1:29:28] service in their own mind they think
[1:29:31] they're doing something that's good but
[1:29:33] they killed it they put their hand to it
[1:29:36] and and it just choked it off for so
[1:29:39] many of the people and so uh we don't
[1:29:43] want to put our hands to something we
[1:29:44] want to patiently wait for the
[1:29:46] promise so Satan worked on Eve during
[1:29:50] the delay I don't know how long it would
[1:29:53] have been before uh they would have
[1:29:55] brought forth as God said that they were
[1:29:58] going to bring forth but they would have
[1:30:01] it was in the time of 120 years of Noah
[1:30:04] that people began to question the
[1:30:06] promise of God uh concerning the
[1:30:08] destruction of the earth and the life
[1:30:11] that was on the earth with the flood of
[1:30:12] water Noah was a preacher and he began
[1:30:16] preaching it's going to rain yes now
[1:30:18] friends we've got over 1,200 tapes they
[1:30:20] had one tape yeah right for 120
[1:30:24] years he preached that message over and
[1:30:27] over and over and over and it never
[1:30:30] changed Hallelujah people wanted to
[1:30:32] polish it up take it this direction well
[1:30:34] this is what he meant by what he said no
[1:30:36] he said it's going to rain he said the
[1:30:38] word of the Lord it hasn't happened yet
[1:30:41] it will just wait it's going to rain
[1:30:43] it's going to rain his message never
[1:30:45] changed it never got popular it never
[1:30:48] got exciting uh no matter how much time
[1:30:51] time went by it was the same message he
[1:30:54] never lost his vision along the way even
[1:30:57] during the dry times of the delay is
[1:31:00] somebody listening this morning it's
[1:31:03] going to rain it's going to rain make
[1:31:05] your
[1:31:06] preparations uh get into God's provided
[1:31:10] place of safety and there's only one
[1:31:12] place of safety so at first friends
[1:31:15] there were many that listened and there
[1:31:18] were many that perhaps hung around the
[1:31:20] ark now and and just in case maybe they
[1:31:24] talked things over with Noah maybe they
[1:31:26] tried to show how spiritual they were
[1:31:28] maybe they said well maybe he meant this
[1:31:30] when he said that and so on and so forth
[1:31:32] but brother Brown said they kind of hung
[1:31:34] around just in case they weren't ready
[1:31:37] to jump in with both feet but you know
[1:31:39] you never know kind of like crossing
[1:31:41] your fingers you know so uh uh at first
[1:31:45] there were many that listened many that
[1:31:47] hung around the ark for periods of time
[1:31:50] maybe there were some date setters
[1:31:51] amongst them because we've always had
[1:31:53] them right uh and uh that they set a
[1:31:56] date and that date came and went as they
[1:32:00] always do you ever notice how people
[1:32:02] don't repent of that they just go off
[1:32:04] onto another date something
[1:32:08] else no doubt there were sign Seekers
[1:32:11] because there are sign seekers in every
[1:32:12] age but the only true sign friends was
[1:32:15] Noah and his message and the provided
[1:32:18] place of safety coming to completion
[1:32:22] right others no doubt said yeah yeah we
[1:32:25] believe it's going to rain so we will
[1:32:28] build our own arcs of
[1:32:30] safety and they did Brother Bram said
[1:32:34] but only Noah was built according to the
[1:32:37] specifications of God's word and that
[1:32:39] was God's provided place of safety amen
[1:32:43] and that's where God chose to place his
[1:32:45] name when the floods came and that's
[1:32:47] where he would meet you is where he
[1:32:49] placed his name so the Believers believe
[1:32:51] believe the makeb believer did not
[1:32:54] believe with faith and the unbeliever
[1:32:57] did not believe at all but guess what
[1:33:00] friends everybody was a Believer when
[1:33:03] the flood waters
[1:33:05] appeared right that's and the only
[1:33:08] difference between Noah and the person
[1:33:10] outside of there were a lot of nice
[1:33:12] people that drowned there were people
[1:33:14] that are crying screaming let me in but
[1:33:17] Noah didn't shut the door God did right
[1:33:20] so Noah couldn't open the door they had
[1:33:23] their chance they said we believe let us
[1:33:25] in there were cries and shrieks there
[1:33:28] were nice people out there there's a lot
[1:33:30] of nice people out there the the Rich
[1:33:32] Young Ruler was a nice
[1:33:34] man there were nice people the
[1:33:37] difference between Noah and that person
[1:33:39] was which side of the door he was
[1:33:42] on that's right he was taking God at his
[1:33:47] word so that's where God chose to place
[1:33:50] his name in the fledge came came and God
[1:33:52] proved it God Vindicated it and
[1:33:54] everybody became a Believer the
[1:33:57] scripture says uh uh there'll come a
[1:33:59] time when every knee will bow every
[1:34:01] tongue will confess Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:34:05] I Want My Confession to be now I don't
[1:34:07] want it to be when it's too late when
[1:34:10] everybody else does
[1:34:13] hallelujah so imagine after
[1:34:17] preaching this message it's going to
[1:34:19] rain for about a hundred years one tape
[1:34:24] one you know we've got 1,200 and
[1:34:28] uh I know myself you know you're
[1:34:31] listening to a message over again and
[1:34:34] you can you can almost quote it word for
[1:34:37] word yeah right you can stutter where he
[1:34:40] stuttered or or make a you know say and
[1:34:42] and and I'm not being critical I'm just
[1:34:44] telling you you can get so familiar with
[1:34:47] it that that you have it memorized
[1:34:50] nothing wrong with that right right but
[1:34:52] this is one
[1:34:53] tape this is one message so I'm quite
[1:34:57] sure after a hundred years they had that
[1:35:00] memorized
[1:35:02] right but how many
[1:35:04] believed so imagine if you will Noah has
[1:35:08] preached this for a hundred years and
[1:35:10] somebody who missed church for maybe the
[1:35:12] last 60 years shows up for service comes
[1:35:15] into church one morning and Noah gets up
[1:35:18] behind the pulpit his his hair is like
[1:35:21] mine and he's maybe got a beard and
[1:35:23] maybe maybe he's got a cane maybe he's
[1:35:25] getting a little bit older and and so
[1:35:27] Noah gets up into the pulpit and he says
[1:35:29] you know I got up this morning and uh uh
[1:35:32] I heard the birds singing and uh I heard
[1:35:35] the wind blowing and uh uh blowing
[1:35:37] through the trees and he's starting to
[1:35:39] get a little
[1:35:40] bit the spirit is starting to strike him
[1:35:43] and then he says and then something
[1:35:44] reminded me it's going to rain it's
[1:35:47] going to rain it's going to rain and
[1:35:50] Noah just about had a f
[1:35:52] and the guy that said I've heard this
[1:35:54] for you know I missed 60 years and
[1:35:56] you're still getting excited about that
[1:35:59] he's staring at him thinking what is the
[1:36:00] matter with that guy he's finally went
[1:36:02] mentally
[1:36:03] ill no about had a fit and the believer
[1:36:07] said amen Pastor amen we believe it God
[1:36:12] said it we believe it listen friends we
[1:36:15] are not weary in well-doing I don't care
[1:36:18] what anybody else says I don't have to
[1:36:20] prove anything to anybody God will prove
[1:36:22] his
[1:36:23] word blessed be his wonderful name so we
[1:36:27] know that God is Not slack concerning
[1:36:29] his promises he just has his own timing
[1:36:32] of things and we know that he's coming
[1:36:36] and we are proclaiming it from the
[1:36:37] rooftops no matter what anybody else
[1:36:39] says and no matter how tired they're
[1:36:41] getting and all around the world it's
[1:36:44] the same thing we're not saying
[1:36:45] something different it hasn't changed
[1:36:47] he's coming he's coming get ready trim
[1:36:50] your lamp
[1:36:51] go out to meet them in every nation to
[1:36:55] every Kindred to every tongue to every
[1:36:57] people the same thing we're prophesying
[1:37:00] again we're saying he's coming soon
[1:37:03] we're saying arise trim your lamps get
[1:37:07] extra oil make yourself ready because
[1:37:10] he's coming go ye out to meet him we're
[1:37:14] not losing faith in the time of the
[1:37:16] delay our faith is actually growing
[1:37:20] because we believe in him right we are
[1:37:22] getting stronger Amen in the message
[1:37:25] presuming brother Brown said no it's
[1:37:27] time they thought now if it does come
[1:37:30] why now if it does come a big rain well
[1:37:33] there's never never has been one but if
[1:37:35] they do why we we got ships and boats
[1:37:40] wow so we have a message right well now
[1:37:44] there's other people that have a message
[1:37:46] right it's just not the same as ours
[1:37:49] they've modifi it's the new and improved
[1:37:51] mod
[1:37:51] mod right and they're smarter than you
[1:37:55] right they can explain theirs and they
[1:37:58] say well what's your explanation he's
[1:38:00] coming he's coming why now if he if he
[1:38:04] does come a big rain there's never been
[1:38:06] one but if they do why we've got our
[1:38:09] ships and boats you say well they didn't
[1:38:12] have them he says they did have them
[1:38:14] otherwise he couldn't say as it was in
[1:38:16] the days of
[1:38:17] Noah and Jesus said as it was in the
[1:38:20] days of Noah same kind they dig up the
[1:38:23] cities and things now that sunken and
[1:38:25] all the modern Waterworks that was right
[1:38:27] here in Mexico a few years ago and
[1:38:29] everything sure there's nothing new
[1:38:31] Under the Sun well we'll just ride our
[1:38:34] own ships they presume that they would
[1:38:37] be all right but God had one ship that
[1:38:40] was going to float how many believes
[1:38:42] that and the rest of them was going to
[1:38:44] sink but they presumed that their ship
[1:38:47] would last float any way that this thing
[1:38:51] would no matter whether it was
[1:38:53] scriptural made or not he says I could
[1:38:56] say something here listen that's the way
[1:38:59] today you think that thing will float
[1:39:03] it'll be all right whether it's
[1:39:04] scriptural or not it's got to be solid
[1:39:08] scripture
[1:39:10] amen so there were all kinds of churches
[1:39:14] but God only had one church God only had
[1:39:17] one boat God had only one place where he
[1:39:20] he identified
[1:39:21] with his name if you didn't like Noah's
[1:39:24] preaching in that day well you could get
[1:39:27] in another boat you know go to another
[1:39:30] church uh maybe one with a
[1:39:32] Starbucks you know we we've got a coffee
[1:39:35] machine in the and yeah people are
[1:39:38] smelling it during the service you know
[1:39:39] and they just we've got Gourmet Coffee
[1:39:43] you know and you can come wearing your
[1:39:44] birken stocks and uh you know just uh we

[1:39:52] rides out there for the kids and you
[1:39:54] know uh just just come and join us in
[1:39:56] our church a boat that had fewer
[1:40:00] requirements one that was easier to get
[1:40:03] into one that didn't have a pastor that
[1:40:06] held standards I'm thankful for pastors
[1:40:09] that hold standards amen one where you
[1:40:13] could come and go as you
[1:40:15] please There Was You
[1:40:18] know I I alluded to this one time out on
[1:40:21] the field and people come well where did
[1:40:23] brother bandam say that and where did
[1:40:25] where does it say that in the Bible I'm
[1:40:26] telling you I'm just dramatizing for a
[1:40:28] moment okay uh uh uh just imagine here
[1:40:32] for a moment there was maybe a Love Boat
[1:40:35] right uh where everybody well we just
[1:40:38] want to love right maybe there was
[1:40:41] another boat called the USS I think
[1:40:45] right and it's full of well I think this
[1:40:47] and I think that I don't even want what
[1:40:51] I think why would I excuse me why would
[1:40:54] I want what you think when I'm trying to
[1:40:56] get away from what I think I want his
[1:40:59] mind he's already thought it out I just
[1:41:03] want what he thinks cuz that's the only
[1:41:05] thing that's going to work that's right
[1:41:07] uh maybe there was a good Shi lollipop
[1:41:10] you know uh lollipops were given out to
[1:41:13] everybody they were never petted the
[1:41:14] wrong way how about this one the SS have
[1:41:17] it your
[1:41:19] way there was a I was telling your
[1:41:21] pastor here earlier I got d bramage
[1:41:24] That's short for brain damage these
[1:41:26] these commercials they they have these
[1:41:28] little jingles and they're brilliant
[1:41:29] because they they put uh uh words to
[1:41:32] songs and little catchy lyrics and they
[1:41:35] know it's going to stick in your head
[1:41:36] and you're going to get mad later on the
[1:41:38] day cuz you're trying to get it out of
[1:41:39] your head right now I'm going to put one
[1:41:43] in your head and then I'll pray for it
[1:41:44] to be delivered or you can pray for
[1:41:46] me but it it was a Burger King
[1:41:49] commercial hold the pickle hold the
[1:41:51] lettuce special orders don't upset us
[1:41:55] all we ask is that you let us have it
[1:41:57] your way have it your way at Burger King
[1:42:01] well that's what they want in church
[1:42:03] have it your way you ain't having it
[1:42:05] your way you're going to have it his way
[1:42:08] his way is
[1:42:10] right I don't want to have it my way I
[1:42:12] tried
[1:42:14] that that's misery I want his way his
[1:42:18] ways are best I'm glad he doesn't
[1:42:20] changes ways Hallelujah there was a a
[1:42:25] boat that was built and piloted by women
[1:42:28] preachers oh God thank you for keeping
[1:42:30] me off that boat that one in the I think
[1:42:33] boat I think that would have drove me
[1:42:35] crazy this one was was pink and it was
[1:42:38] soft and it smelled like roses instead
[1:42:41] of sheep and
[1:42:43] elephants there was one that had a flag
[1:42:45] up with six colors be careful with that
[1:42:47] friends a lot of times I've seen people
[1:42:50] forward things and they don't even
[1:42:52] realize it's a sixc colored flag and a
[1:42:54] sixc colored flag is the gay colors six
[1:42:57] is the number of man seven is God's
[1:42:59] colors it's a perversion so there was a
[1:43:03] boat that had the you know the six
[1:43:05] colors up there and uh uh uh saying and
[1:43:08] and they were saying well God won't sink
[1:43:10] this boat where have we heard that
[1:43:13] before but there was only one that would
[1:43:16] withstand the test and it was the one
[1:43:19] that was based on the word of the Lord
[1:43:20] Lord only and it didn't change over the
[1:43:23] it didn't get new and improved with the
[1:43:26] times it reminds me of the uh we
[1:43:29] probably are all familiar with the a
[1:43:31] ship called the RMS Titanic it sunk in
[1:43:35] ice water during its maiden voyage on
[1:43:38] April 15th 1912 tax
[1:43:41] day it was the largest passenger ship
[1:43:45] that had been built in Modern Times And
[1:43:47] and when it was first put into the water
[1:43:49] on May 31st and uh 1911 an employee of
[1:43:53] the White Star Line uh in Scotland said
[1:43:56] not even God himself can sink this ship
[1:43:59] can you imagine saying something so
[1:44:00] stupid excuse me I I don't mean to be
[1:44:03] rude but that is stupid isn't
[1:44:05] it even God
[1:44:08] himself couldn't sink this can you think
[1:44:10] of a better
[1:44:11] challenge so confident were the ship
[1:44:14] owners that they only had lifeboats that
[1:44:17] for they had 20 lifeboats uh on a ship
[1:44:20] in instead of 69 that was needed for the
[1:44:23] full ship of 2,228 that were on the ship
[1:44:26] 1,500 lives were lost
[1:44:29] yes others built boats during the
[1:44:32] delay Satan came to Noah Satan said you
[1:44:36] know what Noah you're not so thankful
[1:44:39] for the messages
[1:44:41] that the Oddball you know even just the
[1:44:44] titles of the messages are are messages
[1:44:47] right and brother BR says that's okay
[1:44:49] don't argue just agree I am a nut but
[1:44:53] agree that you're a nut that's threaded
[1:44:55] to a different bolt you're threaded to
[1:44:57] the word of
[1:44:58] God and then ask them who nut are you
[1:45:02] because we're all somebody's nut that's
[1:45:05] true whether they realize it or not so
[1:45:08] Satan says Noah you're a
[1:45:10] nut you're you're not the only one with
[1:45:13] the
[1:45:14] message and and besides that nobody's
[1:45:17] going to come Noah says yes they will
[1:45:21] Noah preached Noah made an altar
[1:45:24] call and nobody came and so he did it
[1:45:28] again and nobody came and so he did it
[1:45:30] again and nobody came and he did it
[1:45:32] again and again and again for 120 years
[1:45:35] amen and finally just his family came
[1:45:38] down to an oldfashioned altar and said
[1:45:40] we believe and we want God's mercy we
[1:45:44] want God's provided way he never got one
[1:45:48] more soul but he did give get an ark
[1:45:51] full of a bunch of
[1:45:53] animals and and the Animals evidently
[1:45:56] were more spiritual than the
[1:45:59] humans that heard Noah's message they
[1:46:02] just lined right on up walked right on
[1:46:05] in so every morning The Laughing would
[1:46:09] start this is in the delay now right the
[1:46:13] ship's about done there's not a much
[1:46:15] activity going on people are just
[1:46:17] laughing now and Noah kept putting the
[1:46:19] finishing touch is on the ark there's no
[1:46:22] evidence there's nobody to encourage him
[1:46:25] there's no big programs there's no big
[1:46:28] meetings taking place and more and more
[1:46:31] people are being born every day and yet
[1:46:34] you and I have a message and we have 66
[1:46:37] books of the Bible and we have countless
[1:46:40] lives that have been lived and more
[1:46:43] prophecy is being fulfilled in our day
[1:46:45] than in any other time on the face of
[1:46:48] the Earth so much so so that nominal
[1:46:51] churches are actually looking for his
[1:46:53] coming but they can't find the door
[1:46:56] because they've been blinded to the door
[1:46:57] by easy preaching right but you and I we
[1:47:01] have a five-fold Ministry and we've got
[1:47:03] lives that are matching the word we will
[1:47:05] be ready for his coming imagine if you
[1:47:08] will for a moment uh Abraham and Sarah
[1:47:11] each morning Sarah would get up she'd
[1:47:13] look in the mirror she'd see that she's
[1:47:15] getting older stoop shouldered maybe and
[1:47:17] she'd say Abraham are you sure Abraham
[1:47:20] are you sure she looks at her body she
[1:47:22] says to herself there's just no way that
[1:47:24] this could happen in the delay she's
[1:47:27] looking at the circumstances instead of
[1:47:29] the promise of God she looked at
[1:47:32] beautiful Hagar and she said uh maybe
[1:47:35] God wants to do it through this church
[1:47:37] maybe maybe this is the will of the Lord
[1:47:41] and look what that slightly doubted
[1:47:43] promise gave birth to something that you
[1:47:46] and I are still battling with
[1:47:49] today men manufactured revivals and all
[1:47:52] kinds of things so we are waiting for
[1:47:55] the rapture we are waiting for the
[1:47:57] coming of the Lord but people are
[1:47:59] getting weary I friends I've talked to I
[1:48:03] don't know how many ministers even that
[1:48:06] I've sat down and they got kind of shook
[1:48:08] up with the disbelieve the sign nonsense
[1:48:11] you know well I believed it until I
[1:48:13] didn't why would I have confidence in
[1:48:15] somebody that that was a a promoter of
[1:48:17] it that actually dedicated their lives
[1:48:20] and then they said n it's it's not true
[1:48:22] well why would I listen to you cuz
[1:48:24] you're saying that you were wrong how do
[1:48:26] I know you're not wrong now yeah let
[1:48:29] alone the fact that
[1:48:32] uh the whole point wasn't the sign the
[1:48:35] sign was to bring you to a voice right I
[1:48:39] I was telling your pastor we came up
[1:48:41] with a simple little thought for the
[1:48:43] home Church to just kind of illustrate
[1:48:45] this there's a town uh just just to the
[1:48:49] uh east of us we're close to the New
[1:48:51] Mexico border there's a town on the
[1:48:54] other side of that border and it's
[1:48:55] called
[1:48:55] Lordsburg there's a we have one
[1:48:57] Interstate freeway just one and and it's
[1:49:00] heading uh East there um and it's called
[1:49:03] the I 10 so what if I was to go get on
[1:49:06] the I 10 and I'm driving down the road
[1:49:08] and I see a sign and it says Lordsburg
[1:49:10] 100 miles I drive a little further
[1:49:13] Lordsburg 50 miles I drive a little
[1:49:15] further and guess what I'm in
[1:49:18] Lordsburg okay now I've been there for
[1:49:21] 30 years and now somebody comes and says
[1:49:24] brother Doug there was something wrong
[1:49:25] with that sign I'm going to say there's
[1:49:27] something wrong with your brain I'm here
[1:49:29] aren't I duh
[1:49:33] I'm I'm where I'm I'm where the sign was
[1:49:36] pointing me
[1:49:38] to notice they're not criticizing so
[1:49:41] brother random you know they're they're
[1:49:43] making kind of stories and nonsense
[1:49:45] about the cloud the only thing that I
[1:49:47] need to know and I believe is that he
[1:49:50] was there Angels showed up formed a
[1:49:53] cloud he was caught up wasn't thinking
[1:49:55] his own thoughts he was told go east the
[1:49:58] book is going to come open what happened
[1:50:00] he went East the book came open they're
[1:50:02] not disputing that they're smarter than
[1:50:05] you think because they don't have a leg
[1:50:07] to stand on the book did come open now
[1:50:10] they want to say well there was
[1:50:11] something wrong with the sign there's
[1:50:12] something wrong with your brain right
[1:50:15] the sign pointed you to a voice right I
[1:50:19] hear the voice yeah how many can say
[1:50:21] that I hear the
[1:50:24] voice
[1:50:26] Hallelujah people were getting weary in
[1:50:29] in uh Abraham's day
[1:50:32] and he Abraham would get up in the
[1:50:35] morning and he'd say Sarah we're going
[1:50:37] to have that baby are you working on the
[1:50:40] baby clothes and Sarah hears him and she
[1:50:43] thinks uh I wonder if Abraham's mind is
[1:50:45] slipping you know he's a nice guy but
[1:50:49] he's getting old so she mumbles to
[1:50:51] herself uh and Abraham says what Sarah
[1:50:55] and she says uh uh amen Abraham I think
[1:51:00] and he says Sarah you're not doubting
[1:51:01] are you now just as Eve was in Adam when
[1:51:06] God told Adam to multiply they were
[1:51:07] still in spirit form Sarah wasn't around
[1:51:11] when God told Abraham you're going to be
[1:51:13] the father of many nations oh of course
[1:51:16] she was there but God didn't say
[1:51:18] anything to Sarah when he was speaking
[1:51:20] speaking to Abraham yeah it was all
[1:51:21] about Abraham and Abraham's faith God
[1:51:25] didn't say at first that Sarah was going
[1:51:27] to be the
[1:51:28] mother so the Revelation for a period of
[1:51:31] time was centered entirely around
[1:51:34] Abraham first just as in our message it
[1:51:37] was sent around God sent a prophet so it
[1:51:40] was sent around centered around Abraham
[1:51:42] first but what about Sarah for years
[1:51:46] many have focused on as uh talk with
[1:51:49] your pastor about this God sent a
[1:51:50] prophet and it was rightfully so and we
[1:51:52] should have but why was he sent how do
[1:51:56] you fit into this right if you read
[1:51:59] Malachi 4 God says behold I that's him
[1:52:04] will send him Elijah to you so now
[1:52:08] there's three in that picture there's
[1:52:09] Elijah there's you and there's God and
[1:52:12] he will turn your heart back right so if
[1:52:17] it wasn't for you God wouldn't have sent
[1:52:19] Elijah he said Elijah to turn your
[1:52:22] heart you're the reason and at some
[1:52:26] point it has to center around you and
[1:52:28] it's not taking away from the prophet at
[1:52:29] all my heart couldn't be turned except
[1:52:33] God sent that
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:35] Prophet so the Revelation was centered
[1:52:39] entirely around Abraham first but now
[1:52:42] Sarah has to come into the
[1:52:44] picture behold I send you as we said so
[1:52:48] Satan used this is to try to make Sarah
[1:52:51] doubt she began to look at herself she
[1:52:55] thought this is all about
[1:52:57] Abraham I'm not even in this promise but
[1:53:01] then one day Abraham comes to the tent
[1:53:05] and Sarah talks to him about his promise
[1:53:08] again and maybe she says uh uh Abraham
[1:53:12] did did did he ever say anything about
[1:53:15] me and Abraham said well you know as a
[1:53:18] matter of fact he did just to
[1:53:21] you see he changed my name sweetheart
[1:53:23] from Abram to Abraham and he also
[1:53:26] changed your name from Seri to
[1:53:30] Sarah and she heard her name and she
[1:53:33] realized that she was a part of the
[1:53:35] promise and so God stood with his back
[1:53:38] to the tent and he said to Abraham where
[1:53:41] is Sarah thy wife so now Sarah is coming
[1:53:45] into the picture and he said why did
[1:53:47] Sarah laugh in her heart now friends she
[1:53:50] was a part of Abraham yes and she was a
[1:53:53] part of the Covenant Abraham had the
[1:53:55] Covenant she was part of him so God is
[1:53:58] going to keep her and she's and he's
[1:54:00] going to keep Abraham but what about
[1:54:02] Lot's wife she heard her grandchildren
[1:54:05] crying and she turned back and God
[1:54:09] turned her into a pillar of salt is that
[1:54:11] right and her heart had been turned away
[1:54:15] from Sodom but she heard something that
[1:54:18] allowed her heart to be turned turned
[1:54:20] back to
[1:54:21] Sodom she didn't even call God a liar
[1:54:24] she didn't say well I never laughed she
[1:54:27] didn't uh uh uh she didn't say I didn't
[1:54:29] laugh but This Woman's
[1:54:33] husband uh lot he did not have a
[1:54:36] covenant with God and she was a part of
[1:54:39] lot so that means she was without a
[1:54:41] covenant right his salvation was Works
[1:54:45] based only if you'll just do this won't
[1:54:47] there be a place for
[1:54:48] you so you and I we're not going in a
[1:54:52] Rapture because we're good Jesus they
[1:54:54] called him good Master he said don't
[1:54:56] call anybody good there's none good but
[1:54:59] God no flesh will glory in his presence
[1:55:03] we're not going in a Rapture because
[1:55:05] we're good well if I could just be good
[1:55:06] enough I remember thinking that myself I
[1:55:08] remember trying to do that and you find
[1:55:11] out more and more that you'll you in
[1:55:13] fact when you get to that point where
[1:55:15] you think you're good enough you find
[1:55:16] out things that you didn't even know
[1:55:18] were sinful that you're doing
[1:55:20] you don't even know unless God shows you
[1:55:23] right so we're going in the Rapture
[1:55:27] because our husband has been given a
[1:55:29] covenant so in Exodus chapter 32 quickly
[1:55:33] when we see uh uh we we the the people
[1:55:36] saw that Moses delayed his coming down
[1:55:38] from the mountain and so in that time of
[1:55:41] the delay they gathered priests to
[1:55:43] themselves and they demanded of those
[1:55:45] priests that they make unto them Gods
[1:55:48] because they knew not what happened to
[1:55:50] Moses and so Moses had brought them that
[1:55:53] far but he was nowhere to be found so
[1:55:56] God had called Moses up to the mountain
[1:55:59] and the people waited during the delay
[1:56:02] and you know there really wasn't much to
[1:56:04] do out there in the in the wilderness it
[1:56:06] wasn't the Mall of America or or excuse
[1:56:08] me of Disneyland or there wasn't much to
[1:56:11] do they they had separated from Egypt
[1:56:15] but nothing was going on now I felt that
[1:56:18] there's nothing wrong with M of America
[1:56:19] you can go okay that's not the point the
[1:56:22] point is they're out in the desert right
[1:56:25] I live in the desert so I know what
[1:56:27] that's like so they they spoke to the
[1:56:31] ministers and they said we want a God
[1:56:34] that we can
[1:56:35] worship during the delay there doesn't
[1:56:37] seem to be much going on can you kind of
[1:56:39] work something up for
[1:56:40] us but friends you and I don't want to
[1:56:43] worship a man we don't want to worship a
[1:56:46] Creed we don't want to worship a
[1:56:48] Doctrine we want to worship the living
[1:56:49] God and him only so Moses was in the
[1:56:54] very presence of God and God wrote with
[1:56:57] his finger on stones and when Moses came
[1:57:00] down he found that they were dancing he
[1:57:03] found that they were singing he found
[1:57:05] that they were worshiping nothing wrong
[1:57:08] with that just as they they had done
[1:57:10] that before right only now it's
[1:57:12] different gods that they're dancing
[1:57:14] before and Moses sees this and he's
[1:57:17] heartbroken these are still moses'
[1:57:20] followers but they're drunk and they're
[1:57:22] blind so in a fit of anger Moses throws
[1:57:25] down the stones during the time of the
[1:57:28] delay but God always has a people that
[1:57:31] are faithful all the way that's right
[1:57:33] amen there was a 400-year delay from
[1:57:37] Malachi to John the Baptist and they had
[1:57:40] turned to Creeds and they turned to
[1:57:42] dogmas and private interpretations
[1:57:44] friends they had more writings than
[1:57:46] there were Scrolls they had more sacred
[1:57:48] Legends I like to call them you know so
[1:57:50] and so said that so and so said that
[1:57:52] brother bham said that right after a
[1:57:55] while you don't know who said what but
[1:57:58] they become sacred Legend well I heard
[1:58:00] it on you know and this brother and he
[1:58:02] hunted with them and this and that and
[1:58:03] the other nothing wrong with that but if
[1:58:05] it ain't on tape I'm not
[1:58:07] interested well what if it's something
[1:58:09] important well then God would have told
[1:58:11] me right he wouldn't have hid it
[1:58:13] somewhere for some special little GL
[1:58:15] group to you know be exclusive over are
[1:58:18] you with me so uh there was a 400-year
[1:58:21] delay between Malachi and John the
[1:58:23] Baptist they turned to Creeds dogmas
[1:58:25] private
[1:58:26] interpretations they had gotten so far
[1:58:28] away from the prophecy that they missed
[1:58:31] John when he came the Forerunner just as
[1:58:33] the Lord said that they would and it was
[1:58:36] so bad brother Brown tells us that John
[1:58:38] had only six converts that were turned
[1:58:41] by his message after preaching 6 months
[1:58:44] you can read that in the message perfect
[1:58:46] Faith so the prophecy seemed like it was
[1:58:50] delayed Jesus said at the age of 12 I
[1:58:54] must be about my father's business but
[1:58:57] then we don't hear much about him until
[1:58:58] he was 30 well I thought you were going
[1:59:00] to be about your father's business right
[1:59:03] I'm not being critical friends there was
[1:59:05] a delay yes he was being molded he was
[1:59:08] being shaped just as Moses was and so
[1:59:12] much of what you and I go through we
[1:59:13] don't think it's important but it is we
[1:59:16] have to go through things we have to go
[1:59:19] through trials we have to be molded we
[1:59:21] have to be shaped to make us ready right
[1:59:24] amen so our trials many times will show
[1:59:27] us where our shortcomings are and we
[1:59:28] have a chance to do it
[1:59:30] over and they build in us the needed
[1:59:33] character for what God has placed us
[1:59:34] here to fulfill you know uh let me just
[1:59:38] take this tangent real quick and I I
[1:59:40] won't spend much more time but uh when
[1:59:43] an orchestra comes together you know
[1:59:45] like the philarmonic the Philadelphia
[1:59:47] philarmonic or maybe have one here in
[1:59:49] Minneapolis I don't know probably do uh
[1:59:52] when they come together it's not the
[1:59:54] first time they played an instrument
[1:59:56] right one of them started out when he
[1:59:58] was 6 years old 8 years old 12 and the
[2:00:02] the family had to
[2:00:03] [Music]
[2:00:05] hear they had to hear all the missed
[2:00:07] notes they had to suffer through and and
[2:00:11] just be patient well Johnny's going to
[2:00:13] get it you know he's and so they were
[2:00:16] they were schooled and trained each one
[2:00:19] separately yes for years and then one
[2:00:23] day they all come together oh friends
[2:00:25] I'm talking about a body of Christ here
[2:00:27] too God works on brother over here
[2:00:30] brought him through all that he went
[2:00:32] through over in Liberia and brings him
[2:00:34] here brought you from all the different
[2:00:36] we're all stones that he's been cutting
[2:00:38] and working and molding and
[2:00:40] shaping and he's bringing us together to
[2:00:42] make a certain sound and he's the
[2:00:45] conductor and we're all just looking at
[2:00:47] him and watching waiting and he might
[2:00:49] have us just sound one note and all of
[2:00:52] that training for 30 years might have
[2:00:53] been just to sound that one note but
[2:00:55] we'll sound it at the right time in the
[2:00:58] right
[2:00:59] season so when Jesus leaves the Earth he
[2:01:03] tells his disciples go and T
[2:01:06] until one of them speaks up and says I
[2:01:09] believe we got it already but Peter
[2:01:12] stands up and says now wait a minute the
[2:01:14] promise was to wait until you were
[2:01:17] endued with power from on high what is
[2:01:19] that power it's the power to overcome
[2:01:21] it's the power to live right right Peter
[2:01:25] Peter was
[2:01:27] zealous Peter oh he was so zealous and
[2:01:32] jealous Peter was jealous of of of John
[2:01:35] he walked on the water not because uh uh
[2:01:38] he walked on the water because he wanted
[2:01:39] to be the first one out there
[2:01:42] right Peter said the Lord says I'm going
[2:01:45] to the Cross he says no you're not Over
[2:01:46] My Dead Body and Jesus said you don't
[2:01:49] even know what Spirit you are get thee
[2:01:52] behind me Satan Sav the things of man
[2:01:54] and not the things of God he says Peter
[2:01:57] before the crows three times before
[2:02:00] the crows you're going to deny me
[2:02:02] oh no you've got me confused you must
[2:02:04] have me confused with somebody I'll
[2:02:05] never do that I'm faith and he believed
[2:02:08] that but he wasn't born again the spirit
[2:02:11] had not he had not been endued with that
[2:02:14] Spirit he had not been converted yet
[2:02:16] right he was told when you're converted
[2:02:18] strengthen the brethren
[2:02:20] Jesus is getting ready to go to the
[2:02:21] Cross uh you I I still wonder you know
[2:02:25] uh some things won't be answered perhaps
[2:02:27] till the other side or maybe it already
[2:02:28] has been answered I'll just leave that
[2:02:30] up to the Lord but you know why did he
[2:02:32] tell them to bring a
[2:02:34] sword and then Peter as the soldiers go
[2:02:37] to grab Jesus Peter takes that sword and
[2:02:40] swings right now I can't I can't tell
[2:02:45] you that this is how it was but I can
[2:02:49] tell you that Peter was a fisherman and
[2:02:52] I can tell you that that was a soldier
[2:02:54] and the soldier is trained in the ways
[2:02:55] of War he knows how to use a sword I
[2:02:58] don't think Peter was trying to cut off
[2:03:00] the guy's ear I think Peter took that
[2:03:03] sword and swung it and the guy just went
[2:03:05] like this and instead of cutting his
[2:03:08] head off he got his ear right right and
[2:03:11] then Jesus kneels down and picks up the
[2:03:13] ear and puts it back on and looks at
[2:03:15] Peter you know what are you doing here
[2:03:18] bud
[2:03:21] we hear
[2:03:22] him each one of the
[2:03:24] disciples they all denied they all hid
[2:03:28] as Jesus is dying on the cross right but
[2:03:31] after the day of Pentecost Peter's not
[2:03:33] denying anymore Peter's not lying
[2:03:36] anymore he's not cutting off ears he's
[2:03:38] not standing in the
[2:03:40] way there's a
[2:03:42] change but just to let you know that
[2:03:45] he's still in the overcoming process the
[2:03:49] message of the hour the messenger of the
[2:03:50] hour had to correct them because he was
[2:03:52] being a hypocrite with the between the
[2:03:54] Galatians and the True Believers but he
[2:03:57] showed the ad the spirit of Christ
[2:03:59] because he received it he zealously
[2:04:02] repented Hallelujah so it's the power to
[2:04:05] overcome we can't overcome by ourselves
[2:04:08] we're no match for the devil we need
[2:04:10] that life
[2:04:12] right so he said wait until and friends
[2:04:16] today there are many that are missing
[2:04:18] the power of the Holy Ghost we're not
[2:04:20] talking about a certain evidence we're
[2:04:21] not talking about running off and a
[2:04:24] chill or whatever we're talking about
[2:04:26] you meeting him face to face personally
[2:04:29] where you can say I know that I know
[2:04:31] that I know so the overcoming power of
[2:04:34] the word living and breathing in a body
[2:04:38] yes so they have a form of godliness but
[2:04:40] they they listen to the right teachings
[2:04:42] a lot of times but they're powerless to
[2:04:44] live it we've had a sealed book and it
[2:04:48] has remained being sealed for Seven Ages
[2:04:51] but God said in the days of the voice of
[2:04:53] the seventh angel the seventh Church age
[2:04:56] messenger the mystery of God should be
[2:04:58] finished and this messenger was born in
[2:05:02] the hills of Kentucky and then he lived
[2:05:04] across uh uh the Ohio river in the state
[2:05:07] of Indiana in a state where my parents
[2:05:10] were
[2:05:10] raised I'm not this this is neither here
[2:05:13] nor there it's just I'm just telling you
[2:05:15] we visited Indiana every summer my
[2:05:17] grandparents lived on the farm and we
[2:05:20] never knew what God did in the town that
[2:05:22] my grandparents one set of grandparents
[2:05:24] lived in which is
[2:05:26] Connorsville and in January of 1966 I
[2:05:29] was I just turned six years old we were
[2:05:31] driving from Montana to Indiana in snow
[2:05:35] to attend my grandfather's funeral he
[2:05:37] died on on January 20th and we had no
[2:05:40] idea that there was another gathering
[2:05:42] that was taking place in the southern
[2:05:43] part of the state at the same time after
[2:05:46] God chose to take his servant home
[2:05:49] after he sounded his message but God
[2:05:52] who's rich in Mercy he opened my eyes 22
[2:05:55] years later you said you know Satan used
[2:05:58] to beat me up why didn't you come
[2:05:59] earlier it's amazing what we will listen
[2:06:01] to and we oh sorry devil you know and
[2:06:04] you're right and I'm just no good and
[2:06:07] why can't I be like other people how
[2:06:08] could I come earlier amen I had to hear
[2:06:11] it I never heard it I came when I heard
[2:06:16] it so we had no idea that there was
[2:06:18] another gathering taking place in
[2:06:20] Southern Indiana and 22 years later uh
[2:06:24] when I bottomed out God allowed me to
[2:06:27] hear the message of his soon coming
[2:06:29] which brought with it rapturing Faith to
[2:06:32] believe it right and we have waited 35
[2:06:35] years now I've waited longer than than
[2:06:39] the time that I lived up to that and
[2:06:42] we're still
[2:06:43] waiting and we will continue to watch
[2:06:46] and we will continue to believe and we
[2:06:47] will continue to wa in the
[2:06:51] time in the time when things are quiet
[2:06:55] in the
[2:06:56] delay but one bright morning friends
[2:06:59] it's going to
[2:07:00] happen and our waiting will be
[2:07:03] over Hallelujah you know uh how many
[2:07:06] likes uh uh clocks with the you know the
[2:07:09] gears and all these things turning and I
[2:07:12] was fascinated with cuckoo clocks when I
[2:07:14] was a kid you know because here it is
[2:07:17] take take you can't really see anything
[2:07:19] going on and it's just you know tick
[2:07:21] tick tick tick and then right at a
[2:07:23] certain time this little thing would
[2:07:25] come out or maybe a little Soldier come
[2:07:27] out with his his gun and he'd come out
[2:07:29] and do something or a bird would come
[2:07:31] outo right and and it would sound off
[2:07:34] the the I was just in great anticipation
[2:07:36] waiting for that right but I had to wait
[2:07:39] for it and I had to believe that it was
[2:07:41] going to happen there was a delay right
[2:07:44] there's a time when nothing's going on
[2:07:46] and it's quiet but those gears are
[2:07:48] turning behind the scenes and in the
[2:07:51] right time in the right season that
[2:07:53] little bird comes out and makes it sound
[2:07:56] God's gears are turning just right
[2:07:57] friend they're not missing a beat
[2:07:59] they're not miss it's not delayed it's
[2:08:01] not it's not late it's not early it's
[2:08:03] turning right on time and one day it's
[2:08:06] going to make that last little click and
[2:08:09] the Rapture will be on and when you
[2:08:11] receive that body change you could say
[2:08:14] this is that until then we can say I
[2:08:16] don't know how it's going to happen but
[2:08:18] by I believe I believe he said it I'm
[2:08:21] waiting for it God's going to do it but
[2:08:24] when it happens you're going to say this
[2:08:26] is that this is that so so uh uh we've
[2:08:31] been patient we've been impatient we've
[2:08:33] been without patience we've been good
[2:08:37] we've made mistakes but we still believe
[2:08:39] him and we are faithful during the delay
[2:08:44] meanwhile many that started out are now
[2:08:47] saying hm I'm not so sure now well
[2:08:50] friends they never were
[2:08:52] Believers we don't say that we don't we
[2:08:55] want people to come as far as they can
[2:08:57] come we want to do everything that we
[2:08:59] can right but some people will never
[2:09:02] believe right they got caught up in the
[2:09:05] excitement so in the times of the delay
[2:09:08] you will find people uh uh saying well
[2:09:11] you know I'm just not so sure about this
[2:09:13] now uh uh you know uh we we just can't
[2:09:17] find a uh a news report about this or
[2:09:20] that was there a news report that proves
[2:09:24] that Jesus was here is there a news
[2:09:26] report was Life Magazine there on the
[2:09:28] day that the burning bush burned yeah is
[2:09:31] there a news report that Adam and Eve
[2:09:33] were in the garden come on friends we
[2:09:36] don't need that we don't need any
[2:09:38] evidence of man that's all intellectual
[2:09:41] that's all reasoning that's all it's a
[2:09:43] distraction we need the
[2:09:45] voice amen
[2:09:48] oh but we only have one man's word well
[2:09:51] we've always only had one man's word all
[2:09:54] the way through the word uh uh uh did
[2:09:58] you how many believed John in his day
[2:10:02] they only had John's
[2:10:04] word but science yeah what did science
[2:10:08] say in Noah's day they said there's no
[2:10:10] way that it's going to rain it
[2:10:13] did we believe his word are you with me
[2:10:17] our faith is all we need and we will not
[2:10:21] doubt in the time of the delay I still
[2:10:24] believe I still believe like Caleb my
[2:10:28] faith has not wavered I still believe
[2:10:31] I'm just as strong now as I was when I
[2:10:34] started I still believe I still believe
[2:10:37] I still believe I will not doubt am in
[2:10:40] the time of delay so the question for
[2:10:43] each and every one of us this morning is
[2:10:45] do you still believe I trust that you do
[2:10:48] we just want to encourage you friends
[2:10:50] because Satan will work on us in the
[2:10:52] time of delay even though we're
[2:10:54] Believers he'll start he'll try and work
[2:10:56] on us and this is God's answer to that
[2:10:58] that torture that he tries to put us
[2:11:00] through will you still believe if you
[2:11:03] have to come to more
[2:11:04] funerals but you say well I thought you
[2:11:07] said you wouldn't go the way of the
[2:11:08] Grave or or we wouldn't well my faith
[2:11:12] tells me we're living in the season of
[2:11:14] his coming but I don't know the time and
[2:11:16] anybody that says they do they're
[2:11:20] wrong I could get run
[2:11:22] over by the mailbox tomorrow afternoon
[2:11:25] well maybe not tomorrow because I'll be
[2:11:26] on an airplane I hope there isn't a
[2:11:27] mailbox on there
[2:11:29] but your faith is not built on man your
[2:11:33] faith is not built on a church but your
[2:11:35] faith is built on God's unfailing words
[2:11:38] of pro he's promised you he said I go to
[2:11:41] prepare a place for you so that where I
[2:11:43] am you may be also and if I do that I
[2:11:46] will come back for you so that where I
[2:11:49] am you may be also he can't lie friends
[2:11:53] he told us so we got the wedding garment
[2:11:55] on and we're waiting and people can Mock
[2:11:58] and say whatever they want but I want to
[2:12:00] be ready I want to be ready he can come
[2:12:03] at any moment at any time so uh imagine
[2:12:07] let me just close with this this morning
[2:12:09] imagine Abraham wakes up one morning and
[2:12:12] he sees this young lady uh walking
[2:12:14] through the room and maybe she's got a
[2:12:17] basket with a load of clothes in it and
[2:12:19] uh he's up early uh maybe went down to
[2:12:24] see that the chickens were being fed and
[2:12:25] the cows are being milked or whatever it
[2:12:27] was that they were doing and but he
[2:12:29] feels different this morning think about
[2:12:31] it feels just a little different you
[2:12:33] know uh he notices that his clothes are
[2:12:36] loose in some areas and they're tight in
[2:12:39] other areas and he's got more energy
[2:12:42] than he usually does and and he looks
[2:12:46] over at this young girl and he he
[2:12:48] reaches over to the bedside to grabb his
[2:12:50] glasses but then he realizes you know
[2:12:52] what I don't need glasses I can see that
[2:12:55] young girl just just perfectly I wonder
[2:12:57] who this this young girl is there's
[2:12:59] something very familiar about her and
[2:13:02] he's he's thinking you know uh uh is
[2:13:04] this one of Sarah's nieces that are
[2:13:07] visiting perhaps kind of looks like
[2:13:08] Sarah looks very familiar and so she's
[2:13:12] looking down at the clothes she's not
[2:13:13] looking at Abraham and she says Abraham
[2:13:16] are these clothes clean or dirty I don't
[2:13:19] know how it is in your house but we've
[2:13:21] been down that are these clothes clean
[2:13:23] or dirty he doesn't answer right away
[2:13:27] the wind is knocked out of
[2:13:29] him and he thinks you know if I didn't
[2:13:31] know better I'd say that was I'd say
[2:13:35] that was my little sweetheart when she
[2:13:37] was 20 years old I still remember
[2:13:41] I if I didn't know better and she says
[2:13:44] Abraham did you hear me
[2:13:48] and then she turns to look at them and
[2:13:50] their eyes meet and they both scream
[2:13:54] they both shout they run towards one
[2:13:57] another and they both start dancing and
[2:14:00] shouting this is the day this is the day
[2:14:04] that the Lord has made that the Lord has
[2:14:07] made I will rejoice I will rejoice and
[2:14:11] be glad in it and be glad in it this is
[2:14:16] the day that the Lord has made I will
[2:14:19] rejoice and be glad in it this is the
[2:14:23] day prince it's going to happen it's
[2:14:26] going to happen it's going to happen
[2:14:29] don't be weary and well doing it's going
[2:14:32] to happen God cannot fail God cannot lie
[2:14:36] that clock is going to turn those gears
[2:14:38] are moving just right and one day one
[2:14:43] day Abraham's looking at Sarah Sarah's
[2:14:46] looking at Abraham their dad's around
[2:14:48] and the next thing you know Abraham says
[2:14:51] this is that they question and question
[2:14:55] but this is that what he says here it is
[2:15:00] hallelujah Sarah 9 months from now that
[2:15:04] sun's coming we're going to have that
[2:15:07] promised son Christ is coming back to
[2:15:10] the Earth friends we believe that they
[2:15:13] were faithful during the delay they were
[2:15:15] faithful the locals began
[2:15:18] talk let me I'm pulling over here
[2:15:21] imagine that they went to a restaurant I
[2:15:23] don't know if they did that back then
[2:15:24] but let's just imagine that they were
[2:15:26] like living in our day you know let's
[2:15:29] let's go out tonight this is celebration
[2:15:32] you know uh let's go out to the
[2:15:34] restaurant so they go to the restaurant
[2:15:36] and the local people they begin to talk
[2:15:39] and they begin to point and they begin
[2:15:41] to
[2:15:42] gaw and somebody finally gets enough
[2:15:45] courage to come over to the table and
[2:15:47] say
[2:15:48] is that you
[2:15:49] Abraham somebody said I didn't believe
[2:15:52] it but somebody says that that's you is
[2:15:53] that you and is that you
[2:15:55] Sarah what is this Abraham what's taking
[2:16:00] place is it the essential oils that
[2:16:03] you're
[2:16:05] using listen friends there's only one
[2:16:07] oil That's essential and that's the Holy
[2:16:10] Ghost and it'll cure whatever ails you
[2:16:16] amen I was preaching that one time and
[2:16:19] somebody got upset in the meeting and I
[2:16:20] could feel that and I looked over and I
[2:16:22] said well isn't lavender the one that
[2:16:24] kind of calms you down just take some of
[2:16:26] that lavender oil you believe in that so
[2:16:29] it'll settle you down or get the Holy
[2:16:31] Ghost that'll cure whatever Els you
[2:16:35] Hallelujah Abraham says no this is that
[2:16:38] I've been telling you and I've been
[2:16:39] telling you and I told you and I told
[2:16:41] you this is that this is that which was
[2:16:45] promised in the word so Satan might be
[2:16:48] telling you today friends God forgot
[2:16:50] about you does he say things like that
[2:16:53] you know you probably won't make it uh
[2:16:56] uh uh I'm not saying you doubt there's
[2:16:58] going to be a Rapture but you'll
[2:17:00] probably be left behind uh maybe it
[2:17:02] already happened uh maybe we're already
[2:17:05] in the
[2:17:07] tribulation some would say well we're
[2:17:09] already in the Millennium all right let
[2:17:11] me poke you and see how you react we'll
[2:17:13] see we'll see if we're in the Millennium
[2:17:15] or not maybe you started this
[2:17:19] race and you faced many trials and you
[2:17:23] buried many loved ones and you've saw
[2:17:26] friends and loved ones go their way as
[2:17:29] the Lord took them home friends these
[2:17:31] things are
[2:17:33] happening maybe you're being asked where
[2:17:36] is the sign of his coming by the
[2:17:39] scoffers during the
[2:17:42] delay but so many of you have left
[2:17:45] father and mother and sister and brother
[2:17:47] in lands homes jobs for the gospel's
[2:17:51] sake yes sir many of you have moved to
[2:17:54] be part of a local body of Believers or
[2:17:57] uh uh you've moved to make yourself
[2:18:00] ready for the time of delay or you're
[2:18:01] making you're
[2:18:03] driving a long ways to to be a part of
[2:18:06] it you've sacrificed and you continue to
[2:18:09] sacrifice and you continue to put your
[2:18:11] shoulder behind the wheel behind the
[2:18:13] work of the Lord because you know that
[2:18:16] he's coming yes sir not you think you
[2:18:18] know he's coming and you know that he's
[2:18:22] watching and you've supported your
[2:18:24] pastor this a good day to show them your
[2:18:27] appreciation of course every day would
[2:18:28] be good I saw he's talked about the
[2:18:31] appreciation I saw something that
[2:18:33] somebody posted where the pastor is
[2:18:35] standing on a plank you know one one of
[2:18:37] these pirat ship and there's a guy ready
[2:18:39] to kick him off the edge of the ship you
[2:18:41] know it's a a pastor is the target you
[2:18:45] smite the shepherd you scatter the Sheep
[2:18:48] so you've supported your pastor and you
[2:18:50] continue to you continue to support the
[2:18:52] work of God that he's uh uh made him the
[2:18:55] overse or over and you know that you
[2:18:58] must work until the Lord comes I we had
[2:19:01] a young convert from our neighborhood
[2:19:03] that we baptized here recently and we
[2:19:04] were speaking about end time signs and
[2:19:07] and things that were going to take place
[2:19:08] and he he wanted another meeting to sit
[2:19:11] out and discuss some things and he's
[2:19:13] just eating it up like a sponge he's
[2:19:14] 11th Hour worker that's coming in 18
[2:19:16] years old just said I don't even know
[2:19:20] why I came to your church just something
[2:19:22] something drew me and he's the only one
[2:19:23] in his family and so uh uh he was
[2:19:27] worried and uh uh we sat out and he says
[2:19:30] you're saying all these things are
[2:19:32] happening and the Lord's coming and so
[2:19:34] should I quit my job or should I not go
[2:19:36] to school what should I do right I'm
[2:19:39] glad that brother Brandon was asked
[2:19:41] those questions and questions and
[2:19:42] answers and uh he said one guy came up
[2:19:45] to him and says uh uh uh um Pastor not
[2:19:49] to him but one guy came up to his pastor
[2:19:51] and said pastor here's my
[2:19:54] keys uh the Lord's coming so I'm not
[2:19:56] going to need this car and brother Bram
[2:19:58] said you know the implication was the
[2:20:00] pastor wasn't going to make it he might
[2:20:02] need the keys but this one's going you
[2:20:04] know uh what I told the young man is
[2:20:08] look the only difference between us and
[2:20:12] the we're running a relay race the Baton
[2:20:15] has been passed on the first Runner the
[2:20:18] first age and the last age in a relay
[2:20:20] race they run it differently than all
[2:20:22] the rest the ones in the middle are
[2:20:24] sustainers the ones at the beginning and
[2:20:26] the end are are different the ones at
[2:20:28] the end they don't have anybody to hand
[2:20:29] it off to they got to cross the finish
[2:20:32] line you're it there's nobody else you
[2:20:35] can't push this out well maybe they'll
[2:20:37] get it some other no we're the last ones
[2:20:40] we're the last and chosen
[2:20:42] generation but be the only difference
[2:20:46] let's say between us and somebody that
[2:20:48] was living in the sixth Church age uh is
[2:20:51] that they didn't know they were living
[2:20:54] in the last day they lived like they
[2:20:57] were they every age lived like the Lord
[2:21:00] was coming right and they went down and
[2:21:03] they'll come right back up and when the
[2:21:05] Lord's
[2:21:06] coming but you and I we know that the
[2:21:09] Lord is coming right but we still have
[2:21:11] to do what we were put here to do every
[2:21:14] minute everything that God put us here
[2:21:17] to do we still have to do it so we got
[2:21:20] to just you know brother Brown said if
[2:21:23] you're planting potatoes plant them
[2:21:26] right live like the Lord could come at
[2:21:28] any minute but if you're a farmer plant
[2:21:30] your potatoes right if you're learning a
[2:21:33] a skill to be able to support your
[2:21:35] family learn the skill right just work
[2:21:39] right up till till he comes don't worry
[2:21:42] about it you still got to do what God
[2:21:44] called you to do but just be ready
[2:21:49] work until the Lord comes you know that
[2:21:52] you must work until he comes in the
[2:21:54] meantime and you know that he's Mindful
[2:21:57] and you know that he's with you and you
[2:22:00] know that he's a rewarder and you will
[2:22:02] not be ashamed at is coming you will not
[2:22:05] grow weaker in faith but you believe now
[2:22:09] more than ever how many can say that
[2:22:12] more than ever more than ever that his
[2:22:15] promise concerning you will come to pass
[2:22:18] let's stand you are faithful in the
[2:22:22] delay of his
[2:22:24] coming and he is faithful in his word
[2:22:27] concerning you friends he's completely
[2:22:30] in control how many believes that
[2:22:32] there's not anything that he isn't
[2:22:34] mindful of there's not anything that he
[2:22:35] isn't watching over and as your pastor
[2:22:38] has
[2:22:39] been uh uh anointed to and of the Lord
[2:22:44] to Bear the burden to bring to you God
[2:22:47] will put on you the burden to do what it
[2:22:50] is that you're called to do if you're
[2:22:52] looking to
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:22:55] him brother Brown said don't go looking
[2:22:58] after the Deep things he says watch the
[2:23:00] little things God will make sure you
[2:23:03] catch the big things along the way we're
[2:23:06] not being scared into a Rapture
[2:23:10] friends we're being loved into a
[2:23:13] Rapture but he's the one that's in
[2:23:15] control and when he says it's time it's
[2:23:19] time but in the meantime we're going to
[2:23:22] hold hold we're going to hold to the
[2:23:25] faith we're going to continue to
[2:23:27] proclaim the message he's
[2:23:29] [Music]
[2:23:31] coming at some point in time the door is
[2:23:34] going to
[2:23:35] close it hasn't
[2:23:38] closed so we need to work until he
[2:23:44] comes but he could come at any time
[2:23:48] let's bow our
[2:23:49] heads
