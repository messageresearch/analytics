[2:33] I said, "Since I got saved 30 years ago
[2:37] as a boy, ever since then, it seems like
[2:41] I'm in a nightmare."
[2:43] She said, "What do you mean?"
[2:46] I've said in this life something
[2:49] happened down in me that makes me know
[2:52] that there's a land somewhere and I'm
[2:54] shaking myself to wake up.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Someday death will wake me into his
[3:01] presence.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; Did you ever have a nightmare and just
[3:04] wanted to get out of it and you were
[3:08] jerking and jumping? You want to wake up
[3:11] because you know there's a reality
[3:12] somewhere that's far beyond that
[3:14] nightmare.
[3:15] So is it the ever Christian born again?
[3:20] Always has been. Abraham and Isaac and
[3:22] them said they were pilgrims and
[3:24] strangers. They were seeking a city to
[3:26] come.
[3:29] &gt;&gt; That's who he was.
[3:33] We were going to the grocery a few weeks
[3:35] ago
[3:38] and
[3:40] we noticed a woman with a dress on. It
[3:44] was the most uncommon thing we'd seen in
[3:46] a long time. So we mey said to me, she
[3:52] said, "Bill, what is the matter?" I
[3:55] said, "Honey, here's what it is.
[3:59] We don't want to get accustomed to the
[4:02] world."
[4:04] She said, "Well,
[4:06] some people has said, and I've got
[4:08] letters, you're going to ruin your
[4:11] ministry by making such remarks as you
[4:14] do." I said, "If preaching the truth
[4:17] ruins a ministry that it ought to be
[4:19] ruined, right?"
[4:24] &gt;&gt; She said, "Well, what makes Christians
[4:26] feel different?" I said, "When I was in
[4:29] Sweden or in Finland,
[4:33] the women in the bath house give the man
[4:35] the bath." They were nurses. They said
[4:38] that's their customs.
[4:41] When I was in Paris, all the restrooms
[4:44] is both men and women together. That's a
[4:47] custom
[4:49] of Paris. They think nothing of it.
[4:53] I made a mention to Dr. money and over
[4:56] in when we were staying at the YMCA and
[5:00] they wanted me to go down and take one
[5:02] of those sundras which I thought was
[5:03] fine but not with the women there and so
[5:06] he said but brother Brandham said those
[5:08] are wash women I said but it's not right
[5:13] he said what about your doctors
[5:15] examining your women over in America
[5:17] then see so there you are see it's just
[5:20] six of one and half a dozen of the other
[5:24] but It's the nation that you belong to
[5:26] in the customs. When a man or woman is
[5:30] born again of the spirit of God, they
[5:33] are born from a place that's holy and
[5:36] this is not their home.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; And they are
[5:41] seeking a city to come whose builder and
[5:44] maker is God.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; Your spirit comes from above.
[5:49] She said, "Then we're not Americans." I
[5:51] said, "We are as long as we're in the
[5:53] flesh." But when we are born again,
[5:55] we're of heaven
[5:57] &gt;&gt; and of God, and we're citizens of the
[6:01] kingdom of God.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit that dwells there
[6:05] that comes into you will make you act
[6:08] and look and think as it does in that
[6:11] nation where we're going to.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[6:16] Idolatry taken over
[6:20] all the preachers under the great heavy
[6:22] load. the prophets had give away because
[6:26] the people demanded it. The people
[6:29] demanded it and the the ministry gave
[6:32] away to it. That's the way it is today.
[6:36] Many good preachers bend under the load
[6:39] because the congregation calls for it.
[6:44] They'll walk right out of his church.
[6:48] Many times the great denominations if
[6:51] they caught one of their ministers
[6:52] preaching against such smoking and so
[6:55] forth like that that excommunicate them.
[6:59] And the ministers has to bend under that
[7:01] load.
[7:04] But there was one in that day didn't
[7:06] bend under the load. They hated him. But
[7:11] he's setting up on a mountain. God told
[7:14] him to go up there. He'd feed him with
[7:15] the crows and
[7:17] Hallelujah.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Give him water to drink.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; But he wouldn't bow down to their modern
[7:23] trend. He still believed God was the
[7:27] same holy God
[7:29] &gt;&gt; that made heavens and earth.
[7:32] I'm so glad that he's got still got some
[7:35] today that believes the same thing.
[7:41] No matter what the world says, they
[7:43] still won't bow to the modern trend on
[7:46] modern religion.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; No social gospel for them, man. They
[7:52] believe God's still holy.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; They believe he requires holiness and he
[7:57] requires a new birth. He requires a
[8:00] separation
[8:01] from sin.
[8:05] Oh, I know she hated him, but God loved
[8:08] him.
[8:10] And God was fixing to take his prophet
[8:13] off the mountain to bring him down into
[8:16] the valley.
[8:19] And she must have been a good woman or
[8:22] God would have never chosen her to
[8:24] entertain his prophet though she was a
[8:27] widow
[8:30] and she must have been young. She had a
[8:32] young son
[8:36] and
[8:38] she was a righteous person
[8:41] or God would have never chose her.
[8:45] But as she began to come down after
[8:50] years, her husband being dead,
[8:53] the barrel began to get low in meal.
[8:57] And of course, as a mother would, she
[9:00] would lounce herself so she could feed
[9:02] her little boy.
[9:06] Finally, she began to see that his
[9:07] clothes was getting threadbear.
[9:11] Her own elbows was perhaps through the
[9:14] sleeves.
[9:16] Night after night, she could give him
[9:19] maybe one little corn cake and put him
[9:22] in the bed.
[9:25] And perhaps night after night he'd wake
[9:28] up and say, "Mama,
[9:31] I'm hungry.
[9:34] Can't you fix me just a little to eat?"
[9:39] And maybe the next day she would do
[9:40] without her own cake and give it to him.
[9:45] Death stalking at the door. No more meal
[9:48] after that was gone. No more oil to mix
[9:52] it with.
[9:54] And closer and closer, death came as the
[9:58] barrel went down.
[10:01] Finally, maybe they got two cakes a
[10:03] week.
[10:06] Then it got down to just one more cake.
[10:11] Isn't it strange how God does things?
[10:15] He'll let us get right down to the last
[10:18] the last mile of the way.
[10:23] You know, he he likes to do that. He did
[10:26] it with the Hebrew children.
[10:29] He knew who he could trust. So he let
[10:32] that
[10:34] them boys walk right up to the fiery
[10:37] furnace so they could almost smell the
[10:39] fire.
[10:41] And he never moved.
[10:44] But when it comes time, he'll move.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; He'll move, but he waits till his own
[10:51] time.
[10:52] He wanted to see what kind of a reaction
[10:54] they'd have. He knew they had made their
[10:56] stand.
[10:59] And when he knows that you make your
[11:01] stand,
[11:03] he'll let Satan take you to the last
[11:06] mile of the way.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; But just remember, he's still there.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; He wants to see if you really mean what
[11:14] you're talking about. Oh, I believe
[11:17] God's a healer. Yes, I sure believe it.
[11:19] And the next day, you still got your
[11:20] pain healed.
[11:22] Well, maybe I never got it.
[11:26] Sure you got it. You just want to see
[11:28] how you're going to react on what you
[11:30] said.
[11:32] You say, "Oh, praise God. I believe in
[11:35] the baptism of the Holy Spirit." The
[11:37] first little temptation comes along, you
[11:39] fly off like a buzz off.
[11:42] He's trying to see your reaction on your
[11:45] action.
[11:47] He's trying to test you. Every son that
[11:51] cometh to God must first be chasened,
[11:54] tested.
[11:56] Every child that comes to him, he puts
[11:59] him through a test to see how he'll act.
[12:04] Anyone, a chemist, anyone else will
[12:07] always test something.
[12:10] Great pipes.
[12:12] I used to work for a gas company and
[12:14] they test those pipes by putting a plug
[12:16] in the end and a valve and I don't
[12:20] remember now just how many hundred
[12:22] pounds of pressure they put on them
[12:25] pipes to see if there was a little sand
[12:28] hole that would blow.
[12:32] And if the it could not stand the test
[12:35] then it was thrown into the scrap heap.
[12:38] And when you're put under a test, when
[12:41] you're fixing to be used for God, for a
[12:44] testimony, like the lady you're in the
[12:47] wheelchair, the man, the little boy,
[12:48] some of you people out there, maybe
[12:50] you're Christians and wonder why you're
[12:52] put under this test.
[12:55] God's fixing to use your testimony,
[13:01] &gt;&gt; but he wants to see how you react.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; So, he puts a pressure on
[13:08] If you blow up, well then he can't do
[13:11] nothing with you. But if you hold on,
[13:16] stand the test.
[13:19] This little woman,
[13:21] I can imagine seeing her that last night
[13:24] when she know there's just enough in
[13:27] that barrel, a handful of meal and a
[13:29] spoonful of oil
[13:32] for one little cake for she and her son.
[13:35] And then she is to die and he was to
[13:37] die. There's no more available anywhere.
[13:43] And I can imagine all night long
[13:47] as she walked over and patted his little
[13:50] bare skinny hands
[13:53] and she looked at his little ragged
[13:55] night shirt
[13:58] and she'd hear him in his sleep turn
[14:01] over and say, "Mama, I'm hungry.
[14:06] But there was nothing to give him.
[14:12] Isn't it strange when we have done all
[14:14] that we know how to do
[14:17] and after she had prayed and and seen
[14:20] the end come
[14:23] like some of you cancer cases here.
[14:27] You sinned right at the end and you
[14:30] wonder why she'd examine herself. Lord,
[14:34] is there anything that I've left undone?
[14:39] God test
[14:41] like Job.
[14:43] They accused him that he was a secret
[14:45] sinner and Job was righteous.
[14:48] There was no man on earth like him. And
[14:52] yet God let the devil take everything he
[14:55] had.
[14:57] And when they accused him of being a
[14:59] secret sinner, he knew that he was
[15:02] righteous before God.
[15:04] He knew he had done no sin. But God lets
[15:08] those things happen to see what you'll
[15:10] do. You see, he and Satan had a a
[15:13] proposition. Satan said, "I'll make him
[15:15] curse you to your face." God said, "You
[15:17] can't do it."
[15:19] &gt;&gt; And the test had to come.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; And your test comes. my test comes and
[15:27] we all go through those testings. The
[15:30] Bible said if we cannot stand that it
[15:32] proves that we're illegitimate children.
[15:34] Our testimony was not right. We're not
[15:37] real children of God but we become
[15:40] illegitimate.
[15:41] We're not the children of God. We just
[15:44] claim to be. When they laugh at you when
[15:47] you receive the Holy Ghost and you go
[15:49] back in the world with them, that shows
[15:51] you never got it. Amen.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; When you're testifying of your healing,
[15:57] knowing that God's done something for
[15:59] you and your neighbors say you're crazy,
[16:04] you're no better at all. You say, "Well,
[16:06] maybe I'm not." It shows you wasn't
[16:08] worthy of your healing to begin with.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; You stand on your testimony.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Don't you give away. You stand right
[16:16] there.
[16:20] Job said, "I know my redeemer liveth
[16:23] until last days he'll stand on the
[16:25] earth. Though the skinworms destroys
[16:27] this body, yet in my flesh I'll see
[16:30] God."
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Lightning's flashed. The thunders
[16:33] roared.
[16:35] It's held out to the end.
[16:39] This little woman had done all she know
[16:41] to do.
[16:43] And yet God kept silent.
[16:48] But when real faith has caught the
[16:51] vision, it can keep silent and rest
[16:54] calmly because it knows it's going to
[16:57] happen.
[16:58] Don't forget that
[17:01] faith will rest with perfect assurance.
[17:05] No matter what the storms are saying,
[17:08] how contrary it looks, faith rests with
[17:11] assurance.
[17:13] Faith can take its stand up on a rock.
[17:17] Look into a grave or into the waters
[17:20] where a lovely little chunk of your own
[17:25] loving heart has been buried.
[17:28] And faith can look across the sea to him
[17:32] that said, "I am the resurrection and
[17:34] life."
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Faith rest asssurance.
[17:40] We speak of faith. We talk of faith. But
[17:43] I wonder sometime if we know what we're
[17:45] talking about. I wonder if it isn't hope
[17:48] instead of faith. Faith doesn't move.
[17:52] No matter how contrary it looks, faith
[17:54] stays right there. It never moves.
[17:59] When Moses was put into the the bull
[18:02] rush
[18:04] in a little slimy ark, pushed out into
[18:07] the sea
[18:09] where the crocodiles were fat with
[18:11] children.
[18:14] The mother
[18:17] Jezebel with the faith resting assure
[18:20] that she was putting the proper child of
[18:23] God on the water. She pushed him right
[18:25] into the jaws of death knowing that God
[18:27] could raise him back.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That makes me feel religious.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; She knew God would take care of him.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Though he didn't even have a name, God
[18:38] could give him a name.
[18:42] She pushed the sweetest little baby was
[18:45] ever in the world nearly out into the
[18:48] jaws of death knowing that she was
[18:51] following the instructions of Almighty
[18:53] God. And faith could rest assure that
[18:56] God would do something about it for she
[18:59] know he was born a deliverer.
[19:03] And if you're sure that you're born of
[19:06] the spirit of God, that you have the
[19:09] Holy Ghost, and the promises of God is
[19:12] yours, I don't care what the devil does,
[19:14] you can still rest assure.
[19:17] Faith takes its unmovable stand.
[19:22] Faith cannot rest upon the shifting
[19:24] sands of man's theology,
[19:26] but it takes its solemn stand on the
[19:30] rock of ages,
[19:32] which is unmovable.
[19:34] There it rest with assurance.
[19:37] No matter what comes or goes, my faith
[19:40] holds.
[19:43] how sick I get, how contrary it looks,
[19:46] and how this is. My faith is anchored
[19:48] within the veil, and nothing can move
[19:50] me.
[19:52] Now, you can't bluff it. You've got to
[19:55] have it.
[19:57] You can't bluff it. Satan knows when
[19:59] you're bluffing, and he also knows when
[20:01] you've got it.
[20:04] Your heart condemns you not, and you're
[20:05] a Christian, you have a right to every
[20:08] promise that God made in his book. It's
[20:10] yours.
[20:12] No matter what the consequences is and
[20:14] what the outcome, you don't look at
[20:15] that. You look at the faith that God
[20:17] give you to the promise
[20:20] &gt;&gt; and it stands there. Nothing will move
[20:23] it.
[20:24] How she must have felt. I've met every
[20:27] requirement Jehovah gave. I've met
[20:30] everything that God told me to do.
[20:34] And the barrels down to one little
[20:36] handful of meal. And the cruise has just
[20:39] a spoonful or two of oil enough to mix
[20:42] it.
[20:44] But God was setting an angel's on every
[20:46] bed post folks watching to see how she's
[20:49] going to react.
[20:52] If you're sure that it's God and you met
[20:54] every requirement that God required you
[20:57] to do, you've met every scripture that
[21:00] you know, you love him, you've been
[21:03] baptized, you've been filled with the
[21:05] spirit, and you've got the insurance in
[21:07] your heart that God will do it, then
[21:10] just hang on.
[21:12] God will bring you through. He'll never
[21:15] fail. Hold to it.
[21:20] how it looked at a Christian woman and
[21:23] there maybe Ahab in his palace and
[21:26] Jezebel with plenty to eat. We wonder
[21:29] why the wicked prosper. David asked that
[21:32] once but the word came back. Watch him
[21:35] at the end.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Prosperity isn't a sign of God being
[21:39] with him.
[21:42] That's so our nation is blessed. The
[21:44] people are all Christians and so was it
[21:47] in that day. Prosperity then was by
[21:49] subversing.
[21:51] This poor little woman as she looked at
[21:54] that little baby all night long she
[21:57] couldn't sleep. First place she was so
[22:00] hungry she couldn't sleep. And she knew
[22:02] that one handful of meal
[22:06] stood between her and death.
[22:09] What would she do? She couldn't stand it
[22:11] any longer. She's frail. She's walking
[22:14] reeling as she walked.
[22:16] the little fella crying for a mouthful
[22:19] of bread. And yet she was a Christian, a
[22:23] believer. And Jehovah, as we'd call
[22:26] Christian today, loyal, proved that God
[22:30] selected her above all the other women.
[22:33] He selected her. Yet she had done all
[22:35] that could be done. Along towards
[22:37] daylight, the birds wouldn't even
[22:40] hollow. They were all starved, gone. Day
[22:43] begin to break across the room. I can
[22:46] see her sitting in an old rocking chair,
[22:48] ringing her hands,
[22:51] the tears running down her cheeks as she
[22:53] looked. The little boy had spent a
[22:54] resting night. Mama,
[22:57] can't you just find one little piece of
[22:59] bread?
[23:02] Papa was a good man.
[23:05] God taken him. What's the matter, mama?
[23:08] But the woman stood. She knew she had
[23:11] met the requirements of God.
[23:14] She had one little handful of meal.
[23:18] She went in and tucked this little
[23:20] handful of meal out into the the pan and
[23:25] poured the oil into it. Begin to mix it
[23:28] up. Now, the meal was Christ. Christ is
[23:32] the meal offering. Any of you clergymen
[23:34] know that? Amen.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; When the meal was ground for the for the
[23:39] meal offering, it had to be ground with
[23:41] a certain burr that every little burr
[23:44] had to grind the meal just exactly the
[23:47] same. Why? Because Christ is the same
[23:51] yesterday, today, and forever.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; What he was then, he is tonight.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; What he is tonight, he'll always be.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[24:02] forever. Now the oral represents the
[24:05] spirit
[24:08] and the we know that by the scriptures
[24:10] that's the reason we anoint by oral.
[24:13] When Elijah one time at the school of
[24:15] the prophets
[24:17] had come up there and just sent some of
[24:19] them man out from the school and they
[24:21] didn't know the difference between wild
[24:23] gourds and peas.
[24:26] some prophets. But he picked the lap
[24:28] full of wild gourds and throwed them
[24:30] into the pot. And one of them screamed
[24:32] out, "There's death in the pot." And
[24:35] Elijah said, "Don't get excited." He
[24:37] went and got a handful of meal and
[24:41] throwed it into the pot and said, "Eat."
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Why? When Christ is putting death, life
[24:47] comes instead of death.
[24:50] Don't care how far you've gone, how low
[24:53] you're s, how immoral you are, how
[24:55] degraded you are, how sinful you are.
[24:59] When Christ comes into the heart, death
[25:02] fades away and life comes into the same
[25:04] place.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; From death in the pot coming life in the
[25:08] pot.
[25:10] If the cancers eat you up, if two
[25:12] berkeland your doctor has turned you
[25:14] down, nothing else can be done. Let a
[25:16] handful of Christ come into you
[25:19] &gt;&gt; that Jesus the same yesterday. Not a
[25:21] handful of religion now. A handful of
[25:23] Christ, the Holy Ghost
[25:26] &gt;&gt; come into your heart with genuine faith
[25:29] and death will flee out and life will
[25:31] take its place.
[25:33] The meal offering
[25:36] and the oral is the spirit. Now what is
[25:39] that? Christ is the word. In the
[25:41] beginning was the word. The word is with
[25:42] God. The word was God and the word was
[25:45] made flesh and dwelt among us and the
[25:48] spirit. Jesus told the woman at the well
[25:52] said the time is coming when God seeks
[25:55] people that will worship him in spirit
[25:58] and in truth. That's the word with the
[26:00] spirit. Some people has the word, others
[26:04] has the spirit. But when you get spirit
[26:06] and truth together, something's got to
[26:09] happen.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; And it was just a little bit
[26:13] just a little bit, but it was all she
[26:16] needed.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; God let this saint deep in the people's
[26:21] heart.
[26:23] You may be down to your last handful.
[26:27] I've heard people say, "I don't have
[26:29] very much faith, Brother Brandham." But
[26:31] what you got, if it's real faith, mix it
[26:34] with God's word.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Look what it'll do. You say, "Well,
[26:38] Brother Brandham, I've been to every
[26:39] doctor, been the clinic. Oh, I've joined
[26:42] church for my sins and I've done this. I
[26:44] can't help what all you've done. What
[26:46] little faith you got enough faith to be
[26:47] out here tonight. Then mix it with the
[26:49] word.
[26:51] Get ready. She stirred it up together.
[26:54] That's the only thing between her and
[26:56] death. That may be the only thing left
[26:58] for you tonight, between you and death.
[27:00] Is what little spirit that you can
[27:03] muster up in your heart to believe it.
[27:05] Mix it with God's eternal word.
[27:09] When she did, I can see her pull the
[27:11] little ragged curtain back and look in
[27:13] the little boy's holding his little
[27:15] stomach. Mother, mother,
[27:19] are you ready to cook the little cake?
[27:22] She'd say, "Yes, dear. Just wait a few
[27:25] minutes. Mother's mixing it up. Mother,
[27:29] break it in two and you take half of
[27:31] it." Oh, honey, we'll take care of that.
[27:34] She had the what was it now? The word
[27:37] and the spirit mixed together.
[27:41] And she went out into the yard to get,
[27:44] did you know this? The scripture says,
[27:46] two sticks.
[27:48] What is the two sticks? The cross.
