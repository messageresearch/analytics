[6:52] let's just say a word of prayer
[6:59] our most gracious and eternal father
[7:04] we thank this so much for this morning
[7:08] and we are so grateful
[7:11] that you've gathered us together by your
[7:12] feet once again oh god
[7:15] for we reckon
[7:17] above all things
[7:20] that you have made it possible
[7:23] it is not because we are smart
[7:26] it's not because we know how to take
[7:27] good care of ourselves
[7:30] it's not because we are up to the task
[7:33] but we find ourselves
[7:35] in the hands of the almighty god
[7:38] and we know that all power in heaven and
[7:40] on earth belong to you
[7:42] and we know there is nothing impossible
[7:44] in thy name
[7:46] we know that you are the one and only
[7:48] sovereign authority there is
[7:50] and the one and only sovereign authority
[7:52] that would ever be
[7:53] you alone are god
[7:55] the god of all creations and the god of
[7:57] all flesh
[7:59] the alpha and omega the beginning and
[8:01] the ending the almighty god
[8:03] we are so grateful
[8:05] and we are honored and humbled
[8:07] to know that we are children of the most
[8:09] high god
[8:11] we thank you so much
[8:13] now all through this life you have been
[8:15] with us
[8:16] when we look at father what we went
[8:18] through in the last few weeks
[8:20] the storms that were going through
[8:22] it is enough to say
[8:25] that we were going through the eye of
[8:27] the storm
[8:28] and even in the eye of the storm we were
[8:30] surrounded by your love
[8:32] we were surrounded by a divine
[8:33] protection that we could feel your
[8:35] presence and we knew that we're not on
[8:38] our own we knew
[8:40] that the lord was with us
[8:43] we are so very much grateful father we
[8:45] give you the glory this morning father
[8:47] we give you the honor we praise the
[8:49] father we worship the father we bless
[8:51] thee and we glorified it in the name of
[8:54] jesus our lord and savior
[8:57] once again your children have gathered
[8:59] there are some on their way so coming
[9:00] record them into your hands
[9:02] and we pray that you will come and be
[9:05] with us according to your word of
[9:07] promise which says what two or three are
[9:08] gathered in your name there you are in
[9:10] their midst and that you will break unto
[9:13] us the bread of life and feed our hungry
[9:15] soul this morning before we leave your
[9:16] presence
[9:18] may you come
[9:19] and be with every one of us and grant
[9:21] unto us according to our needs
[9:23] in jesus name father we pray with
[9:25] thanksgiving
[9:27] amen
[9:29] praise be to god yes i had a very short
[9:33] tribute
[9:34] to pay in honor
[9:36] of
[9:37] our brother brother scott
[9:40] yeah but um
[9:42] i couldn't just go ahead without a word
[9:45] of prayer
[9:46] praise be to god
[9:49] i was happy to see every one of you
[9:52] you know
[9:54] um
[9:55] we've heard time and again
[9:57] how much love brother scott
[10:00] had
[10:01] for people around him and we are
[10:04] witnesses of it all we have seen that
[10:07] time and again
[10:09] but there was a portion of it
[10:12] that was left untold
[10:14] and i'm here to tell that story
[10:18] brother scott
[10:19] apart from having so much love
[10:22] for people
[10:24] he had so much love for children
[10:30] he had a special relationship with
[10:32] children
[10:35] i remember when dany and joshua got an
[10:37] accident when the house
[10:40] and i had a knock on the door
[10:43] and when i went
[10:44] it was brother's cut
[10:47] and i saw brother scott you did it the
[10:48] african way
[10:50] because back home that is what we do i
[10:52] will just come to your house without
[10:54] calling you
[10:55] if i don't see you i will sit and wait
[10:58] if i have no time i'll go and i'll come
[11:00] back
[11:01] but fortunately when he came that day
[11:04] we went the house
[11:06] we sat
[11:07] on the dining table
[11:09] and in fact
[11:11] he just poured out his heart
[11:15] he loves these children so very much
[11:19] and we spoke about a lot of different
[11:22] different things and you could see the
[11:23] burden on his heart for the children of
[11:26] god
[11:28] dany at a point in time was working at a
[11:31] subway and at the time i think he was 15
[11:34] years old
[11:35] would you believe
[11:37] brother scott would take his car
[11:40] and drive to that mall
[11:42] the mall
[11:43] on how did they call it
[11:45] um
[11:47] um
[11:48] noble noble in 1997 there is a small
[11:51] mall day
[11:52] brother scott would drive there
[11:55] not because he was going to buy food not
[11:57] because he was hungry
[11:59] but to go and have fellowship with dany
[12:02] not once not twice
[12:05] he would just go
[12:07] and have time to talk to him
[12:09] and they had fellowship
[12:13] i mean it was just
[12:15] amazing
[12:20] the other day a brother we have not seen
[12:22] in church for a very long time came
[12:24] around
[12:26] and as soon as church was over
[12:30] the brother left
[12:32] and minutes later brother scott followed
[12:36] and when he came out he looked to the
[12:37] left
[12:38] looked to the right
[12:40] and he asked me
[12:42] what is the he mentioned the brother's
[12:43] name
[12:44] and i said he left as soon as service
[12:47] was over
[12:48] and brother brother scott said oh he
[12:50] didn't want us to see him
[12:52] i said brother scott he will come back i
[12:55] don't think this is his last time
[12:57] then brother scott stood
[12:59] and said
[13:01] a couple of days ago i was thinking
[13:02] about his children
[13:05] how they were doing
[13:07] and there were tears there was tears in
[13:09] his eyes
[13:12] how much love
[13:14] he has for children
[13:17] and not only that
[13:19] i remember when this coveted pandemic
[13:21] started
[13:23] brothers curtains just knew me
[13:25] they took
[13:26] sunday's cool materials
[13:28] and they were just driving around in the
[13:30] snow and in the cold
[13:34] going house to house
[13:37] to make sure that the children
[13:39] had something to feed on
[13:43] i mean
[13:44] this was a love story
[13:47] that you cannot
[13:49] emulate
[13:51] a wonderful
[13:52] place in his heart for children
[13:55] and it glades my heart to know that even
[13:58] the children are aware of it
[14:00] and when i talk of the children i'm not
[14:02] talking of the grown-ups like danny and
[14:03] joshua
[14:06] of course they know it
[14:08] but i remember on friday
[14:10] when we were going to the funeral
[14:12] grounds
[14:14] and i said emmanuel and gazwe should
[14:16] stay behind
[14:19] emmanuel walked into the room
[14:22] and he came to me straight
[14:24] he looked into my eyes you know how
[14:26] american children can look at people in
[14:27] the eyes
[14:29] i bought to eyeball
[14:31] and he said daddy we all knew brother's
[14:34] cat
[14:35] if we don't get to be part of this
[14:38] it will really really hurt me very bad
[14:40] i'm quoting him
[14:42] and in fact he cornered me so much
[14:46] that i had no choice
[14:48] but to tell them to get ready and follow
[14:50] us
[14:54] and
[14:55] i just want to say this to the glory of
[14:57] god that he had so much love
[15:00] for the children of god
[15:02] he had so much love for the children
[15:05] and we know that he is in a much better
[15:08] place
[15:11] we know that for sure
[15:13] that he is in a much better place and
[15:15] it's a matter of time
[15:17] that we shall see him again
[15:19] praise be to god
[15:21] god bless you sins

[22:02] brother stephen cassidy
[22:04] to give his tribute brother you have
[22:06] three minutes may god bless you
[22:38] and i'd i'd always worked you could turn
[22:41] that down a little bit i'd always worked
[22:43] on the other side of the desk i had been
[22:45] a buyer at a hospital for many years
[22:48] and um
[22:49] and so my first day in the field
[22:53] and when it was here in minnesota
[22:56] actually
[22:57] it was
[22:58] my first day i was in south dakota for
[23:00] training my first day in the field i met
[23:03] brother scott
[23:05] and
[23:06] and of course i was with my boss he was
[23:08] the owner of the company and
[23:10] you know he was all about sales and and
[23:12] that's what he was trying to do he was
[23:14] trying to make a sale and of course you
[23:16] know brother scott immediately starts
[23:18] testifying
[23:20] and of course he's like yeah you know he
[23:22] goes to you know he's telling about how
[23:24] he goes to church and all this and i'm
[23:25] thinking it's like i didn't know him
[23:27] well but i'm like
[23:28] i don't think you're on the same level
[23:31] and um
[23:32] but yeah
[23:33] i
[23:34] have to back up a little bit
[23:36] i came to the lord in 1978
[23:40] and but it was not i was not a message
[23:43] believer
[23:44] but i believed in god and when i came to
[23:46] the lord
[23:47] it was not through anybody
[23:50] other than the lord jesus christ himself
[23:54] i mean i
[23:55] i accepted the lord on the tarmac
[23:58] of
[23:59] a
[24:01] air force base
[24:03] in california
[24:05] i'd been
[24:06] at
[24:07] camp roberts california
[24:09] and god dealt with my heart
[24:12] and it was it was
[24:14] i mean it was as real as real can be
[24:17] but it still wasn't in the message and
[24:20] so that was so you know that was that
[24:22] was that was in 78 so now we're talking
[24:24] 92
[24:25] and i'm uh so i i met brother scott and
[24:28] i loved brother scott and i didn't get a
[24:30] chance to see him very often and you
[24:32] know i'd call on him when i could you
[24:33] know because i had the whole state of
[24:34] minnesota so i was making my rounds and
[24:37] and uh but whenever i could i'd i'd try
[24:39] to see brother scott and we'd
[24:41] i didn't i never sold him a thing
[24:43] but we had the most wonderful fellowship
[24:46] but the the biggest thing
[24:48] with brother scott
[24:50] and you know of course keep in mind i
[24:52] i'd been with the lord since 78 but you
[24:54] know i was not in i was in a it wasn't a
[24:57] denominational church but it was just as
[24:59] good as a denominator you know it's the
[25:01] same as a denominational church it was
[25:03] uh uh they kind of believed in uh
[25:05] actually the root their roots the roots
[25:07] of that church went back to azusa street
[25:10] and uh and they were
[25:12] assemblies of god they can't follow the
[25:14] assemblies of god doctrine and
[25:16] um but it just you know the the the
[25:18] church i was in the people it's like
[25:20] nobody was getting closer to god it's
[25:22] like everybody was getting further away
[25:24] from god it just it was just you know
[25:26] i met brother scott
[25:28] and i saw the life of jesus christ
[25:31] and it was like
[25:33] i mean i i knew there was something he
[25:35] had and i wanted
[25:37] um
[25:38] and so he um anyway so eventually he he
[25:41] you know he just kept saying well just
[25:42] come and see come and see he never once
[25:44] told me about brother branham
[25:46] he just lived the life
[25:48] the life of jesus christ and you know
[25:50] and that's the most important thing we
[25:51] can do
[25:53] is live the life of jesus christ and uh
[25:56] you know and i i i love brother scott
[25:59] someday i'm gonna see him again
[26:01] you know
[26:02] and um but i just
[26:05] you know just i was blessed to know him
[26:08] i was blessed to be his friend he was a
[26:10] true friend for 29 years
[26:13] as true as you can imagine
[26:16] so anyway god bless you all thank you

[27:03] i have no musical background
[27:06] just challenge that god
[27:08] if it is to serve the lord i mean you

[27:14] israelites he said oh i can stop mark
[27:17] and god say just go
[27:19] i am that i am
[27:21] i'll give you i'll show you the way but
[27:23] you know there's a lot of things that
[27:25] we do in the church that um
[27:28] we have those talents and sometimes we
[27:30] don't bring those talents out
[27:32] and that is the reason why we have
[27:34] brothers in the church who always
[27:36] look at you and say no you are you have
[27:38] that talent in you try to bring in our
[27:40] talent of preaching singing
[27:42] and ushering anything that you can lay
[27:44] hands on to to serve god i mean you have
[27:48] just have to come and sit and
[27:50] service is done you
[27:52] wipe the bible and go home
[27:53] but do something for god i mean it's
[27:56] worthwhile so i want to
[27:57] i miss brother scott i mean he was like
[28:00] a dad and i mean somebody who can come
[28:03] and say you can do this
[28:05] i mean just challenge yourself say yes

[1:01:26] when brother scott passed i got a text
[1:01:29] from uh i think brother lloyd or so
[1:01:31] that brother dan was coming down for the
[1:01:33] funeral
[1:01:35] we spoke a little bit on the phone i
[1:01:36] could tell from his voice
[1:01:38] that his heart was heavy
[1:01:40] so we had some few times to visit
[1:01:43] together so
[1:01:45] and in the way that
[1:01:47] we had the funeral set up
[1:01:49] i thought that okay
[1:01:51] we are not making much time for
[1:01:54] for tributes at the funeral so i will
[1:01:56] have him bring his tribute and his
[1:01:59] greetings from phoenix as well

[1:02:23] in phoenix and
[1:02:25] the
[1:02:27] brother and sister prank who couldn't
[1:02:29] come
[1:02:30] up for the funeral and stuff like that
[1:02:31] and bring
[1:02:33] their condolences and
[1:02:35] stuff i
[1:02:36] met scott and naomi in 1977
[1:02:40] one week before they got married
[1:02:59] i haven't quite wrapped my mind around
[1:03:00] at all completely to get
[1:03:03] past it but uh i will say this that
[1:03:08] in the early days
[1:03:10] of
[1:03:11] the church that was up here
[1:03:15] scott was
[1:03:16] working in a
[1:03:18] grocery store
[1:03:20] and i came up to go to bible college
[1:03:24] i was in the assemblies of god and
[1:03:27] i asked brother don fear and i said well
[1:03:30] what did brother branham say about bible
[1:03:32] college he said ah he said he didn't
[1:03:34] speak very highly of it but that was
[1:03:36] don's way of just kind of spooning me a
[1:03:38] little along and stuff he never really
[1:03:41] blasted me over with anything and so i
[1:03:44] came up and uh i got a number and made a
[1:03:48] telephone call and
[1:03:50] it was actually sister naomi and another
[1:03:52] sister that came down to the the bible
[1:03:55] college and uh
[1:04:00] and picked me up and took me up there
[1:04:02] and then the next week when i went to
[1:04:03] service uh naomi and scott weren't in
[1:04:07] service and then i found out the next
[1:04:09] week that they had gotten married
[1:04:11] on saturday so that's how far back we go
[1:04:14] and i remember uh
[1:04:16] talking to scott i said you know i said
[1:04:17] i'm working here at the at the hospital
[1:04:19] i said uh
[1:04:21] they're needing somebody why don't you
[1:04:22] come put an application in
[1:04:25] and uh
[1:04:26] he came down and put an application in
[1:04:28] and started i asked the the guy that uh
[1:04:31] interviewed him his name was john
[1:04:32] claussen i said well you're gonna hire
[1:04:34] him he says yeah
[1:04:36] he says if i hire him he says i don't
[1:04:37] have to buy another forklift because
[1:04:39] scott was so big
[1:04:42] and
[1:04:43] so that's
[1:04:44] you know that's how far back we go i
[1:04:46] would like to
[1:04:49] scott had a poem he liked and i like
[1:04:52] poems
[1:04:53] but i'd like to just recite it for you
[1:04:55] just because
[1:04:57] i even think he gave it to me on a on a
[1:05:00] in a framed one time
[1:05:02] it goes like this
[1:05:04] to us battered and scarred
[1:05:06] the auctioneer
[1:05:08] thought it scarcely worth his while
[1:05:10] to waste much time on that old violin
[1:05:12] but he held it up with a smile he said
[1:05:15] what am i bid for this old violin and
[1:05:17] who will start the bidding for me
[1:05:19] one dollar one dollar now two only two
[1:05:22] two dollars who make it three three
[1:05:23] dollars once three dollars twice
[1:05:26] going and almost gone
[1:05:29] but from the room far back
[1:05:31] a gray-haired man came forward and
[1:05:33] picked up the bow
[1:05:34] he wiped the dust off the old violin he
[1:05:37] tightened up all the strings
[1:05:39] he played a melody pure and sweet
[1:05:42] as sweet as the angel
[1:05:44] sings
[1:05:45] the music ceased
[1:05:47] in the auctioneer
[1:05:48] with a voice that was quiet and low he
[1:05:51] said what am i bid for this old violin
[1:05:53] as he held it up with a bow
[1:05:55] one thousand dollars one thousand who
[1:05:56] make it two two thousand who'll make it
[1:05:58] three
[1:05:59] three thousand once
[1:06:01] three thousand twice going and gone said
[1:06:03] he
[1:06:05] the people cheered
[1:06:07] but some of them cried we don't quite
[1:06:08] understand
[1:06:10] what chains it's worth he replied the
[1:06:12] touch of the master's hand
[1:06:15] many a man with life out of tomb and
[1:06:17] life scarred and battered by sin
[1:06:19] is auctioned cheap to a thoughtless
[1:06:21] crowd
[1:06:22] much like that old violin
[1:06:26] a glass of wine
[1:06:29] a mess of pottage a game he travels on
[1:06:31] he's going once he's going twice he's
[1:06:34] going and almost gone then the master
[1:06:36] comes
[1:06:37] and a foolish crowd never can quite
[1:06:39] understand the worth of a soul in the
[1:06:41] chains it's rot by the touch of the
[1:06:43] master's hand
[1:06:47] that would be my testimony
[1:06:50] [Applause]
[1:07:00] praise the lord
[1:07:01] praise the lord
[1:07:04] praise the lord
[1:07:07] we will
[1:07:09] we will keep uh
[1:07:11] talking about brother's cat and and on
[1:07:14] and on until we get to meet him
[1:07:17] i mean he was he was such a man you know
[1:07:20] there was nothing but scared i think god
[1:07:23] built him the way he was
[1:07:25] he had such a tech skin
[1:07:28] nothing could get under his skin
[1:07:31] nothing
[1:07:33] nothing
[1:07:34] [Laughter]
[1:07:39] maybe after you left he got more taker
[1:07:43] yeah maybe after you left he got more
[1:07:45] taker
[1:07:47] but scared
[1:07:48] after the pastor that pastor this church
[1:07:51] before me left
[1:07:54] for some reason he kind of uh
[1:07:57] fed on his love to jump in the saddle in
[1:07:59] the sense
[1:08:00] and bringing him preachers
[1:08:03] uh and all of that
[1:08:05] and there were a lot of things
[1:08:06] i mean one time we sat down and he
[1:08:08] started to tell me some of the things
[1:08:10] that people were saying about him
[1:08:12] and uh
[1:08:14] and then when he's you know you know
[1:08:15] brother scan
[1:08:16] as as tough as he was it was not so uh
[1:08:19] difficult for him to cry
[1:08:21] i mean he would yes he would just bustle
[1:08:23] and start to cry then and we were
[1:08:25] talking some things uh you know
[1:08:27] personally and about the ministry and
[1:08:29] different things
[1:08:31] and uh
[1:08:33] yeah but uh he was he was such a
[1:08:35] wonderful man
[1:08:37] and we will
[1:08:40] we will uh
[1:08:41] sister leah
[1:08:42] uh
[1:08:44] my brother joseph army
[1:08:46] wife
[1:08:47] got into
[1:08:49] contraction this morning
[1:08:51] and so they had russia back to the
[1:08:53] hospital we thought it was yesterday
[1:08:55] didn't that happen
[1:08:56] this morning again she they had to rush
[1:08:58] back to the hospital
[1:09:00] and it happened that my wife is in the
[1:09:02] area there so she
[1:09:03] she decided that she would she would
[1:09:05] stop there and help
[1:09:07] and uh
[1:09:10] sister kelly
[1:09:12] have a
[1:09:13] prayer request here and she's asking
[1:09:15] that we continue to pray for her sister
[1:09:17] teresa
[1:09:19] she's sick with kovac and yesterday she
[1:09:21] was diagnosed with corvic pneumonia
[1:09:24] so she acts that we pray
[1:09:28] and then uh
[1:09:31] with everything that was happening
[1:09:32] around us
[1:09:34] the lord will stay faithful
[1:09:38] in speaking to us and dealing with us in
[1:09:40] different ways
[1:09:46] and and god has a way of preparing his
[1:09:49] people
[1:09:50] and he also have a way of comforting his
[1:09:52] people
[1:09:54] he prepare us for our trials
[1:09:57] never tell us what it's going to be
[1:09:59] never tell us how long we're going to be
[1:10:01] in it
[1:10:02] but yet he will prepare us and then when
[1:10:05] we get when we start going through
[1:10:06] trials then we think oh i wonder this is
[1:10:09] what was coming
[1:10:11] you know and but then and and and while
[1:10:15] we going through it he has a way to come
[1:10:17] back and comfort us
[1:10:19] and uh

[1:10:36] messages uh
[1:10:38] for for the ones that we pray
[1:10:42] and
[1:10:43] and i think she got uh texting with
[1:10:45] sister naomi and uh
[1:10:47] uh for some reason
[1:10:49] she felt inspired to text cisco naomi
[1:10:52] that uh
[1:10:53] there are songs
[1:10:55] that angels will not sing
[1:10:58] you know
[1:11:00] you know never never even say anything

[1:11:04] brothers cat but
[1:11:05] just texts are there songs that angels
[1:11:07] will not sing
[1:11:09] and then uh
[1:11:13] uh
[1:11:14] there was another sister that had
[1:11:16] had dreaming you know and and was
[1:11:19] struggling over it a little bit
[1:11:21] and uh
[1:11:22] trying to
[1:11:24] to blow it away but it was always coming
[1:11:27] to her with the exact color of what
[1:11:30] brother scat coughing was
[1:11:32] so until she saw the coughing
[1:11:34] then she understood why she was having
[1:11:36] that dream
[1:11:41] and uh
[1:11:44] but before we prayed and entered the
[1:11:48] the service this morning
[1:11:51] i have a vision written before me
[1:11:56] brother wesley had this vision
[1:11:59] november 9th
[1:12:03] 2021
[1:12:06] it was between 6 a.m and
[1:12:10] 7 00 a.m in the morning
[1:12:13] and this this is not the first vision
[1:12:15] that brother wesley have had
[1:12:17] i think the lord kind of a blessing in
[1:12:19] that area
[1:12:21] something down from his father or
[1:12:23] grandfather that was a minister
[1:12:27] it was between 6 a.m and 7 a.m in the
[1:12:30] morning
[1:12:31] i was up
[1:12:33] in the air looking down
[1:12:36] on
[1:12:39] a memorial guiding
[1:12:41] it was like i was in
[1:12:44] a little drone above the garden and
[1:12:46] cycled around
[1:12:48] i saw the trees
[1:12:50] and the rolls of marker
[1:12:53] and i saw lots
[1:12:55] of little grain bushes on the ground
[1:12:58] i thought
[1:13:00] they were probably
[1:13:04] in containers
[1:13:05] i thought they will evergreen
[1:13:09] in their containers but actually
[1:13:13] they will
[1:13:16] they will
[1:13:17] christmas
[1:13:18] weather
[1:13:20] on people's grave
[1:13:23] i was up in the air
[1:13:25] i saw
[1:13:26] a little image of a person kind
[1:13:30] of a rose out of the ground
[1:13:34] all at once
[1:13:38] he was there
[1:13:40] he had white boxing gloves on
[1:13:44] and he raised his hands above his head
[1:13:47] and shouted
[1:13:49] i won
[1:13:52] he was a boxer
[1:13:55] and had just won his battle
[1:13:59] i was wondering
[1:14:00] why it was a boxer
[1:14:03] but after watching the memorial service
[1:14:06] for brother scared
[1:14:08] brothers brother scared greeted us
[1:14:11] as he just finished taking taking his
[1:14:15] suit off
[1:14:16] and called our attention to what he was
[1:14:19] doing saying
[1:14:20] we might be able
[1:14:23] to play it back in slow
[1:14:26] motion he had just taken off his suit
[1:14:30] and his tie
[1:14:32] that he was wearing he said barely heard
[1:14:35] on the microphone now
[1:14:37] we are ready for battle
[1:14:40] after having removed his
[1:14:44] coat suit and tie that is what
[1:14:47] was needed
[1:14:48] for wesley to identify the person
[1:14:52] in the memorial garden as brothers cat
[1:14:56] but in the vision
[1:14:57] brothers cat was teen
[1:15:00] and muscular
[1:15:03] he had a white boxing glove on and had
[1:15:05] just won his battle
[1:15:08] but wesley was thinking about
[1:15:10] the day when lazarus came out of the
[1:15:12] grave
[1:15:14] it was
[1:15:15] the fourth day
[1:15:17] november nine
[1:15:18] was the fourth day
[1:15:20] of
[1:15:21] brother scared
[1:15:23] at the time that brother scat
[1:15:26] was giving this testimony february 20
[1:15:30] 2020 he and sister naomi had just
[1:15:33] stopped to see us
[1:15:35] on their way back to minnesota
[1:15:38] about a month and a half previous to
[1:15:42] that service
[1:15:43] he had told us the testimony about
[1:15:46] brother wright and brother life fountain
[1:15:48] we wish we had
[1:15:50] the tip recording

[1:16:12] or any word
[1:16:13] that was just right to be read before
[1:16:16] the local church

[1:25:29] amen the lord bless you you may have
[1:25:31] your seed
[1:25:32] this morning
[1:25:37] uh i first titled my message clock in
[1:25:40] and clock out
[1:25:45] i talked to my message clock in and
[1:25:47] clocked out
[1:25:49] but then i thought i said well
[1:25:53] the people that goes to work might think
[1:25:55] i'm chasing them or
[1:25:56] i'm trying to peek on them and says all
[1:25:59] you think about is just clocking and
[1:26:00] clock out
[1:26:03] but actually what i was going to talk
[1:26:05] about
[1:26:06] is
[1:26:07] there is one that clocks us into this
[1:26:10] life
[1:26:11] and he's the only one that can clock us
[1:26:13] out
[1:26:15] our time here
[1:26:17] we never clock ourselves in
[1:26:20] so we don't we don't have control
[1:26:23] on how much time
[1:26:24] we can be here
[1:26:27] you don't have control over it
[1:26:30] there is a man that clocked you in
[1:26:32] and when it's time for you to be clocked
[1:26:34] out
[1:26:35] there's nothing you can do about it
[1:26:39] i want to talk about
[1:26:41] the divine watchmaker
[1:26:43] brother branham
[1:26:45] talks about
[1:26:47] uh he talks about the famous watch over
[1:26:50] and over we will read quotes about
[1:26:51] brother branham where he talks about the
[1:26:54] famous watch he will talks about you see
[1:26:56] the watch and and he talks about you see
[1:26:59] all everything moving in that famous
[1:27:01] watch
[1:27:02] and and and but he said there was a mean
[1:27:06] spring
[1:27:08] there was a mainspring
[1:27:12] that was very important
[1:27:14] to that famous watch
[1:27:17] so this morning i want to talk about the
[1:27:19] divine
[1:27:21] watch
[1:27:22] maker
[1:27:31] praise the lord
[1:27:33] amen
[1:27:39] bishop william
[1:27:41] pilot
[1:27:42] 1818 he said this about watches
[1:27:48] he said the watch
[1:27:50] with eight gears
[1:27:52] and the spring
[1:27:54] and all the mechanism
[1:27:58] could never arise
[1:28:02] by action
[1:28:04] of
[1:28:05] random chance
[1:28:09] alone
[1:28:14] he says the the the watch with with all
[1:28:17] of his gears that makes it to give time
[1:28:20] and everything that is put together
[1:28:23] never came together
[1:28:25] by random change
[1:28:28] praise the lord
[1:28:32] there is an intelligence
[1:28:35] that put that watch together
[1:28:44] and you realize that uh
[1:28:48] even as we sit here this morning
[1:28:50] there are different times time zones i
[1:28:53] was just asking brother dan i think
[1:28:55] there is the the allen owl ahead of us
[1:28:58] there in uh uh phoenix and i think uh
[1:29:02] north carolina too if i'm right
[1:29:04] and we have different time zones you
[1:29:07] know when i was
[1:29:08] when i was small
[1:29:11] i was i was of this idea
[1:29:14] of you know uh uh
[1:29:18] our parents used to like to listen to
[1:29:20] the bbc news
[1:29:22] and and when it come time for news it
[1:29:24] gave beeps and beeps and beeps there was
[1:29:26] a setting sound and music
[1:29:29] and uh and then everybody look at that
[1:29:31] their watch
[1:29:33] and then pretty soon you find people
[1:29:34] start wanting their watches to set a
[1:29:37] right
[1:29:38] so in my mind as a child i used to say
[1:29:42] why the thing that one is right
[1:29:46] why is it right
[1:29:49] praise the lord i just i i
[1:29:52] would just i was i was always i would
[1:29:54] every day i mean i can remember it will
[1:29:57] always come to my mind like that
[1:29:59] and then uh
[1:30:02] my mommy bought me my first watch
[1:30:05] and
[1:30:07] i thought my time was right i didn't
[1:30:09] care about
[1:30:11] what was your time
[1:30:13] my time is right
[1:30:17] praise the lord nobody going to convince
[1:30:19] me that your time is right in mind
[1:30:24] praise the lord until i became smart
[1:30:28] there was a little there was a little
[1:30:30] writing on the back of the watch called
[1:30:32] water resistance
[1:30:37] wow
[1:30:39] so i waited until nobody was looking and
[1:30:41] i put my hand down
[1:30:43] in the water
[1:30:46] when i took it off the watch started
[1:30:47] blinking his eyes i mean
[1:30:53] i never forget it there that was my
[1:30:55] first watch i had to take it out and and
[1:30:57] hide it but pretty soon mama realized i
[1:31:00] was not wearing it where is your watch
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:08] yes yes yeah definitely i had too hoy
[1:31:10] was water resistant
[1:31:16] the lord
[1:31:17] but
[1:31:24] there are
[1:31:26] two identical
[1:31:28] atomic clock
[1:31:31] one is located
[1:31:33] in the national institute of standard
[1:31:35] and technology
[1:31:37] in colorado
[1:31:40] and the other one is uh
[1:31:43] in the royal observatory
[1:31:46] in greenwich england
[1:31:49] and these two clocks
[1:31:53] both of them
[1:31:55] are
[1:31:56] the most accurate
[1:32:00] better than one second
[1:32:02] in the million years
[1:32:07] these two clocks
[1:32:10] they are the most
[1:32:13] accurate
[1:32:20] actually
[1:32:23] uh
[1:32:29] is proving
[1:32:32] that the accuracy
[1:32:35] of your time the accuracy of time
[1:32:40] of time measurement
[1:32:43] determine
[1:32:45] the precision
[1:32:48] of your navigation
[1:32:54] the accuracy of time measurement
[1:32:58] determine
[1:33:00] the precision
[1:33:01] of your navigation that's why we have
[1:33:05] all of these gps
[1:33:07] you can put from here to colorado put
[1:33:10] the address
[1:33:12] and the gps is going to tell you at what
[1:33:16] time
[1:33:18] you're going to get there
[1:33:21] the first time i started using gps2 i i
[1:33:24] i fussed with it
[1:33:26] i'm asking myself in my mind i'm saying
[1:33:29] are you taking consideration of the rail
[1:33:31] lights
[1:33:33] and the traffic this time that you are
[1:33:35] giving me
[1:33:37] are you considering that that we have
[1:33:39] real idea i'm not the only one driving
[1:33:41] on the road
[1:33:44] but
[1:33:46] that uh
[1:33:48] uh a precision
[1:33:50] and a navigation
[1:33:54] is determined by time measurement
[1:33:59] are we together
[1:34:01] now watch now we're talking about the
[1:34:04] divine watchmaker
[1:34:06] i took this i took that talk from
[1:34:08] something i was listening to
[1:34:10] and uh
[1:34:13] some time ago
[1:34:17] so
[1:34:19] with that being said
[1:34:21] you also realize that it's also uh uh
[1:34:25] recorded and proving
[1:34:28] that the the clock in colorado
[1:34:32] it takes
[1:34:34] five seconds
[1:34:36] a year
[1:34:38] faster
[1:34:40] than the one
[1:34:44] in
[1:34:45] witch
[1:34:46] both of them
[1:34:47] are proving to be the most
[1:34:50] accurate
[1:34:51] time
[1:34:54] praise the lord
[1:34:58] but yet it's proving that the one in
[1:35:00] colorado takes
[1:35:02] move
[1:35:03] five seconds a year faster
[1:35:06] than the one
[1:35:07] in
[1:35:09] england
[1:35:10] so then which one is right
[1:35:18] both of them are right
[1:35:22] the reason both of them are right is
[1:35:24] because
[1:35:25] the one in colorado
[1:35:28] is
[1:35:29] 5400 feet in attitude
[1:35:34] and the one in england
[1:35:36] is 80
[1:35:40] feet so the more
[1:35:43] higher you go
[1:35:45] the lighter you are
[1:35:49] and it looks like
[1:35:51] you have more speed
[1:35:54] that's the reason why
[1:35:56] the airplane speed faster than the
[1:35:58] vehicle
[1:36:04] are we together
[1:36:10] but both of them are right the only
[1:36:11] thing that makes it different is just
[1:36:13] the altitude
[1:36:16] the one in colorado is more upper than
[1:36:19] the one in england
[1:36:25] praise the lord
[1:36:28] so even with
[1:36:30] our visitors that might be traveling
[1:36:33] back today or tomorrow
[1:36:35] and you have to go by the way of an
[1:36:37] airplane
[1:36:38] you realize that
[1:36:51] your altitude when you are flying
[1:36:55] the changing altitude is seen in your
[1:36:58] attitude
[1:37:01] praise lord
[1:37:03] the moment the plane starts to take up
[1:37:07] you start holding for the seed
[1:37:13] praise lord
[1:37:18] when you are leaving
[1:37:21] and growing up
[1:37:24] the altitude change and it affects your
[1:37:27] attitude it affects the way you behave
[1:37:31] if i can fall asleep i enjoy it that way
[1:37:36] praise the lord
[1:37:39] trying to get get you somewhere this
[1:37:41] morning
[1:37:42] with all of these
[1:37:44] time things
[1:37:45] that i'm talking
[1:37:46] about let's read isaiah chapter 46
[1:37:52] verse 10.
[1:37:57] this is uh will be a familiar verse to
[1:37:59] you
[1:38:06] the scripture says here
[1:38:18] let's read from verse 8 isaiah 46 from
[1:38:21] verse 8 remember this and show yourself
[1:38:24] and show yourself man
[1:38:27] bring it again to mine oh ye
[1:38:29] transgressor
[1:38:31] remember the formal things of all
[1:38:35] for i am god
[1:38:37] and there is none s
[1:38:40] i am god and there is no like me
[1:38:44] declaring
[1:38:46] the end
[1:38:48] from
[1:38:49] the beginning
[1:38:51] praise the lord
[1:38:54] and from ancient times and things that
[1:38:58] are not yet done
[1:39:01] say my counsel shall stand
[1:39:05] and i will do all my pleasures
[1:39:09] i am the law that is known as declaring
[1:39:12] the end from the beginning
[1:39:16] so in the word of the lord it shows us
[1:39:20] that god
[1:39:22] is outside of our time space
[1:39:27] he's not controlled by your seconds and
[1:39:30] your meanings he's not controlled by uh
[1:39:34] uh uh you know your your winter and
[1:39:36] summer he's completely out
[1:39:39] of time space
[1:39:43] praise the lord
[1:39:45] because we have to realize that he's
[1:39:47] their internal one
[1:39:51] he created time
[1:39:55] praise the lord
[1:39:57] but he's not controlled by time
[1:40:01] he knows the end from the beginning
[1:40:05] praise the lord
[1:40:09] it's almost like if you have if you went
[1:40:12] down
[1:40:13] to see a parade
[1:40:16] and you are standing on the on the on
[1:40:18] the side of the street and the martian
[1:40:20] groups are coming you see them as they
[1:40:23] come you only see this one you look back
[1:40:25] okay those ones down there they are
[1:40:26] wearing gold uniform you see that you
[1:40:29] can't see the next one until they come
[1:40:31] around the corner
[1:40:33] you want to see
[1:40:34] the ones that come and pass before you
[1:40:38] praise the lord
[1:40:40] that is the way in our time
[1:40:44] what you know right now is that i'm
[1:40:47] standing here
[1:40:48] preaching to you praise the lord
[1:40:51] that's what you know
[1:40:53] every other thing that your mind is is
[1:40:56] is reaching out for you don't know that
[1:40:59] you're just guessing
[1:41:01] i hope when i get home my food is there
[1:41:03] i hope
[1:41:04] i hope you you just i mean you but what
[1:41:07] you know right now is what
[1:41:09] is before you
[1:41:12] but there is a neighbor
[1:41:15] in the place of the parade that leaves
[1:41:19] up on the seventh floor
[1:41:24] and when that neighbor gets
[1:41:26] on her balcony she can see the beginning
[1:41:32] of the parade
[1:41:34] amen
[1:41:36] and she can see the end she can look
[1:41:38] here and look here and look here and
[1:41:40] look all over
[1:41:44] praise the lord
[1:41:49] are we together
[1:41:55] for us life
[1:41:57] is a sequence
[1:41:59] of past
[1:42:00] present
[1:42:01] and future
[1:42:06] that's what we call life
[1:42:09] that's what we know as life
[1:42:12] we talk about our past
[1:42:14] we talk about what we what we know is
[1:42:17] presently happening and we we we guess
[1:42:19] we probe and hope
[1:42:21] that what is happening now will bring us
[1:42:24] a better future
[1:42:27] for us it's a sequence of past present
[1:42:31] and future
[1:42:33] praise the lord
[1:42:37] but the one that has the advantage point
[1:42:43] to them life is simultaneous
[1:42:47] he can look here he can look there he
[1:42:49] can see everything
[1:42:51] he can see these other ones they put
[1:42:53] their drums down and they are sitting
[1:42:55] down waiting for the the you know for
[1:42:57] the group to go and then they can jump
[1:42:59] back up he sees you that are standing by
[1:43:01] that corner you are just enjoying the
[1:43:03] group that is coming
[1:43:05] right as they turn the corner
[1:43:12] god is out of our time space
[1:43:17] and that is the reason why he can drop
[1:43:20] down into time
[1:43:24] and fulfill his word
[1:43:27] nothing picks him by surprise
[1:43:30] nothing take god by surprise
[1:43:33] that is the reason why it's better for
[1:43:36] you to be on god's time than to try to
[1:43:39] put him on your time
[1:43:46] praise the lord
[1:43:48] amen
[1:43:57] i wrote this down
[1:43:59] it was said one time by albert einstein
[1:44:02] he said people like us
[1:44:04] who believe in physic
[1:44:07] says no base
[1:44:12] he says know that the distinction
[1:44:15] between past present and future
[1:44:18] is
[1:44:18] a stubborn
[1:44:20] persistent
[1:44:22] illusion
[1:44:25] praise lord
[1:44:27] in another way is because
[1:44:30] because uh uh uh uh we we are in this
[1:44:33] place where the
[1:44:35] uh uh uh
[1:44:36] our our life here is is is governed by
[1:44:40] this sequence of past present and future
[1:44:43] is in a place where sometimes we we we
[1:44:46] become stubborn to think there because
[1:44:49] this thing happened to me in the past
[1:44:53] so is going to produce this as a result
[1:44:59] we we we become stubborn to to uh uh
[1:45:03] put seven things in our mind
[1:45:07] not realizing that
[1:45:12] there is a god they have all the our
[1:45:15] steps
[1:45:17] they have numbers our days
[1:45:20] he even numbered the head on our head
[1:45:26] praise the lord that's right
[1:45:29] amen
[1:45:30] and he gave boundaries
[1:45:33] to all things
[1:45:36] he lay our boundaries that we cannot
[1:45:38] cross
[1:45:40] that's right
[1:45:41] praise the lord
[1:45:44] but
[1:45:45] our human instinct constantly tell us
[1:45:49] and that's the reason why sometimes
[1:45:51] we lost trust in people
[1:45:55] oh he did that to me oh somebody did
[1:45:59] that same thing to me and and this god
[1:46:01] is behaving the same way i can trust him
[1:46:05] why is is because we are in that
[1:46:09] sequence of past present and future
[1:46:16] and it's something that sometimes we
[1:46:18] become stubborn until
[1:46:22] the grace of god brings a birth and
[1:46:26] brings us to the place where we can say
[1:46:28] like like our poor
[1:46:31] i live by faith
[1:46:33] and not by sight
[1:46:39] praise the lord
[1:46:46] when you look at the watch and you look
[1:46:48] at you know well now we all go into
[1:46:51] digital watching and all of that praise
[1:46:54] the lord
[1:46:55] and uh
[1:47:00] you realize uh
[1:47:02] you know uh such a blessing now we have
[1:47:05] a wash that can you know it can tell you
[1:47:07] how many steps you know you all can and
[1:47:10] all of that but think about it this way
[1:47:12] let me drop back to something that i was
[1:47:14] thinking about last night think about it
[1:47:16] this way
[1:47:19] the
[1:47:20] watch even before the digital watch the
[1:47:25] the switch watch and uh
[1:47:27] and then the most expensive one
[1:47:30] and and as you can call it
[1:47:33] i call into uh uh
[1:47:44] according to the scientists
[1:47:46] they said that the watch
[1:47:49] is a simple loop
[1:47:52] system
[1:47:54] praise the lord
[1:47:55] it's a simple loop you look at it you
[1:47:57] see everything moving in there you see
[1:47:59] the second hands moving and you see
[1:48:01] everything
[1:48:02] they call it a simple loop system
[1:48:06] because
[1:48:07] it all goes down to the mean spring
[1:48:14] when the mainspring gets out of other
[1:48:18] you just have a decoration on your hands
[1:48:23] praise the lord
[1:48:25] you just have a decoration
[1:48:27] and yet we paid money
[1:48:30] which of course i'm not i'm not coming
[1:48:32] against you wearing watch don't don't
[1:48:34] think about that i'm talking about the
[1:48:36] divine watchmaker i'm talking about
[1:48:38] almighty god
[1:48:40] praise the lord
[1:48:41] amen
[1:48:43] oh i've watched i've wore watch that is
[1:48:46] not working
[1:48:50] praise the lord
[1:48:53] i just feel like it would make me look
[1:48:55] nice
[1:48:58] if anybody asks me for my time i look on
[1:49:00] my phone and tell you my time
[1:49:04] praise the lord
[1:49:06] does that relax you
[1:49:07] it relax you i can preach now okay okay
[1:49:12] okay
[1:49:17] it's a simple loop system
[1:49:20] yeah
[1:49:22] the wrist that the watch sits on
[1:49:25] is called a complex closed system
[1:49:33] we fuss about the money we pay for the
[1:49:35] watch and then and and and and and that
[1:49:38] the brand name of the watch and and all
[1:49:40] of that
[1:49:44] but yet it cannot be compared
[1:49:48] to the wrists
[1:49:50] that you put the wash
[1:49:54] on it's called a a complex close loop
[1:49:58] system
[1:50:03] the race adopts
[1:50:06] to the change of weather
[1:50:09] praise the lord
[1:50:11] you are wearing coats
[1:50:14] and methinks
[1:50:16] is because
[1:50:18] down here is cold
[1:50:20] when you get to arizona you might not
[1:50:22] need that jacket better dan
[1:50:29] so the race adopts
[1:50:33] to the change of weather
[1:50:37] it fights its own
[1:50:40] invaders
[1:50:42] if you should get some kind of illness
[1:50:44] that goes through your race
[1:50:48] your immune system saints sent out force
[1:50:51] to fight against that sickness
[1:50:55] praise the lord
[1:50:58] and it also is a self-repairing
[1:51:03] system
[1:51:07] because when you get a cut on your hands
[1:51:10] it can heal
[1:51:13] praise the lord
[1:51:16] when that means spring like i said
[1:51:19] leaves the watch it's just a decoration
[1:51:21] on your hands
[1:51:24] it can never repair itself
[1:51:28] praise the lord
[1:51:32] do you see what i'm going to with this
[1:51:33] divine
[1:51:34] watchmaker
[1:51:39] praise the lord
[1:51:42] so we realized that
[1:51:47] there is a bigger picture
[1:51:50] beyond what our eyes can see
[1:51:54] and what we think our mind understand
[1:51:59] there's a far bigger picture
[1:52:02] praise the lord
[1:52:07] so as we talk about this divine
[1:52:10] watchmaker
[1:52:13] we realize that
[1:52:16] just like how the natural watch
[1:52:19] had a designer they put their name there
[1:52:24] there is also
[1:52:26] one that designed our time
[1:52:31] where are we going to be at a particular
[1:52:33] time
[1:52:34] in life
[1:52:37] there is an intelligence
[1:52:39] that have designed that
[1:52:42] and as time beats
[1:52:45] it influences our life brother branham
[1:52:48] said in the message choosing of a bride
[1:52:50] he says the decision you make this
[1:52:53] morning
[1:52:55] will determine where you will be five
[1:52:58] years from now
[1:53:01] praise the lord
[1:53:04] amen
[1:53:13] so we realize that
[1:53:16] we are not here by chance
[1:53:20] if this watch had an intelligence that
[1:53:22] puts it together
[1:53:24] that it can put a mechanism in it to be
[1:53:27] able to count my steps
[1:53:32] praise the lord
[1:53:34] there is one that had an intelligence
[1:53:37] that order
[1:53:39] our steps
[1:53:42] he don't count it he order it
[1:53:49] he order how many steps we will take
[1:53:53] from the day we talk our first steps
[1:53:59] he order the places we will pass
[1:54:03] the people we will meet amen
[1:54:08] praise the lord
[1:54:12] all we know
[1:54:14] is just
[1:54:15] in this little box
[1:54:18] of live sequence of past
[1:54:21] present and future
[1:54:24] that's the reason why we can trust
[1:54:28] the almighty god we can trust the great
[1:54:30] infinite one
[1:54:36] that know the end
[1:54:38] from the beginning
[1:54:40] praise the lord
[1:54:41] that's the reason why god
[1:54:43] can can commit a promise he can give
[1:54:46] prophecy and yet he can make sure he
[1:54:49] watch over his word because he knows
[1:54:51] exactly what is going to happen
[1:54:54] you think about this
[1:54:57] jesus
[1:54:59] in his ministry and to see how
[1:55:02] the the sanhedrin's council were so
[1:55:06] i mean they were so dogmatic
[1:55:09] that jesus would come according to
[1:55:13] isaiah prophecy
[1:55:15] he will walk right into the temple
[1:55:19] they don't have no record of him
[1:55:24] and when he walked there he take the
[1:55:27] book
[1:55:29] open to where it is written the spirit
[1:55:32] of the lord god is upon me
[1:55:36] praise the lord
[1:55:38] and as he's reading it every word is
[1:55:40] quiet
[1:55:43] everybody is sitting down looking at him
[1:55:46] the bible says he reads he closed the
[1:55:48] book
[1:55:50] he handed it back to the priest
[1:55:53] nobody asks him a question
[1:55:56] amen
[1:55:58] he sat down the service was over he went
[1:56:01] home and he says what kind of a man was
[1:56:03] that where did he came from
[1:56:07] praise the lord the same almighty god
[1:56:12] that means there was a second part to
[1:56:14] that scripture
[1:56:16] that was supposed to be fulfilled
[1:56:18] when mary bannon was preaching birth
[1:56:20] pains
[1:56:21] god took control of the sin
[1:56:25] amen
[1:56:26] order his wife to buy him a new brain
[1:56:29] bible
[1:56:31] and he will have the pages stuck
[1:56:33] together
[1:56:34] he will try to find it
[1:56:37] why because god has already determined
[1:56:40] that that time
[1:56:43] at that time there is not a meaning or a
[1:56:46] second with past this is the time when
[1:56:48] my world will be fulfilled
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:52] god will set the scene
[1:56:55] and allowed a priest to hand him a bible
[1:57:00] and he will open the bible and read his
[1:57:03] text
[1:57:04] he would take the bible give it back to
[1:57:06] the priests
[1:57:08] he will preach his scripture or his
[1:57:10] semen
[1:57:11] and as his living
[1:57:15] the holy spirit will remind him
[1:57:20] what has just happened
[1:57:24] it's written
[1:57:26] praise the lord
[1:57:29] he said you you yeah the echo
[1:57:32] in his ear this day
[1:57:34] this scripture
[1:57:35] is fulfilled
[1:57:41] this day
[1:57:42] this scripture
[1:57:44] is fulfilled
[1:57:47] praise the lord
[1:57:54] don't take too much praise
[1:57:57] that you brought yourself here to this
[1:57:58] church this morning
[1:58:00] there is one that order your steps here
[1:58:02] and there is nothing you could have done
[1:58:04] about it
[1:58:07] you might have not had it on your
[1:58:08] calendar
[1:58:09] you might have not dreamed about it
[1:58:12] a few months ago you might have not
[1:58:14] played it
[1:58:16] but on his divine calendar
[1:58:19] it was destined
[1:58:21] that we will be here this morning
[1:58:23] praise the lord so please don't hurry me
[1:58:26] whatever time
[1:58:27] that he have destined for us to spend
[1:58:30] together less many together
[1:58:34] [Applause]
[1:58:39] amen
[1:58:41] praise the lord
[1:58:44] praise the lord
[1:58:47] amen
[1:58:49] you see and these things happen
[1:58:53] and pretty soon
[1:58:56] we become conscious of how how much
[1:58:59] finite we are
[1:59:02] praise the lord
[1:59:03] how much if god don't help us
[1:59:05] we will make wrong choices
[1:59:11] we will deny ourselves from blessings
[1:59:14] pretty soon we realize that but you see
[1:59:16] there is a stubborn
[1:59:19] persistent
[1:59:21] thing
[1:59:22] that want to keep us
[1:59:25] in this box of past
[1:59:27] pressing
[1:59:31] and future
[1:59:34] praise the lord
[1:59:36] amen
[1:59:41] oh what almighty god we self
[1:59:45] what almighty god we serve
[1:59:53] in message divine love he says this
[1:59:58] talking about the famous watch
[2:00:00] the little mean spring in the middle
[2:00:04] of the watch time
[2:00:07] the middle the little mainspring in the
[2:00:10] middle of the watch times that watch
[2:00:14] to everything
[2:00:18] it times that watch to everything
[2:00:24] and when god loves
[2:00:28] and when god is love and love moves into
[2:00:31] your heart
[2:00:34] it times
[2:00:36] every emotion
[2:00:38] and every
[2:00:40] right with god's
[2:00:42] bible
[2:00:45] you don't want to show the people
[2:00:49] what a fine crystal you
[2:00:52] got what a fine face it got talking
[2:00:56] about your watch now
[2:00:59] it's not working though
[2:01:02] what a fine hand you got
[2:01:05] a fine ruby
[2:01:07] a god
[2:01:09] but what a wonderful time peace
[2:01:16] it is
[2:01:18] the word is sick and
[2:01:20] tired of looking at great big spears and
[2:01:24] looking at fine dress
[2:01:26] people
[2:01:27] and looking at a bunch of acing they
[2:01:30] want to see the genuine love
[2:01:33] of gods
[2:01:35] in the heart of his people
[2:01:38] that's what the word is looking for
[2:01:41] the word is dying for love the church is
[2:01:44] dying for love and jesus said ye are the
[2:01:48] salt
[2:01:49] of the earth
[2:01:50] praise the lord
[2:01:52] but when the sword lost his heaven
[2:01:54] it is hands forward good for nothing
[2:01:57] but to be thrown on the feet of man
[2:02:00] praise the lord
[2:02:02] and if the church has lost
[2:02:05] it divine revelation
[2:02:09] of the love of god
[2:02:13] that was the thought that caught my
[2:02:14] heart in that
[2:02:17] paragraph i just read to you
[2:02:20] there is a divine revelation
[2:02:22] of the love of god many people think the
[2:02:25] love of god is charity
[2:02:27] you know it's just it's it's it's being
[2:02:30] nice
[2:02:33] and they just think the love of god uh
[2:02:35] uh you know that the first thing you
[2:02:37] know i mean and i mean that's what
[2:02:39] astonished the the the the pharisees
[2:02:42] when they saw jesus whipping the people
[2:02:44] out of the temple
[2:02:46] i mean they could not associate that
[2:02:49] with all the miracles that he was doing
[2:02:51] and all the kind words that he was
[2:02:53] speaking
[2:02:55] but they didn't know that in god law
[2:02:57] there is correction
[2:02:59] there is a divine revelation
[2:03:02] of the love of god
[2:03:05] that have been displayed to us in this
[2:03:07] age that we are living in amen
[2:03:09] praise the lord amen
[2:03:11] we're in his law we realize that love
[2:03:16] there is a sacrificial love
[2:03:19] praise the lord
[2:03:20] we realize that there is corrective love
[2:03:24] we realize there is redeeming
[2:03:26] love praise the lord can you imagine
[2:03:30] that god
[2:03:32] god telling abraham to prove his love
[2:03:37] by sacrificing
[2:03:39] his son
[2:03:43] praise the lord
[2:03:45] so if you look at the picture there god
[2:03:48] really did not wanted isaac
[2:03:51] the man that god wanted was abraham
[2:03:59] praise the lord
[2:04:00] but what almighty god was going to do
[2:04:03] was
[2:04:04] to see how much this son that abraham
[2:04:08] waited for over 25 years to see it he
[2:04:12] can for one detach himself
[2:04:18] praise the lord
[2:04:21] amen amen
[2:04:23] brother called me one time and and he
[2:04:26] was telling me
[2:04:27] but juan
[2:04:28] please pray for my voice
[2:04:30] and uh
[2:04:32] and and we talked
[2:04:34] and i and pretty much i could see it
[2:04:38] you know i could see it
[2:04:40] being a friend a preacher
[2:04:42] the first thing that comes to our mind
[2:04:44] is that oh you know my my family name
[2:04:50] amen i don't want my children to ruin my
[2:04:52] ministry
[2:04:55] now sometimes the law sees all your
[2:04:58] fears
[2:05:00] praise the lord and he's just ready to
[2:05:04] deliver you from your fears
[2:05:06] praise the lord and it's going to be in
[2:05:09] a way where this young child starts to
[2:05:11] be a child
[2:05:13] he's going through the change of life
[2:05:16] oh
[2:05:18] and i'm so afraid
[2:05:21] how can me being a minister and my
[2:05:23] children behave that way
[2:05:25] so you see it's no longer about god
[2:05:28] it starts to become about you as a
[2:05:30] person
[2:05:35] you want to protect the family name you
[2:05:37] want to protect the church name
[2:05:42] and god says that you are building a
[2:05:44] name for yourself
[2:05:46] when you're supposed to be a bearer
[2:05:49] of his name
[2:05:52] you're supposed to be a bearer of his
[2:05:54] name you're supposed to be a woman that
[2:05:56] represents his name
[2:05:58] amen
[2:06:00] praise the lord
[2:06:01] so now he's going to allow abraham to
[2:06:04] come to that place
[2:06:09] god
[2:06:11] right from the foundation of the word
[2:06:13] the bible says jesus was the lamb of god
[2:06:16] slain from the foundation of the word
[2:06:18] so we know right from the foundation of
[2:06:20] the word
[2:06:24] god had that thought in his mind
[2:06:26] so he's not going to change it
[2:06:29] because of abraham
[2:06:31] to now sacrifice abraham's son
[2:06:35] but god
[2:06:38] was going to prove
[2:06:43] if he had found favor with us
[2:06:46] and we love him
[2:06:48] if we can give him the things that means
[2:06:50] so dear to us
[2:06:56] praise the lord you know how long
[2:06:59] abraham waited for this boy
[2:07:02] praise the lord
[2:07:03] he had ishmael but this was the one that
[2:07:05] god spoke to him about
[2:07:08] and he waited for it
[2:07:10] i told the brother
[2:07:11] i said brother i can see your fear
[2:07:15] i can see your fear
[2:07:17] but let me tell you
[2:07:19] the person that needs the lord the most
[2:07:20] you are the one
[2:07:24] you need the lord the most
[2:07:28] your body is going to be okay
[2:07:31] praise the lord
[2:07:32] if you take your place
[2:07:36] as a servant of god
[2:07:39] and love god you know the enemy will do
[2:07:41] those things to distract you
[2:07:44] i said i i said tell me i mean tell me
[2:07:47] tell me that you are not distracted you
[2:07:48] don't even have inspiration to preach
[2:07:52] everything now that is on your mind is
[2:07:54] my family need my repetition my ministry
[2:07:59] praise the lord
[2:08:02] i just i told him i said just stop just
[2:08:04] start loving the lord
[2:08:08] you will see those boys coming right
[2:08:10] into life
[2:08:15] and we we just had a good time he's a
[2:08:17] good friend of mine we just had we just
[2:08:18] had a blast he says he said brother one
[2:08:21] it looks like that is just what i needed
[2:08:23] to hear as hard as it sounds
[2:08:26] i believe it's nothing but the truth
[2:08:28] because i can tell you i'm scared to
[2:08:29] death
[2:08:31] you know
[2:08:32] i'm scared to death
[2:08:34] look you can protect the things that god
[2:08:37] gave
[2:08:38] us
[2:08:40] praise the lord
[2:08:41] amen
[2:08:42] if god gives a gift
[2:08:44] he protects it
[2:08:51] so there is a divine revelation of the
[2:08:53] love of god
[2:08:56] the means brings jehovah jarrah in the
[2:08:58] middle of the watch that makes every
[2:09:01] movement clicks to
[2:09:05] perfect time
[2:09:07] the main spring
[2:09:10] there is a mainspring that holds this
[2:09:13] word
[2:09:14] there is a mainspring that holds this
[2:09:16] church
[2:09:22] and it better be this word
[2:09:26] it better be this word i i'm not the
[2:09:28] mean spring
[2:09:30] no i'm not the main spring
[2:09:32] praise the lord
[2:09:34] you better cleave to this word
[2:09:42] and when the holy spirit comes in
[2:09:44] there's something that moves
[2:09:47] you can understand what it is
[2:09:49] is is it
[2:09:51] it's a supernatural being inside
[2:09:54] moving controlling your emotions
[2:09:58] making you to strain amen
[2:10:01] when actually you feel like running
[2:10:05] but you will shout
[2:10:07] when you don't know what you are doing
[2:10:11] you will praise god just automatically
[2:10:15] why because there is a mean spring
[2:10:18] that is creating
[2:10:20] some joy it is creating some emotion in
[2:10:24] you that you don't have control over
[2:10:30] praise the lord amen
[2:10:32] you might not know a word your next meal
[2:10:35] comes from uh where you would get money
[2:10:37] to pay your bill but there is something
[2:10:40] inside
[2:10:42] praise the lord
[2:10:43] that make you satisfied
[2:10:50] the divine wash maker
[2:10:52] put it there
[2:10:58] just like our brother talks about the
[2:11:00] touch of the master hank
[2:11:02] that changed the wolf of the violin
[2:11:09] when that old man took the violin and
[2:11:11] tightened the strain and tune it up
[2:11:13] it changed the wolf
[2:11:18] praise the lord
[2:11:19] amen
[2:11:21] and i believe that's what some of us
[2:11:23] need we just we just need to be wind up
[2:11:26] a little bit
[2:11:27] amen we just need to be wind up to be
[2:11:30] brought back to the world that's why
[2:11:31] malachi 4 came
[2:11:33] to bring us back to the faith of the
[2:11:35] fathers
[2:11:37] it was a prophet ministry that would
[2:11:39] wind our life back to bible days
[2:11:42] not just to church membership
[2:11:45] but back to bible days
[2:11:55] when the holy spirit comes and something
[2:11:57] moves in you you don't understand it
[2:12:00] he says it controls your emotion it
[2:12:02] makes you stream when you actually feel
[2:12:04] like running and you were shout when you
[2:12:07] don't know
[2:12:09] what you are doing
[2:12:12] you will praise god just automatically
[2:12:15] amen
[2:12:17] i see some of the young people the song
[2:12:19] is singing their hands is just so heavy
[2:12:21] to clap

[2:16:47] that the leaves will keep time
[2:16:50] they don't wear wrist watch

[2:17:32] they are just keeping time that time
[2:17:33] came they have to do their work
[2:17:36] they are obeying the divine watchmaker
[2:17:44] there is an intelligence
[2:17:46] that guides him to death
[2:17:51] praise the lord
[2:17:56] the same intelligence
[2:18:00] that wakes us up in the morning
[2:18:04] and gave us
[2:18:06] consciousness
[2:18:09] praise the lord amen
[2:18:11] amen amen
[2:18:13] can you imagine
[2:18:16] nebuchadnezzar growing seven years

[2:18:34] that consciousness was gone his nails
[2:18:36] grew out and eating food from the ground
[2:18:38] this is a king
[2:18:44] oh that's the reason why
[2:18:46] when we wake up in the morning
[2:18:50] and we can have consciousness that i'm
[2:18:52] alive
[2:18:54] there is nothing better than raising
[2:18:56] your hands
[2:18:58] say thank you jesus
[2:19:00] thank you lord
[2:19:02] thank you jesus
[2:19:10] who is behind this
[2:19:13] what is the mean spring
[2:19:15] that turned this great economy of god
[2:19:22] praise the lord
[2:19:24] that's the reason why
[2:19:27] we believe that coronavirus is not a
[2:19:29] surprise to god
[2:19:32] amen the prophet of god told us we will
[2:19:34] have jam jam warfare
[2:19:37] praise the lord
[2:19:39] sicknesses will break out that the
[2:19:40] doctors will not find the kill
[2:19:43] it's just beginning
[2:19:46] jesus said it will all be called the
[2:19:48] beginning of sorrow
[2:19:52] praise the lord
[2:19:59] there is a mean spring that turned this
[2:20:01] great incontinent of god
[2:20:03] we find
[2:20:04] it's the holy ghost
[2:20:08] it's not left into the hand of a man
[2:20:11] to do things
[2:20:13] no
[2:20:15] it's in the hands of god
[2:20:17] let the politicians do whatever they
[2:20:19] want
[2:20:20] let the scientists do whatever they want
[2:20:23] like we always say yeah
[2:20:25] prophecy is stronger than politics
[2:20:32] praise the lord amen
[2:20:35] he's the divine
[2:20:37] watchmaker
[2:20:40] and there we read in isaiah
[2:20:43] where god had these men
[2:20:46] that were gifted
[2:20:48] to be able to watch
[2:20:51] the time
[2:20:53] and he would reveal things to them
[2:20:56] concerning the time that the people are
[2:20:57] living in
[2:20:59] the how he dared with the prophets
[2:21:02] all true
[2:21:03] the ages
[2:21:05] they were actually the time peace of god
[2:21:07] when you read in the book of samia the
[2:21:10] bible said after a long time that the
[2:21:12] people never had a prophet
[2:21:14] whenever samya comes to time
[2:21:16] the people always knew he came with the
[2:21:18] word of the lord
[2:21:23] they come together they wanted to hear
[2:21:25] what what is the prophet going to say
[2:21:29] what's going to happen to our crops this
[2:21:31] year
[2:21:34] how our animals what's going to happen
[2:21:36] to the animals are we going to break
[2:21:38] into war
[2:21:41] because they knew that
[2:21:43] the prophets were connected to all the
[2:21:45] divine watchmaker
[2:21:50] praise the lord
[2:21:54] and until the prophet delivered his
[2:21:56] message the people become so nervous
[2:22:01] and when the prophet gave his message
[2:22:03] the people get at ease because they knew
[2:22:06] that god has spoken
[2:22:08] and whatever god said it has to come to
[2:22:11] pass
[2:22:15] praise the lord
[2:22:19] living in an ancient dead in time where
[2:22:22] people are constantly
[2:22:25] becoming disconnected
[2:22:29] from the divine watchmaker
[2:22:32] praise the lord
[2:22:34] people are becoming so disconnected
[2:22:44] and they will do everything
[2:22:47] to argue with truth
[2:22:50] they will do everything because we can
[2:22:52] make our research on google
[2:22:56] praise the lord
[2:22:57] amen
[2:23:04] it's spelled g-o-o
[2:23:09] so it has it's become a god to some
[2:23:11] people
[2:23:13] they try to find truth and comfort
[2:23:18] praise the lord
[2:23:24] this guy called elmo spencer he said
[2:23:27] this about avoiding truth
[2:23:31] he said there is a principle
[2:23:34] which is bound
[2:23:37] against all information
[2:23:40] people
[2:23:41] that just you know
[2:23:43] they just try to block themselves
[2:23:48] which is approved
[2:23:51] against
[2:23:52] all argument
[2:23:58] and which cannot fail to keep a man
[2:24:01] in everlasting
[2:24:03] ignorance
[2:24:06] there is a principle
[2:24:10] and this principle
[2:24:14] it's a principle
[2:24:16] that
[2:24:17] is
[2:24:18] we do it we all do it unconsciously
[2:24:22] that's right
[2:24:23] it's a principle that that
[2:24:26] that makes a man
[2:24:31] to condemn before he investigate
[2:24:36] that's right
[2:24:37] amen
[2:24:41] solomon said in proverbs 18 verse 13 he
[2:24:45] says
[2:24:46] it is foolishness
[2:24:48] to answer a matter before you yield
[2:24:55] amen
[2:24:57] he says it's fully for you to answer a
[2:24:59] martyr
[2:25:01] before you hear it
[2:25:02] and then sometimes
[2:25:06] we do it unconsciously
[2:25:11] praise the lord
[2:25:15] you look at a group of people
[2:25:18] whether it's a church
[2:25:23] or take for example you see you see some
[2:25:26] nice sisters dress you know they dress
[2:25:28] in decent
[2:25:29] the first thing that comes to your mind
[2:25:32] is that
[2:25:34] they are message believers
[2:25:38] praise the lord
[2:25:40] amen
[2:25:41] is it a wrong thing no it's not a wrong
[2:25:43] thing
[2:25:44] because it shows that you have a desire
[2:25:47] in you for people to dress decent
[2:25:50] and you wish that every
[2:25:52] man or woman dress decent
[2:25:56] praise the lord
[2:25:59] and in prayer so maybe you approach them
[2:26:01] and ask them which church do you go to
[2:26:04] and you find that that world goes to
[2:26:05] some
[2:26:06] believing christian church
[2:26:10] and then obviously when when it does not
[2:26:12] fall in the ranks of the message then i
[2:26:14] mean sometimes we we try to cast them
[2:26:17] off
[2:26:18] that's not a good attitude
[2:26:21] amen
[2:26:22] no it's not a good attitude
[2:26:24] praise the lord
[2:26:25] i remember one time in the in the
[2:26:27] shopping place i ran the eye and and i
[2:26:30] saw the lady just exactly what i said to
[2:26:33] you i fed the same i thought she was a
[2:26:34] message believer
[2:26:36] but i didn't ask for which church she
[2:26:37] went to
[2:26:39] i came back
[2:26:41] and i greeted her and i told her i just
[2:26:43] want to tell you something
[2:26:45] i appreciate seeing
[2:26:47] decent ladies
[2:26:49] that's all i had to say to her
[2:26:52] praise the lord and god bless you
[2:26:56] what it did to her
[2:26:58] only god in heaven knows
[2:27:00] amen
[2:27:01] praise the lord
[2:27:03] amen
[2:27:04] but you see
[2:27:06] that is the way that people
[2:27:08] evolved through the pharisees did it all
[2:27:11] the time
[2:27:13] amen nicodemus came to jesus and he says
[2:27:16] we know
[2:27:18] he was a chief priest
[2:27:20] he was a chief among the sahendra
[2:27:22] counsel he said we know
[2:27:25] that no man can do this
[2:27:28] except they come from god
[2:27:32] praise the lord so they were seeing
[2:27:34] truth
[2:27:36] they were seeing truth
[2:27:39] but you see because
[2:27:41] they have condemned it instead of
[2:27:43] jesus's session scripture
[2:27:46] search the scripture investigate this
[2:27:48] thing
[2:27:49] search the scripture
[2:27:51] in them you will have life
[2:27:54] praise the lord
[2:27:55] when a wise man came running down there
[2:27:58] to jersey where is he born of the king
[2:28:00] of the jews herald sent from men from
[2:28:03] the sahendra council they were the one
[2:28:06] that came to his house they flipped the
[2:28:08] straw and find in the prophecy of my
[2:28:11] kind
[2:28:12] what is that one will be born in
[2:28:14] bethlehem
[2:28:18] praise the lord
[2:28:19] but because john the baptist never came
[2:28:22] through the assistant he came as a man
[2:28:24] from the wilderness
[2:28:27] they condemn him
[2:28:29] before investigating
[2:28:31] you see when you put yourself to that
[2:28:33] place it does not give you room
[2:28:36] for you to search the scripture it does
[2:28:38] not give you room for you to look in the
[2:28:40] message
[2:28:47] praise the lord
[2:28:51] it does not give you wrong
[2:28:53] for you to even be able to help somebody
[2:28:58] praise the lord
[2:28:59] if you just see a young woman and you
[2:29:01] just condemn her she's a prostitute it
[2:29:03] does not give you wrong for you to share
[2:29:05] the christ that you have with her
[2:29:08] it does not get you wrong
[2:29:14] jesus knew the woman underwear was a
[2:29:17] woman that was not living right
[2:29:19] he knew that and that was the reason why
[2:29:21] he went by that way
[2:29:26] all he had to do
[2:29:29] was to investigate a little bit
[2:29:32] he tried to investigate
[2:29:34] praise the lord
[2:29:36] amen
[2:29:38] what if you want this water go call your
[2:29:40] husband
[2:29:42] he was investigating
[2:29:44] praise the lord
[2:29:46] and then she said i have no husband
[2:29:49] that's that's right
[2:29:50] you just said the truth
[2:29:54] because you have five
[2:29:58] and even the one you're living with is
[2:29:59] naive in your husband
[2:30:02] why because he made room
[2:30:06] to investigate her
[2:30:08] praise the lord
[2:30:10] while the disciples were watching behind
[2:30:12] the corner condemning her
[2:30:15] why is he talking to that woman
[2:30:20] yes sir
[2:30:21] that's how people evolve truth
[2:30:25] praise the lord
[2:30:27] you see since that's the reason why you
[2:30:29] cannot replace anything with the holy
[2:30:31] ghost
[2:30:33] amen you cannot replace a church
[2:30:35] membership you cannot replace some
[2:30:37] sensation with the holy ghost
[2:30:39] if you have the holy ghost
[2:30:43] then you have no reason to be afraid
[2:30:47] because jesus promised it will lead you
[2:30:50] to all truth
[2:30:52] that's what he said
[2:30:54] it will lead you to all truth
[2:30:57] so don't condem just follow
[2:31:00] investigate
[2:31:02] investigate
[2:31:06] and pretty soon
[2:31:08] things
[2:31:09] will start opening oh wow
[2:31:14] wow then pretty soon you start
[2:31:15] appreciating
[2:31:21] because there is a time
[2:31:23] in the season
[2:31:27] for all things
[2:31:29] praise the lord
[2:31:31] for all things
[2:31:32] when the internal god
[2:31:34] broke out of eternity
[2:31:37] into time
[2:31:40] there is an unwritten law
[2:31:42] that was established
[2:31:46] that everything that was created will be
[2:31:49] governed
[2:31:50] by time
[2:31:52] have you ever heard the slogan that says
[2:31:54] time will tell
[2:31:58] amen
[2:31:59] because time came out of eternity
[2:32:02] so god place
[2:32:04] truth in time time don't tell lies
[2:32:10] time don't tell lies
[2:32:12] amen
[2:32:14] you can change your age make yourself
[2:32:16] young
[2:32:22] at time will come your body will start
[2:32:24] telling you
[2:32:28] you start arguing with yourself
[2:32:32] because time does not lie it came out of
[2:32:34] eternity and eternity is the source of
[2:32:37] truth
[2:32:40] a man can claim whatever he wants to
[2:32:42] claim give him time
[2:32:44] brother branham said give him a long
[2:32:45] road he will hang himself
[2:32:50] praise the lord
[2:32:52] there is an unwritten law
[2:32:55] when the internal god broke out of
[2:32:57] internet
[2:32:58] and condemns himself in the border
[2:33:01] called the logos
[2:33:02] there was an unwritten lord
[2:33:07] to everything
[2:33:10] that is created
[2:33:12] under the heavens
[2:33:14] there is time
[2:33:20] praise the lord
[2:33:27] there is time to wait
[2:33:30] if we can just
[2:33:35] trust and all of that the divine
[2:33:38] watchmaker
[2:33:40] that put time to everything
[2:33:43] he has everything under control
[2:33:47] praise the lord
[2:33:49] he has everything
[2:33:51] under control
[2:33:54] and if we will trust him
[2:33:58] and don't guide our life
[2:34:02] by this past present
[2:34:05] and what we hope the future will bring
[2:34:08] sequence that we live in
[2:34:12] like i said it stop them it will keep
[2:34:14] hunting you
[2:34:17] it will keep haunting you every time you
[2:34:19] have to make a choice
[2:34:20] it will come back wash up
[2:34:22] praise the lord am i saying that you
[2:34:25] should not
[2:34:26] learn from your past no that's not what
[2:34:28] i'm saying
[2:34:30] that's not what i'm saying
[2:34:33] should not observe or hope good for the
[2:34:35] future that's not what i'm saying
[2:34:40] if that's what you are hearing i'm
[2:34:42] telling you now that's not what i'm
[2:34:43] saying
[2:34:47] but i'm saying there is a god
[2:34:50] that knows the end from the beginning
[2:34:54] amen
[2:34:56] and he has
[2:34:57] written
[2:34:58] a narrating lord
[2:35:00] and giving time
[2:35:02] to everything
[2:35:04] under the heavens
[2:35:06] everything

[2:35:11] morning

[2:35:19] a word is watch
[2:35:21] a listening to the divine
[2:35:24] time maker

[2:35:31] now you see nature
[2:35:34] has not had a lot of problems like we
[2:35:37] have
[2:35:38] it's because they have been so connected
[2:35:40] to the divine time maker
[2:35:44] amen
[2:35:45] they have been so connected
[2:35:47] to the divine time maker
[2:35:56] they just wrote arms
[2:36:00] praise the lord amen
[2:36:04] so as we continue
[2:36:06] to
[2:36:10] mourn
[2:36:11] and think about brothers cat

[2:36:18] that we all have a time
[2:36:22] our life will come to an end

[2:36:28] in one of these days

[2:36:32] said about me
[2:36:34] and there will be tributes that will be
[2:36:36] said about you

[2:36:59] you can turn your back to it
[2:37:01] when you turn it turns
[2:37:04] every step that we take
[2:37:06] we're getting closer to that doorway
[2:37:11] praise the lord
[2:37:14] but the one that clocks us in
[2:37:17] is the only one
[2:37:19] that can clock us out
[2:37:23] praise the lord
[2:37:26] in the message expression brother

[2:37:50] uh
[2:37:51] or something
[2:37:52] that may be

[2:37:59] that isn't the case
[2:38:02] to a christian

[2:38:06] solomon said why be foolish and die
[2:38:08] before your time
[2:38:12] a man can make
[2:38:14] evil choices and do different things
[2:38:17] but one that is born in christ
[2:38:20] his life has been torn

[2:40:03] one brother wesley shared that with me
[2:40:07] right after the funeral right when we

[2:40:12] because he uh
[2:40:14] it took it took the graveside to kind of
[2:40:19] confirmed the whole thing to him
[2:40:21] because just like how the graves were
[2:40:23] lining up
[2:40:26] so now we came back from the gravesite
[2:40:28] and he
[2:40:29] pulled me in the siding and told me
[2:40:32] we prayed
[2:40:34] [Music]
[2:40:35] then i called him later and said write
[2:40:37] it down
[2:40:39] i believe that is god way of comforting
[2:40:42] us
[2:40:43] [Music]
[2:40:46] that he's in the best of his body
[2:40:49] he came out of the grave
[2:40:52] as a man that have won
[2:40:54] his battle
[2:40:57] [Music]
[2:40:59] it is our time to fight amen

[2:41:07] don't allow anything to discourage you
[2:41:10] things might be happening you you don't
[2:41:12] have you can put your brain around it
[2:41:14] you can put your mind around it
[2:41:16] but just give it
[2:41:18] to the divine watchmaker

[2:41:22] and see how the lord
[2:41:24] will order your steps and see how he
[2:41:26] will be with you
[2:41:28] praise the lord
[2:41:30] i pray that the lord will
[2:41:34] just comfort each and every one of us
[2:41:36] [Music]
[2:41:39] the scripture says we must learn to
[2:41:41] normal our days
[2:41:44] praise the lord
[2:41:46] but i learned to look at that scripture
[2:41:49] as we must learn to know the one that
[2:41:51] have normal our days
[2:41:55] praise the lord
[2:41:57] [Music]
[2:42:00] let's buy our hands now
[2:42:01] [Music]
[2:42:07] i know
[2:42:08] the master
[2:42:10] of
[2:42:25] and he can count
[2:42:27] the star
[2:42:29] and make the sun to shine again
[2:42:35] i know

[2:42:46] [Music]
[2:43:15] hallelujah jesus
[2:43:20] i
[2:43:20] know the master of the wings
[2:43:28] i know the maker of the race
[2:43:40] make the song to shine again
[2:43:46] i know
[2:43:51] now also realizing
[2:43:56] that the enemy knows that
[2:43:59] our human mind is caught up in this
[2:44:02] place of our past and our presence
[2:44:06] and what we hope the future will be he
[2:44:08] knows how to use our past
[2:44:11] and use our failures
[2:44:13] and and
[2:44:15] and han us and make us so terrified
[2:44:19] that we don't even want to try
[2:44:21] we don't want to even make effort
[2:44:31] but you see scenes
[2:44:35] like brother branham said he said it's
[2:44:37] it's not mean that it's keeping this
[2:44:39] all-time religion
[2:44:41] he said it's my religion that is keeping
[2:44:43] me
[2:44:45] we have to realize that the god that
[2:44:47] have caught us
[2:44:50] he's more than able
[2:44:56] there is no need of crossing breaches
[2:44:58] before we get there
[2:45:01] there is no need of problem into the
[2:45:03] future and just being afraid
[2:45:07] we have to trust him
[2:45:11] we have to trust him simply rest
[2:45:14] our faith in the law
[2:45:24] with this time that we have
[2:45:28] especially the time that we are living
[2:45:30] in
[2:45:31] we have to go to work
[2:45:33] we have to go to businesses
[2:45:35] we have loved ones friends relations
[2:45:38] and people are sick all over the place
[2:45:41] [Music]
[2:45:43] we just have to trust god
[2:45:51] do all we know that is right to do
[2:45:54] and we just trust the lord
[2:45:59] knowing that until our work on earth is
[2:46:01] gone
[2:46:02] [Music]
[2:46:08] sickness cannot clock us out
[2:46:11] sickness never clock us in
[2:46:19] he's the one that cluck us in
[2:46:23] and he's the only one
[2:46:24] that can clock us out
[2:46:34] brother brandon said if my time comes
[2:46:38] i don't want to leave one meaning after
[2:46:40] that
[2:46:43] we know in the scripture how hezekiah
[2:46:47] wanted to do over time
[2:46:50] we know the things that did happen
[2:46:55] let's live for christ let's give him our
[2:46:57] best
[2:47:00] let's live for christ
[2:47:04] let's trust him let's believe him
[2:47:08] if he have other hours to till this far
[2:47:15] and since we are more closer to home
[2:47:18] than where he brought us from
[2:47:24] it would take us
[2:47:26] a long way to go back
[2:47:29] and start learning how to lie and start
[2:47:31] learning
[2:47:34] how to lust and start learning how to
[2:47:36] smoke and start learning it would take
[2:47:38] us a whole lot because every time you
[2:47:41] try to learn it you're just only going
[2:47:42] to end up with regrets
[2:47:45] and your heart is going to be broken
[2:47:47] because what the work that god has done
[2:47:49] in your heart
[2:47:51] there is no power of hell
[2:47:57] we have to trust
[2:47:59] god we have to believe in the holy ghost
[2:48:02] we have to believe in a keeping power
[2:48:04] that god has given us
[2:48:06] [Music]
[2:48:09] all the way things are going we you we
[2:48:12] have to be careful oh yeah
[2:48:14] let's be prayerful
[2:48:19] let's be prayerful let's trust the lord
[2:48:22] let's believe in the holy ghost he
[2:48:24] promised that it will guide us it will
[2:48:26] lead us it will teach us
[2:48:30] the holy ghost is gone mean
[2:48:34] spring of life
[2:48:47] heavenly father
[2:48:50] we are our
[2:48:51] healing lord and
[2:48:54] and and
[2:48:56] the lord god we we want to just lift for
[2:48:59] our heads we want to look to you
