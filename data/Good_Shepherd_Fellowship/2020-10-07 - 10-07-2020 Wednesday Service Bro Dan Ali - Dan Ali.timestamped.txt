[35:47] i have just been living in in the sunday
[35:50] atmosphere
[35:51] all along
[35:54] it was just so wonderful it was beyond
[35:57] explanation
[35:58] [Music]
[36:00] yeah there were moments i just had to
[36:02] comfort myself
[36:05] from running in to just come and stand
[36:07] there and shout amen
[36:10] but i didn't want it to be a distraction
[36:13] praise be to god
[36:15] oh my the lord our god is good
[36:19] whatever we need to be successful in
[36:22] this journey
[36:23] he has provided we don't make it
[36:27] we have no excuse we are destined to
[36:31] make it
[36:33] we are bound to make it
[36:38] all hell can never stop the program of
[36:41] god
[36:43] praise be to god we started this
[36:48] the greatest battle ever fought last
[36:50] week
[36:52] and um just covered a part of it
[36:56] and by the grace of god we are going to
[36:58] continue
[37:01] i wouldn't say we are going to continue
[37:03] from where we stopped
[37:04] because honestly speaking i don't even
[37:06] remember where we stopped
[37:09] praise be to god it was one of a kind
[37:13] i wouldn't want to go into it so much
[37:18] let god have his way
[37:21] now from the scripture we just read
[37:37] the bible says be sober and be vigilant
[37:40] as somebody will say open your eyes
[37:45] because our adversary the devil
[37:48] we have only one adversary
[37:52] your neighbor is not your adversary your
[37:56] brother is not your adversary
[37:58] your sister is not your adversary i
[38:01] don't care how hard they step on your
[38:03] toes
[38:03] they are not your adversary
[38:06] the devil as we said is always using
[38:11] a human being he is always looking for a
[38:14] vessel to use
[38:16] and he is only using that vessel
[38:19] if we can only look beyond the vessel
[38:23] the devil is using
[38:25] to see who is behind it will solve a lot
[38:27] of our headaches
[38:30] but a lot of the times we leave the
[38:33] person who is on behind the scenes
[38:36] pulling the strings and we are dealing
[38:39] with a person and we don't achieve any
[38:43] result
[38:45] when a firefighter comes into the house
[38:47] that is burning
[38:49] they don't go after the flames they are
[38:51] looking for the source of the fire
[38:54] because they know when they get the
[38:56] source of the fire they can contain the
[38:58] flame
[38:59] but so long as they are fighting the
[39:00] flame they know they are fighting a lost
[39:02] battle
[39:05] if we can only look beyond the vessels
[39:08] that the devil is using
[39:10] and go after the devil it will stop a
[39:12] lot of the headaches praise be to god
[39:15] be vigilant be sober
[39:19] because your adversary the devil
[39:24] as a ruling lion whatever about as a
[39:28] roaring lion
[39:30] as a roaring lion you can underline that
[39:34] praise be to god how many of us here
[39:36] have seen
[39:37] the sea roar how many of us here
[39:41] i know we are living in minnesota we
[39:43] just have lakes and rivers here praise
[39:45] be to god
[39:46] now when you see the west of the sea
[39:49] belowing or coming sometimes it's about
[39:52] three four stories high
[39:54] and if you see a ship on the sea you
[39:57] will think the wave is just coming to
[39:59] cover it up
[40:00] and destroy it but what does it do it
[40:03] only
[40:04] comes and disappears beneath
[40:07] it and then lifts it high oh let's use
[40:10] a cipher
[40:14] how many know who a surfer is
[40:17] they are on something like a plank i
[40:20] would never do that
[40:22] and then they are on the sea and you
[40:24] will see them
[40:25] they will just go so high and come so
[40:28] so so low and they are there just
[40:30] enjoying the waves
[40:32] and you will see a wave that is coming
[40:34] about three four stories high
[40:37] and you are just looking at them and you
[40:38] think that oh
[40:40] this wave is just coming to cover them
[40:42] up and that will be the end
[40:45] but the wave just comes and then
[40:48] disappears beneath them
[40:50] and it leaves them so so so high in the
[40:53] air
[40:53] and they come so you know what that is
[40:56] what the devil does
[40:58] the devil oppressed by fear
[41:01] god does not operate by fear god are
[41:04] praised by faith
[41:06] we have not received the holy spirit
[41:08] again to fear
[41:12] praise be to god when the devil is
[41:14] coming
[41:16] he comes as a ruined life like the west
[41:17] of the sea
[41:19] and when you tremble and fear takes over
[41:25] the devil has no work to do anymore
[41:28] because whatever it is that the devil is
[41:31] coming to do
[41:31] you would have done part of it already
[41:34] so he comes and then he accomplished
[41:35] just go through the rest but you started
[41:39] it
[41:40] but if you can stay your grounds as the
[41:43] devil comes
[41:45] and if you can stay your grounds i can
[41:48] assure you by the word of god
[41:50] that the devil is going to be nothing
[41:52] but a full stool
[41:55] the way he comes that is the same way
[41:57] he's going to disappear under your feet
[42:00] the bible says he's as good as our just
[42:02] he's he's just a rag that we work on
[42:08] we know
[42:11] if i can just take a little bit of this
[42:17] praise be to god
[42:22] whom resisted first in faith knowing
[42:24] that the same afflictions
[42:26] are accomplished in your brain that are
[42:28] in the world look
[42:29] don't let it look like it is you
[42:31] whatever it is that you're going through
[42:33] don't let it look like you're the only
[42:35] person going through that
[42:38] before you thousands of people had
[42:42] already gone through that
[42:46] and as you are going through it now
[42:49] thousands of
[42:50] people are also going through it
[42:53] and if christ carries after we are dead
[42:55] and gone
[42:56] thousands of people will still go
[42:58] through it
[43:00] we are fighting a common enemy whatever
[43:04] it is that you are going through
[43:06] others are going through it and if
[43:09] others
[43:10] can be faithful and brave the storm
[43:16] if they can be faithful and brave the
[43:18] song what it means is that
[43:20] you can also do it
[43:24] you can also do it praise be to god
[43:28] now we are talking about the greatest
[43:31] battle ever fought
[43:38] let's turn our bibles to daniel 12.
[43:46] it was one of those scriptures that
[43:47] prophet used
[43:49] daniel 12 he read from
[43:53] but i'll just take i think the first
[43:56] verse at that time
[44:01] daniel 12 at that time
[44:04] shall michael stand up the great prince
[44:09] which standeth for the children of thy
[44:11] people
[44:12] and there shall be a time of trouble
[44:15] such as never was since
[44:17] there was a nation even to the same time
[44:20] and at the time thy people shall be
[44:23] delivered
[44:23] everyone that shall be found
[44:27] in the book praise be to god praise be
[44:30] to god
[44:31] our names are written in the book our
[44:35] names
[44:35] are in the last book of life nothing can
[44:38] take it out
[44:39] it's written in the ink in the blood
[44:44] that was shed for our for for us nothing
[44:47] can erase it
[44:49] when you look in the bible and you don't
[44:51] see your name look again
[44:53] your name is hiding somewhere there
[44:56] praise be to god
[44:57] that is why when you hear the word of
[44:59] god you can't just help it
[45:00] but enjoy it because you are part of
[45:03] what god
[45:04] is doing in this day and age that when
[45:07] you hear the word of god you can't help
[45:08] it
[45:09] but shout amen to the glory of god
[45:11] praise be to god
[45:12] the bible says at that time at what time
[45:17] at what time
[45:21] michael is going to stand up for thy
[45:23] people
[45:24] the bible is talking of this time
[45:30] and remember this greatest battle ever
[45:33] fought started in heaven
[45:35] against god and satan
[45:40] and he was defeated then
[45:44] and what it means is that if
[45:47] michael is going to stand for us
[45:51] that means he is already defeated again
[45:55] i didn't say he is going to be defeated
[45:59] i am not talking of something in the
[46:01] future i am talking of present tense
[46:03] he is already defeated
[46:07] amen praise be to god
[46:13] as the prophet of god said it is not the
[46:16] size
[46:19] of the dog in the fight by the size of
[46:22] the fight in the dark
[46:24] and i don't think anybody understands
[46:26] this better than i do and i want to tell
[46:28] you why
[46:30] growing up i was a very very bad boy
[46:33] i was born and bred in the barracks in
[46:35] the army barracks my dad was a soldier
[46:38] and uh they the children in the bus
[46:40] don't fear anything
[46:42] so and my dad again was a boxer in the
[46:45] army
[46:46] so he put a sack he
[46:49] just filled it with sand and then he was
[46:52] teaching me how to box
[46:53] and i was very good i didn't fear
[46:55] anything
[46:56] when i schooled we had we had four
[47:00] schools
[47:01] all put together and if you saw people
[47:04] in a ring
[47:06] shouting five out of ten you come and
[47:09] meet me inside there
[47:11] and i'll be the one boxing and i was
[47:14] good
[47:15] i didn't fear anything
[47:19] but my dad went on pension and we left
[47:22] a cry and went to a place called tamale
[47:26] one morning i don't remember where i was
[47:29] going
[47:31] i was just going this tiny guy was
[47:33] looking at me
[47:35] and i was looking at him
[47:39] and then i stopped then he stopped
[47:42] then he started speaking his dialect i
[47:44] didn't know what he was talking about
[47:47] then i also started speaking three one
[47:49] of the popular languages in ghana
[47:52] and then he said something i also said
[47:55] something
[47:56] and then we drew closer i said i'll beat
[47:58] this boy today
[48:01] so i gave him a blow he dodged another
[48:03] one then he dodged
[48:05] and then all i saw was that my legs went
[48:08] into the air
[48:14] my goodness
[48:17] he whipped me to the ground so when i
[48:20] woke up
[48:22] about nine o'clock in the morning i saw
[48:24] stars
[48:27] so when i woke up i looked at this boy
[48:29] and then i started dressing back
[48:31] and then he stood there you'll he
[48:34] shouting
[48:34] he was ready for more but i wasn't ready
[48:37] for anything
[48:41] then i started so it was a very very
[48:43] small bush path
[48:46] so i just looked on the left looked on
[48:48] the right
[48:49] there was nobody coming i just cleaned
[48:52] myself
[48:54] as a brother team used to say he says
[48:57] small shame is better than big shame
[49:02] i said this when i have taken this
[49:03] enough
[49:05] then i started going and he pumped up
[49:08] i said no i'm not standing for anything
[49:11] so that was where my boxing career ended
[49:18] so it is not the size of the dog in the
[49:21] fight
[49:22] it's the size of the fight in the dog
[49:24] and for you to know
[49:27] that the battle is not your battle but
[49:29] god's battle
[49:31] praise be to god that should settle it
[49:35] that should settle in the matter
[49:38] that the battle is not yours
[49:41] if it is yours you have every cost worry
[49:45] but it is god's own battle god is the
[49:48] one fighting the battle
[49:49] praise be to god so what is your worries
[49:57] i love that song i have forgotten what
[49:59] song it is
[50:01] but the song says that
[50:05] is it one step no i'm not very sure but
[50:09] just to paraphrase things the musician
[50:12] was saying
[50:14] that every step i think one step one
[50:16] step along i don't remember
[50:20] now when he she takes a step
[50:24] wait a minute it goes like this
[50:31] that she got into the storm
[50:37] and then she thought she was by herself
[50:44] and she started complaining and asking
[50:47] god
[50:51] why is it that i got in the thickest
[50:53] storm
[50:55] at a point i was expecting you the most
[50:58] and you abandoned me
[51:03] and god said no i didn't abandon you
[51:07] those steps you saw in the sand
[51:11] and thought they were your steps
[51:14] that was the time i was carrying you
[51:16] those steps you saw they were my steps
[51:22] i don't know how many remember that song
[51:25] praise be to god so the battle is not
[51:29] our battle
[51:31] it's god's own battle to fight
[51:35] and as a matter of fact none of
[51:38] us there is no body
[51:41] that is a match for satan
[51:48] but he that is least in the kingdom of
[51:52] god
[51:53] the devil is no match to that person
[51:59] the devil has been in this game for very
[52:02] long
[52:04] how can you outsmart him
[52:10] if tried after she knew what god wanted
[52:14] them to do
[52:15] but here comes the devil he will not
[52:18] come
[52:19] and tell you that everything you are
[52:20] hearing is false
[52:23] but he just add a little or takes a
[52:26] little out
[52:32] you know human beings sometimes we put
[52:35] ourselves
[52:36] somewhere and then we begin to compare
[52:39] ourselves with others
[52:41] and then we have a either a book or a
[52:43] register and then we say okay
[52:45] uh this is where i go wrong it's only
[52:48] one
[52:49] but i know of this brother or this
[52:50] sister who has
[52:52] 20 things wrong and i know of somebody
[52:55] else who has 50 wrong
[52:57] mine is just only one so i am good
[53:01] you are not good you are as guilty as
[53:04] somebody
[53:04] that is doing everything wrong because
[53:07] the bible says that he that offense in
[53:10] one
[53:10] is guilty in all if the devil can get
[53:14] you to believe
[53:15] that by doing only one thing wrong you
[53:17] are better than somebody who is doing
[53:19] 100 things wrong
[53:20] you have gotten it wrong
[53:23] praise be to god
[53:33] thank you brother god bless you i didn't
[53:35] know i was sweating
[53:41] oh my yeah
[53:46] that is what happens if you don't grow
[53:47] here
[53:52] yes so
[53:58] the devil has been in this game for a
[54:00] very long time
[54:01] longer than any of us
[54:09] that is why you don't have to risen
[54:13] the word of god because he would
[54:16] outristen you
[54:19] you can't all your
[54:22] years of education
[54:26] can never come anywhere close for you to
[54:28] reason with the devil
[54:29] and succeed now i have my phd
[54:34] as a matter of fact those who have a lot
[54:38] of those
[54:38] degrees there are those that are even
[54:40] further away from god
[54:45] you can't outraise in him
[54:48] the bible says he is cunning
[54:52] he is subtle
[54:55] you don't stop to raising with the enemy
[54:58] just look around here in america
[55:01] we used to read about it in in the by
[55:03] amina in the bible about sodom and
[55:04] gomorrah
[55:05] and here we are living in that condition
[55:08] that they are not even ashamed that they
[55:11] can come out
[55:13] and they have more rights and privileges
[55:15] than you and i have
[55:18] and you find very nice people nice
[55:22] people
[55:22] they will tell you that oh i was
[55:24] supposed to be a man
[55:25] and i was born a woman
[55:28] i was supposed to be a woman and i was
[55:30] born a man
[55:33] the devil has given them enough reason
[55:35] to believe what they are doing
[55:36] and they are doing it without any form
[55:38] of shame
[55:42] transgenderism
[55:46] don't reason with the enemy
[55:50] one day my wife and i went to
[55:53] somewhere to shop they heard that they
[55:56] had a sale
[55:57] we entered i saw a lady and i said hi
[56:01] and then somebody responded i had to
[56:03] turn back
[56:04] i was thinking for the voice the voice
[56:08] of a man
[56:09] in a woman how do you explain that
[56:20] don't ever reason with a word
[56:26] we are not called
[56:32] to reason we are called to belief
[56:39] it may not make sense to you it doesn't
[56:41] have to make sense to you
[56:46] if you are only believing because it
[56:48] makes sense
[56:49] then why lies your faith
[56:54] faith is when you can believe even when
[56:56] it doesn't make sense
[57:00] that you are ready to die for it because
[57:03] you believe that is the truth
[57:08] and why should man even fear death
[57:12] why should man even fear death
[57:17] the devil's west would only bring the
[57:19] best out of you
[57:22] his worst would bring the best out of
[57:26] you
[57:32] me three times
[57:38] god took me out of death
[57:43] the devil can never scare me with death
[57:50] anytime god is ready for me i am ready
[57:52] to go home
[57:55] the devil can never scare me with death
[57:58] and a child of god the devil can never
[58:00] scare you with death
[58:05] the bible has made it clear
[58:08] it's appointed unto man wants to die
[58:11] that would come when it's ready
[58:14] and we are here to serve the purpose of
[58:15] god when that purpose is over
[58:17] it can be a single a little headache
[58:20] you can just go to bed and that is the
[58:22] end of the story
[58:24] you have done your work
[58:28] you have done your work but until
[58:31] then let all of hell come against you
[58:36] and praise be to god you are going to be
[58:38] vindicated by the grace of god
[58:43] praise be to god
[58:47] don't let fear ruin your experience with
[58:51] god
[58:56] the devil oppressed with fear
[58:59] so much
[59:04] as long as god leaves you keep going
[59:10] fear is not our portion
[59:13] praise be to god
[59:18] we also saw the devil
[59:21] in the in in in the man of gagara
[59:25] who was possessed by legends of demons
[59:29] he was so strong he will beat everything
[59:31] and kill everything
[59:32] till he was living in the tombs they
[59:35] couldn't tame him
[59:40] you think about the demon in goliath
[59:42] goliath
[59:47] the demon in goliath
[59:50] that would come and call the bluff
[59:55] upon the children of god call them names
[1:00:00] and the king and his generals didn't
[1:00:02] know what to do
[1:00:06] this was a human mountain
[1:00:11] a vicious person that had fought was all
[1:00:14] his life
[1:00:16] he was killed he knew that out of war
[1:00:20] he was amped to the teeth
[1:00:24] and his head was probably would probably
[1:00:26] go through this roof
[1:00:29] he was a giant
[1:00:35] that is how the devil always comes
[1:00:38] but don't forget that it is not the
[1:00:42] fight
[1:00:43] it is not the size of the dog it is the
[1:00:46] size of the fight in the dark
[1:00:49] don't look at the storm the size of the
[1:00:51] storm
[1:00:53] tell god at his word
[1:00:56] when god says much forward much forward
[1:01:00] when he says keep still keep still
[1:01:04] don't look at the size of the storm when
[1:01:08] david came on the scene and he saw how
[1:01:10] this man was
[1:01:11] defying the people of god he said no i
[1:01:14] am going to fight this man
[1:01:16] and just think about it we are talking
[1:01:18] about the greatest battle ever fought
[1:01:20] that even in the camp of israel
[1:01:24] the king himself from the things he told
[1:01:27] he told david he was fighting against
[1:01:29] david
[1:01:31] oh you are just a youth
[1:01:35] in other words you are just a little boy
[1:01:38] this guy you see here has been fighting
[1:01:40] wars
[1:01:40] all his life you can't fight him
[1:01:44] can you imagine that
[1:01:50] praise be to god but he said no i am
[1:01:54] going to fight him
[1:01:55] anyhow and just listen to what david
[1:01:59] said
[1:02:01] when he was meeting goliath he said you
[1:02:04] are coming against me with your spears
[1:02:06] with your arrows with your shield with
[1:02:08] your whatever
[1:02:09] but i come against you in the name of
[1:02:11] the lord
[1:02:12] the god of the armies of the israel i
[1:02:14] mean israel
[1:02:16] whom you have defied praise be to god
[1:02:20] give god his glory let god
[1:02:24] know that you are depending on him the
[1:02:27] body is god's battle
[1:02:28] call him into action it is not yours
[1:02:32] why do you have to worry praise be to
[1:02:35] god
[1:02:37] call god on the scene he is always ready
[1:02:42] always looking for a man to use always
[1:02:45] to give for a woman to use
[1:02:47] and he is just waiting for you to step
[1:02:49] in and he will come there
[1:02:54] he is always ready are you always ready
[1:02:59] the god our lord is always ready
[1:03:06] it is not time for excuses anymore
[1:03:10] one of these days it will be over
[1:03:13] we've been talking about this for years
[1:03:16] ages
[1:03:17] we got up and we had them preaching
[1:03:19] about it we are talking about it
[1:03:21] christ studies will be dead and gone but
[1:03:23] look
[1:03:24] one of these days before you realize
[1:03:27] it will all be over
[1:03:32] check your walk with god
[1:03:35] examine yourself every single day
[1:03:40] there is nothing good out there is
[1:03:44] just to lure you and get you out of the
[1:03:46] program of god
[1:03:49] praise be to god check your work with
[1:03:52] god
[1:03:52] every single day a child of god you
[1:03:55] should not be satisfied with
[1:03:57] anything less than the world
[1:04:03] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:04:10] praise be to god
[1:04:13] we have a god who reigns
[1:04:17] our god is a fighter and the children of
[1:04:21] god are fighters
[1:04:23] we are called to fight for every day you
[1:04:27] are living
[1:04:27] you are fighting a battle one kind of
[1:04:30] the other
[1:04:32] that is why the devil always wants to
[1:04:34] tear our ranks apart
[1:04:36] if the devil can get us to disagree
[1:04:41] oh then we make the work too difficult
[1:04:45] god cannot even work with a group like
[1:04:47] that
[1:04:48] but when our strengths are united
[1:04:50] together our faith are united together
[1:04:53] and we come to the place
[1:04:55] and we take god at his word nothing will
[1:04:58] stop god from coming on the scene
[1:05:02] god does not deal with cows
[1:05:06] satan is a coward he is a coward
[1:05:10] the prophet of god said there are two
[1:05:12] words there are two powers
[1:05:13] the power of god and the power of satan
[1:05:16] and when you look at the power of satan
[1:05:18] it's a sign of weakness because
[1:05:22] a true sign of strength real strength
[1:05:25] picks people up
[1:05:29] but any power that draws people down
[1:05:33] is a sign of weakness and that is what
[1:05:37] the devil does
[1:05:40] to destroy everything that is of god
[1:05:45] to wreck your your work with god
[1:05:49] to destroy your testimony
[1:05:52] to smear you
[1:05:57] the devil is a coward if you have never
[1:06:00] seen a coward
[1:06:02] i'm telling you today that the devil
[1:06:05] satan
[1:06:06] our adversary that wicked one that old
[1:06:08] crook
[1:06:09] he is oh my goodness satan is wicked
[1:06:17] i mean a son or a daughter of god
[1:06:22] think of it how sweet
[1:06:25] how sweet it is
[1:06:28] to save god how sweet it is when you
[1:06:33] know god has come
[1:06:34] in praise be to god
[1:06:37] how sweet it is nothing satisfies
[1:06:41] thank you jesus
[1:06:45] why would any man or any woman in their
[1:06:48] right senses
[1:06:50] want to leave the kingdom of god for the
[1:06:53] filth
[1:06:54] that the devil is providing out there
[1:06:59] that demon power is a filthy spirit very
[1:07:02] filthy very deary
[1:07:07] when those legends of demons left their
[1:07:08] mind in gadara where did they go
[1:07:10] they entered the pits it can enter peaks
[1:07:13] it can enter snakes it can enter
[1:07:16] anything
[1:07:18] it's a filthy deadly spirit don't let
[1:07:21] thy evil spirit take a hold of your life
[1:07:24] you are bought and paid for by the
[1:07:27] precious blood
[1:07:29] of the lord jesus christ
[1:07:32] you belong to god
[1:07:35] thank you brother god bless you
[1:07:38] yes it looks like i'm losing a lot of
[1:07:42] water i can understand
[1:07:56] praise be to god
[1:08:17] pardon me tonight normally i'll put my
[1:08:20] phone off
[1:08:21] and leave it in the truck but i have it
[1:08:23] here with me
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:26] because uh i needed to print
[1:08:29] a lot of stuff and for what reason um
[1:08:33] things didn't work out very well but i
[1:08:36] still have it here so
[1:08:38] i have a few here we'll be reading very
[1:08:41] shortly
[1:08:42] but if we contend if we can turn our
[1:08:46] bibles to
[1:08:50] ephesians 6
[1:08:56] ephesians 6 10 to 17. we'll just take
[1:09:01] um we just take maybe the 10 verse i'm
[1:09:05] not very sure
[1:09:06] 10 to 17.
[1:09:20] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:09:22] lord and in the power of his might
[1:09:25] put on the whole armor of god
[1:09:28] that he may be able to stand against the
[1:09:31] wiles of the devil
[1:09:33] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:09:36] blood
[1:09:36] but against principalities against
[1:09:38] powers against
[1:09:40] rulers of darkness of this world against
[1:09:43] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:09:45] praise be to god
[1:09:46] now you can read the rest
[1:09:51] yes so
[1:09:54] we know
[1:09:58] that the captain of the army of the host
[1:10:01] of the army of the lord
[1:10:04] is in the midst of the camp
[1:10:08] but we are not called to go to bed
[1:10:12] to just go and sleep
[1:10:17] the bible here is telling us
[1:10:21] to put on the whole armor of god
[1:10:25] not just a part of it
[1:10:29] the whole ammo
[1:10:33] i think i would just have to read this
[1:10:37] so verse 14 stand therefore having your
[1:10:40] lines get about with truth
[1:10:42] and what is truth the word of god
[1:10:45] and having your breastplates of
[1:10:47] righteousness
[1:10:49] and your feet shut with the preparation
[1:10:52] of the
[1:10:53] gospel of peace above all
[1:10:56] taking the short of faith wherewith
[1:11:00] ye shall be able to quench all the fairy
[1:11:03] dust
[1:11:04] of the wicked and take the helmet of
[1:11:07] salvation and the word
[1:11:08] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:11:11] word of god
[1:11:13] praise be to god
[1:11:16] there is no way you can disregard the
[1:11:19] word of god
[1:11:20] and do god a favor
[1:11:23] if you sidestep the word
[1:11:26] or if you disobey the word of god
[1:11:30] i don't care what sacrifices you bring
[1:11:32] to god
[1:11:34] it stinks in the nose of god
[1:11:42] praise beauty god the best
[1:11:45] sacrifice you can ever give god
[1:11:48] is living by his word
[1:11:52] if you disobey the word of god i don't
[1:11:54] care what sacrifice you bring to god
[1:11:58] god is not honored in that right
[1:12:04] the word of god is the absolute
[1:12:10] taking god at his word
[1:12:14] it is the sword of the spirit
[1:12:18] we are we have a few things here we are
[1:12:19] going to read
[1:12:22] and you know as we've been trying to say
[1:12:27] the devil has been in this business
[1:12:29] longer than any of us here
[1:12:35] and the devil knows the word
[1:12:39] remember he quoted jesus the word he
[1:12:42] quoted him scripture
[1:12:45] when he said cast yourself and did by
[1:12:48] and and god will gave his angels charged
[1:12:50] to bear you up
[1:12:51] lest you dash your feet against the
[1:12:52] stone he was quoting him scripture
[1:12:56] but the difference between us and the
[1:12:58] devil is that he can't
[1:13:00] live by the word
[1:13:05] the world has taken on flesh in me and
[1:13:08] you
[1:13:11] that can never be said of the devil
[1:13:15] and the devil knows that now
[1:13:18] if the devil can get you we are talking
[1:13:21] about the word of god
[1:13:23] now when you take the word of god this
[1:13:25] is the word
[1:13:28] this is the word of god on print
[1:13:32] there is so much power in the world
[1:13:35] praise be to god
[1:13:36] sometimes we underrate ourselves
[1:13:40] and and in fact we don't do ourselves a
[1:13:42] favor
[1:13:44] i don't know where in america here but
[1:13:46] it was i think right here in america
[1:13:48] there was a car that caught fire and
[1:13:51] there was a bubble sitting on the
[1:13:53] dashboard
[1:13:54] the whole car consumed
[1:13:58] the fire consumed the whole car and left
[1:14:00] the bible sitting on the dashboard
[1:14:03] there is life in this world
[1:14:06] praise be to god now when you take the
[1:14:09] word of god
[1:14:10] there is there are two components here
[1:14:16] there is a part you see
[1:14:19] which is the word on print there is
[1:14:22] another part you don't see
[1:14:30] the bible says that the letter killeth
[1:14:34] by the spirit give up life
[1:14:38] so you know what it's a very dangerous
[1:14:42] situation
[1:14:43] if you take the letter and you leave out
[1:14:46] the spirit
[1:14:49] because that is what is going to
[1:14:50] transform your life
[1:14:54] we are not called to conform
[1:14:59] conforming to the word gives you a form
[1:15:02] of godliness
[1:15:04] it takes the power out of your life
[1:15:07] that you can come from jealousy to
[1:15:09] revelation
[1:15:11] and call the prophet in all your
[1:15:12] messages and yet
[1:15:15] there is no life
[1:15:22] so if the devil can get you to hang on
[1:15:25] the letter
[1:15:26] just hang on the letter
[1:15:30] he would have finished with you
[1:15:35] because the life is in the spirit is the
[1:15:38] spirit that brings the life
[1:15:44] you ought to examine your life
[1:15:48] by day and by night i know we are here
[1:15:52] we have to work
[1:15:53] we have to pay the bills god knows god
[1:15:56] does he understand i don't know
[1:16:02] my boss comes to me today we have a rant
[1:16:05] coming
[1:16:06] at the end of the month and um
[1:16:10] by now they know that i don't work on
[1:16:12] sundays
[1:16:13] so before he came he was telling
[1:16:15] somebody um
[1:16:17] i know he will work on saturday but i
[1:16:18] know you know he will not come in on
[1:16:20] sunday
[1:16:21] then he comes to me then there is this
[1:16:23] friend coming
[1:16:25] um are you willing to come in on
[1:16:28] saturday right i said yes but not sunday
[1:16:30] i said no
[1:16:32] and then as soon as he left the other
[1:16:34] person came and said
[1:16:35] you know what the manager was telling me
[1:16:36] he said you coming on saturday but
[1:16:38] you will not come in on sunday i said
[1:16:40] praise god
[1:16:44] let people know who you are
[1:16:47] christianity is not lived in secrets
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:52] the bible says that we are written
[1:16:54] epistles
[1:16:55] sin and read of all men
[1:16:59] by your very life every day
[1:17:03] you are preaching a semen
[1:17:07] leave me a sermon and preach me a sermon
[1:17:10] let people see christ in you the christ
[1:17:12] you are talking about
[1:17:13] let them see him in you
[1:17:17] praise be to god that god is on two feet
[1:17:22] oh my goodness my goodness one of these
[1:17:26] days
[1:17:26] it will all be over whatever it is that
[1:17:30] we are going through
[1:17:31] is just for a moment it's just for a
[1:17:34] while
[1:17:35] oh my goodness wonderful
[1:17:39] on that day when we meet there
[1:17:42] what the glorious woman that is going to
[1:17:44] be
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:47] if if the father could just bring the
[1:17:49] devil and put him down
[1:17:52] oh what a glorious thing it to be
[1:17:58] if every one of us can come and then
[1:18:00] point and say oh i can i remember this
[1:18:02] whip
[1:18:03] i put that whip mark on the back of the
[1:18:04] devil that would be so sweet
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:11] oh man the devil is a coward
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:18] he is a thief
[1:18:21] he is good for nothing but to be a
[1:18:23] footstool
[1:18:25] that is why he belongs under our feet
[1:18:27] always remember that don't ever forget
[1:18:28] it
[1:18:30] praise beauty girl now
[1:18:34] i i wouldn't be able to finish reading
[1:18:36] this i know i can see
[1:18:38] because
[1:18:41] but uh we don't have to cover everything
[1:18:44] for it
[1:18:45] to be a blessing if god is in it
[1:18:49] a word or two is enough praise be to god
[1:18:53] now praise be to god
[1:18:59] so but our chief captain reading from
[1:19:02] the
[1:19:03] prophet of this great army

[1:19:36] per pattern and those men who were at
[1:19:39] the front

[1:19:43] order

[1:37:43] that you come so low
[1:37:47] to pick us up
[1:37:51] from our rotiness and from our filth

[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:42] god
[1:38:47] [Music]
[1:38:56] is
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:18] appreciate the word tonight let's give
[1:39:21] the lord
[1:39:32] amen amen praise the lord
[1:39:35] you know we've been we've been taught
[1:39:38] you know by the prophet
[1:39:40] brother branham liking our age of this
[1:39:43] bright age
[1:39:44] told astronauts amen that's what he said
[1:39:47] in countdown
[1:39:49] so he taught us to count and we have to
[1:39:51] count properly
[1:39:53] in ephesians chapter 6 but dan read that
[1:39:56] you know many many in over the ages
[1:39:59] people we talk about the armor of god
[1:40:02] you know brother branham says the armor
[1:40:03] of god a supernatural
[1:40:05] so right there in ephesians chapter six
[1:40:08] paul
[1:40:08] lays seven armor
[1:40:12] he talks about truth he talks about
[1:40:14] righteousness
[1:40:16] you know we have to have truth we have
[1:40:19] to be able to tell the truth brother
[1:40:20] branham says
[1:40:21] even if they have to take it they have
[1:40:24] to take the height of our back
[1:40:26] we have to say it just like the way it
[1:40:28] was
[1:40:30] you know we we have to live a righteous
[1:40:32] life the gospel of peace
[1:40:34] what is the gospel of peace is the
[1:40:35] demonstration amen
[1:40:37] the life that we live is the gospel of
[1:40:39] peace we have to have
[1:40:41] faith you know we have to
[1:40:44] uh make our our salvation show
[1:40:48] and the word of god which is the saw but
[1:40:51] there is one other
[1:40:52] armor that comes invisible paul said
[1:40:56] prayed always
[1:40:58] that is the seven armor amen
[1:41:01] and if you notice right there in
[1:41:03] ephesians chapter 6 he
[1:41:04] never liking it to any ethnic substance
[1:41:08] because prayer is not an everything
[1:41:11] it cannot be lacking onto a helmet it
[1:41:13] cannot be lacking onto a belt
[1:41:16] because prayer is supernatural
[1:41:19] and that's why the prophet of god said
[1:41:20] we can never pray enough amen
[1:41:23] praise the lord so that is our seventh
[1:41:26] honor
[1:41:26] we have to keep there praise the lord
[1:41:29] and how can i overcome brother branham
[1:41:32] said
[1:41:34] then he says
[1:41:38] overcome means to recognize the devil
[1:41:41] in every one of his traits it's not to
[1:41:46] cram the bible in your head it's not to
[1:41:48] memorize scripture
[1:41:50] but it's to be able to recognize the
[1:41:53] devil
[1:41:54] in all of his traits amen
[1:41:57] a lot of people say there is there is no
[1:42:00] devil
[1:42:01] it's just a thought don't you believe
[1:42:03] that there is a real devil
[1:42:06] he's just as real as you
[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:11] so we have to recognize him amen he says
[1:42:14] a real devil
[1:42:15] and you must recognize him real you have
[1:42:18] to recognize him real
[1:42:21] you have to say satan i know it's you
[1:42:23] praise the lord
[1:42:24] and you know like brother branham said i
[1:42:26] mean brother dan was saying satan is not
[1:42:28] in the picture
[1:42:29] quoting brother branham let me let me
[1:42:31] share this with you
[1:42:32] you always realize when you are taking a
[1:42:35] family picture or the picture with a
[1:42:37] friend
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:38] is the guide that is not part of the
[1:42:41] picture
[1:42:42] he's the one that showed up because when
[1:42:44] you look at the picture
[1:42:46] he was not part of the picture so he
[1:42:48] always do a funny move
[1:42:50] and it turned out to be anybody look at
[1:42:53] the picture that's the first person to
[1:42:54] look at
[1:42:55] who is that person back there he was not
[1:42:57] part of the picture
[1:42:58] he just sneaked in and he wants to take
[1:43:00] over the show with some kind of a
[1:43:02] you know funny move or stupid move and
[1:43:04] that's what the devil does hey man
[1:43:07] unfortunately you can't hear the picture
[1:43:09] is
[1:43:10] you're going to destroy the memory
[1:43:12] praise the lord
[1:43:14] but you always have to recognize that
[1:43:15] guy that he's not part of the picture
[1:43:18] he just show up praise the lord amen so
[1:43:21] you must recognize him you must know
[1:43:24] he's a devil
[1:43:25] then the same time that you recognize
[1:43:29] him
[1:43:29] and know that he's a devil and
[1:43:33] he's against you praise the lord so we
[1:43:36] want to thank the lord
[1:43:38] you know brother dan was talking about
[1:43:39] that a fight in the devil i was reading
[1:43:41] i was really inspiring uh in my own
[1:43:44] bible studies
[1:43:46] and he and he took this scripture from
[1:43:49] ecclesiastes they came out very
[1:43:50] beautiful
[1:43:51] i want to share that with you also
[1:43:53] tonight he says uh
[1:43:55] eclipse i said nine four a living dog is
[1:43:58] better than a dead lion
[1:44:00] you know and the devil is a rolling lion
[1:44:02] so he's a dead lion praise the lord
[1:44:04] amen praise the lord so he says that he
[1:44:08] says
[1:44:08] life is a pressure thing and
[1:44:12] and in its humblious form
[1:44:15] life in his humblious form when i read
[1:44:18] this i want to listen
[1:44:20] to brother brennan message on life you
[1:44:22] know
[1:44:23] brother branham says in that message you
[1:44:25] know your loving kindness is better
[1:44:27] you know better than life he called it
[1:44:28] david there and
[1:44:30] i was just meditating on this life in
[1:44:32] its humblious form
[1:44:34] no matter what life throws to you amen
[1:44:38] it is superior than death
[1:44:42] praise the lord because there's no
[1:44:44] memory there is no repentance in the
[1:44:46] grave
[1:44:49] life in its humbliest form is better
[1:44:51] than death
[1:44:52] this truth is eminently setting in
[1:44:55] spiritual things
[1:44:57] no matter what level of your faith no
[1:44:59] matter what you're going through
[1:45:00] as long as you have life you have to
[1:45:04] know
[1:45:04] that life is given to you for you to
[1:45:06] fight
[1:45:08] and you got to make the best out of it
[1:45:12] don't no don't blame anybody
[1:45:16] as long as you have life where there is
[1:45:19] life
[1:45:19] there is hope that's what the guru's
[1:45:22] saying says
[1:45:23] he says in in spiritual things it is
[1:45:25] better
[1:45:27] to be least in the kingdom of heaven
[1:45:30] then the grit is out of it
[1:45:35] amen no matter what position you have
[1:45:38] in this life if it is not counted in
[1:45:41] god's kingdom forget about it
[1:45:44] the lowest degree of grace is superior
[1:45:49] to the anomalies development of a
[1:45:52] regenerated nature
[1:45:56] you see all the celebrity
[1:45:59] praise the lord man some of them
[1:46:02] they got to take in pills and pills and
[1:46:04] pills just to compose themselves
[1:46:07] for a thirty minutes act
[1:46:10] so they can be normal just to shoot at
[1:46:13] 10 minutes at the god of just
[1:46:15] take a lot of pills the lowest degree of
[1:46:19] grace that you have
[1:46:21] [Music]
[1:46:24] where the holy ghost implant divine
[1:46:27] life in the soul there
[1:46:31] is a precious deposit
[1:46:35] which none of the refinement
[1:46:38] of education can equal
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:42] praise the lord brother branham said
[1:46:45] hebrew exposition you can check it out
[1:46:47] he says
[1:46:48] he says the baptising of the holy ghost
[1:46:52] has filled in for our education
[1:46:56] the baptising of the holy ghost in the
[1:46:59] soul of the believer
[1:47:02] has filled in for the knowledge of this
[1:47:06] world
[1:47:10] the thief on the cross excels caesar on
[1:47:14] his throne
[1:47:17] lazarus among the dogs
[1:47:20] is better than caesarea among the
[1:47:22] senators
[1:47:25] and the most unlittered christian
[1:47:28] is in the sight of god superior than
[1:47:32] palette

[1:47:43] this tata

[1:48:04] than life amen

[1:51:37] where did i and the word of god be the
[1:51:40] truth
[1:51:41] but i dreamed that that
[1:51:44] the first ring was that there was a
[1:51:47] storm coming
[1:51:51] it was just like it was all mixed it was
[1:51:53] just sand
[1:51:54] smoke everything and it was just
[1:51:57] covering
[1:51:58] the whole land and it's just as fast as
[1:52:01] it could come
[1:52:03] that was that was the first one the
[1:52:05] second was was the same dream again
[1:52:09] but after it was done
[1:52:12] it had destroyed houses everything
[1:52:16] that was it was destroyed
[1:52:20] the third dream was i was standing and i
[1:52:22] was looking down
[1:52:25] towards the valley in the two mountains
[1:52:28] in a valley
[1:52:29] in the middle of the valley all of a
[1:52:30] sudden it shook
[1:52:32] and it was just rolling you know how you
[1:52:34] seen sometimes in these
[1:52:36] video clips volcanoes
[1:52:40] the lava flowing it this was
[1:52:43] trees everything and there was a city in
[1:52:46] the middle of it
[1:52:47] it was just going into the ocean
[1:52:51] that was my dream and i just got off of
[1:52:54] it i sat inside of the
[1:52:56] bed and i just said why did i dream this
[1:52:58] i usually don't drink just like this
[1:53:01] so
[1:53:05] and here is brother latte preaching
[1:53:10] of the smoke and all the dust and all
[1:53:12] these things is coming upon the earth
[1:53:14] so to me it was just god vindicating his
[1:53:18] word
[1:53:19] i i believe that i believe we're
[1:53:21] entering into the
[1:53:22] book of revelation and
[1:53:26] last night i couldn't sleep
[1:53:30] i got up at two o'clock in the morning
[1:53:33] and i went back to go to sleep and i
[1:53:35] said don't go to sleep
[1:53:39] i was reading rebellion i found myself
[1:53:41] reading revelation again at three
[1:53:43] o'clock in the morning
[1:53:45] how god is taking care of his bride
[1:53:50] and watching over her thank you because
[1:53:52] all these things are coming
[1:53:54] upon us that there's no he has spoken it
[1:53:59] and there is no way that you can stop it
[1:54:02] it's coming what you have to do is
[1:54:06] prepare for it
[1:54:07] and look look for his coming okay
[1:54:11] look for him the scripture says
[1:54:14] look up your redemption is nigh
