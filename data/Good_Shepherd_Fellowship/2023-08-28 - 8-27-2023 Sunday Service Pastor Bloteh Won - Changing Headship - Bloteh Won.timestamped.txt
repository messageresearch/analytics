[55:23] into the message you know so uh the the
[55:27] the the gift of the spirit the gift of
[55:29] tongue stay Stayed there with them and I

[56:25] uh to see how you know the simple way
[56:29] that the Lord can come down and move
[56:32] among these people not even knowing some
[56:34] of the things that the people are

[57:14] Redemption I've preached that year but I
[57:17] took it in the in a different way to be
[57:20] able to help the people
[57:23] that they have had a secret that she
[57:25] didn't know of her secret was
[57:27] predestination amen and uh
[57:31] uh
[57:34] so after after the the service this this
[57:38] sister came to me with you know with uh
[57:41] with tears in her eyes and she wanted to
[57:44] to share something with me and uh and
[57:47] she told me one of the beautiful
[57:50] sweetest stories I've ever heard after
[57:52] the long time
[57:54] she pulled me in the shot and said
[57:56] brother one can I share something with
[57:57] you I said you are free you know what
[57:59] and and uh
[58:01] um
[58:03] and she told me
[58:05] you know I mean almost crying she says I
[58:08] can't remember how many years now but uh
[58:13] she been divorced from her husband you
[58:16] know husband put away
[58:18] and and she said uh you know after the
[58:22] Lord brought her through all of the
[58:24] bitterness and and you know and
[58:26] everything that she did with
[58:29] she said a couple of months ago she said
[58:33] I was just she says yeah I know I mean
[58:36] he have gone whatever life he was living
[58:39] that was up to him
[58:40] I would just uh praying for the
[58:43] Salvation of his soul
[58:46] and uh
[58:49] I was just praying that God would save
[58:51] him you know I never wanted him back
[58:54] after all as a husband I just praying
[58:57] that God was safe and she says I took
[58:59] our wedding picture
[59:01] and I put it on the wall
[59:05] I hang the wedding picture on the wall
[59:07] that I've never done for many years
[59:12] she said
[59:13] I think it was in a week or two
[59:18] her husband called her back
[59:22] apparently he was listening to a message
[59:24] from Cloverdale then he was even
[59:26] listening to a message that brought the
[59:27] biscal preach uh
[59:30] long time ago maybe he was streaming
[59:32] online or so
[59:34] and she said
[59:38] he said that message brought him to his
[59:41] knees and he cried and he cried and he
[59:46] cried
[59:49] and uh and called his wife and you know
[59:52] and and and beg her if he can come back
[59:56] home
[59:58] she says I didn't know what to do
[1:00:00] because I mean I've lost feeling for
[1:00:02] this man I was only praying for the
[1:00:04] Salvation of his soul
[1:00:07] God
[1:00:10] that works on both ends praise the Lord
[1:00:13] she didn't say that I'm just I'm just
[1:00:16] putting the picture together God that
[1:00:18] works on both ends
[1:00:20] was not only dealing with him for the
[1:00:22] Salvation of his soul but was also
[1:00:25] dealing with him to come back home
[1:00:28] praise the Lord
[1:00:30] I mean they are just brought me to tears
[1:00:32] and we were both standing there she's
[1:00:34] crying before me and I'm just on my eyes
[1:00:36] because we really had a good time we had
[1:00:39] we had such a presence
[1:00:41] such a presence that it was hard to even
[1:00:45] close the service amen but we thank the
[1:00:48] Lord amen
[1:00:49] we thank the Lord and and just like I
[1:00:52] said I mean there are just been
[1:00:54] different things there's there's uh that
[1:00:57] we that we've been dealing with as a
[1:00:58] church and uh uh I think you can see the
[1:01:03] the the ASU system is down again
[1:01:08] and the trustees have to make some
[1:01:12] decisions
[1:01:13] whether to get a new one and uh with
[1:01:16] with some future plans that uh we are
[1:01:20] also making or praying about for the
[1:01:22] church so uh
[1:01:25] uh uh I mean that is their call they
[1:01:27] will have to decide on what to do
[1:01:30] praise the Lord
[1:01:34] and uh
[1:01:36] it is uh not only via call like I said
[1:01:39] hoping that we can be able to have some
[1:01:42] a church meeting here during the fall
[1:01:44] because there are things that we need to
[1:01:46] talk about as a church
[1:01:49] praise the Lord
[1:01:51] amen
[1:01:54] this place has has uh has been good for
[1:01:58] us and it is still good for us
[1:02:01] it is not like we we have overgrown the
[1:02:04] building
[1:02:05] but yet we are outgrowing the building
[1:02:09] in a sense
[1:02:11] because we we still having
[1:02:14] uh young people
[1:02:16] and uh and we trust in the Lord too
[1:02:20] to continue and to bless us all there
[1:02:22] are things that we'll have to talk about
[1:02:24] I would not want to take all of that
[1:02:27] but then beside that also uh we send a
[1:02:32] request out for Brother Steve John Bibi
[1:02:34] and he's been dealing with himself I
[1:02:36] hope I will have talked to him this
[1:02:38] morning but uh we will we will be able
[1:02:41] to share more more of that uh uh
[1:02:44] concerning himself with you I want to
[1:02:46] talk to him before I do that
[1:02:48] and uh I think there's you know why that
[1:02:52] we also have seen brother uh wanna name
[1:02:54] this uh but one uh you know has been
[1:02:58] uh we talk frequently during the week
[1:03:02] and uh he's just been to the place where
[1:03:06] oh
[1:03:08] he's been struggling a little bit with
[1:03:10] his memory
[1:03:12] and it's March safe when he stayed
[1:03:14] closer to home and to his wife so uh uh
[1:03:18] so I mean just just different things you
[1:03:21] know uh
[1:03:24] people uh you know trusting God for a
[1:03:29] movie in their lives and move in their
[1:03:31] home and placing their marriages before
[1:03:34] the Lord and the uh their wives their
[1:03:38] husbands and different things
[1:03:40] and out of the ad you see we we come
[1:03:43] here to church and then uh you know we
[1:03:46] we think the world is bridge and we go
[1:03:50] home
[1:03:51] that is just a little that is just just
[1:03:53] a little part of of the whole thing that
[1:03:56] have to do with this church there's a
[1:03:58] lot that is that is behind the scene
[1:04:01] praise the Lord
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:04] and uh
[1:04:06] you know in all of that
[1:04:09] you know uh
[1:04:11] I mean even
[1:04:12] the
[1:04:21] but in the midst of all of that
[1:04:24] yes I mean last Sunday after service uh
[1:04:28] my brother Chacha came to me and uh
[1:04:32] butchacha actually has been the brother
[1:04:34] there so I think he have he have hanged
[1:04:37] around this church for a good while now
[1:04:40] and uh he and sister Joy uh the older
[1:04:45] sister Joy used to work to the same
[1:04:47] place in uh
[1:04:49] and one I think she wanted to come to
[1:04:52] church and and it was Brooklyn Center
[1:04:55] and he was living close by then you know
[1:04:58] and uh but he dropped her to church and
[1:05:02] asked if he could come and then since
[1:05:05] that time he stayed coming praise the
[1:05:06] Lord
[1:05:07] amen so but if you remember we have
[1:05:12] brother Crosby from the UK sometime in
[1:05:16] match and he was preaching for us and
[1:05:20] around that time brother Church abroad a
[1:05:23] prayer request of his sister back in
[1:05:26] Kenya that was diagnosed with
[1:05:29] a tumor a stage four
[1:05:33] cancer then if you have what we actually
[1:05:35] remind you but Crosby was was preaching
[1:05:39] and actually he had a picture of of a
[1:05:42] rat with a cancer cell you know that he
[1:05:46] was you know that he was going to show
[1:05:47] so that that prayer request just fell
[1:05:51] right in line with his message so if you
[1:05:54] remember all through the service he kept
[1:05:56] he kept repeating it you know uh you
[1:05:59] know tell your sister she's healed you
[1:06:01] know he kept echoing it and he kept
[1:06:04] echoing it all through the service
[1:06:06] praise the Lord
[1:06:08] so NASA uh Sunday after the service you
[1:06:13] know he came into the office and uh he's
[1:06:16] actually he's a quiet type of person so
[1:06:18] he's coming he's as well can I talk to
[1:06:21] you I said yeah go ahead and you know
[1:06:23] he's uh he's talking and very quiet lady
[1:06:26] and and
[1:06:27] justifying to mean that his sister has
[1:06:30] been healed completely 100 percent
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:39] praise the Lord
[1:06:43] then I told him I said is that what you
[1:06:45] are telling me quietly like this
[1:06:48] you are telling me that your sister is
[1:06:50] healed
[1:06:52] with with a doctor report this is the

[1:07:20] give the Lord a hand of praise
[1:07:21] [Applause]

[1:07:39] actually wanted to just print this and
[1:07:41] and keep it so immediately after service
[1:07:44] I called brother Crosby uh he's uh he's
[1:07:47] over in Zimbabwe and uh

[1:08:39] of the different things that we go
[1:08:41] through we are serving the Living God
[1:08:43] that is among his people
[1:08:46] praise the Lord
[1:08:48] you know the promise of the rapture
[1:08:51] the promise of the Rapture when Paul
[1:08:54] speaks of that in Thessalonian that was
[1:08:57] going to be the message I was going to
[1:08:58] preach on Wednesday night over in
[1:09:00] Tennessee but for some reason you know
[1:09:03] the Lord had a different he had a
[1:09:05] different plan Paul said uh in in in uh
[1:09:09] testimony did that in life
[1:09:14] and remain

[1:16:31] chapter one
[1:16:53] are we together after the book of
[1:16:55] Philippians
[1:16:57] let's take chapter one and uh
[1:17:00] Let's uh
[1:17:02] let's read uh from verse 12. I got this
[1:17:07] this uh this tournament on on my heart
[1:17:10] I got this inspiration
[1:17:13] uh like I told you sometime here in in
[1:17:16] September
[1:17:17] uh uh
[1:17:19] our dear brother
[1:17:21] of blessed memory brother uh mirror that
[1:17:24] went to be with the Lord uh the church
[1:17:27] has finally settled with one of the the
[1:17:30] ministers there to be their Pastor so uh
[1:17:34] uh brother dele will be coming in
[1:17:37] so after the labor of the weekend
[1:17:41] meetings the next Wednesday not this
[1:17:44] coming one but the following one he will
[1:17:46] be with us he will pray for us Wednesday
[1:17:48] he will preach for us Sunday and then uh
[1:17:51] he will go back down to DC and be with
[1:17:55] the church there they will be doing the
[1:17:58] voting in of uh uh the the pastor and
[1:18:03] then after uh they would want to
[1:18:06] do uh how uh
[1:18:12] the kind of for inauguration service or
[1:18:15] or how they call it now I hope I'm using
[1:18:18] the right word praise the Lord so uh
[1:18:21] they asked that both of us come and do
[1:18:23] the services for them so uh uh uh I
[1:18:28] would just
[1:18:30] thinking on something or meditating or
[1:18:32] listening to the word or something like
[1:18:34] that and this thought dropped on my
[1:18:36] heart changing hair shape
[1:18:39] and when it drove up my heart I thought
[1:18:41] okay maybe Lord that's what you want me
[1:18:43] to preach for them there and uh because
[1:18:46] most of the time that's that's that's
[1:18:47] the way it works with me if I have a
[1:18:50] service to go and preach preach to fall
[1:18:52] I prayed about it and and then and
[1:18:55] sometimes the law will lay something on
[1:18:57] my heart sometimes all the sepsis
[1:18:59] messages I would preach sometimes just
[1:19:01] one message and to me it always gives me
[1:19:04] that sense of uh confirmation collusion
[1:19:08] chapter 1 verse 12. so I got this
[1:19:11] thought to speak on those meetings but
[1:19:14] then why I was uh I was I was uh
[1:19:19] waiting on the Lord and thinking about
[1:19:21] what to talk about
[1:19:24] uh for some reason a draw they start
[1:19:27] kind of a drop of my heart so I say well
[1:19:28] okay uh this is the Home Folks let's
[1:19:31] let's try with them if it works then it
[1:19:34] will work that's what amen
[1:19:36] so yeah uh verse 12 giving thanks unto
[1:19:40] the father
[1:19:42] which have made us meet to be partakers
[1:19:46] of the inheritance of the Saints in
[1:19:50] light
[1:19:51] who have delivered us from the power of
[1:19:55] Darkness
[1:19:57] and have translated us
[1:20:00] into the kingdom
[1:20:02] of his dear son
[1:20:05] he has delivered us a changing of
[1:20:09] hership
[1:20:10] he has delivered us from one Kingdom
[1:20:14] and he has brought us to another kingdom
[1:20:19] praise the Lord that's what I took the
[1:20:21] inspiration from who have delivered us
[1:20:24] from the power of Darkness it's a
[1:20:27] kingdom
[1:20:28] amen the power of darkness is a kingdom
[1:20:32] and have translated us into the kingdom
[1:20:37] of his dear son in whom we have
[1:20:40] Redemption through his blood even the
[1:20:43] Forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[1:20:48] the invisible God their firstborn
[1:20:51] of every creature
[1:20:54] the Lord bless you you can have your
[1:20:56] seat while we turn to Romans chapter 7.
[1:21:00] you know so I I I I I was I was thinking
[1:21:05] about there because
[1:21:08] talking about praising break
[1:21:11] I was thinking on uh uh
[1:21:14] uh I started I started going back and
[1:21:16] started looking at different praising
[1:21:18] different notorious praising
[1:21:22] and one thing that I found out is that
[1:21:26] uh
[1:21:27] uh
[1:21:28] from every prison
[1:21:30] you know brother Brian talk about uh
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:34] uh I was I was I was looking for it this
[1:21:36] morning I've read I read it read series
[1:21:38] of quotes on it and I even uh uh
[1:21:42] listened to a documentary on that
[1:21:44] praising it's a notorious present in uh
[1:21:47] in the U.S uh
[1:21:53] what
[1:21:55] orchestras yes yes that's right
[1:21:58] yes brother
[1:22:00] but Wesley being around Long amen
[1:22:04] so uh I can count on him for that that's
[1:22:07] exactly right brother Wesley brother
[1:22:09] Brahms spoke on that praising and uh
[1:22:13] there was a Prison Break
[1:22:16] that took place
[1:22:18] from their praising
[1:22:20] and and the the the the I mean uh
[1:22:24] because it's it's surrounded
[1:22:27] you know it's surrounded by body of
[1:22:29] waters
[1:22:31] praise the Lord and and I think after
[1:22:34] the men were caught the the interview
[1:22:37] them and kind of found out how they were
[1:22:39] able but this is something that is very
[1:22:42] very unique with every human prison the
[1:22:45] praising us are always looking for how
[1:22:48] to get out
[1:22:50] I don't care how terrible it is I don't
[1:22:53] care how they say stuff this place you
[1:22:57] know nobody can get out
[1:22:59] from all the praisings most of the
[1:23:02] presents they have always been a Prison
[1:23:05] Break
[1:23:06] praise the Lord men have fine uh uh you
[1:23:11] know uh uh uh terrible way I mean even
[1:23:16] even during the Holocaust
[1:23:18] you know you you you follow the
[1:23:21] documentary and escape from uh some
[1:23:23] people you know what it is they were
[1:23:25] able to dig dig under the Earth and they
[1:23:28] dig enough to go away from the praising
[1:23:31] camp
[1:23:32] the dog under the Earth
[1:23:35] using spoons
[1:23:37] and rocks
[1:23:39] to find their way away from the praising
[1:23:42] camp
[1:23:43] where they will be able to bust the
[1:23:45] Earth open and Escape it's it's just
[1:23:48] like that
[1:23:50] you see but
[1:23:52] as I was thinking about it
[1:23:55] I was I was trying to find that you know
[1:23:58] uh uh uh how to relate this you know
[1:24:01] I've I I really I really you know I'm
[1:24:04] kind of for working on it pray for me
[1:24:05] and I'm working on it amen
[1:24:08] but
[1:24:11] what I realized is that
[1:24:15] man has never been able to find a way to
[1:24:20] to break themselves free
[1:24:23] from the praising of theirselves
[1:24:28] praise the Lord just like we said before
[1:24:33] you are in a cell
[1:24:35] s call it the cells of your body
[1:24:41] you are here behind
[1:24:43] bars of Bones
[1:24:47] praise the Lord
[1:24:48] I took that line from uh uh
[1:24:53] uh the song uh
[1:24:56] Hills of whom are calling me
[1:24:59] and uh
[1:25:01] you you are heading Beyond bars of Bones
[1:25:06] you are caught up in this body that is
[1:25:09] made out of cells from your your your
[1:25:12] your parents grandparents great
[1:25:15] grandparents and all of that the the
[1:25:18] your rear identity is is here in there
[1:25:22] and uh but man has never never been able
[1:25:26] to break themselves free
[1:25:29] from the cells of their body
[1:25:32] praise the Lord
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:36] and uh
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:40] that's where my mind was
[1:25:43] because I was I was standing there
[1:25:45] during the week
[1:25:47] and uh I was going to read from the book
[1:25:50] of Acts how the angel came down
[1:25:53] and brought Peter out of prison to John
[1:25:55] Mark house
[1:25:57] praise the Lord how the angel came down
[1:26:00] and and break the praise in open
[1:26:04] for Paul and Silas
[1:26:07] were the Philippian Jailer would have
[1:26:09] killed himself
[1:26:12] one of the first praising and praising
[1:26:14] of that the Bible recorded was Joseph
[1:26:20] and we realized that
[1:26:23] it was Joseph's gift that gave him a
[1:26:27] Prison Break
[1:26:31] praise the Lord
[1:26:32] so which mean it was it was God that did
[1:26:35] it supernaturally
[1:26:37] because it is God that give gifts
[1:26:41] praise the Lord if God never came down
[1:26:44] and and closed the mouth of the Lions
[1:26:46] the Lions who have eaten Daniel
[1:26:51] so it was God that came down and gave
[1:26:54] Dania a Prison Break
[1:26:57] are we together
[1:26:59] amen so uh uh
[1:27:05] and that's where the story started
[1:27:07] becoming beautiful for me and I'm I'm
[1:27:09] thinking it looks like I'm preaching
[1:27:10] that message
[1:27:12] but I'm just telling you where where my
[1:27:14] heart has been
[1:27:17] praise the Lord
[1:27:18] I'm just telling you where my heart has
[1:27:20] been but this morning we want to talk on
[1:27:24] on uh uh changing hairship Romans
[1:27:28] chapter 7 let's read from verse 1.
[1:27:33] Romans chapter 7
[1:27:35] let's read from verse 1.
[1:27:40] praise the Lord
[1:28:03] no you're not brethrens for I speak to
[1:28:05] them that know the Lord how that the
[1:28:08] Lord have dominion over a man as long as
[1:28:12] he liveth
[1:28:14] their sport emphasis
[1:28:17] no bread means that have the Lord has
[1:28:20] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[1:28:25] so what is he going to do he's going to
[1:28:27] pull something from the law to make that
[1:28:30] picture clear to us
[1:28:32] for the woman which have and husband is
[1:28:35] bound by the law to her husband so long
[1:28:39] as he live it but if the husband be dead
[1:28:45] she is loose from The Lord of her
[1:28:48] husband
[1:28:49] so then if why her husband living she be
[1:28:53] married to another man
[1:28:56] she shall be called an adulterous but if
[1:29:00] her husband be dead she is free from
[1:29:03] their law so that she is no adulteress
[1:29:07] door she be married to another man
[1:29:11] wherefore my brethrens yeah also have
[1:29:14] become dead to the Lord by the body of
[1:29:20] Christ praise the Lord
[1:29:22] amen see the contracts here see the way
[1:29:25] Paul is doing this here he says that the
[1:29:29] man is dead then the woman is free to be
[1:29:33] married he said but you brethrens you
[1:29:36] are dead to the Lord
[1:29:38] amen you are there to the Lord and in
[1:29:43] that way we can be married to Christ
[1:29:48] the Lord so there have to be a change of
[1:29:52] hairship
[1:29:54] in the change of headship one influence
[1:29:57] have to die
[1:30:01] are we together
[1:30:03] one influence have to die
[1:30:07] praise the Lord
[1:30:09] that's that's where we want that's where
[1:30:11] we want to put our our emphasis this
[1:30:15] morning wherefore my brethrens here also
[1:30:18] I become dead to the Lord
[1:30:22] the body of Christ
[1:30:24] that year should be married to another
[1:30:27] even to him who is Raising from the dead
[1:30:32] I love that
[1:30:34] that we should bring bring full fruit
[1:30:37] onto God now you have to wash now Paul
[1:30:41] never said therefore graduates the Lord
[1:30:43] is dead
[1:30:45] no he never said the Lord is dead
[1:30:50] are you watching that
[1:30:52] he said yeah I did unto the Lord
[1:30:59] are we together
[1:31:01] it is it is it is it is beautiful place
[1:31:04] because because the thing about it there
[1:31:07] is that uh Grace is a progression of the
[1:31:11] Lord
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:15] Grace is a progression of the law the
[1:31:18] law was a shadow of good things to come
[1:31:21] you see that is the reason why when
[1:31:24] people try to struggle by themselves to
[1:31:28] get themselves away from legalizing they
[1:31:31] make a disgrace of the grace of God
[1:31:36] are we together
[1:31:38] we are not supposed to serve God on a
[1:31:41] legalism he says ye are dead unto the
[1:31:45] Lord
[1:31:47] praise the Lord
[1:31:49] the Lord is there the word of God is
[1:31:52] dead but as you are looking ahead you
[1:31:54] are not looking at it from the place or
[1:31:56] for legalistic standpoint
[1:31:59] praise the Lord
[1:32:01] you are looking ahead to see the picture
[1:32:04] the picture of Christ
[1:32:08] because if you cut it off completely
[1:32:12] you will not be able to see the perfect
[1:32:14] Lord of Liberty
[1:32:18] are we together
[1:32:22] now so uh uh uh
[1:32:26] invisible Union
[1:32:28] this this first quote yet is from
[1:32:30] invisible Union
[1:32:32] uh
[1:32:34] uh I don't I don't have the yeah okay he
[1:32:37] says here and and it's not directed to
[1:32:41] anything or any certain person but I'm
[1:32:44] just read that uh that uh
[1:32:47] uh he just read that uh
[1:32:50] uh uh kind of doing something here
[1:32:54] okay
[1:32:57] I like to remove my jacket but it looks
[1:33:00] like
[1:33:00] if I'm going to preach with jacket on
[1:33:12] I stay thank you sir I still remember
[1:33:15] that old mama and she said why do you
[1:33:17] wear it if you're going to take it off
[1:33:21] praise the Lord
[1:33:23] now so brother Branham just read Romans
[1:33:25] chapter 7. that's where he brought
[1:33:27] invisible Union message from so he's
[1:33:30] he's going to deal with this he said
[1:33:32] it's not directed to any
[1:33:34] person uh any certain person
[1:33:38] just to the church the body of Christ
[1:33:40] that we are trying to to lead to deeper
[1:33:45] thoughts and higher objectives
[1:33:49] praise the Lord you see how he placed
[1:33:52] that to deeper thoughts and higher
[1:33:54] objective believing that the coming of
[1:33:57] the Lord Jesus is a hand Paul here is
[1:34:01] giving an illustration in our scripture
[1:34:04] about Lord and Grace
[1:34:06] and illustrating it like marriage and
[1:34:10] divorce
[1:34:11] praise the Lord
[1:34:13] amen now so he said this passage is very
[1:34:17] solemn preached on because it's more or
[1:34:19] less pertained like marriage and their
[1:34:21] voice but it's also pertain to a greater
[1:34:25] portion of marriage and divorce of how
[1:34:28] that he is trying to set in order yet
[1:34:31] he's trying to set in order that we as a
[1:34:35] church can no more be married to the
[1:34:38] word and to Christ at the same time
[1:34:43] praise the Lord
[1:34:45] they have to be a change of hairship
[1:34:50] praise the Lord
[1:34:52] to be able to have the the the the right
[1:34:56] and the benefit
[1:35:00] of
[1:35:02] of of of of your new life of your new
[1:35:05] marriage there has to be a change of
[1:35:09] hairship
[1:35:10] that's the emphasis here
[1:35:13] and that's what I want us as a church to
[1:35:17] pay attention to
[1:35:19] it's more of
[1:35:25] what is our hairship who is our headship
[1:35:29] who are we under
[1:35:33] as a church
[1:35:35] who are we under
[1:35:38] that's what I want for us to pay
[1:35:40] attention to
[1:35:41] even even us in our own individual life
[1:35:49] I mean I've been abroad a bride of Jesus
[1:35:53] Christ it's not it's not believing
[1:35:54] brother Branham to be a messenger
[1:35:58] praise the Lord I would tell you there
[1:36:00] are a lot of people in the Pentecostal
[1:36:02] ring that believe that brother Branham
[1:36:03] was a Vindicated prophet
[1:36:06] amen they do they they do better on the
[1:36:09] I believe more than people that are
[1:36:11] hanging around the message
[1:36:18] praise the Lord being a bride of Jesus
[1:36:21] Christ is not just on it when we are
[1:36:23] baptized in the name of Jesus we take on
[1:36:26] the name of Jesus but you have to
[1:36:28] realize there is a hanging Prophecy from
[1:36:31] Isaiah that in this day seven women will
[1:36:34] take all to one man and say we only want
[1:36:38] your name
[1:36:39] so if your experienced owners stop to
[1:36:42] water baptism in Jesus name you are only
[1:36:44] taking his name that that is not enough
[1:36:51] praise the Lord
[1:36:53] that is not enough for you to be able to
[1:36:56] enjoy the benefit of this Union
[1:37:03] are we together
[1:37:06] it's not enough to be able to enjoy the
[1:37:10] benefit of this Union
[1:37:15] are we together
[1:37:17] that's what I want for I I want I want
[1:37:19] to be able to grab a stool
[1:37:24] where are we having our airship
[1:37:27] there are some things we're looking to
[1:37:29] this morning as we trust the Lord
[1:37:32] he says but
[1:37:34] but it's also pertained to to a greater
[1:37:37] portion of marriage and divorce and how
[1:37:40] he is trying to set in other years that
[1:37:43] we as a church can no no more be married
[1:37:47] to the word and to Christ at the same
[1:37:50] time
[1:37:52] and be legal and lawful about it
[1:37:57] praise the Lord
[1:38:00] we can never be legal the truth about
[1:38:03] the matter that is that you will not
[1:38:04] have the benefit
[1:38:06] of what it is to be the Bride of Jesus
[1:38:09] Christ you will not have the benefit to
[1:38:12] be able to use the father name in prayer
[1:38:15] and have a result
[1:38:18] if you are not falling on his headship
[1:38:22] praise the Lord I mean all of these
[1:38:24] things that God abound you in Jesus name
[1:38:26] about you in Jesus you will not have the
[1:38:29] right you will not have the benefits
[1:38:33] of using the father name and having a
[1:38:37] result
[1:38:42] when when the apostles were were you
[1:38:45] know when they were challenged with
[1:38:47] demon-possessed people and and and and
[1:38:50] and and and a man comes and they get a
[1:38:53] beautiful Peter could say silver and
[1:38:55] gold are half man but what I have I give
[1:38:57] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:59] rise you see there was completely
[1:39:02] honored the headship of Jesus Christ
[1:39:04] they never had a thing twice to use his
[1:39:07] name
[1:39:11] you don't have that benefit because you
[1:39:13] come to a message Church
[1:39:15] you don't have that benefit because you
[1:39:17] are born with parents that were in the
[1:39:19] message
[1:39:22] like he said he has delivered us from
[1:39:25] the from the the power of darkness and
[1:39:28] he has translated us into
[1:39:33] there has to be a change of headship
[1:39:40] praise the Lord
[1:39:52] as a church
[1:39:55] can no more be married to the word and
[1:39:58] to Christ at the same time and be legal
[1:40:01] and lawful about it
[1:40:03] then it can be for a woman to be living
[1:40:07] with with a husband why she got
[1:40:12] a living husband
[1:40:15] praise the Lord
[1:40:16] he says
[1:40:18] I have my own thought about that and I
[1:40:21] believe that that's what the Bible says
[1:40:23] is the truth but I believe also uh
[1:40:29] it's to my belief that
[1:40:33] it unfold one of the greatest mystery of
[1:40:37] Prophecy
[1:40:39] praise the Lord
[1:40:41] and what is that what is that mystery
[1:40:43] the prophecy is concerning the church
[1:40:46] is a mystery of Prophecy that God is
[1:40:49] going to deliver the church from
[1:40:51] legalizing and he's going to translate
[1:40:54] the church he's going to bring up to the
[1:40:56] place where Christ will have the
[1:40:59] preeminence in his church
[1:41:02] this Rapture in church will fulfill that
[1:41:05] that scripture in the Bible
[1:41:09] this rapturing church will fulfill the
[1:41:12] free for purpose
[1:41:14] praise the Lord why because in the first
[1:41:18] purpose God was able to get a man
[1:41:22] he was able to get a man that he could
[1:41:25] reveal himself to
[1:41:26] the second purpose his need to get a
[1:41:29] church
[1:41:30] that he can have the full preeminine so
[1:41:33] there is a prophecy that is hanging over
[1:41:35] this bride and the way to be able to
[1:41:39] benefit from that
[1:41:41] is to be able to have this experience
[1:41:44] the change of headship
[1:41:47] amen
[1:41:50] praise the Lord
[1:41:51] I mean that's the reason why we we we
[1:41:54] can sit around and and and and all we
[1:41:58] can do we can just argue we can sit
[1:42:00] around and all we can do and we can just
[1:42:02] see all the things that is happening
[1:42:04] around the message and sometimes people
[1:42:06] use that just to give themselves a
[1:42:08] caution that I mean even though I'm not
[1:42:10] bad because all of these things are
[1:42:12] going on but I'm telling you with all of
[1:42:14] these things that are going on God is
[1:42:16] still moving on behalf of his people
[1:42:18] there are people that are experiencing
[1:42:20] the supernatural of God
[1:42:29] foreign
[1:42:33] amen
[1:42:36] there are people that are experiencing
[1:42:37] the supernatural of God they are
[1:42:39] experiencing the benefit
[1:42:42] because there's a benefit
[1:42:44] praise the Lord there's a benefit
[1:42:52] so let's go let's go on a little bit he
[1:42:54] says uh uh he says it will unfold one of
[1:42:58] the greatest mystery of Prophecy he
[1:43:01] speaks here of your Moody after reading
[1:43:03] Romans chapter 7 he ran into the street
[1:43:05] and the first man he met he said do you
[1:43:08] know Grace
[1:43:11] Amazing Grace how sweet that sound
[1:43:15] they'll save a rest like me Grace
[1:43:17] precious Grace and more of Grace To Know
[1:43:22] praise the Lord
[1:43:23] for it is by Grace we are safe not by
[1:43:27] what we can do
[1:43:30] what what whatever we do is not counter
[1:43:35] to us Grace is what save us
[1:43:37] by grace are you safe through faith
[1:43:42] praise the Lord
[1:43:45] are we together
[1:43:48] amen
[1:43:49] and I saw that's uh that's that's what I
[1:43:53] want for us to dwell on the this this uh
[1:43:56] this morning and seeing how that uh uh
[1:44:01] uh that change of hairship now when you
[1:44:04] look at it in the natural
[1:44:07] it is not so easy
[1:44:10] it is not so easy
[1:44:13] praise the Lord you just just look at
[1:44:16] some some uh some uh some natural trench
[1:44:20] of uh the change of hairship or the
[1:44:23] change of leadership
[1:44:25] praise the Lord
[1:44:26] you find that uh uh uh you you you you
[1:44:31] can even see that uh uh
[1:44:37] even when the children change School
[1:44:41] praise the Lord the being under this
[1:44:43] teacher the law of the teacher they love
[1:44:46] their friends when they have to change
[1:44:48] school they struggle sometimes
[1:44:52] praise the Lord
[1:44:57] you will see that uh
[1:45:01] one of the place we see it the most just
[1:45:03] like Paul is making us to see here we
[1:45:06] see it in marriages
[1:45:09] praise the Lord
[1:45:11] people leave uh uh uh uh sit and grow in
[1:45:17] in a church they grow on the assertive
[1:45:20] leadership of the Holy Spirit and uh uh
[1:45:24] and then if they have to move I mean it
[1:45:27] don't comes automatically
[1:45:30] praise the Lord
[1:45:33] you never realize that the way you have
[1:45:36] been taught
[1:45:38] and the way you grow up to believe
[1:45:40] things how much it made you
[1:45:44] how much of that is part of you
[1:45:48] praise the Lord
[1:45:50] and sometimes people come and then the
[1:45:54] the the the the
[1:45:55] you know the the move to another place
[1:45:58] they sit there and the local have things
[1:46:01] are done all through the eyes of the way
[1:46:04] they were brought up
[1:46:06] praise the Lord
[1:46:07] unless the Holy Ghost comes on the scene
[1:46:10] and illuminate them they can be able to
[1:46:13] see something that they can reconcile
[1:46:14] with the word
[1:46:16] until that happened
[1:46:19] amen
[1:46:20] until that happened you will never break
[1:46:23] away
[1:46:25] it will always be like I I love the
[1:46:29] services but I love the way we did
[1:46:30] things
[1:46:33] what brings the change is a light on the
[1:46:36] word
[1:46:38] when the Holy Ghost can come down and
[1:46:40] and just Enlighten you and open your
[1:46:43] eyes
[1:46:45] and you realize there is more of Grace
[1:46:48] To Know
[1:46:50] praise the Lord
[1:46:52] Hallelujah there is more of Grace to
[1:46:54] know there is there is there is more of
[1:46:56] of God to know God people are diverse
[1:47:02] are we together
[1:47:11] and the same thing also just like I said
[1:47:15] in marriages
[1:47:18] you know we get we we we we get uh we
[1:47:21] get uh caught up in the law of fever
[1:47:25] amen
[1:47:26] we're gonna we go around you know in the
[1:47:29] law of fever and then after the after
[1:47:31] the love fever is is over then we we you
[1:47:34] know we we hit the reality of life
[1:47:38] praise the Lord
[1:47:40] now if uh if uh uh in in in in in in
[1:47:43] both ways if the person had a heart a
[1:47:47] loving father they're always protected
[1:47:50] them you know and and always cherish
[1:47:52] them with love
[1:47:54] automatically you start to expect that
[1:47:56] from your husband
[1:47:59] praise the Lord
[1:48:01] the truth is you didn't marry your
[1:48:03] father
[1:48:06] amen that's the truth you didn't marry
[1:48:09] your father you have to come to that
[1:48:10] reality quickly
[1:48:16] yeah I'm married and not a brother he's
[1:48:18] not my father
[1:48:20] amen
[1:48:22] I mean even even though you can you can
[1:48:25] you can you can
[1:48:28] you can you can love him as your father
[1:48:33] praise the Lord
[1:48:36] you know so even in the natural
[1:48:40] in the natural that that little struggle
[1:48:43] is there
[1:48:44] we go through that you know you take
[1:48:47] time to be able to you know you you
[1:48:50] trust the person you love the person
[1:48:52] it's not like you are trying to hold
[1:48:54] back and say I really need to know that
[1:48:57] on a nature that's how it works why
[1:49:00] because certain things have to die
[1:49:06] it's not in the sense that you you are
[1:49:09] killing the love of your father or you
[1:49:12] got to disagree with your father no no
[1:49:14] no that's that's not what it means it's
[1:49:16] something that happened supernaturally
[1:49:20] as you as you go together you love one
[1:49:23] another together you you trust one
[1:49:26] another and then there's translations
[1:49:29] start to take place you are moving from
[1:49:31] one Kingdom over to another kingdom
[1:49:37] praise the Lord
[1:49:41] sometimes we think it's automatically
[1:49:43] and then even even on the other side of
[1:49:46] the man you know he's he's uh he said
[1:49:48] well I mean you need to trust me I'm
[1:49:50] your husband I mean
[1:49:52] there is not a button for their science
[1:49:54] have not been able to make one yet
[1:49:56] there's not a remote control for that
[1:50:00] all of these things are under the they
[1:50:02] are under the law that those are the law
[1:50:05] that God puts in the universe
[1:50:10] when a seed is poured into the ground it
[1:50:14] has to die first
[1:50:17] amen it has to die then before it starts
[1:50:21] to grow up
[1:50:25] are we together
[1:50:30] and that is the thing that I I you know
[1:50:33] I'm I I I want us to see I want us to
[1:50:36] realize
[1:50:37] even when it comes to our personal life
[1:50:40] you cannot blame the church brother
[1:50:43] random says God just just need one man
[1:50:45] or one woman in a local church that is
[1:50:50] standing with the word
[1:50:51] amen you can't blame the church and says
[1:50:54] wow that you know that church they are
[1:50:56] not on fire that church is so cold what
[1:50:58] about you
[1:51:00] what's about you
[1:51:02] what's your place
[1:51:08] the effect of our relationship the joy
[1:51:12] of our relationship comes from the place
[1:51:15] where the first husband is dead
[1:51:20] amen
[1:51:21] and where Paul was talking about your uh
[1:51:24] uh you have to dive unto the law it's in
[1:51:28] a place where on our first birth
[1:51:32] praise the Lord
[1:51:34] honor our first birth there is a law
[1:51:37] that we were born on a bonus seat in
[1:51:40] iniquity equate to gravity to what is
[1:51:43] wrong
[1:51:46] that have to die
[1:51:52] glory be to God
[1:51:55] if you are having a a place of struggle
[1:51:59] don't look far don't look far ask
[1:52:01] yourself
[1:52:03] am I fully submitted on my headship to
[1:52:07] Christ
[1:52:10] the Lord
[1:52:11] because he promised to protect us he
[1:52:14] promised to provide for us he promised
[1:52:17] to be there for us he promised that we
[1:52:19] have every right to everything that he
[1:52:22] holds all the heaven Halls belongs to us
[1:52:25] when we come under that Airship of
[1:52:29] Christ
[1:52:31] and just like we struggle in our natural
[1:52:35] relationship we also struggle
[1:52:38] in our spiritual relationship
[1:52:41] that's where Paul was trying to bring
[1:52:44] the Church of Rome
[1:52:47] because you have to remember from from
[1:52:49] from Romans chapter 4 5 he started
[1:52:52] talking about the righteousness of God
[1:52:54] that is revealed from Faith to Faith how
[1:52:58] how can we accept this righteousness of
[1:53:01] God when our mind
[1:53:03] is so filled with with with all the
[1:53:06] things that we have done our mind is so
[1:53:09] filled with our weaknesses in order how
[1:53:12] are we going to accept this
[1:53:13] righteousness that is from faithful we
[1:53:15] have to die to that
[1:53:17] you have to crucify that thought
[1:53:20] that it is no longer either living but
[1:53:22] Christ that lived in me it's it's an
[1:53:26] individual work that you
[1:53:31] you oh yeah because the devil is there
[1:53:33] he knows and he knows exactly he knows
[1:53:35] the punches to troll
[1:53:37] he knows the place to hate you he knows
[1:53:40] how to remind you
[1:53:43] are we together
[1:53:44] the change of hairship
[1:53:46] because as long as you stay on their
[1:53:49] first hair shape you're not going
[1:53:51] anywhere
[1:53:52] you will not get the benefit let's see
[1:53:54] what he says here in birth pains I think
[1:53:56] I have another thing here he says and
[1:53:58] that's the reason that we have never
[1:54:01] become a denomination
[1:54:04] amen
[1:54:05] the Lord have given us the opportunity
[1:54:10] to merge this little church
[1:54:13] in many different denominations
[1:54:16] inter-denomination people from different
[1:54:18] denominations that what he means
[1:54:21] we
[1:54:22] but we don't do it I mean let me go back
[1:54:25] there let me take that back again let me
[1:54:27] take that back
[1:54:30] and that's the reason that we have never
[1:54:33] become a denomination
[1:54:35] the Lord has given us the opportunity to
[1:54:38] to merge this church in many different
[1:54:41] denominations he could have joined with
[1:54:43] different denomination okay I think
[1:54:45] that's the sense there but we don't do
[1:54:48] it because we want to stay just like
[1:54:52] this
[1:54:53] amen
[1:54:55] so it can be under the rulership and the
[1:55:00] hairship of Jesus Christ
[1:55:03] the Lord amen we would like to stay just
[1:55:07] like this just like what how
[1:55:10] we would like to stay with the word
[1:55:14] amen I will go your father and it says
[1:55:17] we would like to stay just like this not
[1:55:19] like the way we are doing things because
[1:55:21] many things that we are doing is not
[1:55:23] right
[1:55:26] it's not right
[1:55:30] we formulate our own church time
[1:55:35] we don't come to church on time
[1:55:39] we have to we just we're just taking it
[1:55:41] down as you know as a habit you know we
[1:55:43] formulate our own church time
[1:55:50] so it is not in a sense we would like it
[1:55:52] to be just like the No No we want to go
[1:55:54] from glory to glory we would like it to
[1:55:57] be a church that will stay with the word
[1:56:04] so it can be on the rulership and the
[1:56:08] hardship of Jesus Christ that's right
[1:56:11] whatever he revealed to us and we see
[1:56:16] that is the truth and it's line of wave
[1:56:20] his word
[1:56:21] all the way back and forth Through the
[1:56:24] Bible
[1:56:25] it is not because Cloverdale Believe it
[1:56:28] or do it so we must do it no it is not
[1:56:31] because this we must be able to bring it
[1:56:32] back to the world
[1:56:35] praise the Lord
[1:56:37] amen so if you go to a place and it
[1:56:40] looks like the way they approach things
[1:56:42] is different don't say they're in charge
[1:56:48] if you want to learn ask them why you do
[1:56:51] this
[1:56:54] praise the Lord
[1:56:57] why you do this
[1:57:06] because I mean we have we have rare
[1:57:08] church order now we get it on our belt
[1:57:12] okay we we get a blue belt of church
[1:57:15] order so everywhere we go we just sit
[1:57:17] down we look over our shoulders it's not
[1:57:19] a message
[1:57:27] praise the Lord
[1:57:35] and people do things different way and
[1:57:37] and sometimes you appreciate I mean down
[1:57:39] there in in Tennessee this weekend what
[1:57:42] I realized is that they have a room that
[1:57:45] is that is a prayer room
[1:57:47] and uh uh if you follow the church all
[1:57:50] the brother Branham says is give the
[1:57:52] people that you meet
[1:57:54] and pray together maybe God will break a
[1:57:56] gift for tongues but what they do is
[1:57:57] they have to go in their room and have
[1:58:00] their prayer meeting
[1:58:03] every service the meat in that room have
[1:58:06] a prayer meeting
[1:58:08] and they're right from the prayer
[1:58:09] meeting they go right into the service
[1:58:10] and then the service starts
[1:58:14] well the Lord is Blessing to wash you I
[1:58:17] change it
[1:58:18] why should I come and take a message and
[1:58:20] Lana quotes and said you're not doing it
[1:58:22] the way brother brand name is brother
[1:58:23] Brandon I said that you do it the Lord
[1:58:25] is Blessing it
[1:58:28] why because it's keeping the people oh
[1:58:30] oh yeah I mean we must have a time of
[1:58:32] meditation at the time of meditation The
[1:58:35] Message Church is the time to clean
[1:58:36] nails
[1:58:38] is it time that people use to clean
[1:58:40] their nails
[1:58:43] or they use that time to think and some
[1:58:45] will sit right there on their phone
[1:58:46] there on Facebook and all of that so
[1:58:49] what is the benefit of that
[1:58:54] are you seeing what I'm saying
[1:58:56] as long as it is lining up with the word
[1:59:03] praise the Lord
[1:59:06] as long as I said it's lining up with
[1:59:08] the word as a church we choose to play
[1:59:10] tips every every day a Sunday morning to
[1:59:14] me I think we create something to help
[1:59:17] your meditation if you are listening
[1:59:20] if you come to church on time and you
[1:59:23] are listening to the tip at least it
[1:59:25] will help your meditation something will
[1:59:27] be said you will say well let me go back
[1:59:29] to that message again instead it
[1:59:35] are we together
[1:59:40] because the thing that takes the most
[1:59:42] privilege
[1:59:43] in the church is the word nothing is
[1:59:46] above the word
[1:59:48] nothing is above the word the music
[1:59:50] don't take the most privilege it's the
[1:59:52] word that takes the most privilege is
[1:59:54] because of the word that we are here
[1:59:58] we must be able to line up our arts and
[2:00:00] action with the word
[2:00:02] our emotion must not go above the world
[2:00:05] you find a bunch of people that are they
[2:00:07] are so emotional and all of that is you
[2:00:09] can't even see the word
[2:00:13] because just like the scripture says the
[2:00:17] prophet said and I say it again is only
[2:00:20] the world will produce itself
[2:00:23] that is the Original Seed of God is the
[2:00:26] only thing that has the power to
[2:00:29] reproduce Christ in you
[2:00:31] it's not my shouting
[2:00:33] it's not me coming up with a new method
[2:00:35] and says well let's run around the
[2:00:37] building
[2:00:40] let's do a cook out every Saturday maybe
[2:00:43] God will give us new members
[2:00:46] praise the Lord if we don't keep a right
[2:00:49] atmosphere that is back up with a good
[2:00:52] life God can trust us with people it's
[2:00:55] God finding places where he can trust
[2:00:57] people that are the people that are in
[2:01:00] need
[2:01:01] it's not just making members just to
[2:01:04] count the numbers
[2:01:12] praise the Lord
[2:01:19] are we together
[2:01:23] the Lord
[2:01:25] he says Sierra
[2:01:28] because we want to stay just like this
[2:01:30] so it can be under the rulership and the
[2:01:34] hairship of Jesus Christ that's right
[2:01:36] whatever he revealed to us and we see it
[2:01:41] we see that is the truth and a line of
[2:01:44] with the word all the way back and forth
[2:01:48] Through the Bible
[2:01:50] praise the Lord
[2:01:55] that is wrong all the way back and forth
[2:01:58] Through the Bible
[2:02:01] we're playing the message uh uh uh uh uh
[2:02:04] president of
[2:02:05] Porter prisoner
[2:02:09] I think I said that here a couple of
[2:02:11] nights ago about uh what we do on
[2:02:13] Wednesday night with our prayer meeting
[2:02:15] and and I I just listening to that again
[2:02:18] and uh and I see brother Brown saying he
[2:02:20] says this is Wednesday night we just
[2:02:22] come together it's just our way of
[2:02:23] having a a prayer meeting
[2:02:27] we just we just come together and just
[2:02:29] have a short prayer meeting
[2:02:36] are we together
[2:02:44] Lana was the word all the way back and
[2:02:46] forth Through the Bible that it is the
[2:02:48] truth and the spirit is agreeing on it
[2:02:51] we have no denomination of Barra to to
[2:02:54] hold us from accepting that we go right
[2:02:58] ahead into it and move right on
[2:03:01] praise the lord we don't have to make
[2:03:04] report to Jeffersonville we don't have
[2:03:06] to make report to uh uh DC or New York
[2:03:09] nor we may report to heaven
[2:03:14] that's our headquarter
[2:03:20] praise the Lord
[2:03:22] if you are if you are a Bible believer
[2:03:24] if you love the Lord you are in the word
[2:03:27] if there is something to to question
[2:03:29] about make sure that you are you is
[2:03:31] something on the word
[2:03:33] bring the question says the Bible says
[2:03:35] this why are we not doing it
[2:03:38] all we are doing this and the word says
[2:03:41] this
[2:03:43] I mean it's now only for this church but
[2:03:45] anywhere you go if you are if you are a
[2:03:48] loving believer you go you meet people
[2:03:51] worshiping respect them for what they
[2:03:54] believe and how they stand that's how
[2:03:56] they've been going before you got there
[2:04:04] you find people that are just flipping
[2:04:06] around the country around the world they
[2:04:08] can never have a place to rest because
[2:04:10] there is just no group that is good for
[2:04:12] them
[2:04:14] and they can't even start one of their
[2:04:16] own
[2:04:19] it's a bad place to be
[2:04:24] it's a bad place to be
[2:04:26] to be to the place where you are not on
[2:04:29] a hair ship
[2:04:33] you can never be led by the Holy Spirit
[2:04:35] if you are not properly on the headship
[2:04:42] praise the Lord
[2:04:43] a person will have a place where they
[2:04:46] can call home
[2:04:47] where they can call Church
[2:04:51] a place where they are accountable to
[2:04:55] praise the Lord
[2:05:00] I'm accountable to you
[2:05:04] amen
[2:05:08] if you if you hear anything about me
[2:05:10] don't don't be ashamed to come and tell
[2:05:12] me
[2:05:16] that's what it's about
[2:05:23] praise the Lord
[2:05:25] don't worry I just have one more cut
[2:05:26] here and then I will I will close this
[2:05:29] thing up
[2:05:30] but that's that's that's what that's
[2:05:32] what I want I want us to see it you see
[2:05:35] that's the reason why the people the
[2:05:38] Broadband said they are not getting to
[2:05:39] Christ the people are not getting to
[2:05:42] Christ the people are not enjoying the
[2:05:45] benefit of the word
[2:05:47] amen there is still healing in the word
[2:05:50] there is still gifts in the word there
[2:05:53] is still Deliverance in the word praise
[2:05:56] the Lord
[2:05:59] the joy of the Lord is our strength
[2:06:07] no matter what we are going through God
[2:06:10] can still bring us a portion of
[2:06:12] satisfaction
[2:06:15] praise the Lord
[2:06:16] when when when boas was down there they
[2:06:19] had he identified Ruth uh because of her
[2:06:22] her working and and her faithfulness I
[2:06:27] mean Ruth was there on time and make
[2:06:29] sure that the whip Reapers will finish
[2:06:31] and she will get to gleaning and and
[2:06:33] he's he told them he says just drop a
[2:06:36] ballot for a year and drop a ballot for
[2:06:38] there God is still dropping ballot for
[2:06:41] his children
[2:06:46] we don't have to manufacture it
[2:06:49] there is a law that bring these things
[2:06:51] to pass
[2:06:53] we don't have to start another
[2:06:55] Pentecostal movement
[2:07:02] let's do a seven day fast let's do a
[2:07:04] 12-day fast let's do it I mean uh I mean
[2:07:07] if it's not a bad thing too fast if we
[2:07:10] want to
[2:07:11] praise the Lord
[2:07:13] but we must not carry the church on a
[2:07:15] hunger strike because we want some kind
[2:07:16] of a manifestation
[2:07:24] if there is a need to do it we'll let
[2:07:26] you know what a need is but it's not to
[2:07:29] manufacture something
[2:07:31] praise the Lord
[2:07:35] as it's right here
[2:07:37] I've seen the waves that have come in
[2:07:41] and gone out of this church
[2:07:43] I've seen the places where God
[2:07:46] starts to bless us when the People
[2:07:49] starts to do what is right
[2:07:52] praise the Lord
[2:07:54] amen
[2:07:56] the way churches struggled to come back
[2:07:59] from the pandemic we never did that
[2:08:02] as a local church we never did that
[2:08:06] because even though there was shut down
[2:08:09] God was able to bless us with an
[2:08:12] atmosphere where we have service we have
[2:08:14] fellowship and we kept the atmosphere
[2:08:16] until the anxiousness of getting back to
[2:08:19] church was there
[2:08:22] praise the Lord
[2:08:25] but then what started happening we start
[2:08:27] we start slacking off and we start doing
[2:08:29] different things we start measuring on
[2:08:31] the mountains instead of sustaining that
[2:08:34] atmosphere
[2:08:36] praise the Lord
[2:08:38] now you see it as as a preacher like I'm
[2:08:41] not an evangelist so I'm not built that
[2:08:43] way
[2:08:45] I'm not built that way the way I'm built
[2:08:48] is to constantly wave this world before
[2:08:50] you say look this is what the world said
[2:08:52] let's do it
[2:08:53] and when we do it we will get the result
[2:08:57] that's the way I'm built I'm not built
[2:08:59] to come and start whipping you people
[2:09:01] are backslotting people I'm not built
[2:09:04] that way if a person preached that way
[2:09:06] it's not wrong if they are built that
[2:09:08] way
[2:09:11] praise the Lord
[2:09:13] I want the world to grab your attention
[2:09:16] I want you to the world to grab your
[2:09:19] mind you bring it back to yourself and
[2:09:21] says yeah you know in this place I'm not
[2:09:23] fully submitting to Christ I need to
[2:09:25] submit to Christ in in in you know in my
[2:09:28] home or in my finances I'm not
[2:09:31] submitting to Christ I meet up because
[2:09:33] there is no way out of it God can bless
[2:09:35] you out of his Lord
[2:09:41] he can bless you out of his Lord
[2:09:49] praise the Lord
[2:09:53] if the power of God
[2:09:58] will move in this place
[2:10:01] God will have to have people that are
[2:10:04] paying attention to what he's doing
[2:10:10] praise the Lord
[2:10:17] that's what I want you to see Christ is
[2:10:19] the mystery of God revealed this will be
[2:10:21] my last one
[2:10:22] foreign
[2:10:27] I don't know yet
[2:10:30] God living among his people doing the
[2:10:33] same thing
[2:10:35] then you can recognize
[2:10:38] the hair shape in Rome our hairship is
[2:10:41] in heaven
[2:10:44] I'm not going to Rome I'm going to
[2:10:46] heaven when I die
[2:10:47] see the hair ship is in heaven
[2:10:52] and where is heaven heaven is consists
[2:10:55] of the word
[2:10:57] Heaven is consist of the word
[2:11:04] not the galaxies of the word
[2:11:09] fulsive brand says Heaven is consists of
[2:11:12] the word
[2:11:17] so what what is that our hairship
[2:11:20] bringing ourselves in subjection toward
[2:11:23] the word everything we are doing we must
[2:11:25] consider what the word says about it
[2:11:29] now how I feel about it or what I think
[2:11:31] about it what the word says about it
[2:11:34] cannot can I fit this thing in the word
[2:11:38] can I fit this thing in the word
[2:11:47] because just like Paul says uh uh uh uh
[2:11:50] uh uh you know a woman
[2:11:55] there has to be a change of hair shape
[2:11:59] and I'm telling you that's where the
[2:12:01] bride is getting told
[2:12:02] people that are dropping off the message
[2:12:04] here is all because they are struggling
[2:12:06] with the word
[2:12:08] they are struggling with the word
[2:12:14] the pressure of this word is just is
[2:12:16] just it's pressing people in so much
[2:12:18] that they are struggling with the word I
[2:12:21] heard a beautiful story of lots of of
[2:12:23] Max Lucado this morning as I was
[2:12:26] meditating
[2:12:29] and this story was all about uh uh uh uh
[2:12:33] a father that will always have a dance
[2:12:36] with his daughter
[2:12:40] on Christmas Eve
[2:12:43] no not his daughter sorry his wife
[2:12:45] you always have a dance with his wife on
[2:12:48] Christmas Eve
[2:12:50] and and why they would do that then says
[2:12:53] his his little girl will be looking at
[2:12:56] him
[2:12:57] praise the Lord
[2:12:59] and I could just imagine as I was
[2:13:01] listening to that how she goes in the
[2:13:03] room and and she's practicing all the
[2:13:06] steps and everything
[2:13:09] praise the Lord and and mama was not
[2:13:11] around
[2:13:12] and and the little girl came to to Daddy
[2:13:15] and says and Christmas Eve he says he
[2:13:17] says Daddy
[2:13:19] can I dance with you
[2:13:21] he said oh sure it surprised him though
[2:13:25] praise the Lord but he said show and and
[2:13:28] then when he when he started when he
[2:13:30] started dancing with his little girl he
[2:13:32] realized oh my God oh my God
[2:13:35] she got all the steps
[2:13:38] praise the Lord
[2:13:40] but you see what happened afterwards the
[2:13:43] other uh that little girl uh seen her
[2:13:46] parents dancing she will block herself
[2:13:48] in the room and dance and dancing and
[2:13:51] and I mean she was just she was kind of
[2:13:53] overcome with dance
[2:13:55] until when she grew up
[2:13:58] she started slipping away from the house
[2:14:01] and started going for dance party
[2:14:04] before she realized the wrong Spirit got
[2:14:07] her she started becoming a club dancer
[2:14:10] and she went away from home
[2:14:13] so Daddy will write
[2:14:15] a letter and sent it to her
[2:14:19] and because
[2:14:22] of the guilt that she was feeling
[2:14:27] that I learned this thing this thing was
[2:14:30] was special to my daddy because that's
[2:14:32] what Mama did to him
[2:14:35] now that Mama has gone
[2:14:38] want to be with the Lord also
[2:14:41] how breaking daddy heart is you know
[2:14:44] when and and but she she you know she
[2:14:47] she felt so guilty that she she would
[2:14:49] not even look in the word she would not
[2:14:50] even read the message
[2:14:52] she would not read a letter she just
[2:14:53] stacked them up and stacked them up and
[2:14:55] stacked them up
[2:14:57] in one bed she received a letter from
[2:15:00] her dad
[2:15:03] and this time there was no
[2:15:05] there was no postal stamp on the
[2:15:08] envelope
[2:15:11] she just saw on the message on the
[2:15:13] envelope from your dad with no poster
[2:15:15] stem she knew exactly
[2:15:17] that Daddy was in town
[2:15:21] so she opened the letter
[2:15:23] and when she read it daddy says
[2:15:27] I know where you are
[2:15:30] I know what you are doing
[2:15:34] but can you come home
[2:15:37] oh no he says I've sent you series of
[2:15:40] letters with no response but my message
[2:15:44] is still the same
[2:15:46] can you come home and dance with Daddy
[2:15:51] praise the Lord
[2:15:53] as soon as she read that she felt a
[2:15:57] conviction to go back and read the rest
[2:16:00] of the messages that she was talking
[2:16:02] you see then and then as I was listening
[2:16:05] to that I I I I feel like it's it's the
[2:16:08] same
[2:16:12] praise the Lord
[2:16:13] he have he have sent us messages we have
[2:16:16] we have uh we have we have the word
[2:16:18] translated in different form
[2:16:23] we have all thousand messages that was
[2:16:25] preached by a prophet a Vindicated
[2:16:28] prophet
[2:16:31] amen
[2:16:34] you see that the thing about it there is
[2:16:36] that uh uh uh maybe if brother Branham
[2:16:39] was alive it would looks like brother
[2:16:41] Branham it's it's the one that we have
[2:16:43] our hair shaped no it's he's not alive
[2:16:47] and we cannot use a dead man to have our
[2:16:49] Airship our Airship is from Christ
[2:16:55] the Lord
[2:16:59] that is just the order of the scripture
[2:17:00] you go back in the book of Arts you'll
[2:17:02] find there the Bible says Moses was read
[2:17:05] in all the he was read in all the
[2:17:07] synagogues Moses was read
[2:17:10] why because he was their prophet
[2:17:14] amen they knew he was a vedicated
[2:17:17] prophet
[2:17:20] so you see this NAD it's not having a
[2:17:22] dead man as our hair shape no it's
[2:17:25] because everything we read from this
[2:17:27] course we look at it from the scripture
[2:17:30] is in line with the scripture
[2:17:39] and God sent us his word and he deals
[2:17:42] with our heart they are things that we
[2:17:44] are doing there and and it brings
[2:17:46] conviction to our heart we don't want to
[2:17:49] go home and dance with Daddy
[2:17:51] it keeps taking us away from our prayer
[2:17:54] life because we feel guilty
[2:17:57] so we stay away from prayer we feel
[2:18:00] guilty and we stay away from church we
[2:18:02] feel guilty and we found other things to
[2:18:04] occupy ourselves but the message have
[2:18:06] not changed
[2:18:09] the message have not changed come home
[2:18:11] and dance with Daddy
[2:18:15] the message have not changed
[2:18:21] are we together
[2:18:23] let the musicians come forth
[2:18:37] there has to be
[2:18:39] a change of headship
[2:18:42] praise the Lord
[2:18:47] some people are so caught up on their
[2:18:50] own hair shape
[2:18:51] that they cannot move away from it
[2:18:55] they can move away from it
[2:18:58] and what brother Brandon says you are
[2:19:00] you are living in a glad
[2:19:02] you are living in the light of a past
[2:19:05] day
[2:19:25] daddy message shall not change
[2:19:28] no matter what we are dealing with no
[2:19:31] matter what we are struggling with no
[2:19:33] matter where our battle is
[2:19:36] I believe that is the thing that must
[2:19:39] push us to the word
[2:19:41] if you really believe in the word you
[2:19:43] believe the power that is in the word
[2:19:45] you believe that that Deliverance is in
[2:19:49] his presence
[2:19:51] no matter how what whatever the devil
[2:19:54] throw in our way that is the thing that
[2:19:56] must make us to run in in the Old
[2:19:58] Testament they were wrong to the City of
[2:20:00] Refuge they will not run away from it
[2:20:05] they were wrong to the center of the
[2:20:06] Refuge and cry for mercy and look for
[2:20:09] help
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:19] the message does not change
[2:20:22] we can say it's those days
[2:20:25] [Music]
[2:20:26] no
[2:20:30] for the prisoner that's the tip that
[2:20:32] I've been playing but Abraham says what
[2:20:34] is happening is there we have lost
[2:20:37] our level of sincerity to the thing that
[2:20:39] we believe
[2:20:41] that's what is happening
[2:20:43] [Music]
[2:20:44] we we are we are learning to give
[2:20:47] ourselves more reason
[2:20:48] [Music]
[2:20:56] we give ourselves a reason why we must
[2:20:58] stay away from church we give ourselves
[2:21:00] a reason why we must not pray oh I'm
[2:21:02] tired or I'm tired you realize you don't
[2:21:05] have a prayer life
[2:21:09] sometimes you have to fight a truth

[2:30:20] the god of Daniel and the boys are
[2:30:24] burning God and all of these guys that
[2:30:25] we read about he's the same God that we
[2:30:28] are we are serving he's the same God in
[2:30:31] our midst this morning
[2:30:33] he's the same God that is bringing his
[2:30:35] word to us
[2:30:45] Lord
[2:30:46] has your devotion has your dedication
[2:30:54] to the Lord
[2:30:56] in your fine eyes
[2:31:11] the Catholic system has taught the
[2:31:13] people to depend on the church no go
[2:31:15] back to the book of Acts the church
[2:31:17] depends on the people
[2:31:19] and the people that make the church how
[2:31:21] it is to support the church
[2:31:33] but you see if if you if we don't have
[2:31:36] that place of commitment
[2:31:39] to God in Fellowship
[2:31:41] you will not be bothered about those
[2:31:43] things
[2:31:48] I mean you don't you you I mean to your
[2:31:52] local church yeah you can support your
[2:31:54] local church with your ties and offering
[2:31:56] that's what the Bible says but even
[2:31:58] beyond that
[2:32:00] you have people that are that are
[2:32:02] involved in little missions here then
[2:32:04] and and they are involved in in
[2:32:07] supporting the little work things that
[2:32:09] do astrally because they have a burden
[2:32:12] on their heart to do something for God
[2:32:15] I know my my I'm I'm supposed to be
[2:32:18] dedicated to my local church
[2:32:20] I pay my tithes and offering but but
[2:32:23] beyond there there are other things that
[2:32:25] I do
[2:32:27] and I do it because of the love of God
[2:32:30] foreign
[2:32:36] of Darkness he has delivered us from the
[2:32:39] kingdom of darkness
[2:32:42] now he has translated us into the
