[9:48] schedule with them until this Friday. So
[9:51] they will be in on Friday and uh they

[10:47] I thought there. We must be able to come
[10:51] up early and just take this time to be
[10:54] able to pray. We want to continue to
[10:56] remember brother Ben. Spoke with him uh
[10:59] uh taking care of some family stuff back
[11:01] home. He should be back soon.
[11:04] and uh sister Katherine and her family
[11:07] uh travel also because her mother-in-law
[11:11] went to be with the Lord. So we want to
[11:13] we want to pray for them. Want to pray
[11:16] for them. Brother Ben Nero uh was in the
[11:19] hospital and uh uh I think he had a
[11:28] a surgery and he's recovering. Uh so we
[11:32] want to just pray that the Lord will
[11:34] grant him a speed of recovery. And uh we
[11:38] also want to remember uh Sister Naomi.
[11:41] She's uh supposed to be back home soon,
[11:46] the people working with her, hoping that
[11:48] she get back home soon. So let's just

[12:03] I have to do next week. So uh uh just uh
[12:07] keep us in prayer that uh the Lord will
[12:11] will be able to go before us and and
[12:14] just give us a wonderful time. We will
[12:17] pray also and remember uh uh brother
[12:21] Ariel. I know he's out tonight uh uh
[12:25] playing music, but uh he's been he's
[12:28] been uh not feeling well and still
[12:31] having uh bleeding from his nose that uh
[12:35] the doctors are trying to still figure
[12:37] out what what that is all about. So, we
[12:40] also want to remember him in prayer
[12:42] tonight. But overall we like I said we
[12:46] want to uh uh continue giving thanks and
[12:50] praise to the Lord for bringing us
[12:53] through an entire year.

[13:08] to the Lord as we uh get close to the
[13:14] end of the year. So let's just bow our
[13:16] heads together. So we will just uh spend
[13:19] a little time in prayer tonight before
[13:22] we can read something out of God's word.
[13:37] I know the master
[13:40] of the way.

[14:01] and make the sun to shine again.

[39:15] read from Psalm chapter 22.
[39:18] We'll read from Psalm chapter 22.
[39:25] Read from Psalm chapter 22. A very
[39:28] familiar Psalm. That's what I wanted to
[39:30] open the service with tonight. But uh we
[39:33] just ask for the Lord to come and just
[39:36] take some few psalms and and then we
[39:39] come right into praying tonight. So I
[39:42] wanted to do that last week. Uh like I
[39:46] said, we were going to have short prayer
[39:48] meetings just before we go into the
[39:50] word. And just before I would come out,
[39:53] my stomach, oh my god, I don't know
[39:55] where that devil came from. My stomach
[39:58] was spinning me so bad last Wednesday.
[40:02] I almost I almost broke up into crying.
[40:04] I was going to ask for Dan. I say, "Hey,
[40:06] you just broke down. Go just pray and
[40:08] and whatever you can do, just pray and
[40:11] encourage the people and uh uh but then
[40:15] uh after he sang the tear song uh I said
[40:20] why we just prayed and go up there and
[40:22] when we came the Lord was able to touch
[40:24] us." Amen. Praise the Lord. I don't know
[40:27] what it was, but we are here. Praise the
[40:30] Lord. We are here tonight. Psalm chapter
[40:32] 22. Let's read. Uh uh my God, my God,
[40:37] why have thou forsaken me?
[40:39] Why art thou so far from helping me? And
[40:43] far from and from the words of my
[40:46] roaming.
[40:48] Why are thou so far from helping me and
[40:51] from the words of my roaming? Oh my God.
[40:54] I cried in the daytime, but thou heareth
[40:58] not, and in the night season,
[41:01] and I'm not silent, but but thou are
[41:06] holy.
[41:08] Oh, thou that inhabited the praises of
[41:10] Israel. Amen. Our fathers trusted in
[41:14] thee. They they trusted and thou did
[41:18] they deliver them. Praise the Lord. And
[41:21] we can trust him, too. and he will
[41:22] deliver us. Amen.
[41:26] They cry unto day
[41:28] and will deliver. So we can cry also and
[41:33] we can be delivered.
[41:36] They trusted in thee and were not
[41:38] confounded. And we can also trust and we
[41:42] will not be confounded. Amen. Praise the
[41:45] Lord. And David goes on here where he
[41:48] goes uh uh but I am a worm and no man a
[41:52] reproach of man and despise of the
[41:55] people. All they that see me laugh me to
[41:57] scone and uh they shoot out their lips.
[42:00] They shake their head. He trusted on the
[42:03] Lord but he that he will deliver him.
[42:06] Let him deliver him. Seeing he delighted
[42:09] in him. Praise the Lord. Now, so you see
[42:12] it if you read Psalm chapter 22, you
[42:15] will see that David is saying pretty
[42:17] much the same thing that Job said about
[42:20] the people around him, how they treated
[42:22] him. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's pray
[42:25] together. Heavenly Father, we just want
[42:27] to thank you tonight, Lord. And we just
[42:29] ask that, Father God, make this evening
[42:31] special for us, oh God. Father, because
[42:34] we don't know when is going to be our
[42:36] last service. So God, father, we want to
[42:39] put our all Lord God that if there is
[42:42] not another one tomorrow, we will know
[42:44] that we have done our best. So we thank
[42:47] you for the strength and the grace that
[42:48] you have given to us. We just pray that
[42:50] you bless us in your presence now. In
[42:53] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord
[42:56] bless you. You may have your seat.
[42:59] Praise the Lord.
[43:01] It's good to be in the house of the
[43:02] Lord. Thank you for coming and uh and
[43:05] also thank you to everyone that is
[43:07] streaming into the service tonight.
[43:09] Praise the Lord. Amen. So tonight we
[43:13] just want to we want to cap off on our
[43:15] our subject that we pick up uh all that
[43:18] my words were written in the book. Oh
[43:22] that my words were written in the book.
[43:25] Praise the Lord.
[43:28] Oh that my words were written in the
[43:30] book. That's Job
[43:32] chapter 19.
[43:34] Let's turn there. Job chapter 19.
[43:48] And once again, I want to I want to
[43:50] labor tonight and see if I can if I can
[43:53] be able to bring out uh
[43:56] uh
[43:58] what what has been the inspiration
[44:00] around that.
[44:03] I know I tried to do that on uh on uh
[44:09] Sunday, but I will try once again. Job
[44:13] chapter
[44:16] Job chapter 19.
[44:19] And just like Psalm 22, we see Job here
[44:24] uh
[44:27] complaining in some way. Let's read from
[44:29] verse 18. Yeah. The young children
[44:31] despise me. I rose up and they shake and
[44:34] and and they speak against me. All my
[44:37] inward friends are hold me and and they
[44:39] whom I love are turned against me. My
[44:42] bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh
[44:46] and I am escape with the skin of my
[44:49] teeth. Have pity upon me. Have pity upon
[44:52] me, oh ye my friends, for the hand of
[44:56] God have touched me.
[45:00] Why do ye persecute me as God and are
[45:04] not satisfied with my flesh? With
[45:06] everything you are seeing, you are not
[45:08] satis you are not satisfied. You are
[45:10] still probing and probing and saying
[45:12] things and guessing is very painful.
[45:15] It's very very painful. Praise the Lord.
[45:19] And yet he broke into this prophecy what
[45:21] we taking as a prophecy. Oh that my
[45:24] words were now written. Oh that they
[45:27] were printed in a book that that they
[45:32] were engraving with an iron pen and laid
[45:37] in the rock. not lay in a rock but lay
[45:40] in their rock. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[45:46] For I know that my redeemer liveth. See,
[45:49] see, see the transition. That's what I
[45:51] want us to see. He comes right here from
[45:53] complaining. The all of these people are
[45:56] treating me LIKE THIS. AND WHY IS THIS
[45:58] HAPPENING? OH, MY FRIENDS, Y'ALL HAVE
[46:00] MERCY ON ME. YOU I MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE
[46:02] BEEN SITTING DOWN HERE SEVEN DAYS
[46:04] looking at me like this. I mean, YOU
[46:06] HAVE NO MERCY. HAVE MERCY ON ME. HE'S
[46:09] SAYING ALL of this. Then he comes to
[46:11] this place like just taking a DEEP
[46:13] BREATH. ALL THAT MY words were written
[46:18] in the book, printed in the book,
[46:20] engraved
[46:23] and laying in the rock. AND AS SOON AS
[46:26] HE SAID THAT, ON THIS SIDE HE STREAM, I
[46:30] KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVE. Praise the Lord.
[46:33] This man that was just complaining just
[46:35] now of pe of being treated. He took this
[46:40] pause.
[46:43] Oh, I wish my words were written. AND
[46:46] THEN ON THIS SIDE, HE'S BREAKING OUT
[46:48] INTO PROPHECY.
[46:51] HALLELUJAH.
[46:53] Oh man, I wish I was a preacher
[46:57] to really bring this to you. FOR I KNOW
[46:59] THAT MY REDEEMER liveth and they and and
[47:02] that he shall stand at the later days
[47:06] upon THE EARTH. AND THOUGH AFTER THE
[47:08] SKIN WOUNDS destroy this body, yet in my
[47:12] flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see
[47:15] for myself, and my eyes shall behold not
[47:18] another, though my reigns my my my
[47:22] reigns eye be consumed within me, but ye
[47:26] shall say, why persecute we him? Are we
[47:30] together?
[47:32] So, he's coming from out of trials
[47:36] right into prophecy.
[47:39] Praise the Lord. Amen. And that is the
[47:43] same thing with all of God's children,
[47:45] as you will see a little bit tonight,
[47:47] with all of God's children.
[47:50] Amen. Let's let's let's just take uh uh
[47:54] uh
[47:56] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[47:57] tonight. We we just want to read a few
[47:59] things to you and just cap this whole
[48:01] thing up so uh it can it can kind of
[48:03] make sense. You will see where where
[48:05] we've been coming from with this talk.
[48:07] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[48:08] See what brother Brandham says. All
[48:11] those things type Christ.
[48:13] All the things that was in the Old
[48:16] Testament character type Christ. Just
[48:20] like it was Christ IN DAVID SAYING MY
[48:23] GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE THOU FORSAKEN ME?
[48:26] IT WAS CHRIST THAT WAS IN JOB SAYING ALL
[48:29] THAT MY WORDS WERE WRITTEN IN A BOOK.
[48:32] All those things type Christ.
[48:36] Praise the Lord. Amen. All those things
[48:39] tied him just a type. But but yet the
[48:44] mystery was hate. There was a mystery
[48:47] behind it. How can he come from
[48:51] seeing how people are treating him? even
[48:54] the children the words that they were
[48:56] using on him
[48:59] and then he will come right here
[49:03] breaking out into prophecy. I know my
[49:05] redeemer living. NOW WHAT WHAT I WANT TO
[49:08] ASK YOU IS THAT WHERE DID HE get the
[49:10] strength from
[49:12] TO COME FROM A PLACE OF BEING despised
[49:16] to come from A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE
[49:18] using hurtful words on you
[49:23] AND THEN TO TURN RIGHT HERE AND SAYS I
[49:26] KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVE. Where did he get
[49:28] the strength from?
[49:33] Praise the Lord.
[49:37] Amen.
[49:42] It was easy when the farm burned, when
[49:45] the children died,
[49:49] it was easy for Job TO SAY, "MAKE IT, I
[49:51] CAME, make it, I will return."
[49:55] BUT THE NEXT TIME when the devil came
[49:59] before the Lord, HE TOLD THE LORD SKIN
[50:01] FOR SKIN, let me touch him.
[50:04] DESTROYING EVERYTHING AROUND YOU, YOU
[50:06] CAN GET a a breath of fresh air, but let
[50:09] me touch him.
[50:13] Praise the Lord. Amen. LET THIS THING
[50:16] BECOME REAL WORD. uh uh uh uh I mean we
[50:20] go through different things but
[50:22] sometimes the most painful thing when
[50:25] you find yourself to to a place where
[50:28] you can't identify your strength
[50:32] knowing who you are KNOWING WHAT YOU
[50:34] COULD DO in certain situation and then
[50:37] you find yourself doing the contrary
[50:40] are we together amen so brother Brandham
[50:44] says
[50:46] all those things type name just a type.
[50:49] But yet the mystery was hid. Them men
[50:53] didn't know what they were doing.
[50:56] They did not know what they were doing.
[51:00] THEY WERE LIVING THEIR NATURAL LIFE.
[51:02] THINGS WAS HAPPENING TO THEM. BUT THEY
[51:05] DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WERE writing
[51:07] prophecy.
[51:09] THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE
[51:10] PROPHESYING.
[51:12] Are we together?
[51:14] &gt;&gt; They didn't know what they were doing.
[51:16] They only knew that they were led by the
[51:19] spirit to do some now holding it back in
[51:25] the last days for the great revelation.
[51:29] You know, God God kept it for us to
[51:32] understand it.
[51:35] That's the reason why
[51:38] we should complain but not too much
[51:42] because we have examples.
[51:45] Amen.
[51:46] We should cry but not too loud.
[51:50] If I said don't cry, I will be that
[51:51] would not be fair. But I would say cry
[51:54] but not too loud.
[51:57] Complain but don't be too wide.
[52:00] Amen.
[52:02] When you want complain, just go in the
[52:04] corner and complain. Don't do every word
[52:08] because you get you get bunch of
[52:09] examples.
[52:12] JOB NEVER HAD A BIBLE TO READ.
[52:15] HE NEVER HAD AN EXAMPLE,
[52:20] but we have an example. So, brother
[52:22] Brandham, IT SAYS GOD KEPT IT for this
[52:25] last day to reveal the mystery that were
[52:29] behind their lives.
[52:34] Are we together
[52:40] now? holding the back in the last for
[52:42] the great revelation but expressing it
[52:45] express himself in Moses in David in
[52:48] Joseph in Elijah we can say tonight in
[52:52] Job we can say in Sarah we can say in
[52:56] Ruth
[52:58] we can say in Naomi
[53:01] HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF BUT THEY DID NOT
[53:03] KNOW THAT THEY WERE AN EXPRESSION OF
[53:05] Christ
[53:07] are we together
[53:09] &gt;&gt; but we more
[53:13] he kept it for us expressing himself in
[53:16] Moses, David, Joseph, Elijah, and on
[53:19] down. We could take each one of those
[53:22] prophets and bring their life out and
[53:25] show and show it express Jesus Christ
[53:28] perfectly.
[53:30] So that's what I want us to see that Job
[53:34] is expressing Christ WHEN HE SAID ALL
[53:37] THAT MY words will be written in a book.
[53:44] Are we together? Amen. And like I was
[53:47] saying on Sunday, IT WAS NOT A LITERAL
[53:50] BOOK.
[53:54] GOD FOUND A MAN CALLED JOB THAT HE COULD
[53:58] WRITE HIS WORD, in his book, in his
[54:01] life.
[54:09] And every one of us, THE REASON WHY GOD
[54:13] PREDESTINATED US FOR THIS AGE IS FOR HIS
[54:16] WORD TO BE WRITTEN in our book.
[54:20] Amen.
[54:22] in our book.
[54:24] That's what I want us to see tonight.
[54:28] We take all of those prophets and bring
[54:30] their life out. Show it express Christ
[54:32] perfectly. Exactly.
[54:35] Never giving his secret in full.
[54:39] He never told them the secret. He never
[54:41] gave it to them before. Amen.
[54:44] Waiting
[54:46] for to make it known in the last days as
[54:50] he has promised. waiting for it to be
[54:53] fully
[54:54] comprehended.
[54:57] See,
[54:59] before he could express it, if he told
[55:02] the whole thing,
[55:04] are we together?
[55:06] So all of those Old Testament, but but
[55:09] it was all about Christ, but he healed
[55:12] himself.
[55:14] They thought they were going through
[55:16] their problem. They thought they were
[55:18] going through and that is the same thing
[55:20] that we ourself don't leave God out of
[55:23] your problem. Amen. You have to know
[55:26] that he said I will be with you. I WILL
[55:29] NEVER leave you. There is nothing in the
[55:31] word that say if you get sick I will
[55:33] leave you.
[55:35] Praise the Lord. He never SAID I WILL BE
[55:37] WITH YOU UNTIL YOU FALL THEN I WILL
[55:39] LEAVE YOU.
[55:41] I will BE WITH YOU UNTIL YOU I MEAN UH
[55:44] UH YOU YOU GET TRIAL THEN I WILL LEAVE
[55:46] YOU. HE NEVER SAID THAT.
[55:49] He says, "I will BE WITH YOU EVEN UNTO
[55:51] THE END."
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:57] So when WHEN WHEN TRIALS AND TROUBLE
[55:59] COME, THE FIRST PERSON WE HAVE TO BE
[56:01] LOOKING FOR IS WHERE IS HE?
[56:04] BECAUSE I KNOW HE'S SOMEWHERE AROUND
[56:06] HERE.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE THE ENEMY OVERWHELM US. WE
[56:10] GET SO WHY ME? OH, SEE EVERYBODY. AND
[56:13] THEN YOU ARE NOT EVEN SEEING THE ONE
[56:15] THAT IS THERE. He's he's HE'S TRYING TO
[56:18] CALL YOUR ATTENTION.
[56:21] GET YOURSELF QUICKLY.
[56:23] This is not this is not a public show
[56:26] for you to get in the STREET AND BE
[56:27] COMPLAINING AND YELLING. LET EVERYBODY
[56:29] KNOW YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT GET
[56:31] TROUBLE. People get worse trouble than
[56:34] you.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[56:40] Look that this this is the thing that is
[56:43] making the message sweet.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; This revelation to know that Christ the
[56:49] same yesterday, today and forever. HE'S
[56:52] WITH US IN OUR WEAKNESS, IN OUR TROUBLE.
[56:56] IT MAKES THE WORD PUT ON FLESH.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT THING BECOME REAL TO YOU,
[57:03] THAT'S WHEN THE WORD IS MADE FLESH.
[57:10] when you can go be going through thing
[57:12] and you can't understand it but you know
[57:14] that he said he will never leave me he
[57:16] will never forsake ME
[57:18] &gt;&gt; SO I KNOW I'M COMING OUT OF this
[57:21] &gt;&gt; no matter how how it turned I know I'm
[57:23] coming out Satan I know I'm coming out
[57:27] you are a liar
[57:30] oh man it makes the word sweet but when
[57:33] you are just complaining and just uh you
[57:36] know uh uh you know I mean it just it
[57:40] make faith a sour thing. faith becomes
[57:43] so sour.
[57:46] Labra says the birds will say what kind
[57:49] of god those people are serving
[57:52] the those human beings they complain too
[57:53] much. The birds THEY DON'T THEY DON'T
[57:56] FARM THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING. THEY WAKE
[57:57] UP in the morning they just start
[57:58] SINGING SONGS PRAISING GODICK quick and
[58:02] then they look down upon us say oh look
[58:04] at those humans. I wonder is the god
[58:06] that make us that make them.
[58:10] They are too sad.
[58:13] You love the Lord. Let's go a little bit
[58:16] further now. See what he says here.
[58:18] Victory day. Look at Job
[58:21] when he was fighting so hard.
[58:24] Even his wife, his companion said,
[58:28] praise the Lord, his wife, his companion
[58:32] said,
[58:34] even her birth was has become strange to
[58:39] me. Now his birth has become strange to
[58:41] her. Amen. So forth.
[58:44] What a time that man had that man had
[58:50] the temptation.
[58:53] Belad and all the rest of them. Elohoo
[58:55] even tried to accuse him and things like
[58:58] that. But he know
[59:01] he did stay with the word.
[59:04] Amen. One thing Job would say over and
[59:07] over, his int his integrity.
[59:11] He was not willing to drag it in the in
[59:13] THE DUST. NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY, WHAT I
[59:16] BECOME,
[59:18] praise the Lord.
[59:20] What I become is a strong think.
[59:24] It's a very very strong thing.
[59:28] This these were Job church members.
[59:31] THESE WERE PEOPLE THAT JOB taught the
[59:34] word of God TO THESE CHILDREN THAT WERE
[59:37] DESPISING. YOU READ IN THE BIBLE, THE
[59:39] BIBLE SAYS HE WENT IN THE MARKETPLACES
[59:42] and people would stop him and say, "Job,
[59:44] I have a problem. Please give me an
[59:46] advice.
[59:47] All the children will come running
[59:49] around him." But now these very
[59:51] children, their parents has been talking
[59:53] in the house. Why? Well, why? You know
[59:55] what? He went out of the word of God and
[59:57] I mean they've been talking. So now the
[59:59] children believe their parents, the
[1:00:01] attitude of the children is the thoughts
[1:00:04] of the parents.
[1:00:07] Are we together?
[1:00:13] Brother Bram said he was fighting so
[1:00:14] hard. See what he says here. He says
[1:00:17] even his wife and his wife come and
[1:00:19] said, "Job,
[1:00:21] you look too miserable, sir. Why don't
[1:00:23] you just curse God and die?" He says,
[1:00:26] "Thou speakest like a foolish woman." OH
[1:00:28] MY, WHAT A HERO.
[1:00:31] Praise the Lord. He was not looking like
[1:00:33] our heroes today. Amen. He was NOT
[1:00:37] LOOKING LIKE BROTHER SAYS WHAT A HERO. A
[1:00:40] PERSON IS AN HERO WHEN you can hold to
[1:00:43] your faith in the face of death.
[1:00:47] Not when YOU GET HEALED, YOU are a hero.
[1:00:50] It's when you are in pain AND YOU ARE
[1:00:52] DYING AND YOU STILL HOLD TO YOUR FAITH.
[1:00:56] That's the hero.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:03] Oh, what a hero. He said
[1:01:06] even Jesus referred to him have have not
[1:01:11] yet heard the patient of Job.
[1:01:14] He said Job went down in the highness.
[1:01:18] Means he went down fighting.
[1:01:23] He went down fighting.
[1:01:25] MY ESCAPE WILL NOT BE THE escape of the
[1:01:29] skin of my teeth.
[1:01:31] I will fight. I will die fighting.
[1:01:35] AMEN. I WILL DIE WITH MY FIGHTING BOOTS
[1:01:38] ON MY FEET. I'm not going to take off my
[1:01:41] bullets and lay my shield down and put
[1:01:43] everything down and just lay down and
[1:01:45] say, "Death come and take me." No, he
[1:01:47] went down in the hardness.
[1:01:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:53] He said, "Abraham went down in the
[1:01:55] hardness." Yes. Isaac went down. Joseph
[1:01:58] went down. Don't bury me down here. Bury
[1:02:02] me up here. Bury me up here with my
[1:02:06] fathers. Bury me in the way they were
[1:02:09] buried. The word. Amen. The plan they
[1:02:15] were buried in, the place where they
[1:02:16] were buried. That is the same thing with
[1:02:19] me. Now he's showing that all OF THESE
[1:02:21] MEN, ALL OF THESE MEN NOT UNDERSTANDING
[1:02:24] EVERYTHING THAT WAS HAPPENING TO THEM,
[1:02:26] THE LITTLE THAT THEY HAD, THE LITTLE
[1:02:29] THING THAT WAS REAL to them, they heard
[1:02:32] it even on their dying bed.
[1:02:37] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:02:40] ABRAHAM COMES AND HE COMPLAINING.
[1:02:43] GENESIS CHAPTER 15, OH GOD, I'M GETTING
[1:02:45] OLD. YEAH, ELIZA, YEAH, HE CAN BE MY
[1:02:48] SON. God said, "Forget about it."
[1:02:49] Abraham, not Eliza. I say your son. You
[1:02:53] will have a son with Sarah.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. EVERY TIME HE WAS
[1:02:59] GETTING WEAK, GOD COMES IN AND COMFORT
[1:03:02] HIM. And the COMFORT OF THE LORD IS OUR
[1:03:05] STRENGTH. AMEN.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; So all of God's people,
[1:03:14] they go down in the hardness.
[1:03:18] They go down hole in their faith
[1:03:20] fighting. THEY JUST DON'T SURRENDER.
[1:03:24] Are we to get Are we together? Amen.
[1:03:36] Hallelujah.
[1:03:37] Listen to what he will say also here in
[1:03:39] spiritual adoption. And here a point
[1:03:43] that I want to drive home. Now this the
[1:03:45] this was all my quotes that I got mixed
[1:03:47] up on Sunday. So I just thought to read
[1:03:50] them to you tonight and then we prayed
[1:03:51] and go home. This is my my point. Uh he
[1:03:55] said here I want to drive home. May the
[1:03:57] Holy Spirit take it to every heart of
[1:03:59] you believers. Just because you are a
[1:04:02] believer certainly you you you have
[1:04:04] everlasting life. Amen.
[1:04:08] God says so. But will you want to will
[1:04:12] you want to just get in as Job said by
[1:04:16] the skin of your teeth?
[1:04:19] You have certainly you have everlasting
[1:04:21] life. Certainly you are safe. But the
[1:04:23] thing about it there is that it does not
[1:04:26] exclude you from fighting. THERE WILL
[1:04:29] ALWAYS be a situation that will rise up
[1:04:32] for you to fight.
[1:04:36] THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING THAT WILL
[1:04:38] RISE UP CHALLENGING IN YOUR IN YOUR
[1:04:40] MIND, CHALLENGING IN YOUR FAITH,
[1:04:43] challenging in your family for you to
[1:04:45] rise up and fight
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; because we are not in a picnic.
[1:04:51] We are in on a battlefield. Amen. Praise
[1:04:54] the Lord. We just don't rise up and eat
[1:04:57] and play. No, we are on the battlefield.
[1:05:01] So he says uh will you just want to you
[1:05:03] just want to get in as Job said by the
[1:05:06] skin of your teeth. Will you just want
[1:05:08] to come before God come before the
[1:05:10] father and the talent that he gave gave
[1:05:13] every one of you as being negligent and
[1:05:17] you just didn't use it or you let
[1:05:22] something else stand in your way.
[1:05:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:29] Are we together?
[1:05:32] Because somebody's challenged you and
[1:05:34] you don't have the answer. So you just
[1:05:36] BACK DOWN AND YOU START DISBELIEVING
[1:05:38] YOURSELF. YOU START DISBELIEVING the
[1:05:40] word. Is that how you want to get in
[1:05:43] just by the mercy of God?
[1:05:49] Are we together?
[1:05:53] Neglect. He says the talent that God
[1:05:55] gave you and use it or let something
[1:05:58] else stand in the way. You let you let
[1:06:01] little petty things that means nothing
[1:06:04] to you.
[1:06:06] After all little fusses and strolls and
[1:06:09] argument and church differences
[1:06:13] take the meekness and the gentleness
[1:06:16] from your life.
[1:06:20] You find people do that.
[1:06:23] They allow other people mistakes to
[1:06:26] become a stomach black today. THEY THROW
[1:06:28] THEIR virtue away because a preacher
[1:06:32] backslide. What does that have to do
[1:06:33] with you?
[1:06:36] Or if that man that was that was that
[1:06:37] was preaching the message, IF THAT MAN
[1:06:39] that was following God, if if he can,
[1:06:41] what what does that have to do with you?
[1:06:48] WHY ARE YOU UH DESPISING THE GRACE OF
[1:06:50] GOD IN YOUR life because of another
[1:06:52] man's weakness
[1:06:54] or another man's failure? Praise the
[1:06:57] Lord. If he fall, we jump over him and
[1:07:00] we move on.
[1:07:02] If he wants to get up, we help him up.
[1:07:05] If we say get up, he don't want TO GET
[1:07:06] UP, WE JUMP over him and we move on.
[1:07:14] all the little fusses. Brother Brandham
[1:07:17] says the church differences take the
[1:07:19] meekness and the gentleness from your
[1:07:21] life.
[1:07:23] You allow other people to stumble you.
[1:07:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:30] And sometimes we do that.
[1:07:34] We make other people our excuses. Well,
[1:07:37] even they said they don't come on time.
[1:07:38] We just go to that church early for
[1:07:40] nothing. It's not for nothing.
[1:07:44] Brother Bam says you supposed to be here
[1:07:45] to open the service. You supposed to be
[1:07:48] here to be praying. So you don't measure
[1:07:50] yourself with other people and what they
[1:07:52] are doing.
[1:08:02] Will you want to stand before the father
[1:08:04] like that? I don't believe you would. I
[1:08:07] don't believe that you will do it.
[1:08:09] Neither will I.
[1:08:11] How I want him to say it was well done.
[1:08:14] Amen. No matter what
[1:08:18] I'm doing, let him says it was well
[1:08:20] done. At least you try.
[1:08:23] Amen. Get a little pat on the back and
[1:08:25] say, "Son, you trying.
[1:08:31] You will not measure up to the to the
[1:08:33] great man that did great things, but you
[1:08:35] try." The measure that was given to you.
[1:08:37] You try
[1:08:40] the LITTLE GROUP THAT ARE PUT IN YOUR
[1:08:42] HANDS. YOU TRY THE PLACE YOU FIND
[1:08:44] YOURSELF among God's people. You try.
[1:08:49] You try with the family I gave you. You
[1:08:52] try with the resources that I gave you.
[1:08:58] Are we together?
[1:09:01] Not by the skin of of my teeth,
[1:09:04] but it is well done. my good and
[1:09:06] faithful servant. Enter into the joy of
[1:09:09] the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:12] For you did well with what you have to
[1:09:14] do. Listen to what he says here. Now, I
[1:09:18] took this one and just put it in. Maybe
[1:09:20] you are a housewife. If you are, God
[1:09:23] made you a teacher to your children. Do
[1:09:27] a good job out of it. Regardless of what
[1:09:31] you have to do, do it well.
[1:09:37] Do it well and be and be proud of
[1:09:40] yourself.
[1:09:42] Praise the Lord. Do it well.
[1:09:48] If you just want to come and be sit,
[1:09:50] just want to come and sit in church,
[1:09:52] just sit well. Don't sleep.
[1:09:56] Is that all you want to do? Just just
[1:09:58] make sure you do it well.
[1:10:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:08] Are we together?
[1:10:10] Listen to this one.
[1:10:12] Like I said, I just reading my notes
[1:10:13] from Sunday to you. Possessing all the
[1:10:16] gates. A few years later, when the trial
[1:10:18] comes, I love this one.
[1:10:22] This was the one I was looking for on
[1:10:24] Sunday because it was tying right into
[1:10:27] what I was saying. All the church got
[1:10:30] all shook up.
[1:10:33] as it's so easy for a congregation of
[1:10:36] people to do when something just don't
[1:10:40] seem to happen the way that it should
[1:10:43] that is supposed to be. God makes it
[1:10:47] that way. God bring tension into the
[1:10:50] church. If he can bring if he can allow
[1:10:53] tension to come into the church, he can
[1:10:55] also allow tension to come in your home.
[1:11:00] He if he can allow tension to come in
[1:11:02] your home, then he can allow it in your
[1:11:04] neighborhood and he can allow it at your
[1:11:06] work.
[1:11:08] But what he's watching your attitude
[1:11:12] are we together. He's watching your
[1:11:15] attitude. How are you going to handle
[1:11:17] it?
[1:11:20] See what he says here. And and and God
[1:11:23] makes it that way. Lord bring tension in
[1:11:25] the church for for every son that cometh
[1:11:28] to God must be tried and proven and
[1:11:31] tested. Now this is what I was using on
[1:11:34] Sunday. I I'll come back to it. Must be
[1:11:36] tried, proven, and tested. He let
[1:11:39] sickness tracks you. He let disease come
[1:11:43] upon you to test you and and to prove
[1:11:46] you to show the word that you are truly
[1:11:50] a seed of Abraham.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] How how will he SHOW THE WORD? HOW WILL
[1:11:57] HE use sickness to show the world that
[1:12:00] you are a seed of Abraham?
[1:12:02] HOW WILL SICKNESS show the world that
[1:12:04] you are see is your attitude with the
[1:12:07] sickness.
[1:12:09] How you are dealing with it.
[1:12:12] Not buying people sympathy.
[1:12:17] But even in your sickness, your
[1:12:19] confession is right.
[1:12:22] Praise the Lord
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; that even the people THAT COME TO
[1:12:27] COMFORT YOU, YOU ARE THE ONE COMFORTING
[1:12:29] THEM
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; IN YOUR SICKNESS, YOU ARE THE ONE
[1:12:32] STRENGTHENING THEM. THAT'S HOW THE WORLD
[1:12:34] WILL will be able to glorify him
[1:12:42] to show the world that you are truly a
[1:12:44] seed of Abraham. He permits it by his
[1:12:48] own will. He permit disasters. He permit
[1:12:51] friends to turn against you. He permit
[1:12:53] all these things and turn the devil
[1:12:56] loose to tempt you. And he will do ALL
[1:13:01] BUT TAKE YOUR LIFE.
[1:13:04] He could throw you on the bed of
[1:13:07] affliction. He could turn YOUR NEIGHBOR.
[1:13:10] IS THAT NOT what was happening to Job?
[1:13:15] That's exactly what was happening to Job
[1:13:18] BECAUSE IT WAS GOD THAT TURNED HIM OVER
[1:13:20] TO THE DEVIL.
[1:13:22] AND ALL HIS NEIGHBORS TURNED AGAINST
[1:13:24] HIM. ALL HIS FRIENDS TURN IT. THE ENTIRE
[1:13:26] CHURCH TURNED AGAINST HIM.
[1:13:31] And God allowed it.
[1:13:36] What is our attitude?
[1:13:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:42] What is our attitude? We quit church. We
[1:13:44] look for the next one. We look for the
[1:13:46] next place where we will be accepted.
[1:13:52] Praise the Lord. Everybody in that
[1:13:54] church is a hypocrite. That's the first
[1:13:56] thing we say.
[1:13:58] Everybody in that church is a hypocrite.
[1:14:00] They are all hypocrites.
[1:14:03] They just only look at you from the
[1:14:04] eyes, their mind, their heart. That's we
[1:14:06] just we just talk carelessly.
[1:14:12] I believe the preacher goes back to the
[1:14:14] father and says he she never grabbed it
[1:14:16] yet.
[1:14:18] Oh, he stayed he he's he's too he's too
[1:14:22] much of a child. He didn't grab what you
[1:14:24] were doing.
[1:14:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:32] And we start saying all sorts of things.
[1:14:35] That other one what what he who he think
[1:14:37] he is. That other person who she think
[1:14:39] she is. And we just go on and on and on
[1:14:42] and on and on all because we are feeling
[1:14:46] sorry for ourself.
[1:14:49] We are feeling sorry for ourself.
[1:14:54] When people do things to you and then
[1:14:57] you have the grace to feel like you are
[1:15:00] you are you are older than that thing.
[1:15:03] When they do things to you and you feel
[1:15:05] like it's too it's too little. That one
[1:15:08] is too little. I've I've grown past that
[1:15:12] and your attitude to them.
[1:15:18] You are not responding to them the way
[1:15:20] they treated you, it make them confused.
[1:15:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:30] Are we together? He permit all these
[1:15:33] things turn the devil loose and and to
[1:15:35] tempt you and he and and and he would do
[1:15:38] everything but take your life. He could
[1:15:40] throw the you on a bed of affluction.
[1:15:42] That's what he did to Job. He turned his
[1:15:44] neighbor against him. He he could turn
[1:15:47] the church against you. That's what he
[1:15:49] did to Job. These job friends, they were
[1:15:51] all IN HIS CHURCH. OH, THEY SAID JOB,
[1:15:53] THIS IS THE WAY you taught us that these
[1:15:55] things can only happen when a person
[1:15:57] commits sin.
[1:16:00] They find their opportunity now to
[1:16:02] rebuke the pastor.
[1:16:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:12] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:16:14] BUT WHILE THEY WERE DOING THAT, WHILE
[1:16:17] GOD WAS ALLOWING THAT, he was writing
[1:16:20] his word
[1:16:23] in a book,
[1:16:27] taking the treatment of the people, the
[1:16:29] attitude of Job,
[1:16:32] all of those things were the ink that he
[1:16:35] was missing, mixing together.
[1:16:38] He was writing his word on the heart of
[1:16:41] Job.
[1:16:43] Pray that soon he will break into a
[1:16:44] vision and he will say I know my
[1:16:46] redeemer lady.
[1:16:50] I know my redeemer lady.
[1:16:55] Sometimes those those uh tough things we
[1:16:57] go through. The ones we will go through
[1:17:00] we feel guilty.
[1:17:04] The ones we will go through we feel that
[1:17:06] we we we WE WE HAVE FAILED GOD. SOME OF
[1:17:09] THOSE things right IN THOSE THINGS RIGHT
[1:17:12] on that bed of affliction.
[1:17:16] You can stay right on that bed and say
[1:17:19] this very same word. I know my redeemer
[1:17:22] will know I will come out of this.
[1:17:25] Praise the Lord. Amen. AND EVERY TIME WE
[1:17:29] TAKE THAT POSITIVE POSITIVE ATTITUDE,
[1:17:32] God just write something on the tables
[1:17:34] of our heart.
[1:17:39] He turned the church against him against
[1:17:42] you. He can do most anything and is
[1:17:47] God's will for him to do it. We are
[1:17:50] taught that it is more precious
[1:17:54] than gold to us. When he take us through
[1:17:57] those things.
[1:17:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:01] When he take us through those things,
[1:18:03] when people are thinking and and
[1:18:07] whatever they are saying and what
[1:18:09] attitude is to you, you must be thinking
[1:18:13] what God is thinking about me in this
[1:18:16] situation.
[1:18:19] IF YOUR MIND EVER GOES TO THAT, YOUR
[1:18:22] attitude will be right. You'll be
[1:18:24] saying, "Lord, give me grace. Let me not
[1:18:26] fail you this time. Help me, Lord. Let
[1:18:29] me not say the wrong thing.
[1:18:33] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:18:36] PRAISE THE LORD. CHANGE MY MIND.
[1:18:41] That's that's where the Christian faith,
[1:18:43] that's where Christian life is. Right in
[1:18:46] the midst of that, you say, "God, change
[1:18:48] my mind. Let me not think evil about
[1:18:51] them."
[1:18:53] It's tough. They are saying ugly things
[1:18:55] about you, but yet you want to be
[1:18:57] positive about them.
[1:19:00] All that my words were written in the
[1:19:01] book. I love it. The whole the whole
[1:19:04] week I just been I just been saying
[1:19:05] these things to myself like some kind of
[1:19:07] crazy man. Amen. All that my words were
[1:19:09] written in the book. I just I just love
[1:19:13] it. Praise the Lord. You love the Lord.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] What a wonderful thing.
[1:19:28] What a wonderful thing.
[1:19:30] See what
[1:19:33] brother Brandon will say yet again.
[1:19:34] Let's Let's take Let's take another one.
[1:19:38] Message of grace.
[1:19:42] Message of grace. Okay, I'm left a few
[1:19:44] minutes here.
[1:19:48] When I think of Abraham, all the
[1:19:50] mistakes that he made and Moses his
[1:19:53] mistakes. But when Abraham commentary
[1:19:56] was written, when his divine commentary
[1:19:59] were written, when Paul wrote Abraham
[1:20:01] commentary, he never mentioned
[1:20:04] one thing about Abraham unbelief. No,
[1:20:08] no, he never even accounted to him. He
[1:20:12] said, "Abraham struggle not at the
[1:20:14] promise of God through unbelief, but was
[1:20:16] strong giving praise to God."
[1:20:20] My humble prayer is before the before
[1:20:24] the grace of God that is here this
[1:20:27] morning or tonight, I hope my I hope
[1:20:30] mine rose like that that he won't see my
[1:20:33] mistakes. That's when my commentary is
[1:20:36] written. Amen. my obituary
[1:20:42] that it won't be read out that I made
[1:20:45] mistakes and done wrong, but he will
[1:20:47] only see the things that I tried to do
[1:20:50] for him.
[1:20:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:56] Amen.
[1:20:58] IT'S NOT THAT PAUL NEVER knew uh uh the
[1:21:01] mistakes of Abraham or the mistakes of
[1:21:03] King or Abel or the mistakes of all of
[1:21:06] the men that he pulled in Hebrew chapter
[1:21:08] 11. But the Holy Spirit compared him
[1:21:12] to leave out their mistakes.
[1:21:15] Why? Because what Paul was writing was
[1:21:19] was the information that was in the lamb
[1:21:21] book of life.
[1:21:24] ALL THEIR MISTAKES WAS THEIR BOOK OF
[1:21:26] LIFE.
[1:21:29] BUT WHEN THE INFORMATION IS TRANSFERRED
[1:21:31] FROM THE BOOK OF LIFE TO THE LAMB BOOK
[1:21:33] OF LIFE, it is completely different.
[1:21:38] You read you read your own information.
[1:21:40] You don't even want to believe it
[1:21:41] because you know yourself.
[1:21:43] Praise the Lord. You don't want to
[1:21:45] believe it. You think that they are
[1:21:48] talking about somebody else but they are
[1:21:49] talking about you.
[1:21:55] Oh, that my words were written.
[1:21:58] They were printed in the book.
[1:22:01] Praise the Lord. Every year we live on
[1:22:05] earth is like a page in a book. Every
[1:22:09] year,
[1:22:11] one page. If you are 35 years old, your
[1:22:15] book have 35 pages.
[1:22:18] Praise the Lord. If you are 60 years
[1:22:20] old, your book have 60 pages.
[1:22:24] Every time you have a birthday when you
[1:22:26] say h sing my birthday song happy
[1:22:29] birthday told you how oh are you you
[1:22:32] passing the page
[1:22:35] praise the Lord sometimes it's good to
[1:22:37] go back and read
[1:22:40] what was on last year page what did I do
[1:22:45] what I need to do
[1:22:54] all that my words were written in the
[1:22:56] book.
[1:22:59] God had complained. He says in my life I
[1:23:02] made mistakes that brother Brandham
[1:23:04] praise the Lord. This is his own words.
[1:23:06] I never alter it. I have done lot of
[1:23:08] things that's wrong. I probably will. I
[1:23:12] probably if I live much longer I will do
[1:23:15] many things many more perhaps some of
[1:23:18] them will be stoming blocks in your way
[1:23:21] this is brother Brandon speaking
[1:23:23] realizing that he's a human
[1:23:26] realizing that he he's he's in a 16
[1:23:30] element body
[1:23:35] his gift was the angel of God to us
[1:23:40] that gift was the angel of God to lead
[1:23:42] us
[1:23:45] but yet the man was in assisting element
[1:23:47] body he's telling you I made lot of
[1:23:50] mistakes and even some of my mistake
[1:23:52] will be a stomach block and that's what
[1:23:54] making people to stumble
[1:24:01] perhaps some will be a stomach block in
[1:24:03] your way I hope that you will forgive me
[1:24:08] I was reading Abraham
[1:24:10] how that the frustration he had
[1:24:15] mind the things that he did. He doubted
[1:24:18] God. He lied about his wife in
[1:24:21] everything.
[1:24:22] But when his divine commentary was
[1:24:25] written, Romans chapter 4,
[1:24:29] it never mentioned his mistakes. But it
[1:24:32] says Abraham never sterled at uh at the
[1:24:36] unbel unbelief through God, but was
[1:24:40] strong. Amen. All his mistakes,
[1:24:43] all his mistakes was all forgiving
[1:24:47] about when the divine commentary of his
[1:24:49] life was written. His frustration wasn't
[1:24:51] mentioned. his mistakes wasn't
[1:24:53] mentioned. Brethren, I hope that when my
[1:24:56] commentary is read that day, that he
[1:24:59] will rub my out too.
[1:25:03] And one thing about them, I hope you do,
[1:25:07] too. God bless you. Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:16] So, you see, it brings us to the place
[1:25:18] to have a better understanding of the
[1:25:20] book of life.
[1:25:22] and the Lamb book of life.
[1:25:25] We must be reading from the lamb book of
[1:25:27] life because that's where the seals
[1:25:30] were. The information that were hidden
[1:25:32] under the seals were in the lamb book OF
[1:25:34] LIFE. THEY WERE NOT IN THE LAMB. They
[1:25:36] were not in the book of life. It was
[1:25:39] under the under the lamb's blood.
[1:25:43] THAT'S HOW WE MUST BE LOOKING OUR LIFE
[1:25:45] THROUGH THE GRACE OF GOD THAT HAVE COME
[1:25:47] ONTO US. THE THINGS THAT GOD IS DOING IN
[1:25:49] our life
[1:25:51] and how he's helping us.
[1:25:54] Are we together?
[1:25:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:06] When and and that's that's when when
[1:26:07] people try to use their kind of mind to
[1:26:10] understand the things of God and they
[1:26:13] get frustrated with God concerning their
[1:26:15] life. He made you
[1:26:17] Why will you be frustrated with him?
[1:26:21] All you have to do, Lord, I don't
[1:26:23] understand this thing. Lord, help me. I
[1:26:25] don't understand why I keep coming
[1:26:26] around the cycle or why this thing is
[1:26:28] happening. Give me grace to help me.
[1:26:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:35] Paul did the SAME THING. HE CRIED, "GOD,
[1:26:39] I PRAY FOR THIS MAN. I RAISED THE MAN
[1:26:41] THAT FELL DOWN BACK TO LIFE. I LORD AND
[1:26:45] HERE IS MY EYES. MY EYES IS BOTHERING
[1:26:47] ME. MY EYES IS HURTING ME. It's painful.
[1:26:52] I never HAD THIS EYES PROBLEM. BUT THE
[1:26:55] DAY YOU MET ME ON THE ROAD OF DAMASCUS,
[1:26:57] THAT'S WHERE MY PROBLEM BEGAN.
[1:27:00] LORD, WHY YOU GAVE ME THIS PROBLEM?
[1:27:04] AFTER PAUL CRIED AND CRIED AND CRIED and
[1:27:06] cried, then God make him to understand.
[1:27:10] I have given you such a grace to
[1:27:13] understand the word of God. Praise the
[1:27:15] Lord. If this thing was not in your
[1:27:18] life, you will exalt yourself beyond
[1:27:21] measure.
[1:27:24] This thing is given to you to keep you
[1:27:26] down every time you want to go.
[1:27:31] Praise the Lord. Every time you want,
[1:27:33] YOU KNOW, I'M THE CHIEFEST OF APOSTLE
[1:27:36] GOD.
[1:27:52] WHEN PAUL UNDERSTOOD IT, HE SAID, "YOUR
[1:27:56] GRACE IS SUFFICIENT."
[1:27:58] JUST LIKE JOB SAYS, "MY REDEEMER
[1:28:01] LIVETH." JO PAUL SAID, "YOUR GRACE IS
[1:28:03] SUFFICIENT. YOUR STRENGTH IS MADE
[1:28:05] PERFECT IN MY WEAKNESS.
[1:28:13] HE could see in THE LAMB BOOK OF LIFE.
[1:28:16] HE SAW HIS NAME IN THE LAMB book of
[1:28:18] life.
[1:28:19] Praise the Lord. AMEN. WHEN YOU
[1:28:22] UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD GRACE IS DOING IN
[1:28:24] YOUR LIFE, YOU HAVE SEEN your name in
[1:28:26] the lamb book of life.
[1:28:33] Not trying to work out
[1:28:35] self-righteousness.
[1:28:38] And you are just trying to work out
[1:28:40] self-righteousness THAT YOU ARE NOT EVEN
[1:28:42] CONSCIOUS OF YOUR WEAKNESS THAT God want
[1:28:44] to use.
[1:28:46] HE WANT TO USE YOUR WEAKNESS. YOU ARE
[1:28:48] NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT BECAUSE YOU ARE
[1:28:50] WORKING OUT of self-righteousness.
[1:28:55] See what brother Brandham said that we
[1:28:56] read this one and we close. Invisible
[1:28:58] union. That's where that's that's where
[1:29:00] the meat is tonight. Amen. Praise the
[1:29:03] Lord. You just been eating fish and
[1:29:06] crab. This is where the meat is. Praise
[1:29:08] the Lord. I hope your teeth will be able
[1:29:10] to handle it.
[1:29:12] He says, "Now
[1:29:14] your old book is gone
[1:29:17] with your old union.
[1:29:19] Your old union with the devil.
[1:29:22] Your old union when you were not saved.
[1:29:25] Your old book is gone with that old
[1:29:28] union. Your book of life is gone with
[1:29:32] that old union.
[1:29:34] Are we together?
[1:29:36] See what he says now. Now your name
[1:29:40] in your old
[1:29:42] in your old book has been transferred.
[1:29:47] Your name has been transferred. YOU SEE
[1:29:50] SCIENCE HAS GOT US TO the place I have a
[1:29:53] printer in in my office there. If I I I
[1:29:56] can print something from my iPad here
[1:29:59] and it will print out in the in the
[1:30:01] office. is transferred to the printer
[1:30:04] but you don't see when it went.
[1:30:09] That's the SAME WAY WHEN GOD TRANSFER
[1:30:11] YOUR INFORMATION FROM YOUR OLD BOOK TO
[1:30:14] THE LAMB BOOK OF LIFE. YOU DON'T SEE IT.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; So you KEEP READING FROM THE OLD BOOK
[1:30:24] WHEN THE INFORMATION IS ALREADY
[1:30:26] TRANSFERRED TO THE TO THE LAMP BOOK OF
[1:30:28] LIFE. PEOPLE, come on people.
[1:30:32] WE CAN DO BETTER WITH THIS MESSAGE. WE
[1:30:35] CAN DO BETTER WITH OUR CHRISTIAN LIFE.
[1:30:45] Self-righteousness is making us to live
[1:30:47] a selfish Christian life
[1:30:50] BECAUSE WE'RE JUST LIVING ON A self-pity
[1:30:53] and we just want it for ourelves. Oh
[1:30:55] God, help me. Oh, I need the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:57] Oh, oh, God help me. Fill me with the
[1:30:59] fill me with the holy. When will you be
[1:31:00] filled
[1:31:04] SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY DONE WHEN HE
[1:31:06] WANT YOU TO BE BUSTING OUT OUT OF YOUR
[1:31:09] BELLY SUPPOSED TO BE COMING LIVING
[1:31:11] LIVING RIVERS OF LIVING WATER. WELL,
[1:31:14] OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE TOUCHED BY YOUR
[1:31:15] life
[1:31:17] at your job and AND AND AND PEOPLE
[1:31:19] AROUND YOU.
[1:31:28] When you're feeling sorry for yourself,
[1:31:29] that's self-righteousness
[1:31:31] and God don't like it. It's uncleanness
[1:31:34] in the eyes of God. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:37] Filthiness.
[1:31:40] Listen to what he says.
[1:31:42] Your name in your old has been
[1:31:45] transferred. Oh, you see, do you mean to
[1:31:49] tell me that my old book, God put it in
[1:31:52] the seed? Oh my God. Oh my God. Amen.
[1:31:57] Praise the Lord. You want to tell me MY
[1:32:00] OLD BOOK, GOD PUT IT IN THE seed
[1:32:03] of his forgetfulness?
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; So he's not even READING FROM YOUR BOOK
[1:32:08] OF LIFE. HE'S READING FROM YOUR LAMB
[1:32:10] BOOK OF LIFE.
[1:32:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:16] He put it in a SEED OF FORGETFULNESS.
[1:32:18] SOME OF US, WE HAVE BECOME SUPER DIVERS.
[1:32:21] We we are diving.
[1:32:27] We're looking for LIFE JACKET. LIFE
[1:32:29] JACKET WILL KEEP YOU UP. THE BOOK IS
[1:32:31] DOWN.
[1:32:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:36] Going to look FOR OUR PAST. MAYBE IT'S
[1:32:38] THAT THING THAT I DID. THAT'S WHY GOD IS
[1:32:40] NOT BLESSING ME. AND THEN YOU JUMP
[1:32:41] INSIDE and see.
[1:32:45] Praise the Lord. YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IT.
[1:32:47] YOU COME OUT.
[1:32:50] LORD, help me please.
[1:32:52] Oh my god. Oh my god.
[1:32:55] And as you ask God to help you, he bring
[1:32:57] you OR YOU GO BACK THERE AGAIN.
[1:33:06] OH, MERCIFUL. You know, I I just when I
[1:33:09] when I study these things, I just enjoy
[1:33:11] it. I enjoy it because
[1:33:15] it makes
[1:33:16] our walk with Christ sweeter. It gets
[1:33:21] sweeter as the day goes by.
[1:33:24] It gets sweeter. Christ become a person.
[1:33:29] IT'S NOT A RELIGION. IT'S NOT A CHURCH
[1:33:30] HOUSE. He become A PERSON. YOU FEEL THE
[1:33:34] PRESENCE OF THE ONE THAT SAID, "I WILL
[1:33:36] NEVER LEAVE YOU. I will never forsake
[1:33:38] you." You feel his presence.
[1:33:41] It's not some sensation
[1:33:44] that just g your body. No, you feel it
[1:33:47] RIGHT IN YOUR MISTAKE. You can feel it
[1:33:50] because you see grace is standing before
[1:33:51] you and that grace tell you, you know,
[1:33:53] you just mess up now. You say, "Lord,
[1:33:55] yes, I mess up. Have mercy upon me."
[1:33:57] Give me grace.
[1:34:08] It's been transparent. DO YOU MEAN TO
[1:34:10] TELL ME THAT he put my old book put God
[1:34:13] put it in the seat of forgetfulness? You
[1:34:15] stand perfectly before God. Now your
[1:34:17] name is now in the new book. Not in the
[1:34:22] book of life, but the lamb book of life.
[1:34:28] Praise the Lord. Your name is in the
[1:34:31] lamb book of life. YOUR NAME IS UNDER
[1:34:34] THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:34:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:40] Amen.
[1:34:42] IT'S UNDER THE REVELATION OF JESUS
[1:34:44] CHRIST. I WANT TO BE MORE OF JESUS. I
[1:34:47] WANT TO BE JESUS FOR MY DAY. Praise the
[1:34:50] Lord. AMEN. WHEN I LOOK AT THE LIFE OF
[1:34:54] OF MOSES, I LOOK AT THE LIFE OF DANIEL,
[1:34:56] SHEDRA, MISHAD, AND ABEDNEGO, I DON'T
[1:34:58] WANT TO BE LIKE SHEDRA, MISHAD, AND
[1:35:00] ABEDNEGO.
[1:35:02] I want to be like the Christ that was in
[1:35:04] it
[1:35:06] because it's transfer on this side.
[1:35:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:22] The lamb book of what the lamb redeemed
[1:35:25] what the lamb has redeemed. The lamb
[1:35:27] book of life. What the lamb redeemed.
[1:35:29] Not the old book of your natural union.
[1:35:33] Not the old book of your natural union.
[1:35:36] When did that natural union begin? The
[1:35:38] day you were born. DAVID SAID, "I WAS
[1:35:41] BORN IN SIN." IN SIN DID MY MOTHER
[1:35:44] CONCEIVE ME. SO THE DAY THAT YOU WERE
[1:35:46] BORN, YOU WERE MARRIED TO YOUR OLD BOOK.
[1:35:48] FROM THAT DAY, THAT'S YOUR natural
[1:35:51] union.
[1:35:53] BUT THE DAY THAT YOU RECEIVED CHRIST,
[1:35:56] THE DAY YOU WERE ASKED, DID YOU ACCEPT
[1:35:58] THE LORD JESUS AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR?
[1:36:01] ARE YOU READY TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH HIM
[1:36:03] IN WATER BAPTIZE
[1:36:05] YOU IN the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:07] Christ?
[1:36:10] That old husband is dead.
[1:36:12] PRAISE THE LORD. THAT OLD BOOK STAY IN
[1:36:15] THE WATER AND IT GOES DOWN TO THE
[1:36:17] BOTTOM.
[1:36:23] Don't go swimming for it. It's gone. You
[1:36:27] try to swim, you will not even get it.
[1:36:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:32] Because it's in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:36:36] at the bottomless PIT. IT'S BOTTOMLESS.
[1:36:39] YOU CAN'T you can't find it. It's gone.
[1:36:41] It's gone.
[1:36:43] Are we together?
[1:36:46] WHAT A LAMB REDEEMED. NOT THE OLD BOOK
[1:36:48] OF YOUR NATURAL UNION. But you you are
[1:36:53] new bride. Hallelujah. Your your new
[1:36:57] life is in the book in the lamb book of
[1:37:01] life. Your marriage certificate
[1:37:04] is the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:08] Amen. Your marriage certificate is the
[1:37:11] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:37:15] in the lamb book of life.
[1:37:20] That's the reason why we can't identify
[1:37:21] oursel with bride because we keep
[1:37:23] reading from the old book. There is no
[1:37:25] MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE. THE MARRIAGE
[1:37:26] CERTIFICATE IN THAT OLD book is the one
[1:37:28] married to the devil by your by your
[1:37:30] first birth.
[1:37:37] But when YOU COME TO START READING YOUR
[1:37:39] LIFE, BY GRACE I'M SAVED THROUGH FAITH.
[1:37:42] AND IT'S NOT BY MY WORKS, BUT BY THE
[1:37:45] GRACE OF GOD.
[1:37:51] Brother Brandon said he slipped the ring
[1:37:54] of a merited favor on your finger.
[1:37:57] He gave you a marriage certificate, the
[1:38:00] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:02] beginning to see things new.
[1:38:07] The message is not just water baptism in
[1:38:09] Jesus name. A woman don't wear trousers.
[1:38:13] All of those things the Pentecostals can
[1:38:14] do it better than you
[1:38:17] or we believe in the oneness.
[1:38:20] Jesus is God. Wonderful. They all
[1:38:23] wonderful. But it's all of those things.
[1:38:25] They are all there in the old book. When
[1:38:27] you come to the new book, it's
[1:38:29] completely different.
[1:38:32] Amen. When you come to THE NEW BOOK
[1:38:36] THAT DAY, YOU WILL KNOW that
[1:38:38] I was in him. Amen. He was in me. I in
[1:38:44] you and you in me. When you look in the
[1:38:47] new book, you see yourself part of the
[1:38:50] deity.
[1:38:53] When you look in the NEW BOOK, WHEN YOU
[1:38:54] TALK ABOUT THE ONENESS, YOU DON'T LEAVE
[1:38:56] YOURSELF OUT.
[1:38:59] If you leave yourself out, it's just
[1:39:01] knowledge.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I'm I'm fire. It looks like
[1:39:12] preaching on the convention tonight.
[1:39:14] Amen. That little prayer meeting did
[1:39:16] well for me. It looks like I'm preaching
[1:39:18] in the convention tonight. I let you go
[1:39:21] here. Now, the old book of your natural
[1:39:23] life, but you are a bride. Hallelujah.
[1:39:25] Your new life is in the lamb book of
[1:39:28] life. your marriage certificate where
[1:39:30] your true internal gene
[1:39:33] from the beginning takes hold. It takes
[1:39:37] hold.
[1:39:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:42] You grab it.
[1:39:44] No matter what your mind goes through,
[1:39:46] no matter what your body goes through,
[1:39:49] your mind might be failing you, but you
[1:39:51] get a hold of it. You know that you grab
[1:39:54] it. YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW. And that's
[1:39:56] what was happening to Job. He got a hold
[1:40:00] of it. He couldn't explain it,
[1:40:04] but he said, "I know my redeemer
[1:40:06] liveth."
[1:40:08] Are we together?
[1:40:11] Now you are not only forgiven, but you
[1:40:14] are justified. Glory. Justified. Romans
[1:40:17] 5:1 said, "Therefore, being justified by
[1:40:20] faith
[1:40:22] in God's book of the seed of
[1:40:24] forgetfulness, your old book,
[1:40:28] your old book and in marriage is
[1:40:31] divorced and dead
[1:40:34] and is is not even in the memory of God.
[1:40:39] Your old book and marriage is divorced
[1:40:43] and dead." That's what God that's what
[1:40:46] the prophet God says.
[1:40:48] That's what brother Abraham SAID WHEN
[1:40:50] WHEN PAUL TAUGHT IN IN IN in Romans
[1:40:53] chapter 7 that a woman cannot marry
[1:40:55] until her husband is dead. Brother said
[1:40:58] that was not about marriage and divorce.
[1:41:01] He said we use it on the subject of
[1:41:02] marriage and divorce. He said but Paul
[1:41:04] was prophesying.
[1:41:07] He was prophesying to the church
[1:41:10] that you cannot get a hold of your
[1:41:13] husband Christ until your old husband is
[1:41:16] dead.
[1:41:18] Until he's dead to you. This Christ will
[1:41:22] not YOU WILL REALLY NOT FALL IN LOVE
[1:41:24] WITH HIM. If you are still falling back
[1:41:26] to your old nature, your old mistakes,
[1:41:28] you are still feeling condemned. You
[1:41:30] cannot fall in love with Christ. YOU
[1:41:32] HAVE TO REALIZE THAT HE LOVE BEYOND ALL
[1:41:35] YOUR faults and he still love you. While
[1:41:39] you were we were yet in sin,
[1:41:42] love us,
[1:41:50] man. Falling in love with Jesus is the
[1:41:53] best thing I have ever done. Praise the
[1:41:56] Lord. I mean falling in love with Jesus.
[1:42:01] Waking up in the morning and say, "Lord,
[1:42:03] I love you. Thank you for another day. I
[1:42:07] love you, Jesus.
[1:42:12] I love you, Jesus.
[1:42:16] I worship and adore you.
[1:42:20] Just want to say that I love you more
[1:42:21] than anything.
[1:42:26] It must not be hard. It must not be a
[1:42:28] struggle to say, "I love you, Jesus.
[1:42:32] I love you, Jesus.
[1:42:36] I love you, Jesus." If you are not in
[1:42:38] the habit of doing it, you better start
[1:42:40] doing it. Praise the Lord. This one that
[1:42:43] you love that you can never tell that
[1:42:44] you love, you can never say it from your
[1:42:46] mouth, I love you,
[1:42:52] is dead.
[1:42:54] You are justified.
[1:42:57] You were accused.
[1:42:59] You never done it in the first place.
[1:43:02] Oh, we come today. You never done it in
[1:43:04] the first place.
[1:43:07] You were accused
[1:43:09] your whole union in the seed of God
[1:43:12] forgetfulness.
[1:43:13] You wasn't married to it to begin with.
[1:43:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:21] That's what I was getting told.
[1:43:23] That's what I wanted to bring you.
[1:43:26] When you going through those trials,
[1:43:30] you going through those trials,
[1:43:33] that that that is the transferring
[1:43:35] machine. God God has just put your
[1:43:38] information of your old book in the
[1:43:41] machine
[1:43:44] and uh and and and you know all all of
[1:43:47] those all of those uh photocopying
[1:43:48] machine, scanning machine. If you know
[1:43:51] the heat, if you know the amount of heat
[1:43:56] that is in there to be able to take a
[1:43:59] print from this thing and put it on the
[1:44:02] paper, the amount of heat
[1:44:06] and that's why God takes us through the
[1:44:08] fire.
[1:44:11] HE TAKES US THROUGH EVERY TRIALS.
[1:44:14] THE AMOUNT OF HEAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH
[1:44:16] FOR HIS WORD TO BE WRITTEN PRINTED ON
[1:44:19] our hearts, for his word to be printed
[1:44:22] ON OUR MIND. WE GO THROUGH THOSE THINGS
[1:44:27] THAT IN THE QUIET TIME OF THE NIGHT YOU
[1:44:29] CAN JUST THINK AND WHEN you think you
[1:44:31] know that it is NOBODY BUT JESUS.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; NOBODY COULD HAVE DONE THIS.
[1:44:37] NOBODY COULD HAVE BRING ME OUT OF THIS.
[1:44:41] NOBODY COULD HAVE DELIVERED ME. IT'S
[1:44:43] GOD. THIS had to be God.
[1:44:46] THAT FAIRY TRIAL, THE HEAT,
[1:44:49] that's how your information is
[1:44:51] transferred from your old book to the
[1:44:53] new book
[1:44:55] is the fairy trials of your faith
[1:45:00] and your attitude
[1:45:03] and your attitude. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
[1:45:06] GET the right attitude, you'll be
[1:45:07] reading from the old book and you will
[1:45:10] NOT ENJOY THE BENEFIT OF WHAT GOD HAS
[1:45:12] done of transferring your information to
[1:45:15] the new book.
[1:45:20] You will not enjoy it
[1:45:23] because you have the wrong attitude. But
[1:45:25] the right mental attitude will bring
[1:45:26] every word to pass.
[1:45:30] God bless you.
[1:45:34] God bless you tonight. Amen.
[1:45:44] God bless you tonight. Just a prayer
[1:45:46] meeting
[1:45:54] that God should love a sinner such as I.
[1:45:57] Let's sing that softly tonight and then
[1:46:00] we go to the Lord in prayer.
[1:46:08] The God you love
[1:46:11] has seen a senior
[1:46:17] to change
[1:46:19] my sorrow into bless
[1:46:24] no rest till he
[1:46:28] has planned to break me down. Oh, has

[1:47:20] although
[1:47:22] amen
[1:47:24] is death on Calvary.
[1:47:29] Let every hymn or tongue
[1:47:32] find a number.
