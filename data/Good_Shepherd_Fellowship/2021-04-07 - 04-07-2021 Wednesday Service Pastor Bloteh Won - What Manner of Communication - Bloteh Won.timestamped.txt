[1:06:39] lord will

[1:06:52] closer to you
[1:06:53] we love you we appreciate your father in

[1:07:03] i praise the lord but call it go and sit
[1:07:06] by beside your wife
[1:07:11] praise the lord amen
[1:07:16] well the uh we really enjoy their
[1:07:19] company
[1:07:20] enjoy their visit with us and
[1:07:25] and i guess uh both of them will we
[1:07:28] appreciate your prayers
[1:07:30] that you keep them in your prayers lord
[1:07:33] we bless them as they travel
[1:07:35] hoping to visit again praise the lord
[1:07:39] amen but you see uh
[1:07:43] a few years back after we came
[1:07:47] out of our memorial day meeting
[1:07:50] meetings we decided that we will we will
[1:07:53] start
[1:07:55] these uh easter meetings
[1:07:58] and he came uh like i told you he came
[1:08:00] to me as a personal conviction
[1:08:03] even though brother brother prater
[1:08:07] you know when we talked uh you know we
[1:08:11] we joke around and and he try to make it
[1:08:14] like my personal doctrine but i said
[1:08:16] it's not a doctrine it's just my
[1:08:17] personal conviction
[1:08:19] i feel that it's a good thing for me as
[1:08:22] a pastor to spend
[1:08:24] easter with the church because i was
[1:08:27] traveling for most easter
[1:08:29] meetings
[1:08:34] but you see the thing about it their
[1:08:35] church is that
[1:08:37] it's not just to have a special meeting
[1:08:40] it's not just
[1:08:41] to have a convention or whatever term we
[1:08:45] want to give it
[1:08:46] but it is the importance that we put to
[1:08:48] it
[1:08:50] you know i heard brother branham saying
[1:08:52] that uh
[1:08:53] easter is the only which of course we
[1:08:56] know is the only christian
[1:08:58] holiday that there is
[1:09:02] praise the lord easter is the only
[1:09:05] christian holiday that there is
[1:09:08] the only truth christian holiday is
[1:09:12] easter
[1:09:13] and we know it is all because of the
[1:09:15] resurrection
[1:09:16] i will tell you something i'll share
[1:09:19] something with
[1:09:20] you uh uh uh you know
[1:09:24] even as we come to the to the uh the
[1:09:27] month
[1:09:28] of april uh you
[1:09:31] realize that god told the children of
[1:09:35] israel in uh
[1:09:38] in establishing the easter
[1:09:42] where he will he will
[1:09:46] you know tell them give them the
[1:09:49] ordinance of the passover
[1:09:51] he told them that this will be
[1:09:55] the beginning of months
[1:09:58] amen which was the month of abba he says
[1:10:01] this
[1:10:03] will be the beginning of months god
[1:10:06] was establishing a new calendar
[1:10:10] he was establishing a new day if it is
[1:10:13] the beginning of months
[1:10:15] then it is the beginning of the year
[1:10:18] praise the lord
[1:10:19] amen so he told them and said this will
[1:10:22] be
[1:10:23] the beginning of months and we know that
[1:10:26] uh
[1:10:26] uh you know in the jewish calendar is
[1:10:29] the man of abba
[1:10:30] and and and actually it is what
[1:10:34] uh uh you know that is that is that is
[1:10:37] taken
[1:10:38] as as april this is springtime
[1:10:41] is the beginning of life amen
[1:10:44] that's what spring is but
[1:10:48] right now we are we are under
[1:10:52] uh uh a different calendar
[1:10:55] we are on the uh how we would call it
[1:10:59] uh you know
[1:11:02] our gentle a gregorian calendar
[1:11:06] now in changing that
[1:11:10] what uh uh history would tell us
[1:11:14] is that when the when the king or the
[1:11:17] emperor gregory would change
[1:11:21] the calendar over to what we have
[1:11:25] january going on there was something
[1:11:28] that happened that many of us don't know
[1:11:32] and i'll share with you tonight and
[1:11:38] that was back in
[1:11:41] 1582 when when
[1:11:44] uh
[1:11:47] when france swished from the julian
[1:11:50] calanda to the
[1:11:51] to you know to the gregorian calendar
[1:11:55] what happened is that because the jews
[1:12:00] has started beginning the year
[1:12:04] with what we would call april or abba
[1:12:07] that was the beginning of months with
[1:12:09] them so
[1:12:11] uh when this calendar was changed
[1:12:15] and and they decided to start the
[1:12:18] beginning
[1:12:19] of the year from january
[1:12:27] right in there that's word
[1:12:31] this little uh what
[1:12:35] terms to be a joke or how you call it
[1:12:38] whatever way you want to call it april
[1:12:40] food
[1:12:42] that was when it was introduced now you
[1:12:45] have to realize
[1:12:47] that just as as uh
[1:12:51] naomi brought ruth into
[1:12:55] uh lefty hand and
[1:12:58] and then she met a boss that that is the
[1:13:02] same way
[1:13:03] the jewish church brought
[1:13:07] the blessing of abraham to the gentile
[1:13:10] people
[1:13:11] praise the lord so
[1:13:14] the early christians head on to the
[1:13:18] judean calendar
[1:13:20] they were doing everything according to
[1:13:23] the judean calendar
[1:13:24] because that is the history of the
[1:13:27] church
[1:13:29] so when this calendar change took place
[1:13:35] the early christians were still
[1:13:38] hauling to april 1st
[1:13:42] as the beginning of their year
[1:13:46] praise the lord amen
[1:13:50] so when that time comes
[1:13:53] just like we have the chinese new year
[1:13:56] and
[1:13:57] and different you know groups have their
[1:13:59] new year
[1:14:00] when that time of the year comes even
[1:14:02] though every one of them keep
[1:14:03] this january to december calendar but
[1:14:06] for certain reasons they will celebrate
[1:14:08] that time of the year
[1:14:09] as the beginning of their new year what
[1:14:12] are japanese china
[1:14:13] china whatever group it is but
[1:14:16] to the early christians they were still
[1:14:18] respecting
[1:14:20] april first but that's where
[1:14:23] the slogan april fool came
[1:14:28] so the early christians were called
[1:14:31] fooled
[1:14:32] for honoring
[1:14:36] the beginning of months as the beginning
[1:14:39] of their year
[1:14:43] praise the lord amen so april fool
[1:14:48] it is not just a general joke it was a
[1:14:51] joke to
[1:14:52] mark the christians
[1:14:59] praise the lord it was a joke because
[1:15:02] even though
[1:15:03] they has changed the calendar and this
[1:15:07] king said well it's no longer the first
[1:15:09] of
[1:15:10] of of april we're going to start from
[1:15:12] the first of january
[1:15:14] that will be the beginning of the year
[1:15:16] but these christians
[1:15:18] decided that they would still honor
[1:15:21] the 1st of april because that was the
[1:15:24] beginning of months
[1:15:27] in honor of the passover that was
[1:15:31] speaking
[1:15:32] of the resurrection
[1:15:36] praise the lord amen so
[1:15:40] the the the the the the easter
[1:15:44] celebration goes back now why am i
[1:15:47] saying this
[1:15:48] is because just like we were saying is
[1:15:51] dripping with blood
[1:15:52] there are people that have gone through
[1:15:56] criticisms you hear brother branham says
[1:15:58] uh uh uh they call the church holy
[1:16:01] roller
[1:16:01] and and all of that i mean
[1:16:05] that that word holy roller
[1:16:08] was actually an insult
[1:16:12] amen it was an insult on the church
[1:16:17] praise the lord are we together
[1:16:21] so you realize that these early
[1:16:24] christians they had to go
[1:16:26] through different things
[1:16:29] so we can be able to have a faith today
[1:16:34] but when it comes to the last day of
[1:16:36] church we bring all of these jokes
[1:16:41] what was a a criticism and an insult
[1:16:45] to the man that was standing for truth
[1:16:47] is now something that is
[1:16:49] lied to us
[1:16:54] are we together praise the lord
[1:17:02] in other groups you see the the the
[1:17:05] the the mohammedans the muslim they they
[1:17:09] they
[1:17:09] love and celebrate the ramadan praise
[1:17:13] the lord
[1:17:14] and when it comes to that time they
[1:17:16] don't care how many a dollar you paying
[1:17:18] them
[1:17:19] when it comes to that time they have to
[1:17:21] celebrate it
[1:17:24] and different other groups you know you
[1:17:26] get uh the buddhists that have their
[1:17:28] time to celebrate
[1:17:30] but when it comes to the resurrection
[1:17:33] it comes to easter the the
[1:17:37] hope of your faith
[1:17:41] praise the lord you know what the church
[1:17:44] gives us easter eggs
[1:17:49] palm sunday we town time leaves together
[1:17:54] when it's supposed to be a sacred moment
[1:17:57] for us
[1:17:59] it's supposed to be a time where we pull
[1:18:02] ourselves back
[1:18:05] a person will say if i would take my
[1:18:06] vacation from work i take it on easter
[1:18:11] and i will set that time aside if i have
[1:18:14] to just sit home even there if there is
[1:18:16] no
[1:18:16] convention let me just spend that time
[1:18:19] to appreciate the lord jesus for what he
[1:18:22] did for me
[1:18:26] all the religion that has no life in it
[1:18:34] go to places like liberia where the
[1:18:36] where where the
[1:18:37] the the the transportation
[1:18:40] is run by muslims time for the ramadan
[1:18:44] everybody stay home
[1:18:45] because they are not driving they are
[1:18:48] not going to be taxes meant for you
[1:18:50] because
[1:18:51] they have to celebrate their ramadan
[1:18:55] but you water down
[1:18:59] the hope of your faith
[1:19:06] so when you say april fool you are
[1:19:09] saying it to yourself
[1:19:23] praise the lord but i want to thank you
[1:19:26] for coming this weekend
[1:19:32] thank you for making the the service
[1:19:34] special
[1:19:36] praise the lord i know people how to how
[1:19:38] to juggle around their jobs and
[1:19:40] different things but we appreciate you
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:46] but until it becomes a revelation to you
[1:19:48] we just have to remind you
[1:19:51] god has to quicken it in your heart he
[1:19:54] has to make it real
[1:19:56] praise the lord paul says if there be no
[1:19:59] resurrection
[1:20:01] we better stop playing games
[1:20:05] if this thing about christianity is just
[1:20:08] all for us to come
[1:20:10] and and have brother college sing good
[1:20:12] music and we just sit there and tap our
[1:20:14] feet
[1:20:14] and and you know and entertain ourself
[1:20:19] we will be the most miserable people
[1:20:28] we will be the most miserable people
[1:20:35] praise the lord but that's the hope we
[1:20:38] have
[1:20:40] amen just like the sun will rise
[1:20:43] tomorrow morning
[1:20:45] we believe that there is a resurrection
[1:20:48] that's the hope that is in our heart
[1:20:51] praise the lord
[1:20:53] brother branham says uh uh taking sides
[1:20:55] of jesus he says every
[1:20:57] every son of god is every child
[1:21:00] every prophet that went down to the to
[1:21:03] the grave they went down with that
[1:21:05] anticipation
[1:21:08] he says that's the reason why they will
[1:21:10] rise up
[1:21:12] with the hope that was in their heart he
[1:21:13] said when paul preached about
[1:21:16] the rapture paul did not preach the
[1:21:18] rapture message for your age
[1:21:22] he never said dead i will be alive he
[1:21:24] said we
[1:21:25] that are alive he was preaching the
[1:21:28] rapture for his day
[1:21:33] he said we that are alive
[1:21:38] so they die with that hope in their
[1:21:40] heart
[1:21:43] praise the lord i know we are just
[1:21:47] just as uh you know small group of
[1:21:49] people just a little
[1:21:51] little assembly and
[1:21:54] but you see this it's not it's not the
[1:21:57] multitude it's not the crowd
[1:22:00] what god wants to achieve is to
[1:22:03] discipline
[1:22:04] god is looking for discipline when you
[1:22:06] hear
[1:22:07] adopted sounds it means disciplined
[1:22:10] sounds
[1:22:12] people that are adopted are people that
[1:22:14] are disciplined
[1:22:21] praise the lord
[1:22:25] so what we want to talk about what we
[1:22:27] want to encourage you tonight is
[1:22:30] what manner of communication you know
[1:22:32] that's what jesus said
[1:22:34] to those men what manner of
[1:22:36] communication
[1:22:37] what are you talking about after these
[1:22:38] meetings i taught you
[1:22:40] after we get back to service tonight and
[1:22:43] you will be on fire
[1:22:47] you know we we just we we get excited
[1:22:50] and after the meeting is gone it's just
[1:22:52] gone
[1:22:53] it's just gone the excitement just goes
[1:22:56] away
[1:22:57] and the people just keep dragging
[1:23:01] you know people just keep dragging and
[1:23:05] just like being wake up from a deep
[1:23:07] sleep
[1:23:10] praise the lord a man has always been
[1:23:14] like that
[1:23:17] i believe that's the same thing that
[1:23:19] jesus was dealing with with these two
[1:23:20] men
[1:23:22] on the road of demise with all that they
[1:23:26] have heard
[1:23:27] with all that they saw in and he taught
[1:23:30] them and
[1:23:31] and told them about living in the
[1:23:33] comfort of with calm
[1:23:35] and the promises he gave to them
[1:23:38] yet when he left they were of sar heart
[1:23:42] jesus said what manner of communication
[1:23:48] since uh uh uh
[1:23:52] sunday about two o'clock two o'clock we
[1:23:57] we left and uh
[1:23:58] what are you what you been talking about
[1:24:02] praise the lord what have we been
[1:24:05] talking about
[1:24:08] were we talking about the things that

[1:24:18] you know and sheeps they they eat their
[1:24:20] food and then they keep it in a jar
[1:24:23] and they bring it back up again and they
[1:24:24] chew it
[1:24:28] praise the lord and that's what we must
[1:24:32] do
[1:24:32] our spiritual sheeps we don't come to
[1:24:35] service just to enjoy a good preaching
[1:24:38] or es it would just be
[1:24:39] entertaining because that's what
[1:24:42] entertainment
[1:24:43] that that's the way it affect us you sit
[1:24:46] there you enjoy the moment as soon as
[1:24:48] you walk out of the door it's gone
[1:24:50] but this is not entertainment this is an
[1:24:52] experience
[1:24:54] you are having an experience with the
[1:24:56] raising christ and an
[1:24:58] experience affects you
[1:25:01] when a person has on the spirit it
[1:25:03] affect them
[1:25:08] praise the lord
[1:25:15] that's that's what brother branham ex
[1:25:17] explained
[1:25:18] by being affected in
[1:25:22] in the spirit man and being affected
[1:25:26] in the soul praise the lord
[1:25:29] he says the word the soul can feel
[1:25:33] on only one thing jesus said
[1:25:36] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:25:39] every word that proceed from the mouth
[1:25:41] of god
[1:25:42] your soul can only feed on the word of
[1:25:45] god
[1:25:47] praise the lord amen
[1:25:51] so if i try to preach tonight
[1:25:55] and look for stories and try to
[1:25:58] just bring a lot of stories and make you
[1:26:02] feel
[1:26:02] sorrowful okay let me talk about the
[1:26:04] passion of christ
[1:26:06] you see this gone easter jesus really
[1:26:09] suffered
[1:26:10] you know that that the the pooled his
[1:26:12] beard and he bleeding
[1:26:14] and and i can tell you all of those
[1:26:16] story
[1:26:17] and i can drive you into a into a ram
[1:26:21] for you to feel so sorry for
[1:26:23] but if it is not the word your soul will
[1:26:26] not feed on it
[1:26:27] your spirit you will just feel sorry for
[1:26:30] in that moment
[1:26:31] that i'm talking to you praise the lord
[1:26:35] amen
[1:26:37] and as soon as you get outside you know
[1:26:39] it will play on your mind
[1:26:41] it's still in your spirit realm you feel
[1:26:43] sorry for you feel quiet
[1:26:45] you say but if the soul did not receive
[1:26:48] the word
[1:26:49] the thing that makes you carry on the
[1:26:53] revival
[1:26:54] is the word that you have fed in your
[1:26:56] soul
[1:26:59] praise the lord that's the thing that
[1:27:01] makes you to think oh my goodness i
[1:27:03] really enjoy that weekend
[1:27:05] it's the world you keep remembering the
[1:27:07] word
[1:27:08] the word is playing back in your heart
[1:27:19] most of the time we just sit there
[1:27:23] and we listening to the story when the
[1:27:25] preacher is talking we connected with
[1:27:27] this one okay yeah
[1:27:28] yeah brother brandon said this he come
[1:27:30] to this okay yeah brother branham said
[1:27:32] that
[1:27:32] and we use all of that
[1:27:36] to entertain ourself
[1:27:39] praise the lord
[1:27:44] amen brother branham shared christ is
[1:27:46] the mystery of god revealed
[1:27:47] he says that is the way
[1:27:54] for you to know jesus by the flesh
[1:28:01] praise the lord remember he says you
[1:28:03] remember that paul didn't know jesus by
[1:28:05] the flesh
[1:28:07] he says when a man has all the
[1:28:10] intellectual understanding of the
[1:28:12] scripture
[1:28:13] he just know jesus by the flesh
[1:28:17] if he can connect the cults and connect
[1:28:19] the scripture
[1:28:21] and just lay back
[1:28:24] he just know jesus by
[1:28:28] the flesh
[1:28:31] praise the lord
[1:28:36] what manner of communication
[1:28:41] praise the lord
[1:28:46] what manner of communication
[1:28:50] i believe that
[1:28:55] this little group of people that come
[1:28:58] here wednesday night
[1:29:02] and sunday morning that uh
[1:29:05] identified with this with this uh
[1:29:08] assembly here
[1:29:09] you know uh working from the corner of
[1:29:12] the street
[1:29:13] i believe that if god
[1:29:16] will help us and realize that
[1:29:20] uh we're not just doing a religion
[1:29:25] and actually get involved
[1:29:28] in what god
[1:29:31] is doing in this building
[1:29:35] praise the lord amen
[1:29:39] i believe that there is there is nothing
[1:29:41] that is impossible for us
[1:29:45] everything that we we have put our heart
[1:29:48] to do
[1:29:50] in this church we have tried to do it
[1:29:52] right
[1:29:53] maybe they have not come up to stand up
[1:29:55] but we have tried to do it
[1:29:58] how much more if we get
[1:30:04] involved
[1:30:06] the lord how much more if we get
[1:30:08] involved
[1:30:10] i mean we have great services we have
[1:30:13] services
[1:30:13] where you can you can you can feel the
[1:30:17] presence you can even
[1:30:18] you can even cut it with a blade right
[1:30:24] praise the lord but with all that
[1:30:28] it looks like people just stand on the
[1:30:31] shore and look at a scene
[1:30:37] instead of jumping in the water
[1:30:41] by the moving of the spirit
[1:30:45] praise the lord people just sit
[1:30:48] and just look at scene
[1:30:52] water is good preaching whether it is
[1:30:55] good singing
[1:30:56] nice music we just stay
[1:30:59] on the stage right
[1:31:03] and look at the scene yeah but just like
[1:31:06] i've
[1:31:06] always reminded us is is it's
[1:31:09] all saying from my from my friend
[1:31:13] brother lonnie he used to say you have
[1:31:15] to remember
[1:31:17] that you are the audience no
[1:31:20] god is your audience
[1:31:25] and you are the actors that are unseen
[1:31:28] yes
[1:31:29] it's not the preacher the actor and you
[1:31:31] the audience he said
[1:31:32] heaven is your audience
[1:31:38] and god is looking down and those angels
[1:31:42] are watching
[1:31:44] and seeing what's your attitude
[1:31:47] when the word is being preached
[1:31:50] praise the lord
[1:31:53] what's your attitude when the word is
[1:31:56] being preached
[1:31:59] well so let's just go into what we want
[1:32:00] to talk about tonight
[1:32:02] what manner of communication
[1:32:06] we are reminded of this story
[1:32:11] that was the first day of the
[1:32:13] resurrection
[1:32:15] praise the lord we we spoke about that
[1:32:19] uh in many different ways we were
[1:32:22] talking about the different
[1:32:24] body the the terrestrial celestial
[1:32:28] and heaven and body we we spoke about
[1:32:30] that
[1:32:31] you know because it's all seen in that
[1:32:35] we know that jesus
[1:32:39] he had a a terrestrial body
[1:32:42] you know and and that was that was what
[1:32:45] the the crucified him
[1:32:47] and and then when he resurrected
[1:32:50] right there in in luke chapter 24
[1:32:54] uh the bible talks about him meeting
[1:32:56] mary
[1:32:58] you know and and then he told you know
[1:33:00] when he
[1:33:02] called mary mark elaine and she she
[1:33:04] realized
[1:33:05] that that was her lord he says
[1:33:09] touch ned because he was in a different
[1:33:13] form of body
[1:33:16] you see i'm not raising i'm not raising
[1:33:18] unto the father yet
[1:33:19] go and tell my brethrens i will meet you
[1:33:24] amen so
[1:33:27] just in that period of time brother
[1:33:29] branham says the sacrifice needed to be
[1:33:31] presented
[1:33:34] praise the lord so he died in
[1:33:37] in a terrestrial body when when he when
[1:33:40] he
[1:33:41] he was raising and he met mary martin
[1:33:44] lane
[1:33:44] it was in a celestial body
[1:33:47] praise the lord but that bothering
[1:33:51] do not eat or drink
[1:33:55] that body cannot be touched by martyr
[1:34:01] praise the lord but we realized
[1:34:05] that that was the same that was the same
[1:34:08] day
[1:34:09] he have just raised him he just met mary
[1:34:13] magdalene
[1:34:14] and he says go and tell my brethren i'm
[1:34:16] raising
[1:34:18] and in no time he met these two men on
[1:34:20] the road of emails
[1:34:23] so when he left miramar the lane he
[1:34:26] ascended on to the father
[1:34:28] and then he came back and then he took
[1:34:30] on another body
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:34] which is now a heavenly body because in
[1:34:37] this body
[1:34:40] he will eat
[1:34:43] but yet he can go through a war
[1:34:50] are we together amen
[1:34:55] so he met cleopas and his friend on the
[1:34:58] road
[1:35:00] and he asked them
[1:35:05] this amazing question that we are
[1:35:07] talking about tonight he said unto them
[1:35:09] what manner of communication
[1:35:12] the bible says year as the
[1:35:15] joining it came to pass that while they
[1:35:18] commune
[1:35:19] uh together in reason
[1:35:23] jesus himself drew nigh
[1:35:26] praise the lord amen and
[1:35:29] uh and went with them but
[1:35:33] their eyes were holding
[1:35:36] so we realized that they did not
[1:35:40] identify him
[1:35:44] praise the lord amen
[1:35:48] they did not identify him just like mary
[1:35:51] magdalene when he
[1:35:52] when when he called her he had to call
[1:35:55] her by name
[1:35:58] the thing that helped her to identify
[1:36:00] him was a familiar voice
[1:36:04] she did not identify him by his
[1:36:08] appearance
[1:36:11] praise the lord
[1:36:14] are we together because i mean just like
[1:36:18] brother ben was talking
[1:36:19] uh speaking on the weekend uh you know
[1:36:22] when
[1:36:23] when when we drop this body
[1:36:26] like paul says there is there is another
[1:36:29] tabernacle
[1:36:31] that awaits us
[1:36:36] praise the lord
[1:36:39] there there are things that this
[1:36:42] tabernacle
[1:36:46] we lost praise the lord
[1:36:52] because he resurrected
[1:36:57] just like i said by a familiar voice
[1:37:00] mary magdalene recognized and even this
[1:37:04] man
[1:37:05] it was something that he did and the
[1:37:08] bible says
[1:37:09] their eyes open
[1:37:14] but their eyes were holding it was it
[1:37:16] was not
[1:37:17] it was not in a sense that god just
[1:37:19] blind them
[1:37:20] to not know him no there was something
[1:37:23] about the body that he was in that they
[1:37:25] could not
[1:37:26] identify him
[1:37:29] because he walked with them and said
[1:37:32] what manner of
[1:37:34] communication you guys are having
[1:37:38] and i said well are you a stranger here
[1:37:43] that you don't know all the things and
[1:37:45] and actually
[1:37:47] this distance they were they were uh
[1:37:49] traveling about
[1:37:51] three four long almost about three hours
[1:37:53] walk
[1:37:57] almost about three hours walk
[1:38:02] praise the lord
[1:38:07] and yet they could not identify him sure
[1:38:13] praise the lord
[1:38:21] do you see how the lord
[1:38:25] comes into the services
[1:38:30] and we don't identify him
[1:38:33] praise the lord the way we identified
[1:38:37] him
[1:38:37] is now by the emotion we feel
[1:38:40] the way we identify him is by a familiar
[1:38:43] voice
[1:38:45] his word
[1:38:48] praise the lord is by the preaching of
[1:38:51] the word
[1:38:52] he says yeah the law was really in our
[1:38:54] minds
[1:38:56] while the church world looks for
[1:38:58] something that will shiver their body
[1:39:00] sure says wow
[1:39:04] you know i enjoyed that music there was
[1:39:06] there was something that you know that
[1:39:08] went down my spine
[1:39:13] are we together i'm kind of i'm kind of
[1:39:16] frustrating all my talk here but
[1:39:18] it's it's okay i just get a few minutes
[1:39:20] here and i'll let you go
[1:39:23] just like i said it was just to come in
[1:39:26] uh you know and just
[1:39:27] appreciate every one of you for for all
[1:39:31] that you put into the meetings on the
[1:39:32] weekend
[1:39:33] but you see he he went down and there
[1:39:36] were there were some few things that
[1:39:37] brother brandon pointed out yeah that's
[1:39:38] what i wanted to
[1:39:39] for us to look at he says what matter of
[1:39:42] uh uh
[1:39:43] communication you're having
[1:39:47] you know as you walk one another and
[1:39:49] year aside and and one said clip i said
[1:39:52] i
[1:39:52] doubt only a stranger in jerusalem and
[1:39:55] have not known the things which have
[1:39:57] come to pass
[1:39:59] there in these days he said what think
[1:40:04] amen it says said unto him concerning
[1:40:07] jesus of nazareth which was a prophet
[1:40:10] mighty
[1:40:10] in these and words before god
[1:40:15] and all the prophets
[1:40:18] now brother branham said yeah
[1:40:32] and then jesus came he said
[1:40:35] on the road of myers on their first
[1:40:38] testimony
[1:40:40] when the whole world was
[1:40:44] in bloom of flowers and bobs and bees
[1:40:47] and homing on that beautiful april
[1:40:50] morning
[1:40:50] little did the disciples know that he
[1:40:54] he was raised from the dead and was
[1:40:57] among
[1:41:00] the resurrection and asked his friend
[1:41:03] cleopas
[1:41:04] and his friend was on the roll very much
[1:41:07] discouraged but they
[1:41:11] were pounding on the scriptures
[1:41:17] praise the lord now see right yet
[1:41:20] in the bible it says concerning jesus
[1:41:24] which was a prophet mighty
[1:41:28] in these and were before god
[1:41:31] that proved that they were on the
[1:41:33] scripture
[1:41:35] because if they were allowing their
[1:41:37] discouragement to drive them
[1:41:39] they would have said that that guy that
[1:41:42] was a capital son
[1:41:43] you know jesus you know i mean i mean
[1:41:46] that faker
[1:41:48] but because they were on the word even
[1:41:51] though they were discouraged but they
[1:41:52] were talking about the word
[1:41:55] they identified him by scripture
[1:41:58] that he was a prophet
[1:42:02] mighty in these and we're before
[1:42:05] god and all the people
[1:42:09] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[1:42:11] deliver him
[1:42:12] to be condemned to death and crucify him
[1:42:16] praise the lord
[1:42:20] amen so if they were just
[1:42:23] if they were just i mean just talking
[1:42:26] about their disappointment or
[1:42:27] you see i i lost my job i left my job
[1:42:30] because of that man and
[1:42:32] uh you know uh uh by this time i would
[1:42:34] have i
[1:42:35] would have been a millionaire you know i
[1:42:37] would have been rich if i would have
[1:42:38] just
[1:42:39] you know stayed with what i was doing if
[1:42:41] those were the things that they were
[1:42:42] talking about
[1:42:44] i mean they were just going to shun him
[1:42:46] away yeah you just forget about leave us
[1:42:48] alone go your way
[1:42:51] but brother branham says they were
[1:42:53] talking about the words
[1:42:57] they were remembering the meetings that
[1:42:59] they had
[1:43:01] you remember when he said this my
[1:43:04] goodness i was looking right into his
[1:43:06] face
[1:43:06] i mean my eyes could not even blink i
[1:43:09] saw him
[1:43:10] talk those breaths lift it up
[1:43:13] and bless it
[1:43:17] they were remembering the meetings
[1:43:20] they were talking about the things that
[1:43:23] was preached unto them
[1:43:30] praise the lord they were going back to
[1:43:32] their notes
[1:43:36] husband and wife was sharing their notes
[1:43:40] wow i didn't i didn't well i liked the
[1:43:43] way you wrote that thing down
[1:43:45] i never saw it like that i like it i
[1:43:46] enjoy it
[1:43:49] that's the way to sustain the presence
[1:43:52] of god
[1:43:55] when a people is blessed by god's
[1:43:57] presence
[1:43:58] the way to sustain his presence
[1:44:02] is to be talking about the word
[1:44:12] yeah the easter meeting was wonderful my
[1:44:14] goodness i enjoy the music
[1:44:16] oh my goodness we dance
[1:44:20] and we can talk about everything
[1:44:25] and cannot be able to find one place
[1:44:28] in the world that's too up to us
[1:44:40] praise the lord
[1:44:48] and he went on talking and we trusted
[1:44:51] that it had been he
[1:44:53] that that shu had redeemed israel
[1:44:57] they were discouraged but they stay
[1:45:01] having their faith in this man
[1:45:06] praise the lord
[1:45:10] and he went on talking
[1:45:15] setting went to the supreme court
[1:45:18] verse 24
[1:45:21] verse 25 then he said unto them all
[1:45:25] fools
[1:45:27] and slow
[1:45:30] of heart to believe all
[1:45:33] that the prophets have spoken
[1:45:39] all night christ to have suffered these
[1:45:42] things and to
[1:45:44] enter into his glory and beginning
[1:45:48] at moses and all the prophets
[1:45:51] he has he expounded onto them
[1:45:55] in all the scriptures
[1:45:58] all the scriptures
[1:46:03] all the scriptures he was not just he
[1:46:06] was not
[1:46:07] just uh talking about
[1:46:11] i mean you know the revival on my mount
[1:46:14] sauna all talking about
[1:46:15] you know what he did when he raised
[1:46:17] jairus daughter no
[1:46:19] he took them back to the world he took
[1:46:22] them back to
[1:46:23] the scripture back to the scripture
[1:46:34] it could have been easy for him to have
[1:46:37] just
[1:46:37] start reminding them you know you
[1:46:40] remember when i caught zacchaeus down
[1:46:42] from the tree
[1:46:42] and you know and just remembering that
[1:46:45] reminding them of all the things that
[1:46:47] have happened
[1:46:50] but no he took them back to
[1:46:54] the scripture beginning from
[1:46:57] moses when moses said the law your god
[1:47:01] will raise up
[1:47:02] a prophet
[1:47:07] joshua you remember the captain of the
[1:47:09] lord host the one that met joshua
[1:47:11] was the same one that met moses
[1:47:14] he took them from moses all through the
[1:47:18] prophets
[1:47:18] all the scripture he was not telling
[1:47:20] them of his life
[1:47:22] story he was putting them
[1:47:25] in the scripture
[1:47:31] praise the lord
[1:47:35] he was putting them in the scripture
[1:47:38] brother branham we use this very
[1:47:41] scripture to preach the message christ
[1:47:43] is the mystery of god reveal
[1:47:47] he will bring the scene of the road of
[1:47:51] of of of immigrants to preach the
[1:47:53] message crisis the minister of god
[1:47:55] revealed
[1:47:56] to let us to understand that everything
[1:48:00] that he has preached throughout all his
[1:48:02] ministry
[1:48:05] that only had one goal with a three four
[1:48:08] purpose
[1:48:11] praise the lord was everything that was
[1:48:14] in the scriptures
[1:48:18] praise the lord it was everything
[1:48:21] that was in the scripture
[1:48:26] people think when brother branham says
[1:48:29] the bible has become
[1:48:30] a new book it means that we should leave
[1:48:33] the bible
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:37] and only copy and paste quotes
[1:48:40] of three five pages no the bible has
[1:48:44] become a new book because
[1:48:47] when you are in the scriptures
[1:48:50] amen if you are in your bible if you are
[1:48:54] a lover of your bible the message of
[1:48:58] brother branham
[1:48:59] will fly out to you the things that
[1:49:03] brother branham has said will fly out
[1:49:05] that's what jesus was doing to this man
[1:49:09] that's right as he as he reminded them
[1:49:12] from moses
[1:49:13] throughout the prophets so the thing
[1:49:17] that
[1:49:17] christ did will fly out
[1:49:21] to them
[1:49:28] praise the lord what a manner of
[1:49:30] communication
[1:49:31] what are you talking about
[1:49:34] what are you talking about that's the
[1:49:36] thing were
[1:49:38] our young people supposed to be talking
[1:49:40] about
[1:49:41] i read this scripture in the bible mine
[1:49:44] my goodness
[1:49:45] could it be something of what brother
[1:49:48] ben was preaching on
[1:49:49] i read this scripture because every time
[1:49:53] when you read a scripture in the bible
[1:49:55] that you don't understand
[1:49:58] the reason why you don't understand it
[1:50:00] is because
[1:50:01] god is giving you an opportunity
[1:50:06] he's giving you an opportunity to
[1:50:09] for you to see him
[1:50:14] because when you read a scripture and
[1:50:16] you don't understand what this means
[1:50:19] if you just
[1:50:22] don't just jump over it and don't just
[1:50:25] cast it away from your mind
[1:50:29] but just say lord i wonder what this
[1:50:31] means
[1:50:33] i wonder what this means
[1:50:37] you see god coming right through the
[1:50:39] next service to tell you what it means
[1:50:41] or you will see god just allowing
[1:50:44] something to happen to you
[1:50:46] and we connect you every time
[1:50:54] praise the lord
[1:51:04] someone said to me that brother branham
[1:51:05] did not preach from that scripture i
[1:51:07] can't preach from it
[1:51:09] i said thierry from your bible then
[1:51:15] the interior from your bible
[1:51:20] if you are really in the scripture and
[1:51:23] you really
[1:51:24] listening to the message you will hear
[1:51:26] the scripture coming out all the time
[1:51:28] because brother branham talks about
[1:51:30] scripture and he don't say
[1:51:32] this is revelation 10 verse 7. he just
[1:51:34] talks about it as he goes along
[1:51:39] he just talks about it i was listening
[1:51:42] to the
[1:51:43] to brother branham he was talking about
[1:51:45] fellowship among the brethren he said
[1:51:47] because the blankets
[1:51:48] the blankets stretch a little wider
[1:51:52] and then he used a statement
[1:51:55] from isaiah the prophet but he did not
[1:51:58] cut it aside the prophet
[1:52:00] right but if you read outside the
[1:52:03] prophet you see where as i was talking
[1:52:04] about the
[1:52:05] blanket stretch a little farther
[1:52:21] that jesus came after his resurrection
[1:52:25] he never thought reminded him you
[1:52:27] remember when i felt five thousand
[1:52:29] no he took them back to the scripture
[1:52:35] moses said this isaiah said this
[1:52:39] praise the lord
[1:52:42] and that was that was the thing that
[1:52:44] captured him
[1:52:48] that when he when he actually says he
[1:52:51] was going he said can you can you stay
[1:52:53] with us
[1:52:54] they were captured by the scripture
[1:53:02] so he just needed to do something little
[1:53:05] for the eyes to come open right
[1:53:09] he just needed to do something little
[1:53:12] take the bread
[1:53:14] bless it and break it
[1:53:17] yeah and the eyes open
[1:53:20] oh my goodness this is our lord i've
[1:53:23] been walking with for three hours
[1:53:29] they're jumping over the chair i gotta
[1:53:31] go tell people
[1:53:36] but he used the scripture to capture
[1:53:39] them
[1:53:42] to capture them
[1:53:53] what matter of communication
[1:53:59] praise the lord
[1:54:06] brother branham says they were very much
[1:54:08] discouraged
[1:54:10] but they were pounding on the scripture
[1:54:13] did you notice while they were talking
[1:54:16] on the scripture he appears
[1:54:22] they were not talking on their
[1:54:24] disappointment
[1:54:26] this other person called and said
[1:54:28] believer they did this
[1:54:31] even peter he that was always dead he
[1:54:35] denied the lord jesus
[1:54:37] that's not why they were talking they
[1:54:39] were talking
[1:54:41] on the scriptures
[1:54:46] do you know that i read in the bible
[1:54:49] where the scripture says
[1:54:51] the view of the lord has eaten him i did
[1:54:54] not even know what that was
[1:54:57] until the day he took the whip because
[1:55:00] that's what the bible says
[1:55:01] when he got into the temple and started
[1:55:03] to whip them out the bible says
[1:55:05] the disciple the law brought to their
[1:55:07] mind
[1:55:08] what is written in the scripture that
[1:55:11] the
[1:55:12] view of the house has eaten me
[1:55:17] say that was the day that i honest to
[1:55:19] that
[1:55:24] praise the lord you read things in the
[1:55:27] scriptures you don't understand it
[1:55:30] just just keep loving the lord
[1:55:33] the lord is going to bring it to your
[1:55:35] mind
[1:55:37] open your understanding
[1:55:42] you just be listening to a tape
[1:55:46] and brother brandon would just say
[1:55:47] something and that scripture that you
[1:55:50] have read
[1:55:51] will just come open to your mind that's
[1:55:53] how the bible becomes a new book
[1:55:55] yes sir
[1:55:59] that's how the bible becomes a new book
[1:56:01] when the word becomes alive to you
[1:56:10] but we're not in love with the word
[1:56:13] that's the reason
[1:56:14] why even if we have brother branham yeah
[1:56:16] preaching for us
[1:56:19] all you go and talk about is that you
[1:56:23] know and he prayed for this girl
[1:56:25] and he prayed for that other person and
[1:56:28] he prayed for this other person
[1:56:30] you won't say nothing about the word
[1:56:32] because you are not in love with the
[1:56:34] word
[1:56:37] that's the thing that must interest us
[1:56:40] the word
[1:56:53] praise the lord
[1:56:58] oh my brother brahm says this now listen
[1:57:03] the presence of the lord jesus he says
[1:57:05] now listen closely brother and sisters
[1:57:07] there are many of you that jesus has
[1:57:10] talked to
[1:57:12] and you didn't realize it
[1:57:16] praise the lord amen
[1:57:21] how many of you that jesus has talked to
[1:57:25] and you didn't realize it
[1:57:30] he's here with us he's alive
[1:57:34] he come to you every night there
[1:57:37] and saying it's you i'm talking to
[1:57:42] especially when the preacher say that
[1:57:44] you i'm talking to
[1:57:49] i'm not preaching to the drums it's you
[1:57:50] that i'm talking to
[1:57:55] praise the lord but you see what we do
[1:57:57] is that
[1:57:58] we take what he's talking about and
[1:58:01] associate it with somebody else
[1:58:06] the lord and associate with somebody
[1:58:09] else and make that person to you
[1:58:12] we dodge the word like a bullet
[1:58:38] you can be made whole just accept it
[1:58:41] confess it and see what happened
[1:58:44] that's him talking to you he talked to
[1:58:46] them all day
[1:58:48] and he said why are you so sad and
[1:58:51] worried
[1:58:53] beautiful easter morning jesus is alive
[1:58:56] in the word from the resurrection
[1:58:58] first man was raised from the dead first
[1:59:01] fruit
[1:59:02] of them that slept so then walking along
[1:59:07] and they didn't know it and they went
[1:59:10] along and said well
[1:59:13] are you just a stranger here said jesus
[1:59:17] no said nor jesus of nazareth
[1:59:21] and then he began with the scripture and
[1:59:24] explained
[1:59:24] just exactly what jesus was supposed
[1:59:28] to do when he come
[1:59:32] now so if their interest was not in the
[1:59:35] world
[1:59:36] they would have stopped him
[1:59:39] they would have just stopped him
[1:59:43] but as he was talking about the
[1:59:45] scripture
[1:59:47] everything that he told them was it was
[1:59:49] being revived in them
[1:59:53] praise the lord amen
[2:00:02] glory be to god
[2:00:05] i'm telling you you can never understand
[2:00:07] brother brandon message if you are not
[2:00:08] in the scripture
[2:00:12] amen even our lord jesus when he came he
[2:00:15] said
[2:00:16] ses the scripture yes sir
[2:00:19] sesh the scripture in another sense if
[2:00:22] you will understand my ministry
[2:00:24] you must set the scripture right you
[2:00:27] must be
[2:00:28] in the scripture
[2:00:39] and then he begin with the scripture and
[2:00:41] explain just exactly what jesus was
[2:00:43] supposed to do
[2:00:45] when he come and when he went in a
[2:00:48] little house
[2:00:49] a little place where the sabbath day
[2:00:52] joining they started to go
[2:00:55] into an inn so he made out like he was
[2:00:59] going
[2:01:00] going on by he does that
[2:01:03] a lot of times
[2:01:07] he might have made our life he was going
[2:01:09] to pass you by
[2:01:11] tonight sonny this little girl here
[2:01:15] sitting here in the wheelchair you know
[2:01:18] and brother branham talks all of that
[2:01:24] just to see how much interest we have in
[2:01:28] the world
[2:01:31] sure we don't have to wait for devotion
[2:01:34] time before you pick up the bible to
[2:01:35] read
[2:01:38] praise the lord
[2:01:43] someone got healed i told you the story
[2:01:44] about that and you know

[2:01:48] healed of memory problem
[2:01:52] god heal her mind her mental problem
[2:01:58] by choosing to memorize scripture
[2:02:05] memorizing scripture you are keeping the
[2:02:07] lord
[2:02:08] on your mind that's what you are doing
[2:02:16] because the moment you try to do that
[2:02:19] you don't you you don't remember it
[2:02:21] after you have read a few times
[2:02:23] but you will realize that as you think
[2:02:26] about it you see you're thought trying
[2:02:28] to grab
[2:02:29] it right praise the lord
[2:02:32] i read a scripture this morning from the
[2:02:34] book of psalms
[2:02:35] and and it talks about the law of
[2:02:37] loving-kindness
[2:02:38] and how his loving-kindness is good to
[2:02:42] the children of
[2:02:42] men and all the children of men
[2:02:47] come under the shadow of his wings
[2:02:50] i was sitting there and i was meditating
[2:02:52] on that i said i said oh god
[2:02:54] you see all of these people go on the
[2:02:56] street and start to tell them about
[2:02:58] jesus christ they will get mad with you
[2:03:02] but they are going
[2:03:05] hoping that they will get locked
[2:03:09] they are hoping that they will get
[2:03:11] locked they're hoping
[2:03:13] i mean if if there's a god somewhere
[2:03:15] that he will make it away from me
[2:03:18] they they are trusting honor his wings
[2:03:25] they are trusting for for them to be
[2:03:29] hoping that this thing will work out
[2:03:31] hoping i would get i would get a job
[2:03:33] or hoping that i would get a business
[2:03:36] now i'm going to see this friend of mine
[2:03:38] he will be able to give me 20 bucks
[2:03:41] their hope that they have in them they
[2:03:43] are trusting honor his wings
[2:03:50] i was just sitting there and thinking
[2:03:51] about that i said oh god
[2:03:55] they don't know you and if you go tell
[2:03:58] them
[2:03:59] they don't want to know you but yet they
[2:04:02] are trusting
[2:04:02] under your wings
[2:04:06] trusting that god will open door for
[2:04:10] them
[2:04:12] i hope i'm really i'm really trusting i
[2:04:15] would get
[2:04:16] you know i would be able to get that
[2:04:17] position oh i really trust that i'll be
[2:04:19] able to get
[2:04:20] you know uh what you you just trust in
[2:04:22] honor his wings
[2:04:34] praise the lord
[2:04:37] so he acted like he he will go by and
[2:04:40] they constrain himself come in
[2:04:42] and abide with us you do the same now
[2:04:47] come in and abide with us
[2:04:50] so he come in as soon as he sat down
[2:04:56] the waiter come in and he brought the
[2:04:58] bread and jesus did something
[2:05:01] just a little different
[2:05:05] and the eyes were open and they
[2:05:08] recognize him
[2:05:10] and he vanished out of their sight
[2:05:14] praise the lord amen
[2:05:18] he vanished out of the assad he went
[2:05:21] to the other group of believers that
[2:05:23] were gathering together
[2:05:28] that was when he came through through
[2:05:31] the world
[2:05:35] and told them shalom peace be still
[2:05:42] and he thought that he was a spirit
[2:05:46] he says bring me bread
[2:05:51] praise the lord bring me bread
[2:05:56] bring me some fish
[2:05:59] he could eat in that body
[2:06:03] praise the lord
[2:06:07] amen but yet he could disappear
[2:06:11] and appear
[2:06:15] they're only corruptable things
[2:06:19] the only thing the bible says
[2:06:26] corruption cannot inherit incorruption
[2:06:30] the only corruptible thing in heaven
[2:06:34] is the nazca
[2:06:37] because brother branham says jesus he
[2:06:40] says
[2:06:41] god kept that body as a memorial
[2:06:46] sure
[2:06:50] he said god kept the nail scar body
[2:06:53] as a memorial just like ezra
[2:06:57] kept the body of joseph as a memorial
[2:07:01] sure and every time the look of the body
[2:07:03] knows that one day
[2:07:04] we will be out of here
[2:07:09] praise the lord
[2:07:19] what are we talking about young people
[2:07:25] what are we talking about what manner
[2:07:29] of communication
[2:07:33] are we having
[2:07:38] sometimes that's what you said
[2:07:41] you know the lord realized the law spoke
[2:07:44] to me
[2:07:45] you will realize that every time that
[2:07:48] god will speak to you in a service
[2:07:50] will be something about the word
[2:07:54] that either you were thinking about or
[2:07:57] you were reading
[2:07:58] or you were listening talk something of
[2:08:01] the word where god was
[2:08:03] already dealing with you then he comes
[2:08:06] back and used the preacher
[2:08:09] to bring that thing up
[2:08:16] praise the lord
[2:08:20] what manner of communication
[2:08:24] that we should be having after
[2:08:27] an easter service like the one that we
[2:08:34] had
[2:08:37] what manner of communication
[2:08:41] i mean if the people are really in the
[2:08:43] word
[2:08:44] if the people are really taking those
[2:08:46] messages
[2:08:48] go back on on youtube instead of looking
[2:08:51] at all the funny things we look and go
[2:08:52] then and play those messages
[2:08:54] you realize that the holy spirit sees
[2:08:57] the interest of the people
[2:08:59] he take this the the services that is
[2:09:02] coming right from the eastern meeting
[2:09:04] and just take you up
[2:09:09] but if we don't have interest in the
[2:09:10] world why should god give us the word
[2:09:16] why should god bring bring something to
[2:09:18] to to make you
[2:09:19] uh uh uh uh excited or or anxious or
[2:09:23] or i mean uh increase your spiritual
[2:09:25] appetite when you don't have interest in
[2:09:27] the word
[2:09:32] praise the lord it is not
[2:09:35] the amen that you say amen preach it is
[2:09:38] not the thing that pulls on the preacher
[2:09:40] the thing that pulls on the preacher is
[2:09:43] your desire for the word
[2:09:45] the desire that you have in your heart
[2:09:50] that's what pulls on the preacher those
[2:09:53] things you've been reading
[2:09:55] those things you've been praying to god
[2:09:57] for answers
[2:09:58] that's the thing that pulls on the
[2:09:59] preacher it's not it's not out of the
[2:10:01] assault preacher
[2:10:02] preach it
[2:10:11] because some of those yelling there just
[2:10:13] i mean
[2:10:16] praise the lord
[2:10:26] the preacher can't even stream you jump
[2:10:28] out of sleep and you yell
[2:10:32] i don't even know nothing he said it's
[2:10:34] because you were sleeping
[2:10:36] right yes amen you just woke up
[2:10:43] the things that pulled on the preacher
[2:10:48] is the thing that you do out of service
[2:10:54] when you are praying you are reading the
[2:10:56] word
[2:10:58] you are putting things before god
[2:11:02] it is those things that pulled on the
[2:11:08] preacher
[2:11:10] what manner of communication
[2:11:14] what are the things that we should be
[2:11:16] talking about
[2:11:23] musicians you can come tonight
[2:11:50] uh
[2:12:04] we
[2:12:13] we have those services
[2:12:17] on the little website that we have and
[2:12:20] on youtube

[2:12:40] person in the world you're just looking
[2:12:41] at one another

[2:12:47] oh yeah yeah she was in church yeah i
[2:12:50] can see her sitting down there
