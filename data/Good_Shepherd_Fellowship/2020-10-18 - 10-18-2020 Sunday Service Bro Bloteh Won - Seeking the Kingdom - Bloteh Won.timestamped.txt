[49:36] group shepherd that we wanted to do for
[49:38] our coming prayer meeting the last
[49:40] saturday of the month
[49:41] so it just came to my mind
[49:44] i don't want to forget praise the lord
[49:49] amen i got in trouble on wednesday night
[49:52] i don't want to get in trouble again
[49:54] amen
[49:55] praise the lord see luke chapter 12
[50:04] it's in luke chapter 12 of weku we could
[50:07] read
[50:08] right there from verse 22 jesus saying
[50:12] and he said to his disciple therefore i
[50:14] say unto you
[50:15] take no thought of your life what you
[50:18] shall eat neither
[50:20] for your body what you shall put on
[50:23] the life is more than the meat
[50:26] and the body more than the raymond then
[50:29] we can go
[50:30] through the rest of the structure you
[50:32] get a concept of it but let's drop to
[50:33] verse 31
[50:35] that's what we want to do
[50:39] verse 31
[50:42] but seek but rather seek ye the kingdom
[50:47] of god and all
[50:51] these things shall be added unto you
[50:54] let me read that again but rather seek
[50:56] ye the kingdom of god
[50:59] and all these things shall be added onto
[51:02] you
[51:03] fear that little flaws for it is
[51:06] your father good pleasure to give you
[51:09] the kingdom
[51:10] praise the lord the lord bless you you
[51:12] can have your seed
[51:13] while we turn to sin luke chapter 17
[51:18] praise the lord
[51:22] it's in luke chapter 17
[51:25] amen this morning
[51:28] we want to we want to
[51:35] i continue i was taught from last sunday
[51:37] but i i want to go
[51:38] a little bit of a different direction in
[51:41] the sense
[51:42] of uh trying to
[51:47] uh i mean last week we were trying to
[51:49] expose
[51:50] the kingdom of darkness and we were
[51:53] trying to go after the little foxes that
[51:55] spoiled the vine
[51:57] and
[51:59] [Music]
[52:01] today we want to we want to just use a
[52:04] little
[52:04] topic here or if we can call it a tie to
[52:07] seeking the kingdom
[52:09] but i want us to just look at the way
[52:11] that the apostle
[52:13] uh is is uh is dealing with this and
[52:17] bringing it to us now
[52:18] sin luke chapter 17 you look in luke
[52:21] chapter 17
[52:24] praise the lord let's read from verse
[52:27] 20 from verse 20 luke chapter 17 from
[52:31] verse 20.
[52:33] now as we read this what i want you to
[52:36] also keep
[52:36] in your mind this is in the very same
[52:39] chapter
[52:40] where the revelation of the son of man
[52:42] is going to come out
[52:44] what jesus talked about as it was in the
[52:46] days of lord so will the son of man
[52:49] be revealed amen and and we know
[52:53] that uh uh uh this
[52:56] this this end time ministry has been
[52:59] identified by that scripture
[53:02] this is one of the revered truth that we
[53:04] are following we have
[53:05] we have seen the manifestation of the
[53:08] son of man
[53:09] to bring the manifestation of the sons
[53:13] of god
[53:15] amen the reason why god brought a
[53:18] ministry
[53:19] that manifested the son of man is
[53:21] because
[53:22] the creation has been waiting for the
[53:24] manifestation
[53:26] of the sons of god so the ministry
[53:29] of the son of man was a wave sheath
[53:34] to say i have got one man in my hands
[53:37] submitted to the word the word of god
[53:41] and there are many more to come
[53:44] are we together now so so keep that in
[53:47] your mind
[53:48] see luke 17 30 is just behind the verses
[53:51] that we are going to read so as
[53:55] as we read that you will be able to uh
[53:58] to to uh i hope that the holy spirit can
[54:01] do
[54:02] most of the preaching then you know then
[54:04] the work will be easy amen
[54:08] praise the lord verse 20 and when
[54:11] he was demanded of the pharisees
[54:15] when the kingdom of god should come he
[54:18] answered them
[54:19] and said the kingdom of god
[54:23] cometh not
[54:26] with observation amen
[54:30] the kingdom of god cometh not with
[54:33] observation
[54:35] neither shall they say low year
[54:38] or low there for behold
[54:42] the kingdom of god is in you
[54:46] amen the kingdom of god is in you
[54:52] he says that and then the disciple
[54:55] and he said unto his disciple the days
[54:58] will come
[54:59] when ye shall desire to see one of the
[55:02] days of the son of man
[55:04] now he's going now into the son of man
[55:06] subject
[55:07] to talk dead but he have already
[55:09] established
[55:10] something here to the disciples about
[55:13] the kingdom of god
[55:14] it's not coming by observation amen
[55:17] then my question is how do we seek the
[55:20] kingdom then
[55:22] in luke year chapter 12 he said we
[55:25] should seek here first the kingdom of
[55:27] god
[55:28] now you see many of the time when this
[55:30] scripture is used and as it has been
[55:33] used seek year first the kingdom of god
[55:36] is always something we are looking for
[55:38] outside
[55:40] people seek the kingdom of god looking
[55:42] for a better church
[55:44] a better pastor amen they seek the
[55:47] kingdom of god looking for where the
[55:48] miracles
[55:49] are they seek the kingdom of god but
[55:51] jesus saying here is not by observation
[55:57] it's not by observation
[56:02] the lord because the unseen
[56:05] are internal the things that are
[56:07] internal they are unseen
[56:11] are we together amen
[56:14] the things that are internal the ones
[56:18] that
[56:18] adorable praise the lord
[56:22] they are unseen
[56:26] the ones that are real they are unseen
[56:31] praise the lord the ones that are
[56:34] praise the lord praise the lord
[56:40] ah praise the lord so how do we seek the
[56:43] kingdom
[56:45] so if you take this thought of the
[56:48] kingdom of god
[56:50] not in observation and take it back
[56:54] to say luke chapter seven
[56:58] then it makes you to think yeah jesus is
[57:01] talking about don't think about raymond
[57:03] don't think about food those
[57:05] are those are things that we observe
[57:09] those are natural that appear
[57:12] to our observation but he says seek ye
[57:16] the kingdom of god
[57:23] praise the lord
[57:26] is that a is that a good food for todd
[57:30] amen
[57:33] oh look at the look at the ladies of the
[57:35] field look at the birds
[57:36] the heavenly father take care of them
[57:39] you are more valued than those things
[57:46] praise the lord just like i said uh
[57:49] uh last sunday i mean right now
[57:53] as as we are in in i mean
[57:56] in the fellowship of the world there is
[57:59] such an anointing that is on us
[58:02] that this thing become so real
[58:06] and and and our desire is is more of god
[58:10] as soon as we get out of this anointing
[58:12] you know the phone bills
[58:14] the rain bills you know
[58:17] our our credit score and our finance
[58:22] everything starts to appear then we
[58:24] start looking around again
[58:28] praise the lord amen
[58:33] so while we have the anointing let's
[58:34] dash into it
[58:36] i mean let's dash into it don't just put
[58:40] your feet i mean go
[58:41] there your head under dash into it
[58:46] now before it dry up
[58:50] you'll be able to drive and reach home
[58:51] amen because sometimes as soon as you
[58:54] get behind the wheel
[58:57] then all the floods of our earthly knees
[59:00] starts to come
[59:02] i'm going back to the house again oh i
[59:05] have to go back to work
[59:10] praise the lord so let's let's
[59:13] let's let's work on that a little bit
[59:16] because that's why we want to
[59:18] we want to look at the the the kingdom
[59:20] of god
[59:22] you know the seeking the kingdom you
[59:24] know
[59:25] and uh if the kingdom
[59:29] is not coming by observation
[59:33] if the kingdom is not low year that
[59:36] church
[59:36] low year that preacher if the kingdom of
[59:40] god
[59:41] is already in you which of course
[59:44] the right uh expression there the
[59:48] kingdom of god is in your midst
[59:53] praise the lord the kingdom of god is in
[59:56] your midst
[1:00:00] that's why he was telling the disciple
[1:00:01] one of these days
[1:00:03] you would desire it because now it's in
[1:00:06] your midst you're not valuing it
[1:00:11] but for you to have these things it
[1:00:14] would have to be
[1:00:15] the revealing of the son of man
[1:00:18] which is a promise to the gentiles
[1:00:24] praise the lord
[1:00:29] that's the reason why when we have god
[1:00:32] moving in our midst
[1:00:33] if he's dealing with your life hold
[1:00:36] tight to him
[1:00:38] you are the hope that i cling to amen
[1:00:42] you mean more than this life to me
[1:00:47] if god is is moving in your home
[1:00:50] sustain his presence
[1:00:54] if god is dealing with you in the world
[1:00:56] don't take it as your smartness or your
[1:00:59] cleverness
[1:01:00] it's grace unto you it's a visitation
[1:01:05] and the thing that makes your visitor
[1:01:08] always come back
[1:01:09] is the way you treat him
[1:01:13] so if he's visiting you you better be
[1:01:16] kind
[1:01:17] you better pay attention
[1:01:21] praise the lord
[1:01:27] are we together seeking the kingdom
[1:01:32] seeking the kingdom that's that is that
[1:01:34] is my thought that is out there
[1:01:36] and uh that's my thought that is out
[1:01:39] there but i want to
[1:01:40] i want to use uh
[1:01:43] i want to use this also oneness
[1:01:47] uh i have a few
[1:01:50] culture from oneness but let's let's
[1:01:52] take this also oneness
[1:01:54] and uh uh look closely
[1:01:57] uh first corinthians chapter 4 verse 20
[1:02:02] says the kingdom of god
[1:02:06] is his word made
[1:02:09] power the kingdom of god
[1:02:13] is his word may power can we read there
[1:02:17] first corinthians
[1:02:18] chapter 4 verse 20.
[1:02:28] are we together
[1:02:37] i know you had me all over the place
[1:02:39] last week
[1:02:40] um just trying to behave a little bit
[1:02:43] here
[1:02:46] for the kingdom of god is not
[1:02:50] in words but in power
[1:02:55] amen the kingdom of god
[1:02:58] is not in words but in power and yet the
[1:03:01] prophet of god says the kingdom of god
[1:03:03] is the word of god
[1:03:06] in power
[1:03:09] the word of god made power
[1:03:12] jesus uh there in acts chapter 1
[1:03:16] and you shall receive the holy ghost
[1:03:19] you shall receive power from on high is
[1:03:23] that what the scripture says
[1:03:24] you shall receive power from unhind sin
[1:03:27] john chapter 1
[1:03:28] he came unto his own and his own receive
[1:03:30] him that but many that are receiving he
[1:03:33] has given them what
[1:03:34] power
[1:03:37] amen he has given them power
[1:03:41] so the kingdom of god is the word of god
[1:03:44] in power because you have to know
[1:03:48] paul talking to timothy he says they
[1:03:50] will have the form of godliness
[1:03:53] but what deny the power
[1:03:57] they will have the form of godliness and
[1:03:59] call themselves
[1:04:00] you know we are christians and just
[1:04:02] because they belonging to the church
[1:04:04] but that power is not there
[1:04:09] that power is not there so the kingdom
[1:04:12] of god does not come by
[1:04:13] observation the kingdom of god is in you
[1:04:17] is the power of god in your midst
[1:04:20] the power of god kicking out doubts and
[1:04:23] fear
[1:04:24] amen amen the power of god
[1:04:28] charging you praise the lord
[1:04:32] we will see as we as we go along you
[1:04:35] know
[1:04:36] i'm trying to i mean i'm doing my best
[1:04:38] not to get uh
[1:04:40] uh you know some of mine uh i don't know
[1:04:43] how to call it now
[1:04:44] i just i want i want as far as to for
[1:04:46] you to follow me a little bit
[1:04:47] you know you you get uh excited and then
[1:04:50] you're going all over the place
[1:04:52] you know and then and then sometimes uh
[1:04:55] it's it's it's a bit difficult to drive
[1:04:58] the top but i i want us to
[1:05:01] to be able to just just look at this in
[1:05:04] the scripture look at it in the word
[1:05:06] because the reason is that uh uh
[1:05:09] uh last week we were talking about
[1:05:12] people that sat in darkness great light
[1:05:14] has shined onto us amen
[1:05:16] and we were bringing the thought of uh
[1:05:18] you know trying to deal
[1:05:20] with our our our um
[1:05:24] you know our natural birth you know our
[1:05:28] natural birth and the new birth which is
[1:05:30] the light that has shined
[1:05:31] onto us and the purpose of that light
[1:05:34] is to be able to push out this darkness
[1:05:39] amen is to be able to push out this
[1:05:41] darkness because by our
[1:05:43] natural birth we were born under the
[1:05:46] praise
[1:05:47] of the power of this world praise the
[1:05:50] lord
[1:05:51] are we together and then uh
[1:05:55] i will come in here and say i i believe
[1:05:58] it was a good service on wednesday night
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:01] you believe that praise the lord you
[1:06:04] appreciated the word because uh
[1:06:06] uh uh there were some things
[1:06:10] that uh uh
[1:06:14] i wanted to have commented on wednesday
[1:06:16] night but
[1:06:18] i didn't want to keep you in any longer
[1:06:20] then we have stayed but
[1:06:24] it was beautiful to be able to see how
[1:06:26] the holy spirit
[1:06:27] is is telling us to listen
[1:06:32] it's beautiful you know to realize that
[1:06:36] the holy spirit is telling you pay
[1:06:37] attention
[1:06:38] listening hear the word of god
[1:06:43] praise the lord amen
[1:06:47] yeah the word of god i was going to
[1:06:49] share this with you on wednesday night
[1:06:52] and that is from the church age book
[1:06:57] he mentioned this and you will recall
[1:06:59] that i mentioned at the beginning
[1:07:01] of this message that this book we are
[1:07:05] studying
[1:07:06] which is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:07:08] is the actual
[1:07:09] revelation of jesus himself
[1:07:13] in the church and his work
[1:07:16] in the future age it is just not
[1:07:20] an idea is god among
[1:07:24] his people that's that's that's what we
[1:07:29] want to emphasize the kingdom of god
[1:07:32] is with you the kingdom of god is within
[1:07:34] you
[1:07:35] god is in your midst praise the lord
[1:07:39] amen god is in your midst and if god is
[1:07:43] in your mess
[1:07:44] then you you have to believe it you have
[1:07:47] to live like he's in your midst
[1:07:49] praise the lord
[1:07:53] we have to live like he's in our midst
[1:07:55] not just by
[1:07:56] rules and fear all god is here he will
[1:07:59] strike me to death
[1:08:00] but yeah i mean we we have we have to
[1:08:03] believe him
[1:08:04] we have to realize whenever the enemy
[1:08:06] come you know in as a flaw the spirit of
[1:08:09] god will raise up astander
[1:08:14] praise the lord and the thing about it
[1:08:17] there is that
[1:08:18] darkness will never overcome light for
[1:08:21] it cannot comprehend light
[1:08:24] amen darkness will never overcome light
[1:08:28] for it cannot comprehend life that's the
[1:08:30] reason why
[1:08:31] if if there is any kind of a dark
[1:08:34] feeling
[1:08:34] sadness worry fear comes and the light
[1:08:38] is there it must kick it out
[1:08:43] you cannot go in that gloominess day
[1:08:46] after day and day after day
[1:08:48] and day after day then there is
[1:08:52] a problem if you tell me that light is
[1:08:54] dead
[1:08:55] because for the mother of five i don't
[1:08:57] care how little that light is
[1:09:01] darkness cannot comprehend it darkness
[1:09:04] my lingered around
[1:09:06] darkness my cast shadow because of a
[1:09:09] little light but at the end of the day
[1:09:11] it must go away
[1:09:13] that's what we are talking about
[1:09:17] that's the thing we are talking about
[1:09:20] that's that is the place where we are
[1:09:22] that is the power that is in the church
[1:09:28] that is the power that is in the church
[1:09:30] because we are coming to the place
[1:09:33] we are coming to this place
[1:09:37] of dispensation of church age of what
[1:09:40] god is doing
[1:09:40] of the place we see the word now
[1:09:45] praise the lord
[1:09:48] we're the church we need to stand on
[1:09:51] every word of god
[1:09:56] your good idea will not work
[1:10:00] it has to be the word of god
[1:10:08] and as a son of god as a daughter of god
[1:10:11] you must be born to take that word
[1:10:15] you must be bold to take that word
[1:10:18] because the word
[1:10:20] you are part of the word and that day
[1:10:22] you will know that i was
[1:10:24] in the father i in you you in me
[1:10:33] you are not just a church member that
[1:10:35] has a good king james bible
[1:10:39] but this word is becoming a written
[1:10:42] episode amen
[1:10:43] this world is sticking on flesh
[1:10:49] it's taking on flesh and it does not
[1:10:51] have it
[1:10:52] it does not have no flesh to take on
[1:10:55] beside the flesh that gives a
[1:10:57] preeminence to the word
[1:11:02] are we together
[1:11:05] so it's it's the actual revelation of
[1:11:08] jesus himself
[1:11:10] in the church and his work in the future
[1:11:13] age
[1:11:17] praise the lord
[1:11:21] and his work in the future age
[1:11:27] praise the lord
[1:11:31] i
[1:11:36] i got him for caught caught here a
[1:11:38] little bit
[1:11:40] but uh let me show you something in
[1:11:42] revelation
[1:11:43] chapter one as we as we're talking about
[1:11:45] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:11:47] i know we we we almost spent uh
[1:11:51] a couple of weeks a month on there
[1:11:53] revelation chapter 1.
[1:11:55] i don't want to go back to it again but
[1:11:57] you know the word of god is internal
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:01] so i mean it's not really you making the
[1:12:03] choice what you want to do on that
[1:12:05] it's just god that is that it's making
[1:12:09] and uh
[1:12:12] i was i was going to uh
[1:12:17] i was going to uh i've been thinking
[1:12:21] about
[1:12:22] bringing this up in a way uh
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:26] for us to be able to see here
[1:12:30] but what i want to what i want to what i
[1:12:32] want to show you is that
[1:12:37] when you read revelation chapter 1 verse
[1:12:40] 9 i
[1:12:41] john who also am your brother companion
[1:12:44] in tribulation
[1:12:45] and and in the kingdom impatient of
[1:12:48] jesus christ
[1:12:49] our on the outside that is called patmos
[1:12:51] for the word of god in the testimony of
[1:12:53] jesus christ i was in the spirit on the
[1:12:55] last day
[1:12:56] and he started going right there and
[1:12:58] jesus yeah in verse
[1:12:59] 11 introducing himself i'm the alpha
[1:13:02] main guy the first and the last
[1:13:05] and he says and what thou see
[1:13:08] it right and send it on to
[1:13:11] the the seven churches which are in
[1:13:15] asia then the seven churches come follow
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:22] verse 12. this is what i want to get you
[1:13:24] now
[1:13:25] uh a little bit here verse 12 and i
[1:13:28] turn to see the voice
[1:13:32] that speak with me and being turned
[1:13:36] being turned is an action word i turn
[1:13:40] amen i turn so right here
[1:13:44] if if we want to put this into emotion
[1:13:46] if we want to put these
[1:13:48] these words into emotion now
[1:13:51] john was showing the church this uh uh
[1:13:54] you know he was showing the church here
[1:13:57] and
[1:13:57] jesus speaking he says i was in the
[1:14:00] spirit
[1:14:01] on the lost day and behind me
[1:14:04] a great verb a great voice as a trumpet
[1:14:08] said i'm the alpha and omega you know
[1:14:11] the voice is speaking
[1:14:12] and he says now he turned to see the
[1:14:15] voice
[1:14:16] now so prophetically john
[1:14:20] from from from verse one the
[1:14:22] continuation the future work of jesus
[1:14:25] john has gone through the church ages
[1:14:28] but by jesus introduction amen
[1:14:32] so he's at an end of the age
[1:14:36] and yet he hear a voice and he's turning
[1:14:39] back to look at the age
[1:14:41] amen the reason why is prophetically
[1:14:44] wrong because the revelation
[1:14:46] of the the revelation of the book of
[1:14:49] revelation
[1:14:50] came at the last age
[1:14:54] so he's at the end of the age turning
[1:14:57] back
[1:14:58] now you will see where this uh
[1:15:00] revelation chapter
[1:15:02] uh uh uh uh revelation
[1:15:05] 1 12 and revelation 4
[1:15:09] one connects
[1:15:14] amen where revelation four one connects
[1:15:18] is the other uh a revelation four one
[1:15:21] uh john is told to come up higher
[1:15:26] so he's at the end of the age after he
[1:15:29] was
[1:15:30] turned back to look at the age and look
[1:15:33] at the things that is in the age
[1:15:36] and everything of the church ages has
[1:15:38] been shown to him
[1:15:41] then the rapture revelation 4 1.
[1:15:46] praise the lord amen i know i'm
[1:15:49] completely
[1:15:50] i'm i'm kind of got out of out of
[1:15:54] subject year but i'm trying to create
[1:15:56] this picture
[1:15:57] so you will see prophetically where we
[1:16:00] are
[1:16:02] at the end of the gentile age is not
[1:16:04] just a phrase
[1:16:08] it's not a slogan it's right
[1:16:11] in the in the word
[1:16:15] praise the lord
[1:16:20] he was in the spirit so in the spirit we
[1:16:24] travel faster than in the flesh
[1:16:27] in the spirit in the lord's day he has
[1:16:30] gone
[1:16:31] through the churches as jesus saying
[1:16:33] write these things
[1:16:34] onto the church or ephesus on two days
[1:16:37] he's going through one egg she's going
[1:16:38] through another end she's going through
[1:16:40] the end of age then he says then i turn
[1:16:44] to see the voice so he was in
[1:16:48] that turning position
[1:16:51] when he saw chapter two and chapter
[1:16:54] three
[1:16:55] when chapter two and chapter three was
[1:16:58] revealed to him because he's looking at
[1:16:59] the one that is talking to him
[1:17:03] and after all of those things is now
[1:17:06] told john
[1:17:07] revelation 4 1 comes which is the
[1:17:09] rapture
[1:17:10] come up higher
[1:17:14] praise the lord now the reason why i say
[1:17:16] this is because
[1:17:18] uh uh we are living in such a season
[1:17:23] we are living in such a time that uh
[1:17:26] uh the things that has been preached to
[1:17:30] us the word that we have read
[1:17:32] the things that we have seen in the
[1:17:34] scripture
[1:17:35] are going to
[1:17:38] be manifested in our days
[1:17:43] praise the lord and we have to prepare
[1:17:45] for it
[1:17:46] we have to be prepared for it
[1:17:50] so okay is this statement i brought me
[1:17:52] to all of there
[1:17:53] sorry if uh if i kind of distracted you
[1:17:56] a little bit amen
[1:17:57] then i mentioned that it would take the
[1:17:59] holy the holy spirit to give us
[1:18:01] revelation or we will fail to get it
[1:18:03] bringing these two thoughts together
[1:18:05] what are the two thoughts jesus
[1:18:07] in in the midst of his church amen
[1:18:11] and even though he's in the midst of the
[1:18:12] church it will take the holy ghost in
[1:18:14] you for you to understand what he's
[1:18:16] doing
[1:18:18] is the two thoughts that he's bringing
[1:18:20] together is jesus
[1:18:22] literally walking in the midst of the
[1:18:25] the seven golden candlesticks is jesus
[1:18:27] in his church praise the lord
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:35] bringing these two thoughts together he
[1:18:38] says
[1:18:39] you will see that it won't take
[1:18:42] just ordinary steady and
[1:18:46] thinking to make this book real
[1:18:50] it will not take ordinary the reason why
[1:18:54] is because the words in this book is
[1:18:57] jumping out and becoming flesh
[1:19:01] it's not it's not just a book
[1:19:07] praise the lord the words in this book
[1:19:10] you could have the book in your hands
[1:19:12] and the word has already become flesh
[1:19:15] amen it's just like jesus
[1:19:18] luke chapter 4 he took the book from the
[1:19:20] priest he opened
[1:19:22] the book and he read this day this
[1:19:24] scripture is fulfilled
[1:19:25] he closed the book he gave it to the
[1:19:27] priest he sat down the bible said
[1:19:29] all eyes was on him
[1:19:32] the the words from the book jumped out
[1:19:35] became flesh
[1:19:37] he's telling them that this day this
[1:19:40] word
[1:19:41] has become flesh right before you
[1:19:44] huh huh
[1:20:04] it won't take just ordinary study
[1:20:07] and thinking to make this book real
[1:20:11] because people can think i mean men has
[1:20:15] thought
[1:20:15] and they have brought all sorts of
[1:20:17] things out of this book
[1:20:20] praise the lord
[1:20:25] amen they have thought about it until
[1:20:28] they have even made satan safe
[1:20:36] it will not take steady
[1:20:42] he is going to take the operation
[1:20:45] of the holy ghost i'm going to emphasize
[1:20:48] that
[1:20:48] this morning the operation of the holy
[1:20:51] ghost
[1:20:52] that means this book can be revealed to
[1:20:56] anyone
[1:20:56] but a special class of people
[1:21:00] a special class of people
[1:21:04] a special class of people
[1:21:08] what is that matthew chapter 13
[1:21:12] where jesus pulled his disciple aside
[1:21:15] and says the parable the the the meaning
[1:21:18] of this parable is this
[1:21:22] he said i spoke to them in parables but
[1:21:24] to you i speak plainly
[1:21:26] because they were a special class of
[1:21:29] people
[1:21:32] are we together
[1:21:38] that means this book can be revealed to
[1:21:40] anybody but a special class of people
[1:21:43] listening to this it would take one
[1:21:46] with a prophetic insight
[1:21:51] it would take one with a prophetic
[1:21:54] insight
[1:21:58] it will require
[1:22:01] the ability to hear
[1:22:04] from god
[1:22:08] it will require the ability
[1:22:11] to hear from god
[1:22:17] amen praise the lord
[1:22:20] it will require the ability this this
[1:22:23] this special class of people
[1:22:25] and and this ability and this prophetic
[1:22:28] side
[1:22:28] is just like having a little you know a
[1:22:31] kind of a little radio
[1:22:33] in in in the wilderness
[1:22:36] and you can tune the frequency
[1:22:39] and you keep tuning you keep getting
[1:22:42] yourself in turn
[1:22:44] because you want to listen to the news
[1:22:48] praise the lord as that's the same thing
[1:22:50] that is happening
[1:22:51] there are voices that are going voice
[1:22:53] waves
[1:22:54] that is going through this building
[1:22:58] amen but this morning we are tuned to
[1:23:00] listening to the holy ghost
[1:23:02] not to listen to voices i mean that want
[1:23:06] us to carry our shopping and voices that
[1:23:08] want to carry us
[1:23:09] into other things we are tuning
[1:23:10] ourselves
[1:23:12] to be able to hear the voice of god
[1:23:15] and that ability is given to you
[1:23:20] that ability to hear from god
[1:23:29] praise the lord because that's the place
[1:23:31] that we are coming to
[1:23:33] that's the hour that is upon us
[1:23:40] to hear from god not just not just
[1:23:43] putting
[1:23:44] our feelings to things

[1:23:51] feelings to things

[1:25:40] and uh and and and that ability so yeah
[1:25:43] and i i i i think that that was that was
[1:25:46] a beautiful

[1:25:49] just to see you know
[1:25:50] the the the moving of the spirit yeah
[1:25:52] you ever say we just talk about a
[1:25:54] greater battle
[1:25:55] ever thought that's that's that's part
[1:25:56] of the battle also
[1:25:58] are we listening to ourself or are we
[1:26:00] listening to god
[1:26:02] it's all part of the greater battle that
[1:26:04] we are in
[1:26:10] but you have to we have to remember that
[1:26:13] this
[1:26:13] manifested songs will be the one that
[1:26:16] gave the word preeminence in their life
[1:26:20] praise the lord it will be the one that
[1:26:23] gave the word preeminence in your life
[1:26:26] not my will but let your will be done
[1:26:31] praise the lord as we see through the
[1:26:33] scripture so i'm trying to take my time
[1:26:35] here
[1:26:36] as we look at this subject of seeking
[1:26:38] the kingdom
[1:26:39] we have long been seeking it throughout
[1:26:41] all the all the ages
[1:26:43] we've been seeking the kingdom outside
[1:26:46] we've been seeking the kingdom outside
[1:26:48] of the kingdom
[1:26:50] amen we've been seeking the kingdom
[1:26:53] outside of the kingdom
[1:26:58] praise the lord why because we
[1:27:01] we have been thinking about god's
[1:27:03] kingdom just like just like the
[1:27:05] disciples
[1:27:07] lord is this the time for your kingdom
[1:27:10] that's why they told jesus
[1:27:13] all of these all of these uh jewish
[1:27:16] believers
[1:27:18] you know after they after they have
[1:27:21] they have believed jesus ministry and
[1:27:23] they have they started seeing the signs
[1:27:25] of the
[1:27:26] the messiah nathaniel came philip jesus
[1:27:29] descended them
[1:27:30] and you know a man will fight guilt and
[1:27:34] call them by name
[1:27:35] he says well this is the messiah they
[1:27:37] started seeing his ministry and all of
[1:27:39] that
[1:27:41] but there was there was a trench
[1:27:44] in their mind the trench that was in
[1:27:48] their mind
[1:27:50] we have to get away we have to get rid
[1:27:52] of these romans
[1:27:56] praise the lord
[1:27:59] they come to jesus and brought him a
[1:28:02] queen
[1:28:04] and said master should we pay
[1:28:07] should we pay tribute praise the lord
[1:28:11] why would they ask jesus that question
[1:28:14] a part of them that is still rebelling
[1:28:16] against the roman government
[1:28:20] amen there will always be a part of
[1:28:24] us
[1:28:27] that we struggle with our self there
[1:28:30] will
[1:28:30] always be a part of us
[1:28:34] amen there will always be pool to this
[1:28:39] but you are given the power to bring it
[1:28:41] back in line
[1:28:44] praise the lord you are given the power
[1:28:47] to bring it back in line that's where
[1:28:51] the overcoming
[1:28:52] is the overcoming is not you being free
[1:28:55] from sin don't lie to yourself you will
[1:28:56] never be
[1:28:57] the overcoming is you catching yourself
[1:29:01] in a moment
[1:29:03] and bringing yourself in subject to the
[1:29:05] word
[1:29:09] praise the lord is you telling yourself
[1:29:13] oh god help me oh j help me please
[1:29:17] father please help me
[1:29:19] forgive me it's you catching yourself in
[1:29:22] the moment
[1:29:25] and bringing yourself in suggestion to
[1:29:28] the world
[1:29:33] are we together praise the lord
[1:29:36] so that's that's where we that's what we
[1:29:39] want to look at here

[1:30:15] praise the lord
[1:30:19] we we read this before and i just i just
[1:30:23] throw it in here
[1:30:24] because all of these are just reminders
[1:30:26] but they will help us get to where we
[1:30:28] want to
[1:30:28] where we want to go amen
[1:30:32] i'm persuaded that many of us want us
[1:30:35] friends have received the holy ghost
[1:30:39] but we just
[1:30:42] receive enough holy ghost in us
[1:30:46] to make us to a place where we don't
[1:30:50] want to lie amen
[1:30:53] we don't want to lie it does not mean
[1:30:56] that we don't lie
[1:31:00] praise the lord we don't want to lie
[1:31:04] that's when you start you start
[1:31:06] stumbling and
[1:31:08] and and and no i mean to say that
[1:31:16] know what i'm talking about
[1:31:20] we just receive enough holy ghost in us
[1:31:23] to make
[1:31:24] us to a place where we don't want to lie
[1:31:27] we don't want to steal we don't want to
[1:31:30] do
[1:31:30] anything
[1:31:34] but god wants to fill every
[1:31:37] fiber of his church he wants to feel
[1:31:41] our thinking we don't want to think evil
[1:31:44] thoughts
[1:31:45] you want to feel our thinking you want
[1:31:47] to feel our mind you want to feel
[1:31:49] feel every fiber of you

[1:32:03] surrounded in god
[1:32:06] tell his word just living
[1:32:09] right through you amen
[1:32:13] praise the lord you don't know nothing
[1:32:16] else
[1:32:18] but god's will word just stay right with
[1:32:21] his word
[1:32:22] it is life praise the lord
[1:32:26] just being so surrounded to him
[1:32:30] amen
[1:32:33] and how can we get how will we get
[1:32:35] surrounded to him
[1:32:36] is by keeping the world before us amen
[1:32:39] praise the lord
[1:32:42] it's not it's not about quitting your
[1:32:43] job
[1:32:45] and just locking yourself in the house
[1:32:47] and say i'm going to get surrounded by i
[1:32:48] just want to get so surrounded to the
[1:32:50] lord
[1:32:51] praise the lord when your knees
[1:32:55] your debts and your bills get on you
[1:33:03] but that's what we want to look at
[1:33:07] that's what we want to look at as we as
[1:33:10] we look at
[1:33:11] this i was not disobedient to the
[1:33:13] heavenly vision let's take this thought
[1:33:15] also
[1:33:17] i was just thinking a few moments ago
[1:33:20] upon the subject of science and i was
[1:33:22] thinking
[1:33:23] on how that signs how
[1:33:27] they are they are taking the natural man
[1:33:30] and how he went into
[1:33:34] the research from
[1:33:38] the fall of the natural
[1:33:41] and what he has done and how
[1:33:44] little the spiritual man has progressed
[1:33:48] in the kingdom of god how little the
[1:33:52] spiritual man
[1:33:53] has progressed in understanding what is
[1:33:56] in your midst
[1:33:59] how little we have progressed in
[1:34:02] understanding
[1:34:03] what god is doing in our life
[1:34:08] praise the lord many has used it
[1:34:11] to build their kingdom many have used it
[1:34:14] to break fellowship between brothers
[1:34:16] many have used it to establish
[1:34:18] themselves in the minds in the hearts of
[1:34:19] the people
[1:34:20] but that's not the purpose
[1:34:25] he says science has taken the natural
[1:34:28] things
[1:34:29] we can take our cell phone and our ipod
[1:34:32] and then
[1:34:33] and every time the the you know there is
[1:34:35] a new invention we go
[1:34:37] wow wow
[1:34:41] any guys that would just blow our mind
[1:34:44] wow
[1:34:46] they are taking the natural things they
[1:34:48] are taking the
[1:34:49] remnant they are raining they are taking
[1:34:52] the
[1:34:53] waste of what god is doing
[1:34:57] you know like you are in the factory you
[1:34:59] are making the rear product and they are
[1:35:01] waste
[1:35:02] so science is taking the waste
[1:35:06] and then when you produce something we
[1:35:08] go wow
[1:35:11] but god is taking you
[1:35:15] he's taking you he's working on you
[1:35:20] but yeah we are not conscious of it
[1:35:23] we are not conscious of it we have
[1:35:27] we have the tendency to for for our our
[1:35:31] natural nature
[1:35:32] to be so magnified
[1:35:37] amen of what you know what i mean this
[1:35:40] this thing yeah i mean it it just looks
[1:35:42] like ryan
[1:35:43] it goes in a cycle because there has
[1:35:46] been
[1:35:46] a false teaching that has been
[1:35:49] projecting itself in the church
[1:35:51] in one sense that has been trying to
[1:35:53] make us to believe
[1:35:55] that we will come to the place of
[1:35:56] sinless perfection
[1:35:58] so we all have been looking for sinless
[1:36:00] perfection the day where we get to the
[1:36:02] place where
[1:36:03] this thing will be gone it's not dead
[1:36:06] for it to be gone
[1:36:08] is for us to go and say dust or dust
[1:36:12] arches to arches
[1:36:17] when we when we give this border back to
[1:36:20] the dust
[1:36:21] when we give this border back to the
[1:36:23] falling earth
[1:36:28] are we together let's travel in this a
[1:36:32] little bit
[1:36:32] and how little the spiritual man has
[1:36:35] progressed
[1:36:36] in the kingdom of god understanding
[1:36:39] what god is doing in your life you are
[1:36:43] the steward
[1:36:44] of the mystery of god you are the sea
[1:36:47] where god make you the manager
[1:36:49] over what he's doing in your life
[1:36:52] and that's the reason why we would give
[1:36:53] account
[1:36:56] we would not give a count you know of
[1:36:59] what city we move what car we're driving
[1:37:01] we will give a count because we have
[1:37:04] been giving steels
[1:37:06] we have been made stills amen
[1:37:11] of what god is doing in love and and i
[1:37:13] was thinking that the natural man went
[1:37:16] out at the unseen of his
[1:37:19] eyes and pulled an atom down
[1:37:22] from the sky and split it and split that
[1:37:26] atom into two
[1:37:29] that destroy him alive
[1:37:32] amen i mean all of their all of their
[1:37:35] research and everything they've been
[1:37:36] doing that's what making us to be very
[1:37:38] maxis today
[1:37:41] praise the lord it's it's men
[1:37:45] amen they have gone down to to the
[1:37:48] residue of
[1:37:49] what god is doing in his church trying
[1:37:51] to play with it if not put marks on all
[1:37:53] of our faces
[1:38:00] the natural man that knows nothing of
[1:38:02] god and cannot know nothing of god
[1:38:04] except
[1:38:04] he be converted then his soul become
[1:38:07] alive with the supernatural
[1:38:10] praise of the lord
[1:38:14] if he could do that in the natural realm
[1:38:17] what are the man of god to be doing
[1:38:21] what are the sons and daughters of god
[1:38:23] to be doing
[1:38:25] praise the lord we when we think about
[1:38:27] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:38:29] we put it to miracles
[1:38:33] going in the street and says creeper
[1:38:35] walk
[1:38:37] and and that was not just what all for
[1:38:39] the matter of fact
[1:38:40] when adam was manifesting himself as the
[1:38:43] son of god there was no in the
[1:38:45] garden of eden
[1:38:49] amen there was no nobody was
[1:38:51] dying so he was not raising the dead
[1:38:53] but yet everything that he did when god
[1:38:56] came in the evening time
[1:38:57] god was happy with him
[1:39:06] he was living a fulfilled life when he
[1:39:09] comes to the end of his day
[1:39:11] he had no regret
[1:39:15] because he was satisfied with whatever
[1:39:18] portion
[1:39:19] he had to do that day joy
[1:39:22] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:39:30] that's the reason why the the the people
[1:39:32] believe
[1:39:33] that nothing is happening there's no
[1:39:35] tear pool because it's all turned
[1:39:37] into signs and wonders

[2:00:45] of the holy ghost
[2:00:46] where the holy ghost possesses the being
[2:00:48] where the holy ghost do
[2:00:50] it this statement being filled with the
[2:00:52] holy ghost
[2:00:53] is it's a language coming from the old
[2:00:55] testament
[2:00:57] david was filled with the holy ghost
[2:01:00] elijah was filled with the holy ghost
[2:01:02] and and the thing about it there is that
[2:01:05] this statement
[2:01:06] as we will see together you see in the
[2:01:08] scripture this statement points out
[2:01:10] is when god possesses a person
[2:01:14] for a certain work
[2:01:18] amen elijah on my camera he was
[2:01:21] possessed
[2:01:22] for him to challenge 500 prophets
[2:01:27] right in the face of ahab jesse bear the
[2:01:30] very woman he will be running away from
[2:01:33] a few weeks but he was so possessed
[2:01:37] and he said lord god i have done all of
[2:01:39] this
[2:01:40] by your word let fire fall down
[2:01:44] when god possesses a person for a work
[2:01:49] it has to be the holy ghost
[2:01:53] amen it has to be the holy ghost that
[2:01:55] language was not used
[2:01:58] in the old testament like it was but it
[2:02:01] carried a thought
[2:02:03] it carried the understanding there's
[2:02:06] something there
[2:02:08] caught off guard by a lion
[2:02:12] amen caught of god by a lion
[2:02:18] praise the lord
[2:02:22] what happened he was filled with the
[2:02:23] holy ghost
[2:02:25] to be able to tear that line apart to be
[2:02:27] able to take out a gate and put it over
[2:02:29] his shoulder
[2:02:31] the bible says when the spirit of the
[2:02:33] lord it will always use that word in the
[2:02:35] old testament when the spirit of the
[2:02:36] lord came upon him
[2:02:39] but he was filled with the holy ghost
[2:02:41] the holy ghost and the spirit of the
[2:02:42] lord is not two different things
[2:02:44] it's the same thing praise the lord
[2:02:47] amen i know you're taking all your
[2:02:50] geological guns and moving
[2:02:52] all over the place but that's fine just
[2:02:55] blast the devil amen
[2:02:57] don't shoot i mean
[2:03:02] let's let's move on a little bit verse
[2:03:03] 35 so we see here
[2:03:05] john it was prophesied it was told by
[2:03:09] the angel
[2:03:09] that john was filled with the holy ghost
[2:03:13] right from his mother womb the holy
[2:03:15] ghost possessed him
[2:03:16] because he was a forerunner amen
[2:03:20] if the holy ghost did not possess him
[2:03:22] there is no way and nine year old boy
[2:03:24] will leave the city and go in the
[2:03:26] wilderness and come back when he's 13
[2:03:29] years old
[2:03:34] he was possessed he was he was he was
[2:03:36] overtaken
[2:03:38] god has got a hold of his being
[2:03:42] right amen but yeah when his work was
[2:03:46] over
[2:03:46] he sat right there in prison and said go
[2:03:48] and ask him is he the one
[2:03:51] while the ministry was over
[2:03:57] the ministry was over let's travel
[2:04:00] together here
[2:04:02] verse 35
[2:04:05] verse 35 are we together i'm trying to
[2:04:08] show this so
[2:04:09] so you can see a certain principle here
[2:04:13] amen
[2:04:18] this is elizabeth
[2:04:23] and the angel and the angel answered and
[2:04:26] said unto her
[2:04:27] the holy thing
[2:04:31] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[2:04:35] and the power of the highest shall
[2:04:39] overshadow thee
[2:04:42] no this is not elizabeth this is married
[2:04:46] amen is this elizabeth mary let's read
[2:04:48] on let's read on
[2:04:50] let's read on the power of the highest
[2:04:54] shall overshadow thee
[2:04:55] therefore also the holy thing which
[2:04:59] we shall be born of thee
[2:05:03] shall be called the son of god
[2:05:10] uh i wrote 35 am i reading 35.
[2:05:18] i think that kind of a back in this in
[2:05:20] this reading here but
[2:05:21] uh uh and behold that cursing elizabeth
[2:05:26] us i have uh uh have also conceived a
[2:05:30] son
[2:05:31] in her old age okay let's let's move on
[2:05:34] let's move on verse 41
[2:05:36] verse 41
[2:05:39] counterfeit
[2:05:43] it talks about mary coming over here
[2:05:47] amen to elizabeth and it came to pass
[2:05:51] that when elizabeth heard the salutation
[2:05:55] of mary the baby leap in her womb
[2:05:59] and elizabeth was filled
[2:06:02] with the holy ghost
[2:06:05] amen you have to realize now that that
[2:06:09] that
[2:06:09] that the forerunner john is being born
[2:06:14] amen so god is
[2:06:17] is is is getting hold of people
[2:06:21] for married the holy ghost shall
[2:06:23] overshadow thee okay that was the reason
[2:06:25] why we read 35 that was the thought that
[2:06:27] was in my mind
[2:06:28] the holy ghost will overshadow mary
[2:06:32] it will possess her not only for the
[2:06:35] child jesus
[2:06:36] but it will also possess her because she
[2:06:38] will be despised
[2:06:39] she will be rejected a young a a a
[2:06:42] teenage girl the kind of
[2:06:44] things that she would go through because
[2:06:47] of the word of god so god
[2:06:49] is is getting hold of her body for her
[2:06:52] to be able to bear her trials
[2:06:58] praise the lord if god does not get hold
[2:07:01] of our body
[2:07:02] we will fail him just as we walk out of
[2:07:04] this service
[2:07:09] no matter what we're going through it
[2:07:10] takes god to possess your body
[2:07:14] that's the concept i'm trying to drive
[2:07:16] with this
[2:07:17] it is not only because she was going to
[2:07:19] have a baby
[2:07:21] but she would be rejected her name would
[2:07:23] be all jerusalem papers everybody will
[2:07:26] bring a story about her
[2:07:31] she will reject all her friends
[2:07:34] because she have said be it unto me i
[2:07:36] call into your word
[2:07:42] sometimes that's the reason why it's
[2:07:44] it's it's hard for us for young people
[2:07:46] to take take a stand because we
[2:07:48] you know the sense of rejection that
[2:07:50] goes we're standing for the word
[2:07:56] but the angel told her the holy ghost
[2:07:58] will overshadow you
[2:08:01] amen you will be in a bubble
[2:08:05] you have to remember now the holy ghost
[2:08:07] had not come to do it
[2:08:08] so they were in a bubble amen
[2:08:12] mary was walking around and there was a
[2:08:14] bubble over her
[2:08:16] for her to be able to bed sometimes god
[2:08:20] would even close her ears
[2:08:22] she won't hear the things they would say
[2:08:23] about her
[2:08:26] are we together
[2:08:30] verse 41 are we together yeah okay we
[2:08:33] read about elizabeth
[2:08:36] the baby lived for jordan her womb and
[2:08:39] and she was filled amen
[2:08:43] and she speak out with a loud voice and
[2:08:46] said
[2:08:46] blessed are that among women because the
[2:08:49] holy ghost had possessed her being she's
[2:08:51] prophesying
[2:08:52] she began to prophesy
[2:08:55] are we together verse uh sister seven
[2:09:03] and his father zacharias was filled with
[2:09:06] the holy ghost
[2:09:09] and prophesy saying he was filled with
[2:09:12] the holy ghost he was possessed this
[2:09:14] this guy he doubted the angel
[2:09:15] so the angel said you're not going to
[2:09:17] talk until did this shot
[2:09:19] come to come to come to being right
[2:09:22] amen so because he was not talking he
[2:09:26] had to hide himself away from the people
[2:09:30] he just kept himself there in the temple
[2:09:32] you know doing his duty
[2:09:35] everybody thought that zacharias have
[2:09:37] have traveled
[2:09:39] he went on mission trade no zagara is in
[2:09:41] the temple
[2:09:42] he can't talk because he disbelieved
[2:09:46] god's word
[2:09:48] but when the child was born
[2:09:51] and they were about me meaning to try
[2:09:53] after the father
[2:09:54] elizabeth said no the child name would
[2:09:56] be john
[2:09:58] they said no john in your family it went
[2:10:01] over
[2:10:02] to john he come out there then troy
[2:10:05] signed to the people the bible says
[2:10:08] verse 65 the fear came
[2:10:10] on all of them around about i know you
[2:10:13] dropped back a little
[2:10:14] bit they brought a pled to him i would
[2:10:15] just want to leave most of the long
[2:10:17] reading
[2:10:17] so he had to write the names on it when
[2:10:20] he showed it to the people he said wow
[2:10:21] that was the same thing
[2:10:22] that elizabeth said right there
[2:10:27] he was delivered and the holy ghost came
[2:10:30] on him
[2:10:30] and what he started to do he started to
[2:10:32] prophesy
[2:10:34] he started to prophesy
[2:10:39] are we together
[2:10:44] amen chapter 2 verse 25
[2:10:49] i told you it's uh it's a book of luke
[2:10:52] today
[2:10:53] simon there in the temple
[2:10:56] the scripture says he was a devoted man
[2:10:59] a man waiting on the consolation of
[2:11:01] israel and the holy ghost was upon him
[2:11:04] he was an old man but remember
[2:11:07] the story told him the angel had told
[2:11:09] him you will not die
[2:11:10] until you see the lord christ so the
[2:11:13] holy ghost was keeping him alive
[2:11:17] for him to see that being fulfilled
[2:11:20] he was all men he was weary he was tired
[2:11:24] but the holy ghost said simon you've
[2:11:25] been so good at priests
[2:11:28] you're not going to leave this world
[2:11:29] until you see what you have been
[2:11:31] preaching
[2:11:34] until you see it in the church you will
[2:11:36] not leave
[2:11:38] as soon as the broth mary and joseph
[2:11:41] came in
[2:11:41] as soon as the broad the holy ghost
[2:11:43] quickening and says that is he
[2:11:45] he left his hand of blessed be you say
[2:11:47] lord let yourself depart in peace my
[2:11:49] eyes have seen it
[2:11:55] so which means the holy ghost was
[2:11:57] keeping him for that to be fulfilled
[2:12:02] are we together chapter 3 verse 22.
[2:12:08] i'm i'm coming to something that's the
[2:12:10] reason why i'm running you like this
[2:12:12] verse 21
[2:12:14] and when all the people were baptized it
[2:12:17] came to pass that jesus
[2:12:19] also being baptized and praying
[2:12:23] the heaven was opened and the holy ghost
[2:12:26] descended
[2:12:28] in a buddhical shape like a dove
[2:12:31] upon him and the voice
[2:12:34] came from heaven and said
[2:12:38] they are my beloved son in whom the holy
[2:12:41] ghost descended
[2:12:43] people struggle with this when paul said
[2:12:46] it in
[2:12:46] in i mean the bible said in acts chapter
[2:12:49] 10 jesus received the holy ghost
[2:12:52] why because he was the word the word is
[2:12:55] not
[2:12:56] effective without the spirit
[2:12:59] a virgin shall conceive that was the
[2:13:02] virgin
[2:13:03] that was that word that isaiah
[2:13:05] prophesied about
[2:13:06] talk on flesh
[2:13:09] so people with the oneness idea because
[2:13:13] we make jesus
[2:13:14] god so we struggle with this that he
[2:13:17] received the holy he had to receive the
[2:13:18] holy ghost
[2:13:22] the holy ghost have to possess him uh
[2:13:25] uh uh uh
[2:13:31] chapter four verse one i don't know if
[2:13:34] i'm stumbling or i'm speaking in tongues
[2:13:38] verse one the bible says and jesus being
[2:13:41] full
[2:13:41] of the holy ghost returned to jordan
[2:13:46] and was led by the spirit and he was
[2:13:48] going to be tempted
[2:13:50] so what he needed to be full of the holy
[2:13:53] ghost
[2:13:56] to resist the devil line he was going to
[2:14:00] be tempted
[2:14:02] so he had to be full of the holy ghost
[2:14:07] the holy ghost is not an idea
[2:14:11] praise the lord amen
[2:14:14] if you have received a certificate that
[2:14:16] you have the holy ghost so you stick it
[2:14:18] on your wall i get it all it goes
[2:14:19] that's not how it works
[2:14:24] that's not how it works we need
[2:14:28] a constant feeling every day god comes
[2:14:31] down to fill us
[2:14:32] because we're having challenges every
[2:14:34] day
[2:14:38] that's why the church failed because the
[2:14:40] people take the holy ghost to be one
[2:14:42] time
[2:14:42] experience oh i received the holy ghost
[2:14:46] so they just hold to that and they start
[2:14:49] living in denial when they are
[2:14:51] struggling
[2:14:52] instead of going and said god fill me i
[2:14:55] need more of your spirit
[2:15:01] saint john chapter seven let's run
[2:15:05] wrong with the message of malachi 4.
[2:15:08] tell it like you have never told it
[2:15:10] before
[2:15:11] amen let's run
[2:15:15] saint john chapter 7 verse 39
[2:15:18] the scripture says here verse
[2:15:22] 37 at the great feast
[2:15:25] jesus talking about water telling it he
[2:15:27] that believeth
[2:15:28] on me as the scripture says out of his
[2:15:31] better will flow
[2:15:32] living water verse 39 but this
[2:15:36] speak he of the spirit
[2:15:40] which they that believe on him
[2:15:43] will receive will receive
[2:15:48] in the future the promise
[2:15:52] of the baptising of the holy ghost they
[2:15:54] will receive it in the future but yeah
[2:15:56] he's using language
[2:15:58] that they'll afford with the holy ghost
[2:16:01] right
[2:16:02] is that a contradiction it's not a
[2:16:04] contradiction
[2:16:08] are we together the bible says no man
[2:16:10] can call jesus the christ
[2:16:12] except by the holy ghost so for the
[2:16:14] person to come
[2:16:15] to a place to confess that jesus the
[2:16:18] holy ghost got to possess them
[2:16:23] amen
[2:16:26] i think i might have told you this
[2:16:27] before there was a rough
[2:16:30] flight one of the brothers was traveling
[2:16:33] there in nigeria
[2:16:34] they had a rough flight you know it was
[2:16:36] very rough in the air
[2:16:38] and uh the pilot was telling them take
[2:16:40] on your seat belt you know we
[2:16:41] we're having a you know a rough weather
[2:16:43] year and all of that and i mean the
[2:16:45] plane was just going
[2:16:47] going up and down and up and down and
[2:16:49] shaking you know what it is
[2:16:50] if you have been through one amen
[2:16:54] and i mean that was just there was just
[2:16:56] a sharp descent
[2:16:58] you know and he was sitting down beside
[2:17:00] a muslim man he just held
[2:17:01] jesus
[2:17:06] and the brother turned and looked at him
[2:17:08] he looked at the brother
[2:17:10] and the brother knew what's happening
[2:17:11] amen because he's a muslim member he's
[2:17:14] asking jesus for help
[2:17:24] so the holy ghost has not been given yet
[2:17:25] he didn't know how the holy ghost
[2:17:27] he just needed help from jesus
[2:17:32] in john chapter 20
[2:17:38] he just needed help from jesus
[2:17:45] saint john chapter 20 verse 22 this is
[2:17:48] where jesus
[2:17:49] breathing on his disciples and he's
[2:17:52] telling them
[2:17:53] receive ye the holy ghost but the holy
[2:17:55] ghost was not given yet
[2:17:59] according to john chapter 7 thy giving
[2:18:02] was what took place in acts chapter 2.
[2:18:08] so what was happening here jesus
[2:18:12] breathing on them received the holy
[2:18:14] ghost what was he doing
[2:18:16] trying to possess them
[2:18:19] because it was a difficult time for the
[2:18:21] church
[2:18:23] and that is the same thing that will
[2:18:25] happen
[2:18:26] when this church starts to go through
[2:18:29] her dark period
[2:18:31] when our doors are locked and we can
[2:18:33] fellowship again and this place are
[2:18:34] turned into warehouses
[2:18:38] we need a constant possession
[2:18:42] of his presence
[2:18:47] he's telling them he's going to leave
[2:18:51] here he said that the
[2:18:53] the the the it has gone all through
[2:18:57] jerusalem and everybody talking about
[2:18:59] jesus and jesus and and
[2:19:00] you know the roman government their eyes
[2:19:02] were out now for these for these
[2:19:04] disciples
[2:19:08] so he was he was possessing them
[2:19:12] to keep them keeping power
[2:19:15] that keep you till you receive
[2:19:18] that inner experience there is a keeping
[2:19:21] power young people
[2:19:24] that keeps you
[2:19:27] until god becomes real to you
[2:19:32] as chapter 1 verse 8
[2:19:39] praise the lord as chapter 1
[2:19:42] says here to us the holy ghost will come
[2:19:44] upon you and you will be my witnesses
[2:19:47] you know yeah you be my witnesses holy
[2:19:50] ghost come upon you
[2:19:53] and yeah and you be my witnesses
[2:20:00] i received the holy ghost and power and
[2:20:04] as chapter 2 verse 4
[2:20:08] and they were all filled with the holy
[2:20:12] ghost
[2:20:12] and began to speak with with all the
[2:20:15] tongues
[2:20:16] now you see there now now jesus has
[2:20:18] breathed the holy ghost on them
[2:20:20] receiving the holy ghost now they were
[2:20:23] having
[2:20:24] an actual birth they were having an
[2:20:27] actual
[2:20:28] experience of this thing that have kept
[2:20:31] them
[2:20:32] of this thing they have been watching
[2:20:34] over them
[2:20:39] jesus told peter flesh and blood has not
[2:20:41] revealed this to you
[2:20:43] when he said thou i cried son of the
[2:20:44] living god he said my father has
[2:20:46] revealed it
[2:20:49] jesus peter confessing christ here
[2:20:52] just to deny him after
[2:20:56] don't we all go through that amen
[2:21:00] after the good service we say amen to
[2:21:01] the word we shout hallelujah
[2:21:05] and then when the devil takes her into a
[2:21:06] little corner we don't know what to do
[2:21:13] so you find that now this is where it
[2:21:16] becomes more real
[2:21:17] as chapter four verse eight you will see
[2:21:19] they already received the holy ghost
[2:21:22] the uh in us chapter two the indwelling
[2:21:24] presence of the holy ghost
[2:21:26] verse 8 here the bible says then peter
[2:21:29] filled with the holy ghost said unto
[2:21:31] them ye
[2:21:32] rulers of the people elders of israel
[2:21:35] now you will see this pattern in the
[2:21:37] scripture every time the believers
[2:21:40] had a challenge god gave them another
[2:21:44] baptism again
[2:21:47] you go through the scripture you will
[2:21:49] see this very same pattern
[2:21:52] chapter verse 31 of chapter four
[2:21:56] it repeats itself again the bible says
[2:21:59] here verse 31
[2:22:00] that uh and when they had prayed
[2:22:04] the place was shaking where they were
[2:22:07] assembled together
[2:22:09] and they were all filled with the holy
[2:22:11] ghost is that another is that a
[2:22:12] different feeling
[2:22:14] they have already received the holy
[2:22:15] ghost here
[2:22:17] but the church has just gone through a
[2:22:19] trial they had just
[2:22:20] whipped peter and john in the public
[2:22:22] place
[2:22:25] and they come back together the church
[2:22:26] is growing through a persecution
[2:22:28] so god is constantly filling his people
[2:22:33] brother branham said this let's read
[2:22:34] this
[2:22:36] and then we can close
[2:22:43] what shall i do with jesus
[2:22:47] is that why we were playing as a tape
[2:22:51] amen what shall i do with jesus call the
[2:22:54] christ
[2:22:55] yeah i heard i heard that with jesus on
[2:22:58] your hands
[2:23:00] the dynamics of this church will be the
[2:23:03] refilling of the holy spirit
[2:23:08] that we have worked in a small measure
[2:23:12] why the hair stone is coming down
[2:23:16] to unite with the body the dynamics of
[2:23:19] this church would be the refilling
[2:23:21] that's the thing that will put us in
[2:23:23] motion
[2:23:24] to live for the world every day that we
[2:23:27] need a refueling
[2:23:30] we need a refilling praise the lord
[2:23:34] amen
[2:23:41] when you're facing your tea in the
[2:23:42] morning say fill my cup lord
[2:23:47] said fill my cup fill my heart lord i
[2:23:49] need a refilling for today
[2:23:52] to be able to fix the devils that are
[2:23:53] out there
[2:23:55] it's not a one-time experience church
[2:23:58] it's a constant experience
[2:24:00] the new birth is a constant experience
[2:24:02] god keeps birthing us
[2:24:04] over and over into new experience into a
[2:24:07] closer walk
[2:24:08] new dedication
[2:24:12] see the evil thing that the church word
[2:24:14] did they give the people a certificate
[2:24:16] you are born again yes your certificate
[2:24:18] we signed it so they put it in a frame
[2:24:20] hang it on their wall
[2:24:22] i was born again that's my certificate
[2:24:27] not realizing that you have to be born
[2:24:29] again every day
[2:24:32] because you have a new experience a new
[2:24:34] walk
[2:24:35] with god every day
[2:24:42] the speaking tones they gave them a
[2:24:43] certificate and hanging on the wall
[2:24:46] so there is no fight to fight
[2:24:50] praise the lord the devil is boxing
[2:24:53] their face they are looking at their
[2:24:54] certificate
[2:24:58] you cannot be warned by a pinch of fire
[2:25:01] that certificate is a pinkifier you need
[2:25:04] a real fire in you
[2:25:08] so we need a refilling of the holy ghost
[2:25:12] that we have worked with in a small
[2:25:13] measure while the hair stone is coming
[2:25:15] down
[2:25:15] to unite with the body but when the head
[2:25:18] and body unite together
[2:25:21] the full power of the holy ghost
[2:25:24] will rise her up
[2:25:29] the full power of the holy ghost will
[2:25:31] rise her up
[2:25:35] praise the lord i'm telling you the
[2:25:37] bride is rising up
[2:25:40] the bride is rising up
[2:25:44] it's not a future work it's happening
[2:25:45] right now
[2:25:48] the bride is rising up we are using this
[2:25:51] word
[2:25:53] to deal with issues in our life issues
[2:25:55] in our home
[2:25:58] because we have we have answers to the
[2:26:01] devil question
[2:26:03] praise the lord i've been saying that
[2:26:05] recently we'll talk about it
[2:26:06] we'll find out what the devil question
[2:26:08] is because you got to get a question
[2:26:10] before you find the answer amen
[2:26:13] praise the lord are we together
[2:26:16] musicians you can come for
[2:26:17] sorry for keeping you i get a bunch of
[2:26:19] scriptures down here even peter i mean
[2:26:21] stephen
[2:26:22] as chapter 7 verse 55 the bible says he
[2:26:26] looks up to heaven
[2:26:27] and he was filled of the holy ghost and
[2:26:29] he said father
[2:26:30] they know not what they were doing while
[2:26:32] god possessed him
[2:26:34] in that moment while they are stoning
[2:26:36] him the holy ghost possesses him so he
[2:26:38] will not say the wrong word
[2:26:43] so he will not fight back because you
[2:26:46] stay in this flesh
[2:26:50] that's why when someone make you angry
[2:26:51] you you fire back before you catch
[2:26:53] yourself
[2:26:55] well sorry i said that to you buddy
[2:26:57] you're not supposed to
[2:26:58] talk to me like that
[2:27:03] but that's what the overcoming is the
[2:27:05] overcoming is for you to catch yourself
[2:27:07] in the moment
[2:27:08] and bring your body constantly subject
[2:27:11] to the world
[2:27:12] constantly subject to the world
