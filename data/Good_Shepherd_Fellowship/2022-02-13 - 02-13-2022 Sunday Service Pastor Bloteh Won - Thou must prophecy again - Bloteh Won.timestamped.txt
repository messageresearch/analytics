[57:08] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[57:10] and the rainbow
[57:12] was upon his head and his face was as it
[57:15] were the sun
[57:16] and his feet as
[57:19] pillow of fire
[57:22] and he had in his hand a little bulk
[57:26] and he set his right foot upon the seat
[57:29] in his left foot on the earth
[57:32] and cried with a loud voice
[57:34] as when a lion rolleth
[57:36] and when he had cried seven thunder
[57:39] altered their voices
[57:43] and when the seven thunder had altered
[57:45] their voices i was about to write and i
[57:47] heard a voice from heaven saying
[57:51] unto me seal up those things which the
[57:54] seventh on the altar and write them net
[57:56] now remember daniel was told to do the
[57:58] same thing
[58:00] so when are we going to get the writing
[58:01] of these things
[58:03] daniel was told to seal it until the
[58:04] time of the end and this injured in the
[58:07] time of the end was also told to seal it
[58:11] but let's go on right here we'll pray
[58:13] the lord help us
[58:15] and the angel which
[58:17] i saw standing upon the seed and upon
[58:19] the earth lifted up his hands to heaven
[58:22] and swore by him that liveth forever and
[58:24] ever who created heaven and the things
[58:27] that
[58:28] therein are
[58:30] and the earth
[58:31] and the things that therein are and the
[58:35] seed and the things which are dead in
[58:38] that there should be time no longer
[58:43] but that's the interruption amen
[58:47] but
[58:48] praise the lord
[58:50] because it's a contrast
[58:53] amen
[58:55] is a contrast but
[58:58] in the days of the voice of the
[59:02] seventh angel
[59:06] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[59:09] of god should be finished as he have
[59:12] declared to his servants the prophet
[59:17] and the voice
[59:19] which
[59:20] i heard from heaven speak unto me again
[59:26] praise the lord
[59:28] the voice which i heard from heaven
[59:30] speak unto me again and said go
[59:34] and take the little block
[59:37] which
[59:38] is open in the hands of the angel we
[59:40] standed upon the seed and upon the earth
[59:43] and i went
[59:45] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[59:48] the little book
[59:50] praise the lord
[59:52] amen
[59:53] i believe that's what the lord want us
[59:55] to do amen
[59:56] he praise the lord because john was
[59:58] representing us we have to go down to
[1:00:01] the angel and say give me the book amen
[1:00:03] because that book is the book of
[1:00:05] redemption
[1:00:06] if your name is in that book you would
[1:00:08] go for it that's the thing that would
[1:00:10] draw you if you don't have strength to
[1:00:12] go because it does not belongs to you
[1:00:14] what belongs to you you go and get it
[1:00:16] amen
[1:00:17] go and take the book and he said unto me
[1:00:22] take
[1:00:24] and eat it up
[1:00:26] and it shall be and it shall make
[1:00:29] thy belly bitter
[1:00:31] but it shall be in the mouth sweet as
[1:00:34] honey
[1:00:36] and i took the little book out of the
[1:00:39] hands out of the angel hands and eat it
[1:00:42] up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:00:45] as honey and as soon as i have eaten and
[1:00:48] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:00:52] thou must
[1:00:53] prophesied again before many people
[1:00:57] nations tongues and kings
[1:01:01] may the law our blessing to his word you
[1:01:03] may have your seat
[1:01:05] our brother will play it as revelation
[1:01:08] chapter 4 if you want to turn to it or
[1:01:10] read it from the the poster verses
[1:01:14] there
[1:01:15] that will be
[1:01:16] okay
[1:01:34] after this
[1:01:35] i looked
[1:01:37] and behold a door was opened in heaven
[1:01:40] and the first voice which i heard was as
[1:01:42] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[1:01:43] which said come up hither and i will
[1:01:45] show thee things which must be hereafter
[1:01:49] and immediately i was in the spirit
[1:01:51] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[1:01:54] and one sat on the throne
[1:01:56] and he that sat was to look upon like a
[1:01:59] jasper
[1:02:00] and a sword in the stone
[1:02:02] and there was a rainbow round about the
[1:02:04] throne in sight like unto an emerald
[1:02:07] and round about the throne were four and
[1:02:09] twenty seats and upon the seats i saw
[1:02:11] four and twenty elders sitting clothed
[1:02:13] in white raiment and they had on their
[1:02:15] heads crowns of gold and out of the
[1:02:17] throne preceded lightnings and
[1:02:19] thunderings and voices
[1:02:21] and there were seven lamps of fire
[1:02:23] burning before the throne which are the
[1:02:25] seven spirits of god
[1:02:27] and before the throne there was a sea of
[1:02:29] glass like unto crystal
[1:02:32] and in the midst of the throne and round
[1:02:34] about the throne were four beasts full
[1:02:37] of eyes before and behind
[1:02:39] and the first beast was like a lion
[1:02:42] and the second beast like a calf and the
[1:02:44] third beast had a face as a man
[1:02:46] and the fourth beast
[1:02:48] was like a flying eagle
[1:02:51] and the four beasts had each of them six
[1:02:53] wings about him and they were full of
[1:02:55] eyes within
[1:02:56] and they rest not day and night saying
[1:02:59] holy holy holy lord god almighty
[1:03:02] which was and is and is to come
[1:03:05] and when those beasts give glory and
[1:03:07] honor and thanks to him that sat on the
[1:03:09] throne who liveth forever and ever the
[1:03:11] four and twenty elders fall down before
[1:03:13] him that sat on the throne and worship
[1:03:16] him that liveth forever and ever and
[1:03:18] cast their crowns before the throne
[1:03:20] saying thou art worthy o lord to receive
[1:03:22] glory and honor and power for thou hast
[1:03:25] created all things and for thy pleasure
[1:03:28] they are and were created
[1:03:31] amen
[1:03:33] praise the lord we want to thank the
[1:03:34] lord for that reading the reading of his
[1:03:37] word amen
[1:03:38] but uh uh what what what what will be
[1:03:42] interesting yet is that
[1:03:44] uh when you go to revelation chapter 5
[1:03:47] then
[1:03:48] another scene open
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:52] now what i want you to for us to be able
[1:03:55] to to see here to underline that the the
[1:03:58] 24 address fell down in in in worship
[1:04:02] and you know him that lived forever
[1:04:05] now uh uh uh revelation 4 starts with
[1:04:09] only one on the throne
[1:04:11] amen so the 24 headers when they fell
[1:04:14] down to worship they were worshiping the
[1:04:17] only one that was on the throne
[1:04:19] praise the lord
[1:04:20] amen is now the throne of father son
[1:04:23] holy ghost only one on the throne and
[1:04:26] when they fell down to wash it
[1:04:28] now grab this now because if you don't
[1:04:30] grab it you'll get you will get caught
[1:04:32] up in the midst of thoughts here
[1:04:34] uh when he fell down to worship
[1:04:38] verse 11 it says thou are worthy o lord
[1:04:42] to receive glory and honor and power for
[1:04:45] thou have created all things and it's
[1:04:47] for your pleasure they were created thou
[1:04:50] are worthy
[1:04:52] o
[1:04:52] lord now revelation chapter 5 open
[1:04:56] and he says
[1:04:58] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[1:05:02] sat on the throne the very same one the
[1:05:05] 24 others
[1:05:06] fell before and says thou art there o
[1:05:10] lord
[1:05:11] are we together
[1:05:12] it says i i
[1:05:14] fell down
[1:05:21] i saw in in the hand of him that sat on
[1:05:23] the throne
[1:05:24] a book written within and on the
[1:05:26] backside sealed with seven seals
[1:05:30] and i saw the strong
[1:05:32] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[1:05:36] is walty
[1:05:37] i thought the angels have just said thou
[1:05:39] i want it
[1:05:47] praise the lord
[1:05:48] now don't miss the picture now
[1:05:51] the angels have just the 24 others have
[1:05:54] just fell down and says thou are walking
[1:05:58] to receive every glory honor of power
[1:06:05] but here we see the scene open
[1:06:09] the very one that the 24 headers had
[1:06:11] just failed down before
[1:06:14] now he has a little book in his hands
[1:06:20] praise the lord
[1:06:23] then another angel make a proclamation
[1:06:26] who is wolfie
[1:06:30] wu is walking
[1:06:34] now there's there's a picture there's a
[1:06:36] scene here
[1:06:37] praise the lord
[1:06:39] so
[1:06:40] if you if you look at the picture or the
[1:06:43] scene that is playing out here
[1:06:45] when this proclamation was made in
[1:06:47] revelation chapter 5 of who is worthy
[1:06:52] to open the book
[1:06:54] and to lose the seals thereof
[1:06:57] you will realize that the
[1:07:03] this proclamation was made
[1:07:07] for
[1:07:08] another one
[1:07:12] because the the angels
[1:07:15] have just proclaimed the 24 headers have
[1:07:19] just proclaimed
[1:07:21] that uh
[1:07:22] uh dawah walter to receive all glory
[1:07:25] honor in power
[1:07:28] now so there's there is there is
[1:07:30] something that is if you follow now
[1:07:32] uh to take the book and lose the seals
[1:07:35] thereof
[1:07:36] the next verse says
[1:07:38] and no
[1:07:40] man
[1:07:42] praise the lord
[1:07:44] now so the proclamation of who is water
[1:07:47] was not for the one that was sitting on
[1:07:49] the throne the proclamation was looking
[1:07:52] for a man
[1:08:00] are you seeing the picture
[1:08:03] the angers have just thrown down their
[1:08:06] crowns they have just
[1:08:07] you know fell on their face oh that's
[1:08:10] that's the kind of a spirit of worship
[1:08:12] that that i pray comes upon the people
[1:08:15] where when we are worshiping you can
[1:08:17] lift up your hands you can kneed down
[1:08:19] you can weep and you can just pour out
[1:08:22] yourself
[1:08:24] before god
[1:08:26] praise the lord he's more wealthy
[1:08:29] he costs more
[1:08:31] than your pretty dress you are wearing
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:38] glory be to god there may be the new
[1:08:40] suit that you just bought
[1:08:43] he costs more than that
[1:08:49] but the angels have just proclaimed that
[1:08:51] he is walking
[1:08:55] this proclamation came
[1:08:57] no uh uh who is walter to take the book
[1:09:00] lost the seals
[1:09:01] no man
[1:09:03] in heaven
[1:09:05] none in earth neither under the earth
[1:09:09] was able to take the book
[1:09:12] neither to lose
[1:09:14] the seals
[1:09:15] and john said i wept much
[1:09:20] i wept much
[1:09:22] praise the lord
[1:09:24] you know what whipping much is
[1:09:28] when you just can't find counsel
[1:09:34] you try to stop
[1:09:35] and then you start again
[1:09:39] if you have ever been in that place
[1:09:42] praise the lord
[1:09:44] amen
[1:09:46] if you have ever been in that place
[1:09:49] i wept much
[1:09:54] praise the lord
[1:09:58] because no man
[1:10:00] was found wealthy to open the book here
[1:10:03] again it comes to the place of
[1:10:06] of a man
[1:10:08] so
[1:10:10] this proclamation is to find
[1:10:13] a man that is worthy because we know
[1:10:17] that a wealthy one is on the throne
[1:10:23] are we together
[1:10:27] no man's found walter
[1:10:30] to open a book
[1:10:32] to open it
[1:10:34] to read a book
[1:10:37] neither to look on the things that i did
[1:10:40] praise the lord
[1:10:43] open the book
[1:10:44] read it look dead in
[1:10:47] revelation chapter 8 and then eat the
[1:10:49] book
[1:10:50] but we will get to that one soon
[1:10:52] and the other and the ever and one of
[1:10:55] the others said unto me weep now behold
[1:10:58] the lion of the trap of judah
[1:11:01] the root of david
[1:11:04] have prevailed to open the book
[1:11:07] and to lose the seals thereof
[1:11:10] praise the lord one of the angels said
[1:11:13] that you you can you imagine what an
[1:11:15] attraction
[1:11:19] john might have just
[1:11:21] woke up and wiped his face
[1:11:24] and saying
[1:11:25] who is this lion of the trap of judah
[1:11:31] he says and i beheld which means i
[1:11:34] started to look
[1:11:36] i'm now looking for the lion of the trap
[1:11:39] of judah
[1:11:42] and lord in the midst of the throne
[1:11:46] and of the phobias in the midst of the
[1:11:49] other
[1:11:50] stood a lie what an interruption
[1:11:54] [Laughter]
[1:11:58] what an interruption
[1:12:01] when i'm told
[1:12:04] that
[1:12:05] the lion of the trap of judah
[1:12:08] has prevailed
[1:12:13] praise the lord
[1:12:17] what an interruption
[1:12:21] john with excitement is now looking for
[1:12:23] the lion
[1:12:27] but then right in the midst of the
[1:12:29] throne
[1:12:32] he sees
[1:12:34] a lamb
[1:12:38] praise the lord
[1:12:47] and i be held in and in the midst of the
[1:12:50] throne
[1:12:51] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[1:12:53] of the others still alarm
[1:12:56] as it had been slain
[1:12:59] having seven
[1:13:00] seven seven homes and seven eyes which
[1:13:03] are the seven spirit of god
[1:13:06] sent forth into all the earth
[1:13:11] praise the lord
[1:13:18] so we see here
[1:13:23] an interruption that have taken place
[1:13:31] because john was told to look for the
[1:13:34] lion of the trap of judah
[1:13:37] but then he see in the midst of the
[1:13:39] trump a bleeding line
[1:13:41] the noun talk took the scene
[1:13:45] and the lion took the book
[1:13:48] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:13:50] hand of him
[1:13:51] that sat on the throne
[1:13:54] praise the lord
[1:13:57] amen
[1:14:01] now so if if we if we look at the scene
[1:14:04] that uh that we are dealing with
[1:14:07] and and uh we spoke a little bit about
[1:14:09] uh uh you know the we will look at
[1:14:12] different interruptions in the scripture
[1:14:15] but what i want to talk on this morning
[1:14:17] by the grace of god i want to speak on
[1:14:20] thou
[1:14:21] must prophesied again
[1:14:25] thou must prophesy again
[1:14:29] praise the lord
[1:14:31] and i want to i want us to look at look
[1:14:34] at this
[1:14:35] because john years says in the book of
[1:14:37] revelation
[1:14:39] that you know
[1:14:41] the testimony of jesus christ is the
[1:14:43] spirit of prophecy
[1:14:46] so
[1:14:47] we see that
[1:14:52] there's a commission
[1:14:53] you know he's he told the angel told
[1:14:56] john to take the book go to the angel to
[1:14:58] have the book take it
[1:15:00] and eat it now so we see that this book
[1:15:04] that the lamb took from him that sat on
[1:15:06] the throne
[1:15:08] is the same book in revelation chapter
[1:15:10] 10.
[1:15:11] now that book was given to an angel
[1:15:14] you know uh uh uh
[1:15:16] you know and and the angel now john had
[1:15:19] to go to that angel and take the book
[1:15:22] and eat the book because uh he must
[1:15:25] prophesy the game which of course he
[1:15:27] represent the bride throughout the ages
[1:15:31] so uh that's that's what we want to look
[1:15:33] at but as as we look at the same year
[1:15:36] as we look at the scene
[1:15:38] let's go over to hebrew
[1:15:40] hebrew chapter 2.
[1:15:43] let's look let's go over to hebrew
[1:15:45] chapter 2.
[1:15:47] praise the lord
[1:15:49] hebrew chapter 2.
[1:16:05] hebrew chapter 2.
[1:16:09] let's read from verse 5.
[1:16:18] oh i have a i have a note here
[1:16:22] brother augustin are you the one okay
[1:16:26] uh
[1:16:27] thanks for coming to
[1:16:29] fellowship with us
[1:16:33] we pray that you feel at home
[1:16:37] praise the lord
[1:16:39] hebrew chapter five let's read chapter
[1:16:41] two reading from verse five the
[1:16:43] scripture says for unto the angel
[1:16:46] have he not put in in suggestion the
[1:16:50] word to come
[1:16:53] where are he speak
[1:16:55] but one in a setting place testified
[1:16:59] saying
[1:17:00] what is man
[1:17:04] that thou
[1:17:07] are mindful of him
[1:17:10] or the son of man
[1:17:12] that thou
[1:17:13] visited him
[1:17:17] thou made him a little lower than the
[1:17:20] angels thou crowning him with glory and
[1:17:22] honor
[1:17:24] and they set him over the works of their
[1:17:27] hands
[1:17:30] thou has put all things in subjection
[1:17:33] under his feet now if if you look at
[1:17:35] this picture
[1:17:37] or what the apostle paul is talking here
[1:17:39] and you bring it back to revelation
[1:17:41] chapter five you bring it back to that
[1:17:44] scene in revelation chapter 5. after the
[1:17:47] angels and the 24 elders have already
[1:17:50] identified that the one that is sitting
[1:17:53] on the throne is is the wealthy one
[1:17:58] praise the lord
[1:17:59] but you receive this scene open
[1:18:02] and and uh uh and this and and this
[1:18:05] proclamation comfort who is walking
[1:18:11] now we see now that the wealthiness now
[1:18:15] is now no uh in one sense kind of for
[1:18:18] being attributed to a man because no man
[1:18:22] is found walty
[1:18:26] praise the lord
[1:18:27] now so we have to realize we have to
[1:18:30] realize what the apostle paul is trying
[1:18:33] to draw us to understanding here is that
[1:18:37] uh uh
[1:18:38] you know if if you if you look at the
[1:18:41] sequence of creation you will realize
[1:18:44] that god created the angels before he
[1:18:47] created man
[1:18:49] amen he created the angels because
[1:18:54] if there was nothing to worship god he
[1:18:56] would not be god because god is an
[1:18:58] object of washing
[1:19:01] so he created the angels
[1:19:06] but then
[1:19:09] in creating man
[1:19:12] he expressed this in his word that uh
[1:19:15] uh uh a man will be created in his image
[1:19:20] and in his likeness
[1:19:26] praise the lord
[1:19:28] amen
[1:19:31] you know in all of his creation
[1:19:34] there was no there was there was nothing
[1:19:36] that he did created to be in his image
[1:19:39] and his likeness then when it comes to
[1:19:42] the creation of man
[1:19:46] praise the lord
[1:19:49] so you you we can realize that there
[1:19:51] there is some form of
[1:19:53] of attraction here there is there is
[1:19:55] something about man
[1:19:58] that's what the prophets all through the
[1:20:00] ages david said it in the psalm what is
[1:20:03] man
[1:20:05] that thou are mindful of him
[1:20:10] the angels that was created before man
[1:20:14] their creation was never put into their
[1:20:17] suggestion
[1:20:21] it was when god created a man
[1:20:24] the first man adam
[1:20:26] he put everything subject unto others
[1:20:30] he never told the the angels to name his
[1:20:33] creation
[1:20:34] but he told other man to name the
[1:20:38] creation
[1:20:39] he never gave the angels dominion and
[1:20:42] power over his creation but he gave man
[1:20:45] dominion and power what is man
[1:20:49] that thou are my fault of him
[1:20:57] praise the lord
[1:21:01] what is man
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:06] and do you realize every man that god
[1:21:08] ever meets he also asks that question
[1:21:10] who am i
[1:21:13] when god met moses at the burning bush
[1:21:15] he said who am i
[1:21:18] when he may give him he give himself who
[1:21:20] am i
[1:21:25] praise the lord
[1:21:26] what is man
[1:21:30] that they were mindful of him
[1:21:33] praise the lord
[1:21:35] realizing when that proclamation went in
[1:21:38] in revelation chapter 5 the proclamation
[1:21:41] was not for god
[1:21:42] because revelation chapter 4 already
[1:21:45] testified that god was worthy
[1:21:50] the proclamation was for a man
[1:21:54] are we together for amen
[1:21:58] oh my goodness
[1:22:00] praise the lord
[1:22:02] praise the lord
[1:22:04] if we just
[1:22:06] realize
[1:22:08] you know the privilege and uh and the
[1:22:11] blessings that we have
[1:22:13] you know
[1:22:15] of being created by an awesome god
[1:22:19] praise the lord
[1:22:22] being created by an awesome god
[1:22:25] we will just
[1:22:27] appreciate that
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:32] glory be to god beyond all the the
[1:22:34] spiritual gifts and whatever we might
[1:22:37] have just to appreciate the fact
[1:22:40] that we have been created by an awesome
[1:22:43] god
[1:22:45] praise the lord
[1:22:47] that he made us
[1:22:50] with his hands
[1:22:52] the bible said from the dust of the
[1:22:54] earth he formed man
[1:22:57] praise the lord
[1:23:00] and the simon says how wonderful and how
[1:23:02] fearful
[1:23:05] with a lot of reverence
[1:23:07] he made us
[1:23:09] what is men that thou are mindful of him
[1:23:12] praise the lord
[1:23:14] so we see here that uh uh
[1:23:17] thy god make man in his image
[1:23:21] because
[1:23:22] god's desire
[1:23:24] was to come in the image of a man
[1:23:28] praise the lord
[1:23:30] the reason why he made man in his image
[1:23:33] because that will be his final
[1:23:36] expression
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:41] that will be his ultimate expression
[1:23:46] praise the lord so that's why revelation
[1:23:49] chapter 5 is playing out here
[1:23:53] to show that the one that the 24 headers
[1:23:58] fell before
[1:24:01] to proclaim and worship as the wealthy
[1:24:03] one
[1:24:05] will now be a man
[1:24:08] praise the lord
[1:24:10] that will also be wealthy
[1:24:15] praise the lord
[1:24:17] because if if the angels have already
[1:24:19] declared that thou art wanted to receive
[1:24:22] every glory in honor
[1:24:24] they cannot be too wealthy pressing
[1:24:28] because there was just only one throne
[1:24:34] praise the lord
[1:24:36] now so if you see the description here
[1:24:38] in revelation chapter 5
[1:24:41] the bible says let's go back there so
[1:24:44] you can we can see the beautiful picture
[1:24:48] the scripture says
[1:24:53] john said verse 6 and i beheld and lord
[1:24:57] in the midst of the throne
[1:25:01] and all the four beasts and in the midst
[1:25:04] of the other
[1:25:07] stool alarm
[1:25:09] as it had been slain
[1:25:12] praise the lord
[1:25:14] so you see right in the midst of the
[1:25:16] throne the lamb came from in the mess of
[1:25:20] the throne
[1:25:22] so it's god projecting himself the same
[1:25:26] one that is on the throne
[1:25:29] leaving the throne and taking up his
[1:25:31] royal coat and putting it down and
[1:25:34] taking cystine elements and dressing
[1:25:37] himself in bodily form
[1:25:47] praise the lord
[1:25:50] oh my
[1:25:52] that's the reason why when we get to
[1:25:55] to look at being i mean uh uh the the
[1:25:58] the commission of prophesying again will
[1:26:01] realize that how how important it is for
[1:26:04] us to take that book
[1:26:05] and eat it
[1:26:07] praise the lord
[1:26:08] hallelujah
[1:26:11] now so we realized that uh uh uh he came
[1:26:16] out of the midst of the throne he he he
[1:26:18] took on the flesh and and and and and he
[1:26:22] took the book now we realized that that
[1:26:24] this was the book that had the title day
[1:26:26] this this was the book that the adam
[1:26:29] lost so he took the book
[1:26:31] and and now over in revelation chapter
[1:26:34] 10 that we read
[1:26:35] is the book that we have to go for and
[1:26:37] eat because we have to prophesy again
[1:26:39] amen
[1:26:40] so in revelation chapter 10 we read he
[1:26:43] says i saw another mighty angel
[1:26:46] come down from heaven
[1:26:48] with uh with a cloud and the rainbow was
[1:26:51] upon his head and his face was as the
[1:26:55] sun his feet as a pillow of fire now so
[1:26:58] we see here that the the same one that
[1:27:01] left the throne and
[1:27:03] and he know he he
[1:27:04] uh uh uh projects himself from the
[1:27:07] throne and and and changed his max amen
[1:27:11] praise the lord he he's he's now near
[1:27:13] taking the balkan and coming down to
[1:27:15] give it to to an earthly angel
[1:27:18] praise the lord
[1:27:20] amen
[1:27:22] but we we there there are some things
[1:27:24] that we want to look at before we go
[1:27:27] forward here really uh wednesday
[1:27:29] wednesday night we were talking about
[1:27:31] looking at uh
[1:27:33] uh the interruption from genesis chapter
[1:27:36] i mean revelation chapter 9 to
[1:27:38] revelation chapter 10 revelation chapter
[1:27:40] 9 was the sixth seal talking about the
[1:27:42] different things that were happening on
[1:27:44] the face of the earth amen and and what
[1:27:46] we were trying to to to help ourselves
[1:27:49] to understand is the other
[1:27:52] uh uh
[1:27:54] uh
[1:27:55] we are going to to to move from one
[1:27:57] interruptions and different
[1:27:59] interruptions and while i was studying
[1:28:01] this subject you know i was i was
[1:28:03] thinking there is if you even look at
[1:28:06] time
[1:28:07] time is an interruption of eternity
[1:28:11] praise the lord
[1:28:13] and italian internation you see eternity
[1:28:16] does not have it does not have times
[1:28:18] pain
[1:28:20] praise the lord
[1:28:22] many many times the way we think about
[1:28:24] eternity because we are time creature we
[1:28:27] we think that uh you know what at this
[1:28:30] particular time eternity we begin you
[1:28:32] know after the word and then we go into
[1:28:35] eternity has been there eternity is
[1:28:38] there
[1:28:39] eternity will always be
[1:28:44] praise the lord
[1:28:46] message profession but brahm says it was
[1:28:48] just a little pork
[1:28:51] that god introduced
[1:28:54] and the purpose of that for him to
[1:28:56] express himself
[1:29:00] so time
[1:29:01] is it's an interruption of eternity
[1:29:06] praise the lord
[1:29:12] glory be to god
[1:29:14] amen so so we we realize we realize that
[1:29:18] is is it's a nature of our god it looks
[1:29:22] like he just loved enjoy interrupting
[1:29:26] interrupting our sinful life
[1:29:29] when we think we had it all together
[1:29:32] praise the lord
[1:29:33] and we think we were on the peak of
[1:29:35] whatever we would
[1:29:38] and then he come by his grace and just
[1:29:40] interrupted with a new birth
[1:29:43] praise the lord
[1:29:45] oh my goodness
[1:29:48] he interrupted and it looks like the
[1:29:51] life i used to live are living normal
[1:29:53] [Laughter]
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:55] what an interruption
[1:29:57] praise the lord
[1:29:59] my goodness
[1:30:01] amen
[1:30:03] the new birth is an
[1:30:04] interruption praise the lord what what
[1:30:07] are trials
[1:30:09] what are trius
[1:30:12] they are interruptions
[1:30:16] oh man that's why we don't like it
[1:30:20] that's why we don't we don't embrace it
[1:30:22] because it looks like everything was
[1:30:24] happening until
[1:30:34] until
[1:30:36] until i came down there
[1:30:39] until
[1:30:44] oh glory be to god
[1:30:47] you love the lord this morning oh let's
[1:30:49] just enjoy the lord amen praise the lord
[1:30:52] hallelujah
[1:30:54] the lover of our sword is in the house
[1:30:57] let's just enjoy the lord amen
[1:31:00] praise the lord
[1:31:02] hallelujah
[1:31:04] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:11] oh
[1:31:12] we thank you lord
[1:31:20] now so we we uh uh uh as we as we look
[1:31:23] at this okay coming back from wednesday
[1:31:25] night uh revelation chapter nine and it
[1:31:28] talks about all the different pledges
[1:31:30] that will come so uh uh uh what the the
[1:31:34] thought there is that the there is not
[1:31:37] an orderly sequence with this
[1:31:40] an orderly sequence in in this time
[1:31:44] because one we keep interrupting the
[1:31:46] other
[1:31:48] praise the lord
[1:31:50] okay when we keep it interrupting the
[1:31:52] other until the whole thing just fall in
[1:31:57] that's the time that we are living in
[1:32:01] okay
[1:32:03] they never even told us about uh
[1:32:06] uh finding a good result of of of
[1:32:10] uh corona part a corona pable came and
[1:32:13] interrupted corona part 8 and corona
[1:32:15] pass c and d and you know it would just
[1:32:18] be an interruption
[1:32:21] praise the lord
[1:32:23] but the the beauty here in the in the
[1:32:25] scripture that we are looking at in this
[1:32:28] time of the pledges
[1:32:30] when the plagues when the sith seal is
[1:32:33] falling we realize in the midst of it
[1:32:37] a mighty angel come down also
[1:32:40] praise the lord
[1:32:41] now the mighty angel comes down to
[1:32:44] create an interruption
[1:32:47] for his people
[1:32:49] to smash them out
[1:32:53] praise the lord now take for example the
[1:32:55] scripture or the egypt
[1:32:58] at a time where the the the the the put
[1:33:01] the hebrews to work and how to build
[1:33:04] breaks with our straw i mean egypt was
[1:33:07] building their kingdom
[1:33:09] never than before
[1:33:12] they were stretching out their walls
[1:33:14] they were they were protecting
[1:33:15] themselves and building their empire and
[1:33:18] here comes this man with just a stake in
[1:33:20] his hands
[1:33:22] and he interrupted the whole thing
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:28] he could be a type of our mighty injured
[1:33:31] in revelation chapter 10
[1:33:35] praise the lord he interrupted the whole
[1:33:37] thing
[1:33:40] they had to put the work
[1:33:42] on heart
[1:33:46] praise the lord the economy of egypt
[1:33:49] starts to go down
[1:33:51] because now the hebrews are
[1:33:54] rallying around their deliverer
[1:33:59] praise the lord
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:03] that nation that was once uh a reverence
[1:34:06] and fear in the world
[1:34:09] now starts to have trouble
[1:34:15] because an injured of the law came and
[1:34:16] met a man on the backside of the desert
[1:34:19] and gave him a commission
[1:34:23] now he has a stake and he's walking
[1:34:25] right in there
[1:34:28] praise the lord
[1:34:30] saying let my people go
[1:34:33] praise the lord
[1:34:35] oh one of the decent country now we're
[1:34:37] hearing fleas are all over the place
[1:34:40] frogs are in the kingdom water turning
[1:34:42] to blood
[1:34:47] one
[1:34:48] after another
[1:34:50] one
[1:34:52] after the other
[1:34:56] praise the lord
[1:34:59] there is something also i want i want to
[1:35:01] also see
[1:35:02] uh uh
[1:35:05] we read on on on wednesday night
[1:35:07] revelation chapter 10 and then we say
[1:35:09] it's the other
[1:35:10] we see the revelation chapter 10 starts
[1:35:13] with a conjunction
[1:35:16] and and every verse is a conjunction and
[1:35:19] and and and and crowd and and and when
[1:35:21] the seven thunders and and the angel we
[1:35:24] shall we stand on the earth and and
[1:35:26] swerve by him that live it but when it
[1:35:28] came to the seventh verse
[1:35:33] we see a contract
[1:35:37] praise the lord
[1:35:39] now
[1:35:40] a contracts in the scripture
[1:35:45] genesis chapter 2. let's go to genesis
[1:35:47] chapter 2.
[1:35:52] there are few verses there there's a way
[1:35:55] i wanted for us to go but uh uh it has
[1:35:58] to be a private bible study for us to do
[1:36:00] that because we don't have time
[1:36:04] we won't have time to do that but it's
[1:36:07] beautiful when you when you study the
[1:36:09] scripture and you and you and you see
[1:36:11] how those things how those things play
[1:36:13] out is very beautiful genesis chapter 2
[1:36:17] let's see here
[1:36:23] let's go to verse 15 genesis chapter 2
[1:36:25] verse 15 and the lord god took man and
[1:36:28] put him into the garden of eden to dress
[1:36:31] it
[1:36:32] and to keep it
[1:36:34] and the lord god commanded man saying of
[1:36:37] every tree
[1:36:38] of every tree of the garden thou
[1:36:42] may freely eat
[1:36:44] but
[1:36:48] praise the lord
[1:36:49] now so that contrast
[1:36:52] is enough to make you to pay attention
[1:36:58] praise the lord
[1:36:59] now if you study through the scripture
[1:37:01] that will give you a lot of few verses
[1:37:02] to look at but if you study through the
[1:37:04] scripture you will see that
[1:37:07] whenever those contracts
[1:37:11] happen
[1:37:12] it shows a time sequence
[1:37:17] praise the lord
[1:37:18] now in this case
[1:37:20] this contrast is announcing
[1:37:23] but of the tree of knowledge which means
[1:37:26] there's a contrast here the v
[1:37:29] that is broken it will change time
[1:37:36] amen
[1:37:37] praise the lord now that is the same way
[1:37:40] in revelation chapter 10. i'm trying to
[1:37:43] help you so you can grab my thoughts
[1:37:44] what i'm going in revelation chapter 10
[1:37:46] an angel and him that swear it and and
[1:37:50] this and then when it came to verse
[1:37:51] seven but in the day
[1:37:54] of the voice of the seven angel that
[1:37:57] that contrast introduced at time space
[1:38:05] are you seeing the picture
[1:38:07] introduced at time space
[1:38:16] genesis chapter 17 let's see another one
[1:38:19] there
[1:38:20] then we can go on
[1:38:27] maybe we need to have this all night
[1:38:29] bible study amen
[1:38:39] genesis chapter 17 verse 19 let's go
[1:38:41] quickly and god says sarah the wife
[1:38:43] shall bear thee a son in thee and thou
[1:38:46] shalt call his name isaac
[1:38:49] and i will establish my covenant with
[1:38:51] him
[1:38:53] for and ever i will establish my
[1:38:55] covenant with him for an everlasting
[1:38:57] covenant and with his seed after him
[1:39:01] and
[1:39:02] as for ishmael
[1:39:04] i have heard thee behold
[1:39:07] i have blessed him and will make him
[1:39:10] fruitful
[1:39:11] and
[1:39:12] will multiply
[1:39:14] him exceedingly 12 princes shall he
[1:39:17] beget and i will make him a great nation
[1:39:21] but
[1:39:26] you see god is contracted but
[1:39:30] my coveting
[1:39:38] praise the lord
[1:39:41] i'm not i'm not uh i'm not i'm not
[1:39:44] refusing ishmael
[1:39:46] i'm not denying that he's your see but
[1:39:49] what i want to do
[1:39:51] my coveting
[1:39:53] purpose
[1:39:55] my predestinated plan
[1:39:57] must come by isaac
[1:40:05] praise the lord
[1:40:07] amen
[1:40:09] oh i didn't know why ishmael would be 12
[1:40:11] princes hey you would get great nation
[1:40:13] oh you would but
[1:40:16] [Laughter]
[1:40:19] oh my
[1:40:22] but in the dead of the voice of the
[1:40:25] seven engine
[1:40:28] when he shall begin to sound
[1:40:30] at that that bracket of time
[1:40:36] what god is saying everything that is
[1:40:37] happening on earth on the the sixth
[1:40:40] hills and all the judgment when that
[1:40:42] angel begin to sign i will wrap
[1:40:45] everything up
[1:40:51] it's going to be a quick shot work
[1:40:54] that's what he's announcing
[1:40:56] but when he shall begin to sign time
[1:40:59] shall be no more
[1:41:09] oh my
[1:41:11] praise the lord
[1:41:13] praise the lord
[1:41:16] amen now so you see see that's verse
[1:41:21] seven
[1:41:22] and and and when when he make that that
[1:41:26] proclamation in verse seven but when
[1:41:28] when this when the seven angel begins to
[1:41:30] sound time shall be no more what he did
[1:41:33] he went straight and gave john his
[1:41:35] commission
[1:41:37] because when this thing is happening
[1:41:38] john it's time for you to eat the bubble
[1:41:40] because there is no time
[1:41:44] so go to that angel and get the bark
[1:41:48] because there is no time
[1:41:55] when you recognize the dead
[1:41:57] the message of your day
[1:41:59] there's no time to food around there's
[1:42:02] no time to play church games
[1:42:10] praise the lord
[1:42:12] there's no time to play church games
[1:42:17] the commission is go and take the book
[1:42:20] and eat the book
[1:42:24] because thou must prophesy
[1:42:27] again
[1:42:29] thou must prophesy
[1:42:32] again
[1:42:34] and i think that's where
[1:42:38] most people get trapped
[1:42:42] most people get trapped
[1:42:44] because many
[1:42:47] have not really studied and understand
[1:42:50] the again moving
[1:42:53] so they lean into impersonation
[1:42:58] and think that they need to have
[1:42:59] discernment gifts
[1:43:02] or they need to have the vibration of
[1:43:03] the hands
[1:43:06] but what the scripture tells us we will
[1:43:09] read read read some quotes here but
[1:43:11] let's let's do our bible studies first
[1:43:13] amen
[1:43:14] praise the lord genesis chapter 4
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:20] genesis chapter 4 verse 25 the bible
[1:43:23] says
[1:43:26] and again adam knew his wife
[1:43:33] amen
[1:43:35] and again adam knew his wife
[1:43:39] and she had a son by the name of seth
[1:43:46] amen
[1:43:47] so seth was an again woman
[1:43:51] for abel
[1:43:53] that king killed beautiful
[1:43:59] are you are you seeing the picture
[1:44:03] amen
[1:44:13] because
[1:44:15] the two sons we know
[1:44:17] that one was in the in in in in in the
[1:44:21] god sea line
[1:44:23] and the other one was in the serpent sea
[1:44:26] lion
[1:44:27] praise the lord
[1:44:28] so you see god is making that church to
[1:44:32] prophesy again
[1:44:34] why because he said unto
[1:44:37] eve
[1:44:38] the seed of the woman will bruise the
[1:44:40] head of the serpent
[1:44:46] praise the lord
[1:44:50] so you see that again woman uh
[1:44:53] is it's not an impressing nation
[1:44:57] it's not wearing that you know a bell
[1:44:59] bucker with brother branham and wearing
[1:45:01] cowboy hearts and going there and you
[1:45:03] know no
[1:45:09] are we together
[1:45:13] if you are doing it because of
[1:45:14] appreciation
[1:45:16] that's fine
[1:45:17] but if you are doing it thinking that
[1:45:20] you are in a gay moment
[1:45:23] praise the lord
[1:45:32] are we together
[1:45:34] if the church said well let's let's
[1:45:36] let's let's bring pentecost back again
[1:45:39] this they saw all their things and
[1:45:41] related to the apostrophe let's do that
[1:45:43] you will be breaking scripture because
[1:45:45] god allowed that time to spread the
[1:45:47] church
[1:45:49] so the a gay movement is not for you to
[1:45:51] not start selling everything you know i
[1:45:54] saw seed to the church so seeded
[1:45:57] that's not a gay moment
[1:46:04] are we together
[1:46:05] genesis chapter 8.
[1:46:13] if you read genesis chapter 8 you will
[1:46:15] realize that
[1:46:20] there was an again moment of the dope
[1:46:23] i love this one
[1:46:25] man i love it
[1:46:27] praise the lord
[1:46:28] hallelujah
[1:46:30] i love this one
[1:46:32] there was a game movement for the dove
[1:46:37] you realize that
[1:46:39] after noah sent the raven out
[1:46:43] it never came back
[1:46:46] amen
[1:46:47] praise the lord because he saw what
[1:46:49] attracted its nature
[1:46:52] a lord it loved dead rotting meat so he
[1:46:55] saw it all over the place
[1:46:58] it was having its revival
[1:47:02] praise the lord
[1:47:07] and he waited and waited and i mean the
[1:47:10] raven was not coming back
[1:47:13] glory be to god
[1:47:15] amen
[1:47:17] hallelujah
[1:47:21] you know how
[1:47:23] god
[1:47:25] is
[1:47:26] he's he's he's just
[1:47:28] a master of wisdom
[1:47:31] do you know how the raven
[1:47:34] feeding elijah stumble a lot of people
[1:47:38] yes sir
[1:47:41] i stumble them because when they look at
[1:47:43] the raven in genesis chapter 8
[1:47:47] and knowing the nature of the raven
[1:47:50] then how can god use the raving
[1:47:53] to feed a prophet
[1:47:54] [Laughter]
[1:47:58] oh my goodness
[1:48:00] uh how we wish that it was just dove all
[1:48:03] through the bible
[1:48:05] but no
[1:48:06] praise the lord
[1:48:07] god was showing in time how he will
[1:48:09] raise up people
[1:48:12] in their struggling nature
[1:48:14] but they will still sustain the voice of
[1:48:16] elijah
[1:48:20] praise the lord
[1:48:22] amen
[1:48:27] now so right here in genesis chapter 8
[1:48:30] you see here there were three sending
[1:48:33] out of the dove
[1:48:35] but only two again moving
[1:48:39] that will completely break
[1:48:42] scriptural time
[1:48:48] there were three sending out
[1:48:50] of the dove the dove went out the first
[1:48:52] time a room about the emphasis grabbing
[1:48:56] down the emphasis
[1:48:58] well it found no place
[1:49:00] to rest
[1:49:03] that was the emphasis
[1:49:07] he found no place
[1:49:12] so he came back
[1:49:14] and with that no one knew that the water
[1:49:17] would stay
[1:49:18] all over the place
[1:49:21] praise the lord
[1:49:24] now
[1:49:25] the second again moment was the dove
[1:49:28] went out
[1:49:29] and this time it fought a place
[1:49:33] because it had to rest on the tree to
[1:49:36] pick the leaf
[1:49:40] a an olive tree to rest upon
[1:49:43] and to pick the leaf and then it came
[1:49:45] back
[1:49:48] praise the lord
[1:49:50] hallelujah
[1:49:53] amen
[1:49:54] and then the third time when noah sent
[1:49:56] it
[1:50:00] the door never came back
[1:50:03] praise the lord because the dove has
[1:50:06] already announced on the second
[1:50:09] coming
[1:50:12] he announced on the second coming
[1:50:16] that the land was ready to be inhabited
[1:50:20] so the dog went
[1:50:23] but that will break scripture
[1:50:27] it will break the again principle
[1:50:32] praise the lord so that dope have to
[1:50:34] return
[1:50:36] and that's why we saw on the river
[1:50:38] jordan
[1:50:39] [Laughter]
[1:50:44] when john
[1:50:47] jesus came to john in the river
[1:50:50] what did the scripture says the spirit
[1:50:52] of god
[1:50:54] came down like a dolph
[1:50:56] what was the dog looking for resting
[1:50:59] place
[1:51:00] and the holy ghost find rest in a man
[1:51:06] [Applause]
[1:51:10] the word of god cannot be broken
[1:51:15] it cannot be broken
[1:51:17] god's word can never be broken if god
[1:51:20] said you will have a gay moment you are
[1:51:23] going to have a gay moment i believe
[1:51:26] that this bride is going to prophesy
[1:51:28] again god is going to have a people
[1:51:30] raising the people up is not coming in
[1:51:32] the future it's happening right now
[1:51:35] i believe it's happening right now
[1:51:38] [Applause]
[1:51:40] just this gone uh
[1:51:42] uh uh uh uh december 10th the first day
[1:51:45] in virginia brother gyro was just
[1:51:47] telling me there they were having their
[1:51:49] all night meeting their pastor slo-ma

[1:51:56] oh and those garlic brothers stood
[1:51:58] around him and praying light back into
[1:52:00] his body
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:08] praise the lord

[1:52:20] it's not coming in the future church
[1:52:22] it's happening right now it's going on
[1:52:24] right now you better go to the angel and
[1:52:26] get the book

[1:52:31] you have eaten the book
[1:52:46] it's not coming in the future it's
[1:52:47] happening right now
[1:52:54] oh my goodness

[1:53:00] my my my mind see brother brandon verbum
[1:53:02] talks about this
[1:53:04] this this vision that this brother had
[1:53:06] about him a dream that his brother had
[1:53:07] about him there in the west where he
[1:53:09] talks about you know the brother
[1:53:11] dreaming and brother branham streaming
[1:53:13] in you know in his dream and saying i
[1:53:14] would ride this straight again i would
[1:53:16] ride this straight again now see when
[1:53:18] brother branham talks about it in on the
[1:53:20] wings of a snow wipe door he explained
[1:53:23] what a man
[1:53:27] praise the lord
[1:53:29] you read about the dream or in north in
[1:53:31] that no of him that is where he said
[1:53:33] that uh talks about the brother dream
[1:53:35] but yeah over in on the wings of a snow
[1:53:37] white door he said why me an old man
[1:53:41] suffering all my life
[1:53:44] why did he hire me now
[1:53:47] i believe
[1:53:48] i will ride this straight again
[1:53:51] i got a message to bring
[1:53:55] and i
[1:53:56] and i say to my father tonight lord
[1:54:00] your seven
[1:54:02] reporting for service
[1:54:06] brother bennett was not talking about
[1:54:07] him raising or when he died
[1:54:10] to come back to life again that's not
[1:54:12] what he was
[1:54:20] saying praise the lord
[1:54:24] all of these people you know believing
[1:54:26] in the return ministry well let them
[1:54:28] keep waiting i'm waiting on the coming
[1:54:29] of the lord
[1:54:35] he says and i said i said to my lord
[1:54:37] father tonight lord your seven is
[1:54:40] reporting for service now better man
[1:54:42] have already as that's that's why he
[1:54:44] says pleading in the wings of a
[1:54:45] snow-white dog how he have experienced a
[1:54:48] supernatural healing for the thing to
[1:54:50] have bothered him all of his life
[1:54:53] now he says i'm ready now for service
[1:54:55] i'm ready to go in the field now because
[1:54:58] he has healed me
[1:55:10] god's only provide a pledge see what he
[1:55:12] says here he says i'm getting pretty off
[1:55:15] and i taught
[1:55:17] will there be another revival
[1:55:22] praise the lord
[1:55:24] will there be another revival
[1:55:29] he says i will see you another time
[1:55:32] what is he talking about
[1:55:34] so you see the whole thing about
[1:55:37] uh writing the trade again is is is is
[1:55:41] god dealing with the people
[1:55:43] the same thing that uh uh god told uh uh
[1:55:47] uh joshua there over in in the promised
[1:55:50] land
[1:55:51] he says he says circumcise the people
[1:55:55] the second time
[1:55:57] no it was not a double circumcision
[1:56:00] but he was telling them because they
[1:56:02] went all through the weight of their 40
[1:56:04] years without the covenant of
[1:56:06] circumcision
[1:56:08] and now they were about to enter into
[1:56:10] their inheritance
[1:56:12] god was telling more joshua revive
[1:56:16] because you have to realize that the
[1:56:18] land that they were coming to enter that
[1:56:20] was the very land where god told abraham
[1:56:23] to circumcise himself and this entire
[1:56:25] household how can they come and take the
[1:56:28] inheritance that's the problem with the
[1:56:29] church people want the power of god
[1:56:31] without the baptism of the holy ghost it
[1:56:34] can never happen you cannot have a
[1:56:36] change of life without being born again
[1:56:42] [Music]
[1:56:45] just your intellectual thoughts of the
[1:56:47] ma of the message is not enough to put
[1:56:49] you in the rapture
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:52] there has to be a quickening power
[1:56:54] there has to be a power that would come
[1:56:56] down that's the reason why
[1:56:58] he said the the the the the dynamics of
[1:57:02] this church
[1:57:05] will be another again moving
[1:57:09] if you refill wish me it was filled
[1:57:11] first
[1:57:12] [Laughter]
[1:57:15] the dynamics of this church would be the
[1:57:17] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:57:19] not an intellectual conception
[1:57:24] it's not going to be a bash of which
[1:57:25] church you came from
[1:57:28] it's going to be your life
[1:57:36] will there be another revival where i
[1:57:38] see another time he says and just
[1:57:40] remember
[1:57:42] from the west will come the white house
[1:57:44] rather
[1:57:46] we
[1:57:47] this time it's not uh
[1:57:49] he said we
[1:57:54] we
[1:57:56] will ride this trail again
[1:58:02] so he's tied to a revival
[1:58:05] that the bride will have a revival
[1:58:07] they will come and quicken him
[1:58:09] there will be a people that will take
[1:58:11] god at his word
[1:58:18] we will ride this trail again
[1:58:25] oh praise the lord
[1:58:30] oh praise the lord
[1:58:40] are we together
[1:58:44] are you ready for the move of god
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:48] you expecting the move of god do you
[1:58:50] have any expectation
[1:58:53] praise the lord
[1:58:55] amen
[1:58:56] oh praise the lord
[1:58:59] hallelujah
[1:59:01] amen
[1:59:03] praise the lord we will ride this
[1:59:05] straight again we will have another a
[1:59:06] gay moment

[1:59:11] movement

[1:59:30] the land was not given to him he he paid
[1:59:32] for it
[1:59:33] he purchased the land
[1:59:35] he had the title lead
[1:59:39] praise the lord he had a tie today
[1:59:43] and because he had a tie to the he had a
[1:59:46] right
[1:59:48] to another again woman
[1:59:50] how will it happen
[1:59:53] it would take isaac
[1:59:58] it would take isaac to revive those
[2:00:00] whales
[2:00:04] because it was his inheritance
[2:00:08] he had a right to
[2:00:17] are we together
[2:00:21] joseph would give his brothers another
[2:00:23] again moving

[2:00:34] can you imagine how his blood was
[2:00:36] boiling

[2:02:40] and the amazing thing is that
[2:02:43] he
[2:02:44] brought them to denim
[2:02:47] and set them in their birth order
[2:02:52] he said them in their birth order from
[2:02:54] reuben
[2:02:55] to simeon
[2:02:59] praise the lord
[2:03:01] they are looking at one another
[2:03:03] how
[2:03:05] he says come and eat and this one no
[2:03:07] don't say that you go there
[2:03:09] you come here
[2:03:11] you come here
[2:03:18] glory be to god
[2:03:21] i believe you're thinking in your mind
[2:03:22] all mine
[2:03:25] oh my what is this
[2:03:28] who is this man
[2:03:31] praise the lord
[2:03:34] amen
[2:03:35] so to give them on a gay movement
[2:03:40] he put his silver cup
[2:03:43] now remember savor
[2:03:46] means redemption amen
[2:03:51] so he put his silver cup
[2:03:53] in the mill
[2:03:59] put their money back in everything
[2:04:02] and when they went a little bit he says
[2:04:04] go after them
[2:04:08] praise the lord while we were yet sinner
[2:04:13] amen
[2:04:14] while we were yet sinner
[2:04:17] they had no idea what was happening
[2:04:21] and they come and find the cop there oh
[2:04:22] my goodness why you have to do no i
[2:04:25] never did it
[2:04:28] praise the lord the first thing
[2:04:30] everybody found their money in their bag
[2:04:33] oh my goodness how would i go to prison
[2:04:35] for this
[2:04:38] what is this what is the law doing they
[2:04:40] say oh because of joseph oh my goodness
[2:04:46] praise the lord
[2:04:49] but he was giving them another a gay
[2:04:52] movie
[2:04:54] praise the lord
[2:04:56] why because
[2:04:57] there was a dream
[2:05:01] that all the brothers
[2:05:04] had to bow down to him
[2:05:06] [Music]
[2:05:08] so they had to prophesy the game
[2:05:12] amen
[2:05:13] you see that's the reason why the
[2:05:15] scripture says the the the testimony of
[2:05:17] jesus is a spirit of prophecy
[2:05:22] and you see how how how the church word
[2:05:24] has wrong wrong with that because the
[2:05:26] only no preferences to be in the mouth
[2:05:30] so they can say anything and say you
[2:05:32] know i prophesy i feel good you know
[2:05:35] i prophesy
[2:05:37] but the spirit of christ
[2:05:40] the testimony of jesus what jesus is
[2:05:43] doing in your life
[2:05:45] is a spirit of prophecy is prophesying
[2:05:48] that we have a living god that can
[2:05:50] change a sinner to sin
[2:05:54] a god that can raise people above habits
[2:05:58] and change your life for the better
[2:06:00] praise the lord
[2:06:03] amen
[2:06:04] you can be as stubborn as whatever
[2:06:06] stubbornness you want
[2:06:08] you that you never brought yourself on
[2:06:09] this earth
[2:06:10] let god get ahold of you
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:15] praise the lord
[2:06:16] amen
[2:06:17] be sobbing you can pluck your ears to
[2:06:19] the word of god
[2:06:21] but let god get a hold of your heart
[2:06:35] oh my
[2:06:38] praise the lord
[2:06:41] the bell has just rank
[2:06:46] praise the lord
[2:06:51] i've not started preaching here anytime
[2:06:52] since i'm over
[2:06:58] trying to find
[2:06:59] my footing
[2:07:00] [Laughter]
[2:07:02] [Music]
[2:07:04] praise the lord
[2:07:06] somebody i love can say i'm finding my
[2:07:08] bearings
[2:07:15] amen
[2:07:19] praise the lord
[2:07:21] now so you see
[2:07:25] we're going to have an again moment
[2:07:26] let's let's get to the philadelphia
[2:07:28] church let's read this quickly so we can
[2:07:30] find a place to close here
[2:07:32] uh uh
[2:07:34] but burban suppose to be doing something
[2:07:37] with some of the saints after church
[2:07:40] this afternoon so
[2:07:42] let me now wear you out
[2:07:45] let's read from the philadelphia church
[2:07:46] so we can we can just wrap this thing up
[2:07:49] the lord bless us
[2:07:51] as long as the holy spirit has helped
[2:07:53] you to grab the talk that's what is
[2:07:55] important because he is the preacher i'm
[2:07:57] not the preacher
[2:07:59] you know i'm not the preacher you know
[2:08:00] he's the preacher
[2:08:02] so if he helps you to grab the talk he
[2:08:04] can preach the rest of the message to
[2:08:05] you without me saying anything
[2:08:09] now brother bram said in the
[2:08:10] philadelphia church he says in order to
[2:08:12] understand
[2:08:15] the wealth
[2:08:16] of
[2:08:17] many involved
[2:08:19] in behold i set before you an open door
[2:08:24] and no man can shut it
[2:08:27] we must now recall what has been said
[2:08:30] about each age
[2:08:32] running over into another
[2:08:36] each age
[2:08:37] running over
[2:08:39] into another
[2:08:41] overlapping
[2:08:45] interrupting
[2:08:50] there is an overlapping
[2:08:53] a melting or fading into
[2:08:57] rather
[2:08:58] rather than an abrupt end
[2:09:02] there will not be an abrupt end
[2:09:07] the sequence of time will happen one
[2:09:09] thing will happen to another
[2:09:12] there is not an abrupt end
[2:09:18] the lord amen
[2:09:26] and melting and fed it into rather than
[2:09:28] an abrupt end all a clear-cut stat
[2:09:34] no
[2:09:36] we'll go on
[2:09:38] and just like the world is happening the
[2:09:40] rapture will take place the tribulation
[2:09:42] will happen
[2:09:43] the 144 thousand will be caught
[2:09:50] the wedding stop it will just happen
[2:09:52] like that
[2:09:54] there is not an abrupt end there is not
[2:09:56] a clear cost tax
[2:10:08] this edge
[2:10:11] particularly flows into the next age
[2:10:14] and that
[2:10:16] only this this is overflowed into the
[2:10:20] last age but the last age
[2:10:23] is in many respects
[2:10:25] simply and carrying on of the six age
[2:10:32] praise the lord
[2:10:36] you see that's the reason why
[2:10:38] the the loss is messenger cannot cannot
[2:10:42] be identified
[2:10:44] because people understand they
[2:10:46] understand they agree with the sequence
[2:10:48] of the reformation
[2:10:50] they saw the effect of luther
[2:10:54] message praise the lord
[2:10:58] amen and the same thing also with every
[2:11:00] age
[2:11:02] that's the reason why
[2:11:04] all of these denominations and different
[2:11:06] things because when god raised up a man
[2:11:08] like he did with luda and
[2:11:11] and and he stomped the church with his
[2:11:12] thesis and brought a revival the people
[2:11:15] got stuck to that what what they were
[2:11:17] waiting on if if a new thing would
[2:11:20] happen you know it would be announced we
[2:11:22] would come to the council we will all
[2:11:24] agree that now yell at move on god don't
[2:11:27] work like that
[2:11:30] praise the lord
[2:11:35] while they were holding
[2:11:37] and becoming former and and establishing
[2:11:40] principle and staying this is what
[2:11:42] luther said this is why we believe god
[2:11:44] just moved on
[2:11:46] right in england a young man john wesley
[2:11:49] started preaching
[2:11:51] foreign he never even knew he was a
[2:11:53] messenger
[2:11:55] praise the lord he just started
[2:11:58] so you see there is no glare across that
[2:12:05] that's the reason why unless we
[2:12:07] understand scriptural pattern you will
[2:12:09] never understand the church ages
[2:12:18] so he says this is in particular is a
[2:12:21] carrying on of the sixth age the seven
[2:12:24] age
[2:12:25] a very short age
[2:12:30] why because
[2:12:31] but
[2:12:32] in the days of the voice of the seven
[2:12:35] angel
[2:12:36] it's a short age
[2:12:39] it's the age to wind up everything
[2:12:42] is the age to tie the loose ends
[2:12:48] praise the lord
[2:12:50] so you see the six ages going on and the
[2:12:53] pledges are falling and this thing is
[2:12:55] happening and that thing is happening
[2:12:57] the mighty angel comes down in
[2:13:00] simplicity the word still going on and
[2:13:02] different things are happening
[2:13:06] that verse 7
[2:13:08] is your last age
[2:13:11] when that angel begins to sound
[2:13:20] it's a very short age
[2:13:23] a lot of everything that was happening
[2:13:25] was all all part of the six age
[2:13:30] the healing revival was all part of the
[2:13:32] sixth age
[2:13:34] it was just the continuation from azusa
[2:13:36] street
[2:13:40] praise the lord
[2:13:44] you see that's the reason why this
[2:13:45] baptist preacher was he was attracted to
[2:13:48] what he saw among the pentecostal people
[2:13:50] because it was just going to be a
[2:13:52] continuation of the pentecostal blessing
[2:14:03] a very short age
[2:14:06] gathers up
[2:14:08] into itself
[2:14:09] for one quick work
[2:14:12] all the evil of every ages
[2:14:16] and yet all the reality of pentecost
[2:14:20] [Laughter]
[2:14:22] praise the lord
[2:14:24] amen
[2:14:25] we read that wednesday that every
[2:14:27] preceding age inherit the thing from
[2:14:29] from from the next age
[2:14:31] all the evil of all the ages
[2:14:34] but yet the pentecostal blessing is here
[2:14:37] in simplicity
[2:14:44] the reality of the pentecostal blessing
[2:14:46] not emotion
[2:14:48] we don't have to make up
[2:14:51] that's the reason why i don't care how
[2:14:53] much it says if it does not line up with
[2:14:55] this word there is something wrong with
[2:14:58] it
[2:15:00] oh yeah because we're being prophesied
[2:15:02] we've been told there will be false
[2:15:04] christs there will be false anointing
[2:15:06] words
[2:15:08] operating amen
[2:15:18] gather up into one one quick work all
[2:15:20] the evil of every age and yet all the
[2:15:22] reality of the pentecost
[2:15:24] once the philadelphia edge has
[2:15:28] has about
[2:15:29] run is caused the laodicea ash quickly
[2:15:32] comes on the scene and brings forth the
[2:15:34] ties and the weights toward the harvest
[2:15:39] it's a gathering age
[2:15:43] it's a gathering age
[2:15:45] that's why we will have a one word
[2:15:47] church we have a one word government
[2:15:49] it's it's uniting time
[2:15:51] that's the spirit of the age to bundle
[2:15:54] amen he said gather the weeds that's
[2:15:57] what jesus says gather the wheat into
[2:16:00] the bomb
[2:16:01] and the ties must also be gathered to be
[2:16:04] burned
[2:16:14] are we together
[2:16:18] may god help us to learn this lesson
[2:16:21] even as we know the people
[2:16:24] of the sixth age learned patient
[2:16:28] we read the history of the lives of
[2:16:30] these great christians
[2:16:33] praise the lord
[2:16:36] there's a podcast that i listened to
[2:16:40] this this christian guy was able to
[2:16:42] gather
[2:16:43] uh a testimony
[2:16:45] of uh of uh
[2:16:47] of men through the ages
[2:16:50] that in in in in the simpliest way the
[2:16:52] homeless way that is too forgotten and
[2:16:55] how they were persecuted how some of
[2:16:57] them were killed and in praising they
[2:16:58] called it's called the forgotten
[2:17:01] podcast if you want to listen to it it's
[2:17:04] it's really edifying
[2:17:08] we read the history of the life of these
[2:17:11] great christian men
[2:17:13] these great
[2:17:14] christians
[2:17:16] what a contrast we see between their
[2:17:18] lives and ours
[2:17:21] for they were so patient
[2:17:25] and quiet and today
[2:17:29] we are all overcome
[2:17:32] in over impatient and haste
[2:17:37] we want it to happen
[2:17:39] praise the lord
[2:17:42] amen
[2:17:44] why the church now on fire because you
[2:17:46] are now on fire
[2:17:50] well why is this happening
[2:17:54] we are not patient
[2:17:56] praise the lord to be able to work with
[2:17:59] our young people
[2:18:04] we we go on with with that with that
[2:18:07] touch in our mind you know we we build
[2:18:10] we build our uh uh
[2:18:13] uh expectation
[2:18:15] we are dealing with an internal god and
[2:18:18] yet we put time to our situations
[2:18:22] expecting god to meet those things by
[2:18:25] our time he's not working on your time
[2:18:29] amen
[2:18:33] praise the lord
[2:18:36] instead of appreciating the things that
[2:18:37] god is doing in our lives
[2:18:40] we become impatient with ourselves
[2:18:44] praise the lord
[2:18:46] and we write ourselves off broadband
[2:18:48] says see the patient that they had in
[2:18:51] that age
[2:18:53] oh may god help us
[2:18:57] he goes on to say to them because you
[2:19:00] because you have taken my word
[2:19:03] and and live it and thereby become
[2:19:07] patient the world make them patient
[2:19:10] they were not they were not resting on
[2:19:11] their emotion
[2:19:14] you know appreciate your your
[2:19:16] experiences the different way that god
[2:19:18] is dealing with you but never put your
[2:19:20] experience above the word of god
[2:19:26] praise the lord
[2:19:31] the lord there with me in this way the
[2:19:33] lord there with me that way oh it's all
[2:19:34] wonderful
[2:19:36] but he want us to grow in his word
[2:19:39] praise the lord because the word is a
[2:19:42] constant daily dealing
[2:19:46] the word is not a one-time dealing it's
[2:19:49] a constant daily dealing
[2:19:54] that's why the prophet of god says a
[2:19:56] christian
[2:19:57] reads their bible
[2:19:58] and prayed every day because it's a
[2:20:03] constant daily dealing
[2:20:07] it's not a one-time thing
[2:20:16] because you have taken my word and leave
[2:20:18] leave it and thereby become patient i
[2:20:21] will keep you
[2:20:22] from the hour of temptation we shall
[2:20:25] come upon the word this is this is the
[2:20:27] in in
[2:20:28] in in the book of revelation to try them
[2:20:30] that lord upon the earth now here again
[2:20:34] we see the overlapping of two ages
[2:20:38] for this promise has to do with the the
[2:20:42] end of the gentile period
[2:20:45] amen
[2:20:47] which accumulate
[2:20:49] in the great tribulation
[2:20:52] praise the lord
[2:20:54] there is an overlapping year
[2:20:56] the the great hour of temptation is the
[2:21:00] tribulation
[2:21:02] in the real bible saints
[2:21:04] when the bible expressed that in the
[2:21:06] book of revelation that a great hour of
[2:21:08] temptation is speaking about the
[2:21:10] tribulation but see what is going to
[2:21:12] happen because the age overlaps
[2:21:17] and the seven edge comes right in as a
[2:21:20] parenthesis
[2:21:22] as a contract to get a people ready for
[2:21:24] the rapture and sweep them out we are
[2:21:27] going to experience some of the things
[2:21:29] of the six age
[2:21:31] some of the things that's the reason why
[2:21:33] all of these things are happening we are
[2:21:35] all experiencing the uh uh coronavirus
[2:21:38] we are all you know wearing max and you
[2:21:40] know getting sick and taking medicine
[2:21:42] and believing god and all of that
[2:21:47] praise the lord
[2:21:51] now so i will keep thee from the hour of
[2:21:55] temptation we shall come upon
[2:21:58] all the world to try them that do it
[2:22:00] upon the earth this verse is not a
[2:22:03] declaration that the church will go into
[2:22:05] and through the tribulation
[2:22:07] if amended it will have said that but
[2:22:11] but it said i will keep thee from the
[2:22:15] hour of temptation
[2:22:17] praise the lord
[2:22:18] so which means that there are there are
[2:22:20] pre-tribulation things that will be
[2:22:22] building
[2:22:24] while we are here
[2:22:27] praise the lord
[2:22:29] that there are pre-tribulation things
[2:22:31] that will be building we we just
[2:22:33] experienced it just in the past two
[2:22:34] years all the nations came to the place
[2:22:37] and you know while now they agree on the
[2:22:40] marks mended
[2:22:43] praise the lord
[2:22:47] and whoever you were i mean whatever you
[2:22:49] think that that was their agreement and
[2:22:51] that's what they wanted
[2:22:56] whether you were the president or the
[2:22:57] king
[2:23:00] praise the lord didn't you see queen
[2:23:02] elizabeth with a little pretty max on
[2:23:03] her face
[2:23:09] now so he goes ahead and he says here it
[2:23:12] does not mean that the church will go
[2:23:14] through the tribulation
[2:23:15] it just means that we will experience a
[2:23:18] pre-tribulation thing
[2:23:20] and god will also use those things
[2:23:24] to wake us up from our sleep
[2:23:29] he will use those things to clean out to
[2:23:30] help us clean ourselves up
[2:23:35] let's go ahead yeah there are a few
[2:23:36] things i just just want to read this and
[2:23:38] then we'll be close
[2:23:40] this tribulation is exactly like the
[2:23:42] tribulation in eden
[2:23:45] it will be a very inviting
[2:23:48] proposition held up
[2:23:51] in direct opposition to god's command
[2:23:55] the word
[2:23:56] comparing it with the second telling eve
[2:24:00] god know that when you do this
[2:24:03] your eyes will be open and you will be
[2:24:05] like god
[2:24:07] praise the lord it would be an appealing
[2:24:10] thing
[2:24:11] it would be an appealing thing and see
[2:24:13] what he says
[2:24:15] i want to make more comment but
[2:24:17] let just read here
[2:24:21] this temptation is exactly
[2:24:24] like the temptation in eating it will be
[2:24:26] a very inviting proposition held by a
[2:24:29] direct opposition in god's
[2:24:31] uh to god's com
[2:24:33] commanded word and year from the
[2:24:36] standpoint of human reasoning
[2:24:39] it will be so very right
[2:24:43] that's how many
[2:24:44] will go right
[2:24:46] into
[2:24:48] the world council of churches
[2:24:50] many will sit right in the message
[2:24:53] church
[2:24:57] because it will look so convincing
[2:25:03] praise the lord amen
[2:25:06] yet in another sense there are others
[2:25:07] that will be so radical
[2:25:11] and they will go on the far end
[2:25:14] we have to stay in the middle of the way
[2:25:18] praise the lord
[2:25:23] and yet from him from from the the
[2:25:25] standpoint of human reasoning it will be
[2:25:27] very it will be so very right so
[2:25:30] enlightening and life-giving
[2:25:32] as to fool the world
[2:25:35] only the very illet will not be full
