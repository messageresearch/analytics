blood pressure pill or so but they conveyed our prayers to keep us in prayer amen so we just we just want to thank the lord [Music] there's a song that uh that brother aaron is playing i think the

an empty vessel i want to be [Music] praise the lord the lord bless you that will be it for the singing this morning let's stand to our bibles praise the lord saint john chapter nine i think john chapter nine saint john chapter nine we know while john chapter nine have uh uh very familiar story of a child being born blind and because of all form of teaching and sin is the cause of all sickness so the his illness was attributed to either his parents sin or his grandparents sin and all of that but let's just let's just take from verse 35. jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him does thou believe on the son of god he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him praise the lord i thought i taught about vasa uh he answered and said who is he lord uh how did he know that jesus was lo there was the lord and uh and jesus said unto him thou have both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him and jesus said for josh man i am come into this word that they which see net my seed and their day which seed might be made blind and some of the pharisees which were with him heard those words and said unto him are we blind also jesus said unto them if ye were blind yes you have no sin praise the lord if you don't see it it's not a problem to you but when you see it you are guilty the road sign says if you see something say something you see that to the airport if you see something say something because when you see it you are guilty jesus said unto them if ye were blind yes you have no sin but now yes say we see therefore your sin remain it let us pray heavenly father we humbly come to you this morning asking your mercy your grace lord and your love we we just want to thank you for this opportunity that we can come as your children dear lord to worship you father lord god is it's wonderful to know when a man eyes open spiritually he sees you like the blind man did and the scripture says and he worshiped he said lord i believe and he worshiped may that be father lord i will our attitude lord may it be father i will approach to you you don't reveal your word father for us to find uh self-proclaimed personality you reveal your word for you to be seen and the god for you to bring us to the place of worship dear lord we just ask that you will bless the portion of your word that we have read bless the inspiration that is on our heart to guard him we just pray that father you are the preacher take us out of the way this morning and minister to the needs of your children we pray father god for the sake in our midst we remember sister carrick again father we ask that you will strengthen her lord raise her up for father god we pray for sister mimi also strengthen her too lord jesus we pray father god for young frederick lord god heal his heart and we we're just remembering all of these knees you are more than able father all the sick body lord gather in the midst of the believers lord we pray the saints around the world we commit them in your hands lord father we love you we appreciate you now in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seat wednesday night we were speaking on uh [Music] on on the subject of of speeding and and then the whole weekend i got i got caught up on and thinking on that but i actually had this thought on my heart to preach on this morning but i was thinking about the whole subject about speed because it's been a long time i thought about it uh when i realized something brother branham said you know it just it just grabs your attention like that in and then but i just thought that we're going to get back to what i had on my heart and prayed to speak on this morning that are entitled looking at the bigger picture looking at the bigger picture because i believe that uh that was the reason of the opening of the seals it was god wanted us to see the bigger picture i believe that's the reason why god has sent us a son of man ministry in this last day because there's a picture that was being played out right from the beginning of time and on the uh uh the the ministry of malachi 4 we have an opportunity to see the bigger picture but i think the problem uh of why is is difficult to see the the the bigger picture is because we are living in an age that have a sight problem praise the lord have a side problem and medical science have told us they have they have some very big you know beautiful names on it and i just thought that i have not done my tongue surgery yet so pronouncing some of those needs might tell my guests talk to the roof of my mouth and i might not be able to preach my message so i would just stay with uh short sightiness and long silence praise the lord the medical science have taught us that those are some of the side problems that we could have and anything beyond that we might go to blindness praise the lord and i believe that is some of the reason uh you know because everything that have come to us as uh as an illness in the body is from it's from it's from the spirit realm amen it's it's from spirit brain those are demon powers that are that uh you know manifesting in and affecting our body you know whether the headache or the by pain in our body or cancer whatever it is so uh i believe that is the reason why uh we struggle to see the bigger picture because we we find ourselves in in this situation you know i was thinking about that you know with with all of the things that you know god has done throughout the ages and the different men that that he have used to be able to bring us to where we are and uh and and and uh i mean the message of the hour this morning i was i was going to preach on the greatest move of god which also have to do with uh speed that we were talking on on on wednesday night uh but i just thought that well let's let's go this direction and if the lord can help us to see uh you know uh talk about the bigger picture maybe we will get back to that great move of god but it's is very interesting you know the move of god has has has been uh limited to the different revivals uh that uh uh you know wesley was a move of god luthor was a move of god the pentecostal had a move of god and uh uh and and and the message of the hour you know is is the greatest move of god you know in terms of of revival but i was reading and as i was telling brother branham said uh uh when we get today i'll share that with you he said uh he that believe it or mean he quoted this he said he that believed on me is passed from death unto life he says that is the great move of god the thing that will make you to pass from death unto life a social speed that god takes that the human mind cannot understand it cannot grab him amen when a man's life passed from death on to life he says there's the greatest move of god amen praise the lord but let's look at uh this thought of looking at the bigger picture praise the lord amen we all know that uh over and over brother branham taught us about god having a great drama we will read the idea under the message or the deity of jesus christ he says now notice a little wider than the word syria be normal yet you will see me for i will be with you even in you to the end of the world that's right he is here now in in the days how his big picture always revolved up and made the same thing come to pass that we are seeing now the great drama is set and we are and we are ready now to see great things happen the church the church has been brought from the cradle that's right pentecostal rocked it down yeah that a few years ago back there while the people throw stones and made fun and laugh at and she grown to maturity that's exactly right the hour is here hallelujah that's right that's uh uh what i'm interested in to see god's church coming together now we have been beat out and and beat out there by the hour is coming when god throwing the blanket across us all to draw us in praise the lord amen praise the lord and when we know that that uh uh there's there's uh when we spoke on the answer to the devil's question we know there's there's one other thing you know that god is doing and uh uh he says if i be lifted up i would draw all men unto me praise the lord we know that is that is uh uh truth oneness you know truth oneness uh bringing us back to the place of being co-equal that's true oneness and uh so god uh spraying the blanket across and drawing every one of us back to him praise the lord now so well uh brother bannon go ahead and he says here he says he's standing now for his people down you said the the great thing in the last year when these things come to pass mine the great exploit will the people then and men of faith will do the hour has come down that when the great drama and picture of god set forth of the lottery and joy said in the last day you know it shall come to pass i will poured out my spirit upon all flesh sons and daughters uh i shall prophesied for my handmaiden and all of that and we and we realized that brother brandon i'm talking about this and and he's just going to to to bible prophecies and you know and and and what god has promised to do so we see that's the reason why uh we have dispensation of time we we have to know that god that we have to deal with he is the great intent of spirit amen one time he feel all time and space praise the lord there is no way we could understand god's purpose for our life or god's program for our age if god did not uh broke us into time and dispensation that's the reason why we have dispensation that's the reason why there was certain different things that took place in the airfield he abroad all his children at the same time he could have done it you know but he set up all of this and we see that also in a plane of creation it was not nothing impossible for our god to have created everything one day but yet he came forth and the bible says and and the first day he says let there be lighting and and the darkness rode away and god himself stopped himself and says it is good then the next day he created something else and he said it is good praise the lord brother branham in question and answer make us to our question answered in genesis he make us to understand that god did there to give us an opportunity to be able to see his great plan of redemption praise the lord even though they say it's not impossible for him to have created everything one day but he did that he broke it up into day in time just so we can be able to have an idea that this great intent of god has a plan praise the lord and he has a purpose for everything glory be to god amen and over and over you know brother branham said it throughout the message you know he says the hour has come now that when the great drama picture of god is set forth a great drama picture of god praise the lord are we together amen all of these things what a dead water time that we are living in in the message of the ministry of christ he said and this whole bible to my opinion the whole set up is a dramatic story just starting out of eating coming out through the gate on out a way the weight of the cross leading right back again just all one big picture that has placed out of his mind i can imagine seeing god before there was even a foundation of the word praise the lord and we know that foundation of the word was in the back part of god's mind praise the lord it was his thoughts in his mind seeing god before there was a foundation of the word for there was a moon sigh anything seeing him said in spaciano and in his mind he drew out that picture praise the lord what it will all be and everything he just spoke out and said let there be praise the lord amen now even in the beginning when god said let there be light then after a while he came back again and then he says well you know let the sun give light to the day the moon and the stars in night you know and then he starts to explain he starts to break it down and he starts to break it down because it was a big picture let's travel yet a little bit with this maybe the law will help us as we go along and in his mind he drew out that picture what it will all be and everything he just spoke and said let the beating and everything just begin to come into its place isn't he wonderful to think of that and then seeing in his great sovereign love to come down and save lost sinners like myself in you praise the lord you know i had brother brown talking on the tape this morning as we were playing uh uh uh on that uh uh gabriel uh purpose there and then the seventh week of how god had to blind the jews because of me in you praise the lord it was all part of his big picture praise the lord it was all part of his big picture can you imagine that in his in his great mind he saw us sitting here this wouldn't have happened you wouldn't have been here this morning that's praise the lord if he was not part of his part of his great picture praise the lord that's the god that we have to deal with there is no moment there is no moment there is not a meaning or a second that just involves itself it was all part of the plan it was all part of his great picture if we were just thinking think about it there is not a meaning there is nothing that happened on earth there was an interruption to his plan there was nothing that happened that took him by surprise praise the lord all right i might have taken us by surprise this whole covey thing took us that surprise we never even thought that it would have lasted this long but it was not a surprise to almighty god praise the lord hallelujah when you think about it it kind of for humble you to know that there are things that are part of god's great picture even concerning my life that i don't know about that i don't know about there are things concerning i mean there is in god picture he already saw it it's going to be is going to happen just like the way he saw it and yet we don't have no idea about it praise the lord or they humble us that way about ourselves how much more about other people praise the lord how much more about other people how much more about uh uh our children our loved ones praise the lord amen you know sometimes you you the lord have you i help you you have this thought on your mind you you you are gearing to go in one direction and then he's taking you in another direction so that's just the way i feel i feel like i'm going slower than i thought i would preach this morning but it's okay as long as the lord is in control that's that's what matters amen that's exactly what matcha he says i can imagine seeing god there from the foundation of the world and in his mind he drew out a picture what it would be everything he just poked it out when he said let it be he said and then seeing in his great sovereign love he come down and saved lost sinner like myself in you i can't understand no wonder the person all love of god how rich how pure amen fathomless strong is forevermore in deal the saints and the angel sing dead yeah him he says and and and there's not one scripture in the entire bible but what will dovetail and connect with the next scripture every bit of it is one great big picture oh that's the reason why the scripture cannot contradict itself scripture cannot fight against scripture it's just it just won't great big picture we just need a man that can put the puzzle together for us to be able to see the picture praise the lord the entire bible but what would dovetail and connect with the next scripture every bit of it is one great big picture all the way from the guiding of eating and the way to the cross back to the garden again just one great beautiful picture praise the lord amen i'm so glad that you feel that way you feel happy to know that is one great picture [Applause] praise the lord and i do not mean to be sacrilegious by making this mistake on this statement he says but if it's a mistake god forgive me but it's just like hell jesus poser that you have put in it together you have to have the holy spirit to put it together just like a puzzle you get the picture on one side and you look at the picture and you put the pieces together and the scripture is of no private interpretation it was wrote by the holy spirit and the holy spirit is the only one who can revere it for it is head from the eyes of the wise and the pudding and it is revealed to babies such as will learn so if you don't watch if you don't use the mind of the spirit of the holy spirit to put it together you will have your sin all mixed up praise the lord amen for instance like like a cow picking grass on top of a tree and and and just like that praise the lord and all of that and i mean and we can go on and on and and uh you know and build this picture and uh all you know read on what brother branham talk about a great picture and over and over having a lot of quotes down here but it will take all of our time so we we realized that when you think about that when you think about that think about the life of our father abraham amen god promised him to be the father of nations praise the lord the father of nations and abraham in his mind whatever the way that he received that that message from god taught that it was going to happen tomorrow you know and brother branham would dramatize how the wayne he and his wife the shopping the guy everything for the baby and and all of that and and uh you know and and they got themselves ready i mean uh uh uh uh whatever time they got married they were happy and excited to have their first child but god in his mind wanting abraham to be the father of nations he he had a big picture and abraham's side couldn't see the full picture praise the lord and i feel that's uh i feel them believing i think you believe the same thing with me that and that is the will with every one of us yeah we find ourselves coming to reality and understanding that god has placed us in a great drama and as we go on with life it keeps on falling and new things we keep learning of ourselves some things comes and we are so surprised that we can even do it i've never never even thought i could do it praise the lord amen we ain't a great drama on people that's the reason why brother branham says we can never use this our human brain he liking it onto a canary brain to understand the ways of god for his ways our past finding out praise the lord his ways are past finding out amen water baptism he says well that's the way the bible wrote between the lines you know of many of my salmon like of god turning abraham and sarah back to young people you have to read between the line to see how what the scripture says you you have to know but it will never get off of line see in between the line will just bring the line together and make one big picture now it got to be a love effect for uh with god before you can ever get it cause the holy spirit wrote the bible and the bible says that is of no private interpretation now let's get back to the scripture that we read here in john chapter nine we all know the story this is child bomb blind you know when and uh uh he's out there begging for arms and and uh i mean you you think about this tribe on blind you you think about uh you know uh uh the the the the family that we are born in you think about you know uh uh some situations that we have found ourselves in that was not our choice praise the lord it was no choice of this child to be born praise the lord as much as it was no choice of us to be born in the family that we we find ourselves in or to be born from the nations or to be born with some uh uh uh some less abilities that we have praise the lord then we realized that uh he was he was born on a a religious system you know that uh that has drifted from the word of god and they have got their own private interpretation you know that is uh uh i mean a sickness is because of sin well you see that uh uh that interpretation is not is not all together wrong just like the interpretation sometimes that we put to things in our lives it's not all together wrong but it's not the full picture amen the way we interpret things of our life and the way we interpret things of other people's life when they are going through things it's not all together wrong because what you're doing is that you're using your knowledge that you have from the scripture the scripture says this and because the person did this or because i did this that's what this is happening to me the bible says you will reap while you saw oh my goodness because i did this that's what is happening to me but we know in the big picture god allowed that to build character in our lives praise the lord because he said in his word that he's faithful and just to forgive us when we confess of our sin praise the lord and then if he forgive us then why should we go through a trying time praise the lord looking at the bigger picture glory be to god so we see here that uh you know what i i mean uh uh can you imagine going to a church and and and then the pastor just keep re-echoing that and you have had it out of your life you know uh i mean uh uh uh maybe uh you were you were not faithful enough and and that's the reason why your your child was born blind and you know and every time the preacher gets on on talking about sickness he he connects us and then he's looking right in your eyes and he's telling you praise the lord amen and that that has it has the ability for a parent to distinct themselves or or or separate themselves from their child because they are looking at that child as a product of sin praise the lord they are looking at the child whereby it's not even the child choice to be here was your love choice that brought him but now because this thing is is is happening to them all because the preacher in his narrow brain has has attributed sin to this child so now the child is put in a situation praise the lord glory be to god oh you see that you see that time and time again sometimes some people are dealing with situations in their lives you know they get so mild with this person guess who might with another person and and then if there is a child that is involved they start getting mad with the child because they are angry with that person praise the lord you know they start getting mad with this innocent child you know i don't even know where your father is don't be giving me hell don't get me hurt when the child never did anything to you but because of the wrong that has happened the child now has to deal with that the child has to suffer for there that's just how narrow our the the vision of our mind is praise the lord i mean that that that that is not only in uh in uh uh a man in a woman relationship it also happened i mean uh uh you know uh two men will get into disagreement and then uh uh they take it on the children sure don't come on my property you kids don't come on my property come and play your boy when those children don't have anything to do with it that's a short sightiness praise the lord the same if i would disagree with a man and think that you will be in sin to leave this church and go and fellowship there praise the lord because i don't agree with your brother and says you don't have to go to that church you are completely out of the word of god you're walking down to hell if you ever leave this church and go somewhere else praise the lord but that's that's just how you know uh the human side is praise the lord that's how the human side is you know we we read a scripture or we find a cult and then we we i mean it bless our heart we get so inspired by it and not able to put all the cults of the prophet together all the scripture together we just hold that one court and take a stand she said you know what the prophet said it i have the court i can show it to you praise the lord but it's written also you have to remember that was jesus answer to the devil it's written also praise the lord so if you find one quote you must realize always tell yourself it's written also maybe i have not seen the also yet but it's written also oh praise the lord amen glory be to god somebody is slowing me down but it's okay praise the lord but you see that's that was the problem they had here you know they got so stuck in the lord and they put this interpretation to the lord you know when and uh yeah even at the place where now the uh uh the boy has received his side the parents could not even come to his defense because they were so affected the high side was so affected by wrong thinking and wrong teaching that it could not even come to their son defense they said go and ask him he's off age and he can talk for himself praise the lord and sometimes that's i mean it's it becomes so difficult when the enemy have affected our our spiritual side that sometimes is it's not it's difficult for us to see even what the lord has done for us on calvary on calvary he answered the same question on calvary he paid the price on calvary he said it is finished but sometimes we are so affected in our spirit that is hard for us to see what is finished at cavalry and the things that he have paid for at calvary but branham says this great picture was from eden all the way to calvary and when it gets back to calvary it's taking us back to eating [Laughter] a cover every time in space praise the lord but that was the problem the problem actually was a sight problem so jesus year dealing with the pharisees he tried to identify what their problem is praise the lord amen he's trying here to make them to realize that they are short-sighted you realize that uh in matthew uh chapter four chapter 5 jesus said unto them it is written in the lord praise the lord thou shall not commit adultery he says but i say unto you amen it's written in the lord thou shalt not do this but i say unto you and the bible says after that simon he says wow what a strange doctrine who is he for him to say i say unto you praise the lord why because they taught the high they had the lord they thought they were righteous keep us of the lord they had everything that moses said but now he's coming and bringing a bigger picture praise the lord so we realized that that was the problem they had it was a sight problem glory be to god and then we can see here that you think about it there in genesis chapter 3 the bible says adam our father and our mother eat the word in eden praise the lord for adam to be able to give the name to all the animals and it will just please god so which means he had the ability to see what was in the heart of the father he had such a an eyesight that he could choose a name and say you are lying and god said that's exactly what i would have named me he has such an eyesight that he could see right the desire of the father hallelujah praise the lord amen but when sin was introduced another eyesight was introduced but ram said thank you man's felt they lost the holy veil amen and they had another our side the bible says they were naked and they never knew now they know that they are naked praise the lord so they are thinking that they are now seeing better than the way they used to see you see the way that adam was seen it was through a spiritual sense brother branham called the sixth sense he was seen as truth as spiritual sins that connected him to the heart of the father that whatever he does the father was okay now he's cracked from the sexes and all he can see is colors and shapes all you can see now is color and shapes no more he can see to the heart of the father praise the lord say this is tall this is shot this is green this is blue and now to him with the natural eyes that is filling he said wow wow what a sight glory be to god amen you see why the mysteries of god was revealed is to take our eyesight back to the heart of the father praise the lord we can for us so see those things that we please the father praise the lord amen we might never uh be able to uh geologically place it right but there is something in the heart of the believer that is longing to please god a man i know seven you know the the the seventh week of daniam and i know the seven seals and the church ages but there is just something in the heart of the believer that is longing to please god if i can just want to find my place if i can be positionally in christ if i can do those things that would please god amen glory to his name that was that's the reason of the new birth to give us the original sight the sight that adam wants heart praise the lord amen and that's the reason why you see through the scripture jesus and the apostles through the scripture they connected the eyesight with the heart praise the lord oh my what a time we are living in what an age that we are living in glory be to god you know the devil knows have a saints he knows the promises that are in the world malachi falls turn the hearts of the fathers the children back to the hearts of the fathers amen it's turning our faith turning our sight giving us desire to seek for the pentecostal blessing for you know what he planned to do in our age he said i'm going to bring them exactly what would distract them you have to remember brother branham says we are in the ih this is the i age he says there is nothing above the eye amen he says that's the highest intelligence after the eye he sees the brain in in all of that yeah in the message thinking man federer he says we are in the seeing age the top there is no more faculty above that that you can move out wally to know and your outward body there is no faculty above the eye praise the lord he says you know from your nose you can smell your lip you can speak your hands you can feel and reach your feet and so forth but you can't go any further then your eyes malacca fall has come sight has come and it shall be light in the evening time oh walk in the light praise the lord he explained it like this in the message christ has revealed in his own word he says when god gave the the dream to dani i mean nebuchadnezzar the dream that daniel interpreted god gave him a dream and the emphasis on the dream was uh was from the head of god to the to the fourth the toes of clay and iron and god was presenting a a a gentile kingdom praise the lord and and we know the head of god was babylon and and and we know the the medians were were the savior and we know that the greeks came the brass and and and then the roman empire is dying praise the lord and papa rome and pagan rome is the iron and clay now and he says in that vision there was a stone that was caught out of the mountain which of course that stone was christ the revelation of god and in in in in a dream the stone crash the image in the legs praise the lord amen and then he says from that time god started building another image but it was a spiritual image coming from the foot praise the lord amen that's the reason why we have the great missionary age after pentecost amen they were carrying the gospel everywhere because god was coming from the feet praise the lord and right in california azuza god came to the mouth with the gifts of tongues coming back to the church [Music] oh praise the lord and then after the azusa revival we are back to the ih [Music] praise the lord we are back toward the ih the prophetic age are we together christ is the minister i mean christ is revealed in his own word for jesus himself is the interpretation of the bible when he made a manifest in the age he made a manifest in the age that the part of the body of the part of the body is being made manifest which means he brought the word he brought the word and the anointing to the age at the time that part of the body was being manifest so in the faith age he anointed those men to go on herself and burghead the wall for hours to carry the gospel because that was the feed age they could go anywhere are we together that part of the body if it's the hand it must be the hand it can be the hair age if it's the voice age he says it can be the footage and now we are at the ih and now the next is him himself to come seeing prophetic praise the lord remember we're talking about looking at the bigger picture praise the lord with people finding problems with the message and problem with brother branham and problem with message people then problem is because lao disher has got to blindness and when a person is getting the blindness slowly your eyesight is going slowly people around the message their eyesight is going the things that they never used to allow the beginning to allow it slowly they are losing their eyesight that's the reason why we become so critical instead of looking at the bigger picture praise the lord mercy is for us alone now for the next person now for the next person see down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went to the ground the complete seat and then it comes through the feet looter come back out through wesley and then pentecostal the tongue edge the lip see now it is now is in the eyes prophetic of malachi 4 and so forth and now there is nothing else left for it to come but he himself to step into that amen praise the lord so we see all of these things he says the next is the intelligence and we and we have no intelligence of our own is his we have no sight of our own how can a man foresee these things how can he do it praise the lord going back to a person life when they were born when you were just a small girl you got frightened by the dog that's the reason why all of your life you be nervous praise the lord the same intelligence that adam had that could go right back to the heart of the father praise the lord god has sent that intelligence to give us a picture of our life while we went through the things that we went through in our life why different things happen for us to be able to look at the bigger picture and raise our hands and say thank you jesus praise the lord what an intelligence how can a man foresee those things how can he do it is god himself is becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like adam praise the lord amen what a picture what a picture praise the lord i mean seeing the big picture praise the lord i was following the documentary of of uh two boys that were born of the same parent one father their father was was an american and their mother was a polish woman i think he was he was a u.s soldier down there and then he left and and the lady found herself to have a child and uh and they were born and because of the poor condition of life they were separated into different uh homes for adoption praise the lord you know when and uh as as he grew up you know the other one was he's he was you you you have this hurt you know you have this this disappointment you know in your heart what what happened what went wrong that my parents have to give me offer adoption and there is there is not there is not enough information and you just go with this hunting hurt in your heart you never know it until you've been there praise the lord and uh after some years they were older i mean all the in in i think their late sixties or so when he got uh united and one uh came from california he went to meet his brother in in in poland praise the lord and then after i mean with all the connection and he gave them all the the information you know as they put the picture together and the other older gentleman he started to weep because now he understood why his mother had to give him offer adoption because of the difficult condition of life that she was living in having the full picture brought him to the place and you could tell that there was a sense of bitterness in him so i mean thought of hating his parents why they ever brought him on earth just for him to grow up and realize that the people that he thought was his parents were not he perry then where my parents are but with all of those years 60 plus years when he stands to put the picture together he wept like a baby and he wept like a baby and and starts to appreciate his mother sometimes you have to see the bigger picture for you to appreciate the god of heaven and earth praise the lord the other one says no wonder i always just love america he says no one i just love america because i think when he grew up he he wanted to travel to america he said because that's where my father came from oh that's why we love heaven but sometimes you have to see the bigger picture for you to appreciate that never be to god you know we go to school and and sometimes we think uh uh you know because we have got out of high school to college we're now so smart we can just put things together praise the lord oh i see why this happened oh i see why this happened and then we gave ourselves an explanation sometimes it puts us into a place of a very bad attitude we become critical we become judge mentor because we have fared our mind with a very narrow picture with a very narrow picture the picture that is not even from your eyes it does not even go over your nose we feed our mind with that and then we start to see the word true dead we start to judge people through that narrow vision praise the lord short sightedness you ever see somebody so short-sighted they have to read their read their bible like this that's how many christians many believers has become like even when brother branham talks about the bride he talks about the foolish virgin he talks about the different groups the different groups in god's redemption plan praise the lord sometimes our short-sightedness just put us to the place where we think that we are above the word we are the bride of jesus christ so every other christian group they are the nomination birds they are bound for help for help and it just gave us a wrong attitude it just gave us a wrong attitude showing that we got the whole picture wrong and sometimes with those wrong attitude and wrong perception we have we kick ourselves out of god's mercy because if you don't have the bigger picture there is no way you can appreciate the mercy of god there's no way you can appreciate what this message is because you're born in a message home by message parents you went to message church that's all you know until you get the bigger picture you can never appreciate the privilege that you have because let me tell you to every privilege there is a responsibility that comes with it to every privilege there is a responsibility that comes with it that's why jesus was telling those pharisees if you were blind it would have been better for you there will be no judgment against you because you don't know anything praise the lord but because you claim you can see you claim that you are born in a message and you are the bride he says there is a responsibility that comes with that praise the lord seeing the bigger picture oh my goodness a picture that runs you you think think think about all of this man david look at david life he was so happy with his slingshot and and being the shepherd ball but in the back part of god's mind when god out of the mark of jacob he said the scepter will be in judah when god allowed jacob to prophesy that david was in the back part of god's mind david was in that picture praise the lord and you ever say he never knew nothing about that out there taking care of his father's sheep praise the lord i'll just say i uh christ is a myth i mean christ is revealed in his own word and brother brandon i'm talking about that how god give a man a nature david just loved sheeps he just fell in love taking care of his father's sheep because he was built to be a king right from birth he never had no i thought of that picture but that was the thing that was driving his life and the thing that is driving your life is because of your position in the great picture of god the thing that is driving you closer to god and driving you to church and giving you the desire to live right is because in the big picture of god he has placed you somewhere as a son of god as a daughter of god praise the lord he loved to be out there with those ships he slept with them he picked them up he smelled like them glory be to god until the prophet samuel came out there he never even realized it samuel came out there took an oil pour over his head it never meant nothing to david he didn't mean anything to him praise the lord he just thought that this old man loved me you look at samuel in the face he says this old man not love me praise the lord but god was anointing him for the position for his place in the big picture praise the lord glory be to god and while he's there taking care of his father's sheep something just came over him he went to his father i need to take some food on my brothers they've been gone since they have not come yet slowly god was rolling him into the next page slowly god was rolling his life into the next page and he took the fool like an uh assassinate boy got out there saw the whole place quiet what's happening is the king of israel dead then goliath came out he make an arrow because this young boy was honored an anointing that he did not understand when goliath came out and made his boss praise the lord it was it was almost when goliath said that it was almost like almighty god just passed a page praise the lord did it now understandably a page was passed in the big picture he will no longer go back to heaven sheeps now he will fight for the army of the living god and said who is his own circumcised philistine god has passed a pitch in the bigger picture [Music] [Applause] praise the lord they just thought that he was assassinated by no the anointing was getting ahold of him glory be to god the anointing was getting ahold of him praise the lord his brothers all got nervous but they couldn't stop him because god has already passed a page and when god passed a page in your life there is nothing you can do to go back [Applause] when god passed a pitch in your life there is no devil on hell there is no demon can pull you back because you are part of a big picture and god is about to rule your life to the thing that you have never dreamed about praise the lord glory be to god amen oh my nobody could stop david praise the lord saul called him and gave him a lecture he said one thing that i know praise the lord all these things you are talking about alma spear and all of that i don't understand it you know you see this slingshot oh king let me tell you something at the back side of the desert praise the lord god just brought him out of a fresh revival of delivering from the from the hands of a lion from the mouth of the bed [Applause] praise the lord and you know the rest of the story hey man when goliath came out to make his boss david stood up for the challenge when the enemy comes as a flaw god will raise up a standard and david was the standard praise the lord all the devil can come in this age with all of his filthiness and and and and gender problem and politics problem but god has a bride god has a people in this age to meet the challenge of the age praise the lord you see that's what brother branham said if i had a choice there is no other age i would have choose to be in than to be a standard for god in this age [Applause] [Music] oh my praise the lord amen glory be to god david won the battle he took goliath head off took a sword came back presented himself to the king and prayed a song and started ryan david on the chariot little shepherd boy he just looking over and showing what's going on can't even understand what is happening to him praise the lord we see just like we spoke on wednesday night david was in the move praise the lord he was caught up in a speed something that was happening so fast that he could not pull together praise the lord and that's what happened when a man or a woman's life is caught up in the move of god when god placed his hand on you he moves you so fast that your brain cannot catch you praise the lord just like i said wednesday night you see when you get on the plane and the plane is ticking off the speed that it takes to take the plane off when it gets above this atmosphere it goes in a more faster speed more faster speed to get you to california than you driving praise the lord it gets in a more faster speed but what happened is that as the plane gets up and it's it's and it's getting you know through the spears and and and uh uh uh changing attitude what happened is that that speed up there slow down for you to catch up with it praise the lord because if that does not happen you're going to be so terrified in the heavens but there is something that happened mysteriously that that speed of the airplane slowed down and your body catch up with it in so much that you can sit on the plane and be comfortable remove your seatbelt get up and start walking praise the lord naturally you will never walk in a speed like that [Music] but what makes you comfortable for you to get up and start walking in an airplane praise the lord when they were just taking off in a lighter speed you were terrified you were holding the both seats cracking your teeth together now it's in the heavens and you are now [Music] comfortable amen praise the lord that is just at fortes of the things that happen praise the lord when the spirit of god moves in the building and picks you up you feel so comfortable that you don't want the preacher to stop you keep saying preacher preach him [Applause] praise the lord and those that are now on the flight are wondering why are you making noise because when the plane gets up there the noise get more louder oh praise the lord amen looking at the bigger picture praise the lord when things happen to us in our lives some of those things are so hard to put together praise the lord the loss of a loved one i mean whatever you can think about different things they are so hard to put together even things that are in our past we don't we don't want to remember them praise the lord but if you just sit back if you can just step back a little bit and look at the bigger picture praise the lord you will be grateful for everything for every air that you breathe for every moment praise the lord you will be grateful he will say thank you lord i don't understand it i don't understand it as much as the membranes of fate is hurtful to me but i thank you because if you didn't know how to purpose i would not be here if you didn't know how to purpose i would not be here praise the lord because if it is if if it was left to the devil he would have used the least opportunity the least opportunity of giving you an evil thought will run you mad if it is left to the devil the least opportunity of affecting your mind with an evil thought you will go mad praise the lord because there are things that have happened in our lives that you feel so disappointed you feel so disappointed so hurt how could this happen most especially in the message in the church but because god have a purpose that's why we are here amen praise the lord that's why we are here glory be to god amen but at least david knew that that was not the end of the day he sat in the house there with uh with uh uh uh sword and they bringing him food in the morning in order serving him in this life is so strange to him oh my goodness is this the message i mean the message oh my goodness is this the opportunity that comes being in the message praise the lord amen it was not too long he realized that the fellowship became a battleship and sword is throwing javelins at him in the message any message oh my goodness oh my goodness i think he was rubbing his eyes am i seeing am i really seeing is this happening to me glory be to god at this stage of life he's so happy he's been treated as a prince but when his days of trial started then he started remembering the days of a shepherd boy running over the hills running over the hills and the mountains he thought he could he would never get back to that life again he thought the days of being a shepherd boy is over i don't have to sleep in the field now i have beds and i have people that i can ring their bell they can bring me food they'll change my blankets and everything but when god turned another page in the great program he was in the field running [Music] in a bigger picture he was running he's back again sleeping under the moonlight looking for caves praise the lord as much as god use a shepherd life to teach him how to fight and be brave god also used a shepherd light to teach him how to run from danger [Music] you know when you get a burger and you put all the things in it to eat and you eat that burger god pulls something down in your body that distribute the nutrients praise the lord and that's the same way god does spiritually everything he takes you true he knows how to break down that nutrients a time for you to be happy and the time to to be silent praise the lord david i was not a prince and being fed his back picking up stones throwing it in the head all that is running to his mind is the days of his shepherd boy he praise the lord even the men around him could not even understand how can a king be so speedy on the mountains it was in his days of tutorship when god was training him praise the lord sometimes the things that god allow us to go through is just for only one purpose and god will take us through all of these things in our life think about john the baptist going to the wilderness at nine years old and nine years old boy going to the wilderness coming out at 30 years old only for a six-month ministry you look at it and says all the people in that church they were so wicked they couldn't even remember zacharias the boy mother is there his father is dead they just left him to himself short sadness how could his parents allow him to go to the witherness and i mean we we can put all our interpretation to it but it was god's way of building a man for his place in the bigger picture praise the lord oh looking at the bigger picture we can talk about it we can talk about it we can sing about it it would take eternity to bring us the fullness praise the lord there are things that we will never even understand in this life it will take us before his throne to bring us the fullness praise the lord some of the things you think about in your life you just sit there and cry that day when the father starts to give you the full picture you will rejoice because you will be so grateful the lord you allow me to go through this looking at the bigger picture praise the lord oh my we can go and go and go along here but we must find a place to stop praise the lord praise the lord david said i will keep the lord before me we have to be grateful we have to have a thankful heart praise the lord and i started listening to brother brandon there this morning as the tip was playing yeah i was just listening and you know and he was talking about you know those those jewels how they were blinded you know and and and and and all of these gentile writers you know uh uh they they get so uh mad and you know the silent god and it talks about how god rejected his people and and they try to bring things out to prove that there is no god what kind of a god will allow his people to go under the hands of hitler and yet call them the people of god but you think about it if god did not allow that we would not be here this morning yes we will not be here this morning every one of us for us to be here there were people there were forerunners that god sent before us they were men that god anointed man that god kept beyond their understanding praise the lord even your parents were foreigners they had to do things they had to make choices even when you never wanted to go to church they drag you with church praise the lord amen billy graham little brother mev he was on an interview one time and they asked him uh melvin have you have you ever you ever did uh drugs or alcohol say well yeah i remember i did drugs daddy dropped us to church whether we wanted to go on that so that's the only drug that i did glory be to god amen i want to read about another bigger picture here then we can go to the lord and pray brother branham said christ is revealing his own word he says and they are going to find out someday that they are not seeing a hundred and fifty million years of light space either talking about science praise the lord they can put their telescope up there they can shine in the heavens i mean they can you know put it up there he says but one of these days they will realize they are not seeing the hundred fifty million years of life space they are going right around in cycles how are they going right around the cycle because they are using an instrument that they bail and they are looking at a dimension that is far from them praise the lord but that dimension is growing so fast that it looks like it's just instill it's almost like brother branham said when you look at the heavens in the night you see those stars the lord beautiful they look just like they are so close you see that one close to that one he says there is there is million miles of space between them but to you and myself when we look at them they look so close praise the lord so very branham says when they shoot uh uh their telescope or whatever they look up the it looks like that said 100 million miles he says but it's just going in cycle and it's growing so fast that the thing that they are seeing a lot of million years of space you are going to find that one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you are still right here just in another dimension faster just in another dimension faster praise the lord what make you to believe a god that you have not seen what is faith praise the lord what is faith faith is if i will call it the current or the speed that runs from a believer heart to the throne of god a connection that goes so fast praise the lord makes you to believe that he is here that's the connection that connect us with that word that is right around us praise the lord the faith the supernatural speed that is in the heart of the believer in a god caught up into it one day and he raptured him elijah got caught up into it one day and he was not and that same thing is going to sweep your bride away one of these things praise the lord amen such a speed we were talking about the word being powerful sharper than the two-edged sword that's what happens to the believer you know like when brother branham says walk in the light and see more unfold we have limited that to just understanding the more that we unfold is the more things we will understand but it's not just understanding the more that will unfold is to see how the world would change our life you'll find yourself loving god more than you used to love him you'll find yourself serving god more than you ever want to talk because while you are walking in the light more we unfall as you walk in the light more will unfold habits will be dropping off praise the lord anger will fly through the window and you will be looking for where it's gone as you walk in the light more we unfold praise the lord a social speed where god makes you to step out of your own nature praise the lord step out of your old nature when elijah rapture and his mental drop praise the lord think about jesus right there in the tomb resurrected god sucked out of the clothes he wore god sucked out of the clothes that's just how it is that's just how the old nature falls out god sucked you out it just falls out like shirt and pain just like when clothes fall from the hanging line when we walk in the light that's how the old nature falls off praise the lord you don't take it off like it was struck no no no it just fall off because the world has brought you a little bit higher [Music] come higher and as you come higher in the word in the love of god in the fellowship of jesus christ your old nature sinks down to the ground praise the lord brother branham says that we close on this sorry for keeping you amen you are going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you didn't fly somewhere else you are still right here too just in another dimension faster than this one praise the lord wednesday night we show you a little bit of that jesus resurrected that very same day he went to the throne of the father to present himself he came back that very same day and met those men on the road of emmaus he broke bread with them and then he left and met the rest of the disciples the very same day just another dimension faster than this one but you see when a believer gets on his way it slows down for you to catch up just like the airplane it slows down for you to catch up praise the lord right through this room is coming colors every color shirt dress whatever you got on his internal laying right on wrecker going through go going around and around the world the bible says the eyes of the lord move it through and forth every time you bap your eyes is right on record he says watch television prove that when you are born god set a record on put on record it don't make much noise for a little while you know that's the little baby till it comes to accountability then the noise starts praise the lord then the noise stands noise in heaven just like the scriptures award in heaven come to our accountability then then the noise starts because there is war in heaven over your body just like michael fought over the body of jesus christ of moses praise the lord then the noise starts praise the lord amen sometimes as as young people we don't understand those noise the effect of those noise and the war in heaven over our body create desires for us and then you start to desire things that you never thought of you desire you want to be like other people praise the lord and i wonder what it is when people do drugs those kind of stupid thoughts that come into your mind is is an effect of what is going on in your heavens then the noise starts the parents are making noise genius stop this their friends are making noise guy let's do it praise the lord the angels are making noise he's the son of god the demons are making noise let's destroy her life then the noise stands praise the lord brother branham says i reckon beginning to play terry comes to accountability then the noise starts he starts saying things and doing things he has to answer for and then when that life ends that or tape is took off and laid in the great laboratory of god praise the lord now how are you going to get around it at the judgment bank and we play right back in front of you every move you make when you think you were so quick that nobody saw you the eyes of god capture you and it goes on record if you think that you were so private that nobody can break into your privacy the eyes of god capture you and it goes on record praise the lord brother branches how are you going to get get around that now how are you going to get around that at the judgment bar it plays right back in front of you every move you made every thought that went through your mind can you see that praise the lord that's another picture lying in the laboratory of god glory be to god amen but you see it in the big picture the big picture that we're talking about is a picture that god had before this picture was captured this picture was recorded after you came to accountability but there was a picture in the mind of god and in that big picture he provided a fountain drain from the man within he provided a fountain drain from a manual vein that when the sinner plunged beneath the floor it recall it erased everything on this record [Applause] oh my goodness praise the lord amen every time that son of god a daughter of god get down on their knees and seek the mercy of god praise the lord he sees your tears he hear your voice and he takes the record and troy in the [Music] fountain [Music] bless you less than 12. jesus draw me close [Music] hello thank you

wrongly josh thinks lord we've been completely wrong oh jesus yes oh god thank you precious lord thank you father thank you lord your ways are not our ways lord your thoughts are not our thoughts of

god you send a prophet lord god father and the minister of god that is revealed lord jesus and the things of god father lord that have come to us in this hour came right from the bigger picture lord how many times so god we read our bible and you think about saul seeking the life of david and he want to destroy the life of david but your prophet said saul was not lost because then because samuel said you will be with me tomorrow it's a bigger picture there are things law that are beyond our understanding things happening in our lives things happening in the lives of our children how the lives

that's the way to find mercy with god you know when david was rejected and he was going down and that man spit in his face and david said leave him [Music] god has a bigger picture brother branham said christ is the minister of god revealed he says david found grace with god [Music] he said david found grace of god and every time you will say lord you have a bigger picture i don't i don't understand this i place it in your hands you find mercy with god praise the lord [Music] it's almost like when nathan told david that's a man that has a sheep and he took another man he had men in it he took the only one that this man had [Music] and david said man i've done that the man should die i will quick sense of judgment they always reveal our guilt [Music] when things happen and we become so quick to judge we become so quick to kick people out of the economy of god [Music] it shows a sense of guilt that you are holding because david wanted to prove himself a righteous king when in his heart [Music] he was guilty he couldn't even wait for the world to come out of neta mouth he says man i've done that that man should die and nathan said david you are the man right but you will not die but olivia was talking to brother brandon he says brother brandon how can you allow people to just say all sorts of things about you he said oh you know i know brother level he's a good teacher but he's so quick on the trigger and sometimes that's the way we are little things we just so quick on the trigger [Music] i need to express myself [Music] if you would just be able to get hold of yourself a little bit [Music] and say god has a bigger picture i may now understand what is happening but lord i know you have a bigger picture praise the lord brother branham said when he said that thing to brother level he said bernie and my wife was saying that he says right there at a vision show on the wall there was something that he was he was praying about waiting for the lord he said right there because he found mercy with god when you find mercy with god he answered you quickly when you take the right answer you take the right choice you say the right thing when heather white said the right thing brother branham says ask whatever you will it please god when you find mercy with god when you take the right attitude when you just don't use your self-righteous brain to put people into it no say well i don't know i don't know why they did that but i think god knows all about it [Music] you are placing yourself in the hands of god and you are placing that person in the hands of god pretty soon god can be able to give you some comfort god can be able to show you something in his word praise the lord let me not stop preaching to you again [Music] the lord bless you praise the lord [Music] what are you okay jehovah turned my life around who had the final say okay that's why you're playing [Music] oh [Music] where there is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh yes he
