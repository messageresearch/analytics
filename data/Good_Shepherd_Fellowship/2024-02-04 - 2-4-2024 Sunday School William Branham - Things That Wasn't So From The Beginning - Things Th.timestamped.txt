[0:26] teing things that wasn't
[0:28] sold I suppose if he come today he'd
[0:31] find the same thing things that wasn't
[0:35] so from the beginning if you always want
[0:38] to know what's truth go back to the
[0:41] beginning go back to Genesis and you can
[0:43] take ever cult and every truth from the
[0:46] day this the plants all begin in Genesis
[0:50] because Genesis is the seed chapter of
[0:53] the Bible and if we want to know what is
[0:56] right go back from the beginning just
[0:58] like I was trying to say last night when
[1:00] God once makes a statement he can never
[1:03] bury from that statement he's got to
[1:05] keep it all the way through what he said
[1:07] in Genesis is the same thing in
[1:09] Revelations and all the way through
[1:11] that's he's God and that's all and all
[1:14] of his words are true now we find out
[1:17] that when Jesus came he found the
[1:20] teachers that had taken the word of God
[1:23] and had perverted it into suit
[1:27] themselves they had taken the
[1:29] Commandments of God and convert uh
[1:32] perverted it into a Creed now remember
[1:36] there's only one
[1:37] Creator and all satan is not a
[1:41] Creator what is sin sin is
[1:46] unrighteousness and unrighteousness is
[1:48] righteousness
[1:50] perverted maybe I'll make it clear there
[1:52] you're mixed congregation you listen to
[1:55] your doctor I'm your brethren to for a
[1:57] man to live with his wife is
[2:00] righteousness he married to her the same
[2:03] act with another woman is death one
[2:05] brings life the other is death see
[2:08] unrighteousness is righteousness
[2:10] perverted what is a lie is the truth
[2:14] misrepresented so that's what Jesus di
[2:17] what all of us will get into as long as
[2:20] we take and add or take away from God's
[2:22] word it's perverting God's word so when
[2:26] Jesus come he found out that they had
[2:29] taken God's word and perverted it and
[2:32] made a tradition of
[2:34] man and he said why do you with the tra
[2:38] uh uh change the word of God by taking
[2:41] their traditions and changing the word
[2:42] of God making it say something that it
[2:45] really did not
[2:46] say we find out that he found that in
[2:49] his day and he'd find it here today and
[2:53] him in the presence or in the person of
[2:56] Holy Spirit the same God that always has
[2:59] been dwelling in his people in the form
[3:01] of the Holy Spirit it Witnesses out
[3:04] through the True Believer that man
[3:06] perverts God's word to fit their Creed
[3:09] instead of making their Creed fit God's
[3:12] word amen I want somebody to find the
[3:14] Apostles Creed in the Bible as we had
[3:17] said today I believe in the Holy Roman
[3:19] Catholic Church the communion of saints
[3:21] anything communes with the dead is
[3:23] spiritualism there's only one mediator
[3:25] between God and man amen a man Christ
[3:28] Jesus that's all amen there's no other
[3:30] mediator so anything they prefer the
[3:33] things making an Apostles Creed if the
[3:35] Apostle had any Creed is acts 238 he he
[3:38] had that's what they preached
[3:40] continually and and pounded into the
[3:42] people they must repentance towards God
[3:44] and so forth that is if there's any
[3:46] Creed in the Bible that would be it it's
[3:48] the Apostle Jew amen so they uh all the
[3:52] leadings of the Holy Spirit stay with
[3:54] the word and if any man or Angel ever
[3:57] says anything contrary to the word
[4:00] Galatians 1: 18 said let him be a curse
[4:02] it must be the word of God Paul said if
[4:05] an angel from heaven comes to you with
[4:08] any other gospel and that which you've
[4:09] already heard let him be a curseen so we
[4:12] believe that heavens and earth will pass
[4:15] away but God's word shall not pass away
[4:17] because the word is God God can't pass
[4:21] creational pass away but God canot pass
[4:24] away not no place for jokes the pit is
[4:27] no place for jokes I think the word of
[4:30] God should be preached from here with
[4:31] the solemnness of the of the heart and
[4:34] we should remember but just to say that
[4:37] to make this point the old here
[4:40] somewhere in the South one time made a
[4:42] statement that he' rather be standing on
[4:43] the word of God and standing in heaven
[4:45] they asked him why I said because both
[4:47] Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[4:48] God's word shall not that's right we got
[4:52] to stay on the word Jesus when he came
[4:55] he said Moses because the hardness of
[4:57] your heart suffered you a divorce from
[4:59] your wife but it wasn't so from the
[5:01] beginning now we find out they T the
[5:04] Commandments of God and made them of non
[5:07] effect when Jesus came he found people
[5:10] looking to the church for
[5:12] salvation what did they get Creeds each
[5:16] denomination makes up its own Creed and
[5:19] then that's what he found the people
[5:21] depending on the church for salvation
[5:23] and they found manmade Creeds and if you
[5:28] come today and pray and talk to us he'd
[5:31] find the same thing amen man making the
[5:34] word of God fit their denomination
[5:35] giving them Creeds and there's no
[5:37] salvation of creed if it's not the Bible
[5:40] got to be Bible because his word is all
[5:44] we have need of it's his word and his
[5:48] word when he is the word the word of God
[5:51] is God that's all it's his word itself
[5:55] he in the beginning was the word and the
[5:57] Word was with God and the word was was
[5:59] God and the word still God it's still
[6:03] God now we find out that when he come he
[6:07] found the man then taking the
[6:09] Commandments of God and making them of
[6:11] non effect by taking the Commandments of
[6:13] God and suiting it around to meet their
[6:16] Creed so it was of non effect and the
[6:18] church looked the people looked to the
[6:21] church instead of looking to God's word
[6:23] so therefore he said it wasn't so from
[6:26] the beginning we find it the same today
[6:28] as I've qued you times ready this
[6:30] morning and watching that clock it makes
[6:32] me nervous so uh I want to say this home
[6:36] that this is true then in that day as it
[6:40] is now and now as it was then they holl
[6:42] out where is
[6:44] God Amen well they're very thing that
[6:47] they blessed God when they left his
[6:50] word that's the reason we have things
[6:53] the way we do today is because people
[6:55] left the word of
[6:57] God if a doctor a farmer prescription
[7:01] and you added something to it or Tak
[7:02] something away from it you kill your
[7:04] patient right right you've got to keep
[7:07] it just way it's wrot there's enough
[7:09] antidote there to upset the poison
[7:10] enough poison to kill the germ a too
[7:13] much poison it without the antidote
[7:14] would kill the patient and and too much
[7:16] adult without the poison what would it
[7:18] do it would help your patient so You'
[7:20] got to keep it right and that's the way
[7:22] God's word is it's God's
[7:25] prescription yes brother it's God's
[7:27] prescription to these people to every
[7:29] sickness every disease sin and physical
[7:32] whatever it may be it's all met in God's
[7:35] word amen it's God's word it was so at
[7:38] the beginning it was so in the middle
[7:40] age it's so in every age and it's so
[7:42] this morning just the same as it was
[7:44] when he spoken because it cannot deviate
[7:47] one's spe because it's God's word then
[7:50] people today no wonder they cry out days
[7:53] the Miracles has passed there's no such
[7:55] a thing as Divine Healing why do they do
[7:57] it because they took God's word and made
[8:01] their Creed wrapped up in it and they
[8:03] mix the thing wrong and you have got no
[8:05] power in there if an angel a bishop or
[8:08] Archbishop or whatever it might be come
[8:10] and change one word it'll change the
[8:13] whole prescription let's stay exactly
[8:15] what it says what God said let's leave
[8:18] it right like that the churches is gone
[8:21] today they're all going a tantrum
[8:22] somewhere making organizations making
[8:25] denominations bringing people after
[8:27] Creeds instead of after Christ
[8:30] I don't want no Creed but Christ no law
[8:33] but love and no book but the Bible
[8:35] that's exactly what we is that's God's
[8:37] Creed it's God's prescription it's God's
[8:39] antidote for sin it's God's antidote for
[8:42] our healing and it's a it's God's power
[8:45] made manifest to us as we take the word
[8:48] in our lives
[8:50] now we find out that they answer all
[8:53] that where is the god of Moses the
[8:56] reason Moses stayed with God and the
[8:57] things was God was following Moses
[9:00] prescription Moses was following God's
[9:03] word the way that Peter James and John
[9:06] hit the mark every time because that
[9:08] they they followed the word here
[9:11] sometime ago everybody knows I like
[9:13] targeting shooting and so forth and I
[9:16] had a little model 70 Winchester I stood
[9:19] out and at 50 yards on the target range
[9:22] I drove eight bullets through the same
[9:24] hole at 50 yards and it got out a little
[9:27] that you have to fool with it and
[9:29] Tinker with it and I like to do that
[9:31] kind of settle my nerve and I got out I
[9:34] couldn't make it come in I thought it
[9:35] need to Reed it I sent it back to
[9:37] Winchester company they sat back and
[9:38] said oh uh brother brandham or Mr
[9:41] brandham said if that Winchester is one
[9:43] of the best said it'll group an inch at
[9:45] 50 yard at 25 yards I mean a inch at 25
[9:49] yards so that's best you'll ever get it
[9:51] I no different I noted 50 yards I drove
[9:55] eight straight tacks with it so I knew
[9:57] that that was wrong now that's the way I
[10:00] couldn't rest till I got it back now to
[10:02] do the same thing now I'm not one of
[10:04] these people like to hit the splatter of
[10:06] the church say soul so let's just stay
[10:07] with it if the apostles by the word of
[10:10] God by The Commandments of God by the
[10:12] same holy ghost that we got drove the
[10:14] tax to Divine Healing to powers of God
[10:18] if we'll stay with it we know it's so
[10:20] there so stay till we zero in that's all
[10:23] well we know it did at once how is the
[10:25] days of Miracles have pass in Jesus
[10:27] Christ the same yesterday today and
[10:28] forever
[10:30] how can that God be dead that raised
[10:32] again the AL forever more how can we
[10:35] make it to a Creed when God has no Creed
[10:38] God is a person God dwells within his
[10:40] church and you are his church if you've
[10:43] been born again and filled with the Holy
[10:44] Ghost you are God's church God dwells in
[10:47] you he Tabernacles with you when God
[10:50] came down was made flesh and dwelt Among
[10:51] Us what did he do he he spread his tent
[10:54] amongst human beings he he crossed his
[10:57] cast from God to man to become that man
[11:00] might become like him or he become me
[11:04] that through his grace I might become
[11:06] him oh what a great thing we'll never
[11:09] understand what it was no wonder people
[11:11] call out today what is God get back to
[11:14] the word get back to the beginning in
[11:16] the beginning he said to his disciples
[11:18] go ye to all the world and preach the
[11:20] gospel these signs shall follow them
[11:22] that believe that was it get back to
[11:25] that same word will produce the same
[11:27] thing they followed that word and zero
[11:29] in and drove the tax every ta every
[11:32] promise that God made was made manifest
[11:34] if we'll get back that same word they
[11:36] drive the same tax do the same Miracles
[11:38] perform the same things make the same
[11:40] lives make the same creatur raise the
[11:42] dead heal the sick cast stop devil SE
[11:45] Visions prophesy it's the same gospel
[11:47] that drove the tax in if we'll get back
[11:50] to the same like get the gun back in the
[11:52] same condition it was at the first place
[11:54] the vibration all out of it it was Zero
[11:57] that bullet right straight and if we get
[11:59] all the viations of unbelief out of us
[12:01] God's work will see it was at the first
[12:05] beginning that's exactly right it was
[12:07] zero every time if did once it'll do it
[12:09] again don't be satisfied with a Creed or
[12:12] something stay right there until the
[12:13] word zero it reminds me of time when the
[12:18] mother and father Foster father of our
[12:21] Lord Jesus had taken him up to the
[12:23] Pentecostal feast and they went three
[12:25] days journey and and finally they miss
[12:28] him
[12:29] they they couldn't find him that's the
[12:31] way the church has gone now it's gone
[12:33] more gone about 2,000 years journey and
[12:35] miss him here it is the signs everywhere
[12:37] hearing of his coming and they say where
[12:40] is God where is God what come of him did
[12:43] you notice Mary and Jose searched for
[12:45] him among their kin folks but they found
[12:48] him not today we go back to see if the
[12:50] Methodist has got him the Baptist has
[12:52] got him the Presbyterians of the Luthers
[12:54] noer they didn't find him neither will
[12:56] we find him today no matter how much we
[12:58] try to go back and Rise one of them old
[13:01] dead denominations we'll never do it
[13:03] where did they find him where they left
[13:05] him amen
[13:08] hallelujah think I'm a holy Lord I guess
[13:10] I
[13:11] am you find him just like they did where
[13:15] they left him where they left him that's
[13:18] where they found him that's where the
[13:20] church will find him where did they
[13:22] leave him at the Pentecostal Feast what
[13:25] will the church find him back at the
[13:27] Pentecostal Feast what
[13:29] when they pulled away from the doctrine
[13:31] of the Apostles and so forth back in
[13:33] them early ages back there they pulled
[13:35] away from it and form their own Creeds
[13:37] and started a nickel and Doctrine form
[13:39] the Catholic Church organized a religion
[13:42] a what called the Christian religion and
[13:45] from there they've organized and broke
[13:46] down the things and brought all the
[13:48] Christians into Creeds and so forth and
[13:50] mixed it all up till it's just the same
[13:52] con glamor that he found when he come
[13:55] exactly back to the beginning where we
[13:58] left him
[13:59] when he was powerful when he raised the
[14:01] dead and heal the sick and cast out
[14:03] devil back to the beginning why are we
[14:06] Len they say where is he is he with the
[14:08] Methodist is he with the Baptist or even
[14:10] is he with the Pentecostal no sir go
[14:13] back to the not Pentecostal organization
[14:15] Pentecostal denominations that's the
[14:17] name that's right who can organize
[14:21] Pentecost tell me Pentecost is not an
[14:23] organization Pentecost is an experience
[14:26] to any believer I want
[14:29] back to the experience not back to an
[14:31] organization but back to an
[14:32] experience any cost is an experience let
[14:36] me tell you something you look the fruit
[14:38] the Pentecostal churches are bearing
[14:39] today you'll find out sayar started from
[14:41] the beginning aring busing stewing
[14:44] upside down pulling for this and pulling
[14:47] for that Jesus said in John 14 or John
[14:50] 15 I am the vine ye are the branches is
[14:55] that right now you Farmers you Texans
[14:59] louisian and what you may be here anyone
[15:01] that's got Common Sense ever seen a Vine
[15:03] grow know that the vine does not bear
[15:06] fruit the branches of the vine what
[15:09] bears fruit but it gets us life from The
[15:11] Vines Jesus is our resource of life amen
[15:15] yes sir now we'll notice then if Jesus
[15:19] is the resource of our Liv and he's the
[15:20] True Vine the very life that's in the
[15:23] vine is in the
[15:24] branch and if that vine puts forth a
[15:28] first branch and that branch is a bunch
[15:32] of grapes comes forth on it if it ever
[15:34] puts forth another Branch it will be a
[15:37] bunch of grapes amen it'll put forth
[15:40] another Branch it'll be a bunch of
[15:41] grapes and it'll be the same kind of
[15:45] branch on to the end of the
[15:48] vine oh God now
[15:52] hallelujah
[15:55] amen every time that vine touch forth a
[15:58] branch it'll be like the first Branch
[16:01] yes why because the life that's in the
[16:03] vine will put forth the same type of
[16:05] Branch yes if the first Vine bro grapes
[16:09] the next won't bring
[16:12] pumpkins the next won't bring citrus
[16:14] fruit amen and then after while on down
[16:17] I that it won't do it if the True Vine
[16:19] puts forth a branch and if Jesus is the
[16:22] branch in the first of the vine and the
[16:25] first branch that brought forth and WR
[16:27] the book of Acts after
[16:29] that right the Pentecostal Church the
[16:32] real Pentecostal church and it wrote a
[16:35] book of Acts with signs and wonders
[16:37] following the believer if that real true
[16:40] vine bring forth another true Branch
[16:42] they'll write a book of Acts behind it
[16:45] yes sir you're in Arizona not long ago I
[16:47] was looking at a tree in a man's yard a
[16:50] citrus tree it had nine different kinds
[16:52] of fruit on One Tree it was every one of
[16:56] them was a different fruit it was an
[16:57] orange tree tree to begin with but it
[16:59] had pomegranates it had it had lemons it
[17:02] had grapefruits all different kind of
[17:04] citus fruits why they were grasp it in
[17:07] there they were living off of the life
[17:10] of that tree but they could not bring
[17:12] nothing but what they want they couldn't
[17:15] bring oranges because they're grassed
[17:18] Vine but every time that tree brought
[17:20] forth a true Branch from itself it was
[17:22] an orange tree on oranges at board
[17:25] that's the way today we grassed
[17:27] Methodist B Presbyterian Vine into the
[17:30] True Vine and living off of the strength
[17:32] of it but it can't bear nothing but
[17:35] Creed and denomination but if that vine
[17:38] ever put forth another PR it'll be
[17:40] entered in nomination powered with the
[17:42] Holy Ghost just exactly like it was on
[17:44] the day of Pentecost back to the
[17:48] beginning amen I better
[17:50] quit
[17:53] amen that bur ever puts forth another
[17:57] branch

[18:01] beginning we grasp all kinds of church
[18:04] Creeds into it that's just Methodist
[18:06] Pentecostal Presbyterian Lutheran
[18:09] Baptist and the everyone bear Baptist
[18:11] fruit Methodist fruit Pentecostal fruit
[18:13] and everything else but when it comes
[18:15] back if that buyer brings forth a
[18:17] another true Branch it'll bear holy
