[1:59] everything you've done for us our Lord
[2:02] and our master Jesus we thank you for as
[2:04] many as have guided already we are
[2:06] trusting you father for those only away
[2:08] bring them in let not the enemy take
[2:10] advantage of them in any way and we
[2:13] prayed yellow
[2:13] Jesus come and be enthroned in our life
[2:17] this morning father once again we are
[2:19] going to look at Titan may you come and
[2:22] minister to us through this topic Lord
[2:25] speak to us in one way or the other
[2:27] we're just thinking we bless you that we
[2:30] can always count on you in Jesus name
[2:32] Amen
[2:35] praise God
[3:09] all right so just for everything
[3:19] let's take Malachi 3:10 again
[3:36] bring you all the tithes into the
[3:39] storehouse that there may be meat in my
[3:42] house and prove me now herewith say of
[3:45] the Lord of Hosts if I will not open you
[3:48] the windows of heaven and pour you out a
[3:51] blessing that there shall not be room
[3:54] enough to receive it
[3:55] praise be to God remember the prophet of
[3:59] God says does say the Lord feels not
[4:02] praise be to God if there is anything we
[4:06] can put our lives on as that saith the
[4:10] Lord because there is no way it would
[4:13] ever feel God would always bring his way
[4:16] to pass I don't care what happens the
[4:20] Word of God would never be defeated so
[4:24] last week we had a very interesting
[4:27] conversation here I loved every part of
[4:31] it and we are going to continue right
[4:35] from where we stopped last week but
[4:38] before then let me just take a step back
[4:43] when Jesus was tempted by the Pharisees
[4:47] about paying tribute which is tax money
[4:52] to Caesar they asked him whether it was
[4:55] lawful to pay tribute to Caesar and he
[5:00] asked them back why do you tempt me
[5:02] and he asked who has the tribute money
[5:05] and then one brought out a coin then he
[5:08] asked whose portrait or whose picture is
[5:11] on the tribute money and they said
[5:13] Caesar and he said give unto Caesar that
[5:17] which belongs to Caesar and unto God
[5:19] that which belongs to God so paying
[5:23] tribute money or pay entire taxes are
[5:27] lawful he didn't say it wasn't lawful
[5:32] they are a lawful duty that we have to
[5:35] do very good maybe considering how much
[5:41] they take is another topic we can talk
[5:44] about
[5:46] we can argue babies too much praise be
[5:50] to God so now the point we got to well
[5:57] you know we had brother-sister share you
[6:01] know I it was so wonderful I just loved
[6:04] it
[6:06] so and before we left I said that those
[6:12] who pay their tithes which is one tenth
[6:16] of their earnings from the our gross was
[6:21] right and again I said that those who
[6:25] pay 1/10 object eyes from their net were
[6:30] also right I know that would generate a
[6:33] stone under every circumstance praise
[6:38] the Lord
[6:39] yes so let's see I am NOT an authority
[6:43] on anything as a matter of fact I don't
[6:47] teach something because I know it I just
[6:51] have the bedding and then I just go out
[6:54] and I get to study I mean read a lot of
[6:57] things here and a so it's ok to disagree
[7:03] praise be to God
[7:05] I've always trusted in God and I believe
[7:07] he's always been very faithful so now
[7:12] before you take your salary or your
[7:17] earnings Uncle Sam would have taken his
[7:22] part already and then the part that
[7:26] comes to you is the net so let's assume
[7:31] that you are making $10,000 a month out
[7:37] of that $10,000 let's again assume that
[7:45] you are required or you were required to
[7:48] pay 90% no wait a minute you are
[7:54] required to pay hundred percent of your
[7:56] earnings to God are tights
[7:59] let's zoom it away that is not the case
[8:04] but let's just assume that God was
[8:09] requiring us to pay hundred percent of
[8:14] our Amos to him as tight so if I am
[8:19] making ten thousand dollars as gross
[8:24] what it means is that I have to pay
[8:28] homage to God ten thousand but look at
[8:34] this scenario that before the ten
[8:37] thousand gets to me Uncle Sam would have
[8:41] taken their taxes out and probably am i
[8:45] end of it maybe seven thousand now God
[8:54] was requiring me to pay a hundred
[8:55] percent and my gross is ten thousand
[9:02] dollars and I'm trusting to take this
[9:08] ten thousand dollars to God but the
[9:14] state federal government have taken
[9:18] their taxes out and I'm left with seven
[9:22] thousand dollars do you think that there
[9:26] was any way we could ever meet that
[9:29] obligation was there any way we could
[9:36] ever meet that obligation because part
[9:42] of your salary has been taken away and
[9:45] you can't you are left with seven
[9:47] thousand the seven thousand is now 70
[9:50] percent of your income 30 percent has
[9:57] been taken away
[10:01] so you'll be carrying what 70% to God I
[10:09] am not saying this to say that those who
[10:13] are paying 10% of your gross wrong not
[10:16] at all
[10:17] it is right it is the right thing to do
[10:19] if you are doing it keep doing it
[10:22] hold fast to it I am bringing a
[10:25] different dynamic to this so and I say
[10:33] again that those who pay 10% or beyond
[10:37] that are also right but I said last week
[10:39] that there is a caveat there is there is
[10:43] there is a condition so which brings us
[10:48] down to our net now because you can
[10:55] never get a hold of 100 percent of what
[10:58] you make they would have taken your 401k
[11:00] contribution they would have taken your
[11:03] Social Security contribution they would
[11:05] have taken our federal their taxes road
[11:07] rail whatever they take all that out and
[11:11] you are left with Savini so you
[11:13] calculate 10% based on the $7000 as your
[11:21] hundred percent income so you realize
[11:27] that the person who is paying 10 percent
[11:30] of your gross is paying more than you
[11:36] now at the end of the year if you
[11:44] opinion based on your net when you file
[11:49] your income tax and you get your income
[11:52] tax returns you are supposed to tie on
[11:56] the returns because that part of your
[12:01] income was not tied by the one who paid
[12:06] the undergrowth and not obligated to do
[12:10] so
[12:13] now you can also draw from your foreign
[12:20] key remember also that normally don't
[12:26] take your 401k deductions before they
[12:28] even tax so remember that that
[12:32] contribution did not attract tights so
[12:37] when you are making we draw us from your
[12:39] 401k you all got packs or amp you you
[12:43] all got paste on that money if you got
[12:54] to go on pension you are enjoying your
[12:58] 401k you are enjoying your Social
[13:01] Security remember that you never pay
[13:05] tight on that money you all got tight on
[13:12] that money this is why I said there is a
[13:22] condition or there is a caveat praise be
[13:26] to God so but it becomes wrong when you
[13:33] are tying on your net and then you fell
[13:40] for your income tax and then you pocket
[13:42] all the money you draw from your 401k
[13:47] you pocket all the money you are driving
[13:52] from your pension fund your social
[13:53] security fund you pocket all the money
[13:56] remember that you never paid tithes on
[13:59] that part of your earnings that was
[14:01] taken away so you all got that money if
[14:05] you do that you have stolen from God now
[14:09] having said that having said that let me
[14:13] just read this that no man can out give
[14:18] God when it comes to taiidan there is
[14:24] nothing like a half
[14:25] it too much money you can't give God too
[14:30] much praise be to God you can say oh
[14:34] I've given God more than necessary so
[14:38] what I want to say is that it is
[14:41] perfectly okay to pay your tithe from
[14:45] your gross and so paid money to God
[14:50] still peptides from your Social Security
[14:54] from your 401k from your hard luck
[14:57] quality tax refunds is perfectly okay
[15:01] are you obligated I don't think so but
[15:05] nothing stops you from doing it cheering
[15:10] oh God run of God are led by the Spirit
[15:13] of God I don't want us to come to a
[15:16] situation to say that oh is grieving in
[15:19] stone that when you do this
[15:22] no nothing stops you praise be to God
[15:29] now in the message I mean in questions
[15:36] and answers 1964 brother brother said I
[15:40] could stand here till the morning
[15:44] telling you just what happened
[15:47] when I seen that and what condition I
[15:51] was in I just
[15:53] but just as lawyer as I ever could
[15:57] I paid tithes and when I took my own
[16:01] money from the church here or from from
[16:04] campaigns I took more and give a tenth
[16:10] then I'd give it out to ministers and
[16:14] give the rest of it ministries then when
[16:19] I couldn't do that then that then I did
[16:23] I kept 10% and give God 90% praise be to
[16:30] God instead of him
[16:34] keeping the 90 and giving God 10 pirata
[16:38] captain
[16:39] he gave God Nene that's why I'm saying
[16:42] that when it comes to our work with God
[16:46] you can't say I have given too much to
[16:48] God so what I'm saying here this morning
[16:51] that it is okay to pay your tithe from
[16:55] your gross and still continue to pay
[16:57] tithe on money you have already tied on
[17:03] nothing stops you because praise be to
[17:08] God you can't out give God praise be to
[17:18] God
[17:22] now before I go to the next phase are
[17:29] there any questions yes okay okay
[17:48] all right okay all right that's right
[18:08] that's right
[18:14] the continued part beautiful beautiful
[18:18] so that's a very good very good point
[18:21] thing so remember you can never pay more
[18:27] than necessary if the prophet of God
[18:30] could pay 90% and just keep ten just
[18:33] think about it
[18:34] praise be to God thanks for the
[18:36] contribution yes okay that is nice now
[18:53] we can I will take you from both angles
[18:58] because whatever money you make it is
[19:04] not out of your own sweat is God giving
[19:09] you that money some of us go to school
[19:15] we get very good jobs we are making very
[19:20] good and it's very good income and we
[19:23] think is our education we think is our
[19:27] smartness we think is because we are
[19:30] doing Auto overtime so it's our strength
[19:33] now what I want to say when you look at
[19:36] it there are people that have more
[19:39] education than you and yet they are not
[19:43] blessed with a sort of income you are
[19:45] blessed with dollar side there are
[19:49] people who even make more money than you
[19:52] yes there are money is of no use to them
[19:56] but yours is there are people that are
[20:00] 10 times stronger than you
[20:02] that do a lot of overtime then you would
[20:05] ever imagine yet they are not blessed
[20:09] with the money you have so think about
[20:13] it any money you make don't think is
[20:18] your strength don't think issue
[20:20] education no is the blessings of God for
[20:26] you so is God giving you that money
[20:31] praise be to God so based on that our
[20:36] said God is giving you 90 percent but at
[20:40] the end of it all he doesn't just give
[20:43] it a 90 percent just guess what happens
[20:46] all the hundred percent comes to you and
[20:49] you are supposed to take ten percent of
[20:51] it and send it back to God and I wonder
[20:55] why sometimes it gets so so difficult
[20:58] it's just like me going to the
[21:00] supermarket buying a box of candy for my
[21:04] little boy and then I give it to him and
[21:07] I asked him just for maybe one or two
[21:09] and he says no you can't have it that is
[21:17] what we sometimes do yes so um this is
[21:23] the way I would answer it I don't know
[21:25] if that answers your question
[21:27] praise be to God yes
[22:29] amen amen
[22:31] yes that is something we'll be going
[22:36] into but since you brought it up let me
[22:41] just talk a little about it anytime you
[22:45] are supposed to give your tights out
[22:48] don't say next time because that tight
[22:53] you will never pay it you were not so is
[23:00] something I'll be going into so I
[23:03] wouldn't go into it very much at this
[23:05] point I remember sure let me just go
[23:11] ahead one time I was supposed to pay
[23:13] tithe and actually I took the money out
[23:17] and I kept it and I was double minded I
[23:25] don't want to go into the background of
[23:27] the story and I parked my truck came
[23:34] down I passed a car in front of me I was
[23:38] looking at at a car I entered my truck I
[23:40] started it and I just reversed into the
[23:43] car and right away I knew there isn't so
[23:51] the Sun didn't go down on that day
[23:53] I went I swallowed my pride and i went
[23:58] and give that tide out so there are a
[24:03] lot of things some of these things will
[24:05] be going into but your contribution I
[24:09] think brought this out yes
[24:31] that's a very good question
[24:51] that's a very good question very tricky
[24:58] hmm
[24:59] okay that's good thank you yes so when
[25:03] you get a gift should you tight I would
[25:08] say yes because library Joran just asked
[25:14] the money their anus we make is a gift
[25:17] from God it is and we tried out of it
[25:23] now there are some gifts you can tie it
[25:29] on let's say I am hungry and then you
[25:35] bring me a bowl of food and Pam soup I
[25:38] [Music]
[25:39] can't hide on that but if you give me
[25:45] hundred dollars sometimes we overlook a
[25:49] lot of things somebody gives you maybe
[25:52] $20 and look at it Oh title of two
[25:55] dollars I mean just forget it it's
[25:58] important it's very very important it
[26:03] may be very very small yes it is very
[26:06] insignificant right how do I give two
[26:09] dollars to God but do it it is not what
[26:14] you think or how you feel so if you give
[26:19] me hundred dollars it's a good thing to
[26:23] take one-tenth of it and give to God
[26:27] somebody can also give you a gift that
[26:31] is not in cash but in kind maybe you
[26:36] give me a car I don't have to pay ties
[26:40] on that car in my opinion I don't have
[26:43] to but then if I decide to sell that car
[26:50] that money I take from the sale of it
[26:55] has not become a gift or an any or
[26:57] everybody to me I all got tied from it
[27:03] and I have to pay so there is a very
[27:13] thin line but as I said a while ago
[27:20] children of God are led by the Spirit of
[27:23] God so if his cash take that out if it's
[27:31] a gift and kind depend on what it is if
[27:37] it's maybe ten bucks of corn you give me
[27:40] even though it's not in cash I'm taking
[27:42] one bag out and sending it we're
[27:44] supposed to be it is a bag I can divide
[27:49] that into ten it is a car how do I
[27:53] divide it maybe somebody will say okay
[27:56] let me wait and find a Blue Book value
[27:58] of the car and then pay a tenth of it to
[28:01] God I don't know I'm not very sure how
[28:09] that goes but then if I decide to sell
[28:13] that car then it's a different scenario
[28:15] altogether that becomes a revenue to me
[28:19] it has become an income to me I have to
[28:23] calculate one half of it and give it to
[28:26] God
[28:27] wonderful questions
[28:40] you
[28:54] okay okay yes I would not die on the
[29:04] loan because alone is not an income it
[29:10] is not a gift is something I am going to
[29:14] pay back probably with interest so I
[29:21] wouldn't type on loan
[29:25] now if I'm Gary scholarship serve the
[29:32] scholarships I don't think they even put
[29:34] money in your hand they just have to
[29:36] finance your education
[29:37] good that's right now if my parents are
[29:42] sending me money to go to school is that
[29:49] money meant to pay my fees to buy books
[29:53] are as money that is just meant after
[29:57] all these expenses have been taken care
[29:59] of is their money they are giving me
[30:01] just for my pocket that is something we
[30:04] have to also know yes so again there's a
[30:09] very very thin line but specifically
[30:13] dealing with loans is something you pay
[30:16] back so I wouldn't tie on loan
[30:19] very good now if it is a grant you don't
[30:24] pay back grunts right now again it
[30:32] depends on what you are using a grant
[30:34] for if actually you have to use it for
[30:37] your fees or you are buying books with
[30:39] it
[30:39] that is a different scenario but if you
[30:42] have your fees have been taken care of
[30:43] and the grant is coming to you as pocket
[30:46] money again I would think differently
[30:48] about it
[30:49] yes yeah I didn't see these questions
[30:55] coming yes
[31:26] as Vera to pay goes money first and be
[31:30] in that hole then then than to use the
[31:37] the money of God to get out of that hole
[31:39] because you're a teen you've gotten out
[31:41] of that hole they are going to sink
[31:43] deeper so my advice is that pay you're
[31:48] tight and order mortgage if you have to
[31:51] pay late fee go ahead and do it but make
[31:55] sure never use is against something we
[31:57] are going to talk about here never use
[31:59] the tight to cushion you up for your
[32:03] bills it's not a good way to go
[32:05] praise be to God our time is up
[32:07] wonderful time I'm beginning to enjoy
[32:11] this on disco god bless you saints
