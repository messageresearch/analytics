we would do is that we would have our our our sunday school tape going at nine o'clock so we we want to just play a full uh easter or sunrise message uh brother branham so we will start at nine o'clock and then have a little time of prayer before we start our regular service so regular service will start at the regular time but uh because we are not having an early sunrise service we will play a sunrise tape at nine o'clock so you are all welcome we keep reminding ourselves i have to do that all the time or as i forget praise the lord so uh friday that seven o'clock uh saturday we start at uh seven six six pm and then sunday morning so we we just want to thank the lord and and for all his goodness his love and mercy upon us this morning we want to we want to share something uh that we we uh mentioned before and i want to talk on the pleasure of the lord isaiah chapter 53 if we can turn to our bibles isaiah chapter 53 isaiah chapter 53 what i want us to do with this chapter this morning because i want us to read the entire chapter is the kind of a center key chapter of the entire bible so we will do a bit of responsive reading we're going back to the old method these days praise the lord amen i remember that as a child responsive reading so that read verse 1 and then you read verse 2 and and on and on because i want us to read the entire chapter so the reading goes wuha believe our report and to whom is the arm of the law reveal he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hate as it were our faces from him he was despised and we estimated but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the testament of our peace was upon him and with his tribes we are healed he was oppressed and was afflicted yet he opened at his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before the sheriff is doomed so he opened that his mouth and he made his grave with the wicked and waved the rich in his death because he have done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth he shall see all the travail of his sword and shall be satisfied by his knowledge i mean in roger 7 justified by his knowledge shall my righteous seven justify many for he shall bear their iniquity and shut the divided spoils with the strong because they pour out his sword unto death and have numbered him with the transgressor and he beared his sins of many and made a transfer praise the lord are we grateful that we can identify ourselves with every one of these verses praise the lord amen let's pray together heavenly father dear lord as we slowly go into this year easter a commemoration of your death burial and resurrection oh god we want to identify ourselves with each line each verse every word that is written in this chapter lord because father there is not one of us here that i spare from what you did on calvary and oh god we pray that this easter will be a different easter for us lord that you will give us a restoration in our heart the raising christ will be more real to us than ever before father we love you we appreciate you father in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed this morning reading from this chapter i was going to preach on the message the answer to the same question but i couldn't get away from this thought of the pleasure of the lord this as the scripture says the pleasure of the lord prosper in his hands praise the lord you think about it the pleasure of the lord prosper in his hands god has had pleasure in dealing with different people it's the pleasure of the lord for for you to be here this morning i believe that god god pleasure out of your singing this morning amen praise the lord are you glad to know that that he got pleasure out of your singing amen i believe so that he gets pleasure out of our worship if not he won't come down and inhabit our praise amen but the scripture speaks here of this man and says the pleasure of the lord we prosper in his hands glory be to god amen the pleasure of the lord will prosper in his hands now this word pleasure is uh it's a very wonderful word word and uh and it holds it holds a lot of a lot of truth it holds a wholesome mystery let me see that way it holds a secret it holds god's secret concerning you and myself amen let's look at uh uh revelation chapter four let's look at revelation chapter four maybe we can we can give ourselves a jump stat here a kickoff here to be able to understand where we want to go how we want to travel this uh this morning praise the lord now in the setting of revelation chapter 4 john has just got out of the the church ages not completely out but he have heard a voice that have caught called him up higher amen for him to come up higher so uh uh but as as we will look down here this is this is a scripture that is very familiar with us and that is the last scripture the last verse sorry thou are worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou have created all things and for thy pleasure they are and where created thou have created all things and for your pleasure so that word holds a mystery it holds a secret that god make you for his and when something is for your pleasure you do with it as you please amen you do with it as you please but here is the 10 year isaiah said that this man jehovah 7 he will be the man word the pleasure of the lord will prosper in his hands praise the lord which means he will be a man dead from the dead of his birth the way he was born and how he was born and where he was born and all of the things that surrounding his birth to uh to the day he would hang on the cross where he would give his sword as an offering every aspect of his life will be to god's pleasure i believe you and myself we are made for the pleasure of the lord but not every aspect of our life is actually his pleasure i believe that we now seek more of our pleasure than his pleasure amen we love to come to church on sunday and you know sing and praise the lord have him to get a little bit of a pleasure out of us and monday we have our own program our own routine and our own things to do we want to make sure that we get it done and then if there is some few left hours that we retire we get on our knees to pray then and you know and just give him a little bit of a time but this man jehovah seven this man the pleasure of the lord will prosper in his hands glory be to god amen the pleasure of the lord will prosper in his hands now so having having a little background that uh that we have we have just shared with you and we have looked at i want us to also look at some few things before we really get into looking at our subject i'm going to turn the wheels over to you amen praise the lord i'm going to turn the wheels over to you so you can drive the service the way you want you want us to go praise the lord let me just get my bearing put my seatbelt on i think i need to put a helmet last time i got a headache out of here so praise the lord amen now if you look at the word pleasure in this meaning it actually comes from a word it is they actually come out of the word please the word pleasure comes from out of the word place whatever you are having pleasure and you are pleased with it okay so the word pleasure comes out of the word place but you know uh uh scarlett's kind of for respected uh uh isaiah in his style of writing there was something i wanted to to mention i wanted to mention from the message that was playing this morning uh yeah i think i took it if if there is any way that i will our beloved sign uh sound tech can be able to put paragraph 36 from the message that was playing this morning paragraph 36 i think so i was listening to that and something caught my eye i wanted to share that with you and uh if they can be able to get it and try it out for us and we can we can talk about that and then we can go on our way i'm sure that was in paragraph 36 if i do remember i said to myself i was going to copy it in and give it to them but i forgot until i mentioned scalas so if you if you look in isaiah chapter 53 let's be talking while they look of that isaiah chapter 53 you get down to verse 10 where actually uh isaiah talks about the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hands if you look at the beginning uh if you look at the beginning of uh of how he started that verse yet it pleased the lord okay i think uh uh the uh sound people are there the different ones figure out and they have uh i was reading that and uh 20th century okay let's go down a little bit now what the what i want to refer to in this in this paragraph and in sequence of paragraph down you will see that in that paragraph brother branham is is is describing how he was studying for for 70 weeks and then he goes down and then he mentioned different books that he was looking into and he mentioned lickings and and it's strange enough that people are saying that brother branham copied from lickings he uh pressurized that's that's what he accused him of the brother brandon pressurized lakins when he taught on the on the seals and taught on the church ages so when i heard that on the tip this morning i says what i think i need to teach my church a little bit that you will not get confused with those things praise the lord you go in brother branham library in in in tucson i have not been there but uh i i i've seen the you know a video of his books that he have you know brother branham has a lot of books on his shelf and brother branham and brother mentioned that brother branham also had brother leikin's book which of course i bought a copy of that book i had it on my shelf a brother came in and asked me for it and then i bought another one and uh you see so the thing about it did is that uh uh he was a man of very poor education we know his background and we're not justifying that for any reason amen if you're having the opportunity to go to school go to school praise the lord his father was a drunken could not afford to send all his children to school so brother branham had to leave because he was the first boy first born so he had to leave and start going to hunting to support the family because the father was drunk and gambling and going in you know and by the way of his life so he had to step up at a young age but he was a man that availed himself in studying in reading he reads whatever he comes his way praise the lord many people think that everything brother brandon preach god give him a vision about it it's it's it's not right that's not true brother branham steady he steady because paul said steady to show yourself approved so he was reading things he was gathering information but you see you just don't follow the the commentators and things that people have up there because everybody is sharing their life and idea when he first preached the church ages the single copy the first time he preached in 1950s he preached it from what he gathered from the seven day advantage book so when he was when he was planning to to to preach and teach on the set on the seventh week of daniel the church ages and even the seals he was studying he was looking at materials but the holy ghost will always help him when that information was not right so he was not just bringing men's knowledge to us but he was bringing an inspiration of the almighty praise the lord and this man these men this man that wrote this books they were not just people that were writing because they wanted money no they were men that god gave insight now there is something that you have to understand about the church ages the sixth church age is called the man's age which is the philadelphia church age and you will realize that that was the age the age that is called the open door that was the age where uh uh christianity i would say put out his best writers you talk about uh uh uh uh john wesley you talked about uh uh the prince of preachers uh uh charles poggin you talked about uh all of those men they were blessed because that was their age it was the man's age so god anointed men with wisdom they had insights to look into the scriptures look into signs look into different things and bring us an understanding now the seventh church age messenger was going to take the loose ends of all of those truths all of those truths and bring it back together that's why brother branham says the seven seals was not going to be something out of the bible it was not going to be a flying information but i just wanted to tell you that you know brother brown was accused of pressurizing and then this is not the only place that he said it he was he'll tell you over and over i was looking into lincoln's book i was looking into his coffee box and and a lot of places you know what he says i have i was just reading the commentary and i love what what the commentator says praise the lord strange sometimes when people see you reading some material you think that you're trying to know better than the prophet no as a preacher you have to be informed you have to be informed what was i preaching praise the lord okay so i just wanted to bring that information to you so you can go and do your own research on it you'll find a lot of places that very brandon make comment on different men you know different men and i love them i've sought out those things for years now so uh you know and so those things uh those accusations don't hold water you know they don't hold they can't hold it they praise the lord amen because if he were pressurizing he would not mention that i have been reading pressurizing is to take somebody's information and don't make mention of their name but if you tell somebody that i've been reading the book that this sister right or this brother wrote then how can you say i'm pressurizing okay let's get back to to business club be to god amen let's get back to business it's time for business i love business amen glory be to god amen amen so as i have said yet in isaiah chapter 53 verse 10 yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he used the word a please he pleased the lord to produce him amen he have put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seat prolong his days and then the pleasure of the lord that was going to be the climax the climax so you think about it now if we were made for his pleasure if he made us for his pleasure in his mind that he will have a people that will be for his pleasure god had to provide he got he had to to to give a provision he had to make a provision that will not partially redeem us back you have to make a provision that will completely redeem us back because we were made for his pleasure so if there is something that came and took us away from his pleasure he had to provide something enough that is going to completely bring us back to his pleasure praise the lord amen yeah you can have all the time you want to have for yourself here when you get there there is no time for you hey amen you can have all the time go and shopping go and browse go and you know and when you get there it's going to be just all the time for him [Laughter] praise the lord amen glory be to god what a wonderful jesus we serve praise the lord amen so it please the lord he pleased the lord a couple of years back i was listening to a radio programming and uh and it was it was around easter and someone was referring to this and says uh you know it was that this this kind of a scripture is so is so uh it's so not right i mean there's a better way to place it because i mean you just please the lord to bruise him it looks like god was so pleased it sounds like a child abuse praise the lord i said in my heart as i was driving i said what a shame i said what a shame that christianity has come to if we only know the price that was paid it couldn't have been nothing less than what god was pleased with nothing will satisfy him then what he was pleased with so god make us so we can please him that's what we are made for so we can please him and you see it in the scripture you look at job in his trials god and sit on how to talk what job is having his his life you know enjoying his farm his cuddles and making sacrifices and it please god to say there is no man like job god was so pleased to say there is no man have you have you considered my seventh job god was so pleased to take him through that it pleased the lord to burn his farm down and please the lord now all his children gets killed praise the lord amen and god was so pleased that that man that lived a righteous life would break all over his body in bombs he couldn't understand what what have i done where did i miss the my whether that went wrong but it was not about him it was about a god that takes pleasure in the things that he allows in our lives god take pleasure in the things if he watched over you nine months in the war and he watched over you from birth until you get to that age where he says now i'm going to have pleasure with this child there's nothing you can do about it because you were made for his pleasure the reason why we cry in trials is because it's not our pleasure trial is never our pleasure praise the lord amen i always say that you find people when they are testifying after they have gone through their trial i trusted the lord i believed god i was holding on even though it was difficult i was holding on as if to say they were doing it complaining frowning go why me why me why me praise the lord let me tell you during my trials you couldn't go through it praise the lord amen glory be to god amen moses grew up was born the proper child the bible says grew up in the house of pharaoh in the palace he was a prince praise the lord he got to the age of 40 years old and then he pleased the lord that moses should forsake everything in egypt go back to the back side of the desert it pleased the lord that he will go away from being having sevens and people bringing his meal and people watching his clothes to go with one rob on his back because he did not have time to pack a bag to leave egypt he ran so he went with only one suit praise the lord that was when he knew how how bad he smelled because before then he never know what sweat was but yet it pleased the lord because god wanted a deliverer so it placed god that he should be stripped of everything you think the thing that brings pleasure to god is how you feel your feelings don't bring pleasure to god praise the lord how you feel oh i don't feel that this is right it don't bring pleasure to god god don't care about it because our sense of feeling is connected to the fall praise the lord that's the reason why the thing that can make you to feel good may not make me to feel good the pleasure of the lord prospered in his hands but you see with uh with job and with moses and with david this little boy just like every little boy trying to be uh you know a seven trying to be nicer you know teenager he likes to throw his slingshot and and and you know go down on the mountains jumping on his legs and you know kicking rocks and everything in and yeri says samuel comes and anoint him to be prophet now from that from that young age now he was now to god's pleasure because he was anointed to be king he was now to god's pleasure so god had to rob him of all his pleasure so from a very young age he started becoming responsible got down there and saw the whole camp empty and everybody quiet and said what's going wrong down here and then goliath comes out and said who is that on second size philistine when even his older brother the kings and everybody hiding himself but this young man because he was now to god's pleasure he had to rise up to that responsibility that's what happens when you are to god's pleasure age does not count because we have some young people that are very responsible then some 40 50 and 60 years old that is tying hater on their heads and muscle arm and getting naked in the street it's because as a young age god has pulled you for his pleasure he said i'm going to have a bride i'm going to have a people in laodicea and just like mary you have found favor with god you better treasure it you better treasure it and stop complaining praise the lord and we know all of the things that went more uh david killed goliath and before so long he was brought saw promise that the man that killed goliath i'm going to give him my daughter so david were not even planning a wedding he was not planning a wedding he was not even ready all that was in his hair was to take care of those sheep but now he was to god's pleasure he have killed goliath they have to face a wedding date praise the lord they had to face a wedding there they had to pull him down from from the backside of the desert he got to be there and saw a house plane happened to cast out evil spirit from saul and saw throwing the javelin at him now he asking himself what is this is it is it what happened when you are in the king house when i was on the back side of the desert oh the lions and the bear they were afraid of me is it my time to be afraid of somebody but when god is having his pleasure in your life where he leaves me and i will follow what he feeds me and i will swallow amen embrace own devil how to be on the run and all of those men david moses job we know the story about joseph and we can go from one character to another character in the bible but all of those men god had a level of pleasure in their life for things that he wanted to do things that were not so that to their choosing joseph his brothers have to sell him and the only reason is because god wanted him to go and be in egypt before the family would come that was the only reason they were so mean to their brother god wanted him to be there to be in position before the farming will come upon the earth so he will be able to preserve god's seed for a promise that was made are we together by all of those men there was now one word god's pleasure prospered like this man jehovah 7 that we are talking about let's read another scripture here i'm i'm just i'm just getting started i hope you had a good breakfast this morning if i stay long and you get hungry just just wait your lunch might be on me praise the lord amen maybe i might have to carry the whole church out this afternoon we just have to find a place that can hold us all and there is nowhere can hold us all then i bailed myself out [Applause] i'm a good businessman you know are we together praise the lord let's look at isaiah chapter 40 and see something here that is so beautiful in the scripture i'm not started preaching here though i'm just only laying the foundation for what i want to say maybe preaching my night take me long if i can do a good job in laying my foundation isaiah chapter 44 god is speaking here to the prophet isaiah of a king a gentile king before he was born cyrus the king let's look at verse 28. the bible says that set of of observers i mean i wanted to move back a little bit but i'm trying not to do too much of a reading you can just mark that down read just go back a little bit you get the picture that's sarah cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou sh thou shall be built into the temple that foundation shall be laid again now this god is speaking about cyrus years before he was born now you have to realize that jeremiah i mean uh isaiah brought his prophecy before jeremiah okay and jeremiah prophecy that was when israel went into captivity to babylon and nebuchadnezzar has to come and and and belchers that took after nebuchadnezzar because nebuchadnezzar took after his father and and uh uh and then after that before the means and persian when when the handwriting came on the wall that was the very same night where the maze and persian took over babylon praise the lord and when the mission persian took over babylon the first king was darus so you look at that span of time but yet isaiah is talking about cyrus the king that was going to do god's pleasure which of course it was on cyrus the king that the temple was built or that he sent men back to start considering the building of the temple are we together but you see yara said years before he was eating bone god is speaking about him and saying i'm going to have a gentile king he don't know the 10 commandments he's not a hebrew but he's going to be to my pleasure i will have him in my hand he's going to be my shepherd he will going to be to my pleasure and the thing that we have him to do is the building of the temple praise the lord i was thinking about that the other day the handwriting comes from the wall amen the first thing there is that when nebuchadnezzar had his his his dream and he told he couldn't even talk about a dream because he couldn't even remember it he just said i had a dream that troubled me by night if anyone can remind me of my dream and give me the interpretation thereof and if none of you guys can do i will cut your head off because i'm so troubled by what i saw praise the lord because true dreams goes to your subconscious praise the lord amen it goes through your subconscious it affects your subconscious that's why when you have a dream and and and and it troubles you it means that uh you know it's it's almost like it it's almost like you are living after you were dead it was almost like you left your body you went to life and then you came back to your body so you feel that thing you feel that impact that heaviness praise the lord so daniel tells him the interpretation daniel tells him you know what the image and down there is not even a friend you think about it think about it now that i taught about this this uh a little bit here because i was i was i was doing some things on dreams and and and even even look at the uh uh joseph he gives an interpretation to the bakla the cup bearer and says that you know the pharaoh is going to have have you out of here the next man gave him a dream he says three days you're going to be hank you see if you have the word of the lord if it's the truth inspiration you don't care about the consequence your duty is to give the word daniel gives the dream and said nebuchadnezzar this is what you're dreaming this is but this is the meaning of faith the head of god is your kingdom after your kingdom there is another kingdom that will take place now he's not afraid that if i tell nebuchadnezzar his kingdom will come to an end he will put me in prison put me in prison or don't put me in the prison is the word of the lord i'm going to say anyhow handwriting comes on the wall and and and and and and uh belcher's shazam his knee knocked together and and and i mean he's he's just drunk drowning and dania comes and reads the handwriting on the wall and you know what daniel tells him he says your days is done you are done as i'm talking to you right now the chairs of the meetings have been come about the city you see that's the word of the lord when a man has the word of the lord you are not afraid of the faces of the people you tell them just as the lord gave it to you praise the lord amen so we see here that cyrus was prophesied that god would have something in his life do you realize that was the reason why darus the king pulled daniel to himself that was when daniel went to the lion's den children you remember your bible story the reason why is because when they came and captured babylon they told him there was a man that just prophesied that you were coming so darus wanted to see this man who knew that i was going to take over the city that was the thing that makes him to fear dania because if god could reveal to him down here years and years now after the babylonian kingdom we come the maze and the persian there is something about this man so he pulled down here as a friend and one that he goes to for advices praise the lord and then it got all his men jealous about dania you know the rest of the story and applauded to kill him glory be to god glory be to god water awesome god we serve what a wonderful god we serve if god could determine the pleasure that he would have in sarah's life before he was born then you think about yourself this morning god has already determined where he's going to be so pleased with you he's going to be so pleased with you it's not what you can calculate in your mind it's not how you can just bring yourself together i have to behave and you i may not know he has already determined sometimes it's not from your attendance in church sometimes it's the little trials he puts in your life praise the lord sometimes says some things that he want to get from you you and him struggling he tried to deliver you you put it back a little bit you say lord i give it to you you take it back again praise the lord amen what a wonderful jesus yourself he's an awesome god he told jeremiah before you were conceived in your mother warm i knew you praise the lord jeremiah was one of those young men that the pleasure of the lord prospered in his life from a young age god told him from a young age he never had to play soccer or football or basketball with his friends from a young age she was just so burdened and burned in the heart of the lord and the first time he was on fire he just think that when he go and tell the people they will repent when he go and tell the people they get angry at him he gets frustrated oh my god what is this he said i don't want to do this again i tried to lay for you i try to be a witness he said lord i can do this again he said but yet your word burned in my heart your word i feel it like a fire it burned in my heart i can't stop it i don't know what to do praise the lord that's why you feel sometimes when you want to give up amen since i'm just tired with this christian life then you go back again and say oh god i'm sorry the world burns because the pleasure of the lord is determined upon your life but all of these men as we talk about them will realize that there is not one that uh the pleasure of god prosper in his life or her life because we can talk about sarah a young woman that got married happy to be married praise the lord that's the first thing they get happy to get married the next thing they look for they are looking forward is happy to have a child and then there is no child she had to go 25 years the house was so dry there was no baby so she said hey guy we need some baby cry in this house after i follow abraham all these years he can't bring her okay he got had the baby the baby is crying sarah is trying to be to be nice to the baby and hagar is giving her eyes and attitude like young women does praise the lord but it was the pleasure of god upon serious life it was the pleasure of god upon rebecca's life it was the pleasure of god upon a richest life it was the pleasure of god all of these women through the bible can you even think about eve the first girl you know what what fathers love their girl child because god loves eve but it was the pleasure of god i'm coming to that in the meaning here it was a pleasure of god that she would be the channel through which the attributes of god because there is no way that god could make his attributes of being the redeemer or being a savior or being a healer if there was no sin and as much as it was heartbroken to god but yet it please the father oh i pray that we will go through this easter with a different concept and say lord be it unto me i call into your word whatever pleases you let it happen to me just give me grace to bait praise the lord because that's all you need praise the lord are we together amen amen what a wonderful jesus yourself praise the lord i love the lord amen i know just like i said if i have you quiet like this i know that i'm driving right between there i know that i'm driving home with this world amen a quiet acquired congregation don't bother me inspire me to preach because i know i'm drilling right at the right place let's just read a couple years god's gift always find this place and now we find out his deity and brought him frank incent was a type that he was a seven of jehovah jesus is jehovah seven sit down to think about something that he can do to help others praise the lord many of those men will have a reward a man that came up with the polio vasin and and the different vaccine and all of that praise the lord but right right in there is god jehovah seven now we find our deity his deity and they brought him frank incense which was a type that he was a seven of jehovah jesus is jehovah seven in matthew chapter 12 we find out that he was jehovah seven behold my seventh in whom i am well pleased praise the lord that is the great mystery that is around the godhead that is the great mystery paul said for great is the mystery of godliness great is the mystery of godliness that's what he said in the book of timing amen great is the mystery of godliness for he preached unto the gentiles paul was saying god preached unto the gentiles how did he do it through christ jesus symbolized it in his in his last action with the disciples by watching their feet it was it was all he did was just to show them this is what all of this is about is selving one another watching one another feet not even in their head the nice part their feet the dirty part praise the lord i hope our next communion we can do foot watching we tried to esteem from it with all of these uh coronavirus uh restriction but i'm sure with a max on your face you can do foot watching praise the lord amen i put my strength upon him so his life was anointed with frank in sin to jehovah's service what a gift identified jesus as jehovah seven he's talking about the three gifts that were brought by the wise man the frank incense was used to anoint him for service because he was jehovah seven behold my seven in whom i uphold praise the lord so the purpose was for god's pleasure to prosper in his hands are we together let's take some few scriptures here having some few things to cover up here now i want to go a little bit faster amen are you ready let's look at first chronicle chapter 29 17. first chronicle chapter 29 17 we just we just want to uh use that and uh edified ourselves a little bit praise the lord first chronicle chapter 29 verse 17 praise the lord verse 17 reads here i know also my god that thou tried the heart and have pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of my heart i have willingly offered all these things and now i have seen with joy thy people god have pleasure in uprightness ezra chapter 10 verse 11. i'm making a little trap here to bring you into let me tell you before we get there but let's just read this scripture 10 11 now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your father and do his pleasure what is his pleasure separate yourself from the people of the land and from your strange wives this was the restoration of the temple when ezra and nehemiah's has come back and bringing the people back amen he's saying confess your sin and do his pleasure what is his pleasure separate yourself from the things that you have got to involved in amen as much as god loves you to be in church and he loves you to sing his praise it does not amount unto his pleasure if you are indulging in things contrary to his word so you're only pleasing your religious desire but you're not allowing the lord to have pleasure in you we have more scriptures to to to kind of uh go over here and then on and on and on let me let me just let me just go on and on like that praise the lord amen praise the lord so we see here we see that uh uh you know uh this is uh it's uh it's it's a redemption word he was we were made for his pleasure paul said that inefficient also you know the counsel of his will the pleasure of his will you know and all of that i mean that's that's what we are here that's what god sent sen sent out a message to to pull us out to redeem us as his people so his pleasure can prosper in our lives whatever he has laid out for us but you see over the years you know uh you see all of these men and women through the scripture in a way that god was able to have pleasure in their life was to carry them contrary to their plan i don't believe that it was sarah plan to go without a child for 25 years god had to take them on another route that was completely contrary to their plan and to many of them it was like suffering so you see over the years the the the christian faith have somehow associated suffering to god's will and in that way sometimes we plague ourselves wrongly oh yeah when the catholic church was doing penance that people have to crawl on their knees and crawl down on breaking bottles just because of the wrong that they have done it was never god's will it was never god's will now you see the thing that brings pleasure to god is not what you playing it's not what you desire is what he plans that you don't know nothing about you have your plan going on here and he drive you into this path you say no that's not where i want to go i'm going down there while my life is going this way no it's that place that i want to go but over the years people has brought self-affection to themselves some has become lazy to work that they think that poverty makes you closer to god you are just lazy to work find a job praise the lord because i mean they are not even improving their life they say is the word of god but yeah they say they are they are complaining i'm suffering and it's the word of god and why are you complaining it's just a misrepresentation of faith a misrepresentation of truth looking at old testament characters suffering it was not their will it was not their choice that they know how to play themselves that way are we together let me read this to you by faith moses i wouldn't say to people that they should choose to be afflicted because sometimes we make those choices when we can do a better thing when we can choose to smile sometimes we choose not to smile because we think that when we smile i mean we are we uh we uh uh i mean we're becoming sinful praise the lord amen i heard my wife giving it loud amen because sometimes she thinks i don't smile but i always tell her that it's because i'm ugly if you see my face like that it's just because i'm ugly it don't mean that i'm angry if i try to be serious i get so ugly praise the lord god have mercy deliver me lord i wouldn't say that that people should choose to be afflicted i don't say that you should choose suffering it will not be the himal thing to do because no human want to suffer it would not be the human thing to do because no human want to suffer but if suffering lays in the path of duty then let's take it as it comes i don't want you to do something for somebody to make fun of you in that way we have misrepresented the gospel yes sir if we think that being sloppy is simplicity you have misrepresented the gospel praise the lord and if you think being flashy is prosperity you have misrepresented the gospel we must not be sloppy we must not be flashy we must be decent are we together i don't want you to do something for somebody to make fun of you i wouldn't want you to say different things and you hear people saying this this message is not for everybody this message is hot the message is not high it's not high it's all the legalistic thing we have put in our mind and the regulation that we have built this is the liberty of jesus christ it's the liberty of jesus christ why you think that you will have grace to receive this message and you think that somebody else will not have grace the message is hard this message here is high it's not for everybody it's because you are inside i don't want you to say something to make yourself different to people you make yourself a fanatic and pretty soon people look at your belief to be a cottage belief they don't want to associate you because you just make yourself so strange happy easter anyway i wouldn't want you to say something different i belong to a church that doesn't believe in such and such in this word praise the lord [Music] and the things like that just to get people to make fun of you you're trying to create persecution for yourself praise the lord i was thinking about going to uh romania for for easter meeting i'm still supposed to talk to brother gabriel there and see uh uh if we if we can if we can come over so uh uh since you've been so quiet on me and i can leave you for now praise the lord we just have to kind of figure out the things there i mean last i think two years ago that i was invited but i've didn't plan to go the good thing there is that there is to come after hours so uh yeah so uh so don't think i'm i'm running away from you anyway amen it's just that you're being so quiet on me this morning i wouldn't say for you to get out here and carry on and do something that was radical i wouldn't want you to do that so that somebody will say that you are a fanatic now if if it's just if it just comes out because the person think that i mean uh you're not unanimously saying maybe you're not dressing uh uh sexy you're not exposing your body okay say oh that one she's old school well we can understand that praise the lord you bring that to yourself but if it lays in the path of duty towards god let the world say what they want to say you just live on live on your christian life praise the lord you're not trying to make anybody angry you're not trying to impress anybody you just want the pleasure of the lord to prosper in your life praise the lord are we together now the first time that this word pleasure was used in the bible it was actually concerning our father abraham we were talking about a friend of god on wednesday night abraham the friend of god that's in genesis chapter 18 praise the lord okay so i see that the time is the time is now amen the time is now so it is not bad for me to say that i will soon be closing you just hang on a little bit amen hang on and hold tight genesis chapter 18 god came to visit abraham when he came to visit abraham concerning the promise that he had given to abraham that they have they have kept him you know walk with god for 25 years god come down and he's talking to abraham let's take verse 12 right here and and and and sarah verse 11 now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in the age and it sees to be with sarah after the manner of women she have stepped into the cycle of life praise the lord a cycle where life begins they have ceased to be with sarah after the man of women and to menopause let's see that way therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i'm walks oh shall i have pleasure my lord being old also now we see that she says this lord be to god amen and uh in a lot of this word she uses the word pleasure now most of the time as i was telling on this i realized that uh it is it's going to be very interesting so just pay attention to media let me close this bible i think i can find a way to to stop here or find a place where we can be able to to to close up here for the evening or for the morning afternoon whatever time it is now but sarah says the bible says she has stepped into the time of life a time where life begins uh sister rebecca smith brandon smith wrote a very nice piece on that uh listen to it the last time audio portion of it and and i just thought it was beautiful so i kind of stole it uh we maybe we might play one of these days uh uh and enjoy it together but you will realize that uh sarah's were making an expression the bible says she live in her heart and she says i'm i'm worth stricken in age i'm old shall i have pleasure and uh uh and and abraham my husband is also old it's amazing that she says that because it opened the channel here word we can see there now because we know that this is somehow attached to redemption but we can see that and i was thinking about it i was saying in my mind uh you know like the bible says men were inspired of all to write the scriptures you know the inspiration of god and i believe it was no mistake that they used that word they could have used another word but that actually opened china for us to understand something very important very very very important and that's what we want to get into because as sarah uses this word i'm all shall i have pleasure it's so easy for our mindset to run onto sexual affairs praise the lord and as i stated on the word it was in the 1600s that the word pleasure was associated with sexual affairs praise the lord so this will open something up here for us and it's is it's very beautiful very very beautiful because it's one of the things that is plaguing our age i wanted to say young people but everybody in this age is plagued by that because it's a spirit that is just all over the place plaguing the minds of young old the only people that are not plagued is the ones that are addicted with it because they are already addicted they are drunk in it marriage homes is a plaque we feed a marriage home is plagued with faith that's the spirit of the age but it's going to bring us to a very important place because apostle wide and as i was studying i asked myself i says i need to go down this trail lord i think i feel in my heart that you you kind of for taking me down here and i was grateful that i followed the leadership of the lord because i learned amen i said because when when you see his death the first thing the enemy comes and and whispers to the minds of the people and if god does not help them he starts to plague their mind he starts to drift them off of the word of god he starts to carry their minds into some ugly and nasty places then i asked myself by the way what is sex many times we fail to realize that sometimes when you are filling an application they ask you what's your sex praise the lord because sex is not an act sex is a personality it's not an act praise the lord go to your dictionary and define it it tells you now with all of the the the gender issue that we are having and all of that people are beginning to rewrite and redefine words but if you study the word in its origin praise the lord this is how the bible defines sex psalm chapter 139 verse 14. if our lovely people can put it up for us i would love us to read it together amen glory be to god david said and let's read it together our praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous other works and that my soul know it right well that's your identity that's your identity the the the the the way that the biological way that god made you that make you unique as a woman and make the man unique as a man that's what sex is but that word was abused from the beginning because when the serpent came to eve he said do you know that god knows that the day you eat of this fruit you will become god what was he doing he was robbing them of their identity and introducing an act he was robbing them of their identity and introducing an act genesis chapter three let's draw back there a little bit glory be to god man i'm getting in my element i'm just beginning to preach praise the lord hey amen amen i can feed the pool somebody is calling me somebody that's pulling me i can feed it glory be to god amen are we together okay that's that would be over in verse 4 of genesis chapter 3. and the second said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god does know that the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open the eyes will not close and ye shall be as gods they were already gods because they were made in the image of god god can only give birth to god but what he was doing is that he was robbing them it's just like a young young man trying to tell the young woman you are pretty it's not because you say it you must tell him i know it's not because you say it i know that i am ready [Applause] because when he sees that what he's trying to do is that he's trying to rob you of what you thought of yourself and now you will take on the image that he's given to you and all that is in his mind is just to abuse you praise the lord so that's our sex you never go fill an application and ask you while you're sex and you start talking dirty on the paper you always say i'm male or i'm female that's what you are praise the lord amen and verse six reveal that eve fell for dead thinking that taking the devil lie she would become a god when she was already a god she had dominion she was on she was she was co-equal with adam if adam could speak she could speak also because god has empowered them to have dominion over the earth praise the lord why can't people see it that's the very thing that the devil did in the beginning rob them of their true identity and he introduced an art and he's doing the same thing plaguing the word with that praise the lord if you appreciate your truth identity you can have the greatest pleasure in the world because it's just by appreciating who you are you don't have to get down to some debted things to do before you think you have you have you having pleasure what happiness it haunts you with guilt it condemns you praise the lord are we together it's almost one teddy i won't want to keep you any longer i'm already aware of my time here but let me treat something also before we close this chapter bert branham said in marriage and divorce he says this i kind of forgot some of the words because i just wanted to get to the point so if you want to read the entirety you go and find a quote and read it she is designed alone for he's talking about the unique the uniqueness of the woman which of course he described that no other female is like that praise the lord the uniqueness of our mothers of our wives of our sister invisible union he says to no other female that god gave three sacred virtues virgins say woman hold a motherhood to no other when god gave it to a woman it was a sacred trust because the promise of redemption was hid behind that she will become the mother of all living if she can keep that trust she can give life to a house that is dead glory be to god i feel like this was kind of a misplaced in some ways that i've honest to or some ways i've heard it in in a way that i think some people believe over the years because most people taught that when brother branham taught marriage and divorce and some of the things that he said took the woman out of the original creation that's not a true teaching that's not a true teaching he was talking about manifesting because genesis 1 says he make man male and female in his image that is the original creation but when he was bringing that to manifestation expressing it to flesh he hate the woman in the man because it was all the plan of redemption praise the lord a woman is designed alone i would just read this and go ahead and and you others you can you can go home and study it a little bit a dog can no other female can it's just the woman that can a dog or no other female once a year and that's for her babies and that's for sexual pleasure now so most people think when brother branham says this it means that the woman is lesser than an animal because the animal is designed to to go that way because of her youngies but he says the woman is not that it does not means that she's lesser it means that there is there is something that is hidden in her life because you have to remember she's a type of the church and god don't want to have pleasure with you one time in a year or one time in a week or one time in a month god wants to have pleasure with his redeemed people whenever he wants us so god built a woman in a way that she's not like an animal the prophet god would tell us that this is this was not god's original way for his sons and daughters to come it was not his original plan but he allowed it because he wanted to make his attributes manifested but you see because of the perverseness of our mind our mind so filled with perverseness and filthiness that sometimes it's hard for us to see through the pages praise the lord and just like i said you know i've have i've heard it you know i've heard i never believe it because i think i understood what the prophet of god says here because it's playing out he says for the woman it's different the way she's made it is not for church for childbearing the way that god made her she's different it is not for childbearing because she's she's holding in her life you see and and the devil exploits that amen he has plugged that that's the reason why i mean all i mean all the the the violence we have in the world and all the horrible things that that happen i don't want to carry you down that road but i i want you to be able to grab this why because that was what sarah was referring to that's what she was referring to it almost looks like you know what uh uh uh you know i'm old remember now it's not an art it's your personality praise the lord it's your personality so no matter what is the age of the person you have you have all the people 90 years old they don't they don't go into what young people feel their minds with but they just have pleasure to know this woman has stayed by my side all of these years it's just a pleasure to come and see her at home it's a pleasure to eat breakfast with her praise the lord but the devil right from the beginning he plagued eve mind with an art and robbed her of her personality sex is your personality and you must protect it don't rob yourself of your true personality just for the few meaning pleasure or a few minutes out praise the lord well i don't know what you want me to preach amen do you want me to come and preach do not smoke do not drink amen is that why you want me to preach do not commit fornication don't you know that do not commit adultery don't you know that have you not been reading your bible because sometimes people say the pastor must hammer on that you better give me the heavy hammer then the pastor should hammer on that no the church should go past that we must go past that and get into this thing and understand ourselves understand the things that we must do do i be teaching preaching on how you should cut your head how long your trouser must be your dress you're scared is that why i should be preaching well like that old evangelist said they say all this week you've been preaching on repentance he said let the church repent first praise the lord amen amen if you think i'm preaching things that is up there reach out and grab it when you get ahold of it you will never want to come back to these little things you want to be for me to be preaching come to church you have to be in church you're supposed to know that by this time we're talking about a rapture yeah yeah he described a peculiar design of the woman a peculiar design and all of that is tied around redemption the lord outside of meetings what i've heard friends preachers preach and they use these things and become so insulted to god's people so insulted to god's daughter because they just think that brother branham was kinda and filthy in his mind like they are in their mind you say a dog or any animal once a year and that's for their babies not for sexual pleasure he sees but for their babies the old hog the old the old sword hog an old dog once a year one woman that's for babies but a woman is designed for any time she desire why because that's the reason why genesis chapter 3 he says your desire shall be to your husband and he shall have the rule over you now what happened there is that because she's built that way for redemption she's built that way that's the way god built her now brother brown goes on he says i've got some stuff crossed out here you can imagine the rest i hope the holy spirit revealed to you the rest that i cross out here praise the lord amen now so as as a christian as a believer what i'm trying to bring you to the place is there for you to know the difference between the art and your personality praise the lord and your personality who you are the unique design that god placed in your life praise the lord that is the reason why now you see that i was going to i was really going to go down this this way that's that's what i spoke a little bit on friendship on wednesday night just to be able to uh create some protection for myself and now so you will see that that's the reason why when that that relationship of friendship was very important for redemption it's very important for redemption amen what the brother branham said fellowship was is his two fellow in one shape praise the lord and that's what friendship is praise the lord so if the two fellow that is in the same shape are having good friendship they can have the pleasure of their life whether they sit on a tree they can talk and just laugh let out the stress they can just laugh they can just i mean because they're just so much friendship they reject so much understanding whether they choose to go on a cruise or to choose to just walk down the trail they can have so much pleasure he says there are people that you just love to be around he said because of the atmosphere they create you have pleasure with their presence pleasure is not an art young people don't make nobody make you to make it put it in your mind that is an art it is the unique character that you bring to the family all the children are not the same there's a unique character that's why we must not make all the children the same we must be able to appreciate their different characteristics and bring it to the table and enjoy the family banquet the unique character that god has given you for you to be in the family the unique character that god has given you for you to be a husband to the wife or a wife to your husband the unique character that god has given you why did he give you that so you can have pleasure sometimes i listen to the kids playing and they would just laugh i just said that i just laughed there's just some unique feelings that just come true you just say oh my goodness you just like what are they laughing for you don't know but they're just a unique laugh you know those people that have they have the kind of laughter that affect people you don't even know what they're laughing about but it's just a unique sense you just start laughing i know a brother good friend of mine joe we were on a convention and uh we were having lunch i brought alfred davidson house and and just from fellowship joe started laughing he's the kind of a person like that i mean he had the whole house laughing nobody know what joe
