So, we want to thank the Lord to be here this morning. Uh the Lord has been so good to us and it's good to see happiness in people's face you know and we have to be happy to be in the house of the Lord you know you know we should not be like the weather outside is cold and we get cold you know and we have to be constant at all time. How many of us are happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you love the Lord can you give him a hand please? Amen. praise. Amen. As you are still standing, I would invite you to open the word with me. We'll open our Bible in the book of Ezekiel. Thank you so much, Sister Naomi. Uh I bring greetings from brother one. I had spoken to him. He asked me to greet the the church and we trust that uh this morning the Lord will visit us in a special way. &gt;&gt; How many of us are under expectation? &gt;&gt; How many of us are under expectation? &gt;&gt; As I always say, if you expect the men to speak, the men will speak. &gt;&gt; But if you expect God to speak to you, &gt;&gt; God will speak to you. &gt;&gt; Because most of the time, we we humans. There's no ability that we have. Uh but we trust that God has placed a gift in our life that he can use it. He can use it. So we have to be available and it's not easy to be available. It's really not it's not easy. But I trust that the Lord will bless us. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 22:30. We will continue the very thoughts that we spoke on Wednesday and uh maybe by the grace of God I will take another angle and we trust that it will be of a blessing to you. Ezekiel 22:30 the Bible says if you there you can say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And I sought for a man among them that should make an edge and stand in a gap before me for the land, and I should not destroy it, but I found none." Verse 31. 31. Therefore, if I pour out my indenation upon them, and I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath, their own way, if I recompense upon the head, sayeth the Lord, God is willing, is looking for a man. He's looking for a woman that will stand in the gap for a brother or a sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or for somebody else that does not even know God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And unfortunately, it says here that God has found none. I pray that this morning that God would touch somebody's heart &gt;&gt; that he can be that person that will stand in the gut for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Now, first Peter chapter 22 verse 9, 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 9. The Bible says, "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should show forth the praises of him that had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 1 verse 4 and I'll have you seated. John to the seven church which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come from the seven spirits which are before his throne. and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us. Now I want you to pay attention. And washed us from our sin in his own blood. Verse six. and has made us king and priest. Unto God and his father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have any needs? You can show it with your uplifted hand as we pray. Gracious heavenly father, this is your time. Father, &gt;&gt; any scholar can go to school and read this portion of the scripture and bring their own interpretation. But when it comes to a divine interpretation, it only comes from you, &gt;&gt; Lord. You know, I'm just a man, &gt;&gt; Father, but I'm putting myself available so that you can use this vessel. I am sinful as the rest of the brothers there saved by your grace. But Lord, I just pray may you take the portion of this scripture. May you bless it. May you break the bread of life because men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes forth father your mouth. Lord feed your people. These are not my people Lord God. They are yours, Father, and only you can minister to them the way you have intended them to receive it, Lord. Father, take away tiredness out of our midst, oh God. Oh God, we condemn the enemy out of this place in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. May you have the preeminence and the control over this meeting from the from the beginning to the end. Be the alpha, be the omega. Lord God, I pray you know the needs behind every heads. Lord, your children are so burdened. Oh father, I may not know it. Oh God, Father, Lord, if it's even possible for you to turn this sermon into something different, oh God, but I'm putting myself available, oh God, may you answer their need, oh God. Whatever problem they may have, oh God, may you touch them in a special way. We want to remember your servant, our pastor that is far. Oh God, may you please keep him, Father. May you protect him, oh father, Lord Jesus. It will be good to see him again in our midst, oh God. Father, Lord, those that are sick, may you heal, Father. Those that are weak in faith, may you strengthen them. Those that have doubt, oh God, may you comfort them. Drop a message of encouragement that will lift them higher, oh God, in the faith that will actually know that they're not alone. Oh father, that you are there with them, oh father, minister to your people, Lord, as we are on expectation to receive something from you. In Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen. Thank you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once again, are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh we trust that uh this little message will be of a blessing to you. Uh last Wednesday, how many of us enjoyed the service on Wednesday? Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray that it was a blessing to you and with the intention to encourage you. And as we'll be speaking tonight or maybe this afternoon, not yet this morning, you would realize that everything might be very quiet and uh there is a reason why I want it to be quiet because it is really important. I don't want anybody to miss it. You know like Wednesday it was very quiet but I trust that these things are very very important you know and I spoke about who can stand in the gap because God is needing somebody to stand in the gap in needing somebody with his spirit in him can be able to do the same work that Jesus did on earth &gt;&gt; and as we spoke and I think this message has been really a burden in my heart because we cannot serve God the right way if we're not standing on the gap for somebody else &gt;&gt; you You know there are many people of God that are going through different things. They they are struggling with different things and sometime they feel they feel lonely you know but it it would be good to see a brother or a sister to stay a little bit on their knees praying you know for you. Can you just imagine somebody comes to you and say, "I've been praying for you last night." &gt;&gt; You know, how many of us have experienced such things, you know, it feels good to have somebody praying for you, &gt;&gt; you know, and and and even this is an example, you know, as a child, you fall away from your parents, you know, and as Elijah, you know, you can feel sometime you're going through something, you you can feel that somebody's praying for you. That feels good. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; But my message this morning is just to let you know that God wants you to do that for somebody else. &gt;&gt; God wants you to stand in the gut for somebody else. &gt;&gt; There are many people who may not even had gotten close to have the revelation that you have received. Maybe the message that you have received, it's a blessing for you. You enjoying it. You're saying amen to the word, but there is somebody out there that probably needs it, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost that you have, there's somebody out there that needs that same Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Maybe they want to be delivered from alcohol, but they don't know how to do it. You have been delivered. Why don't you just tell them as well? Says, "Come look at what God has done in my life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and and if God can give us the grace to have that revelation to do it this morning, and I think it will be of a blessing. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Amen. So now God is seeking for somebody and I'll just have a recap a little bit on what we have spoken on Wednesday you know and we we read uh in the book of Psalms it says therefore Psalms chapter 106 verse 23 it says therefore he said that he would destroy them has not Moses is chosen one his chosen stood before him in the bridge we spoke how the children of Israel has sinned against God and Moses was the one that stand in the bridge that stood in the bridge for the children of Israel. You know he says God if if you want to punish them you have to take my name out of thy book. &gt;&gt; You know God cannot take the name out of the book out of his book the name of an elect you know because you are part of God. &gt;&gt; God cannot take you out of his economy. &gt;&gt; You know he will leave the 99 and seek that one. &gt;&gt; You see that you know and and I just want to keep with you to keep this in mind. Israel was a chosen nation of God. God had chosen them, but he had so much patience and and mercy upon them. You know, they will complain at all time, but God will still reach down and and help them. They will ask for water, God will give them water. You know, they'll ask for food, God will provide food for them. But Moses was the man. He was the prophet of God that God has sent for that generation. And he was the one standing in the midst. When God was about to to exterminate them, Moses stood. He says, you know, father, no, don't do that. &gt;&gt; What the other nation going to say? &gt;&gt; God needs people like that. &gt;&gt; And the prophet would say, it was not just Moses himself. It was the spirit of Christ in Moses. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of God in Moses that actually stood up in the gap for the people. &gt;&gt; You see, you see how much we need the spirit of God. You cannot stand in the gap unless you have the spirit of God to do so. &gt;&gt; So as I'm speaking this morning to you, maybe you say, I don't see the importance of praying for somebody else. But it's because you have not received that spirit yet. &gt;&gt; When that spirit comes into your heart, it put it places you to action. &gt;&gt; You stop praying for somebody else to stop crying for somebody else. &gt;&gt; It's only the spirit of God that will do that. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? It was the spirit of Christ in Moses &gt;&gt; that has done that. And we have read the quote here. Brother Benham says here in standing in the gap, he says, "Today, if God was going to liquidate the people, there was a time that when God had gotten tired of the foolish &gt;&gt; with our sin, we're constantly going wrong and it would stand like, you know, who would stand like Moses today?" This is the prophet of God standing in the gap. Remember he had called you know the the people that had rejected the message Rickas and Ricada &gt;&gt; and the prophet came and told him and said you should not call them this. These are still my people. &gt;&gt; But now he find himself in that position that he has to stand in the gut for the very people that have rejected his message. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? But now the question brother Venom is coming to ask the question who can stand who would stand or could stand. God would accept like he did Moses. The prophet of God was also chosen. He was elected of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But at this moment he had a job to do. He had to stand in the gut for some people and continue to preach the me the message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you imagine the prophet says, "I'm tired of these people that have rejected my message, and I'm going to walk away." &gt;&gt; God told him, "If you do that, your wife will leave you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, he had to stay there. His job was to stand in the gut for somebody else and preach the gospel. So, if he had gone and rejected it, we wouldn't even be here. &gt;&gt; There was a message that he was it was a a commission to bring to the people. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we can continue. And Moses own life on earth meant so much to God till he stayed the wrath of God. &gt;&gt; And God would not cross over Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God could not cross Moses. He could not even kill Moses. &gt;&gt; This is the power of a of a chosen son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you are not just somebody out there. You you are chosen. elected before the foundation on the of the world for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of us can actually stand and pray and say, "God, you cannot cross me. &gt;&gt; You can't stand in the gap for your children. &gt;&gt; You can't stand in the gap for your wife. &gt;&gt; You can't stand in the gap for your husband &gt;&gt; that God would actually honor such prayer &gt;&gt; and not cross you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you see that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now standing in the gap, he says, "There was a scripture that always puzzle me. How Moses could tell God a better idea than God had till I find out that it was the spirit of Christ in Moses." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of God in Moses. &gt;&gt; God said, Moses, separate yourself from them. I will destroy the whole things and start with you. He said, Lord, he threw himself in the bridge and said, &gt;&gt; take me. &gt;&gt; Blood out my name &gt;&gt; of these very people that had rebelled and his heart wait for them. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine somebody that is assaulting you, &gt;&gt; that is criticizing you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you're still standing on the gun for that person. Amen. &gt;&gt; It cannot be you as a human. We have ability. We have a you know sometime we have feelings. &gt;&gt; But if somebody has done something wrong, you still stand in a g for them. It's not your spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not the spirit of men in you. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of God in you can do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; You see church, &gt;&gt; when when we are coming to church, this is what we are looking for. &gt;&gt; The spirit of Christ in people. &gt;&gt; Yes. that as a husband, your wife will hurt you so much &gt;&gt; that you will still pray for her. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, even if you can rebuke her, you rebuke her with the intention of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're not just condemning somebody. No, you're rebuking them with the intention to redeem them back. &gt;&gt; And only God can redeem. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if the spirit of God is in you means that you have also the redemption power in you. &gt;&gt; You can redeem somebody else. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; And we spoke about Jesus Christ. When Adam race has gone wrong, there is only one that could stand. The the first Timothy says, "For there is none. There is there is one God." Sorry. And one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what a mediator means? Somebody that goes between God and people &gt;&gt; to restore relationship &gt;&gt; to restore fellowship &gt;&gt; to to restore harmony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's what Adam and Eve had lost in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; But only one man was able to do it. Only Jesus Christ was able to redeem men back to that fellowship. &gt;&gt; If you are able to sin and ask for forgiveness is because of the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's because one man stood for the God for you. &gt;&gt; Because otherwise all of us will be dead. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; But there was something that I noticed as as I was just studying on this subject. Every time the judgment is about to strike people, God always sought for a man. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I I find that it was very interesting. God always sought for someone that would escape judgment or stand in the gut for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Just before judgment, God will actually steer the heart of someone. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Adam and Eve failed in the Garden of Eden, &gt;&gt; judgment was about to strike them, right? &gt;&gt; But God set an example himself. &gt;&gt; He took a lamb, he killed the lamb. &gt;&gt; So the blood was the only requirement &gt;&gt; that could stand between a a sinful man and God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God came down. If you read Genesis chapter 3 verse 21, and Adam also and his wife did the Lord make a coat of skin and clothe them. &gt;&gt; Just before judgment, God comes down and kill an animal. &gt;&gt; And the blood of that animal had to stand between, right? &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Let's look at Noah. This was just before the anteliving destruction. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; God, the Bible says, "But Noah found grace in what? In the eyes of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Watch this. If Noah was not found, even his children would die. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Can you catch that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, somebody had to stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to preach that very gospel to his own family. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So the message of Noah save him, his family, his children, and his son, his daughter-in-law. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Abraham. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Before I go further with Abraham, let me slow down here. Genesis chapter 12, God called Abraham. I want you to see how God is redeeming men back throughout the church ages. I want you to see that in the life of Abraham for a second here. Genesis chapter 12, God called Abraham out of Babylon. Do you see that? Genesis chapter 15, because to come out is justification by faith. That's the message of Luther. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? He called him out, chose him. That's the message of Luther. Justification by faith. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Then Genesis chapter 15, God confirmed the covenant with Abraham by the blood. sanctification by the blood. We spoke about on Wednesday, how he had exposed the the the pigeon and all of it. You see that? We spoke about on Wednesday. Genesis chapter 17, God came and revealed himself as Elshadai, the breasted one, the two breast, the old and the new testament. That's Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; That's in the morning. But in the evening, Genesis chapter 18, He Elohim in human flesh &gt;&gt; discerning the thought of Sarah behind the tent. &gt;&gt; That was the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Can you catch that? &gt;&gt; But now is revealing himself to Abraham. &gt;&gt; But yet judgment is about to strike uh uh Sodom. &gt;&gt; But between the visit and the judgment, &gt;&gt; Abraham is standing in the gap for who? For lot. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you catch that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now God, Elohim and and and Abraham, they start having a conversation. Abraham is saying, "Perventure, if there's 20, would you destroy?" He says, "No, I'm not. It stopped going down." But God Elohim is knowing the thought of Abraham. &gt;&gt; That cannot be Abraham himself. Abraham could see his nephew dying, &gt;&gt; but he stood in the gut for his nephew. What happened? Two angel came there &gt;&gt; to Sodom. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The world was in the sodomite condition expecting judgment. &gt;&gt; Here is the abimeic seed &gt;&gt; on earth interceding for the family members. So you see the the seed of Abraham in you, &gt;&gt; you would intercede for your brother. &gt;&gt; You see, so many people say, "Wow, I'm I'm the seed of Abraham." But the seed of Abraham is not just to claim it. &gt;&gt; It's a life. &gt;&gt; He blessed you to work to intercede for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Let's let's go back to that table again. Let's look at Oh wow. I I surrender all. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, let's look at Rahab. This was just before the judgment of Jericho, the fall of Jericho. Do you see that? Now Rahab, Rahab is interceding for her family members. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? and that ye save alive my father, my brother, my brethren, my sisters, and all that I have and deliver our life from death. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; she stood in the gap. &gt;&gt; She requested for a true token. We'll speak about in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; Just before judgment, people have to be anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the spirit of intercession. &gt;&gt; Saint, we are sitting in the sodomite condition. &gt;&gt; True. Soon enough here judgment will strike the earth. But where are people to stand in the gap? &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; We have family members that are not saved yet. &gt;&gt; They don't even know who William Breham is. &gt;&gt; Our children, they don't even know who William Brham is. &gt;&gt; How are we expecting them to know to enjoy this message if they don't know what God has sent to them? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Because there is a blessing that is attached to receiving a prophet. In the name of a prophet, &gt;&gt; you receive the reward of a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So for them to enjoy said even to read your Bible, you must know the order to read the Bible to know how is it what relationship is between you and the author. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have an encounter with Jesus Christ, you would want to fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rahab stood in a gap. Let's go to Jeremiah chapter 51. Now, this is a powerful scripture I want you to catch. Run ye to and fro from the streets. Oh my. Of Jerusalem. Okay, that's fine. I'll read it from here. run ye to and fro through the street of Jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad place thereof. If ye can find a man, if any be that excuse judgment, &gt;&gt; that seeketh the truth and I will what? &gt;&gt; Pardon it. &gt;&gt; This is just before the Babylonian captivity. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah is sent as a prophet to warn the people. people the people he has became so dull of the truth they willingly rejected the truth you see when you're getting used to the word you can't hear it &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; it does not hurt it does not I mean does not mean anything &gt;&gt; because people have to reach that place for struct judgment to reach to strike the earth &gt;&gt; because god cannot send judgment without warning people first &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that's why he sent prophets, he sent the word, he sent a provided way to escape that judgment. &gt;&gt; But since people has reached to a place where it the word of God has nothing to do with them, they will just reject it and say, "Oh yeah, I know what that scripture says. &gt;&gt; I know what that quote says." &gt;&gt; They can't even quote it to you before you say it. &gt;&gt; Because this is not the first time. &gt;&gt; This there's nothing new under the sun. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is just not the spirit. People die, but the spirit will not die. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So sometime we are just influenced by a spirit we don't even know it &gt;&gt; but there was somebody else &gt;&gt; who had shown that same spirit &gt;&gt; you know Jezebel in the Bible the spirit of Jezebel was there in the book of uh chronicles if I'm not mistaken right or kings but the book of revelation speaks of Jezebel's spirit &gt;&gt; that this woman called Jezebel died a long time ago but her spirit was still going on in the Bible. So saints don't worry if you have a spirit when you die somebody else will will pick up that spirit. &gt;&gt; Sometime we say oh wow that's no we carry spirits and we are under the influence of a certain spirit. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The people have refused to repent. &gt;&gt; Their heart was not there toward God. They had no desire for God. That's why when the angel is passing by, God is seeking for a man. Can you imagine to a nation that God had chosen? &gt;&gt; The people have reached a place where there's not even one that could stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; Say, are you catching this? &gt;&gt; Are you catching this just for a minute here? &gt;&gt; How many of us are standing in the gap for a brother or a sister every day? But we have reached a point where we can only see wrong in our neighbors. &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say there can be wrong too because for the matter of fact, Lot was wrong. He chose the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; You know, he chose the wrong thing. But that did not stop Abraham to intercede for him. &gt;&gt; That's right. There you go. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And we speaking our subject is the ministry of intercession. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but as the part two I'm sorry I didn't mention it is Christ interceding spirit in this end time bride. &gt;&gt; Christ interceding spirit in this end time bride. &gt;&gt; If God Jesus Christ had to intercede for us, the spirit of God in you would do the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that going to produce something different? It must be the same. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's why we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's why we need God in our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we need to mean business with God at all time. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter 3:9. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering to us word, not willing. &gt;&gt; Not willing any should perish that all should come to repentance. &gt;&gt; This is God. This is God's mercy and grace. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Fortunately, we're not repenting. We're not making our life right. But let me tell you something. Only the elect. Only the elect will see the importance of repentance. &gt;&gt; It's not everybody that can repent from the heart. &gt;&gt; It's only that seed that can repent. When they're wrong, they're willing to fix it. &gt;&gt; No excuse. Fix it. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. That's not really what I meant. No, no, no. Fix it. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother, I wrong you. &gt;&gt; Please forgive me. This is what I have done wrong. &gt;&gt; And then this is what I'm repenting about. &gt;&gt; Not a different version. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; oh no, that's not what I meant to say. No, no, no, no, no. Repent because you have done wrong. &gt;&gt; Because repentance means to turn around. &gt;&gt; So if I was going from south to the north, &gt;&gt; if I repent means I'm going to the north back to the south. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't need to use another road around &gt;&gt; is that same wrong I done wrong going this way I need to go back and fix it &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; this morning if it gets quiet it's okay &gt;&gt; it's okay because what is more important is our soul &gt;&gt; I can preach you guys a go a message everybody jumps after that we'll forget about it &gt;&gt; but after we leave here we can say oh god Please, I'm the one that is guilty. &gt;&gt; I need help. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we come to church because this church is the judgment seat of God. &gt;&gt; I don't want to have a problem at the river. I &gt;&gt; I must be deal with things here. &gt;&gt; So, I want somebody that will tell me the truth that I won't miss it that day. And I don't want anybody to miss it. &gt;&gt; I want everybody to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, that's why I need to meet mean business this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not hungry for anybody. It's just the love of God in my heart for anybody else that need help too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that you can seek that lost soul too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; The word of separation as they posting that first quote there. Who will all men be saved to come to the knowledge of the truth? God has a desire for people to come to know the truth &gt;&gt; because this the truth that set you know set free you know it will set you free &gt;&gt; but if you don't have the truth it's kind of hard to be free now the prophet continues he says here the word of separation paragraph 12 he says now I want you to know this went up a mixed multitude and that caused trouble among them as they got up but God in his foreign mercy not willing that any should perish perish, but all might come to repentance. Always makes the preparation a preparation of a way of escape for those who desire to come, but the way of escape. &gt;&gt; God has a provided way to escape judgment. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's not going to be fair. &gt;&gt; You see, if you are ignorant, you say, "God, I didn't know any better." Right? &gt;&gt; Do you see that? Why would you judge somebody who never even knew the truth? &gt;&gt; But since you have received a great message such as &gt;&gt; means that judgment is right at the at your back, &gt;&gt; somebody got to tell you that. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; The more knowledge you you know the more knowledge you know about something &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; you are &gt;&gt; it comes with a responsibility. &gt;&gt; It's better you don't even know anything. But once you know it, &gt;&gt; you have a responsibility. &gt;&gt; And every single one of us this morning have a responsibility. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; God has a provided way. It says he did it in the undelivering world. He did it in the days of calling out Noah or Moses rather calling out Israel. He did it in the day of the Lord. that the Lord Jesus is doing it yet today just before judgment are to strike the world. God is calling out a people &gt;&gt; those who are willing to walk and to take God preparation &gt;&gt; how to escape the wrath that is coming upon the earth &gt;&gt; and I trust that none that is in divine presence this morning &gt;&gt; or will be or will ever have to stay here to suffer through the great wrath of God &gt;&gt; that's not to come on the earth &gt;&gt; brother Benham when he was 14 years old He went to hell. &gt;&gt; He says, "I would not even want my worst enemy to be there." &gt;&gt; Said sometime when when we think about hell, it sounds like, "Oh, wow. I mean, I'm going to go to heaven." We we not imagining it. May God open our eyes to see how it will look like. Now if you read the Bible in the book of Exodus, what God wanted to do with Israel in the natural, he also wanted to do it with the same for the spiritual Israel, which is you here this morning. what he had shown through the Bible in the natural, he is fulfilling it here before us. &gt;&gt; Because what was done in the Old Testament was just a shadow. &gt;&gt; But God is fulfilling everything that was written throughout the entire Bible right here in our midst. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Israel was chosen of God among many nation. &gt;&gt; You are chosen among a lot of people. That's the natural, right? &gt;&gt; Because they were the Ethiopian and what what not. Israel were not better than the rest of them. &gt;&gt; But God chose them. Remember, Israel had mistakes, too. &gt;&gt; They were like they actually got into idol worshiper, too. For a matter of fact, Abraham came out of that. &gt;&gt; You see, God can choose you. It doesn't matter how down in wherever you might be found. God's mercy can reach anywhere in the surface of the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; You know when Jesus died, he went to hell to preach to the soul that did not repent. &gt;&gt; He went down there to preach. &gt;&gt; So saint, it doesn't matter how far you are from God. &gt;&gt; There is still mercy and there is still blood available for you and I. &gt;&gt; But once the blood is still available, a preacher should tell you the truth. I don't want to wait till the blood is no longer the altar for me to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; So if I'm called, I must tell people to go back to fix things before the blood runs out &gt;&gt; so if there is a blood available this morning if I would want anybody to come in right away &gt;&gt; before judgment. &gt;&gt; But somebody got to stand in the gap. &gt;&gt; Somebody if you have that spirit then you have also a responsibility. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have not gotten there, ask for God's grace to reach. I'm not there yet. I need God's grace, too. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Most of the time, people think a preacher is the perfect guy up there. No, we need grace, too. &gt;&gt; He came to me as a revelation &gt;&gt; to stand in the gap &gt;&gt; to awaken you. But you have also a job to do. &gt;&gt; We are all servant of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has chosen the spiritual Israel the same way &gt;&gt; out of the mud of sin out of whatever you can call it idol worship. Can you imagine in every family, you know, people are getting into different things. You know, African, they know what I'm talking about. They're into different things, but God has chosen you. &gt;&gt; In the midst of that mess, God is coming and say, "No, I want you. I want that one. That one. That's the one that I want over there." &gt;&gt; He comes and he picks that sister over there. He picks one. &gt;&gt; And and this brother here, just pick one. God is choosing &gt;&gt; because he knew you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Your name was in the book written sign already saved &gt;&gt; pardon. &gt;&gt; On this earth you are struggling &gt;&gt; but on this book it's written pardon &gt;&gt; because he knows that when you come to the knowledge of the truth you will make your life right &gt;&gt; you will come to realization of the pardon &gt;&gt; because God knows the end before the beginning. So if it's already written, pardon here, you're still running on on the opposite direction. &gt;&gt; But when you meet God, &gt;&gt; it stop bringing you back. &gt;&gt; And then when you see, you come to the realization of that pardon, &gt;&gt; that quickens you &gt;&gt; that changes your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You were not saved at the altar when you came that day. &gt;&gt; You were saved before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You came to realization. That's why you came to the altar. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God knows the end before the beginning. &gt;&gt; He knew that that day you will come to the altar. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I don't know what will happen at the end of the service. &gt;&gt; God know that somebody will come to the altar tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or this afternoon. &gt;&gt; I don't know. God in his mercy. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; He is worthy. Can we give him hands? Oh, glory to God. Exodus chapter 19. And I want you to see God's intention here. God wants, now I'm getting into my subject here. And I want you to catch something from the scripture we just read. It says he had made us kings and priests. Do you see that? Right. &gt;&gt; And he has washed us with his own blood. I want you to catch that. &gt;&gt; The blood and him making us king and priest. I want you to catch that idea throughout because I don't want you to lose. At the same time, keep in mind with the purpose to intercede. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; With the intent to intercede. Now God is showing his intention to the children of Israel. It says, "Now therefore, if you you will obey my voice indeed and keep my commandment, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me all the people above all the people. For all the earth is mine, &gt;&gt; and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, &gt;&gt; and a holy nation. These are the word which thou has speaking unto the children, what? Of Israel. &gt;&gt; God is showing his intention. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; He says, "This is what I want you guys to become. &gt;&gt; Not just the Levite, &gt;&gt; not just the priests. I want all Israel as a nation &gt;&gt; to be priests. &gt;&gt; But there's a condition there. It says if you obey. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But does it mean in my own ability to obey? &gt;&gt; Does it mean that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; We're about to find out here for a minute. &gt;&gt; This is God intention again in Isaiah 61:6. But ye shall be called the prince of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Men shall call you the ministers of God. &gt;&gt; Ye shall eat the riches of the Gentile. &gt;&gt; And in the glory shall ye boost yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's intentions. What is clear? They're very clear. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? They're clear. I want all of you guys to be priests. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you guys to be kings. Genesis 19, Exodus 19, sorry, 8. And all the people answered, said, "All that the Lord has spoken, we will do." Moses returned the words of the Lord of the people unto the Lord. Brother one preach about this. &gt;&gt; It says this was the fatal mistake that Israel has made. They thought they would do it by themsel to obey God's word. [Music] &gt;&gt; There was now a possibility for Israel to keep the word. &gt;&gt; God had already have a way to escape. Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; You can't do it by yourself. &gt;&gt; You just come God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just come God's provided way. He will take care of everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he's saying obey, yield yourself to what he had provided. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints, we cannot keep the god God's commandment by our own self. &gt;&gt; From Adam until before the death of Jesus Christ, no man was able to stand until the perfect sacrifice came. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Even after rejecting the provided way is death. You can try all your best, you will still fall &gt;&gt; and you will fail. There's only one mediator. &gt;&gt; There's only one. &gt;&gt; There's not two. &gt;&gt; There's not your ability. There's only one. He has to come through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If it's not Christ means hell. The only way for you to escape hell is through is through Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let me read the quote. Jesus keep all his appointment and just Israel. Little did Israel know that when they were shouting the victory on the bank of the banks of of the river, they were they were only about four four days journey &gt;&gt; about 40 miles. They were just close to that promised land. It's approximately is the distance from here to Mano. Approximately they were that close. But they didn't know what was waiting for them in front of them. Oh my. Away from the promised land. They didn't realize they were 40 years. It takes them It took them 40 years for a distance of 40 miles. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Just just think about these things. I want to slow down so we catch this. Are we together? &gt;&gt; But what was it? Grace had provided them a prophet. &gt;&gt; You see, now what you can do is God's provision. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my goodness. I pray somebody will catch this. &gt;&gt; It says God had provided them a prophet, &gt;&gt; a pillar of fire. We spoke about the angel of the covenant &gt;&gt; that was leading them in the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire was leading them in the way. &gt;&gt; That was God provided way. &gt;&gt; Do we have a prophet in the land? Yes. &gt;&gt; Do we have the pillar of fire? Yes. The the pill of fire is still there. &gt;&gt; It's still here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Leading the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A sacrificed lamb. &gt;&gt; The lamb was available. The prophet was there. The pill of fire was leading them. What the prophet says again? A deliverance. &gt;&gt; Deliverance. It says, "And still they wanted what a law." They wanted something that they could have something to do in it into. &gt;&gt; They wanted to put their hands on it. &gt;&gt; What was the most rush mistake they ever made in Exodus what 19? When Israel rejected what? Grace and accepted what? Law. Every time that you say I will try to do it by myself, &gt;&gt; I don't know what your situation is. &gt;&gt; Every time that you trying to solve your situ situation by yourself, &gt;&gt; you choosing the law instead of grace. &gt;&gt; God has provided a way to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To read the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the prophet to know look what I should do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that pillar of fire is still leading the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The same angel of the covenant is in our midst leading the church. &gt;&gt; The prophet is gone &gt;&gt; physically like this, &gt;&gt; but the spirit of God is still on earth. &gt;&gt; Because that's the ministry of the bride. She would have a ministry. &gt;&gt; She would prophesy again. &gt;&gt; True. She will not say something contrary to what the messenger has said. She will repeat what the messenger said. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; Brother says the spirit, the bride, the prophet will say the same thing. &gt;&gt; So it means that the prophet had prophesied. You have a job to do to prophesy as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not prophesying something different than the word. &gt;&gt; You're prophesying the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. You sing what the messenger have said. That's why brother says say what the tip says. &gt;&gt; That's a federal mistake. &gt;&gt; Now when Israel made that federal mistake God intended he had priests. He had chosen Aaron and his sons. We're getting into that now. I want you to catch this before we start going faster here. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now God, Exodus chapter 28 verse one, God speaks to Moses. He says, "Take that unto thee Aaron thy brother and thy son with him from among the children of Israel, he may minister unto me in the priest office." Do you see that? Even Aaron Nadab ahidu behazar and Aaron's son. So now the Levite out of the 12 tribe of Israel, the Levite were the one that was separated that belong to God. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only the Levite was chosen for God alone. Now out of the Levite, God is choosing priests. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; you catching this? &gt;&gt; Now Moses and Aaron, they were Levite. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; but when God spoke to Moses, Moses was a prophet, &gt;&gt; but Aaron was the high priest. &gt;&gt; So the ministry of ministering in the tabernacle was given to Aaron and his sons. That was not Aaron choice. That was God choice. &gt;&gt; And the reason why is appointing a high priest to stand there is to offer sacrifice for their own sin and for the sin of the people. So the high priest has to stand in between. He will be the only one that will enter into the holies of holies to offer the sacrifice or for the pardon of the people. Do you see that? That's the person God had chosen. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, all the Levites were not appointed to the same job. &gt;&gt; So out of the Levite, the priest came out, &gt;&gt; which was Aaron as a son. &gt;&gt; They were the only one appointed to work in the tabernacle. The Levite had different other job outside, you know, making sure that they carry the ark because remember the Levite had to carry the ark. &gt;&gt; But when it comes to the priest, not all all priests are Levite. &gt;&gt; But not all Levites are priests. &gt;&gt; I want you to to remember that. &gt;&gt; You can read the Bible, you can find it. &gt;&gt; It's there. They were appointed to bring sacrifice. They will enter. They will wear in a certain way. The high priest will have all this garment on. And you know, I'll tell you something. There's one that was appointed to wash the high priest. That was Moses alone. Moses is the one that had to wash them. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Put the clothes on. &gt;&gt; That's Aaron and his children. &gt;&gt; Only a prophet. &gt;&gt; I want you to catch that. Remember that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we're going to change the high priest in few minutes here. &gt;&gt; We have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of infirmity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the Lord Jesus Christ. We'll talk about it in a few minutes here. &gt;&gt; Moses was the only one that had to watch the high priest. They would offer sacrifice daily. But to Aaron, he had to enter into the holies of holies once a year. &gt;&gt; To atone for the sins of the people. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Because now remember in Genesis it was by the blood. You see? &gt;&gt; So now here it must be the blood too. &gt;&gt; Because without the shedding of blood there's no forgiveness of sin. &gt;&gt; So the blood was the only requirement of God to stand in between. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. &gt;&gt; The blood is the requirement. When God sees the blood, he cannot pass the blood. He says, "Kill an animal." This is the animal has to be blameless. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; We'll go faster here. The blood of the lamb was the only requirement. Now, in Hebrew 10:1, for the law having a shadow &gt;&gt; of good things what to come. This was just a shadow. &gt;&gt; But there is something good that is coming. &gt;&gt; Let's change a little bit here. Let's enter into the this was the priest the Levitical priesthood. &gt;&gt; But we have a higher priesthood than that. &gt;&gt; That's a mechicc priesthood &gt;&gt; that has no father, no mother, no beginning of days. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother says this mech has become Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; because Mechisedc is the theophony. &gt;&gt; But that theophony has become a man in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is another subject. &gt;&gt; That that's another subject for another day. You remember I mentioned the Old Testament, Moses had to introduce the high priest, wash him and his son, the sacrifice. Now, not just Aaron and his children, they had to be washed in the lav. You see, because there was the breast and altar after the breast and altar, we enter into the lav &gt;&gt; and then you face the holiest of the the uh the uh the the holy place. That's where the candlestick and the table of spread, you know, and the the altar of incense. Then after that veil, you enter into the holies of holies. That's where the ark of the covenant was. But now in the old testament, Moses was the one has to wash the high priest and his son. Aaron is his son and also wash the sacrifice at the lav. It was a basin, right? The bassin. So if you have the I wish I had the picture there. But let's see this. Matthew chapter 3 verse 13. Now we change the high priest. Now we have a high priest. &gt;&gt; That could enter once for all. &gt;&gt; There's only one that can could enter once for all. Now watch this. When Jesus then come Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, the word had to come to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; It says Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John &gt;&gt; to be baptized what? &gt;&gt; Of him. But John for forbade him, saying, I I have need to be baptized of thee. cometh thou to me? Jesus answered and said unto them, &gt;&gt; suffer it to be so. Now, &gt;&gt; for thus it becometh us to fulfill what? All righteousness. &gt;&gt; If it was the opposite, it will break the scripture. &gt;&gt; The high priest that was coming had to be washed by a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when we're reading the Old Testament, it's not just oh wa things are happening then &gt;&gt; they are the shadow of good things to come. [Music] &gt;&gt; The high priest had to be watched. &gt;&gt; I can't give you many examples. &gt;&gt; You know when Kafa stood before Jesus &gt;&gt; they asked him are you are you the Christ? He says you said it right. &gt;&gt; Kafa took and rent his clothes. You see that remember that &gt;&gt; in the old testament that disqualify a high priest. &gt;&gt; If he rents his clothes is disqualified. &gt;&gt; So Cphus at the time he was the high priest. So he broke the law but actually renting his clothes then that disqualify him as a high priest because the real high priest was standing there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see that &gt;&gt; that disqualify him completely. Because the real high priest had to stand into his ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saint, you have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're feeling. &gt;&gt; He stands for the ignorant. &gt;&gt; You have your Bible. Let's read. Let's read uh &gt;&gt; in the book of Hebrews chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 5. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews Hebrews chapter I don't think I have it on my my in my notes the PowerPoint. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 5. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; He's here this morning. Do you do you feel his presence? &gt;&gt; Amen. It says for every high priest take Oh, good. That's good. For every high priest taketh from among men &gt;&gt; is ordained for a man in thing pertaining to God &gt;&gt; that he may offer both gifts and sacrifice for what? For sins. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Who can have what? &gt;&gt; Compassion &gt;&gt; on the ignorant and on them that what are out of the way that they may he himself also compass what? with with infinity. That's why Jesus had to become men. &gt;&gt; He was a little lower than angel &gt;&gt; to feel what you are feeling. &gt;&gt; He could not qualify if he does not feel what you are feeling. &gt;&gt; He felt temptation. &gt;&gt; He felt the desire to get married. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he sanctify himself not to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He had a choice to make. He could have got married got married if he wanted to. &gt;&gt; Let me continue. I want you to catch this. Who have compassion on the ignorant? I'm I'm going to get back here because our high priest has to qualify. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Do you see that? How many of us want our high priest to qualify? &gt;&gt; He has to qualify. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh verse three. And by reason thereof he out as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sin. And no man taketh his honor unto himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron. So also Christ glorify not himself to be made an high priest, but he that said unto him, thou are my son to ever begotten thee, as he said also in another place, thou art a priest forever after the order of &gt;&gt; Mechisedc. &gt;&gt; There were two orders. ironic order or maybe the Leviticus order &gt;&gt; and this order here is the mechic order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now let's look at Jesus. Matthew chapter 14:14 Matthew chapter 14:14 Matthew 14:14 If they can post it real quick so that we can go not to waste our time. Matthew 14:14 the Bible says, "And Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude, and he was moved with what? &gt;&gt; Compassion toward what? Them. That he heal what? The sick." &gt;&gt; Luke 71. Luke 7:11. Luke 7:11 after and it was to pass the day after that he went into the city called nay and many of the disciple went with him and much people. Now when he came high to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, and the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and much people of the city was with him. And when the Lord saw him, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, weep not. &gt;&gt; Our high priest &gt;&gt; have also compassion &gt;&gt; for the ignorant. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you did not know any better, &gt;&gt; Jesus was looking down and say, "I want to save that one. I want to send him a message." &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet &gt;&gt; before the judgment day." &gt;&gt; You see, God's provided way. &gt;&gt; But there is something else I want to show you here. Leviticus chapter 16 14. How many of us love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you happy to be here? &gt;&gt; It's always good to be in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Leviticus 16 verse14. I'm entering into the blood now because we spoken about the high priest. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We to enter now with wash us with his own blood. He has to wash us with his own blood. Not the blood of goats anymore, but with his own blood. because he enter with his own blood to present to the father. He says this is the blood that I shed for these people. &gt;&gt; Le Vicus 16:14 and he was he shall take of the blood of the bulock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat his word. And before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger. How many times? &gt;&gt; How many times? &gt;&gt; This is a purpose. You know God, the Bible is not just written any type of way. &gt;&gt; Let's look what the prophet says. Now, Revelation chapter 4, we have a prophet in the land. &gt;&gt; You see the only the prophet knows can interpret the Bible. with divine vindication. It's not just saints. This is the blessing that we have received &gt;&gt; a prophet in the land. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 4, that's that that's not a scripture. That's a quote. Paragraph 101. Not this. Let's go over Leviticus chapter 16 and read in the back way back in the back of the Bible now in the Leviticus word uh law. See off in Leviticus 16th chapter and with the 14. And so it goes down. And he shall take the blood of the bulock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat. Upon the mercy seat. Because the mercy seat is on top of the ark &gt;&gt; and where there are two cherub facing each other. So the mercy seat is the area right centered &gt;&gt; upon the mercies watch we are going to get into this after eastward &gt;&gt; don't forget don't forget the word eastward &gt;&gt; where Jesus come from the east it says in the cloud of glory where does the sun rise east where will the sunrise east where was the mercy seat seeding toward the east. &gt;&gt; Why have I I I got you all sitting this way toward the east. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; It says why the altar is to the east. &gt;&gt; Well, we will see if after a while how beautifully I'm going to draw it out. I ask as many as could I bring paper so forth to get this map in few minutes. Let sprinkle eastward before the mercy seat. Shah sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Oh, isn't that beautiful? Seven time toward east. The seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Watch this. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. It says the seven church ages shall be covered by the blood. Which which blood of bulls and goat? No, with his own blood. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ upon the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; It says Jesus Christ blood just as sufficient it is yesterday, today, and forever &gt;&gt; and to every age to save every sinner, heal every sick person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring every miracle, every sign to pass. seven time way back yonder in the old testament. &gt;&gt; So the seven age the seven church ages every seven church ages is covered by the blood. &gt;&gt; But it says with his finger the Bible says with his finger he cast out demons. Right? &gt;&gt; But in another verse it says by his spirit he cast out the demon. You can't read in the Bible because the finger of God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can study that the finger of God is his spirit. &gt;&gt; But his spirit with his finger is sprinkling it seven time upon the mercy seat. The seven church ages. If you are part of that seven church ages, you are covered by the blood. And what is the blood is the message for every single church age. &gt;&gt; That's right. You want to know the blood of Jesus Christ is this message of the hour &gt;&gt; is the reveal word for this day &gt;&gt; is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you. &gt;&gt; When I'm saying the baptism, I'm not talking about the old one of the Lutheran. I'm talking about with the reveal word, &gt;&gt; the message of the hour for this day. &gt;&gt; People say, "I've received the Holy Ghost." But where &gt;&gt; you must believe one of the great evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this day is to receive the message of your hour. Oh yes, &gt;&gt; that's the evidence of the Holy Spirit not speaking in tongue &gt;&gt; because you cannot you can't speak in tongue and re reject this truth and you still you go to hell. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the message of the hour that you have received. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me get real quick here. The talking I'm going to go fast and I'll close. How many of us love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without the blood, there's no forgiveness of sin. Exodus chapter 12, the blood was the token. Do you see that? No, you can you can leave the court there. That's fine. Do you see that? The blood was the token. When I see the blood, I will pass over. &gt;&gt; The death angel was coming to strike the land. The only requirement was what? The blood that was the message of Moses. It does not apply today. You can't put the blood of a goat in your door. &gt;&gt; Without the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you go to hell. &gt;&gt; You are lost. &gt;&gt; So the blood of Jesus Christ has to be applied in here in your soul, in your heart. And to atone means to stand between the token. Now, Israel's slain lamb was the requirement of Jehovah and the blood was the token that the job had been done. Can you follow with me so we can read it together? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It says God requirement for redemption for Egypt to go to the promised land. The requirement he required a slain lamb animal and the animal must be the blood of the dead animal must be put upon the lentil and on the door and stood before stood for the token that the things that Jehovah had required had been fulfilled. You see that now the lamb was the token. &gt;&gt; Not sorry not the lamb was the token the blood was the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? The blood was the token and the life had gone out from the sacrifice &gt;&gt; and now the blood was the token. &gt;&gt; His order had been carried out. The blood stood for the token. &gt;&gt; The sign that this believers had done exactly what the requirement was. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; We saw the same way with Rahab. She asked. &gt;&gt; Let me read it real quick. Joshua chapter 2 verse2. Now therefore I pray you swear unto me. But the Lord since I have shown you kindness &gt;&gt; ye also show kindness unto my father's house and give me what? A true token. and that will save Eli my father and my mother and my brethren assisted all that they have to and deliver our life from death. And the man answered, "Now look here. Watch carefully here. It says our life for your life, yours. &gt;&gt; If ye ought to now this our business." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Do you see Jesus in all of that? &gt;&gt; In all this same And it shall be when the Lord has given us the land that ye will deal kindly and truly with with with thee. Rare the ollet she was redeemed. But the red sc the red uh the the scarlet thread. Red is danger. Red is a sign of redemption. She had displayed it on the city wall. the scarlet thread between judgment, the destruction of the city and her family. &gt;&gt; So when they see the scarlet thread, it was a sign that the that house had to be quite protected. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In Egypt, the blood was sitting there as a token that when I see the blood, the angel, the edge of the Lord will not destroy. You see that? &gt;&gt; Let's get into business now. Verse 20. &gt;&gt; I want you to catch this. The way brother Brandham explains it, &gt;&gt; the token, paragraph 20, it says the blood was a token of identification, the blood itself, the animal bled, died, his blood was on the wall. Now animal life that was in the blood, the life is in the blood. So therefore when the animal was killed and the life was broken from the animal the blood had to be the chemistry of the blood &gt;&gt; to stand for the token. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Sorry. Yes. To stand for the token because the life that was in the blood could not come back upon the believer because it was an animal life. &gt;&gt; Right? So the life that was in the animal cannot come back into a human because animal does not have a soul. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; It continues first paragraph 21. It says an animal life and a human life is absolutely different. &gt;&gt; There is not nothing in in it at all. You look take an animal blood and put it in you, you will die. You see, it's a different life in the animal blood than there is in human blood because the human has a soul and the animal has no soul. &gt;&gt; Verse 22, a paragraph of 22 rather. And now therefore, the blood itself, understand now the red chemistry, &gt;&gt; chemicals of the blood had to stand out on the door as a token that the lamb had died. Now because the life of the lamb could not come back on the human worshipper but today it was only a type. It was what only a type &gt;&gt; but today paragraph 22 uh 23 &gt;&gt; it says today it isn't the chemical blood &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; our Lord Jesus our lamb but it's the life that was in the blood &gt;&gt; which is what the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; it comes back and is the token that we have accepted and did exactly what God told us to do. &gt;&gt; And then by having the token, we are identified &gt;&gt; with our sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says only way anyone anyway only way anyone could tell that the house belongs to under the blood because the chemistry of the blood was what? on the door. &gt;&gt; The pastor, the death angel had to look and see the blood. Now again, it was the type of what? The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Now see, the literal blood of Jesus Christ could not come upon each one of us &gt;&gt; because he just had so much blood in his body. &gt;&gt; It drip off and out of his body into the ground 2,000 years ago. But he wasn't to be the talking. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; The life. &gt;&gt; The life that was in the blood was the Oh my goodness. was the token now. &gt;&gt; Not the chemistry of the blood that fell 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; But the life that was in the blood, &gt;&gt; Amen. is the one that is the token. &gt;&gt; And what is the life? The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the token. &gt;&gt; Life. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; It says, "I'll prove to you it's the token that is to come upon each of us &gt;&gt; to show that we have been identified with our sacrifice and have carried over what request." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Jesus when he was on earth when the body when the corpal body was on earth it says nevertheless I will tell you the truth that's John chapter 16:7 it is expedient for you that I go away &gt;&gt; it says for if I go not away the comforter will not come upon you &gt;&gt; but if I depart I will send him unto you. &gt;&gt; So for the Holy Spirit to be released into the church, he had to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus had to go. The corporal body had to die &gt;&gt; to be buried, resurrected, ascended into heaven. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And he is sitting as the high priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that spirit that was in that blood &gt;&gt; came back the day of Pentecost. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says wait until you ended with power. &gt;&gt; The life that was in the blood came back into the church. &gt;&gt; The very life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not divided, separate himself into 120. &gt;&gt; That's why people of the city could look at him and says, "Oh, they look like Jesus." &gt;&gt; That's why in Antioch, they called them Christians. &gt;&gt; Because they were acting like Christ. So when you see a Christian, you don't see something different. &gt;&gt; You see Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Then Peter stood up the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin. Ye shall receive what? The gift of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; What is the life of the blood? The baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he says that promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is unto you. That life that was in the blood. Oh, glory to God. Somebody's catching this. &gt;&gt; That life that was in the blood is unto you. &gt;&gt; Right? And unto what? Your children. &gt;&gt; Not just upon yourself. Your children also. It says the promise unto you and to your children as to all that what are a far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; So the promise of the Holy Ghost is not just for you. So if you have received it, you go to seek for somebody else or you will have to give your children to get it &gt;&gt; because that promise is not for you alone. It's for all your children. &gt;&gt; They are particular of that same blessing. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; And you know, I was I was just reading and I thought about this. You know, when Peter was in in in prison, the spirit of Christ, the life that was in the blood now is in the 120. When when Peter got arrested, he was in prison. What did the saints do? &gt;&gt; They pray for him. &gt;&gt; They start and they're setting for Peter. Amen. &gt;&gt; And few minutes they saw somebody knocking at the door. &gt;&gt; One of the girls thought it was Peter the &gt;&gt; he says, "Oh, that's Peter angel." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He thought it was Peter's theophony &gt;&gt; that was at the door. But that was Peter. &gt;&gt; That's why interceding. See the importance of interceding for a brother. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in you would do it. If Jesus could intercede, you have to intercede &gt;&gt; because you have the very life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You say amen to that. &gt;&gt; My I'm coming to a close here. How many of us love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in you will intercede. I want to read a scripture here. Romans chapter 8. Likewise, the spirit also helps our infirmity. For we know not what we should pray. For as we ought, but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us in groaning which cannot what? &gt;&gt; Be altered. Do you see that? The Holy Spirit in you will intercede. Are you catching this? Abraham interced for a lot because it was the spirit of Christ in Abraham to do it. The spirit of God in you would also do intercession &gt;&gt; not just for you alone for those that you have loved to. Amen. &gt;&gt; One day, brother Brener was having a discernment service in Monzian, Illinois and Billy Paul came, you know, he was at the hotel and Billy Paul came and knock at the door. Says, "Dad, you know, it was time for the service, but the Benham was there just crying. He didn't know what was going on. He was just crying and and he told Billipy Paul came and and opened the door a little bit. They said Billy Paul just tell the Baxter, you know, just tell by brother the backer to go ahead with the meeting. Maybe I'll come tomorrow night. Brother Benham was just crying and crying and crying. And few minutes later, as Billy Paul was getting ready to leave, brother Benham could hear somebody's voice speaking. He heard somebody sounded like German. He went outside. He said, "Who is speaking in this language?" &gt;&gt; He didn't even know that it was the spirit speaking through his lips. Amen. &gt;&gt; And by the time I'm came, he says, "Oh, what is all going? What's what's going on?" He was just speaking and few minutes later, he got up really quick. He rushed outside. As Bilipo was getting ready to leave, he says, "Belip, wait, wait, wait, wait." He went into the room and washed his face. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And went to the meeting. &gt;&gt; When he went to the meeting, there was a woman that was on the way from Minneapolis here was losing blood. The doctor said anytime that she has she loses blood again, she's going to die. &gt;&gt; And on the way they were coming for the meeting, they couldn't bring her to the meeting and she start bleeding. You know what brother says? &gt;&gt; It says the Holy Spirit when you receive the testimony of the healing of the sisters. &gt;&gt; It says what time was &gt;&gt; this? &gt;&gt; And when you look at the time, it was the time that the Holy Spirit was interceding. Brother says the Holy Spirit was interceding for that woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Saint this is not just for brother Bham alone. &gt;&gt; It's for you too. &gt;&gt; You come with a b every time that you feel a burden to pray &gt;&gt; saint. Let me say this. If you ever feel the desire to pray, Satan will never ask you to pray. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? If you feel the desire, ever you feel just something is telling you, get on your knees and pray. &gt;&gt; Don't never disobey that voice. &gt;&gt; Maybe your son is somewhere else in danger. &gt;&gt; Your prayer, the Holy Spirit would intercede for your son &gt;&gt; at the moment when you don't even know. &gt;&gt; So s every time you hear a burden in your heart to pray, Satan will never tell you go pray. Because if Satan stand against his own kingdom, his kingdom will be completely destroyed. &gt;&gt; Means God want you to do something. &gt;&gt; You see how we have to be available. &gt;&gt; The re the Holy Ghost that we have received is not for us to put on the shelf. &gt;&gt; Is to lead us to be conscious of his presence. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close. &gt;&gt; But there's another story also. &gt;&gt; How many of us love story? I think brother D can do a better job than I, &gt;&gt; you know. But the bellum one day he was having a service in another city. He saw he was he was a little hungry and and he went outside to to get something to eat. And as he entered into a little place, a little diner, whatever you would call it, he got in and and as soon as he entered, he saw a old lady really immorally dressed on this side. The policeman had his hand around a girl and all of that. He looks down. He says, "Man, what in the world God want?" In his own heart, he says, "God, why don't you just destroy all these people? What in the world is this? This is sinful. How can you allow these things to happen right here? And God called him on the side. &gt;&gt; Then he saw a vision. He saw the world turning around and all of this thing. And few minutes later, he saw himself as a young man &gt;&gt; sinning. He says, "Oh, that's how my sin has done to you." &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; This is what what I've done wrong that is hurting you like that. Brother Benham says I could see Jesus Christ. His blood was there before before judgment and he was playing as a bumper. &gt;&gt; And the Holy God told him he says you want that that woman to be to die. &gt;&gt; What about your own sin here? &gt;&gt; And he took the book and wherever he had done wrong, he was crossed and say pardon. &gt;&gt; It was crossed pardon. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It says if I have pardoned you, &gt;&gt; don't you want to pardon also somebody else? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime we so hard on people that have wronged us, done something wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But how many mistakes and sin we have committed. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not even to the measure of what your brother and sister have done. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Saints, tonight we have this afternoon, we need to come with a heart of repentance. I'm going to conclude this. The ministry of intercession is the ministry of Jesus Christ for the ignorance, the weak, the lost soul. The bride of Jesus Christ has received the same ministry as the bridegroom. If Christ has done it, you have to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the same spirit that is in you. &gt;&gt; Exposition of the church ages. I'm going to read this and close. He had made us. Brother Benam is reading from the scripture we just read. It says he had made us. Oh, there a certain truth we need to emphasize. This is now of them. This is one of them. He has made us. Salvation is is doing. Remember Israel wanted to do something by his their own. Do you see that? We we spoke about it, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, let's go back to the scripture. I'll read the scripture first, please. Be ye are a chosen generation. &gt;&gt; Are you catching now as we rotating everything, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, you see clear a little bit. Yes, &gt;&gt; ye are a chosen generation, &gt;&gt; a royal priesthood, &gt;&gt; a holy nation, &gt;&gt; a peculiar people &gt;&gt; that should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. &gt;&gt; What light? The message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let me read this part. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead, and the princes of the kings of the earth, &gt;&gt; unto him that what? &gt;&gt; Loved us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see why you are elect and chosen to be here? &gt;&gt; Because he loved you. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; And wash us from what? Our sin in his what? own blood. Not the blood of bulls and goats. &gt;&gt; With his own blood that is washing you. &gt;&gt; What is his blood? The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; In other words, the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; the revealed word for your day. &gt;&gt; Because the truth set you free and the word is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he has made us king and priest unto God and his father. Let me read this quote. He has made us. There are certain truth we need to emphasize this one. This is one of them. He has made us. Salvation is his doing. &gt;&gt; He brought for he brought us from a for a uh he brought us for a purpose. &gt;&gt; We are kings, spiritual kings. We are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sit on his throne. But now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual what? Kingdom. &gt;&gt; It says Roman 5:17. For if by one man of first death reign by one, much more they have received abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And in Colossians 1:13, who has delivered us from the power of darkness has translated us into the kingdom, brother says what? reign of his dear son right now. &gt;&gt; Right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Right now, &gt;&gt; we reign with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have dominion over sin, &gt;&gt; the world, the flesh, and the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Showing forth his praise and glory. &gt;&gt; Showing forth himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For it is Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. It is Christ in us. &gt;&gt; Willing and doing his what? Good pleasure. &gt;&gt; Yes indeed. Even now we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. &gt;&gt; You know when he says sitting in heavenly places, brother Brandham says heaven consists of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. that everywhere that the word is preached, we are sitting in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Heaven is where the word is. &gt;&gt; When the word is there, heaven is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; It continues. &gt;&gt; I love this. &gt;&gt; It says, "And made us the same quote." It should be the same code. The same uh uh All right. What's the next one? Oh, never mind. I'll continue. No, you can't you can't hide this. It says this was the more important. I mean, not all of them are important, but this is the point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And made us priests. Yes. Priest unto him. &gt;&gt; Do you remember Christ interceding spirit in what? In this end time, right? It says for for he had made us yes priest unto him &gt;&gt; offering spiritual praises praise of sanctified lips. &gt;&gt; Are you catching this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Offering the spiritual praises of sanctified lips. spending our life, spending our life a sweet offering &gt;&gt; unto him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham says this, worshiing him. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this? &gt;&gt; Worshiing him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; It says interceding. &gt;&gt; Are you you see why he's making us priests? It says interceding and petitioning. &gt;&gt; You are worshiping in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; You are interceding and you are petitioning &gt;&gt; for somebody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are interceding for somebody else. &gt;&gt; It says king and priest unto our God. No wonder the world goes not appealed to us. We are a peculiar people. Sellious unto good works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this last quote. The Messiah. And I think Sister Naomi would appreciate this. You know, I was studying and I I saw I saw this quote that was after I had a conversation with Sister Naomi. I think Sister Naomi, you'll catch this. It says, "Now, this is true. God called Messiah. It says God called us. We become king and priest unto God. Like Jesus was God's high priest. He says we become what? Lesser priest. Jesus was God in fullness. Dwell in him to send forth the expression of God to the world. For God was in Christ reconciling the worldwide to himself. And as God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, God comes into his church. &gt;&gt; And I anoint him some messiahs. &gt;&gt; This is very strong. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You catch that? &gt;&gt; Yes. The same thing he did in his church. &gt;&gt; The same power he did he had is in his church. &gt;&gt; And his church become what? His dominion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is king over his dominion. Dominion. And we are king and priest offering spiritual sacrifices to God. the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name. Hallelujah. Oh my. There you are. Messiah. Messiah. Leo Messiah. &gt;&gt; Leo. Anointed one. &gt;&gt; Anointed off of what? The main one. &gt;&gt; Anointed off of the great one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know who you are. You are a priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To offer sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To intercede for your lost one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; How many of us want to intercede for somebody tonight? &gt;&gt; God has given you the Holy Spirit to intercede. &gt;&gt; This is the ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Jesus Christ in you, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But saints, we have a job to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a job to do. We have a lot to do. &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says, "Confess your fault one to another. &gt;&gt; Pray one for another that ye may be healed." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? You can't pray for a brother who be healed. &gt;&gt; When you say healing is not just healing. Healing comes out of the word soozo means you know to to to includes the soul. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; The healing is not just because you're sick in the body. &gt;&gt; What about the healing of the soul too? What about the healing of the spirit? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says the effectual Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fervent prayer of a righteous man &gt;&gt; veth. And brother Benham says, "A righteous man is not a sinless man." &gt;&gt; A righteous man is the one that is willing to acknowledge his wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see where repentance is coming from. &gt;&gt; You're willing to acknowledge your wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God sees your heart. &gt;&gt; He knows that you didn't mean to do it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why we have to come back to the alt and say, "God, I repent of all my sin. &gt;&gt; I'm guilty." When God sees a Oh, glory. a repented sinner. &gt;&gt; He says, "This is a righteous man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not the way you see it. &gt;&gt; It's the way God sees it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sees a righteous man. He sees a righteous woman. Why? By his grace and with the blood of Jesus Christ that cleans us from all sin. Shall we stand? May God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ministry of intercession. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now he has anointed you to carry the same job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of us love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Is there somebody here that feels like they are wrong? They say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I need your help." Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Adam in the Garden of Eden vividly made a decision to stand for his wife. If you read read the message when brother speak about Zakius, it says it was because of his wife. His wife Rebecca was interceding for Zakius. What about Wright? She interceded. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; For her children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about the woman in Memphis? &gt;&gt; It was the little boy that had seen had done wrong about to die, but she could look in the word. It says, "Where is my Elijah?" &gt;&gt; The heart of an interceeding mother. Saint, I don't care how far your children are. Yes. &gt;&gt; As I said on Wednesday, I'm standing here because somebody 20 years ago &gt;&gt; was praying for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; There was a mother somewhere. There was a father somewhere. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That were crying all night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, help this young man that he can serve you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And here am I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of somebody standing in a gap for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever your children are, stay a little longer. Pray for them. &gt;&gt; God will bring them back. &gt;&gt; I myself was far away from God &gt;&gt; because of a prayer of a mother and a father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am here. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; So if God did it for me, &gt;&gt; Yes. He can do it for you. &gt;&gt; Somebody having a husband far away or a wife, you can identify yourself with Rebecca as a as a husband as a wife rather. You can look back at the seed for your husband as Zak as Rebecca did for Zakius. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The same Jesus is here this afternoon. Amen. Because we just said we're sitting in heavenly places. The word of God is here. Jesus Christ is here. If you have somebody next to you, just lay your hand on him on her. &gt;&gt; Saint, I don't want you to pray for yourself. Don't pray for you. If the Holy Spirit is in you, whatever you're going to pray and to sit for that brother or that sister that is next to you, God is able to honor your prayer. Even the young ones, maybe you may not understand what all of this thing means. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But your little prayer that you just if you're a young one, you sitting by somebody that's older than you, just pray for them. We're serving a living God church. This is the time where we need to to mean it from our hearts that if somebody is sick, God can heal them instantly this afternoon because God cannot say one thing and do the other. But you must believe it. Saint I can't preach. Anybody can come and preach it. Until you believe it, nothing will happen. That's why I challenge you to believe. Shall we bow our heads? Heavenly Father, the creator of heaven and earth, the gift of all the gift. Lord, we can feel your presence in this building. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Father, take control now at this moment as we give way to your spirit. Bring a spirit of conviction, oh God, Father, that this afternoon, that your children will never be the same. &gt;&gt; Lord, you have this thing on my heart. that somebody may be blessed. &gt;&gt; Lord God, you are the same yesterday to them forever. You are the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star, the fairest of 10,000, the stone that came out of the mountain without the help of any. The fourth man in the fire, &gt;&gt; the rock of ages, &gt;&gt; the Messiah, &gt;&gt; the mighty angel of Revelation chapter 10, &gt;&gt; you are here this morning, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray as the church of the living God, &gt;&gt; Lord, asking your blessing upon the life of all your children &gt;&gt; that every needs, oh God, Father, that is coming before your presence Father, may you answer them tonight.
