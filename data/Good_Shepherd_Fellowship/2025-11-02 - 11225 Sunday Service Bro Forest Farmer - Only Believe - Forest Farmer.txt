Is that the voice? H Okay, then don't don't don't post the the the voice. Just post the quote and then play the voice if if you can try it. Let's see if it works. If it does not just just play the just just post the code and then we will read it or maybe I just play from my phone. There's a man waiting for a child next got something wrong with his feet. That's right, isn't it? I don't know. Are you your stranger to me? Mr. Farmer, do you believe that God's going to heal a child and make it well? If I'm a stranger, do you raise your hands like that? Is that what she's praying about? Is that what your name is all about? Just raise your hand. You have your request. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, uh there's uh brother Brandon calling brother Farmer uh dad in the in the prayer line. That's what I wanted for us to play and that was the reason why we started playing that message yesterday. And uh uh uh you see it is is uh is is no form of uh uh it's it's not about uh forest farmer. Uh the reason why I thought uh uh you know uh I needed to play it and I do it all the time whenever he preached for us. It is just a way to uh to encourage our faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; It just and I believe that's that's what the tape is for. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham says rapturing faith out on those tapes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's all there when we listen to what God uh uh has done and what he's doing. Uh it gave us faith to believe for our situation. Praise the Lord. But you think about it this morning if uh uh you know uh how many years that was. I think there that was 1961 and um um April 27 if my mind set me right. Uh and and you think about that. Uh and and he said that uh uh I believe if we still had Congressman Upure and he was in Minneapolis and we could get a hold of him to come to Good Shepherd and and just fellowship with us and say Congressman you just uh we give you five minutes of our time just testify and it would not be about the testimony &gt;&gt; even though he will be telling us what he experienced and what happened to him but for you and myself to be able to see a man that was lying in the bed for for how many years crippled because he fell from from on the hearse and yet he's standing before us. Praise the Lord. And I think that is the same thing this morning. If we ever had the privilege to have that blind man in m in St. John chapter 9 in our assembly and and and uh and and brought him to the pulpit and say just give us a testimony and you and you and you sitting there and you're looking at a man that was blind that was born blind and he's looking at you back. What a feeling. What a feeling that the thing that you have read about in the Bible. &gt;&gt; The person you have read about in the Bible. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And how many times I've listened to that tape uh uh uh I mean every other year I go through my my daily uh uh tape listening to audience and uh and and and just to come to that reality there what I've heard on tape and and year is right right there before me uh a man that was crippled as a boy sitting in the meeting and he was not even on the front row. They were back in the balcony. I think the last time when brother Farmer was here, he show us the picture way back in the balcony. But yet the Holy Ghost pick him up. Don't you believe that that God knows where you are sitting this morning &gt;&gt; and he knows uh what is the need in your life? &gt;&gt; What you thinking in your mind? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon will say your thoughts are not even hidden from me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand on our feet now. It's by grace that I'm in this place. I don't know how God choose me, but I'm thankful that he did. I'm only in this message by grace. I'm holy in this message by grace. It is only by grace that I'm in this place. I don't know how God choose me, but I'm thankful that he paid. I am holy in this message by grace. Oh yes, I'm holy in this message. By grace is by grace only by grace that in this place I don't know how he choose me but I'm thankful that he did I am only in this message by grace. Let's sing that one more time. Oh yes, I am holy in this message by grace. It is only by grace that I'm in this place. I don't know how he choose me, but I'm thankful that he did. I am only in this message by grace. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I'll never get tired &gt;&gt; of the song. of amazing grace, how sweet the sound Oh, &gt;&gt; but now I have &gt;&gt; I have But now I see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless y'all this morning. I'm sorry I held you so long last night, &gt;&gt; but I'm so glad that the Lord came up &gt;&gt; this morning as we approached the Lord. If you'd have an unspoken request or something, you just want to raise your hand. Uh, by God's grace, about the time that service started last night, we had a a deacon uh there in the town that that I live close to that was in a horrible accident and yet there was no fatalities in it. &gt;&gt; Jesus, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. and it he'll be in some pain and uh had a a fractured a disc in his back, but we're trusting the Lord to touch him and heal him. &gt;&gt; But thanking God for what he did. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But from the looks of the car, you wouldn't expect that anyone would survive it. &gt;&gt; A car hit him head on at 65 mph. Yes. &gt;&gt; But the Lord was merciful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, we we could exhaust the clock before we could ever express our gratitude for you, Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And all that you've done, all that your amazing grace has performed for us, Lord. But we thank you for it. And now this morning, Lord, you see the hands that we lifted up to you. And Lord, we're trusting you again this morning. May you come down amongst us, Father. Make yourself known to each and everyone. We pray in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. If you want to turn in the scriptures, I I'd like to read from Colossians 1 and 12. I I know brother Juan had had just played that portion of the message of of only believe where uh brother Brennham had called out my dad about my feet. Brother Brandon made a statement in there. He said, "You've got your request." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; My dad's request was, "If that was God's prophet, let him call me out about my voice speak." &gt;&gt; By so many infallible proofs. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh you know in in spiritual food in due season there was a a sister that came up through the prayer line and and uh when she come up uh brother Brandham said uh you're real nervous and then he said you're just that right time to get nervous. He said what it is it's a a lady's trouble a female trouble. And he said, "And another thing said, you desire the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Do you believe if I lay hands on you, the Holy Ghost will come?" And she says, "Yes." And he said, "You believe that?" She said, "Yes, sir." So, Brother Brandham lays hands on her and he said, "Lord, I pray that the Holy Ghost would come in the apostolic form." And as she goes away, he said, "Now remember, it's the children's bread." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And about that time, my mother stepped up. And mom and dad had had four of us kids then, but they wanted another one. And my mother was standing in the line for it because the doctor had told the mom and dad they couldn't have any more children because it was apt to take my mother's life. She had a lot of trouble carrying the two sisters that are younger than me. And when she stepped up, Brother Brandham said, "You had a funny feeling when I said female trouble, didn't you?" Said, "Because that's what you had. Y'all know I don't speak real perfect English, &gt;&gt; but I do know that had is behind you. &gt;&gt; That was on July the 18th. I could read in the scriptures this morning about how that Melchazedc showed up and Abraham had a meeting for him. &gt;&gt; Yes. And he said, "According to the time of life, &gt;&gt; but in my lifetime." Nine months and 10 days later on April the 26th 28th, pardon me, my baby brother was born. &gt;&gt; He's a deacon at Brother Josh Bennett's Church in North Carolina this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I was there when brother Wayey was raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister Carlin and brother Scotty I had brother way in their home for a week where he had told them about what had happened of how that when brother Brandham was talking about a a a complex and that we all have complexes and we all have things that affect us. But thank God that the Holy Ghost comes not only to heal our body, not only the soul, but even our spirits that get wor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he turned to his wife and said, "I resent that." &gt;&gt; If you're listening to the tape about three minutes later, he's laying in the floor dead. Brother Brandham told everybody said, "Just be praying." and he walked around this side of the platform. Brother Charlie Cox said he always liked to take the position on that side. He said because brother Brandham said the angel would come and stand at his right side. Said if he had to go there, he had to come past me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham just walked around that side and went down to where the brother way was laying there dead, laid hands on him and said, "Lord, I pray that you'd come and restore my brother's life to him." He tells about it that night on the next service. And he said his heartbeat three times real fast like thump thump thump and then just went to be normal. Brother Weey opened his eyes and wanted to know what happened. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And what he did back there, he can still do today. If he was a healer in the meetings then, he's still a healer here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that we've been able to see the works of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, there's an old song that we used to sing. I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep you standing, but &gt;&gt; I I just have to say it as it comes to me. &gt;&gt; And the song said, "Every time a robin flies, you just dedicated a little one." Or a newborn baby cries, I know that I have seen the works of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me to ever be mindful of his work. &gt;&gt; Father, as we look at your word this morning, ask may you come down and quicken your word to us, Lord, that it would become alive in our hearts. We pray for we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus. the uplifted hands, Lord. All the needs that we have, you're here to take care of them. And we so thank you. That's what the songs of praise to you, Lord, has been about this morning. Now may you come down and in heaven our praise Lord and our hearts and our bodies, our minds for your glory in Colossians chapter 1. I'd like to start reading at the 12th verse. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be such a big baby. But when his presence comes through, giving thanks unto the Father, which have made us meat, to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness &gt;&gt; and hath translated us &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of his dear son. &gt;&gt; In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the image &gt;&gt; of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him &gt;&gt; and for &gt;&gt; may the Lord add his blessings to his word. &gt;&gt; You can be seated. We know the prophet of God has told us that before that he ever created a flesh body of Jesus but spirit Christ created all things. Everything that was created. The angels that was created, you and I that were created before we had this. and was with him back there. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Farmer, do you understand all of that?" No, I don't. &gt;&gt; But I believe it because it's his word. &gt;&gt; Church, there's many things that I don't understand. I just have to tell you that this morning. We sing songs and we hear people talk about what will it be when we get over there and and and we've heard songs about how that we'll ask the questions and he'll tell us why when we talk it over in the by and by. But will we even need to do that, sis? &gt;&gt; Because we're going to know him as he is because we're going to have a glorious body likened on to his. &gt;&gt; Will we even have a need &gt;&gt; to ask him? &gt;&gt; Or will we just know? &gt;&gt; I don't know. But I can tell you this that when the prophet of God got translated the same word that's used here of of you and I remember there's only two places in the scripture that it ever speaks of translated and that was Enoch and his rapture and hers about us in our rapture. &gt;&gt; That we have been translated. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, church, it's not that I will miss the rapture. I'm already part of it &gt;&gt; because I've already been translated out of the works of darkness and into this kingdom of light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But how did the prophet him grieving the lowest point in his life tried to take his own life and a gun wouldn't go off. &gt;&gt; I've not had to face grief like that to I've not had to lose a little one. I haven't had to lose one. And he said he went to sleep or something. And he said, "I dreamed that I was going out across the prairie." He said, "There was a wagon there with a busted wheel on it." And I was singing the song. "Oh, the wheel on the wagon is broken." And he said it represented my broken home. &gt;&gt; Remember little Sharon Rose was only about a ninemon old baby, just big enough. Brother Brandham talked about when they took the chair away that he came home and and his wife said I I had the boys to dig you up some worms and and said he'd honk the horn on the car and little Becky would hold or or little Sharon Rose would hold out her arms and just start gooing. Amen. &gt;&gt; But over there, &gt;&gt; beautiful young blondhaired girl come up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello, daddy. &gt;&gt; He said, "Daddy, &gt;&gt; and said, "Ma'am, you're almost as old as I am." &gt;&gt; She said, "Daddy, you don't know where you're at." &gt;&gt; Amen. said on earth I was your Sharon Rose and he said Sharon honey I don't understand had a 9-month old baby but over there said daddy remember your teaching on immortality that's a pretty big word for a 9-month old baby &gt;&gt; I don't understand all of it but I know it &gt;&gt; yes that's right hallelujah Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's fornowledge. &gt;&gt; I just want to share a little bit a few things with you this morning. The prophet of God told us that the Bible was was set in order so perfectly mathematically. And we see that how from the covenant that God made with Abraham, it was exactly 14 generations to David coming on the scene. And then it was another 14 generations to where Israel had went into captivity. We were talking some about last night about how they were up and down and up and down. And if you have a study Bible, you look in it where they had kings that were peaks of righteousness and and then they had the depths of one that that wasn't worth shooting hardly. Then they'd be back up and and even with the judges, how they were just up and down and and oh, how many times that we can look at our own lives, how that oh my, we come out of a service like what we had last night and you're way up here, but but then it seemed like something will happen and if I if I would have let it when I I went home and my wife telling me which I had called her about what was going on before the service of what was was being posted up here and what was being played. The the portion of the tape that you were listening to &gt;&gt; was the same thing that we were sharing at home and my pastor sent me a text with part of that in it &gt;&gt; three days ago. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the God that's over Arkansas is the same God that's in Minnesota. And what he's what he's want to get across to his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What he's trying to tell his people, then you'll hear that it's over in Tennessee. And you'll hear that it's down at Ever, Texas. And what is it? It's not because we're all getting on the phone conversing with one another, but we're on a to the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. here. A few years ago, you know, before they they had these things that was called a a prepaid phone plan, &gt;&gt; and it was cheaper and because you could make some money if you sold the program to somebody else and and oh, they would just almost drive you crazy. People that didn't want nothing to do with you. It's all brother Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Have you got a phone plan? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I told one of them they'd had about three of them to go through the church. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yes, brother. I have a phone plan." He said, "Have you got the uh the uh new plan?" I I I said, "No, I've got the old plan." And he said, "Oh, well, brother, on the new plan, I can get a hold of the owner of I can get a hold of the head of the company." I said, "I can do that." &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you can." I said, "Yes, sir. I sure can." I said, "24 hours a day." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Well, is it STS?" I said, "No, it it's not STS." I said, "It's RTS." &gt;&gt; He said, "I've never heard of RTS." I said, "I'm sorry to hear that." I said, "It's the best there is." He said, "RTS? What does that stand for?" I said, "Royal Telephone Service. Telephone the glory. Oh, what joy to find. I can feel the moving on." &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh yeah, I'm a salesman for RTF. &gt;&gt; I'd like to sell you a policy this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Farmer, does it put a lot of money in your pocket? No. But the retirement benefits are out of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, these things that they come and go, but I I want you to see that through all of this, God had a plan. &gt;&gt; 14 generations to David, then another 14 generations to the children of Israel. Now, they went through their golden age under the reign of Solomon, but then it went down, down, down, down until finally the Lord in having to get them to turn their eyes back on him. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes the Lord has to do you and me that way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. When everything's going good, it seems like our prayer life slacks off. &gt;&gt; But when we get bombarded with prayer requests that's coming in, Sherry and I uh in uh there on Friday before I left, just Friday morning, we had three or four new prayer requests. Uh people was calling or sending a text and saying, "Hey, we need to pray for this. We need to pray for that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then it drives you to your knees again. Although you may have spent time in prayer this morning, but something else comes in. Well, let's just pray for him right now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God would have to do something to Israel to cause them to turn their eyes back onto him. But then another 14 generations. God's not just counting time and years, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But these three great events to the coming of the Messiah was another 14 generations. &gt;&gt; 42 generations that God was looking at. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; And then somebody says, "Oh, but California hasn't &gt;&gt; some yet." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, it wasn't made manifest during Brother Brandham's lifetime. Neither was all of Isaiah's prophecy manifested &gt;&gt; for almost 800 years. &gt;&gt; But because God had said, "A virgin shall conceive." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There had to come a time. Now, did they understand it? Probably Isaiah didn't understand it either, but all he knew was God had said it and he had the boldness as a man of God to come forth and just tell the people God said it was going to be this way. &gt;&gt; They might have asked Isaiah, "When is it going to be?" I don't know, but it's coming. The same WAY THAT A PROPHET IN THIS DAY SAID THAT GOD HAD A BRIDE THAT would not fall. THE FIRST EVE FELL, BUT THE second Eve would not fall. &gt;&gt; How can that be? I don't know. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. BUT GOD SAVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 7, the prophet sent up to King Ahaz and and told him, he said, "Ask God for a sign." And that king, oh, I would to God, we had some politicians around now that was that humble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will not challenge God like that. He said, "I'll not tempt God." &gt;&gt; But Isaiah turns back around and tells him and says, "Behold, God will give you a sign." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Isaiah, that's never happened before. Now, you know, to us, 750 or 800 years sounds like a long time. It's been 500 years since Columbus discovered America. Plymouth Rock and the Pilgrim, 400. I was up in the Northeast here not too long ago. come back through some of that. And I I I I didn't have the time to do it because of of where I needed to be that next day, but uh I I was within 120 miles of Plymouth Rock up there. And you know some of these places where things have happened where men have stood by the grace of God I've been able to stand behind three pull pits but the prophet of God preach it gracious &gt;&gt; here I was telling brother one the other day it's been uh maybe five or six weeks ago that I was up in Sabino Canyon and we we're standing right there at Eagle Rock and and it turned into a church service a young min I say young ministry 40 45 years old but you know when you get my age everybody's young &gt;&gt; all that's right &gt;&gt; but uh at any rate he had said something he said I don't remember the tape that it's on, but I just heard it a couple three weeks before. And I said, "Brother, I believe that's on." And when I did, this other brother and his wife and three little kids probably from six or seven and maybe the oldest one, 12, and a sister Walls, which uh the brother uh Brian Walls is a nephew to brother Mike Walls that has a church up here in Ohio. And uh so as it was, brother Doug Baker passed me off on him for because he was going to take this other family and he wanted to know if it'd be all right with me if I just went. And I said, "Sure." He he said, "You'll enjoy it." And so when I met him, I said, "I'm telling you right now, Brother Doug Baker said, I was going to enjoy you." So I I'm looking forward to it. But uh brother uh Brian's wife said uh brother Farmer were you ever in any of brother Brandham's meeting. Don't ask me that. I said the first one that I was in I was healed. &gt;&gt; And I just started witnessing to her. But I'm looking up on my phone and we had enough signal up in Sabino Canyon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That when I got done telling it, I played what your pastor played this morning. &gt;&gt; And she stood there crying. And uh what I didn't know until a month ago, five weeks ago when I was up there, is where that rock had eagle in it that brother Brandham took the picture of it. They was planning on building a park up at the head of Sabino Canyon back years and years ago. And during the depression, they run out of money. But some of their uh preparation work they had drilled down in Eagle Rock &gt;&gt; because they was going to that's where the road was going to be to go up to this lake and and park that they was going to do at the head of of Sabino Creek. And when they blasted that off &gt;&gt; it was in this age That rock had been there for eons of time. &gt;&gt; But it was in this age that that word eagle was revealed. When they blasted it off, it was &gt;&gt; what God has done in this day. &gt;&gt; How many generations back was it that he put eagle in that rock? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't need to know because everything that I have need to know. He will reveal to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So we see the Lord though wasn't just measuring in in in years but by all of these generations. But I want you to notice that a virgin shall conceive did not start 2800 years ago. &gt;&gt; But whenever it was that we was a thought in God's mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Isaiah's prophecy was a thought in God's mind with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It didn't start to 2800 years ago, but it was somewhere back there that there's no way to measure because it was part of eternity. Remember everything that we know is time was just that hickey. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything else it just was. In the beginning was the word and the word was God. &gt;&gt; The word was was with God and the word was God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It just was. I don't have to put a time on it. You don't have to put a time on it. You don't even have to explain it to a skeptic because if they're skeptical enough, they'd find something wrong with the infallible proofs they already have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet the infallible proofs are yet manifesting themsel over and over and over. things that brother Brandham said on tape, they're just now finding out about it down here at Rochester. &gt;&gt; It's truth. &gt;&gt; They're finding out that worry causes cancer. We heard that on a tape. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're just now discovering that. &gt;&gt; How far advanced would medical science have been &gt;&gt; if the doctors and the scientist would have just sat down and talked to a prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Brandham talked about how that that Einstein when he found that a theory of relativity of how that time was relative, he said he was right on the verge of discovering eternity. &gt;&gt; Yet it's took science all this time just to try and catch up. And the more that they try to disprove God's word is, the more that they're proving it to be the &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The works of God. Many times a prophet did not know what he prophesied &gt;&gt; on things that are to be. In paragraph 28, brother Brandham says uh uh he said through the prophets, I referred to it last evening like we take Isaiah when he said a virgin shall conceive. Who would think that that a man was was thought of among the people to say such a word as that? A virgin shall conceive. But because he But because he a prophet is a reflector of God. He is made so he cannot speak his own words. It has to be God's words that he speaks. He's just like a reflector. And he is God's mouthpiece. And so therefore, he said, "A virgin shall conceive." He probably could not understand it. But God had spoke it through him because he promised that he would do nothing until he revealed it to his servants, the prophets. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then when he said that, it was 800 years before that ever come to pass. But it had to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Mary and Joseph probably didn't understand. We know that Joseph was uh actually wanting to put Mary away, but he wanted to do it in a private manner where it wouldn't cause a a a lot of contention on Mary's belief. Brother Brandham said, "So Joseph said, remember, you want to know why that the Lord came down amongst us last night like he did? It's because people was expecting." &gt;&gt; See, the prophet of God told us that that the Lord comes to those who are looking for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, God, help me to always be looking for him. &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells a story about how that they went to the synagogue and that how that maybe the uh the the uh the the priest or the the rabbi had had read from the scroll of Isaiah and they were meditating. You know, it's good for us. &gt;&gt; I listen to a lot of tapes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I draw strength from it. &gt;&gt; I listen to a lot of tapes because I draw healing from it. &gt;&gt; I listen to a lot of tapes because it gives me answers to things &gt;&gt; that sometimes aren't even my questions, but other people ask me. and you turn on a tape and the Lord open up something to you through what said you call up the brother and say, "Hey, I've got your answer. Listen to this tape." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, we're not only compelled to listen to the tape, but because we don't just need the knowledge of the word of God, but we are told to pray for revelation more than anything else. A lot of people will have a knowledge of the word and all they CAN DO IS GET DOWN WITH SOMEBODY and just fuss with them and and fight with them and and try and show what I know and what you don't know and what you don't know and what I don't know and &gt;&gt; and what does that benefit but a revelation of the word of God will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. So they were meditating on what they had heard. You ever done that, brother Juan? Just get up and preach something like the house is a fire and maybe you've even scratched down some notes on &gt;&gt; and you just go home. You know, he said, and you get to looking on that, I wonder what brother Brandham had to say about that. And you look, and brother Brandham is paraphrasing what brother Juan preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've seen it time after time. &gt;&gt; Hello. And you're sitting there meditating on Yeah. Yeah. And you know, they don't do it anymore, but it used to be that we read newspapers instead of our phone. And they had a comic strip in there. And when somebody uh uh got a revelation, they'd show a light bulb turning out &gt;&gt; and you know, the light just comes on for us in an area that had been darkness before. and all. OH YES, THAT explains this. That's the real Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I Maybe y'all don't have questions like this. &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; See, I want to know what it's going to be like over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I interrupt myself here for &gt;&gt; See, several years ago, I I under the excuse of taking the kids, &gt;&gt; the Blue Angels was about or not the Blue Angels, but the Thunderbirds was performing about 120 miles away down at Jacksonville, Arkansas. So, I took the kids down to see it. No, really. Daddy wanted to go and see it. And we went down and you know right at the end oh they showed us the sheer power of that F16 of how that they had one of them just rolling a little bit and you could see the heat waves coming out. You knew that the engine was fired up, but then it starts rolling and yet it it's big enough and it's far enough away that you can't tell it. But he's already at 250 miles an hour. &gt;&gt; And then he pops it up just about 10 foot off the ground. And the announcer says, "We will now show you the sheer power of this airplane." And he turns it and goes straight up with it &gt;&gt; until it's out of sight. But right at the end of after they'd shown how close that they could fly, oh, let me tell you something. What would it be if the church of the living God could just get wing tip to wing tip with the leader? And I'm not talking about the pastor. I'm talking about the leader. Just stay just keep watching him that far away from him. Oh Lord, HOW CLOSE CAN I GET? BUT I said stay THIS CLOSE. WE LOCK IN right there. &gt;&gt; And the whole church get in formation. &gt;&gt; Oh, THAT'S THAT'S WHEN SOMEBODY I CAN SEND MY SERVANT down to Bradam Tabernacle. I can send my servant down to Good Shepherd Fellowship. &gt;&gt; And I know that somebody IN MY HANDS THAT I can trust and something will happen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the very end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had five of them flying in a They called it the Delta Formation. The best that I remember. It's been 30, 40 years ago. And they turned and they went straight up and they was all trailing smoke. And four of them just split off like a banana people. There's one of them. He just kept going up. &gt;&gt; And he was spiraling till he went out of sight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We got back to the car and was headed home. &gt;&gt; I pulled over on the side of the road. I said, "You kids, I don't understand it all, but I know that one of these days we're going to travel like a thought." &gt;&gt; And I don't know if you can see a thought travel or not. &gt;&gt; But if you look up there and you see a thought going yang, yang, yang, yang, look up there and say, "Daddy's having a ball." &gt;&gt; I don't know what it's going to be like on the other side. But I know that it's glorious enough that I don't want to see anybody miss it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So Joseph said, "Well, my dear, would you go in and get one of the scrolls?" And she just by chance. She just by chance reached in and got word that the pastor had been preaching on this morning. just by chance. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There's some of the things that too many times we think that it's just by chance. Brother Juan was sharing with me that there was something that happened yesterday evening just before service of how that I came down here way too early and the door wasn't even unlocked when uh when brother Wesley and his wife and I showed up out here. But a sister came in a little bit long, a little bit later and she had the code and brother Wesley said, "Hey, you can go in." I said, "Well, I'm just going to stay out here in the truck for a little bit." But when it come time for me to come in, they still didn't have the code to the door. How many times have we heard the prophet of God tell of things that had happened? And he said, "Oh, wait." He said, "Then I remembered there's something written down about this." One time he'd had a vision of the the rock pillars at the end of his driveway. Yeah. That was made out of Bedford stone and they they had the a a guy out there just knocking them down. And brother Brandham in the vision or dream or whatever that it was went out to him and and and said, "Hey, what are you doing?" And the guy just told him to mind his own business. And he knocked him down. And he said, "You can't talk to me like that, sir." &gt;&gt; And a voice told him, "Avoid this. Go west." &gt;&gt; So then he he just he writes it down in the book. He didn't understand it. But then later on several years, here's a survey state and a man that he uh grew up with. They they used they called him mud ear when he was a kid cuz somebody hit him with a a a mudball and but later they just shortened it to mud. He said, "Hey, mud, what are you doing?" He was a city engineer for Jeffersonville. He said, "Billy, they're going to uh uh widen the road through here." That's what the stakes are about. He said, "Now, like your mailbox and those pillars out there," he said, "Don't do nothing. Don't worry about them. Uh they're going to hire contractors to move that back." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "Wait, there's something about this." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he goes and gets the boat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it was his instructions to go west. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham did not understand it. He said, "I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm moving out west to a place where they don't even have a church for me to take my family to. Don't ask me to explain that. I don't advise anybody to move where they ain't a Bible believing church that they can put their family in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; I tell somebody, you move to where you got a church that'll teach you the truth and nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We we I think we might ought to have preachers to start taking an oath about like they do on a witness stand. Uh, do you solemnly affirm to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or we could look at some of the other things where brother Brandham went in. He had a vision that that there was a hat laying in a certain place. He said, "Now, I couldn't move that hat." But he got in a hurry and he went ahead and prayed for the baby and the baby about died. He said, "Oh Lord, I did wrong." He went back and he just waited. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then mama come in, grandma. And then the hat got thrown in the chair. Now, everything was the same way that it was back here in the vision or the dream. But a sister right here had a dream that that there was a vision preacher that come into town and he needed to get into the pastor's office, but they didn't have the code for it. So, they was going to have to wait. and she got on the phone and she got the code and not even saying a word to me but just pointed towards the door that it was open. And then after it was over, she remembered the dream. &gt;&gt; Not not that we have to do something to set it into motion, but God has already spoke. &gt;&gt; So it's going to take place. And then when we come into it, we're said, "Oh, that's what this is." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham and praying for the little boy up there in Finland, how they went. He said, "There's something familiar about this." Then he turns to a brother said, "Brother said, look on the fly leaf of your Bible. Look, look at the mountains here. Look at the soldiers. Is this not the same?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the results of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Russian soldiers stand there and salute uh to their mortal enemies and hug them. &gt;&gt; Russians hugging fins &gt;&gt; and saying we'll serve a God like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. When people can see the real genuine in action, who wouldn't want to serve a God like that? &gt;&gt; Amen. But Joseph said, "My dear, would you go and get one of the scrolls?" And she just by chance reached in to get the scroll and brought it out. She said, "Well, dear, today seems like we read from the book of Isaiah." So she pulled open the scroll and Joseph began to read and his mind, his eyes fell upon this portion. A virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son. They shall call his name counselor, mighty God, the prince of peace, the everlasting father. And when he got down to the end of it, the little virgin lady sitting there by the side and said, "Just a moment, Joseph, dear, what does the prophet mean by a virgin conceiving?" Well, Jose might have said this, dear. That's just a little too deep. &gt;&gt; I do not understand it, &gt;&gt; but I believe it. &gt;&gt; It's just what the Bible said. I don't know how it will happen, but this I know, dear. &gt;&gt; We know that Isaiah was Jehovah's prophet. Therefore, being anointed with the Holy Spirit of God upon him, he could not prophesy wrong because he was born a prophet. And we know that his words are true. And when he said, "A virgin shall conceive." That was NOT ISAIAH. THAT WAS OUR JEHOVAH. And Jehovah is able to do anything that he says he will do. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do we understand it all? No. But do I believe it? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I don't have to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; God does. &gt;&gt; I think I told y'all about the time when I was down in old Mexico and we prayed for a whale. Ju just felt led to to get a couple five gallon buckets of water and pour it in the well. My interpreter was there with us and I asked him I I I said, "Broot, can you guide me back to that spring? It it was oh between a quarter and a half a mile away." And he he said, "Yeah." So I went and got the two buckets that the the brother you know how they got the pole with the two buckets y'all seen overseas many a time. And a boy said, "Oh, brother Farmer, let me go get a camera." And I said, "Son, we don't need a camera for this." And you know, Brother Sandy Beach was my interpreter. And when the Lord was doing something, he catch it just real quick. We'd gotten I not as far as that door. Brother Sandy was right by my side. He said, "Where are we going?" I said, "We're going to spring." Never asked another word. Well, here come the pastor from Monterey that that we was riding in his vehicle and that they told him we was going up there. Well, the brother we was staying with, you know, how some of these Mexican brothers are just about as wide as they are tall. Most of them are these Wasa Indians and that's we were up in the Wasakas, a rural area where a lot of this tribe of Indians uh lived and uh uh brother Rastro come out there and he's just built like a bull and as long as I was carrying empty buckets that was fine. But when I filled them full of water, he wanted to carry it &gt;&gt; and I said, "Brother, I need to do this." So they interpret it and and he let me do it. But I passed it back to the well. We poured in those two five gallon buckets of water, laid hands on a dry well. &gt;&gt; See, I'd asked I I said, "Why did we go to the spring when when there's a new well here?" I know what new concrete looks like. And he said, "Brother, they dug that well four months ago," he he said, "and it gave water for a couple of weeks and then it went dry." &gt;&gt; And you you you get feelings for people. You you know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; You look at people that they don't have nothing. They've got what looks like an extension cord that's run a a quarter of a mile up the side of the mountain. And then they've got a little wire like a little extension cord that comes down that has a light bulb and a socket so that they can play a tape in Spanish. &gt;&gt; Only thing they've got power for. &gt;&gt; I I I'll show you a picture of it after church. a little old a a hut that's made out of bamboo with mud packed in it. But I've never felt any more at home, any place that I've ever been. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just sat there with my back against the wall and they brought me an orange to eat. The juice was running down my elbow and and I thought, "Oh, God, they they don't have any resources." And yet they've they've bought the money for the cement and and they've dug that well and and now it's gone dry. And I was sitting there thinking on what I was going to preach that night and it was Elijah and the meal offering. &gt;&gt; Well, you remember Elijah took that meal and they told him said there's death in the pot. There was some poison gourds in it. &gt;&gt; But but he took that three cornered meal. He said, "Oh, that represented the Lord Jesus." that every piece of it was exactly the same size because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And now that he put it in there and he told them young prophets that it's okay to eat it now. &gt;&gt; And I sitting up there thinking on that when I got inspiration to to pour that water in the well. We did. We joined hands and laid hands on that well. It was about three months later that brother Australia from Monterey, Mexico was coming up into the states and now brother Sandy was interpreting from Spanish into English for us and and they called me up and I asked them to come and stay at the house. We had a a empty bedroom and and uh brother David had had told me to ask brother Estray to preach for us that night. It was on a Wednesday and uh he said he wouldn't. And he said, "Brother," he said, "I've got something all this through interpreter." He said, "I've got something I want to tell you, &gt;&gt; but I feel like I need to tell the whole church." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Okay." So that night he said, "Brother Farmer probably told you that we prayed for a well and uh a few people in the church remember it." You know, people that aren't missionary minded, sometimes they don't pay a lot of attention to what God's doing overseas. Well, let me tell you what. He's exactly the same Jehovah Gyra that he is right here as what he is in Liberia or Antonio in old Mexico or the Philippines. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we ought to rejoice just as much for them as we do for what we see him doing here. &gt;&gt; Well, there's a few though that they had remembered it. And he said, "I want you to know I've drank water from the well, but not only is the well given water, but it's running over the top, &gt;&gt; out of that testimony, &gt;&gt; there were seven churches that sprung up in that region from the testimony of what God had done." &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We went down there a couple years later and there was a a UPC preacher. He he was a fine old gentleman and he needed a ride. And so, uh, uh, Brother James Miller, give him a we took him with us and and, uh, when we went up into that village, all of the men were gone working, but the sisters came out and was preaching to this Pentecost preacher. &gt;&gt; And because he's UPC, he had to listen to them. &gt;&gt; God's got a sense of humor. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they were telling him, "Oh, the well went dry, but it was pouring over the top." The picture that I've got of that well is moss that's growing on a well that's only a year old because the water was running over it for weeks and weeks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why should I not expect a well to run over when my cup is running over? That's what he DOES FOR US. HE'LL DO IT for whatever if we'll just trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John baptizing in the river of Jordan and he had already he had been prophesying. He had been preaching. You know, actually the prophet of God said that a New Testament preacher was a prophet because he was fortelling. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make us more than what we are. I'm just telling you what a prophet said that we was. &gt;&gt; And I believe that we should be willing to accept that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; John had been preaching, there's one coming after me. I baptize you unto repentance in the river here, but there's one coming after me that when he comes, he's going to baptize you with fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who could understand that, &gt;&gt; John? Are you going to build Is he going to build a big fire and throw us into it? &gt;&gt; I don't know. But all I know is the spirit of God is telling me he's going to fill you up with fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, John, is it going to burn us? &gt;&gt; Oh, it'll burn the dross out of you. I don't know how it's going to happen. I'm just telling you, that's what the Lord's giving me. Yes. &gt;&gt; And then when he seen him come down to the river, his own second cousin &gt;&gt; and he seen him coming. But he saw more than a man coming &gt;&gt; because he seen a dove come down. &gt;&gt; And the very thing that the Lord had told him that that is the one that when you see THE SPIRIT OF GOD come down descending like a dove and it's willing to stay with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to flare off somewhere. Why? Because there is no wolf spirit in him to flare off that spirit of God. Oh God, help us to humble ourselves before the Lord that whenever he comes down, he's content to dwell with. &gt;&gt; Oh, nothing. We don't get in a hurry to run him off. &gt;&gt; John couldn't understand it when he said, "John, baptize me." And he said, "Me baptize you." &gt;&gt; No. I've been the one that's been preparing the way for you. &gt;&gt; I need baptized to you. &gt;&gt; But he just took him back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to a theology, not to an idea, not to an emotion, but he just took him back to the word and he said, "John, it becometh us &gt;&gt; to fulfill all right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And something with John, it made sense. &gt;&gt; If this one is the sacrifice, the sacrifice has to be bored. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I baptize. &gt;&gt; Did he understand it? No. But at the word of God, HE JUST DID IT. WHY? BECAUSE GOD HAD APPOINTED HIM. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; John didn't understand it all. Oh no. On the Easter Seal, Brother Brandham said, "Now, as the promised Messiah, he quickened every word that was prophesied that he would do to heal the sick, how he would be born of a virgin. All that made it true. He was the word manifested here on earth. But he could not do this just as a man. It taken the spirit of God dwelling in him to quicken those promises to him. &gt;&gt; Oh church, can we recognize the importance of the spirit of God &gt;&gt; dwelling on the inside of us. We don't just want to be baptized in the spirit, but we want the seal of the Holy Ghost upon our life. &gt;&gt; Oh, pardon me a second. &gt;&gt; I hope that we get this real clear. Now, Jesus being a man himself, the body, but it took the spirit in him, the spirit. It's not me that doeth the works, but it's my father that dwelleth in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one that does the works. See, Jesus himself was the word because he was before God. This is a bad word to use. I hope you take it right before a crowd. But he was predestinated by the fornowledge of God. How God's plan was to be that he would send a redeemer and this redeemer could only be his own son. And then that was God's promise all the way from the Garden of Eden that Jesus would be here. Here he was as a man born of a virgin. But it taken the spirit of God to quicken that word to him. And he was the word quicken. The word quickened for that hour. &gt;&gt; The time had come when you had to have a redeemer. The law had failed. Other things had failed. Now it takes a redeemer. And he was the promised redeemer. He was quickened by the word of God. And now it's that same spirit that was upon him to be the redeemer in that age &gt;&gt; that we have accepted now the promise that in this last days what would take place if you become part of that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are redeemed &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are redeemed with him because the same spirit that dwelt in Christ is dwelling in you, quickening your life to this age. And it'll also in the end time quicken your mortal bodies, resurrect them, bring them up again. It takes that gloom away when we look at it in that and that's the truth. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; would it be okay if I could just do something here for a second? On Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I would read you what brother Brandham said. He was anointed into the wilderness after 40 days AND DEFEATED SATAN BY the word of God. What did he do? He broke any divine promise and reached out the wicest of Christians. IF HE WAS GOD, WHY DID HE LET SATAN SAY, "IF thou be the son of God, perform a miracle here and show me you can do it. Turn these stones into bread and eat." He said, "It is written, man shall not live by bread alone." So then as Satan always tries to coat the word went back and told him when he put him at the pinnacle of the temple AND HE'S HERE AGAIN IT is written and he defeated Satan on the word of God &gt;&gt; that shows that you can defeat Satan on the word of God. &gt;&gt; No matter the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any conditions. If it's in THE BELLY OF A WHALE, OR IF IT'S IN A LION'S DEN, if it's on the BED WITH A CANCER, OR IF IT'S LAYING DOWN OR BLEEDING TO DEATH IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT, THE WORD OF GOD WILL DEFEAT SATAN ANYWHERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And the weakest Christian can use it. &gt;&gt; And the weakest Christian, &gt;&gt; can use it. Are you within reach of that bottle? You Every divine promise &gt;&gt; you're in reach of it, sis. You too, buddy. Let me tell you something. Even the little children came up and they could grab. Sometimes it's easier for you little children to grab a hold of it than some of us adults because we've had too much experience. But it's been experienced the wrong way. But you are within reach, sweetheart, &gt;&gt; of every divine promise that God has made. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to be the be the deacon. You don't have to be the one running the sound system. But every one of us is within reach &gt;&gt; of every promise of God. Every divine promise, sister, you've got a right to take a hold of it. You see what I'm doing? It's not about the bottle. &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to put a face &gt;&gt; on the promise of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hand it back there and let him. And you've got a right as a son and daughter of God. Take that bottle home with you. It ain't a bottle. It ain't a prayer cloth. &gt;&gt; It's the God &gt;&gt; that we're trusting in. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't ever put your your confidence in, oh, if if this brother prays for me, if that brother lays hands on me, if that sister takes my my name into her prayer closet. No, our confidence is in the Lord. We don't defeat the enemy with a water bottle or with a prayer cloth. We defeat the enemy with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. that God's word can never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's here for us. &gt;&gt; It's here for us because God had a plan. And God's plan, I know we're going to a place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come up if they would. We're going to a place where there's not going to be any more sorrow. &gt;&gt; We sing a song. I'm going to a city where the roses never fade. &gt;&gt; Oh, here they bloom but for a season. Of course, right now when it's just fixing to be b bear trees, but they're the prettiest that they'll be all year long right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, them maples are gorgeous out here. I saved some of them on the way in. &gt;&gt; But you know what? We It's not going to take death. &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be some of us that are alive and remain &gt;&gt; and we're not going to hinder those that have already gone on before. But we're going to rise and meet them. &gt;&gt; They'll come up first and we're going to come right up with them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How beautiful the heaven must be. Sweet home of the high and free. &gt;&gt; It's a sweet heaven of rest for the river. Oh, how beautiful heaven must be. Amen. I don't know if I remembered it all or not. Why don't y'all just stand up with me for a minute? I hope that everybody's heart got cleared out last night. If there's anybody here with us this morning that you know that you are not in sync with the Lord Jesus, just why don't you just confess it to him and turn it all over to him &gt;&gt; because there's something I want you to know that I've got. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do I have pain sometimes? Yeah, I do. But you know what I've got? I've got something. Do y'all have that song? It is joy unspeakable. &gt;&gt; If y'all pull it up for me because as a musician a lot of times I remember the chords better than I remember the words. Oh, it is joy unspeakable glory of glory.
