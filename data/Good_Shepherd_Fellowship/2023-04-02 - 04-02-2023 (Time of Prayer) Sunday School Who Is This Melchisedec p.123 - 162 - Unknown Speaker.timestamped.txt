[0:57] he come in three names of a son the son
[1:02] of man
[1:03] Son of God the son of David when he was
[1:06] shared on Earth he was a man to fulfill
[1:09] the scripture Moses said the Lord your
[1:12] God shall raise up a prophet like an
[1:14] unto me
[1:16] so he had to come as a prophet he didn't
[1:20] never say I am the Son of God he said I
[1:24] am the son of man
[1:25] do you believe the son of man because
[1:27] that's what he had to testify of because
[1:30] that's what he was
[1:32] now he's come in another son's name Son
[1:34] of God the Unseen the spirit and when he
[1:38] comes again he's son of David is set up
[1:39] on his throne
[1:41] now when he would share and was made
[1:43] flesh he was called the son of man now
[1:48] how did he make himself known to the
[1:51] world as son of man
[1:55] the prophet
[1:58] one day as told a story
[2:01] of Peter
[2:03] and Andrew's brother
[2:05] they were fishermen
[2:07] and their father Jonas was a great old
[2:11] believer one day he said he sat down on
[2:14] the side of the boat
[2:16] he said Sons you know how we prayed when
[2:19] we needed fish there's commercial
[2:21] fishermen
[2:22] he said we've trusted god Jehovah or our
[2:26] living
[2:27] now I'm getting old now I can't stay
[2:29] with you boys much longer
[2:31] and I've always as all True Believers
[2:34] have looked for the time when that
[2:35] Messiah will come
[2:38] we've got all kinds of forces but
[2:40] there's coming a real one someday
[2:42] and he said when this Messiah comes I
[2:45] don't want you boys to be deceived
[2:47] this Messiah will not be just a
[2:50] theologian
[2:51] he will be a prophet
[2:54] for our Prophet Moses of who we follow
[2:58] he said now any Jew will be these
[3:01] Prophet he's taught to know that you
[3:04] know if the prophet says anything it's
[3:05] so then that's truth but God said if
[3:07] there be one among you spiritual or
[3:09] Prophet how the Lord will make myself
[3:10] known to him and what he says comes to
[3:12] pass and hear him in theory but if it
[3:15] don't then don't fear him at all see
[3:17] so that was a the Vindication of the
[3:20] prophet so Moses was truly a Vindicated
[3:23] prophet and he said the Lord your God
[3:26] shall raise up among you
[3:28] out of your brethren a prophet likened
[3:31] to me and all it won't hear him will be
[3:33] cut off from the people
[3:34] he said now children remember
[3:36] that is Hebrews We Believe God's
[3:40] Vindicated prophets now listen close
[3:43] don't miss it
[3:45] and he said when the Messiah comes
[3:48] you'll know him for he will be a prophet
[3:51] Messiah I said it's been 400 years
[3:55] we haven't had a prophet since Malachi
[3:58] but he'll be
[3:59] one day
[4:01] after his death a few years
[4:05] his son Andrew was strolling along down
[4:08] the bank and he heard a wild man out of
[4:11] the Wilderness saying that messiah's
[4:14] standing among you now
[4:16] that big eagle it raised up over the
[4:18] Wilderness and flew over there said the
[4:20] messiah's among you right now we don't
[4:23] know him yet but he's standing among you
[4:25] I don't know him because I see a sign
[4:27] coming from heaven
[4:29] one day he said there behold is the Lamb
[4:33] of God that takes away the sin of the
[4:34] world
[4:35] away with the witness man to find his
[4:39] brother said Simon I want you to come
[4:41] over here we've done found the Messiah
[4:44] oh go on Andrew you know better than
[4:47] that all I know but that this man is
[4:49] different where is he where'd he come
[4:52] from Jesus of Nazareth that little
[4:54] Wicked City well he couldn't come from a
[4:57] wicked dirty place like that you just
[4:59] come and see finally persuade him to
[5:01] come down one day
[5:03] so when you come in the front of this
[5:04] Messiah Jesus standing there speaking to
[5:07] the people when he walked up in front of
[5:08] me said your name is Simon
[5:12] and you are the son of Jonas
[5:15] that did it
[5:19] he got the keys to the kingdom
[5:21] why
[5:23] he know that that man did not know him
[5:28] and how did he know him and that by the
[5:30] old fatherhood taught him how to believe
[5:32] the Messiah
[5:34] there was a man standing there by the
[5:36] name of Philip
[5:37] oh he got really excited he knows
[5:40] another man had been studying the Bible
[5:41] with a way he went around the hill and
[5:43] he found him out there in his uh Olive
[5:46] Grove he was kneeling down praying that
[5:49] had lots of Bible lessons together so
[5:51] he'd come out there and he said and
[5:53] you've got to pray he said
[5:55] um
[5:56] come see who we found
[5:58] Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph he's
[6:02] the Messiah we're looking for it now I
[6:04] can hear Nathaniel say now Philip you
[6:06] ain't went off on the deep end are you
[6:08] oh no no
[6:09] now let me tell you you know we've been
[6:12] studying the Bible together and what did
[6:14] the prophet say the Messiah would be and
[6:15] be a prophet you remember that old
[6:17] Fishman you bought the fish from it
[6:19] didn't have enough education to sign his
[6:20] name call Simon yep
[6:23] he come up and you know what this Jesus
[6:26] of Nazareth told him that his name was
[6:28] Simon changed his name to Peter which is
[6:31] little Stone and told him who his daddy
[6:33] was
[6:35] well they said he said I don't know
[6:38] could anything good come out of Nazareth
[6:40] he said let's not talk about it just
[6:41] come on and see that's a good idea Come
[6:44] and sing so here come Philip bringing up
[6:47] Nathaniel and but he got walking up
[6:50] Jesus probably standing speaking
[6:51] probably praying for the sick of the
[6:53] prayer line and when he come up to where
[6:56] Jesus was Jesus looked around at him and
[6:58] said behold an Israelite in whom there's
[6:59] no God
[7:02] now you say well his ways dressed oh no
[7:04] all easterners dressed the same
[7:07] he could have been a Syrian or been
[7:08] anything else
[7:09] beard garment he said behold in
[7:12] Israelite and whom there's no God and
[7:14] otherwise an honest sincere man
[7:17] well that kind of deflated Nathaniel And
[7:19] he said Rabbi which means teacher Rabbi
[7:23] when did you ever know me how did you
[7:27] know I was a Jew
[7:28] how did you know I was honest no God he
[7:32] said before Philip called you when you
[7:34] were under the tree I saw you David
[7:39] 15 miles away the other side of the
[7:42] country the day before what did he say
[7:44] rabba
[7:46] or the son of God
[7:49] you are the king of Israel
[7:51] there should those priests there
[7:53] self-style self-starts said this man is
[7:56] beelzeba of a fortune teller
[7:59] Jesus said I'll forgive you remember
[8:01] they never said it out loud but they
[8:04] said it in their hearts and he perceived
[8:06] their thoughts
[8:08] that's right
[8:10] it's what the Bible says
[8:12] call it telepathy if you want to but he
[8:15] he perceived their thoughts and he said
[8:18] I forgive you for that but someday the
[8:22] Holy Ghost is going to come and do the
[8:24] same thing Andrew he's going speak a
[8:26] word against it will never be forgiven
[8:28] in this world of world will come is that
[8:30] right
[8:31] oh that were Jews
[8:33] then one day he had need to go to
[8:37] Samaria but just before we do that we
[8:40] found the woman or the the man as he
[8:44] went through the gate called Beautiful
[8:47] that he was healed and Jesus not his
[8:49] condition and told him take up your bed
[8:51] and go on home and he did it he got well
[8:55] then we find out the Jews some of them
[8:58] received him some believe it some didn't
[9:00] why did they believe it it was not
[9:03] ordained to lie it wasn't part of that
[9:06] attribute
[9:07] I remember them were a priest and great
[9:09] man and Jesus think of those theologians
[9:12] and Priests
[9:14] man that you couldn't find a flaw in
[9:16] their life Jesus said you are of your
[9:19] father the devil
[9:21] and his words you do
[9:22] said if you'd be of God you'd believe me
[9:24] if you can't believe me be Don't Believe
[9:26] The Works that I do they testify who I
[9:29] am
[9:31] now
[9:32] the Bible said that Jesus is the same
[9:34] yesterday today and forever
[9:37] Jesus said the works that I do shall he
[9:40] that believeth on me do also
[9:43] is that right
[9:45] notice that was the real Melchizedek now
[9:48] notice again there was only three races
[9:52] of people
[9:54] you heard me say I was a segregationist
[9:56] I am all Christians or segregations
[9:58] that's segregation of color
[10:01] but segregation of spirit
[10:04] a man's color of his skin has nothing to
[10:06] do with him he's a child of God by birth
[10:10] but a Christian God said separate me
[10:12] come out from among them and so forth he
[10:14] is a segregationist a filth between
[10:17] right and wrong
[10:19] but notice
[10:21] they had a segregation and a racial
[10:23] segregation which was the Samaritans and
[10:26] there's only three races of people on
[10:28] the Earth if we believe the Bible
[10:31] that is ham sham and japer's people
[10:34] that's the three sons of Noah we all
[10:36] sprung from there
[10:38] right
[10:39] that makes us all back from Adam which
[10:41] makes us all Brothers
[10:43] the Bible said of one blood God created
[10:46] All Nations
[10:48] we're all Brothers
[10:51] to the bloodstream a colored man to give
[10:54] a white man a blood transfusion or vice
[10:56] versa now a white man can give the
[10:58] Japanese Yellowman or the Indian the red
[11:01] man or what more
[11:05] or whatever he could give him a blood
[11:07] transfusion cause we're all the same
[11:09] blood
[11:10] the color of her skin where we live had
[11:12] nothing to do with it but when we're
[11:14] segregating it's when we come out of the
[11:17] world like he brought Israel up out of
[11:20] Egypt that's when we're segregated from
[11:22] the things of the world
[11:24] now
[11:25] there was a ham sandwich people and if
[11:29] we had time to run the genealogies back
[11:31] you could see the Anglo-Saxon where he
[11:33] come from now that was that you
[11:36] the Samaritan which was packed you and
[11:38] Gentile that married in with the
[11:40] Gentiles at balaams Dunes
[11:45] and Moab they were Samaritans and there
[11:50] was Jews and Gentiles now we angle Saxon
[11:54] had nothing to do with any of it we
[11:56] didn't believe in him a sign or nothing
[11:58] else we wasn't looking for one amen we
[12:00] were brought in afterwards
[12:02] Jesus came to his own
[12:05] and his own received enough and he said
[12:08] to his disciples don't go in the way of
[12:10] the Gentiles but go rather to the lost
[12:11] sheep of Israel
[12:13] and he went only
[12:15] to the lost sheep of Israel and watch he
[12:19] manifested himself as son of man before
[12:21] the Jews they turned it down now the
[12:25] Samaritan being half Jew and Gentile
[12:27] they believed also and was looking for a
[12:30] messiah we wasn't we were heathens with
[12:32] clubs on her back worshiping Idols the
[12:35] Gentiles but now one day Saint John 4 he
[12:39] had need to go by Samaria on his road
[12:42] down to Jericho but was went up around
[12:45] Samaria and while he was going up there
[12:47] he sat down on the whale outside of a
[12:50] city called Sidecar
[12:52] and the will if you've ever been there
[12:54] it's a little panoramic not like this
[12:56] year it is a public sprang hair of water
[12:58] where they all come into women come over
[13:01] morning get their pots of water and put
[13:02] it on their head and one on each ship
[13:03] and walk with it just as straight as can
[13:05] be never spill a drop talk to one
[13:07] another so they were their people come
[13:10] out there so this is about 11 o'clock
[13:11] today so he sent his disciples into the
[13:14] city to buy some biddles
[13:18] boom and while they were gone there was
[13:21] a woman which was ill-famed
[13:24] oh we'd call her today a red light woman
[13:26] or prostitute she had too many husbands
[13:30] so while Jesus is sitting there this
[13:32] woman come out about 11 o'clock see she
[13:34] couldn't come with the virgins when they
[13:37] come in the mornings you get their wash
[13:38] water she had to wait till they all they
[13:40] didn't mix like to do now
[13:42] she was marked so then she'd come out to
[13:45] get some water so she just took the old
[13:48] window and put the hooks over the jar
[13:50] and started to let it down she heard
[13:52] somebody say woman
[13:54] bring me a drink
[13:56] now remember this is Melchizedek this is
[13:59] Jesus yesterday
[14:01] the son of man
[14:03] and she looked around and she saw a Jew
[14:07] so she said
[14:08] uh sir it's not proper for a Jew to ask
[14:13] the Samaritan for anything I'm a woman
[14:15] of Samara so you have spoken out of your
[14:17] place you should have asked me such a
[14:19] thing as that we have no dealings with
[14:21] one another he said but if you knew who
[14:23] was talking to you
[14:24] you'd ask me for a drink she said are
[14:26] you going to draw it the whales didn't
[14:28] you have nothing to draw with he said
[14:29] the water I give is Water of Life
[14:31] springing up in the eternal life
[14:33] he talked to her until he found what her
[14:36] condition was and then thought watch
[14:38] what he said to her now
[14:40] go get your husband and come here
[14:44] and she said I have no husband
[14:47] he said you've said the truth
[14:49] for you've had five and the one you now
[14:52] are living with is not yours so in this
[14:55] you said the truth what's the difference
[14:57] between that woman and that bunch of
[14:58] priests
[15:00] she know more about God and that whole
[15:02] bunch of priests did put together
[15:04] she said sir
[15:07] I perceive that you are a prophet
[15:10] she said we haven't had one for 400
[15:12] years
[15:13] now we know that the Messiah is coming
[15:15] and when the Messiah comes that's what
[15:18] he's going to do
[15:20] that was a sign of the Messiah
[15:23] for he was the son of man amen
[15:26] said that's what he's going to do when
[15:28] he comes you must be his prophet he said
[15:31] I am he
[15:34] nobody else could say that
[15:36] she dropped that water pot and run into
[15:39] the City and said come see a man who
[15:41] told me what I'd done
[15:43] isn't this the very Messiah
[15:46] now remember
[15:48] he promised to do that same thing
[15:51] at the end of the Gentile race
[15:54] the Jews had had four thousand years
[15:58] to look for that Messiah
[16:00] 4 000 years of teaching he was coming
[16:03] and what he would do when he got there
[16:04] and they failed a scene or fail to
[16:06] recognize it
[16:08] and when he made himself known in the
[16:10] very Bible terms that he said he would
[16:12] when he'd been a theophany and then
[16:14] become flesh and dwelt among them
[16:17] they failed to sin and called his works
[16:20] the works of the devil
[16:23] now we've had 2 000 years of teaching
[16:26] coming down to the Roman Catholic church
[16:28] and to the apostles then we come down to
[16:30] the Roman Catholic the Greek and so
[16:32] forth on down to Luther's age and Wesley
[16:34] what more 900 different organizations
[16:37] coming down had all these ages teaching
[16:40] now he promised just before the end time
[16:43] would come that this picture of Sodom
[16:46] and Gomorrah would again as it was in
[16:49] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[16:51] coming of the end time the son of man
[16:55] will reveal himself again yet a little
[16:58] while and the world won't see me no more
[17:01] yet
[17:04] a personal pronoun I will be with you
[17:08] even in you to the consummation the end
[17:11] of the world
[17:12] I'll be with you he's the same yesterday
[17:15] today and forever
[17:19] you see
[17:21] you see
[17:22] the Samaritan was actually from my last
[17:26] night's sermon was agar
[17:29] see a perverted type the Jew was staring
[17:33] up or was saronite but the Gentile is of
[17:37] Mary the Royal Sea Abraham's Royal seat
[17:40] now it's promised that in these last
[17:42] days that this same God
[17:47] the same Christ
[17:49] would come back here and reveal himself
[17:52] as son of man why he's the same
[17:55] yesterday and forever and if he let
[17:57] those Jews go by with and give them that
[18:01] Messiah sign
[18:03] and then come to the end of the Gentiles
[18:05] teaching and let them this going on
[18:07] theology he would be unjust
[18:10] he's got to do the same thing because
[18:13] the Bible said in third Hebrews 13 8 he
[18:16] is the same
[18:17] and he's promised in Malachi 4 and all
[18:20] the different scriptures that the last
[18:22] days the church would be setting just
[18:25] exactly like it is today and the world
[18:27] would be
[18:28] look at the world today
[18:30] look at the Sovereign condition
[18:32] look at the earthquakes and diverse
[18:35] places and the things has taken place
[18:36] look at the church in the message in a
[18:39] Babylon
[18:40] look at the messenger to it on Oral
[18:43] Roberts and a Billy Graham
[18:46] g-r-a-h-a-m first time we ever had a
[18:48] messenger to all the churches that his
[18:50] hat name ever end in ham like Abraham a
[18:54] b-r-a-h-a-m is seven letters
[18:57] g-r-a-h-a-m is six letters
[19:02] where's he at to the world six is man's
[19:04] number Man was created on the sixth
[19:06] eight but seven is God's number amen
[19:09] now look at them down there and
[19:12] slaughter them and there is their
[19:14] Messengers down there speaking to him
[19:16] amen
[19:17] amen but then where's that Royal seat of
[19:20] Abraham
[19:20] [Music]
[19:22] where is their sign that he said I said
[19:25] wow
[19:27] that God came down
[19:31] and was manifested in human flesh and
[19:35] told what Sarah was thinking back in her
[19:37] heart in a tent behind him the last sign
[19:40] before the Gentile world was destroyed
[19:42] by fire Hallelujah
[19:44] and the church has got its last time
[19:46] before the whole world is going to be
[19:48] destroyed this Gentile Kingdom be
[19:51] destroyed by the firing wrath of God
[19:54] you believe that
[19:56] that Melchizedek was flashing represent
[20:00] himself in a human body
[20:03] and then later he was made flesh
[20:06] and now tonight he's the same yesterday
[20:09] today and forever do you believe it
[20:13] who is this Melchizedek then
[20:15] that's his name yesterday I've never had
[20:18] no father never had no mother
[20:20] he never had no beginning of days he
[20:23] never had any in the life
[20:25] and he met Abraham and what kind of sign
[20:28] did he perform
[20:29] then when he was made flesh he said it
[20:31] would repeat again just before the end
[20:33] time
[20:34] you believe that
[20:37] I believe it
[20:39] let's pray
[20:44] [Music]
[21:00] [Music]
