of a broken heart and and save such as be of a contra spirit what a way to come before god in prayer tonight with a broken heart amen a broken head means a humbling heart praise the lord we are born

it to any of the deacons and she she just went in a seat so we were testifying about that that that lady testimony you know uh that said uh just call him father you know i dared to call him father that was the that was the book we were testifying on so she said she felt inspired to speak to god as her father prayed for her granddaughter and when she got home she got a word back that the granddaughter was well praise the lord but it seems to be that the the summer ache went from the granddaughter to her to the mother so the mother was in social pain and she just reminded the mother

right after this prayer session praise the lord you know i was i was i was uh thinking about that uh you know years back the lord kind of helped me to be able to see that in the world you know uh actually uh we all preachers of the message all we do we just come and testify you know of of what of what the prophet said we don't have a message of our own that's all we do you know we just come to testify same message we just gave a different different topic because that's that's where our inspiration is driving from you know so you know most of the time when i tell the brothers to testify you know they uh is is uh it could be something personal of their self it could be also something from the word praise the lord so but dan will bring us a testimony tonight let's just stand on our feet god is good let's sing that to the lord tonight praise the lord and uh brother isaiah brooks wanted me to send greetings to us tonight from des moines but a prayer will be down there preaching for him this weekend so he asks that we pray for them god is good all the time before the son of bridge in this eye don't mind god is good all the time [Music] oh god is good all [Music] god is good all the time [Music] better than you come up oh yeah our god is good [Music] god is good [Music] while we are still standing let's just say a word of prayer our most gracious and eternal father we thank thee once again for this opportunity that we have come we have had to come before thee for every opportunity before you is a special moment we thank you so very much dear lord jesus for your goodness and your grace your love and your mercies for there is nothing in this world that can take us away from your love we thank you for the good works you have started in us for we know without any shadow of doubt that will turn out good we are so very much grateful for tonight and for the time we have to spend before you we have driven far and near to come and worship and in return have you speak to us in any way it pleases tonight may you come and touch every heart lord touch every soul and quicken your word or god into our souls and let our name be honored in jesus name father we pray we're transgender amen shall we be seated god bless your saints i had a very very rough two days when i spoke with brother one on monday right away a message came into mind and i said no it's too long for a wednesday night so let me look for something that would complement the time so i right away i got another substitute and i was sure that was the message all through the night i thought about it went to work yesterday in the morning and then it happened it wasn't the message something else came in i said okay this is good our setting that was it this time preparation around 1 1 30 in the afternoon yesterday it changed again i got down i got another message driving home after work i realized no that wasn't the message only to realize that the first message that came to me and i said it was too long was the message i was coming to talk about tonight and i spent time preparing of course we never put our hopes in our preparation and then i went to bed around around 11 last night went to work this morning had my notes to get them on the computer i did the first one on my lunch break came the second time and i realized the notes were gone not knowing when i came on break and i was leaving i had a paper towel in my hands and i heard the notes and i dumped all in the trash so that was very very interesting so i was thinking about it i said no thank god even without a nose by the grace of god we'll have service tonight but praise be to his holy name that i have a bit of it here the devil did not take all away i think just because i was coming to talk a little about him he wasn't happy and he wanted to come in the way but by the grace of god we are going to see what god has for us tonight and i hope we are prayed up praise be to god now the prophet preached a message which we are all conversant with and he titled it the greatest battle ever fought now there are three scriptures here because of time i think i'll probably take only one and then the next two you can read them at your own time if you can please take your bibles and turn over to first peter 5 first peter 5 8 to 10. first peter 5 8 to 10 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion what if about seeking whom he may devolve whom resist steadfastly in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world by the word of all grace by the god of all grace who have called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you praise be to god you can be seated next scriptures are ephesians 6 10 to 17 daniel 12 1-14 you can write that down and then at your own time go through it praise be to god [Music] now what i want to say in starting this message is that we are not at the mercy of the devil it is the devil who is at our mercy the devil has no control over the life of any child of god amen we have been given authority over the devil and if we know who we are and we take our stand in god and we stay our course we can put the devil to flight every single moment we can cause the devil to put his tail in between his legs and you have no place to stand normally we allow fear to dominate our lives we allow fear to take over and the devil oppressed so much by fear so once fear comes in you lose control praise be to god the greatest battle ever fought now growing up we learned in our history lessons and we read about some of these battles the world war one that was fought within a period of four years 1914-1918 and we also read about the second world war which lasted longer and tens of millions of people lost their lives all these battles put together were the bloodiest battle that man fought they lost count of how many people lost their lives in these battles so normally they would estimate it so you never get an accurate figure and all the two was put together close to 100 million people lost their lives in the battle soldiers civilians mothers children there was no count to it and you would look at it and say oh that was probably the greatest battle that was ever fought and then also you think about in the dark ages that tens of millions of christians that lost their lives what happened in the dark ages was a war against christianity and they lost count of how many people died record has it that close a hundred million people lost their lives we can talk about the holocaust 60 million people died and there are other ones we can talk about that we know happening around us here the american vietnam war in africa we have a lot i mean and you can tell that all these depending on how you look at it you can justify why maybe one or two of them could be the greatest battle that man ever fought they were very very bloody and then you come to think about it that the prophet of god comes on the scene and then he says the greatest battle that was ever fought was not any of these when you take any of these barrels they had a start time and they had an end time i don't care how long the battle lasted there was a time it started there was a time it ended but there was one battle that started in heaven and all through humanity all through the history of man the battle is still raging on amen and again when you want to look at the number of people who lost their lives and then you use that as the pointer to determine which was the bloodiest and which was the greatest barrier that was ever fought you are still going to get it wrong we can say that in the first and the second world war about a hundred million people died so that was bloody in the dark ages about a hundred million people died that was bloody in the holocaust 60 million people that was bloody but when you put all these wars together you realize that they don't come anywhere close because just imagine what people call death we know is sleep anything that has a physical the spiritual side is by far more superior than the physical side so when you look at people physically losing their lives and you compare that to people that are spiritually losing their lives on a daily basis in billions you realize that all the walls that man fought and all the loss of lives do not come anywhere close to the spiritual death that has plagued the earth the greatest barrel ever fought now the bible says that there was war in heaven between michael and his angels and lucifer and his angels why because lucifer wanted to pitch his throne above the throne of god and he was cast down he was defeated he was cast down there was no place left for him in heaven anymore now when the devil came he had an avowed ambition to turn the hearts of every child of god against god you don't know what you have we can see that in the life of job a man that god himself boasted about that the devil rose against him and what was the purpose of the devil to turn his heart against god so he could cast god praise the lord and the devil never stopped there so the devil has an about ambition so you realize that the world that was a war of angels has not become a wall of men amen the war that was fought by angels human beings are now fighting the battle it's one thing when you are in the ring with your opponent and you can see him physically and you are dishing the blouse and he is dishing the blows you know when you are getting him you know when he is weak you know when you are on top but it's another thing when you are fighting an opponent you don't see that is where we find ourselves that the enemy we are fighting we don't see him with his fiscal eyes but christ to god but by eyes of faith we know when he's around we know his moves praise be to god amen amen so we are fighting a wall that was once fought by angels now what is going on here there are two powers that are staked the power of god and the power of satan now brother brother said the satan's power is perverted it's a perverted power it's god who has the real power satan only takes what god has made and then he prevents it there is nothing he can create he is a perverter yes that is why when you see people that think they have it all in the world and they live a life and they say they are enjoying their joy they have it's a perverted joy yes that's right never crave for anything of this world as a matter of fact if there was no heaven it would still be better to live a good christian life and die and go ahead and go to hell if there was no heaven by all standards living a good christian life is very rewarding there is nothing out there i can tell you from my personal experience that there is nothing out there the devil will make things look so flashy so flamboyant so promising and you think that you are losing something in being in the economy of god when you leave the economy of god and you enter in there that is when you know that oh after all there was nothing there you never know what you have until you have lost it in northern ghana where i lived for probably i don't know how many years i have no time to check that one time i was going somewhere with my brother and there were two mad men here in america you don't see those things the mad men they give them medicines to calm them down so they don't get dangerous until they get the guns before people know that no these are dangerous human beings praise be to god but back where i come from you see them from a distance you know that oh no there is something wrong upstairs with this person and by the way they dress and as one was coming down the hill another one was climbing the hill that was a normal scene for us it was nothing new one was stuck naked the other the other one had clothes very tired dirty of course you don't expect it to be clean now as they came close and they were passing by each other what they they just for for whatever reason they just stand and they were looking at themselves and then the one that was clothed half clothes took his clothes off he wanted to be like the one that was naked not knowing that the naked one also admired him for wearing the clothes so when he took down the clothes and was going the one that was naked came and took the clothes and wore it and then he turned back and saw that no that guy looks better than him so now he went after his clothes two madman fighting who was going to separate them that was why we left we didn't know how it ended so you know what there are people around you who would look at your life and they envy your good christian life the life you are living and they wish they could live that type of life and they are not able and they will try to talk you into things and you will think that they are enjoying they are regretting if they are regretting where they are if they will be true and sincere they will tell you how they are suffering and if the grace of god does not help you you want to be like them as soon as you type your foot there then the devil opens your eyes and then you see what you have lost there is nothing worth trying in the world there is absolutely not wait there is nothing worth dying for in the world amen amen the world we are living in is dying is dying why would you want to live in a world like this it's corrupt there is nothing good that act for you absolutely not be happy who you are rejoice as a good christian brother as a good christian sister praise god for who you are it may look like this are not good it may look like you are suffering praise be to god look if we have to suffer for a while amen if we have to suffer for a while die poor and wretched in this life and have peace with god is the best a man can have there is nothing out there they may look flashy they may look attractive it's nothing but depth when a fisherman goes to fish he has a hook the hook is starting by death and then he puts a bait on the hook and most of the times the bait is far less expensive than the hook just to attract you to it and in the end it would cost you your life there are a lot of baits around praise be to god it looks like i'm getting away from my message i don't intend to finish it because i knew i was not going to finish praise be to god so i'm not going to finish anything and all the course i had i didn't find them anymore but praise be to god we are going to have service tonight the greatest battle ever fought so there are two powers that are at stake the one to whom you yield yourself dominates your life he works through you and he works with you the power of god and the power of satan now when the fall took place man lost his estate and from that time on this bath is condemned this bed that is why a man must be born again you must it's not when you feel like it you must be born again because this break is condemned the bible says in sin did my mother conceive me and in iniquity was i shaping come to the world telling lies you don't have to commit the first sin to be a sinner you come right into this world a sinner that is who you are at birth you can't help it you don't have to tell the first line i remember when i was a child my dad was a soldier and my mom was selling a petition that is screen juice but andrew knows what i'm talking about you guys wouldn't know it but you can vodka vodka is just the equivalent of what i'm talking about and i will see people come in they will just come and then pour some on the floor and then strike a match to it and it will catch fire they say oh this is good this is good and they will drink and they'll squeeze their face and they'll knock their chests and i was wondering what is going on one day my mother left i don't know where she went before she came back i just went for the bottle i don't know how much i drank i was lying on one side the bottle was lying on one side when my mother came in and said oh i have killed my son she thought i was dead that was the last time she ever sold drink praise be to god you don't teach those things you do them because that is who you are at best you couldn't help it and my father would send me to go and buy drink and when i buy the drink i would just lift it up and look at the level and i'll scale it down and i bring it the rest to him he was sharing the drink you don't teach a child how to steal i remember i would enter this kitchen and we still meet sometimes i'll be there and i hear somebody's walking in and i'll put that hot meat in my pocket and as they are coming in i'm jumping out you can't help those things that is who you are at best yes now it's amazing it's amazing that god by his wisdom deposited the gem of life in your soul man is a triangle as the prophet said in this message he changed the position of the spirit and the soul back in other messages he corrected it he came and he said the soul the soul is actually in the inner core the spirit and the flesh so that's i mean it's something i think we all know so i'm not going to go into that now the seed of life god puts that seed of life in your soul and that seed is lying there dormant there is life in that seed there is every season there are seasons in god in our work with god there are seasons and that seed is lying there waiting for its spiritual rain and sunshine there is life in it it's like when a farmer plants a seed in the soil there is life in the seed the seed is flying there is covered by the earth it is covered by darkness the earth has no control over it that darkness has no control over it as the seed is lying there is just waiting for rain and sunshine and as soon as the rain and sunshine comes and the right atmosphere is created it begins to germinate and once it starts germinating nothing stops it it will begin to grow it will flourish it will bear fruit and people will taste of it or eat of it that is the same with our work with god that the seed of life is there it doesn't matter what we do that seed can never be defiled it can never be defiled the devil will carry you the furthest he can but that representation of god in you would bring you back where you belong amen praise be to god so the devil comes in and what is he trying to do he just gets you to do things gets you to do things and you think it's an enjoyment you have get it to do things going to places you shouldn't go of course you don't even know that you're not supposed to go there you enjoy what you are doing the life you are living people look at you they regret what you are going through but you enjoy it why the devil has taken so much control in that life that is leading you the way into the things you are doing but that representation of god in you is never defined when the devil says lie down you don't ask why your question is for how long when the devil says jump you don't ask why your question is how high do you want me to jump when it says row no question how fast you want me to roll and the devil keeps telling us here and there telling us here and there but a child of god a child of god the devil can never mislead you for too long oh praise be to god amen i remember one time oh my goodness and my work with god has been a rough journey one time i went and i went and i went so so far could i could look back and never trace my steps and i could say to myself that i know it's done and i remember i am saying this to the glory of god i went to a fetish priest somewhere and as i sat down and i was in the open and he did something for me and i was just holding it oh i heard a voice not an audible voice like i'm speaking to you but i had a voice do you know you are a child of god and do you know you are not supposed to be doing this my goodness it broke every bone in me amen amen it broke every bone in me oh i have never forgotten it that thing comes over and over over and over the devil can never carry you further than god will redeem you why is he going to carry you that god will not come after you praise the lord so all the devil is doing is trying his best to make sure that you never get to the light of the world now all this while you don't know who you are you don't know why you belong all you know is that you are enjoying life but as a child of god when you hear the voice of god you hear the word of god preached something happens which is beyond explanation you can't explain it oh my you can't explain it i remember when i was in the church of pentecost i was not just satisfied i said to myself i was looking for something i didn't know what i was looking for if you ask me what are you looking for i will tell you i don't know but i knew i was looking for something that's right then one day i went out as usual doing my own things in the night and there was a crusade brother team was preaching and then when i got there they had finished preaching by then when a preacher man finishes in his rig capping that was where i got to and i heard what he was saying and i stopped right there i said this is what i'm looking for i had a muslim roommate he's in pennsylvania now i went back and i said mohammed i have been looking for something i have found it praise be to god when the word strikes when the deep calls there's a deep to answer you can't explain it but the word comes and then you check yourself the atmosphere changes that is why you can find 10 20 100 people standing and then you have one person come out and the rest don't seem to understand what is going on it doesn't mean they are not child of they are not children of god maybe it is called yeah their season but when the season comes the devil cannot stop it and when the word strikes the word of god is light thy word is a lamp unto my feet the word is the word of god is light and jesus said this is not the condemnation that life has come but men still love darkness because they are this way evil the word of god is light so when the light strikes yes that life of darkness you've been living all your years something happens it's like lightening striking in the midst of darkness thank you jesus something happens and then you begin to check yourself the atmosphere changes and as you give yourself to the world and you begin to feed on the word the more things are happening but before then as the product of god said this physical man here has five senses the spiritual man has five senses but in the soul there is only one sense it's either doubt or faith and faith coming by hearing and hearing by the word of god so all your life all your life until you started hearing the word you were living in the midst of darkness doing the taste of darkness there was no faith there was no faith you were living in doubt in unbelief but when the world comes and you embrace the way amen now and you keep giving yourself to the world faith begins to grow yes faith begins to grow amen your faith begins to grow and as your faith is growing doubt is on its way out now light and darkness there can never be any form of association between light and darkness why there is darkness there is darkness because there is no light but when light comes darkness must leave so when the light of the world comes into your life ductless must find its way out so said that the fight starts in the soul it starts in the soul in the soul because at birth the devil has taken a hold that you are full of darkness the devil is inside there but don't forget that seed of god is planted in there so when the world first strikes now there is a fight right there between god and satan between what is right and what is wrong between light and darkness between just and unjust but as we all know satan is no match for god amen and if you are child of god filled with the holy ghost satan is so much for you yes we can't fear god and fear satan satan is no match for any child of god thank you jesus he belongs under our feet yes praise him he is a coward yes thank you jesus we belong to god we are children of god we have been given authority over satan and over his works if you live in sin it's just your choice that's right if you are doing things you shouldn't do it's just your choice yes sometimes we do it and we blame it on the devil the devil can go only go so far as we are we'll be looking at it here praise be to god amen i don't know why my voice is changing very fast satan is a liar so god bless you brother one that was exactly what i was looking for amen praise be to god amen so when the devil is cast out he doesn't go he doesn't go remember just so long as we are in this body the devil has a claim on you because this flesh this flesh is irredeemable it can never be redeemed it was taken from this earth and satan is the god of this earth and he can always appeal to the flesh and that is where the battle starts he has no control over your life and when he is cast out he doesn't go he comes back now when the word first comes to you and you feel god dealing with your heart it's a very very difficult moment sometimes people print a picture and let you think that it's very very easy no it's a very difficult journey with god because this is the time that the devil is going to tell you you are not wet being a christian look at the life you have lived you lived a very wretched life you live a very shameful life you lived a very disgraceful life you are good for nothing you are bad news that's right tell the devil yes point the devil to the blood point the devil to the blood amen amen praise be to god amen thank you now god became a man for our sake he died to redeem you and me the bible says we are bought and paid for by his blood amen and the devil just sits around and waits for the light to go deep then he concussion on you thank you that is why when you get into the economy of god you have to mean business with god it is no longer there is no plan it's not time to play church the devil knows that his time is at hand he knows it more than we know that our home going is near and he is working over time the devil is working over time just to make sure that you don't get to where you should go you should be this is the time we should see god and see god endlessly to make sure that we've gotten a hold of god to make sure that every question about our salvation is settled the devil can never concede god when god has taken over deathless can never come into your life and overthrow light but what the devil does is that he begins to pump things into your mind and the greatest battle that was ever fought is in the mind here that god and satan meet right in here and satan will tell you things and once the mind accepts it it passes it down to the soul the devil can never unseat god but the devil will try to get you to lose confidence in the word of god and when you lose confidence in the word of god you are disarmed and once you are disarmed the devil finds his way back and your end will be worse than the beginning when the brother said one of the quotes i don't have it here that was what the devil stole but we put it together anyhow that the devil is almost powerless until he can find somebody to use so he always needs a vessel and god also needs a vessel god is a man to work with and satan needs a man to work with so the devil comes and then he can pollute your mind sometimes you see a brother you see a sister just living a very good life it looks like everything is fine until you get into their lives you don't know what you're going through we are all fighting a battle of one kind or the other sometimes all through the night you are awake going through battles mind battles the devil is just pumping you here and there all he is doing is trying to get to the inner monday trying to get you to lose confidence in the word of god that's right that the word of god says by my side you are healed and you go to the hospital with the condition and the doctor tells you this science has no solution to this problem we have given you six months to live there is nothing we can do about this what do you do you have the word of god that says by myself you are healed do you listen to god are you listening to satan the devil can come and tell you that everybody in the church hates you and sometimes their eyes see things that don't even exist that somebody will pass and they are looking on the left you are on the right and it's like they looked at you and then they sized you up and it's okay did i not tell you sometimes we look for things that are not even existing and if you are looking for things that don't exist you will find them the eyes don't just see things that are around it is the mind that tells the eyes what to look at i go to the room most of the times looking for something and my mind is telling me to somewhere and i'm looking at a 10 right sitting in front of me and i'm looking for it everywhere we go through a lot of mind battles yes and sometimes the people that are bearing you up that are keeping you up there are your supports spiritually and are bearing you up by day and by night they are the people that the devil with his ex inside you against because the devil knows what you are doing and the devil knows that if they could get them out of the way they could get to you we go through a lot of mind battles and that is where the greatest battle is fought once you accept it once the mind accepts it it sends it down to the soul then the soul would accept it that is why the prophet of god said that name when the thought comes and it does not line up with the word of god just blow it off do not entertain it a lot of the times we entertain it and we feed on it and we we just baby it we keep it like a treasure and it grows and before we away we are beginning to deal with things we don't have to deal with yes when it comes blow it off when it comes blow it off the devil just comes to reasoning like it happened to him if eve knew what to do and what not to do but she stopped for a moment just for a moment to listen and the devil just passed that thought to her she did not reject it she entertained it she started to reason with the word of god and that brought about the fall and that has created all the problems that man has to go through in this life that's right all the wars all the hatred all the malice all the fights all the bloodshed just because she stopped for a moment to listen do not reason with the word we are not called to understand we are not called to reason that is how we don't save god based on our feelings it's by faith because the devil can penetrate the devil uses the five senses of the soul of the spirit to get to you praise be to god the greatest ever as i said i never intended to finish this because part of my notes are gone and what i have here i believe by the grace of god somehow what is going to touch i mean speak twice in one way or the other so in closing we need to guard against our mind the mind is very very very strong a mass heart can stop beating if the brain does not stop working they don't pronounce him dead they will tell you he's in coma because the brain is still working and the prayer of god said the mind is the door to the soul so you can choose to open it or close it and you should be worried what you are opening your mind to be careful the thoughts you entertain because they can ruin your life if anything comes into your mind there are things you can never stop from coming into your mind but you don't have to entertain them they don't have to come and stay a lot of the times we provide shelter for the enemy to come and sit down and have fellowship with us know that you are a child of god you belong to the economy of god that we have an adversary that we are fighting the devil is seeking to destroy you and this battle is never ended until we are out of this life yes for every day we live we are fighting a battle whether at home whether in your marriage whether at school whether at a mall whether at work wherever you are you are fighting a battle of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaking you never know what is in the mind until it is let out of the mouth the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind i go through it and i believe some of us if not all of us go through it the devil will try to lift your past bring it before you what is he trying to do let you lose confidence and things that don't exist the devil will try to put them in your mind praise be to god and i want us to know tonight that every step we take in this life god is interested in that step yes that the steps of the righteous are ordered of the lord that nothing can go wrong some of the things that we see go wrong they are for our own good god permits them it's not that the devil is having its way no the devil can never have his way with any child of god but sometimes god would allow things to happen and it is for our own good it is not a time that we want trials and temptations are very difficult moments for any believer but god allows those things for a good reason when a plant grows the root takes a hold of the soil once it was buried in there once darkness overshadowed it but once it grows and it becomes a tree it takes a hold of that soil the flesh and the desires of the flesh has no control over your life they should be subject to you we are not subject to it praise be to god thank you jesus i think this is a very good place to end and god bless you for bearing with me tonight and i trust and believe that somehow god has spoken to you because the bible says his word will not go out and come back void but whenever his word goes out it would accomplish the purpose for which is being sent out i believe that the word of god tonight did not come in vain praise be to god thank you jesus i want us to go to the lord in prayer just talk to god whichever way god may have spoken to you i have no way of knowing it but the word of god has come to us in one way or the other we are all fighting battles and a lot of the times we leave our god-given positions and once you leave your god-given position you have given the enemy a weapon against you we are going to pray tonight and ask god to help us to keep to keep our position in christ to stay our grounds because if we should all stay our grounds if we should all keep our position in christ the devil has no place in our midst it's not to say the lord is not going to fight the devil is going to fight but the devil has no place in our midst praise be to god yes shall we go to god and pray tonight our lord and our savior jesus we thank you so much oh god for your word that has come to us tonight we are so very much grateful for the pieces of words father oh god that have been spoken from behind the pulpit tonight they may not mean anything further but it's my prayer dear lord jesus that you will unite them in the house of your sons and daughters tonight and let them mean something lord let them mean something in our lives oh god for we did not come to hear a man speak we came that you may speak to us oh god and your word has come lord and the bible says your word would not go out and come back void the purpose of which your word came out tonight we pray the father tonight and we beseech you in the name of jesus let it be accomplished in our lives oh god and let our lives blossom let our lives bear fruits lord where do you have repentance lord and let us live the life knowing that our homegoing time is nearer than it has ever been we know that the devil is fighting to finish to get us down but we know oh god that heaven is behind us and we are never going to lose this battle we commit ourselves into your hands oh god we yield ourselves father we surrender all that we are into your hands oh god and we pray dear lord jesus come and take absolute control over our lives yes speak through us oh god touch every heart lord quicken your weight further into our souls tonight and as we leave your presence may you go with us and open our minds open our eyes to see take the skills of our eyes oh god may you touch us in a very special way oh god as many as i've got it father oh god and as many as father have joined the service online may you be with every one of us let your glory father be seen in our lives and let your perfect will be made manifest in us oh god come and be glorified and even so come quickly oh god we thank you dear lord jesus we thank

worship your father tonight and we bless you for everything you've done for us in the name of jesus our lord and savior we pray father hey thank you hey brother one don't know tonight we know we are in uh in the greatest battle ever thought you know when uh i was reading something uh the other the other day there in our devotion and brother branham was testifying of the devil speaking to his mind that this man jesus could have just been an ordinary man and people just talk about him and just make him and he just went about talking about you know how satan was just trying to make jesus like an ordinary man he was you were just like an ordinary man like any man that one slave and what was going on was the greatest battle in his mind and just like our brother said you know brother branham said is to be able to bring us to that place where we can lose confidence in the world praise the lord amen so we just want to thank the lord we want to thank the lord for uh that encouragement tonight for reminding us you know that we have to guide our mind we have to guide our hearts you know as i encourage us to do that to be able to guide our hearts and the way to do it is to guide our heart by the word of the lord amen let's meditate upon the word praise the lord you know what brother branham says christian life is a life that is easily to be misunderstood praise the lord why because we are living we are living a dual life we have a spirit man and we have a physical body and something but dan said that was that that i've just wrote on he talked about satan's claim you know satan has a claim and he says certain claim is it's upon this flesh and the flesh is not redeemed just think about it satan has a claim that is not redeemable you know and that's as far as he can go because his claim is not redeemable but we have a kingsman redeemer you know whose claim is redeemable praise the lord so we want to thank god for all of that let's just stand to our feet tonight and praise the lord and uh let's turn to our feet tonight let's just find a song we can sing and just thank god you know he's the captain of our salvation he's the one that is fighting the battles and we are claiming the victory praise the lord that's the reason why we are more than conquerors because he's the one that is fighting the battles praise the lord amen amen if the enemy brings things upon

mind like brother dan said he's a guy that worked overtime he know his time is shot he would he would try to bring any negative thing to your mind maybe something negative about the service tonight and and you have to guide your mind you have to fight to be able to keep the word of god on your mind and keep your thoughts people before the lord praise the lord amen so let's just buy our house once again heavenly father we are so grateful tonight to be reminded that lord god we are in in the greater battle lord father as our brother said we are fighting the battle the angels fought lord god
