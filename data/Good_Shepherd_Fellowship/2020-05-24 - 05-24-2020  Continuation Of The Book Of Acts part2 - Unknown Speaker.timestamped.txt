[13:10] story this is my song praising my Savior
[13:15] all the day long any man praise the Lord
[13:18] you know I remember brother David right
[13:20] when he was up here he's happy to wear
[13:22] his glasses and he'd always be putting
[13:24] him on taking him off and I'm think I'm
[13:26] starting to get the revelation what that
[13:28] is so me ma'am how did he yeah you know
[13:35] I was telling sister Carol yesterday
[13:37] afternoon it would have been nice to set
[13:40] something up so we could have her
[13:41] sitting at the piano and at home that
[13:44] brother Wesley sitting next door he
[13:46] could hold the phone while she sang a
[13:48] special but we haven't quite got there
[13:50] yet so aim and I know that they are
[13:53] having good progress on the remodeling
[13:56] and the church and still a little bit
[13:57] little ways to go yet so and of course
[14:01] you may have heard I think it was on
[14:04] Saturday afternoon governor walls had a
[14:07] very special session to announce that
[14:09] that churches could actually start
[14:12] opening up a little bit and and have
[14:16] services together so a little bit of
[14:19] limitation on there yes all we were
[14:21] preaching brother booth we are teasing
[14:23] brother blot a thought you have to have
[14:25] two or three services and we could just
[14:26] have one group coming for each one you
[14:29] can just go from one to the next to the
[14:31] next so I he would just get warmed up on
[14:35] the first group and then really get into
[14:37] with the second group and probably wrap
[14:39] it up with the third group so but we'll
[14:42] see what happens amen hallelujah amen
[14:45] well let's go right to prayer this
[14:47] morning I trust that you're already
[14:49] having a good day today that you're
[14:52] anticipating what the Lord would do
[14:54] we've had some wonderful services all my
[14:58] saints of God and I'm sure we have
[15:02] something special in store for us today
[15:04] not because of brother blah T or good
[15:09] singing or anything like that those
[15:11] things are all fine but because our Lord
[15:13] and Savior Jesus Christ before the
[15:15] foundation of the world
[15:17] knew that each and every one of us would
[15:19] be where we're at today dialing into
[15:23] this service a man do you think God was
[15:25] surprised about Kovac 19 and the fact
[15:28] that we have to broadcast remotely he
[15:31] knew before the foundation of the world
[15:33] Amen exactly what was going to happen
[15:35] but yet he still has made a provision
[15:39] for us any man to be able to have him
[15:41] break the bread of life to us this
[15:43] morning so as we go to prayer is
[15:45] anything too hard for God is there
[15:48] something that you have on your heart
[15:51] I need that you have I know there's a
[15:53] number of brothers still looking for
[15:54] work God hasn't forgotten about you I
[15:57] just want to say that if you've got
[15:59] sickness God hasn't forgotten you he's
[16:02] still mindful for mindful of you you've
[16:06] got burdens for loved ones that aren't
[16:08] saved yet God hasn't forgotten that and
[16:10] he's already said that he won't lose a
[16:13] one so as we go to prayer that's go to
[16:15] him confidently in prayer knowing that
[16:19] he is able saints of God praise the Lord
[16:22] let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord

[31:55] many of our brothers that were coming
[31:57] from overseas we were close to
[32:00] accommodating them and we try to uphold
[32:03] a certain image
[32:08] and I mean it pleased the Lord to take a
[32:13] mirror
[32:15] I mean it was just so hard watching
[32:20] a failure

[49:11] this but I would encourage you I was if
[49:14] if you will never add a lot to your
[49:19] Bible reading if you can just encourage
[49:21] yourself by reading through the box of
[49:23] book of Acts and we want to continue
[49:31] from where we stopped on Wednesday night
[49:34] a revelation of Jesus Christ now
[49:38] remember this Christ in the truth church
[49:42] is the continuation of the book of Acts
[49:46] praise the Lord
[49:47] and what we were trying to bring out of
[49:50] their subject was to show you how that
[49:56] after the Holy Ghost came on the date of
[49:59] Pentecost and God pour out his spirit
[50:02] and he was going to use common men not
[50:05] only the 12 disciples or the tour of
[50:09] apostle's but he also used men and women
[50:12] that dedicated himself and if the truth
[50:16] church
[50:17] is going to be the continuation of the
[50:20] book of us it means that God is still
[50:23] going to use common people the Bible
[50:28] says the common people heard him gladly
[50:29] if the common people hear him gladly why
[50:33] not he used the common people praise the
[50:35] Lord so that's why we want to continue
[50:38] on this morning by the grace of God as
[50:42] chapter 1 let us read
[50:44] praise the Lord
[51:03] the formal treaty have I made oh dear
[51:06] Phyllis - of all that Jesus began both
[51:10] to do and teach until the dead in which
[51:14] he was taken up after that he true the
[51:19] holy girls have given commandment unto
[51:22] the Apostles whom he have chosen Allah
[51:25] bless you have your seat we continue to
[51:27] read to whom also he show himself alive
[51:30] after his passion by many infallible Pro
[51:34] being seen of them forty days and
[51:36] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[51:40] kingdom of God praise the Lord we have
[51:42] to realize that the kingdom of God like
[51:44] I said their language the kingdom of God
[51:47] was never used until the time of the New
[51:51] Covenant John the Baptist was the first
[51:54] person I used that phrase repent for the
[51:58] kingdom of God is at hand when Jesus
[52:00] came he took the same message from John
[52:03] repent for the kingdom of God the
[52:06] kingdom of heaven is a hymn praise the
[52:09] Lord and verse full and being assembled
[52:11] together with them commanded them that
[52:14] they should not depart from Jerusalem
[52:17] but wait for the promise of the Father
[52:20] we say he he have heard of me for John
[52:24] truly baptized with water but ye shall
[52:27] be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[52:30] days hence when they therefore will come
[52:34] together they acts of him saying Lord
[52:38] will down at this time restore again the
[52:43] kingdom of Israel
[52:45] now Jesus John were introducing the
[52:49] kingdom of God the kingdom of heaven
[52:52] these Jews high in their mind the
[52:55] promise of the Kingdom of Israel which
[52:58] is the kingdom of David so yeah yeah are
[53:02] these Jews sitting on a a John ministry
[53:05] with Jesus Jesus and saying they're
[53:08] giving parable the kingdom of heaven is
[53:11] like unto ten virgins
[53:13] he gave the kingdom of heaven is like
[53:15] unto a man that made of
[53:17] he's preaching days but all in your mind
[53:19] they are thinking about the Kingdom of
[53:22] Israel but that promise of the Kingdom
[53:26] of Israel was a promise for the
[53:29] Millennium where Jesus will rule as the
[53:33] son of David back on the trail
[53:36] yeah he's trying to introduce a
[53:40] spiritual Kingdom to them sorry let me
[53:42] drink water yeah yeah he's trying to
[53:51] introduce a spiritual Kingdom to them
[53:53] and they are almost set in their name
[53:56] and in your mind they are thinking about
[53:58] oh yes oh yeah yes we've seen that the
[54:02] Ministry of the Messiah Indian mind they
[54:04] are thinking about oh yeah we will
[54:06] conquer these Romans and and we will
[54:08] kick them out of this place they are
[54:10] thinking about a physical Kingdom when
[54:12] his message is all about a spiritual
[54:15] Kingdom and I think that's the simplest
[54:18] were the church the church is in the day
[54:21] that we are living in when the people
[54:22] preach and talk about prosperity and
[54:25] talk about God's blessing it's all about
[54:27] natural things how you would give us
[54:29] money how you would give us car when
[54:31] actually the blessings of the Lord is
[54:33] spiritual blessings their wishes the
[54:36] baptism of the holy gold that gets all
[54:38] ready for the kingdom of God it does not
[54:41] means that God will not bless us
[54:43] physically but actually his blessings
[54:45] and spiritual blessings restored again
[54:50] the qidan to Israel and he said unto
[54:54] them it is it is never for you to know
[54:57] the times or the seasons which the
[55:00] father have put in his own power no man
[55:04] nor the day and the hour he says here
[55:07] but ye shall receive power after the
[55:11] Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall
[55:15] be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[55:19] and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[55:23] uttermost part of the earth and when he
[55:26] has spoken these things
[55:29] did why they beheld he was taken up and
[55:33] a cloud received him out of their sight
[55:37] now as we said on Wednesday night this
[55:41] record that is given to us is a record
[55:45] of our beloved physician look I will
[55:50] beloved brother praise the Lord
[55:53] wish of course he was not normal among
[55:57] the twelve he was not at he was not one
[55:59] of the 12 apostles this man he was not
[56:02] an eyewitness but he was someone that
[56:05] was able to gather the testimony of the
[56:10] different eyewitnesses and he was able
[56:13] to put them together and give us a
[56:15] report now we realized that none of the
[56:22] gospel really bring out this part of of
[56:26] Jesus's testimony and why they look
[56:31] stiff as to was heaven verse 10 as he
[56:36] went up behold two men stood by them in
[56:41] white apparel which also said Ye men of
[56:44] Galilee why stand ye gazing up into
[56:49] heaven they same Jesus which is taken up
[56:54] from you into heaven shall so come in
[56:58] like manner as ye have seen him go into
[57:02] heaven then returned there unto
[57:07] Jerusalem from the mount called olive
[57:12] which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day's
[57:15] journey and when they will come into
[57:18] coming they were up into an upper room
[57:23] where a ball both fitted in James and
[57:26] John and Andrews and Philip and Thomas
[57:30] and you see right here Luke is not
[57:33] giving us the record of all of those
[57:35] disciples and the men and women that
[57:38] were in the upper room but as you listen
[57:40] to his testimony he's not telling
[57:43] you that I was one of them in the upper
[57:46] room he's telling you this is a true
[57:52] witness he's telling you of those that
[57:57] were in the upper room he's giving us
[57:59] first him report because he received
[58:02] these testimonies from the disciples
[58:07] verse 14 these all continued with one
[58:12] Accord in prayer in supplication with
[58:15] the women and Mary the mother of Jesus
[58:20] and wave his brethren
[58:23] praise the Lord I've stopped right there
[58:25] for the reading of the word and then we
[58:28] will we will go right into this now I
[58:30] want to bring something here from the
[58:32] message the testimony of a truth witness
[58:37] rubber number actually read it's very
[58:40] same scripture that we read to preach
[58:42] this message the testimony of a true
[58:45] witness he says now a testimony a person
[58:51] has to have an experience before they
[58:57] can testify praise the Lord
[59:01] a person have to have an experience
[59:06] before they can testify now Burt Scott
[59:09] is almost like I'm giving you a
[59:12] testimony and I'm telling you brother
[59:14] Scott this is what happened as you are
[59:16] listening to me and grabbing the words
[59:19] just like what he'll do I said she had
[59:24] an experience listening to brother
[59:26] Branham speaking about those scars if
[59:29] she never had an experience she would
[59:31] not be inspired because she was not the
[59:34] only one in the room there were men and
[59:36] women all sitting down in the room
[59:38] listening to his testimony but it
[59:41] affected her it impacted her that is the
[59:44] experience that a true testimony brings
[59:46] it impacts you so much you hear about
[59:50] somebody praying and getting an answer
[59:52] it affects you so much until you break
[59:55] down and you start crying
[59:56] to God that I believe you are the same
[59:59] if you did it for this person you can do
[1:00:01] the same for me a person have to have an
[1:00:07] experience before they can testify if
[1:00:15] you were called in court
[1:00:17] you didn't have to ask
[1:00:21] gave a testimony you have to know
[1:00:23] something before you can testify then he
[1:00:28] also talks about a witness he said and a
[1:00:32] witness is a person who have seen
[1:00:37] something
[1:00:39] praise the Lord who have seen something
[1:00:43] take a thing about it
[1:00:45] Andrews there is not a book of Andrews
[1:00:47] there is not a book of Thomas praise the
[1:00:51] Lord all of these men they saw something
[1:00:54] Thomas saw he was the one that put his
[1:00:56] hands in the print of Jesus but you see
[1:01:03] even with with all the things they
[1:01:05] experienced there is a naught of Jairus
[1:01:07] daughter
[1:01:08] open it the blind man as he's in John
[1:01:10] chapter 9 Jesus telling Peter to put it
[1:01:14] pushes both all of those things that
[1:01:16] they experienced you have to realize
[1:01:18] that it had to bring God has to bring a
[1:01:22] man to a place if you sit down with
[1:01:25] Thomas he will tell you what he
[1:01:27] experienced but he was not just inspired
[1:01:30] and blessed to write a report like
[1:01:32] Matthew day to write a report like Matt
[1:01:35] did to write a report like John did but
[1:01:41] they have seen something a person who
[1:01:44] have seen something that know that it is
[1:01:48] truth but bamse Yuma you should see all
[1:01:52] you have heard it for you to be a
[1:01:55] witness
[1:01:57] praise the Lord and the
[1:02:04] to give witness and then a witness must
[1:02:07] know what he's talking about he must not
[1:02:15] be someone told me a setting setting
[1:02:18] think he must be a witness himself if
[1:02:23] net he is speaking on someone SS there
[1:02:27] could be a witness at the same praise
[1:02:31] the Lord
[1:02:32] yeah so we realized here
[1:02:37] Luke giving this report that he has
[1:02:40] gathered from these apostles went to
[1:02:44] different ones went down to the Mary I
[1:02:46] mean I had the belief he spoke with the
[1:02:49] women you know just like generation book
[1:02:51] you know gather all of these testimony
[1:02:54] compare testimonies with testimonies
[1:02:57] just to be he had the burden he was the
[1:03:01] man God anointed him for there we will
[1:03:04] not have a book of us we wouldn't have
[1:03:06] known what topless on the day of
[1:03:08] Pentecost even though he did not come
[1:03:11] himself number and mourn
[1:03:13] then they were in the upper room but yet
[1:03:15] he brought us a wrecker praise the Lord
[1:03:23] Amen oh because I believe that after the
[1:03:33] Holy Ghost fell there were more and more
[1:03:35] that received the Holy Ghost and in in
[1:03:40] different ways the Spirit of God was
[1:03:43] moving on the earth at that time and
[1:03:45] people that had their heart open and and
[1:03:48] were ready to be able to receive the
[1:03:51] Apostolic message God was visiting them
[1:03:55] with the Holy Ghost if God who have just
[1:03:58] given us a record of how many people
[1:04:00] believe they received the Holy Ghost
[1:04:02] around that time we will not have a book
[1:04:04] but the scriptures gave us three
[1:04:07] principal way that the Holy Ghost came
[1:04:08] why Peters speak the word or as chapter
[1:04:11] 2 experience why Peters speak the word
[1:04:14] and also the laying on of hands
[1:04:17] praise the Lord I mean God display it
[1:04:21] that way so we cannot be like
[1:04:24] Pentecostal church and only way to speak
[1:04:27] in tongues before we believe that we can
[1:04:29] receive the Holy Ghost we can receive
[1:04:31] the Holy Ghost in our home from the
[1:04:33] receiving of the word it's receiving the
[1:04:35] word is the heart ready to receive God's
[1:04:38] Word
[1:04:41] praise the Lord and if the devil is is
[1:04:45] blasting your mind and he keeps
[1:04:47] condemning you and you don't feel like
[1:04:49] you have the Holy Ghost we can bring
[1:04:51] some man filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:52] we can lay our hands on you and break
[1:04:55] you through that experience it's all
[1:04:58] Pentecost those men were in there in in
[1:05:04] in the room I don't want to go ahead of
[1:05:07] myself but they were in in the upper
[1:05:09] room like Luke said they were in the
[1:05:12] upper endoscopy is they were all in the
[1:05:17] upper room waiting for the promise they
[1:05:19] did not know how it would come
[1:05:21] they were just waiting preparing
[1:05:24] themselves I can tell you one secret of
[1:05:29] the Holy Ghost one secret of the Holy
[1:05:32] Ghost is that you should be in constant
[1:05:35] preparation but constant repentance you
[1:05:41] should have a heart of repentance
[1:05:44] praise the Lord amen God will never buy
[1:05:49] price repentance and give you the Holy
[1:05:51] Ghost he will not bypass repentance he
[1:05:57] could bypass baptism God can bypass gift
[1:06:01] God can bypass a preacher and give you
[1:06:04] the Holy Ghost God can bypass a church
[1:06:06] and give you the Holy Ghost but he will
[1:06:08] never bypass repentance because when
[1:06:11] John came with this message he said
[1:06:14] repent for the kingdom of God is a hand
[1:06:17] repentance is the foundation work is the
[1:06:21] foundation stone of the kingdom of God
[1:06:23] the first stone I was put into the earth
[1:06:26] as a cornerstone is repentance
[1:06:30] oh that's a little secret you can just
[1:06:34] put that in your purse hide it somewhere
[1:06:36] let the devil don't see it get a heart
[1:06:39] of repentance all the time if you don't
[1:06:41] have confidence that you have the holy
[1:06:43] God just keep repenting praise the Lord
[1:06:48] because God will now bypass repentance
[1:06:51] that is the foundation stone for this
[1:06:54] new kid on this spiritual Kingdom called
[1:06:57] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a
[1:06:59] spiritual Kingdom we are born into it we
[1:07:04] can join it it does not come by
[1:07:06] membership it comes by the new birth
[1:07:10] repent for the kingdom of heaven is a
[1:07:13] hand praise the Lord
[1:07:15] so we're talking about a true witness
[1:07:17] here the testimony of a true witness
[1:07:21] praise the Lord I was reading this this
[1:07:24] morning hours and you know sometimes how
[1:07:27] you try to think about a while look at
[1:07:28] this it says I didn't really difference
[1:07:30] is there a difference between it you
[1:07:33] know a testimony is there the difference
[1:07:35] between a witness I was just kind of
[1:07:37] looking at I think that both of them
[1:07:39] goes goes the same praise the Lord
[1:07:43] and man I have had an experience he has
[1:07:47] a testimony and his experience is his
[1:07:51] witness the experience comes like the
[1:07:55] Bible says the Holy Spirit bear record
[1:07:58] that we are children of God it come and
[1:08:01] witness to her that you are a son of God
[1:08:04] you are a daughter of God praise the
[1:08:07] Lord Amen oh my and he goes down in that
[1:08:14] in that same message she says the word
[1:08:17] is the testimony of God
[1:08:20] oh we know that the scripture says in
[1:08:23] Revelation
[1:08:24] you know the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:08:27] is the spirit of prophecy and then he
[1:08:30] starts to talk about how God in in
[1:08:33] creation and in nature he witnessed to
[1:08:39] his people everything
[1:08:40] praise the Lord the Word of God
[1:08:44] is his testimony amen
[1:08:48] the Word of God is his testimony now
[1:08:51] this is the way how they can they can
[1:08:56] grab a man being the truth witness or a
[1:09:00] false witness wash his testimony if his
[1:09:04] testimony is not constant he's brought
[1:09:08] in the first time to testify and he says
[1:09:11] something different then the next day
[1:09:14] that brings him in then he says no it
[1:09:16] was not Monday actually it was Tuesday
[1:09:18] evening and then the tenth day of the
[1:09:21] brief scene he says really it was in the
[1:09:23] morning I think it was Monday praise the
[1:09:27] Lord
[1:09:27] I mean he's standing as a witness before
[1:09:33] for his testimony to be accepted for us
[1:09:40] to accept him as a truth witness we have
[1:09:43] to look at his testimony so the Word of
[1:09:47] God is God's testimony and he witnessed
[1:09:53] the word in nature in creation the Sun
[1:09:58] comes up in the morning it goes unknown
[1:10:01] evening it goes down the next morning it
[1:10:04] comes over and over since the day of
[1:10:06] creation the Sun has been doing that
[1:10:08] it's a witness that the testimony of the
[1:10:11] Resurrection is truth praise the Lord
[1:10:18] so for you to be able to be true witness
[1:10:23] your testimony must be constant for you
[1:10:27] to be a true witness your testimony must
[1:10:29] line up with God's Word praise the Lord
[1:10:36] that's the reason why and I mean I mean
[1:10:39] look testifying of these things you
[1:10:42] learn of his gospel you learn a Luke
[1:10:46] gospel with Matthew Mark and John you
[1:10:49] will find out that he'd been a true
[1:10:51] witness
[1:10:54] because sometimes you think look is
[1:10:56] growing a little bit farther to say
[1:10:58] something that might you never said but
[1:11:00] check John John says the same thing
[1:11:04] praise the Lord amen
[1:11:10] so we see God here a Wednesday night I
[1:11:16] was talking about the using common
[1:11:18] people but this this morning as we look
[1:11:22] at the continuation of the book of Acts
[1:11:25] remember we just we just spoke the other
[1:11:28] day talking about apostolic time among
[1:11:31] us and we need to step into it we need
[1:11:34] to step by fit right into that the
[1:11:36] things that God wants to do through his
[1:11:38] children to make his present real in
[1:11:41] this time indeed that we are living
[1:11:44] praise the Lord
[1:11:46] a friend of mine from south africa
[1:11:47] tsamina text this morning he says he
[1:11:51] said I remember what he said in the text
[1:11:53] there but he said something like he says
[1:11:55] this is yeah man well I like your
[1:11:59] president you know he said he just he
[1:12:02] just on the heels of devil you ish own
[1:12:05] so I text him back I said well you know
[1:12:07] the Prophet told us watch how the church
[1:12:11] is praying and you see what is happening
[1:12:16] so I believe that just like we spoke
[1:12:20] about the mother of all living and shows
[1:12:23] that the church she represents the moon
[1:12:28] that controls you know the moon God
[1:12:31] placed the moon to be able to take out
[1:12:33] of judgment you think about flawed you
[1:12:40] think about rain falling you think about
[1:12:43] natural disaster the moon controls them
[1:12:47] and that's how the church is the church
[1:12:51] controls the judgment that comes upon
[1:12:53] the earth and when the people gets down
[1:12:57] to pray like the law to Solomon if my
[1:13:00] people that are called by my name and I
[1:13:04] believe the church the people has been
[1:13:06] caught
[1:13:07] upon God's name and for God to answer
[1:13:10] that prayer he just had to are not diner
[1:13:12] Trump to get behind those politician
[1:13:14] open the churches and let the people
[1:13:16] pray praise the Lord
[1:13:20] it meant I just believed that it's an
[1:13:24] answer to our prayers as the people
[1:13:26] prayed around the world and prayed
[1:13:27] around the nation it's not it's not only
[1:13:30] us here everywhere around the world you
[1:13:33] know people are crying in their home
[1:13:35] people are fasting and I mean but yet
[1:13:39] God is working at the back of the scene
[1:13:43] so we want to thank the Lord for that
[1:13:45] praise the Lord so we get right here we
[1:13:49] see that Luke is testifying that a
[1:13:53] promise was giving the promise of the
[1:13:58] Father he says for John truly baptized
[1:14:03] with water verse 5 but ye shall receive
[1:14:07] ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:10] not many there hangs yeah actually it's
[1:14:18] in verse 4 when he talks about the
[1:14:20] promise of the Father there soon a
[1:14:22] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[1:14:25] promise of the father we say heed ye
[1:14:30] have heard of me for John truly baptized
[1:14:33] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[1:14:36] the Holy Ghost not many days hence can
[1:14:39] you imagine how anxious these disciples
[1:14:44] were for the Holy Ghost understanding
[1:14:47] understanding that Jesus said when I go
[1:14:51] I will send the comforter understanding
[1:14:55] that the understanding that the thing
[1:14:58] that Jesus did can you imagine those men
[1:15:01] they went out they cast out Devils they
[1:15:03] came back shouting & hyuna one little
[1:15:06] boy with epaulets and they prayed and
[1:15:10] they cried that the row on the ground
[1:15:12] Jehovah Lord the cry cry
[1:15:15] crowd Ananda Jessica Lynne do it do you
[1:15:21] realize how on answer prayers how a we
[1:15:26] can faith I mean when you really
[1:15:30] desperate and you crying out to God
[1:15:33] poorly now you are doing all that you
[1:15:36] know how to do anxiously waiting to see
[1:15:40] a miracle and you wake up and it looks
[1:15:44] like nothing change praise the Lord and
[1:15:50] that is the problem of this last days
[1:15:53] Church we have had a lot of unanswered
[1:15:57] prayers the reason is because people are
[1:16:01] bypassing the Word of God and the one
[1:16:05] result of the Word of God you can get
[1:16:07] you can playing Korn and get apples you
[1:16:11] can bypass God's principle you will not
[1:16:14] repent you and I live right but yet you
[1:16:16] want God to be an errand boy for you
[1:16:19] every time you ask him for something
[1:16:20] he's rushing to give it to you that's
[1:16:23] the problem of our age on answer prayers
[1:16:26] has killed the church that's the reason
[1:16:28] why most of them do I mean going into
[1:16:30] strange spirits lying miracles because
[1:16:37] God honor his word praise the Lord
[1:16:42] Solomon says that he will not hear
[1:16:44] abominable prayers people living in
[1:16:46] abomination they can even dress right in
[1:16:50] church but yeah they want to have loud
[1:16:54] mouth before God god I commend you you
[1:16:58] are speaking to the God of your
[1:16:59] imagination not the God of this Bible or
[1:17:02] the God of heaven because God will not
[1:17:06] yet abominable prayers people living on
[1:17:10] clean live in adultery and all sorts of
[1:17:12] things and then the whole the Sacre word
[1:17:14] of God is the God of your imagination
[1:17:18] not the God of heaven in air because the
[1:17:21] God of heaven and earth he stands behind
[1:17:23] his world
[1:17:25] he stands behind his word look at this
[1:17:28] principle that Jesus taught us Matt
[1:17:31] chapter 11 jesus said if you have faith
[1:17:37] you will say to this mountain be they
[1:17:42] remove and after you have moved the
[1:17:46] mountain then ask whatever you will is
[1:17:53] to promise in 1 you first have to move
[1:17:58] the mountain
[1:17:59] you need a faith by the Word of God to
[1:18:02] address the mountain in your life in
[1:18:05] your situation then now you can speak
[1:18:08] like Adam and ask whatever you will the
[1:18:12] Bible says praise the Lord
[1:18:16] but no we want to we want to hide behind
[1:18:19] the mountains of doubt and fear we want
[1:18:24] to be behind a mountain we have not
[1:18:26] addressed the mountain yet and just
[1:18:28] believing that God will show up somehow
[1:18:30] and give us exactly what we say from man
[1:18:36] like Elijah to come out and said there
[1:18:38] will be no rain or Dew you until I call
[1:18:40] for it asks whatever you will just add
[1:18:44] the word for you to do that you have to
[1:18:48] first move the mountain you have to have
[1:18:51] faith to these will unbeliev indeed with
[1:18:55] doubt and deal with complex and be
[1:18:58] waiver I mean just just anything
[1:19:03] contrary to God's Word praise the Lord
[1:19:12] the truth church is the continuation of
[1:19:15] the book of patch and what the Holy
[1:19:20] Ghost has come to do remember Luke said
[1:19:26] what Jesus began to do and teach the
[1:19:31] Holy Ghost has come back in the church
[1:19:33] to be able to teach us right you
[1:19:37] remember
[1:19:37] one time when Jesus was around one of
[1:19:39] those two brothers they wanted to turn
[1:19:42] those people into wolf they were going
[1:19:45] to misuse the power of God but yet the
[1:19:50] Holy Ghost has now come to the church in
[1:19:54] obedient of what as I said in Isaiah
[1:19:56] chapter 28 to teach teach us teach us
[1:20:03] how to live right how to talk right how
[1:20:08] to use what God has given to us not to
[1:20:12] make money out of our gifts or make
[1:20:14] money out of the things of God no how to
[1:20:17] live according to God's Word that's why
[1:20:20] the Holy Ghost has come now it's not you
[1:20:24] know we read we read here the Bible says
[1:20:27] and you shall receive power when the
[1:20:30] Holy Ghost have come we jump over all
[1:20:34] the teaching we jump over the foundation
[1:20:36] work that the Holy Ghost supposed to do
[1:20:38] in our life we want power the Bible says
[1:20:41] when the Holy Ghost shall come we will
[1:20:43] have power everybody want the power but
[1:20:46] they have foundation work to be done you
[1:20:51] realize if you don't have the foundation
[1:20:52] right it's an explosion you will be
[1:20:56] caught up in a when that power come is
[1:20:58] going to blow you up even because you
[1:21:01] don't have the foundation right the
[1:21:04] foundation work don't well just like I
[1:21:09] said the foundation stone is repentance
[1:21:14] having a heart that is right before God
[1:21:18] having a heart that is seeking God's
[1:21:21] mercy oh if that would just be the
[1:21:26] attitude of God's children whenever we
[1:21:28] find ourselves in the wrong not
[1:21:30] justifying ourselves and blending the
[1:21:32] church and and-and-and-and-and blaming
[1:21:35] everybody it's God I call you are a son
[1:21:37] of God you are a daughter of God you are
[1:21:39] responsible to go for His Word put your
[1:21:41] hand right with God and then you will
[1:21:45] see God moving on the same for you we
[1:21:48] want power
[1:21:50] oh we wonder blind eyes to opium we want
[1:21:52] to we want to go yeah
[1:21:55] praise the Lord oh my goodness
[1:21:59] hey man Amen I was talking with one
[1:22:03] young man and he says I mean you were
[1:22:06] just talking about fading talking about
[1:22:08] what God would do it he says you know I
[1:22:10] just feel like calling to all of these
[1:22:13] Finneran woman and because I want to see
[1:22:15] God raised in the dead sea water faith
[1:22:18] but there is a foundation stone you know
[1:22:23] there is a foundation stone you see when
[1:22:26] when those foundation stones are placed
[1:22:29] right when our hearts are right with God
[1:22:32] and we are living right you will not be
[1:22:35] anxious for miracle no girl would get
[1:22:39] the right man in the right place at the
[1:22:42] right time and do the right thing you
[1:22:45] will not be wanting to see wanting to
[1:22:48] see no when the foundation is laid right
[1:22:52] just like Solomon temple the glory of
[1:22:55] God came down that even the people never
[1:22:59] had a place to stand
[1:23:00] go fill his tabernacle and that's what
[1:23:04] God was doing on the days of pentacle
[1:23:07] get the foundation right praise the Lord
[1:23:12] can you imagine all those imposters in
[1:23:15] the in the upper room sitting down and
[1:23:16] an America going there to matter matter
[1:23:20] you know I just thought about something
[1:23:23] you know I really I didn't realize that
[1:23:25] that day when I said that to you you
[1:23:27] remember that day I mean some years ago
[1:23:30] I said that to you and I real hopefully
[1:23:32] you I'm so sorry
[1:23:33] you know because God was preparing their
[1:23:35] hearts God was preparing the heart and
[1:23:42] Susan remember that the lady down the
[1:23:45] street she talks some things from her
[1:23:47] and she never paid her and she just been
[1:23:49] avoiding the lady so what she did she
[1:23:51] sneak cover her head went down there and
[1:23:54] make it right
[1:23:55] putting the foundation strewn right
[1:23:58] God will never back pass repentance and
[1:24:02] give you the Holy Ghost
[1:24:04] repentance is the foundation stone for
[1:24:08] us to rewrite the book of Acts or be a
[1:24:12] continuation of the book of we must go
[1:24:14] back in address our foundation stone ha
[1:24:17] our hard right before God
[1:24:20] sorry must never be a difficult word
[1:24:23] we must not even stormer to see sorry we
[1:24:27] must say it and say it loud and clear we
[1:24:32] must be glad to say I'm sorry
[1:24:42] praise the Lord if we can address the
[1:24:46] foundation stone because you realize
[1:24:51] that the foundation stone was the
[1:24:56] rejected stone and because it was the
[1:25:02] rejected stone the building was not
[1:25:04] complete their building is going to fall
[1:25:08] down if you if you if you reject your
[1:25:11] foundation stone that building is going
[1:25:13] to crumble praise the Lord
[1:25:20] because if you keep the Alpha and Omega
[1:25:22] principle the capstone and the
[1:25:25] foundation stone is Christ
[1:25:29] so the capstone and the foundation stone
[1:25:32] because you know message believe it
[1:25:33] equate to blow you out of your preaching
[1:25:35] no no no the rosetta stone was the
[1:25:37] capstone is the same as the foundation
[1:25:38] stone go and look in the message that
[1:25:41] Weber Bentham says because it's the
[1:25:42] Alpha and Omega principle he begin it he
[1:25:45] close it up he was the foundation stone
[1:25:48] upon this rock I will build my church
[1:25:50] and he was the capstone so if you reject
[1:25:57] the capstone is the same if you have a
[1:25:59] building in the capstone is not there
[1:26:01] it's not ready to be boring if you have
[1:26:03] a building in the foundation stone is
[1:26:05] now right that building is coming down
[1:26:13] oh I just believe that's what God is
[1:26:20] looking for a hot that travail the heart
[1:26:27] that is crying before God I want a heart
[1:26:36] that is right with you Oh Lord then your
[1:26:44] heart be right with God leave the rest
[1:26:47] remember the Bible says if a man weighs
[1:26:49] pleases the Lord well if a man weighs
[1:26:53] pleases the Lord leave the rest in the
[1:26:55] hands of God praise the Lord
[1:27:00] yeah I love the way the Bible says it
[1:27:04] when a man which pleases the Lord he
[1:27:06] never says his brothers will be happy
[1:27:08] his enemy so which means if the enemy
[1:27:11] will be happy everybody close will be
[1:27:13] more happy when a man wins pleases the
[1:27:18] Lord is going to overflow it's going to
[1:27:22] overflow it's the foundation stone we
[1:27:27] seek to please this person we want to
[1:27:29] make this other person happy we want to
[1:27:31] make this press and our vertical
[1:27:32] relationship is just completely out of
[1:27:35] order which are seeking to make men
[1:27:41] happy and seeking to make this person
[1:27:43] happen we don't even look at buff and
[1:27:45] said I wonder if God is happy about what
[1:27:47] I'm doing happy about the life that I'm
[1:27:51] living we bleed the the Savior's heart
[1:28:02] he has a standard mercy and grace love
[1:28:05] to us protection we heard his heart
[1:28:08] every day when we keep walking into
[1:28:11] those things that we know we should not
[1:28:13] do and then we get a big bore go it's a
[1:28:21] merciful God on pause
[1:28:24] should we continue in sin that grace
[1:28:26] muscle-bound he said golf obey realizing
[1:28:31] that one of these days our days will be
[1:28:36] number and we will have to stand before
[1:28:39] I will make her and give a count oh
[1:28:44] that's why when were scared he was
[1:28:46] singing that's on there's a room at the
[1:28:47] cross that's all I was thinking about
[1:28:51] so all revival is son that's a that's a
[1:28:55] song that gives an opportunity for
[1:28:58] people to make the heart ride because
[1:29:00] there's a room at the Cross God has room
[1:29:04] at the cross and what is that room for
[1:29:08] for you to be me right with cavalry for
[1:29:11] you to open your heart press a lot why
[1:29:17] he was up there hanging between heaven
[1:29:19] and earth the veil in the temple rented
[1:29:23] it make room for everybody
[1:29:25] it wouldn't had a little passage for the
[1:29:28] high priest but he rented the whole
[1:29:30] thing praise the Lord
[1:29:32] amen I was having having Bible Stella
[1:29:37] Wilbur Brad one night he said it's so
[1:29:39] beautiful alive he said he said he said
[1:29:42] well can you imagine that they feel
[1:29:45] rented and then after all of those
[1:29:50] things the sacrifice has already been
[1:29:52] painful and the next day those Jewish
[1:29:56] priests started sawing the veal back we
[1:30:00] gotta hang this temple up is not right
[1:30:02] and it started making effort to sew it
[1:30:06] before the people would come to church
[1:30:10] they started sewing it back praise the
[1:30:14] Lord I believe 100 godly men came in and
[1:30:18] he look I'm seeing the red thread on
[1:30:22] that Whiteville what is that no it is
[1:30:27] not straight honey can you see there is
[1:30:30] that a sewing it's not even balanced
[1:30:35] right
[1:30:36] that's what happens when men are put in
[1:30:39] effort God is trying to pull you out of
[1:30:44] your wrong trying to pull you out of
[1:30:46] your mistakes and your slothfulness and
[1:30:48] you keep trying to make up yourself
[1:30:51] praise the Lord
[1:30:57] that's what people do make up just to
[1:30:59] look a little bit different
[1:31:03] amen just to look a little bit different
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:10] praise the Lord oh my goodness a
[1:31:16] continuation of the book of ads we can
[1:31:20] never walk where these are posters have
[1:31:23] trolled if we don't start where they
[1:31:26] studied we can walk where they apostle's
[1:31:31] after all verb MC is almost like foods
[1:31:37] getting on her nails shoes to walk we're
[1:31:41] injures have trolled we could see people
[1:31:47] claiming Apostolic Faith and claiming
[1:31:49] you know apostolic blessing and claiming
[1:31:53] everything of the Apostles but it
[1:31:55] refused to start worthy and postures
[1:31:58] have started see what the Bible says
[1:32:00] here they were all in one Accord all in
[1:32:04] one Accord we can't even agree with
[1:32:06] ourself praise the Lord we can even
[1:32:11] agree with ourself the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:12] dealing with your heart your mind is I
[1:32:14] doing about it they were all in one
[1:32:17] Accord that's where they started from if
[1:32:20] we would get the apostolic blessing we
[1:32:23] have to come to that place we wanna call

[1:32:27] white with black time and all the
[1:32:29] sisters in black skirt with white
[1:32:31] blouses that's not want a card that's
[1:32:33] cutters in one Accord is for us to
[1:32:37] forsake our ideas and subscribe to what
[1:32:40] the Word of God says if it is the word
[1:32:43] of God accept it and forget about what
[1:32:45] you think about it one Accord and in
[1:32:50] that's the way they supposed to be
[1:32:53] oh my praise the Lord
[1:32:57] I mean if if a church will receive the
[1:33:04] the Pentecostal blessing we must go back
[1:33:07] to the Pentecost of the beginning we
[1:33:11] start with repentance in and uniting our
[1:33:14] heart back to the Word of God uniting
[1:33:20] our heart back to the Word of God praise
[1:33:30] the Lord
[1:33:31] that's the apostolic blessing that's
[1:33:33] where they started from they're all
[1:33:38] together in one heart and one mind

[1:34:22] serious if if all of our mind is driving
[1:34:26] to that place of God we want to see you
[1:34:29] in our miss father if anything I was I'm
[1:34:36] doing that it's not right my
[1:34:38] slothfulness mind mind mind you know
[1:34:40] lateness for church and you know I mean
[1:34:44] not Navy being conscious of what you're
[1:34:48] doing in our mess every one of them in
[1:34:53] that Upper Room there was one thing on
[1:34:55] your mind the promise of the Father
[1:34:59] praise the Lord
[1:35:01] the promise of the Father I like the way
[1:35:09] but Jesse Smith sherry applause here in
[1:35:12] a few minutes he says he says can you
[1:35:18] remember I can you imagine 10 days they
[1:35:21] took off from work he said they took off
[1:35:27] from work it was so serious that it took
[1:35:31] off from work and he had to put a happy
[1:35:36] for God
[1:35:42] times out what x is so filled up praise
[1:35:46] the Lord
[1:35:47] then when we even have a little break
[1:35:49] from work we don't know what to do
[1:35:51] because just a lot of things to be done
[1:35:55] but they said a time is high even though
[1:35:59] it was a promise of God I was driving
[1:36:02] him to that place it was a promise of
[1:36:07] God I was driving them because
[1:36:09] remembered the the the Saints I spent 40
[1:36:12] days on the earth the Lord and the
[1:36:14] scenes and in in the 10 day period that
[1:36:17] was between the 40 and 50 because that's
[1:36:20] what Pentecost means it means 50 the 10
[1:36:22] day period that was in between the this
[1:36:26] man and women took off they have just
[1:36:29] stood on Mount Olive looking at him in a
[1:36:36] glory of his presence ascending up to
[1:36:39] heaven and says the same manner you see
[1:36:44] him glory praise the Lord the same
[1:36:49] manner you see him extending caught up
[1:36:52] in a cloud sending up to heaven praise
[1:36:57] the Lord I know when you talk about this

[1:37:04] startled first I'm not not have to fuss
[1:37:05] with anybody I'm talking about a reality
[1:37:10] because we can talk about there we can
[1:37:12] fall back and what I believe in what
[1:37:14] what you to believe in and this other
[1:37:16] person says this and but we are talking
[1:37:18] about a time we have a promise that the
[1:37:23] same where does our posture saw him

[1:37:29] same way if any kid in his presence with
[1:37:32] a client

[1:37:42] a cycle living in a cycle a time that we
[1:37:50] call the coming of the Lord
[1:37:52] we've been living in that atmosphere and
[1:37:57] that is the reason why we have to go
[1:38:00] back today foundation-stone go back to
[1:38:04] the beginning one one wanna call some
[1:38:10] people are just they're just anointed to
[1:38:12] be different they always there they are
[1:38:15] just that way their mind is geared that
[1:38:17] way when God came down he was so pleased
[1:38:24] with their prayers and their
[1:38:26] supplication he was so pleased that the
[1:38:30] heart was right

[1:39:33] a testimonial of a preacher and its wife
[1:39:36] and I mean there was just a lot of
[1:39:39] things going on in the woman she was
[1:39:42] feeling hurt because of some things he

[1:39:49] surprise his wife took her to one of the
[1:39:51] expensive hotel
[1:39:52] he went there and he playing with the
[1:39:54] guy you know every I think I know every
[1:39:58] five minutes or every ten minutes he
[1:40:00] would come with a different color flavor
[1:40:02] you know so the woman is sitting there
[1:40:04] they are in the restaurant and every ten
[1:40:07] minutes one of the the Seavers in the
[1:40:10] restaurant would come with a with a
[1:40:12] different color flower and presented to
[1:40:13] the woman she said I'm sitting there and
[1:40:15] I'm thinking yeah he really doing he
[1:40:19] really doing I mean working hard to
[1:40:22] impress me and then another ten minutes
[1:40:27] another guy comes again and bowed down
[1:40:29] with a purple flower and she's sitting
[1:40:33] yeah Wow blue purple and after ten
[1:40:41] minutes again another one come with so
[1:40:43] in his mind he's so impressed I've
[1:40:47] caught him of color in heaven in the
[1:40:50] atmosphere of love I'm blowing her mind
[1:40:52] and a woman is just a mean look here he
[1:40:59] and he went through twelve different
[1:41:01] roses and different flowers and
[1:41:04] everything after that they finish eating
[1:41:09] and and all of this thing she just I
[1:41:12] mean she just behaving well because the
[1:41:15] in the restaurant and the god on the
[1:41:20] road and started driving and he's
[1:41:22] talking he's happy that he oh I mean yes
[1:41:25] yeah really
[1:41:26] flower the woman with color and she just
[1:41:30] sitting there looking at you and he said
[1:41:34] he was he was you know talking he wanted
[1:41:37] to reach alice's honey you had a good
[1:41:40] evening just taking use of me this is
[1:41:48] then he realized that oh my goodness all
[1:41:51] the flowers i've gone through the window
[1:41:54] so he had parked the car by the side of
[1:41:57] the road and says what's wrong
[1:42:04] that's when she started pouring out her
[1:42:07] heart to him the beautiful part of the
[1:42:11] story he said he was right out of place
[1:42:14] to take out his gun to start defending
[1:42:17] himself and he says the Lord just spoke
[1:42:20] to him shut your mouth
[1:42:25] praise the Lord
[1:42:27] he says I was so glad that I heard his
[1:42:33] voice and as soon as he obeyed the Lord
[1:42:39] the Lord just broke his heart he says I
[1:42:44] never said one word I can't explain to
[1:42:48] you how I turned myself in the driver's
[1:42:51] seat
[1:42:51] and got down in the driver's seat
[1:42:55] I didn't care what my wife was listening
[1:42:59] to me on that
[1:42:59] I started repenting to the Lord because
[1:43:06] he knew what he was doing and things he
[1:43:10] was getting himself involved in that was
[1:43:12] not right but he wanted his wife to
[1:43:15] support him anyway he said he just got
[1:43:19] right down there and he started
[1:43:21] repenting and the woman was sitting in
[1:43:23] the driver's seat
[1:43:24] he said his eyes was closed he was not
[1:43:26] even listening to anything didn't care
[1:43:30] whether she was there because he
[1:43:32] believed he was not speaking to her he
[1:43:33] was pouring out his heart and she
[1:43:36] testified right in that same moment a
[1:43:39] presence came in the vehicle and she got
[1:43:42] down on her seat and started repenting
[1:43:45] to God because the Lord also struck her
[1:43:50] that what she was desiring is not to
[1:43:54] make God happy just to make herself
[1:43:56] happy she said she realized that she had
[1:44:01] a selfishness there because she was not
[1:44:05] wanting to make God happy or she was fed
[1:44:07] up was what would make her happy and the
[1:44:10] Lord just struck but you see what I'm
[1:44:12] talking about
[1:44:13] is that that is the way to solve crisis
[1:44:18] the both of them make the hot right and
[1:44:22] he was able to repent to his wife repent
[1:44:26] before the Lord and she repented before
[1:44:29] the Lord because she realized that look
[1:44:32] God bring us together to make him happy
[1:44:37] and when we want to seek our own
[1:44:40] personal happiness then sometimes we go
[1:44:43] into crisis because it's all about
[1:44:48] making him happy he redeemed us for us
[1:44:52] to live for his pleasure for his praise
[1:44:56] for his glory one Accord in one mind and
[1:45:02] both of these people on the radio talk
[1:45:05] talking their live testimony why because
[1:45:09] God brought him to one one one I wanna
[1:45:12] call that's a truth testimony they're
[1:45:16] not making up for one another petting
[1:45:18] one another on the back he testified I
[1:45:22] just saw myself foolish trying to
[1:45:25] impress my wife with different colors of
[1:45:26] flower when I know my heart is not right
[1:45:35] when a man weighs pleases the Lord when
[1:45:42] a man weighs pleases the Lord that is
[1:45:50] the beginning of the book of Acts we
[1:45:53] cannot be a continuation if we are
[1:45:56] divided in our mind everybody has their
[1:45:59] acted to you and all of the Adam and we
[1:46:01] are just misbehaving in ourselves and we
[1:46:06] claim it to go in a rapture let's come
[1:46:12] back to apostolic foundation
[1:46:19] young people there's no way you're going
[1:46:21] to get the Holy Ghost if you don't land
[1:46:23] to repent of your sin if you don't learn
[1:46:26] to make your heart right before God
[1:46:29] there is no way you receive the Holy
[1:46:30] Ghost if you want the Spirit of God
[1:46:34] living in your heart you have to learn
[1:46:39] to constantly repent of your sin
[1:46:42] constantly ask God to forgive you
[1:46:45] meaning from your heart cry before God
[1:46:47] that is the foundation stone and if you
[1:46:54] reject their their house is going to
[1:46:55] crumble it will never be able to stand
[1:46:58] the storm of life but when your heart is
[1:47:02] right before God never seeking to
[1:47:07] justify yourself being the first one to
[1:47:16] hold the horns of the altar and say I'm
[1:47:18] sorry that is the foundation stone will
[1:47:26] stop you this morning praise the Lord
