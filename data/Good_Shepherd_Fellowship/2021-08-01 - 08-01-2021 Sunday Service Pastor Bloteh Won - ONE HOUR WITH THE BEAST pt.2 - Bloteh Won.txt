jesus name i pray amen amen i just wanted to give a little testimony it happened you can sit down you can see it uh it happened at home over the week and uh there was somebody who was selling some items walking around the neighborhood so he came knocked out our door and uh he introduced himself he's a young man going to college and then uh i'll cut the story short because we had a testimony of almost three hours by the sidewalk just sharing about the lord so uh he told me excuse me it's from utah he goes to school there so i asked him how comes you come to minnesota from utah he said that's what he does over the summer break so i told him well i might buy your stuff but i need to be sure what you're selling and you know and then he told me well he sold it my neighbor i told him well i'll talk to my neighbor you can come back later so he came back later and then unfortunately i didn't talk to my neighbor he was not there so uh we started talking and i asked him about where you come from here utah oh okay and then told me but there i'm a mormon i said oh okay oh that's scared and then i told he asked me what i have met at the moment i say yeah there are some who came to my home and we have had discussions about the bible and we talked about baptism and then he said oh okay then things started rolling from there now yeah he asked him about the baptism of the holy ghost and what baptism means and then i asked him whether he was baptized he said yeah and i asked him do you know jesus said we about we should go he commanded the disciples go and baptize them in the name of the father son on holy ghost he said yeah but i asked him do you know that father is not a name that's right son is not a name then he said well he said but jesus commanded it then i told him yeah but i know he commanded but peter turned around and paul and baptized in the name of jesus christ so you we went from there then i asked him what do you think about that he said well i've heard about you but let me tell you my mind then i said yeah you have the right to tell me what you believe or what you know he said since childhood he has believed that uh just been taught is the name of the father son and holy ghost then i asked him uh what's your name he told me his name i don't want to say it because it's online and then asked him what's your dad's name he told me his dad's name so i asked him if i stand up during your graduation if i stand up and say oh daddy stand up for father's how many would stand up you said many then ask him if i say your dad's name how many will stand and say only one say huh okay yeah so i told him i asked him who do you think the father when jesus was saying go baptize in the name of the father son of hergers who's the father then uh then he asked me then who it is i said jesus christ say wow and that's why the apostles went and preached and baptized the name of jesus christ they did not make a mistake so he said okay so do you want me to leave all that i've been told since childhood and follow what you're telling me i told him no i want you to see what i'm telling you and compare with what you've been taught and see which one is the truth and i don't want you to give you or to give you my own mind i said wow say yeah i think you need to come to youth and talk to me and my parents i said yeah i can come there but i have a big family here i said well i'll ask my parents to host you i said well if you get a chance god willing i'll come so we kept on going like that and then uh he told me how he believes three goals they are separate and you know jesus is here holy ghost and the father is here and they are all three in one and uh but separate but you can see them one at the same time and god works out in a mysterious way because the time he was telling me that and then it was time to go pick up my daughter from work but i was late because i was talking my wife pulled up from the driveway and she left and then he told me uh it's just like you and your wife your uh the bible says when a man leaves his father and mother and joins his wife they become one he said oh okay so that's how it is with the holy ghost and father so i told him huh okay but did you know the bible says the bible says jesus christ when he was asked show us the father he said peter i've been with you this time all this time and you don't know me i and my father are one then he looked at me and said then i asked him huh if you see me you see the father that's what jesus christ said so i asked him huh look at me you are seeing me right yeah my wife just left are you seeing my wife i said no so i said told him you see jesus christ is god amen then we went on i told you to three hours testimony preach testifying about the lord he was telling me inside i was telling him my side and they were saying huh that's how he ended up and saying do you want me forget everything i was taught everything and follow what you're saying all these years i say no no no i want you to see the word that will set you free i don't want to tell you something outside of uh the bible that's not written in the word then he said oh okay i told him well i'll pray for you and then you go and then god sets up conditions or situations whereby you have to step in with faith after that he asked me i've not now i've not even sold any products you know i've not gone for my sales speech all this time of listening to you as i told him god will provide a way if you believe those words came out of my mind and then he asked me huh now tomorrow if i come back i'm supposed to go and sell in the neighborhood where should i go i don't know what led me showed me his ipad and then i told him can you go and try these two streets over here tomorrow if you believe you'll make a sale speech there he said wow thank you god i told him god bless you i'll see you please come back if you want to talk to me more i'll talk to you more about the word of god because we

that are following the service online and had a privilege to visit with uh and marie and rachel and their sister there they moved to a place and wanted us to come and dedicate their little apartment so we spent a little time with them yesterday and and we just want to thank god for what he's doing in the life of his children musicians that will be all for the music this morning now all for the music for now praise the lord and now we want to remind you that uh this evening we will have our convenience service we want to use that also as a time of prayer we realized that uh uh this old uh devil kovac demon is uh on the rise again praise the lord we don't want to be ignorant of that we want to keep ourselves safe do the things that are necessary for you to do to keep yourself safe praise the lord amen we will continue to remind ourselves and uh brother jordan i almost forgot he reminded me we have the questions from the first session of the church age that we've been playing we've been studying during our our sunday school at a sunday school we have those questions printed out and we might not have a copy to give to every individual so grab one or two for your household where you can be able to to i mean fellowship around they answer it together and then uh just see the deacons out there after service and to remind you also of our labor day weekend meetings and we want to remind you that saturday we will have a couple meetings so uh there's a 50 feet for you to register shared with your friends you know that want to come with your wife so their husband we just want to have some time to talk about family values revelation chapter 17 that's where we spoke on wednesday night we want to take uh a verse yet again like i said this verse couldn't leave my mind uh all through the night it was almost like i was sleeping in a weekend i was trying to look for a certain information uh that i studied before uh i listened to it on tape and it was just like a flashback on my mind so i would wake up and then i would turn to this tape and play it and fall asleep and then wake up turn to another one and play it and you know all of that but i just pray that the lord will be able to to take something from yet and make it a blessing to us revelation chapter 17 praise the lord amen and uh revelation chapter 17 we will now read the the entire uh chapter but we want to drop down here uh and take uh our primary verse here is going to be verse 12. our primary verse is going to be verse 12. praise the lord verse 12 and the ten homes which they are revelation 17 verse 12 are ten kings which have received no kingdom but receive power as kings one hour with the beast praise the lord the lord bless you let's see right there in revelation chapter 17. you may have your seed so on wednesday night we started this uh uh little talk on uh one hour with the beast and then we just look a few scriptures that spoke about one hour and uh and and just to go over that again it's not it's not our literal uh system meaning that make one hour no it's not your system meaning that make one hour like i was i was saying on uh talking about jesus asking his disciple why don't you pray with me one hour well you could take that literally in that sense but then when it comes over to this prophecy here in in uh in revelation just like the 11 hour worker you know the 11 hour worker speaks about the last hour before midnight that is the principle that is behind that scripture when jesus talked about the 11 hour worker is the last hour before midnight because when you get to 12 midnight you are already in another day so it speaks of uh uh the last you know the last uh uh the last age believer it speaks about you know what they are so that's the principle i want for us to keep in our mind so as we talk about this one hour with the beast we want for us to keep there in our mind and let's look at verse 8 in that revelation chapter 17. let's look at verse 8. i mean it would just be good to read from verse 1 but i just want to use this to be able to drive our thought here the beast that thou saw with was in its net and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into petition and they that word on the earth shall wonder whose name was not written in the bulk of life from the foundation of the word when they behold the beast wish was and is not and yet is now what i want to grab your attention on is their statement the beast wish was and it's not and yet is praise the lord you know when i when i think about this statement i think about what jesus told neko demons he he says you know uh uh no man has seen you know the the son of man uh he's his wishes which is uh uh uh noun in heaven that's the way he said it in uh us in john chapter three but if you just think about it it is kind of for showing uh there is just there is just a lot of language to this the beast which was and it's not and yet is so keep that at the back of your mind while we study this subject together and talking about uh one hour with the beast my inspiration this morning is getting authority from the wrong influence getting authority getting power from the wrong influence praise the lord that's what i want for us to watch as we will follow uh the the the scriptures that we will be looking at uh this morning let's let's study together a little bit and then now remember that when we when we spoke on wednesday night we we brought ourselves to these kings that receive power but they had no kingdom okay and we said that they were detectors praise the lord because to be a king you must have a kingdom praise the lord but they got their kingship by getting an influence from the beast by spending time with the beast system they got their king shape but they did not have no kidding so what happened here is that it's so easy for uh uh the system to now send them to different regions you can go and take over this place you know and and and be the the you know and remove one passage and put another pastor in remove one you know and just like that this this whole thing we are we are starting with it works both politically and also religiously so as we look at the beast which was and it's not and yet is is a system that started politically but now become a religious power so just follow me in a little bit now we said that uh when jacob was blessing his sons he blessed judah and said judah out of your limbs would come the king judah was given the blessing of kingship are we together amen so we realized that uh just like we we talked judah experienced with tema and and because of that there was no king that rose up in israel until after 10th generation praise the lord until after 10th generation and as we study there in time past we realized the tenth from judah was david are we together that's just a review because we did that uh not too long the tenth from because it was a calling to the lord of god those abominable as judah went with his own daughter-in-law those abominable arts were kept away from the congregation from ten generations so god denied gave israel a king until after 10th generation now so but before that king will come on the scene we see the quest of the people the requests of the people wanting to be a king not because they wanted god's order or they wanted god's word but because they wanted to be like other nations amen they were not desiring they were not crying for a deliverer like when they were in egypt crying for the deliverer all god sent us a deliverer and god sent them moses but this time the cry was to be like other nations praise the lord amen let's be you see this other church this is the way to do it let's do it like that and this other church this is the way to do it and at the end of faith you get something that is completely different now so when that happened what i want for us to watch now let's go in the book of first kings let's go in the book of first king i'm first samuel sorry i'm really really trusting that the lord will be able to help us amen help us i'm i'm a little bit nervous on the subject not because it's just because the other these are the kind of a subject that is so easy to go down the rabbit trail you get on one thing and then you start going and then you you just miss your inspiration now first samuel chapter nine first samuel chapter nine will bring us to the place where samir cried before the lord in in uh uh [Music] first samuel chapter 8 the last verse verse 22 and the lord said unto samuel yaking unto the voice of the people and make them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man onto your city now samuel when the people came to summit and said they wanted a king samia asks them have had done anything wrong because at the time they were on under the leadership of a prophet so right in the ministry of samuel there was both prophet king and priests praise the lord now but they wanted a king a man that is dead as a king to be like other nations so samir you know pleaded with the people but god told him samuel you are not the one that they are rejecting they are rejecting me they are rejecting my leadership let's bring it back to the gospel jesus said why call me lord lord and do it not my commandments praise the lord so it's it's it is at this place where he is both king and lord so as we said on wednesday night our kingship is submissiveness to the word of god amen this is not all about a church organization but this is a spiritual kingdom that we have been called to amen and our king is the lord jesus that is dealing with us in the form of his word praise the lord so to reject the king that the subject of the rejected king is rejecting the leadership of god in your life either rejecting or rebelling against it so let's travel a little bit now as we as we just want to uh uh uh establish our thought here now so yeah god now told samuel go and give them a king if that's what they want you go and give them a king so samuel went out god already gave him a vision because he was a prophet and uh he saw that uh uh kish saul's father has lost his eyes and and and then someone knew exactly where it was but let's go down a little bit because that might give us a too much of a reading let's drop to verse 18. verse 17 and when samuel saul saw the law said unto him behold the man whom as i speak to thee of this same shall reign over my people praise the lord then samuel then saw drew night onto samuel in the gate and said tell me i pray thee where the word is the the see your house is now someone advised saul to go and find the seer which is the prophet that's what the uh a prophet was a seer now he was going to the seer to get get an advise to find his father lost animal now take it in the context now of leadership take it in the context we are the sheep of his pasture amen we are the sheep of his posture that's what we need to be led sons of god are led by the spirit of god that's what the bible says but see the scene that god said god allowed the one that was going to be the leader now the one that was going to be placed as a king for his father animal to be lost so uh i saw father anima was representing israel in the lost form because now they are streeting away from god's principle the father asked the father sheep amen and now saul is going to be ordained as captain so the ability of going to redeem or going to find this lost sheep are we together amen so god in his great mind set a scene amen he said a scene yes i saw you trying to be a good boy and he's looking for his father's sheep now because you're going to see the difference between saul and david because that was the same condition that david was in trying to protect his fathership are we together are you seeing the comparison because god is bringing a man into leadership but yet he's using a natural scene to prepare that man the man is driving into that natural scene but there is a supernatural thing that is happening behind are we together amen so saul goes about looking for his father's sheep and someone said oh the seer is up there now he's going to the prophet are we together now when he when he got to the prophet as we read down here uh uh okay verse 19 and samuel saul and god already spoke to simon yes the man there praise the lord yes the man the same thing happened in jesse's house he tried to go there not the first one god said no the second one when david king god said this is the man yeah god is revealing to samuel that's the man i told you about the people want a king that's the man i told you about are we together so let's let's just stay together now i don't want to lose you because i'm beginning to feel the connection amen and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for years shall eat with me today and tomorrow i will let you go so samia is going to keep him in his presence what are we talking about one hour with the beast it's a time spain with the beast so samya is going to keep him all through the night till the next morning are we together and that time spent with the prophet is going to change his life you eat with me today and tomorrow i will let you go and uh and will tell thee all that is in thine heart the ministry of a prophet i will tell you everything that is in your heart amen when he goes he goes to me samia he's uh uh uh you know he want to see samia to to inquire of samuel but even before he said what he want to see the prophet for the prophet is telling him i will tell you everything that is in your heart so he did not even ask the prophet the prophet is descending him right there are we together and as for the eyes that were lost three days how would the prophet know except god had revealed it to him are we together and as for the night that is lost three days ago set not the mind on them for they are fun praise the lord now you have to realize you go back to the beginning of first samuel before samya came on the scene there was no open vision which means god was not dealing with no man like the way he's dealing with samuel here right now this is an open vision the prophet looking right at you and he's telling you what is in your heart [Music] and we have that same word in our midst the word of god discern the intent of the heart praise the lord are we together amen now so the prophet tell him all of this you know uh even the sheep that you come running for that was lost three days ago don't bother they have already found it and he says and on whom is the desire of israel the desire of israel which means what the people have been crying about we want a king it's in every house people are talking about it we want a king all the nation has king our church is not like this oh we want a king is it not on thee and on their father's house and saw answer and said i'm not a benjamite now so what is this where is the contention there where where is the subject of talk they are wanting a king is he he's telling he's telling saul you are the desire of the people the people are looking for king you are you are the desire but saul being and a trained jewish boy in the world knew that a king must come from the trap of judah and not from the tribe of benjamin so now he said wow he stepped back a little bit and said wow am i not a benjamite according to the law if we should get a king you must come from the house of judah so saul immediately knew there was something his his inner conscience knew that he was out of place for this office but one hour with an authority can influence your life even if you are not called to do that work are we together now so saul said i'm i'm not out of benji might okay that's that's our inspiration then let's let's go further now first samuel chapter 10. first samuel chapter 10 and that we just we just want to we want to go very quickly yeah and you can you can re read the rest of the story praise the lord amen and as you as you also you will also realize this as you study now i'm giving you some homework here when when saul annoyed samir he anointed samuel no when samuel anointed saul praise the lord i could feel the correction in your spirit praise the lord when samia anointed saul uh i'm trying to i'm trying to find a place here but you'll find it right here in chapter 10 he took he took a vow and he he poured the oil on uh on saul and he says i have anointed you captain over israel when he anointed david he took a horn and he annoyed david two different two different type of anointing are we together but this is what i want to bring you in this uh in this chapter 10. i want i want you to see something here in chapter 10 chapter 10 verse 1 that's where some you're annoyed so then when you go down the scripture says verse 10 and when they came here to the hell behold a company of prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him who saw and he prophesied among them praise the lord and it came to pass when all that knew him before time saw that they even wondered behold he prophesied among the prophets then the same went out people said wow all that knew him before time when he saw him no in a sense that they never knew him to be among the prophets they never knew him to be hauling a religious office but yara said now he has an anointing on him he's prophesying with the prophets are we together the spirit of god came upon him he prophesied among them and it came to pass all i knew him before he prophesied among the prophet then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish it saw also among the prophets now let's drop down a little bit the proverb you know it became now a proverb among the people wow it saw now also among the prophets wow you know a benjamin wow i thought it was supposed to be you know levites and uh you know uh from the tribal judah or all of that you know it started becoming a saying gossip did not start it now it started ever since praise the lord now watch this also that i want to bring you to this place verse 14 when saw uncle said unto him into his seven well let's go uh to seek the ass and and when this and when and when we saw that their were nowhere we came to samyam and and saw onku verse 15 said tell me now he's talking to saul so uncle is talking to saul i pray what samir said unto you now watch this principle very kingly and saul said unto his uncle he told me he told us plainly that their ashes were found but of the matter of the kingdom where of samuel speak he told him that so you realize that so it's not he's not having conviction he's not having conviction samia told him are you not a desire of ezra he said am i not a benji might verse 10 i mean chapter 10 verse 1 the bible says samuel then samuel took the vial of oil and poured it upon his head kissed him and said unto him is it not because the lord have anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance so he was anointed he got among the prophets he prophesied but yet he's not convicted his uncle wow you were with you were with the seer you're with the prophet what did he say oh you know he told me that the ship was lost three days ago and where i would find it he told me everything about it but the main thing that the prophet met him for he never said anything why because there was not an inner conviction there was not an inner conviction there was not a birth no one is is it's hard for people to testify of their christian faith when there is not a birth we can talk about the church is completely different than to talk about our experience but he prophesied he was even anointed but from the very first question am i not a benjamite shows that there was something haunting saw in his inner in his inner man in his inner most part of his being but one hour with the beast now you have to realize that biblical sample as a symbol this means power okay when moses spent a time in the burning bush it changed his life just that little time he spent in the burning bush it means that it's a time of focus the time that has grabbed your attention can you imagine saul thinking in all of his mind the prophet said spend the night with me can you imagine he never slept i came right in front of this man he told me my father name he told me the day that the sheep was lost oh my goodness will you be able to have a good sleep before a man that knows all your life so laying down there oh my goodness what a privilege i ate with a prophet i eat with the prophet i slept with him he's building his resume he has enough to build his resume to prove that i mean the message you know you you have you are yes you can tell me say you saw have you slept with the prophet you slept with him and i mean he could build a lot of story because nobody was there where he and the prophet he could he could function his own thing everybody would be leaving and the prophet told me this and the prophet told me that and the prophet said this to me i hope you see where i'm going with this praise the lord i hope you see where i'm going with this amen just one hour with the beast these men became king but yet they had no kidding i will come back to that there are some there are some historical uh uh things we would like to look at in this in their life but this is just to be able to establish our thought getting influence i mean getting authority from the wrong influence just by association just by associating praise the lord we have to realize now relationship chapter 17 is a continuation let me let me help you to be help us to be able to look at uh uh uh the the whole subject here in revelation revelation chapter 12. let's go there a little bit and what we want to achieve here is you know is to be able to bring all our experience back to the word of god amen not just to fall in a sensation oh i tremble oh yeah at that meeting i cried oh yeah no bring it right back to the world bring all your experience back to the world because if it is not aligning with the word you are influenced by the wrong spirit if you have a haunting question bring it to the word the same one i told samir how long his father's sheep was lost that same one can tell you when did that thing started you know the christian church under the dispensation of grace we are saved by grace that that has become a slogan of the church but i wish the think that everything goes because god grace has saved us we can do whatever we want to do well i was saved by grace there is no weapon form against me will prosper you know when people start finding those defensive uh uh uh quotation of the bible it always shows there is something they are struggling over because it is not how much you cut god's word that made god to back his word god is already obligated to his word are we together now so in in scripture here you realize that in the book of revelation there there are three women that the bible talks about three women but one appears in revelation chapter 12. that's that's this woman great the bible says she was a great woman also and she had uh uh the son let's read our revelation chapter 2 verse 1 and that appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and she's uh and upon her head where towards ties we know that this will go back to the jewish church she will go back to the jewish church she could also type the gentile church but there is there is a lot of jewish element in him now and then in revelation chapter 17 it talks about another mystery woman mr babylon two great woman but there is a woman that was talked about earlier in revelation chapter one the one that had her pipes given the bride suffers in revelation chapter 1 honor the identification of christ because when john looked back he saw one in the midst of the church one in the midst of the seven golden candlestick but that very same one that he saw which was christ he also had a female representation because the one in the midst of the seven golden candlestick was gathered around the pipes so it was christ in bright form because god has kept he has kept that right from the beginning genesis 1 26 god made man in his image male and female he made man in his image but there was two representation of that one image male and female are we together praise the lord am i bringing too much information amen well if you uh looking for the prosperity gospel i think this is one of the best one amen we're not talking about money we're talking about how you can prosper in your walk with god by watching out from being under the wrong influence praise the lord amen so as as we watch this together now let's go now this this spoke about here in revelation and then revelation chapter 12 as we read about this great woman she was with chai which means she was uh she was pregnant she was about to give birth and there was a dragon a red dragon that wanted to to devote her child uh uh you know uh and and out of there so as the scripture goes on it brings us to verse nine and the great dragon was cast out that all sapping called the devil and satan one person one person he was that all stepping we can trace him back to genesis chapter three that all second called the devil sit on which deceiveth the whole world now so we identified uh we identified the great the the great dragon here are we together so identifying the great dragon there is a place i want to get to here so we identified the great dragon just bear with me in a little bit here because what what i want to catch here or i want to i want to take up with you here is that right from revelation 13 is announced has to deal with the beast system now god starts to show the best system that was once revealed to daniel in the book of daniel we won't have all the time to go after the scripture but you will realize from from from revelation chapter 13 he starts to show the beast system and it runs over to revelation chapter 14. it goes he there with it a little bit on a revelation chapter 15. revelation chapter 16 speaks about the vowels revelation chapter 17 until revelation chapter 18. so right from there you will see little by little he's talking about how he's going to deal with this beast system now you you will get the picture when we we uh we go back to the beginning let's let's read this let me let me help myself here a little bit let me let me release myself a little bit by just reading some few quotes to you are we together are we together let's read uh uh wow why am i holy ruler now in genesis genesis was the sea chapter where all the seas were sown everything that you find in the world today came out of genesis actually that's what the word genesis means the beginning the seed are we together everything begins back there in the beginning well now it's just like so in a crop now if you watch what kind of a seed you got you got in no matter what it looks like when is this high you will have to see what it is once the seed you will see it will be when he come to see praise the lord amen and jesus i mean paul says be now deceived god is not one whatsoever a man soweth that he would reap is a general principle of life everything that we do we are either planting seeds or we are reaping one whatever we do is a general principle of life we are either planting seeds or we are in the process of the growth of a seed that we have planted or we are at the harvest are we together it's a general principle of life we have to you we have to watch that jesus said whatever other word we speak it will come to fruit whatever thought we think in our mind we come to fruit by our actions praise the lord are we together the bible says children obey your parents for this is the the word of god and also it's a commandment with promise what does that mean it's a commandment that has a seed principle in it it has a seed principle in it praise the lord because if we get in rebellion to our our parents what you're doing is that you are sowing seed to reap when you start having children genesis 1 11 every seed will bring forth of eight kinds are we together so genesis is the c chapter let's go down again and take another one trying to do god service without his will the beast from the beginning he was the beast at the garden of eden amen now so we see here revelation 12 identified him that great dragon that was cast out that was cast out would take also uh isaiah chapter 14 where he was cast out of heaven and before he was cast out of heaven to be there to be the old serpent he was first called lucifer was cast out that oh serpent called the devil satan now so we see here he was the beast from the beginning wish was the beast at the garden of eden yeah he's the beast at the end he that was that's what the scripture says the beast that was and it's not and yet it is it's the same beast just changing system changing nation the same spirit that kept israel in captivity for the same reason in egypt was the same one that kept them in captivity by the assyrians it was the same reason that kept them in captivity by the babylonians praise the lord it was the same reason and the same spirit that kept them in captivity by the roman empire are we together so the beast at the beginning was the beast in the garden of eden he was the beast at the end and it showed that he's a religious person a relate a a a denomination that made a denomination and it comes right through the same trill is just traveling from genesis all the way to revelation because genesis is the sea chapter is sword abyss he was more subtitled than all the beasts of the field that see was sold in genesis and yet he comes up in revelation as the beast at the end are we together let's read this one also from mike uh mark of the beast book daniel saw the same vision 800 years before this he saw the vision he saw those be separated one from another in the beginning of their gentile ruling and here they are john seeing the same thing the beast that was and it's not but yet it is it is not but yet it is which means it's not now in a political system but it is in a religious system it is not but yet it is are we together praise the lord amen so the same beast that moses saw by vision in the garden of eden is the same beast that dania sought now uh john is seeing the same thing here for down here it was a political system that represented himself in the head of gold the breadth of any uh uh uh the breast of sivir the the the leon surprise and the feet of iron that was how daniel saw it but yet when john saw the same beast he's seen it as a different power that a woman is riding on are we together okay i knew that that i missed something here i knew that i missed something but let's go to genesis chapter 10. genesis chapter 10 praise the lord i really not started preaching here though i'm just i'm trying to find how to take root in what i want to say so i'm just laying the foundation here genesis chapter 10 when you read genesis chapter 10 right here we see a man that is emerging here and he comes out of he comes out of let me say it this way let me let me find the right right way to say noah had three sons and one of his son disobeyed his father a disgrace's father let me say that way let me just say that way because i don't want to go into anything so and god came down and he dared with him by cursing kenneth and ham and cana and then ham had this son called kush now verse eight kuch is the father of nero nimrod he began to be a mighty one on the earth praise the lord now so let's let's trace it back because his very name nimrod means rebellion his very name nimra becomes rebellion and this is the guide that is now going to be the bible say he became a mighty one in the earth he was might he was a mighty hunter before the lord if you really go back in and said it on that verse it was not being a mighty hunter before the lord then it's not meaning that he was in the word of god okay he was a mighty hunter that was defiant to god this is the man that that they were going to build this tower of barbell to reach to the heavens but he became a mighty one in the earth where did he got his authority from from a root of rebellion he just suffered and became a mighty one in the earth are we together so as we as we follow this we see here and then that uh uh he was very defined to the lord a mighty hunter before the law wherefore he said even as as nero is is a mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel praise the lord the beginning of his kingdom was barbell now we have to watch here that the serpent saw a sea of doubt against god's word one word he dropped into god's commandment god says the day you eat of death you will die you will surely die he says the day you eat of it you shall not that three-letter word was a seed of discrepancy that would change the cost and it it was it was a seed of this tree princess that would make eve to stop in her tracks and say i wonder what this mean one hour will the beast influence her life one moment by just stopping and say what you said i wonder what does that mean are we together it would change the edom of god it would change the perfection a garden of peace and perfection will now become a guiding of disorder because a wrong seed was sold praise the lord amen and that would cause the first death the first murder that was ever that ever took place on the earth where king would kill ibel that would bring about the first line when god asks him where's your brother abel he told the first lie a seed was sword are we together and this little seed of doubt sea of unbelief that was sold noun is becoming a kingdom in genesis 10. that little seed of deception is now growing it grew up it first started by passing the ball god came down adam what have you done that's the wife you gave me woman what have you done that's the second you gave me that seed started pushing things around then it became a lie king tore a lie then it became a murder and it starts it starts growing it starts growing and now after the act and now becoming a kingdom from norway nero is rising to become a mighty man in defiance of god praise the lord the beast that was and it's not but yet is so yeah we'll see this this money ketum that has that that has built in and all of these people in one car we want to build a town that reached heaven speaking one language they are determined because they are honoring an influence of a mighty rebellious king we build something better than the boat of noah if there can't ever come at judgment again it would never get to us something stronger than the board of noah that that rocket thing that he built up there we need to get something stronger if there's a god behind the clouds we can get to him there's just only one way it is by the sheer blood oh praise the lord amen you love the lord this morning let's give the lord a hand of praise amen these waters will be praised is because you and myself we are in we are in battle with this defying spirit we meet it every day we come we come in contact with it every day they want to change our way of life we want to it want to detect to us you have to remember it does not have a kingdom it's a detecting spirit lucifer said i will ascend my throne above the stars of god how do you have a throne if you don't have a kingdom but he was going to build a throne and then use his evil influence and draw people intimidate them god knows that when you do this you'll be just like him he robbed them of their deity because they were already gods because they came right from the lineage of god he made them in his image but to become more smarter he robbed them of their divine attributes are we together praise the lord amen amen this is not you know this is not against any and then anybody is just it just thought as i was thinking of thinking about this yesterday studying a little bit it just hit my mind it's almost just like a seminary a man goes to seminary and he goes to spend four years six years every year he graduates and then he get a diploma to become a pastor but he don't have a church but he gave him a diploma you are a pastor you are a shepherd but he don't have sheep but because he have associated with a system that system has given him power you see the concept are you seeing the concept that's the reason why the principle of the mark of the beast structurally is the mark in the forehead is acknowledging the mark in the in the hands is association one hour with the beast praise the lord amen that's the reason why as as believers as as uh as children of god you know we we we don't we you know as much as we love the word of god and we love the mysteries of the hour and we love everything we must keep our eyes on that word keep your eyes on that word because it was the very same word that satan talked to eve and he just twisted it dropped a little doubt in it it has to line up with the scripture all the time are we together praise the lord praise the lord so so one hour with the beast just like i said the principle is authoritate wrong wrong authority by affiliation so here is saul now he has all of these questions in his heart because he know by the word of god a king must come out of judah he's of the trap of benjamin he spent night with with with uh samuel the prophet he he prophesies with the he got out there and broke in the spirit speaking in tongues prophesying in interpretation you know and he's enjoying the spirit of god while doing all of this down in his heart he's asking himself wow wow is this me wow wow praise the lord praise the lord that's the reason why we must we must be very conscious of our heart amen we must be very conscious of our heart we must like like solomon say we must guide our heart and the only way to guide your heart is use the word you can use anything different so saul was among the prophets you also see back in the book of numbers you see quran and dayton we have gone over that before why did they rose against moses the reason why they rose up against moses because they were they were all born of the levite tribe they were leviticus as much as moses was born of the levi tribe and the blessings of jacob the priesthood was supposed to go to levi so you are from the levi tribe i'm from the levi tribe why should you take yourself special over us the bible says they were gang sailors in a sense they spread this thing among the people we were down there suffering in egypt moses he ran away came back with a majestic in his hands and and and and everything you know is is he and his brother aaron the other one leading us and and and uh uh cora was able to to to warm up the people wrap the people up in in emotion i mean he raised the spirit of the people up moses wants to make himself special moses wants to make himself so so a a a a a a spirit of rebellion enter in him he was on the liver trap that's right sacrificed the eighth day correct but he never met the burning bush he never met the burning bush he did not have a commission he followed moses saw the supernatural walk through the red sea on the other side and he's challenging the very thing that deliver him are we together amen yeah praise the lord brother branham talked preach about anointer once in the end time talks about doing god a service without his will you know all of those are messages for us to to study you know and and uh review these thoughts reveal as the holy spirit you know uh will be dealing with your heart you know uh i mean jesus said uh uh you know uh you know many will come to me in that day and say lord having not done this lord having not done that lord he said depart from me you workers of iniquity i didn't even knew you but everything that they did was was was things that you could say this is of the law are we together so you see corolla and dayton now think about uh uh what is his name aaron he was the very brother of moses the one that god said aaron will be your spook man then later on god shall bring aaron and his sons into the tabernacle into the priesthood you you watch them presented as priests in the absence of moses the people put pressure on aaron and he billed him a golden calf god called the name of aaron to moses your brother aaron would be your prophet but when he came on a pleasure he turned to idolatry and just like i said the the age that we are living in the age is on a pressure we talk about the tear pool we talk about the manifestation of the bride the spoken word ministry we are under so much pressure until the people are building images they are looking for the superman to to lead the bride oh this brother has this this you know he's the man of the the solomon he's the man of the hour pleasure the people put pressure we don't know if moses is going to come back this is 40 days since he's gone every time moses went to to the chopper of of of pharaoh every time he met pharaoh aaron was right there he was the mouthpiece of moses he was the one talking on behalf of the prophet but yet when he came under pressure he built an image and told the people here is a god that had brought you out the very man i was standing beside moses when he raised his hand and the red sea potted is now giving the people a golden calf to wash it why because he came honor pressure praise the lord are we together amen why is quiet in here praise the lord i hope that the holy spirit can use this quietness and just wave into our spirit open our eyes deal with our heart we talk about one goal god has one goal and you know what that goal is to have preeminence god won't go he wants to have preeminence thou shalt have no other god before me don't stop at the church don't stop at the pastor you have to meet the living god because he is a living god and his glory he will give to no man he is a living god he's not a system he's not just a doctrine he's not a core of other he's the god of life and he still live the same yesterday today and forever the church comes on a pressure the people give themselves a golden car they are turning to different things it's either we build a movement to run after and we have seen many of them has risen and they have just fought and collapsed praise the lord anything that man may would die a natural death it will have some time to live you know it will it will wrap the people up oh yeah we are the bride oh yeah we are the rapture people you know uh you know i mean many of them has raised up and now those very same people are now turning to idolatry they are either fighting against the very thing they believe oh they are you know they are making something different out of it trying to look for the messiah one hour with the beast just one hour with that peace system praise the lord see john chapter one i realized that i was close here i'm trying to to beat around the bush because i want to get into something but i don't know if i have all the time so i don't want to i don't want to get in it and then i realize that i don't have time and when i look at the time i know that i don't have time so let's take some john chapter 1 saint john chapter 1. saint john chapter 1 are we together amen you know i was looking at something this morning as i was studying oh let me let me let me let me say this to you i know i went over it but you will realize that there were seven kingdoms or seven nations that god used to to to discipline israel every time they got into a rebellious state the first time when they got jealous of joseph when jacob's son got jealous of joseph's gift he led them to egypt praise the lord amen the second time was uh uh the the assyrians israel went into captivity under the assyrians and and and that was word uh uh the samaritans lost their identification because one time samira was part of israel but when that captivity came and with the years that the people spin into captivity it was a gentile nation that was ruling the people so their jewish religion was now mixed with gentile idol worship they brought all of those things in now sacrificing to children and all of those things they make they make a part of it and then right after that we realize that we see where uh uh ahab came on the scene got married to jezebel and just dragged israel down in a dolly train even though god sent elijah the prophet build the the the the altar of the lord and all of that to restore the house of the people but the people were so caught under this system that even when elijah left on the scene they went from one rebellion to another rebellion and god had to raise up nebuchadnezzar so it was egypt they assyrians babylon but all of these nations they were all under the inspiration of babel that's the reason why you see babylon keeps sufficing in the bible it was it was not but yet it is it started back then in genesis 10 as barbell it came in the middle of the book as babylon and for a while it disappeared but then it suffers him back in the book of revelation as a spiritual kingdom mystery babylon are we together so then right after babylon we realized that god raised up the meats and the persians the mies and the persians came that was word daniel became the friend to darus the king that knew that daniel was serving the the truth and living god when when uh when and daniel was placed in the in the lion then under the persian that was where we find esther god raising up esther to defend the children of israel but god took israel or every time they were caught in rebellion god raised up a nation to span them back they would go into captivity they would be enslaved to their own rebellious spirit are we together and then god will send a deliverer he'll bring a prophet on the scene or he will do something deliver the people and then they will go back again and then after the meeting persian the greece came and then from there the roman came but you realize is that seemed old babylon spirit that seemed rebellious spirit that started from genesis chapter 3 and became a kingdom in genesis chapter 10 it keeps changing form and we are in a spiritual roman kingdom that is influenced by the roman church around the world the kingdom has become a church it's called the mother of all church catholic the universal church we are the first church we could take time and just go through all of those scripture but i i just i want to keep you in the in the in the inspiration of the day praise the lord are we together amen oh what a wonderful jesus we serve amen now these are getting their influence by association one hour with the beast they have been made kings with our kingdom but the the true church of god the born-again church of god the sons and daughters of god john said over here in first i mean john chapter 1 praise the lord amen saint john chapter 1. in the beginning was the word and that is the original seed god original seed is his word the word of god is the original seed of god amen begin with the word of god there is no way you can fail plan that word that word there is no way it will produce nothing else but god himself praise the lord in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the sin was in the beginning we talked about that you know the c principle begins with the word you will you will come out with the word all things were made by him without him nothing was made i was made in him was life and the life was the light of man and john went on and on praise the lord verse 9 that was the true light which lighted every man that commented in the word he was in the word and the word was made by him and the word knew him not praise the lord i i i was listening to a testimony of of a brother that got converted from from from islam to uh to christianity this was one of the chapters that really hit him he he he struggled with jesus being god and and but then when he went as the law was dealing with him when he came closer i mean this scripture just he says wow so because in the quran the quran said jesus is the word the quran says that jesus is the word so for him to see here that is the word that created everything then he has to believe that jesus created everything okay that would be for another day that was just a parenthesis let's read him he came to his own and his own receive him that but as many as receive him he gave to them give he power there's another power here that is given revelation 17 these kings god power one hour with the beast but there is another group of people here that power is also giving to [Laughter] praise the lord as many as receiving to them gave he power to become sons and daughters of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood none of the weight of the flesh none of the way of god of men but they were born of god praise the lord so yeah honor the beast system you get power by association honor this kingdom you get power by birth you don't have to become member of the church for you to get power you get power when you are born again the power of the believer comes by birth your birth is your authority your birth is your position praise the lord one guess power by association even around the even around the message we have seen the scene people come they sit down they associate they learn the quotes they learn the pres the principle they become a minister nobody i mean nobody can tell anybody who is a minister on that that one thing you cannot tell a man one and more many things praise the lord but we have to see the principle here the principle here is that the word is what rooted the word is the king so if a man cannot subject himself to the word because we are born by the word the incorruptible seed of god that's where the believer power comes from from his birth from his new birth now by church association never putting names on the book but by that birth that comes back the word that show you your true identity in god it takes you beyond nations that take you beyond kingdoms and family and tribes and take you right back to the heart of god that you are a child of god so we don't have power by association we have power by birth the believer power comes by birth it comes by the new birth that's the reason why the new birth is not an idea the new birth is not a feeling the new birth is not just a a dry eye confession and the new birth is a work that god does in ub all of all things have passed away and everything became new praise the lord you see that's the reason why many christians walk just like saul they enjoy the revival they enjoy the presence of god but there is a haunting question in their heart they keep dealing with things that they know is not right they keep walking in there hoping that god will take it away but i'll tell you that god is more than evil praise the lord god is more than able you have to meet him just like jacob date jacob got tired he knew he had the birthright he knew he had a blessing but this spirit of deception could not leave him he says i got to nail this thing down he had to meet god you have to meet the angel if you don't bless me i will not leave you serving god is not it's not by affiliation all the father has given me will come that's what jesus said and i will not lose one that's why he said can we say praise the lord amen what a wonderful jesus we serve our power the power of the church comes by birth that's the reason why we must strive to get back to the world that was the cry in the preview of the bride stay in line get back to the word one hour with the beast one hour in the wrong environment can influence your life for the worse remember i like i said it's not it's not a 20 you know system any hour i'm talking about i'm talking about uh a focus of time it never took one hour for eve it just took a meaning it never took one hour for lot's wife it just took a turn on her shoulder and she turned to a pillow of swords are we together just close here i'm tempted to go into something as i said but it would take it would take uh it would it would take us more time than we want to spend so let's just let's just think on these things like paul says you know we have messages of an influence of one man on another you know whatever i'm talking about isaiah chapter six the friendship between uzir and and and isaiah the prophet you know we we have all of that that we've been taught you know but you you you have to you have to you have to narrate down this way you know your influence can even can either reduce your authority or it can give you a wrong authority if it's a wrong influence as many as believe give he power give he power we know that uh uh uh uh about that birth the power comes by the birth praise the lord and we realize that what it is is the thing that brings the identification that we can look at ourselves and know that we we are sons and daughters of god we have always been sons and daughters of god it's that quickening power that brings the reality it brings the true recognition you wake up to the reality oh my goodness i've been playing around all of this why and people wonder while the church is in its condition that is in the last this church has just become a disgrace to christianity that uh that uh uh uh uh uh uh miracle-seeking uh uh uh preachers will have to to get into enchantment and get themselves into all sorts of voodoo things just to perform miracles prosperity seeking preachers will have to just will just become a motivational speaker and inspire the people god will bless you in all this that's the condition of the last day church has become a disgrace all of the mega building and the media churches that we have they have all become cages of unclean birds the adulteration and and on clean living that role in those systems people walking with an anointing preaching and yet they know in their heart romans chapter one we were close with that musician you can come if god is dealing with your heart take it as an opportunity don't wink your shoulder to god and think you can just get by by being a church member and showing up for service on wednesday night or sunday morning not if god is dealing with your heart like i said it's an opportunity he's calling you into partnership praise the lord romans chapter one [Music] let's take the egg [Music] romans chapter one are we together [Music] oh praise the lord praise the lord paul says romans chapter 1 verse 16 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jews first and also to the gentiles for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written that just shall live by faith for the wrath of god is revered from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of man who uphold men who uphold the truth in righteousness and unrighteousness god wrath is revealed against them because that which maybe know of god is manifest in them for god have shown it unto them for the invisible things of god from the creation of the world are clearly seen being honest too by the things that are made even the internal power of god and the godhead so that they are with our excuse because when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but they became vain in their imagination and their foolish heart was docking professing themselves to be wise they were fools they changed the glory of the incorruptible god into an image made like a corruptable man or bird or four-footed beasts all creeping things wherefore god also gave them over to unclaimed thoughts uncleanness through their lust the loss of their heart to dishonor their body now you see that's that was the situation saul was caught in the question down in his heart kept troubling him it kept troubling him so as soon as he saw that david was rising to frame that unsettled question in his heart now turned to jealousy and jealousy turned to bitterness and bent on the stream to a desire to kill david because he had a wall in his heart that was empty even though he had inspiration speaking in tongues preaching the word of god but he had a void in his heart that was empty and it turned to jealousy it turned to bitterness it turned to haunting the life of devi with a javelin until he did not became a shreem of it anymore he made david the enemy of the kingdom he slowly moved into detectorship even when samuel the prophet told him the law has rejected you because you have rejected the word of god he knew that god rejected him but he was still holding to the throne say exercise in power say giving command paul says because god has made those things known that the invisible things of god the people has changed the glory of god to corruptable man and beast he said wherefore god give them to unclean cleanliness they are lust for them to dishonor their bodies between themselves the ones that hold the truth of god in lines they worship and save the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever for this cause god gave them over to violent affliction for even their women has changed the natural use into that wish is against nature praise the lord and likewise also the man living the natural use of the woman you can see you can see the spirit of rebellion in this age you can see how the people have gone far from god because the pornographic industry is prospering more than the [Music] church because the people has rejected the spirit of god so god is turning their heart over until a man is becoming like beasts they can pierce hair pierced nose pierced earpiece i mean man is just man is just becoming violent and even violent to himself it shows how much the holy ghost is leaving the generation the people are not coming to conviction under the word of god the word of god is just used for entertaining they sit down they're not their heads even when the holy spirit is present dealing with your heart they cannot press through like jacob did for this cause god gave them unto vader affliction for even the women that change the natural use change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise the man leaving the natural use of the woman burning in their lust towards one another men with men working that which is unseen and what is happening the government has come right behind this and they say you have to take it you have to take it this is their choice of life you have to take it and that's what that's what the system is the system will use the government to push us into this what's in it the suffering code the supreme court of the land that satisfied a gay right the highest court of the land you know what is what he's saying he's saying that we have accepted this these things that is coming towards us when once this nation stare like an innocent lamb held religious freedom the bible was the book and they still remained a book above every book but she had kicked the bible out of schools [Music] one hour with the beast has changed the nation from a christian nation to the west adonation every every idol comes in and creep they will fight against christians gave the muslims right one hour with the beast don't entertain the devil brother said if you stop to pick him up if you give him the back seat he will come to the front and when he gets to the front he will take over your steering and he will drive you where he want to carry you don't even give him a ride oh praise the lord
