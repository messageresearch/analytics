looking to bring you honor looking to bring you glory father no glory to any one person but you father no honor brought to anyone but you father Lord did you just look down and see from Heaven this morning morning may our Praises be acceptable to you fathers Lord may you just be pleased father we just thank you there's opportunities we give you thanks amen and amen it's just so wonderful to be here once again this morning Saints why don't you all just have a seat for just a moment my goodness Saints we could we could walk out of here right now we could be dismissed and walk out and we've already had Church I I felt it from the very start this morning the presence of God I could feel it back in the office and don't take that in any way special to me what I mean is everyone here came with their flame of fire and the fire from this Sanctuary was so great I could feel it back there it's nothing special about me or special about the song leader but God was so pleased with each and every one of you this morning he came down with his presence and he's here he's here it tells me that all of you came ready you came ready to meet your God came ready to meet your father come and commune with him and God recognized that by coming down communion with you it doesn't have to do with the building it doesn't have to do with the people that you that are in the building has to do with the fact that you brought the presence of God with you this morning and he was so pleased look down on our worship look down on the praise they said I gotta go down and meet them this morning he said I can't stay away from them it's just too perfect my goodness we want to get a few formalities out of the way and just and then just move on with the service we have a visitor in our midst and you've um our sister Grace I don't know I'm probably saying that incorrectly but it's wonderful to have you here thank you [Applause] you feel welcome here with us we have a prayer request from our sister Bila asking prayer for her sister-in-law Who's down with covet her brother is doing well now it says thank God for his mercies so we see this thing and just moving around it no surprise to God the devil's got a little bit upset because he's lost in one spot and he'll lose again so let's just take a moment just pray for this this should be the sister-in-law Heavenly Father Lord we come before you once again this morning Lord you father we don't come asking anything amiss but we come asking upon your promises but he said by your stripes we are made whole he said if any two or three are gathered together in my name there I'll be also he said if we can agree upon any one thing father you said you'd come and and bring it to pass father so Lord we just come asking for the healing of sister be the sister-in-law this covet viruses struck her and father just giving her a little trouble but would he has asked for a full Deliverance father believing the Lord that you've already done the work father Lord just waiting for the praise report to come forth out of it we give you thanks for that in Jesus name amen you know Saints this morning I was sitting in the back office and watching and listening to your praises and watching brother Joshua here lead our service and I watched Little Grace Get Up and sing that song and you know there was such a sense of I don't want to say Pride it's maybe the wrong term but just such a oh just something about it just saying Lord wow look at what you have done I'm so glad to be that I'm able to be a part of this you know you know I was talking about Ariel last week and we were just talking about different stages that we've seen the church go through and coming through and and sometimes we look at ourselves right now and we look at our current problems and we're like wow I can't believe we're still having all these problems and this and that and these little things you know they're just a constant part of life and and whatnot and we get maybe a little bit frustrated more than we should because we feel like maybe ourselves or other people or the church should be in a different place but I we began to just talk about where God has brought us from you know not even even individually but even as a church is that you know I haven't been here that long I've just been here about four and a half years or so yeah even in that amount of time there's been such a change such a change God has done such a work here you know we were talking about it and we were saying you know the number of people we have here on a Wednesday night and this is to anyone who can't make it on Wednesday you work you're far you're distant you got whatever you got going on that's not it the point but the the handful of people we see here on a Wednesday used to be a very full Sunday morning and yet look at us here this morning the building's almost full [Music] that's not anything we did it's not any one man's achievement this is what God has done this is what God's done only God could bring so many different people from so many different places so many different walks of life and bring them together in unity in one place like this I wanted to I said a couple of we meant to do this a few years ago after covet ended and we thought we were going to have some anniversary services and things and I'm not going to make it very long just real quick I just want to make a point I sent three pictures to the back there and I took paper I took a few pictures of this building before we renovated this is the sanctuary for those of you who weren't here back then even four years ago even two years ago this is a sanctuary facing from that way in is the sanctuary keep going go to the foyer just one more that is what the foyer looked like you can go ahead and take it down you see Saints this is what happens when God is working when God is working on our lives when God is working on a church when God is working on anything it's no time at all but what someone who knew you in your past would come back to visit and look around and not be able to believe it's the same place they once visited before it's almost unrecognizable even to me I look at the pictures and I go I know I was there I help make the changes [Music] but it's still almost like a double take is how is how is it even possible that that is the same place and yet that's what God is doing with each of us every single day every single moment so let's not forget that about ourselves or about the people next to us [Music] many of us are habits or if we remember people as they were in their past and we treat them such but I ask you open your eyes again take a good look and see what God has done and you'll realize you should be treating those people differently because they're not the same people they once were you're not the same person you once were God is working God is changing us and that that's just so inspired me this morning to look out and see God is working there's life in the church there's there's positive change happening coming it's it's it's just so amazing let's not get hung up on the fact that we still have things to work on let's focus on the fact of how far God has brought us all right now get off of that and move on with the service it just I love it so much I love it so much I love to see God and what God's doing it's just so unbelievable um let's sing that song One More Time that what was the first not the song we were just singing the one before brother Joshua He Knows My Name you can give me the words that help me with it Saints my singing skills aren't as good as some foreign [Music] He Knows My Name Is [Music] I have a bigger people my life was in his house [Music] you know who I am gone [Music] I have a maker I have Obama [Music] my life was in his hands [Music] He Knows My Name [Music] it is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] when I go foreign thank you musicians [Music] let's just go ahead and stand for the reading of the word sayings I just want to if you can put that chorus back up for me real quick I want to point something out He Knows My Name you see He Knows My Name means that he has a personal relationship with you because he knows your name individually he knows your name your first name your middle name your last name your nickname he's Auto got it all down in the file there's many of you I may only know you by your first name I may know you by your family name I may not know your name at all but he knows all those things there's many a people who here today who have a middle name I may know your first name and your last name I don't have a clue what your middle name is but he knows he takes it very personally he's got it recorded down and when he hears you see here's something how many of you when you pray Lord you may not know who this is this is this is Jordan Eli fryjo just so you know that way you know who to record down probably not many of us we don't start our prayers out that way you know why because it's like this I spent over four and a half years here in customer service on the phone there's many a people I never met in person I never saw their face but I talked to them so often and I knew where they were at that when I heard their voice on the phone I knew their name they didn't have to say it I knew where I was calling and even though there was maybe 10 15 people at that location their voice was so distinct and I'd heard it so many times I knew exactly who I was talking to whether they told me or not boom they would answer the phone and say hello and I would say so and so Matthew and they'd be like ah on the other end I said I know your voice and I know your name and that's how God is with each of us that's how personal his relationship is with you no matter how distinct or indistinct you think your voice is the minute your voice is heard in heaven he hears your prayer he says aha Stephen Cassidy aha a brother Max uh brother Stephen Woods that's who it is Jordan freyjo I I hear that voice and all you said is Lord that's it it doesn't take him he doesn't have to need a whole conversation to thinking okay going through the database see if we can get a voice recognition on this guy oh I now I know who it is no first word out of your mouth in fact he said I know your voice so distinctly that you through your groanings I can identify you he said you may not have the words to pray but I know you so well that just your groanings through your cry through your tears any utterance you make I know who that is and I know what you're going through and just that enough is to bring enough to bring him on the scene that's how he knows your name now that's one wonderful thing but the next line he knows my every thought now some of us are like yeah my he knows what I'm thinking and thinking you know when I'm in my heart and I'm praying for other people and in my thoughts and you know just praying in my heart for for this one and that one he can hear my prayer that's a wonderful thing because you can be praying anywhere at all times doesn't matter what's going on but the more amazing thing to me is he knows my every thought every thought the more amazing thing to me isn't that he hears my prayers and he answers them and he recognizes them and he hears me and meets me where where I need him the more amazing thing to me is all the thoughts that I wish he wouldn't hear that he does and he doesn't condemn me for them but for those same thoughts he begins moving on the scene because he knows my every need it doesn't shock him it doesn't dissuade him it doesn't make him rethink his choices about me because he doesn't just hear my every thought he knew my every thought before I even thought it and he still was my maker and formed my heart he still was the one who said I'm going to make him exactly that way knowing the thoughts he'll have you you may be in yourself maybe you you've had some thoughts and straight off in places you shouldn't you think wow I sure don't want anybody to ever know about that and you think that you're hiding from God because you never said it out loud well I'll tell you what you're hiding it from the devil as long as you don't open your mouth brother random told us that he said the devil can send things to your thoughts but he doesn't know what you're thinking but God not only can he speak to you to your heart you see he speaks directly to your heart the devil can speak to your mind and you have to allow it to drop to your heart God will come and speak to your heart already knowing your thoughts before you thought them so don't let the devil come back to you after he whispered something horrible to you and you think it was you and tell you if God only knew you were thinking those things he wouldn't want anything to do with you let alone all those people at church man did you just put on a brave face and wear a really nice suit on Sunday smile and Shake everyone's hands and they won't know and you'll just be able to slip in and out but you don't belong there no way I mean look at the thoughts you're thinking some of you are maybe thinking wow how does he know I think that Saints I'm a man just like all of you I'm human I've been there I've been a young man I'm Still a Young Man compared to many of you yes in fact when I say that they're like you are a young man but I've been a a boy I've been a teenager I've been a part of the youth I know the struggles you're going through and I say my hat is off to you this morning as a youth today not even a youth of five years ago or ten years ago not a youth of just a few years ago what I can remember it wasn't that long ago for me but I look at the progression of the availability of The Temptations of sin even for me it was less today you can't hardly Escape it for a moment you have to be so on guard so on point you have to be so yielded to the moving of the holy spirit in your life or else just like that it'll catch you and the devil knows it and last Sunday we talked about it the raising of a standard and I tell you God knows what you're going through and he knows what you're facing don't think you're facing it alone or God don't know God knows and he has got the answer for you he's not here to condemn you here to tell you you did wrong because you already know if it was right or wrong God's here to say despite what you think you've done my grace is still enough you just have to be willing to accept it it doesn't even have to do you think well I'm not worthy yeah you're not right none of us are all right let's okay let's read the scripture I can let you have a seat instead of keep you standing the whole time um let's just start I'm going to read Malachi 3 2 through 4 and I'm going to give them a minute to get it up here for those of us who maybe don't have our Bibles readily available that way we can just all follow along and I'm ready for that Malachi 3 2 and 4. but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a Refiner's Fire and like Fuller soap and he shall sit as a refiner and pure and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering and righteousness then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord as in the days of old and as in the former years let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we just dedicate ourselves back to you once again this morning asking you to come and have your way father Lord Lord has asked that you would come and meet the needs of your people father whatever that might be father you just take this service and whatever Direction you would find necessary father Lord not anything of ourselves but let me let us put ourselves out of the way father surrendering ourselves to you both speaker and hearer that you would have your way we ask you bless the reading of your word may it have an effect in the lives of your people we pray in Jesus name amen you can't have a seat this morning I just want to take a a little thought and and title it refined shaped and tempered and you know earlier in this week me and me and my wife we were talking about a situation of some friends we know back in the Phoenix area where new parents their first pregnancy and the baby was was born and it had a lot of complications and is in the NICU and they don't know what exactly will happen but they're trusting in God and we we're just talking and said how is it or what is it how how do you face these situations when they come how do you prepare yourself and even why is it as as Christians maybe we feel like we've done everything right we've we're trying to serve God with all our heart we've put ourselves out there and and just trusting that that God Will Make A Way and and then all of a sudden something in life like this happens nothing we could preconceive nothing we could plan for nothing you could even prepare yourself for and and it's just natural it's it's very human to to run into a situation like this and and say Lord why what did I do wrong what where did I go wrong would I have done something better could I have maybe maybe it's I could have you know in this case maybe the mom will have a ton of questions for herself and you know maybe I could have taken better care of myself is there some way we could have caught this and is there you know all these questions that surge through our minds and we say Lord I why is this and many times in life we'll go through things troubling things hard things that we may not immediately get an answer for or we'll get an answer in the fact that God Will Make A Way and what do I mean by that do I mean that there'll be some miracle and all of a sudden everything will be put right for what we consider right no that's not that's not scriptural it just isn't it'd be wonderful it'd be a great testimony it's what we would call a great testimony some great miracle of of someone being raised from the dead or someone with a deformity all of a sudden becoming whole in body we'd say look at this great testimony look at this miracle but you know an even greater Miracle than that is God's ability to bring us through it while facing that trial no matter the outcome you see because it takes far more faith to say God I trust you no matter what than it does if every time you said Lord fix this and he just did exactly what you wanted him to do because if so after a while it'd be like no problem you'd start just walking out into the street in the middle of traffic because no problem if I get hit by the car I fall down I die whatever I'll just raise back up but God didn't want us to act like that in life he wanted us to learn to trust him despite the fiery trials you know and many times like this scripture here in Malachi for he is like a Refiner's Fire and then it's skipping to verse three he shall sit as a refiner and purify our silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering of righteousness now many times when we think about it in the Refiner's Fire and we think God coming down his fire from heaven and bringing judgment we always think about it as many times it's preached as the the the shaft and the the sticks and the rubble being burned up and we always type that to an end time type when the the bride has been taken away and God comes down and purges the Earth but we don't realize that the reason why the Earth as a whole and sin and Hell Fire comes down to cleanse it because all those people rejected the fire in their life so it's not that you get to skate by free and clear and never get touched by the fire but you're making a conscious choice of saying Lord cleanse me let that fire Purify Me Now but many of us many times want to direct the Lord as on where and how that fire should affect us and that's what I would like to take a look at here this morning now this morning I know a scripture for the most part always touches on silver and gold as precious metals and there's a correlation between them and between the way all metals are are shaped and and used and refined but this morning I actually want to take a look at the process of refining iron ore and making it something useful you know because scripture also talks about the iron on iron and sharpening one another but in order to get to a place where we can be in a useful place where we can sharpen one another we have to be taken from the Earth where we were born processed shaped molded refined and tempered before will be of any use where God can use us appropriately now I actually have a few images I don't know if they're able to bring them up if you can bring up that first image there we go so this is all different types of iron ore that's brought up from the ground and it's in its shape and you can see here it's all different colors and that is all dependent on where it comes from what the Earth around it is like how how it's mined what the concentration of different sand and clay and all the different minerals are around it that influence it at that point in stage in the mining process if you just go to the second picture and this is just a tumble of it all in here there's there's iron in here but it's dirty it's got the Earth is all embedded in and around it it's really of no use if you were to see this you just say oh that's a pile of rocks you wouldn't be like wow look it I can see the spoons and I can see the utensils I can see shovels in there good morning yeah lawnmower lawnmower blades everything that we can think of your car the body of your car it's sitting right there most of us be like that is a pile of rocks useless if someone said hey I'm I I heard you need a new car I'm going to bring you some parts over and they drop this off in your driveway you would not be impressed not at all you can go ahead and take that down but you see just like the iron ore starts there so do all of us in fact none of us start with any advantage in life in regards to this process because scripture tells us we're all born in sin and shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies now it doesn't say well if you were born in church and you have really good parents this don't apply to you or you have the shaped in sin and born in iniquity but you don't have the Lie Part like 30 off no if you're if you're born to parents in the world if you're born to it doesn't matter where you're born it doesn't matter who your parents are doesn't matter what part of the world you come from doesn't matter your background the baby born in church raised up right never to the outside world looked like they'd done a thing wrong perfect kid is the same pile of ore as the person born to the the parents that are drunkers drug addicts murderer you name it when God looks down he sees that same pile of ore in both places and it's so important for us to realize that it's important for those of us maybe who are born in church to go I'm no better I'm no better to God I look no different the process he's going to have to work in me is just the same and it's good for those of you who maybe life hasn't been so kind to to look over and realize to God I'm the same pile of ore as this other person God don't see me any different he doesn't see me any worse he doesn't see me any dirtier he says there I see something in there and maybe wrapped up in the dirt and filth of this world but there is something in there that I can bring out that is something that I identify with that I can have that has a purpose and a use in my kingdom you see you're not just any kind of dirt you're a dirt that has a precious metal your dirt that has a usefulness locked up inside of you and it just takes God to reach down and begin working digging you out of the earth that you were born in and begin the process now I'm gonna you don't have to turn with me but I'm going to read very quickly through Hebrews 12. and I'll skip around a little bit because I want to hit this um because I think it's applicable to this um Hebrews 12 verse 1 wherefore seeing all we are also are compassionate about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us so here Paul says sin easily besets us so if any one of you think wow I really I I fell for that really easy I want a sucker I am well Paul said it's that's nothing special to you eat sin easily besets everybody so don't let the devil convince you that it's you're special and the fact that you felt for one of the devil's tricks means that you're not a son of God doesn't mean that at all Paul himself he's identifying himself in this he said we're all easily set upon to begin with so you're that pile of ore surrounded by dirt you look dirty it's because you're dirty doesn't mean that God isn't working God isn't doing anything you know when that pile of Aura is sitting there it's mineral content dirt content clay content isn't any different than when it was buried in the Earth but a process has been started all right looking unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds so Paul's telling us he said when you feel like everything's going wrong and temptation is on the rise you can't seem to make your way out of a paper bag seems like every time you turn around you're falling down again he said consider Christ and the contradictions and the things that he suffered and went through consider the trials that Christ went through he didn't he wasn't plagued with all the things that we were plagued with in that he was perfect to begin with he didn't have to go through those trials tribulations suffering but he was going to be the firstborn among many brethren he was going to show if you'll just follow my lead you too can overcome every single day every day every moment every second and that's good because many of us need that overcoming power every second there's about one moment we had that thought we said Lord help me and oh my goodness that's horrible I didn't I mean to think that about so and so I didn't mean to think think whatever it was and these thoughts pop up all the time because we're constantly being bombarded and influenced by the world so you see it boom it hits the eyes travels to the brain words images whatever they are we can't hardly Escape them you should be you could at least go to your own home close the door and get away but the world is in such a way that now your phone you pick it up and you think oh I'm just going to catch up with somebody online I'm gonna check my email I'm gonna I'm gonna check Instagram I'm gonna check Facebook the in and of itself as a single singular thing especially if you have family or friends that are in different parts of the world you can see wow this is a way for me to stay in touch with them and you open it up and boom there's an advertisement boom there's something else boom boom it's just like a minefield you you can't hardly get away from it but Christ said don't worry I knew that's the way it was going to be at the end time that's why they ran him when he talks about going beyond the curtain of time and he says when we get there at the end when we get there at the end and they come around and the Saints of all the Ages come asking and say what age were you from you know there's Paul James Peter you name it the all the saints who went through the Dark Ages me and you think wow put on Iraq pulled us under arms limbs popped out of their sockets saw it in half while still alive tortured I'm glad I didn't live back then but they faced it one time they faced it one time and then it was over today in this age young people every single moment you're at school you're at work you're in the the break room at work and it boom Another One boom it so happened so much and so rapidly that we become a bit calloused to it like it doesn't even phase us as much anymore like we're not shocked we're not my goodness what was that I can't believe I saw that no it's just oh you you walk through the store you don't you're not shocked you don't go running from the store I can't believe I saw that person that way or I can't believe someone did that I can't believe someone said that I can't believe that that person cuss someone out over the phone I can't believe this is a a place of a public place this is a place of business and I can't believe they would act that way we're not surprised or shocked at all anymore when we see that kids in school you shocked if one of your classmates starts cussing no not at all right zero go back even go back 15 10 15 years and you would have been sent to the principal's office for speaking that way it's not that people didn't know about it but there was still some level of propriety amongst professional places where that teacher when they walked out of school and went to the bar that night probably cussed up a storm but within the classroom they expected a certain level of etiquette you see but today if you were to send someone to the the principal's office for the same things they'd be like you're crazy this is freedom of speech the kid has rights and that's where we're at so that's the level when I said each generation it's 10 times worse now those of you who are any good at math 10 times worse each time isn't just another isn't a value of 10 but that's a multiplier of 10. is we realize that from one generation to the next is that's 100 so you the first time you get 10 and 10 that's 100 10 times that 100 is one thousand and I know this is really simple and maybe like come on I can do the math well 1010 times that 10 000. now how many times how are we all ready what three four that's only four generations and you went from 10 to 10 000. that's where scripture talks about in The Book of Revelations that that from the river Euphrates those thousands upon thousands will be released and they've been released they're here they're here and that's why God was raising the standard you see it wasn't meant to be easy this last age wasn't meant to be an easy age and that's where going back the the Saints of the other ages will come to you and say which age are you from you say laodicea I was there in the very last age the bright age and there'll be that man who stood there who who was tied up and fed to the Lions and be like wow how did you make it how did you survive the constant bombardment of sin of demon power and influence where there was no place to escape how did you make it so know this you've been chosen you individually individually you have been chosen for this time this age because God knew that as he begun the refining process in your life there was characteristics about you that were perfect to meet the to meet the challenge of the age all right so he saw that when you were a pile of rocks God saw that in you all right for ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation would speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not to thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endured chasting God dealing with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement where of all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had followers of our flesh with corrected us and gave them reverence and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they barely a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby now Paul didn't sugarcoat any of this Paul was very real with everybody he didn't try to make it sound better or nicer he didn't try and be like just come to Jesus and everything will be all right you no more problems in your life it's all love and peace and rainbows and dancing on in the clouds like that was never the promise for the believer never and that's where Christianity has gone today is they said wow how do we increase membership let's just tell them God loves everybody God don't care how you are how you act how you dress how you speak God just loves you it's not true God does just love you but if he loves you he's going to correct you he's going to chasten you what does that mean is he's going to come around and be like what are you doing you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God why are you acting this way it's time to straighten out time to get your act together and he begins processing you processing you and refining you now keep this Hebrews especially here through Hebrews 12 6 through that 11. keep that in mind as we begin going through this process here there's a whole lot more here in the book of Hebrews uh the last verse I want to read in chapter 12 is verse 29. for our that's actually read 27-29 and this word yet once more signifyeth the removing of those things that are shaken as the things that are made and that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we're receiving we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire now let's just go ahead and I want to talk about the different stages of iron refining now the first stage which we've already seen is the mining stage is where someone saw potential in the Earth that there is a there is a deposit of iron ore in this place in the earth that has enough value to be worth spending resources and time on to remove so it's not just anything it's just not they don't just randomly pick a place to dig and hope that they find something but there's people that are trained and have knowledge and understanding and wisdom who know what they're looking for they know what the mineral content of the earth should look like they know when they run their test whether or not this is a profitable thing to do and our God is not a a lazy businessman he doesn't just poke around and dig in in random places he knows where that iron deposit was placed because he put it there okay so if God even begins to work in your life even just a little bit if you feel God moving in on your life you feel the presence of God in your life whether it's in a in a church setting or even at home you're reading your Bible and it just so happens maybe just that one time you know you you didn't even want to you didn't feel like it but you happen to be sitting in your room or sitting maybe maybe you're sitting out in the living room no one else was there and you were bored and maybe it was your dad's Bible or your wife's Bible or your husband's Bible it was it wasn't even your Bible and you're sitting there and you're like I don't even know what to do I don't have nothing to do I don't you know he's kind of one of those moments and you're just kind of I'll just do anything anything and you see the Bible laying there and you pick it up you think oh this is random and you open up and you read a verse you didn't even really pick where you opened it you just opened it because you don't even know your Bible that well you haven't picked it up in so long maybe you've never picked up the Bible and you pick it up and you open up and you read a verse and something about that verse catches your attention and you close it up you set it down and you walk away and you don't ever think about it again for quite some time that wasn't you you thought it was you you thought it was random you thought you were just bored you said I have nothing better to do you weren't even that purposeful about what you read you open the book you read a verse you read a couple of lines you closed it up God's beginning to work don't think that you picked that up of your own choosing you see because never never and I mean never like never will the devil ever influence you to pick that book up that's the last thing he ever wants you to do because he understands the power of the word of God whether you understand it or not when you pick it up and you read from that word it's influencing you immediately you may not think so you may think whatever you walk away God's starting something God's doing something and this may be at any different stage in your life maybe you're saved maybe you've been baptized maybe you've been Sanctified maybe you've gone through the just the step of justification you've gone through that step of sanctification but you're still waiting on the Holy Ghost and maybe you're in a point in your life where you're kind of a little bit lackadaisical and you picked that Bible up you began to read God's doing something he's continuing the refining process you see at any stage in it most of us will look at that refining process and be like I don't see anything different yet in fact I see very little hope for that material almost none at all but you see we're not a mining specialist we don't see the vision for that product we don't look at it and go and see what that that other what that mining professional sees he says I see potential there and it's worth it for me first of all to dig it up out of the ground then from there transport it to a place where I can begin processing it and that's kind of the next stage is is the refining process and there's a an image there that shows a furnace here if you can put that up for me and just leave it up here but this is what they call a blast furnace so first of all in the mining process is you saw that larger pieces of ore that was pulled out of the ground that's not what goes into this glass furnace over in Arizona copper mining is a very big thing and I've been a had the opportunity to go to a few of these mines on tours and things and what they have is they have these massive tumblers where they take all this large ore and they dump it in and with that in that tumbler what they have is hardened typically hardened steel ball bearings inside those tumblers and they tumble it around until every last piece of that ore has been broken down and smashed into fine pieces fine particles they're getting it ready to go into the furnace they're getting it ready for processing and sometimes that's the stages of life that we're in you know we're really struggling to we we don't we don't want to admit that we need God in our lives we don't want to admit that you know we got rough edges or what we're doing anything wrong or anything is a problem we don't we don't need religion we don't need church we don't need well I can tell you this you don't need religion or church but you do need God yeah Now by God's grace when he starts working in your life you can hope and pray that he'll have a fine church for you to go to to be strengthened at but Jesus Christ is the answer and so what he starts doing in your life is he puts you into this life tumbler and because you're resistant it begins tumbling you around and you just feel like your life is getting all broke up you feel like everything is going wrong you're getting smashed to pieces you can't hardly catch a break every time you turn around something else is going wrong something else is messed up something else is where you're going through a process God started the process he's going to take you through the process he's going to finish the process once he gets his hands on you he's not going to let go that's why scripture says not one in the palm of his hand will be lost once he's got you there you can run you can try and resist you can do everything you think you're going to do and God just says no way you're mine now and you think back and be like man you know you'll be doing something that one little scripture that you read maybe you read Thou shalt not lie that's it we didn't even read any of the other Commandments used for it Thou shalt not lie and up until this point in your life you've told so many lies and you know how many of them bothered you none of them in fact you thought I am so good at this and they are all so stupid I am so good at this they don't even have a clue well you know it's most of the time most people do have a clue they're just giving you a lot of Grace and you don't ever get away with anything it's not true but now you read that scripture Thou shalt not lie just a few words and all of a sudden you go tell a lie it's not even that big a lie and that comes back to you thou shall not lying it starts bothering you and bothering you and you're like oh my goodness like it's not even that big a deal like I don't know why this is bothering me God's working God's working it to everyone else they don't even notice all they do is still see all your lies but they don't see God began the process he's begun that refining process where he's he's causing a turbulence he's causing uh something to come into your life and start breaking that stuff up start breaking up that Earth that that iron is buried in and when he gets you all broke up and ready he brings you over to the blast furnace now the purpose of the blast furnace is to take that iron ore that's got all those impurities in it and separate it out through Heat they have a few things that they add to it to help that heat process but the end result is you can see here that from the top is where that ore is getting dropped in and as you start dropping into the furnace the lower you down into the furnace the hotter it is and what's happening is that the holiday rate again is the less impurities can survive and the iron which is heavier than the impurities is getting melted out and drops down to the bottom and all the impurities get pushed to the top and what happens then is that they take and once it's reached that point where they consider it pure enough they take it out the bottom and they pour it into molds let's go to the next image we're going to go through this a little bit quick okay so they pour it out into molds and those molds create what they call ingots and all they are is roughly formed iron pure as pure iron as what they can get through this process it still has a few little impurities but it is as pure as it can get now how many of you would look at that and be like aha now I see it I could use some of that well I don't I did have someone deliver some to my house tomorrow wait Simon would you you want to borrow iron just to sit in your room no you don't have any plans for it anything like that okay me neither unless you just want a big giant paperweight but it to me that has no use yet no purpose has no value to me as as a person and I'm not going to do anything with it zero and yet this is the stage where we're at God's working on us he's began cleaning us off maybe at this point he's got to a place of justification he's working on the sanctifying process but we're still just a lump of iron you know Iron people may not realize it but iron is extremely soft iron is it's very malleable bendable it can be pushed around it can be hammered on and one of those characteristics also is that whichever way it hit it gets hit it'll just stay there you know it's like a young Christian we come in and you know we're feeling so good and and maybe we don't have that many years in the scripture and in the Bible not much of an experience but we're on we have been on fire for God if we've gone through that furnace and we're like whoo I'm ready I'm ready now I'm ready and to us we are feeling really good because the last we saw of ourselves we were that pile of rocks and now we look at ourselves and we're like wow this church is so blessed to have me just wait I just really now I pick up my Bible because I want to I just want to read that thing every day and that's good it's not still not because you want to but God's influencing you to want to he really is at any point of the stage where we think it's well it's because I want to oh there may be there may be a stage where that comes to that you ain't really there yet God's still working he's still working on me he's still working on you and at this stage though we read you know I think brother random talks about a man who read the Bible one day and it says um one day it it told him to eat and be merry for tomorrow you die and so he goes out and he throws a party and he gets all drunk and the next day he reads the Bible and it tells him not to be a drunkard and he says I don't get it it seems like it's contradictory he was in an iron stage you see he was so excited he forgot to actually go through and see what did it mean what was the scriptures around that that applied to that but you see it came in and it influenced him and he was so excited he just ran off and did it and he couldn't end up a little bit bent over and took someone to come straighten that thing back out and he's like wow I'm confused now and that's many of us when we're in that stage of our Christian walk is one minute you know we we think we got it we think we understood what God meant and we go out and we go start correcting people and telling them hey you shouldn't be doing that you shouldn't be thinking that you shouldn't be acting that way don't you know you're a Christian and and luckily for us most of them are going to be people who are quite gracious and experienced and have been walking with the Lord a while and they just say oh thank you brother I'll take that into consideration I appreciate that you know because they got some Grace for us because they've been there before and sometimes iron runs into iron and they they butt heads and they both go away a bit bent you know a little bit deformed like ah that hurt wow he hurt my feelings he you know he should know better than that if he was a Christian the other guy's like well if he was a Christian he wouldn't have treated me that way he wouldn't have talked to me that way he wouldn't have said those things doesn't he know who I am neither of them learned anything because they're in that stage but God's still working God's still working it's not you haven't surprised God at all if you have a good wonderful Pastor he's not surprised at all he's just watching it and he said all right God's working I just got to have patience God's doing what he's doing he doesn't need me to jump in there and try and straighten them all out and you just let God do his thing you see because if you take at this stage and you think you're going to straighten them all out and that'll be the end of it you straighten them out and tomorrow they run into something again and they'll come back bent why because that's the nature of the iron right now it's pure iron it's got some dirt removed it's getting cleaned up but that's just the stage in the process at that no take heart if you're in this stage you come out of the world God's cleaned you up a bit and you're on fire you're excited and yet you feel like everything that hits you you just can't seem to recover from it he's like am I even a Christian like I did this and I I feel like I backslid and now I can't seem to come back from it and I just I'm just bent I can't it's like you know you ever have an injury of some kind or or you know if you're real young it probably hasn't happened to you but you get a muscle and you get a big giant knot in your back back here and it's like this and you're walking around well all you need is for someone to work that knot out and you'll be fine but until that happens man is it painful and it affects the way you walk and the way you act and it affects your attitude all those things and that's where many people are in the stages they get a little not in their life a little bit of Ding A little bit dinged up and the ding don't come out very easy the bend in their life and everyone sees them and they're all they seem to be walking a little crooked and you're like you okay there you all right anything I can do for you I'm like no I'm fine but you're fighting that vowel in and of yourself too because you look around you like Lord I thought I had an experience I thought I got baptized I thought everything should be better now oh it's better but now instead of the rocks and the dirt being embedded in you and being a part of your everyday life now when you come in contact with them and they have a little bit of effect on the the outside they affect your life a little bit because you hit something hard and it's going to ding you up a little bit you hit something else a little bit of dirt and it gets embedded on the outside and now you're like wow I shouldn't I shouldn't be doing that anymore I shouldn't be affected by that anymore and he's like Lord was my experience even real I said yeah it was real don't worry about it that's just on the outside I'm still working on you and that the inside that's mattering the most right now let's let's jump to the next picture here we go we're gonna hang out on this one a while now what they do to bring iron to a place that it's usable and make it strong enough and flexible enough is they take it to a forge they take these ingots of iron and they begin working on them now right away you can tell this is not a pleasant experience especially if this is applying to us because we thought we'd been through the furnace once already we thought we are good to go I'm sanctified I'm so squeaky clean already what's all this for what's the purpose Lord I accepted you as my savior I let you in I I gave up all the drinking I gave up the cigarettes I gave up the cutting my hair I get whatever it was I gave up the the worldly music or whatever Lord I did all these things why why am I going back through this why do I feel like I'm getting put back through the furnace he said yeah you're now barely finally in a stage where you're workable now we can begin the process of turning you into something that's useful you see because iron that pure iron form is going to have a few things added to it because what they want to end up with is steel and the difference between Iron and Steel is a bit of character now I call it character because it works out real well because the element added is carbon and the the periodic symbol for that is a big giant C so you can call it Christ you can call it character you can kind of just fill in the blank right there but it's applicable because what that does is as they begin hammering it now here's the wonderful thing I just just a side note is that although they know science knows that this works and is applicable and makes this iron turn to steel and become something that is extremely useful and Powerful strong flexible all those things they can tell you what it looks like when they're done well they what they still say today is they don't feel the fully understand why this happens and this is true for all of us is because God begins working on our life brings us over to the forge of his word puts us into the furnace starts heating us up and what they do is you see where it's red hot that's what they say you have to bring it to the point of the critical point just before it starts to melt down again and you know how many times they do this over and over and over again as they begin pounding the shape out on the Anvil and you know what's doing that the Anvil is already made of Steel the hammer head is made of steel so it's those who already have had experience God is using to move in your life and being helped to shape you and build you into something useful for the kingdom of God you see this is where in Hebrews for whom the Lord loveth he chasteness and Scourge us every son whom he receiveth if he endure chastening God deal with you as a with his sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not thank you now no chastening for the present seemed to be joyous but Grievous it this isn't going to be pleasant just as a heads up if you thought I'm going to join the church I'm going to get baptized except Jesus Christ is my personal savior because I don't want to have to face anything hard again in life you picked the wrong place that's all I'm saying because that was never a promise now I can remember my own experience I was 16 years old when I got baptized and I was so nervous and excited and I went up and I went into the water got baptized in Jesus name came out of that water and I felt like I was floating on clouds I did it was one of the most wonderful experiences I've ever had in my life I felt that way for at least two weeks like there's nothing anyone could say to me that could bring me down I just felt like I was walking around on clouds and dancing like nothing could go wrong it was wonderful what I didn't realize I was just in that iron stage God was just getting ready to work on me here I was and I was like I have made it he said well you're in a good stage to get started so he said I'll let you enjoy it for a moment let you sit there and cool off and become a little bit more solid so I can become working on you again and he did and he has and he still is like Saints the reason I know God is working on me is because despite all the times like I feel like I've been put in the furnace I'm still here see if God had decided I have no purpose for you you're just scrap you're not a part of the iron that I need you're not a piece of Steel that I need you just refuse to be set aside you know how you would know you just thrown back into the furnace to be melted down again tossed to the side that's what brother Brandon talks at it it's the same concept where he says that woman who's cutting out a pattern for a dress it's the same material but God is choosing to place his pattern over you in your life so if he's still working on you you know how you'll know because despite what you go through how tough or how hard it is no matter how close to failure you think you came God's doing it on purpose because he's got to bring you to the critical point every time to the point where you almost lose to all shape to the point where you lose all your identity when you get metal iron to a critical point it loses one of its main characteristics which is magnetism most anything metal you ever take a magnet you put it on your fridge you put on the side of your car sticks just like that the magnets real strong you can't hardly pull it off and that is just you know in fact when they're going through metals to determine what they are they'll take a strong magnet over it and anything that picks up and connects to it metallic it's probably ironed that's how they know in fact in big giant shops when they're doing separation that's how they do it that's how they identify it but when you're brought to this critical point everything you think that is a part of your identity gets taken away because God's working and he's reshaping you and reshaping your identity do the character shaping process of the word he's bringing you through one step at a time so you thought wow that last trial was really hard that last lesson was really hard I almost didn't make it but you did you know why God took you all the way to that critical point then brought you out and began working on you hammering on you working you through he's molding you into the image in his mind he is a preconceived idea of you of how you should look how you should act and how you should then react to the things in the world you see and little by little he doesn't do it all at once it would be too much you wouldn't be able to handle it you wouldn't make it but little at a time he's working on you and so he's allowing things to happen in your life that you'll be going along you'll think life is great life is going just the way you planned it and boom something you couldn't have planned for didn't plan for happens maybe you get sick maybe a loved one passes away maybe all your friends turn against you maybe you start making a stand for God and your friends just start leaving you out and you say I didn't do anything different I don't even treat them any different when I'm around them I don't even talk about God why don't they invite me anymore why don't they want to hang out with me anymore God's working God's working you can't help the iron can't help but as it's being worked on begin to show some of the characteristics of Steel of what is being molded and worked and shaped into and so was it with us is that as God is working in our life and you go out even if you don't say anything there's going to be a presence carried with you you may not even be all that aware of it but the people who've been around you before they are yeah they're like man she's he he she used to be so fun now there's just such a stick in the mud they don't want to do anything you know because you show up and used to do all the things that they used to do you used to say all the things they usually laugh at all their jokes used to think they were real funny in fact used to tell the jokes you were the funny guy you were the one they came to and they were down because they knew you had all the jokes now you don't have any more jokes and on top of that you don't laugh at their jokes you're not eating fun anymore so now they're like you know what let's just not invite them like and you're going like what happened what did I do you didn't do anything God's working God's working in your life God's working on who you are God's molding you he's shaping you he's placing you over and over again in this furnace taking you to that critical point last time you thought that was as far as I could possibly go but with each time the characteristics of the iron are changed and you get closer to become Steel you can resist a higher level of heat and God knows that he said no each time I build your character the next time I can take you a little bit further a little bit closer to my own character he said because the the example was of Christ our example was of Christ and Christ though he didn't want to was willing to set his own identity to the side take up the cross walk up to Golgotha allow himself to be nailed to that cross and made a shame for all of us see and that is the character of the steel that God is working on each one of us to get to you can see this in the life of the disciples look at each one of them as God Jesus started working on them he called them he was patient with them and little at a time he started asking a little bit more of each one of them all the way to the point where they had to come to the same characteristics of Christ going to the Cross some of them quite literally but they didn't get there overnight and one go Peter on the night of the crucifixion he had a lot of work to do he was still very much in an iron state because when the servant said hey aren't you one of them he said no and he cursed he said I'm going to prove to you I'm not one of them because you know one of them would never curse so out of fear I'm going to curse to prove to you I'm not what you think I am and Jesus Jesus never rebuked him in fact Jesus told him beforehand Peter before the crows Thrice before the crows you'll denied me Thrice three times not once not twice three times someone who'd walk with Jesus there were three and a half years had seen the dead raised had seen blind eyes come open they had seen leprosy healed one minute a leper next minute perfectly clean the worst possible disease of their time this is why brother Barnum said miracles never made a believer many a people throughout the ministry of brother random throughout brother random's Ministry saw cancers they were sitting on the platform behind him as he prayed for people and Cancers visibly on the neck fell off onto the platform and yet at the end of his ministry they said he's preaching false Doctrine it's not about the miracle God's simply doing that because he's looking he's beginning a mining process and in the mining process you dig up all the dirt around the Oar too it all gets loosened up and moved everything's getting shaken just like the scripture says everything's getting shaken and loosened up because God's coming after his own he doesn't care about the rest of it if they get a little benefit from it fine if they don't fine he doesn't even care what he's after is you and me you see God will take and shake up a whole city to get one soul if you ever see a large mining operation a pit mine have how many of you have ever seen a pit mine how many of you have ever seen a picture of a pit mine it looks like a massive gaping hole in the ground some of them are miles across and up to hundreds of feet deep and they are the ugliest things you will ever see and yet they're doing it because they have no concern for the Earth mountains valleys rivers around it they're after one thing they're after the ore that contains the metal that they're after and that's what God's doing here he's not concerned about the rest of the world he's not concerned about the rest of the earth he's got a plan to fix that anyways he's after you if he's got to disrupt the entire place to get you he will so have you ever been in a stage in your life where you just see like it seems like the whole place is shaking it seems like everything's falling apart God will do it for one Soul one he'll shake a whole city he'll shake a whole country for one soul that's how important you are to him you see that's why here at the end it's speaking about it he said everything that can be shaken will be shaken why because he's coming here to the end he said I can't lose a one so I gotta shake them all loose and get them ready for a Rapture to get out of here that way I can renovate this Earth I'm not worried about the Earth how many of you have ever seen or been a part of a home renovation or a building renovation you've seen it happen you walk through a place let's say road construction when they start road construction are they Pleasant and nice as with the road that they're trying to remove and change no they don't even care that asphalt could have been there for the last 30 years and still looked pristine and pretty with a nice white line on it but that is not their focus they're moving it because they have another purpose it is no longer has any purpose or any meaning it's just in the way and that's the way God sees everything else when he's coming after you he's not going to treat it kindly or nicely or or baby it or or be careful not to disrupt it he's going to do whatever it takes to get to you so the further and deeper you run and the more you hide and the more people that he has to disrupt that's on you because he's coming after you he's not going to stop until he has you so you can think you can run you can think you can hide you can think I I can be so bad I can involve myself so deep in sin God will never want me and then people will just leave me alone it it's not going to work I'm sorry you can do that if you want to but I highly highly suggest you don't it just means you're going to have to go through more refining process that's all the flame of the fire is going to be much harder to purify and bring out the character God's looking for so refining molding now we're into the forging of and tempering of Steel so we already see in the forging process that's being worked on it's being processed and we're working on it because God has got a very specific characteristics that he wants for the finished product now I'm going to read you something here and this is just informational metal forging is known to produce some of the strongest manufactured parts available as the metal is heated and pressed minor cracks are sealed and empty spaces found in the metal are closed up so God's working on you and you still have things in your life that aren't just right you got spaces that he's not fully inhabiting space is in your heart that you haven't fully surrendered and he's looking to to work that out and feel every last space with his love with his character with the fruits of the spirit with the moving of his holy of the holy spirit in your life he said we're going to keep working till we work out every crack until we work out every pocket and nothing is left but Jesus Christ in addition the hot forging process breaks up any impurities in the metal and redis redistribute such materials across the metal work this results in a vastly reduced inclusions in the forged parts inclusions are compound Metals embedded inside steel throughout Manufacturing even though impurities should be managed during the initial casting process this process the hammering the forging the fire this process will further refine the metal another way that forging strengthens metal is through the altering of its grain structure this has to do with the materials grain flow as it deforms like other forming processes a fable favorable grain structure can be created making the forged metal sturdier so it doesn't have to do with anything other than the process of the forging under the hands of the master that begins changing the characteristics of the steel the iron into the steel and the steel step by step into something stronger and something sturdier no definition here of either tempered or tempering is to dilute qualify or soften by the addition or influence of something else meaning to moderate tempered Justice with Mercy to soften a material such as a hardened steel or cast iron by reheating at a lower temperature to make stronger and more resilient through hardship the example would be troops that are tempered in battle now troops that are tempered in battle when someone says that troops are tempered it means that they no longer jump run or become skittish over the slightest thing they've been tempered to react differently they faced battle before and they know the difference between what they should be concerned with and what they should not and where the soldier that is fresh and new on the field every little noise he jumps and every little noise he's afraid and every little noise he's looking for something to shoot at the tempered troops they don't worry about it that's nothing to be afraid of when you see in fact the ones that are the most experienced they'll tell the new recruit the time for you to be concerned is if you see it see that old Soldier over there if you see him moving move with him I and God's does the same things in our lives you see puts us with people who are experienced and sometimes on our own we get really uptight about certain things and you know in our stage we've become maybe a little legalistic and every little thing is an annoyance to us and God says hey hey look it you see that brother over there he's been through a lot of experiences watch him a little bit ask him for some advice because he'll let you know brother don't let that bother you it's not a big deal just just pray for that person just pray for that individual what you you had a little mishap you had a you felt like you backslid a little bit brother it happens to us all every day just get up and keep moving don't worry about it don't let the devil hold that over you keep moving no tempering is done to steal as well because what they do let's go ahead and go to that second picture is as the steel is worked once it gets to a place where it's in the right shape it's exactly in the shape of the tool or the end product we want it to be they heat that steel back up to that critical point once they get it to that critical point they plunge it into oil to cool it extremely rapidly because it's going to have an effect on the structure of the steel and it locks that structure that of the steel in a position where it's extremely strong I don't know if you've ever heard the term of hardened steel but if you're in any type of manufacturing or used type of any type of equipment more than likely you have hardened steel parts on some of that machinery your car is going to have hardened steel is part of some of its parts now hardened steel and in and of itself is not the end point though because although now it's very hard it's got the right shape it looks right it looks like the finished product but God's not done yet you see because if you take something that's hard in steel if all you need is a bolt or something to hold something together it'll probably work in fact they use hardened steel all the time in different types of applications one really good that also all of us will be able to identify with is they use them in snow blowers they take a hardened steel Bolt and they put it where the blades of the snow blower are where it connects back to the engine but that hardened steel has very specific um ratings for how hard it should be because it's made to break under pressure and that is one of the things about hardened steel if all it is is hardened it's very strong but when it's put under too much pressure it just breaks and shatters and the reason they do that is because they're trying to protect something else in the linkage so if all of a sudden your snow blower hits a big giant rock and binds it up they don't want to destroy the motor so that hardened steel bolt has got a certain limit to its pressure that it'll hold based on its characteristic and it's made that when that pressure hits it when it gets to a certain point it doesn't just bend and still hold but it just snaps snaps off because it's not tempered it's not tempered now the tempering process is let's jump to the next image if they actually put that finished product back into the fire but now they're very careful with it they're not looking to take it back to a critical point but they're looking to just bring it to the place where they slowly warm it to a very specific temperature and they're doing that and they're watching for a very specific characteristics to form in the blade and most of the time if they're doing it in Old traditional ways over an open coals or fire however that is is they're looking for a very specific color to take place in that blade and when it does they take it back out and they cool it again what that tempering does is it takes that blade and it makes it changes its structure one more time and it gives it just a little bit of a softness on the inside of the blade so they hardened it and that's good because the edge of that blade they want to be hard and maintain a a edge a sharpness to it but if it only stays hard the first time you go to use it it'll shatter but now they're going to temper that blade and just the holy spirit will come and start working on your life he said you've been through a lot you've been hardened through through the battles you've been through and many of men have been through this and come to these stages they know the word they they've been fighting they're they're struggling they're they've got up they kept moving on they're growing in God's grace and they get to a place where they just become real hard you know brother Branham came to that place he did in his ministry and he came to a place where he had it was so his heart had hardened against the people and he was using the word to cut the people to pieces and I don't say this to this disparage or to or take anything away from the prophet of God but I'm showing you this is a process that God works in everybody no one is exempt each person has to go through this each person has to go through each stage because God wants a finished product that he can wield knowing how it will perform knowing that it will go forth to perform his word and not just perform something you want or something you think and that you won't be so rigid in the enforcement of what you think is the right thing that if you hit any resistance you're going to break and fall apart you're going to come unglued you're going to cause pain and suffering the people that shouldn't you see because Harding steel when it breaks it's not a clean break it doesn't just that's it but when it breaks under pressure it shatters and all those little pieces go find everybody everywhere undiscriminately hurting everything and everyone in its path and sometimes we come to that stage in our life where we think we've got it just so we know the word we know the scriptures we know the message and we know your problems and we're going to let you know and we're going to straighten you out and when you don't straighten out we're going to come back and let you have it we're going to cut you real deep because the word of God is like a two-edged sword Discerning to the heart and Marrow of the bone and we think that's our job and it's not because it says the word of God is not you that's God's job it's our our job to be yielded to the moving of the Holy Spirit and as a minister or as a lay member as a Christian as you Minister one to another is to share the word of God as God give you utterance and let the word of God be the sword that goes to the heart of the believer and does the work took too many times we get to the point in our life where we think we have all the answers and we're going to straighten them out because we think we are that sword of God and God does want to use you but you're not ready you're not ready you're going to do more damage than help right now because you have all the right words but you don't have the right character yet God still has got one more stage to put you through to where you're even now a vessel of Honor that can be used in the King's Service you're an instrument a tool in his hand that he can wield in a way that is so precise because the characteristics he built into you are so specific but we can say they're in the prophet's life where he actually had to remove himself from Ministry when when the angel of the Lord rebuked him because it wasn't that he wasn't preaching the word he was preaching the word he was preaching exactly from this Bible 100 the truth you won't go and find where even through that stage where he preached anything that was a lie or said anything that was untrue but it was the spirit and the character by which it was applied the skill by which that word was being applied that was incorrect and God came to him and said you need to stop doing that he said you need to stop condemning the people that's not your job it's your job to preach the word let the word fall where it may and you let God do the rest and you just remember where you came from see that's the problem is we get to this point where we look like the instrument that's going to be the finished product we look just like it you know I got an article here and I'm not going to read it but I'm going to tell you and they're talking about the difference between a functional sword and we're going to use a sword as the end product here because it I feel like it applies versus a decorative sword is they say none of the characteristics of what people think make up a sword are true of a functional sword a sword is not heavy most swords weighed between in total two to three pounds two to three pounds a really heavy sword you see those swords perhaps you've seen plenty of pictures of swords some that are they call it somewhere they call two-handed swords Claymores they were five feet tall four four pounds but it's the characteristics it wasn't the weight of the steel or the size of the object that makes it useful but it's the character of the object that makes it useful see a heavy sword is unwieldy scripture speaks of it is that in your experience and and you go out and your experience isn't right and you're floundering around and you feel like you can't it you don't have any control that's all over the place it's because it's unwieldy you're still too heavy you need work that is not functional they can't be used same thing maybe you're the right weight maybe you're the same right shape maybe you look perfect but you've been hardened but not tempered you know the first time you go and are put into service for use you're more likely to hurt the person you using you than the person you're being used against you're more likely to cause harm to the user than harm to the enemy because when you hit something solid any resistance you're going to shatter into a million pieces just gone and that's where God is still working he's coming and he's saying you know what you're close but we got one more step you don't need I don't need to take you to that critical stage anymore I don't need to melt you down to nothing but I'm gonna come in and soften your heart I'm gonna give you a heart like mine that when you look out upon the sinner you've been armed well with the characters of of the word and you know the scriptures you know the message you can quote it up and down now but now we're going to soften your spirit in such a way that when you yield when you wield that word that has been built into you over all these years you're going to do it in a way that's going to be precise you're going to do it in a way that only Cuts away the necessary things but doesn't touch anything else you're going to do it in a way that maybe you meet a little resistance you're not even phased you see because a heart and blade if it hits it can chip maybe you try to put yourself into service before you were even hardened you look like the right shape but you're still as malleable as the iron that you came from and what happens is you'd ever take something that isn't been hardened and tempered and you hit it or you try to have you ever taken like maybe a steel bar digging bar or something like that and try to pry something out of the ground or move it and instead of the thing moving your bar just bends like or the shovel you're using it just bends why and then you take it out and it stays bent it wasn't hardened and it's not tempered because tempering of the steel produces a trueness they say they a blade that's true the trueness of the blade is reflected in its ability to be bent and to be flexed and come back perfectly to its original state see that's how God wants us to be God wants us when he goes to start using us and we run into something difficult or hard or we we come into a situation is not to overreact and get all bent out of shape and stay that way or it's not to come into something and and we we just shatter the pieces and we fall apart but God wants us to be such that when he takes and starts to use you is that you're not easily influenced you're not rigid but you're not easily influenced either you'll come into a situation and God can use you to kind of work through it knowing at the end point it'll come true again because sometimes it takes someone knowing how to yield something correctly you know a sword you may think of it as only ever a weapon that can cause harm but they also used to use it simply to chase people away or to maneuver something or correct someone because you don't always have to use the sharp edge see that's where experience comes in and God brings someone to you or put someone in your life or a situation and if your first reaction is condemnation I would say you're probably still very much in that hardened condition you need to be tempered by the Holy Spirit to put that final bit of softness back into you where you have that sharp edge of the word it's not that you you don't hold true is that you know like if I bend a little bit one way or the other because I can see I need to work with this person I need to be a little bit flexible and see how God's moving that it's fine it's not going to leave me all bent when I come out of this I'll be true again when God is using me and bringing difficulties into my life I'm not going to shatter and fall apart God's put a temper in my soul that'll hold me true the way they test this is they take a sword or whatever blade it is and they lock it the tip in a vise and then they take it and they bend it all the way over now if it's been hard and not tempered at some point in that bending process it's going to snap and break if it's never been hard hardened and it still has bits of it now this can happen even if your whole maybe you've had some experiences but your whole experience isn't right there can be Parts in that blade that are that haven't gone through the process correctly you've tried to skip steps parts are hard parts are soft a little bit is tempered and what happens is if one part stays straight the other part bends the other part is a little bit springy send result is you got a blade that looks like a dog's leg that flops or you bend and they go to let let go and it doesn't go back to full straight again it just stays bent well I tell you many of us will go through these things as well many of us will experience these things but I tell you this that if God is working once he starts the work he never tosses it to the side where many a blacksmith and sword Smith when it gets to this point in the blade shatters he says play and the blade is bent it just gets tossed on a heap don't worry God won't do that with you he'll just start you over again he'll stick you back in the furnace start melting you down that part that broke he'll put you together heat it up into that critical point again and Hammer you back together because God never starts anything he doesn't finish me and you get excited and get ahead of the of the of the the game sometimes but God's just letting you see you're not quite ready yet he'll let you see this as stages because he wants you to see your growing many times as we're growing we don't see the growth we can see how everyone else we think is stunted but we don't see our own growth and this has been true of all of God's children you can go all the way back to the father of Faith Abraham and God did this with him over and over again all the Servants of God you can see it but look at Abraham you know Abraham had a pretty easy life all the way up into the point where he gathered all his things and possessions together and headed out into the wilderness I don't see any scripture that talks about Abram having a difficult light before that I'm sure he had the all the difficulties of of life that everyone does but nothing extraordinary it wasn't until he said Lord I don't really know who you are but I know you're calling me and so I'm gonna go and I don't even know where I'm going and he started out that's when all his troubles began you know we a lot of times we focus on all Abraham's blessings right Abraham the father of Faith look at how God blessed him here and God blessed him there but it was through the fiery furnace and the forging of Abraham's character that God brought him through to the man who God could speak to you and say Abraham take Isaac your only son and sacrifice him to me and Abraham didn't mock he didn't nothing just all right Lord away I go he didn't even tell Sarah he said Isaac we're going on a trip to a mountain to sacrifice to the Lord he didn't explain it it didn't bend him out of shape he didn't fall apart he didn't start lying to Sarah because he's been through all that before and now he'd built up to a place where God knew Abraham you're in a state that you're usable and now you're true the trueness of the blade I've been shaping is there and I want you to see it too and so I'm going to ask you to do something that if I would have asked you this a few years ago you would have run in the opposite direction you would have said no way anything else you see because Abraham had faced some tough stuff already he came out and he had to separate his he came out and his father passes away now he's out without any support any friends it's just him and the family he brought his he brought lot along with him a relative and he thought wow at least I have a lot to lean on you know with my dad passing away he can provide me some emotional support and all that and just with a matter of time of that all sudden lot and his group are having problems with Abraham and they split off and separated away now a lot doesn't have now Abraham doesn't have anybody he said The only person I had to lean on the only other guy I felt I could talk to and get counsel from and just kind of have a little bit of you know camaraderie someone who knows my past and we can you know talk about the good old times he don't want anything to do with me in fact he thinks so badly of me he'd rather hang out close to Sodom and Gomorrah like our contention was so bad that's where he would rather be we couldn't settle this so we had to separate and now this place of promise that God he felt God had called him to there's a drought it dries up there's no food you would think well God called me here shouldn't God provide for me he will and he always does if you stand still long enough but Abraham was still going through those things he was the forge it was still happening character was still being formed and built he goes running off to Egypt he goes running off and starts telling lies about who is his wife is his sister and if it wasn't for God's grace he would have come back without a wife but God was showing him even in the midst Abraham even when you mess everything up my promise has nothing to do with you I made a promise to me so when you're going through life and you feel like you're reaching a critical point where you feel like I don't see any way out of this I've gone down to the point where I don't even think God can save me from this what I've done is too bad the thoughts I've had are too evil the places I've been are too horrible the experience and the loneliness and the depression I'm in are too deep God's just breeding you all the way to that critical point so he can bring you out and you'll come out and go Lord You're I know you're faithful and you know what he says good now you're ready for the next one you know when just to lighten it up just a little bit is when I was 18 years old I was a month away from turning 18. the church that we I grew up in I was born and grew up in my my dad made some very large changes and he had addressed the pastor and some things that he felt were wrong and what was going on in the church and I appreciate my dad because he'd been doing going back and forth with the pastor for over five years you know I didn't have a clue I saw times when he looked pretty distressed but that wasn't so unusual because he has a lot of physical injuries and so he always looks like he's a little in a little bit of pain and so a little more pain wasn't unusual but it came down to a point where he said he let the pastor know I don't feel like me and my family can stay here any longer I feel like God is leading me on and I remember that day quite well because there was a somberness over the home when I got home from work that day and we were all sitting waiting for my dad because he had made the call to the pastor that day and after that he had gone down to a Rose Garden there in the city and just kind of walked around and paced around for hours like any of us probably would do when under that amount of strain and then he came home and he let us all know in variation just to shorten it his that we would be moving on now the church that we were in was a not to disparage anyone but quite legalistic in its ways and they have some beliefs and I just keep praying for them as a church as a whole and as the people and all these people were my friends to give you an idea I was I was homeschooled um all my friends were from the church when I started working I worked for my dad the people who most of the people who worked for my dad were other young men from the church um and so being a little on the legalistic side there when you left the church it was a maybe not an openly preached thing but no openly recognized thing that you were leaving the word and that you were not to be associated with and so on and so forth and and so when my dad said those things you know I I'm so glad that God gave me a a such a Godly father that although he never taught us to worship the man in any place of authority we were also taught to respect people in places of authority and never once was a disparaging word brought against those people in Authority despite the fact that maybe they weren't doing the right things and that was so helpful in this because my dad had never lied to us about anything and so when he said this is what's going on kept it very simple we're going to be I feel the Lord's leading us on to somewhere else we didn't distrust it for a moment but yet in the same moment you knew you never ever speak or interact with any of those people ever again and so there I am that a month away from turning 18 and all of a sudden I went from friends now my family was the family in the church who nobody ever thought would do anything wrong in fact I found it quite comical that about two weeks before that they had moved me everyone had very specific seating and they'd moved me from one spot in the church where I'd sat since for about five years that same seat they moved me across the church between two other young men because they said they needed someone with some character to help them behave during service so I found that a little bit comical later not right away but you know but immediately that that is what comes over you and my dad being having a little wisdom and knowing that we would need some relief he had scheduled for us to take a little trip that weekend he'd been in contact with a pastor a little a pastor of a little group down in Texas as we loaded us all up that weekend and we left town because the experience you would have later is if you ran into somebody they would either run in fear or give you these looks of hate um or just be so confused so confused and it's hard every time that you do that by God's grace we've seen great things since then but at the time it's quite traumatic and you know then we went to this place in Texas and short long story short as we thought we were going to move there we thought that was going to be our place we thought God had provided a church for us within a year's time a couple of the other families from the church we were from had also left and joined us and they thought they were going to move to that little church in Texas too and it turns out that the pastor of that little church hadn't been honest with my dad he'd been married before he had and so at his wife and they had children from those marriages and he told the other families that he had told my dad and my dad had hidden it from them and we all had our homes for sale at the time we were all trying to sell my brother had sold his home and already moved my older brother and just like that that coming to light there was many people in the little church there it was a group of maybe 20 about 30 people or so mixed congregation and it split that little group up it's the group of people who we thought were the only people we had Fellowship all of a sudden we're no longer interested in fellowshipping with us and this was like I said within less than a year's time of the first and so just like that all of a sudden now we were all alone the people who we thought were our friends and a little bit of Fellowship we had now looked at us very differently it got straightened out but even with that it caused a separation you know they went there the way and we went went ours and it was always a little bit different then after that when you would meet them and you know I think that has been it's been oh my goodness I'm it's been almost 16 years so it's not that way anymore with those families that are still attending message churches and serving the lord you know we've grown past that but at the time it was just felt like one thing after another one thing after another it felt I very much felt like that iron on the forge and God's hammer just coming down and coming down and coming down and coming down you know it you know in your heart you know in your mind in the scriptures and everything that God's working all things for you it's good but it's so hard to see the good sometimes within that same year before even the split in the churches there or the last I think it was right after actually so I was we were my brother had moved to Texas and he took what was a part of the one side of the little split and our family now we're still most of the family still back in Arizona looking for um somewhere else to Fellowship we don't know where we're going we're trying to Fellowship a little on our own and let's watch a few Services here and there and we tried to you know go visit other churches in the area but they a lot of people view you very suspiciously when you come from a prior group that they have preconceived ideas about and you feel like there's nowhere to turn and during that same time I had a cousin who was just six months older than me who was was killed in inner gang violence wasn't serving the lord and it just seems like at those times Saints it's like one thing after another just over and over and over and I can tell you this young people you know we started going to the church up in Phoenix at the end of that year just because we knew we needed somewhere to Fellowship the church was two and a half hours away from where we lived with no traffic so we made it up on Sunday so those of you who traveled those of you who are far those of you who got to make an effort to get places I I know I know exactly what it's like when you're not when you're at church it's the place you are there it's a refuge you feel like you're drawing strength but you don't want anyone to know what you're going through because so many times most people don't even understand I can tell you this he understands you know I tell people all the time I would go to church and and get there early not because I was so dedicated to church okay don't don't get me wrong there but I had such a spirit of depression afflicting me I had so many things going on I you know you the devil just comes at you at those times with anything to cause a distraction to the pain that you're feeling and you feel like you're in a state that you'll never climb out of and you're just holding on for dear life with every last bit of strength you got and no one else knows because on the outside you look so good your family looks so good you look so dedicated you're driving two and a half hours to church wow what dedication they tell you you're like thank you you show up early because all week long you're only your only Fellowship has been you and the other people going through the same struggles you are which is no help at all sometimes in fact you don't even want to tell them sometimes because you know what they're already going through and you don't want to add to it he said they don't if I add to them this thing that I'm struggling with I'll just crush them more than they're already crushed how am I going to share with them that how much I'm struggling with this things I can remember that depression being so deep that having suicidal thoughts so don't think you're alone don't think that anything you go through or any situation you you're alone and no one else has ever been through that or everyone else looks so good that they must be just no in fact the better they look probably the the deeper their struggle because we're so good at trying to hide things putting on a brave face in a nice suit and a and a real nice shirt and you know showing up and and smiling and laughing and just you know how was your week my week was great inside you're all tore up inside you're like I just hope I make it till next Sunday I hope I can make it till next Sunday and I make it back here and I don't become another statistic but Church getting to church early for me was church was the one place even amongst family right I could go sit in church close my eyes and cry and no one would ask you why you know why this oh wow that brother he's really being moved on by the spirit God bless him and they don't realize God is moving you don't feel like it God's moving but it's that one place you can just sit down and say Lord I need you I don't know how I'm going to make it another date father I if I thought quitting was an option I wouldn't be here if I could just crawl into a hole somewhere and not come out are be done it all be over you know we tell ourselves these things about boy I made it because I took a hold of the word of God and and I took a hold of this specific scripture and and it brought me and and I was able to hold on to that thing and it brought me through and you know I I read this and I read that or I took this type of mindset to stop it stop kidding yourself you know I like to tell myself all the time I the reason why I'm still alive today is because I couldn't bear the thought of my family having to suffer through one more tragedy I couldn't suffer the thought of maybe not seeing seen as being weak or not being brave I couldn't suffer the thought of the pain that others would go through on top of the pain I knew they were already going through and that makes me feel better about it but the truth is the reason why I'm still here today because God was working in my life and he took me to that critical point and then brought me back he took me to that critical point and brought me back again he took me to a critical point and brought me back again you see because a few years later I've been in church I've been through things that had been surviving things my younger brother who he got baptized at 12 years old but whatever it was he could just never quite overcome he would have good days and bad days good months and bad months ups and downs the it was to a point where luckily he was the last born and the youngest and my parents just they just suffered through it but I had my younger sisters got married and one of my sisters moved out of the house and went and lived with someone else from the church because that was the volatility in the home one minute he was happy and helping and the next minute he was angry and and ready to go to war he'd cuss you up and down and threaten that in the middle of the night he had plans to kill everybody no I I've been plenty of places where if you took that to the ministry they'd say well put him out brother if he isn't going to live the life and live the word you got to make a decision you're going to be for the word are you going to allow your your son and your daughter to keep living in your home like that defiling the home but you as a parent got to say Lord what is it you're what you're doing how is it that you're working father help me to be long-suffering help me to Lord if this is the cross you've called me to bear help me to bear it and Saints he was got to the point where he he attempted suicide more than once he ended up beginning arrested for an altercation went to jail he went to just the county jail for a period of time and my parents continued just trying to love him making sure they made in contact with him made sure he had a little bit of money while he was there to you know for the different things and so who you would realize despite everything you might have done no matter how far you think you've gone we still love you no matter which path you choose in life we love you anyways we want the best for you in your life I can remember being with him in the car one time and saying Gyra I think this life is the best life you could live this life lived for Christ but even if you don't choose that I want to help you live the best life you can live here on this Earth because if you don't choose Christ this is all you're going to get so how could I not want anything but the best for you then if you can't have the best that I have then at least I want the best for you you can have the very best because that's my heart I love you I don't want to see you suffer I don't want to see you struggle I don't want to see you none of those things you see I feel like God has started a little bit of tempering in my life because there'd been plenty of times when I that was not my reaction I can tell you that it's like someone pushes you you push them back you think you're tough I'm tougher you want to go to war let's go that's what the heart and steel will do right no bending no yielding no you know what it's all right I love you anyways I think God was working and you know we won't know a lot of things this side of glory and I'm sorry I'm doing it again this week I'm holding you all really long but you know coming out of jail I just feel like this is so applicable to this what we're talking about this morning and maybe it'll help some of you realize it's it's real saints it's real we come here and we stand before you and maybe you don't you just see a a brother that is well known in the church or someone who you think I'll must be things must be going well for him let's not struggle with anything I tell you it's not true it's not true I've been where each one of you have been I've had the struggles that each one of you have faced and I can tell you this I'm here by the grace of God you see because he came out of jail going back to school quick he came out a different person from that point you know he didn't go back to church right away I think there was a lot of Shame involved like we all would he hadn't been to church probably in a good couple years but he came the most helpful most loving son my parents had ever seen you know my dad is always at this point he'd always had some issues he'd fallen in his back has racked his legs are wrecked as a physically he's a mass and Gyro would go to work with him every day and be like Dad don't lift that let me do that for you Dad let me let me carry that for you let me let me help you with that don't don't do that Dad my dad would just so overjoyed seemed like the sun they had never had had come home it seemed like all the work they'd put in was paying off and I'm gonna bring it might tell the last part here some of you know it some of you don't but this was in 2000 2017. a year before I got married before I came up here we were planning the wedding already I'd ask Jairo to be one of my groomsmen I was so happy so pleased you didn't walk around the house anymore attentively thinking okay what mood is he going to be in when I run to him next there was so much peace in the house it was like a whole nother person and we had so much hope when he was in jail at one of the for any of you who might or might not know you get time slots for your visitations whether that's in person or on the phone or in by video and he had had a video visitation with my parents and um it didn't work and whether it works for you or not your time slot is your time slot and it didn't work and it failed and he was trying to talk to them and just quit working and he lost his time and he got mad and he punched that screen and he shattered it and the system being what it is it's a broken system it's a broken world they added that as a charge that he would face later to the charges he already had and initially he had gone back and served a little bit of time finished it up come back out no he was out and it was about three months after that he had his court date it was on a Wednesday and Saints we thought we were through the thickest of it all we thought the hammering and the forging and the heating was over we thought finally we were going to have a little release and it was a Wednesday and my dad took the day off to go with him they got to the courtroom and they told him well for breaking this item they didn't give you an option to pay for it and give you an option of a fine the only option was another 30 days in jail and he heard that and he was so despondent so taken down my dad told me Jared don't worry about it it'll be 30 days to be over with we'll be ready we'll take care of it you get out of the way we'll move on it'll be fine we'll be here for you we'll be here to love you we're here for you don't worry it'll go quick on the way home Gyro told my dad dad do you mind if we stop by the bank on the way home and I said yeah no problem stop at the bank gyro goes into the bank a little bit later he comes out and my dad said you can take care of what you need to he said yeah I took care of what I needed to they come home that night and we're all getting ready in fact my dad was preaching that night if I remember correctly and came home got ready for church I came home I got was getting ready for church and Jairus that wasn't really going but you know my mom and dad went to walk out that night and he came over to my dad and it wasn't that unusual anymore for this to happen and he said dad he gave my dad a hug and said Dad I love you and I said yeah I love you too jira and we'll see you when we get back tonight I said okay Dad same thing my mom and Mom love you and they left a little bit later I was walking out and he saw him in the kitchen there and I said Sarah see you when I get back and he said yeah yeah see you when I get back went to church my dad ministered I left first and I was coming home I came straight home when I got home I walked into the house and the lights in the kitchen were on and I thought wow Gyros must be in the kitchen I walked back there and he wasn't there I looked down the hall and his bedroom door was open was which was unusual for him if he was inside if you close the bedroom door and I said well I went and looked in the bedroom he wasn't there was just something I just got this feeling and I said something's wrong something is wrong and I went back to the kitchen and there was some French doors with blinds on them window divided lights and there was a porch outside and then just be on the porch a little tree we had planted and the dirt and it just started raining that night just lightly raining and I came into the kitchen and I looked through those windows and I looked a little bit further and the light in the porch was on and I looked through and just beyond that porch laying on the ground there was my brother he'd taken the only gun in the house that wasn't locked up he put it to his head and pulled the trigger it didn't make any sense to me then it doesn't make any sense to me yet today I know God has a purpose in it all I know God's working I know maybe it was his the two times before that when he tried to take his life and he was he wasn't right with my parents he wasn't right with God he was angry at everyone in all of life in the world God spared his life to let him get right that's that's what I believe because that's what makes helps it make more sense to me even to my parents say why is it you see it's a double-edged sword is that he if he would have passed away when he was angry it would have been unbearable but then passing away when it seemed like everything was moving in the right direction makes it feel like there was so much hope and now it's gone but you see I spoke at his service and I said Saints both in life and in death I serve a god who's rich in grace and mercy and that is what I still cling to yet today you see God knew maybe years before that maybe he wasn't able to take his life before that because God knew we weren't ready he said no they won't be able to Bear it yet if I take him home now it'll be too much for them to bear but God will continue shaping your character working on you day by day tempering you and even that I know has tempered parts of my life because suicide is one of those things that all of Christendom and everyone in the message doesn't know what to do with there's pastors out there who've been in the message for 30 years plus who their only concept of someone who would take suicide is don't tell anyone that it's even possible for that person to have been saved because they're worried that it might somehow affect their young people from getting an experience with God thinking that I can just check out a life and I'll and and write it off they forget the fact that if God has something still for you to do neither anyone else or yourself can take your life God is in full control Saints and God doesn't care how you go when he goes if he's done with you God will take you home when he's ready until he's ready you ain't going anywhere we know that look at the prophet look at the prophet there in that iron stage of the of the the forming of his character he said I can't handle this anymore he tried twice Saints he tried twice if it wasn't for God intervening we wouldn't have had a prophet of God he took a loaded gun this man grew up with guns since his birth he didn't make a mistake with it he put that gun to his head and pulled the trigger for every single round in the gun he didn't stop until he had gone through all of them and it wouldn't go off and then he threw it across the room and it went off he was on an electric pole with high voltage power and he said it's too much for me to bear this critical point you've brought me to I can't stand it it's too much Lord I don't know how you thought I was going to make it through this one and he took his rubber gloves off that were protecting him and he put it to that high voltage line he said the next thing I remember I was laying out on the ground at the face of the pole and the shadow of the pole with the crossbars formed across God said no you're in the process and I have a great work for you to do and your character is going to have to be such that it's going to have to be exemplary before the people because you're going to be a wave Chief and get an example to them of a life live Christ in this age you don't get to just check out so Saints if you think you can just skate out on this because it's too hard if you think you can just check out because it's too hard you can run but the trials that will come to bring you back the foraging of the iron will happen so it's up to you to choose will I yield myself to the Masters hammer and anvil who I yield myself to the heat of the Furnace well I willingly take on the character of Christ to reduce the number of times I need to be put back into the furnace am I going to be hard-headed and God's going to have to beat it out of me the whole way that you have a choice on it's up to you this process is going to happen nonetheless give me the very last picture or not the very last one the one with the finished product there I just want to see you see Saints the end product is something that's useful now this is not going home stage this isn't Rapture stage this isn't end of life stage this just means now that you can be put to work you can actually be used in the Master's service depending on how you've been made and what you've been made for at his table in his workshop at War whatever he purpose he made you for now you're in the right shape and condition to be useful oh there will be things in life that'll still come where you'll need to be sharpened from time to time you'll lose your shine and need a little bit of upkeep but now you're ready now you're ready to be put to use in the Master's Hand if the musicians will come Saints whatever stage you're in isn't what matters what matters is to be able to recognize that the Master's working on you God's doing something to realize that you've been placed in the Master's Hand and he's forming you he's working on you he's shaping you he's building your character we all are in different stages and areas some of us are still in the rough we're still in the ore condition some of us have been actually purified a little and Sanctified we've become that iron and now the holy spirit is working on us it's bringing us to that next step of Grace that next step in the in the statue of a perfect man little by little it's bringing you all the way to that place of Christ where you willingly will go to the cross Jesus didn't go to the cross for himself but he went to the cross for you and I and the importance of that that I want to stress right now isn't the fact that he went the cross for you and I but it's the example that he gives you of what the character of Christ should be is that it becomes down to you you or your brother or you or your sister that you'll pick up the cross you'll pick up the trial you'll pick up the struggle you'll pick up the fight for all of them Jesus should have said I I don't need a deal with this I didn't sign up for this this isn't my sin why do I need to be yielded to this why do I need to come under burden for this this is not my burden but he didn't he just said not my will but thine be done see now he was in the condition where he could be used by the father all that conditioning that three and a half years of ministry was all for this one point bringing him to the point where God could use him in his service for you and I and that's the point God wants to bring us is where it's no longer about you it's no longer about your problem it's no longer about your issue it's no longer about you but God has brought you to such a tempered place where his character is so shining through all of the draws and the impurities have been beat out on the Anvil of God's word all that's left is the character of Christ saying Lord if there's anything I can do for my brother let me and even as Stephen preached his heart out did everything he could the last thing you see is the softness and the temperament of Christ in his life saying father hold this not to their charge they know not what they do give me the words to this song see that's what it's all about it's God dealing with us God working on us bringing us all the way to that point that character of Christ where now he's able to use you for others that's the whole thing I know it's a common saying a life lived for Christ a life lift for others and you hear it all the time but that's what it means it means putting yourself under burden or somebody else not because you have to or you're saying Lord let me bear their burden because they're too weak to do so father let me get under and put my shoulders to the wheel and help push this thing out of the rut it's in God will work with you all the way to that point but that's where he's working you too and don't worry he'll get you there he'll get you there you ain't there yet he's got a plan sing this song Precious Lord take my hand brother Joshua [Music] good morning foreign [Music] everything [Music] is amen thank God for this wonderful service that we've had today let's just let's just give my hand foreign [Applause] [Music] I was thinking as we're dismissed because
