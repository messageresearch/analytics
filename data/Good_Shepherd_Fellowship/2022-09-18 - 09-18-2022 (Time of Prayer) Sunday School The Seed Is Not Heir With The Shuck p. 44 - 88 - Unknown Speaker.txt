========================================

[Music] so [Music] i believe here that i take a text like this very odd unusual but sometimes we find god in those odd unusual hours unusual ways unusual things because god is unusual and those that really serve him from their heart serve him in an unusual way to the things are the ways of the world this text is called the seed is not air with the shuck paul here is speaking of the literal seed of abraham's two sons paul gladly is bringing himself in the position of the birth by the free woman now we know that abraham had two sons by two different women god gave him a promise by sarah through sarah rather that there would be a son born and through this son the world would be blessed all nations would be blessed of this son and it's commonly believed especially amongst the jews that this was isaac but it wasn't this promised son of abraham is jesus and he is of the royal seed promise of abraham but abraham having two sons one by by hagar which was his wife's maid a lovely pretty egyptian maid that abraham had picked up down in egypt for her to be her his wife's maid and sarah thinking that god would not be able to keep all of his promise true she told abraham to take agar her maid and to marry her which polygamy was legal in those days and to bring the child and that's the way god had it planned that she was to have the child only through agar but we find out that that wasn't so now we understand also that god is perfected in threes now god is perfected in threes grace is five seven is completion like the world god is perfected in father son holy ghost that's a perfection of the godhead all one god in three manifestations of three attributes of one office of three offices in the one godhead now there is also three imperfection of the steps of grace to the church justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost that consists of the new birth just like a natural birth is tied to by which a woman giving birth to a child the first thing comes forth is water blood then life the bible said in first john 5 7 or 7 5 i believe it is that said there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word which was the son and the holy ghost these three are one there are three that bear witness in the earth the word the water blood and spirit water blood and spirit these three agree in one now the father son and holy ghost are one you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the son without having the holy ghost but you can be justified without being sanctified you can't be sanctified without being filled with the holy ghost we prove that in the order of nature now many of you may i may be strange to you and uh i'm without education i'm sure you already understand but are teaching types as a natural types of spiritual now we see that there are three in the perfection god is perfected in trees now and that was in the perfection of the seed of abraham was ishmael isaac jesus ishmael coming from the bond woman isaac coming from the free woman and both of them with sex but christ jesus coming from the virgin no sex hear the seed one one seed not seeds but one seed these others were not seed of abraham because abraham seed was his faith seed that god was speaking of not his natural seed because after sarah died abraham married another woman and had seven sons besides daughters so it wouldn't be abraham's seeds it was abraham seed one and that was abraham's faith seed pointing to the royal seed that was to come through abraham's faith not abraham's natural life but abraham's spiritual life who took everything contrary to god's word and called it as though it was not and believe god against hope believed in hope that's the real seed that we're speaking of here we are presented with a picture o the seed started the seed of promise started in a slightly doubted doubt of the original promise see it starts low and doubt in the original promise god promised abraham through sarah to have this child but now watch the first seat of abraham by the bonds woman come by sarah doubting that this could happen because she was old and past the age of baron now that's how the church starts that's how it always starts you start from the bottom you don't start from the top a man trying to climb a ladder tries to get on top first he'll break his neck you've got to start and build up to that and here we find the beginning of the promise of god being made manifest through a slightly doubted interrupted program of god amen that's the same way sin began in the garden of eden that's how death started by sin was when one word of god was misconstrued or doubted you can't doubt or misplace one word of god that's the saith the lord word be sold and here's sarah even to who the promise sarah being a woman which is a type of the church gave doubt to the original program of god's promised word and said you abraham my husband take unto you this beautiful maid and live with her and be a husband to her and god will give this seed a promise to her and i'll take the child see just bypassing one little iot change the whole program therefore we've got to take every word of god as thus saith the lord every word of god is true here the seed starts then in a promise slightly doubted isaac being the seed of the free and promised woman brought forth as paul was trying to explain here in galatians he brought forth the natural promised seed and he goes on to say here that the the bonds woman's children cannot be heir with the free woman's children because they are of two different categories and that is true the unbeliever cannot be heir with the believer there's no way at all that's where the trouble is today you can't make a denominational chicken believe with the eagle you just can't do it that's where the trouble comes you've got to believe every word of god you just you're not heirs together neither will you will you join with it you cannot do it you've got to be eagle or chicken amen it could not be air with ishmael the seat of the bonds woman all the because of the doubting sarah doubted god's word that god was able to keep it notice abraham you see what i'm billing over sunday morning abraham did not doubt it sarah did doubt it she was the one it was not adam it doubted it was eve that doubted it so then we find out more about those as we pick it up sunday morning neither can the spiritual be the natural be heir with the spiritual no more can ishmael's children be heir with the with isaac's children and no more than the carnal can be heir with the spiritual church natural church spiritual there is a church natural these women here type and is the church spiritual also so the natural church and the spiritual church cannot be heirs together there are two different separate times two different separate peoples under two different separate covenants that's why the rapture is different and will only be for the royal seed of abraham it cannot come by the natural carnal seat of the church it'll have to be the royal seat of the word of god through abraham the world scene that's why the rapture has to be first of course remember we which are alive and remain shall not hinder prevent those which are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound that any christ shall rise first we which alive and remain shall be caught up with them together and meet the lord in the air notice and again it's written and the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years therefore there they will not be heirs together to not be in the rapture together there's absolutely a church natural and church spiritual a church carnal a church spiritual there see here is no there is no judgment to the royal spiritual predestinated seed of abraham or they are predestinated eternal life they have accepted god's provided sacrifice and that sacrifice which is christ the word and there is therefore now no condemnation saint john 5 24 if you want the scripture there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus romans 8 1 walk not after the flesh but the spirit in romans 5 24 he that heareth my word the word there is understandeth any drunkard anything else can hear it walk away but he that heareth my word understands my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the judgment but pass from death unto life yes earth he that this great mystery of the god made known understands how that god was in christ reconciling himself to the world how that he and the father were one how that the great mysteries of the fulfilling of god taking and bringing himself manifested in the age of human beings and in the stream of human beings and in the company of human beings to make his word manifested in the day in the eastern rising of the sun and to do the same thing as the sun sets in the west to make yourself manifested in a bride church the word may manifest it will to heed that understandeth that is to know that's been revealed to him of him that sent me has everlasting life and will not come into the judgment but it's passed from death unto life the natural seed was only a carrier of the spiritual the seed like the stalk tassel and shuffle we went through that before and another message but i'd like to preview it a little or go back to it again just for a minute now here there is three stages of the seed shows us the true picture the three stages of the natural seed in the earth like a seed is planted brings forth the stalk little blades shoots from it then the tassel then the pollen hangs on that and then the shuck and then the seed again what's these stages of this perfect parable you're in height works out exactly in the type because god is the author of all nature therefore nature cannot fail no more than god can fail because he was the one who set the thing in its condition for for us to look at and to see notice hagar the stalk which was the first beginning of the seed springing up now it didn't look anything like the seed it was a stalk because she was a bonds woman not in the promise at all nothing to do with the word just a transporter of the sea notice sarah the tassel that had the pollen that jewish nation raised from her from climate of sarah brought isaac through isaac bro jacob jacob brought the patriarchs into the patriarchs brought forth a nation marry the virgins faith produce the true spiritual seed notice sarah the tassel that had the pollen that jewish nation raised from her from climate of sarah brought isaac through isaac brought jacob jacob bro the patriarchs and to the patriarchs brought forth a nation mary the virgins faith produced the true spiritual seed word made flesh see the three women three women that this seed was carried to one of them was actually an adultery honor polygamy the second was a free woman and the third one had no sex affair at all but by faith she believed the word of god hagar sarah both sarah and hagar were sex but mary was virgin by the power of the promised word of god that's right the stalk hagar two wives doubted the promise but watch what that brought forth when hagar the second wife of abraham which was just absolutely a concubine wife but she brought forth a man but what kind of a man was he the bible said he was a wild man he lived by his bow and no man would conquer him he's untameable unconvertible undergenerated he could not be tamed he was a wild man because he was of the contrary to god's word in anything his contrary any preacher any lame member any church that's contrary to god's word will bring forth a wild adulterous bunch of worldly hollywood cannot stay with the unadulterated word because it's not even included in the promise sarah the true wife of the promise the being the torso brought forth a gentle man in uh returns brought forth a promised nation that served god but married by no sex at all but believed the promised word when she was a virgin knowing no man and the angel of the lord met her said hail mary blessed art thou amongst the women amen god is with thee and she said how will these things be she said angel said the holy ghost shall overshadow thee it had never been done in all the ages but married leave god and she said be hold the hands made of the lord she believed the word how's she going to have it she know that hagar had the baby by a sex desire with abraham and sarah had the baby by sex desire with abraham children of promise the bonds woman and the free woman but here she's asked to believe that's a contribution to the faith that was in abraham who believes the impossibles as long as god said it's so that makes it right all right she believed god never questions she said behold the hands made of the lord no matter how much criticism i have to bear from the world be unto me there come forth the genuine seed sarah cannot do it because it was sex it's right and neither could sarah because it was sex neither can the church under sectarianism that takes a virgin belief in the word of god that made the promise to bring poor children secretarianism will never bring forth these born church it cannot do to bring forth a substitutionary something it'll bring some for something that imitates it something that tries to be like it but a genuine born-again church of god please the word of god in the face of anything [Applause] [Music] because it's unadulterated it's by the promise of god that these things come mary the true one said by the outset said be it unto me according to thy word behold our hands mate and she brought forth what is she bringing forth not a wild man not a nation but she brought forth the word god himself they manifested in the flesh amen the true seed of god that manifested every promise that god made in the bible without him no man can live without him she was a true seat she was beyond the she was the shock that brought forth the grain now the other two was carriers of life only as a natural seed mary now remember y'all said the other two now mary don't make her god if some people tries to make her she was not a god no sir she was only a carrier of the seat like the rest of them was but like faith in the word brings more to the real image like as the corn matures or the wheat it comes forth to stop then it comes towards the pollen then it comes forth a shock but when you think that shuck if you don't watch it'll look just exactly like the real wheat but when it's opened up the real wheat's on the inside it's only a carrier again so you see mary not through sex but through faith something exactly like it mary was not that seed mary was a carrier of the seed he was a genuine faithy because the word of god is by faith that he give to abraham and only faith can produce what god said faith in his word notice how more like the real thing mary was but like the shepherd the shuck hugs a seed in itself and protects it and nurtures it until it's standing alone mature so has this third church age of pentecost matured holding the screen until it's time to open up the shop mary being the mother of christ just an incubator he was no blood of mary he was no blood of jew he was no blood of gentile he was the blood of god god created this blood he could not be sex he wasn't a junior gentile the baby is not one speck of the mother's blood the blood comes from the father we know the hemoglobins in the male like a chicken it can lay an egg a hen can but if she hasn't been with the male bird the rooster it'll never hatch it's unfertile though it looks exactly like a real fertile egg every nature of it looks the same but it hasn't got the life in it that's the way with people who profess christ many of them look like christians try to act like christians but you've got to have christ on the inside of you which is a word made manifest or it'll never mature into a real bible-believing christian it'll always be a denominational something it cannot live because there's no life in a tulip an egg cannot hatch it rots right in the nest if it hasn't been with a with a male bird just like members of a church you can baby them and call them make them deacons and everything else but you have a nest full of rotten eggs unless they mated with the meat that's right the shop it nurtured it that's right then it that is the seed itself has to leave the shuck or the shock has to leave the seed to get the seed in the presence of the sun so it can be ripened all in type we see see here now how close she the church of this last days gets to look like the seed itself look how this denomination of pentecost that's raised up in the last days and we'll explain it a little later on think how did it come so close to looking just exactly like the seed when a shuck comes forth out of a grain of wheat or a blade of wheat add to the pollen has fallen in there in a second stage and produced the third stage which is the the the shep and how that that if you are not a real post observer you'll never be able to tell but what that's a real grain of wheat in there when that first little grain comes forth looks like a grain but you sit down and open it up and you'll find out there's no grain there at all it's only a shook a carrier of the green now the green comes forth from that but remember there is no more after that sugar remember there was no more seed promise to a woman anywhere after mary and there's no more denominations promised after pentecost it's a rapturing bride coming forth from there the seed the word made manifest again notice see how close it looks [Music] you
