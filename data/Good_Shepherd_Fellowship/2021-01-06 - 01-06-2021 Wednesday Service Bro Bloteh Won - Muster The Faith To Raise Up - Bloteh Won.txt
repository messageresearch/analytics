amen [Music] the lord bless you we will just take a little portion of the word tonight and matthew chapter 7 praise the lord matthew chapter 7 thank you musicians let's just take matthew chapter 7 tonight praise the lord amen amen let's read matthew chapter 7 tonight you know i wanted to i wanted to have read and caught just before just after we got praying got done praying but let's read the scripture and then we will we will read praise the lord amen let's read from verse 12 matthew chapter 7 let's read from verse 12 to 9. what is called the golden rule even the judges will say this is the golden rule therefore all things whatsoever yeah who that man should do to you do you even sow to them for this is the lord and the prophets praise the lord enter year in at the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leader to destruction and many there be which go in there because straight is to give and narrow is the way we should lead it onto life and feel there being that finding beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but in walling they are reading walls yes i know them by their fruits do men gather graves of tongues and faith of tassels even so every good tree bringeth for good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth for evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring food good fruit every tree that brings net food good fruit is held then and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits yes i know them not everyone that served unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me yeah that work iniquity therefore whosoever year at this scene of mine and dustin will are liking him onto a wise man which builded his house upon the rock and the rain descended and the floor came and the wind blowed watch here these three things they are storm elements the rain descended the floor came and the wind blew and beat upon that house and it fell now for it was founded upon the rock and everyone that year it is saying of mine and does them that shall be lacking unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sin and the rain descended the floor came and the wind blew and beat upon that house and he fell and greed was the fall of a yes and it came to pass when jesus has ended this sin the disciples the people sorry were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having authority and not as the stripes let's pray together father we have just read a portion of your sacred word the law will ask the blessing upon it tonight just the reading of your word is written blessed are them that read it and those that yeah father we can close the bible tonight and go home claiming that blessing of reading and hearing your word but we ask that the holy spirit will just come and help us now and then say something that will draw us closer to you we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed who asks you to continue to pray that with brother hillary and his family as uh as he remember his mama he's hoping to to be able to make it home for the funeral trusting that god will be able to make provision and he will take care of everything praise the lord so for this little prayer night a little prayer meeting we talked to have tonight and uh uh i want to i want to say that uh let's let's keep the prayer chain going amen i've already said it on my on my phone to remind me those hours and and you young people you can do the same set it set your phone even if you are at work and i mean when you just get that little reminder you can stand right there and just say lord just give me grace help me to to lay for you to represent you in this place be with my brothers and sisters praise the lord and if you have the time to go on your knees then you can go on your knees amen if you don't have the time you can just stay stand right there you know just be like stonewall jackson amen that was that was where his name came from because he would stand right in the middle of battle when it was time to pray he would just stand right there no matter how the bullets are flying he will lift his voice up and give god thanks amen you can stand right there like stonewall jackson praise the lord amen i just i just wanted to share this quote with you tonight uh sister fate if you can just put my mind uh that's that's that would be the only thing we would read by the way of course tonight and uh [Music] some time ago i was i was sure believing when brother branham was preaching the message perfect faith he said something like this and uh i was looking for this court and then while i was preparing to preach for the the teddy first night i was listening to the message be not afraid and it pops out in my face so i said well i gotta take it and put it into a treasure box amen praise the lord but ben says and i'm grateful to god that the hour is sown at hand i believe it is when god is going to help his children [Music] do you need their help do you really need their help [Music] praise the lord i don't know if i if i did ask the question if you would have raised your hand if i didn't ask the question but every time i read that i know that help is on the way amen praise the lord the hour is here where god is going to help his children and when you look around the world and you see the different things that are happening and you hear the stories of different ones you really know that god is helping his children amen but let's go along a little bit he said god is going to help his children especially it would be for those who can muster the faith that word muster is used in the military is uh is is used in a time of preparation get yourself together get your ass together you know get everything together you know so brother branham is saying it's for those that believe god they believe the message they believe that god sent a prophet but in some way i mean there is just still an area there they are trusting god for amen amen now when he was saying this it was at the birth of the temple he was actually referring to the reason why that ministry was coming praise the lord now when when we think about the tear pool and and the the the creation of scars giving little fish life back you know all of those things is is it's great faith is the fate of the son of man amen but yet it's associated brother listen now it's associated brother branham says there are people that have been on on the waiting list but yet god could show his mercy to a little fish great faith yes but to little situations praise the lord he says god is going to help his children god is going to help his children i i want there to just keep ringing in my brain god is going to help his children especially those who can master the faith to rise up and get ahold of god like they like yes to rise up and get a hold of god there is faith in their heart that they believe that god is real there is faith in their heart that they believe that the message of the hour is the voice of god to us in this day for the faith to rise yes and just get ahold of it and just step into it hallelujah he said but the hour has come where god not the pastor going to help you where god is going to help his children amen amen i believe the lord is providing a way for us now to take care of them also the weak ones you have to remember when moses went to pharaoh and asked let the people go paris yeah you can go and worship go on the mountain and worship and everything the reason why moses really did not take that offer if it was just for the energetic people and the strong man they could go to the mountain and disappear but moses knew there were little ones he knew they were older ones there were feeble ones praise the lord if we go to the mountain and think we should run away these people once will not be able to go so he went back to pharaoh the lord demanding that all the people that we will now leave one feeble one behind and god is making a provision brother branham says god is now providing for those ones the territory is now for the smart ones the there poor are for the weak ones if you remember that god can care for a little fish you remember that god can care for you praise the lord amen amen so god has already made a provision there is no need of you using your weaknesses for an excuse you don't have no excuse because god has already made a provision your excuse will not hold water it will not hold water because god has already made a provision no matter what you are dealing with what you are struggling with there is a provision god has already made a provision that's the reason why we are not leaving one single one behind amen praise the lord amen and we will not just barely admit it we will overcome this bride will not barely make it we're not getting over by the skin of our teeth we are getting over as overcomers because god has already made provision amen praise the lord this supposed to be a prayer meeting amen but i've learned over the years there is there's differences when you pray privately by yourself and you pray as a congregation when you pray as a congregation you don't leave the people behind you get the feelings of the people and when you stand to feel the energy leaving then it's time for you to break the people out you might not understand that but i know what i'm talking about praise the lord thank you your individual prayer life is different from a congregation of prayer life or the congregation of prayer time amen tonight i want to i want to do something i'm going to approach this little subject tonight i hope i can be able to do in a small time that is left for me tonight a pickup from uh from what uh a little bit of what brother daniel was preaching to us on sunday you enjoyed the message on sunday was that a beautiful message amen amen yeah i mean that was just a beautiful teaching praise the lord i mean it just shaped your mind your attitude line everything with the word praise the lord amen it gives you it gives you a good good mental attitude when somebody is struggling amen there is no uh big art and small you you know super believer muscles believer and skinny believer no we are all sons and daughters of god praise the lord so just so just like we had we have the three kinds of believers in this body we also have the the the you know the ten the the both wise and foolish in this body a little bit of that we're going to talk about tonight but what is drawing me to this subject is just a child mind amen it's just a child mind and one of the little kids asks me and says uh but brother daniel said he was preaching on what house would you bail me but he didn't talk about house he just talked about virgins praise the lord and that's where my inspiration is coming from tonight so i had to help the child to see how the divergence is compared to house and for me to help them to see it as is you remember the story of what jesus talked about a wise man built his house so wise virgin house and the foolish man built his house on the sand she says oh yeah so you see the house he was talking about is is is being wise and and and the way he was able to to you know to prepare and and i'm not preaching to a kid tonight i'm just going to tell you that i don't have the inspiration to explain it to you like i did to a kid praise the lord but it just it just then opened another page for me so we're going to look at that tonight remember that uh uh you know jesus taught on the parables so so even with the wise man building his house on the rock and and the foolish man building his house on the sand it was another parable but you have to realize that this this is the beginning of his ministry so who is he dealing with here he's dealing with the leaders at the end of his ministry the same thing he taught as a tenth virgin is the same thing he taught earlier as 10 men that built their house now he's using men that build the house here because he's talking to the leaders praise the lord the scripture help us to see that right here the bible says year praise the lord and the bible says verse the last verse for he taught them as one having authority and not as a strike the stripes were the teachers of the lord amen and and and jesus as he taught this parable bringing them to this place he started in verse 15 he says beware of false prophets prophets means preachers teachers amen he says yeah uh they are they are dressed in in sheep clothing but they are wolves he gets down and and then he starts to talk about uh uh even when he gets down here he sees and many will say unto me lord lord have i not prophesied what is there proclaiming amen have i not prophesied proclaiming i found that cast out devil so so you see here at the early part of his ministry he starts to de-wave the leaders he starts to de-wave the teachers praise the lord now brother branham used this very scripture to preach the message on their their uncommon stomach and and uh uh but we will not really talk about it on coming some tonight but we will look at it in in in the same way pretty much the same way that uh you know our brother preached to us now so we we so that that was the thing that caught my mind while i was i was uh explaining that to the little child it caught my mind now back in the book of proverbs the holy spirit did in chapter 9 uh solomon talked about wisdom building her house on seven pillows amen and in the very same chapter 9 solomon brings out wisdom and he also talks about the foolish woman so you see this whole subject about wise virgin and foolish virgin was was right from the beginning are we together amen was right from the beginning but now jesus at the end of his ministry he's talking about the product you remember in in the in the in the the the the preview of the bride amen now what made brother branham cry i'll stay in line is because when he started seeing the other churchgoer in the wallet church what did he say is this what we have produced amen he said all of this why we've been preaching with all of the revivals that have got is it what we have produced now so yeah jesus at the end of the ministry he's he's telling these leaders that he spoke to a year you will see that a little bit what the product that would come out of them if a wise man built his house on the rock he would definitely get a wise virgin a wise church if a foolish man build his house on the sand he's definitely going to get a foolish product praise the lord so you see it has to first start with the leaders praise the lord you cannot condemn the people and lead the leaders you have to look at the leaders the leaders are responsible for the actions and the attitude of the people are we together so solomon spoke a little bit about that we don't have a lot of time tonight but uh uh uh we will just travel a little bit here so you can see see something here just like i said jesus in his bible he talks about the rain descent the floor came the wind blew like i said these are all storm elements okay and then yeah on the uncommon stone brother brandon there was tommy elements and that's and he was preaching from this message but yeah we see here so you take this now take this as a foundation the wise man built his house jesus is talking in parables amen that if you are wise if you have wisdom your foundation will be solid your foundation will not just be church journey you will not be coming because your parents are coming amen you your foundation will be on the unmovable rock of god's word amen you have to go back in your heart he says why did i believe why did i believe why am i coming to church why am i coming to church what does all of this means to me if everybody leave can i stand alone you have to go back to your foundation [Music] you have to go back to your foundation amen the wise man build his house upon the rock yes hallelujah you have to be talking to yourself instead of being nausea about other people you have to be talking to yourself preaching to yourself yes right what does all of this means to me why why do i spend my time you know coming to church wednesday night coming to church sunday what does all of this means to me have you really put sense to what you are doing oh we are just doing it because other people are doing it and they are encouraging us to do the same praise the lord that thing's coming to my mind i don't want to go there let's just stay right here the lord will help us amen the lord can help us in few words than just going all over the place there was some things coming to my mind but let me just stay with a few words praise the lord let's let's just let's do something tonight again first corinthians 3. remember now this was supposed to be a prayer meeting okay this was supposed to be a prayer meeting amen you love the lord i believe the end you i believe there praise the lord amen first corinthians chapter three here paul is also talking about building and foundation in world of view so let's just look at that let's come to the apostle paul here he might help us amen paul says here over in verse 9 he says for we are liberals together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building amen according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and other builders their but let every man take he how he buildeth their own praise the lord amen amen let every man take he motives and objectives look at your motives and your objectives praise the lord amen you know brown talks about you know the the pharisees how they were just actors you know and and and and much of that sometimes happened with people around church as now you pack your car in the parking lot you look in your rearview mirror straighten your necktie you step out of the car god bless you god bless you you know i mean they're just reeling you know and praise the lord and it's just all acting it's just all right it's just for that moment it's just for that moment there is there is no burden amen there is no sincerity it's just for that moment it's just a show to people it's just a show praise the lord to some people it has become a culture some people they have become their family tradition their dad was doing it that way so they have to do it that way you know that that's the way we know how to do it that's the way we know how to serve god that's the way we believe the message no two persons believe the message the same way because god meet us at different times different experiences don't come don't don't you you can't you you can you can drill a person down in your conviction you can pray for god to deal with them because if they are not taking rightful and left with you they know they are not a believer yet they're not convert they are not converted yet let every man let every man take he how he built their own for all the foundation can no man lay that is lame and what is that foundation jesus christ a personal revelation of jesus christ paul's saying i'm the master builder i was i never met jesus in the flesh amen but as a chief apostle he met me the very way he met peter when peter said thou are christ son of the living god it was by revelation when god blinded paul on the road of damascus it was by revelation now paul said who are thou lord hallelujah yes no other foundation can be laid it's not it cannot be handed down you can't hand it down to your children and grandchildren no it must come by the birth it must come about an experience now listen here now he says if any man build upon this foundation go silver pressure stones wood hell and stubbles now he's taking three these are six elements six elements six is the number of men but three of them are god-given and three i marry me is god i give gold is god i give siva is god that gave precious stones praise the lord wood is a man that cut the tree down to make wood god gave him tree he cut it down to make wood are we together so there are three god-given elements and there are three mammy elements so paul is saying if any man is building that's how you have to go back and look at your motives and objectives praise the lord and see this thing is god that is dealing with me i'm not just following praise the lord because if a man is doing what he's doing because god is leading him and god is dealing with him it's a precious storm it could be gold it could be silver it could be warm pressure stones all the precious stones are not the same but a man can be on the other side yeah i mean uh building a big caterer so so i so i can have the biggest church in minneapolis a man can be on the other side you know trying to you know impress people may i i mean i i i got my commission and an angel met me and an injured and you can do all of those things and he's just carving wood all he's doing oh it's a hill that he's putting together the lord now think about it now wise man built his house and a foolish man built his house so paul now by revelation he's taking what jesus preached and he's bringing it in depth that in building house praise the lord amen are we together paul says every man work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it for the day shall declare it every man work will be made manifest that's one thing when god left eternity and broke into time you have to realize he came into time with as as the spirit of truth the internal spirit of truth so there is one thing about time it always tells the truth just give time you will know the man for who he is or you know a person for who they claim to be every man work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire if you put fire to gold it shines you put fire to savor it with stain fire to precious to whatever precious tone it is it's going to come out better you put fire to it will burn and burn the whole house down amen the same thing you put fire to a bunch of hell he's going to do the same thing how we together but watch here now if you bring this subject into the context of what jesus preached or taught on the 10th virgin that brother daniel talked about then you will understand why paul made this statement he says every man and he says if any man works abide which he have built that upon he shall receive a reward if any man work shall be burned he shall suffer lust but he himself shall be saved yet so by fire praise the lord amen you see that's that that is the reason why uh uh uh uh the foolish virgin would not go in the rapture but she would be saved by her testimony she will have to stand for the word praise the lord i mean she will realize she will start seeing things happening i say oh my god i mean all of these things if these things are happening you know it means that the rapture has gone but she will be able to stand now if we cannot stand when there is no pressure when we cannot stand praise the lord when we cannot stand when there is nobody around you giving you pressure praise the lord you think about that i mean little things we we we compromise and give into little spirits and little doubts and little gossip and little argument and i mean i mean it's just it's just hard for people to take a stand i mean sometimes it just looked like all of these all of these people running into the street to to riot you know sometimes you ask them what is it they can't even explain to you they're just going because there's a crowd that is growing no conviction no purpose they've just been caught under the wrong spirit and the believer must not be like that amen if if a situation comes up i mean people should be able to relax and know that god is in control relax and don't take the situation in your hands relax and know that god is in control and then you ask yourself now how can i apply myself to this situation what is my place but soon a little situation come the other person you hear what happened oh i know about it and then it just started going like that why fire he says knowing that that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you amen you are the temple of god you are the house that is being built but the materials that i use is what will make the house to stand amen the material that i use this message has been used to build all sorts of houses all sorts of houses people have used this gospel to build some has used it to build their retirement relaxed home on the lake some has used it to to build a kingdom where the people carry them on their back and shoulders [Music] is the material that is used that's why we make that house to stand that's why you have to go back go back to your heart and say lord where am i with you [Music] where am i with you where am i with you praise the lord lord this this is not follow follow it's me and jesus so you see here i'm just i'm just trying to answer that little chai question we see right here how jesus trying to deal with those leaders trying to deal with the leaders because what they were holding to the the law these were the very people that would condemn republican and they can knock their chests and both of it we are children of abraham all because they have the right measurement in their skirts amen and they are born of a certain tribe they were circumcised on the eighth day so all of that was what they talked as righteousness all of that was what they talked jesus speaking to them in parable and says tell me then who is your neighbor he says three men went traveling down the stripe the pharisees and the samaritan they went and saw the beggar down the street the stripe comes says he's sin that's why he's suffering like that that he seemed made him to suffer and he went his way the pharisees came his own garment was so clean he just can't touch that man but a stranger a samaritan came and took the man and carried him found a place for him to be taken care of yes the way they were taught conditioned them to behave the way they were behaving the way they were taught some people this message has made them so proud so proud that they don't even have respect with the message respect they read and listening to they don't have respect they don't know what it is they can only tell you the prophet said quote 100 and this that's what the prophet said but respect as a life they don't have it the way you were taught is expressed in your action that's what jesus was talking about praise the lord the wise man built his house upon the rock and when the storm came the storm element the rain the wind the flood his foundation was solid his foundation was solid let's watch our attitude there's something our thoughts musicians you can come let's go to the lord in prayer let's watch our attitude let's zoom in our thoughts for the
