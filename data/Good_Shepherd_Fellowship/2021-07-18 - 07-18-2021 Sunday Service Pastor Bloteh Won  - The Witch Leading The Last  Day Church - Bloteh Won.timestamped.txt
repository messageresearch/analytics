[26:05] as you probably heard that i my heart's
[26:08] been a little bit tired
[26:10] lately the last couple of months and so
[26:13] thought i better go in and get a checkup
[26:14] and so i went in thursday morning and
[26:17] they did an angiogram to check the blood
[26:19] flow and
[26:20] there was a couple of pipes that were
[26:22] clogged so they needed to
[26:24] to put a little stent in there and so
[26:26] i'm feeling a lot better
[26:28] i just want to say i appreciate your
[26:29] prayers and
[26:31] see me through and i just want to
[26:33] especially
[26:34] appreciate him for seeing us through
[26:37] just ask the great physician to be there

[26:44] just want to come back
[26:46] wanna want to be like that one leper who
[26:50] came back just to thank the lord amen
[26:55] hallelujah man

[53:38] in these troubled times that we are
[53:40] living in praise the lord
[53:42] for he is our strength and he is our
[53:45] protector
[53:47] praise the lord we continue to leave
[53:50] uh sister christie in the hands of the
[53:52] lord that she gets close to the time of
[53:54] deliverance
[53:54] that angel of the lord will wash over
[53:56] her baby praise the lord amen
[54:00] and uh go to see brother lloyd
[54:07] it's hard for him it's hard for you to
[54:08] hire yourself
[54:10] for example a couple of years back uh
[54:14] we we as we the law started
[54:18] helping us and and things that are
[54:21] happening
[54:22] uh uh her brother andrews and brother
[54:26] steve jambibi were talking about uh a
[54:29] way of
[54:29] outreach and to do something
[54:32] like a website and but andrew spoke to
[54:36] me about it as he go for it
[54:38] and he he put
[54:41] some time his skills together to be able
[54:44] to
[54:45] uh give us a platform
[54:48] for the website i needed to be filled
[54:50] with
[54:52] with different different things and
[54:56] then brother brother jordan kim came on
[54:59] board and started
[55:00] providing things to be added to the
[55:03] website in
[55:04] and as uh you know when you put
[55:08] something on the on the internet pretty
[55:10] soon
[55:11] you start to have you know people
[55:14] running into it whether intentionally or
[55:17] by accident
[55:18] so then over a period of time
[55:22] [Music]
[55:25] but lloyd we were talking something i
[55:28] think i
[55:28] just spoke with brother jordan brother
[55:31] andrews one of the two
[55:33] and we were talking about how we can and
[55:36] do something
[55:37] you know
[55:40] about our website uh improve it then
[55:44] what
[55:44] what it is and just in that time
[55:48] it felt good that uh the lord was uh
[55:52] into that line of work so a conversation
[55:55] came up
[55:56] and uh i mean since since he cannot get
[55:59] away from this
[56:00] church
[56:05] he tried to go and he keeps fighting
[56:10] keep calling and trying to find out
[56:12] what's going on so
[56:14] so then we or we got into a talk and and
[56:17] realized that
[56:18] uh we can do better than what we have we
[56:21] already have the platform
[56:23] the the the trustees have already gone
[56:27] and paid for
[56:29] additional year to the group that is
[56:31] hosting us
[56:33] so why not make it more
[56:36] appealing and and once again there
[56:39] because uh this is this is the internet
[56:43] age that we are living in
[56:44] whether you like it or not praise the
[56:46] lord amen what are you
[56:49] i think you agree maybe you don't like
[56:51] the internet but you have to agree that
[56:52] this is the internet
[56:54] age we are we are buying our food on the
[56:56] internet we are buying
[56:58] our clothes on the internet we uh uh
[57:01] you know everything everything praise
[57:03] the lord
[57:05] because we can go on and on so it's is
[57:08] it's also uh
[57:11] one of the the biggest platform
[57:15] for evangelizing and that was one of the
[57:18] reason why
[57:20] we decided to go into uh
[57:23] into a website and
[57:27] the purpose it is was not to be like
[57:30] others the purpose was
[57:33] to reach out to our
[57:37] community and friends so uh
[57:40] so then we thought if that is the
[57:42] purpose there is a better way to achieve
[57:44] it
[57:45] so brother law came on board and then he
[57:47] gave us some ideas
[57:49] and we thought that well okay i think we
[57:52] can
[57:52] we can use that so uh he's working with
[57:56] but andrews
[57:57] and uh to uh to be able to
[58:01] improve the church website so he been
[58:04] around
[58:05] this weekend he taught that uh
[58:09] it would be good to put a face to the
[58:12] name
[58:14] so so that's the reason why you see him
[58:18] like
[58:20] you know like
[58:22] [Laughter]
[58:26] so he's he's taking a few pictures that
[58:29] we will be able to use uh
[58:31] uh as as they improve the website so
[58:34] right after service
[58:36] uh a few of us that are here we gather
[58:38] before the church
[58:39] those that have the vehicle right in the
[58:41] front there you
[58:42] just move it away so we can stand out
[58:45] there
[58:46] or whichever way he would direct us to
[58:48] take
[58:50] a group photo together for those that
[58:52] were that are not able to be here
[58:54] we will include you one way or the other
[58:57] so
[58:58] uh that's that's the reason why that's
[59:02] the reason why he's not leading songs
[59:03] and he's kneeling down taking pictures
[59:09] can i uh say something in just 90
[59:10] seconds yeah quick so
[59:13] just to kind of add to what he said and
[59:15] brother andrew's done a great job every
[59:17] once i'm
[59:18] every time i come back i get excited
[59:20] because i see the church growing
[59:22] not just in people but you can see the
[59:24] vision is continuing to grow
[59:25] we're doing things we're not just saying
[59:27] wow we're a great church and we just
[59:28] stick
[59:29] we just like settle back or whatever
[59:31] like it would be very easy i remember
[59:33] when this church was
[59:34] 12 people no instruments we had a
[59:38] tambourine and that's
[59:39] it and this church is a new church
[59:42] there's life here
[59:43] and it's a wonderful thing to see it is
[59:46] a wonderful thing to see
[59:48] and i'm so excited to be a part of this
[59:50] this is a testament
[59:51] to god's work absolutely it is
[59:54] and you all should you come to church
[59:57] with that that
[59:59] the honor of those that have gone before
[1:00:01] you and the honor of being
[1:00:02] a part of it today that you're a part of
[1:00:04] a mission this is a mission
[1:00:06] right here in minneapolis a city that is
[1:00:08] hurting
[1:00:09] you can look outside those doors i mean
[1:00:11] wasn't there a shooting right over there
[1:00:14] this is a city that needs god this is a
[1:00:16] city that needs god and
[1:00:18] for such a time as this god puts a
[1:00:20] church that he's been preparing
[1:00:23] for decades to a point where it has life
[1:00:26] and it's ready
[1:00:27] and that's the whole vision with doing
[1:00:29] something like a website there was a
[1:00:30] time where
[1:00:31] you grabbed a soapbox you stood on the
[1:00:33] corner that was the way the the word
[1:00:35] in every age there's always been a place
[1:00:37] jesus went to the to the courts of
[1:00:39] solomon
[1:00:40] to speak that's actually they would go
[1:00:42] to the town square and speak to the
[1:00:43] people
[1:00:44] they would go in the 1950s 1920s they
[1:00:47] would go stand on the corner with a
[1:00:48] soapbox
[1:00:49] they would hand out tracks that was the
[1:00:51] way that people
[1:00:52] communicated at that time the way that
[1:00:55] people communicate
[1:00:56] today is on a website it's on social
[1:00:59] media
[1:01:00] and it's not to get on there and debate
[1:01:02] and argue i think a lot of christianity
[1:01:04] has gotten on there like we need to
[1:01:05] argue
[1:01:05] no we simply need to share
[1:01:09] the truth there are people right out
[1:01:12] those doors
[1:01:13] that are looking for what we have here
[1:01:15] and so don't if i'm here taking pictures
[1:01:17] doing like oh my god he's taking
[1:01:18] pictures of me why
[1:01:19] no no no our goal is to capture that to
[1:01:24] capture what we have that light
[1:01:27] not to hide it under a bushel not to be
[1:01:29] afraid
[1:01:31] but to broadcast it to everyone that's
[1:01:34] our whole goal
[1:01:36] amen that's all i wanted to say praise
[1:01:38] the lord
[1:01:39] [Applause]
[1:01:45] you know he's my son in the gospel
[1:01:48] he took a habit to stop him whenever
[1:01:52] you know he just take that liberty he
[1:01:54] enjoys it
[1:01:56] and and i enjoy it when he does it too
[1:01:59] praise the lord praise the lord he's a
[1:02:02] good friend of mine
[1:02:04] the lord bless you musicians we will
[1:02:07] sing a little bit after the service
[1:02:08] let's get to the word this morning
[1:02:12] this morning i want to i want to bring
[1:02:14] your attention to something
[1:02:16] uh i was trying to get away from this
[1:02:19] but it was not getting away
[1:02:22] from me until this morning when i woke
[1:02:24] up again is
[1:02:25] it just as soon as i woke up
[1:02:30] around around four o'clock
[1:02:33] thought just the thought just came on my
[1:02:36] mind and i said lord i really need to
[1:02:38] prepare this subject
[1:02:40] and uh because it's a subject that would
[1:02:44] sound to you a little bit like
[1:02:45] demonology but uh
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:50] it is it's a subject also
[1:02:53] that uh you know
[1:02:56] kind of show us a little bit of some of
[1:02:58] the things that is happening
[1:03:00] around the christian church and
[1:03:02] especially around our cycle
[1:03:04] and
[1:03:10] take it more in the sense of of
[1:03:14] influence we want to talk about
[1:03:15] influence but
[1:03:17] uh we want to bring it in in in a kind
[1:03:20] of a prophetic way
[1:03:22] from the message masterpiece brother
[1:03:24] brandon
[1:03:25] vision he had about the preview of the
[1:03:29] bride
[1:03:30] so you have to remember now we've been
[1:03:32] talking about
[1:03:34] john position uh uh in revelation
[1:03:38] chapter three right between revelation
[1:03:39] chapter three and revelation chapter
[1:03:41] four
[1:03:42] that's what we've been talking about so
[1:03:45] uh
[1:03:46] uh i i just pray that uh the lord will
[1:03:49] be able to
[1:03:50] to help us as we deal with this
[1:03:53] let's stand to our feet and we will read
[1:03:56] from the book of galatians chapter 1
[1:04:00] praise the lord amen
[1:04:04] i hope i'm not missing anybody
[1:04:09] if i didn't call your name it's because
[1:04:11] i love you
[1:04:16] that's that's the way of showing my love
[1:04:18] by just ain't knowing you a little bit
[1:04:29] yeah praise the lord
[1:04:35] galatians chapter one let's read from
[1:04:37] verse one just for the scripture reading
[1:04:39] it will be able to help us a little bit
[1:04:41] paul an apostle
[1:04:46] paul an apostle not of man
[1:04:49] needed by man but by jesus christ
[1:04:55] and god the father will raise him from
[1:04:57] the dead
[1:05:00] and all the brethrens which are with me
[1:05:02] unto the church
[1:05:04] of galilee grace be unto you and peace
[1:05:06] from god the father
[1:05:08] and from our lord jesus christ will
[1:05:13] give himself for our sins
[1:05:17] that he might deliver us from the
[1:05:20] present
[1:05:21] evil word i would like to read that
[1:05:24] greeting this game
[1:05:25] grace be unto you in peace from god the
[1:05:28] father
[1:05:29] and from our lord jesus christ who gave
[1:05:32] himself
[1:05:35] for our sins that he might deliver us
[1:05:39] from this present evil
[1:05:42] word i believe we all believe the word
[1:05:46] is
[1:05:46] evil i call in to the will of god
[1:05:51] and our father to whom be glory for ever
[1:05:54] and ever
[1:05:55] amen he says in verse six
[1:05:58] a marvel that ye are so
[1:06:02] soon removed from him
[1:06:05] who call you into this grace
[1:06:09] of christ onto another gospel
[1:06:13] which is not another
[1:06:17] but there are some
[1:06:21] that trouble you and who
[1:06:24] pervert the gospel of christ
[1:06:27] but though we or an angel from heaven
[1:06:31] preach any other gospel unto you
[1:06:34] then that which we have preached
[1:06:37] unto you let him be a curse
[1:06:42] praise the lord let's go to chapter 3.
[1:06:54] praise the lord
[1:07:00] paul brings the introduction
[1:07:04] and then the lord bless you you can have
[1:07:06] you see while we read chapter three
[1:07:08] verse one all foolish galatians
[1:07:12] who hath bewitched you that you should
[1:07:16] not obey the truth
[1:07:19] before whose eyes jesus christ
[1:07:23] have been evidently set forth crucified
[1:07:27] among you praise the lord
[1:07:33] this owner will i learn of you receive
[1:07:36] here the spirit
[1:07:38] by the works of the lord all by the
[1:07:41] hearing of faith i is so foolish
[1:07:46] having begun in the spirit
[1:07:50] i am now made perfect by the flesh
[1:07:55] praise the lord now so just for the
[1:07:59] background here we
[1:08:00] we kind of realized that we are in such
[1:08:03] a time
[1:08:04] like the church of galicia was in where
[1:08:07] in there is uh there is a spirit that
[1:08:11] rolls up among the people and started
[1:08:15] challenging what they have believed
[1:08:17] there was something that came among the
[1:08:19] people and started
[1:08:20] trying to take them from the the
[1:08:24] experience from from the move of god
[1:08:26] that was among the people
[1:08:28] and now i'm trying to bring them back in
[1:08:30] the flesh
[1:08:31] and bring them back to to law and
[1:08:34] other and all of that instead of being
[1:08:37] led by the holy spirit
[1:08:40] now so paul year the apostle of jesus
[1:08:44] christ
[1:08:45] is now likening that
[1:08:48] uh that influence that is among the
[1:08:52] people
[1:08:52] as a bewish me
[1:08:56] that the church now is being bewitched
[1:09:00] because of what is happening
[1:09:03] so this morning i will i will read
[1:09:08] that little uh masterpiece uh
[1:09:12] testimony in there and uh
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:17] and then we will be able to see that but
[1:09:20] for
[1:09:20] the a little
[1:09:23] subject i'm i'm actually going to talk a
[1:09:26] little bit on witchcraft
[1:09:30] it's going to be uh strange but i want
[1:09:33] to talk
[1:09:33] on the witch leading the last day of
[1:09:36] church
[1:09:42] the witch leading the last church
[1:09:49] masterpiece uh this this was a vision
[1:09:53] almost like like a trance that that was
[1:09:56] recorded for us
[1:09:58] i was going to tell a vision
[1:10:01] for my first time i fell into a trance
[1:10:05] and when i did there was somebody with
[1:10:08] me
[1:10:09] i didn't see the person uh uh
[1:10:13] it was just a voice
[1:10:17] i looked this way he said the bride
[1:10:22] will come in view
[1:10:25] for preview praise the lord
[1:10:28] the bride will come in view for preview
[1:10:32] and a lot coming to me and i've seen
[1:10:36] the most prettiest bunch of
[1:10:39] clean dress women i have
[1:10:42] i ever seen in my life
[1:10:45] praise the lord now realize here that uh
[1:10:49] uh god in in the scripture
[1:10:53] he has always used a woman as a type of
[1:10:56] the church
[1:10:57] that's why paul said in the book of
[1:10:59] ephesians
[1:11:00] christ is is a type of the man
[1:11:04] the woman is a type of the church so god
[1:11:07] here now was trying to give
[1:11:10] a vision about the church
[1:11:14] keep in mind again what we talked about
[1:11:16] john what john position was
[1:11:18] the the revelation of the seven church
[1:11:21] ages
[1:11:22] the revelation of the seven golden
[1:11:25] candlestick
[1:11:26] the understanding of that could not have
[1:11:28] come in the episode church
[1:11:30] age because the principle here
[1:11:34] is when god has already done something
[1:11:38] then we turned back we turn around and
[1:11:40] look for us
[1:11:41] to understand it we don't understand the
[1:11:44] ways of god before it happen
[1:11:49] we know that when he does does something
[1:11:51] in the heavens
[1:11:53] it reflects on earth but in the heavens
[1:11:56] is
[1:11:56] already a finish work for us to have a
[1:12:00] reflection on earth
[1:12:02] we don't look at god's work and
[1:12:04] understand it before it happened
[1:12:06] it already happened then we look back
[1:12:09] and say
[1:12:10] oh this is what was going on
[1:12:14] praise the lord are we together
[1:12:19] so uh so what is happening here now
[1:12:23] uh uh in in this in this last age
[1:12:26] now a preview so the church just like
[1:12:30] the seven golden candlestick the church
[1:12:32] is coming in preview
[1:12:34] right from the ephesus church age over
[1:12:37] to the laodicea church
[1:12:38] age
[1:12:42] are we together so from the ephesus
[1:12:44] church
[1:12:45] age the church came
[1:12:48] as one of the prettiest bunch of
[1:12:51] clean-dressed women i've ever seen in my
[1:12:54] life
[1:12:56] because that church was born with
[1:12:59] with with god distributing himself
[1:13:05] the bible says 120 men were in the upper
[1:13:09] room
[1:13:10] with women and each one of them
[1:13:14] had clothing tons of fire upon their
[1:13:18] head
[1:13:19] god did not gave the holy ghost to just
[1:13:21] peter
[1:13:22] and said shake the hands of the rest of
[1:13:24] them but
[1:13:25] every one of them had an experience
[1:13:30] of a lake of fire over their head
[1:13:36] praise the lord even the women
[1:13:40] even merit the mother of jesus
[1:13:46] they all had a first-hand experience
[1:13:52] it was not a pass down
[1:13:56] it was not because the pastor
[1:13:59] i received the holy ghost so the rest
[1:14:02] received no
[1:14:03] every one of them had a fresh experience
[1:14:07] and god repeated it again in the house
[1:14:10] of kalinas
[1:14:12] to the gentiles so
[1:14:15] the earlier church was the
[1:14:18] cleanest prettiest
[1:14:21] church
[1:14:25] are we together because they had
[1:14:30] exactly the bible says that
[1:14:33] they called them christians because they
[1:14:35] knew that they were with christ
[1:14:38] they saw the life that they live
[1:14:42] when peter and james got dead and met
[1:14:45] that man
[1:14:46] and they get a beautiful they said seven
[1:14:48] and goal we have
[1:14:49] now but what we have received
[1:14:53] we gave to you in the name of jesus
[1:14:55] christ
[1:14:56] rise up and walk praise the lord
[1:15:00] amen when uh uh uh
[1:15:04] uh uh ananias and
[1:15:07] and sapphira over in us chapter 5
[1:15:10] try to be uh selfish
[1:15:14] and
[1:15:19] we know what happened to them god there
[1:15:21] with them and it was something that
[1:15:23] happened before the entire congregation
[1:15:25] you know god they dare to to humble the
[1:15:28] heart of the people
[1:15:29] to make them to realize that they are
[1:15:32] not dealing with men
[1:15:34] they are dealing with almighty god
[1:15:37] praise the lord and as soon as we come
[1:15:39] to that realization
[1:15:41] that as a church as a believer you are
[1:15:44] not dealing with man you are dealing
[1:15:45] with almighty god
[1:15:47] it will change your life forever
[1:15:51] so let's let's continue and yet i've
[1:15:53] seen come in it was the most pretty
[1:15:55] bunch
[1:15:56] of clean-dressed women i've ever seen in
[1:15:58] my life but
[1:15:59] each one of them looked like was dressed
[1:16:03] different they all
[1:16:06] had long hair now you have to remember
[1:16:09] now there's the bride
[1:16:11] uh in preview so uh uh it's a bride that
[1:16:15] is coming from
[1:16:16] from from every nations amen because we
[1:16:19] realized that uh
[1:16:20] 300 000 were added to the church that
[1:16:23] day
[1:16:23] after they received the holy ghost and
[1:16:26] peter went
[1:16:27] and and and gave his testimony so there
[1:16:30] were many
[1:16:31] many others you know that came in and we
[1:16:34] saw how the fire starts to spread
[1:16:36] so let's continue to read here but each
[1:16:38] one of them
[1:16:39] look like was dressed different they all
[1:16:41] have long hair long sleeves
[1:16:43] and skirts and so far the low kind of i
[1:16:47] uh
[1:16:48] i said about uh maybe about 20
[1:16:51] you know they were in the best of their
[1:16:53] age and you know all
[1:16:55] pretty pretty girls now
[1:16:58] i have the bible open here before me and
[1:17:00] i'm telling the truth
[1:17:02] that's all about it i just have to tell
[1:17:06] you
[1:17:07] she she was looking right
[1:17:10] and and one was talking to me
[1:17:14] and stand together her eyes she
[1:17:18] was the cleanest sweetiest looking
[1:17:21] people
[1:17:21] i ever seen in my life look like
[1:17:25] it could be a dawson or more i don't
[1:17:28] know how many
[1:17:30] uh there was but there was
[1:17:33] just a group of them and she passed by
[1:17:37] sweetly with their head in in in
[1:17:41] in her eyes up watching
[1:17:44] as she passed by oh she was beautiful
[1:17:47] i looked at her and as she passed by
[1:17:52] he said now we shall reveal
[1:17:56] praise the lord said that's the bride
[1:18:00] now we will reveal the church
[1:18:04] now so god show him
[1:18:07] the bride but now he's going to
[1:18:11] review the church
[1:18:14] praise the lord are we together we're
[1:18:17] going to
[1:18:18] review the church and
[1:18:24] and they come i notice them coming and
[1:18:27] when they come
[1:18:28] up each one looks like got worse
[1:18:31] so every time the church progressed it
[1:18:34] got worse
[1:18:37] each one looks like got worse when the
[1:18:40] church
[1:18:41] left from one age to another age it got
[1:18:44] worse
[1:18:44] because the thing about it there is that
[1:18:46] when every age comes
[1:18:48] the messenger brings his message it
[1:18:50] gathers the bride out of that
[1:18:52] age the church continued
[1:18:56] are we together
[1:19:04] i noticed them coming up and when they
[1:19:06] come each one
[1:19:08] looks like got worse i've never seen
[1:19:10] such a filthy bunch in my life
[1:19:12] and and when he said i heard a noise
[1:19:16] and and i said next here comes
[1:19:19] that american group now this this
[1:19:23] this phrase here american group
[1:19:26] uh uh it has
[1:19:29] it has a way i mean many people have
[1:19:31] said whatever they want to say about it
[1:19:33] but what i think about it is that
[1:19:36] we have to realize that uh uh
[1:19:40] uh azusa's creed experienced
[1:19:43] the the pentecostal revival
[1:19:47] and after the pentecostal revival
[1:19:51] that happened in azusa street there was
[1:19:54] a great evangelism that that started to
[1:19:58] spring forth from
[1:19:59] america and then america
[1:20:03] started to support because the
[1:20:05] pentecostal church
[1:20:07] when when it has its original experience
[1:20:10] at azusa street but as the church went
[1:20:13] the church broke into two groups
[1:20:16] when the church started to organize it
[1:20:19] was
[1:20:20] the assembly of god and the united
[1:20:22] pentecostal
[1:20:25] those were the two organizations that
[1:20:27] came out of azusa street
[1:20:30] praise the lord so uh
[1:20:34] america played a a a a
[1:20:37] a great role in in sending the gospel
[1:20:40] around the world and sending
[1:20:42] missionaries
[1:20:43] in sending a a a a representation
[1:20:48] of every denominational group
[1:20:54] are we together so when i see
[1:20:57] this that's where my mind comes to i
[1:21:00] don't look at it as just
[1:21:02] a national thing i look at it as a
[1:21:04] position
[1:21:07] from word and influence when around the
[1:21:09] world
[1:21:12] are we together okay
[1:21:16] now i'm an american but this just make
[1:21:19] me sick
[1:21:21] i'm not eloquent enough
[1:21:25] in a mixed audience to say uh uh
[1:21:29] what is taking place you you have to
[1:21:32] read between the lines so it is i read
[1:21:34] in between the line now i'm telling you
[1:21:35] what i'm reading between the lines
[1:21:37] when i look at that but when the
[1:21:40] when the woman were coming the leader
[1:21:45] of them was a witch
[1:21:48] now so you see that's where my
[1:21:50] inspiration is coming from
[1:21:52] amen the wish that leaves
[1:21:56] the last days church
[1:21:59] is not a person it's a system
[1:22:03] that has an influence
[1:22:08] praise the lord is a system
[1:22:11] that has an influence
[1:22:15] are we together she
[1:22:18] had a great long nose and and
[1:22:21] and a great big mouth and all of them
[1:22:25] were dressed
[1:22:27] with some kind of of a lower clothes
[1:22:30] down years but the top just
[1:22:33] had a stripe and and about
[1:22:37] half inch tribe that moved up and and
[1:22:40] went around
[1:22:41] like this each and each each of
[1:22:44] uh the women had that in their other
[1:22:47] now so the church here is is is now
[1:22:51] after the after the bride came
[1:22:54] in preview now the church is now being
[1:22:58] revealed amen
[1:23:01] so uh uh we we seen that every time at
[1:23:05] the
[1:23:05] as the age progressed the church got
[1:23:08] worse and and you know and and she's
[1:23:11] getting
[1:23:12] more words in the in the state that that
[1:23:15] she's in
[1:23:16] let's read down a little bit and uh
[1:23:20] and there she went and she went singing
[1:23:23] told the twists and the rose songs rock
[1:23:26] and roll
[1:23:27] you know ever what you call it going
[1:23:30] down sinking like that
[1:23:31] going behind i said is that the church
[1:23:36] i was standing there in my and in my
[1:23:39] heart i was crying
[1:23:44] so my notion is nothing else but the
[1:23:47] word because everything that
[1:23:48] that starts now to appear in the vision
[1:23:51] that's supposed to be the church just
[1:23:53] keep turning over
[1:23:55] into worldliness and worthiness and
[1:23:58] worthiness
[1:24:00] are we together
[1:24:09] to my notion is nothing else but the
[1:24:11] word but
[1:24:12] see she's that were council of churches
[1:24:16] leading them
[1:24:17] right straight down the road where
[1:24:21] she was going praise the lord
[1:24:25] she went off to the left and disappeared
[1:24:29] in chaos
[1:24:32] still beating this music
[1:24:36] and making real funny sounds
[1:24:40] and shaking their body
[1:24:43] side to the other
[1:24:48] and then the other side and like that
[1:24:50] carrying on like that
[1:24:52] praise the lord
[1:24:55] i just started to buy my hair and he
[1:24:58] said wait
[1:24:59] the bride must come again
[1:25:04] praise the lord now you see that is the
[1:25:07] reason why
[1:25:08] we have to experience a restoration
[1:25:13] amen we have to experience a restoration
[1:25:17] of the
[1:25:17] apostolic faith the hearts of the
[1:25:20] children must go back
[1:25:22] to the apostolic fathers we must go back
[1:25:24] to biblical principles
[1:25:29] praise the lord because the bride
[1:25:32] must come again are we together
[1:25:36] and we can say that you know we are glad
[1:25:39] now when we when we look at this subject
[1:25:42] you know uh uh is is a subject that
[1:25:45] sometimes people
[1:25:47] uh feel a little bit uh uh indifferent
[1:25:50] to talk about
[1:25:53] but just like i said it's an influence
[1:25:56] and i want for us to look
[1:25:57] very closely now because we we're going
[1:25:59] to look into some structural things
[1:26:01] as we study this together we must re
[1:26:05] we must realize that uh uh
[1:26:10] we have uh anniversary that uh that is
[1:26:12] that is warring against
[1:26:14] us it is satan that oh serpent called
[1:26:17] the devil praise the lord
[1:26:19] amen in every sin and
[1:26:22] every sickness and every faint evil in
[1:26:26] the world today
[1:26:27] starts from rebellion
[1:26:32] praise the lord when he rebelled against
[1:26:36] god praise the lord
[1:26:39] we have to realize that uh uh
[1:26:43] uh uh he had a place and uh and one time
[1:26:47] uh he he was a leader and one time
[1:26:51] he was in a place of of worshiping god
[1:26:55] but when iniquity was found in him
[1:27:00] praise the lord amen when iniquity
[1:27:04] was found in him
[1:27:08] and with that he rebelled against god
[1:27:12] now the reason why i'm i'm uh
[1:27:16] i'm bringing this uh to this
[1:27:19] is because that's what first samuel
[1:27:24] 15 23 led us to know
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:31] first samuel 15 23.
[1:27:46] since we are getting ourselves ready for
[1:27:48] a great translation
[1:27:51] praise the lord every time we come
[1:27:54] to church we come to
[1:27:58] to change our our garment
[1:28:01] and to get in a one that is more cleaner
[1:28:03] than the one that we came with
[1:28:06] praise the lord and it's only the word
[1:28:08] that can
[1:28:09] that can that can uh can give us that
[1:28:13] praise the lord amen it's not
[1:28:16] it is not just for us to come in and
[1:28:18] entertain ourselves
[1:28:20] you know uh uh uh uh praise the lord
[1:28:23] dance to the music
[1:28:24] and then say something to make ourselves
[1:28:28] encourage ourselves but we also have to
[1:28:31] trust the lord that he will be able to
[1:28:34] help us to see our environment
[1:28:38] praise the lord amen
[1:28:41] so first samuel 15 verse
[1:28:45] 23 tells us here
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:53] samuel said in verse 22 then samuel said
[1:28:56] have the lord have the lord
[1:29:00] as great delight in burnt offering and
[1:29:03] sacrifice
[1:29:04] as in obeying the voice of the lord on
[1:29:08] the line death in obeying the voice of
[1:29:11] the lord
[1:29:12] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:29:16] and to ye king than the fats of ram
[1:29:20] for rebellion is as
[1:29:23] the scene of witchcraft
[1:29:27] so witchcraft is just rebellion it's the
[1:29:31] spirit of rebellion
[1:29:36] there is a higher level of rebellion and
[1:29:38] there is a lower level of rebellion
[1:29:41] but every form of rebellion is
[1:29:44] influenced
[1:29:46] by witchcraft
[1:29:50] for rebellion is the spirit
[1:29:56] is as the sin of witchcraft
[1:29:59] and stubbornness
[1:30:04] is as iniquity
[1:30:08] and idolatry
[1:30:12] praise the lord amen
[1:30:18] stubbornness
[1:30:20] is as iniquity
[1:30:24] and idolatry
[1:30:28] are we together
[1:30:33] so when you look at this and you just
[1:30:36] just keep it in the context of what
[1:30:39] samuel was dealing with here
[1:30:41] he said it's better to listen to the
[1:30:43] voice of god
[1:30:47] it's better to listen to the voice of
[1:30:49] god even if you don't understand it
[1:30:55] even if you don't agree with it
[1:30:58] because this one that is speaking is out
[1:31:01] of your
[1:31:02] time zone he knows the end from the
[1:31:03] beginning
[1:31:07] praise the lord he knows the end from
[1:31:09] the beginning
[1:31:12] so it's it's better to listen to his
[1:31:15] voice
[1:31:20] then to rebel
[1:31:26] it's two things is either we are
[1:31:28] rebelling
[1:31:30] or we are being stuck in our ways a
[1:31:33] sense of stubbornness
[1:31:38] we are either rebelling
[1:31:41] or we have been stuck in our ways
[1:31:45] are we together praise the lord
[1:31:49] now you have to bring this
[1:31:53] to context now that's a church you have
[1:31:55] to bring this to context what we're
[1:31:57] dealing with here is that
[1:31:59] we are dealing with an influence
[1:32:05] an influence that paul identified in the
[1:32:08] book
[1:32:09] of galatian and he said to the galilean
[1:32:11] church
[1:32:12] someone has bewitched you
[1:32:15] he said he said in in in a common sense
[1:32:18] to say
[1:32:19] there's a witchcraft spirit here
[1:32:23] you were progressing in the spirit
[1:32:27] you were claiming the promises of
[1:32:29] abraham you were identifying
[1:32:32] yourself as a seed of abraham
[1:32:35] but somebody is bringing you back to the
[1:32:37] flesh now
[1:32:38] read the book of galatians see the
[1:32:40] context there he says
[1:32:42] he even how tall he have to
[1:32:45] we're still repeated
[1:32:49] because he was sitting with with the
[1:32:51] gentiles
[1:32:52] when he saw all the a jewish christian
[1:32:55] coming he shook himself
[1:32:56] off so all of those things
[1:33:02] are the things that paul here being the
[1:33:04] prophet being a spiritual man
[1:33:06] is seeing a wrong influence
[1:33:12] he's seeing the wrong influence and even
[1:33:15] peter the one that the king was giving
[1:33:17] talk
[1:33:17] was caught under that influence so none
[1:33:20] of us here are exempted
[1:33:22] if we don't guard ourselves by the word
[1:33:25] even peter
[1:33:26] that the key was given to
[1:33:29] he was caught under there he shook a
[1:33:31] little bit
[1:33:38] are we together
[1:33:45] so what are we dealing with here obeying
[1:33:47] the voice of god
[1:33:50] that's our liberty
[1:33:53] praise the lord that's that's the way we
[1:33:56] go
[1:33:56] from glory to glory
[1:34:00] that's the way we go from from from uh
[1:34:04] from uh experience our nature change
[1:34:06] like paul says here
[1:34:08] he has delivered us from the present
[1:34:11] evil of this world
[1:34:13] the way to be delivered from the present
[1:34:15] evil and
[1:34:16] influence of this word is to obey the
[1:34:19] voice of god
[1:34:24] but there are two other spirits that are
[1:34:26] warring against us
[1:34:28] is to either rebel
[1:34:32] oh be stubborn
[1:34:37] praise the lord it looks the same
[1:34:40] because they are all
[1:34:41] accomplishing the same thing what are
[1:34:43] they accomplishing they are going
[1:34:44] against
[1:34:45] the word of god that's right
[1:34:48] amen brother branham said it this way he
[1:34:50] says
[1:34:51] sit on we either try to pull you back
[1:34:56] and if he cannot get you to pull back he
[1:34:58] push you over
[1:35:02] into fanaticism he don't try to pull you
[1:35:06] back into tradition
[1:35:09] and if he can't get you to to go back
[1:35:11] into tradition
[1:35:12] he puts you just a little further
[1:35:17] and you miss the mac because we must be
[1:35:20] right in the middle of the way
[1:35:27] are we together amen i mean it's
[1:35:30] it's a spirit that is sweeping over the
[1:35:32] land
[1:35:33] it's sweeping over the lane in a way
[1:35:36] that
[1:35:37] is is fighting against every
[1:35:40] every principle of truth
[1:35:45] every principle of truth you find even
[1:35:48] in the ring of the nominal christians
[1:35:51] people are just becoming
[1:35:53] i mean they're just becoming careless
[1:35:54] it's almost it almost
[1:35:56] like uh uh you know it's i mean church
[1:35:59] is just
[1:36:00] it's just like a farm
[1:36:03] now you come you come in the ring of the
[1:36:06] holiness people
[1:36:07] you come in the ring of the people that
[1:36:09] have experienced the supernatural of god
[1:36:12] it almost looks like we're beginning to
[1:36:15] question those things
[1:36:23] are we together
[1:36:29] so bear with me a little bit
[1:36:34] just bear with me now praise the lord
[1:36:39] what i want us to do this morning
[1:36:42] i want for us to yield to the holy
[1:36:44] spirit
[1:36:46] i don't want you to yield to fear
[1:36:49] because because i want to rebuild fear
[1:36:53] amen i want to rebuild fear so i want
[1:36:56] you to yield to the holy spirit
[1:36:59] just just keep praising god and just
[1:37:01] keep thanking god
[1:37:03] and don't don't don't don't yield into
[1:37:05] fear this morning
[1:37:06] even if the holy spirit call out
[1:37:08] anything in your life just say thank you
[1:37:10] jesus
[1:37:11] because the only reason why god will
[1:37:13] call out something in your life is
[1:37:14] because he ready to deal with that thing
[1:37:17] and he want to make you a partner
[1:37:19] [Music]
[1:37:23] amen thank you lord thank you praise the
[1:37:26] lord
[1:37:28] amen witchcraft is an attempt to control
[1:37:32] a person
[1:37:34] to make them to do what
[1:37:39] you want them to do
[1:37:44] by another spirit then the holy spirit
[1:37:50] that's why paul says another gospel he
[1:37:53] said actually it is not another gospel
[1:37:56] because there is only one
[1:37:57] gospel only one gospel there is no two
[1:38:02] because the gospel is the demonstration
[1:38:07] of jesus christ is the raising christ
[1:38:11] back on the scene that's the gospel
[1:38:15] you cannot have two
[1:38:20] are we together amen so that's why
[1:38:23] paul was identifying he says he's saying
[1:38:26] that there's
[1:38:27] there is another spirit that is that is
[1:38:29] leading you
[1:38:30] away from this
[1:38:36] are we together
[1:38:39] because you see what was happening there
[1:38:42] there was
[1:38:42] there was a strong pressing of judaism
[1:38:46] that came with the early church
[1:38:50] and and and and uh the the tendency
[1:38:54] of trying to make everybody a jews was
[1:38:56] there
[1:38:58] that is the reason why this gospel is
[1:39:01] not an american gospel
[1:39:03] it's not an african gospel this is a
[1:39:05] gospel right from the throne of god
[1:39:07] and god has sent his spirit to back up
[1:39:10] every word
[1:39:15] you cannot make this gospel a cultural
[1:39:17] thing
[1:39:20] it's not a cultural thing it goes beyond
[1:39:23] cultural boundaries
[1:39:24] for the model of fire it's cultural
[1:39:27] boundary
[1:39:27] it brings us the divine nature
[1:39:31] of god himself
[1:39:39] that's why sometimes you know i i i
[1:39:41] frowned with
[1:39:42] with some of my good friends he says
[1:39:44] well in africa
[1:39:45] we this is not an african gospel this is
[1:39:48] a heavenly gospel
[1:39:58] because jesus christ is the same
[1:39:59] yesterday today and forever
[1:40:02] so it's an attempt to control a person
[1:40:05] it's an influence it's a spirit
[1:40:07] that control now remember now is is is a
[1:40:10] rebellious spirit
[1:40:11] so the first time that that lucifer
[1:40:14] rebelled against
[1:40:15] god what was he doing he was
[1:40:19] attempting to to control
[1:40:22] all the angels
[1:40:27] and he was able to have influence over
[1:40:29] two-thirds of the angels
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:34] and he was taking them from the
[1:40:36] leadership
[1:40:37] of almighty god to put them
[1:40:40] under his own leadership
[1:40:44] where he will lead by fear
[1:40:48] intimidation we will see that as we as
[1:40:51] we look at this together
[1:40:55] are we together amen
[1:40:58] are you are you yelling to the holy
[1:41:00] spirit
[1:41:02] amen
[1:41:09] so control a person to make them to do
[1:41:13] what you want them to do by another
[1:41:16] spirit than the holy spirit
[1:41:20] praise the lord let's look at ezekiel
[1:41:22] chapter 13.
[1:41:25] i read some things to you here from the
[1:41:27] prophet in a little bit
[1:41:28] let's just let's just get some biblical
[1:41:31] foundation here
[1:41:34] and by the way itself i will project her
[1:41:37] this
[1:41:39] he got on a burning offering
[1:41:50] amen praise the lord
[1:41:53] first it was the sound ball now is the
[1:41:58] projector
[1:42:00] at least we are keeping all the laws
[1:42:04] both both on you ezekiel chapter 13
[1:42:08] let's look in verse 18.
[1:42:14] if the lord help us and we and we just
[1:42:16] and we just
[1:42:17] yield to the holy spirit we appreciate
[1:42:19] this
[1:42:20] if you fall into the channel of fear you
[1:42:23] you will just think that
[1:42:25] uh uh i'm coming against you and coming
[1:42:28] again somebody know
[1:42:29] i'm i'm coming against the spirit
[1:42:34] you know the three pools of brother
[1:42:36] branham let me go back a little bit
[1:42:38] the first pool was healing the healing
[1:42:42] pool
[1:42:43] you know we talked about the second pull
[1:42:46] but
[1:42:46] not many of us have been really able to
[1:42:49] put brother
[1:42:50] branham's second pulled into perspective
[1:42:53] under the first poll that was where we
[1:42:56] got
[1:42:56] that picture with the pillow of fire
[1:43:00] this was something i was developing to
[1:43:02] speak on the three supernatural pictures
[1:43:05] under the under the first pool that was
[1:43:07] where we got that picture with a pillow
[1:43:09] of fire and what was happening was that
[1:43:11] uh
[1:43:12] he was there there with brother ff
[1:43:14] boswell trying to uh uh i mean
[1:43:16] f bustle was the uh defending divine
[1:43:19] healing
[1:43:20] and uh uh
[1:43:24] and that and dr bess was uh you know was
[1:43:27] not going to take
[1:43:28] you know we're going to take years for
[1:43:31] an answer
[1:43:32] and then uh he already staged his
[1:43:35] photographer because he planned that he
[1:43:37] was going to disgrace
[1:43:39] this divine healer or this guy preaching
[1:43:41] divine healing
[1:43:42] we know the story about it brother
[1:43:44] bosworth carver branham out
[1:43:46] he came dead and and the photographer
[1:43:48] got to where he
[1:43:50] started taking pictures amen praise the
[1:43:53] lord
[1:43:54] just like brother lloyd taking pictures
[1:43:57] but we know that his pictures will come
[1:43:59] out clean i mean
[1:44:05] and you know the thing the thing about
[1:44:07] it there is that uh
[1:44:09] i never thought about this but uh
[1:44:15] brother branham then never even knew
[1:44:17] that
[1:44:19] the pillow of fire was going to be there
[1:44:22] ff boswell never knew
[1:44:23] nobody knew it was only god almighty
[1:44:26] amen that choose to identify
[1:44:29] himself with these men that was standing
[1:44:32] up
[1:44:33] for truth are we together
[1:44:36] praise the lord and the picture and uh
[1:44:40] and the photographer was able to pick up
[1:44:43] uh the supernatural hand of the lord
[1:44:46] one night brother brother ben sent me
[1:44:50] uh uh uh uh a picture that he
[1:44:54] he caught up on the camera here and i
[1:44:56] won our camera
[1:44:57] i don't know before we he said before we
[1:45:00] renovated this place or just at the time
[1:45:02] we did it or something like that
[1:45:04] and and it's an amazing picture
[1:45:07] it's a very amazing picture and
[1:45:11] it was in the night i don't know what it
[1:45:12] was but i just think that it was amazing
[1:45:15] let me go back to what i'm saying here
[1:45:16] praise the lord so then
[1:45:18] uh on the the the the second poll
[1:45:22] what actually that second pool was you
[1:45:25] have to remember
[1:45:27] that uh uh
[1:45:30] uh brother branham had uh he moved into
[1:45:33] a level of ministry where he was
[1:45:35] discerning
[1:45:36] the hearts of the people now the
[1:45:38] discerning of the house of the people
[1:45:41] most people took it for entertainment
[1:45:43] most people
[1:45:44] waited they watched to see him calling
[1:45:47] people out
[1:45:48] people names and telling their address
[1:45:51] you know and all of that
[1:45:52] but that ministry
[1:45:56] was a ministry to
[1:46:00] rebuild spirits
[1:46:06] that the church is serious that we are
[1:46:08] playing for sunday school brother
[1:46:10] branham said have you ever watched
[1:46:13] when i call people in those prayer lines
[1:46:16] have you ever seen their faces
[1:46:17] he said it's not the people it's the
[1:46:20] spirit
[1:46:21] because that spirit realized that it's
[1:46:23] about to be a spouse
[1:46:32] praise the lord because for the world to
[1:46:36] come the word which is christ
[1:46:39] to come and endure the people
[1:46:42] god must deliver us
[1:46:46] he must deliver us from every complex he
[1:46:49] must deliver us
[1:46:50] from every every spirit that is now of
[1:46:53] his
[1:46:54] so the tear pull is the opening of the
[1:46:57] word the coming of the word the coming
[1:46:59] of christ
[1:47:00] whichever terminology we give it so
[1:47:02] before the world will come and work
[1:47:05] there was a ministry that came and
[1:47:08] rebuilt spirits
[1:47:14] so you see the the the victory the
[1:47:17] success of the meeting
[1:47:18] was for brother branham to to have
[1:47:22] the privilege to discern few people in a
[1:47:25] meeting
[1:47:25] you are this and this is what wrong the
[1:47:27] devil is supposed here
[1:47:29] you are this and this is what wrong as
[1:47:31] he does that
[1:47:32] he raised the feet of the people of sit
[1:47:35] on ss post
[1:47:36] healing flaws and you hear the people
[1:47:40] shouting in the crowd because
[1:47:41] the devil is exposed the faith of the
[1:47:44] people now has come up
[1:47:59] so the second poll was the rebuilding of
[1:48:02] spirits
[1:48:05] and then the tear pool was the opening
[1:48:07] of the word
[1:48:09] which is the coming of christ amen
[1:48:12] the coming of christ to the believer yes
[1:48:16] because now we are free now we've been
[1:48:19] delivered
[1:48:21] are we together so under the second poll
[1:48:25] then we realized that that the eye of
[1:48:27] the camera
[1:48:28] also pick up a deaf spirit over a woman
[1:48:34] so under every pool god
[1:48:38] allows signs to have an evidence
[1:48:45] signs have an evidence under the first
[1:48:47] pool
[1:48:48] it was the pillar of fire the second
[1:48:50] pulled it was that death spirit
[1:48:52] the out of the camera caught it
[1:49:01] and the tear pole was the pictures in
[1:49:05] arizona
[1:49:07] the eye of the camera also caught that
[1:49:10] the opening of the world
[1:49:13] where was i right here
[1:49:18] on 69 humble
[1:49:22] praise the lord
[1:49:25] now so we hear in ezekiel chapter 13
[1:49:28] let's read from verse 18 a little bit
[1:49:30] here
[1:49:41] verse uh ezekiel chapter 18
[1:49:44] verse 17 let's let's look back here
[1:49:47] likewise
[1:49:48] thou son of man set the face against the
[1:49:51] daughter of thy people
[1:49:53] and pro and prophets are out of
[1:49:57] their own hearts and
[1:50:00] and and prophets are doubt against him
[1:50:03] praise the lord amen
[1:50:08] set that face against the daughter of
[1:50:10] their people which prophesy
[1:50:12] out of their own heart and prophets are
[1:50:16] down against him
[1:50:17] and and said thou said the lord god
[1:50:20] war told the women they are said
[1:50:24] pillows am i right here let me
[1:50:27] get my things together okay yeah uh
[1:50:31] pillows of all armholes and make knives
[1:50:35] upon the head of every stature
[1:50:39] to haunt souls
[1:50:42] will you hunt the souls of my people
[1:50:48] and will ye save their souls alive
[1:50:52] that cometh unto you now so what was
[1:50:55] happening here was a form of witchcraft
[1:50:57] that was being practiced
[1:50:59] among the the people of israel because
[1:51:01] they pick up all of those things from
[1:51:02] the babylonian you have to know that
[1:51:04] ezekiel is one of the prophets doing the
[1:51:06] captivity of babylon
[1:51:08] so years that now they are practicing
[1:51:11] witchcraft but what the scripture is
[1:51:13] pointing
[1:51:14] out here is that wiscrat
[1:51:17] haunt the source of people
[1:51:24] praise the lord why why will that be
[1:51:29] why will that be because we understand
[1:51:32] from the word of god
[1:51:34] that man shall not live by bread alone
[1:51:37] but by every word that proceeds from the
[1:51:39] mouth of god
[1:51:40] the only thing that the soul of man can
[1:51:42] feed on
[1:51:44] is the word of god
[1:51:48] so you see the devil has set up a medium
[1:51:51] also to attack the soul
[1:51:54] to haunt the soul
[1:52:00] are we together praise the lord
[1:52:05] and you see all of the things that we we
[1:52:08] talk about we believe we pray
[1:52:10] god send the holy spirit i want the word
[1:52:12] to be made flesh and mean
[1:52:14] if that were just only still in your
[1:52:16] mind i don't care how much you enjoy it
[1:52:19] how much you appreciate it if you just
[1:52:21] stay around your spirit ring
[1:52:23] it will carry you for a season
[1:52:29] and then after a while the very same
[1:52:31] word that you rejoice in
[1:52:33] that you are grateful for you will start
[1:52:35] warring against it
[1:52:40] if that's if that word does not take
[1:52:43] resident in your soul
[1:52:49] but i try to bring this out so you will
[1:52:51] see
[1:52:52] that uh
[1:52:55] that influence that
[1:52:58] demonic power like bran said in
[1:53:00] demonology listening to that yesterday
[1:53:03] he says he says what are demons tomatoes
[1:53:08] he says demons are tomatoes and then he
[1:53:11] spoke about it
[1:53:13] in three reams in the physical ring we
[1:53:16] will look at that
[1:53:17] in a spiritual ring and he then he also
[1:53:20] talks about it
[1:53:21] in a religious ring that is called
[1:53:24] enticing spirit
[1:53:28] praise the lord that's where you find
[1:53:31] bunch of religious spirit
[1:53:37] are we together now remember now i told
[1:53:40] you
[1:53:41] less yield to the holy spirit amen
[1:53:44] praise the lord let's say praise the
[1:53:46] lord
[1:53:48] praise the lord we want to absorb jesus
[1:53:50] i'm not exalting the devil
[1:53:52] i'm not making him powerful i'm exposing
[1:53:55] him
[1:53:56] but as we expose the devil we must
[1:53:58] absorb the lord jesus
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:06] praise the lord so you see like first
[1:54:09] samuel tells
[1:54:10] us man by his
[1:54:13] fallen nature he's a rebel
[1:54:20] man by his fallen nature rebels
[1:54:24] praise the lord thank you jesus
[1:54:29] glory be to god man by his fallen nature
[1:54:34] when man fell in the garden of eden
[1:54:40] he took on a rebellion nature
[1:54:45] and he rebelled against god he left the
[1:54:47] world for the man to rebel he has to
[1:54:50] leave the principle of god's word
[1:54:52] and then he starts to rebel so
[1:54:55] man is a rebel by nature
[1:55:00] from the fall are we together
[1:55:07] he's a rebel by nature
[1:55:10] right from the fall
[1:55:15] so we see all of these things now
[1:55:19] as paul this weekdays let's look in
[1:55:22] galatians chapter 5.
[1:55:33] you know i was as as i was meditating
[1:55:36] this morning
[1:55:37] and uh uh
[1:55:42] i was actually trying to look for
[1:55:44] something else to to to
[1:55:46] go into you know most of the time in
[1:55:48] time past
[1:55:49] and even now when i'm kind of talking on
[1:55:52] this subject
[1:55:53] i like to i really like to spend some
[1:55:55] good time with the lord
[1:55:57] in fasting and praying because i mean
[1:56:01] the whole the whole region of hell
[1:56:04] is on fire as i'm talking to you the
[1:56:07] devil don't like this kind of a
[1:56:09] preaching
[1:56:10] he don't like nobody showing lie down in
[1:56:13] his hold
[1:56:14] he don't like it praise the lord amen
[1:56:18] i mean he's asking that demon i told you
[1:56:21] give that guy a headache this morning
[1:56:22] why is he shouting
[1:56:27] because i just as i came into the office
[1:56:28] i started to fee a headache i said what
[1:56:31] is this
[1:56:32] but i knew i was infrared amen
[1:56:37] he don't like nobody showing light down
[1:56:39] his holes
[1:56:40] he don't like it at all praise the lord
[1:56:42] but we're going to glorify god amen
[1:56:45] can we say thank you jesus thank you
[1:56:48] jesus
[1:56:48] amen paul says in galatians 5 let's read
[1:56:52] together
[1:56:52] now he talks yet about the work of the
[1:56:55] flesh
[1:56:56] galatians chapter 5 let's look at verse
[1:56:58] 19.
[1:57:01] you you'll get to understand a little
[1:57:03] bit here he says now the work of the
[1:57:05] flesh
[1:57:06] are manifested which are these adultery
[1:57:11] fornication uncleanness lots of
[1:57:13] viciousness
[1:57:14] this is uh
[1:57:17] adultery idolatry witchcraft
[1:57:22] history then he goes on
[1:57:26] yeah now the very same thing that he
[1:57:29] he saw in the spirit ring that he
[1:57:32] identified
[1:57:34] an influence that is bothering the
[1:57:37] church
[1:57:38] he's bringing here to identify it as a
[1:57:41] work
[1:57:42] of the flesh so that will also
[1:57:46] help you to understand demonology
[1:57:49] in the physical realm
[1:57:54] praise the lord because this is a
[1:57:57] physical rhythm
[1:57:58] it's a work of the flesh
[1:58:02] there are people that are in a spiritual
[1:58:04] realm of it
[1:58:06] and there is also a religious reign of
[1:58:09] witchcraft i will show you it through
[1:58:11] the word
[1:58:12] [Music]
[1:58:14] lord be to god amen
[1:58:18] are we together are you afraid
[1:58:24] and my son is uh spooky
[1:58:30] glory be to god amen
[1:58:35] you know as a church
[1:58:39] brother branham said in the in the
[1:58:40] church book he says
[1:58:43] when when the church received the holy
[1:58:45] ghost he said when peter came out and
[1:58:47] preached
[1:58:48] and three thousands gave their life to
[1:58:51] the lord
[1:58:52] he says in the midst of that three
[1:58:54] thousands
[1:58:55] there were mismultitude now the bible
[1:59:00] now came up with a phrase that says
[1:59:03] setting men creeped in on the way
[1:59:08] it came from that uh uh uh
[1:59:12] uh multitude that god saved
[1:59:16] he puts it back to matthew chapter 13
[1:59:20] in jesus parable he says
[1:59:23] that fulfill the living
[1:59:27] the woman that had the dog and she added
[1:59:30] living to it
[1:59:32] in in in in matthew chapter 13
[1:59:36] because because uh the the the the
[1:59:38] living is a yeast
[1:59:40] you know in in the in in the lost supper
[1:59:44] in in the bread in the tabernacle no no
[1:59:46] living was added
[1:59:48] so brother branham says it was a type of
[1:59:50] the church
[1:59:52] and we see that being fulfilled when the
[1:59:55] church was born in acts chapter 2
[1:59:57] with a miss multitude coming in
[2:00:03] praise the lord then the bible talks
[2:00:05] about the
[2:00:06] simon the sorceress that came and wanted
[2:00:10] and and became part of the church
[2:00:14] this is all right there in the early
[2:00:16] church
[2:00:20] and all of these things has been hanging
[2:00:22] around the message of the hour
[2:00:24] i mean i was sitting right there
[2:00:25] studying this morning
[2:00:27] and the holy spirit just ministered some
[2:00:30] things to my heart
[2:00:31] how how uh uh all of these
[2:00:35] you know uh uh uh uh uh in a sense we're
[2:00:38] talking about witchcraft
[2:00:39] and familiar spirits how they are
[2:00:42] attracted to the supernatural
[2:00:46] those mediums who see brother brandon
[2:00:48] says you have a sign
[2:00:49] over you
[2:00:54] they are attracted to the supernatural
[2:00:56] but you see
[2:00:57] the thing about it there is that uh uh
[2:01:01] uh they are not attracted because they
[2:01:03] want to be
[2:01:04] changed they are attracted because they
[2:01:07] want to use it to control
[2:01:15] follow me a little bit
[2:01:19] praise the lord amen
[2:01:27] so we see here paul now bringing that
[2:01:31] manifestation which of course he
[2:01:33] identified here
[2:01:35] he says the work of the flesh are
[2:01:37] manifested there's a manifestation we
[2:01:39] see a manifestation
[2:01:42] that is in it praise the lord
[2:01:45] amen we see a manifestation
[2:01:49] that is in it so he says here
[2:01:52] you know call all of these things i
[2:01:54] adulterate fornication
[2:01:56] on cleanness and all of these things but
[2:01:58] yet he brings our subject
[2:02:00] right into death
[2:02:03] and this manifestation
[2:02:06] is a demon power that seeks to control
[2:02:10] the flesh
[2:02:12] by
[2:02:16] uh manipulation intimidation
[2:02:21] and domination
[2:02:27] a cease to control the flesh
[2:02:30] by manipulation intimidation
[2:02:35] and domination you have to realize
[2:02:38] that god do not manipulate
[2:02:42] he says my sheep
[2:02:45] hears my voice praise the lord
[2:02:49] amen what
[2:02:52] and what it takes for you to believe god
[2:02:54] put it in you
[2:02:57] he don't have to manipulate you god
[2:03:00] don't intimidate
[2:03:02] god don't dominate what the spirit of
[2:03:05] god are calling to
[2:03:06] sin john was told he leaves
[2:03:11] the spirit leads
[2:03:14] amen and the ones that are attracted to
[2:03:17] it
[2:03:18] follow
[2:03:20] [Music]
[2:03:26] praise the lord
[2:03:38] it seeks to control the flesh
[2:03:44] by intimidation
[2:03:48] praise the lord and and the the thing
[2:03:51] the thing that brings me to this is like
[2:03:54] brother branham said how the people sits
[2:03:57] right in the pill
[2:04:02] and they are and they are and they are
[2:04:03] oppressed they are attacked by the
[2:04:06] spirit but it sits right there
[2:04:09] praise the lord and they never reach out
[2:04:12] to take god's word
[2:04:14] to realize and identify that this thing
[2:04:17] is going to destroy my life
[2:04:23] this is right there
[2:04:32] and time after time spirit i mean
[2:04:34] service after
[2:04:36] service
[2:04:43] they realize that
[2:04:46] praise the lord
[2:04:52] that's the thing that is that is
[2:04:54] happening
[2:04:57] in the in the spiritual world
[2:05:00] i mean the influence that is on the last
[2:05:03] day's church
[2:05:09] galatians we'll have bewish you
[2:05:12] will have bewitched you praise the lord
[2:05:16] one time we talk about the supernatural
[2:05:19] we talk about the angel of the lord we
[2:05:21] talk about what god has done in our day
[2:05:25] now the people are so bewitched
[2:05:29] and that that influence is just
[2:05:31] spreading out
[2:05:32] that when you start to talk about the
[2:05:34] angels of the lord or you start to talk
[2:05:36] about
[2:05:37] what god have done in our day question
[2:05:40] starts to come to our mind
[2:05:43] do we verify that
[2:05:46] praise the lord
[2:05:49] who went over to jerusalem and and and
[2:05:52] went there and met
[2:05:53] the prisoners and asked them all the the
[2:05:56] soldier guide and says
[2:05:57] did peter walk out of this prison
[2:06:03] praise the lord
[2:06:07] peter came out he showed over to john
[2:06:10] mark house
[2:06:10] and and and the disciples saw that uh oh
[2:06:14] no it's peter oh no it's a spirit
[2:06:15] because he was supposed to be killed
[2:06:18] and and they went back and forth peter
[2:06:20] said no i'm the one look at me i'm the
[2:06:21] one
[2:06:22] i mean i was sitting in prison and the
[2:06:24] angel of the lord came down
[2:06:26] and he opened the prison and we walked
[2:06:28] out
[2:06:29] and the church says amen
[2:06:35] praise the lord
[2:06:39] let's write back to jerusalem and verify
[2:06:41] peter testimony if it is right
[2:06:48] you see when all of those things start
[2:06:50] starts creeping in the church
[2:06:53] what is the purpose of it to weaken
[2:06:55] faith
[2:06:56] to make god a historical god
[2:07:05] when he's a present tense god
[2:07:13] praise the lord and god
[2:07:16] don't want these things to be among us
[2:07:19] he don't want us
[2:07:21] to be caught up into this
[2:07:24] what we have to manipulate to have our
[2:07:26] will
[2:07:29] praise the lord amen
[2:07:33] now no offense but you will see that
[2:07:36] many times it's even with young kids
[2:07:40] they're so innocent
[2:07:44] but they fall into that channel where
[2:07:46] they think that they can manipulate
[2:07:48] their parents
[2:07:51] they are just so innocent but it's a
[2:07:54] work of the flesh
[2:08:04] but bring it bring it over to family
[2:08:06] life
[2:08:08] and you bring it over to church life
[2:08:13] the man being the head of the home is
[2:08:15] never asked to dominate his wife
[2:08:18] the bible says a man will love his wife
[2:08:21] like christ
[2:08:22] love the church
[2:08:27] we don't lead by intimidation
[2:08:34] praise the lord
[2:08:39] and sometimes you see it
[2:08:44] in uh in in ministries like brother
[2:08:47] branham says they gather people
[2:08:49] to the place where the people become so
[2:08:51] afraid if you don't come here you are
[2:08:53] dumb
[2:08:54] your name is blotted out of the book of
[2:09:02] life
[2:09:04] are you seeing what i'm going with this
[2:09:07] it's an influence
[2:09:10] and what it does is that it takes the
[2:09:13] individual
[2:09:14] from under the leadership of the holy
[2:09:16] spirit
[2:09:21] because for the man now to judge himself
[2:09:24] being led by the spirit he has to see
[2:09:28] whether brother warren agrees with it
[2:09:35] praise the lord
[2:09:40] and sometimes out of out of protection
[2:09:46] parents unconsciously
[2:09:51] go into that rule sometimes
[2:09:55] you have to realize that we are stills
[2:10:01] we are stealers we are now owners of
[2:10:03] god's
[2:10:04] inheritance
[2:10:08] our duty is to bring the people of god
[2:10:12] to the place where god will
[2:10:14] deal with them god will deal with them
[2:10:18] god will deal with every
[2:10:27] yes heart
[2:10:30] because we are all coming to what the
[2:10:33] preeminence
[2:10:35] of jesus christ the preeminence
[2:10:39] where christ is having the first place
[2:10:43] an intimate place intimate place
[2:10:47] intimate relationship with all of his
[2:10:50] children
[2:10:54] they're preeminent the moment you put
[2:10:58] any of this work of the flesh in the
[2:11:01] mess
[2:11:03] you grieve the holy spirit
[2:11:07] that's why paul was bringing to this
[2:11:10] galilean church
[2:11:12] you are you are you are returning back
[2:11:14] to the flesh
[2:11:15] you are getting back to fleshly things
[2:11:18] you are looking
[2:11:18] for your entertainment in fleshly things
[2:11:24] when god has blessed you
[2:11:27] with the promises
[2:11:31] he has blessed you with spiritual
[2:11:33] inheritance
[2:11:34] you are pulling back to fleshly things
[2:11:40] are we together
[2:11:50] we have to wash them
[2:11:55] we have to wash that
[2:12:00] since
[2:12:04] last week we were i went for my
[2:12:07] nephew uh uh
[2:12:11] in his father's memorial
[2:12:14] and uh and and by the way on our way
[2:12:17] back we kind of
[2:12:18] lost my nephew he was dealing with
[2:12:22] he was on dialysis and it looks like his
[2:12:25] body went into a shock
[2:12:27] so he passed on on the way back
[2:12:32] but uh after then i stopped over and
[2:12:35] visited with the brothers there
[2:12:36] and uh uh you know all of these things
[2:12:40] i've you know i've been praying
[2:12:42] and i was i was just i was just seeing
[2:12:45] you know some of the things that were
[2:12:47] just that was just
[2:12:48] on my mind you know and i was saying wow
[2:12:53] how is so easy how is so easy i mean
[2:12:57] we've been we've been preaching about
[2:12:59] the holy spirit we've been preaching
[2:13:01] about a tearful
[2:13:02] a manifestation a demonstration of the
[2:13:04] holy ghost a man can come out and just
[2:13:06] bring
[2:13:07] one evil preaching it can just spread
[2:13:09] among the people like wildfire
[2:13:11] and all all the labels i wish that the
[2:13:14] holy ghost would just pray people would
[2:13:16] just yell
[2:13:16] out for it like that
[2:13:24] but it shows the kind of a body that we
[2:13:26] are in the body that is not
[2:13:28] redeemed yet
[2:13:36] praise the lord our redeemed body our
[2:13:39] glorified body
[2:13:40] will will spring out for the reality of
[2:13:43] god
[2:13:44] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye in
[2:13:46] a bop of an eye
[2:13:50] but in his body we struggle
[2:13:54] it's so easy to get attached to
[2:13:58] lies deception
[2:14:02] a struggle to accept truth
[2:14:08] are we together the holy spirit is
[2:14:12] promised
[2:14:14] to lead us we are sheep of his pasture
[2:14:19] we are sheep of his pasture
[2:14:23] sons and daughters of god children of
[2:14:25] god that is the thing
[2:14:27] that you must look for love for god
[2:14:30] dealing with your heart
[2:14:31] look for god leading you in the pages
[2:14:34] of his word
[2:14:40] and what it used to be so common in the
[2:14:43] in in the days of the revival and the
[2:14:45] outpouring of the spirit of god
[2:14:47] it was not shame for people to just say
[2:14:48] the lord led me
[2:14:50] now this is it's just it's you you have
[2:14:53] to double take it before you say it
[2:14:56] because you're not even sure whether
[2:14:57] he's the lord on that
[2:15:02] the lord led me the lord placed upon my
[2:15:06] heart
[2:15:13] the holy spirit is to lead not to
[2:15:18] not to drive
[2:15:22] he's to lead and what he does is that he
[2:15:26] shows the path
[2:15:28] and expect you to step in and follow
[2:15:36] he told noah my spirit will no longer
[2:15:38] strife with man
[2:15:45] praise the lord
[2:15:48] it's a coveted where he leads
[2:15:51] and we follow
[2:15:55] amen if god
[2:15:58] is dealing with your heart and god is
[2:16:00] speaking to you
[2:16:01] uh uh and he's revealing himself to you
[2:16:04] and
[2:16:04] uh and and he says well uh you know uh
[2:16:08] god i mean god is it's powerful law you
[2:16:11] are powerful calm down and take this
[2:16:13] thing from my life no
[2:16:14] all he wants you is to just step in line
[2:16:16] with the word as we walk
[2:16:18] in the light as he is in the light
[2:16:21] then those things fall off
[2:16:25] they fall off god is not coming to
[2:16:26] strive with you leave it leave it
[2:16:28] leave it get this thing out of your life
[2:16:30] nope
[2:16:31] nope because this is a bright age
[2:16:35] this is the age where the shepherd
[2:16:37] speaks and the sheep must hear
[2:16:39] and follow he's not coming to wrestle
[2:16:42] with you
[2:16:50] as we walk in the light
[2:16:54] as he is in the light
[2:16:57] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[2:17:01] as we walk now as we are standing and
[2:17:03] arguing
[2:17:06] as we walk
[2:17:13] yeah that's that is the places where
[2:17:15] many people get to where he says oh i
[2:17:17] prayed i prayed i prayed i fasted
[2:17:19] i asked god to deliver me all god was
[2:17:21] expecting you to do is to just walk
[2:17:26] it should just identify what the word of
[2:17:29] god says
[2:17:29] and walk in that
[2:17:45] are we together praise the lord
[2:17:49] can we say thank you jesus let's just
[2:17:52] absorb the name of jesus christ
[2:17:54] he's walter to be praised amen
[2:17:58] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:18:00] hallelujah
[2:18:01] at the end of the service the name of
[2:18:03] the lord will be glorified
[2:18:05] amen the name of the lord will be
[2:18:08] magnified
[2:18:09] praise the lord he is our rock
[2:18:13] he is our defender he's the one that is
[2:18:16] strong and mighty in battle
[2:18:19] praise the lord amen
[2:18:23] glory be to god hallelujah
[2:18:27] you see all of these things happening
[2:18:36] amen
[2:18:47] as i said speaking
[2:18:50] on behalf of our lord come and let us
[2:18:52] reason together
[2:18:56] god says come and let us reason together
[2:18:59] it shows that the holy spirit do not
[2:19:02] have no complex
[2:19:06] because remember he's always right
[2:19:10] he's always right and even though he
[2:19:13] knows that you are wrong
[2:19:15] he's not building no complex come let's
[2:19:18] reason together
[2:19:20] come and convince me
[2:19:26] come here convince me let's talk let's
[2:19:28] let's reason together
[2:19:32] because the scripture says in the
[2:19:33] multitudes of of of counsel
[2:19:36] uh uh uh uh in the multitudes of words
[2:19:38] there's counsel
[2:19:39] solomon says something like that amen so
[2:19:42] when everybody is wrong and you are
[2:19:44] right
[2:19:46] even when people are wrong brother
[2:19:49] branham says
[2:19:51] uh uh statue of the peppermint
[2:19:55] he said brotherly kindness you learn to
[2:19:58] bed
[2:19:59] with the ones that weak
[2:20:03] even if they don't see it the way you
[2:20:05] see it
[2:20:07] you learn to bear with them
[2:20:12] praise the lord because why if you don't
[2:20:15] do that
[2:20:16] it's so easy for you to go into a
[2:20:18] complex
[2:20:19] and you start imposing yourself on them
[2:20:26] then how you want the holy spirit to
[2:20:27] deal with them when you just have them
[2:20:29] all wrap up
[2:20:30] in your hands and your wills and your
[2:20:32] thoughts
[2:20:37] come let us reason together
[2:20:42] praise the lord amen
[2:20:46] i have to find a place here to stop so
[2:20:49] we can get to the next part of the
[2:20:50] service
[2:20:51] and uh do the things that we're supposed
[2:20:55] to do
[2:20:55] praise the lord
[2:20:58] but i think you are seeing what i'm
[2:21:00] getting into
[2:21:03] people this home going time and in as
[2:21:06] much as
[2:21:07] as is home going time there's there's
[2:21:09] there's uh
[2:21:10] there's a lot of influence that is
[2:21:13] another hand trying to point us
[2:21:14] another way a lot of things creating
[2:21:17] destruction
[2:21:20] water on the water on the internet
[2:21:22] whether in the lives of the people
[2:21:24] around us
[2:21:28] creating destruction
[2:21:31] to take us from our position now if you
[2:21:34] read
[2:21:35] on this vision of the of of the of the
[2:21:37] of the preview

[2:23:10] this whole kovic thing praise the lord
[2:23:15] it just kind of a broad almost
[2:23:18] like a a black sheet
[2:23:21] before the people
[2:23:26] and you can see one of the
[2:23:29] influence that is behind us
[2:23:33] is to come against the church
[2:23:38] the people don't they don't have
[2:23:39] problems going to work and going to
[2:23:41] other
[2:23:42] social gatherings and games but the
[2:23:45] pressure is on church
[2:23:49] that's all when you when you sink you
[2:23:50] spread the coffee
[2:23:54] when you do this you spread the coffee
[2:23:56] and and all of that too
[2:23:57] even even on the nominal church and even
[2:24:01] around the message cycle
[2:24:02] it has weakened people faith
[2:24:07] they can they can they can stay home
[2:24:09] they can go to work they can go
[2:24:11] into the mall but no to the church we
[2:24:14] got to be careful
[2:24:17] so you see the spirit it's it's not the
[2:24:20] people
[2:24:21] it's a spirit
[2:24:25] that they have not identified trying to
[2:24:28] rob them
[2:24:33] to take them into lukewarmness
[2:24:38] and pretty soon they start they start
[2:24:40] losing their their experience
[2:24:42] they start losing the beauty of jesus
[2:24:44] christ and
[2:24:46] and before they realize they don't even
[2:24:47] know how to start looking like the world
[2:24:49] and start putting on things like the
[2:24:51] word
[2:24:52] it's because there is a spirit
[2:25:04] are we together
[2:25:14] and i just taught you know to stand
[2:25:18] as a brother and your friend to to just
[2:25:21] to just elect you we we we have to watch
[2:25:24] out for these things
[2:25:28] we have to watch out for these things
[2:25:31] you know because they are there we can
[2:25:34] we can just
[2:25:35] we can just go and and look at these
[2:25:38] things let's look in job chapter three
[2:25:40] let me just run quickly these are some
[2:25:42] of the things that when i stop
[2:25:44] then i'm about to start a three-month
[2:25:47] series
[2:25:50] job chapter 3 job cried out
[2:25:54] as he prayed here and
[2:25:59] he says let them curse ate that curse
[2:26:03] that they who are ready to arise
[2:26:07] up their morning
[2:26:11] now if you look at this even
[2:26:14] even the uh in the revised version and
[2:26:18] and amplify it you will see here that
[2:26:22] with with all of the things that was
[2:26:24] happening happening to job
[2:26:26] this brought him to the place where he
[2:26:28] thought for once
[2:26:30] that maybe somebody was casting evil
[2:26:33] spell on him
[2:26:38] maybe somebody was casting evil spell
[2:26:42] because that is
[2:26:46] the spiritual realm
[2:26:53] demonic spiritual power that operates by
[2:26:57] spared
[2:26:57] and curses
[2:27:03] praise the lord
[2:27:06] now if you look also in uh first
[2:27:09] chronicle chapter 10
[2:27:11] you will see that the bible shows us
[2:27:14] something
[2:27:17] it shows us something about saul going
[2:27:19] to the witch of endo
[2:27:22] is recorded here in the chronicles of of
[2:27:25] the prophets
[2:27:27] first chronicle chapter 10
[2:27:37] praise the lord now so you see the
[2:27:41] uh uh uh the the holy spirit
[2:27:45] brings it brings love you know uh uh
[2:27:49] uh like paul says the holy ghost uh a
[2:27:52] shared body in our heart
[2:27:53] but uh the love of god shared about in
[2:27:56] our heart by the holy ghost
[2:27:58] over there in acts chapter 5. you know
[2:28:01] so
[2:28:01] actually the holy ghost is the love of
[2:28:03] god you can't separate the two
[2:28:06] amen
[2:28:10] first chronicles chapter 10 verse 13 the
[2:28:12] bible says so
[2:28:13] saul died
[2:28:16] for his transgression we he committed
[2:28:19] against the lord
[2:28:20] even against the word of the lord
[2:28:23] because he disobeyed the word that
[2:28:24] samuel said to him
[2:28:27] which he kept mad and also by asking
[2:28:31] counsel
[2:28:32] of one that had a familiar spirit
[2:28:36] now you have to realize when saul came
[2:28:38] to power
[2:28:41] what he did he put he
[2:28:44] i mean he went around the country
[2:28:48] and put all those that were that was
[2:28:50] practicing witchcraft sorcerer people
[2:28:52] were familiar spirits he dealt with
[2:28:54] every one of them
[2:28:57] because when he disguised himself and
[2:29:00] went to the wish of angel what did she
[2:29:02] say
[2:29:03] i don't want for saul to know about this
[2:29:07] so the very thing that he destroyed is
[2:29:10] the same thing
[2:29:11] he returned back to that was the problem
[2:29:14] of the galilean church
[2:29:19] the very thing that he destroyed the
[2:29:21] very thing that he preached against
[2:29:25] it's the same thing that he resolved
[2:29:27] that tall
[2:29:34] are we together brother branham will say
[2:29:36] it's like this
[2:29:37] destroy your enemy before your enemy
[2:29:41] destroy you
[2:29:44] the same philistines that samson rose
[2:29:46] again
[2:29:47] he he pick up their gates he terrorized
[2:29:51] him
[2:29:52] was the very same philistine that took
[2:29:54] on his eyes
[2:30:00] saw whip out oh the people with familiar
[2:30:05] spirit protesting sorceress and everyone
[2:30:07] in there
[2:30:07] when he got to the place where he could
[2:30:09] no longer follow the voice of god
[2:30:13] he turned back and started looking for
[2:30:15] one
[2:30:16] in town do you know one
[2:30:25] praise alone i'll stop you there there
[2:30:29] are other things i want to go into
[2:30:31] but uh i will i will try to close right
[2:30:34] here
[2:30:35] and and just and just encourage you
[2:30:38] and just and just encourage you
[2:30:41] lift up the name of jesus christ amen
[2:30:44] just
[2:30:44] just to encourage you this word how what
[2:30:47] it takes
[2:30:48] to change us we don't have to manipulate
[2:30:53] the word
[2:30:54] we don't have to create quotation to
[2:30:56] look for escape
[2:30:59] just trust the lord we don't have to use
[2:31:02] the word
[2:31:03] to intimidate people to bring them to
[2:31:05] obedience
[2:31:12] god heals god deliver he stayed in the
[2:31:16] healing business
[2:31:21] what we must learn to do what we must
[2:31:24] learn to do
[2:31:26] is to trust the lord
[2:31:29] is to trust the lord take god at his
[2:31:33] word

[2:32:23] just it just blew my mind this is the
[2:32:24] second time i started reading
[2:32:26] on this on this subject and it has to do
[2:32:29] with our attachments
[2:32:36] praise the lord
[2:32:39] our attachments sometimes
[2:32:43] you know and and you know that and
[2:32:44] that's why the word
[2:32:46] the word do you know when people get
[2:32:48] attached
[2:32:49] to to movies ties they want to be like
[2:32:52] movie stars
[2:32:56] if they get attached to what people say
[2:32:58] about them
[2:32:59] you always want to be like what you are
[2:33:02] attached to
[2:33:09] praise the lord if you are attached to
[2:33:12] the word
[2:33:15] you won't care about what people say
[2:33:17] about you you won't care about what
[2:33:19] people think
[2:33:20] about you because you want to be the
[2:33:21] word
[2:33:22] [Music]
[2:33:22] [Applause]
[2:33:25] you are not looking at yourself through
[2:33:26] the minds of people
[2:33:31] because you are attached to the word
[2:33:35] lord i want to be what you want me to be
[2:33:40] because i call into god in his mind
[2:33:44] if you were not perfect he wouldn't have
[2:33:46] taken a picture of you
[2:33:48] the picture he talked about you was a
[2:33:51] perfect picture
[2:33:52] nothing can match to that

[2:34:03] nothing can match to that or what he
[2:34:06] thinks about you and how he feels about
[2:34:10] you
[2:34:12] if you just learn to put your arm around
[2:34:15] yourself
[2:34:16] give yourself an embrace say i love you
