praise the Lord we'll be in the house of the Lord as we said and we would just want to go right to the world praise the Lord and just like I said on Sunday Monday morning around 3:00 a.m. hello it was almost around 1 a.m. when I got a text from those brothers in South Africa so I had to speak for them only a morning service and the area came over to the house and to help me set up the computer and out of there so we had a little time of fellowship area then Eunice and Becky with my congregation praise the Lord but the reason why I said there is because I spoke on the subject there are morning the seller of or have spoken on namely church before but as so when waiting and I was thinking about it because I was thinking Lord what am I going to preach here this morning and I was I wanted to speak on something about Mary the matter for some reason I just said well let me just talk on something and just to be able to encourage the scene so tonight I want to go back to that subject the seller of all because there's a parallel year in the scripture and there is also a fulfillment of prophecy that I saw after so let's just read second King chapter 4 we from 2nd Kings chapter 4 2nd Kings chapter 4 would take this as a type on Elijah's ministry second Kings chapter 4 now second Kings chapter 4 we will read here from from verse 1 now they acquire a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophet unto Elisha saying that 7 my husband is dead and I'd know it that that 7 they fear the Lord and the creditor has come to take unto him my two sons as a bound man and Elisha said unto her her what shall I do for the tell me what have they in the house and she said the helmet have not anything in the house served a pot of oil then he said God borrow the vessels abroad of all the neighbors even empty vessel borrow not a few and when there I come in Dasha shut the door upon thee and upon the songs and shall pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is 4 so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon Hassan's who brought the vessels to her and she pull out and it came to pass when the vessels were falled that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is net a decimal and the Oersted then she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil and pay that debt and left Dow and that children of the rest let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus we want to thank you tonight we just actual God that you come now father and break the bread of life to us O God and bless the thought we have on our heart tonight for speaking Lord hearing and understanding Lord God we just commit ourself in your hands now in Jesus name Amen praise the Lord Allah bless you you may have your seat Matthew chapter 25 Matthew chapter 25 when we try to look at some few scriptures together tonight Matthew chapter 25 now Matthew chapter 25 open with behold the bridegroom cometh in Matthew chapter 25 we know there jesus likening the the kiddin of heaven year to these ten virgins and we know the stories for but let's drop down here where it gets interesting verse 6 and at midnight there came a a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out it once burned in the age of looter it burned in the age of Wesley a burn in the Pentecostal age but it went off but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us in you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourself Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 because I spoke on this before seller of also have kind of a titled is a path through to wait if that's okay I don't know if I think maybe Revelation chapter 3 let's look at verse 18 Revelation chapter 3 verse 8 in Jesus speaking to the laude church age he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire praise the Lord now where I want to I want to I want to grab our attention tonight I counsel thee to buy of me now he's standing in the loudest church age he was the one knocking at door behold I stand at the door and not and then he rebuked the edge for lukewarmness and blindness and being naked but yet he says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may be rich and white raiment that thou may be clothed and that the shame the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and annoyed that than eyes with a seal that thou mayor see so we see he's standing in the loudest church age and then revelry amis Matthew chapter 25 behold the bridegroom cometh is fulfilled in Revelation chapter 3 where he stands at the door and knock praise Lord so in a very same time where Matthew chapter 25 is being fulfilled now we hear in the wise virgin in that that should be representing the bride in saying go to them that sell all and he that is standing in that age is saying buy of me so we want to speak tonight about the seller of oil he's saying bad of me the wise virgin is saying go to him that self and he's saying why of me praise the Lord so there's a seller of oil in our age Isaiah chapter 51 55 sorry as I have 55 as I have 55 let's look at verse 1 Oh everyone that tested come here to the water and he that have no money come here buy and eat come buy wine and milk without money and without price praise the Lord as I said with our money and with our price and Jesus over in Matthew chapter 10 says freely receive freely gave praise the Lord so this whole business tonight I would come in to make praise the Lord this business come to talk about a business here but we realized that it's it's a business that we freely receive and we freely give with our money with our price but yet there is a seller of or that is in the Kami men praise the Lord amen so what actually got my attention was to see that right in the loudest church age the Son of Man ministry is standing up and saying I counsel thee to buy of me and the hours worth magic that was the fulfillment of Matthew chapter 25 because verbatim said in a sixth seal he said Matthew chapter 24 was the first seal to the sixth seal and because the seventh seal was silent that was the coming of the Lord which of course is Matthew chapter 25 behold the bridegroom cometh praise the Lord so right in that edge were the bridegroom cometh we see there is a wise virgin we see the foolish virgin and then we see the wise virgin she's the one a possessor of oil and she's having her lamb trimming and growing to meet the the bridegroom and then the foolish virgin she don't have or she run out of oil and she's asking now brother Branham says something yeah that I really make that I really got my attention on this on this subject now in Revelation chapter 4 message he preached revelation chapter 4 1961 he says look at the sleeping virgin look what is his look at a sleeping virgin all what she what she did do she had to sell something in order to buy her own what did she have to sell she had her old crease and all denominational denomination and things she saw out all she had in order to find Christ now so he's saying that she had to sell now as I was looking at this subject there were many things that were going through my mind so let's just go through some scriptures then we can be able to come back to our top praise the Lord and that Genesis chapter 25 Genesis 25 year in Genesis 25 Genesis 25 year or bringing us to the place of easel and Jacob verse 27 say and the boys grood I'm going to drop them the boys grew up and verse 29 and Jacob salt pottage and ISA came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feel me I pray thee wave with that same rare party for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom and Jacob said said sell me this day their birthright praise the Lord so we see another selling year I took this to be able to for us to see that the selling year was net more innocence it was it was just like like like making a trade like the battle system you know you have to give something you know to be able to receive something praise the Lord so either was telling or Jacob was telling either a year to be to sell his birthright which mean give me in the breath ride and then I will give you you know the part is for you to eat so we see another type also there in Luke in Luke chapter two off Jesus speak about a young rich ruler and when he talks about a young rich ruler he he said Luke chapter twelve territory he said sell all the half you know and and give arms to the pole you know when so the the same thought go in that line you know Jesus was now literally telling him to go and sell his house and sell everything that he has but he was looking at his desire you know what what was taking the most interest in his life you know what was taking you know is his most focus you know so yes that's what we want to look at tonight you know because when I was talking on this Sun on on Wednesday morning I was trying to bring all of this out you know because we are living in such an age word the gospel you know people have turned it into money-making thing now you're preaching a message on kinsella of art this is all my goodness what this other preacher is coming out way but I wanted to show actually year there in this age in this age and at this time were we are lifting up our head because our redemption is drawing nine this is time where we need to get into into this business amen that's what I want to talk about a little bit yeah we need to get into this business because we realized from from 2nd Kings chapter 4 this woman here I mean she she had a need her two young sons were going to be slaved they were going to be bound man you know the word was going to take them the influence of the word they were going to labor on a sin on a drugs in yeah I mean also something she had to do something so she went to me the Prophet praise the Lord Amen and we know they all represent the Holy Ghost so praise the Lord that's what we want to talk about a little bit I've been trying to do it on their sin you know and and my whole inspiration year the administrate of Jesus Christ in our age you know they have exposed us to the literal life of Jesus Christ yes expose us not to agreed not to a Dogma Netto a group that says were speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost and people can speak in tongues and live wrong but this is the literal life of Jesus Christ praise the Lord and with this experience it brings us to the place you know where where the you know the scripture also there's another scripture I would take up yet a little bit but it's at a place word you know Berta Brennan says this this this Holy Ghost is just like the oil and the wine you know he says the more you drink up there the more you want it and each day we can get a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord so that's what we want to talk about a little bit here trusting that the Lord will he will be able to help us praise the Lord let's look at some few things that that birdbrain said amen okay I think I'm kind of repeating on my nose somewhere yeah see bunch of that repeating I don't know how I did there but I'll be able to praise the Lord you mean okay so we realized that over in Revelation chapter 6 the scripture also talked about you know we getting down to the age were the the Holy Spirit call out and says the the oil in a wine should not be hurt that's Revelation chapter 6 verse 6 now Berta Branham says something on it he says all and wine in the Bible it's associated together always I got the concordance and look and there's a string of them like that we're all and wine goes together now you will also see that when Jesus talked about the parable of the Good Samaritan you know when he spoke about the parable of the Good Samaritan and he took the man over to the end that I mean well whatever he left with the man to take care of that wounded man he needed to buy or and wine to be able to take care of him though so some of the the parallel that Jesus I mean the Bourbon was looking at you through the scripture he says when when the truth of the promised Word of God has been truly reveal to his sins they're filled with all they all get stimulated wine is a stimulation glory I feel it right now stimulated with joy child seed when when it does it has the same effect upon him that wine does upon has the same effect that one does upon a natural man because when the revelation has been given off it of a truth of God and the true believers fill with all and the revelation is revealed that stimulation becomes so great that he he it makes him behave himself on normally praise the Lord now so looking at the the the wine the oil and the wine and also comparing a year with I was softly that we want to talk about I also put in another coat here you know okay that's also speak about the young rich ruler investment verbatim says now someone said now long ago as I told you he said you being a preacher why are you around with them businessmen he says I told them I was a surance ailment of internal life now because I had to use this code because there is many places where brother branham use the code over and over he says I'm not assuming but when he used the code I'm not a sale man he says we don't sell books and tapes you know and then talking about seller of art and realizing there that ministry right there in Revelation chapter three was a ministry that was going to be fulfilled honor the son of man ministry I wanted to be very clear that when I bring out this wholesale may think that you know the other coats were net will not clash with this one so yeah brother Branham says he's a sale man of internal life praise the Lord he says so Darius he says and and that's what Jesus was trying this young man has seemed something in him now that was different now you watch this he says this young man a young rich ruler saw something in Jesus that was different and he know he had internal life you know Jesus high internal life so instead of going to his rubber he he he come toward the person that has that he has seen exactly God ven aqui they would praise the Lord so you see that's why I want to drive drive to tonight with this seller of corn because we realized that this the wise virgin she higher art praise the Lord and if she higher all she new world is where she got it from praise the Lord she had an experience with God she knew where she got it from just like that little girl that went down to to Syria carry down there as a slave but she had a trooper spear and she know there was a prophet in Israel so when Emma felt sick and and and and and and he was striking with leprosy she was not shot to testify that there is a prophet in Israel and if my law can go down there he will get he why because she had an experience praise the Lord Amen and you see that is the thing with cell names you know cell man they always talk about their their product praise the Lord they always talk about their product and you will realize that people that have experienced the Baptistina of the Holy Ghost they always talk about it Amen when people are suffering from habit they were just dead look I used to struggle with hobby but since I received the holy gold that hobby has gone when somebody is sick you know they can be able to testify that our once was safe and I got pray for and I got healed the reason why we don't testify about these things sometimes we struggle in our mind what do we really have it praise the Lord because if we have it we will sell it freely we received freely we must gain its with our money is with our price praise the Lord the only one that is getting the benefit is the Lord Jesus Christ that's what we want to get to tonight praise the Lord Amen this seller of or realizing that we are in we are in we are in this time under this ministry of behold the bridegroom cometh that's the ministry that we are honor that is what our message is sounding out and that is what our lives should be sounding out we should be living alive that is saying behold the bridegroom cometh I'm not doing this because my bridegroom is coming soon I can be part of the teams of the world because the bridegroom cometh that is our message that is what we are living honor and because those wives version was living honor that expectation that is the reason why they kept all in the alarm the foolish virgin was pushing it off for the future but wise virgin we were expecting him right now even right now as we are speaking praise the Lord Amen they had the alarm trained they were ready amen if you realize then the foolish virgin that went through a night period as the whole world is going through a night period what is happening on the earth is affecting us believers it's affecting us bride just like it's affecting the world we are all going to through a night period but this bride is having oil in her lung ready at any moment if anything should happen if that call should come right now as we are speaking the bride is ready to be out of you praise the Lord what are we talking about what are we tested firing about amen in a message let your light so shine you know that's what brother Branham talks about he talks about the billboard and in that message he also brought it out he says we are not sales men but we are billboards praise the Lord but then you will realize what is built before is also for sales because a Bilbo is publicizing something that is being on special praise the Lord so it's also for sale praise the Lord now in the coat that we just read brother Branham says the foolish virgin she could not get the oil because she was not ready to give up her Creek and I believe that is the reason why in this age people are not getting to the Holy Ghost people are not getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost because there are things that we are cherishing more than cherishing the life of Jesus Christ they have things that we are holding to so dear little things that is bringing us pleasure and pride we esteem it and so much in our life now watch what Paul said what Paul said when he when he talked he spoke about either that is tonight Hebrews chapter 12 let's look at verse 16 Hebrew chapter 12 verse 16 he says least there be any fornicator or profane person as either now wash that a profane person as either who for one morsel of meal sold his birthright now so see how Paul the prophet of the age he took easy action ease or callousness for the Holy Ghost for the breath ride he took it as on cleanliness having no desire to be born again having no desire to receive the Holy Ghost he took that as a no cleanness and in the end in a seminal church elder Branham says he says the same spirit of a spiritual fornication he says is the same spirit of spiritual fornication now an important saying year either as a profane person his mind he did not put no value to the Holy Ghost he was just he was just satisfied to be the first bone that's all he was satisfied yeah I I mean about his age how long he's been serving the Lord has long he'd been in the message-id long you know he'd been reading the tapes he was just satisfied with that in his mind and he was so callous about the Holy Ghost and over in verse 17 Paul also saying for you know how dead after all when he will have inherited the blessing he was rejected because he was profane in his ways to was the things of God he made mock read about it you always find something to laugh about when it comes around the things of God now the time he wanted a blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears he cried and he cried and he cried he could find no place of repentance he said he sold his breath right praise the Lord where Benin says either he had all all his tricks in his life he was struggling but there was one thing that he wanted he wanted the breath right because he nor with that breath right he would get the blessing and he will overcome so no matter what I mean young people you're going through your mind bite or peer pressure and everything get to the breath right get to the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost sell this word for the Holy Ghost praise the Lord I mean the price of this word is not enough to to pay for the Holy Ghost but if you give the word or go as they give you the Holy Ghost praise the Lord he would take your price amen a seller of oil that's what I'm talking about tonight but balance is prefaced reign peffer weakness he said one on her just a vessel with a little boy in it talking about this with a woman she had nothing her two sons was going to be sword for Balmain she had nothing else she could do with this little vessel of orange and we're we don't woman amen wasn't very much just very little she had praise the Lord she was at the end this young boys here the entire future was going to be wrong they were going to be slave to sin amen slave to this world praise the Lord and I think that's that that is the thing with with with parents you know what I mean there was not be a time we go on our knees with I pray that God give my child a Holy Ghost law get a hold of that boy law get a hold of that girl let her not just be satisfied because they come to church with us they need their experience is their personal experience that is going to carry them all true amen and she was she was so concerned you know she needed to do something you know I was I was thinking about this I mean reading this today and driving alone and just thinking about garrison honor the Ministry of Elijah a widow woman with her two boys and he God did the same thing in our age Harry why we are two boys I mean she saw the art and saved the life of her boys everyone said the right thing and her boys received the Holy Ghost praise the Lord Elijah said to her what have you got in your house now you in your house this night you sitting in your house what have you got in the house praise the Lord there is not a good time to preach this message then right now you said it now in your house what have you got in the house amen and just a little odd in a vessel my goodness that was all all she has as investment saving that's all she had just a little oil in a vessel he said go to your neighbors go to your neighbors your co-workers praise the Lord your friends your relative go to them praise the Lord Amen oh my that's the son of man ministry those those wise virgin it says go going by oh praise the Lord just I mean just just a simple invitation where Brian told us that woman just an invitation to a shoeshine boy on the street inviting him to service praise the Lord I mean we are not a savior the least we can do tell somebody coming this in my church or come to church that's the least you can do and just being earnest and praying about it God will move up move upon that praise the Lord amen try to win so for Christ encourage somebody be a witness testify for Jesus Christ and when you are doing that you know what you're doing you are selling or praise the Lord Amen when you are doing that you are a seller of all because you are honor the anointing or the hour the anointing of the hour is to get people saved that's what jesus said I have come he says I've come to save those that are lost that's the ministry that's the reason why he came that's the reason why he saved us go to your neighbors borrow plaintiff from them he said fill the house forward of the EM praise the Lord all my goodness you realize in the scripture the Bible says and a woman acts her son go and bring vessel she expected them to bring enough now God has blessed the art all the vessels fill and more oil is left oh we can limit God praise the Lord amen you can now pour time on God simple day on him you came for our and meaning on him we have to open our heart prays the Lord but about him said he says fill the house full of them Amen see see what God one God has got two half empty vessel empty our mind empty our heart listen we have we have got so much doctrine we have got a clear second nonsense he said until we are down at the end of our barrier Amen people holding to the slaughter and all into this view and then they just fill their mind with all of these things he says there there's their owner one thing left turn to God in His Word praise the Lord and if you will do that get some empty vessel take out all the melodies out of them and all the Pentecostal out of them all the Baptist's out of them he said just let them be vessel and set them up in the house praise the Lord he says and then take from this vessel and begin to pour amen amen when we make more room than God can be able to fill us he says just begin to Paul she had enough to take care of her and her kids and everything else she paid off her debts amen praise the Lord she paid up all her that's why just what little she had consecrated to God following the Word of God of this prophet she came out right aiming praise the Lord he said God sent us a prophet that we take the Word of God that that will net takes something else but just get empty vessel and I believe that's what God is looking for in this hour if God can just get empty vessel and then take the Word of God and put it into the person praise the Lord Amen that's what he's desiring that's what we need to be filled with his spirit amen give me all in Milan and keep me burning amen that's what we need give me all in my line and keep me burning praise the Lord just seeing this time from from from second king of this woman honour and Elijah ministry amen and looking at Matthew
