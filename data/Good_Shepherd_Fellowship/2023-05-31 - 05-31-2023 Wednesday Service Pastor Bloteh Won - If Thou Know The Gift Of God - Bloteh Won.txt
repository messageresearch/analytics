tonight too before we uh change the order of the service just to be able to thank the Lord for the blessings that we have on the weekend amen every like every service is special in this own way that I believe that this weekend service was had its own specialty praise the Lord the Lord for the Saints from North Carolina that came out in the numbers to support their Pastor all the singing all the worship the preaching of the word and uh I mean as a body we have to be grateful for that we have to be thankful that you know the Lord can be able to expose us to all the different gifts in all the different varieties that he has because all of God's Redemptive blessings belong to us praise the Lord and when we have a time like this it is always good to come together you have to remember and that lepro that came back to Jesus was the one that identified the Revival in his day the ones that went back to the synagogues to the priests they were still caught up in the traditions of yaddai but there was one that knew that the season has changed there was one that knew that this was not just a common thing for the man to come and says you are cleans Go and show yourself to the priests and moreover he was a Samaritan so I just I just want for us to just take the time you see when God does such a thing like this it might look like an ordinary service we go home you know we talk about some other things that happen some of the the highlights of the service and the different thing but uh uh for me as a as as a pastor it speaks to me in a completely different way it speaks to me in a completely different way so I just want us to bring thanks tonight we have in a few prayer burdens we will take tonight but let's let's give thanks in a special way to the Lord uh you know on the

phone in the office there was there was uh there was a testimony and I wanted to share with us tonight before we change the order of the service and I I send a song back there who's on the Lost side among you and that's a song we we sank uh I mean a very long time praise the Lord there was a testimony that came through uh from from a prayer meeting uh yeah call it a prayer meeting um that we all been uh okay um praise the Lord now so uh let me get this quick here I was actually going to follow it I knew that if I don't do something about it I will okay I've actually kind of lost um kind of follow us place here okay this this is a testimony now from last Wednesday but there were down from Tennessee so I thought it was a blessing and encouragement so I thought I would share with you I want to share this testimony to the glory of God last Wednesday evening I was ministering at home which of course there's a that would be at the Happy Valley Church but uh the church has moved I think they should be dedicated in their new building in the first week of June so because they carry that name for all of these years because of the area where they were the area was called Happy Valley so that's why they carry that name that was that's brother Donna Reagan's church but I think they are because they have moved out of the area now so it's the Word of Life The Word of Life Tabernacle so uh he said he was preaching home and he was speaking on the the message at that word about halfway into the service I was monitoring I was uh sorry I was motioned by some of the Saints in the back that was uh a visible upset I stopped preaching and I told Brother Donny someone's sick and I asked the Saints to buy their head when we got to Sister Ruth Gatling her daughter was holding her she was unconscious and making a grading like sound this known as uh an agile breathing happened in the in the cardiac arrest you have four to five minutes window to restart the heart several of the the medical people attested there was no pause the Saints and albertadoni and myself started praying before the prayer was true sister Ruth was sitting up parting her feet smiling I got told I got this text from brother Benning young sister sister sister Ruth brother-in-law thank you so much for praying for my sister-in-law Ruth tonight I truly believe I witness a miracle at the church as you pray Ruth was out of faith and maybe even dead she was lifeless and and it looks as though she had passed as you pray she came to life almost immediately she regained consciousness coherent I believe and so does winter we witness a miracle right before our eyes God bless you I got this text this morning from Sister Ruth's daughter good morning brother I brought Mom at uh 5 30 this morning they did a CT scan number chest x-ray number blood work number sugar slightly elevated no dehydration blood pressure a little high the doctor actually had no explanation for what happened but I know God show up I know what I saw I know what I heard and I know God show up thank you for your prayers I appreciate I appreciate you she's doing well very well Thursday evening sister Ruth was eating at a local restaurant with no memory of what happened our God is an awesome God he opened the eyes of the blind he raised the deer to life praise the Lord amen I thought that I will I will share this with you brother can you help me and get this phone back there before you start buzzing the air I thought I would share that with you tonight and uh and I believe that uh we are in the hour and time where more of these things will become very common among us it all depends on uh you know the attitude that we take towards the world praise the Lord amen and that's that's the reason why we come together to magnify the name of the Lord because he's a god that is among his people praise the Lord is a god that is among his people he's not coming he's already here he's among his people and then and God is so anxious to make himself visible if we if we also can be excited to see him if we can just uh take on uh uh you know uh some good excitement in our mind and live a life of expectation to be able to see him God will show up amen he will show up every time that uh we we caught upon his name praise the Lord I just thought that I'll read there to you tonight just to be able to to uh to encourage you amen praise the Lord that we serve an awesome God yes he's uh he's the same yesterday and forever let's try that chorus who is on the Lost side among you I mean there should be many many years since we we sang that who is on the Lost side among you who will help us John in the fire who is from the Lord side among you who is taking side with the word you can know that I put that one there I faced our last verse like that I thought that was there was something that was missing no let's just do the chorus praise the Lord let's stand on our feet and just sing there tonight if you're on the Lower Side tonight amen then let's Worship the Lord together praise the Lord [Music] um who is on the Lord's Side among you [Music] who is [Music] taking sideways one more time yeah worries on the Lord died upon you oh God always songs [Music] please tell me oh [Music] oh yeah [Music] one more time now let's do that one more time [Music] promises who says [Music] Hallelujah the Lord bless you thank you musicians you may have your seat for the wide glory be to God amen so I will first uh request prayer that will be I'll be out tomorrow for brother plane take annual meetings we'll be speaking for him and on a weekend so please keep me in your prayers and uh we have a we have a friend a brother that have come true here it's been a why I brought the Samuel Taylor if you remember a couple of uh weeks ago I think it should be a month or two a broader uh prayer request for us to pray for him he's a minister in uh in in Ghana uh Cape Coast and his wife went to be with the Lord after bartering cancer and I think I think the the the church maybe try to get him out so he can be able to uh break out of his his thoughts and and all of that so he's he's over in the states most of the time when he do come he's a good friend to Brother Don Huffman and so he will normally pray for them there there are a few times he try to come true but at the time we have someone preaching for us so uh but uh I've gone over to support his meetings I better don't play see someone that I know over the years so he will be here in Minneapolis actually he was coming down to be with Grace Ministry but Brother Don is away so he got a hold of us and then I told him he can come turn him over to the deacons they would take care of him praise the Lord so uh that is our brother Samuel Taylor you'll be speaking for us on Sunday I'm sure you will enjoy the service but another thing that I will encourage you too is the other don't feel sorry for him amen don't feel sorry for him in the sense like uh you know when you hear those kind of things and you see the person it's so easy to go into a morning situation and the reason why I said don't feel sorry for him is because if you put up that attitude you will kill the service because he want to get out of it praise the Lord so you can come with your shouting shoes and bring your amen back and say Amen to the word and make the preacher to fear at home praise the Lord that's what I meant when I said don't feel sorry for him praise the Lord and so we will pray for our brother and we believe that he will he will be a blessing to you praise the Lord now this coming weekend uh we we want to have a [Music] um a zoom Fellowship you know uh during the covet we attempted doing that and uh the the you've been been using the the zoom for a youth meeting now the reason why I'm I'm I'm presenting it like that they will have the accession but uh for those that will that will be available to to get online you know I want to I want to open it to the place where because I wanted to be uh more than just a youth meeting I wanted to be a kind of for interactive uh Fellowship where our young people by the grace of God can be able to uh uh uh share some of their testimonies and and things that the Lord being dealing with them and being bringing them out of and and we will we'll still have brother Ariel to to take a time and share some of the things that he's been trying to share with the young people now one thing also there is that you know when we come under the context of uh youth Fellowship is it almost looks like well I'm naive I don't have to be part of it but uh the reason why I wanted to be a zoom Fellowship is also because some of the the subjects that they are dealing with is something that we want for parents to participate we want for parents to to monitor you know we went for parents to monitor I know it has it has its effect sometimes parents go very quiet yeah I mean children go very quiet you know when uh when when their parents are there they don't want to ask some of the questions that they will ask if their parents were not there but we wanted to be to be that way some in in that way a kind of for also uh help uh the one that is doing the presentation he knows that and you also knows that your children are now told things that you don't know about praise the Lord so we want to make sure that uh those that can be part of it we will be glad that you get on board now brother Jordan told me he's working on the flyers for uh our anniversary meetings that is coming up in the middle of July now uh these are meetings that we just started right after Kobe we actually uh got into renovating this place because we wanted to do I think at the time it was the 20th 25th year anniversary of this assembly and uh which of course covet never allowed us to but then after covet we brought brother uh a forest farmer and he and brother Prater were supposed to come and but he came and he preached for us that year so this year also we want to we want to do that and I'm hoping that uh ongoing weekend we can continue to to do that the reason there is the other I was thinking at that time we will be able to bring some of the history of this assembly because we have come a mighty Long Way praise the lord we are not there yet but we have come some Mass amen praise the Lord so I I try to work with Brother Steve and see if we can we can get uh uh if there is if there is any kind of for uh that's that's Eddie good to have you coming to visit with us yeah so we we appreciate you walking in and coming to be part of our service tonight yeah don't feel like a stranger and just uh just enjoy the Lord like we are doing praise the lord we are all family here now so uh uh we are working on that there is uh there is a July 4th and uh uh outing uh planes that we have so uh just like we did last year we will hope to do that uh the Flyers will be out and just like I said trying to do the best we get to give you one month to keep reminding you that we are having this so if you want to be part of it that it will now sound to you like we kept it away from you so uh uh the Flyers will soon be out they are always out there you can take one I think for the park the the directions that always they are out there you can take it and be part of it so uh I think uh that's that is uh uh the few things that I wanted to announce before we just go into the little part of the world that we want to share with you tonight praise the Lord and uh I won't I won't keep you long the major part of the service for me tonight was to give thanks and I've already done it so uh uh that that was that was my duty to the Lord to come and give thanks praise the Lord so let's stand on our feet and we can turn to Saint John chapter four let's stand on our feet we can turn to Saint John chapter 4. praise the Lord now you have to realize that I started a subject talking about generation conflict and uh and we were reading we were standing there in Saint John chapter four so tonight being a being at a prayer meeting I would not uh keep you long I would just want to take care a verse but there was something that stood out to me today uh uh while I was studying in my time of meditation scripture stood out to me in a very uh amazing way and it just been on my mind so if if I'm LED in that direction then I might be able to share that with you since John chapter four let's read from verse 7. see John chapter 4 we'll read from verse 7. there committed a woman of Samira to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciples were going away unto the city to buy meat then said the woman of Samira unto him how is it that thou being the Jews asked drink of me which I'm a woman of Samira for the Jews have no dealing with the Samaritans Jesus said Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knew it the gift of God and who is it that said today gave me to drink thou would have asked of him and he who have given thee Living Water praise the Lord amen this Bible has together Heavenly Father we just want to ask your blessings tonight upon your word and we pray that God you will take something from the text Lord and speak to us tonight in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat what's what do you what's your need what do you want now so uh uh tonight we I just want to share a little talk with you being at a prayer meeting tonight on uh if there are no the gift of God if that knoweth the gift of God that is that is over in the verse 10 Jesus answered and said if Dad kneweth the gift of God now uh trying to prepare for the prayer meeting tonight I thought that there is a portion in that uh Saint John chapter 4 that is that is that is very beautiful but uh as as the Lord will give us Grace we will continue to look into it and and uh and pray that the Lord will will bless us as we uh we we study there together so Jesus here is saying if they are kneweth the gift of God and who is and who is it that said today give me to drink thou who they have asked him of and he who have given the Living Water praise the Lord amen now let's let's turn over to uh uh I mean Luke chapter 9. let's turn over to Luke chapter 9. for some reason I can't get this thought of my mind so uh uh I will I will go in that direction and then I will so after meditating on this today I was actually playing the message uh life that is wanted of the gospel and I was trying to see some comparison because here the scripture will actually it's in Luke chapter 9 verse 57 . in sin Luke chapter 9 verse 57 now even before we turn this sorry look into Hebrew chapter 12. Hebrew chapter 12. let's look at verse 1. Hebrew chapter 12 verse 1. wherefore seeing we also are Compass about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight praise the Lord can we read that together let us lay aside every weight praise the Lord can we read that again let us lay aside every weight and there's sin now you see I want you to pay attention to that it's not sins it's sin the difference between sins and sin is that the sin goes back to unbelief amen Saints in the scripture deals with our our shortcoming our mistakes are we together let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us now many times maybe not you but me have been I've been guilty of looking at this scripture in the wrong way when I think about the sin they are easily beset us I think about my mistakes praise the Lord amen but looking at studying a little bit on sin Luke chapter 9 where we will read later help me to look at the subject a completely different way Paul is saying here let us lay aside every weight so there is something that is creating heaviness there is something that is creating heaviness praise the Lord and whatever that is creating their heaviness is attached to some form of unbelief in a sense like uh uh uh uh maybe doubt or fear or you know uh uh you know or maybe not not having the full understanding of of a subject now you will soon understand where I'm going with this I will come back to the gift of God I have uh but I mean I just I just thought about it today that I said oh my God what what an opportunity to be able to look in today so uh uh whatever was haunt him in tonight you know that's that's what we thank that song who is on the Lost side draw me in the fight amen come and join me in a fight tonight amen praise the Lord amen so we have a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with passion the race that is set before us amen so it goes back to Jesus saying he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved amen praise the Lord someone said there is a difference when you are running a marathon and then when you are just running running a Sprintex or something like that there is completely different so let's go back now to Luke chapter 9. so just hold Hebrews in your mind for the wide amen just whole Hebrews in your mind and now when we start creating you know a welcoming atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to have his Liberty you will have a lot of that you have people running from the street running right into the service so just be relaxed God is on in control amen yeah you have that I mean this this is not the first time you know we we saw the young lady running almost half naked right after service and coming to the to the poopy here to pray them I mean all filled with drugs and whatever they were so uh let's just let's just keep the Lord in our message amen and he would do whatever pleases him praise the Lord now let's get to our scripture verse 57 and it came to pass that as they went in the way a settlement said unto him Lord I will follow thee wheresoever thou goeth praise the Lord amen now he's expressing his will I will follow thee wheresoever that going but Jesus being the gift of God amen if thou know the gift of God and warm you are praying to tonight he sees our thoughts amen he knows when you are saying certain words where is actually coming from praise the Lord Jesus being the gift of God the Bible says and Jesus said unto him foxes have holes the birth of the Earth have Nets but the son of man have not were to lay his head praise the Lord why would Jesus say that to he why would Jesus say that to him he says pressing Jesus to Jesus I will follow thee praise the Lord amen lay aside ever wait and the sin that God so easily beset us so just keep all of those thoughts in mind Jesus being the world was Discerning something these are some of the things that are creating wait for people and one of faith that we can identify here is security praise the Lord amen I mean just like what we experience with that young man coming up right here when when our security is threatened it throws us off sometimes it's so easy for us to think oh am I safe I mean what was going on and and and and and not only the security of our environment but the security of our future under it's our c is the security of our future in in the economy the security of our future have to be in God amen it has to be in God so Jesus seen the desire of this young man but he was also being the word the gift of God just like he was able to discern the need of the Samaritan woman he's also descending the need of this young man praise the Lord amen foxes have holes the birds have met I don't have any place to lay my head yeah Jesus is is trying to tell him it's not all roses praise the Lord it's not all roses is everywhere we go we're not going to rent hotel and everybody will go there I mean to the restaurant and we will eat and it would just be roses praise the Lord and that's some of the things that is creating weight for people they are thinking about their security they have now fallen pulled everything in Christ amen so it's becoming a besetting getting the complete Victory to God With God all the way for them is threatening praise the Lord for them is threatening I don't know what the future you know you think about your children you think about everything and and and and and we must not be careless that's not the kind of a gospel we are preaching no that's not a kind of a gospel that we are preaching praise the Lord amen I preacher one brother brother uh uh Stephen prayed he says lordy you know we are not uh uh uh condemning anybody and all of that I know all that goes back to the thoughts of uh maybe Saturday night service but you see there was not intentional if you know me I'm not that kind of a person I just felt that burden on my heart because for the direction that the preacher was going and for what I know that it is epidemic that is in the word praise the Lord amen I know they are Saints in this in in this assembly one thing that I do appreciate of many of the people here even if they will not be in church they let us know you know uh uh a major reason why they are not in church and uh the ones that are traveling we know there are people that are uh uh uh you know living distance I was talking with brother Wesley and his wife I says I'll be happy if you just want to come on Sunday you know I won't I won't I won't have a peace of mind to know that you have to drive all of that way in the night yeah so so it's not a wish hunt preaching it's not a Witch Hunt preaching yes praise the Lord it is just something for us to be able to identify what we have to deal with it is not only for the preacher to stand behind the pulpit and echo down all the time if every one of us responsibility if we were taken in good Christian faith you can talk to a brother about what's going on brother we don't see you in church it doesn't have to come from the pulpit all the time are we together but watch the thought that I'm going with now Jesus pick up something in this young man seeing his desire to serve the Lord he loved the Lord he loved the message but there is a weight that he's honest there is a weight that he's honored there is something that will handle him not to go all alone let's watch the next one but bam always taught us the three and he said unto another Jesus speaking unto another follow me praise the Lord but he said Lord suffer me first to go suffer me what I want for us to look at that closely so for me suffer me what first suffer me first so with all of his desire to follow the law there was something that was taking the preeminence something was occupying his mind thinking that if I can get this done then I can serve the Lord better praise the Lord you hear some young if I can get married then I would say if the Lord better praise the Lord you must serve the Lord better now praise the Lord if you can't say the Lord better now I'm telling you brother so Jesus said you know he said to Jesus first saw for me first to go and bury my father Jesus said unto him let the dead bury the dead but go down and preach the kingdom of God why would Jesus say that why would Jesus say that it's almost like talking to the Young Rich ruler go and say all the half and and if you take if you take the gospel literally that way you will just think there I mean it must just be a bunch of poor people a bunch of you know people that are suffering or even having food to eat and stop you know that's not the top behind it that's not the thought what Jesus is doing he's identifying the weight that will easily beset you that's why you have to identify if you don't identify that you always realize that there is an inner desire to accept the Lord but there is something that keeps carrying you around the block are we are we together now if you want to put this into context Jesus he's saying let me go and bury my father put it into context into a cultural context what will be the place of a son to bury his father praise the Lord can anybody come up with any thought that might run through your mind the concern of a son to bury his father he might be the firstborn The Inheritance The Inheritance might be on his mind praise the Lord Amen brother Branham took this trip this trip to that I've I read it to you some time ago he took that and he compare it with Elijah right praise the Lord he says yeah Jesus told this man Let the dead bury the dead but with Elisha he allowed Elisha to go back praise the Lord now what are we talking about you have to know the gift of God this word that is being preached to us it knows our heart we were made by this word this word knows you better than you know yourself to one man God says go back to another man he says Let the dead bury the dead why because with the desire of following the Lord his honor await something is bothering his mind and until he can bring that thing to the fourth of the cross it will become a besetting sin it will create weakness to pray it will create excuses because he was coming out with one are we together all people there is there is so much of this blessing that we can enjoy amen there is so much we are really writing the structure we will get to that we are reading right in the context of the scripture where Jesus said no man can put his hand to the plug and take it back we will get to that there is so much index that we can enjoy even young people I mean there is just so much endings that you can enjoy so we can take a context of security for the first man the second man we can take maybe relationships or we can take uh inheritance you just put it into the different places to be able to help yourself this is concerning every one of us praise the Lord it's concerning every every one of us even uh you know as as your pastor to know that uh we when we come together we are expecting to hear from the Lord and we are expecting that God will speak to us he will bless us praise the Lord I went on a wait for for a long time I mean the the the the the the heaviness because of different things that you have to do and and your mind is you are not just to that place to be able to be the fullness of China you come you are trusting the Lord you know uh uh and then God comes down He blesses people but you know that in your heart the sin that does so easily beset us just like I said in most General times it will always point to you know maybe you can tell lies or maybe you're struggling with this habit and all of that I mean it's it's just the fruit of the weight that you are under when you can lay that aside then you will start to enjoy the victory he gave you the Holy Ghost when your heart is ready he gave you the Holy Ghost when you are fully surrounded are we together and another also said I will follow thee they are expressing desire but let me first let me first he's having something before him that he wished to achieve and now this this other place that's that's where I thought about relationships let me let me first let me first uh uh uh uh go and bathe in Fairway we shall at my home at home at my at my house praise the Lord amen people pulled the uh the uh they are walk with Christ they put their their seriousness with the word on hold and actually when you look at it it's not the people it's a spirit amen it's a spirit Barbarian says the devil knows how our mind runs so if he can just put one of these weight on you and that's all you think about he can rob you and enslave you because the least mistake you made you are just miserable you are just crying to God God take my life I don't want to live anymore Lord he has you under this weight you can we can never get to full victory to be able to have the joy of the law where we can clap our hand and rejoice in the singing of the word you try to press you try it you just you just have it Give the Lord a hand of praise it just looks like you're bringing two breaks together you are breaking rocks why because he gets the people under this and I will tell you I would tell you as truth it is just like I said I said the uh uh Saturday this is our age this is this age is rich this is this age amen this is It's rich and you can also enjoy the blessing of the age amen you can enjoy the latest phone you can enjoy a new vehicle it's something that you must enjoy praise the Lord you must enjoy you must not enjoy you there is two difference you must enjoy it it should not enjoy you praise the Lord as much as that that is the age that we are in just like brother Branham says he says a money is a snail to them the habit and to those that don't have it praise the Lord that's that's the way that's that's a that's a that's uh that's a a a good description from the prophet of God to to to be able to to describe the age that is before us praise the Lord word many measure the uh the the I walk with God by effortless substance and spirituality is measured by the the you know the vehicle that we drive and uh it must not be like that those are necessity we must enjoy it praise the Lord God bless us with it amen the Lord bless you with head and and I mean and he's blessing you I mean you should enjoy it as long as it's not anything that is contrary to the word of God I mean uh uh uh I mean give yourself a good treat praise the Lord Hallelujah I remember many years back I was telling some of the brothers I can't remember who I was telling that I used to tutor students back in our Refugee days and I had a very good family and they are friends of mine even till tomorrow very good family I used to tutor all their ear kids and you know and uh you know and uh you know them and that's how I used to pay my rent and you know we we had a struggling church so I could not live on the church so uh uh uh every month at the end of the month they sound funny when when I'm paid I would take myself to a place to go and treat myself I used to have a place that would go I would sit down as is you won't have this the rest of this month but today I'm going to give you a good treat you did well praise the Lord and I mean it's it's it's nothing to uh to uh to appeal to your sympathy but I mean there was there were times where I didn't know where my next meal would come from sure how do you know where my next meal would come from but I had that Concept in my mind it was not to show off I just felt like you know I tell myself you deserve it I'll give you a good trait because when the battle comes You Stand By Me we will fight it praise the Lord you see so that's that's what I'm trying to say you know uh it is it is uh it is it is either place word when we lay aside whatever the enemy is using as a weight you look at things completely different praise the Lord you look at things completely different I was down in South Africa I'll close here in a few minutes and uh and uh this young brother very young brother uh I think uh he should be in his uh early 40s about 42 a good business brothers so he bought he bought a uh you know a very Reserve he bought a reserve so the pastor took me there and then we were talking and and uh and and the other brother asked me and he says he says he says man this brother as young as he is he has he have in all of this you know and and uh there was a question that he asked me and I I said I said brother the difference between this guy and you and you and myself is that when he gets to the Millennium he will not have a complex praise the Lord because even as much as God has blessing it never changed his attitude he's one of the you will never even know you will never even know you are you will have to look for him he's the very young brother praise the Lord those things can only happen when we lay aside the weight and the sin that is easily besetting us praise the Lord those things can only happen when the grace is given to you by the gift of God the Holy Ghost and you lay those things aside praise the Lord amen they don't change your attitude it don't change your mindset it just make you a better Christian praise the Lord and make you to be grateful and thankful I mean you are on fire for God are we together let me read a quote to you and then we close it's almost 9 30 yeah now this will Graham says here in uh in a message testimony he said and you have seen me I just represent him just like the pool of water I bet that test there that pulled was not the gift of God it was just something that the angel of God came on is that right amen he said it was not the gift of God neither am I God's gift yes sir the gift of God was the ministry of the son of man but that Ministry was China true William Brennan are we together amen let's take this one led by the spirit now how many believe that the gift of God has come down from heaven in our midst do you believe that tonight amen your healing is your faith but the gift of God is perfect perfect it never feel it can't feel because it's God I told you last week that God you can separate God from his attributes amen God is Not only a Healer God is healing praise the Lord that's the reason why brother bran says healing is life why because God is the life-giver the reason why our body can respond to Healing is because life is in our body now let's take this one and we will close right here brother a man got to be Bond of the spirit of God regenerate a watch speak to the Rock wash in the blood of the Lamb with the baptism of the Holy Ghost as God's Divine witness in his soul that's truth yes sir said don't worry son everything's all right the death angel turned away the drought May Come the hard time May Come you may be persecuted May fun off in everything now you see if you have a weight if you are honor a weight there are ways will create a complex for you it will create a complex and you would think that oh I'm the only one going through this everybody life is better in this debt and what is that cloud it's just there to beset you to weaken your faith you are praying to a god that you don't believe he can do it you are only praying because it's your religious responsibility they say we must pray we must read the Bible and pray but you don't believe that God can do it why because this this this this way this cloud of weight are we together it's creating a besetting sin it keeps making you to stumble you try to rise up it brings you down something uh a reflex in your life something come to your mind the enemy just know how to press those buttons he knows where to hit you well bam says the drought May comes the hard time may come you may be persecuted make fun of everything but internal life stays right there amen let the neighbor says what they want let the minister even say what he wants let the doctor say what he wants praise the Lord that don't take away eternal life it is it's the gift of God that was given by the Holy Spirit praise the Lord it can go away is the holy spirit itself living in the individual praise the Lord so Jesus here talking to this woman you know right now in your mind you're dealing with Samaritan and and Jews but if you knew the gift of God if you knew the gift of God praise the Lord I hope those few thoughts was a blessing to you tonight amen let's lay aside every weight let's lay aside every week but all we can do to lay aside let's let's lay aside praise the Lord and when Jesus talked about it he says cast it down cast it down just just throw it away don't legs down carefully where you can pick it up again just just throw it away the musicians can come praise the Lord I hope that it was a blessing to you tonight amen we can we can take our hearts before the Lord we can take our hearts before the Lord you think you think about those people you know why why why the pillar of fire was coming by night and the pillow of cloud by day wait a minute you see even Paul at the beginning of that scripture he said we have a cloud of witnesses we have a cloud of witnesses God has given us an Abraham he has given us and Isaac he gave us an Abel he gave us all of this cloud of witnesses all of these people testimony hangs over our life that's the reason why brother Brahm says he God had to make a a zechariah's dumb because why should it be difficult for him to believe that Elizabeth in your old age will be conceived when he is the very priest in the Tabernacle don't he know about Abraham and Sarah don't he know that by Hannah and all the women that God visited in the Old Testament why should he why should it struck him [Music] praise the Lord [Music] oh if God can just help us [Music] if God can just help us praise the Lord [Music] Lord take every heaviness what is here that is that is that is that is bothering our mind what what is it what what is there anything too hard for the Lord is there anything that God can do can God give give uh give your children the Holy Ghost you have to worry about it [Music] sometimes we get into scared tactics and we become older protective you can't do God's work you we must believe the Lord we must be just like Jacob and amram we must be able to pray over little Moses and put him on the night River believing that God will take care of him [Music] let's lay as I ever wait
