[1:11:29] the text we send out I don't know for
[1:11:31] what reason but uh so there won't be a
[1:11:34] service this evening

[1:11:46] praise the Lord
[1:11:50] Genesis chapter
[1:11:53] 38
[1:11:56] this scripture if you if you have a
[1:12:00] coffee Bible
[1:12:03] you will see the other
[1:12:05] in his coffee Bible
[1:12:07] at the head at the top of Genesis 38
[1:12:09] it's written parentheses
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:14] it means that this this story
[1:12:18] that we about to read
[1:12:20] of Judah
[1:12:25] the Holy Spirit replaced it in Death
[1:12:29] in the in the story of Jacob
[1:12:32] and uh and his sons
[1:12:35] going to to Egypt
[1:12:41] after you read their story of Genesis 38
[1:12:46] then 39 starts and say and Joseph was
[1:12:49] brought down to Egypt
[1:12:51] praise the Lord
[1:12:54] and uh
[1:12:57] the last verse in 37
[1:13:00] speaks of the meeting I saw him
[1:13:04] into Egypt on to fortify
[1:13:08] an official pharaoh and the captain of
[1:13:10] the god
[1:13:12] now and it's talking about how Joseph
[1:13:14] is sold into
[1:13:17] Egypt
[1:13:20] and then out of a solving
[1:13:23] the the Bible just throw a story right
[1:13:27] in the middle
[1:13:29] of Joseph being sold into Egypt
[1:13:34] so uh
[1:13:37] it looks like an interruption
[1:13:40] but it's coffee Bible call it a
[1:13:43] parenthesis
[1:13:45] and there are few places in the Bible
[1:13:48] where you find parentheses
[1:13:50] word
[1:13:52] there's a story that is going on and
[1:13:55] then the Holy Spirit dropped another
[1:13:56] story right in the middle they have
[1:13:59] nothing to do or what is going on
[1:14:03] but we have learned that God
[1:14:06] Love Interruption
[1:14:09] praise the Lord
[1:14:11] I believe many of us are glad that he
[1:14:13] interrupted our first life
[1:14:16] praise the Lord
[1:14:18] when we thought that we were enjoying
[1:14:21] alcohol and smoking and adultery and
[1:14:24] fornication
[1:14:26] there was an interruption that took
[1:14:28] place
[1:14:30] God's love interruption
[1:14:33] foreign
[1:14:36] and I'm telling you when God interrupts
[1:14:39] you is good
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:14:41] his Interruption is always good
[1:14:46] praise the Lord
[1:14:48] it's one of the interruptions we're
[1:14:50] going to read about this morning
[1:14:52] praise the Lord
[1:14:54] amen not you
[1:14:57] take us through all
[1:14:59] the places there in the scripture
[1:15:02] but let's uh read it from Genesis 38.
[1:15:14] now let's read from verse 15.
[1:15:26] let's read from verse 15 when Judah saw
[1:15:29] her he taught her to be a hallot
[1:15:32] because she had covered her face
[1:15:38] and he turned in unto her by the white
[1:15:40] and said
[1:15:42] go to I pray thee let me come in on
[1:15:45] today
[1:15:46] for he knew not that she was his
[1:15:51] daughter-in-law
[1:15:55] and she said what will that give me
[1:15:58] that thou mayor coming unto me
[1:16:02] and he said I will send thee a kid from
[1:16:06] the floor and she said
[1:16:09] will thy give me the pledge till thou
[1:16:12] Senate
[1:16:13] and he said what pledge shall I give
[1:16:17] thee
[1:16:18] and she said
[1:16:20] that sickness that bracelets and their
[1:16:23] staff that is in their hand
[1:16:25] now she asks for three things that are
[1:16:28] very significant to a Jewish ruler
[1:16:32] praise the Lord
[1:16:40] okay let me let me read my my brain is
[1:16:42] starting to go ahead of me
[1:16:46] stop it
[1:16:48] and he said what plague shall I give
[1:16:51] thee and she said the sickness that
[1:16:53] bracelet and that style that is in the
[1:16:56] hand and he gave it to her
[1:16:59] and came in unto her
[1:17:01] and she conceived by him
[1:17:06] and she arose and went away
[1:17:09] and laid by
[1:17:11] Avail from her and put on the Garment of
[1:17:15] her widowhole
[1:17:18] praise the Lord
[1:17:21] and Judah sent the cave by the hand of
[1:17:24] his friend they are a Dolomite to
[1:17:28] receive his players from the woman hand
[1:17:30] but he found her net
[1:17:33] then he asked the man of the place
[1:17:35] saying where is the Halal
[1:17:38] that was opened by the wayside and they
[1:17:41] said there was no harlot in this place
[1:17:45] and he returned to Judah and said I
[1:17:48] cannot find her and also the man of the
[1:17:50] place said that there was no harlot in
[1:17:53] the place and Judah said let her take it
[1:17:55] to her least we be shame
[1:18:00] behold I have sinned this kid and they
[1:18:03] all have not found her
[1:18:05] and it came to pass
[1:18:07] about three months after
[1:18:10] that it was told you that saying tell my
[1:18:13] that daughter-in-law have played the
[1:18:15] halot
[1:18:16] and also behold she is with child
[1:18:21] by Woodham
[1:18:23] and Judah said bring her
[1:18:25] and let her be burned
[1:18:30] when she was brought forth she sinned
[1:18:34] to her father-in-law saying by the man
[1:18:39] whose these are
[1:18:42] the sickness the braceless and the staff
[1:18:47] by the man who these are
[1:18:50] I'm with child
[1:18:53] and she said discern I pray thee
[1:18:58] who are these
[1:19:00] the singer the bracelet and the staff
[1:19:03] and Judah acknowledged him which means
[1:19:07] he accepted that they were his
[1:19:10] he acknowledged him and said she had
[1:19:14] been more righteous than ah
[1:19:17] because that she because that I gave her
[1:19:22] net
[1:19:23] to Shimla my son
[1:19:25] and he knew her again no more
[1:19:29] let us pray Heavenly Father we have read
[1:19:32] a portion of your word
[1:19:34] that we choose to speak Lord on this
[1:19:37] first date of the year
[1:19:39] first service of the year
[1:19:41] father we are trusting ourselves in your
[1:19:44] hands come Lord this morning take the
[1:19:48] inspiration on our hearts Lord and just
[1:19:51] uh bless us father we love you we
[1:19:54] appreciate you in Jesus name we pray
[1:19:57] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[1:20:00] your seed
[1:20:02] this morning uh
[1:20:08] after the service on Friday nights out
[1:20:11] of the morning went home I pretty much
[1:20:13] slept the whole day
[1:20:15] I would just I just lazy Myself Away
[1:20:21] praise the Lord
[1:20:23] I just lazy myself waiting and my body
[1:20:27] was just redeeming all the rest that is
[1:20:29] needed
[1:20:31] since we came back from from South
[1:20:34] Africa we really never gave ourselves
[1:20:36] some rest
[1:20:38] but then uh uh I woke up last night and
[1:20:42] and uh
[1:20:46] got something to eat and went back to
[1:20:48] bedding and I was up around 1am
[1:20:53] trying to gather my strength in
[1:20:56] and I was wishing this was last Sunday
[1:20:58] amen
[1:21:00] praise the Lord
[1:21:02] but then I was thinking uh while we were
[1:21:05] there in South Africa
[1:21:07] there's uh there's a brother from
[1:21:09] Namibia
[1:21:11] that greeted the church in the morning
[1:21:14] at what what they would normally do they
[1:21:17] would have a preacher coming and greet
[1:21:20] the sins he will he will speak a little
[1:21:21] bit and and then before the speaker
[1:21:25] comes up
[1:21:26] so he greeted a church and I brought a
[1:21:30] little greeting on
[1:21:33] uh
[1:21:39] on Christmas
[1:21:41] but then he also he also dropped a
[1:21:44] thought
[1:21:46] where
[1:21:51] where he brought what was on his mind
[1:21:53] now uh for the new year he greeted the
[1:21:57] people
[1:21:58] and wish them a Happy New Year
[1:22:01] in order there praise the Lord
[1:22:06] and then he was talking about uh uh the
[1:22:09] significance of of 23 in the Bible
[1:22:14] you know he pick up uh you know these
[1:22:17] preachers they can be oh my goodness
[1:22:20] so he took a 23. and then he started
[1:22:23] running with 23 he started talking about
[1:22:25] different things but Brandon was 23
[1:22:28] years old when he went to uh the
[1:22:30] Pentecostal meeting in uh
[1:22:34] mishawaki you know he talks about that
[1:22:37] and then
[1:22:39] uh how brother Branham had only 23
[1:22:42] dollars in his bank account when he told
[1:22:45] his wife that you take care of the kids
[1:22:47] I got to go and settle this thing in my
[1:22:49] life when he went down to the cage
[1:22:52] where he met the angel of the Lord he
[1:22:54] had only 23 dollars in his bank account
[1:22:57] and he started running with 23 all over
[1:23:00] the place
[1:23:01] praise the Lord
[1:23:03] but he was also bringing the father of
[1:23:05] how 23 is a very important very
[1:23:09] significant number
[1:23:11] uh uh in the scripture
[1:23:14] so
[1:23:16] after the service I told him I said
[1:23:18] brother I'm going to read every 23
[1:23:21] chapter in the Bible when I get home
[1:23:24] praise the Lord
[1:23:26] I said that was amazing I'm going to
[1:23:28] read every 23 chapter so whatever is
[1:23:32] hiding for 2023 I have to find it
[1:23:37] but Leviticus chapter 23
[1:23:41] this word uh
[1:23:45] the seven fisa of Israel is is written
[1:23:50] so this morning I was playing Leviticus
[1:23:53] 23 that was in my mind I was you know
[1:23:56] trying to grab my thoughts and and uh
[1:24:00] and
[1:24:01] um
[1:24:03] because I had a message on my heart to
[1:24:06] preach and for some reason I couldn't I
[1:24:10] couldn't uh you know find the time to
[1:24:12] speak on it
[1:24:13] but then my mind just went blank I was
[1:24:15] just thinking I came I really can't grab
[1:24:18] what what is the thought so I started
[1:24:20] playing a commentary this morning on
[1:24:23] Leviticus chapter 23 and just and just
[1:24:26] listening to the whole thing there but
[1:24:29] then I realized the other uh why I was
[1:24:32] playing it
[1:24:34] then uh
[1:24:37] the the commentary mention something
[1:24:40] uh you know in the scripture
[1:24:43] that helped me he actually helped me to
[1:24:47] to be able to grab what I what I'm going
[1:24:49] to speak to you this morning but let's
[1:24:52] read Leviticus chapter 23 let's read
[1:24:54] verse 1 and 2.
[1:24:56] there is something there there that I
[1:24:59] finally this morning when I was
[1:25:01] listening to the commentary I like to
[1:25:04] listen to Bible commentary
[1:25:07] you have to create a picture in my mind
[1:25:10] when when I'm going through the
[1:25:12] scripture
[1:25:13] and the Lord speak unto Moses saying
[1:25:16] Speak unto the children of Israel and
[1:25:18] say unto them
[1:25:19] concerning the feasts of the Lord
[1:25:23] wish ye shall Proclaim
[1:25:26] to obey holy convocations
[1:25:30] these even this are my Feasts now we
[1:25:35] know so there are there are seven feast
[1:25:37] days that are given to to Israel
[1:25:41] and uh
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:45] and also
[1:25:47] in Exeter you see that in Exodus chapter
[1:25:50] 12 after God spoke to them about the
[1:25:54] applying of the blood and and everything
[1:25:56] he also make them to know that he was
[1:26:00] also going to give them his fees and it
[1:26:03] was going to be a holy convocation it
[1:26:05] was going to be a memoriam
[1:26:08] so what I was listening to the to the
[1:26:11] commentary I started looking through the
[1:26:13] word convocation it means rehearsal
[1:26:19] rehearsal to rehearse
[1:26:22] so that caught my mind and I was
[1:26:24] thinking wow because uh
[1:26:28] you know he give you it gives you a
[1:26:30] pause he gave you something to think
[1:26:32] about how God was actually telling them
[1:26:35] to to rehearse this
[1:26:38] now so this morning as I was uh
[1:26:45] as I was
[1:26:46] listening to death or looking at that
[1:26:53] praise the Lord
[1:26:57] I try to pull in in
[1:27:00] the message
[1:27:03] and I realized that uh
[1:27:06] brother Branham spoke and he used their
[1:27:08] scripture uh convocation
[1:27:12] and in the Feast of the trumpet
[1:27:16] praise the Lord
[1:27:23] he ran from Leviticus chapter
[1:27:26] 23 that we just read from
[1:27:30] and uh
[1:27:35] but he says something that also grabbed
[1:27:39] my attention this morning also as I was
[1:27:42] reading that
[1:27:47] praise the Lord
[1:27:49] he gets to talking about how
[1:27:51] the holy convocation
[1:27:54] was on the on the eighth day he gets
[1:27:57] talking about the Eighth Day
[1:27:59] and uh
[1:28:03] and then he says that there is something
[1:28:07] you know
[1:28:13] you know there are people that have
[1:28:15] tried to make
[1:28:17] a daughtering out of the eight day
[1:28:20] praise the Lord just like they have done
[1:28:23] with Millennium teachings and different
[1:28:26] things
[1:28:27] but uh there is there is uh there is
[1:28:30] really not something that we can
[1:28:33] establish here
[1:28:34] uh we know the eighth date is more
[1:28:38] spiritual to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:41] amen
[1:28:43] is more spiritual just like the bright
[1:28:45] age is more spiritual God calling his
[1:28:48] people to come up higher he calling out
[1:28:51] uh uh you know to something more than
[1:28:55] what uh uh the church age has has
[1:28:59] provided
[1:29:00] praise the Lord
[1:29:02] speaking likely on the same thing last
[1:29:06] weekend
[1:29:07] we were talking about the breaking of
[1:29:10] the cycle to every Revival brother
[1:29:12] Brandon faced the cycle of Revival and
[1:29:16] death has never failed all the churches
[1:29:19] have experienced death after their
[1:29:23] Revival
[1:29:24] God start using them they get on fire
[1:29:27] and then at a certain time they just die
[1:29:30] out
[1:29:31] now
[1:29:33] this
[1:29:35] age
[1:29:36] La audition also experienced a cycle of
[1:29:41] Revival and death
[1:29:43] but when God called his people out in
[1:29:47] Revelation
[1:29:48] 18 4 and say come out of her my people
[1:29:51] we know that that voice that called the
[1:29:55] people out
[1:29:56] in Revelation 18 4 actually by scripture
[1:30:00] is sounded in Revelation 3.
[1:30:04] because you see the Book of Revelation
[1:30:07] is not actually any kind of a sequence
[1:30:11] order the events in Revelation because
[1:30:15] Revelation 1
[1:30:18] and three speaks about the seven Church
[1:30:21] ages
[1:30:22] now you will realize there were things
[1:30:24] that were happening in the seven Church
[1:30:26] ages in Revelation 1 and 3 that is also
[1:30:30] spoke about in the rest of the other
[1:30:33] ages
[1:30:35] praise the Lord
[1:30:36] because if you go over to to the
[1:30:40] territorial Church age and you start to
[1:30:43] talk about the Dark Age
[1:30:45] you will not understand
[1:30:47] uh the persecution in that age until you
[1:30:51] go to Revelation chapter 6 and you start
[1:30:54] to see when uh uh uh one of those house
[1:30:59] rather you know came and started
[1:31:02] bringing persecution on the church
[1:31:04] so that's how the Book of Revelation is
[1:31:07] rating it's written with a lot of
[1:31:08] symbols and is and and the story is kind
[1:31:12] of intertwined
[1:31:13] but uh so actually
[1:31:17] in Revelation 18 4 your year the uh uh
[1:31:21] calling out of mystery Babylon and say
[1:31:24] come out of her mind people thou voice
[1:31:27] you hear in Revelation chapter chapter
[1:31:29] 18 4 that cry come out of Harmon people
[1:31:33] the actual time it did happen was in
[1:31:37] Revelation 3 14.
[1:31:41] it was in the laodicea church age that
[1:31:44] that voice sounded
[1:31:46] now
[1:31:47] that voice that said come out of her in
[1:31:50] Revelation 3 John said I heard a knock
[1:31:55] on the door
[1:31:58] that Knack in Revelation chapter 3 was a
[1:32:02] voice
[1:32:03] in Revelation 18 that was saying come
[1:32:06] out
[1:32:11] are we together
[1:32:12] praise the Lord
[1:32:17] so I mean they are they are just a lot
[1:32:20] of those things that are there in the
[1:32:22] scripture
[1:32:23] and uh and we can be grateful that God
[1:32:29] sent us a prophet to be able to help us
[1:32:32] to see those things amen
[1:32:34] who if the Lord bless us we'll find time
[1:32:37] to look into that but it blessed my
[1:32:40] heart this morning when I was I was
[1:32:43] looking at uh
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:46] you know looking at this scripture and
[1:32:49] just and just thinking about uh uh you
[1:32:54] know what what a blessing it is that God
[1:32:57] has given us a holy convocation
[1:33:01] he has called us in everything that uh
[1:33:05] we are doing here uh in our work with
[1:33:10] God the prophet of God make us to
[1:33:12] understand we are just rehearsing he
[1:33:14] says for another holy convocation that
[1:33:17] is coming
[1:33:18] so we want to we want to wish you well
[1:33:23] a happy New Year amen we want to wish
[1:33:27] you all of God's blessing good health
[1:33:30] and
[1:33:31] and
[1:33:33] strength
[1:33:34] and uh
[1:33:37] we want to pray that God
[1:33:39] will
[1:33:41] allow you to experience more of him
[1:33:45] because there is more of God to
[1:33:46] experience
[1:33:48] than just coming to church
[1:33:50] there is more of God to experience
[1:33:54] praise the Lord
[1:33:55] we pray that God will allow you to
[1:33:59] experience more of him to have a
[1:34:01] personal relationship
[1:34:04] with him and uh to walk hand in hand
[1:34:08] with the Lord
[1:34:09] that is our prayer that is our desire
[1:34:12] that this year we bring bring us because
[1:34:16] every year bring us closer
[1:34:18] to the coming of the Lord
[1:34:20] when it will be we don't know
[1:34:23] praise the Lord we don't know we know
[1:34:26] there are the signs they are all telling
[1:34:29] us praise the Lord amen when will their
[1:34:33] physical coming be we don't know
[1:34:36] but what we know is that
[1:34:39] the Lord himself
[1:34:41] shall descend
[1:34:43] amen and in 1963 there was a descending
[1:34:47] that had to do with the the opening of
[1:34:51] the world
[1:34:52] but Benham called the appearing of
[1:34:54] Christ
[1:34:55] and so
[1:34:58] we can say he is here
[1:35:00] amen we can say he is here just as much
[1:35:04] as I believe in a physical lecture
[1:35:07] returning of the Lord
[1:35:10] so uh every year bring us closer to the
[1:35:15] coming of the Lord
[1:35:17] and uh
[1:35:18] we are hoping that this year
[1:35:21] will set us full in our experience

[1:37:26] Jesus
[1:37:29] speaking year
[1:37:31] thing that that I'm come to destroy the
[1:37:35] Lord
[1:37:36] or the prophets
[1:37:38] I'm not calm to destroy but to fulfill
[1:37:43] for verily I said unto you
[1:37:47] till Heaven and Earth
[1:37:51] to Heaven and Earth pass now one job
[1:37:57] praise the Lord
[1:37:58] oh tether
[1:38:01] shall ignore wise paths from the Lord
[1:38:05] till all be fulfilled
[1:38:09] whosoever therefore shall break one
[1:38:12] of these least combining
[1:38:16] and shall teach men so
[1:38:19] he shall be called
[1:38:21] the least in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:38:25] but whosoever shall do and teach them
[1:38:27] the same Shall be Called great in the
[1:38:30] Kingdom of Heaven
[1:38:32] for I say it unto you
[1:38:35] that accept your righteousness
[1:38:39] shot a seed
[1:38:41] the righteousness of the strife
[1:38:44] and the Pharisees
[1:38:47] yesha in no case enter into
[1:38:51] the kingdom of heaven
[1:38:53] praise the Lord
[1:38:55] so this morning for a little text I want
[1:38:58] to speak on
[1:39:01] she's more righteous than I
[1:39:05] with an inspiration exceeding
[1:39:07] righteousness
[1:39:09] what was Jesus talking about
[1:39:12] what was this righteousness
[1:39:15] that needed to exceed the righteousness
[1:39:18] of the strife and the Pharisees
[1:39:21] praise the Lord
[1:39:23] amen
[1:39:25] what is this righteousness
[1:39:30] glory be to God
[1:39:34] amen
[1:39:40] if you look through the scripture
[1:39:42] you stand it through the scripture uh
[1:39:45] very well you realize that in that time
[1:39:48] of our Lord Jesus
[1:39:52] these men they were the stripes and the
[1:39:55] Pharisees
[1:39:56] they were men
[1:39:58] there were
[1:40:00] that were highly highly respected by
[1:40:02] their people
[1:40:05] we know they were different
[1:40:07] there were different groups of them
[1:40:10] different
[1:40:11] uh assembling different Gathering of
[1:40:15] them
[1:40:16] and while I was looking in today's I was
[1:40:19] uh also had a privilege to look at some
[1:40:23] things
[1:40:24] and uh
[1:40:29] this was the first time that Jesus would
[1:40:31] mentioned
[1:40:32] in his own teaching
[1:40:34] he would mention the stripe and the
[1:40:36] Pharisees
[1:40:37] but if you look into the scripture
[1:40:41] he mentioned the tribe and the Pharisees
[1:40:44] 13 times
[1:40:46] in the Book of Matthew
[1:40:49] praise the Lord
[1:40:52] he implied there for the most part they
[1:40:55] were the that was the school of the
[1:40:59] Pharisees
[1:41:02] this man there were the stripes and the
[1:41:05] Pharisees
[1:41:06] these guys were people that uh
[1:41:10] were set aside there were men just like
[1:41:13] in the Days of Elijah the Bible talked
[1:41:15] about the school of the prophets there
[1:41:17] were men that were set aside to be able
[1:41:19] to study the strong so they were they
[1:41:22] were people that studied the strong
[1:41:24] there was another group
[1:41:27] there was a
[1:41:31] the chief the Bible would talk about the
[1:41:34] chief priests
[1:41:35] the Bible will talk about the chief
[1:41:37] priests well which of course Caiaphas
[1:41:39] was part of the chief priest
[1:41:42] and the chief priests
[1:41:45] for some reason will come out of the
[1:41:48] sahindrance
[1:41:50] the difference between the Pharisees and
[1:41:53] the Sadducees or the the chief priests
[1:41:55] came from out of the Sadducees the
[1:41:57] difference between the Pharisees and the
[1:41:59] saddresses is that the Pharisees they
[1:42:02] believe in the Resurrection The Cyrus
[1:42:04] cyruses did not
[1:42:07] but they had a great Council in their
[1:42:10] Council was the San hindrance Council
[1:42:13] beside the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:42:16] they had another group called The the
[1:42:19] zealots you know these guys were
[1:42:22] fanatics
[1:42:25] they were very fun activities when it
[1:42:27] came to um
[1:42:29] to the to the
[1:42:31] you know to the Old Testament straw
[1:42:35] now so as as we look into this just to
[1:42:38] give us a little background here about
[1:42:40] the stripes and the Pharisees because
[1:42:43] Jesus is establishing something here he
[1:42:46] never said never came to destroy the
[1:42:48] Lord he came as a fulfillment of the
[1:42:51] Lord
[1:42:52] praise the Lord Amen in another place he
[1:42:56] speaks about the the Sabbath which of
[1:42:59] course I will I want to look at that a
[1:43:02] little bit in when they come in terms of
[1:43:04] the Lord
[1:43:05] and uh he's saying now one now one job
[1:43:09] now one apostrophe not a point not a
[1:43:12] period not a crossing of a t where it's
[1:43:15] ever going to fail from the Lord but
[1:43:17] everything is going to be fulfilled
[1:43:20] praise the Lord
[1:43:22] if he is the Fulfillment of the Lord if
[1:43:25] he is the one that is going to to bring
[1:43:27] the Lord uh the life of the Lord to
[1:43:31] light
[1:43:32] and yeah he's telling us that
[1:43:35] this man
[1:43:37] there were highly respected in their
[1:43:40] days the stripes and the Pharisees
[1:43:47] while setting a pic of something there
[1:43:49] from mine uh
[1:43:52] concording the righteousness of the
[1:43:53] stripes and the Pharisees and no tears
[1:43:56] says the righteousness consists of
[1:43:59] outward
[1:44:00] observation
[1:44:02] they were very good in their ceremony
[1:44:04] and traditional laws
[1:44:07] these guys
[1:44:08] the the dress code was right
[1:44:12] you know they were people that respected
[1:44:16] the tradition the ceremony they offer
[1:44:18] sacrifices the fasted off thing Jesus
[1:44:21] spoke about that
[1:44:23] they pray much is also written in the
[1:44:26] scripture
[1:44:27] their oblations the attacks they are
[1:44:30] ceremony in their religious but they
[1:44:34] neglected the justice
[1:44:36] the truth
[1:44:39] amen
[1:44:42] the Holiness of heart
[1:44:47] praise the Lord
[1:44:49] if you remember the story of the Good
[1:44:51] Samaritan
[1:44:53] when Jesus gave the parable of the Good
[1:44:56] Samaritan
[1:44:57] he brought an image of Olivine
[1:45:02] he brought an image of a fire seed also
[1:45:05] into that picture
[1:45:06] so Yara said he's telling us here that
[1:45:11] except we have a righteousness that is
[1:45:14] see the righteousness of the stripe and
[1:45:16] the Pharisees
[1:45:17] but yet when you look through the
[1:45:20] scripture Jesus never spared the strap
[1:45:22] and the Pharisees
[1:45:24] he told them that they were just like
[1:45:26] the grave that is painted white on the
[1:45:30] outside
[1:45:31] but inside is full of their main bones
[1:45:35] praise the Lord but he is the very one
[1:45:38] year in the beginning of his ministering
[1:45:40] he's now telling us that we must have a
[1:45:43] righteousness
[1:45:45] that exceed the righteousness
[1:45:49] of this man that was very
[1:45:52] lawyer and they were very good in the
[1:45:55] way that they kept their dress code and
[1:45:58] kept the Traditions you know ceremony
[1:46:00] and all of that
[1:46:02] Jesus gave a parable for one of them
[1:46:05] praying in the synagogues and saying I'm
[1:46:07] not like this man you know I've kept all
[1:46:10] your Commandments and you know and all
[1:46:12] of that so they were very loud uh uh you
[1:46:16] know praying guys they love to be heard
[1:46:18] you know the love to be seen
[1:46:21] when you go in the marketplaces they
[1:46:23] want it to be greeted by the people
[1:46:25] with their titles
[1:46:28] you're talking on exceeding
[1:46:29] righteousness
[1:46:31] praise the Lord
[1:46:39] I'm sure that when it comes to all of
[1:46:42] those outward thing is really going to
[1:46:45] it's really going to
[1:46:48] cast every one of us to a place this
[1:46:50] morning to examine our life praise the
[1:46:52] Lord
[1:46:53] amen
[1:46:57] because one like me I couldn't even get
[1:46:59] my shirt price pressed right this
[1:47:01] morning so
[1:47:02] if I was among the Pharisees they would
[1:47:05] put me outside
[1:47:06] because the bones on my shirts are not
[1:47:08] standing up
[1:47:10] praise the Lord
[1:47:12] amen
[1:47:15] but just like we said in uh in uh
[1:47:23] when we were talking about Rachel
[1:47:25] weeping for her children
[1:47:27] God
[1:47:29] the almighty God that we serve he placed
[1:47:33] some things in his word just like what
[1:47:36] we just read in in Genesis chapter 38
[1:47:42] an amazing story
[1:47:45] I will take something here from Brother
[1:47:46] Branham that would be one of the two
[1:47:48] quotes that we would read this morning
[1:47:50] and then we'll ride on the wings of
[1:47:53] inspiration to speak to you question and
[1:47:56] answer on Hebrew somebody asked brother
[1:47:58] Benham about a Scarlet thread that was
[1:48:01] on one of the hands of
[1:48:04] uh tear my voice because she had twins
[1:48:08] when she got conceived for Judah
[1:48:12] the Scarlet trade if you will notice
[1:48:16] it was Judea he had a son
[1:48:20] and one of his son Mary a Canaanite
[1:48:24] woman so Tema was actually a gentile
[1:48:27] woman
[1:48:29] praise the Lord
[1:48:31] and she was one of the three women
[1:48:34] that were ever recorded in the genology
[1:48:38] of our Lord Jesus
[1:48:41] and those three women were Gentile women
[1:48:43] it's strange that they never pulled
[1:48:46] Sarah
[1:48:47] in uh in Jesus genealogy even though she
[1:48:50] was the wife of Abraham the mother of
[1:48:53] Isaac
[1:48:54] and Rebecca and uh and and Rachel in all
[1:48:59] of those great Hebrew women
[1:49:00] but there were three women that were
[1:49:03] placed
[1:49:04] in the genology of Jesus Christ
[1:49:08] and Tema was one of them
[1:49:11] she was a Kennedy woman she was a
[1:49:13] gentile woman
[1:49:14] she was our mother
[1:49:16] and this kind of woman didn't have any
[1:49:20] children
[1:49:24] and his son died talking about Judah now
[1:49:29] then the Lord then was
[1:49:32] the next son had to take
[1:49:36] the brother's wife and raise up a seed
[1:49:39] to the Dead
[1:49:40] praise the Lord
[1:49:42] it was a lot that if a man of Israel was
[1:49:47] dead and never had a child you know uh
[1:49:51] the
[1:49:54] his wife was one of his brother would
[1:49:57] take his wife just to be able to keep
[1:50:00] his name alive
[1:50:03] so the first song will be giving the
[1:50:05] name of the brother that passed and then
[1:50:08] the rest of the children will take their
[1:50:11] father's name just to be able to keep it
[1:50:14] was it was all about Resurrection
[1:50:17] now you see if you look in the scripture
[1:50:19] also you will realize that Jesus
[1:50:22] one time he was confronted by the
[1:50:24] Pharisees because they did not believe
[1:50:27] in Resurrection they asked Jesus a
[1:50:29] question
[1:50:30] there was a brother that that Amari he
[1:50:33] never had a child he died the next
[1:50:35] brother got married he never had a child
[1:50:37] he died the next one took the woman and
[1:50:40] they never had a child in Jesus said
[1:50:42] they asked Jesus and said in the
[1:50:44] resurrection if you say there is a
[1:50:46] resurrection
[1:50:47] in the resurrection who wife
[1:50:50] would this woman be
[1:50:54] praise the Lord
[1:50:56] amen
[1:50:57] and Jesus said
[1:50:59] we will not marry
[1:51:01] or give in to Mary
[1:51:04] in the resurrection that's why he said
[1:51:06] he brought up that story you know uh
[1:51:11] because they were talking about raising
[1:51:13] up a seed so Jesus
[1:51:16] spoke in a way to be able to make them
[1:51:20] to understand that when we cross this
[1:51:22] life you know we will go back to our
[1:51:26] original state the sex law will not
[1:51:29] exist
[1:51:30] praise the Lord
[1:51:32] so Jesus said we'll be just like the
[1:51:34] Angels they will they will now be giving
[1:51:37] giving birth and all of that
[1:51:40] so uh uh uh that that was what was
[1:51:43] happening here so Judah had a son that
[1:51:46] married Tema and then the son died so
[1:51:50] the she was given to the next son and he
[1:51:53] did not wanted to raise a sea for his
[1:51:55] brother and uh and because of that God
[1:51:58] God kill him God struck him you know uh
[1:52:02] you could read the whole story there in
[1:52:04] Genesis 38 and she was given to the next
[1:52:06] boy and he also died he never had it
[1:52:09] never had a child
[1:52:11] but then the the next son was young he
[1:52:14] was he was a smaller boy so uh uh the
[1:52:17] father Judah just told Tama to go back
[1:52:20] to her people and uh you know and wait
[1:52:23] until uh this song would grow up let's
[1:52:27] continue to read him and the other man
[1:52:30] did not cooperate
[1:52:32] all do us he issue and the Lord slayed
[1:52:37] him then he had one young son so Judah
[1:52:41] said wait till the sun grow up until the
[1:52:44] place where you
[1:52:47] can marry him and when he grew up to the
[1:52:50] place that he was supposed to marry
[1:52:54] his two brothers former wife
[1:52:57] well he was supposed to take her then to
[1:53:00] raise up seed up to his brethrens
[1:53:08] that had died Judith did not give the
[1:53:12] woman the candle woman his son the boy
[1:53:14] and just let him go ahead
[1:53:19] so she's seeing there she was doing
[1:53:23] wrong
[1:53:25] so she goes out and she wrap into wrap
[1:53:29] her face in the veil and sit in in a
[1:53:32] public place as a Holland will say
[1:53:36] Judah come by and he took the woman
[1:53:39] for the wife and uh and she was a
[1:53:42] hollered and he lived with her now
[1:53:45] thinking that she was a halot but she
[1:53:48] did that she she disguised herself and
[1:53:51] put herself in a place because she
[1:53:55] wanted
[1:53:56] she wanted something let's let's
[1:53:57] continue to read
[1:53:59] he said give me the kid
[1:54:02] or she said that well give me a sign
[1:54:04] that you would do it and so she took the
[1:54:08] staff and the sickness and so forth and
[1:54:10] kept it
[1:54:11] and when they brought the kid
[1:54:13] they couldn't find the hollow cause she
[1:54:17] was in a harlot
[1:54:19] after the why
[1:54:21] she has shown up that she was to be a
[1:54:24] mother
[1:54:26] and and when she showed up that she was
[1:54:30] to be a mother
[1:54:31] they came and told you that that
[1:54:33] daughter-in-law have played a halot
[1:54:36] said because there she
[1:54:39] she used to be a mother
[1:54:41] and uh and you're both boys are dead he
[1:54:44] says well we will call her forth and
[1:54:47] burn her
[1:54:49] praise the Lord
[1:54:51] we would call her for and burn her you
[1:54:55] see that's just how strong the Lord was
[1:54:58] the Lord was very very strong
[1:55:04] if she play a halot
[1:55:07] she had to be burned
[1:55:09] she had to be stoned we saw the same
[1:55:12] thing in Jesus Ministries in John
[1:55:14] chapter 8.
[1:55:16] just bear with me a little bit here
[1:55:18] praise the Lord
[1:55:20] amen
[1:55:33] now I was reading through the scripture
[1:55:38] when you go over
[1:55:41] to numbers
[1:55:43] if we want to just turn to numbers a
[1:55:46] little bit
[1:56:06] Hallelujah
[1:56:19] why Israel was traveling
[1:56:23] there was a
[1:56:25] there was a man
[1:56:41] that disobeyed the the
[1:56:47] he kind of for disobeying
[1:56:49] the the Shabba
[1:56:58] the Bible says he went out and he was
[1:57:00] picking sticks
[1:57:02] on the Sabbath day
[1:57:09] praise the Lord
[1:57:11] amen
[1:57:16] if you look over in numbers
[1:57:19] uh that should be around Numbers Chapter
[1:57:22] 15.
[1:57:41] Numbers Chapter 15.
[1:57:49] look over to
[1:57:56] verse 35
[1:57:59] verse 32
[1:58:02] just I'm just trying to bring something
[1:58:04] a little bit on the law so we can we can
[1:58:07] appreciate God's uh Grace here
[1:58:10] [Music]
[1:58:12] amen
[1:58:14] verse 32 and while the children of
[1:58:16] Israel were in the wilderness
[1:58:18] the father man that gathers takes upon
[1:58:21] the Sabbath day
[1:58:27] and they that found him Gathering Stakes
[1:58:30] brought him onto Moses and to Aaron
[1:58:34] and unto all the congregation
[1:58:37] and they put him
[1:58:39] in World which means they put him in a
[1:58:41] prison
[1:58:42] because it was not declared what should
[1:58:46] be done unto him
[1:58:48] and the law said unto Moses
[1:58:51] The man shall be surely put to death
[1:58:55] or the congregation
[1:58:58] shall Stone him
[1:59:00] with stones without the camp
[1:59:04] so they have to take this man
[1:59:06] out of the camp
[1:59:09] and they had to Stone him
[1:59:11] because he was gathering sticks
[1:59:14] on
[1:59:16] the Sabbath day
[1:59:18] praise the Lord
[1:59:21] now
[1:59:22] if you go over to the New Testament
[1:59:28] one time in Saint Luke chapter 6.
[1:59:34] the Pharisees came
[1:59:36] to Jesus and he said unto him
[1:59:41] why are your servants
[1:59:48] say Luke chapter 6 verse 1 and it came
[1:59:50] to pass
[1:59:51] on the second Sabbath after the first
[1:59:55] that he went through the cornfield and
[1:59:58] his disciple pluck the ears of corn and
[2:00:01] then eat robbing them in their hands
[2:00:04] and setting of the Pharisees said unto
[2:00:06] them
[2:00:07] why do you hear that which is
[2:00:11] not lawful to do on the Sabbath day
[2:00:15] praise the Lord now this was the place
[2:00:18] where Jesus will use that statement I'm
[2:00:21] the lord of the Sabbath
[2:00:23] amen
[2:00:25] and Jesus will answer them and say it's
[2:00:28] having you read in the Lord he read so
[2:00:31] much this what David did when he himself
[2:00:34] was hungry
[2:00:35] and
[2:00:37] and there which were with him how they
[2:00:40] went into the house of God and then they
[2:00:42] eat of the shortbread now so you ever
[2:00:46] sit here in the Old Testament a man goes
[2:00:48] out to gather States
[2:00:51] on the Sabbath day whether he was
[2:00:53] gathering it to Coke or whatever he was
[2:00:56] doing
[2:00:57] they were told to keep the Sabbath day
[2:00:59] holy now follow me now because we were
[2:01:01] going to we as we're trying to look at
[2:01:03] exceeding righteousness
[2:01:06] foreign
[2:01:09] and when they saw him they arrested him
[2:01:12] they pray they put him in the praising
[2:01:15] and waited for for Moses to come and
[2:01:18] when they asked Moses Moses went before
[2:01:20] the Lord and Moses commanded that a man
[2:01:23] should be stoned to death
[2:01:26] praise the Lord
[2:01:28] amen
[2:01:32] and uh
[2:01:34] Jesus and his disciple are caught in the
[2:01:37] same thing he had going through the calm
[2:01:40] field the talk comes and he had you know
[2:01:42] caught in the up they are rubbing it
[2:01:44] they are eating
[2:01:45] and uh the Pharisees see them also then
[2:01:48] ask them why are you doing this
[2:01:51] why are you doing this why are you
[2:01:53] caught doing this
[2:01:55] why you find yourself in this place
[2:01:59] and Jesus come out and then he made this
[2:02:01] statement
[2:02:03] that
[2:02:07] he says uh
[2:02:11] they are the Sabbath
[2:02:13] that the son of man is Lord of the
[2:02:15] Sabbath amen
[2:02:22] there's a statement here what he made
[2:02:24] and says uh man was not made for the
[2:02:27] Sabbath the sabbah was made for me
[2:02:29] the son of man is the lord of the
[2:02:31] Sabbath
[2:02:32] now if you look at the two sins you you
[2:02:35] will think that uh uh
[2:02:39] there is uh
[2:02:42] the Lord was now just that that man that
[2:02:46] was picking stake on the Sabbath day he
[2:02:48] was caught and he was thrown to death
[2:02:52] but what I would want you to also
[2:02:54] picture in your mind
[2:02:56] is the other
[2:03:00] as the children of Israel were traveling
[2:03:02] with Moses
[2:03:03] there was a counter for struggle that
[2:03:07] they had under the leadership of Moses
[2:03:13] there were many times through their
[2:03:14] Journey where the murmur they complained
[2:03:17] and then
[2:03:20] Quran and Dayton Rose against Moses
[2:03:23] even Moses Sister Miriam she also spoke
[2:03:28] against her brother and all of that so
[2:03:31] there was a sense of a kind of a defined
[2:03:34] nature or defined spirit that was among
[2:03:37] the people
[2:03:38] most of the time the people will think
[2:03:40] they are some of the things that Moses
[2:03:42] brought them was just his own thinking
[2:03:44] or just his own word
[2:03:46] there were not many other people that
[2:03:49] embraced the leadership of Moses
[2:03:53] when Quran and Dayton Rose against Moses
[2:03:56] there were hundreds of the people that
[2:03:58] talked to them and God had to open the
[2:03:59] Earth and swallow them up
[2:04:02] praise the Lord
[2:04:05] so this man is somehow seeing honor
[2:04:09] accountable defined attitude
[2:04:13] praise the Lord
[2:04:15] amen because one thing you are also
[2:04:18] realize is that
[2:04:21] God took care of them on their Journey
[2:04:25] praise the Lord
[2:04:27] every morning they never had to farm
[2:04:29] they never had to go to the shopping
[2:04:31] center God gave them while the Bible
[2:04:34] called Angels food
[2:04:37] if you realize you will also see in a
[2:04:41] scripture that the scripture in the way
[2:04:44] that God
[2:04:45] referred to the manner that came down
[2:04:48] every morning there was only one time in
[2:04:51] the Bible where God called him minor
[2:04:53] because he was referring to how the
[2:04:56] people called it
[2:04:58] but the scripture over and over says how
[2:05:01] God failed them with angels food the
[2:05:04] people were the ones that call him Manu
[2:05:07] and if you actually look at it Mano was
[2:05:10] a kind of for a derogatory expression
[2:05:14] the way they described it the way they
[2:05:16] describe it they were longing for the
[2:05:18] garlic and the onions and whatever they
[2:05:20] left in Egypt and this that God was
[2:05:23] feeling them and sustaining them in the
[2:05:25] wilderness they gave it such a poor name
[2:05:31] praise the Lord
[2:05:33] they called him Mana God never caught
[2:05:36] him Mana
[2:05:38] he called it Angel's fault
[2:05:41] praise the Lord
[2:05:43] that was not the first time one time
[2:05:45] Elijah was under the Jannah portrayed
[2:05:47] God allowed the angels to beg him food
[2:05:50] and brought it for him to eat
[2:05:53] Jesus himself was lacking himself told
[2:05:56] the bread that comes down from heaven he
[2:05:59] says I'm the bread of life
[2:06:04] but the people India longing to go back
[2:06:07] to Egypt destroy what God provided for
[2:06:10] them
[2:06:11] when the neither water God gave them the
[2:06:13] water
[2:06:15] amen
[2:06:16] when Anita meet God provided swans for
[2:06:19] them to eat
[2:06:23] so what is the need what was the need
[2:06:27] that this man will go out what was he
[2:06:29] doing what actually was he doing if it
[2:06:32] was not just a defiant
[2:06:41] praise the Lord
[2:06:44] now I believe that was also a way that
[2:06:47] God was expressing that he meant what he
[2:06:51] said
[2:06:51] when he says keep the Sabbath day holy
[2:06:54] he meant what he said
[2:07:00] praise the Lord
[2:07:03] man in the I fall in nature will always
[2:07:06] love to transgress God's law to see what
[2:07:09] God will do
[2:07:13] praise the Lord
[2:07:18] so you see that God
[2:07:22] he had a very strong regard for his law
[2:07:27] we get back to the story of Judah and
[2:07:30] his sons here
[2:07:32] so as we read through a year we realize
[2:07:34] that
[2:07:36] the young man grew up and and Judah
[2:07:39] never gave her to the woman as the Lord
[2:07:41] required him too
[2:07:43] let's continue to read and after she has
[2:07:46] shown up
[2:07:48] she was a mother
[2:07:49] and she showed up there she was to be a
[2:07:52] mother and uh the cam told Judah and
[2:07:57] Judah said she must be burned
[2:08:00] praise the Lord
[2:08:02] and so she sent word to Judah and said
[2:08:06] the man that did this
[2:08:10] on the staff and the sickness
[2:08:13] all right
[2:08:14] that that was her father-in-law
[2:08:18] and he said
[2:08:20] she's more righteous than I
[2:08:24] why he make that statement
[2:08:28] what did Judah make Destiny let me just
[2:08:31] read down and and just finish this here
[2:08:33] with Robert Ben saying now when she knew
[2:08:37] that her children
[2:08:41] was to be delivered
[2:08:43] they were twins she had twins boys the
[2:08:47] first baby that was to be born
[2:08:51] the the old Jewish custom the first
[2:08:54] child was the birthright the first child
[2:08:57] to break forth and now remember
[2:09:02] uh that was her first child none of the
[2:09:05] rest of the boys had
[2:09:07] had any children by her she
[2:09:11] had never had a child till this time and
[2:09:15] and when
[2:09:16] her first child Break Forth it was just
[2:09:19] a hand it was the hand that came out and
[2:09:22] then the male wife put a Scarlet
[2:09:25] straight around it because the scholar
[2:09:28] stress speaks of redemption
[2:09:31] praise the Lord
[2:09:33] that's the first son of the Virgin Mary
[2:09:37] have the scholarship of redemption
[2:09:41] now so we we we we grab the picture here
[2:09:45] that the reason why God's like this
[2:09:49] story
[2:09:50] right in the middle of Joseph's story
[2:09:55] praise the Lord
[2:09:57] it's all because of redemption
[2:10:03] praise the Lord remember God promised
[2:10:06] Abraham that with a mighty
[2:10:09] Mighty I bring your people out they were
[2:10:12] so John
[2:10:13] now here is the beginning of Israel's
[2:10:16] Soul journey into Egypt that start with
[2:10:20] the selling
[2:10:22] of Joseph
[2:10:24] and Joseph is now taken to Egypt just at
[2:10:27] the beginning of that story
[2:10:30] God created a parenthesis
[2:10:34] and he introduced this this story of
[2:10:37] tema the bath of the mind no word no way
[2:10:40] related to Joseph that was not Joseph
[2:10:42] mother
[2:10:43] but God just blessed him and the only
[2:10:46] reason why he placed it there is because
[2:10:48] what is going to happen in Egypt
[2:10:51] is tied to Redemption
[2:10:58] praise the Lord
[2:10:59] amen God promised to bring his people
[2:11:02] out
[2:11:04] with his own strong hand
[2:11:07] and this whole thing is playing out now
[2:11:10] this was a gentile Woman by by the
[2:11:13] father you you realize that there was
[2:11:16] some stigma to it maybe Joseph I mean
[2:11:19] Judah in his mind was just trying to you
[2:11:22] know play this woman out where my first
[2:11:25] son died by her the next one couldn't
[2:11:27] hide a child by her well okay let her
[2:11:29] just stay by
[2:11:31] but God in his mind
[2:11:34] ignoring how
[2:11:37] the law will play out with the Jews and
[2:11:40] then Grace will come to us the Gentiles
[2:11:44] praise the Lord
[2:11:46] the mind of God Is Bigger than our mind
[2:11:53] praise the Lord
[2:11:56] your
[2:11:57] sitting down and and uh and and she's
[2:12:00] being obedient she sent back to her
[2:12:02] father's house she's sitting here and
[2:12:04] she's waiting and she here that that son
[2:12:07] is now an off a growing age
[2:12:10] think about the story of Ruth
[2:12:14] praise the Lord
[2:12:16] amen
[2:12:18] that's what Ruth was giving over to boys
[2:12:21] it was all in the sense of redemption
[2:12:26] she never had a a child for for none of
[2:12:30] Naomi Sons
[2:12:32] so now Naomi is now going to give her
[2:12:34] over to bore us and then when she has a
[2:12:37] child it will redeem the name of the
[2:12:39] Dead
[2:12:41] praise the Lord because the god that we
[2:12:44] serve is not the god of the Dead He's
[2:12:46] the god of the living
[2:12:48] that's why that law was set in Israel
[2:12:51] because he's the god of the living
[2:12:54] so tell my ear that she's sitting down
[2:12:56] there and she just uh uh waiting and
[2:13:00] hoping and she hear that this boy and
[2:13:02] nothing is said nobody have come to tell
[2:13:04] her anything
[2:13:06] praise the Lord
[2:13:09] you have to realize that God
[2:13:12] his plan the plan of God
[2:13:16] it's a plane of redemption something
[2:13:18] that was in God's mind
[2:13:20] and if God's if you are under God's Plan
[2:13:24] of Redemption there's a prophecy that
[2:13:27] hangs all your life is going to
[2:13:29] influence your choices
[2:13:32] praise the Lord
[2:13:33] amen God's Plan of Redemption is going
[2:13:37] to interrupt your schedule
[2:13:40] because God's plan was before the
[2:13:42] foundation of the word
[2:13:44] amen before the foundation of the world
[2:13:47] before there was a start before there
[2:13:49] was a earth that was created God had his
[2:13:52] plane in his mind
[2:13:55] amen
[2:13:57] and he thought of you
[2:14:00] so you are not coming to come to time
[2:14:04] and make your own choices and make your
[2:14:07] own plan you go right ahead
[2:14:11] amen oh God great Eternal time when that
[2:14:15] time reaches he is going to interrupt
[2:14:18] whatever play you are making whatever
[2:14:22] choices you have made
[2:14:26] um
[2:14:27] praise the Lord
[2:14:31] are we together
[2:14:36] she's righteous than I
[2:14:40] more righteous
[2:14:44] than I
[2:14:46] praise the Lord
[2:14:48] so when Jesus was speaking about the
[2:14:50] exceeding righteousness
[2:14:52] he was saying except your righteousness
[2:14:56] and see the righteousness yes the
[2:14:58] righteousness that exceed the
[2:15:00] righteousness of the Pharisees is the
[2:15:03] righteousness that goes back to God's
[2:15:05] mind
[2:15:07] praise the Lord
[2:15:09] it's not the righteousness induced and
[2:15:11] dumb because you cannot outbreak the
[2:15:14] Pharisees in that
[2:15:16] if the righteousness that goes back to
[2:15:19] God's mind
[2:15:24] which of course will see few of them
[2:15:25] through the scripture
[2:15:28] praise the Lord
[2:15:30] Hallelujah
[2:15:32] are we together
[2:15:37] Yeah Tim I'm sitting down and then she's
[2:15:39] waiting
[2:15:40] and uh and uh uh Judah is making his own
[2:15:45] plane and nobody is caring for her she
[2:15:48] she sent back to her father house
[2:15:51] praise the Lord
[2:15:59] what an inspiration from Norway
[2:16:03] now you have to know that this woman
[2:16:06] she got married into the house off
[2:16:09] into a Jewish house
[2:16:11] she knows what it is by the law to play
[2:16:15] the halot
[2:16:20] praise the Lord
[2:16:22] that's why she was not stupid
[2:16:24] she asked for an Evidence
[2:16:27] she knew what it was
[2:16:30] to play the halot
[2:16:36] glory be to God
[2:16:40] amen
[2:16:43] but moreover Redemption
[2:16:46] was driving her
[2:16:49] God's Plan of Redemption
[2:16:53] praise the Lord
[2:16:55] the scripture says in the book of uh uh
[2:16:58] Hebrew Rehab by faith
[2:17:01] now you tell me now be Earnest with me
[2:17:05] when rehab was helping the spies
[2:17:08] praise the Lord
[2:17:10] was rehab doing there by faith
[2:17:18] amen
[2:17:19] there was something that was driving her
[2:17:23] praise the Lord let me tell you behind
[2:17:26] this behind our Redemption behind our
[2:17:29] Salvation behind our deliverance
[2:17:32] there is a driving force
[2:17:35] there is nothing that drive the world
[2:17:37] and God's Plan of Redemption his Plan of
[2:17:41] Redemption is even greater than his plan
[2:17:43] of creation
[2:17:46] the one plane that God had in his mind
[2:17:49] that took him from a self-existent being
[2:17:52] right
[2:17:53] to become a hema
[2:17:55] what his Plan of Redemption
[2:17:58] is God's Plan of Redemption that is
[2:18:00] driving this word
[2:18:03] Prophet has been influenced by God's
[2:18:05] Plan of Redemption
[2:18:07] is the driving force
[2:18:11] praise the Lord
[2:18:19] is a thing that is influencing the word
[2:18:23] is the thing that is behind
[2:18:26] all the actions
[2:18:28] and reactions of Our Lives
[2:18:31] is God's Plan of Redemption
[2:18:34] is the driving force
[2:18:37] praise the Lord
[2:18:38] Paul call it the Holy Ghost constrained
[2:18:41] us he called it the constraining power
[2:18:44] amen
[2:18:45] out of our will out of our desire
[2:18:50] sometimes beyond our choices
[2:18:55] there's a driving force
[2:18:59] praise the Lord
[2:19:01] that driving force choose
[2:19:06] the family we will be born in
[2:19:09] it was that driving force that choose
[2:19:12] whether we will be male or female
[2:19:16] it comes right from that driving force
[2:19:18] God's Plan of Redemption
[2:19:22] praise the Lord
[2:19:27] everywhere we can imagine a a term at
[2:19:31] having an inspiration here
[2:19:33] and saying I'm going to disguise myself
[2:19:36] as a halot
[2:19:39] praise the Lord
[2:19:42] and I'm going to set myself up and her
[2:19:45] intention was just for one man
[2:19:51] she was not going to be a holler for all
[2:19:54] the men on the street and any man that
[2:19:57] come back it was just for one man
[2:20:00] praise the Lord
[2:20:02] Hallelujah
[2:20:05] you have to realize Rahab said she told
[2:20:08] the spies we have heard of your friend
[2:20:11] we heard how the the the the rare seed
[2:20:15] draw before you we heard how you have
[2:20:18] destroyed Nations
[2:20:20] there was something about the people of
[2:20:23] Israel in the adjoining
[2:20:26] where all the nation knew that these
[2:20:29] were special people
[2:20:31] they knew that they were only a covenant
[2:20:34] from the fire by night they can see a
[2:20:36] light in the heavens
[2:20:39] that was the pillar of fire that hang
[2:20:41] over them
[2:20:43] yes the people that never had an
[2:20:45] organized government they never had an
[2:20:47] organized Army but yet they were
[2:20:49] overcoming Nations
[2:20:52] because almighty God was India mixed
[2:21:00] praise the Lord
[2:21:01] and why was God doing it
[2:21:07] because he
[2:21:11] he amen he had promised him
[2:21:17] are we together
[2:21:24] she's more righteous than I
[2:21:28] glory be to God
[2:21:30] because
[2:21:32] Judah realized that he was acting on the
[2:21:35] natural Lord
[2:21:37] but there was something in this woman
[2:21:40] amen
[2:21:42] that was acting on the spiritual Lord of
[2:21:44] God
[2:21:48] because the bringing foresee was all
[2:21:50] about Redemption you have to remember
[2:21:52] they were all influenced
[2:21:55] by the seed of the woman
[2:21:58] that goes back to Redemption
[2:22:00] God never gave the seed to the man he
[2:22:03] gave the seed to the woman
[2:22:09] are we together
[2:22:10] so he realized that Tama did that
[2:22:15] because she wanted to be identified
[2:22:18] with the Seed of Abraham
[2:22:22] amen she wanted to be identified that
[2:22:25] was what Paul pick up in intuitive when
[2:22:28] he said she shall be saved in
[2:22:30] childbearing
[2:22:32] there was something that identified them
[2:22:34] with the with the the abrahamic Covenant
[2:22:39] she wanted to be identified with the
[2:22:41] Seed of Abraham
[2:22:42] he realized that that's why he said she
[2:22:45] was more righteous than I
[2:22:49] because she disguised herself now if you
[2:22:51] think about that in a natural way you
[2:22:53] would just think that while this woman
[2:22:56] she was calling this woman while my
[2:22:58] goodness
[2:22:59] that she would put herself out there
[2:23:01] like that
[2:23:02] but she had an intention
[2:23:05] praise the Lord
[2:23:06] amen
[2:23:08] there was something that was influencing
[2:23:10] her life
[2:23:13] in a sense that it was so pleasing to
[2:23:16] God
[2:23:19] that what the law will condemned because
[2:23:21] it was honored the Lord it was because
[2:23:23] of the Lord
[2:23:24] that Judah said bring her foot and let
[2:23:27] her be burned that's why the law says
[2:23:29] that even though the law will condemned
[2:23:31] that but it was so pleasing to God that
[2:23:35] he could place her name
[2:23:39] in the genealogy of Jesus Christ
[2:23:42] praise the Lord because God saw that as
[2:23:46] a righteousness
[2:23:50] that exceeded the righteousness of Judah
[2:23:54] even though he was born in the tribe of
[2:23:57] Abraham even though he was circumcised
[2:23:59] on the eighth day he kept all the
[2:24:01] commitment
[2:24:03] God saw an art
[2:24:06] Gentile woman
[2:24:08] amen
[2:24:10] she was not Hungary fall for filthiness
[2:24:15] or for sex what she wanted is to be
[2:24:17] identified with the Seed of Abraham and
[2:24:21] the only way she could be identified is
[2:24:23] to be a possessor of that seed
[2:24:25] that's all she wanted
[2:24:34] righteousness
[2:24:35] that exceed the righteousness
[2:24:38] of the Pharisees
[2:24:41] praise the Lord
[2:24:44] is to be able to grab
[2:24:46] what is in God's mind
[2:24:49] amen
[2:24:51] is to allow the word of God to influence
[2:24:54] our lives sometimes we come on the order
[2:24:57] you know and then we want this to be
[2:24:59] right and we want that to be right it's
[2:25:01] good to to pursue those things amen but
[2:25:04] if it is just the keeping of the Lord
[2:25:07] and there is nothing that is influencing
[2:25:10] us from inside
[2:25:14] are we together
[2:25:20] you're looking first Samuel chapter 24.
[2:25:24] if you want to turn there with me
[2:25:26] let's read a little bit
[2:25:28] because we were trying to look at this
[2:25:30] exceeding righteousness
[2:25:32] praise the Lord
[2:25:54] in first Samuel chapter 24 you will see
[2:25:57] that this was David and Saul
[2:26:01] when Saul was after the life of David
[2:26:03] this was uh the the same where David
[2:26:06] came down there and he got right into
[2:26:09] the mountains and he was able to cut off
[2:26:12] a piece of salt
[2:26:14] cloth
[2:26:15] amen
[2:26:17] praise the Lord
[2:26:19] he was able to cut off the piece of salt
[2:26:21] cloth I know the time is late here I've
[2:26:24] kept you over time
[2:26:26] but but it's important I have but but
[2:26:29] then referring to a little bit of that
[2:26:31] on Friday night
[2:26:33] and uh the Hem of His Garment
[2:26:38] praise the Lord
[2:26:40] there was a reason why David did that if
[2:26:43] you don't understand
[2:26:45] the Hem of His Garment
[2:26:47] you will not appreciate
[2:26:50] while that was done let's let's let's
[2:26:52] let's just get back a little bit
[2:26:55] I just have you for one service today so
[2:26:58] just just bear with me a little bit amen
[2:27:02] if you go to Numbers Chapter 15. we'll
[2:27:05] come back to our story
[2:27:07] but let's go to Numbers Chapter 15.
[2:27:13] Numbers chapter 15 let's read from verse
[2:27:16] let's read verse 37.
[2:27:29] praise the Lord
[2:27:39] I'm on account of a slow stat today
[2:27:46] but that's fine thank you for bearing
[2:27:48] with me
[2:27:51] Numbers chapter 15 if you read verse 37
[2:27:56] be able to let's let's learn some things
[2:27:58] here from the word of the Lord and the
[2:28:00] Lord speak unto Moses saying Speak unto
[2:28:02] the children of Israel and bear them
[2:28:05] that they make
[2:28:07] a French in the border of their garment
[2:28:12] throughout their generation
[2:28:14] that French was a hen
[2:28:18] and you will know the man of authority
[2:28:22] you will know a man or a wealthy man by
[2:28:25] the hand of His Garment
[2:28:30] praise the Lord
[2:28:31] so they were supposed to put a hymn on
[2:28:33] their garment
[2:28:35] and it was supposed to have a blue
[2:28:37] ribbon in it
[2:28:45] throughout their generation that they
[2:28:49] put
[2:28:49] upon the French of the Border
[2:28:52] a ribbon of blue
[2:28:55] and it shall be unto you a French Dia
[2:28:58] may look upon it
[2:29:00] and remember all the Commandments of the
[2:29:05] Lord
[2:29:06] and do them
[2:29:09] and they are yes sickness after
[2:29:12] your own heart
[2:29:15] and your own eyes after which you use to
[2:29:20] go and hurry
[2:29:23] praise the Lord
[2:29:24] amen
[2:29:26] let's say for example they were supposed
[2:29:28] to do this reading
[2:29:30] and in one sense God was saying as you
[2:29:33] walk and you look you you see the the
[2:29:35] Hem of your garment
[2:29:37] you memorize a scripture you keep the
[2:29:40] lord of the Lord God my feet Lord keep
[2:29:42] me
[2:29:43] it was in a way you have to realize that
[2:29:46] they had the leadership of the Holy
[2:29:48] Ghost it was not dwelling in them it was
[2:29:51] a way for them to guard their touch
[2:29:54] it was a way for them to keep their mind
[2:29:56] on the Lord
[2:29:58] but you see as time goes by it becomes a
[2:30:01] culture and now it becomes a faction
[2:30:05] that rich man can make their bigger
[2:30:09] and put different design on it
[2:30:12] but it was something that was kept all
[2:30:16] true
[2:30:18] the lineage of Israel
[2:30:22] praise the Lord
[2:30:23] a French on the border of the agave
[2:30:27] so when a man was a king
[2:30:30] the way his brother is you know it's
[2:30:33] it's almost like when you look at uh in
[2:30:36] the military
[2:30:38] the worst tribes
[2:30:41] and all their stripes are not the same
[2:30:43] the straw that a man's word tells his
[2:30:47] rank
[2:30:53] that was the way it was
[2:30:55] amen
[2:30:57] so it will make you to appreciate the
[2:31:00] scripture
[2:31:02] when David got down there and then he
[2:31:06] caught
[2:31:09] he caught the Bible says it was the hand
[2:31:12] of sore government he caught
[2:31:16] praise the Lord because he needed an
[2:31:18] identity
[2:31:21] are we together
[2:31:25] I'll just stop right here and then go
[2:31:28] into what I was what I've what I want to
[2:31:30] read to you here so let's go back there
[2:31:32] to First Samuel I think I've already
[2:31:34] established my picture in your mind
[2:31:48] first Samuel 24
[2:32:05] now David the Bible says verse 9 and
[2:32:08] David said unto Saul wherefore
[2:32:11] Euro thou men words saying behold David
[2:32:14] seeketh my thy hurt
[2:32:16] behold This Day verse 10 for Psalm 24
[2:32:20] this day Thine Eyes I've seen how the
[2:32:22] Lord have delivered thee today in my
[2:32:26] hands in the cave and some bid me killed
[2:32:31] thee
[2:32:32] but man I spare thee and I said I will
[2:32:37] not put forth my hands against my Lord
[2:32:40] for he is the Lord's anointed
[2:32:44] moreover my father see
[2:32:47] see the skirt of thy Rock so he took the
[2:32:51] piece of the piece of uh that he have
[2:32:54] caught
[2:32:55] to show that because that that was where
[2:32:57] the design was
[2:32:59] if he had just caught any part of the
[2:33:02] Garment it will not really identify with
[2:33:04] the king so he got to cut the where
[2:33:08] where the the Border was
[2:33:12] praise the Lord
[2:33:18] and more all of my father's seed
[2:33:21] the skirt of thy Rob in my hand fall in
[2:33:24] that I cut off the scalp of The Rock
[2:33:27] and kill thee gnat
[2:33:30] nor down and see that there is neither
[2:33:33] evil non-transgression in my hands and I
[2:33:38] have not seen it against thee
[2:33:40] yeah thou
[2:33:42] haunted my soul to take it the Lord
[2:33:45] George between me and thee and the Lord
[2:33:48] Avenged mean of Thee
[2:33:50] but my hands shall not be upon thee
[2:33:54] praise the Lord
[2:33:56] amen
[2:33:57] now if you drop down now and you can
[2:33:59] read the rest of it but drop down to
[2:34:01] verse 17 and he said to them it's all
[2:34:05] said to David thou are more righteous
[2:34:11] than I
[2:34:13] praise the Lord
[2:34:17] a righteousness
[2:34:19] that exceed
[2:34:21] the righteousness of the Pharisees
[2:34:24] because the Pharisees righteousness was
[2:34:27] all in the dudes and done it was all in
[2:34:30] the flesh it was just all in the other
[2:34:32] Suburban called them actors
[2:34:36] but yet David having an opportunity of a
[2:34:39] man that was Haunting his life
[2:34:43] but he has so much regard for God's word
[2:34:48] he said because thou are the Law's
[2:34:51] anointing
[2:34:53] praise the Lord
[2:34:56] amen
[2:34:59] he came so close he came right into the
[2:35:02] camp
[2:35:03] for him to be able to get a hold of a
[2:35:07] sore skirt means that he came he even
[2:35:10] passed the man that were guarding him
[2:35:18] praise the Lord
[2:35:21] thou are more righteous than I
[2:35:25] for thou have reward them in good
[2:35:28] whereas I have rewarded the evil
[2:35:37] praise the Lord
[2:35:40] so you see David
[2:35:42] was honored an inspiration there was
[2:35:44] something that was holding him Beyond
[2:35:47] his own human strain a human mind
[2:35:52] and righteousness that is seed the
[2:35:55] righteousness of the Pharisees
[2:35:58] it is something
[2:36:00] that Christ was going to bring it's not
[2:36:03] something that the Lord
[2:36:05] who have provided
[2:36:07] is something that the Holy Ghost has
[2:36:09] brought on to us
[2:36:11] amen where beyond our strength beyond
[2:36:15] our weaknesses
[2:36:18] we can be fairly in strength but there
[2:36:21] is just something in our heart that is
[2:36:23] longing for more of God
[2:36:27] praise the Lord you're not going to use
[2:36:29] your your failure for excuses
[2:36:33] amen
[2:36:35] you are not going to use your failure
[2:36:37] for excuses
[2:36:39] if you fail God that there's a way out
[2:36:42] amen God has made a provision
[2:36:48] so you're not going to use something oh
[2:36:50] yeah it's in my family or it is my
[2:36:52] family and all that's the reason why the
[2:36:54] new birth is provided
[2:37:01] no flesh will be justified it's in a
[2:37:04] sense that God will take no human
[2:37:06] excuses
[2:37:08] if no flesh will be justified God will
[2:37:11] take no human excuses
[2:37:15] you cannot use somebody else's failure
[2:37:18] to be an excuse why you will not move on
[2:37:21] with God
[2:37:23] you can use somebody else's backsliding
[2:37:26] right
[2:37:27] we are asked to look unto the Lord not
[2:37:30] to look after man the Bible says the
[2:37:33] armor flesh will fail it will always
[2:37:35] fail
[2:37:39] praise the Lord
[2:37:41] you cannot even look at your own failure
[2:37:46] to stop going on with God
[2:37:48] praise the Lord because God is Not
[2:37:51] Looking for your righteousness your
[2:37:53] righteousness is as a filthy wreck he
[2:37:56] wants you to provide yourself let his
[2:37:58] righteousness flow through you and
[2:38:01] that's the thing that bad for you our
[2:38:03] mind
[2:38:04] praise the Lord just like brother
[2:38:06] Branham said he says if you have
[2:38:09] accepted that God was made sin for you
[2:38:12] you must also accept that you have been
[2:38:15] made his very righteousness
[2:38:18] that's what Apostle Paul says
[2:38:22] praise the Lord that's the righteousness
[2:38:24] that is seed
[2:38:26] the righteousness of the Pharisees
[2:38:30] it's so easy to get this Pharisees mine
[2:38:34] praise the Lord
[2:38:36] where we know the court we know
[2:38:38] everything we know what the Bible said
[2:38:40] we know what the scripture says that we
[2:38:42] can even condemn ourselves to hell
[2:38:50] praise the Lord
[2:38:52] David said you see me today that there
[2:38:54] is no evil in me
[2:38:57] because your life was in my hands
[2:39:04] praise the Lord he said because your
[2:39:07] life was in my hands
[2:39:11] Saucy my son I realize
[2:39:14] you are more righteous than I
[2:39:16] there is something that is driving you
[2:39:19] amen
[2:39:22] there is something that is driving you
[2:39:24] there is something that is keeping you
[2:39:25] there is something that is influencing
[2:39:28] your life
[2:39:31] yeah he was anointed about Samir
[2:39:35] to be king
[2:39:39] praise the Lord
[2:39:41] and that is the same thing that is
[2:39:43] driving God's people
[2:39:53] no flesh will be justified
[2:39:56] we get our use our weaknesses
[2:39:59] for an excuse
[2:40:01] we cannot use our family this thing
[2:40:04] running man no God is not going to take
[2:40:06] any excuse from man
[2:40:08] because he has given us the ultimate
[2:40:10] provision right
[2:40:12] praise the Lord
[2:40:14] amen
[2:40:16] if your wrongs in your family comes for
[2:40:18] the New Birth the new bread will cut it
[2:40:19] off
[2:40:24] praise the Lord the new breath will cut
[2:40:26] it off
[2:40:33] All Through the Ages men have always
[2:40:35] always sought to do things for God
[2:40:39] it's so difficult to provide to accept
[2:40:42] the thing that God have freely given to
[2:40:45] us
[2:40:48] amen we always want to provide our
[2:40:52] standard we want to provide our religion
[2:40:54] we want to provide our righteousness
[2:40:58] when none of them will be accepted to
[2:41:00] God
[2:41:06] praise the Lord
[2:41:10] she's more righteous
[2:41:14] then uh brother Brown says something
[2:41:16] here in is the rising of the sun I read
[2:41:19] this and find a place here to close I
[2:41:20] will keep you this entire day
[2:41:24] he says that's what he proves Hallelujah
[2:41:27] that's what is the proof
[2:41:30] he was in only the word
[2:41:33] but he was God
[2:41:36] God himself the Dynamics in the word
[2:41:41] that made the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:41:47] in the grave
[2:41:48] Shake into life and Rise Again
[2:41:52] and rolled away the stone I am he that
[2:41:57] was dead
[2:41:58] so dare Till The Sun said he was dead
[2:42:03] and the moon said he was there because
[2:42:05] they couldn't give their life their
[2:42:07] light the Stars said he was dead all
[2:42:10] nature said he was there
[2:42:13] and now the whole word
[2:42:16] has to recognize that he's alive again
[2:42:22] he was not only the mechanics
[2:42:26] God's word he was the dynamic to prove
[2:42:31] it
[2:42:32] praise the Lord and as he being the
[2:42:36] groom
[2:42:37] the bride has to come forth
[2:42:40] amen
[2:42:42] because it's part of him
[2:42:45] and it can only be the the manifestation
[2:42:49] or the Fulfillment of all
[2:42:53] all the revelation
[2:42:57] let me take that again it can own it it
[2:42:59] can only be the manifestation of
[2:43:03] the fulfilling of all the Revelation any
[2:43:06] order has spoke of the Bride
[2:43:09] it can only manifest if it does
[2:43:12] something different from the groom it is
[2:43:15] in the brain
[2:43:17] because she is flesh of his flesh born
[2:43:22] of his born life of his life
[2:43:26] power of his power
[2:43:28] she is him
[2:43:33] praise the Lord
[2:43:35] she is he
[2:43:39] you know when I was thinking about this
[2:43:41] it just it's just it just inspired me
[2:43:44] there when uh uh
[2:43:47] Judah said she is more righteous than I
[2:43:51] praise the Lord
[2:43:53] I thought about uh uh uh
[2:43:57] a gentile bride
[2:44:00] that is going to receive Christ's word
[2:44:04] to be a flesh of his flesh
[2:44:07] a bone of his bone praise the Lord amen
[2:44:11] we are going to be the expression of
[2:44:13] God's righteousness
[2:44:19] amen the very expression of God's
[2:44:23] righteousness
[2:44:26] Hallelujah you see that's the reason why
[2:44:29] if we measure on our failure we can go
[2:44:33] nowhere with God
[2:44:36] praise the Lord yeah there is it's a
[2:44:39] balance
[2:44:40] amen because unbelief will only handle
[2:44:44] the unbeliever
[2:44:47] glory be to God
[2:44:49] amen if we measure on our
[2:44:51] own yes and just you know make an excuse
[2:44:54] on all of the things in our life we can
[2:44:56] go nowhere with God
[2:44:58] we can we cannot even understand his
[2:45:01] purpose for our life
[2:45:08] praise the Lord
[2:45:15] you see this there are people that are
[2:45:18] using their weakness you know and they
[2:45:21] are not going any father with God and
[2:45:23] they are also people that is making the
[2:45:25] grace of God a disgrace
[2:45:28] praise the Lord hallelujah because the
[2:45:30] thing that I'm saved by grace so I can
[2:45:32] live any out
[2:45:36] no but there is a little bride
[2:45:39] there is a little bride that is trying
[2:45:41] to grab what is in God's mind
[2:45:44] she's keeping herself under the word and
[2:45:47] she's been influenced by the Holy Spirit
[2:45:50] to be able to please God even when it
[2:45:53] does not seems like she's pleasing God
[2:46:00] praise the Lord
[2:46:02] amen
[2:46:05] oh she come forth and she says your
[2:46:08] strength is perfect in my weakness
[2:46:11] the devil tried to discourage her and
[2:46:13] try to beat her down
[2:46:15] but there is something something in her
[2:46:19] that gave her the courage daily to get
[2:46:22] before God and appreciate him for his
[2:46:24] Mercy
[2:46:26] praise the Lord
[2:46:29] Hallelujah
[2:46:32] she's flesh of his flesh bone of his
[2:46:35] bone power of his power
[2:46:39] she is him as a man and a woman I want
[2:46:44] and the woman takes from his side
[2:46:48] she has been taking a spirit a feminine
[2:46:52] Spirit from him
[2:46:54] the flesh from his side May both
[2:46:59] mechanics and Dynamics his wife
[2:47:02] praise the Lord
[2:47:07] the spirit of him and the Flesh of him
[2:47:10] are put together the mechanics and the
[2:47:13] Dynamics
[2:47:14] until the church all the people
[2:47:17] praise the Lord
[2:47:20] so you see that's that's that's the
[2:47:22] expression of God's righteousness
[2:47:25] you know that the Lord connect that's
[2:47:27] why Jesus says I never came to destroy
[2:47:29] it I came to fulfill it
[2:47:32] I came to fulfill what is in the Lord
[2:47:35] the Lord tells you you your your takes a
[2:47:38] woman and sleep with her is adultery I'm
[2:47:41] telling you that if you lost
[2:47:43] in your heart
[2:47:45] praise the Lord
[2:47:47] amen so you see even there in Matthew
[2:47:50] Chapter 5 when Jesus deals with all of
[2:47:53] those things he goes in the heart of man
[2:47:57] why because they all have been the place
[2:48:00] where by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:48:03] by the new birth he will Express his
[2:48:06] righteousness from your heart so it's
[2:48:08] what your heart is Desiring it's not
[2:48:11] what your flesh is living out
[2:48:13] what your heart is Desiring is that a
[2:48:16] desire of God more of God in your heart
[2:48:19] do you have a desire for the Holy Ghost
[2:48:21] do you have a desire to live a life that
[2:48:24] is right
[2:48:28] what is your heart Desiring because out
[2:48:31] of the abundance of our heart
[2:48:33] now only our mouth will speak your life
[2:48:35] will live out
[2:48:43] praise the Lord
[2:48:45] Tama has something in your heart she
[2:48:48] wanted to be identified
[2:48:52] with the lineage of Abraham she knew
[2:48:54] that was a redeeming line
[2:48:57] and God will put a seventh seal right in
[2:49:01] the story of Joseph
[2:49:03] something that will speak of the Messiah
[2:49:08] he will interrupt the scripture
[2:49:13] trying to get our attention
[2:49:18] and I can show you places in the
[2:49:20] scripture where The Parting follows
[2:49:26] praise the Lord
[2:49:29] be on something that Joseph would not
[2:49:31] understand our 17 years all the Bible
[2:49:34] said
[2:49:35] he was sought in Egypt
[2:49:38] but there was a Plan of Redemption
[2:49:39] behind his life
[2:49:42] it kept him as a Young Man In The House
[2:49:45] of Spotify
[2:49:46] that he placed everything in his house
[2:49:49] in Joseph hayen
[2:49:52] do you know that 45 never even believed
[2:49:54] his own wife's story
[2:49:57] he didn't believe it
[2:50:00] because I believe for all of the years
[2:50:02] that Joseph stayed in his house they
[2:50:05] have tested him they have tried to put a
[2:50:07] trap they have tried and Joseph proved
[2:50:10] himself to be a son of Abraham
[2:50:14] why because it was a capital punishment
[2:50:17] if a 45 really believed his wife Joseph
[2:50:20] was going to be Hank
[2:50:24] because he was a Hebrew
[2:50:26] he was going to be Hank
[2:50:32] it was a capital punishment a chief of
[2:50:34] officer
[2:50:39] but fortified house examine this boy
[2:50:41] look at his life and look at his
[2:50:43] testimony that he will rise to the place
[2:50:45] that everything in his house
[2:50:48] he will put in the care of Joseph
[2:50:53] a place of trust
[2:51:00] praise the Lord
[2:51:02] but you see God by the design of the
[2:51:05] Holy Spirit please tell my story
[2:51:09] for us to be able to see the Scarlet
[2:51:12] Street
[2:51:15] and just like that Scarlet Street was
[2:51:17] behind influencing Joseph life in Egypt
[2:51:21] that scholar Street has been influencing
[2:51:23] your life from the day you were born
[2:51:34] that's the reason why there are things
[2:51:36] in your life you will not understand
[2:51:39] praise the Lord
[2:51:41] you say I should have been dead you'll
[2:51:43] see a life
[2:51:48] they're all being robbing himself
[2:51:50] against you just to grab your attention
[2:51:54] praise the Lord
[2:51:58] and if his grace has brought us this
[2:51:59] fine
[2:52:01] are we willing to surround ourselves
[2:52:05] to that great intelligence of God
[2:52:08] that have guarded our life so far
[2:52:11] or are we still struggling with our
[2:52:13] choices our you know our our Ambitions
[2:52:18] and the things that we want to achieve
[2:52:20] and and the way we think our life should
[2:52:23] be
[2:52:25] praise the Lord
[2:52:28] one hour a million brother Brahman says
[2:52:31] there was a million cells egg cells that
[2:52:33] was released from your mother
[2:52:35] yeah the media air cells also blood
[2:52:38] cells from your father
[2:52:40] he said the choice for you to be in life
[2:52:43] there were million exhales
[2:52:47] if there was one egg cells and the blood
[2:52:49] cells that met different from what
[2:52:51] conceive you you will not be alive
[2:52:57] the choice of which air cells will meet
[2:53:00] which blood cells it was God that did
[2:53:03] that choosing
[2:53:05] praise the Lord
[2:53:07] the determination whether it will be a
[2:53:10] male or female it was God
[2:53:15] praise the Lord
[2:53:16] so he make choices for us
[2:53:20] and guided them
[2:53:23] before even we were born
[2:53:26] praise the Lord why can't we trust him
[2:53:31] if he have been so good to us
[2:53:34] and have brought us this far
[2:53:36] there we are 2023 January 1st

[2:54:21] shoulder

[2:54:29] it's not in our choice it's not in our
[2:54:32] religious practices
[2:54:34] is how much we surround ourselves to God
[2:54:40] and says flow through me Holy Spirit

[2:56:48] presence
[2:56:50] [Music]
[2:56:57] if he became sin for us
[2:56:59] [Music]
[2:57:01] that we might be his very righteousness
[2:57:04] [Music]
[2:57:11] and for him to take our place he says
[2:57:13] not my will but your will father
[2:57:16] can we say the same thing to him Lord
[2:57:18] not my will
[2:57:20] but your will
[2:57:25] [Music]
[2:57:28] see the way we understand
[2:57:31] go about the religions of the word
[2:57:34] [Music]
[2:57:37] all the religions of the world
[2:57:40] try to teach us that we have to be good
[2:57:44] we have to do good
[2:57:46] and a way to please God
[2:57:48] [Music]
[2:57:51] but if we realize that
[2:57:54] by the blood
[2:57:57] by the nature that we were born we can
[2:57:59] only do good as much as we can
[2:58:04] we can do good to the ones that do good
[2:58:07] to us
[2:58:09] that's that's the way the human nature
[2:58:11] works
[2:58:14] that's the reason why I saw who said
[2:58:15] David you are more righteous than me
[2:58:18] because I'm seeking to do you evil
[2:58:24] yet you are you go to me
[2:58:31] praise the Lord
[2:58:33] all the religious of the world
[2:58:35] the Buddhists will tell you the same
[2:58:37] thing you have to do good you have to be
[2:58:39] kind but you can just do as much as you
[2:58:42] can
[2:58:42] [Music]
[2:58:51] Jesus never said you have to be good
[2:58:54] the Young Rich ruler came to him and
[2:58:56] said good Master what can I do to
[2:58:59] inherit eternal life
[2:59:02] he never said you should be good he said
[2:59:04] you must be born again
[2:59:06] praise the Lord you must be born again
[2:59:09] because that new birth
[2:59:12] is going to bring a seed in
[2:59:14] righteousness in you
[2:59:17] is going to express in you more than you
[2:59:20] can do where your human strength stop
[2:59:25] were your human strength fails
[2:59:30] God will outpass that
[2:59:37] stand to our feet this afternoon

[3:01:54] Hallelujah
[3:01:56] foreign
[3:01:58] righteousness
[3:02:04] to live through us
[3:02:06] [Music]
[3:02:10] it's not something that we can practice
[3:02:15] it's something beyond our good intention
[3:02:20] is something Beyond
[3:02:22] [Music]
[3:02:24] it's the expression of God
[3:02:28] is the manifestation of the Sons and
[3:02:31] Daughters of God
[3:02:36] they exceed in righteousness
[3:02:39] sometimes God is dealing with us and God
[3:02:42] is using us in a very humble way
[3:02:47] but we always try to look at a one that
[3:02:50] we think is a more righteous man or we
[3:02:53] look at another person
[3:02:55] instead of understanding what God is
[3:02:57] doing in our life and the way he's
[3:02:58] dealing with us
[3:03:00] then we start to
[3:03:02] imitate we start to impersonate the life
[3:03:06] of another person the way they dress the
[3:03:09] way they worship the way they lift their
[3:03:10] hands
[3:03:12] instead of embracing God the way he's
[3:03:15] dealing with you
[3:03:17] when God comes down and reveals
[3:03:21] something to you speak to your heart
[3:03:22] pick up something in your life
[3:03:25] to be able to cherish it and say Lord I
[3:03:28] received your word be with me
[3:03:31] Change Me Lord
[3:03:33] no two men is built the same God don't
[3:03:36] use two men the same way
[3:03:38] God will never deal with two persons in
[3:03:40] the same way
[3:03:41] [Music]
[3:03:53] they are seeing righteousness of God
[3:03:55] it's it's in Simplicity it's receiving
[3:03:59] the word of God it's appreciating what
[3:04:01] God is doing in your life today
[3:04:04] appreciating the level you understand
[3:04:07] God
[3:04:10] you don't have to break into the mystery
[3:04:12] and try to miss mystify things
[3:04:16] accept God in his simplicity
[3:04:29] the Lord is nighty even in the mouth
[3:04:32] if God will believe
[3:04:38] believe in the heart and confess the
[3:04:40] Lord Jesus Christ
[3:04:46] God's exceeding righteousness
[3:04:53] that we can be called The Bride of Jesus
[3:04:55] Christ
[3:04:57] to be able to bring forth the Son of God
[3:04:59] in our life not the Son of God as a baby
[3:05:04] but be the Son of God to your neighbors
[3:05:07] be the Son of God to the Sinners on the
[3:05:10] street
[3:05:12] the son of God
[3:05:14] to The Strangers
[3:05:16] [Music]
[3:05:22] if you see wrong
[3:05:25] corrected out of love
[3:05:28] be the son of God
[3:05:30] [Music]
[3:05:32] exceeding righteousness
[3:05:34] those Pharisees caught that woman in
[3:05:36] adultery
[3:05:38] and a drag her before Jesus
[3:05:41] Jesus Will Express an exceeding
[3:05:44] righteousness
[3:05:47] and he was saying is there any one of
[3:05:49] you here check your heart examine your
[3:05:52] heart
[3:05:54] is there one year
[3:05:57] that is not under the guilt of sin
[3:06:03] he went to the inner part of your heart
[3:06:07] and the Bible said one by one they all
[3:06:09] dropped they are stones
[3:06:11] [Music]
[3:06:12] and when he opened his eyes
[3:06:15] there was none
[3:06:16] [Music]
[3:06:20] he said woman neither do I condemn thee
[3:06:24] neither do I condemn they go and say no
[3:06:27] more that was the exceeding
[3:06:29] righteousness of God
[3:06:30] [Music]
[3:06:34] I call into the Pharisees righteousness
[3:06:36] she must be stoned to death I call him
[3:06:40] to Judah righteousness she must be
[3:06:41] burned
[3:06:43] foreign
[3:06:45] [Music]
[3:06:51] like I've always said you cannot impress
[3:06:53] God
[3:06:55] you can't impress him
[3:06:59] you can only appreciate him you can only
[3:07:01] live a life of appreciation you cannot
[3:07:04] impress God
[3:07:05] [Music]
[3:07:07] don't like anybody putting up a show
[3:07:13] he just want you to make yourself
[3:07:14] available
[3:07:18] foreign
[3:07:24] as we go into the year that is before us
[3:07:29] well I met every one of us
[3:07:33] Place ourselves place our heart on the
[3:07:35] altar
[3:07:37] and say Lord
[3:07:39] that you're exceeding righteousness
[3:07:43] let your exceed in righteousness Lord
[3:07:46] not my will but your will
[3:07:49] not my desire Lord but your desire
[3:07:55] I want to be an expression
[3:07:57] of your exceeding righteousness
[3:07:59] sometimes it gets so hard
[3:08:01] it gets so hard for us to let go
[3:08:06] of our will of our ideas
[3:08:13] and that's some of the things that have
[3:08:15] that is creating a failure
[3:08:18] [Music]
[3:08:20] in the Christian church
[3:08:22] people get so stuck to their old ideas
[3:08:27] they create their own form of religion
[3:08:29] in their mind
[3:08:34] as as long as they wake up in the
[3:08:37] morning and prayed and read their Bible
[3:08:40] but when we get out there then the lord
[3:08:42] gave us a little test we get so
[3:08:44] frustrated we get so angry
[3:08:48] we misrepresent God in the least simple
[3:08:51] test sometimes that comes our way
[3:08:55] we misrepresent God
