foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] I'll do it so this great priest years ago father Kennedy you ought to get his book to recently call him father he's just his brother chinnicky what it was we don't call him his father like that so we find it let me uh he's gonna read the Bible so as you get out there and just through the partial religion the big long Catholic if I want to read the Bible the Holy Spirit to look what I need God's holy ghosts so then notice this that Moses got all the training the class he he knew he was so small so educated so intellectual first nobody he can even teach the Egyptians he's a teacher psychologist he's a teacher the generals what military might love so he's a great man and people fear noses because of his grace his soul was such a scholarship mind he was a relationship a Mania like a polk he was a great felt and he was a a Mighty Man and he knows that he was born to do this and that trained with great Ambitions to do it just like today I don't say that man's training in these schools I don't see that like you're out here in the west now they're going to build a 150 million dollars uh School of Theology see Pentecostal a hot 150 million dollar School for me that should be missionaries in the field man amen amen but whatever what do they do when they come out of there what are they about drinking just did that and then that's how they come out was always have the rest of them and that's the same line see now we find out that when uh Moses in all this training and today with all the training making big Bishops and so forth a great High Ambitions what do we do our Ambitions become just about at what Moses was see God before he could get the man in his hand you are just spinning of his ambition they're the stripping of all this dream he did go out and he delivered he'd kill one Egyptian and he uh and when he did he found out that he was in the wrong he couldn't do that it wasn't that day and God had to take him out into the wilderness into the desert a desert place how these fellows that God got a message for him he takes them into the desert he took Paul to the desert yeah to train to tell him on all this great vision what out into the desert we're out to a certain desert and he stayed there until God fully made no one what to do time he's talking out in the desert catching out there for 40 years and strict him of all this Theology and all his ambition oh what a time that he could look back and see his failure now we deny ought to do the same thing when we see our ambition look at the healing campaign as soon as the Lord did something a few years ago to start restoring healing to the sick and so forth everybody every organization is because it didn't come into their organization they had to get them A Healer and what have we done let's look at it just a moment we are doing the same thing that Moses did we went out and tried so hard to manufacture some kind of America I smelt a disease I got blood in my hand and a manufacturer of Miracles see and what have we got to have a man in such large screens just broke up and become regular Jokers neurology Pentecostal objective back to making organizations and things again through about one Egyptian that's right and we've tried we strain we hate we labored all night long the crab eating soup we had more bison and try to manufacture something soup up something and all these kinds of things and find it to be a total failure we're here going back to this amen right yes sir Christine is the struggles why not just give up that's what you ought to do amen go back and give us what we've done the same thing they did same thing Moses did it doesn't do any good and it's your 40 years he found himself a prisoner to the word of God what do we try to do when the great blessing come out on the manifestation of all these great things that God has told us about how do we must be born again how is receive the Holy Ghost the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and all these things here you see people instead of staying to that word harness to it what do they do that started with their own denominational Theory which is already fails and try to manufacture something to look like the truth oh helpful I better cut off right now see I'm sure you're wise enough to know what I mean see but why look what it's done think of it what have we got tonight but a a nation full of organized people who deny the scriptures of God amen amen who would call the the right of the holy spirit that it was a middle telepathy who would refuse such to come into the church and they wouldn't permit you to mention one word a serpent seed eternal security and a thing that the Holy Spirit has revealed it proved amen what have they got the same thing that Luther had the rest of them see slew an Egyptian what much what was it maybe made some men start stop stealing or maybe live true to his wife well what did you make you know that a church member nothing John Harvard see that's stinking dead man was always any of your 40 fingers too of his success of 40 years of training a snake in addition laying there Walking Dead that's about the way it is a stinking versus church members that knows more about God than a Hot Topic tonight let me tell them about the word of God to say I don't believe that I don't care what you say I don't believe it okay yeah that's an awful thing to have to point back to for all the strains and struggles and everything we got naturally because we're into a big school but then [Music] return back one good Egyptian no doubt but somebody says Moses love us hey you've got no more feeling for the people you was called to somebody that noticed Moses nobody was called for that I didn't know if you lost the feeling of the people nurse her but why don't you all doing this why should I are trying this and why don't you go on with the rest of them Moses is out there getting stripped until he had an experience of the Bernie Bush that declared the word I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I remember myself not the ambition of the people of the desires of the people then what did he become he did not want to face the Egyptians anymore he didn't want to face this thing anymore they become a prisoner yeah but then he become a prisoner of Bernie Bush the mighty Moses was all of his Israelites the bible say that Moses is a mighty man and word or indeed down in Egypt but what what the mighty theologians did in the presence in the burning bush he always confessed his inability amen when he seen the genuine purpose of God he confessed that he was inability to do it again he was trained in all of theology I think again amen Queen Elizabeth School but guess what did he do purify [Music] Lord who am I and I should go get your shoes on Moses I want to talk to you hit yourself down even your shoes you're flat on the ground I want to talk to you couldn't even talk finally are elected prisoner are you elected profit just like this all was elected Moses was elected delivered amen [Music] movie I Am I'll be with you therefore just as you say here I am oh my God he's a prisoner man he goes against his better thinking in order Spears forward charge that's how you go take it over that was your training first of all the more years than what you got in your hand [Music] God just ain't so ridiculous sometimes to the human mind got a stick in his hands Whiskers hanging down 80 years old his wife on you little flabby arms hanging down the stick this is it up boy he has just says the Lord amen [Music] ities I've only got one thing to do the first step right surrender don't think of yourself or something else become a prisoner what would this become a prison confess he couldn't even talk well when God got him in his hands where he can only move well God moves you what he told him the word then he submitted himself to the Lord and the Holy Spirit their God promised Moses to the will of God that's the same thing he's done to fall that's right amen he harnessed Paul little crooked those Tire tastic Jews oh a p-h-e-l-d's wrote All Over Me but he said I'm going to show him what he's going to suffer from the words [Music] as soon as Jesus to him the love of God harnessed him to the word he's going to Bear my name before the Gentile there he went Moses are the god of your fathers I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and of Jacob I remember a promise him and the time of the promises here now through the afflictions of my people I remember my promise and I have come down the horn and shoot you know what the word says now who is you to go down there or is she with power you go down there and deliver my people they just stick in Your Hands there's a witness of course you've seen a miracle done by just like David was a slingshot harnessed himself and he went down finally God had a man that was subject to inquiries to him and he could not move until the word of God moved amen if people just do that today then he was his prisoners with God is always yourself in a bond of love to God just like Paul both of us trained the same way what was his traditional to deliver the children of Israel but military life poetry to take it out of the hands let them freeze by great ecclesiastical force in the world that day great schools of training come up on her dominion and both of them went to the desert come back different man Brothers man exactly right coming for an Olympic there was went to the desert left their homes and went to the desert to find out Lester peoples and everything to find the will of God they see they were trained in one way God changed them to another and they had become a complete prisoner to not act in the way that they wanted to act but acting the way that God wanted them to act he's the same yesterday today and forever have we got another 10 this Saturday my real quick they get to another character I see one before me now his name is Joseph he was an elected son he was a perfect type of Jesus Christ he was born in the prophet he is a prophet also see and now he could see vision and when he's the other little boy he saw a vision of himself sitting on the throne and his brothers died but why he felt like he's a great guy see and all of the bloody God has to do he done the same thing that he did to the rest of them because Moses was a deliverer Paul was to deliver and now Joseph was to deliver he saved his people from the dead what did God have to do James had he been prison amen amen straight to the prison yes sir remember he was told by his brother to an Egyptian and they stoled him to potipher and a piper uh gave him a little bit of Liberty and uh first thing you know that was taken from him and there is set in the prison crying cry crying God had this prison now what is it but all the time I believe he in that prison he could remember that the vision thing because he knew that his gifts come from God and he knews that it was hard to come to pass if we could only keep that in our mind according to the word of God this is the slang says he's going to have a church going to have a people and these things that he promised he's going to do amen and we're living in the town [Music] I want to be shutting with God now that's where I thought about this is being shut in with God nothing else in your holy mood when God says move you only do is stop saying then you're shutting with God now remember you're mistaken he also became a total failure to himself all that he knew all that he understood and everything he become a total failure it didn't work he was put under a situation the whole earth that nobody would listen to and he was a prisoner see he was tucked into a situation that unbelievers would not believe me his ministry this is not a fact the people from their heads they wouldn't pay attention to him in prison what's good for these things you do you might stand to the prison bars and preach to him and walk on down the street see but he can't a prisoner God cat in the pleasure until he is good Hallelujah finally God can't do it in his presence like Paul he came to him and he used the gift that he had given to get him out of there and he brought him from his prisons what did he do as soon as he raised on his prison he was given power Amen brother King his King amen they settled the silence that he was honored he was brought from the prison house and give his power for whatever he says he [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you and when it comes from his prison house and become a prisoner of the word of God that he can only say what God said he is about to say then God moved through here that Moses have power Divine favorites [Music] yeah 56 this mountain be moving Hallelujah he has power to bind Heroes well there was deacons of freshers [Applause] whatever you want to find you everybody's own words his own pleasure yeah and boys are gone Ally oh I just got about three more minutes I keep my words now we find out that he he become a prisoner to God and Moses the same way from a pleasure to his own thinking the present to God and when he come out he had the power of God and when he become Paul when they've all taken of Moses he was surrendered it and script of it he become a prisoner to Christ's word could only move wherever he said Christ he esteemed the reports of Christ greater Treasures of that of Egypt so he wants a prisoner of Christ just like Paula remember all three of them were Prophets yeah see and they had to be fixed of their own thinking in order to become a prisoner to the will and the ways of God now we remember it now that he has power to buy that his own words he had power to lose at his own words he could say I lose you in the name of my place hey man May Joseph his son amen Christ make tears prisoners of love his son amen amen and he gives them power the same thing here Saint John's 14 12. he doesn't believeth on me the Western I do shall he do also even more than initial he do now the prisoner of the Lord of Christ becomes empowered by his King who is Christ amen and very I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you have what you said amen [Music] [Music] ity yet Power Glory notice before he cannot he had to be taken out in shade before he meet his team oh God sometimes take these people out like that it saves a few of their own Wills all kills him if he can't do this what they wanted to do you know what I mean they're not they're not Liberty do what they want to do before they can come into full power and be a loved slave to Christ the Earth should be shaved off and then presented sometimes he takes them to the deserts to do that to shave them all and then bring them out the anointed ones before fill the purpose that he's ordained them to be you know what I mean Brothers we're at the end time remember all other times what he's done he's always had to take a man and make him a prisoner to you for say he's owned he had to forsake everything that he knows forget all these trainees everything in order to know the will of God and to follow God he can't follow anything that man's got to do and God the same time it's too contrary one to another you can't be going east and west at the same time you can't be going uh right left at the same time you can't be doing right and we're always at the same time you can't be falling man in God's at the same time no sir you're either following God or falling man now then if you are following God and have submitted yourself to God then you become a prisoner to that dog to that word to that will no matter what anything else that you become a pleasure to it listen we're at the end time [Music] [Music] thank you [Music]
