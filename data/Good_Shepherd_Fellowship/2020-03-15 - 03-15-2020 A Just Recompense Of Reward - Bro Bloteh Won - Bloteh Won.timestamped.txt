[30:35] [Music]
[30:45] [Music]
[31:10] praise the Lord before we get into the
[31:13] preaching of the word Amen was thinking
[31:17] a little bit I said you were afraid of
[31:18] the worst praise the Lord
[31:21] but you know I'm learning to to to know
[31:27] some things as we as we keep learning
[31:30] all the time there's a testimony and I
[31:34] was listening to in the week and it's a
[31:37] tremendous testimony you know as the
[31:42] Word of God teaches us music song is the
[31:46] next thing to the Word of God that a
[31:49] human soul can feed on and and it's
[31:53] because God taught music in us music is
[31:57] not coming from outside music is coming
[32:00] from inside many of the times we
[32:03] struggle to express it because we we are
[32:08] so filled with this thing that you know
[32:10] the sound that is coming from outside
[32:13] sometimes we get distracted by other
[32:15] people voices sometimes we get
[32:17] intimidated by other people voices and
[32:19] all of their Bermuda is actually from
[32:23] the human soul science prove it there
[32:26] was a man that had a drowning accident
[32:30] yeah I think he want to you want to save
[32:33] a try that was draining or he fell into
[32:37] the lake I was just listening to that
[32:38] couple of days ago and it's interesting
[32:41] how some of those things you are not
[32:44] able to follow the DJ because you are
[32:46] just attracted by the resort and
[32:51] actually when he got out of the water
[32:55] from that drowning accident that he had
[32:58] he did he developed a syndrome and his
[33:02] syndrome was he could hear the sound and
[33:09] play the piano he never went to music
[33:13] school the effect of that drowning
[33:19] created music in him you can just start
[33:22] singing he would get to the piano and
[33:24] play never went to music school
[33:30] the second proof the medical science
[33:35] prove it and mainly Harvey if you if you
[33:39] have time check it up she's uh she's a
[33:43] death musician she don't yell like you
[33:50] like every one of us or like some of us
[34:00] praise the Lord but maybe she lost her
[34:07] hearing she was doing music from four
[34:11] years old and she'll also hearing I
[34:14] think around eleven years also and and I
[34:20] mean everything went bad she she
[34:23] couldn't hear anything but over the
[34:25] years she said one of her inspiration
[34:31] came from she was coming down the stairs
[34:34] and she fell and right on the floor I
[34:41] talked to a struck her you could stay
[34:43] right down here and feel sorry for
[34:45] yourself and just hitting or as you
[34:51] could try to get up so from that inner
[34:56] inspiration she wrote a song called try
[35:01] and all the songs that she sings she
[35:05] write her own songs
[35:07] she writes her own music and from that
[35:16] inspiration of try I want to play the
[35:19] video for you this morning but I mean
[35:21] I'm just I'm just I just want to hold
[35:24] myself together and because of all the
[35:27] things that is going through my mind but
[35:29] from that from that inspiration that
[35:32] came from in her she decided to try
[35:36] music again so how do mainly listening
[35:41] to music she when she singing she don't
[35:44] wear shoes she feed the music through
[35:49] the floor
[35:50] she put her bare feet on the ground when
[35:54] the musicians are playing she feed the
[35:56] music to her music is not sound music
[36:00] it's a feeling you can hear you have
[36:08] voices and you sit there and sing as if
[36:12] to say you don't have life but you know
[36:14] I realize that it don't take the music
[36:18] if you really want to enjoy the music
[36:20] you got to be happy it's not a music
[36:22] that makes you happy you got to have an
[36:25] inner happiness in you for you to be
[36:29] able to express it we can bring all the
[36:32] jazz band we can bring them we can
[36:34] change this thing if you don't have joy
[36:37] in you we can blast this place you will
[36:39] just be dead and poor as you are praise
[36:50] the Lord
[36:52] we're living in a world where people are
[36:55] looking for people to make them happy
[36:58] but let me tell you it's happy people
[37:02] that attracts happy people praise the
[37:06] Lord if you are looking for somebody to
[37:08] make you happy you will Ramin side the
[37:11] rest of your life because even if the
[37:15] most happiest person come around you you
[37:17] will contaminate their happiness with
[37:20] the zionists that is sitting down in you
[37:22] and everybody will be sorry
[37:30] praise the Lord
[37:32] anyway will greet you in the name of the
[37:34] Lord Jesus amen and worship is very
[37:46] important part of the service very very
[37:48] important it can it can make the
[37:53] preacher cranky like I feel like this
[37:55] morning or it can make the preacher fly
[37:59] through the road praise the Lord
[38:03] but we are glad to be in the house of
[38:07] the Lord and you know you know the
[38:12] people have got some victory you know
[38:16] when when you see how they are singing
[38:19] in the air rejoicing and worshiping the
[38:22] Lord and you know you can know that the
[38:26] camp has been wounded when you see how
[38:29] the people are groaning and you know
[38:33] India prays to the Lord but we trust
[38:37] that the Lord will bring us some victory
[38:39] amen
[38:40] praise the Lord the scripture says the
[38:46] joy of the Lord is our strength amen
[38:50] the joy of the Lord is our strength
[38:54] so we pray that he will give us some joy
[38:59] pills
[39:02] so we can be able to get some strain to
[39:05] face the day you know we are in we are
[39:09] in socially age you think about the
[39:13] little group of people that we are
[39:15] trying to be happy in this whole world
[39:19] working coronavirus is making everybody
[39:22] side and scaring the spirit of fear is
[39:26] upon the world that your your joy is
[39:30] being so suppressed by the fear demon
[39:33] and and I mean we trying to sing as if
[39:37] to say oh we're just waking up from bed
[39:39] is because of the spirit of the age I
[39:42] mean social fear is splegg in the word
[39:45] that I mean your little strain of joy
[39:51] has just been suppressed by their spirit
[39:53] and sometimes you just ask yourself why
[39:59] am I feeling like this you know
[40:02] sometimes it's not really you it's just
[40:04] the atmosphere that is all around us
[40:06] that we have to deal with praise the
[40:09] Lord and then knowing that we must not
[40:13] give in to it
[40:14] Amen we must not give in to fear we must
[40:18] not give in to you know demon
[40:22] suppression we must be able to fight our
[40:24] way through by sinking by lifting our
[40:27] hands by clapping our hands for the Lord

[44:42] Wednesday now we were speaking a little
[44:44] better and we talked about how God is in
[44:47] the interruption of our lives and and
[44:51] then yesterday when we were having our
[44:53] young people meeting you know our
[44:59] session of subject that we were dealing
[45:02] with as as the brothers we heard our our
[45:08] our speaker saying the same thing to us
[45:12] about how God came into how he could see
[45:18] God in the interruption of things that
[45:21] took place in his life this morning I
[45:29] woke up around 3 a.m. and I woke up to
[45:38] to this stop there was something also we
[45:41] were talking about yesterday that that
[45:45] that turn out so beautiful and and what
[45:53] what the thought was actually we were we
[45:56] were trying to look at
[46:02] in some sense because our subject it's
[46:08] not for everybody so I'm not going to
[46:10] tell everybody what we were talking
[46:11] about
[46:12] so trying to paraphrase it so you would
[46:16] not really know what we were talking
[46:18] about if you want to know you have to
[46:22] come to the meeting I mean so but what
[46:27] actually is we were we were trying to
[46:29] look at a coal equal we were trying to
[46:33] look at you know the the blessing of you
[46:40] know the blessing and and in the
[46:43] protection things that God poured into
[46:45] you into marriage relationship things
[46:51] that God put into there now you mean
[46:55] your mind we just think that we were
[46:56] talking about marriage world us okay and
[46:58] if you make that conclusion in your mind
[47:00] you will not be wrong you will not be
[47:02] right anyway so praise the Lord
[47:06] but yearís here is what struck me in
[47:09] yesterday and as as we were talking I
[47:12] went thinking about there because I've
[47:15] always thought about there but it came
[47:17] to me in a different way
[47:18] and and this will help you to bring you
[47:21] to where we want to talk about this
[47:22] morning and marriage and divorce is the
[47:29] faith sorry I never did a good job this
[47:31] morning I had I had two separate notes
[47:34] and I was trying to merge them together
[47:36] so and and and I mean a lot of other
[47:39] things were happening around me by
[47:41] marriage and their vasa the prophet of
[47:44] god said this and we want to we want to
[47:46] read it to you now it is after the
[47:49] beginning now there is a double coveting
[47:53] first it was just a coveting adenine Eve
[47:57] was co-equal one man one woman now that
[48:01] were co-equal and the Bible says God
[48:04] made man Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 in
[48:07] His image male and female are we
[48:11] together so they work all equal
[48:15] amen but when the four came in Genesis
[48:20] chapter 3 because like Paul says Eve was
[48:26] deceived so she fell from that Paul
[48:30] equalness with man Genesis chapter 3
[48:34] verse 15 and the scripture says and your
[48:36] husband will have the rule over you but
[48:39] here is he here is it now you grab this
[48:42] now yes yes it here that the work that
[48:47] was given to the man because you will
[48:51] see this very same thing Adam fell from
[48:54] the image of God as being the son of God
[48:57] with Dominion and power amen and and and
[49:01] the power of the spoken word he fell
[49:03] from there and Jesus came to redeem him
[49:07] to bring him back to that call'
[49:09] equalness that's what the work of
[49:12] redemption is for god is bringing us
[49:15] back to work adam fell from so the work
[49:19] that is given to the man under the
[49:21] covenant of marriage is to be able to
[49:24] lift the woman up to that call equal
[49:27] position praise the Lord and a way to do
[49:34] it like Paul says in efficient is by
[49:36] love and a woman the way to be able to
[49:40] to get to that place is by submission
[49:44] now we're living in a world that that
[49:48] you hear over and over the equality and
[49:53] pay equality and job equality the word
[49:56] is trying to produce that out of God's
[50:02] Lord amen
[50:06] they are trying to produce that they are
[50:10] trying to get a word to that place of
[50:13] offer of edom condition without God's
[50:17] law it will now work that way
[50:22] praise the Lord
[50:24] many in homes and marriages I suffering
[50:29] because we're trying to achieve that out
[50:32] of God's principle and it's not going to
[50:36] work that way
[50:37] praise the Lord now but as I was
[50:41] thinking on that I woke up this morning
[50:44] I started studying a little bit on coal
[50:47] equalness and and and my mom was driving
[50:50] today and I asked myself where I'm not
[50:52] I'm not teaching they're preaching on
[50:54] the marriage seminar this morning
[50:56] pretty soon the young people would think
[50:58] I'm trying to expose their secret so so
[51:05] so I then I went I went in and then I
[51:08] started playing the message I was
[51:10] listening to listening to a subject and
[51:16] it just became so it came so powerful
[51:20] now you think about it now because I was
[51:22] thinking about you know just like I said
[51:26] in the beginning what we said you know
[51:28] God is in the interruption that that the
[51:31] interruption was on my mind I thought
[51:34] that's what I was going to go into but
[51:37] then I'm looking into cold equalness and
[51:40] then something also came up that's what
[51:42] I want to share with you but this
[51:44] morning I want to talk on it just
[51:48] recompense of reward I mean it just
[51:54] recompense of reward and pretty soon we
[51:57] will see the the the coal equalness and
[52:00] and what I was studying there the word
[52:03] equity came out a stranger the word
[52:07] equity came out because you know I've
[52:16] been really trying to understand this
[52:18] word equity without with all of the you
[52:21] know things that is happening but that's
[52:27] what we want to look at this this
[52:29] morning if the lord help us we may not
[52:31] be able to get through it I just saw
[52:33] we'll try to lay the foundation but I
[52:36] just reckon pains
[52:38] of reward amen
[52:42] I was also looking at the word Richard
[52:46] retribution we also have to do with
[52:50] recompense but let me step like this and
[52:55] says the principle of God God's
[53:00] principle girl's principle is like
[53:07] gravity effect praise the Lord
[53:14] God's law that he made just like gravity
[53:19] is also God's Lord but I'm saying in a
[53:24] way so we can be able to understand it
[53:26] that no matter where your faith level is
[53:30] your understanding is your level of
[53:33] education whether they believe God or
[53:35] they don't believe God or their ideas or
[53:38] their I mean whatever it is we all are
[53:41] affected by gravity amen the law of God
[53:48] affect every one of us that's why have
[53:51] our feet on the ground
[53:52] that's what is keeping you in your seat
[53:56] now if it only takes the Word of God for
[54:00] God's law to affect your life some
[54:03] people will be sitting and some people
[54:05] will be floating praise the Lord
[54:09] but because no matter what your choice
[54:14] is no matter what your state of life is
[54:17] the Lord of God still has an effect on
[54:21] us that is the reason why or every one
[54:25] of us our feet is glued to the floor
[54:27] nobody floating this morning amen
[54:32] so the principle of God's law the way to
[54:36] be able to understand it like you you
[54:38] take the lord of reproduction your
[54:41] whatsoever a man soul is that's what he
[54:44] will read now that is not only applied
[54:47] to a crease that is apply
[54:49] everywhere of our life because that is
[54:50] God's law just like the way gravity is
[54:54] affecting us that we are holding to the
[54:56] ground praise the Lord
[54:58] no matter what is happening you know you
[55:03] know the the plaque is in the air but
[55:06] yet instead gravity is having its effect
[55:10] upon our lives that is the way the laws
[55:17] the principle of God Lord is praise the
[55:23] Lord
[55:27] thinking about just recompense I was
[55:31] trying to find one of the one of the
[55:36] easier way to be able to explain it
[55:38] Wednesday night I spoke a little bit
[55:41] about how the how the age or the ages we
[55:51] we receive the benefit from the ages
[55:54] that were before us good and also bad
[55:59] and that is the end that is what we want
[56:02] to look at this morning praise the Lord
[56:09] because you can have spiritual growth
[56:20] without sacrifice you can have spiritual
[56:27] growth you can you can grow any things
[56:30] of God you can grow in understanding
[56:33] your relationship with God without
[56:36] sacrifice praise the Lord
[56:40] you can enjoy the the benefit the
[56:46] realness of God without sacrifice praise
[56:52] the Lord
[56:52] I was praying this morning I said Lord
[57:01] you got to help me because I'm caught up
[57:04] between these two thoughts but I want
[57:07] the grace of God to be able to help us
[57:09] so we can be able to get something out
[57:11] of it
[57:12] praise the Lord now so you will see that
[57:16] a lot of God in the Old Testament as the
[57:21] scripture would teach us you know the
[57:24] Lord that came out like an eye for an
[57:28] eye you knowing a tooth for a tooth in
[57:31] all of the earth you will realize that
[57:34] it is the Lord of God this whole thing
[57:40] about co-equal nets in equity is their
[57:44] term the measure of wrong must be equal
[57:53] to the measure of punishment amen
[58:01] the measure of wrong now let's go back
[58:05] to Genesis I just think I broke the ice
[58:11] because I saw myself getting through
[58:14] your spirit right now let's go back to
[58:17] Genesis think about what wrong did Adam
[58:25] and Eve did they are wrong the perfect
[58:31] atmosphere and perfect creation that
[58:38] they were dwelling in never had to go to
[58:42] work I mean an immersion and I mean you
[58:47] don't have to train them a lot before
[58:49] you could play with them they were right
[58:51] there to play with what wrong you think
[58:58] about it that when you talk about cold
[59:02] equalness you talk about equity
[59:06] it must be there the same amount of
[59:11] wrong is equal to the amount of
[59:18] punishment if you flip the coin around
[59:23] also you will realize that in God who
[59:32] blessed man and God will be merciful let
[59:36] me bring another story to you
[59:37] they teeth on the cross just before his
[59:42] last birth before he would give up the
[59:46] ghost all the wrong he has done I mean
[59:49] that man he was facing a capital
[59:51] punishment he was a notorious criminal
[59:55] but what right did he do for him to have
[1:00:03] the equal payment that this thing you
[1:00:07] would be with me in paradise equity it
[1:00:14] has to be equal it have to be equal that
[1:00:20] a man have to do something right to be
[1:00:25] able to inherit the kingdom of God over
[1:00:29] all the wrong that he have done and a
[1:00:34] man had to have done something wrong so
[1:00:38] wrong so bad that he could lose the
[1:00:42] privilege of speaking to the Wayne what
[1:00:49] was the wrong if it was just an easy
[1:00:55] wrong of offending God like a brother
[1:01:00] said it was just to say God I'm sorry it
[1:01:06] was just to see Lord I'm sorry Eve to
[1:01:11] Adam
[1:01:12] I mean tell Adam and I'm sorry that I
[1:01:14] did this and Adam go back to God and
[1:01:16] said god I'm sorry
[1:01:18] but you well you will realize that
[1:01:22] whatever was done
[1:01:25] hi Sasha wait and what was that
[1:01:33] just one word broke him out of God's
[1:01:38] Word just a lie that was told young
[1:01:44] people are you yelling me this morning
[1:01:48] praise the Lord
[1:01:51] just a lie that was told just unbelief
[1:02:04] that enter into the human spirit
[1:02:16] you will see why God closed the Bible he
[1:02:21] said if any man were our one word to
[1:02:24] this or take one word out of it 20 nose
[1:02:32] back to Genesis the seriousness that God
[1:02:37] put to his word the seriousness the he
[1:02:43] put to his word praise the Lord
[1:02:53] are we together but just recompense of
[1:03:04] reward therefore we ought to gave the
[1:03:14] most earnest heed amen
[1:03:19] to the things which we have heard we
[1:03:24] have to remind ourselves where the word
[1:03:29] the word is turning in the things that
[1:03:32] are happening we are now like children

[1:03:40] prophecy of God's Word we know that we
[1:03:44] are coming right down to this time how
[1:03:47] we have to take the most earnest heed to
[1:03:52] the things that we have heard how we

[1:04:01] our bed and starts to remind ourself
[1:04:11] how we need to take the most earnest he
[1:04:15] to the things that we have heard least
[1:04:19] at any time that you slip away praise
[1:04:24] praise the Lord
[1:04:25] you know that that word slipped away
[1:04:28] reality does not mean that you and I
[1:04:31] remember it but you will not for the
[1:04:34] same value it will not have no weight to
[1:04:38] you
[1:04:40] amen it will not have no no value to you

[1:04:48] word that is able to conscious you of
[1:04:54] the owl that we are living in are we

[1:05:18] I will firm about God's Word that there
[1:05:22] is one thing that you need to do to get
[1:05:30] it just recompense there is one thing
[1:05:35] that you need to do to get God's favor
[1:05:46] to please God
[1:05:48] amen scripture says with our faith no
[1:05:55] man can please God but read a fifth
[1:05:58] chapter in a book of Hebrew Paul he
[1:06:02] brought our things in a walk with God
[1:06:06] amen no one or big God he caught
[1:06:12] something there was one thing he did in
[1:06:14] his life all the law of seeing that we
[1:06:19] all were born we were all born in sin
[1:06:22] ship that in inhibiter going down
[1:06:24] here to help but those men found
[1:06:27] something that they did and it brought
[1:06:30] them to a just recompense praise the
[1:06:36] Lord I'm I'm kind of for working with

[1:07:26] business word you know the the the

[1:07:50] mean after one two years then you expect
[1:07:53] to get equity out of the house you know
[1:07:56] you need to get to a certain level of
[1:08:00] commitment praise the Lord Amen the just
[1:08:10] recompense of reward so we see here
[1:08:18] through the Word of God that
[1:08:27] back to the beginning when God express
[1:08:33] his thought of bringing for his children
[1:08:36] let us make man in our image
[1:08:40] the scripture says male and female
[1:08:44] created he them you know for a long time
[1:08:48] I've had one subject in my mind that I
[1:08:51] was I was looking for an opportunity to
[1:08:54] preach on a wedding and that subject
[1:09:02] that I was going to preach if I had the
[1:09:05] opportunity I was going to speak on rape
[1:09:09] era I be out of from from the rape of a
[1:09:15] man God brought a woman and in the way I
[1:09:19] was going to title that message was rest
[1:09:23] in brokenness a woman is a man rest in
[1:09:34] brokenness praise the Lord because the
[1:09:42] man is broken
[1:09:45] amen he's broken God had to break his
[1:09:49] side with hamon break the rapes and take
[1:09:55] the woman out and she came out whole so
[1:10:01] he's broken and she's hold he had to be
[1:10:05] broken for her to behold praise the Lord
[1:10:11] Amen and she has she has she has a lot
[1:10:17] of abilities a lot of abilities we mean
[1:10:21] can multitask more than maintain we mean
[1:10:25] are very hard workers whether you want
[1:10:28] to believe your net but it's proving
[1:10:31] there be a hard workers
[1:10:34] more than a man can praise the Lord
[1:10:38] it's because of the way that God made
[1:10:41] him the way that God made him the way a
[1:10:45] woman is made with her brain works I
[1:10:49] mean she can be cooking talking on the
[1:10:52] phone pressing at the same time in order
[1:10:55] there I don't want to get into death
[1:10:59] amen but
[1:11:13] social strength social strength if if
[1:11:17] you know if things would just be kept in
[1:11:20] their place amen
[1:11:23] and we will just understand this
[1:11:26] beautiful picture of what God is doing
[1:11:30] it's now what it's not about what you
[1:11:32] are doing or what you think it's all
[1:11:35] about what God is doing praise the Lord
[1:11:39] and with all the ability and all that
[1:11:47] strength and all that smartness here God
[1:11:52] keep pointing to her you came out of
[1:11:55] that brokenness and you must submit to
[1:11:59] that brokenness
[1:12:00] you must take all of that strength that
[1:12:02] you have back to that brokenness now
[1:12:06] that's word it's difficult because in
[1:12:12] this present world she's assuming that
[1:12:15] she has all this ability by herself amen
[1:12:23] and there was just something in the
[1:12:25] man's mind
[1:12:26] when when when he becomes the man by
[1:12:31] marriage that he's demanding it
[1:12:38] praise the Lord how do I find myself to
[1:12:43] this
[1:12:45] to this place but God right there in the
[1:12:53] beginning created them male and female
[1:12:57] in his image when he express himself in
[1:13:03] the form of his creation he expressed
[1:13:09] himself male and female that was a
[1:13:11] spiritual being amen
[1:13:15] cool equal right there I mean in that
[1:13:25] way the word the same you see that is
[1:13:34] the reason why the seven of God some of
[1:13:38] his sayings are so powerful and then
[1:13:41] sometimes people I think it's in a way
[1:13:45] of analyzing you know God seven or the
[1:13:48] Prophet as notice it's because I mean
[1:13:51] the word of the law comes to the Prophet
[1:13:54] take this same a chain is only as strong
[1:13:57] and its weak
[1:14:01] you see because Adam was already broken
[1:14:05] so he never needed to be broken again
[1:14:09] what needed to be broken was the
[1:14:12] strength that came out of his brokenness
[1:14:17] when the enemy got to Eve it was easy
[1:14:21] for Adam to fall because he was already
[1:14:23] broken or something got a revelation of
[1:14:31] death when he went to those Philistines
[1:14:33] he says out of the strong comes the
[1:14:38] sweet and those Philistines were
[1:14:41] confused what is he talking about
[1:14:42] I mean he have just killed a lion and
[1:14:50] then on his return he was so hungry
[1:14:53] interstate and right there in that in
[1:14:56] the score of the
[1:14:57] the airline I mean he pulled the Lion
[1:14:59] apart and writing in the score of faith
[1:15:01] that the bees have have settled down
[1:15:05] there and put someone in there and that
[1:15:07] was the thing they had sistene at him in
[1:15:10] that Johnny above the strong praise the
[1:15:20] Lord my goodness may the Lord help us
[1:15:28] but it just recompense God rewarded
[1:15:33] himself when he expressed himself let us
[1:15:38] make man in our image he rewarded
[1:15:41] himself by having both the male and the
[1:15:44] female called equal at the same place
[1:15:52] praise the Lord because that's the Lord
[1:15:56] of God that's the Lord of just
[1:16:00] recompense therefore a man to be
[1:16:05] rewarded with sufficiently for for a man
[1:16:08] to be rewarded with eternal life there
[1:16:11] is something that's supposed to be done
[1:16:13] you you think about an eternal life for
[1:16:16] you to have eternal life
[1:16:18] there is something that's supposed to be
[1:16:20] done they are equivalent to eternal life
[1:16:23] now you tell me what could you do in
[1:16:26] time to be equal with eternal life what
[1:16:30] could you do what could you do in time
[1:16:34] what could you achieve in time even if
[1:16:37] you have from the day of creation to the
[1:16:40] end of creation to live what could you
[1:16:42] achieve in time that is the reason why
[1:16:44] the Lamb how to write your name in the
[1:16:47] Lamb book of life from the foundation of
[1:16:50] the world
[1:16:52] praise the Lord and all you have to do
[1:16:56] is to just recognize say all you have to
[1:16:58] do it so you can't believe it
[1:17:02] when you recognize it and believe it you
[1:17:05] come to the equivalent or having eternal
[1:17:07] life
[1:17:13] praise Allah why are we together amen
[1:17:20] do you realize there Joseph was sold
[1:17:25] into slavery went down there as a young
[1:17:29] 15 year old boy so innocent yeah I mean
[1:17:33] he's just so trouble can't understand
[1:17:35] all of these things that is happening in
[1:17:36] the RAI his life
[1:17:37] what did Joseph do what did he do it
[1:17:42] won't sense for him to have gone through
[1:17:44] out of there

[1:17:48] him to come out of there

[1:19:09] have happened
[1:19:10] Joseph was up he was a Hebrew and the
[1:19:14] people knew because he had to learn the
[1:19:16] language they knew that he was not from
[1:19:18] Egypt no doubt they hated him for his
[1:19:22] nationality the scripture did not
[1:19:23] recorded that they were other half hard
[1:19:26] things he went true but there was one
[1:19:28] thing they won't think young people that
[1:19:32] you would do that was thinner before God
[1:19:38] there is one thing that you would do out
[1:19:42] of your innocent heart out of what you
[1:19:47] have heard and what you have learned
[1:19:50] there was something you would do that
[1:19:52] would please God so much that he would
[1:19:56] decide to bless you in your schooling
[1:19:58] decide to bless you with a good job
[1:20:00] beside Oh bless your future just because
[1:20:04] you did something called
[1:20:08] with all the troubles and other things
[1:20:11] that he had I believe for Potiphar and
[1:20:13] an Egypt into trust J Joseph with his
[1:20:17] house he might have put money on a
[1:20:19] counter he might have tried to amend
[1:20:22] just try to find evil in this board in
[1:20:25] every way but the scripture did not
[1:20:29] record it none of the ad what
[1:20:33] scripture recorded was the temptation he
[1:20:39] had with Potiphar's wife praise the Lord
[1:20:46] and see how the Bible describing the
[1:20:51] Bible said when Joseph was caught in the
[1:20:54] hour of temptation he never said no you
[1:20:58] are not my wife in and III mean the
[1:21:04] thing there was that attracted heaven to
[1:21:10] that teenager was when he told that
[1:21:15] woman about his God praise the Lord
[1:21:23] now I know I'm not thinking about your
[1:21:25] husband I'm not afraid of your husband
[1:21:29] I'm not afraid of what the other man in
[1:21:31] the compound was saying whether that the
[1:21:34] thing that I'm troubled about here is
[1:21:36] that this is an evil against my god I'm
[1:21:45] noticing God in the time of his trial
[1:21:53] being conscious of God nobody was there
[1:22:02] the house was quiet praise the Lord the
[1:22:10] house was quiet he was there alone and
[1:22:14] I'm telling you he could have done evil
[1:22:17] it would slip under the rod and nobody
[1:22:20] would know about it beside the one with
[1:22:27] the just recompense beside that reward
[1:22:35] justly
[1:22:41] and we together I'm not making sense of
[1:22:44] what I'm talking about what I'm talking
[1:22:47] about
[1:22:50] amen
[1:22:56] the reward of blessing should be equal
[1:23:07] to the obedience praise the Lord and you
[1:23:14] see the evil of our church what gospel
[1:23:19] and prosperity gospel when they talk
[1:23:23] about blessing and you will be blessed
[1:23:25] and you will prosper they don't talk
[1:23:28] about your obedience to the Word of God
[1:23:31] they talk about how you can get me my
[1:23:34] next new car
[1:23:37] how the man of God needs to be I mean
[1:23:41] you just need to flower me with your
[1:23:43] money you know and God will bless you
[1:23:51] praise the Lord
[1:23:54] now they are not talking about a just
[1:23:57] recompense amen
[1:24:02] they are ruling the house of the people
[1:24:05] into a temporary a gambling it's just
[1:24:12] like a man that goes through a slot
[1:24:14] machine he takes his high-end money and
[1:24:16] Troy in the machine in a spray that you
[1:24:18] become a villa near when his house rain
[1:24:24] is now pay his phone bill is not paid he
[1:24:29] takes all of that money through into the
[1:24:32] slot machine to turn it around in aspect
[1:24:34] to become a middle name yes that's the
[1:24:39] way prosperity gospel has turned the
[1:24:42] people to be they have nothing to do
[1:24:46] with the just recompense you have to
[1:24:51] realize that the just recompense is
[1:24:54] to warn towards the one that is just and
[1:24:57] there is only one God are we together
[1:25:05] praise the Lord that thing there little
[1:25:14] young Joseph there
[1:25:18] hey please God so much that carry him to
[1:25:22] the dungeon was not a problem
[1:25:25] praise the Lord you know you you just
[1:25:29] think about it in his mind he's true for
[1:25:32] God Jehovah God I won't defy myself
[1:25:38] because of the God of my father's here
[1:25:43] said she told out on him and then and
[1:25:46] now he's thrown in praising praise the
[1:25:54] Lord

[1:25:59] we throw about the heart of this young
[1:26:01] boy what have a dog he been a human
[1:26:08] equal think well maybe if I would have
[1:26:10] agreed to her happy in the prison well
[1:26:16] you see he did what was right
[1:26:18] heaven stamp it already no matter that
[1:26:21] thoughts of confusion I went in his mind
[1:26:24] that down for Tots their own claim
[1:26:26] thought his decision at that moment
[1:26:28] please God pray sir
[1:26:42] but just record things you can have
[1:26:49] spiritual growth without sacrifice amen
[1:26:56] WebM says that's why we're not getting
[1:26:58] nothing from the service because we
[1:27:00] don't want to sacrifice praise the Lord
[1:27:05] Sunday school is becoming too burdensome
[1:27:07] for people I mean it looks like we come
[1:27:10] and spend a lot of time but you won't
[1:27:12] mind spending eight hours at work or
[1:27:15] even spending more than they are doing
[1:27:16] nothing praise the Lord as long as we
[1:27:23] can get here before the Sun service

[1:27:28] are on time you are not on time amen you
[1:27:34] are not on time you are just becoming
[1:27:38] your own pleaser you are just becoming
[1:27:41] self worshipper God is better so come to
[1:27:46] the house of God pray before the service
[1:27:51] that's the sacrifice that we make for a
[1:27:54] good service that's why we put into a
[1:27:59] good service what are the Wednesday
[1:28:04] night or the Sun and imma make no
[1:28:06] different to a one with a heart of
[1:28:08] expectation I want to see God coming on
[1:28:11] the scene no one are we sit back and we
[1:28:17] just criticize we put the service on the
[1:28:19] scale what it was a good service on that
[1:28:23] because you're not even prepared you not
[1:28:24] pray up praise the Lord
[1:28:32] we're not prayed up

[1:28:58] there chapter the first one talks about
[1:29:03] the see Tyrion amen
[1:29:07] a man that Jesus commended Jesus
[1:29:13] commended his attitude this man he was a
[1:29:19] Gentile this man he was in the best
[1:29:22] place of his life praise the Lord
[1:29:26] the scripture says this was his seven it
[1:29:29] was not even his son so for a matter of
[1:29:32] fat he could have choose not to care
[1:29:34] because he had a lot of sevens amen
[1:29:39] he could have choose not to care but you
[1:29:50] see that those are the things that
[1:29:51] attract good for him to even please to
[1:29:56] put those things in the scripture there
[1:29:59] were a lot of things that happen in that
[1:30:01] day but just that attitude of the man
[1:30:04] please God that the Holy Spirit had to
[1:30:11] compare look and compare the writers to
[1:30:14] put that story in the book its attitude
[1:30:19] please God he says I'm a man of
[1:30:25] authority and no one Authority is praise
[1:30:30] the Lord Amen we're talking about just
[1:30:36] recompense this was a man that Jesus
[1:30:42] said you're seven that very moment Jesus
[1:30:45] speak he went back in the Acts and he
[1:30:50] said where it was about eleven o'clock
[1:30:52] he says
[1:30:53] that's right that was it that time he
[1:30:55] spoke he got a just recompense because
[1:31:02] he did something that brought him to
[1:31:05] that equal level forget his Resort at
[1:31:09] the same time praise the Lord
[1:31:20] are we together and what he did being a
[1:31:34] Gentile being a man of authority you re
[1:31:40] right there in the same chapter 7 when
[1:31:43] you go down you will see another
[1:31:46] displayed of Simon this one was a Jew he
[1:31:51] was a Pharisees he sat in his house and
[1:31:55] he invited Jesus to his house this man
[1:31:59] was a man of authority at this
[1:32:02] particular time the Roman was ruling
[1:32:04] over the Jews a man of authority having
[1:32:09] men honor his control he left his house
[1:32:12] he went to find Jesus there acted to you
[1:32:18] of living his house making effort to go
[1:32:20] and found Jesus let a Pharisee sitting
[1:32:23] right there with white garment on him
[1:32:26] his my fellow city proud spirit giving
[1:32:32] Jesus an invitation for him to come to
[1:32:35] his house just to ridicule him and his
[1:32:39] Gentile having an attitude and man of
[1:32:42] authority he says no you said I hear
[1:32:45] myself going I'm not sending a letter
[1:32:47] I'm not sending anybody I'm going there
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:56] Authority we want power we want spoken
[1:32:59] word but are we ready to submit
[1:33:02] ourselves
[1:33:03] I was ready to submit ourself obedience
[1:33:07] to the simpliest Inc read your Bible and
[1:33:11] pray obedience to the simpliest thing be
[1:33:14] the church on time we want Authority we
[1:33:20] want the devil to recognize our voice
[1:33:22] when we speak praise the Lord
[1:33:29] are we together amen
[1:33:33] you see God or all of the power that is
[1:33:38] that is in the woman that came out of
[1:33:41] that brokenness girl see in summation
[1:33:47] that's how she gets power that's how her
[1:33:51] power is displayed in submission it is
[1:33:54] the same thing of the church that's how
[1:33:56] the church power when we submit our self
[1:33:58] to the word when we obey the where we do
[1:34:00] what the word says not being arrogant in
[1:34:03] our spirit I think that we have right to
[1:34:09] anything we are just saved by grace
[1:34:16] praise the Lord he went out he saw Jesus
[1:34:25] he submitted himself he submitted
[1:34:30] himself he humble himself he never went
[1:34:33] with title he never went with anything
[1:34:38] praise the Lord
[1:34:42] just like I said this was his seven it
[1:34:46] was not his son he grew up here less but
[1:34:51] with the attitude that this is a human
[1:34:53] just like me we don't have to go to the
[1:34:56] same church he don't have to believe the
[1:34:58] message he said he will be if he needs
[1:35:01] help why not happy
[1:35:09] that attitude Jesus say I have now seen
[1:35:13] such a thing I have not seen such a
[1:35:16] faith that a man of your level your
[1:35:21] caliber will come in humble himself
[1:35:24] young people praise the Lord
[1:35:34] love the Lord with all of your heart out
[1:35:39] of your mind out of your strength
[1:35:45] praise the Lord give your heart to the
[1:35:50] things of God give you a strength to the
[1:35:52] things of God
[1:35:54] give your mind to the things of God
[1:36:09] just record things equal you want you
[1:36:16] know what I realized as I was stating
[1:36:18] this let me find a place to close here
[1:36:22] just like you look at the word equity
[1:36:26] when you look at the word iniquity
[1:36:33] iniquity is the same as equity but it
[1:36:38] means not enough equity praise the Lord
[1:36:58] it means that we have been taught and
[1:37:02] know from the scripture that iniquity is
[1:37:07] norine that is not right and you are
[1:37:12] doing it
[1:37:15] that's iniquity praise the Lord
[1:37:19] so in another sense it means that you
[1:37:23] don't have enough equity to what you
[1:37:26] know what you know is up here and your
[1:37:31] level is down here because of what you
[1:37:33] are doing praise the Lord
[1:37:46] amen
[1:37:57] just like I said I'm trying to find a
[1:37:59] place to close here so I'm trying to
[1:38:02] jump over some of mine my notes here but
[1:38:10] as I was looking at that this morning I
[1:38:12] mean it just kind of a hit me praise the
[1:38:16] Lord
[1:38:19] you know it kind of hit me because the
[1:38:24] thing about it is is data this is God's
[1:38:28] law also the scripture says the Lamb of
[1:38:33] God was slain from the foundation of the
[1:38:35] world
[1:38:36] amen so God Genesis were looking at
[1:38:42] because the beginning is the foundation
[1:38:44] and God in His Lord
[1:38:49] something had to die for something to
[1:38:53] live
[1:38:56] praise the Lord
[1:38:58] it's in his law something had to die for
[1:39:04] something to live praise the Lord
[1:39:10] amen and that was the thing that pleased
[1:39:19] God with abl sacrifice because he caught
[1:39:22] it it mean a please God with every
[1:39:27] sacrifice because he caught the Lord of
[1:39:30] God so he sacrificed and lamb and God
[1:39:39] was pleased in the scripture says he got
[1:39:42] a just recompense that his voice cry out
[1:39:48] of the earth
[1:39:51] he was counted as righteous because he
[1:39:56] caught that Lord amen
[1:40:01] we have a vowel and society violence is
[1:40:09] living because something had to die
[1:40:14] righteousness had to be killed
[1:40:17] divorce is living breathing jumping up
[1:40:22] and rejoicing why because people have
[1:40:24] laid the standard down they had killed
[1:40:27] God principle something have to die for
[1:40:31] something to live disobedience to
[1:40:42] parents and all of these things violence
[1:40:45] in the mind of young people it's living
[1:40:48] it's all over the place why like if like
[1:40:56] a preacher said he said they have
[1:40:58] forsaken the Almighty God for the mighty
[1:41:01] dollars thinking that getting the child
[1:41:11] the next iPhone we ease the attention
[1:41:14] down it would take the after station
[1:41:16] away from them and you're working and
[1:41:18] want to catch the children above all the
[1:41:21] new things and everything they laid down
[1:41:23] the principle of godliness and praying
[1:41:25] in their home and and and being in
[1:41:28] church they kill all of those things in
[1:41:31] their life can you make violent strong
[1:41:37] you make evil to rain because something
[1:41:41] have to die for something to live
[1:41:49] it's a lot of God how would you get it
[1:42:01] just record please
[1:42:10] praise the Lord the young rich ruler
[1:42:12] came to Jesus and said will master
[1:42:15] what can I do since all of these things
[1:42:19] I have done from the days of my youth
[1:42:20] I've been in church amen Jesus told him
[1:42:31] if you want the recompense of eternal
[1:42:35] life sacrifice sacrifice
[1:42:44] amen because something have to die for
[1:42:49] something to live for a victorious
[1:42:59] prayer life the joy of the law to live
[1:43:01] in your life something have to die you
[1:43:06] have to kill something you have to work
[1:43:11] on temper you have to work on bitterness
[1:43:13] you have to work I mean you have to kill
[1:43:16] those things wash them from your life
[1:43:17] for joy and happiness and a smiley face
[1:43:21] to come something just like I said I can
[1:43:34] get through this because there there are
[1:43:36] some things yeah that I want us to look
[1:43:38] into you know that we don't we don't
[1:43:43] take we take for granted but just like
[1:43:48] taking looking at iniquity you know
[1:43:51] things there we just we give ourselves
[1:43:54] reasons to do that we must not be doing
[1:44:00] with the Spirit of God in our hearts and
[1:44:03] it's still small voice speaking to us
[1:44:06] and warning us
[1:44:14] we think if I was several reason to do
[1:44:17] things and we are expecting for God to
[1:44:22] reward us yes he will because he gave
[1:44:27] the just recompense
[1:44:34] but you see afar I love this example
[1:44:48] someone gave this example if I take a
[1:44:55] dollar and give it to to brother Joseph
[1:45:01] he works you know and give him a dollar
[1:45:06] well he would take it for me
[1:45:14] not really because he don't have a
[1:45:16] dollar he would take it from him because
[1:45:22] you know of what he thinks of me
[1:45:27] praise the Lord of what he thinks of me
[1:45:36] and another person will also you know
[1:45:42] what what do I want to do with a dollar
[1:45:46] praise the Lord
[1:45:48] and you see that is the way it is is is
[1:45:55] is is holy God in content praise the
[1:46:04] Lord
[1:46:05] the way we take the Word of God amen
[1:46:13] you'll find people they gave them seven
[1:46:16] or that was an Old Testament scripture
[1:46:18] that has the Old Testament thing we are
[1:46:20] on a grace I mean they gave himself all
[1:46:23] of this reason why they must not live a
[1:46:25] holy centerfire life they must not get
[1:46:28] himself into decency give themself all
[1:46:33] of the reason why there must not be any
[1:46:35] church or I have to pay my bills I have
[1:46:36] to work in I mean you give yourself all
[1:46:39] of this reason it all goes back to how
[1:46:45] much the Word of God means to you how
[1:46:52] much the commandment of God means to you
[1:47:03] praise the Lord amen how much the
[1:47:11] commandment of God means to you you know
[1:47:17] it's I mean itself it's a it's all we
[1:47:21] think because we him on the way we are
[1:47:27] may we equate to we quick to idolize
[1:47:33] people and we also quick to make them a
[1:47:38] devil its quick to idolize them and we
[1:47:45] very quick to make them a devil you know
[1:47:52] but you think about it God will give us
[1:47:58] grace and we have four runners who have
[1:48:03] people like our parents you know God
[1:48:08] would give us grace for us to come in
[1:48:09] contact with people you know that are
[1:48:12] older than us they have been serving God
[1:48:15] even before some of us were born
[1:48:24] and sometimes we don't we don't we don't
[1:48:29] we don't we don't learn we'll make use
[1:48:33] of the resources that God give us that's
[1:48:37] the reason why he gave us a body with
[1:48:39] two hands and ten fingers and he gave us
[1:48:42] ears and all of these things are part of
[1:48:44] the body for us to benefit from praise
[1:48:51] the Lord you young people young couples
[1:49:05] we are living in challenging times amen
[1:49:11] living in challenging times the future
[1:49:15] is getting darker getting confusing the
[1:49:22] only hope we have is this hope that we
[1:49:24] hold in our heart that he promised never
[1:49:28] to leave us never to forsake us that he
[1:49:31] will be with us we hold their hope in
[1:49:33] our hearts praise the Lord
[1:49:47] I mean until God can be able to relay to
[1:49:55] you what you have done that pleases him
[1:50:02] found something to do find something
[1:50:11] that you can enjoy doing for the Lord
[1:50:16] even if it is just enjoying being in
[1:50:20] church praise the Lord because the
[1:50:30] scripture says he reward them that
[1:50:33] diligently seek Him
[1:50:36] he is a rewarder of those that
[1:50:38] diligently seek Him and he gave just
[1:50:43] recompense praise the Lord
[1:50:51] and I would leave you like this and what
[1:51:00] is the Holy Ghost give me for now in the
[1:51:02] Old Testament when the baby was born the
[1:51:06] wash to see how it behaves
[1:51:10] then the father being a great
[1:51:13] businessman but this time maybe in his
[1:51:18] 40s or 50 year in half the time to teach
[1:51:21] his baby himself in them days they
[1:51:24] didn't have public schools as they have
[1:51:27] now so they got what they call a tutor
[1:51:30] or a razor a school teacher and this
[1:51:35] school teacher was the best he could
[1:51:38] find so that he did be truthful and tell
[1:51:43] the father the truth about it and then
[1:51:47] when this ball got to a certain age say
[1:51:51] he was mention if that boy was just a
[1:51:54] renegade no good drink here for the
[1:51:57] father business all he thought about was
[1:51:59] filthy and running with women drinking
[1:52:03] gambling hurts riding that board will
[1:52:08] always be a son but he was never placed
[1:52:12] in position which means he was never
[1:52:16] trusted to have hers to all his father
[1:52:24] huh but if he was a good boy and he was
[1:52:30] about the father's business
[1:52:32] praise Lord amen net net net not an i7
[1:52:38] not not trying to behave good when eyes
[1:52:42] are on him but he was good I mean he was
[1:52:47] trying to do something get up and face
[1:52:49] his bed get up and face his own bed

[1:53:08] what's that in a coat oh okay because
[1:53:12] I'm looking for it I'm trying to see
[1:53:15] where I read it it but if he was a good
[1:53:19] boy and he was about the father's
[1:53:21] business and he proved to be right then
[1:53:25] they had a ceremony he didn't know about
[1:53:33] it he didn't know when I mean he just
[1:53:36] growing up with an interest amen
[1:53:55] they took the bar out into the street in
[1:53:58] and and and put a rope on him and they
[1:54:04] set him up on the scaffold so there the
[1:54:08] city could see they made a feast and a
[1:54:12] Jubilee you know Jesus made it seem so
[1:54:15] beautiful in the story of the prodigal
[1:54:17] son I close right here and it's so easy
[1:54:22] it's so easy for us to make the story of
[1:54:26] the prodigal son
[1:54:27] me and you praise the Lord this guy that
[1:54:34] I mean that means serving the Lord and
[1:54:36] and be doing right I mean he's the he's
[1:54:39] the one I've been in the house this guy
[1:54:41] the bachelor and came back he's the
[1:54:43] prodigal son but you see it was it's all
[1:54:46] the story of redemption
[1:54:47] remember there is a part of you that
[1:54:50] I've always been before the father Jesus
[1:54:53] says they're angels
[1:54:55] is always before the Father beholding
[1:54:57] his face that is the older son the
[1:55:04] younger one is that part of you that was
[1:55:06] born in sin shipler in iniquity come to
[1:55:09] the word speaking lies so in you holds
[1:55:16] the mystery of the prodigal son
[1:55:21] yes amazing grace will not sound sweet
[1:55:25] in your ears for Amazing Grace will
[1:55:27] sound sweet in your ears you must say I
[1:55:30] once was lost but now I'm found
[1:55:35] amen
[1:55:37] so what happened is when grace found you
[1:55:41] and make you to know that you are a son
[1:55:43] and you have a representation before the
[1:55:45] Father and bring you to the place where
[1:55:50] now you are taking interest to behave as
[1:55:53] a song live like a son then God can
[1:55:59] trust us and he can place us
[1:56:09] you think about it you think about it
[1:56:21] the t-phone the cross found the right
[1:56:23] word to say Amen
[1:56:29] Joseph in the house of Potiphar on the
[1:56:32] right were to say just recompense
[1:56:45] and you hear people even in the room of
[1:56:49] the church that's not fair
[1:56:52] that's not fair what is not fair do you
[1:56:55] know what fair is do you know really
[1:56:59] what is fair praise the Lord
[1:57:09] what could have been fair was for God so
[1:57:11] just wept out of the whole thing but it
[1:57:16] was still not fair to him praise the
[1:57:21] Lord it was not fair to him because he
[1:57:24] had this great plan of redemption in his
[1:57:26] mind so let's start worrying about what
[1:57:34] is fair and what is not fair that's not
[1:57:39] loving God I see for an increased desire
[1:57:45] to do what is right saying god I leave
[1:57:51] myself down on the altar
[1:57:53] if there's anything you mean that is not
[1:57:57] of equity get it out those things that
[1:58:08] I'm allowing that I know I'm now
[1:58:10] supposed to do musicians you can come
[1:58:17] forth I'm trying to stop myself and I
[1:58:22] keep finding myself going and if I don't
[1:58:25] do it I will
[1:58:26] we'll keep you year-long longer than we
[1:58:29] want to
[1:58:35] praise the Lord you know the idea where
[1:58:40] some people think you know they I just
[1:58:43] put seven people that needs to be in
[1:58:45] church just for the church to keep going
[1:58:46] on every one of you needs to be interred
[1:58:48] every time there is a service but it
[1:58:52] just does some choose to to to sacrifice
[1:58:59] in other things that is hard to give
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:28] [Music]
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:43] guarding his greatness he had to take
[1:59:47] the form of falling elements to come and
[1:59:54] redeem us and bring us back to that
[1:59:56] place of co-equal Ness because we are we
[2:00:01] are his attributes we are sons and
[2:00:03] daughters if we were just had that grace
[2:00:08] in revelation to know that the way up is
[2:00:12] down and all we actually do is to just
[2:00:18] help lift someone up help encourage
[2:00:22] someone help empower someone
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:32] it's not trying to find a big me and a
[2:00:35] little you but it's we all coming up
[2:00:40] growing up together to be sons and
[2:00:44] daughters of God sons and daughters of
[2:00:46] God
[2:00:47] that's the highest calling more than a
[2:00:49] preacher
[2:00:54] [Music]
[2:01:04] you
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:17] you just think about it how you won at
[2:01:22] one wrong choice
[2:01:23] [Music]
[2:01:28] one wrong choice
[2:01:30] [Music]
[2:01:41] and making a choice to do the right
[2:01:44] thing making a choice to see the right
[2:01:46] thing give Harry white house sounds back
[2:01:55] [Music]
[2:02:15] I can't help but think about many hobby
[2:02:21] that young lady I told you about in her
[2:02:29] in her music she wrote called just try
[2:02:33] there's a line there she says I mean I
[2:02:39] listened to that just the morning I just
[2:02:41] wept she said who do I have to blame for
[2:02:49] myself because the only thing that can
[2:02:53] handle me is myself see if God can just
[2:03:02] help us to get ourselves in the right
[2:03:04] mindset just in the right mindset
[2:03:10] [Music]
[2:03:14] some of you have seen the video of
[2:03:18] pastor Nick he's an Australian passed a
[2:03:20] bond with our lives how that boy at nine
[2:03:23] years or try to commit suicide I think
[2:03:26] now or eleven years old because he just
[2:03:28] hated himself you know thinking about
[2:03:30] how he's going to lay he don't have a
[2:03:32] legs he can be like other boys but you
[2:03:35] see if if we can learn to face our fear
[2:03:38] and don't make other people your fear
[2:03:41] don't make them your problem you are
[2:03:42] your own problem
[2:03:44] [Music]
[2:03:49] because God has been so good to us if we
[2:03:56] just think about his goodness above all
[2:04:00] our negative thoughts and negative
[2:04:02] feelings and just be able to embrace
[2:04:12] that goodness embrace that mercy and say
[2:04:19] Lord you have been so good to me it's
[2:04:23] not just a word as music it's not just a
[2:04:27] word music it's a feeling it's a melody
[2:04:29] that goes through your body that's what
[2:04:33] people can sing and cry people can sing
[2:04:37] and prophesy people can sing and travel
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:49] yes my car Lord I live it up
[2:04:58] calm and queer
[2:05:03] this thirsty of my soul

[2:05:46] ah man queen this desire of my
[2:06:01] rat of heaven feed me till I want to yes
[2:06:14] my cup fill it up and make me many of us
[2:06:29] are just so bored with fear effort of
[2:06:35] what people would say they're fed up
[2:06:36] doing wrong and fret up and we just
[2:06:39] bought of ourself with fear
[2:06:49] and all fear will do your fear will just
[2:06:54] limit you from saying God it was
[2:06:58] limiting you from seeing the
[2:06:59] possibilities that are before you
[2:07:04] [Music]
[2:07:09] and because so fear we have to reduce
[2:07:14] ourselves to how people want us to live
[2:07:16] and reduce ourselves to how people what
[2:07:20] what I want us to do but God has not
[2:07:27] given us the spirit of fear
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:48] young people just like we said yesterday
[2:07:51] your calling is a son of God
[2:07:55] it's a daughter of God and when we learn
[2:08:01] to put our calling above our ambitions
[2:08:05] if we learn to put our calling above
[2:08:08] whatever we want to beat in and whatever
[2:08:11] we want to be and knowing that is the
[2:08:16] greatest thing that we can we can be a
[2:08:19] son of God a daughter of God and Titan
[2:08:24] and it starts to take joy in the fact
[2:08:27] that I know I'm a son of God and I know
[2:08:32] I'm a daughter of God and being proud of
[2:08:40] it
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:09:04] Heavenly Father Lord and sometimes when
[2:09:10] we are caught between this line of
[2:09:12] thoughts trying or God to make a picture
