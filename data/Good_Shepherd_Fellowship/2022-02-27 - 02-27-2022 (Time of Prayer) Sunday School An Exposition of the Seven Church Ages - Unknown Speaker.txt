========================================

[Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] though they did not worship according to truth word like judas they didn't go all the way see how judas was chosen of god he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the mysteries he had a ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in jesus name but when the showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to pentecost to receive the spirit of god he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost judas failed multitudes fail right there and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the book of life in order to further clarify this removal of a name from the book of life we ought to extend our thoughts to israel in the days of moses exodus 32 30-34 and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the lord per adventure i shall make an atonement for your sins and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou wilt forgive their sins and if not plot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them it is more than evident that names have been and will be removed from the book of life their time shall be no more in this particular place it was because of idolatry even as when dan and ephraim lost their rights as tribes for worshiping the golden calves all who worship the idols had their names removed from the book of life when israel rejected the leadership of god in the pillar of fire and turned to worship the golden calves their names were removed from the book of life exodus 32 33 whosoever has sinned against me him will i blot out of my book if such turning to idols demands the penalty of the removal of names from the book of life then most assuredly israel's rejection of jesus christ as messiah would demand as severe a penalty this is exactly so in psalms 69 which sets forth the humiliation of jesus it says in verses 21 through 28 they gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink let their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake pour out thy indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tents for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous when the jews rejected jesus there was a literal turning away of god from them to the gentiles acts 13 46-48 then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldst be for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed this is not to suggest that there will be no more names from the tribes of israel remaining in the book of life for many of these but not multitudes through the principle of election will be in the gentile church age and come into the body of jesus christ showing that their names did indeed remain in the book of life also as we will show according to the fifth seal multitudes of martyred jews will be given white robes and eternal life by the lord also the hundred and forty four thousand will be sealed at his coming proving that their names were not deleted either but it is even as most accurately set forth in psalm 69 that it is the wicked or unrighteous rejecters of christ and the destroyers of his people whose names are removed as israel chosen people of god in majority forfeited their rights in the book of life by rejecting jesus so the majority of the gentile church will also come into condemnation with the resultant removal of their names from the book of life by rejecting the word and thereby entering into the world ecumenical movement which is the image erected onto the beast there is another point to see here in the great white throne judgment there will be a separation of people the book of life will be opened and another book will be opened matthew 25 31-46 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was unhungered and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee and hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took me in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was unhungered and you gave me no meat i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee and hungered or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of the least of these ye did it not unto me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal revelation 20 11-15 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire there will be both the righteous and the unrighteous in this judgment it says so these righteous will not be the bride for the bride sits with him in judgment first corinthians 6 2-3 do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne see the bride is with him in the throne as she is to judge the world she has to be sitting in the judgment with him that is exactly what daniel saw daniel 7 9-10 i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened see it is the same scene for the thousand thousands who are ministering to him are the bride for who ministers to the husband but the wife the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the judgment there is no other place that they can come up for there are but two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is a resurrection unto judgment the ones who qualify for the first resurrection the bride are not in the judgment john 5 24 verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life that is the believer is already the recipient of eternal life which he has in his possession now and shall not come into condemnation shall not come into the judgment is what it really says but is passed permanently from death unto life but notice carefully jesus must have yet another group in mind who had a certain resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at the resurrection not having previously received it as a member of the bride john 5 28-29 marvel not at this for the hour is coming into which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now we all know that john 5 28-29 is not the rapture for only the dead in christ will arise from the graves at that time along with the living bride who still is on the earth first thessalonians 4 16-17 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord but it says in john 5 28-29 that all are going to come forth from the grave this is the very same resurrection that is spoken of in revelation 20 11-15 wherein the dead were brought before the lord and judged according to their works and all whose names were not in the book of life were then cast into the lake of fire we now face the question as to why they should be given eternal life at the judgment since the epistles seem to conclusively point out that one must possess the spirit of christ or perish though it seems thus we must not discredit the words of jesus who most pointedly sets forth that there are some found in the book of life who will either receive eternal life before the general resurrection or after it paul does not evade this truth for he most clearly says in philippians 3 11 if by any means i might attain to the resurrection of the dead now this statement is most peculiar we all know that we are all going to be in a resurrection whether we want to be or not all will be resurrected so paul could hardly be saying if by any means i might attain to a resurrection of the dead the truth of the matter is he is not saying that the literal reading is if by any means i might attain to the out resurrection from among the dead this is not the attaining to the general or second resurrection but attaining to the first resurrection of which is said blessed and holy is he who hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death that is at the end of the thousand years when all the rest of the dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death now we do not need to guess about those who in the second resurrection are given life we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they have been kind and good to the brethren those who are raised and cast into the lake of fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the brethren since this is the word of god we simply accept it there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact to further clarify notice specifically the words of matthew 25 31-46 it does not say that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time white throne judgment the sheep are in his fold they heard his voice word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the judgment but these do not have eternal life and they are in the judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his brethren they are not his brethren that would make them joint heirs with jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they share no throne etc with him their names must have been in the book of life and not removed now because of their love of the people of god they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of god perhaps like nicodemus and gamaliel they stood for the children in a time of trouble if this seems to smack of restoration watch carefully now for the wicked are not restored but turned into the lake of fire the names of many of those destroyed were in the book of life also but they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of god who were the living manifested word living epistles for their day now let us be very clear here these are not nations being judged and going into the millennium because they have harbored and helped the jews that is very clear because of the conclusion of these verses and these the wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment like a fire but the righteous into everlasting life there is no record of two judgments set where the wicked are cast into the lake of fire only the beast and false prophet are judged at the end of the great tribulation no this is the white throne judgment and they are judged according to what is written in the books it is the second resurrection that the souls under the altar as set forth in the fifth seal revelation 6 9-11 are given white robes and of course eternal life or there would be no point of white robes and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true thus thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now note particularly that none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony to jesus they were not like antipas who was slain for holding fast his name these are not born again ones with eternal life as their possession they come up in the resurrection and receive life because of their stand on the word and notice how these are crying out for vengeance they cannot be bride material the bride turns the cheek and cries forgive them father they know not what they do these are jews they have to be because they are in the fifth seal and it is in the fourth seal that the gentile bride is gone in the rapture so these jews aren't born of his spirit they don't even believe that jesus is the messiah but as they were blinded by god for the gentile's sake god gave them eternal life on the grounds that though they could not come to him yet they were truly faithful to all the word they knew and died for it as multitudes died under hitler stalin etc and will yet die it is the second resurrection wherein the five foolish virgins come up notice that they were virgins they did not have the holy spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wise who had oil became a part of that bride but these people being a separated god loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the lord will come up at the end of time they will miss the millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed all these people had their names in the book of life and their names remained but whose names did not remain those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the lake of fire now let us go another step but before we do let us review our case thus far first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of god stands in election it was purposed in himself it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was for known and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her romans 4 8 blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members was written in a section of the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as are spoken of in matthew 25. in this class also are those who do not worship the beast or become involved in the antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life thirdly there are the borderline christians such as we saw in israel coming out of egypt these had their names in the book of life and their works written in the books these having failed to obey god and being void of the spirit though even the signs and wonders were amongst them will have their names removed from the book of life amongst this group will be the ones like judas who though entirely void of the spirit but are religious will have manifestation in their lives and though on the books were not the elected in him such also as balaam will be in that group fourth and finally are the ones whose names have never been or will ever be written on the books such are found in revelation 13 8 and revelation 17 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is jesus said that a certain group would accept one who came in his own name that one is the antichrist and that is exactly what it says of them in revelation thirteen eight and seventeen eight these were ordained of god but not unto election and with this group is such that are as pharaoh it says of him even for this same purpose have i raised thee up vessels of wrath fitted for destruction romans 9 17 and 22 none of these would be placed on the records of life i am not saying that there is no record of them no doubt there is some kind of a record of them but not in the records of life their purpose of existence has been dealt with slightly in the rest of this book but we can add two more scriptures proverbs 16 4 the lord hath made the wicked for the day of evil job 21 30 the wicked is reserved for the day of destruction they shall be brought forth in the day of wrath [Music] you
