to them that believe yes as we cry as the man who had the epileptic child Lord I believe help thou my unbelief we thank thee for thy great power thy great revelation of thyself to us in this last days it makes our heart most happy and joyful to know that we have come in contact with the Living God who vindicates it right back in physical material evidences as he did in the days gone by and as he has promised for this day we're so grateful to thee our God this dark day where no one seems to know which way to go we're so glad that we found the safety zone yes the retreat now bless us tonight Lord as we speak of Thy word and the promises that's given to us may we nurture them in our hearts cherish them with reverence and Obey them with real Godly discipline for we asked it in Jesus name amen who did that you guilty I was getting on the manager said if he took a love offering for me I appreciate it God knows then but I never come from that thank you may the Lord bless you I'll do everything I can I'll put it right in foreign missions so I'll know it'll go to the kingdom of God and if the Lord willing I'll take it myself over to the lands to bring the same gospel that you've been set and listened to this week that I know it'll be done in the way that you believe it the Lord help me to do it I am very grateful for the great attendance this week and for all you people it's hooked up tonight again with the um the wires of the telephone [Music] and we're grateful to each and every one of you Billy said to me this morning he said Daddy if you would have come with me this morning earlier right after daylight and stand out year around in these places and watch mothers feeding their babies in the car them poor people setting that rain waiting for the doors to open you see what a hypocrite I'd be if I told you anything but the truth I'd really be a foul person sometimes I have to hurt but it's not because and I want to it's because it's just not me that's hurting it's truth that hurts but I believe that's the reason you come because I'm deadly sincere with you and do all I can to help you the Lord help each and every one of you and now I want to thank the people for their fine cooperation the people of the city here also who gave us let us have the reading of this Schoolhouse this uh Auditorium in the gym and I want to thank the officials if you're here and also I want to thank Tristan Colvin which is a custodian here or his fine cooperation and helping us to get this and being with us each night we thank the Jeffersonville Police Force or coming up here and watching with a real cheap cause I think about two dollars an hour at the police were put up your own special duty to park the cars you'll see that there was no nothing happened and everything was all right we're grateful to the people for that and to the um the old soul the engineer here on the the board I've noticed him and all it's affiliated with this we are certainly grateful to you I thank each and every one of you for the gifts Billy just brought me this afternoon a gift several of them and boxes candy and so forth and one of them was the Beatitudes with a picture of Christ worked in it it was a Sermon on the Mount it certainly was beautiful I certainly thank you and so many things I don't know how to thank you for it then also for your your sponsoring financing the meeting we certainly do appreciate it with all of our heart the Lord bless each one of you richly Billy said there was many people he had been asking for private interviews during the time and many asked and had little babies to be dedicated or how I want to do that but you see when I come this time it's so urgent I have to stay right all the time and study this word in prayer on the count of bringing these messages see they're not they're they're extraordinary to us because it's finding the will of God and then speaking of things and all that has to meet together and asking God just which one to open up now the Lord willing we'll be back again soon as soon as we can find a day I made a emotion or said something about Easter I better check that because I think I've got a schedule in California along about that time so that may be wrong however when we return again to the Tabernacle we'll send you a card and uh the church and and give you the the date and time then I'll maybe at that time again I haven't put any time to praying for the sake we haven't had one service that we brought the people up and prayed for them we've been sending them out and our Brethren here has been preaching brotherly Vale and brother these other brothers has been preaching and praying for the sick and doing the water baptism baptizing rather and letting me stay alone with the word we thank these men they've done a gallant job there's so many friends here I'd like to meet I look down see John and Earl and there's Dr Lee Vale one of the managers of the campaign brother Roy borders them man I haven't even got I haven't even no more than shook their hand I haven't had a chance to I think of my friends from Kentucky and around in here and Minister friends how I would like to shake their hands brother Blair I noticed him here the other day and many of those men that I I love and they've been to several meetings I've never even as much as shook their hand I I'm trying it isn't because I don't want to do that it's because I haven't the time to do it and I just to hurry dedicating the babies sure my own son my little grandson was supposed to be dedicated to this meeting I haven't had time to do it little David I'm Grandpa twice now so Mr May if he sure tonight give me that team look like we'll have to use it pretty soon and um I told Billy I said the Bible did say multiply and replenish the Earth but the whole burden wasn't given to you and his grandsons are appearing fast and so remember my daughter-in-law was Barren to begin with she could not have no children and one day leaving the meeting the Lord spoke ten minutes at lost you will bear son the Lord has bless you your female trouble is gone little Paul was born nine months later two months before this baby come on the scene I was sitting eating breakfast one morning at the table and lost and Billy was sitting across the table from me and I seen Lois feeding a little baby with a Pete or a blue blanket wrapped around it and Billy was sitting in the corner feeding little Paul I said Billy I just saw a vision Lois was feeding a baby wrapped in a blue blanket he said there goes my hunting trip that's just nine months from now assistant 11 months later Little David was born and I haven't been able to dedicate him to the Lord yet and will not until we return again so you see what it is how I love people in their Fellowship but our Brethren has been praying for the sake and I know it's a success each night we prayed for the sick one laying your hands on the other all of us together which that way catches the whole scope but maybe if God willing I'll mark it on the card if we send it coming back I'd like to dedicate about two or three days again just to praying for the sake and doing what we can in that manner now I thank the people for their help again now I just want to comment just a moment on the on the morning's message there's no doubt I didn't get completely true with it but I think you understand and I'm sure you didn't you never know what that was for me to do now it seems very simple to you but you should see what you're doing you're taking the place of God to pronounce something and before I would do that it had become an answer from God and he had to come down and he visibly showed himself and gave the revelation therefore see this is to the church and remember I said these this what I said was to the church only and so that you might have confidence and know that was the same God that said to me up there or there was no squirrel speak and say where they'll be and three straight times that happened now if he can buy that same word create something that isn't there how much more will this hold fast at the day of judgment yeah people were there to see these things and no as Paul said in the days gone by there's a man with him who who felt the Earth shake and didn't hear the voice but they they seen the the pillar of farm the dummy good old actual is over to see husbands and wives that I know as genuine Christians hugging one another and weeping listen friends God confirms this word with signs and vindications that prove that it's right spoken word now remember that light that was in that cloud they gave the revelation my little girl was telling me Sarah here that when they at that school there in Arizona was looking out there on a cloudy sky and seeing this Cloud mysteriously and that mountain going up and down with an Amber fire burning in it the teacher dismissed the classes in the school and brought him out front said did you ever see anything like that look away that's it remember that's that same amber light that's on the rock so it's the same God same revelation said tell them to do this is what I told you this morning so there it is if it happens to be that my good friend brother Roy Roberson is listening into Tucson Roy you remember the other day the vision you've seen when we were out standing up on the mountain you come up to me and that cloud was over the top come walking down your heart he told you I told you at the house of the day that's it Roy don't worry no more son it's over you just don't know what that means it's Grace he loves you you love him humbly serve him in Worship in the rest of your days be happy or how to live as you are if you're happy continue that way don't never do anything wrong again like that just go ahead it's God's grace now I want to pray again before we enter into the word how many will pray for me I'm just going from meeting to meeting will you pray you know I'd like to sing a little song all of us together before we go to the word so that we know God just a little dedication did you ever hear this little song He careth for you through sunshine and sorrow he cares for you little ladies coming up to p and say I want to thank this little lady too I didn't even know who she was it's one of the Deacon's daughters here I certainly uh brother Wheeler's little girl she's grown up now she's a little bitty thing but said oh my knee not long ago and now she's a young woman so uh certainly thank her that she's used her talent and music and now she plays very sweetly would you give us the card sister all of us go now he he is [Music] sing it again all together [Music] around for you here for you through [Music] Sunshine our shadows [Music] brother Dal he does for you too brother don't you love him let us bow our heads now dear gracious God this little note here of a few things to say to the people and back again to refer back to this morning for that's what the people come to hear I pray God that you'll let the people see that God loves and cares and it was not me that give that Lord it was Vindicated it was the truth so I pray dear God that your love will always remain among the people tonight to have to separate after this meeting and go to our different homes it kind of pulls some deep Lord I pray that you'll bless these people now as we approach the word in prayer and approach the written word we ask that you will take this written word and make it alive to us tonight and when we leave this building tonight to separate to go to our different homes may we say like those who came from Emmaus that had walked with him all day and still didn't know him but when he got him inside the room that night the doors all shut he did something just like he did before his crucifixion by that they know he had risen again do it again tonight Lord granted while the doors are shut and your little group here is setting waiting father when we go to our homes we'll say like they did did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way we commit ourselves and all in your hands Lord do with us as you see fifth in Jesus name amen now let's get right into the service Now quickly turning now with me if you will to the book of Hebrews and another Revelation on the message we'll speak for just a few moments tonight the Lord willing and then while reading the first three verses of Hebrews 7 1-3 and then commenting on this and we don't know what the Lord will do we do not know the only thing we do is just believe watch pray that right and believe that he'll make everything work together for good to them it loves him because he promised to amen for this milk Cassidy king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of Peace let's read a little farther without father without mother without the sin neither beginning of days are end of life but made like unto the Son of God about it the priest continually think of this great person of how great this man must be and now the question is who is this man theologians has had different ideas but since the opening of The Seven Seals the mysterious book that's been mysterious to us according to Revelations 10 1-7 all the Mysteries that's wrote in this book that's been hid down through the age of the reformers is supposed to be brought out into view by the angel of the last churches how many knows that's right supposed to be brought all the mysteries of the mysterious book is to be revealed to the lady osia messenger of that age see there is much dispute about this person and this subject I think it behooves us to break into it to find out who this is now there's several schools of thought on him one of the schools are claims is just a myth he wasn't actually a person and the others says that it was a priesthood that was a male chesidic priesthood that's the most likely one that whole better to that side than they do to the other is because they say it was a priesthood it can't be that for in the fourth verse it says he was a person a man think of this great person of how great this man must be and now the question is who is this man theologians has had different ideas but since the opening of The Seven Seals the mysterious book that's been mysterious to us according to Revelations 10 1-7 all the Mysteries that's wrote in this book that's been hid down through the age of the reformers is supposed to be brought out into view by the angel of the last churches how many knows that's right supposed to be brought all the mysteries of the mysterious book is to be revealed to the lady osia messenger of that age see there is much dispute about this person and this subject I think it behooves us to break into it

the male chesidic priesthood that's the most likely one that whole better to that side than they do to the other is because they say it was a priesthood it can't be that for in the fourth verse it says he was a person a man so in order to be a person he has to be a personality a man not an order but a person so he was not just a priesthood order neither was he a myth he was a person and the person is eternal if you notice he had no father he had no mother he had no time he ever began and he had no time he ever ended and ever who it was is still alive tonight because the Bible said here that he had neither father nor mother getting of days are ending of life so it would have to be an eternal person is that wrong an eternal person so it could only be one person that's God because he's the only one that's eternal God now in first Timothy 6 15 and 16 if you'd like to read that sometime I'd like for you to read it now the thing that I contend is that he was God because he's the only person that can be immortal and now God changing himself into person that's what he wants no father no mother no beginning in life no entering of days now [Music] thank you [Music] foreign
