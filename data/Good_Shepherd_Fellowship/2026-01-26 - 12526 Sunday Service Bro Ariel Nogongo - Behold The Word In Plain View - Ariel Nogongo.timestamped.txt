[1:45] this morning
[1:46] and
[1:48] we want to thank the Lord for bringing
[1:51] us together, giving us this opportunity
[1:54] to come into the house of the Lord.
[1:57] And we want to greet uh greet you, greet
[2:01] everyone that is streaming into the
[2:03] service this morning.
[2:05] Uh just before we go into our service, I
[2:08] will uh before our song will come up. Uh
[2:12] I just uh
[2:14] talk there, we should
[2:17] just have a little prayer meeting this
[2:19] morning and then we will change the
[2:22] order of service.
[2:24] Let's read Psalm chapter 1
[2:28] 25.
[2:38] You know uh as as as believers
[2:42] sometime it's so easy for us to
[2:44] disconnect ourself with things. We think
[2:47] that we are disconnecting ourself with
[2:49] things that are happening around us
[2:51] because you know we have faith. We
[2:53] believe in God and not death. But uh we
[2:56] must realize that the the purpose of the
[3:00] church is to serve the community.
[3:03] That's what the church is for. But
[3:06] Brandon said when God called a man, he
[3:08] called him for the community. And the
[3:10] church is uh is God's representation in
[3:14] the community.
[3:16] So uh uh when we see everything that is
[3:18] happening around our community
[3:21] uh is uh I mean it would be very very
[3:25] wrong and very cold of us not to not to
[3:29] be able to identify
[3:32] with uh with the community in general.
[3:37] We are not part of their politics. We're
[3:39] not part of uh uh we not we are not
[3:43] supported by the governor or the the the
[3:45] state of Minnesota, we are supported by
[3:47] heaven, but we must realize this is
[3:50] where we live. This is where we go to
[3:52] work and uh this is where we bringing up
[3:55] our family. So, I just thought that
[4:00] uh with everything that is happening
[4:03] around us as a community, it will it
[4:07] will be good for us to just uh approach
[4:10] the Lord in prayer. Just uh yesterday,
[4:13] if you follow the another life for lost
[4:16] in our community with everything that is
[4:18] going on. We will leave we will leave
[4:21] that with uh with God to do the judgment
[4:25] but uh uh uh it's it's a human life that
[4:30] was lost and uh um
[4:34] people are hurting
[4:37] people lost their loved ones in such a
[4:39] time like this whether by the the chaos
[4:42] that is out there sickness or different
[4:45] things. There are people that are sick
[4:48] and overall people need the Lord.
[4:52] People need the Lord. So, I just thought
[4:55] that we would approach the service this
[4:57] morning uh uh by the word of prayer and
[5:01] then uh we can go into our our normal
[5:06] worship service. Times the times that
[5:08] around us are not normal. You know, the
[5:11] times around us are not they are no
[5:14] longer governed in a way that is
[5:17] supposed to be governed. So as uh as the
[5:21] church of the living God, we also learn
[5:23] to adopt to the times that are around
[5:25] us. If uh if it does not feel safe for
[5:29] us to be in church, we're not going to
[5:31] force you to come to church. And uh if
[5:34] it is uh uh I mean if it if it is just
[5:37] for us to have a prayer meeting, read a
[5:40] scripture and go home, that's exactly
[5:42] what we're going to do. So uh the time
[5:45] around us at that number, but we trust
[5:47] that the Lord will will will keep us.
[5:50] Amen. We trust that the Lord will keep
[5:53] us. That's why we we believe that he
[5:55] will watch over us. He promised to watch
[5:58] over our going out and our coming in. So
[6:01] we will read Psalm chapter 125 this
[6:04] morning and then we will just uh take up
[6:06] some few prayer needs and then uh we
[6:09] will turn ourselves to brother Lord.
[6:15] Psalm chapter 125
[6:18] they that trust in the Lord shall be as
[6:20] mount Zion which cannot be removed but
[6:25] forever
[6:27] as the mountains are round about
[6:29] Jerusalem. So the Lord is around about
[6:32] his people from henceforth even forever.
[6:37] For the rod of the wicked shall not rest
[6:40] upon the lots of the righteous.
[6:43] Least the righteous put forth his hands
[6:46] into iniquity. Do good, O Lord, unto
[6:49] those that be good and to them that are
[6:52] upright in their heart.
[6:55] As for such as turn aside from their
[6:59] crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them
[7:02] forth with uh
[7:05] the Lord shall lead them forth with the
[7:07] workers of iniquity, but peace shall be
[7:11] upon Israel. Amen.
[7:15] So, we are believing that the Lord uh uh
[7:21] he's the one that is watching over us.
[7:24] is the one that is watching over our
[7:26] loved ones. He's the one that is
[7:28] watching over our city. So, let's just
[7:30] bow our hands together this morning and
[7:35] u
[7:40] I bless your name. I bless your name.
[8:18] Let's sing that chorus now. I bless your
[8:22] name.
[8:25] I bless your name.
[8:31] I give you honor.
[8:38] I give you praise.
[8:43] You are the life,
[8:49] the truth,
[8:51] the way.
[8:55] I bless your name.
[9:01] I'll bless
[9:03] your name.
[9:06] Oh, I'll bless your name.
[9:12] I bless your name
[9:18] and I give you honor.
[9:23] Lord, we give you praise.
[9:29] You are the life,
[9:34] the truth, the way.
[9:40] I bless your name.
[9:45] I bless your name. One more time now.
[9:50] Lord, I bless your name.
[9:54] Thank you, Lord. I bless your name
[10:00] and I give you honor.
[10:06] I give you praise.
[10:11] You are the life,
[10:16] the truth, and the way.
[10:21] I bless your name.
[10:27] How bless your name.
[10:33] Let us pray together this morning while
[10:35] the music softly play.
[10:38] Let's just thank the Lord for his uh his
[10:42] blessing, his his his love that he has
[10:46] sprank upon us and uh realizing that is
[10:49] the Lord that that uh that keep the
[10:51] city. He's the one that's been watching
[10:53] over us. Let's just thank him for
[10:57] watching over our going out, our coming
[11:00] in and uh uh keeping his grace and his
[11:03] love and his mercy upon us. And uh let's
[11:06] just pray this morning also remember um
[11:10] all those that are hurting, all those
[11:13] that uh that are directly affected by
[11:16] everything that is happening around us
[11:18] and uh uh relations to those that lost
[11:22] their lives and uh and and loved ones
[11:26] away from them and all of that. And we
[11:28] just want to just uh lift our hearts to
[11:30] the Lord this morning. Like I said, as
[11:33] as a people of God, uh I mean, it's it's
[11:36] it's very wrong if we think that we are
[11:40] uh this special class of people or
[11:42] people that are untouchable. And uh uh
[11:45] we know that it is only by God's mercy
[11:48] and his protection upon our lives. But
[11:51] uh this is where we live and this is uh
[11:53] this is our community and uh and uh and
[11:56] that's the people that we must serve.
[11:58] The reason why God will put a church in
[12:01] a place is for the church to stand in
[12:03] the bridge. The church to be uh uh uh we
[12:07] must go to protest. We must go before
[12:09] the throne of God. We must protest
[12:12] before the throne of God asking God for
[12:15] mercy asking God to just uh h the people
[12:19] and uh uh and everyone from the leaders
[12:22] everyone that is that is involved. And
[12:24] that's what we want to do this morning.
[12:26] We just want to put our hearts before
[12:28] the Lord in a way that God will inspire
[12:31] your hearts to pray this morning. I want
[12:33] us to just pray. Let's pray together in
[12:36] Jesus name. Heavenly Father, in the name
[12:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ, oh God, we

[31:13] songs and change the order of the
[31:15] settings.
[31:35] We didn't have time to practice and at
[31:37] my house I don't have a piano yet. So,
[31:40] so we're gonna do it a cap.
[32:01] I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus
[32:09] who died
[32:11] upon the cruel tree
[32:16] to think of his great sacriice at
[32:20] Calords
[32:26] from me.
[32:29] How many are the lost that I have
[32:34] lifted?
[32:36] How many are the chain I' set free?
[32:42] I wonder have I done my best for Jesus
[32:50] when he
[32:52] has done so much for me.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; The thy
[33:01] wasted are so many.
[33:05] The
[33:08] spent for Christ so few.
[33:12] Because of all my lack of love for
[33:16] Jesus,
[33:18] I wonder if his heart is breaking, too.
[33:25] How many are the laws that I have?
[33:32] How many are they chained up to free?
[33:39] I wonder have I done my best for Jesus
[33:46] when he
[33:48] has done so much for me.
[33:54] I wonder I cared enough for others
[34:01] or have I let them die alone.
[34:07] I might have helped a wonder to the
[34:12] Savior.
[34:14] The seed of precious life I might have
[34:19] saw
[34:24] that I have lived.
[34:28] How many are the chain I' set free?
[34:35] I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus?
[34:42] When he
[34:44] has done so much for me,
[34:51] &gt;&gt; no longer will I stay within the valley.
[34:57] I'll climb to mountains above.
[35:02] The world is dying now for want of
[35:10] them of the Savior's matchless love.
[35:15] How many have I lost?
[35:22] How many are the chain I've helped to
[35:26] free?
[35:28] I wonder how I done my best for Jesus
[35:36] when he
[35:38] has done so much
[35:42] for me.

[45:00] word of prayer?
[45:03] Gracious heavenly father,
[45:07] we want to thank you, Father, this
[45:08] morning for the grace and the mercy
[45:11] that you have given unto us to be in
[45:13] your house. Lord,
[45:16] you have said when two or three are
[45:17] gathered in my name, I will be among
[45:19] you.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe one thing that you are
[45:23] here this morning, Lord.
[45:26] Even though the weather is so bad, so
[45:28] cold outside, Lord Jesus,
[45:31] &gt;&gt; but your people have come to see you,
[45:33] Lord, they have not come to meet me,
[45:36] Father, or meet one another, Lord God.
[45:38] We are standing in the presence of the
[45:40] mighty God, Jehovah. Lord, we believe
[45:43] that, Lord, that you would visit us in a
[45:45] special way.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know the needs of your people.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; You know our burdens, oh Father. We not
[45:52] coming here based on our own abilities.
[45:55] But we are relying on you Jesus.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; May you just come and open the portion
[46:00] of the word to us. Father, Lord God, may
[46:03] you bless us in a special way.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, encourage our hearts this morning,
[46:07] oh God. Lord, we going through so much,
[46:10] oh God, Father, but Lord, you promise
[46:12] that you will never leave us, that you
[46:14] will never forsake us, oh God. Even when
[46:17] the enemy is coming from different
[46:19] direction, oh God, our eyes are not
[46:21] looking neither to the north or the
[46:23] south or the east or west, Lord, but
[46:25] we're looking up to you, Father. Lord,
[46:28] may your angel take control over this
[46:30] service from the beginning to the end.
[46:32] Lord God, if there's any spirit that is
[46:34] not called upon your name, Lord, we
[46:36] remove it out of this place in the name
[46:37] of Jesus Christ. Father, we take this
[46:40] service under your control. May Lord
[46:42] God, the mighty angel comes in this room
[46:44] right now, oh God, as we are offering
[46:46] you, Father, our services, we put oursel
[46:49] aside that you would minister the word
[46:51] to your people only in your own manner,
[46:54] Lord. We love you, Father. We appreciate
[46:57] you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray and
[47:00] ask. Amen.
[47:02] May God bless you.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the house of the
[47:08] Lord?
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Uh the Lord has been good to us. Uh and
[47:13] without his help, I don't think that
[47:14] we'll be able to be here. Uh we're just
[47:17] trusting in him that something will be
[47:19] said that will be of an eternal value of
[47:22] a blessing to you. Is that right? Uh we
[47:26] want to dismiss also our sister and the
[47:28] kids for Sunday school. the pastor asked
[47:30] me to do so and uh we were just going to
[47:33] open our Bibles.
[47:38] I was planning to have a PowerPoint but
[47:40] uh the Lord decided otherwise. So we'll
[47:42] trust the Lord for the remaining portion
[47:46] of the service.
[47:48] Uh we'll open our Bibles in the book of
[47:52] of Deuteronomy chapter 29.
[47:58] Deuteronomy chapter 29. It's only one
[48:01] verse.
[48:07] Deuteronomy the last actually last verse
[48:10] of uh Deuteronomy chapter 29.
[48:15] I will really depend on your prayers.
[48:18] Who who promised to pray for me?
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I need that this morning.
[48:24] There is something that the Lord has put
[48:25] in my heart and and throughout the night
[48:29] was just a little challenging but I know
[48:32] it's a blessing you know it's a sign
[48:34] that God is about to do something
[48:36] &gt;&gt; you know to me I just know when things
[48:38] start happening and things are just
[48:41] trouble start happening I know that God
[48:43] is about to do something
[48:44] &gt;&gt; and this morning as as we were driving
[48:46] and somebody almost ran over us he was
[48:48] not even looking so I was like whoa
[48:50] there was something good this morning
[48:52] that God
[48:53] So even myself, I'm depending on the
[48:55] Lord that he'll be able to help us and
[48:58] and uh break the word of God. Is that
[48:59] right?
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Now, Deuteronomy chapter 29 verse 21 uh
[49:03] 29
[49:05] if we can read it together. Is that
[49:07] okay?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "The secret things
[49:12] belong unto the Lord our God, but those
[49:15] things which are revealed belong unto us
[49:19] and to our children forever." And we may
[49:22] do all the words of this book.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; You see, secret belongs to God.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Once God decide to open that secret,
[49:34] &gt;&gt; it belongs to you.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:7.
[49:44] Revelation 10 verse 7.
[49:53] And we're going to read the last uh I
[49:56] mean verse seven. That's right.
[50:01] If we can all do it together.
[50:04] But in the days of the voice of the
[50:07] seventh angel, when it shall begin to
[50:10] sound, the mystery of God should be
[50:13] finished
[50:14] &gt;&gt; as he has declared to his servants the
[50:17] prophets.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; And and I want to draw your attention to
[50:21] uh the mystery there is singular is not
[50:24] plural.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You notice that
[50:27] &gt;&gt; it's singular. So you may be seated.
[50:29] Thank you.
[50:34] Um
[50:36] I want to appreciate brother one once
[50:38] again uh for the privilege to speak this
[50:41] morning. Uh
[50:44] uh we we trust that the Lord will be
[50:46] able to help us. Uh I want to read again
[50:51] a a quotation that I read on on
[50:55] Wednesday.
[50:57] Uh and I think the Lord has been really
[50:59] dealing with my heart to remain on this
[51:03] subject or this thought here. He speaks
[51:06] in the message the context. He says he's
[51:08] praying just at the end of year 62
[51:12] entering into 63. It says heavenly
[51:15] father as we stand here as many thoughts
[51:19] is dying out in our heart and of the
[51:23] mistake of last year as we approaching
[51:26] the death of 62 and the birth of 63. He
[51:30] says, "Oh God, may we be one step higher
[51:34] up the ladder until we can see Jesus and
[51:38] his program." And for this new year, I
[51:41] want to see Jesus and his program. Now
[51:44] in everything that is happening around
[51:46] us saints, we want to see Jesus and his
[51:49] program.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; And on Wednesday we spoke about the
[51:52] purpose of God, the two baskets of fig
[51:54] showing how God has sent Israel to
[51:58] captivity, you know, and it says it was
[52:01] for their good.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; And the question came out to be uh how
[52:05] can captivity can be seen as something
[52:08] positive. Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; You know how can your trial and the
[52:12] things that you are dealing with can be
[52:15] considered as something positive
[52:17] &gt;&gt; or something good, right?
[52:19] &gt;&gt; But God has a purpose. You know, God is
[52:23] is an eternal God. He has he was living
[52:26] by himself as Elohim is having thoughts.
[52:29] He he had desire to do things in a
[52:32] certain way. But it happens that you
[52:34] know when God has thoughts, it's a
[52:37] secret in his mind. as we just read. Is
[52:39] that right?
[52:40] &gt;&gt; So there's a mystery that is there that
[52:43] is very very important is a principle
[52:45] even of God himself. You know when you
[52:48] have a secret in your heart you don't
[52:50] disclose it. Is that right?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; It is still in your mind. You're just
[52:53] thinking about it. You're fellowshipping
[52:55] about it right about the whole thing.
[52:58] You're planning to do you kind of having
[53:00] ideas how you're going to make it
[53:01] happen. Is that right?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing with God. He was
[53:04] living by himself as Elohim. But now
[53:06] having all of this thought in his mind
[53:10] and including you, you were part of his
[53:12] mind.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that?
[53:16] &gt;&gt; You were part of God even before you
[53:19] step into that flesh.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; You were part of his thought.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; So now everything including you, you
[53:27] were a secret in his mind.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; You were part of that secret. Right?
[53:33] &gt;&gt; But now God is trying to express
[53:36] whatever from whatever he had in his
[53:38] thought. He want to make it tangible.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Then he begins to create things. He
[53:44] create angel to worship him.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Because he desired to be worshiped.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; But now we saw on Wednesday nobody
[53:54] nobody was you know there was no no a
[53:56] sinner on earth yet.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Right. But God actually make men in a
[54:01] certain way. He gave him the free more
[54:03] agency, the ability to choose.
[54:06] He gave the woman to be a wicked vessel
[54:08] for for for a purpose. All of these
[54:10] things we saw that, right?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; But behind it, God wanted to express
[54:15] what he had in his mind.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; He wanted to leave the state of being a
[54:20] secret
[54:22] that only belongs to him.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; But now he says, I have subject on
[54:26] earth. I want whatever I had as a secret
[54:30] to to be tangible, I want to express
[54:33] that in the life of my son and my
[54:35] daughter. How many of us believe that?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And I do believe that if you are sick
[54:40] tonight,
[54:42] Jesus Christ or God himself, he has the
[54:45] desire to heal you.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; It's not just if you want or what is his
[54:50] purpose to heal you.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; But now you need to have faith.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] Faith is the only thing that can
[54:58] actually CUT GOD BECAUSE GOD HAS already
[55:01] spoken it.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; But you must believe for whatever God
[55:06] says is the truth.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Anybody that applies faith on anything
[55:12] will see the result.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Even if they are in sin, even a
[55:18] prostitute on the street, if she apply
[55:20] faith the right way, God will give you
[55:22] give her what she wants. Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; That that's true.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; So it depends on your faith.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; But now as we entering into this new
[55:33] year, there's quite a lot of things
[55:34] going on.
[55:36] But we want to see Christ. We want to
[55:39] see Jesus and his plan.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Why God is allowing things to happen the
[55:45] way it's happening.
[55:48] But I want to turn your mind here just
[55:51] for for for a few minutes that we have
[55:52] before us on Jesus Christ the word. I
[55:56] want you to keep Christ inside of your
[55:59] on your mind. Is that right?
[56:01] &gt;&gt; So my subject tonight I want to speak on
[56:04] behold the word in plan view.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Behold
[56:12] the word in plan view.
[56:15] Now when I'm mentioning the word behold,
[56:17] behold just means discern, perceive,
[56:22] look closely,
[56:24] pay attention.
[56:27] The word is Christ. How many of us
[56:29] believe that?
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; So in other word, pay attention on Jesus
[56:33] Christ. Focus on Jesus Christ.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Many times when things happening, we're
[56:39] focusing on events that are happening
[56:42] around us. I don't think it's there's
[56:44] anything wrong with it, right? But we as
[56:46] believer, we should keep our eyes on
[56:48] Jesus Christ.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Because the time that we lose our sight
[56:53] from Jesus Christ, the world will take
[56:56] control of our life.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; We stop making decision without even
[57:01] knowing that that's come true to the
[57:02] word.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; But if you keep your eyes on Jesus
[57:06] Christ, then the word of God begins to
[57:09] explain to you why all of these things
[57:11] are happening. Amen.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; And you start looking in the word, God
[57:14] starts showing you, look at this. It had
[57:16] happened in the past because there's
[57:18] nothing new under the sun.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; So your sickness, you're not the only
[57:22] person on earth that had it.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Your trouble, you're not the first
[57:26] person.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be the last person.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; But for anything to happen in your life,
[57:32] you must keep your eyes on the word.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; If you're expecting a miracle in your
[57:36] situation, keep your eyes on the word.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? We should keep our
[57:43] eyes on the revealed word for our day.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Now, by the grace of God, I want to look
[57:49] into the Old Testament for just a minute
[57:51] here.
[57:56] When men sin in the Garden of Eden,
[58:01] Adam and Eve had fellowship with God.
[58:04] How many of us believe that?
[58:06] &gt;&gt; There was no hindrance. So if man want
[58:09] to talk to God, he will just have a
[58:12] conversation with his father. No limit.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; You see that
[58:18] &gt;&gt; there's no nothing could hinder Adam to
[58:21] express to his father what he wanted.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Adam could stand throughout the day. He
[58:26] says, "No, I don't want that tree to be
[58:28] there." He turns and say, "Tree move on
[58:31] the other side."
[58:33] &gt;&gt; And God will look and say, "Oh, that's
[58:34] the way I wanted to do it."
[58:39] So God will look at Adam the way he's
[58:42] operating. God is saying this is the way
[58:45] I will do it as well.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful to come to that
[58:50] place where
[58:51] &gt;&gt; you don't even have to kneel down and
[58:53] pray.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; You just speak the word and something
[58:55] happened.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; How many of us believe that we'll get
[59:00] there? We are getting there for a matter
[59:02] of fact.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; But the power of the spoken word Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD is bringing us back to that
[59:09] place
[59:10] &gt;&gt; where we have the same authority that
[59:13] Adam had.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; For the matter of fact, the word
[59:17] redemption to restoration is TO BRING US
[59:20] BACK TO THAT PLACE.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; And there must be a message
[59:26] &gt;&gt; that will bring us back there. Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; There must be a a a a a light that will
[59:33] shine that will give so much power into
[59:36] our being to speak something into
[59:38] existence.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; It's not our own ability. For the matter
[59:43] of fact, we're already born in sin.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; This body is already compromised.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; But the things that will do it, it's not
[59:50] what you see here.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; It's something that is happening inside
[59:54] of your heart.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Because your heart must be turned.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And once our heart is turned, then we
[1:00:03] can speak things into existence.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And you need faith to do that.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; It's not an intellectual faith to say,
[1:00:11] "Oh, I maybe I will do it." No, that's a
[1:00:14] guess.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S GOD. WHEN GOD DWELL IN YOUR
[1:00:18] HEART, God starts speaking from within.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; God is speaking FROM WITHIN. THE GOD
[1:00:24] THAT LIVES in your life, in my sister,
[1:00:26] in my brother begins to speak things
[1:00:29] into existence.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Even your children must be probably gone
[1:00:34] astray.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; You can speak from within.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; You start claiming them from within.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I don't know where my
[1:00:43] child CAN BE,
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT I'VE
[1:00:46] RECEIVED, I'm calling that child back."
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; You see that? Then you start speaking to
[1:00:51] the devil. is a Satan.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; I'm a son and a daughter of God.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; I know my position in Christ
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; and I know what I HAVE RECEIVED.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; SO I have the right to claim my child.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; See, let me tell you something.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; It's God who has given you that child.
[1:01:09] In other word, you have the right as a
[1:01:12] parent to claim that child.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; It's God's given child. That's your
[1:01:19] inheritance.
[1:01:21] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; There's no demon in hell
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; that can stand against against a child
[1:01:29] of God who knows their position in
[1:01:31] Christ.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; So, the church of the living God, we
[1:01:35] must get there.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Because we are living in the time where
[1:01:42] the word has been revealed to us.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; The same authority that Adam had.
[1:01:50] Oh, glory to God. The same authority
[1:01:53] that Adam had, we have it now.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; How many of us believe it?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Then as we are preaching,
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to claim it.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; I want you to claim it.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Adam in the Garden of Eden had lost his
[1:02:15] position. He has lost his authority
[1:02:18] because of sin.
[1:02:20] Can you imagine the sadness he could
[1:02:23] have could feel? He says, "Man, I could
[1:02:26] I could talk to my father, but now I
[1:02:27] can't talk to him."
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; And he looks at Eve. He said, he's not
[1:02:33] looking at Eve to blame if or if it's
[1:02:34] because of you. It's because of love.
[1:02:36] He's looking at Eve if say love, I love
[1:02:38] you, Eve.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; These things happen is because I made a
[1:02:42] decision. Yes,
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; I deliberately made a decision because
[1:02:46] of love that I had toward you.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S OKAY IF GOD WANT TO CAST US
[1:02:52] OUT. BUT I I'M GOING TO STAY with you.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; That's Christ love.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; That's love being expressed.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; SO SAINTS WHEN WHEN WE ARE looking at
[1:03:04] our wives maybe they can make a mistake.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; The love of Christ in our heart we
[1:03:09] should stand there and say you know you
[1:03:10] have done wrong. Yeah,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; I don't stand for it, BUT I WILL STAND
[1:03:14] with you.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; I WILL PRAY THAT the Lord will help us.
[1:03:19] This is the reason why
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit has been sent to this
[1:03:24] age to have the nature of Christ.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; It's not about our culture.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; It's not about OUR TRADITION. WE ARE
[1:03:34] TALKING ABOUT THE SPIRIT OF JESUS
[1:03:36] CHRIST. AMEN.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; We are we have come here
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; to receive the spirit of Christ,
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; not to receive the spirit of our
[1:03:45] ancestors.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; If we are Christian, we must align by
[1:03:54] this book.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Not our tradition.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Adam lost his authority.
[1:04:06] Now God cast them out you know he
[1:04:11] removed them out from the garden of Eden
[1:04:15] and he placed cherubans.
[1:04:19] If we go to the book of Genesis chapter
[1:04:21] 3
[1:04:23] there is a thought that is coming there.
[1:04:25] I will trust really in the Lord tonight
[1:04:26] this morning.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I mean the gift is just to put
[1:04:30] yourself aside so God can use it.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to do it this morning by
[1:04:34] the grace of God. Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 3.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 3 verse uh probably the
[1:04:42] the last the last three verses there.
[1:04:45] Let me look into that real quick.
[1:04:48] Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 3 verse 23.
[1:04:57] Therefore,
[1:04:59] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[1:05:02] from the garden of Eden to tilt the
[1:05:04] ground from then he he was taken. So he
[1:05:07] drove out the men and he placed at the
[1:05:10] east side of garden of Eden cherubims
[1:05:14] and the a flaming sword which turned
[1:05:18] every way to keep the way. I want you to
[1:05:22] catch that. To keep the way of the tree
[1:05:25] of life.
[1:05:27] You see the cheruban will say no if we
[1:05:30] let Adam and Eve touch the tree of life
[1:05:34] they're going to live eternally again
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; says but sin has already entered
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; it come he places the cherubims to God
[1:05:42] the throne he says to God what the way
[1:05:47] the way of the tree of life the tree of
[1:05:49] life was a person
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; the tree of life was Jesus Christ
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; the way he is the way and the truth.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; So the way was Jesus Christ and the tree
[1:05:59] of life was a person which was Jesus
[1:06:02] Christ as well.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; So the way to Christ was blocked because
[1:06:07] of sin.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Nobody had access to God.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; The feeling that Adam could have to go
[1:06:19] in the presence of God, it was no longer
[1:06:21] there.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:23] It was blocked because there were
[1:06:25] cherubims with with flaming sword.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; But now God,
[1:06:33] remember God has a purpose.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing this?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Even if he places cherubams there,
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; he still has a purpose about you.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; It's not about Adam and Eve. It was
[1:06:50] about him. Yeah,
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; he desired to fulfill something.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; But he says, "No, I don't want you guys
[1:06:57] to touch on the tree of life again.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you touch it, you live
[1:07:01] eternally."
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; That sent them out.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Now, Adam never knew the feeling of
[1:07:10] having a headache.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; He start having headache.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; He start feeling weak in his body.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; And it happens that Son Abel was
[1:07:23] murdered but the son of the devil came.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Adam stood there says what had just
[1:07:31] happened. It took Abel. He had to bury
[1:07:35] him
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; which isn't another process. I never
[1:07:39] seen such a thing. The lion that I used
[1:07:41] to fellowship with that lion is coming
[1:07:43] after me.
[1:07:47] said, "Can you imagine the confusion
[1:07:49] that I personally will be will have?"
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; I can't even imagine.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; But yet, God was still looking at the
[1:07:59] son.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; God took a lamb. It says, "No, I'm going
[1:08:04] to reproduce what is in my mind,
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; but yet it's not going to be what really
[1:08:11] I want, but I'm going to bring it in the
[1:08:13] in the shadow form."
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Are we having a conversation this
[1:08:19] morning, right?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep it like that and I
[1:08:22] trust the Lord for the remain portion.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "No, I'm just going to play as
[1:08:27] a shadow." It takes an animal. God slay
[1:08:30] the animal.
[1:08:32] And the blood was gushing all over the
[1:08:34] place. And he took the skin of that
[1:08:36] animal and he covered Adam.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; He covered Eve.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Do you remember that when Adam was
[1:08:44] running away from God, it took a a a
[1:08:48] fake thing. He covered himself. Is that
[1:08:50] right?
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; But the Bible calls a religion.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Sometime when we do wrong, we run away
[1:08:57] from God.
[1:08:59] It's not you that is going on your knees
[1:09:01] and say God please forgive me we're
[1:09:02] running away
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; but God is coming down and says Adam
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Adam
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; where are you what condition are you in
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; do you realize what you have just done
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; says father I'm running away said why
[1:09:17] are you running away I'm naked who told
[1:09:19] you that you were naked
[1:09:23] but God in his mercy
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; is covering every single one of us this
[1:09:28] morning regardless of our mistakes,
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; regardless of our sin,
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; that's why saints sometime we don't
[1:09:37] grasp these things. God has done so much
[1:09:40] for you and I that we should never even
[1:09:42] stand and complain.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; We should live a life of thanksgiving.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; You know, there are people that hear the
[1:09:52] word, they laughing, it's because they
[1:09:54] don't know. But when God brings you to
[1:09:57] the place to realize what my Lord has
[1:09:59] done,
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; saints, it will make you live
[1:10:03] differently.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; It would change your work.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; It would influence everything that
[1:10:10] you're doing.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Because you came to the understanding
[1:10:13] that this I I don't deserve to even have
[1:10:16] my clothes on.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; I don't even deserve to have a job.
[1:10:21] But he decided even in the midst of my
[1:10:23] mistakes.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; He came down. He says, "You know what? I
[1:10:26] will give you a job.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; I will give you a good health."
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; May we worship God for the rest of our
[1:10:34] life. Right? Is that right?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Now they kick him out. They go, you
[1:10:40] know, and that path, that way to the
[1:10:43] tree of life was blocked. But later on,
[1:10:46] God spoke to Moses. He says, "Moses, I
[1:10:49] want you to build a sanctuary for me."
[1:10:52] And Moses built the sanctuary after what
[1:10:55] he sought in the mount.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Now, Moses seeing the tabernacle in
[1:11:03] heaven,
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; God told him, "Go on earth and reproduce
[1:11:06] that."
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; And he comes, he reproduces exactly that
[1:11:12] way. But there is something that was
[1:11:14] similar. You know, whatever Moses did in
[1:11:17] the in the in the in the wilderness,
[1:11:19] that's a picture of what was happening
[1:11:22] in heaven.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:11:25] Moses comes and he divide that part into
[1:11:29] three, that tabernacle into three.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; So he put the outer courts. So the outer
[1:11:35] courts if you enter, I don't know if uh
[1:11:38] uh do you still have my picture on the
[1:11:39] on the temple, please?
[1:11:43] I love images. But just to help me a
[1:11:45] little bit here,
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; you know, if you enter, you see the
[1:11:49] outer court.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Anybody had access into the outer court.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; The same sun that was shining. Everybody
[1:11:59] could access the outer court and play
[1:12:00] around the outer court.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. Thank you, sir.
[1:12:05] You would enter here. This is the outer
[1:12:08] court. Anybody can play here. This is
[1:12:10] exposed to the outside, the sun. In
[1:12:12] other words, the zodiac.
[1:12:14] Right? The moon, the stars is exposed to
[1:12:18] this light.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; All of us are coming to church. We are
[1:12:23] under the influence of the outside part
[1:12:25] here.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; The body you influence from your friend
[1:12:29] and all of these the negative things are
[1:12:31] happening here because this is
[1:12:33] representing you as well
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; because you are a body, a spirit and a
[1:12:37] soul.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; So the man that enters here, there is
[1:12:42] the breast and altar. the place that
[1:12:44] they killed an animal,
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; right? They killed an animal. Now Jesus
[1:12:50] Christ is a lamb, right?
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; You can't see that Jesus this means also
[1:12:53] Calvary.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Because he had to be killed here.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; This is the lava
[1:13:04] where they will wash the the high pri
[1:13:06] the priest and stuff, right?
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And there is a veil here, you know, uh
[1:13:12] the door. It's called the door. I think
[1:13:14] probably the gates, the door and then
[1:13:15] the veil if I'm not mistaken. But if you
[1:13:19] enter here, the only the priest would
[1:13:21] enter there
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; into that second part,
[1:13:25] right?
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to this part here,
[1:13:29] because this is working based on the
[1:13:30] light of the candlesticks,
[1:13:33] which is here,
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; right? Of course, this part here is
[1:13:37] completely covered,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; but the light here is the light of the
[1:13:40] candlesticks.
[1:13:42] But here there is a light of the pillar
[1:13:44] of fire.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; But to enter here there is a veil.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; It says no man can enter into this place
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; because it was the place that the shana
[1:13:58] glory will come down.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; The place where the the the the pill of
[1:14:01] fire will come down. No man had access
[1:14:04] there.
[1:14:06] In other words, God was here.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; No man had access into God. It was
[1:14:12] blocked and this veil was covered with
[1:14:15] cherbins.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; The veil there had images of of of of of
[1:14:25] the cherbins. In other words, it was
[1:14:29] covered.
[1:14:32] It was protected. God says no man can
[1:14:34] enter here. In the same way when Adam
[1:14:37] was kicked out, he had no access to the
[1:14:40] tree of life.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; He was blocked for men too.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; But it says only one man could enter
[1:14:49] who is the high priest.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Only Aaron could enter once a year.
[1:14:56] But as Aaron is entering into that
[1:14:58] present, he had to wash himself. You
[1:15:01] cannot enter any type of way. Even if
[1:15:04] you are the high priest.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; You cannot enter without the blood.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; You see, YOU CANNOT JUST ENTER INTO the
[1:15:14] presence of God any type of way.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; It's not just God, thank you for
[1:15:18] everything done. No,
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; it must be a way to enter.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; There's a way to enter with sincerity,
[1:15:28] with reverence, with fear.
[1:15:34] We don't enter any type of way.
[1:15:37] Then that's the light of the pillar of
[1:15:39] fire
[1:15:41] and only Aaron alone would enter. If the
[1:15:44] high priest does not enter the right
[1:15:47] way, they is going to die there.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; They will attach a string on him and
[1:15:54] pull him out because no man can access
[1:15:56] that place.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; It was also blocked.
[1:16:03] But who was going to enter?
[1:16:06] Even in the tabernacle of Solomon, it
[1:16:10] was the same way.
[1:16:12] That place was blocked. Let's go to the
[1:16:15] book of Hebrew chapter 9:2. How many of
[1:16:17] us love the Lord?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; We're just having a conversation. Is
[1:16:21] that okay?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's a prayer meeting as
[1:16:23] brother one says. So, we'll keep it
[1:16:25] simple.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And our title, I want to don't forget
[1:16:28] about this. the word. Behold the word in
[1:16:31] plain view. Is that right?
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 9 verse two.
[1:16:41] For there was a tabernacle made.
[1:16:44] Hebrew 9:2.
[1:16:47] For there was a tabernacle made the
[1:16:48] first wherein was the candlestick. We
[1:16:52] saw that, right?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; And the table the shortbread which is
[1:16:55] called the sanctuary. And after the
[1:16:58] second veil, the tabernacle which is
[1:17:00] called the holiest of all. You see that?
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; And after the second veil,
[1:17:08] the tab uh the second veil, the
[1:17:10] tabernacle, which is called the holiest
[1:17:12] of all, right?
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Verse four, which had golden
[1:17:16] sensor, and the ark of the covenant
[1:17:18] overlay round about with gold, wherein
[1:17:22] was the golden part that had mana inside
[1:17:25] now of the right of that that place,
[1:17:28] right? And
[1:17:31] wherein was the golden part that had
[1:17:34] mana and Aaron rode that bud and the the
[1:17:36] the the table of the covenant inside of
[1:17:41] the ark of the covenant. Are you with
[1:17:42] me? Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; And over
[1:17:46] it the cheruban of glory shadowing the
[1:17:50] mercy seat of which we cannot now speak
[1:17:54] particularly.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, inside of the holiest of
[1:17:58] all is the the ark of the covenant.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; And inside he had the road of Aaron,
[1:18:05] right? The mana.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And also what what was the third one?
[1:18:10] Who was paying attention? There was the
[1:18:12] third the third things the the the the
[1:18:15] covenants the ten commandments
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; but you know under that presence the
[1:18:22] mana could go couldn't go bad or rot
[1:18:25] because the presence of god was there
[1:18:27] was keeping it fresh
[1:18:29] even a dry stick was butting was burning
[1:18:34] under the atmosphere are you with me
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; so when you are in the presence of god
[1:18:40] into the holiest of holies.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; You cannot go bad
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; because you are actually feeling under
[1:18:46] that presence.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; That's where we got to get in
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; into.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; But let's continue. Let's continue the
[1:18:56] reading.
[1:18:58] Now the when these things were thus
[1:19:01] ordained, the priest went always into
[1:19:04] the first tabernacle, in other words,
[1:19:06] the holy place.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Right? Are you with me? Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Acco accomplishing the service of God.
[1:19:13] Seven. But in the second, which is the
[1:19:17] holiest of holies, right? When the high
[1:19:20] priest alone
[1:19:22] once every year, not without the blood.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Which he offered for himself.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Right. And for the heirs of the people.
[1:19:36] Let's continue.
[1:19:38] Watch now. What? I want you to catch
[1:19:40] this. Don't miss this. It says the Holy
[1:19:42] Ghost, this signifying
[1:19:46] that the way into the holiest of holies
[1:19:49] of all
[1:19:51] was not yet made manifest.
[1:19:55] In other words,
[1:19:58] the holiest of holies were not made
[1:20:01] visible.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] Because to be made manifest means that
[1:20:07] the veil was covering
[1:20:10] the God that dwells in the holiest of
[1:20:12] holies.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; No man could access God. We saw that,
[1:20:17] right? Because he was blocked.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; It says made CONTINUE MADE MANIFEST WHY
[1:20:24] as the first tabernacle was yet what?
[1:20:26] Standing
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; nine.
[1:20:34] Okay, that's fine. We can stop there.
[1:20:37] You see that everything was blocked. No
[1:20:39] man had access.
[1:20:42] But if we look in the scripture,
[1:20:47] one day there was a man
[1:20:50] called John the Baptist.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; He came into the world,
[1:20:55] right?
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist was a prophet of God.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. According to Matthew Malachi
[1:21:04] chapter 3,
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; John came and his his purpose on earth
[1:21:11] is his his ministry on earth was to
[1:21:13] introduce the Messiah.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Now throughout the Old Testament, it was
[1:21:19] spoken of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:22] But John one day comes and by the Holy
[1:21:25] Spirit God told him. He says if you see
[1:21:28] a man coming,
[1:21:30] he gave him a sign. Says if you see a
[1:21:33] man coming, there is do on top of his
[1:21:36] head. He is the one.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; And he came. He says, "Behold the lamb
[1:21:42] of God that taketh away the sin of the
[1:21:45] world."
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; That was Jesus Christ.
[1:21:49] So the word the logos what God himself
[1:21:54] had become man.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in the beginning
[1:22:00] was God
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; right? And God in the in the beginning
[1:22:03] was the word and the word was with God
[1:22:05] and the word was God
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; and the word became flesh.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Flesh in what? In Jesus and dwell among
[1:22:14] us. Are we together? Amen.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; So Jesus came as the lamb of God.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; You see the pattern in Genesis. God had
[1:22:24] killed an animal that was just a shadow.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; But now in the real image of the the
[1:22:31] elements now Jesus is coming but he has
[1:22:34] to be introduced by a messenger.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; So when the word comes it must be a
[1:22:43] prophet on earth. as the word is coming.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; That's the principle because the
[1:22:50] messenger had to present the word to
[1:22:53] people.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND WHY JOHN SAID, "Behold
[1:22:59] the lamb of God." He had to point
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; the people to the word. Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Now when he points the word to the
[1:23:11] people, the word was in what? In plain
[1:23:15] view.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; God was in plain view.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Now in human flesh.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; But now if you look at the scriptures,
[1:23:29] the word came in human flesh
[1:23:32] and dwelt among them.
[1:23:35] But look how they acted when the word
[1:23:38] came to them.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Saint, let me tell you something. The
[1:23:45] same word that came
[1:23:48] to John the Baptist, that same word is
[1:23:51] coming to you and I.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; It's not a different Jesus. It's not a
[1:23:58] different God. is the same God but is
[1:24:01] appear in in the form of the word. Then
[1:24:05] it was the in the form of a man called
[1:24:07] Jesus.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Because that there's three dispensation.
[1:24:13] God the father, fatherhood, God above
[1:24:15] us.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; It cannot be touched. It's invisible.
[1:24:19] Are you with me?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WITH US. THAT'S EMANUEL. THAT'S
[1:24:23] Jesus Christ. AMEN.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD in us IS IN THE WORD form in
[1:24:29] you.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; So now when we talking about Jesus,
[1:24:34] we're talking about the word.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; The word that you and I are listening,
[1:24:40] we are listening to Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; So now when the word is being revealed
[1:24:49] to you and I, it's easy for us to miss
[1:24:51] it.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; In the time when Jesus came, they saw a
[1:24:57] man
[1:24:59] dressing like the rest of them.
[1:25:02] Are you with me?
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; He had dust on his feet.
[1:25:06] They looked at him and say, "How can
[1:25:08] this man be called God?"
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:14] The Pharisee assaulted him, called him
[1:25:16] names, rejected him, laughed at him,
[1:25:20] mocked him.
[1:25:22] But yet the word was in plain view
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; before them.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; But they were also a group of people
[1:25:33] that were part of the mind of God.
[1:25:38] When the word was passing by them,
[1:25:42] something in them triggered,
[1:25:45] not everyone.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; There were only those that God knew
[1:25:50] before the foundation of the world. When
[1:25:52] the word was passing by them, they felt
[1:25:55] something and said, "No, something is
[1:25:57] different."
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to catch this, Andrew.
[1:26:03] Let's look at a scripture, right, in the
[1:26:04] Bible.
[1:26:11] May the Lord help us. John chapter 1
[1:26:14] verse 40 41.
[1:26:20] If they can have it really quick, so
[1:26:21] we'll go faster here.
[1:26:24] Now we will notice that the Bible says
[1:26:27] John uh 1:41
[1:26:30] he first found his own brother Simon and
[1:26:34] said unto him we have found the Messiah
[1:26:37] which is being interpreted the Christ
[1:26:41] that's Andrew find his brother Peter he
[1:26:45] says come see we have found this man
[1:26:48] called Jesus the Christ right and he
[1:26:51] brought him to Jesus and When Jesus
[1:26:55] beheld him,
[1:26:57] he said, "Thou are Simon, the son of
[1:27:01] Jonah, thou shall be called Cphus, which
[1:27:06] is by interpretation a stone."
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Automatically, what do you notice? The
[1:27:12] word made flesh begins to discern who
[1:27:16] Peter was.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He knew his father Jonah. Yeah,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; this might be a secret. Say, "How in the
[1:27:24] world did you know my father's name
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; because the word must be identified?
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; The m the Messiah must be identified by
[1:27:35] the way is dealing with things."
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are we together? Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; If we go down to Philillip
[1:27:47] 46
[1:27:49] or 44.
[1:27:51] Now I want you to pay attention. Brother
[1:27:52] Brenham brings us something in the sign
[1:27:54] of the Messiah says now Jesus doing is
[1:27:58] going to the Jews making himself known.
[1:28:01] Now as soon as it taken place there was
[1:28:05] one named Phillip.
[1:28:07] He thought that was drilling. So around
[1:28:12] the mountain he went 50 miles and he
[1:28:15] found his friend of his by the name of
[1:28:19] Nathaniel. So the distance between
[1:28:22] Philillip and Nathaniel Bham says he was
[1:28:25] 15 miles away.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; So Philillip had an experience with the
[1:28:32] Messiah.
[1:28:34] He goes 15 miles away. He found
[1:28:37] Nathaniel on his knees closer to a tree
[1:28:39] praying.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Nathaniel stand there is praying.
[1:28:47] Brother Benham says he did not want to
[1:28:48] bother him.
[1:28:50] And when he finished praying, he called
[1:28:53] him said Nathaniel, we just find the
[1:28:55] Messiah.
[1:28:57] He says, "Where is he from? Oh no, he's
[1:28:58] from Nazareth. Oh, is there anything
[1:29:00] good coming out of Nazareth?"
[1:29:04] Philip toss Nathaniel. He says, "Come
[1:29:06] and see."
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Come see by yourself.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Bren says, "That was the best
[1:29:16] answer that he could give him."
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Sometime we hear about Jesus Christ.
[1:29:25] But sometime we have heard about him
[1:29:27] from somebody else.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:33] But we have never come to experience
[1:29:35] him.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Philillip knew what he was talking
[1:29:39] about.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Nathaniel had no idea.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; So when they called him, he says, "Let
[1:29:46] me go see."
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; And when he got there,
[1:29:53] he told him that we have found Messiah.
[1:29:56] Verse 40 47. Jesus saw Nathaniel coming
[1:30:00] to him and said unto him,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; "Behold." Are you catching something
[1:30:04] similar here?
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; It says, "Behold, an Israelite indeed in
[1:30:10] whom is no guile." In other words, you
[1:30:15] are a righteous man.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Nathaniel said unto him, "Whence knoweth
[1:30:21] thou me?" Jesus answered said to him,
[1:30:24] "Before Philillip called thee, when
[1:30:27] there was under the fig tree,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; I saw you."
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; For Nathaniel, there was
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; saint God is doing things
[1:30:45] by through the word of God. Sometime we
[1:30:48] are missing it. Yes,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; I want to stop here just for a minute.
[1:30:53] God would minister to you about
[1:30:55] something.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; He will point something to you. You look
[1:30:59] at him say, "Oh, wow. This is God."
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; But instead of going to see him,
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; we are actually putting him aside
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; and we even deny him when things are
[1:31:11] happening in our life.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, no. God never spoke to
[1:31:16] me, but he did speak to you." You just
[1:31:19] never paid attention to him.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody your wife or your husband
[1:31:26] says, "Stop there. Be careful. Look at
[1:31:28] this." The word says, "Oh, no. That's
[1:31:30] your own opinion."
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; But you don't know what spirit was
[1:31:34] behind that man or that woman to say it.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe it was the same Jesus Christ that
[1:31:41] was actually getting closer to you to
[1:31:43] speak to you about something that you've
[1:31:46] been asking him about.
[1:31:48] and he will use somebody to minister
[1:31:51] directly to you but you miss it
[1:31:54] and you say oh I never denied Jesus
[1:31:56] Christ I always went to church when when
[1:31:59] did I deny Jesus Christ
[1:32:02] because we think Jesus Christ is only in
[1:32:04] the building in the church
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ can be in the house
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; at work so you can deny Jesus Christ in
[1:32:13] the place that you can never even
[1:32:14] imagine
[1:32:16] maybe as a One person, your friend say,
[1:32:18] "Are you a Christian?" Ah, no, no, no.
[1:32:20] I'm not a Christian. I don't believe
[1:32:21] that. You deny Jesus Christ's dead.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "I never the day of judge say,
[1:32:29] "Oh, no, no, no. I don't think I ever
[1:32:30] did. I mean, I'm a good boy. I went to
[1:32:32] church. I'm a good girl. I mean, I kept
[1:32:35] myself.
[1:32:37] I never drunk anything. No spoke." But I
[1:32:39] say, "You deny me."
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; You know something that stood up always
[1:32:44] baffled me just for a minute? Peter
[1:32:46] denied Jesus Christ three times.
[1:32:49] Judas did once.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; You think of it now.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; So that once can mean a lot more than
[1:33:01] you can ever imagine.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; You see why we have to keep our eyes on
[1:33:05] the Jesus.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Jonah told Peter that Peter, I'm getting
[1:33:12] old.
[1:33:14] Are you with me? I'm getting I'm getting
[1:33:17] old, but there is a promise in the word
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; that there's going to be a Messiah. MAY
[1:33:22] HE MAY NOT COME in my days,
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; but my son Jonah, if you see this sign,
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; I want you to be careful. That's the
[1:33:31] Messiah that is coming.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; That's why saints as parents, the
[1:33:37] children may not understand everything,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; but there are things THAT WE MUST TO
[1:33:41] TELL THEM.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; We may not be there.
[1:33:45] But even if they at school,
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; they will remember that.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; That's what the truth must be. Even if
[1:33:53] you hurt,
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; you must tell somebody the truth.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; That little tiny truth
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; can do a lot more than you can even
[1:34:01] imagine.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Maybe your son or your daughter, they're
[1:34:05] going astray. Call them, sit with them,
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; tell them about what God has done in
[1:34:12] your life. You said, "Listen, son.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; I was a sinner.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Tell her, brother.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; I WAS A DRUG ADDICT.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; I was a womanizer.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING, I'VE been there.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; I've been there.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; But if you see me here is because of
[1:34:29] what God has done.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; So, let me tell you something.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; If you want to be successful like your
[1:34:34] father, glory to God.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL, look at
[1:34:38] me. I'M SITTING HERE AS AN EXAMPLE.
[1:34:42] AMEN.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAR THEY WILL BE
[1:34:45] GONE.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; BUT if they look at your life and say,
[1:34:48] "No, I HAVE A FATHER." GLORY TO GOD.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; HE WORK FOR MY FATHER. IT DOESN'T MATTER
[1:34:54] HOW FAR I AM AWAY FROM GOD.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; THE VERY SAME GOD OF MY FATHER WILL COME
[1:35:01] TO rescue me.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; You know, one day, brother Brandham and
[1:35:06] Billy Paul, Billy Paul was working
[1:35:08] closer to his father.
[1:35:10] It happened that Billy Paul stopped
[1:35:12] going astray. Brother Brenham called him
[1:35:15] said, "Billy, come."
[1:35:18] He put his hand like this. He said,
[1:35:19] "Billy,
[1:35:21] this is hell and this is heaven. You are
[1:35:25] right here.
[1:35:27] You have to decide." Sometime children,
[1:35:30] let me say this, the young people,
[1:35:31] please listen to me. You have to make a
[1:35:35] choice. It doesn't matter how many your
[1:35:37] parents forces you to. You have to come
[1:35:40] up to that choice.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how holy your parents
[1:35:43] are.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; You have to make a decision yourself.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; It's not just going to church.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Saints, I I'm talking about because I
[1:35:55] had to make a decision, too.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; I had to make some tough decisions.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Very hard ones.
[1:36:05] And that cost me a lot.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; There's nothing as a as a young boy, as
[1:36:11] a young girl,
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; there's not a decision that you would
[1:36:14] make about Jesus Christ that will be
[1:36:16] easy.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Let me just stop saying it because it's
[1:36:20] the truth.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; You will have to forsake your social
[1:36:23] media.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; You have to forsake your friends,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; your best friends, even your
[1:36:29] relationships. Sometimes
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; you need to cut it off
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; because of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:36] It's not easy.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Those that have been there, they know
[1:36:41] what I'm talking about is the truth.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; and sometime they will call you names.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; They would insult you.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; But the very same people that insult you
[1:36:52] 10 years ago,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; they cannot stand today and do the same.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Since I'm I'm talking about from
[1:36:59] experience. I know what I'm talking
[1:37:00] about.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. have gone in
[1:37:04] the trail that no way they can't find
[1:37:06] the way back.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; That's why sent when the Holy Spirit
[1:37:10] speaking.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; You must take heat to it.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Don't ever deny it. Say, "Oh, no. I I I
[1:37:18] don't care.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; One decision
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; can the next hour or the next year can
[1:37:25] bring you to hell." Yes.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And if you die also you make the right
[1:37:31] the right decision that can bring you to
[1:37:33] the presence of God by one single
[1:37:35] decision that you made.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; And every single one of us
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; we have a responsibility
[1:37:44] to make decisional
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; but who knows which one will be right
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; and wrong.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; We don't know.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; But may God have mercy on us. Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; They get encountered that Philillip
[1:38:03] meets the word. Nathaniel the word
[1:38:07] discern
[1:38:09] what was is what he was doing in secret.
[1:38:15] His time in pray you know sometime you
[1:38:18] pray in secret.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. There is some secret
[1:38:23] prayer that God reward publicly.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; There's some secret prayer when nobody
[1:38:33] sees.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; When you under the table, nobody can see
[1:38:36] you.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; But when it happens,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; God does it in public.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Because the word discerns
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; and the word is still discerning.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Since even in this
[1:38:51] room this morning, there are people that
[1:38:54] prayed last night
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; that God can change this sermon.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord,
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; I can assure you 100% there are people
[1:39:05] that prayed last night
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; that had changed the course of my
[1:39:08] sermon. Yes,
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; because the word of God discerns
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; the same word in plain view doing the
[1:39:19] same thing. Not me. I'm a sinner except
[1:39:21] by grace.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; But it's the PROMISED WORD WHAT GOD had
[1:39:25] promised for this age. He must fulfill
[1:39:28] it.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; And he will use any anybody to do it.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Just because you are the bride of Jesus
[1:39:37] Christ. Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; So your desire, God can fulfill it.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; One day there was a prostitute. How many
[1:39:46] of us love the Lord?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Can we keep it simple like that? Right.
[1:39:49] Is that okay?
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; All right. There was this woman,
[1:39:55] a prostitute,
[1:39:58] a fame woman.
[1:40:02] You say, "Brother Ariel, Jesus not even
[1:40:05] supposed to be talking to a woman of
[1:40:06] such caliber."
[1:40:09] But there was something in that woman
[1:40:11] that many priests did not have.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; She had heard of how you know I'll prove
[1:40:20] it to you that this woman know the word.
[1:40:23] She said it was promised that we will
[1:40:25] see these things
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; while the priest in the the holy people
[1:40:32] of the day
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; could not recognize the word made flesh.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; You see, it's not just coming to church.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; that God would give to you
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; to recognize when the word is passing
[1:40:50] by. Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Abraham one day he was sitting he saw
[1:40:54] three men coming.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; They had dust on their feet.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; But when Abraham looked
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; how did he know that one of them was
[1:41:05] Elohim in human flesh?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come, come. I'm going to wash
[1:41:11] your feet."
[1:41:14] You see, the seed of God will never miss
[1:41:17] the word when it's passing by them.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; You'll never miss it.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how how far away from
[1:41:26] God you are.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; You can be actually drinking alcohol,
[1:41:30] but when the word is passing by your
[1:41:32] table,
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; you stop. You say that's the word.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; You take the bottle and throw it away.
[1:41:41] You say, "I'm going to follow the
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; way."
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; And I don't know about your story. Maybe
[1:41:46] I don't know how where God found found
[1:41:48] you.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know where God found every
[1:41:52] single one of us. Where were we?
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Some people were probably drinking.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; But God just came and spoke to your
[1:42:02] heart. And from that day,
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; it changed. Oh my goodness. Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; To me, he came to me in the parking lot.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; I was in the parking lot outside of the
[1:42:14] church.
[1:42:15] He came to me right there. And I sat
[1:42:17] down. I said, "What happened to me?"
[1:42:21] My older sister, Grace, came one day.
[1:42:23] She saw me crying in the car and asked
[1:42:25] me, "Are you crying?" I said, "I don't
[1:42:28] know. Something had happened to me that
[1:42:31] day."
[1:42:33] So I know what I'm talking about.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; This is about Jesus Christ.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; But we thank the Lord for his grace. Is
[1:42:44] that right?
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; The Lord has been good to us by his
[1:42:50] grace. Amen.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; The woman says, "I know the Messiah
[1:42:55] cometh, which is called Christ. when he
[1:42:57] come he will tell us all things.
[1:43:03] He said, "Woman, give me water."
[1:43:05] And the conversation went on and on. He
[1:43:08] says, "We'll call your husband. I don't
[1:43:10] have a husband." Said, "Yeah, you did
[1:43:11] right. You had five.
[1:43:15] That's true. You had five. The sixth
[1:43:17] one, that's not your husband." She said,
[1:43:19] "No, no, no."
[1:43:21] When she saw the word, when she
[1:43:24] recognized the word, she ran away. He
[1:43:27] says, "Come and see.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Come and see what the prophet have
[1:43:33] said."
[1:43:35] This is now the word is is in flesh
[1:43:38] right there before me.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Say, you see this? The word is coming to
[1:43:46] you and I. No matter where you are,
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; that woman was in the condition of
[1:43:52] prostitution.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; The word came to her in that condition.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; God is not calling you based on where
[1:44:01] you are now. Is looking at his position,
[1:44:05] your position in him.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; God not considering you based on your
[1:44:12] little mistakes there.
[1:44:14] He knows where you are. For the matter
[1:44:16] of fact,
[1:44:18] But when is dealing with your heart is
[1:44:21] calling you because he sees already the
[1:44:24] position that you would have.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; You see how strong the purpose of God is
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; your condition. You might be sick but
[1:44:33] when God is looking at you say you heal.
[1:44:35] Amen.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Gideon was so weak in this place where
[1:44:41] he's hiding from the Medionite
[1:44:44] and then he heard the voice says mighty
[1:44:46] men of valor. He thought like somebody
[1:44:48] else are you talking about somebody
[1:44:50] else? Who? Me? Me?
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; He was in this position where he was so
[1:44:54] weak.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; But God called him based on the position
[1:45:00] that he saw of him.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:03] Maybe this morning you might be very
[1:45:05] unqualified. You say, "Brother, I don't
[1:45:07] I don't feel like I'm worthy of
[1:45:08] anything,
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; but when the word comes to you, he calls
[1:45:14] you based on the position that he knows
[1:45:16] that you're going to be
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; you're going to be."
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Grandma Bay, let me say this.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; I told you last time that I'm going to
[1:45:26] talk when I have the ability to talk.
[1:45:28] Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; God is seeing your healing
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; as a finished work
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; that's what see
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; don't look at the condition
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; but look at the promise
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; say what he said
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; so when you say what Jesus say is if if
[1:45:57] Jesus Jesus himself is saying it.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; You may not understand situation in your
[1:46:05] life,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; but say what God said.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Because it's not you saying it.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; It's him saying it
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; because that's his word.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; But mix it with faith.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Just mix it with faith. see it happen.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; But let's go back to the the religious
[1:46:35] men of the day, the Pharisees. They call
[1:46:39] him They called him Bible. They call him
[1:46:41] names.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; They were blinded to see the reveal word
[1:46:48] for that day.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Now, let me talk about spiritual
[1:46:51] blindness.
[1:46:53] It's very dangerous.
[1:46:55] You would rather be physically blind
[1:46:57] than spiritually blind.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; So in other words, when the word comes,
[1:47:04] you can recognize it.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; You will criticize the word of God. You
[1:47:10] will think, "Oh, this is brother one
[1:47:12] that is saying it. That's just his
[1:47:14] opinion."
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; But if his opinion is in here,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I would take his opinion.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Because that's not his opinion.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; That's the word.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; That's what I said basically.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Are you catching what I'm saying?
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; The word can come and say, "Brother,
[1:47:39] this is what the word said." Oh no,
[1:47:40] brother. I don't see it that way.
[1:47:43] Oh sister, this is the way the word
[1:47:45] require us to leave. Oh no, I don't see
[1:47:47] it that way.
[1:47:49] This is the word that we need to follow.
[1:47:53] The Pharisee came and called him Bezel
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; and Jesus come and say no I'm going to
[1:47:58] start speaking in parable.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; He begin to speak in parable. Before
[1:48:06] even he speaks in parable I want to draw
[1:48:08] something here. Are you with me?
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus comes.
[1:48:14] He has a multitude of people following
[1:48:16] him. Right?
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Many people say wow this is the word.
[1:48:21] Wow, the word Jesus is the Messiah.
[1:48:24] Glory. Look at all the min the the
[1:48:26] miracle that are happening. They're all
[1:48:28] following him. Jesus said, "Are you guys
[1:48:30] sure?"
[1:48:32] He said to them one day, he says, "If
[1:48:34] you don't drink my blood and eat on my
[1:48:37] flesh, you cannot be part of me." The
[1:48:39] 70s said, "No, no, no, no, no, no. What
[1:48:41] are you talking about? Are you you think
[1:48:43] we're vampires here to eat one another
[1:48:45] or what?"
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; But they missed him and left him.
[1:48:50] Are you with me?
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says in the message the
[1:48:53] unveiling of God, he says there are
[1:48:56] things that will be said to stumble you.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; And God purposely
[1:49:05] make it happen.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; He will allow things to be said in a
[1:49:10] certain way that will get you offended
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; because God is separating.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Am I still in the Bible, right? In the
[1:49:23] message, right? Am I still there?
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; 70 people when they heard that, they
[1:49:29] left him. And Jesus turned to the 12,
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; says, "Why don't you guys follow the
[1:49:37] 70?"
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Peter looks at you see when Peter opened
[1:49:42] his mouth, that was not this flesh
[1:49:45] Peter.
[1:49:47] It was a seed germ that spoke out of him
[1:49:50] to say where else can we go?
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Only you
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; you have the word of eternal life.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; So it's not based on our trials.
[1:50:03] It's a matter of what? Revelation.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "No, you are the word.
[1:50:12] There's nowhere else to go." But let me
[1:50:14] shock you again. In the midst of those
[1:50:17] 12, there was still one that was a devil
[1:50:19] that had to hang a little bit longer.
[1:50:22] Judas had to be there.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; For the matter of fact, to fulfill the
[1:50:26] word, Judas had to be there to betray
[1:50:28] him.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? In the back part of
[1:50:32] God's mind, he saw a lamb being slain.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; But the the lamb had to be crucified.
[1:50:41] But there must be somebody that would do
[1:50:44] it.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Do you see the plan of God?
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to deny him and and betray
[1:50:55] him so that the word can be fulfilled.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; In the message end says something. I'm
[1:51:07] just going to paraphrase.
[1:51:09] is reading the book of uh uh of of of
[1:51:12] Luke
[1:51:14] when Jesus was crucified if I'm not
[1:51:16] mistaken. Yes. Luke 23. It says
[1:51:21] there
[1:51:23] they crucify him.
[1:51:27] Are we are we together?
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; There they crucify him. Brother Brennham
[1:51:34] says there where what he says there. It
[1:51:39] says there is was the most holy city in
[1:51:45] the world which was Jerusalem.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; There that was the most holy city in the
[1:51:54] world. Jerusalem.
[1:51:56] They it says the religious the most
[1:52:00] religious people
[1:52:05] the most religious what the Pharisees
[1:52:08] they could trust them where they came
[1:52:09] from
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; but they are the one that crucified the
[1:52:13] word of God the word made flesh.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; To crucify
[1:52:20] means the most sinful death you could
[1:52:23] ever imagine. Let me say it this way.
[1:52:26] There's always pictures of Jesus
[1:52:28] covered. Is that right?
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; He was crucified naked
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; without clothes on. I mean, some people
[1:52:39] are being shocked. It's the truth.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; And exposed
[1:52:46] before everyone naked on the cross for
[1:52:50] you and I.
[1:53:01] the the most shameful death that could
[1:53:03] ever
[1:53:05] strip him, kill them
[1:53:09] based on the public capital punishment,
[1:53:12] condemned by the people that he came to
[1:53:13] save.
[1:53:15] But yet the word of God was still in
[1:53:21] plan view.
[1:53:24] Are you with me?
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; The word was in plain view exposed
[1:53:32] naked.
[1:53:37] Even in that condition,
[1:53:40] there was one man, one of the
[1:53:43] malfactors, a chief that was on the
[1:53:45] right side or on the left, I can't
[1:53:47] remember.
[1:53:49] The other one said, "Oh, no, no, no, no.
[1:53:51] If you are really God like you know calm
[1:53:54] down you know you can speak this word
[1:53:56] you know all of that right but one say
[1:53:58] said no don't say it we are all guilty
[1:54:01] we've done we have done wrong
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; but this guy is right this man is just
[1:54:07] how did he know that Jesus was just
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; or was right
[1:54:12] because of the sour
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; the thief at the cross saw the fountain
[1:54:19] in that day
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:54:21] He met the word
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; while the word was being crucified and
[1:54:26] exposed naked.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; So even in our generation
[1:54:32] when people are crucifying the word,
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; you still have the chance to meet the
[1:54:38] word in that condition.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Let me say something that will shock
[1:54:42] you.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; There are many things going on on
[1:54:45] internet. You don't know that the seed
[1:54:48] of God. There's some people that never
[1:54:51] heard of William Brandon
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; until they heard something negative and
[1:54:55] they really wanted to know.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; They went to dig and say, "Oh, who is
[1:54:59] this person really?"
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; But when they stop following the word,
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; they say no, this is the truth.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; So God is using people. It seems to be
[1:55:12] negative
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; but yet God is doing something.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; There are people that are being saved in
[1:55:21] the midst of that. The world is being
[1:55:23] crucified on one end. The other way
[1:55:25] people are being saved.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; The word was at the cross exposed naked
[1:55:38] in plain view. the king of glory.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; But while he was being crucified at the
[1:55:46] cross, something happened in the
[1:55:49] tabernacle.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Are you Are we together?
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me that same picture again.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Right.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus the word
[1:56:06] is exposed naked on the cross. Is that
[1:56:09] right?
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; But as he is dying over there, he said,
[1:56:13] "It's finished.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; I have fulfilled
[1:56:18] what I intended to do." Glory to God.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; And this veil
[1:56:26] rented from the top
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; to the bottom.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; That was a very tall I mean it was a a
[1:56:33] big veil.
[1:56:35] is to show you it was not a man handling
[1:56:39] the veil to be rent.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; That's was God of heaven that rented
[1:56:43] that veil.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Why did he rent the veil?
[1:56:48] Because there was now blood
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; available for you and I
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; to enter into that place
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; and be changed.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:04] Now the mercy seat, glory to God, is now
[1:57:08] in plain view.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; The word that was hid
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; from people,
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; the word now is in plain view.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Anybody can now access.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham says in a message
[1:57:26] earnestly contending for the faith
[1:57:28] preached in 1953.
[1:57:30] It says now in that day God guarded the
[1:57:34] tree that keep them from getting in
[1:57:37] getting it. And now the sword. Oh, glory
[1:57:41] to God. The sword that the the the
[1:57:43] cheruban the angel was holding. Brother
[1:57:46] says the sword is turning right back the
[1:57:50] other way,
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; running them right into the tree
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; so that they will receive the life.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:59] driving people, hurting them up to the
[1:58:04] tree of life.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; The sword that hindered them to enter,
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; the same sword has turned the other way
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; is pointing you back now to the tree of
[1:58:16] life.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Why is he POINTING YOU BACK? BECAUSE the
[1:58:21] mercy seat is in plain view.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT WAS NOW IS IN PLAIN VIEW.
[1:58:27] YES.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; It says in another message, the the true
[1:58:35] vine preaching 1956,
[1:58:37] it says, "Oh, in other word, I am the
[1:58:39] tree of life from the garden of Eden.
[1:58:42] And if they eat of the tree of death,
[1:58:45] they die. If they eat of the tree of
[1:58:48] life, they leave." It says the Holy
[1:58:51] Spirit guarded the tree of life until
[1:58:56] the atonement was made and now the Holy
[1:59:00] Spirit is running the people to the tree
[1:59:03] of life.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; It says Adam and Eve was trying to get
[1:59:06] the tree of life. Now the children are
[1:59:10] trying to stay away from the tree of
[1:59:13] life.
[1:59:16] Adam desired to have the tree of life.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; It says today people are running away
[1:59:23] from the tree of life.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; So the sun has turned to point you to
[1:59:30] the tree of life
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; and people are running away.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Our ancestors
[1:59:37] the patriarch
[1:59:39] they desire
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; to all glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; They desired
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; to be partakers OF THAT TREE OF LIFE.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; But you and I, WHY ARE WE RUNNING AWAY
[1:59:51] FROM THE TREE OF LIFE?
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; It says the Holy Spirit was guarding it,
[2:00:01] right? It says now it's bringing them to
[2:00:04] it and they refuse to hear the Holy
[2:00:07] Ghost, the Holy Spirit's voice because
[2:00:10] the same adversary that caused them to
[2:00:12] sin in the beginning is keeping them
[2:00:16] away FROM THE TREE OF LIFE.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; The same Satan that caused you to enter
[2:00:27] to sin
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; is keeping you also away
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; to return back
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; to that tree of life.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; What is that tree of life? Jesus Christ.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; That's why saint we want to see Jesus
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; and his program
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; when the word is in blind view.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:00:52] Brother Benham says something in Hebrew
[2:00:53] chapter uh chapter 2 second part it says
[2:00:56] the Bible said he ascended on high right
[2:01:01] this is after the veil had rented. Are
[2:01:03] you with me?
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; He ascended on high and give gift unto
[2:01:08] men. There was an atmosphere. Watch
[2:01:10] this. Watch this saints. It says there
[2:01:12] was an atmosphere hang over the earth
[2:01:16] and darkness and gloom and death and
[2:01:18] weary. The prayers
[2:01:21] could not come up because the atonement
[2:01:25] was not made.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Even our prayer were hindered.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; But he broke through the veil.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; He opened up the way. HE BROKE THE VEIL
[2:01:41] OF SICKNESS.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; He broke the veil of sin. He broke the
[2:01:45] veil of weary. He broke the veil of
[2:01:47] depression. He broke every veil
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; and made an eyeway from the wayfair men
[2:01:55] fearing men walking up the king
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; highway.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; So your sickness,
[2:02:05] your depression,
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; whatever you can call it,
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; that veil was broken.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Let me bring it home a little bit.
[2:02:14] He rented the veil
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; of what is keeping you off from the
[2:02:19] God's blessing.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; He broke the veil of that keep YOU OFF
[2:02:27] OF GOD'S JOY.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Of God healing.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Of God peace.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; He broke even the veil of depression.
[2:02:35] Yes,
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; of anxieties,
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; OF CANCER,
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS,
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, and all of it, even
[2:02:47] generation curses.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; This is what our family will do. But the
[2:02:54] power when he broke that veil, the veil
[2:02:56] means flesh. Amen.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; He give access
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; for you to actually s let me say this.
[2:03:07] If you believe the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:03:08] there's nothing that he cannot break.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; May God have mercy on us.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; If those things are still lingering,
[2:03:17] means that we need more grace. Lord,
[2:03:19] help me. I need to read more. There's
[2:03:21] something somewhere. Something is off
[2:03:22] somewhere.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; May God help us. Amen.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; But now God I'm entering into and I'm
[2:03:30] going to close. Are are you with me?
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; But now this is the part where God now
[2:03:37] he promised God has given us a promise.
[2:03:41] Jesus paid the price. Right?
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; That's one part of of redemption.
[2:03:47] Redemption is paying the price. If you
[2:03:48] have lost something because Adam lost
[2:03:51] the title deed, right? He he lost his
[2:03:55] position.
[2:03:56] But now the requirement was death. Are
[2:03:59] you with me?
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; But Jesus Christ died,
[2:04:04] right? Instead of you dying because you
[2:04:05] were a sinner,
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; he died for you instead.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; He opened that channel so your prayer
[2:04:12] can be answered.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; That's one part of paying the price is
[2:04:16] one part of redemption.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; There's another part of redemption that
[2:04:19] has to do with claiming.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; So he has to come the second time to
[2:04:27] claim what he had already paid the price
[2:04:30] for.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; SO IF HE PAID THE PRICE FOR YOU, this is
[2:04:34] the time that is coming to claim you.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; To say this is the blood that was shed,
[2:04:42] this these are the the the requirements
[2:04:45] that it required death. I died already,
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; but I I'm coming now to claim them. But
[2:04:52] now to claim these people, you must have
[2:04:56] a powerful word. It must be the same
[2:05:01] word in plain view
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; to bring you back.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Therefore, God, the same way he did for
[2:05:07] the first coming, he's doing it for the
[2:05:10] second coming.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; The first coming, he came to pay the
[2:05:14] price.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; The second coming has to do with the
[2:05:17] rapture. God.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; But now between now and the rapture,
[2:05:20] there are things that he has to do. The
[2:05:22] same thing he did, right?
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Because the end of that first coming was
[2:05:26] his death.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; How many of us agree?
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; And for the second coming, the end of it
[2:05:33] will be THE RAPTURE OF THE CHURCH.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; But before that, Jesus was still
[2:05:37] operating.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; He was still revealing himself to
[2:05:41] people. Now, there is a promise here I
[2:05:45] want you to read to read with me.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Can you give God a hand to clap, please?
[2:05:56] He's worthy. He is worthy to be to be
[2:05:59] praised.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 17. We We coming down.
[2:06:04] Still bear with me. Still here.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; All right. Matthew 17:10.
[2:06:17] And the disciple asked him saying, "Why
[2:06:21] then said the scribe that Elias
[2:06:24] must come first,
[2:06:27] right?
[2:06:28] Must first come."
[2:06:31] Uh can you can you go back a little bit?
[2:06:33] Verse 10. Okay. And the disciple asked
[2:06:36] him saying, "Why then the scribes
[2:06:41] said the scribe that Elias must first
[2:06:44] come?" Are you with me?
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; The following one.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto them,
[2:06:52] Elias,
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Shall first come and restore what?
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; All things. Are you with Are you with
[2:07:02] me?
[2:07:06] But they said unto you, but I said unto
[2:07:09] you, Eli Elias is come already. So who
[2:07:14] is he referring to?
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are you seeing that
[2:07:20] right?
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; And they knew him not.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; So there is a prophet. There's a Elijah
[2:07:28] that will come. Not everybody will
[2:07:30] recognize him.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Right? Is that a word?
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; So John came but they didn't recognize
[2:07:36] John.
[2:07:38] It says they knew him not but have done
[2:07:41] unto him whatsoever they listed likewise
[2:07:44] shall also the son of man suffer of
[2:07:47] them.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Then the disciple understood that he
[2:07:54] spake
[2:07:55] unto them of John the Baptist.
[2:07:59] So now Jesus himself is saying there's
[2:08:04] going to be an Elijah.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the word of Jesus?
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; It says I know Elias has come which was
[2:08:12] John the Baptist.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; But he's saying here there must be
[2:08:16] another Elijah that will restore what?
[2:08:19] All things.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; So the promise of Malachi 4 is not
[2:08:25] something that we thinking in our mind.
[2:08:27] No, it is in the word.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; It is in the word.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Now Elias
[2:08:37] when it comes because the spirit of
[2:08:39] Elijah comes five times.
[2:08:43] God used the man dies but the spirit
[2:08:45] remained. So he used the spirit of
[2:08:47] Elijah five times.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; It was Elijah the tishbite. Right? When
[2:08:52] he was raptured, he Elisha received the
[2:08:55] double portion of his spirit.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; And then John the Baptist is also Elias.
[2:09:01] Right?
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; And then if you read Genesis chap I mean
[2:09:04] Revelation chapter 11, he speaks of
[2:09:06] another one. But between John the
[2:09:09] Baptist and the Elijah of Revelation
[2:09:12] chapter 11, there is another one that
[2:09:14] has to come for the gentle people.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; You see that? Now when WE COME TO
[2:09:19] MALACHI chapter 4, let's read it
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; and we will tie Malachi 4 to Luke 17:30
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; and Revelation chapter 10:7. We will tie
[2:09:28] all of these things for a purpose of
[2:09:30] restoration of all things
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; because God want you to receive the same
[2:09:34] authority
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; but it must be a message
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; that will be so POWERFUL TO SEEK THE
[2:09:41] world to bring you back to that place.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Malachi chapter 4
[2:09:50] verse 5.
[2:09:54] Behold, you see behold again.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Pay attention.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you
[2:10:03] good shepherd fellowship.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; I send you Elijah
[2:10:10] the prophet before the coming of the
[2:10:13] dreadful day of the Lord.
[2:10:17] When John the Baptist came, there was
[2:10:20] not judgment day, right? You see that?
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; This has to do with what will happen
[2:10:25] after us here.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a judgment.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a judgment.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; He shall turn the heart of the father to
[2:10:36] the children and the heart of the
[2:10:37] children unto the father, lest I come to
[2:10:40] spite the earth.
[2:10:42] Are you seeing that?
[2:10:44] Revelation chapter 10 where we read
[2:10:49] verse 7
[2:10:52] but in the days of the voice of the
[2:10:54] seventh angel
[2:10:56] when is begin to sound
[2:10:59] the mystery of God that's singular there
[2:11:02] is something I was reading is this the
[2:11:04] end time the end of of time brother
[2:11:07] Brandham in 240 a paragraph 240
[2:11:10] something down going down he's sewing
[2:11:13] the mysteries of God,
[2:11:15] right? It stopped bringing up the
[2:11:18] mysteries of God, the mystery of the
[2:11:19] kingdom, the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:11:21] without sensation, you know, all of
[2:11:23] these things because throughout the
[2:11:25] ages, people begin to baptize in the
[2:11:27] name of the father, son, and the holy
[2:11:28] ghost.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; But the Elijah here has to restore all
[2:11:32] things.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; So in the middle of the church ages,
[2:11:36] people stop preaching things that was
[2:11:38] contrary to the word. Are you with me?
[2:11:41] But now the ministry of Elijah is to
[2:11:44] come to bring us back in line
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; because you cannot be restored if you
[2:11:50] don't know the full truth.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Because the restoration is the power.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; You you see what I'm saying? You cannot
[2:11:58] be you cannot be brought back if you
[2:12:01] don't know what had happened, what had
[2:12:04] caused men to fall.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Are are you with me?
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now if you read in revelation
[2:12:10] chapter 10:7 it says it as a single
[2:12:14] mystery. Are you with me? is saying it
[2:12:17] here in in in singular but in many
[2:12:21] messages but they're going to put it in
[2:12:22] peril. Why? Because there is a single
[2:12:26] mystery
[2:12:28] the all this mystery are sum up into one
[2:12:31] mystery and that mystery is Jesus
[2:12:33] Christ.
[2:12:36] So once Jesus Christ opens up to you,
[2:12:39] when the word is in in full view, you
[2:12:42] understand his plan.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Are are you with me?
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; So the word when Jesus Christ is open to
[2:12:50] you, it shows you what was his
[2:12:52] intention, what had happened in the
[2:12:54] garden of Eden, the things that we know,
[2:12:56] the mystery truth that we know that he
[2:12:57] wasn't an apple,
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; right? These are the things that bring
[2:13:01] us back to the knowledge of God.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; You see, oh wow, I know now what had
[2:13:06] happened. I know my enemy and I know my
[2:13:09] savior.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Because the truth set you free.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; It must be a full truth for you to
[2:13:18] realize.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Let me bring something here just to add.
[2:13:23] When you look at the life of Elijah,
[2:13:25] Elijah when he went to more car, the
[2:13:28] people were between two opinion. Are you
[2:13:30] with me?
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; You the you you read the Bible, right?
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; The people were between two opinion.
[2:13:35] There's one thing that Elijah did.
[2:13:38] Elijah did what he did is he restore the
[2:13:42] altar, right? He restored the altar and
[2:13:46] then he told the people if God literally
[2:13:49] do this thing then you guys should
[2:13:51] believe it, right? Because They were
[2:13:52] between opinion. They didn't know what
[2:13:53] to choose.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; But when the fire fell,
[2:13:58] the heart of the people would turn to
[2:14:01] God.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; So the fire that falls change our heart.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Now if you look in the tabernacle,
[2:14:11] there is the breast altar, there is the
[2:14:14] lav, and then if you enter later on, you
[2:14:17] see the fire of God. You see that,
[2:14:19] right? We spoke about it. Now when
[2:14:21] Elijah begins to rebuild the altar,
[2:14:25] he had a altar made of bricks. But
[2:14:29] around the bricks, if you read the
[2:14:31] Bible, around it, he had waters pour
[2:14:35] around it, which is in the form of this.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; But the last part is when the fire came
[2:14:42] down and burned the sacrifice. Amen.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE SACRIFICE WAS BURNED AT THE
[2:14:47] ALTAR, then the heart of the people
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; will turn to God.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; You see that?
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; So there must be a message
[2:14:59] that will cause us to return to God.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; So God has to fully reveal himself
[2:15:07] first.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Do do you believe
[2:15:11] that?
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:15] God again in our midst
[2:15:19] he will do the same thing that's why
[2:15:20] sometime when we see things happening in
[2:15:23] the ministry of brother Bham is to let
[2:15:26] us know that this is the word again how
[2:15:29] many people have criticized him
[2:15:32] but yet the word was made flesh
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; for a purpose because according to Luke
[2:15:39] chapter 17 let's read it and we're going
[2:15:41] to close there do you love the
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Lord Amen.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to close there.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; But before I close there, brother Bam
[2:15:46] says something loudian church 8. He
[2:15:48] says, "Now this messenger of Malachi 4
[2:15:51] and Revelation 10 is going to do to do
[2:15:54] two things." Are you with me?
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; It says one, according to Malachi 4, he
[2:16:01] will turn the heart of the children to
[2:16:03] the fathers.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; That's the first thing. Are you with me?
[2:16:06] Amen.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; It says two, he will reveal the
[2:16:10] mysteries
[2:16:12] of the seven thunders in revelation 10
[2:16:14] which are the revelation contained in
[2:16:17] the seven seal. He will be this divine
[2:16:21] mystery truth.
[2:16:23] So the mystery truth
[2:16:26] right
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; is those mystery truth that will
[2:16:29] literally turn your heart to God. Amen.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; But if those mystery truth are not
[2:16:35] revealed, your heart will not be turned.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; So we need a message. We need an Elijah
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; with a message to turn our heart back to
[2:16:48] God.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Then we can see God clearly.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; we cannot be turned until the fire of
[2:16:56] the Holy Ghost comes and burns sin out
[2:16:58] of us.
[2:17:01] The there must be a fire
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; saint. Once again, the word is working
[2:17:08] in our midst. The same word in full
[2:17:11] view.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; There was few days ago I've been having
[2:17:14] this kind of experiment experiences
[2:17:17] you know in the prayer meeting different
[2:17:19] things start happening
[2:17:22] and I was just praying about this. I'm
[2:17:24] like Lord what does this thing means?
[2:17:27] Those that are there, they know what I'm
[2:17:28] talking about.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; God is doing things in the most simplest
[2:17:34] way
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; because our religion just stopped here
[2:17:38] at church.
[2:17:39] But God is doing more outside of this
[2:17:42] building.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Even when it cames to the ministry of
[2:17:48] brother Bernham, the third pool, you
[2:17:50] would realize most of them were
[2:17:52] happening outside of the church.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; It happened with
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah,
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; it happened with his wife that had a a
[2:17:59] growth on on her outside of the church.
[2:18:02] So say let me say this in closing.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; God is in full view in plain view but
[2:18:10] revealing himself in simplicity.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; God is working in silence and when when
[2:18:19] we are not even in church
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; God is working. How many of us
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; have seen the word in plan view?
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[2:18:30] forever. He has given you a message and
[2:18:34] he begins to disclose his secrets to
[2:18:36] you.
[2:18:38] He start telling you the mystery that
[2:18:41] was hid from the foundation of the world
[2:18:44] because there is a purpose. You as the
[2:18:46] bride of Jesus Christ, you have
[2:18:48] something to do before we leave this
[2:18:51] earth. You have a ministry.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; The bride would have a ministry.
[2:18:57] But we have to look in the word. We have
[2:18:59] to see Christ in this program. You love
[2:19:01] the Lord.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Shall we stand?
[2:19:05] Shall we stand?
[2:19:08] Oh, glory to God.
[2:19:14] We trusted the Lord that this can be of
[2:19:16] a blessing.
[2:19:23] Be so sweet to trust in Jesus.
[2:19:31] Be so sweet
[2:19:34] to trust
[2:19:36] in Jesus.
[2:19:39] Just to take him at his word.
[2:19:47] us to rest
[2:19:50] upon
[2:19:52] his promises.
[2:19:55] Just to
[2:19:58] thus
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; I have proved
[2:20:12] him more.
[2:20:17] Jesus.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus pray.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; All for grace to trust.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:20:35] sweet trust
[2:20:37] in Jesus.
[2:20:40] Just to truth
[2:20:43] his cleansing
[2:20:45] blood
[2:20:47] and he
[2:20:50] simple faith
[2:20:52] to
[2:20:55] lead the
[2:20:58] link.
[2:21:00] Jesus, Jesus,
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; how I prove
[2:21:13] the more
[2:21:17] Jesus.
[2:21:19] Jesus,
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; blessed Jesus.
[2:21:25] Oh, for grace to trust
[2:21:30] him more.
[2:21:32] Yes, it's sweet to trust in Jesus
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; just from sin
[2:21:43] and
[2:21:45] to sin
[2:21:47] just from Jesus
[2:21:54] taking life and rest
[2:21:58] and joy. Jesus, Jesus,
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:22:04] Jesus.
[2:22:06] How I trust him.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; How
[2:22:11] prove
[2:22:15] oh
[2:22:17] Jesus,
[2:22:19] Jesus,
[2:22:20] precious
[2:22:22] Jesus.
[2:22:24] Oh, for grace to trust him more.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad. Oh, I learned to trust him.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Preious
[2:22:41] Jesus,
