perfect realization and sinking down in our hearts race along a lot less you have to see you praise the Lord and I'm going to trust the law to light in the direction we're going to God amen I've been certain Sunday we were gonna start speaking on all that the father has given me and kind of thinking now just meditating preparing for the service and the Lord start dealing with my heart on something in and I started thinking about it and looking in the word a little bit so I might just you know give it to the law to nineteen eyes that he would come and bless us in a special way praising me but we want to thank the Lord for His goodness and His mercy you know sometimes God will inspire us you know leaders in a setting Direction sometimes you would be wondering why didn't you know you just but even as a preacher you preach the word and yet you know you go home and then go start dealing with you personally and you just a saying oh my goodness what you know what what a beautiful thing in you know needing more of God's grace I'll say this tonight just just in the space of the week you know there was those some few things that happen and really kind of there with me personally too and Sunday we just you know but every told me he was having an interview on Monday and I just said it from the back of the Pope reading you know actually we pray for him and I know in time pass he has sheer you know some personal things you know I mean birding in and he desired if if it is the word of the Lord you know he would like to to use many sorta like the backside of the desert you know I get a job and stay here and and you know brother Ariel he has travelled a little bit around the country and you know he's a nice young man it's a good musician there are many many big churches that want for him to to be there you know so when he told me that is where I would just pray you know you know so and then he would say that to me after him you know every time we talk he would say there to me often well you know I never really took it like trying to flatter me but I just say well you know because there is one thing I believe like a preacher is God that plains people he men and gods Plains people in the sword that he knows that it's good for you he might out roots you from one place and plains you to another place but it has to be in the right season I believe that I mean we even talked about that some time ago and you know he was trying to share that with meaning and you know and so but Monday he went for his job interview and then he called me and they are talking to call me and after the interview I wanted to know how he gold and he called me and told me you know of the interview went well and but then he told me something that I can afford challenged my faith it ominous is a well it's a bird wanna mind my permit work pay me that was given to me after my study were expire on Friday I got it I got a I got a wishes this coming Friday I got a letter from the school and even you know from from the immigration and and you know and they keep asking why why Hawaii not find a job yet and and in order that I don't want to go into some different things let me just stay where I am you know I know we talked about it and he just kept telling me well I think the Lord is trying my patience you know but I think the law was giving him patience praise the Lord and so when he said that to me it was just like the light came on and I was saying to myself I said oh my goodness this brother have told me over and over you know he would love to find a job here in and you know stay here until the Lord can leave him X word and I you know I really never took time to pray about it I mean I mean set a time aside and just prayed about it and realizing that his job dammit will be we aspired on on on Friday if we either be that he would either have to go back to school or maybe he would have to I don't know why I'm not an immigration officer you know so we talked a little bit and after we dropped the phone I really felt challenged see my heart I said I felt a little bit guilty and and I'm saying to myself dear I'm saying yura said I've been preaching on the bounding power and our power is the keeping power and if it'll if it's left with me I love to keep him here and why - I use that since and I just started praying about it I just I just repented to the Lord and said father you know just you know and because I don't like I don't like pulling on people personally I like to for it to be a revelation you know like a conviction you know and so I prayed about it and all through the week I would just you know think about reading and just oh God you know you have to do something this young man you know stated high school you know finish college and can't find a job law you know how he trusted you and you know he did the best thing that he could do you know and everything and I was just praying so I talked this morning after we got to praying and we prayed about at home as well I'm gonna call Burt a scab a car better scale I would talk to him well he said he knows people around you know but what would happen this is Wednesday today this Wednesday and it's Friday the job he made will expire and between Wednesday even if he has an interview on Thursday they have to look at everything and decide so thinking on that as soon as I came out of the elevator he called me so I was just thinking about this young man he called me and and he just told me I got the job [Music] you know there were just nothing in there I could break about affair so sorry for myself you know and I like I tell people we go through things and and and and and many times we go through those things and the law bring us out from the beginning to the end if we really want to be sincere you look in the middle you get nothing to be praised for praise the Lord because sometimes we don't have the right attitude when we go in through the stage because we don't understand it amen all right I mean I would just don't find it I just do that I say Oh God oh you don't cease to surprise us so we want to thank the Lord for daddy man so congratulations on your first job praise the Lord and we pray that the Lord will be able to bless our brother anything said that make it tough when I spoke to him on Monday he says I need to get a job in my career I say you make it worse [Laughter] if it was just a job as a coming town you know go to war my father job brother you know but the Lord granted is hard desired a man I believe it that is a stepping stone and and then add another one to that also kind of fun hit me hard was brother Ezekiel you know but Ezekiel was on his way to Minneapolis when he called me there was we were having a communion service so I was I was waiting on the convenient service in the office after the morning service and then he called me and I just I just happened to be right there saw the car that see the strange know my just talking say god bless you brother you better one yeah you know her family give you my number am i me give me your number I'm on my way to Minneapolis and he came and we met and we fellowship a little bit and he told me that you know the Lord laid him down and and you know the law able to find them a place shattering down and it seems to be that the landlord needed his house back and such a short notice and he need a back and he needed now so where Zika was helping me to do some work at the house and and when he told me there my spirit just dropped I mean that's a law here is this brother trying to help me do some work around the house my house and his family don't have a place to be you know and we prayed about it and then you know tension start building in the man leading his house back for whatsoever purpose and and you know he best know and you know so we talked about it and then he just I think I think the same Monday too you know he just called me and told me and you know I come

as well you know if the Lord told you to come here then you know yo you wait for him to tell you to go back it should be him telling you to go back maybe you never heard him well or something else you know but I've always I always believed that you know sometimes you move to a place if you are following the leadership of the Lord God's gonna prove you amen he's going to prove you everywhere to prove whether you really believe that he said what he said to you and I was all I'm also grateful that a law kind of a bit there Amen so we want to thank the Lord for His goodness let's just stand to

of Paul so that from his body were brought on to the sake handkerchiefs or apron and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirit went out of them Amy let's pray father we want to thank you tonight once again Lord you are the one father that has provided this love that can pardon when you look beyond all our faults and yet you meet our knees Lord a strength Lord that comes from you Almighty God we commit ourselves to be now for the word that we have read we want to pray that the Holy Spirit who take complete control tonight bless us father in Jesus name we pray amen Amy Allah bless you may have you see it's hard to close on inspiration when it's on your heart annoying and God is just just dealing with you on it and it's just it's hard to to get away from it and what I was thinking about as I look to the scripture over here in the book of Acts is the beginning of the efficient church praise the Lord and in this efficient church actually begins like verse one who tells us there when Paul met Apollo's and he met this man that was baptized by John the Baptist you think about it now John the Baptist came preaching a message of repentance the voice of one crying in the wilderness and calling the people unto repentance praise the Lord another joint message right at the river the Pharisees sent their spokesman our investigators to go and ask John if he was the Messiah he said no I was not the Messiah and he identified himself with the prophecy of Isaiah and different prophecies in the Bible but then John also testified when he said there is one among you amen in a sense there is one among us and I believe there is one among us tonight praise the Lord there is one among you whose shoe lashes I'm now watered to lose praise the Lord amen John was actually identifying that that the Messiah was there why because back in the wilderness the Lord told him that amen and-and-and-and all of these his disciples and the people that follow him there you know the the hell his preaching and I mean John was a man that the heart message with our compromising amen we know the story how he went into the wilderness at nine years oh he came out at the age of Terry praise the Lord and and and this boy that I mean he was taught by God God taught him in the school of nature praise the Lord and he came out and now even fear in the faces of the people that will come to his meeting praise the Lord he talked to Harold right in his face and said it's not lawful for you to take your brother's wife amen and and I mean in in I mean in people John had a message they had the burning power now you think about it that was even before the the Holy Ghost was given but year when John preaches his message it was it was I mean it was enough to keep people in their tracks praise the Lord and I don't know where Apollo's was when John introduced Jesus Christ that day and he said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and we realized it was that day that Andrews and and and another follow Jesus prays alone but yet there was people that stayed on the John ministry and I believe Apollo's was one of them because he never even knew about Jesus I mean he never even knew about the one that joined him to introduce and he was faithful to join ministry even after John was taken of the scene praise the Lord I mean he was so kept by this word he was kept by the revival he was kept by the things that he heard on the River Jordan or wherever John was preaching kept him all of those years even when John was thinking of the scene Jesus came into his ministry I policy were he was there believing to see the Messiah believing to see the things that John preached but he never came across Jesus it's almost like the both of them were going in parallel a direction and he could he meet praise the Lord and yet Paul comes to this place in him he met this man and he realized that there is something about this man he's holding something this man have a truth experience but yet he don't know anything about the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen the Word of God would keep you there is enough power in this world to keep you to keep you in your trials amen praise the Lord but this is what I want for us to look at tonight so John Paul comes here and then he introduced the Lord Jesus we know the story of Paul also he acts this man have you received the Holy Ghost you see I've never heard anything about the Holy Ghost wow man you have not heard anything about the Holy Ghost and you have such a devotion you have social life praise the Lord then if you have the Holy Ghost what are you going to do then praise the Lord so right here and I Paul you know told them about the Lord Jesus baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and they received the Holy Ghost praise the Lord Amen now Paul realize you know when I was talking on the message born at midnight I Pulis was one of those people are hiding my mind to talk about because he was born another revival but because he had a truth experience on earth a revival a kept him for the next revival praise the Lord because he had a truth experience he had he had a birth he had a conviction he he understood that when John when John said repent of your sin I mean John were getting a street and you will meet the tax collectors and he were accident to repent stop being stopped being caught up in corruption praise the Lord but our palace was born after midnight because he was he was net in Jesus revival praise the Lord but he had a birth and it kept him for the next revival are we together praise the Lord so but after a year we see here that when when when he received the Holy Ghost and and in everything and then Paul decided to stay right here with these people that was the birth of the efficient Church amen Paul stay right there with those people and then he taught them in the word and the scripture when I had and he led us to know yet in verse 7 and verse 6 and when Paul haar lay hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12 so the efficient church was born with twelve members in that church that was the beginning of the efficient church are we together Amen taking sides of Jesus brother Burnham also said that that and and and Paul spent some time with these people if you read the scripture down a little bit you will see we get in there and the Bible says and he went into the synagogue and speak boiling for the space of three months disputing and and he stayed there with those people now this is the beginning of the efficient Church that that's what I want to I want to establish here and but I want to show I want to bring out something here better Branham says God keep his word and I don't have it updated like I said I didn't send any note back there but just follow me tonight he says did you notice in a Bible a few minutes now Paul didn't have and in trouble with their with the church at Ephesus there was Khalid why these people like I said they had an experience amen praise the Lord they had an experience from from from from honor Jones revival praise the Lord they were looking into the scripture that was the thing that attracted poor to them there was something about these people are we together he says there were scholars there were men who understood but his trouble was in with the the Roman Church and he assaulted them before God and he talks of their faith but that but the trouble he had was waived with the Corinthians the Corinthians was the place that he had trouble for they could not take the word each one wanted a sensation amen what is it when I come and warn you Paul says one God a tongue and one goddess a man one God this all dead some kind of a little little foolish sensation he said you you believers but you are not established established word in the world now you have to know their gifts and calling our with our repentance amen the Corinthians were not established in a world but there were the P put the hi gifts praise the Lord so that that's the problem that Paul was having with him he was seeing the manifestation of true give him on the people and what what in the balance that Paul was trying to bring the Corinthians church is that every gift must come under the word amen gifts don't control the word is the word that controls the gift are we together praise the Lord but you think about it this church and that how all of this problem yet it was the it was the most gifted church if we never had the Corinthian church we will never had an order of how the gift must manifest among us because Paul never taught that in the ephesian church he never taught that in the painting in the Roman Church he had to teach it where the problem was praise the Lord gifted people always have problem amen no it's a truth why because the devil is to destroy thy gift amen if the devil can can can can trouble the people that has a gift and call him from God and put them to the place worthy I even confused of what God has given to them then you can never use it I mean if he can ever get you to the place for you to doubt what God has given to you you're never going to use it are we together so that was one of the people and and and and what Paul was trying to do was to establish him in the word now you know Paul who do you have preached things to the to the Corinthian church and come back and preach it to the the efficient church or something like that in the Church of Thessalonica and and and and something as he preached the same gospel everywhere but that efficient Church he he could speak to them some of the great mystery now the thing I'm trying to bring here tonight is to tell you they're tough you don't don't despise your ally beginning don't despise the things that God do in your life when he's dealing with you praise the Lord Amen because he dared he dare waved I pull-ups when this sad on a joint ministry just imagine it was just a six-month ministry John had a six-month ministry to introduce the Messiah and you think about it as six more minutes trick will keep a man for that amount of years amen a six more ministry can impart a man's life that's why brother Branham says Paul will go to a place and just and just bring one soul to God and then when he comes back he can see teddy amen because for the matter of fat people like the prophet of God says every man must have the opportunity to hear the gospel once it takes just one preaching to change your life praise the Lord it takes one preaching for God to talk to be able to quicken that seed in you all the rest will just be water and sunshine for the sea to grow praise the Lord but took one preaching to make the cross rear to you it took one preaching to make this gospel truth to you praise the Lord and that's where the anchor holes and Paul I mean John revival kept these people for all of these years Paul came down there and saw what was happening he spent some time with them and different things was happening there now tonight I want to drive into another direction here with this whole thing that is on my mind and the scripture says as Paul there was a lot of miracles that was performed different things were happening right there in that little church of a people that knew who called him I mean the knew this was the efficient church where Paul says God have chosen you from the foundation of the world the book of efficient we write it is this church that Paul was preaching those things though they knew their place in Christ and Bertram says the reason why Paul preached those things to the efficient church is for them not to feel saved today and tomorrow they feel us he was trying to work out from their mind that God do not lost what he has saved amen now all the father has given me we come and there is no man that can pluck them out of my hands that's what he was trying to get get away from him listen to this Abraham he says no man can come to me except my father draw him first Oh all the father has given me we come there you are so when you have their leaves little twinkling in your heart to come to Christ you do a right away because that's the greatest thing that we ever happened to you it's for God to call you to the wedding supper of his son I don't know anything greater are we together amen and Paul says right there he works with the people different things started happening in that church because the people were standing on the word but this we read where the scripture says and from his body were brought on to the sick handshake handkerchiefs in April and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirit went out of him now that was the thing that was just on my mind and I was thinking about it you know and brother Branham says Paul actually got that example from the scripture we read in the Old Testament for him to give prayer cloth out to people for him to pray for those cloth and give it out to people for them to cast our spirits he says Paul got that from Elijah experience of giving Gehenna his staff to go and lay it on the bone now you have to remember Paul never I mean enlarger never went and cut a tree branch and says I cut this tree branches and Lord Jesus just just bless this tree branch as as I guess I go and lay the flower on this little boy Laure bring his life back now this was Elijah's task I mean it was Elijah's property it was something that was with Elijah praise the Lord amen it was something that was with Elijah just like when God met Moses at the burning bush and he said what is in your hands there was Moses staff I mean it was what Moses was using to lead his sheeps and he was using it to climb up the mountain and I mean it was his time he depended on it in some way praise the Lord now what am I trying to draw to us tonight the binding power that that poor we take this inspiration there something that Elijah had like a star that was caught out of an armored tree and-and-and-and because those staff they are made from a fresh ammo tree the tree has to be a living tree it's not a dead stick they had caught it from a living tree amen and keep it and and then that you know the the leaders in the tree in in in a stick makes it to be stronger amen not a tree not a stake the force of the tree there is no life in it praise the Lord but when the color of the treat it's still fresh praise the Lord amen that's how they make your staff now so it has to be caught off a live tree it's not a dead stick lying on the ground so while to realize that a Elijah would take something from there has been with him something that is his praise the Lord amen now you think about that it's almost like brother branham right there embalming praying for that blind man and he take on his amen he never says Oh Bella poor Jack McGaw down the road and buy me in the shoes let me give it to this one he want to give the man his shoes why because he warded it has been in his presence he know what he had done with it he know where he has taken their shoes amen praise the Lord are we together follow me now Parabellum says i see many people they were annoyed they were annoyed or and I mean annoyed the close with anointing or and and and going pray for he says I don't have any me and a problem he says but that is not scriptural I mean Elijah never had to anoint that that or Elijah never had to annoy the stake Oh Elijah needed was something that live in his presence that's the life of the believer praise the Lord Oh in the church just if we if we value the Holy Ghost that's been given to the church as a keeping power as a cleansing power if we value that and to know that that Holy Ghost our doors in our body we use our clothes our shoes and different things to dress up ourself that as long as we keep it in that Center firing presence there was the confidence that a larger God Elijah had in that raw praise the Lord that was the that was the confidence he had that this rod has been right here when I'm calling on Jehovah when I'm going to church this roar goes with me to church this rod has been in the presence of God make the atmosphere that I create around Tracy Lord amen now before the word turned into oughta be a charity thing where people send things over overseas that was the way of the early church just like how Paul took his inspiration from Elijah the le church took this inspiration they would take their clothes and they would pray it over it not honor to send it to help people that don't have claws but they believe that when those people wear those clothes because they have left centerfire lives in those claws it will bring healing on the people and it will bring salvation to sauce pressure Lord amen why didn't why didn't God asked Moses for something else but God acts him for what he had in his hands amen and the Lord knew what Moses has been using it for are we together praise the Lord that was that was the that was the approach of the early church just like the testimony enough when when Jesus died on the cross and those Roman soldiers gamble because of his wrong you think about that you just think about it and whoever took that raw that he had around him you think about it what our Lord Jesus cross around his shoulder when he was healing his sake you think about it that is the reason why they could cut brother branham suits his pains and his cut into pieces to use it for prayer cloth praise the Lord but Brenham says we have enough holy ghost just to bring us to church and some time enough Holy Ghost just to stop lying but God want to fill our fibers of our body the fiber of our body praise Lord until you can give a shirt to a poor man down the street amen and say Lord try to live a clean life in that shirt I praise you in that shirt I fail your presence in that shirt praise the Lord amen and that's the reason why when the priest was called into the priesthood his tongue was anointed signifying the things that he would touch and his big toes were anointed signifying the places that he would go sometimes we want to leave our Holy Ghost in church leave our Holy Ghost at home but Holy Ghost want to go with you everywhere you go praise the Lord amen because it's a life it's not a religion it's a life these things down there in in Acts chapter 19 then we'll take all of these ear prongs their their clothing and just come and put it before Paul praise the Lord and he will he preyed upon it he would keep it in that annoy to clean atmosphere and they would take it and go and give it to sick people and the evil spirit will leave them praise the Lord it was not a clothes that was doing the work it was the atmosphere that it was kept in praise the Lord it was the atmosphere that it was kept in and God will use these things you know he will use these things off praise the Lord Amen that is the reason why you know we brother Branham says you know our our men done don't dress like the word because we believe God use our clothes he says our women don't you know they don't dress like the word they don't wear pants they don't expose their body because we believe that that's the presence that we are carrying there's a presence that must be contained and it must be contained right praise the Lord when addressing after the fashion of the word we are dressing after the fashion of God's Word you think about it how how these people believe even in the things that we use you know the things that they use when I was a cop whether it was a board but to be able to send the presence of God with just your pain I'm sounding like her like her Pentecostal preacher tonight but I'm not afraid to say I'm one Amen oh yeah because I believe God's presence goes with those things if we keep him in the right atmosphere praise the Lord yes Porter's you know like like I like I told you one time you know in its inspiration that's what verb random Bourbon says the woman that taught in her mind and see if I only touch His garment there was not a structure for that it was just an inspiration it was just an inspiration that came on her she knew she had a problem she had a health problem amen she had a health problem and she did struck me in a crowd and this thing just she said if I can just touch this man that can give the blind his side this man I can be able to raise the dead and make the creeper to walk if I can just only touch the hem of his coming I know my blood issue will be what is that it's inspiration praise the Lord just having an inspiration on your heart and so what if I can just you know if I can just give this man they say and the thing about it be rich the other it's been able to you puttin yourself in the channel for God to use you praise the Lord knowing that is the father that is calling in and it ended the truth about it there is that God called every one of us in different ways it was a different services that the Lord got ahold of us different messages were preached different start of preaching but one purpose is that he got us price alone it's a person funny and inspiration glory be to God but Rama says there's no holy man among us it's the Holy Ghost among his people I mean you see so when the word required us to live just as he required us to label every cent if our life live a clean life is not just a church requirement Amen if the world requires us to dress a certain way and and require us you know to attain from setting things you know you know don't God is requiring us there because he want to keep us in his presence and for us to carry that presence to the word if we were just want to realize that like Paul says I'm the Temple of the Holy Ghost that we add a tabernacle of God and as you go to work you are carrying God with you praise the Lord this efficient church believed that that just how solid these people were that was how that was how much they understood to know that Paul I mean John spoke about the coming Messiah even though they never saw him in flesh but God was able to keep them for them to be able to see him in the world even Paul never saw our Lord Jesus in the flesh now that he was born after Jesus died no but he was after the traditions of his father he never saw Jesus in the flesh but he saw Jesus in a word praise the Lord you know I was driving to church this evening I was thinking on this I was thinking on this it was running through my mind it statue of a perfect man that's what I was thinking about and then I started to think who was this perfect man that brother Brennan was talking about I mean he said his message was that statue of a perfect man and statues I always may after someone it's an image of someone amen praise the Lord and as I was robbing I was just thinking this in my mind and says well I would love to see George Washington statue or Abraham Lincoln statue or the statute of different men that were made I was just driving it coming to church this evening I was thinking about that and it was just becoming so real to me then I started asking myself who was this perfect man there brother Branham was talking about amen and I see preaching the message you were real I better bad I was talking also about a living monument that did statue of a peasant man was not a destiny it was not a mortal statue but it was a living monument praise the Lord oh I could not fail to all too - I mean I was just I was just I was just having church by myself I mean I was just thinking in maimana says oh my goodness God made man in His image I mean when God made Adam and every statue is put in the garden praise the Lord the beauty of the garden is the statue the reason why the garden is beautified and different trees are planted and the poor benches is because of that statue that they pulled right there and here is God make a garden and he's going to put his own statue he made man in His image praise the Lord amen he's going to put his own statue right in the garden and the statute that he put in the garden was also a living monument it was a statue that could move aside to you that the animals cool acetal amen a living monument please right there in the Garden of Eden and I was just thinking in my mind I says oh my goodness how sometimes we just kind of amidst this thing how we have run into Tunde doctrines and virtue doctrines and different doctrines when the simple messy brother Brandon preached was the statue of a perfect name amen and Paul says that we are confined to the image of Christ once again God is going to have a living monument on the earth and people that can represent him [Music] I mean and people that can represent him has to go to school as they go to work as a going into the morning and and and they lay them on the world but yet they are representing God amen and even the animals knew there was something about that man Adam when he spoke to them so the word also know there is something about these people they can really put it together but there is something about this guy or there is something about this scale they carry such a presence with them praise the Lord Oh when a church goes back to stop valuing the holy life in consecrated life praise the Lord Amen when the church gets to that yeah you see that's when the missionary spirit comes upon the church oh that's when the church ready to gave they want to give to this word because we have something to give blessed be the name of the Lord amen Paul grabbed his inspiration from Elijah and Elijah took his rod where Bram says the reason why when gaze away and he put the rod upon the child the child never came back to life he says the reason is because the faith of the woman was not in the wrong gays are Wayne but the woman never left she said I will never leave you she said he said the faith of the woman was in the Prophet amen if the woman will have gone with gays are definitely she was going to get the house on back but remember what she said she told you larger the profit she saw a gay hizashi pass him she went straight to the profit I never asked you for the child and even when you spoke das said a lot to me and I told you don't deceive me praise the Lord but I would say to you tonight Church we didn't ask God to save us he save us amen we didn't ask him to save us it's out of his love he saved us and I can tell you - nah he's not deceiving you praise the Lord amen where Bernice is because her faith was in the Prophet so he had to go he realized when the woman said I will not leave you as long as my soul life he knew that he had to go and he went with the woman and you know what happened he laid upon the chai and achai came back to life praise the Lord the Prophet have faith in his staff and the woman have faith in the Prophet musicians you can come tonight let's bow our heads together let's realized tonight since we are tabernacling dat as we move about praise the Lord sometimes you feel that inspiration on you you have a burden or you just feel to give to a man give to a frame when it come upon you give it [Music] but you see the devil comes down the round [Music] he condemns our mind when the early church was in this habit just like where Balaam said if I pray for hundred souls tonight and it dad I would stay keep reading amen when when the early church was in this habit where they believed their aprons taking off of their body their clothes and the Athenians that they have it's able to carry presence in home of sinners carry presence in the home of the hospital's and presence in a home the gifts that we gave in different things that we give to people on the street when you see a beggar on the street sometimes it's so easy to it runs through our mind all that he's on drugs if I give you something now he would go and do drugs that's that's not your your your inner heart your inner heart must go out and cry for that soul that man is impressive he's embracing his culture in something that is greater than he sometimes the enemy will come in and try to condemn us try to remind us and when he do all of those things just a week in our failure but don't listening to the devil by child of God my son of God my daughter of God and you know you Karen you tabernacling God in this body you live in a calling to the Word of God to the best that you know how Prison Ward you think about it God who use even a stake how much more of his son in his daughter that is possessed by his spirit this vowel has

Branham says the people talking about hygiene he says if it was in the days of our Lord Jesus they would have arrested him and said they were it's not hygienic for him to spit on the ground and take care miss his spit with clay and rub it on a man's eye he says to talk about hot jam but yet they would go down to the pool and they were all dashed into the same water then they would drink those waters with people that have just come living in nasty life and it were all swimming the same pool and all of that he says and they call that fun he says and then when we comes to the to the to the table of the Lord and we take that cup and drink and pass it one on to another they said that's not hygiene that's the reason why we pray for one another when we come to the communion that's the reason why we partake with one another when we come to the convenient because we are called to impart brother Branham says intend alive is living for others and go has cause he have impacted us for us to also impart to others don't allowed the enemy to weaken your faith don't let him to remind you of your pass or remind you of your weakness but you have to tell him I'm a tabernacle of the Living God yes me me me Jesus me me like give me the heart Daffy you with your war and me be more like oh yes be me more like be please Jesus make me move like [Music] gave me they're filled with love and
