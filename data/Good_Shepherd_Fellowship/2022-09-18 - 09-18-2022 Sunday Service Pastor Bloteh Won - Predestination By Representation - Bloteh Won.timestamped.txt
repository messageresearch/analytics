[1:09:54] all for the song
[1:09:56] praise the lord we want to just read a
[1:09:59] portion of the scripture this morning
[1:10:03] uh Romans chapter 5
[1:10:06] just for the scripture reading to read
[1:10:08] Romans chapter 5 and then we will take
[1:10:13] we take our
[1:10:17] get into what we want to talk about this
[1:10:19] morning
[1:10:22] praise the Lord follow a little bit the
[1:10:24] tape on the on the Sunday School the
[1:10:26] seed is not here with the shock this
[1:10:28] morning and yeah brother Brian talking
[1:10:30] about three women there is talking about
[1:10:34] uh Hagia the bandwoman
[1:10:37] Sarah the free woman
[1:10:39] and Mary the woman of the Royal Sea
[1:10:45] praise the Lord
[1:10:48] I think it's important for us to pay
[1:10:50] attention to those things because uh I
[1:10:54] mean we the the
[1:10:57] scripture is a shadow of things speaking
[1:11:00] of us and we will not understand our our
[1:11:05] journey unless uh uh
[1:11:16] praise the Lord
[1:11:18] unless we understand
[1:11:20] some of those things
[1:11:27] let's read that Romans chapter 5 verse
[1:11:30] 12. I just I just thought about this
[1:11:32] scripture this morning I was sitting in
[1:11:35] the office and I says well maybe I might
[1:11:37] just read that for the scripture reading
[1:11:39] and then we can quickly get into what we
[1:11:41] want to we want to talk about Romans
[1:11:43] chapter 12
[1:11:45] chapter 5 did I say 12 5 12 here 5 12.
[1:11:48] wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[1:11:51] the world and death by sin
[1:11:55] and so death pass unto all men
[1:11:58] for that all have sinned it
[1:12:02] for until the Lord's sin was in the word
[1:12:06] but seeing is not imputed when there is
[1:12:11] no law nevertheless death Reign from
[1:12:14] Adam to Moses
[1:12:16] even over them they had now seen after
[1:12:20] the similarities of Adam transgression
[1:12:23] who is a figure of him that was to come
[1:12:27] Adam was a figure of him Christ that was
[1:12:31] to come but not as the offense so also
[1:12:36] is the free gift
[1:12:40] for if through the offense of one many
[1:12:43] be there much more
[1:12:46] the grace of God
[1:12:49] and the gift by Grace which is by one
[1:12:54] man Jesus Christ have abound on too many
[1:12:58] praise the Lord
[1:13:00] and that asks it was by one that Senate
[1:13:04] soul is
[1:13:08] so is the gift
[1:13:10] for the Judgment was by one to
[1:13:14] condemnation
[1:13:16] but the free gift
[1:13:19] is too many the free gift is of meaning
[1:13:23] offenses unto justification so what Paul
[1:13:27] is dealing here with is actually
[1:13:28] representation
[1:13:31] by condemnation and representation by
[1:13:35] predestination
[1:13:37] so he's saying one man represented the
[1:13:41] whole word in the beginning but one
[1:13:43] man's sin Adam falling away from the
[1:13:46] word we all are honored that
[1:13:50] condemnation we are all born under thy
[1:13:53] curse so he represented us there and and
[1:13:58] one man represented us on the cross of
[1:14:01] Calvary when he took our sin on him amen
[1:14:05] so he represented us through him our sin
[1:14:08] is painful through him the devil had no
[1:14:11] right to hold us down or hold us guilty
[1:14:14] for anything only if we refuse his
[1:14:17] sacrifice then we have to provide our
[1:14:20] own sacrifice if we refuse why Christ
[1:14:23] did on the cross of Calvary then we have
[1:14:25] to provide our sacrifice so what part is
[1:14:28] dealing here with he's dealing with
[1:14:30] representation and that is something
[1:14:32] that is very important that we have to
[1:14:34] realize every one of us in the building
[1:14:37] this morning is year by representation
[1:14:40] praise the Lord
[1:14:42] amen in a sense to say there was someone
[1:14:45] that went before us
[1:14:47] there was there was uh there was a
[1:14:49] forerunner there was somebody that that
[1:14:53] made a sacrifice there was somebody that
[1:14:56] paved the way
[1:14:57] for us to be here
[1:14:59] if those Apostles did not give their
[1:15:02] life
[1:15:03] we will not have a pure gospel to preach
[1:15:05] today
[1:15:07] praise the Lord there are men and women
[1:15:10] that have stood for holiness and
[1:15:13] righteousness in the face of all the
[1:15:16] critics and the mockery because our God
[1:15:19] is never without a witness
[1:15:25] praise the Lord
[1:15:27] so we must we must realize that
[1:15:30] and if there will be a generation after
[1:15:32] us
[1:15:33] it would depends on our stand for the
[1:15:36] gospel
[1:15:37] it would depend on the sacrifice we are
[1:15:39] making now
[1:15:41] praise the Lord
[1:15:44] but God is never without a witness
[1:15:51] 17 for by one man offends death ring by
[1:15:54] one much more they which receive
[1:15:57] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[1:16:01] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:16:05] Jesus Christ
[1:16:06] therefore asked by the offense of one
[1:16:10] judgment Came Upon all men to
[1:16:14] condemnation representation by
[1:16:17] condemnation
[1:16:19] or condemnation by representation if we
[1:16:22] would say that way
[1:16:24] even so by the righteousness of one the
[1:16:29] free gift came upon all men to justify
[1:16:33] unto justification of life
[1:16:36] praise the Lord
[1:16:38] amen for us by one man
[1:16:42] one man Disobedience many were made
[1:16:46] Sinners so by their Obedience of one
[1:16:50] shall many
[1:16:52] be me righteous
[1:16:55] praise the Lord
[1:16:57] let us pray Heavenly Father realizing oh
[1:17:00] God
[1:17:01] that before there was a word before
[1:17:03] there was a molecule
[1:17:05] in your mind you made some
[1:17:07] representation
[1:17:09] you took a lamb
[1:17:11] slain from the foundation of the word
[1:17:14] and we know that was in your mind
[1:17:17] the foundation of anything is the
[1:17:19] beginning
[1:17:20] father
[1:17:22] in your mind
[1:17:24] to be able to bring out your attributes
[1:17:27] you thought of us you knew that we would
[1:17:29] be in such a day and age
[1:17:33] father well we don't know
[1:17:35] with all of the the political Wars that
[1:17:39] is around us and we see great uh Russia
[1:17:44] in China blending together
[1:17:47] the Iron Curtain and the baboon curtain
[1:17:50] father we see the U.S
[1:17:54] having the purple curtain behind her
[1:17:57] and we see all of these Powers Lord that
[1:18:00] are playing out
[1:18:01] and yet oh God we have no idea what is
[1:18:04] behind the scene
[1:18:06] what is behind those curtains Lord
[1:18:09] Russia continuing to church in the world
[1:18:12] with nuclear power and weapon of blowing
[1:18:15] the whole world out and in all of that
[1:18:18] but father we know that God that we
[1:18:21] stand on your word

[1:18:29] here
[1:18:29] before one of those measures you touch
[1:18:32] the ground
[1:18:33] it might be anything down father
[1:18:36] and that's why we say Lord may you help
[1:18:38] us Lord
[1:18:40] and we make the best use of this time
[1:18:42] that is before us we want to come

[1:21:00] want to bring all of that under the
[1:21:01] blood now you say father God that we

[1:21:22] the Lord bless you you may have your
[1:21:24] seat
[1:21:30] you may have your sick
[1:21:32] praise the Lord
[1:21:36] so this morning I want to speak on uh
[1:21:41] uh
[1:21:44] predestination by representation
[1:21:48] so you see why we read that scripture
[1:21:50] because that's what I had on my mind
[1:21:53] I didn't hide it in my notes though and
[1:21:55] I was thinking this morning while we had
[1:21:56] what we had read for the scripture
[1:21:58] reading and uh so
[1:22:02] uh last Sunday we spoke on uh Mary
[1:22:07] Magdalene in the first resurrection you
[1:22:11] know I type it like that because uh you
[1:22:13] know she was the first there and
[1:22:15] Wednesday night we spoke on the woman
[1:22:17] called in adultery in the pardon
[1:22:20] and we realized that the pattern uh is
[1:22:24] very important to the believer the
[1:22:26] pardon addressed the guilt
[1:22:29] praise the Lord the pardon address
[1:22:33] the the
[1:22:37] nature of guilt in our hearts that's
[1:22:40] what the pattern addressed
[1:22:43] so uh it comes to take out guilt
[1:22:47] and and when God deals with that because
[1:22:50] that that's where the curse is
[1:22:53] Satan is the accuser of the brethrens in
[1:22:56] why he accused us is because he wants to
[1:22:58] go and stir their guilt that era of
[1:23:02] guilt and see if there is any sense of
[1:23:04] guilt there because if he can make makes
[1:23:06] you guilty then he has a right to punch
[1:23:09] you
[1:23:11] the devil is never Brave to touch you
[1:23:13] until he makes you feel guilty
[1:23:17] he cannot touch you with sickness he
[1:23:19] cannot touch you with anything unless he
[1:23:22] makes you to feel guilty
[1:23:25] praise the Lord
[1:23:27] and so that's the reason why the pardon
[1:23:30] and we we said uh Wednesday night Jesus
[1:23:35] said to that woman calling adultery
[1:23:37] neither do I condemn they go and sing no
[1:23:40] more it was not just a step and he was
[1:23:43] making to her he was actually dealing
[1:23:46] with the guilty nature
[1:23:49] he was dealing with guilt down in her
[1:23:52] heart in her soul
[1:23:54] praise the Lord he was telling her that
[1:23:57] there is no condemnation to them that
[1:23:59] are in Christ they are passed from Death
[1:24:03] unto life
[1:24:04] that is not just a good Bible verse to
[1:24:07] remember that is what the Christian
[1:24:09] experience
[1:24:12] the grace of God want to bring us to the
[1:24:15] place where we have that feeling in us
[1:24:17] that there is no condemnation
[1:24:20] amen we don't feel condemned
[1:24:24] and then we don't condemn others
[1:24:30] praise the Lord
[1:24:31] we don't speak on them because we are
[1:24:34] not condemned and not because of our
[1:24:36] effort we appreciate the grace that have
[1:24:40] come unto us why will you hold something
[1:24:43] against somebody
[1:24:46] what right do you have
[1:24:48] what make you so brave
[1:24:51] why you want to be possessed of the
[1:24:53] devil
[1:24:56] because that's just the devil's work
[1:24:59] you have your work to do be a Son of God
[1:25:01] be a daughter of God that's your work
[1:25:03] don't do the devil's work
[1:25:13] oh
[1:25:14] so you think there
[1:25:17] there is no condemnation
[1:25:19] unto them that are in Christ Lord thank
[1:25:22] you I've come in I locked the door
[1:25:23] nobody else can come in
[1:25:27] I mean Christ no come to me you are all
[1:25:29] dead
[1:25:30] you don't have the key let me tell you
[1:25:33] you don't have the key
[1:25:39] since it was not by your choice you kill
[1:25:42] me you cannot also choose who we're
[1:25:44] coming
[1:25:46] and who we're not
[1:25:48] it's not your choice
[1:25:52] it's a work of Grace
[1:25:57] and Let the church say Amen
[1:26:00] praise the Lord
[1:26:05] amen
[1:26:07] so this morning we want to look at
[1:26:09] predestination
[1:26:11] uh uh in in in in a different way and we
[1:26:15] want to look we want to use the woman at
[1:26:18] the well
[1:26:19] we want to use the woman at the well but
[1:26:23] as as I was thinking on on this subject
[1:26:25] I remember many years back
[1:26:27] the Lord
[1:26:33] the Lord helped me to look at this in a
[1:26:36] way they had a
[1:26:37] you will see that uh
[1:26:40] uh
[1:26:42] the prophet of God make make statements
[1:26:44] like this listen to this message why he
[1:26:47] says now remember Jesus said as it was
[1:26:50] in the days of Sodom so shall it be in
[1:26:53] the coming of the son of man
[1:26:55] otherwise a visitation of the same
[1:27:00] listen to this now a visitation of the
[1:27:02] same and if God show his sign
[1:27:05] at the end to the Jews and at the end to
[1:27:09] the Samaritan dispensation
[1:27:11] and let the Gentile get in just on
[1:27:15] common theology he did wrong
[1:27:18] he's infinite his first decision how to
[1:27:20] do
[1:27:21] anything always Remains the Same now
[1:27:24] what is he talking about here he's
[1:27:26] talking about Jesus meeting Nathaniel
[1:27:29] and says that you you are an Israelite
[1:27:31] in whom there is no God Amen he said how
[1:27:34] do you know me he said even before
[1:27:35] Philip called you when you were under
[1:27:37] the tree so Jesus was using a gift of
[1:27:40] discernment right
[1:27:42] praise the Lord
[1:27:43] so he said the Jews saw that
[1:27:48] right amen it was the same thing he did
[1:27:51] when he met the woman at the well
[1:27:53] you have five husbands even the man you
[1:27:55] slept with last night he's now your
[1:27:57] husband
[1:27:59] she said son I perceive that you are a
[1:28:01] prophet
[1:28:03] but this thing
[1:28:05] it is what the Messiah is supposed to do
[1:28:07] when Jesus said I am he she did not
[1:28:10] struggle
[1:28:13] are we together so he's he's he he's
[1:28:17] saying here that the Jews had an
[1:28:19] opportunity to see that manifestation
[1:28:22] the Samaritans also had an opportunity
[1:28:25] to see that manifestation but the
[1:28:28] Gentile never had it
[1:28:31] so it was a promise in Luke 17 30 that
[1:28:35] the son of man will be revealed man amen
[1:28:39] amen praise the Lord
[1:28:41] and and and and and that's where we
[1:28:43] identify the Fulfillment of that
[1:28:46] scripture in the ministry of the brother
[1:28:48] Branham because he had the grace to know
[1:28:50] the thoughts of the people
[1:28:53] praise the Lord
[1:28:55] and uh uh in the message the son of the
[1:28:58] Messiah he says uh just like Abraham and
[1:29:01] in the 70s he turned his back to the
[1:29:03] people and said you woman there in a
[1:29:05] care role your name is this you live
[1:29:07] into this place it was not just for the
[1:29:10] public show but what he was doing was
[1:29:12] trying to show that the same
[1:29:14] manifestation of the gifts that were to
[1:29:16] the Jews the same gift that told the
[1:29:19] woman as a mirror what was her problem
[1:29:21] this is the same gift that have come to
[1:29:24] us
[1:29:25] foreign
[1:29:29] but you see this is what it is people
[1:29:32] then I want that's what I want to lay
[1:29:33] down this morning it's only
[1:29:36] there
[1:29:38] predestinated can see it
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:45] it's only the predestinator that are
[1:29:47] elected
[1:29:48] to see it in every age now this is where
[1:29:52] we got it wrong
[1:29:54] it is not only the predestinator that
[1:29:58] are safe
[1:30:02] amen no that's why we got it wrong
[1:30:05] because for many years we think that if
[1:30:08] people don't believe the message they
[1:30:09] are not safe
[1:30:10] you got it wrong your teaching is wrong
[1:30:15] you got an evil spirit on you
[1:30:19] amen and you need to go to Calvary
[1:30:26] praise the Lord because even people in
[1:30:28] the Catholic church are safe
[1:30:30] by their faith in Jesus Christ
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:38] they are saved by their faith in Jesus
[1:30:41] Christ
[1:30:44] that's what the scripture says
[1:30:47] and that's what our Prophet taught
[1:30:52] now but it's different when it comes to
[1:30:54] the elect of the age
[1:30:59] how did he taught it just like so in a
[1:31:03] Welling gown or sowing a shirt or
[1:31:05] whatever you get a cloth and you cut the
[1:31:07] pattern your measurement that will be
[1:31:10] able to give you a nice shirt you cut it
[1:31:13] out of that material the material that I
[1:31:15] left is the same is just as seen as the
[1:31:19] one you're going to use for the clothes
[1:31:20] but you just choose this one because you
[1:31:24] are being able to get your measurement
[1:31:25] out of it they are the sea
[1:31:30] it's just that one is choose
[1:31:33] praise the Lord
[1:31:35] amen amen the clothes you are wearing
[1:31:37] this morning there was some other
[1:31:38] material that was thrown away
[1:31:41] the tailor just got your measurement
[1:31:45] maybe he never even threw it away he
[1:31:47] just kept it and saw something else for
[1:31:49] somebody
[1:31:54] praise the Lord
[1:31:55] so you see we go around with this notion
[1:31:58] and we condemn everybody to hell and and
[1:32:01] then we think now we have we have made a
[1:32:03] Rapture for the fact that we we are not
[1:32:06] even understand God's Plan of Salvation
[1:32:08] shows that we not even started our
[1:32:11] journey
[1:32:12] we are just becoming radical
[1:32:16] we just becoming radical
[1:32:20] with a misunderstanding in our minds
[1:32:34] it's only
[1:32:35] they're predestinated that sees it
[1:32:39] now so what I want us to do this morning
[1:32:42] like I was saying many years ago I was I
[1:32:45] was looking at this and and you know
[1:32:47] when and and brother Brown said this he
[1:32:50] he goes over it but uh uh and and and
[1:32:53] and that's that's the reason why people
[1:32:55] I say this over and over and which of
[1:32:58] course is true if I'm not only the only
[1:32:59] one you know uh this message is out of
[1:33:03] the scripture
[1:33:04] is not something out of the Blues
[1:33:08] praise the Lord the failure of the
[1:33:10] Christian church is because they have
[1:33:13] make the Bible
[1:33:15] a stranger to them
[1:33:17] praise the Lord if a man or a woman is
[1:33:21] in the scripture not only to learn to
[1:33:24] argue or not on it to to learn to prove
[1:33:28] their point but you are in a word just
[1:33:30] because you love the Lord and you just
[1:33:32] want you know that the word is God and
[1:33:34] you just want to to know him more and
[1:33:37] get closer to him you will see God every
[1:33:40] time you read a scripture
[1:33:43] so we realized that the Samaritans had a
[1:33:48] visitation
[1:33:52] the Samaritans had a visitation Luke
[1:33:54] chapter 10.
[1:33:57] Luke chapter 10 let's let's go there
[1:33:59] quickly we got to run through some
[1:34:01] scripture here this morning
[1:34:14] Luke chapter 10
[1:34:17] and then when you read down you read in
[1:34:19] Luke chapter 10 you realize you get over
[1:34:22] to verse 29
[1:34:34] now Jesus here
[1:34:37] talking
[1:34:42] the Bible says uh uh in verse 25 is
[1:34:46] setting lawyer through tempting him
[1:34:49] saying Master what shall I do to inherit
[1:34:51] internal life
[1:34:53] then uh Jesus said what is written in
[1:34:57] the Lord
[1:34:59] and how rid of doubt there's two
[1:35:01] different things there
[1:35:03] what is written and how do you read it
[1:35:06] it's two different things you can read
[1:35:09] it completely different from what is
[1:35:11] written
[1:35:14] praise the Lord
[1:35:15] so Jesus is saying what is written and
[1:35:18] how read it down
[1:35:22] and he answered Thou shalt love the Lord
[1:35:24] that God with all the heart and with all
[1:35:27] that sold and with all that straining
[1:35:29] with all the mind
[1:35:31] and thy neighbor as thyself and he said
[1:35:34] unto him they all have answered right
[1:35:37] this do and thou shall live but but he
[1:35:42] willing to justify himself so you see he
[1:35:46] was reading the word not because of what
[1:35:49] is written
[1:35:51] but the way he was reading the world was
[1:35:53] to justify himself
[1:35:56] so sometimes we read what is written
[1:35:59] different
[1:35:59] either with a preconceived mind with a
[1:36:03] mind just to argue
[1:36:07] praise the Lord
[1:36:09] willing to justify himself he said unto
[1:36:12] Jesus
[1:36:14] and who is my neighbor
[1:36:17] praise the Lord
[1:36:19] now Jesus now will will
[1:36:22] try to tell him try to tell him who is
[1:36:25] his neighbor now remember now this was a
[1:36:27] lawyer he was a strive not a lawyer like
[1:36:30] a professional attorney there in a court
[1:36:32] but a lawyer this these are the guys
[1:36:34] that steady the straws you know the
[1:36:36] state of the Lord now so Jesus here now
[1:36:40] bring out the story of
[1:36:43] the Good Samaritan
[1:36:46] realizing that he was talking to a Jew
[1:36:51] there is nothing that hurt a Jew
[1:36:55] then for Jesus to bring up a story of a
[1:36:58] Samaritan or to talk about a gentile
[1:37:04] the Bible says when he said was that was
[1:37:07] were there not many lepers in Israel
[1:37:10] but Nehemiah the Gentile General got
[1:37:13] healed the Bible said they took storms
[1:37:16] to Stone him
[1:37:20] praise the Lord but still wash their
[1:37:23] contacts here
[1:37:24] he's asking Jesus what is ready in the
[1:37:27] Lord and Jesus telling him and his
[1:37:29] preconceived mind he want to trap this
[1:37:31] man he want to justify he wants to show
[1:37:34] that this guy is nothing but just a
[1:37:36] carpenter's son
[1:37:40] so Jesus take him on a journey
[1:37:43] I said I said a man went down from
[1:37:46] Jerusalem to Jericho even by saying that
[1:37:49] he trembled in his body Jericho wow
[1:37:51] abomination
[1:37:53] right yeah
[1:37:56] and he failed at my own teach and Jesus
[1:37:58] went on he says in verse chapter one
[1:38:01] about change there came down and setting
[1:38:04] priests
[1:38:07] amen
[1:38:09] there came a priest
[1:38:12] secondly there came a Levi
[1:38:15] and man leaving Jerusalem and going down
[1:38:18] to Jericho and he and he and he was
[1:38:21] beating by thieves now this man trying
[1:38:25] to justify himself you can now see how
[1:38:28] his mind is running he already left the
[1:38:30] word
[1:38:31] if they beat him he looked for it he's
[1:38:33] supposed to be in the world
[1:38:35] you have already left the word so
[1:38:37] whatever happened to him it was so that
[1:38:40] the priest came and saw him and the
[1:38:42] priest left him the priest said oh wow a
[1:38:45] man that is a priest a man that's
[1:38:47] supposed to be the one that is in charge
[1:38:49] of a hurting people
[1:38:54] nobody a religion has told them as long
[1:38:58] as this man has left church and he's in
[1:39:01] this problem have nothing to do with him
[1:39:05] and he was too clean he don't he don't
[1:39:07] have to get his his his uh uh uh Rob
[1:39:11] Derek
[1:39:13] he saw the man he left and Levi
[1:39:18] and the Lioness that was chosen
[1:39:21] now see where Jesus was going to
[1:39:25] see where he was going to
[1:39:28] the man that were respected
[1:39:32] by other Jewish people
[1:39:36] the ones that they look after
[1:39:39] that kneel the Commandments of the Lord
[1:39:43] praise the Lord
[1:39:46] so as Jesus went down he says but then a
[1:39:49] second Samaritan
[1:39:51] as he joining came where he was and when
[1:39:55] he saw him
[1:39:56] he had compassion on him and he went
[1:39:59] unto him and he banned out his wound and
[1:40:02] pouring oil and wine and he even took
[1:40:04] him to an inn
[1:40:07] entrusted him to a man
[1:40:10] praise the Lord
[1:40:12] what was the question that he asked
[1:40:14] Jesus who is my neighbor
[1:40:19] praise the Lord
[1:40:27] now the Bible says they are the Jesus
[1:40:36] saying this to him
[1:40:41] Jesus said which one of these three
[1:40:43] think Adele
[1:40:45] was never to him that fell among the
[1:40:49] thieves
[1:40:50] he said he that sure have mercy to him
[1:40:53] Jesus said then go go and do likewise if
[1:40:56] you really believe that in your heart go
[1:40:58] and do likewise
[1:41:00] praise the Lord
[1:41:02] but not realize now
[1:41:05] talking about disposition of visitation
[1:41:09] you'll realize that Jesus then not just
[1:41:13] use the Samaritan
[1:41:16] as a person taught
[1:41:18] but he was building a story
[1:41:21] he was trying to show us
[1:41:25] that even though why
[1:41:27] it was prophesied that he would be born
[1:41:29] in Beth's at hand and he would do all of
[1:41:31] those things he was on his way somewhere
[1:41:35] and there will be a group of people that
[1:41:38] will recognize his visitation
[1:41:42] praise the Lord
[1:41:44] amen Jesus was trying to show how Mercy
[1:41:48] will come to the Samaritans
[1:41:51] by recognizing their day of visitation
[1:41:58] praise the Lord are we together
[1:42:03] you have your seat belt on
[1:42:06] Saint Luke chapter 17.
[1:42:14] sin Luke chapter 17.
[1:42:20] foreign
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:39] Jesus is also going to deal with a
[1:42:41] situation here
[1:42:43] where he will meet
[1:42:46] ten lepers
[1:42:48] Hallelujah
[1:42:52] glory be to God
[1:42:54] he will meet ten lepers and the Bible
[1:42:57] says that
[1:42:59] he will
[1:43:01] speak unto these lepers
[1:43:12] and he would tell them
[1:43:15] that they were claims they should go and
[1:43:16] show themselves unto the priests you can
[1:43:19] read the entire scripture when you when
[1:43:21] you get home
[1:43:24] and the Bible says they are the
[1:43:27] verse 15 and one of them
[1:43:30] when he saw that he was healed
[1:43:33] he turned back
[1:43:36] and with a loud voice he glorified God
[1:43:40] and failed them
[1:43:43] on his face
[1:43:45] at
[1:43:47] his feet at Jesus feet
[1:43:49] giving thanks
[1:43:51] and he was
[1:43:54] a Samaritan
[1:43:59] it is only the elect
[1:44:01] that can recognize
[1:44:04] the move of God India day
[1:44:08] praise the Lord
[1:44:10] Jesus healed him and told them go and
[1:44:13] show yourself to the priests
[1:44:16] Hallelujah
[1:44:18] which is uh uh the the Lord of Leviticus
[1:44:22] for them to go show themselves to the
[1:44:24] priest and the priest will pronounce
[1:44:25] them Clint but here is a Samaritan for
[1:44:29] some reason something in his heart
[1:44:33] told him that that priesthood in
[1:44:36] Jerusalem is dead
[1:44:38] there is a priest
[1:44:46] glory be to God
[1:44:48] amen
[1:44:51] we are building you
[1:44:54] so just help me bring the stakes
[1:44:57] to put this building up
[1:45:00] something in his heart make him to
[1:45:02] realize
[1:45:06] that that priesthood in Jerusalem there
[1:45:11] in the synagoguese
[1:45:13] they didn't have actually what it takes
[1:45:16] to pronounce him claims
[1:45:21] praise the Lord
[1:45:23] Jesus said Go and show yourself to the
[1:45:25] priests
[1:45:26] but he recognized that there was a
[1:45:28] priesthood
[1:45:30] that was standing that was higher than
[1:45:32] the priesthood of Arab is
[1:45:40] praise the Lord and the Bible said he
[1:45:43] was a Samaritan
[1:45:48] I love it when the Bible do that
[1:45:53] and Jesus answered and said were there
[1:45:56] not ten claims
[1:45:58] but where are the nine
[1:46:02] there are not formed that return to give
[1:46:05] glory to God save this stranger
[1:46:10] the other ones was running back to their
[1:46:13] religious order
[1:46:14] but this man wanted to give glory to God
[1:46:20] why he had to do that because it was in
[1:46:24] a season
[1:46:26] where God
[1:46:28] was dealing with the Samaritans
[1:46:31] there was a move that was going over to
[1:46:33] the Samaritans because he had to do it
[1:46:36] to get to the Gentiles
[1:46:40] he had to pass that way just like
[1:46:45] now me how to go down out of Beth to him
[1:46:49] and bring Ruth into Beth to him
[1:46:53] she had to pass that way because of
[1:46:56] redemption
[1:46:59] praise the Lord
[1:47:03] glory be to God
[1:47:04] so we see Jesus here building a story
[1:47:07] about a Good Samaritan which of course
[1:47:09] that would be completely abomination
[1:47:12] to the Jews
[1:47:16] he's pronouncing 10 lepros cleaning
[1:47:19] giving them the Lord of Leviticus and
[1:47:22] said Go and show yourself to the priests
[1:47:24] but there were just one
[1:47:26] that realized
[1:47:29] I think this is the priest
[1:47:31] I think this is the priest praise the
[1:47:35] Lord I think if this man said I'm
[1:47:37] cleanse I can take his word
[1:47:49] now you see you have to realize that
[1:47:51] every Revival comes at the end of the
[1:47:54] age
[1:47:55] when the people finally realize they
[1:47:58] have a Revival it has already ended
[1:48:03] praise the Lord every Revival comes at
[1:48:06] the end of the age when the people
[1:48:08] really realizing that God is doing
[1:48:10] something is already at the end
[1:48:16] praise the Lord
[1:48:18] Hallelujah
[1:48:20] so then we get into our stories in John
[1:48:23] chapter 4.
[1:48:27] you pick up these little clues in a
[1:48:29] scripture
[1:48:31] and your mind starts to think and wonder
[1:48:34] why why they're aligned and you see the
[1:48:36] prophet of God talking about Samaritans
[1:48:38] had their visitation how did they hide
[1:48:40] their visitation when did it happen
[1:48:44] well why Jesus was moving among the Jews
[1:48:47] and healing their sake there were
[1:48:49] Samaritans and Gentiles that could
[1:48:51] realize there was a gentile Center and
[1:48:53] that says don't come to my house just
[1:48:54] speak the word I'm a man of authority
[1:48:57] they could realize they could recognize
[1:48:59] the gift
[1:49:02] why the people that they give for
[1:49:04] centuries say he's a vegetable
[1:49:14] are we together
[1:49:16] and then we all know the story of this
[1:49:19] woman
[1:49:20] of Samira it's in John chapter 4.
[1:49:23] praise the Lord
[1:49:25] amen
[1:49:26] and then if you read this in John
[1:49:28] chapter 8 you'll realize after Jesus had
[1:49:31] that confrontation with those men and
[1:49:34] and tell them if any one of you here do
[1:49:37] not sin cast the first stone and he went
[1:49:40] into talking to them about uh you know
[1:49:42] uh Abraham is not their father they are
[1:49:45] born
[1:49:45] from from the sin of of the serpent he
[1:49:49] says that the devil is your father
[1:49:51] because he was a murderer in the
[1:49:53] beginning after that that their entire
[1:49:55] conversation just read them you know
[1:49:57] what he told Jesus he said now we
[1:49:59] realize you have you have a devil and
[1:50:01] you are even a Samaritan
[1:50:10] they call him a Samaritan
[1:50:13] now let's let's just talk about this
[1:50:15] woman a little bit here
[1:50:16] this woman of Samira
[1:50:20] she's the one we want to hold for this
[1:50:22] inspiration
[1:50:24] praise the Lord
[1:50:25] she's the one that we want to hold for
[1:50:28] this inspiration
[1:50:31] you love the Lord
[1:50:33] amen
[1:50:40] he cares do you kids brother Brown said
[1:50:42] this before we we get we get on our
[1:50:44] journey here he says
[1:50:46] now
[1:50:47] he did that
[1:50:49] they're elected we know he did that told
[1:50:53] the elect
[1:50:54] on and told the election now there was
[1:50:58] there was the one who had accepted the
[1:51:01] gem of life
[1:51:03] they were the ones who were
[1:51:06] predestinated to see it
[1:51:10] they were the ones
[1:51:13] we are if we believe the Bible we have
[1:51:17] to believe in predestination
[1:51:20] that's right
[1:51:22] not uh God is willing that energy perish
[1:51:26] but he knows who will receive it and who
[1:51:30] warned
[1:51:31] praise the Lord
[1:51:33] amen exposition of the church ages the
[1:51:36] same that church it says this illids
[1:51:38] were not only the internal thoughts of
[1:51:41] God which were to be expressed in flesh
[1:51:44] in their due season but this same elect
[1:51:48] are called by another name what was
[1:51:52] their name and that is exactly what we
[1:51:55] have been saying these who are of the
[1:51:59] royal seed
[1:52:00] amen now so if you follow the tip that
[1:52:03] brought up there this morning we were
[1:52:05] playing the seed is not here with a shot
[1:52:07] but a man was talking about Hagar he was
[1:52:09] talking about Sarah and he was also
[1:52:11] talking about Mary
[1:52:13] praise the Lord these were the three
[1:52:15] women through Whom The Seed of Abraham
[1:52:18] came
[1:52:19] God promised Abraham a seed
[1:52:23] praise the lord we know that it was not
[1:52:26] a natural seed because after Sarah died
[1:52:29] Abraham married ketoria
[1:52:32] and had 12 more songs
[1:52:36] those are the Arabs
[1:52:38] and all of the people there in the
[1:52:40] Middle East
[1:52:41] so every one of them claimed
[1:52:44] inheritance to Abraham
[1:52:47] so but the son by whom Abraham will
[1:52:50] become the father of all Nations
[1:52:55] is the one that came true Mary
[1:53:00] and so what he was saying is that the
[1:53:03] promise that God gave to Abraham from
[1:53:06] the beginning it looks like a natural
[1:53:08] promise
[1:53:09] amen but we realized that it was a
[1:53:13] spiritual promise
[1:53:16] when when he got her son it was true
[1:53:20] sexual relationship
[1:53:23] of the flesh
[1:53:25] when Sarah had her son it was the same
[1:53:28] it was just that or with way far with uh
[1:53:33] Higa
[1:53:34] it was
[1:53:35] a form of adultery
[1:53:39] because she was a woman that was taken
[1:53:42] in polygamy that's that's what it is
[1:53:45] amen
[1:53:47] and and even even uh uh uh Sarah to whom
[1:53:53] Isaac was promised she doubted the
[1:53:56] promise
[1:53:57] she brought Hagar along
[1:54:00] praise the Lord
[1:54:03] but to realize that these women were
[1:54:06] there like like like the way the prophet
[1:54:08] said they were there just to transport
[1:54:12] they were there they were carrier
[1:54:14] carrier off the sea carry all the
[1:54:17] promise
[1:54:18] they had their place
[1:54:21] amen Hagar was speaking about our flesh
[1:54:27] this is our Hager
[1:54:30] the stubborn son that is born
[1:54:34] Sarah a woman of the promise speaks of
[1:54:37] our spirit
[1:54:40] Mary the Virgin birth
[1:54:43] speaks of our soul
[1:54:48] the soul remains virgin to God under one
[1:54:52] seek and go in there it's either Faith
[1:54:54] or doubt
[1:55:01] are we together
[1:55:05] now so that's the reason why when he
[1:55:07] taught that he says you have to pay
[1:55:08] attention and speaking about a natural
[1:55:10] woman but the the message is for the
[1:55:13] church is concerning the church
[1:55:16] but we get stuck in a place of the
[1:55:18] Natural Woman and we take that and and
[1:55:20] we just became you know uh so rough and
[1:55:23] rude on women and we think that it's a
[1:55:25] spirit of Elijah
[1:55:27] right
[1:55:29] it's just a misunderstanding of the
[1:55:32] grace that have come to us
[1:55:39] but he goes down here and says and and
[1:55:42] that is exactly what
[1:55:43] what we were saying these who are the
[1:55:47] Royal seed are the elects of God
[1:55:51] are the predestinated
[1:55:54] for known of God and we're in the mind
[1:55:57] of God and His Thoughts in a plain
[1:56:00] language the True Blood of Christ was in
[1:56:04] the mind of God or yeah was in the mind
[1:56:07] of God internally
[1:56:10] do not express until each came forth in
[1:56:15] their destinated decree season
[1:56:18] and each member came forth to be
[1:56:21] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:56:24] thus the bride is the rich was spoken
[1:56:29] word see
[1:56:31] praise the Lord
[1:56:33] now and Abraham was teaching there also
[1:56:36] he said you have to also realize that
[1:56:39] Mary even though she was a virgin but
[1:56:41] she was not the seed
[1:56:43] the seed was Christ
[1:56:47] so she herself even though she was a
[1:56:50] virgin it was not a sexual art but she
[1:56:52] was just a carrier
[1:56:56] she was just a carrier the Seed of
[1:57:00] Abraham was Jesus Christ
[1:57:07] are we together
[1:57:12] so the I mean receiving the word of the
[1:57:15] age receiving the Holy Ghost Gonna Make
[1:57:17] You deceit
[1:57:18] you have to realize the seed is Christ
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:23] you must always keep that place
[1:57:29] that it is no longer I that leave it
[1:57:32] but Christ that leave it in me
[1:57:41] now so we goes on here then uh uh we are
[1:57:45] in we are over in uh uh
[1:57:49] see John chapter 4 is a story that we
[1:57:52] all know beautiful story of the woman at
[1:57:54] the well amen
[1:57:56] beautiful story
[1:57:58] beautiful Story I mean they are just
[1:58:00] they are just a lot of
[1:58:02] a lot of texts and context you can take
[1:58:04] from out of that scripture beautiful
[1:58:07] story
[1:58:09] the woman at the well
[1:58:11] now but there was something I also share
[1:58:14] with you here uh we we see here that the
[1:58:19] Bible says and and uh
[1:58:22] verse 1 there uh when therefore the Lord
[1:58:26] knew how the Pharisees
[1:58:28] have heard that Jesus
[1:58:31] made and baptized more disciples than
[1:58:33] John okay we go through all of that then
[1:58:36] coming to the city of Samira which is
[1:58:39] called Sacramento the password of ground
[1:58:41] that Jacob
[1:58:43] gave to his son Joseph
[1:58:46] and Jacob well was dead and and Jesus
[1:58:49] and his disciple and they come at a
[1:58:52] woman of Samira to draw water he said
[1:58:54] give me to drink
[1:58:56] praise the Lord so Wednesday night the
[1:58:59] reason we signed that song this is my
[1:59:01] story because we read a quote what
[1:59:03] brother Brandon says if you don't know
[1:59:05] the story behind somebody's life
[1:59:07] you could you will not rightly think of
[1:59:10] them and we all have stories behind our
[1:59:13] lives
[1:59:14] praise the Lord
[1:59:16] the things that make our story beautiful
[1:59:18] is the grace of God that has come unto
[1:59:21] us
[1:59:22] amen
[1:59:24] praise the Lord is the grace of God that
[1:59:26] have come unto us the grace of God there
[1:59:29] there they have they have entered in our
[1:59:31] story how we God save how we met the
[1:59:33] Lord that's what made the story better
[1:59:36] nothing you did in the past that is ever
[1:59:39] prayed to hear
[1:59:41] well you never know me I was this I
[1:59:44] don't even want to know you that way
[1:59:46] I'd rather know you who you are now
[1:59:53] so everyone have a story about a brand
[1:59:55] new in the message uh uh
[1:59:59] God Rob gave he talks about Rahab he
[2:00:02] said Rahab the halot they are there
[2:00:05] there we all are familiar with
[2:00:08] she's being a young girl
[2:00:10] that was turned on the street
[2:00:14] by her hidden father and mother
[2:00:17] that put her on the street because she
[2:00:21] was beautiful
[2:00:22] and she was to bring an income to them
[2:00:26] is that strange
[2:00:29] having you hear a story like that
[2:00:32] praise the Lord right
[2:00:35] her parents who turn their children on
[2:00:38] the street
[2:00:43] praise the Lord
[2:00:45] yeah
[2:00:48] because they want them to be be become
[2:00:52] an income part how to meet one in his
[2:00:54] age he cast the evil spirit out of her
[2:00:56] and the whole city ran against him
[2:01:00] because they were using that evil spirit
[2:01:02] in her for money
[2:01:06] but this one was uh uh uh using their
[2:01:09] child to you know to live a better life
[2:01:13] and yeah down in this immoral girl
[2:01:18] that was turned on the street
[2:01:21] she had heard that there was a God who
[2:01:27] answered prayer
[2:01:28] that's why she told us price we have
[2:01:30] heard how your God opened the red seed
[2:01:34] praise the Lord
[2:01:36] maybe she was just standing behind and
[2:01:39] and reading the local newspaper or
[2:01:42] hearing some men talking about it and in
[2:01:44] her heart she says I would love to serve
[2:01:46] a god like that yeah
[2:01:49] a God that can open the rest
[2:01:52] praise the Lord that was the thing that
[2:01:54] made her to be attracted to the spies
[2:01:57] when she knew that these men were
[2:01:59] identified with the god
[2:02:01] that could open the Red Sea the god that
[2:02:04] fell them in the wilderness with Mana
[2:02:07] the Nations around in the night they can
[2:02:10] see the pillar of fire they see light
[2:02:13] in the fire
[2:02:16] they could see a circle of light they
[2:02:19] were eyewitnesses
[2:02:22] just like there were men that were
[2:02:24] eyewitnesses that saw those angels
[2:02:26] flying
[2:02:28] they're in Arizona and took the picture
[2:02:36] they couldn't explain it
[2:02:39] but they knew that every evening there's
[2:02:42] a light that would come up
[2:02:44] we can see it from far I think it's
[2:02:46] those people that came through the Red
[2:02:48] Sea
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:54] I wonder how they are eating somebody
[2:02:55] said in the morning my food comes down
[2:02:58] and go out in Tech
[2:03:01] hmm
[2:03:04] all the nations around her their story
[2:03:14] she heard about a God that can answer
[2:03:16] prayer and the first opportunity she got
[2:03:20] that's what
[2:03:22] the elect will do the predestinated in
[2:03:25] every age the first opportunity at the
[2:03:28] world
[2:03:30] because there was something in your
[2:03:31] heart that was Yearning For Truth
[2:03:34] right the first opportunity that they
[2:03:37] have other word they just said this is
[2:03:39] what I was looking for I can't explain
[2:03:41] it but this is what I was looking for
[2:03:43] this is what my soul was hungering for
[2:03:46] I always wanted truth
[2:03:56] first opportunity that she got she
[2:03:59] accepted the god
[2:04:02] or do something for him
[2:04:04] she did it
[2:04:06] and God spared her life
[2:04:08] and save her father and mother
[2:04:11] and her family
[2:04:13] praise the Lord
[2:04:16] fairly Lord with a Roman general
[2:04:18] and true Hall came
[2:04:20] boas
[2:04:22] the root
[2:04:23] of David
[2:04:25] came through that girl
[2:04:28] because in her
[2:04:31] was a representation
[2:04:35] she didn't understand it
[2:04:37] why she could raise her life
[2:04:40] when the army of Jericho was looking for
[2:04:42] those men
[2:04:49] in her soul
[2:04:52] praise the Lord
[2:04:54] amen
[2:04:55] you can never Master there boy
[2:04:59] you can never Master it
[2:05:03] will make you feel odd
[2:05:07] praise the Lord
[2:05:11] you always feel like you need something
[2:05:14] more
[2:05:16] from God
[2:05:20] it create a hunger and a constant test
[2:05:25] for God in your heart
[2:05:34] praise the Lord
[2:05:36] so we see that's that's the way it is in
[2:05:39] every age in every visitation every
[2:05:41] Revival
[2:05:56] so just like this woman at the well
[2:06:01] or just like this rehab
[2:06:04] was the same with this woman at the well
[2:06:07] and uh
[2:06:11] we pretty much see right here that uh
[2:06:14] she started
[2:06:16] talking to Jesus
[2:06:19] she says
[2:06:22] then the woman at the world verse 9 Omar
[2:06:25] of Samira how he said that thou being
[2:06:27] the Jews acts I drink of me which I am
[2:06:31] as uh I'm of Samira for the Jews have no
[2:06:35] dealing with us how did she got there
[2:06:40] that verse write their shows a
[2:06:43] generation problem
[2:06:48] the Jews have no dealing it's a
[2:06:51] generational problem
[2:06:53] it goes back
[2:06:56] it goes back to many years when the
[2:06:59] Assyrians took over
[2:07:01] because one time Samira was part
[2:07:04] you remember Ahab was the king of Samira
[2:07:06] it was power when they said when when
[2:07:08] the Assyrians capture Israel had a a
[2:07:12] captivity under the Assyrians
[2:07:15] they tried to change their
[2:07:18] identification
[2:07:20] so over the generation the people
[2:07:22] started speaking different language and
[2:07:25] there was a form of Separation that that
[2:07:27] came between that group
[2:07:29] so actually the Samaritans they are a
[2:07:32] mixture of Jews and gentiles
[2:07:38] but over the years
[2:07:41] a feeling in the propaganda started
[2:07:43] going around and saying they have no
[2:07:45] dealing with us we don't have no dealing
[2:07:47] so this was a generation crisis
[2:07:54] and whatever you are dealing with in
[2:07:56] your body
[2:07:57] whatever habit
[2:08:00] is a generation
[2:08:02] crisis
[2:08:04] there's something that was handed down
[2:08:06] to you from your great great grandfather
[2:08:14] praise the Lord
[2:08:17] it's trying to take your identity
[2:08:20] that spirit is trying to make you what
[2:08:23] it is
[2:08:27] that was a generation crisis
[2:08:29] we'll keep that for another time
[2:08:35] and Jesus said if thou knew the gift of
[2:08:38] God
[2:08:39] and who it is that said unto thee give
[2:08:42] me to drink
[2:08:44] thou who have asked him
[2:08:48] and he who have given he identified
[2:08:50] something if you knew the gift of God
[2:08:53] that was what that was what attracted
[2:08:56] what attracts the predestinated seed is
[2:08:59] the gift of God
[2:09:01] the predestinated seat is attracted to
[2:09:04] the gift of God because they know that
[2:09:06] that give will stay behind the word
[2:09:10] they are not attracted to a man and his
[2:09:13] personality
[2:09:16] praise the Lord if thou knew the gift of
[2:09:19] God and when she heard that she pay
[2:09:22] attention
[2:09:28] and the woman says you don't even have
[2:09:30] anything
[2:09:31] and this world is deep
[2:09:35] from whence comment that Living Water
[2:09:40] praise the Lord
[2:09:42] are that greater than our father Jacob
[2:09:44] who gave us this will to drink
[2:09:46] and his children
[2:09:49] in Jesus
[2:09:50] answered and said unto her whatsoever
[2:09:53] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[2:09:55] thirst again
[2:09:56] but whosoever drink out of the water
[2:10:00] there and and that's and that's the
[2:10:03] place where
[2:10:05] we have learned also on the brother
[2:10:07] Brandon Ministry that all he was doing
[2:10:10] in that conversation is to contact her
[2:10:12] spirit
[2:10:16] praise the Lord
[2:10:18] he was trying to bring her in the right
[2:10:20] atmosphere he was trying to have a
[2:10:23] conversation he says you want to preach
[2:10:25] to the newspaper man he said talk to him
[2:10:27] about what is on the newspaper say what
[2:10:29] is on the news today
[2:10:33] praise the Lord you want to talk to the
[2:10:35] cow the the milk Setter ask him how many
[2:10:38] cows you get a bottle of milk from
[2:10:42] he said you got to talk about that you
[2:10:43] got to create an atmosphere
[2:10:45] so he was contacting her spirit
[2:10:49] trying to set her because you know
[2:10:52] that is that is one of the thing that we
[2:10:56] we have learned and we are learning
[2:10:59] right praise the Lord
[2:11:03] and that's what many people
[2:11:05] don't realize
[2:11:09] the preaching of the word
[2:11:11] the preaching of the Gospel the purpose
[2:11:14] of the word
[2:11:17] is to contact your spirit
[2:11:22] because that's word
[2:11:24] your greater battle is
[2:11:27] that's where
[2:11:29] that's what has been mad it has been
[2:11:32] wounded
[2:11:33] and like Solomon said a wounded Spirit
[2:11:36] who can heal
[2:11:40] praise the Lord
[2:11:43] so you see her defense her defense to
[2:11:47] Jesus it was because
[2:11:50] she has been wounded in the spirit she
[2:11:52] has given herself to six men and she can
[2:11:55] trust him
[2:11:58] praise the Lord
[2:12:02] I don't believe she what she just wanted
[2:12:04] to be that useless
[2:12:07] but she was looking for somebody to love
[2:12:12] and somebody that would love her back
[2:12:17] praise the Lord better man will talk the
[2:12:20] same build a story of the same for this
[2:12:23] woman he says and one day he was going
[2:12:25] down
[2:12:27] to Jericho that's right straight down
[2:12:30] from Jerusalem instead of going there he
[2:12:33] had need to go by Samira
[2:12:35] which the Samaritan was looking for for
[2:12:38] a messiah too so he came told the city
[2:12:42] of Sacrament and he sent his disciple
[2:12:45] away to buy food and while they were
[2:12:47] gone praise the Lord a little woman came
[2:12:51] he knew that
[2:12:54] they would have first started creating
[2:12:55] doubt because she was a Samaritan
[2:13:01] secondly they would think why is he
[2:13:03] around such a woman don't he know that
[2:13:05] by this time of the day it's only women
[2:13:08] that are not right can come out
[2:13:11] praise the Lord he did not want to know
[2:13:13] hindrance to the move of God he sent him
[2:13:16] away
[2:13:25] and he sent his disciple to a way to buy
[2:13:29] food and why they were gone a little
[2:13:31] woman came out probably a pretty little
[2:13:34] woman
[2:13:35] maybe a child was turned to the street
[2:13:40] by
[2:13:41] parents
[2:13:43] and let her go anyway
[2:13:47] and about like today
[2:13:50] praise the Lord
[2:13:52] and that's what I say is uh you know is
[2:13:54] is is uh we send our children to school
[2:13:59] that is that is for academics
[2:14:02] school don't teach morals
[2:14:07] so you cannot trust the child he says
[2:14:11] well I send you to school you know what
[2:14:13] that we used to hear that back home I
[2:14:15] sent you to school then you come with
[2:14:16] pregnancy
[2:14:22] because because we trust the system we
[2:14:26] think the system is responsible nobody
[2:14:28] is responsible you are responsible you
[2:14:32] the parents you are responsible
[2:14:37] when it comes to morals and and and and
[2:14:39] and and and God in that young mind
[2:14:44] praise the Lord and protecting them
[2:14:51] you can find the best teacher to teach
[2:14:54] them all they will learn is just math
[2:14:55] and science
[2:14:58] for how to behave themselves
[2:15:01] around girls or around boys
[2:15:04] they will not learn it
[2:15:06] from learning math
[2:15:09] some of those teachers in a way are
[2:15:11] perverts
[2:15:18] so brother Brown says see just by
[2:15:21] turning her out
[2:15:23] it just take a common sense of a parent
[2:15:26] now spending much time with the child
[2:15:30] that's just the common sense it can be
[2:15:32] applied to our society
[2:15:41] maybe the child was turned on the street
[2:15:43] by her parents
[2:15:45] and let her go
[2:15:48] and and about like today they talk about
[2:15:52] juvenile delinquent
[2:15:54] delinquent hates his parents
[2:15:55] delinquencies just exactly what it is
[2:15:59] maybe that try hard the same thing
[2:16:03] a mother let her do anything
[2:16:11] praise the Lord
[2:16:15] that's our responsibility
[2:16:18] it is our world's responsibility
[2:16:28] today the word
[2:16:30] the fuss about
[2:16:32] prestigious School
[2:16:37] it's just a new ticket
[2:16:40] praise the Lord
[2:16:42] is just a meal ticket and it brings me
[2:16:45] down to this
[2:16:47] hope I can be able to close here before
[2:16:50] 1 30. you bring me down to this what I
[2:16:52] said on Wednesday night
[2:16:58] when you look at the scripture you look
[2:16:59] through the Old Testament or Through the
[2:17:01] Bible
[2:17:02] and we as we're going through the series
[2:17:04] you get down to to marriage and divorce
[2:17:07] it sounds almost like
[2:17:09] you know the Bible was so
[2:17:12] hard and tough rough and rude on women
[2:17:19] you think about that
[2:17:22] but what what people never realize and I
[2:17:27] will say this to to you this morning
[2:17:30] and uh
[2:17:33] to tell you that there is no I've not
[2:17:38] read in no Christian literature maybe
[2:17:40] it's out there but I've not read it
[2:17:42] there is no preacher that have ever
[2:17:45] brought this subject
[2:17:47] to light
[2:17:49] like the way brother Branham did
[2:17:52] and uh and what the subject is
[2:17:56] talking about the three sacred virtue
[2:18:00] that God gave the woman
[2:18:03] now if you realize that if you realize
[2:18:07] that uh
[2:18:09] God
[2:18:11] empower the man after the fall
[2:18:15] but before the fall God empowered the
[2:18:19] woman
[2:18:23] and that is the place where the word
[2:18:26] don't see all the me too movement and
[2:18:30] all the woman liberation
[2:18:32] sure equal rights is because they don't
[2:18:36] go back and see there they will not be
[2:18:38] able to see it
[2:18:40] because it was only given to a prophet
[2:18:44] and you have the privilege
[2:18:46] to know it
[2:18:50] you have the privilege to know it
[2:18:58] that God will shut down the entire
[2:19:00] creation
[2:19:02] the first time where God will put deep
[2:19:04] sleep on the earth and you check that
[2:19:07] word every time through scripture the
[2:19:09] next time he did it was on Abraham he
[2:19:11] created a deep sleep to fall on Abraham
[2:19:13] why because he was making a covenant of
[2:19:16] redemption
[2:19:20] he will put this sleep on the entire
[2:19:22] Earth even the animals will go to bed
[2:19:27] when he starts to form the woman
[2:19:32] that's why he says there is no
[2:19:35] no creature on the earth is like the
[2:19:38] woman
[2:19:40] praise the Lord
[2:19:45] when he starts to form the woman
[2:19:49] and he will entrust her
[2:19:51] with three Divine sacred virtue
[2:19:59] praise the Lord amen he would give it to
[2:20:02] her
[2:20:03] as her protection
[2:20:08] when Paul over there are instructing to
[2:20:12] me to let a woman keep silence
[2:20:14] in the church
[2:20:17] for it's not
[2:20:18] permitted to a woman to speak
[2:20:21] he was talking about Authority having
[2:20:23] Authority which is preaching the word
[2:20:25] now for you to say Amen
[2:20:27] okay
[2:20:32] but what did he says he said she shall
[2:20:35] be safe
[2:20:39] that was one of her virtues
[2:20:42] that was given to her
[2:20:46] motherhood
[2:20:51] a man can change his body
[2:20:54] foreign
[2:20:57] he can adopt a child you can never be a
[2:21:01] mother
[2:21:02] because it's not given to him it was
[2:21:04] never built in his Gene to be a mother
[2:21:07] you can buy all the toys and talk like
[2:21:10] one
[2:21:16] he can never be a mother
[2:21:19] is is is is God designed
[2:21:24] science can't give it to you
[2:21:33] it's about you that is given to given by
[2:21:36] God
[2:21:44] young sisters
[2:21:47] you have the privilege to know these
[2:21:49] things it's not taught in school
[2:21:54] it's not taught in school you have the
[2:21:57] privilege you have to be a proud child
[2:22:00] of God you have to be a proud daughter
[2:22:03] of God
[2:22:06] that you are taught these things
[2:22:16] praise the Lord
[2:22:18] that you will not allow any kind of a
[2:22:20] stupid ball to sweep you off your face
[2:22:22] feet
[2:22:23] and kiss you and defy you just to drop
[2:22:27] you
[2:22:28] and then run away
[2:22:35] praise the Lord
[2:22:37] you have to be proud of it
[2:22:42] that the first man I would kiss me would
[2:22:44] be before the altar if you are not ready
[2:22:46] to go to the altar you can carry your
[2:22:48] shining teeth
[2:22:52] praise the Lord
[2:22:55] carry your shiny teeth
[2:23:00] is God God designed God give it to her
[2:23:02] as a protection
[2:23:07] you think about it whether in church or
[2:23:09] out of church
[2:23:13] a young woman coming up in a in a
[2:23:15] community in a society she's looking so
[2:23:17] bright she is appreciated by anybody you
[2:23:20] think about it what happened the devil
[2:23:22] starts to raise all sorts of uh uh uh
[2:23:25] crazy boys around and what they want to
[2:23:27] do they want to just defy her that's all
[2:23:30] they want to do
[2:23:31] and when when that is done she's no
[2:23:34] longer at the pretty girl again
[2:23:35] everybody have her news in the in the
[2:23:38] entire Community why because the devil
[2:23:41] knows that if he can do that
[2:23:43] yeah yeah that's the word amen
[2:23:47] she will not find the strength
[2:23:50] to be able to make something out of her
[2:23:52] life unless she has the support
[2:23:57] unless she has the support
[2:24:05] praise the Lord
[2:24:10] and parents will use that
[2:24:12] instead of realizing that they did not
[2:24:15] provide protection they will use that
[2:24:18] and continue on trashing their children
[2:24:20] down
[2:24:21] right
[2:24:23] true
[2:24:24] okay you did that to yourself and you
[2:24:26] allowed there to happen
[2:24:28] to realize she having two movements
[2:24:32] she's a woman
[2:24:33] you can build her up back to decency
[2:24:35] right she can be a decent lady
[2:24:40] so she can be a mother
[2:24:49] having a bunch of things here I want to
[2:24:50] read to you but I'll do it another time
[2:24:53] time is not allowing us
[2:25:02] praise the Lord
[2:25:04] and message Paradox what what makes a
[2:25:06] paradise is when somebody believed God
[2:25:09] and take him at his word God word spoke
[2:25:13] the word into existence that's the same
[2:25:16] thing that
[2:25:18] the same thing you have to believe
[2:25:20] tonight
[2:25:21] is God's promised word are we together
[2:25:31] look uh look at that poor little woman
[2:25:35] standing there at the well she said we
[2:25:38] know when the Messiah cometh
[2:25:42] he will tell us these things
[2:25:48] he had he had told her what her trouble
[2:25:51] was
[2:25:53] she says sir I perceive that you are a
[2:25:56] prophet
[2:25:58] you know when Amazon
[2:26:00] we know when the Messiah cometh he will
[2:26:04] tell us those things
[2:26:06] watch God talking to a halot glory to
[2:26:12] God
[2:26:13] amen and we Sinners saved by grace we
[2:26:16] will not try we're not there trying to
[2:26:18] do it
[2:26:18] but God talking to a Herald
[2:26:25] we see not saved by grace our first
[2:26:27] attitude would to despise her
[2:26:32] God talking to a hall of Glory to God
[2:26:35] God talking to a prostitute amen
[2:26:39] and asking a favor
[2:26:42] bring me a drink
[2:26:44] think of it
[2:26:46] pause think of it
[2:26:49] almighty God
[2:26:54] what is our attitude
[2:26:57] we first stop despising them using our
[2:27:01] eyes to go from head to toe
[2:27:06] if God will look at us like that would
[2:27:08] disappear from the Earth
[2:27:10] talk about a paradox
[2:27:13] and water Paradox that
[2:27:15] their sea of eternal life
[2:27:18] predestinated before the foundation of
[2:27:21] the word
[2:27:22] who group out in such a thing as dead
[2:27:27] by the desired of the flesh
[2:27:29] how thou poor little woman probably
[2:27:32] turned on the street but down in her
[2:27:35] heart
[2:27:37] she was a she was predestinated
[2:27:40] to internal life
[2:27:44] praise the Lord
[2:27:46] amen
[2:27:47] and that's where the battle comes young
[2:27:49] people
[2:27:52] you you you don't have to make the walls
[2:27:56] of your body
[2:27:57] the battles in your mind and in all the
[2:28:00] battles in your in your in your in your
[2:28:02] in your flesh and your your your uh you
[2:28:05] know everything that is happening all of
[2:28:08] those desired
[2:28:09] you have you have to you have to you
[2:28:12] have to draw the Divine line
[2:28:15] look at the things your soul desire do
[2:28:18] you really want God
[2:28:19] you really want the Holy Ghost you
[2:28:21] really want to be a son of God
[2:28:27] or you just so overtaking and dominated
[2:28:29] by the by the desired of the flesh
[2:28:35] I want a wife and I want it now I want
[2:28:37] to get married I want my home now
[2:28:43] praise the Lord
[2:28:45] is that where you are
[2:28:54] you have to you have to realize
[2:28:57] you are coming forth by God's promised
[2:29:00] word
[2:29:02] amen you are coming forward by God's
[2:29:04] promised word and God have all of those
[2:29:07] things in store for you
[2:29:12] he have it in store for you
[2:29:16] praise the Lord
[2:29:19] amen
[2:29:21] there are some young women they have you
[2:29:23] know they have missed fortune in their
[2:29:26] lives
[2:29:27] but they have been able to pick up
[2:29:29] themselves up from the arches
[2:29:32] and they have made themselves decent and
[2:29:35] respected women
[2:29:37] even in their area of profession
[2:29:40] people respect him
[2:29:43] why because they help the whole to their
[2:29:45] virtue of Womanhood
[2:29:50] they have made themselves decent and
[2:29:53] respected women
[2:30:03] they are not going to make themselves a
[2:30:05] victim
[2:30:10] praise the Lord
[2:30:11] so we see Brother Band identifying the
[2:30:14] other
[2:30:14] the desire for flesh you know she she
[2:30:18] she struggled it turned her on the
[2:30:20] street but down in her heart
[2:30:24] and she brought a Revival to Samira
[2:30:27] that in Acts chapter 8 when Philip went
[2:30:30] to Samira he met people that believed
[2:30:33] the Lord Jesus
[2:30:36] it was from this one woman testimony
[2:30:40] because in her was a predestinated scene
[2:30:45] I was ready to pick her up
[2:30:48] pick her up from her wrong
[2:30:53] praise the Lord
[2:30:55] she did not care who says what
[2:30:58] she says come and see the man
[2:31:01] they have told me the things I have done
[2:31:03] what have he told you he told me that I
[2:31:06] had six husbands I don't know how he
[2:31:07] knew about it
[2:31:09] even told me the one I slept with she
[2:31:11] was I mean that is the effect of the
[2:31:14] pattern
[2:31:15] when the pattern drops in
[2:31:18] a destroy guilt
[2:31:22] you don't order your life by what people
[2:31:24] think you order your life about what God
[2:31:27] says about you
[2:31:30] you don't have to look over your
[2:31:32] shoulder either
[2:31:34] praise the Lord you step as a Son of God
[2:31:37] or as a daughter of God
[2:31:47] identify Christ in all ages now what
[2:31:50] what if I'm I'm speaking here to a
[2:31:53] person
[2:31:54] that could actually
[2:31:57] cannot receive it
[2:32:00] there's nothing in him to receive it but
[2:32:04] the Bible says she delivered in pleasure
[2:32:06] is there why she liveth why was it those
[2:32:10] Pharisees look at Jesus
[2:32:13] all that we know
[2:32:15] he was the manifested word of God we
[2:32:19] believe that the Bible said it was well
[2:32:21] watch when when he done his Masonic sign
[2:32:27] the Pharisees
[2:32:29] that had a little bit of light they had
[2:32:33] a little bit of light because everything
[2:32:35] they were doing they were doing that by
[2:32:37] the Lord
[2:32:38] amen they had a little bit of light
[2:32:42] those men that had a little bit of light
[2:32:44] there was good people
[2:32:46] they lived a good Christian Life or a
[2:32:50] good religious life
[2:32:52] they had a little bit of light about
[2:32:54] them their heart they have organized
[2:32:57] in a priesthood they had a little light
[2:33:00] but down in the bottom of their heart
[2:33:04] they had no internal representation
[2:33:09] in glory
[2:33:13] they can play religion play
[2:33:16] righteousness
[2:33:17] pray play better than everybody else
[2:33:21] but deep down
[2:33:23] the heart no
[2:33:25] internal representation
[2:33:29] praise the Lord
[2:33:32] how do we know
[2:33:34] that we have internal representation
[2:33:37] it is not an emotional feeling
[2:33:39] right no no it's not an emotional
[2:33:43] feeling
[2:33:43] we call it a revelation
[2:33:46] it's not a dream that you had
[2:33:50] it's your faith
[2:33:54] the only thing that we hold
[2:33:57] ties all to Heaven is our faith
[2:34:06] praise the lord it's not your dream you
[2:34:09] hide
[2:34:10] or the way you feel in your heart
[2:34:13] it's just emotional
[2:34:16] praise the Lord
[2:34:18] but is that fate
[2:34:22] what's God said
[2:34:24] I believe you because he said it and the
[2:34:27] one that said it do not lie
[2:34:38] praise the Lord I believe it on his
[2:34:41] child
[2:34:42] I believe it
[2:34:43] because I know where I was I know what I
[2:34:46] am now
[2:34:47] I believe it and I believe that Grace is
[2:34:50] able to carry me father on is that fate
[2:34:56] is that fate
[2:34:58] it's not a conception
[2:35:00] it has to be a fate something you hold
[2:35:03] on
[2:35:10] in the bottom of the heart they have no
[2:35:13] representation in glory
[2:35:16] all they were hauling to is because I'm
[2:35:19] born of the Trap of Joseph
[2:35:21] and born of the Trap of Benjamin I'm
[2:35:25] born on the Trap that's all they were
[2:35:27] holding to
[2:35:29] all right that's all they were holding
[2:35:31] to and holding to Rachel's dressing
[2:35:34] right and walking right
[2:35:37] down
[2:35:40] in the no internal representation
[2:35:46] so when they're seeing the supernatural
[2:35:48] done they said that man it's a vegetable
[2:35:51] a devil
[2:35:54] how could they reject the very one
[2:35:57] that they were waiting for
[2:35:59] the one they call their Messiah you ask
[2:36:01] them where is the Messiah they would say
[2:36:03] he had to be God in flesh
[2:36:09] why they couldn't see it
[2:36:14] because it's not your intelligence that
[2:36:16] make you to see it people
[2:36:18] it's not your intelligence
[2:36:24] the predestinator see
[2:36:26] that God deposited in your heart
[2:36:30] because there are people that are out
[2:36:32] there that are more smarter than you
[2:36:38] and what happened
[2:36:40] when they did that
[2:36:42] this man is a vegetable and what
[2:36:44] happened
[2:36:45] they pulled out
[2:36:48] they put what lie they had out
[2:36:51] because they refuse it
[2:36:54] but yes a little infinite woman a
[2:36:57] prostitute down in her heart
[2:37:00] she had a representation
[2:37:03] of one of God's thoughts
[2:37:07] that's the reason why he had to go by
[2:37:09] Samira
[2:37:10] because one of his thoughts
[2:37:13] was caught
[2:37:16] I was just reading setting on this
[2:37:19] and as I saw something brother Graham
[2:37:21] said in Masterpiece it just it just it
[2:37:24] just caught my attention of standing on
[2:37:27] it and preaching it you know he talks
[2:37:29] about how God's Masterpiece was kind
[2:37:37] all of God's children
[2:37:42] are his masterpiece but we were all scar
[2:37:45] by sin
[2:37:46] and scarred by different things
[2:37:49] some of the things that God will have to
[2:37:51] pull us out of
[2:37:54] the abuse and all the things
[2:37:58] that neglect and things that we went
[2:38:00] through
[2:38:02] they have Sky us
[2:38:05] but you see God watch over that seed in
[2:38:09] you
[2:38:10] praise the Lord
[2:38:12] and he said all that the father has
[2:38:14] given me
[2:38:15] will come and I will not lose one
[2:38:32] down in her house she had a
[2:38:34] representation of the one God
[2:38:38] of one of God's thoughts there she was
[2:38:41] waited in sin
[2:38:44] heaven with embarrassment on her
[2:38:46] shoulders she cannot show up with the
[2:38:49] other women
[2:38:51] she had the weight of sin burden on her
[2:38:55] down in her
[2:39:01] heart it's a representation
[2:39:05] when the Messiah come
[2:39:08] he would do these things
[2:39:10] when Jesus said I am he
[2:39:14] oh my God there was nothing to stop her
[2:39:18] there was no wrong that she have ever
[2:39:21] done that she can be embarrassed of
[2:39:24] when Jesus said I am he it hit her
[2:39:29] it went straight down to that
[2:39:31] predestinated soul
[2:39:32] and as he rise up in her give her such a
[2:39:36] strength and she ran down and said come
[2:39:38] and see the man
[2:39:39] that have told me the things that I've
[2:39:41] done
[2:39:42] praise the Lord
[2:39:53] people
[2:39:56] if we would just realize
[2:40:00] if we will just realize the grace that
[2:40:02] have come to us in this age
[2:40:06] this message has not come
[2:40:08] to wash your mind and make you smarter
[2:40:12] find quotes where you can run other
[2:40:13] people down
[2:40:15] this message this word has come to heal
[2:40:17] our spirit
[2:40:20] it has come to heal our spirit
[2:40:24] it goes out
[2:40:25] to some of the dark areas of Our Lives
[2:40:29] the area that only you God and the devil
[2:40:32] knows
[2:40:37] praise the Lord
[2:40:39] come to heal our spirit amen
[2:40:43] because a wounded spirit
[2:40:46] who can heal
[2:40:50] who can heal
[2:40:55] and most of the time people
[2:40:58] that have been wounded
[2:41:01] because those things lay back in our
[2:41:03] subconscious
[2:41:06] we take protective measure
[2:41:10] sometimes on our surrounding or even on
[2:41:14] our children
[2:41:16] and we don't realize that we are
[2:41:19] reacting
[2:41:21] to the heart
[2:41:25] we don't realize that why because it's
[2:41:28] in your subconscious
[2:41:31] praise the Lord
[2:41:34] statistics have proven that then there
[2:41:37] are abused
[2:41:42] out of 10.
[2:41:43] the end of abusing others
[2:41:46] not in an intentional way
[2:41:50] not in an intentional way
[2:41:52] they either become overprotective
[2:41:57] or they just shut everybody out
[2:42:00] see a person behaving like that
[2:42:03] a person has been being wounded
[2:42:06] they just love the dark
[2:42:18] but he that his son
[2:42:23] is free in there
[2:42:25] this word has come
[2:42:28] to set us free
[2:42:31] he has come to raise our spirit up
[2:42:35] praise the Lord
[2:42:36] amen he has come to raise our spirit up
[2:42:39] I'll have another time and talk on these
[2:42:42] three virtues the other things that are
[2:42:44] concerned the church that I want to
[2:42:46] bring in in the full light so I'll have
[2:42:48] a time to talk about it
[2:42:49] but uh uh that's that's that's a that's
[2:42:52] that's the representation
[2:42:54] to realize that every one of us in our
[2:42:57] past life and things that we have done
[2:43:04] out of our family we were
[2:43:06] born in the things that happened
[2:43:09] praise the Lord we all should talk about
[2:43:11] things that are happening or growing up
[2:43:13] and different things
[2:43:15] I mean we can have it the rest of the
[2:43:16] year service
[2:43:18] and we will still not be done
[2:43:22] we all have a story
[2:43:24] [Music]
[2:43:26] we all have a story
[2:43:30] praise the Lord amen but the beauty of
[2:43:33] our story
[2:43:36] the beauty of our story
[2:43:39] praising the savior
[2:43:42] all the day alone amen he has changed
[2:43:45] our story
[2:43:47] amen
[2:43:50] that you can we cannot talk about
[2:43:51] anything of the past
[2:43:54] we found praising the savior
[2:44:00] now glorifying the flesh
[2:44:03] taking the credit or the boss
[2:44:05] or praising the Savior that Grace
[2:44:08] has been able to cut us and bring us
[2:44:11] here
[2:44:12] is because of that deposit that God put
[2:44:15] in you
[2:44:20] face that we have gone through things
[2:44:23] that we inherited from our our parents
[2:44:26] that run down through our Jain
[2:44:29] that we struggle with
[2:44:31] the down in your soul
[2:44:35] there's a seed of God
[2:44:37] there is something that keeps pushing
[2:44:40] you to God
[2:44:42] something that keeps pushing you
[2:44:46] even if you feel so bad and says you
[2:44:49] know I'm done with that
[2:44:51] you wake up Sunday morning you're lying
[2:44:53] on the bed you say what shirt am I going
[2:44:55] to wear
[2:44:57] praise the Lord
[2:44:59] amen
[2:45:02] and something picks you up
[2:45:07] is that seed of God yes
[2:45:11] is that thing inside
[2:45:13] wanting you
[2:45:15] even if you never had the best of father
[2:45:19] they want to make you a better father
[2:45:22] if you never have parental love or care
[2:45:25] something inside you is telling you I
[2:45:29] want to be better
[2:45:35] praise the Lord
[2:45:37] you are not looking to the past to make
[2:45:39] excuses musician you can come
[2:45:42] you're not making look into the past to
[2:45:43] make excuses
[2:45:45] or I grew up this way well that's the
[2:45:47] way I grew up no
[2:45:52] you are fine the hope you find the
[2:45:55] source
[2:45:56] you have found a fountain
[2:46:02] that's giving you the desire to be
[2:46:04] better
[2:46:12] praise the Lord
[2:46:16] to realize
[2:46:19] [Music]
[2:46:21] that God in his Mercy
[2:46:25] will teach us these things
[2:46:29] and we get down to uh the mauritian
[2:46:31] devil series brother Branham will start
[2:46:34] to speak there and say
[2:46:36] because of misinterpreted to your logic
[2:46:42] the church instead of pointing us to
[2:46:44] Christ they all took their form of
[2:46:46] Doctrine
[2:46:49] many of us
[2:46:51] [Music]
[2:46:53] grew up for all of these different
[2:46:56] things
[2:46:58] but God has come in this dead and age he
[2:47:01] has come in our time while we are still
[2:47:04] alive we breath in our body
[2:47:08] you don't have no reason to
[2:47:11] blame anybody
[2:47:13] you don't have no reason to keep holding
[2:47:15] some kind of for
[2:47:18] a grudge or
[2:47:20] feeling in your heart of somebody
[2:47:22] [Music]
[2:47:24] that abuse you many years ago
[2:47:27] no

[2:47:43] they are no longer coming to a message
[2:47:45] Church
[2:47:46] but they still believe in decency
[2:47:51] I still believe in decency thank you
[2:47:53] it's not because they don't believe that
[2:47:55] there is no God
[2:47:57] it's just because
[2:48:00] preachers
[2:48:02] have hurt them
[2:48:07] people have been abused in church
[2:48:09] sitting on the preachers
[2:48:12] preachers that can see no good in in the
[2:48:15] people of the preached on
[2:48:21] they want to log in a message for
[2:48:23] insults
[2:48:24] [Music]
[2:48:27] all they can see is just condemnation
[2:48:34] they don't have anything to live the
[2:48:35] people's Spirit up
[2:48:39] and tell them
[2:48:41] there's a raising Christ
[2:48:43] [Music]
