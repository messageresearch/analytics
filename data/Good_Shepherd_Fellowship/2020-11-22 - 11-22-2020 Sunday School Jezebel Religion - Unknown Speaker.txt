may disagree doesn't stomp out of the building that just shows your literacy but someday you'll realize someday you long and know that it's the truth I speak it in the name of the Lord H myself up for a Target which finally will drive me to the Grave I'm going to be a witness till I die God will help me that's right here we are in this condition we are today all of it going on like that in Israel how Ahab did a figurehead for Jezebel cuz he he was married to her America our leader how did our you know our leader was a rich man how many know that a multi-millionaire somebody told me in a magazine or some radio or television or something Jack Vinny or somebody made a Ernie forward I believe was somebody said that his father helped him get two states that he didn't own just about owns the rest of it how did he get it how did that money come through the whiskey traffic and liquor that's reason he dropped the taxes on Whiskey and stuff that's what made him a rich man the very thing that damned our nation the very thing that corrupted the minds of our people the thing that sent our boys to be drunkers and our girls to be prostitutes amen the money off of that made him a rich man the same thing that old jezz belel system the same thing that persecuted our people the same thing that Dr them out in romanism and burned them and pulled them apart and done everything to them the same blood of the MERS the Bible said is in her there they are married together and we Americans stagger right on oh well we got a few extra dollars and we're having a good time time better off in all the rest of the Nations but brother you just wait a minute let's take it letter by letter now for the next few minutes see what happened the preachers got right along his knck down with them went right on with them all the system the whole Israelite system went right on with jeel they had a farm yes and don't the Bible tell us that in this last days we'll have a farm of [Music] godliness all the prophecies are fulfilled brother we're at the end nationally we at the end spiritually we are at the end every system is at its end next thing is the coming of the Lord and the translation of the [Music] church God sent every sign Wonder done everything he could do trying to go people and constantly they move right on in look at this town here look at this country around here with tens of hundreds and hundreds of Pentecostal people and because of standing on Truth where they at this afternoon amen because someone told him not to cooperate with the meeting you poor deliberate God be merciful to you it's only thing I can saying when you Christians gotten a more backbone than that you got a wishbone instead of a backbone right what we need is preach the gospel with teeth in it that'll chop the thing to Pieces what just like the rest of them then you wonder why we holler about it then you see you get the cold shoulder I expect it I have to all this went on in Israel finally one day com stomping out of the Wilderness come an old hairy looking fell Elijah the tishbite he never come up out any their organizations come out of the Wilderness he had nothing to do with him he was a prophet of the Lord Brother he Shu that Jezebel Kingdom for everything was in [Music] it they hated him he had no cooperation I guarantee you that the Bible says not certainly he made them painted face Jezebels burn up I imagine he laid the ax to the root of the tree like John did the chips fall wherever there was you but he laid her in there he shut the nation showing that they were wrong in trying to call them back to a true Living God back to his word instead of a jezebel worship what did they do to the receive him they hated him but his word went forth just the same because he had thus sayeth the Lord God worked with him he showed he was anointed Prophet by the things that he said coming to pass and all that he did prove that he was God's Prophet but yet they would not believe it because he tore up their playhouses he told them that they were wrong Ahab was arrested about amen true and you notice they didn't believe him but he preached it just the same now the preachers agreed with him amen he said I'm the only ones left Lord look at him they won't even want nobody will cooperate but he had a mission to do and he did it he had the word of the Lord thus sayeth the Lord and he attacked in the nation he attacked in the church he attacked everything there was and God was with him we are promised in the last days that he will return to this country too I know Jesus when Matthew 17 when they asked him why the scribes say Elias watch what he said Elias truly must first come pack in the future tense but then he give John as an example John wasn't Malachi 4 John was Malachi 3 behold I send a messenger before me to prepare the way Malachi 4 he said before the great and turrible day of the Lord shall come when all the Earth will be burned like a stubble before that day out send Elijah and it wasn't John because the Lord never burnt the earth when John came and if you notice in the end the last chapter of the last verse he said and he watch he talking shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers now watch the first John came the first Elijah what did he do he came and brought a message and turned the old Orthodox hard Hearts to the faith of the young Church the children but when the next Elijah comes in the end time he's to go back and take the the father's Hearts the children's Hearts rather and turn them back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers see the difference he'll not be one of these here so-call we have today he'll go right back back to Acts 2 and start right from now he'll preach the unadulterated gospel just say the same things that Peter did on the day of Pentecost because what he said on Pentecost has been decayed the rest of scriptures through you'll not twist around with some organization when Elijah comes he'll hate women like Elijah did just like or bad women just like John did you'll be a Wilderness lover just like they were you'll not spare we're looking for him to come he'll come God said he would and he'll be here I believe if anything the message that we got today will forerun that great coming of him yes [Music] sir and he's on his road already born like Elijah was and come busting out of the Wilderness somewhere he'll make he known he'll preach acts two he'll bring the faith of these old Pentecostal fathers right back to the the faith of these Pentecostal children right back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers he'll go right back to Acts 2 acts 238 all down through he'll bring the real unadulterated gospel he'll not have anything to do with Jezebel and her system you'll be a servant of God sure will the Bible said he would come he'll prophesy and bust his message in the face of these Jezebels just exactly like Elijah did in the beginning to Israel they all hate him they won't cooperate with him no no he'll come God promised it and he'll arise on the scene he'll he'll preach to the elected church as he said he would shaking that elect shaking the carnish off of it the the world and things shaking it down Bing it down getting a church together of people I know you say that's my denomination brother you're wrong John came as a Onan system introduce a one man Jesus Christ and the Elijah will not be a system it'll be a man Jesus said so it'll be one man that's anointed of the Holy Ghost and he won't introduce any three or four Gods he'll introduce one the Lord Jesus Christ because his message will shake the Pentecostal children back to the faith of the fathers again you remember brother I say these things to be nasty I need to be at the altar I'm telling you thus sayith the Lord God hasn't Vindicated I've told you the truth around the nation around the world then tell me where the mistake was I'm telling you the truth get back to God quickly get out of these systems cu the Bible said in the book of re ations that the Roman Catholic hierarchy was a and she was a mother of Harlot what is that Church's systems and where did the Methodist Church where did the Lutheran Church come from where did the Methodist Baptist where did all organizations come from God never did organize a Church Catholic Church said they begin back there with Jesus organized the church I want I want the page in history or the page in the Bible there never was an organization for 306 years at the death of the last Apostle then they formed the United City Council and made an organization and when Luther came out he was a great man of God but as soon as he left that little group of people went over and formed another organization then the Holy Spirit went out on John wesle he never organized anything but after he left then they organized then the Holy Ghost come in the Pentecostals and they went out from the Methodist and what happened then they organized but there will be a on man system come forth with the power and the anointing of Elijah to fulfill the Hallelujah he'll shake it and remember he prophesied to him and prophesied and told him all the things and God worked with him but his final message was attacked on the White [Music] House when John came his final message was attacked on the White House of that day Elijah's final message when he walked down that road that morning after being in the presence of God out there walk down that road with old hairs all over him the bald head shining the whiskers blowing them little eyes it's gleaming with the glory of God that's sticking his hand his feet just as study as they could be what's he doing walking right down from samarra into the presence of the White House and saying thus sayith the Lord fearing nothing the churches have turned him down the people turned him down so now he's given his final attack upon the White House then what happened after that [Music] listen after that attack his voice became quiet nobody heard him no more God called him off the scene that Elijah you've done Maj your message KN to all of Israel they know what I come up here in the wilderness get away from them separate yourself because I'm going to do something I'm going to show them what it is to turn my message down what's set in war famine starvation thus sayith the Holy Spirit watch what's coming watch what's going to follow that was the f famine there will be a famine oh maybe not for bread but for hearing the word of God and is truth all the churches will socialize and go right on into it just the same like they've already been swallowed up with it what did Elijah do he found a Hidden Spring Way up in the mountain where he got some Water of Life Divine Revelations from God is he set up there under the power power of God the revelations get a little Hidden Spring while the rest of them was famishing God bless his servants them Ravens they brought him something to eat while he was isolated from the people and they were down there famishing for Revival and all going on don't hear no more of his revivals that where is that old crank he goes around blasting our organization where's he at now they didn't know he pulled himself with God out into a isolated place where they didn't hear his voice then they begin to see when God sends forth a message and tells the people and they don't receive it then he withdraws his servant and sends his pledge amen H death spiritually speaking physically also you watch for a depression brother you think you've seen something you just wait after a while you haven't se seen nothing you think we were dying for a good spiritual Revival you wait till after a b you just wait long and cry to hear the word of God the Bible said so there will be a famine in the last days said the prophet not for bread and water alone but for hearing the true word of God but that voice will be quiet in the wilderness somewhere get away he ordained the Ravens his servants bless them Birds he his servants that kept the voice of of Elijah alive during the time of his isolation from the church the Ravens brought him flesh and bread at morning and flesh and bread in the evening and he drank from the little Fountain while the rest of them down there were doing without any spiritual food and water then one day after sin had tuck its toll and God brought his people to their knees Jezebel took every everything she wiped it all up and she'll do it again that's thus sayth God's holy Bible she'll do it again she's right on the throne now behind the figurehead twis it any way she wants to and nobody's going to stop her turn nobody's going to stop it now because what they couldn't get in the religious circles they cut cut it all into politics and there they done it it's exactly what they done which a political will be a boycot just exactly back to the mark of the beast as sure as I'm standing here the Bible said I know we're getting late I'll hurry I got to get this last word in if the Lord will let me watch Elijah stayed up there until God moved him he had no revivals he preached not against nothing he just stood up there with God Alone out in the wilderness cuz he's a Wilderness man raised in the wilderness so was John raised in the wilderness he went out in the wilderness alone with God tuck away from the church after he give his message and the church turned it down turned it down and fr of the organization wouldn't do nothing so he just had to move out God called him off the scene tuck him on out in the wilderness so come on out here they won't listen anymore come on then I'm going to throw my judgment up on them oh yes you'll be here one of these days you watch then after the days of his prophecy what happened the church Lang the great pair of Jezebel she tuck them all in herself gooped them all up tuck them in herself and buil Groves and everything else but one day God called him out again here he come out listen close don't get angry with me I'm saying thus sayeth the Lord when he come out what did God do he sent him to a widow woman she once had a um man power over her head but it took death to set her free so she could believe the prophet's [Music] word you notice that she had a husband had guid her to this way and that way in one of the schools down there but during this great drought he'd been gooped up death at tucking she was no more hooked in any organization so she's ready now to hear the word of the Lord a woman meaning the church a widow that her husband organization had died and she just barely thinks she's living herself God said go down to her now can you hear you I've commanded her oh we think sometimes you little group there that's so faithful and do everything you can to have a meeting to try to show to the people that your hearts right you want them to get right you think you're having a hard time but remember God's got his eye on you you love him I know you love him you wouldn't set here you wouldn't tend any such a thing God's got his eye on you yes and when he did her husband had died her organization died so now she's ready to hear the prophet's word so when the Prophet come to the gate and asked her for a little water she went to get it then he said bring me a marshall of meal and she turned and said as the Lord lives I don't have nothing but just enough not look like that he was sent to take what little she had but it was vice versa when she was willing to give what she had to the support of the word God fed her and if you're willing to give What Spirit you do have what spirit that God's give you to support of the word then God will keep you Al hallelujah oh glory to [Music] God do you see it Church don't think I'm beside myself I'm not but what you have got what little you do believe in God what faith you have God place it on the word not on organization put it in God's word you'll keep you alive she was ready then cuz she couldn't before cuz it wouldn't let her but now she's ready will she receive it God sent a prophet her way will she receive his word will she receive this Prophet yes she did and he told her said now what little life you have God place it here and bring it to me first and what happened when the rest of the world was languishing and dying in hunger her and her children and her household all eat three good meals a day divine revelation on the word I hope you see it friends what went on he stayed there until the famine was over living with this woman this church that received him and believed his word and he kept her alive kept the church Alive by the word of the Lord because he said thus sayith the [Music] Lord now we haven't got time to take the rest of the story out you know how he had to come to a showdown with bale you'll do it one of these days you worry when he comes stomping out of that Wilderness you watch what takes place what happened then when good old Elijah the prophet a true servant of God come to the end of his Road God told him one day he said Elijah You' preached long enough now you fought jezebell and All Over Paint and everything so you've had enough of it said come down to the [Music] Jorden here he goes got down to the Jorden there the old muddy stream coming down out there chilly icy water like every man has to face Jordan death but when this great servant of God walked down in the Jordan and his son walking by him gospel son oh yes it was his son my father and my father the Chariots of Israel the horsemen thereof when he and his son walked arm in arm down to the jarden he watching his daddy leave that morning when he got out the jarden reached around and got that robe of power off of his shoulders the death you can't do nothing to me and he struck the G get away I'm crossing over this morning what happened she moved back and dried like powder what was the old Prophet doing he's looking across jarden you know there's a chariot waiting for him over there with the horses he's going home his work was over his son the gospel was taking his place I coming home the other day from out west this comes on my [Music] mind I turned the radio on I had Drive 3 days 2400 mil by myself I turn the radio on I hearing spirituals out of Del Rio
