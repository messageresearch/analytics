morning praise the lord hallelujah and your glory be to god he's all impossible let's let's read a little portion here menthol noun in hebrews the 11th chapter the chapter oh i got a great strain of them wrote down here generally are these heroes of faith this is it was the key to the door that's that stopped the martha lyons it was the kid of faith unlocked the present house it was fate of faith la claire de la four queens the violence of the the violence of fire yeah i tell have you lost the first escape the edge of the sword is always sharper with control brought the dead back that man symptom that woman said the farm who can take that kid of faith keep upon the set clear de la four they can unlock every promise god made promiscuous [Music] we say amen amen but if you haven't got that key receiving of the perfectly you are just probing you that the juice incredible you will never unlock it are the shoulders here exactly and it takes a setting form it's a point second form as a certain shape of them keys in certain fashion to turn the levers and just one little level out of the way monk will will will mess the whole thing up therefore i believe dog in the full gospel every word of how many believe that this morning from your question believe that this morning amen amen there all the power of god amen amen amen amen amen that turn his blessing to the people [Applause] the open hallelujah blessing of redemption [Applause] [Music] amen church hey open your spirit open your mind understand the scriptures amen amen you get the understanding of the scriptures there is not a person on earth that the devil is afraid of come like why aren't there someone that believed in this message because the devil knows these people he never policy he cannot said this you know that he cannot use them [Applause] in the message look i want to encourage you with this guy what's your fixie uh focus keep your eyes fixed guys what you're fixing amen on the word of god the word of god always is right and apart that's the reason why oh okay okay okay uh i have a i have a jack okay in a when that when that joker comes out that is the absolute reason absolutely when you when you when when you have a card and you have the the joker in your hands okay when when you bring that one out that's the end of the game absolutely amen amen i have i have a joker let me let me give you my joke what is my joker feminine don't he says if something happened or if something if something rises secretly if something comes up a precision write it down in your bible see cancer shows if there is anything forever that comes up i've talked about greater than this call me a false prophet of prophetic and sense [Applause] stay with the message can we say [Applause] abraham saw it abraham love you he did not look to any of the misunderstanding of the promise so so there was misunderstanding of the promise so there was misunderstanding of the promises is that misunderstanding the message yes there is many we the children we i made a promise amen take it again my friend take it again abraham saw it abram he did not look at any misunderstanding of the promise oh there was misunderstanding oh abraham saying now i'm old and my wife sarah is old she's always incomprehensible it's misunderstanding do you have here oh my uh uh my friend you are you are old family va yo yo those are misunderstood questions those are questions abraham by abraham they are written it was him that god spoke to him he amen amen amen what if he would have looked and said yeah i'm 75 years old overseas yes or something and such and such a voice spoke to me and said i'm to have a baby by my wife she is 65 years old about 15 20 years past menopause what will he have done but what did he do like a skilled affair he never pay attention inappropriate attention to what the natural things worse you added we look at what god said exactly i'd like to say the way brother billy paul says he says if god thought about it um it becomes such a reality to him till he didn't see nothing else discussing every dot about what god said he said second year he left his house he separated [Music] that's what every genuine believer has to do separate yourself from these doubters and unbelievers thank you and walk with christians we find him still believing the word the pastor completely there were a lot of things that proved that this promise would never come true all was proving that this would not happen but he caught everything that was contrary to the world let [Applause] come oh many things will happen god bless you richland shalom to you amen amen god bless you [Applause] i will stop here may the lord bless you church shalom to you amen amen praise the lord hallelujah amen glory be to god you love the lord this morning amen in that same spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body praise the lord it will quicken your mortal body hallelujah sin john chapter one is now the service beginning amen praise the lord oh praise the lord amen what a word what a message this morning amen praise the lord you know i i prayed i hope that the lord was able to help me to to translate i hope you got what the message was amen they are quick and empowered if it comes upon you it changed your life it's it's a must it's a must this message has come to make us sons and daughters of god anything less than that you have not come in contact with the message [Music] you can have all the tips you can have all the books anything less praise the lord that was the reason why brother branham said the highlight of his ministry was the talking and what is the talking is the life of the sacrifice coming back on the worshiper that's the highlight because the life of the blood and bulls and gods could not come back on the worshiper but a worshiper once parched when he comes in the presence of god and meet his maker praise the lord amen you see that's the reason why it looks like the way it looks because this is a high standard is a high standard that's the reason why god brought us a ministry of the son of man the son of man being revealed praise the lord a man born of an alcoholic father and a poor mother he had no human change to escape being the drunkard brother branham had no human chance to escape being a drunkard but god presented him and i believe that seeing god can keep you young people from drugs and from sex from every foolishness that sin almighty god can keep you god kept him [Applause] [Music] praise the lord even when he was uh he was tempted by his friends the father said you are a sexy billy and he wanted to drink almighty god gave him a discomforting experience but that will win every time he comes it discomfort him he didn't know what it was and sometimes god has to put you in a discomforting position to get your attention [Music] praise the lord you lose sleep at night just so he can get your attention he had no possible chance to escape being a drunkard he took that quickening power he took that quickening power praise the lord amen because almighty god that said do not smoke do not drink do not defy your body it was god that gave the commandment and it was not in brother branham to keep the zeal of the law performed it was the zeal of the lord that performed and that seemed you is here today the quickening power is nothing but the zeal of the lord to bring the promise of god to pass in your life praise the lord sir john chapter one let's just look there and pick up something this morning that's i mean i i mean that's it's that's that's just a message anything less than that we don't have a message anything less than the holy ghost anything less than the new birth we don't have a message we are just building a cut for ourself [Music] we cannot come short of there praise the lord amen verse 11 he came unto his own and his own receive him net but as many as receive him praise the lord that's that's what we do we receive him we give our life to christ you are receiving him you come to church to receive him but you you will never be any better by just receiving him you will never be any better by just receiving the message as many as receiving to them give he power what is that power it's the quickening power to them you you were always a son of god but there is something that needed to bring the reality to you something needed to quicken you and say i'm a son of god i can't stay down in this place drinking and smoking no that's the thing that makes you talk to fight with your own sinful nature when that quickening power comes in it makes you to to be frustrated with yourself thank you lord that's what happened to rod robertson he had a temper problem until he was arguing with his own hearse back the house because the horse would not move he came to himself he said no i can do this i'm a son of god god you got to take this temple from me if you don't take it you come at me my body right down here you got to give me the holy ghost we can't keep packing packing and just giving reason well that my family i was born like this you can keep packing that thing you can keep packing it around there must come a time where you say from that time from that time from that day never the same amen praise the lord that's the quickening power to then give he power to become sons of god some said daughter of god even them that believe on his name that's that's the reason why his name is very important in baptism you cannot take a trinity in baptism you have to believe on his name because the quickening power is attached to that praise the lord amen oh yes i believe that this morning as many as believe on his name which were born not by blood amen not by blood we cannot enter in by our natural breath line you know it's not my father it's a pastor my father being the message no no no no no this is this birth is not by blood it's not by the will of the flesh that's the reason why we have to bring the flesh on a suggestion we have to tell the flesh that you you are just a transporter you need to obey me not me obeying you you got to look at yourself in the mirror say you listen to me [Music] sometimes you gotta get serious we play too much and we make excuses we make comfort room for the devil [Music] which is now born not of blood not of the word of the flesh none of the way of men it can't come through a pastor it can come true a church association it's a birth that comes from above it's a birth that comes from above and i tell you young people when you experience that nobody can can can can make you doubt it because you will be there when it happened and you will know when it happened nobody will be witness for you you yourself will be your own witness you must be born again praise the lord hallelujah glory be to god we just want to thank our brother for that uh word this morning amen glory be to god he's he's not a long winged preacher like me i like to drag his thing and just knotted daddy man but you know all the works were done in in sex did you take one day to do all so we got to learn that amen as we go along but i think it was a wonderful word this morning musicians we can come let's just water the world with praise this morning amen as we as we just say lord be unto me now calling to your word amen be unto me i need that quickening power praise the lord i i need a change in my life amen i need an experience i need i need to step up i need something to wake me up in the morning and let me

of your body he wants to fill every fiber of your body that power can deal with battles on your mind confusion evil thoughts that power is able to take depression away that power can break habits so
