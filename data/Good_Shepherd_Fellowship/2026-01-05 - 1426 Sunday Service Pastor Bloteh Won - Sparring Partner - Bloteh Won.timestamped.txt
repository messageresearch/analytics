[11:02] praying that we can be a comfort and
[11:05] blessing to them at this time of their

[11:11] can rejoice. That's from sister Naomi.
[11:14] God bless you. Let's put our hands
[11:16] together for Jesus. We want to pray for
[11:18] brother Jo's uh family as they go
[11:21] through their period of bereiement.
[11:23] We'll call on brother Dan.
[11:26] God bless you, brother Dan, to give us
[11:27] opening prayer. And he has a testimony.
[11:32] Yeah.
[11:34] All right.
[11:43] Shall we pray?
[11:51] our Lord and our Savior Jesus. We are so
[11:54] grateful once again
[11:56] that you have gathered us by your feet,
[11:58] oh God, that we may bring our praise and
[12:02] our worship unto thee, oh God,
[12:06] knowing that in return, you are going to
[12:08] minister unto us.
[12:11] We know that we'll continue doing this
[12:15] until one day we do it no more.
[12:19] We just thank you so much
[12:23] for having ordered our steps before
[12:25] thee.
[12:28] That this path we have chosen
[12:31] is not actually our choice. You have
[12:33] chosen and ordained unto us, Lord. And
[12:36] we are so grateful that we have found
[12:38] favor in your sight to have come this
[12:40] far by grace. And we give you the glory
[12:43] this morning, Father. And we bless your
[12:46] holy name and we worship you in the name
[12:48] of Jesus, our Lord and Savior.
[12:52] Father, we commit ourselves into your
[12:54] hands as we have guided Lord
[12:56] that you'll come and be with us during
[12:58] the course of today's service. Lord,
[13:01] let our praise rise unto thee as a sweet
[13:04] smelling order, acceptable in thine
[13:07] sight. And Father, we pray, touch every
[13:11] heart in a very special way. Do not let
[13:14] us leave your presence the way we have
[13:16] come. We have just begun the year. We
[13:19] don't know the surprises that are
[13:21] waiting for us, but we are so grateful
[13:24] to know that we are not in this alone.
[13:27] Father, our lives are in your hands. Do
[13:31] with us as it pleases thee. Do not let
[13:34] our adversary, the devil, ever have his
[13:37] way.
[13:40] We want to commit sis Naomi and entire
[13:43] family into your hands. Lord
[13:47] during this time of difficulty
[13:51] father even know when we know our loved
[13:53] ones where we know our loved ones are
[13:55] going the fact that we are just parting
[13:58] company is not an easy feeling
[14:02] father we pray may you comfort them give
[14:05] them strength to cope with the passing
[14:08] away of brother Joel
[14:11] Father brother Ben is not here with us
[14:14] with his family. He called this morning
[14:16] to tell me he wasn't feeling fine and he
[14:18] wouldn't be here. We lift him before you
[14:21] and we pray that you will send your holy
[14:24] angels to go and minister strength unto
[14:26] him and entire family.
[14:29] Be with us, Father, and see us through.
[14:31] We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[14:36] God bless you saints.
[14:39] Good to see every one of you.
[14:42] Uh the year has come to an end and uh we
[14:45] have started a new one.
[14:48] Um
[14:50] I just want to take this opportunity
[14:53] to thank every one of you, every
[14:57] brother, every sister
[15:01] um for working with us.
[15:05] We know it doesn't matter how much Holy
[15:08] Ghost you have in you.
[15:11] The fact that we are in this flesh
[15:15] will always have our differences.
[15:18] We always have our opinions.
[15:22] We always have our way that would vary
[15:25] one from the other.
[15:29] We may have conflicts here and there.
[15:34] I personally do not believe
[15:37] in a church without problem. I don't
[15:39] believe that. And I don't think you do
[15:40] either.
[15:42] Praise the Lord. But what I do believe
[15:45] in though that when there is a problem,
[15:48] we should be able to solve it
[15:50] peacefully.
[15:52] That after all is said and done, we can
[15:55] put our hands around each other and say,
[15:59] "God bless you."
[16:02] So if during the course of the previous
[16:05] year there was anything we did that was
[16:08] not up to your satisfaction,
[16:10] there was anything we did that you
[16:13] thought
[16:16] was not right. If we stepped on your
[16:19] toes in one way or the other, we pray
[16:22] forgive us
[16:24] because
[16:26] once we are in the office, you have
[16:28] chosen I mean you chose us to serve you
[16:31] and we are serving you the best way we
[16:33] can but we'll make mistakes during
[16:36] during during the course of our services
[16:39] to you.
[16:41] I do reckon that we have a small place
[16:44] and sometimes you come in, you are
[16:46] comfortably seated and we have to locate
[16:49] you. It's not an easy feeling and I know
[16:52] sometimes it hasn't gone very well.
[16:54] Praise the Lord. But you are coping with
[16:57] us, coping with the situation and
[16:59] bearing with us, mothers with children
[17:01] and fathers also. In fact, you need to
[17:04] be recommended as a matter of fact
[17:06] because a lot of the time before we even
[17:10] come in, I mean, if the child is fussy
[17:13] or maybe, you know, disturbing, you get
[17:16] them out there, you know, just to create
[17:18] that atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to
[17:21] move and then be a blessing to every one
[17:23] of us. And um that uh we do we do
[17:28] commend you for that. God richly bless
[17:30] you and um the musicians
[17:34] um all the various offices in the
[17:36] church, the those in the sound room, God
[17:40] bless you richly. Uh if there is
[17:42] anything we can do better to save you
[17:46] better than we have ever done, please
[17:49] let us know. If it is not something
[17:52] against the word, we'll try to do it if
[17:56] we can. I think all of us has have a lot
[17:59] on our plates. Uh not to take too much
[18:02] of your time but just to let you know
[18:04] that we appreciate every one of you uh
[18:07] coming through the doors, those that are
[18:10] cleaning the place uh the brother and
[18:12] the sisters that are cleaning the place.
[18:14] So every time we come the place is
[18:15] clean, the toilet, the foyer, every
[18:17] place. Uh these are things we don't ever
[18:20] take for granted and we don't overlook
[18:22] those things. God richly bless you, you
[18:26] know, at his own time. Praise the Lord.
[18:30] Praise the Lord. So, um, yes, I think
[18:34] that, um, I don't want to eat too much
[18:37] of the time. I have a testimony, but I'm
[18:40] even going to compress it because we are
[18:42] running out of time.
[18:44] Yesterday was our 28th wedding
[18:47] anniversary,
[18:49] and uh, praise the Lord.
[18:54] And uh my wife and I were just talking
[18:56] one thing from the other, you know,
[18:58] recapturing the head this and uh a whole
[19:00] lot of things that has happened. And we
[19:03] just agreed
[19:06] that it is the Lord who has brought us
[19:09] this far
[19:11] &gt;&gt; and it is only God
[19:14] because the devil started fighting the
[19:16] marriage before we even came together
[19:21] during the wedding. I mean after every
[19:24] single thing you can just see the
[19:26] devil's footprints
[19:28] and we just thank the almighty God that
[19:31] we have come this far by his grace.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; I mean um I love my wife so much and
[19:37] everybody knows she is my baby girl.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord.
[19:44] Yes. But I think one part that nobody
[19:47] knows is that I am also her proud baby
[19:51] boy. Nobody knows that. Yes. I remember
[19:55] one time I took ill and I was admitted
[19:57] to the hospital at St. Louis Park and
[20:00] she would be there at the hospital till
[20:02] almost midnight. She would go home and
[20:05] early the following morning between 5:00
[20:07] and 6:00 she's at the hospital and I'll
[20:10] be lying on the bed and she comes and
[20:12] she's lying by the foot of the bed.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know what the nurses were saying
[20:17] behind the scenes but I knew they said
[20:19] something.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And in fact, it just
[20:22] tells you um how far the grace of God
[20:26] has brought us and how much uh we
[20:29] cherish her as a mom. She's a mother to
[20:31] all of us. And uh God richly bless you,
[20:35] baby girl, for not saying no the first
[20:38] day I came. I appreciate that. God bless
[20:40] you, saints.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together
[20:50] for Jesus this morning.
[20:55] All right, let's go ahead and stand as
[20:57] we um get ourselves ready for the song
[21:01] service this morning. I know we are here
[21:04] to praise our most high God. Amen. Just
[21:07] turn to somebody and say, "God bless you
[21:09] this morning." Hallelujah.
[21:26] Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together
[21:28] for Jesus this morning.

[45:18] wish you all a happy new year. It's good
[45:21] to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. We
[45:24] thank God for this wonderful blessing.
[45:27] You may have your seat for the wine.
[45:32] Praise the Lord. Amen. We thank the Lord
[45:35] for giving us a good service Wednesday
[45:39] night. We were able to hold up as long
[45:42] as we could. Sorry, I had to leave early
[45:45] because my body started shutting down
[45:48] and I felt like uh I needed to drive
[45:52] quickly and get home before I start
[45:55] sleeping at the gas station.
[45:57] Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you,
[46:00] Sister Grace. Good to see you and sister
[46:05] believe that
[46:07] your brother is in a better place and
[46:10] our prayers for the family.
[46:13] Yes. So,
[46:17] sister brother Fra will be on Tuesday.
[46:21] For those that will be able to would
[46:23] like to be part of it, you just get in
[46:26] contact with us. We'll give you the
[46:27] address and uh we try to come out and
[46:32] support the family. Praise the Lord.
[46:35] Amen. Amen. This morning, we want to try
[46:39] something. Uh we've been thinking on
[46:42] what uh we would do for for the kids in
[46:47] our our Sunday school. Uh so what we
[46:51] what we came up with and we just want to
[46:54] do uh you know uh uh in in the in the
[46:58] when you are a driver they tell you you
[47:01] have to go and do uh a drive run. The
[47:04] drive run is you have to drive and pass
[47:07] to all your all your turns all the place
[47:10] you're going to drop off and you going
[47:12] to pick up and uh so you go with an
[47:15] empty bus and you just go and do a
[47:16] drive. But this morning we will not go
[47:19] with an empty bus and uh uh we spoke to
[47:23] sister Naomi. So sorry
[47:28] we spoke to sister Na
[47:31] and asked that uh uh she would do there
[47:35] with us and and the kids back there. So
[47:39] all the little ones uh uh four five will
[47:42] go to the cry room and they will go for
[47:45] the form of introduction and different
[47:47] things. We just want to see how that
[47:50] will work. uh it's is so difficult
[47:53] sharing the building before the service
[47:56] begin and uh so what we want to do is
[48:00] that whenever we come and before the
[48:02] preacher start preaching we would
[48:04] dismiss the kids and they will go back
[48:07] there and and be able to spend 30 35
[48:11] minutes as much time as uh the teacher
[48:14] can be able to teach as much time as the
[48:16] children can be able to bear. So uh we
[48:21] thought that we would just give a try
[48:24] and see how it is. Uh if it starts to
[48:29] become too noisy, maybe we will cut the
[48:32] service shut so they can have their time
[48:35] or we will ask them to uh to keep quiet.
[48:40] Praise the Lord. But once again, we want
[48:43] to say happy new year to every one of
[48:45] you. And uh like brother Dan said, thank
[48:48] you brother Dan uh for your uh words of
[48:53] appreciation. We we thank each and every
[48:55] one of you that call this place church
[48:59] and uh and is part of this uh family at
[49:03] the corner of this street and we we
[49:05] thank you for coming bringing your
[49:08] family and uh
[49:12] Wednesday night it's Sunday morning and
[49:14] every time we ask you to come uh you
[49:18] come and and support what we are doing
[49:20] here. We are very very grateful. Very
[49:23] very grateful. We are looking forward to
[49:25] what this year will bring for us. Praise
[49:27] the Lord. We are looking forward to what
[49:29] this year will bring. But uh we know
[49:32] that the Lord is having good things in
[49:34] store for his children. Praise the Lord.
[49:37] He's having good things in store for his
[49:39] children. So, and uh uh so just like we
[49:45] said, we will have uh all the all the
[49:47] little ones uh uh from uh
[49:52] four, five years old um up to maybe
[49:56] about 10 years or nine. We'll go back
[49:59] there and be with sister Naomi as soon
[50:01] as we get into the preaching of the
[50:04] word. Sister Naomi, be with sister.
[50:08] Praise the Lord. Uh I try to keep you
[50:12] out of this thing, Sister D. I knew that
[50:15] uh you were you were busy and yet you
[50:18] keep coming up. Praise the Lord. But we
[50:20] thank the Lord. Let's stand on our feet.

[53:04] was crying because uh his mama is
[53:08] thinking special and and the other kids
[53:11] are coming up and they deny him from
[53:13] coming to sink with his mother. You

[53:28] one of the worshippers here with us.

[55:36] Philippians chapter 3.
[55:42] Philippians chapter 3.
[55:53] We'll read from verse 13. Brethrens, I
[55:56] count myself to have apprehended,
[56:00] but this one thing I do, forgetting
[56:04] those things
[56:06] which I behind,
[56:08] and reaching for
[56:11] onto those things which are before.
[56:16] I press towards the mark for the prize
[56:20] of the high calling of God in Christ
[56:23] Jesus.
[56:25] Let us therefore, as many as be perfect,
[56:30] be thus minded.
[56:33] And if in anything ye be otherwise
[56:37] mounded, God shall reveal even this unto
[56:42] you. Praise the Lord.

[59:51] So, just like I said, let let all the
[59:54] little ones uh go out uh the ones that
[59:58] fall in their age bracket, they can they
[1:00:01] can fire out and and go to meet Sister
[1:00:04] Naisha back there. And uh
[1:00:08] so you can introduce yourself to your to
[1:00:11] yourself.

[1:00:26] go introduce yourself to yourself.
[1:00:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:35] Amen.
[1:00:37] Yeah. We really been leaving the kids
[1:00:39] out and we've really been thinking what
[1:00:41] we can do. So we hope that that work
[1:00:44] when they can be able to spend just few
[1:00:47] minutes and then they will come back to
[1:00:49] their parents uh in the middle of the
[1:00:51] service.
[1:00:53] We hope we'll be able to manage it until
[1:00:56] the Lord can be able to bless us and
[1:00:58] give us uh uh the space that we need.
[1:01:02] This morning I want I want to speak on
[1:01:04] something and uh uh I want to do the
[1:01:08] best that I can to be
[1:01:10] to be a bit direct
[1:01:14] uh
[1:01:17] since I'm not always direct. I always
[1:01:19] speaking in in parables
[1:01:23] and trying to help you to figure it out.
[1:01:26] But this morning I want to I want to
[1:01:28] speak on something and I will I will
[1:01:30] read from the message context and uh
[1:01:33] that's where I I'm taking my my thought
[1:01:36] from this uh morning. So from the
[1:01:38] message context, brother Brandham I
[1:01:41] think that was uh de December 31st
[1:01:44] message. He was preaching the end of the
[1:01:46] year. Uh uh so I want to take that and
[1:01:50] and then uh start start with us this
[1:01:53] morning. Now this great context has has
[1:01:58] been going on for many years. It started
[1:02:01] in heaven and Satan was kicked out into
[1:02:05] the earth
[1:02:07] and then he became an enemy to God's
[1:02:10] people and since then he used all of his
[1:02:14] strength and his strategy to try to pull
[1:02:17] God's people across the fire or into his
[1:02:22] fire. Praise the Lord. Brother Brandon
[1:02:24] is talking about base. He's he's uh he's
[1:02:27] presenting it almost like a talk. You
[1:02:30] know, he's pulling us and we pulling and
[1:02:33] uh uh uh we're not supposed to pull on
[1:02:36] him and we're just supposed to allow him
[1:02:39] to pull and then leave the rope. Let he
[1:02:41] fall back. you know if you if you
[1:02:44] remember the game of talks now so he
[1:02:47] goes on here and he says and we know
[1:02:50] that who has the most power God does and
[1:02:55] God when he gave his people the best
[1:02:58] thing that he could do uh that that that
[1:03:03] he could to come back certain way was um
[1:03:07] his his word now because the word is God
[1:03:12] and God and and who's stronger than God?
[1:03:15] So the word is God and the word became
[1:03:20] our becomes our strength. Praise the
[1:03:23] Lord. The word becomes our strength.
[1:03:27] God in his church becomes its strength
[1:03:32] to pull Satan into his own fire
[1:03:36] that he has made.
[1:03:38] And the talk goes on.
[1:03:43] Now Jesus said in Mark 16, "In my name,
[1:03:47] they shall cast out devils." Praise the
[1:03:50] Lord.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; People don't believe in demons in this
[1:03:55] day. But the thing to do to my opinion
[1:03:59] is to know your enemy.
[1:04:04] and know your enemy and train for the
[1:04:07] context that you are going to have when
[1:04:11] you meet him. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh uh if uh uh uh I don't think
[1:04:19] anyone of anyone yet is my enemy. The
[1:04:22] devil is mine. Praise the Lord. And I
[1:04:24] think that should be the same for every
[1:04:26] one of us. uh the only enemy we have is
[1:04:29] is the devil. So uh that's what we want
[1:04:33] to look at a little bit. Brother
[1:04:34] Brandham is going to bring this subject
[1:04:36] more like a boxer that is preparing for
[1:04:39] the fight. So uh normally what they
[1:04:43] would do is that with every sport they
[1:04:46] will sit down and uh and then they will
[1:04:49] watch series of games. they will watch
[1:04:52] series of games of their opponent just
[1:04:54] to know how the guys move and all of
[1:04:56] that. I was looking at a little little
[1:04:59] uh uh uh just a kind of a short video
[1:05:02] and uh and and this this young uh uh
[1:05:06] football player, American football
[1:05:08] player took his little boy to their
[1:05:10] practice session and while the coach
[1:05:13] were talking, they were watching the
[1:05:14] game of their opponent and uh you know
[1:05:18] how they were balanced and how they were
[1:05:20] tackled and all of that and the young
[1:05:22] guy was sitting down with his pencil and
[1:05:25] he was also watching the
[1:05:27] But then he will see that uh uh the
[1:05:30] runner or the quarterback what uh
[1:05:33] whatever is his title, he will always
[1:05:36] tack his shoulder.
[1:05:38] You know, it looks like he's taking dirt
[1:05:41] from his shoulder, but he's telling his
[1:05:44] guys that he's about to run and they
[1:05:46] should send him the ball. And while they
[1:05:49] were watching the game,
[1:05:51] none of them pick it up beside the
[1:05:53] little boy.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Okay? You know, so the little boy talk
[1:05:57] in the practice which of course he
[1:05:58] shouldn't have talked because he's not
[1:06:00] part of the team. He's just there
[1:06:02] hanging out with his older brother. He
[1:06:04] says, "Uh, but he always knock his
[1:06:06] shoulder." So his brother said, "Keep
[1:06:08] quiet. Keep quiet."
[1:06:10] But the coach caught up to it and says,
[1:06:13] "What you said?" said, "Rewind the tape.
[1:06:15] If you watch every time, he knocks his
[1:06:17] shoulder."
[1:06:19] And and they rewind the tape. and uh and
[1:06:23] he found out that uh there was that was
[1:06:26] a language that he was using and it was
[1:06:29] only the little boy that caught it and
[1:06:33] everybody eyes was on him during the
[1:06:35] game. Everybody eyes was looking for
[1:06:37] that little knock you know no matter how
[1:06:40] he did it they knew that he was running
[1:06:43] and they tie him down and and and it's
[1:06:46] and it's the same thing that brother
[1:06:47] Brandham is trying to bring to us here.
[1:06:48] So let's continue to read.
[1:06:51] And uh know your enemy and train for the
[1:06:54] context that you are going to have when
[1:06:56] you meet him because you are going to
[1:06:58] meet him.
[1:07:00] Know his strength and train for this
[1:07:03] context when uh when you do meet him for
[1:07:08] in for it's one thing show you are going
[1:07:11] to meet him and so you train for the
[1:07:15] context. Now training for a context is
[1:07:19] just like a boxer. His enemy that he's
[1:07:24] going to meet out there in a context to
[1:07:27] fight a real good fighter usually know
[1:07:30] and steady his opponent. He steady his
[1:07:34] legs. You know how he throw on a cotton
[1:07:38] on on top carton what is whatever it is.
[1:07:41] No word he uh h where he fights for
[1:07:44] whether he leans forward or he hangs
[1:07:47] back or he fights right hand or left
[1:07:50] hand he study all this
[1:07:54] and then if if he's a good a smart
[1:07:58] fighter
[1:08:00] he get himself aspiring partner
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; that's the title of our message
[1:08:10] inspiring ing partner.
[1:08:13] If you are a good fighter,
[1:08:16] brother Bam said you're going to get
[1:08:18] yourself a spiring partner.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; And this spiring partner is your
[1:08:24] partner, but
[1:08:27] he's going to be the one that you will
[1:08:30] use to train. Even though he's your
[1:08:33] sparring partner, but he's going to he's
[1:08:36] going to behave like your opponent.
[1:08:39] So, he's not going to be the guy that
[1:08:41] would just pat you on the back. Uh uh I
[1:08:44] mean, he's going to wear his gloves and
[1:08:47] uh and his knocks are going to be real,
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Even though he's your partner,
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; but he's going to hit you so real.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And know I I put a little bit of uh uh 6
[1:09:01] seconds smith, brother Brandham talk
[1:09:03] about his trainer, 6 seconds smith. He
[1:09:06] asked the guy and he says, "Why are you
[1:09:08] hitting me like that?" He says, "Because
[1:09:11] uh you know, I'm training you so you can
[1:09:13] be able to to know what what a blow
[1:09:16] feels like."
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "This guy will hit him and he
[1:09:19] will go over the rink and fall on the
[1:09:21] other side." He's supposed to be
[1:09:23] training him, but that is the way he
[1:09:25] wanted to train him. He said, "So your
[1:09:27] body can get used to the shock of a
[1:09:31] knock. when the when the opponent knock
[1:09:33] you, your body will get used to it. But
[1:09:36] if if I'm just jumping around with you,
[1:09:38] you know, uh so uh that's what we want
[1:09:41] to talk about. And like I said, I want
[1:09:43] to I want to just be a little bit frank
[1:09:45] with you that I'm needing aspiring
[1:09:47] partner.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; I'm needing aspiring partner. And I
[1:09:54] think we all need aspiring partner.
[1:09:56] Praise the Lord. If we going to stay in
[1:09:58] this this fight, we need a sparring
[1:10:00] partner. And I believe that the Holy
[1:10:03] Ghost is has been our spiring partner
[1:10:05] all of these years. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he condemn us when we are
[1:10:09] wrong. I don't believe that he
[1:10:11] compromised on his word. No, he do not
[1:10:14] compromise on his word. He's going to
[1:10:16] call you out. You know, he's going to
[1:10:19] beat your conscience. is going to uh uh
[1:10:22] uh uh uh send uh some uh some sense of
[1:10:26] uh uh uh um uh guilty feeling. Uh he
[1:10:32] tried to get your attention and then if
[1:10:34] you are not listening sometimes uh you
[1:10:36] know uh maybe he allow you to get sick
[1:10:38] and uh he's he's doing all of this just
[1:10:41] to be able to get your attention that
[1:10:43] look you you need to focus. This is a
[1:10:45] real life thing. Amen. We are in a real
[1:10:48] life uh uh fight here with with a devil
[1:10:51] that does not want any good from us. So
[1:10:54] this morning we want to talk about
[1:10:57] aspiring partner. Let me get back there
[1:11:00] and and continue my reading. And then if
[1:11:02] he's a good a smart fighter, he get
[1:11:06] himself a sparring partner that will
[1:11:09] fight just like his opponent's fight for
[1:11:13] he will know all the legs when he gets
[1:11:17] to that place. And I think that is a
[1:11:20] very good thing for Christians
[1:11:24] to do. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is a good thing for
[1:11:29] Christians to do. But that is that is
[1:11:32] not uh you know the most thing that we
[1:11:34] do. We always try to find you know the
[1:11:37] partner or somebody you know that we can
[1:11:40] we can have uh uh uh some form of mutual
[1:11:44] agreement where we we turn to be nice to
[1:11:46] one another. The moment we start
[1:11:48] criticizing one another then the
[1:11:50] friendship you know breaks apart. Praise
[1:11:52] the Lord. Amen. And uh but uh we we we
[1:11:58] are learning here this morning that we
[1:12:00] need aspiring partner and uh that we
[1:12:03] fight just like our opponents will fight
[1:12:06] and uh uh and and that's a very good
[1:12:09] thing for Christians to do. That's
[1:12:13] right. And now if you want to start
[1:12:16] training, start with John 3:16. Amen.
[1:12:21] John 3:16. For God so loved the world.
[1:12:23] So you start with love. Amen. You have
[1:12:26] to know that you and this person you're
[1:12:27] a partner. The person is not your enemy.
[1:12:30] So you have to love them. Praise the
[1:12:32] Lord. Amen. And then he says the next
[1:12:36] thing there you start with the golden
[1:12:37] rule. What is the golden rule? Do unto
[1:12:40] others
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; as you want them to do unto you. Praise
[1:12:45] the Lord.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; So as you're at training, you know, do
[1:12:49] unto him as you want him to do unto you.
[1:12:51] So I mean uh if you just pat one another
[1:12:54] on the back, you're going to yell
[1:12:56] because uh y'all will not know what a
[1:12:58] real blow is. Amen. Yeah. So you give
[1:13:01] him give him a good hit and uh uh when
[1:13:04] he wake up, he will do the same unto
[1:13:06] you. When he do it to you, don't cry.
[1:13:08] Amen. Because that's your partner. You
[1:13:11] are training for the fight. So uh uh the
[1:13:13] first thing to start with is uh John
[1:13:16] 3:16, love in our hearts.
[1:13:19] And then the golden rule, start right
[1:13:22] out with that and that will get you on
[1:13:24] the floor. Praise the Lord. And then
[1:13:27] train for the knockout punches because
[1:13:30] you are going to have to use them.
[1:13:32] Everybody knows that. Amen. You have to
[1:13:36] train to hit your enemy. And always God
[1:13:41] use his word. We re we must remember. We
[1:13:45] must remember that God use his word to
[1:13:49] defeat his enemy. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; He used his word to defeat his enemy. So
[1:13:56] when you when when we look at this
[1:13:58] subject that we want to look at, we
[1:14:00] realize that uh uh as we have said over
[1:14:04] and over, God plan of redemption has has
[1:14:08] has been a long plan before the
[1:14:10] foundation of the world. He had this
[1:14:12] plan of redemption. But in the plan of
[1:14:15] redemption, the reason why God made us
[1:14:18] because he needed spiring partners.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; He couldn't do it on his own.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; He needed us to be his partners.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; He need spiring partners. That's the
[1:14:32] reason why Moses could say to God,
[1:14:35] brother Brandon will say here in the
[1:14:37] message, look away to Jesus. There was
[1:14:39] another one that puzzled me. That that
[1:14:43] was when Moses could tell God a better
[1:14:45] way
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; then God knows how to do anything. When
[1:14:50] Moses said the people will say your God,
[1:14:53] you see Moses Moses correction to God
[1:14:56] was not the people will say I'm not
[1:14:58] strong. He was not talking about
[1:15:00] himself. Amen. He was trying to uphold
[1:15:03] the repetition of his partner.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you kill us in the
[1:15:08] wilderness, all of these nations around
[1:15:10] will say you you are I mean what kind of
[1:15:12] a god is this? You are not able to keep
[1:15:15] the people. That's why you killed him.
[1:15:17] So you see the spiring partner is always
[1:15:20] looking after the the the interest of
[1:15:23] the other one.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; He want the other one to be better.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So uh so this whole
[1:15:33] plan of redemption as we are going to
[1:15:35] look into uh this morning uh uh uh is a
[1:15:40] plan that God have. But it's a plan in
[1:15:44] in his plan he also planned to have
[1:15:46] partners. He also planned to have
[1:15:49] sparring partners. That's the reason why
[1:15:51] when he made man, he made man in his
[1:15:55] image because he want his partner to be
[1:15:58] as good as he was.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to talk on partnership
[1:16:05] this uh this morning
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; because that's what I think we need to
[1:16:10] run this church.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; We need partnership.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:18] And uh uh I think that's what we need to
[1:16:21] be able to run our homes. That's what we
[1:16:24] need to be able to to become successful.
[1:16:26] We need partnership. Praise the Lord. No
[1:16:29] man is an island. Praise the Lord. I
[1:16:32] need you as much as you need me. Praise
[1:16:35] the Lord. Or maybe even more than you
[1:16:38] need me.
[1:16:40] And uh uh uh so that's what we're going
[1:16:42] to look at uh for the few minutes that
[1:16:45] is before us. We want to look at
[1:16:48] partnership.
[1:16:49] Praise the Lord. We want to look at
[1:16:51] partnership and we will we will if we
[1:16:55] are not able as uh to finish as usual we
[1:16:58] might take a series on it. Then you know
[1:17:00] there's the rest of 2026. Amen. Praise
[1:17:03] the Lord. Because when I start I don't
[1:17:05] finish so easily unless uh we have uh
[1:17:08] visitors then they they take me out of
[1:17:11] my stories. Now so uh we want to talk
[1:17:14] about sparring partners. We want to talk
[1:17:17] about spiring partners and and brother
[1:17:19] Bam go on here and he talks you know on
[1:17:22] and on and on but but that's that's
[1:17:25] where that's where the thought is that's
[1:17:27] what we want to look at this morning. We
[1:17:30] want to look at sparring partners.
[1:17:35] And uh when God expressed himself in
[1:17:38] making man, he made man male and female.
[1:17:43] Eve was Adam helpmate. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:48] Uh uh she was a uh he was a helpmate.
[1:17:54] He was a helpmate to uh to Adam.
[1:17:58] And uh so being a helpmate uh she was a
[1:18:01] partner. She was a partner and and I
[1:18:05] think also she was aspiring partner.
[1:18:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; I thought the little one was coming to
[1:18:11] be my partner to preach this morning.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I was saying we didn't
[1:18:19] drink together. I don't know
[1:18:21] how it's going to be.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:18:28] Oh man,
[1:18:33] it's so
[1:18:36] so wonderful this morning.
[1:18:39] Now, so she was uh she was a helpmate
[1:18:42] and and I think that word we have play
[1:18:46] with it. help me. Help me. And uh we
[1:18:48] have you know we have played with it in
[1:18:51] uh uh you know in in so many different
[1:18:55] ways that sometimes
[1:18:58] uh we
[1:18:59] we we lost the sense of what really it
[1:19:03] means. And uh uh and I've been looking
[1:19:07] I've been looking into something that I
[1:19:09] tried to bring out in one of the
[1:19:11] services but I didn't do a good job. And
[1:19:14] I kept studying on the subject and I
[1:19:16] would like to go into it a little bit
[1:19:18] this morning hoping that uh uh maybe
[1:19:21] this time the Lord will be able to help
[1:19:23] us so we can be able to look at that
[1:19:26] because when God made man, he made man
[1:19:30] uh uh uh in his image, male and female.
[1:19:34] Praise the Lord. Amen. And uh uh as as
[1:19:39] believers, message believers, we are
[1:19:41] very uh uh used to that statement of
[1:19:45] brother Brandon. The woman was not in
[1:19:47] the original creation of God. She was
[1:19:50] not in the original manifestation of the
[1:19:53] creation. But she was in the original
[1:19:55] creation because he made man male and
[1:19:59] female. Praise the Lord. But when he was
[1:20:02] expressing that uh that uh uh image that
[1:20:06] he made, she was not there. She was in
[1:20:09] man in Genesis 2 uh 7.
[1:20:13] So uh uh um
[1:20:20] but if you look all through the ages you
[1:20:22] will see that God have always whenever
[1:20:24] he raise up a man he always have someone
[1:20:27] there as as a sparring partner. Praise
[1:20:31] the Lord. He always have somebody there
[1:20:34] as a sparring partner. Uh uh
[1:20:39] praise the Lord. He had uh he had an
[1:20:41] Enoch just after Eden. He raised a man
[1:20:46] up there that that could walk with God.
[1:20:48] He had a sparring partner, Noah, because
[1:20:51] Noah was watching Enoch. And uh when
[1:20:54] Enoch leave, he knew that the flood was
[1:20:56] going to come. So Noah and Enoch were
[1:20:59] pretty much in the same dis
[1:21:01] dispensation. If you want to look at it
[1:21:03] like that, uh uh uh and Abraham had a
[1:21:08] spiring partner which was Eleazar.
[1:21:11] And at one time he called his partner.
[1:21:13] He says, "Buddy, I want you to go and
[1:21:16] get a wife for my son." And uh uh he was
[1:21:19] a boy that grew up right in in Abraham
[1:21:22] house. But he turned out to be a spiring
[1:21:25] partner because uh uh he was able to
[1:21:28] carry out exactly what Abraham needed.
[1:21:32] Moses had aspiring partner that was his
[1:21:34] older brother Aaron. Aaron was his
[1:21:36] mouthpiece. Praise the Lord. Aaron was
[1:21:40] his mouthpiece and Joshua had a sparring
[1:21:44] partner and that was Caleb.
[1:21:47] Now, so in in the Pagamos church,
[1:21:50] Abraham will say something like this
[1:21:52] about Joshua and Kaleb. He says, "Now
[1:21:54] let's let let uh let let us stand like
[1:21:59] Joshua and Caleb. Our promised land is
[1:22:02] coming in sight even as the date did."
[1:22:06] Now Joshua means Jehovah savior
[1:22:10] and he represented the end time leader
[1:22:13] that will come to the church even as
[1:22:16] Paul came as the original leader. Praise
[1:22:21] the Lord. Amen. Who is that end time
[1:22:23] leader? The Holy Ghost.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the end time leader.
[1:22:29] Praise the Lord. The prophet brought us
[1:22:31] as much as Moses brought the people and
[1:22:34] he pointed to the promised land. Amen.
[1:22:36] That just how the uh the the the prophet
[1:22:39] brought us. He pointed us to the
[1:22:41] promise. He pointed us to the ter. He
[1:22:43] promised us to the manifestation of God
[1:22:46] and he told us go and take the land.
[1:22:48] Take the book and eat it.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So uh the the Holy
[1:22:53] Ghost is our end time leader. Caleb
[1:22:56] represent those that stay uh uh truth
[1:23:00] with Joshua. Praise the Lord. Amen. So
[1:23:04] there was a Caleb and Joshua and both of
[1:23:07] them were aspiring partners. Praise the
[1:23:09] Lord. It came a time where Joshua came
[1:23:12] to uh Caleb came to Joshua and says,
[1:23:15] "Put it give me my mountain." Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If there is any other
[1:23:20] thing that I need to do to get that
[1:23:21] mountain, it was given to me. I need it.
[1:23:24] Praise the Lord. And the Bible say his
[1:23:26] strength was just like the strength of a
[1:23:29] young man. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:32] Hallelujah.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm trying to gather my strength
[1:23:36] this morning and uh uh woke up around
[1:23:40] 4:00 a.m. this morning and I was I was I
[1:23:43] was I was trying to think where was I.
[1:23:46] Amen.
[1:23:47] I was thinking where was I? Amen.
[1:23:52] But uh thank you for your prayers. I'm
[1:23:54] feeling much better this morning
[1:23:56] and uh just just uh
[1:24:01] believing that God will will help us to
[1:24:03] get through this. So
[1:24:06] like we said in his plan of redemption
[1:24:09] uh uh God
[1:24:12] plan uh uh to have man as a as a
[1:24:16] sparring partner. He planned to have men
[1:24:19] as a spiring partner in the message of
[1:24:21] the unconditional covenant that God made
[1:24:24] with the people.
[1:24:27] He said, "Now, if you will notice what
[1:24:30] caused this great thing in the
[1:24:32] beginning,
[1:24:36] God took man for a partner." Praise the
[1:24:40] Lord. God took man. That word, let us
[1:24:43] made man in our image. God was making a
[1:24:48] partner.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; He was making a partner. God believe in
[1:24:55] partnership.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; The work of redemption is a work of
[1:25:00] partnership. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He paid the price on the cross of
[1:25:04] Calvary. Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; He sent his spirit back to the church.
[1:25:10] Praise the Lord. And that's why brother
[1:25:13] Brandon would tell us lot of time we are
[1:25:15] waiting on God when God is waiting on us
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; because in partnership I mean the work
[1:25:22] the work must be distributed equally.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; We must also learn the abilities of one
[1:25:29] another. Hallelujah.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; We must learn the abilities of one
[1:25:34] another. You know why we believe uh in
[1:25:36] his ability there is nothing that he
[1:25:39] cannot do. But also in his word he told
[1:25:41] us that uh uh all things are possible to
[1:25:44] them that believe.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; So he's showing us our you know uh our
[1:25:49] abilities and and and as as we also are
[1:25:53] discovering his ability in the word. So
[1:25:56] uh he took man for a partner and he made
[1:26:00] a covenant with man equal and told and
[1:26:03] told a man if thou shall do this and not
[1:26:07] do this then the man broke his covenant
[1:26:10] and he always breaks his covenant.
[1:26:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] But you see in partnership is not just
[1:26:19] like you know you hire for the job and
[1:26:21] and you do something wrong and they say
[1:26:23] you are fired. No, I mean if you uh if
[1:26:26] you uh if you are not meeting up, we
[1:26:29] have to have a conference. Amen. Let's
[1:26:32] sit down. Let's review the values of uh
[1:26:35] of uh of our team. You know, let's talk
[1:26:37] about it. You know, how how we can help
[1:26:40] you to become better.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Those are the things
[1:26:44] that are in partnership.
[1:26:46] Amen. A man always breaks his he always
[1:26:49] break his covenant. A man just can't
[1:26:52] keep his promise. That's all. There's
[1:26:54] only one can keep his promise. That's
[1:26:57] God. Man cannot. He break his covenant
[1:27:01] every time with God. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God we have we have a
[1:27:09] partner that is not giving up on us.
[1:27:12] Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; We have a partner that is not giving up
[1:27:15] on us. He he want us to be better.
[1:27:18] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; He want us to be better. Whenever we
[1:27:21] fail, we can come back to him and says,
[1:27:23] "Well, I thought I got it, but this time
[1:27:25] I didn't get it, you know, and then he
[1:27:27] can be able to set us down and and take
[1:27:30] us through everything." And that is the
[1:27:32] beautiful thing about partnership.
[1:27:34] Praise the Lord. Yeah. So, let's just
[1:27:37] get right into it this morning. We're
[1:27:38] going to go right back again from the
[1:27:40] beginning. And this is what I this is
[1:27:42] what I like I said, I tried to bring to
[1:27:45] you and I and I I didn't get it right.
[1:27:48] And I want to try it again hoping that
[1:27:50] the Lord will be able to help us. Now,
[1:27:52] so when God express himself and wanting
[1:27:55] to make make man in his image, the Bible
[1:27:58] says uh Genesis 1 26:27, those were
[1:28:02] spirit men that God made male and
[1:28:05] female.
[1:28:06] And uh and in Genesis 2:7, that was
[1:28:10] where he made men out of the dust of the
[1:28:12] earth. Praise the Lord. But now this man
[1:28:15] that was made in Genesis 2:7, which of
[1:28:18] course was the man that was embodying
[1:28:22] what God made in Genesis 2:26
[1:28:25] because what was made in 126 was just a
[1:28:28] spirit being. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; And 27 was the was the was the physical
[1:28:33] body was the flesh that was made in 27.
[1:28:36] So uh uh then in 27 we realized that man
[1:28:41] was now uh he had uh uh uh both
[1:28:46] masculine and feminine spirit right in
[1:28:49] that same body. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And and and and this is where I wanted
[1:28:54] to get to. If you if you look through
[1:28:56] the scripture, you will read that the
[1:28:59] Bible says it was God that said it was
[1:29:02] not good for the man to be alone.
[1:29:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It was not Adam that came to God and
[1:29:11] say, "God, I'm tired of being alone."
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now that's that's where I that's
[1:29:20] that's the thought I want you to grab
[1:29:23] because that thought is very very very
[1:29:25] very important. It was God that said it
[1:29:29] was not good for man to be alone. I will
[1:29:32] make him a helpmate.
[1:29:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that principle runs through
[1:29:40] the Bible.
[1:29:42] It was not Isaac that came to uh Abraham
[1:29:46] and says, "Father, I need a wife."
[1:29:50] Even though he needed a wife,
[1:29:53] but it was Abraham calling Eleazar
[1:29:57] and telling Eleazar, "Go and find a
[1:30:01] bride for my son."
[1:30:04] You also look in Jesus parable, you will
[1:30:07] see that Jesus every time he talks about
[1:30:10] the parable of the wedding supper, it
[1:30:13] was the father
[1:30:15] inviting people to the wedding of his
[1:30:19] son. It was never the son calling for a
[1:30:23] wedding.
[1:30:25] It was never the son is is the the
[1:30:28] thought is very very is very very
[1:30:31] strong. The thought is very deep.
[1:30:35] But we we we try to we work around it a
[1:30:38] little bit this morning. There's a
[1:30:39] reason why. There is a reason why.
[1:30:43] Because when God made man, he made man,
[1:30:47] male and female created he them in his
[1:30:51] image.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; So the woman was not in the image of the
[1:30:58] man. The woman was in the image of God
[1:31:01] as much as the man was in the image of
[1:31:04] God.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; That's that is the thought that I want
[1:31:14] for us to get right from the beginning.
[1:31:16] You know, there's there's a whole lot of
[1:31:18] a thing in the scripture when when when
[1:31:21] you read the scripture, you see brother
[1:31:22] Brandon talking there in the invisible
[1:31:25] union. He says lot of time when we read
[1:31:27] Romans chapter 7 he says we tie it to
[1:31:30] our marriage condition. He said but Paul
[1:31:32] was not talking about our physical
[1:31:34] marriage condition. He was he was
[1:31:36] prophesying to the church.
[1:31:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; So it it was it was it was more of a
[1:31:46] prophecy and and lesser of our marriage
[1:31:49] condition. We can use it to be able to
[1:31:52] judge our home affairs and judge our
[1:31:55] marriage affairs in church. But
[1:31:59] there is more a prophecy
[1:32:02] than to our our physical union.
[1:32:06] Why? Because people in their physical
[1:32:09] union will disregard what Paul says in
[1:32:12] Romans CHAPTER 7. BUT GOD IN HIS
[1:32:15] internal purpose will never disregard it
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; because it's his word. He's going to
[1:32:21] bring his church out because that is the
[1:32:23] way he thought about it.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; So you see this word that GOD GAVE TO
[1:32:31] US, IT IS NOT ONLY something for us to
[1:32:34] keep. GOD IS MORE DEVOTED to his word.
[1:32:38] HE'S MORE DEDICATED, MORE COMMITTED TO
[1:32:41] HIS word than we can.
[1:32:44] because it is his word.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; He's having more stake in it than you
[1:32:50] and myself.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Because he said in his word that his
[1:32:56] word will never return back to him.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S NOT JUST RELYING ON US BECAUSE
[1:33:03] HE KNOWS WITH OUR ABILITY WE CAN FAIL.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; So he's more COMMITTED THAT HIS WORD
[1:33:11] WILL NEVER FAIL. AMEN.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; So he having more stake in it than we
[1:33:20] can. Hallelujah.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; We're talking aspiring partners.
[1:33:29] So we see here that uh God when he made
[1:33:33] this man and and uh and and then he he
[1:33:37] he had this thought and said it's not
[1:33:39] good for man to be alone. The Bible says
[1:33:42] he put the man to a deep sleep and then
[1:33:45] he he he brought out that uh uh uh
[1:33:48] feminine u
[1:33:51] uh nature out of the man and and he
[1:33:54] created a woman. Praise the Lord.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Adam recovered from his anesthesia.
[1:34:04] Praise the Lord. And he says, "This is
[1:34:07] flesh of my flesh and bones of my
[1:34:09] bones." and uh and I would call her
[1:34:12] woman.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; But whenever God called them, he called
[1:34:18] them Adam.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Adam called her woman, but God called
[1:34:23] them Adam.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Now, so, so this is the thought. This is
[1:34:30] the thought because this thought
[1:34:31] actually came out of uh uh uh spoken
[1:34:35] word is the original say when you when
[1:34:38] you when you study beard you will see
[1:34:40] that uh uh uh brother Brandon makes some
[1:34:43] very hard very very hard statement very
[1:34:46] tough statement and uh uh and and and
[1:34:49] one of the statement that he made that
[1:34:51] produced this thought that uh if Eve
[1:34:55] wouldn't have listened to the devil life
[1:34:57] she would have brought God, she will
[1:35:00] have had the virgin birth. Let me say it
[1:35:03] that way.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; She will have had the virgin birth. Now,
[1:35:09] the virgin birth, there was no man that
[1:35:12] was involved.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Now, so you can see that God had a
[1:35:21] purpose for the woman. He had a purpose
[1:35:24] for the woman because even when she
[1:35:26] fell, EVEN WHEN HE FELL, WHAT DID GOD
[1:35:30] DO? HE COME BACK IN Genesis chapter 3
[1:35:34] and he said the seed of the woman will
[1:35:37] bruise the head of the serpent. SO WHICH
[1:35:39] MEAN THE THOUGHT OF THE VIRGIN BIRTH,
[1:35:42] THE THOUGHT OF GOD PRODUCING himself
[1:35:45] through THE WOMAN, GOD NEVER CAME, that
[1:35:48] was not an afterthought.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That was not a second thought.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WAS GOD'S PURPOSE RIGHT FROM
[1:35:57] THE BEGINNING.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE HAD INTEREST in
[1:36:03] creating a man and creating A WOMAN
[1:36:05] BECAUSE RIGHT HERE HE HAVING THIS BIG
[1:36:08] plan of redemption and he's UH HE'S
[1:36:12] LAYING OUT A PLAN THAT THIS GOD IS GOING
[1:36:14] TO DO AND A PLAN THAT THIS GU is going
[1:36:17] TO DO. WE ALL have a work to do.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT WAS EVE? EVE AS A HELPMATE, WHAT
[1:36:25] WAS HER JOB TO DO? What was her work?
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; They were not wearing clothes. So there
[1:36:31] was no dirt clothes to watch.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; They were not hungry. They were eating
[1:36:39] from the from the from the the fruits
[1:36:41] and the plants and everything they were
[1:36:43] eating. So I mean there was no stove and
[1:36:46] utensil for her to cook.
[1:36:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; So what was her work as an helpmate? SHE
[1:36:56] WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP Adam in expressing
[1:37:00] God.
[1:37:02] THERE WAS A PART THAT ADAM COULD NOT DO
[1:37:06] BECAUSE THE FALL COULD NOT COME THROUGH
[1:37:08] ADAM. ADAM COULD NEVER REVE GOD AS A
[1:37:11] HEALER. HE COULD NEVER REVE GOD AS A
[1:37:14] DELIVERER. HE COULD NEVER REVE GOD AS A
[1:37:17] SAVIOR. THE WOMAN WAS DESIGNED TO DO
[1:37:20] THAT. WHY? BECAUSE THROUGH HER THE fall
[1:37:23] will come.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; I I spoke a little bit on this back
[1:37:40] there in South Africa and I kind of make
[1:37:42] a disclaimer that I was not preaching a
[1:37:45] new doctrine to cause problem in people
[1:37:47] home. Amen.
[1:37:49] And that's uh and that's not what I'm
[1:37:51] doing here either. My responsibility is
[1:37:53] to is to preach the word. Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Is to make us to be able to see things
[1:37:59] in the word.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Make us to be able to see things in the
[1:38:04] word. You know when a person grab their
[1:38:07] position in the word and they know that
[1:38:11] uh God has called them for the purpose.
[1:38:13] There are many men that have left their
[1:38:15] wives and their wives stay serving God.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; There are many women that have left
[1:38:20] their husband and their husbands stay
[1:38:22] serving God. If it was just in a place
[1:38:25] that uh you know our marriage vow is to
[1:38:29] is is is to influence us in a way where
[1:38:32] when I stopped coming to church and then
[1:38:34] my wife stopped coming to church then
[1:38:36] you see that is the reason why God when
[1:38:40] when when he when he express himself
[1:38:43] that way he he broke the responsibility.
[1:38:50] Praise the Lord. He broke the
[1:38:52] responsibility.
[1:38:54] That's the reason why he did it
[1:38:58] because uh the man by his nature, God
[1:39:01] was going to find a way to express
[1:39:04] himself through the man. The woman BY
[1:39:06] HER NATURE, GOD WAS GOING TO EXPRESS. HE
[1:39:09] WAS NOT going to use the man to express
[1:39:11] himself through the woman. No, he was
[1:39:14] going to express himself through the
[1:39:17] woman
[1:39:18] by himself.
[1:39:22] Are we together?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; That is the reason why it is not Adam
[1:39:28] finding the bride. It's not Isaac
[1:39:30] finding the bride, but it's God
[1:39:33] bringing A HELPMATE.
[1:39:35] GOD BRINGING A PARTNER.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; He's bringing a partner because there is
[1:39:42] a bigger picture. There's a bigger plan.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because many times and most of the
[1:39:48] time our our marriage plans begin
[1:39:52] selfish. We all
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; they start selfish.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we we we turn to become
[1:40:01] much of ourself.
[1:40:03] We say marriage is the institute of God.
[1:40:05] We leave God. We we we we catch up with
[1:40:08] God later.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; We catch up with God later. And then uh
[1:40:15] uh uh it's it's all about our self you
[1:40:17] know we we we want this person to give
[1:40:19] us the taste that we want. We want this
[1:40:21] person to give us the look that we want.
[1:40:23] We we be we make it too much and it's
[1:40:26] natural. I'm not saying there's nothing
[1:40:28] wrong with that. It's it's nature.
[1:40:30] That's what our human nature gave us.
[1:40:33] Our human nature gave us selfishness.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a good selfishness and
[1:40:42] there is a destructive selfishness.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Where did I took that from?
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's a good
[1:40:56] selfishness. Take care. Brush your
[1:40:58] teeth. That's a good selfishness. Brush
[1:41:01] your teeth. That's your own teeth. Clean
[1:41:03] it, please. For it's not falling off.
[1:41:07] Amen.
[1:41:09] Is that not a good selfishness?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Oh man. Thank you people for bearing
[1:41:23] with me. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:26] Glory be to God.
[1:41:35] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:41:38] Hallelujah.
[1:41:44] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; You know, while I was there in in in
[1:41:52] South Africa, I I had that my image I've
[1:41:54] been using here paramed image. So I I
[1:41:58] decided to use one day because I
[1:42:00] realized that uh my friend he was not
[1:42:02] backing there and he was not finding
[1:42:04] another preacher. He's going to use me
[1:42:05] for all of the service. So I said okay I
[1:42:09] think
[1:42:12] I'm going to create a relaxing way to
[1:42:14] preach. So I told him I says get me a
[1:42:17] pointer.
[1:42:19] He says okay. So he went down to one
[1:42:21] Chinese shop and bought one.
[1:42:24] I said, "I'm there something I want to I
[1:42:27] want to I want to teach this morning."
[1:42:29] So, I came and then uh I make a
[1:42:31] disclaimer to the church and I say, "I'm
[1:42:33] not a teacher, but I just want to try
[1:42:36] something. There's something I've been
[1:42:37] doing in church and uh uh uh
[1:42:43] and to me it's been helpful for the
[1:42:45] church. So, I just want to try this
[1:42:47] morning."
[1:42:48] So uh I use uh I used the both services
[1:42:52] morning and evening to be able to do
[1:42:54] that. So I mean I would just relax
[1:42:57] myself and then the next day I can I can
[1:42:59] continue preaching. So then the next
[1:43:01] morning
[1:43:03] this sister came to me one of the
[1:43:05] brothers preacher's wife and and she
[1:43:07] says oh bless you brother one I said God
[1:43:09] bless you. She says uh you know
[1:43:11] yesterday you were you make a disclaimer
[1:43:13] that you are not a teacher but I think I
[1:43:16] have seen a teacher.
[1:43:19] Praise the Lord. She said I think I have
[1:43:21] seen a teacher. I said no sister I'm not
[1:43:23] a teacher. She said yeah for you you are
[1:43:25] not a teacher but me I have seen the
[1:43:26] teacher.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So in my head I'm
[1:43:29] saying if you know how many times I went
[1:43:31] over this thing with my church to be
[1:43:36] to be able to know how to present it,
[1:43:38] you would not call me a teacher.
[1:43:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And uh we just thank the Lord. Amen.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you for bearing with me and uh
[1:43:48] praying for me and all of that. But
[1:43:50] let's get back to our subject because uh
[1:43:52] it's uh it's very important. Amen. Many
[1:43:55] men try to stand and and you know you
[1:43:58] hear brother Brandham using this
[1:43:59] statement which of course people take
[1:44:02] out of context and uh uh people take out
[1:44:07] of context and um
[1:44:11] oh praise the Lord.
[1:44:14] Amen.
[1:44:17] proof of his resurrection. He says uh
[1:44:20] and if we can and and and and if we had
[1:44:23] to stand it alone stand it
[1:44:27] for is God's word,
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; every man that ever get anywhere
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; had to stand alone on his conviction on
[1:44:38] it.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Not standing alone but standing alone on
[1:44:43] his conviction.
[1:44:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And that conviction can only survive if
[1:44:52] it is based on the word of God.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; If you have a conviction, you say that's
[1:44:57] your conviction. Good for you. If it is
[1:44:59] not the word of God, it's just a matter
[1:45:01] of time. It's going to crash.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; It's going to fall apart.
[1:45:07] Or but you hear people say, you know,
[1:45:09] brother Bam says, every man I ever did
[1:45:11] anything for God have to stand alone. So
[1:45:13] I'm standing alone. You can't be alone.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; You know what the world would be if you
[1:45:18] were just the only person living on
[1:45:19] earth?
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; You will run all the time from your
[1:45:25] shadow.
[1:45:28] So it's not it's not just producing uh
[1:45:33] uh uh ind uh uh uh uh uh some form of
[1:45:36] independence where we can just be alone
[1:45:39] you know stay by ourself and you know uh
[1:45:42] h uh run our own thing you know in uh in
[1:45:45] uh in in our home and or whatever it is.
[1:45:48] No that's that's not that's not the
[1:45:50] thought. That's not the thought. But a
[1:45:53] person having a conviction and believing
[1:45:55] and saying, "I know that God is a
[1:45:57] healer. I know that God is a deliverer."
[1:46:00] Amen. I know that God is is God is God.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to hold to his word.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, it's a man that that is
[1:46:11] taking God's word as a conviction. No
[1:46:14] matter what people are saying, he
[1:46:16] believed that God can heal the sick. He
[1:46:18] believed that God can raise the dead.
[1:46:21] Amen.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; If I prayed for 10 and it died, he says,
[1:46:25] "I will be praying tomorrow. I'll be
[1:46:27] back on the field because I believe that
[1:46:28] God is a healer."
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; So that's that is the place where he's
[1:46:38] asking us to stand alone is on our
[1:46:41] conviction. A conviction that is based
[1:46:43] upon the word of God. But in everything
[1:46:45] you look really, you will realize that
[1:46:47] uh you know we need partners. And I
[1:46:50] think that's the reason why he gave us
[1:46:52] two hands. Amen. Because one hand will
[1:46:55] be able to wash this one good, but this
[1:46:57] one cannot do nothing for this one
[1:46:58] perfectly.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this one is a partner to this
[1:47:02] one.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So so a lot of things when you
[1:47:05] look at it, God really, you know,
[1:47:08] constructed the word and and his plan
[1:47:10] for mankind was to be able to set up in
[1:47:13] a place of partnership.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. For here, this man and this woman,
[1:47:19] you know, uh uh uh they year and and and
[1:47:21] and and their work was to express God.
[1:47:26] Now, look at Adam. That's the reason why
[1:47:28] he brought Eve later. Look at Adam. His
[1:47:31] job was to give all the animals their
[1:47:33] name.
[1:47:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; He named the animals and named the fruit
[1:47:38] trees and give names and give names and
[1:47:40] give names. That was his job as an
[1:47:43] amateur god. But when it was time for
[1:47:47] God to move to the next page in the plan
[1:47:49] of redemption, the next page because God
[1:47:53] was anxious to be able to reveal himself
[1:47:56] and reveal his nature and reveal his
[1:47:59] ability. It was not in Adam to do it.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; It was not in Adam. Adam could not bring
[1:48:08] that part of God out. He could not bring
[1:48:11] that part of a savior out.
[1:48:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; It was in the woman. It was in Eve. So
[1:48:19] when he brought Eve on the scene,
[1:48:21] because she was designed in that way,
[1:48:24] she was able to get over there and have
[1:48:26] a conversation with the devil, open her
[1:48:29] reasoning and and the four came. Now God
[1:48:31] found an avenue where he will be able to
[1:48:34] manifest and display the rest of his
[1:48:36] attributes.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:44] So if you look if you look in the deep
[1:48:46] sense, I mean we can we can uh uh we can
[1:48:50] take uh we can take uh uh uh uh in any
[1:48:54] way that we want to take it for our
[1:48:56] home, you know, uh uh in the way we run
[1:48:59] our family. And uh uh but if you take it
[1:49:02] in a deep sense, God was more interested
[1:49:08] in Eve helping Adam
[1:49:12] to express the rest of
[1:49:16] his attributes.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; He was more interested in that.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:26] God, I believe that he's more interested
[1:49:29] in uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, me and
[1:49:32] my wife. Uh, uh, I I think he's more
[1:49:35] interested in us in us uh, uh, uh, uh,
[1:49:39] revealing him the best way that we can
[1:49:42] in this age.
[1:49:45] Praise the Lord. Then we wash the
[1:49:46] clothes and who cook the rice.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:52] Now again, I'm not trying to fight over
[1:49:55] our home choices. I'm not trying to
[1:49:58] instruct you how, you know, to run your
[1:50:01] home and, you know, don't don't do this
[1:50:03] and don't do that. But what I'm trying
[1:50:05] to bring you here is that in many in
[1:50:08] many cases, we we try to reduce God's
[1:50:11] divine program and rub it in the dirt
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; of our choices.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:21] Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; We fuss all the time. Yeah. The Bible
[1:50:25] say the woman you must be submissive.
[1:50:26] The Bible say you must be submissive.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Submissive to what?
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Submissive to the word.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Because if she cannot be submissive to
[1:50:38] the word, there is no way she can be
[1:50:40] submissive to you.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; There is no way she can be submissive to
[1:50:44] me.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The man MUST BE A
[1:50:51] PROVIDER OF HIS HOME. That's what the
[1:50:54] word says.
[1:50:56] Provider. Yeah. The Bible say you must
[1:50:58] be a provider. So go outside and work.
[1:51:02] He can go and WORK AND BRING ALL THE
[1:51:05] MONEY TO YOU. If he does not have that
[1:51:08] word provide, pro provide means vision.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; He must BE ABLE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP.
[1:51:19] He can bring all the money. IF HE DOES
[1:51:21] NOT HAVE THAT, Y WILL SAY that right
[1:51:23] there. Y will eat the money. You start
[1:51:24] fighting.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY? THAT'S WHAT we
[1:51:30] have done. We have taken God's divine
[1:51:33] program.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Let let me tell you now. That's the
[1:51:37] reason why the Bible says God says I am
[1:51:40] God and there is no one else.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why he say he's a
[1:51:48] jealous God. Because people, this thing
[1:51:50] is more about God
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; than about you and myself.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; HE MADE US TO HELP him
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; display himself.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; It's more about him
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; than about you and myself.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; IF WE MAKE IT TOO MUCH ABOUT US, you
[1:52:07] will get hurt in the process.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; You will get hurt in the process. People
[1:52:14] have made church TOO MUCH ABOUT
[1:52:16] THEMSELVES. OH, THEY WANT TO BE
[1:52:18] FAITHFUL. THEY want to BE DEDICATED.
[1:52:20] THEY TAKE THE CHURCH. They put the
[1:52:21] church on THEIR HEAD. THEY WILL NOT FIND
[1:52:23] JOB. THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING FOR
[1:52:25] THEMSEL. AT THE END OF THE DAY, they get
[1:52:27] hurt
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; because it's not about you.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; It's not about me. It's about him.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; It's about him.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; And he have called us into this.
[1:52:44] So he can express himself.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU THINK ABOUT IT, HOW CAN MAN LIKE
[1:52:54] US WITH FALLEN NATURE
[1:52:57] AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
[1:52:58] DRILLED IN OUR SPIRIT, our cruess,
[1:53:03] HOW CAN WE HANDLE THIS DIVINE
[1:53:06] CALLING?
[1:53:08] HOW CAN WE HANDLE THIS DIVINE
[1:53:10] COMMISSION?
[1:53:15] MANY MEN HAS TRIED WITH THE EARN WITH
[1:53:18] THE EARNESTY OF THEIR HEART. MANY WOMEN
[1:53:20] HAS TRIED ALL THEY CRY, THEY PRAY, THEY
[1:53:22] TRY TO DO EVERYTHING.
[1:53:31] But you see, God has been out of the
[1:53:33] picture. There's been they've been
[1:53:36] trying to do everything to please this
[1:53:38] man like me that can never be satisfied.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm I'm I'm very picky.
[1:53:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember how many times Jordan
[1:53:53] and myself, we have arranged instinct. I
[1:53:56] push a certain way, he come and push a
[1:53:58] certain way. Praise the Lord.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; I come and look at it. I say, "So, well,
[1:54:03] I think you're supposed to be like this.
[1:54:05] And at the same time I said brother one
[1:54:08] you are you are a preacher you are not
[1:54:10] technician leave the brother to do his
[1:54:12] job.
[1:54:15] BUT THAT'S JUST HUMAN NATURE.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; That's just human nature. If I IF I JUST
[1:54:20] TRY TO MAKE IT MY way then what is going
[1:54:22] to happen? I'm going to hurt HIM BECAUSE
[1:54:24] HE'S DOING ALL OF HIS BEST TO GET IT
[1:54:27] RIGHT. AND THEN I COME. No that's not
[1:54:29] the way I WANT. SO WHAT I'M WHAT I'M
[1:54:31] TRYING TO DO IS THAT I'm trying to make
[1:54:33] him to serve me
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; and serve God.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; I know there a lot of time when a
[1:54:47] preacher preach he's misunderstood. So
[1:54:48] I'm not worried I will be misunderstood
[1:54:51] this morning again.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why we have to
[1:54:54] preach it again and preach it again and
[1:54:55] preach it again. And somebody said, "Oh
[1:54:58] yeah, I didn't understand in that time,
[1:54:59] but this time when you said it, I
[1:55:00] understood it." So
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; you know, so that that is the great
[1:55:06] thing about redemption.
[1:55:09] That is the great thing about
[1:55:11] redemption.
[1:55:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Almighty God could have done everything
[1:55:17] by himself. He could have named the
[1:55:19] animals and come and Adam. It's just a
[1:55:21] free flow. There is nothing for you to
[1:55:23] do. But God, that's that's not the way
[1:55:25] God designed his program.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; He designed his program in partnership.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Even though he knows what to do, but yet
[1:55:34] he will give the responsibility to a man
[1:55:37] and he look at that man
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; to be able to carry out.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; He come down and tell William Brandon,
[1:55:43] it was your choosing.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; It was your choosing
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; even though it was a highway, but it was
[1:55:50] your choice.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; That's what faith is. Faith is making a
[1:55:54] choice.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm looking for the spir aspiring
[1:56:02] partner. Praise the Lord.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for the sparring partner. I
[1:56:07] have one. I have one
[1:56:10] good friend of mine. He comes here all
[1:56:11] the time. The brother there from our
[1:56:13] coast, brother Valentine. A good
[1:56:15] sparring partner. You know, I mean, we
[1:56:17] have fast many night. We have sat down.
[1:56:20] We have fast. Amen. Praise the Lord. At
[1:56:23] that time, he was the pastor, you know,
[1:56:25] there of the local church and and we had
[1:56:27] a situation that we were we were we were
[1:56:30] dealing with. I mean, we were first and
[1:56:31] then we said, "Lord, let's leave it
[1:56:32] right here. Let's go find something to
[1:56:33] eat. Let's stop right here. Let's leave
[1:56:35] it. We come back. We go out." As if to
[1:56:38] say, "We are not fussing." We go out, we
[1:56:40] will find food, we eat, we laugh, we
[1:56:42] talk about different thing, we come back
[1:56:43] again. And uh so the the the the
[1:56:46] conversation was so tough.
[1:56:49] He told me, he says, "Look, my friend,
[1:56:53] you are my friend. I respect you, but
[1:56:55] you are not my Holy Ghost."
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; I mean, when he said that, he took all
[1:57:06] the air out of my tire. I said, "I
[1:57:08] surrender."
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:15] He's my aspiring partner. Even till now.
[1:57:18] I mean there I think many nights we stay
[1:57:20] along on the phone we talk and you know
[1:57:22] when there is situation he calls me and
[1:57:24] we we talk we good friend very good
[1:57:26] friend very very good friend very good
[1:57:29] friend we slap on the floor together I
[1:57:31] mean we we ate uh uh
[1:57:35] uh
[1:57:37] street food together and uh and and
[1:57:41] that's what it is that's what it is but
[1:57:43] you see with the with the society that
[1:57:46] we are living in we we only looking for
[1:57:48] people that will cheer for us.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; We're really not looking for partners.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; We want people that will be on the
[1:57:55] shoreline cheering.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; They must not they must not condemn you.
[1:58:01] They must not con uh you know uh uh they
[1:58:04] must not say that that you are not doing
[1:58:06] well then you don't want them on your
[1:58:08] team anymore.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; But almighty God is not like that. Like
[1:58:12] brother Brandon says, who is who was
[1:58:14] Moses for him to give God a better idea?
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Do you KNOW THAT GOD got Job as a
[1:58:22] sparring partner?
[1:58:26] Well, he never even came to discuss with
[1:58:29] Job.
[1:58:31] He's he's facing his opponent, the
[1:58:33] enemy, and and they are in a debate and
[1:58:36] he's telling his enemy, "I have a man on
[1:58:39] earth. You you you can do anything you
[1:58:40] want to do to people BUT I HAVE A MAN ON
[1:58:43] I HAVE A PARTNER on earth.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we see these things like
[1:58:51] trials. We see it like trouble. We see
[1:58:53] it like oh yeah the whole world is going
[1:58:56] against us and everything is falling
[1:58:57] apart when God have just choose you as a
[1:59:00] sparring partner.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; And watching to see how YOU WILL BEHAVE,
[1:59:04] HOW YOU going to handle the situation.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] when God have just choose you to be
[1:59:16] aparing partner. But you see the spirit
[1:59:19] of loudia,
[1:59:21] the spirit of uh of of of prosperity,
[1:59:24] wealth and and everything must be
[1:59:26] shining and everything must be good, you
[1:59:28] know. And then we must just flip the
[1:59:30] cars and flip the suit and flip the
[1:59:32] homes and AND AND OH THAT'S THE way to
[1:59:34] prove that God is with we are prospering
[1:59:36] and prospering and prospering.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; That's that's our age. So it has put us
[1:59:44] to the place where we are so nervous.
[1:59:48] We are so NERVOUS NOBODY IS THERE. WE
[1:59:51] think people are watching.
[1:59:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; We are so nervous. We are so consumed
[1:59:58] with ourself.
[2:00:01] IT IS JUST US AND us and us and us and
[2:00:05] us and us and us.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:14] Oh, look through the history.
[2:00:16] Look through the history of revival and
[2:00:18] see MEN THAT GOD have used
[2:00:22] and see men that God HAVE USED TO BREAK
[2:00:25] BARRIERS AND AND BRING REVIVAL.
[2:00:28] They can never be compared to our our
[2:00:30] end time preachers because those men had
[2:00:34] to forsake everything, keep their face
[2:00:36] on the ground, seek to please God.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; They had TO GIVE UP A WHOLE LOT OF THIS
[2:00:44] WORD.
[2:00:47] because they wanted to be a partner with
[2:00:49] God to do something for God in their
[2:00:52] generation.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:00:56] this generation we just party enough.
[2:00:58] Just bring it. We don't need to bring
[2:01:01] it. Just bring it. Just bring it. Praise
[2:01:06] the Lord.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; And age world we have become holers. We
[2:01:09] we haul everything from the internet.
[2:01:11] Anything that looks good, we h Oh yeah,
[2:01:14] that's good. That's right. We take it
[2:01:15] from the movie. That's why we try to run
[2:01:17] our home. We take it from Facebook, from
[2:01:20] Ted, from all whatever is out there. We
[2:01:23] have just become hollowers in our
[2:01:25] spirit.
[2:01:28] We have just become holers in our
[2:01:30] spirit. Put the word before us. We
[2:01:32] become anxious to leave. But we put that
[2:01:35] little stream. We can flip and flip and
[2:01:37] flip and flip and flip and flip. And
[2:01:39] your spirit is just consuming.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; It's just consuming.
[2:01:44] is just consuming.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; GOD IS RAISING YOUNG people for his
[2:01:58] generation. He's always thinking about
[2:02:00] the next generation. He brings he brings
[2:02:02] us together uh with our wives and give
[2:02:05] us a responsibility as stewards to be
[2:02:08] able to watch over the children. They
[2:02:09] are not our property. They are God's
[2:02:12] heritage. Amen.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; It is our responsibility to be able to
[2:02:17] watch over them and and and and guide
[2:02:20] them and advise them.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; I never believe that a parent is a Holy
[2:02:24] Ghost to his children. I don't believe
[2:02:26] that.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Because you need the Holy Ghost for
[2:02:31] yourself.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; But we are there. We are there to be
[2:02:36] guides, you know, to to to to be able to
[2:02:38] guide them and help them in making
[2:02:40] choices and and all of that. But we have
[2:02:42] to know THAT JUST AS HOW GOD HAD A
[2:02:47] DIVINE PURPOSE FOR YOUR LIFE, he have a
[2:02:50] divine purpose for the life of those
[2:02:51] children.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO EXPRESS HIMSELF through
[2:02:58] them
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; at at the given time.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Because in every age, God needs a
[2:03:06] partner.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; He's looking FOR THE MAN. HE'S LOOKING
[2:03:10] FOR THE WOMAN that is going to take him
[2:03:12] truth to his word
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; and so he can prove himself through you
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; said try me and see if I will not open
[2:03:19] the windows of heaven
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; proof mean I'm looking for somebody
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; ASPIRING PARTNER NOT SOMEBODY that I
[2:03:27] will give trial to and they will back up
[2:03:29] oh this Christian life is so hard if I
[2:03:31] was not a Christian this is how my life
[2:03:32] was going to be
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[2:03:44] Let's go try with something else
[2:03:45] sickness in our in our lives.
[2:03:49] It it it it it it decanized us.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Who told you so? There was one thing
[2:03:56] when you read the book of Job, there was
[2:03:58] one thing Job said over and over. I'm
[2:04:01] not going to let down my integrity.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He could not understand
[2:04:08] what was what was happening. HE HE NEVER
[2:04:10] SAW THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT WAS
[2:04:12] HAPPENING TO HIM. But he was not
[2:04:14] allowing allowing what he's going
[2:04:16] through to rob him of his faith.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; But as soon as we get little trial, then
[2:04:23] it looks like we don't have faith. Well,
[2:04:24] I need to be my faith in God because the
[2:04:26] prophet say I can speak this thing away.
[2:04:28] I need to know how to speak this thing
[2:04:30] in out of existence. that everything you
[2:04:32] speak out of existence,
[2:04:34] then what kind of world you going to
[2:04:35] live in? Praise the Lord.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; If you speak everything out of
[2:04:40] existence, what kind of a word are you
[2:04:41] going to live in?
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing what I'm going?
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Are you see where I'm going?
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:59] And that's the reason why we have uh we
[2:05:01] have all of the all of the scandal that
[2:05:03] has come around the Christian church
[2:05:07] because it's supposed to be the father's
[2:05:09] business,
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; And the father's business is built on
[2:05:13] partnership.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Now at a place where the bishop just I
[2:05:17] mean he live so large he get a private
[2:05:20] plane to fly him all over and the people
[2:05:22] are living in poverty.
[2:05:29] We have made a DISGRACE BECAUSE WE WE
[2:05:31] DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE WE REALLY HAVE NOT
[2:05:33] GRABBED THE principle of what we
[2:05:35] believe.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; We're just making a religion out of it
[2:05:39] somewhere where we CAN WE CAN PLEDGE our
[2:05:41] allegiance to
[2:05:44] but we have not got the principle.
[2:05:49] Oh, that's the reason why that prophet
[2:05:50] would tell US HE SAYS WARS ARE FOUGHT
[2:05:53] FOR PRINCIPLES.
[2:05:55] You say if there is something goes
[2:05:57] wrong, let's sit down. Let's talk about
[2:05:58] it. That's why we have a word of God. We
[2:06:00] are not run by a nation constitution. We
[2:06:03] are run by the word of God. Let's look
[2:06:05] into the word of God. IF YOU AND MYSELF
[2:06:07] HAVE THE SAME INTEREST to make this
[2:06:09] place better. Then we can judge our
[2:06:11] differences with the word.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; WE CAN JUDGE IT WITH THE WORD. AND
[2:06:15] PRETTY SOON I WILL SAY, "OH, I really
[2:06:17] never see. Now I understand where you
[2:06:19] coming from." And you can say, "Now I
[2:06:21] see what you were doing." That's
[2:06:22] partnership.
[2:06:25] It's not WHEN I WHEN I'M WHEN I'M JUST
[2:06:27] CONSUMED that it must be my way or no
[2:06:29] way. That's not partnership.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; I'm being a detector.
[2:06:35] IF I'M JUST BRINGING MY THOUGHTS AND
[2:06:37] BRINGING and and and just bringing my
[2:06:39] desire TO YOU, I CAN'T show it to you
[2:06:41] from the word of God. I believe THE
[2:06:43] REASON WHY YOU MUST BELIEVE THINGS I
[2:06:45] said is because it's from the word.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; If it is not FROM THE WORD, YOU HAVE A
[2:06:48] RIGHT TO QUESTION IT. AMEN.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Ask me they say where is it in the word?
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT OR OUR PASTOR SAY OR OUR
[2:06:59] CHURCH SAY YOU CAN TELL SOMEBODY IT'S MY
[2:07:01] CONVICTION because it's in the word of
[2:07:03] God.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; I can't show it to you now but I will
[2:07:06] get the scripture for you later.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother B says we need a spiring
[2:07:16] partner.
[2:07:17] the guy that would get in the ring.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; And I mean, in training, he will bl your
[2:07:23] nose,
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; but you know that he don't hate you.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; You know, he he's he's doing it to make
[2:07:29] you better.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; But I mean, we are so much on eggshells.
[2:07:39] We are so much on eggshells that as soon
[2:07:43] as something is said, "Oh, it it hurt
[2:07:46] that thing you said. said I didn't like
[2:07:47] it hurt my feelings.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; If homes, if uh if uh if if if children
[2:08:12] and parents were were were were were
[2:08:16] you know uh working together like
[2:08:18] sparring partners, I mean a lot of our
[2:08:20] homes will not be broken.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; But I mean if you tell the child, I'm
[2:08:30] the father, I'm paying the bills here
[2:08:32] and you got to do what I say.
[2:08:35] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:37] Then right there he start building his
[2:08:40] mind. I I have to stop I have to start
[2:08:43] saving and and get out of this house.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Because he don't feel like a partner.
[2:08:50] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; He feel like he just be laboring just to
[2:08:55] be able to build your empire.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:01] Like I said, I'm I'm I'm just using all
[2:09:04] of these examples
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; to be able to grab your attention. I'm
[2:09:08] not I'm not shooting bullets at you
[2:09:10] people.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not shooting bullets at you
[2:09:14] people.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; And uh uh there's there there's one
[2:09:17] thing that is in my mind is for you to
[2:09:19] realize that your redemption, you are
[2:09:22] called to partnership.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; If you don't treat it as a partnership,
[2:09:28] you will live under privilege.
[2:09:32] You're going to live on a privilege
[2:09:35] because you're going to be looking for
[2:09:36] all the prophets that will prophesy in
[2:09:39] your life
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; because you lazy to pray it.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; So you just want the one that can sow
[2:09:51] seed or prophecy in your life.
[2:09:55] But if YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR
[2:09:57] redemption you are called on partnership
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; and you remember THAT THERE WAS A MAN
[2:10:03] THAT TOOK THE ROAD THE old rugged cross
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; when he battle
[2:10:12] NOT MY WILL BUT LET your will be done.
[2:10:15] Let this cup pass over me BUT FATHER NOT
[2:10:17] YOUR WILL LET MY WILL BE DONE. THEN WHEN
[2:10:20] THE ENEMY IS BRINGING THINGS IN YOUR
[2:10:22] LIFE AND YOU REMEMBER there was a price
[2:10:24] that was paid. Praise the Lord. AND HE'S
[2:10:27] TRYING TO DRAG YOU DOWN IN SIN AND RUIN
[2:10:30] YOUR LIFE WITH A HABIT. YOU CAN RUN DOWN
[2:10:32] TO your pastor and say, "Lord, you pay
[2:10:34] your price. THIS IS MY TIME. GIVE ME
[2:10:37] GRACE. LET ME STAND for you. Give me
[2:10:39] grace. LET ME RISE up from this."
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:47] You will not say, "Well, I've been
[2:10:49] praying this thing here. I've been
[2:10:50] praying about it. I've been praying now.
[2:10:52] I've been praying. I've been praying for
[2:10:54] many years now. This thing I've been
[2:10:56] praying for many years now."
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; It's because you've been doing it by
[2:10:59] yourself.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; It's because you've been doing it by
[2:11:05] yourself.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope the people are understanding
[2:11:12] me this morning.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope the people are
[2:11:16] understanding me. See, brother Brown
[2:11:17] will talk about another partnership
[2:11:19] here, which of course I think is a evil
[2:11:21] partnership. And I like the way that he
[2:11:23] symbolized it. The church of the living
[2:11:26] God.
[2:11:28] The church of the living God.
[2:11:31] But every look in the drawer to bring me
[2:11:33] bring me a hanky.
[2:11:36] I think I left it somewhere in the
[2:11:37] office there.
[2:11:40] See see what he says now. Here goes that
[2:11:44] spirit, a blackness, a dark a darkness
[2:11:48] leaving that man. Now he's uh he's he's
[2:11:51] looking at an evil spirit. He just
[2:11:52] prayed for the person. Watch the evil
[2:11:54] spirit leaving the man. And he says uh
[2:11:58] uh uh uh uh there goes that spirit, a
[2:12:00] blackness, a darkness leaving the man.
[2:12:02] Similarly, you could see it. Watch it. A
[2:12:07] God, a sympathizing partner.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:13] As much as we want a sparring partner,
[2:12:16] we don't want a sympathizing partner.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because you see, a
[2:12:24] sympathizing partner
[2:12:26] uh uh uh in in in most cases is is uh uh
[2:12:31] uh uh
[2:12:38] it's the one that comes and make you cry
[2:12:40] the the hardest.
[2:12:44] Praise the Lord.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; They come and then and and then the the
[2:12:49] they raise their voice and then uh uh uh
[2:12:52] you know uh uh uh and then there's there
[2:12:55] is no tears.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; They are not really connecting with the
[2:12:59] pains that you have in you.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; They are they are just there for the
[2:13:09] moment. Yeah,
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; they are there for the moment
[2:13:13] and when they are gone you don't feel
[2:13:15] their presence
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; but aspiring partner
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; you feel his presence because when you
[2:13:22] go home you feel the pain being
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; said that guy you really gave it to me
[2:13:26] today
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; you feel the presence of aspiring
[2:13:29] partner
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; but a sympathizing partner you don't
[2:13:31] feel the presence you just we just well
[2:13:34] we just we just rub one another on the
[2:13:36] back and you know yeah yeah it will be
[2:13:38] fine yeah yeah it will be fine time, my
[2:13:40] man. Yeah. You know, yeah.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; But yeah, he's talking about a
[2:13:49] sympathotizing partner. And we know how
[2:13:51] he let how he how he taught us this. How
[2:13:54] demons will sympathize with one another
[2:13:56] in a meeting.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says you are
[2:13:59] rebuking the demon here and then there's
[2:14:01] another one down that will be calling
[2:14:03] for help.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. the same spirit trying to
[2:14:06] sympathize with his friend that so so so
[2:14:10] they can be so I I I was just looking at
[2:14:13] this and and it it just caught my mind
[2:14:16] and uh uh it got a sympathizing partner
[2:14:18] just a moment
[2:14:20] uh there it fall just a moment yes there
[2:14:23] it fall over the man seeing there with a
[2:14:27] t-shirt blackheaded man
[2:14:30] his hands is in his face and that spirit
[2:14:32] just went and hover over him. Praise the
[2:14:35] Lord. Because sometimes, you know, the
[2:14:37] people are in a meeting and uh uh uh
[2:14:40] they are having resentful spirit. You
[2:14:43] know, a resentful spirit is a
[2:14:45] sympathizing uh partner to the devil.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Because when we are rebuking the devil
[2:14:50] and we are preaching the word of God and
[2:14:52] preaching something against sin and and
[2:14:55] you are there that resenting it, uh uh
[2:14:57] uh you are just sympathizing with the
[2:14:59] devil.
[2:15:07] And yeah, we want God to do things in
[2:15:09] our midst. Yeah, we want God to move in
[2:15:11] our lives and move in our home and
[2:15:14] change situation for us.
[2:15:17] But can we take him as a partner?
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Can we take him
[2:15:24] as a partner? Where will he bring his
[2:15:26] word and bring the correction of his
[2:15:28] word?
[2:15:30] We will say yes Lord I believe it.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; LORD MY FLESH IS FALLING. LORD I'M WEAK.
[2:15:40] Help me Lord to rise out of this.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:57] But Ram talks about these these these
[2:15:59] guys here. Uh share that with you all.
[2:16:02] So he has to pass this way. Let's
[2:16:04] remember Mr. Bell
[2:16:06] of the fruit gi
[2:16:09] let them remember Mr. Craig of the
[2:16:12] cheese.
[2:16:16] How that he couldn't make a a go of his
[2:16:21] cheese. And one day a voice spoke to
[2:16:25] him, "Take me for a partner." Now,
[2:16:29] Brother Brham is talking about people
[2:16:30] that were in business. People that were
[2:16:33] in business and and trying to do
[2:16:35] something and just trying to do it by
[2:16:37] themsel,
[2:16:40] trying to do it by themsel and and they
[2:16:42] want to make gain. They want to make
[2:16:44] profit and and and uh uh but they're
[2:16:47] trying to do it by themsel. And pretty
[2:16:50] soon they are they they are cutting
[2:16:52] corners and compromising and you know uh
[2:16:55] uh uh and getting themselves into all
[2:16:57] sorts of uh scam and all of that. He
[2:17:00] says and one day this man yet a boy said
[2:17:03] take me for a partner and many other
[2:17:06] categit
[2:17:10] is from.
[2:17:13] Praise the Lord. You will realize that
[2:17:16] most of your your your industries that
[2:17:19] we have today that they were built by
[2:17:22] men that took God as a partner.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; They took God as a partner.
[2:17:31] In the beginning of their businesses,
[2:17:33] they put God first.
[2:17:37] They knew that this partner only asked
[2:17:39] them for the 10%. So they make sure that
[2:17:42] they give him it. And he kept he kept
[2:17:44] his part. And yeah, he's telling us here
[2:17:47] this man took God as a partner. They
[2:17:50] took God into their business.
[2:17:54] Sister, yeah, this is business. This is
[2:17:56] not this is not Christianity. That
[2:17:57] business here. When you hear people
[2:18:00] saying that, which mean they're ready to
[2:18:01] cheat.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Something that you will put your faith
[2:18:07] on the on the shelf to do,
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; don't do it. Amen.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; If you will not do it by faith, don't do
[2:18:15] it
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; because there is no way you would do it
[2:18:18] right
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; except you do it by faith except you can
[2:18:22] apply the word of God
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; to what you are doing.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; He said this man they took God as a
[2:18:29] partner and God bless his cheese
[2:18:32] business and bless Mr. Coke business.
[2:18:34] Till now we still brushing our teeth
[2:18:36] with co toothpaste and all that. There
[2:18:38] were men that took God as a partner.
[2:18:41] Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me read this. Christ is the
[2:18:46] ministry of God revealed. And I found a
[2:18:48] place to close here
[2:18:50] since I have many many more services to
[2:18:52] come. Just the beginning of the year.
[2:18:54] Amen.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just the beginning of
[2:18:57] the year.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:06] But that's what we talking about people.
[2:19:08] That's why we want that's why we want to
[2:19:11] see it. We want to be able to understand
[2:19:14] it that this whole thing I mean there is
[2:19:18] no way we can we can we can move this
[2:19:21] little church until we get into
[2:19:24] partnership.
[2:19:26] Amen.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; It's not a oneman show. It's not a
[2:19:30] oneman business.
[2:19:32] I wish you were a preacher. I bring you
[2:19:34] here to preach as well.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Unless we can realize it's a
[2:19:47] partnership. That's when I take my
[2:19:48] family.
[2:19:51] That's what I can do for the Lord right
[2:19:53] now. And then let's do it.
[2:19:56] Let's build a name to the Lord.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Let's build a memorial to his name.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. M
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; if time I remember many years back I I I
[2:20:06] I was I was traveling to Guinea one time
[2:20:09] for the for the for the crusade and uh
[2:20:14] and I passed in the city I pass in the
[2:20:16] city where I started preaching as a
[2:20:19] young young boy back in 1993 1994
[2:20:25] I needed to pass there and get to the
[2:20:27] boat of beginning and then take my
[2:20:29] transportation the people that invited
[2:20:31] me was coming this way that message
[2:20:32] believers. Uh these were people that got
[2:20:35] in contact with a brother here in the
[2:20:37] States and he wanted me to help him at
[2:20:39] the time.
[2:20:42] So
[2:20:44] right down I was down to the station as
[2:20:46] I was waiting I saw I saw one one
[2:20:48] gentleman and that gentleman he was he
[2:20:51] was an he was uh yeah he was an
[2:20:54] immigration officer at the time when the
[2:20:57] city was controlled by the rebels. Now
[2:21:00] the city, the the country was back
[2:21:02] together and I saw him Paul and I went
[2:21:04] down and I call him I call I said Paul
[2:21:07] how are you?
[2:21:09] He stood back he took his glasses from
[2:21:11] his face. He says he says man where you
[2:21:16] have been oh I've been in aos
[2:21:19] he says he says man when you boys left
[2:21:23] from here this town knew
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; that there were some guys that left from
[2:21:29] here. Amen.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; I still remember I remember the first
[2:21:31] time we went to preach. We were there
[2:21:33] preaching to the station. We preach talk
[2:21:36] about Jesus Christ. We were so excited.
[2:21:38] Brother Sebastian and myself and and
[2:21:40] some other brothers James Nim. We were
[2:21:42] so excited, you know. We preach and talk
[2:21:44] everything we want to talk. They were
[2:21:46] listening to us. They were asking us
[2:21:48] question, you know, and all of that. As
[2:21:51] soon as we finish, they told us take off
[2:21:53] your shoes.
[2:21:57] and said we should take out our shoes.
[2:21:59] So first I thought it was joke.
[2:22:03] They said we should take out our shoes.
[2:22:05] We must take out our shirts.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; We must sat down. We must sit down on
[2:22:09] the ground
[2:22:11] because uh uh they they are suspecting
[2:22:14] that we are on a recurren.
[2:22:17] How can how can the young men like you
[2:22:19] people says you are preaching you know
[2:22:22] they're checking all on our body for
[2:22:24] marks and everything
[2:22:26] and uh and they were going to to
[2:22:29] imprison us
[2:22:32] unless one of the one of the clergy of
[2:22:34] the of the city. So good enough we knew
[2:22:38] the the the Methodist bishop because we
[2:22:41] were using the Methodist guest house
[2:22:43] that's where we were living and he gave
[2:22:45] it to us. So we reference him and they
[2:22:47] sent somebody to call him and he came
[2:22:49] over to the station and uh and he says,
[2:22:52] "Oh yeah, these are my boys. These these
[2:22:55] are all my songs. Y'all let them go."
[2:22:57] And then after the guys came to shake
[2:22:58] our hands, you know, says, "You should
[2:23:00] come back next week Tuesday.
[2:23:05] You should come back next week Tuesday."
[2:23:08] And definitely I went back next week
[2:23:10] Tuesday, you know. I I was I was I
[2:23:13] always go there, you know. So he he was
[2:23:15] telling me, you know, he told me, he
[2:23:17] says, "Yeah, man. When you guys left, we
[2:23:19] knew that uh we could feed it, you know,
[2:23:21] we could feed it because we were not
[2:23:22] hearing street preachers on the street
[2:23:24] and all of that." I mean, uh uh I mean,
[2:23:27] it's it's the time that is given for us.
[2:23:29] Amen.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; It's a time that is given for us. This
[2:23:31] is where we find ourself, you know. Uh
[2:23:34] and do what you can do for the Lord with
[2:23:37] the time that is given for you. Amen.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Do what you can do for the Lord.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:44] Praise the Lord. Oh man, we we have some
[2:23:47] have some horrible stories to tell you,
[2:23:50] but not today. Christ is the mystery of
[2:23:52] God revealed.
[2:23:55] Now listen to this. Now he says, "But
[2:23:58] but when he put man on partnership with
[2:24:02] him," Almighty God put man on
[2:24:05] partnership with him, then let a man act
[2:24:09] as a free moral agent. See, God,
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; he he he he put a man on partnership and
[2:24:18] he was not using a remote control to to
[2:24:20] to control the man life.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; He put the man on partnership and yet he
[2:24:24] put him on free moral agency to make
[2:24:26] choices.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Because how how are we going to ever be
[2:24:33] better if we don't make mistakes?
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; How are we going to improve
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; if we don't make mistakes?
[2:24:41] Amen. So he put us on free moral
[2:24:44] agencies for us to choose, make choices.
[2:24:51] And yet when Adam fell, he was the same
[2:24:55] one that was coming AND SAYING, "ADAM,
[2:24:56] ADAM, WHERE ARE YOU?" HE WAS THE SAME
[2:24:58] ONE MAKING ALL THE EFFORT TO be able to
[2:25:01] redeem this man back. He didn't say, "Oh
[2:25:04] no, YOU YOU HAVE JUST PULLED MY PLAN."
[2:25:06] NO.
[2:25:10] What a man of free moral agency.
[2:25:14] The same thing that he got he got you on
[2:25:17] today. See
[2:25:19] you you at a way you want to you are you
[2:25:23] are a free moral agent.
[2:25:25] So therefore if he put the first
[2:25:29] like that he has to put the second like
[2:25:32] that. He has to put everyone like that.
[2:25:36] Oh he acted wrong in the first place.
[2:25:38] See, but everybody on that same basis
[2:25:42] now notice him in bringing that back and
[2:25:47] letting man do that and knowing that he
[2:25:51] will do it knowing he would do it. But
[2:25:54] what did he do? He displayed his
[2:25:57] attribute as a savior. Praise the Lord.
[2:26:01] Amen. Because that is the only way it
[2:26:04] was going to happen. That is the only
[2:26:06] way it was going to happen. So we have
[2:26:08] to see that it is it is almighty God
[2:26:12] that get this plan. Amen. It's almighty
[2:26:15] God that station this place. It's
[2:26:17] almighty God that has brought us
[2:26:19] together as his children. He has brought
[2:26:21] us together as as as partners to be able
[2:26:24] to lift up the name of Jesus from the
[2:26:26] corner of this street. Then let's do the
[2:26:28] best that we can.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Let's do the best that we can.
[2:26:35] Praise the Lord. Amen. If I mean if uh
[2:26:38] if if if if what you can put in it is to
[2:26:41] is to pray then put it in it. If you if
[2:26:44] if it's to preach then put it put it in
[2:26:46] it also. If it's to sing then put it in
[2:26:49] it.
[2:26:54] Are we together?
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Inspiring partners.
[2:26:59] Spiring partners.
[2:27:02] If we can be able to look at one another
[2:27:04] like sparring partners
[2:27:07] and a brother come and tell you that
[2:27:09] your tie is not straight, you will not
[2:27:11] tell him only you know how to tie neck
[2:27:13] tie.
[2:27:15] That is you you will see that okay this
[2:27:17] guy want me to look better than you know
[2:27:20] I'm supposed to look like.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; But I mean we we we have so much of a
[2:27:24] thin skin.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; Thin skin. Let somebody just say
[2:27:29] something. We we blow it out of
[2:27:30] proportion. We don't even see. Okay.
[2:27:33] Where were they going?
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; What were they trying to do?
[2:27:43] Life will be so easy and better if we
[2:27:46] would just quickly look at things in a
[2:27:48] positive way. Okay. Yeah, they were
[2:27:49] trying to help me. And then they come
[2:27:51] back and prove that they were really not
[2:27:53] trying to help you.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:27:57] You will realize that you will feel so
[2:28:00] much good.
[2:28:02] Even if they come and tell you sorry for
[2:28:04] for criticizing you that day, it will
[2:28:06] not it's not going to fix you because
[2:28:08] you never saw it as crit as the person
[2:28:11] criticizing you.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; That's the thing that is that is
[2:28:18] breaking our society. That is the thing
[2:28:20] that is destroying homes and and and and
[2:28:22] and and and pulling the church apart is
[2:28:26] because everybody is just on their
[2:28:28] individual show.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus said I must be about the father
[2:28:35] business
[2:28:37] and the father business is built on
[2:28:39] partnership.
[2:28:42] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; When God redeemed you, when he allowed
[2:28:46] you to see the light of the gospel, when
[2:28:48] he opened your heart to make you to
[2:28:51] believe his word, he was not just doing
[2:28:54] it because he wanted
[2:28:58] to just get another person whose life he
[2:29:00] will frustrate. He was doing it because
[2:29:03] he think he can build partnership in
[2:29:05] you. He was doing it because he thinks
[2:29:08] that
[2:29:12] he have found a man. He have found a
[2:29:13] woman that would trust him. He have
[2:29:16] found somebody that would take him at
[2:29:18] his word. And through that person,
[2:29:22] he might not save a whole nation.
[2:29:25] But he might use that person to
[2:29:27] influence their home.
[2:29:30] He might use that person to shape the
[2:29:31] life of one young man or one young
[2:29:33] woman.
[2:29:36] You might use that person to help uh uh
[2:29:39] their spouse to become better.
[2:29:43] We can see it in the light of
[2:29:44] partnership.
[2:29:48] Praise the Lord.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Remember your aspiring partner will be
[2:29:54] like your opponent. They might look like
[2:29:56] your enemy, but they are not your enemy.
[2:29:59] God placed them there to make you
[2:30:00] better.
[2:30:04] Praise the Lord.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; He placed them there to make you better.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; And the more things comes up, the more
[2:30:11] you take it back to him. Lord, you gave
[2:30:13] me this power partner and and give me
[2:30:15] grace.
[2:30:21] But more than anything,
[2:30:24] he want to be your spiring partner.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He want to be your sparring
[2:30:31] partner or he call you to be his
[2:30:34] partner.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; You might not believe this but it's
[2:30:39] truth. God need you
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; more than you need him.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; He needs you more than you need him
[2:30:52] because he's the one that want to make
[2:30:54] his his attribute known.
[2:30:58] He needs you.
[2:31:01] God could have just folded with Adam and
[2:31:03] Eve and and and and and destroyed them.
[2:31:05] We will never hear their name. We have
[2:31:07] never known them. Created another man in
[2:31:10] his image.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; But because he needs us more than we
[2:31:14] need him. He's the one that is
[2:31:16] constantly coming after us. He's the one
[2:31:18] that is constantly calling Adam. Adam,
[2:31:21] where are you? He's the one that is
[2:31:22] constantly breaking our heart and and
[2:31:24] appealing to our heart. No, this is not
[2:31:26] the way for you to do it. You're not
[2:31:28] supposed to do this. You can do better
[2:31:29] than this.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; It's because he needs you.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; The musicians can come.
[2:31:51] I don't know about you this morning.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:32:00] But when we sang that song, thou my
[2:32:02] everlasting portion,
[2:32:06] more than frame of life to me,
[2:32:10] when we sang that this morning,
[2:32:18] as the Lord, if there is ever the time
[2:32:20] that I want to be close, today
[2:32:23] is now.
[2:32:27] aspiring partners.
[2:32:30] That's what redemption is all about.
[2:32:33] Amen.
[2:32:35] Praise the Lord.
[2:32:38] That's what redemption is all about.
[2:32:45] Paul says, "Let's let's provoke one
[2:32:47] another to good works, desparing
[2:32:50] partners.
[2:32:51] Let's provoke one another.
[2:32:54] Whatever we are doing, whatever
[2:32:56] encouragement, whatever correction, let
[2:32:58] us be towards good work.
[2:33:02] So we can be better at what we are
[2:33:04] doing. We can improve our prayer life.
[2:33:06] We can bring praise. We can bring
[2:33:08] worship. We can be able to support the
[2:33:10] work of God.
[2:33:25] I don't know
[2:33:28] about you this uh afternoon.
[2:33:43] Let's just bow our heads together
[2:33:49] and I pray that this will challenge each
[2:33:51] and every one of us.
[2:33:55] I hope something was said from the word
[2:33:57] of God that would challenge you
[2:34:00] to take the word as a asparing partner.
[2:34:08] If you have a loved ones with you
[2:34:12] that both of you will be sparring
[2:34:14] partners. We will not be afraid to
[2:34:16] criticize one another because we know we
[2:34:19] are doing it.
[2:34:23] We are doing it to be able to achieve
[2:34:26] the best.
[2:34:36] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:34:49] We have made our our own personal
[2:34:52] selfishness
[2:34:54] to just consume us that we don't see God
[2:34:57] in the picture of our life.
[2:35:15] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:35:22] It's all about you.
[2:35:25] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:35:29] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[2:35:33] I made.
[2:35:36] It's all about you.
[2:35:39] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:35:44] I'm coming back to the heart
[2:35:48] of worship.
[2:35:51] Lord, it's all about you, Lord.
[2:35:58] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; It's all about you. Yes.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:36:16] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:36:21] You just think about it. I don't know
[2:36:23] what you going going through in your
[2:36:25] life.
[2:36:26] I don't know why what you thinking or
[2:36:29] where your mind is this morning.
[2:36:33] But you think about it. Think about it
[2:36:35] this afternoon.
[2:36:38] Think about it this afternoon.
[2:36:46] That God designed your path.
[2:36:49] The almighty God, the one that
[2:36:52] constructed you, that put your nerves
[2:36:55] and put all your seniors together.
[2:37:04] And yet he have choose you. The one that
[2:37:07] know your weaknesses. He knows your
[2:37:09] failure. He knows the things you are
[2:37:11] struggling with.
[2:37:14] But the talk of his love will never
[2:37:16] leave your heart. He keeps talking to
[2:37:19] your heart. He keeps pulling you to
[2:37:22] yourself.
[2:37:23] You might be feeling in your flesh and
[2:37:25] feeling in your mind
[2:37:30] and get your life into some mess that
[2:37:32] you regret of.
[2:37:39] But because God has chosen you as a
[2:37:41] partner, he's not ready to give up on
[2:37:43] you.
[2:37:45] He's not ready to let you go.
[2:37:48] He know how much you can be of a benefit
[2:37:51] to his kingdom. He know how much he know
[2:37:54] what he can do in your life. And he know
[2:37:57] how much through you he can touch the
[2:37:59] life of others.
[2:38:08] I just want every one of us this
[2:38:10] afternoon
[2:38:12] if we would just uh
[2:38:16] recommmit ourself in the hands of the
[2:38:18] Lord. And
[2:38:20] Lord, sorry. I've been so selfish. I
[2:38:23] just been consumed by myself. I've been
[2:38:25] I just been thinking about myself. I
[2:38:28] just want to make myself happy. I've
[2:38:30] kicked you out of the picture, Lord God.
[2:38:33] But thank you father, you have not given
[2:38:35] up on me. Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:38:51] It's all about you.
[2:38:55] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:38:59] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made.
[2:39:05] It's all about you.
[2:39:08] It's all about you, G. Oh, long me back
[2:39:15] to a heart of worship.
[2:39:19] It's all about you, Lord.
[2:39:23] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:39:26] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I needed.
[2:39:33] It's all about you.
[2:39:36] All about you, Jesus.
[2:39:40] Let's pray together now.
[2:39:43] Each and every one of us can just speak
[2:39:44] to the Lord in a special way
[2:39:48] and recommmit ourself
[2:39:51] to this partnership that he has called
[2:39:53] us to.
[2:39:55] He has called you to be his partner
[2:39:58] in raising up your family and in raising
[2:40:00] up your home. He has called you to be
[2:40:03] his partner in the neighborhood where
