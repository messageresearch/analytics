========================================

[Music] so [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] he told me to do that he told me to say that i thought every bob-haired woman would be standing here that overcome see you just get so hard and so far away you pass that line between that surging see not hearing the word of god i thought surely it would happen but i guess maybe it's later and i really think remember the blood is not upon my hands i have not shunned to declare you the counsel of god the way it is remember there's something inside identifying the outside get away from it sister dear brother get her by the hand come on up here why don't you won't you be once you want to be a real christian what you used to live that halfway life and living under condemnation don't you do that see you would say well i i don't care what you've done your fruits is what you're known by i cross america constantly every year across it gets worse and worse so i know there's something wrong the day of grace is passing by don't let that happen to you here in tampa you're here in a great big fabulous city where everything's full of glamour just like hollywood the whole world has become contaminated all on televisions and things it's some old vlogger dirty stuff and you try to pattern yourself like that once you take jesus example once you let him won't you listen to his word won't you do these things that's right how many in here honestly say that you know you haven't got the holy ghost look at yourself in the mirror and know you have it no just look at your own life and the way you do not because you belong to church i belong to methodist baptist president that's all right i said i think it's that but i'm asking you do you know christ jesus is he living in you if he does he'll identify himself there if he's there he's bound to let himself be knowing you can't hide him he stands out you haven't got the holy ghost and you know you haven't raise up your hand be that honest say i haven't got the holy ghost i know i am god bless you for that sincerity god will honor that sincerity if you want the holy ghost won't you come stand here with these now these penitent centers here won't you come at this time come up and say while we sing it again say i want it brother brown i'll tell you that it takes that's you're going to have to have it for the rapture it's exactly right now you remember do you believe that god speaks to you you believe that's jesus christ raise up your hand if you believe this week you've been in the meetings you believe it's christ all right then your place is at the altar women's shame on you man shame on you for letting her do it you man out here doing those things and some of you ministers that almighty dollar instead of almighty god's word let that congregation get that kind of shape this because some organization you read the same bible and i read just ashamed of yourself jesus with dirty feet and haven't you got the real christians spunk about you to stand up and take up for it look like you should god be merciful i pray that god will send the holy ghost and conviction just now that'll make this congregation realize where it's sitting are you conscious that this is your opportunity are you going to do like that courier did pass up your last opportunity are you going to do that don't you do it if there's a doubt any worse something wrong can you hear your place right down here take your place this is your place say well i don't want no need it won't either they could went overseas sitting there they could identify themselves but it's against their congregation what about wasn't against him that little woman didn't care she knows she was a sinner she got forgiveness i don't know what happened where are they at tonight where's that woman at tonight you think and worst pharisee at tonight though religious if you could hear them both where they're at you sure take her place any time so no matter how religious you are if you jesus keeps every appointment every commandment you have to answer for so you better come now if you haven't got the holy ghost he commanded you to he said in the book of acts peter did said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises and to you and to your children and to them as far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and as long as he's still calling he's still given the holy ghost [Music] while we sing again won't you come that's my last time now remember christ has been hearing you all raise your hands identified that it was him in his word and down that christ in my heart is greed jesus set up over jerusalem one time said jerusalem jerusalem how often i have hovered you as the hen doesn't brew but you would not a lot of times i come amongst as i sold you this morning in the breakfast you find pentecostal people and all kinds of people when i come among you the holy spirit down in me is saying how off would i ever gather them how the church had been standing today in his power but you would not see you would not won't you do it now this is the time lay aside every weight that's the sin that doesn't easily beset you let's run with patience the race is set before us while we call one more time everybody sing with me now get right up and come up here if you haven't got the baptism of the spirit if you're a sinner backslider whatever you are come on up let's pray together will you now this is our last call softly and tenderly [Music] jesus [Music] is [Music] what a fair secret here that old recall tonight sitting back there what would he do come on [Music] he's seen his way yeah wait will you do the same thing what if that courier boy could stand before him again what would be the first [Music] thing [Music] is come home [Music] come on [Music] is there still a tender spot in there if there is calm let him come in take it over right there he'll make you a new creature you're going you're the happiest person you ever was [Music] calling [Music] let's hum it [Music] you are weary [Music] are you concerned if you're convinced then you're concerned but if you're not convinced yet that it's jesus then you can't be concerned [Music] a writer in the public became too much about us to make a confession somehow there's a man across the nation here many great [Music] and he said he said i'm an evangelist the man the gate said let's see if your name is showing the books that it isn't he said the lot of the ministers said i couldn't help what you were if your name's not on here you can't enter the story just like this man you have to have the name on the boat and he said well what can i do he said you might have leave your face if you want to to this god's white throne judgment old brother sister don't ever go there so he said i guess i have no other authority about him so he said if i can get started going somewhere he didn't know where is that this is the name he said i would come into a life there's no certain place that was coming forward but it got slower while i stopped i heard a boy said who approaches my protestant justice he said i danny martin that i'm an advances in the united they wouldn't let me states he said all right if you've appealed your case to stand in my courts he said then i require justice he said i have the commandments said danny martin did you ever lie in your life he said i thought i've been a truthful man but in the presence of that light i realized that sets the thing's machine she said uh yes sir i told lies he said did you ever steal he said i thought i've been honest but i'd see some deals then when you get the presence of that light you think you're all right now but this week you get there trying to approach it one time with bob there [Music] do you think i'm just saying that i'll prove it to you in the scripture here exactly try wearing a pair of slacks shorts find out where you're at when the bible says it's an abomination to the sight of god [Music] when where's your conscience i said well did you ever do this or that yes he said and danny if you ever see it he said yes i see and he's just not here he said his bones looked like he was coming out of the joint to hear that depart into everlasting hell from my presence said he heard the sweetest voice he ever heard he said he looked around and said he's seen the sweetest face that he ever saw he said he said father that's true that he tried to live in everything that he knows how to live but he did do wrong but one thing he did down on earth he stood for me he stood up for me took up for me and all my word now stand for him here that's what you're doing now you're making a stand for him here he'll make a stand for you before lord jesus i pray that you'll be merciful and grant the forgiveness of these people's sins they've come here to make a stand they each want to be filled with the holy ghost grant if you'll be given i clean that lord for your glory while they stand before this audience as a witness some of them are church members some of them are backsliders some of them have never accepted you before and they're standing here and they see the dirt that follows a real true christian confession and they're ready now to take their stand to that woman to confess their sinners but with their tears of repentance they want to wash the dirt from your name grant that they can do it i'm going to ask you one day [Music] before we go back [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the attitude you take now you feel like that you're well enough all right that's between you and god i'm not going to judge i'm just responsible for the word these years of these they come out of churches too but they're going to settle right now it's all of it they're ready why don't we live a halfway christian life or either be for god or be against them so the world in all your colors know where you stand god bless them they're going in just like to die to themselves they're going to give their life they're going to calvary they're going to be crucified to the things of the world in the fashions of this glamorous day where they're going to die for jesus christ whose presence they're is to die out to themselves to be born new to jesus christ [Laughter] [Music] god [Music] asleep [Music] oh [Music] i know there's so many [Music] i offer to you jesus christ when you receive when you receive will you my sister for you my brethren come and make her [Music] somebody is getting their final call that's embarrassing before he lives i understand we realize that but it's it's a shame this way but i guess it has to be that way inside of me just something carrying me out now let me show you just a minute look here just to show you he's still here the people that's sick of me i'm looking around at a person here that's lost their sense of smell [Music] that's right [Music] here since an old woman said he never she just come into this country today she come from georgia she's got a great big tumor on the inside of it very bad off she believed she can be healed she'll just come into her name as miss turner you'll believe with all your heart now jesus christ will make you well you believe it you believe in god are you a stranger you don't have no prayer card do you you just come in today somebody come and got you you come down here from the state of georgia you believe god god your son come and god all right now you know it's totally impossible for me to know that because you just come in this wall of one sitting out here that's right raise up your hands okay now the same holy spirit is saying that it's just pumping against the people right here hallelujah he's identified folks don't don't do that you're making a rational mistake amen i love you remember you come to hear it i appreciate that love is correct [Music] you see your kid out here in the street would you say just say junior you want to do that you'll go out and make him stay in if you love him love is corrected i'm patting you i have to scold you remember it's even your offerings and things that pays for this meeting it makes it possible for to be here do i love you with all of my heart sister you might think i've got something against you for doing the things you do it is that i have anything against you sister it's my godly love for you someone said if he was a little bit younger you wouldn't think that i thought this when i was 14 years old the bible says so it's the same thing don't make that mistake don't you trust in speaking in tongues for the holy ghost only go speak sometimes but don't you trust that doing the things that you're doing dancing in the spirit of some kind of a sensation christ is a person certainly and he's the word and if he's in there he always makes his work work just exactly the way it's supposed to when you turn it down how can it be christmas [Music] you are weary jesus christ identified among him proving that that same spirit he said in the days when the son of man will be revealed he's the same yesterday the very same jesus if set with dirty feet would he back up a hypocrite would he back up somebody didn't know his word that's identification that does owe the word i'm telling you true don't pass it [Music] here you are weary come home god have mercy have mercy can't you feel that breathing asleep tenderly jesus is calling all thee [Music] great stand [Music] jesus [Music] smoking's not a sin drink is not a sin cursing is not a sin committing adultery is not a sin no that's attributes of unbelief you do that because you're not believing there's only two one you are a believer or you're not a leader if you're not a believer no matter how religious you are you're still a sinner you're still a sinner if you don't accept every order that bible every word or both heavens and earth will pass away but not one child or one title [Music] you say well i belong to church my people i don't matter how to do this i don't care what you've done you're either a believer or a sinner that's pretty strong but i'm just saying this because the same one that knows the hearts of it is telling me to say it are you finished i see two more coming i'm just waiting because i don't know it might be somebody else just one moment why don't you come get in while the water's trouble now be a great thing just in a few minutes back here come watch it raise up from there make your vow to god lord god forgive me for what i've done i promise you i've said i was a christian but lord there's something in me tells me i i i'm condemned right now in the presence of this one it's identifying himself as the lord jesus christ i'm condemned like my own heart and knowing that if you're making this so plain i'm condemned i'm going in to make this right right now i'll pledge about right here that from this night on i'll absolutely live for it why don't you do that all right wow if that's all now let's stand up for you out there [Music] i wish i could sing i'd like to sing that song forgive you lord [Music] i'll be yours your lord if i fall or if i fail [Music] and believe that you're anchored in christ and you're ready for the coming judgment and you'll be able that when the trumpet sounds there won't be one thing to do and be caught away it'll be done so quick you won't have time to do anything else in a moment in a twinkling of an eye what would it be one of these days whatever you missed [Music] forever for eternity forever ever ever what will this little time of worldly pleasure mean [Music] nothing now i think we all are to dedicate our lives out here to christ don't you think so i may like to rededicate your lives upon this tonight i'll rededicate myself right now lord now think of what the what you're besetting sin is and let's just raise our hands now to god each one in your own way remember he's omnipresent while he's maybe 1800 or 2000 praying in here there's millions of praying around the world at the same time and he hears every one of them there's not even a sparrow can fall in the street but what he knows that he knows every secret of your heart let's all pray now in our own way let's dedicate ourselves to christ lord jesus uh uh your presence was so great just a few moments ago i could hardly even catch my breath seem like it i was going to leave and i know that there's some reason that you want this done this way i i don't understand it but you do lord your god but you've clearly identified yourself you're here we believe you we know you're here and here in the building is hundreds of hands up we're dedicating ourself a new lord upon this pulpit where i've preached and seen you stand here identifying yourself this week um i reconsecrate myself i dedicate myself a new to your service forgive me of all my complaints about being tired and and oh god just
