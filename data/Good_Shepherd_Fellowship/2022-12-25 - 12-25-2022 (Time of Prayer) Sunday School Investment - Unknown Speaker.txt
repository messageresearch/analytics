TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign come to change his Creed then that's for the turtle come I wonder if the same God isn't just as able today to rise itself in Isaiah rise us up somebody that can tell us that our solemn Feast becomes esteem we should be ready for the Rapture at this time of the age look where we're at something needed I'm not back to the word we're promised over in Malachi that we would be brought back to the word there is no faith and so let's remember that now but the the price that this young fellow was asked to pay was too great he had to sell out all of his worldly possessions in order to have this eternal life you might not have a dime but yet you do hold things that it's worldly possession for instance I've been balling our women out so much about bobbing their hair and wearing sexy dresses and things how can you dance in the spirit and call yourself Pentecost and live with such a spirit is that on you how can you man call yourself rulers of your home and permit such I want you to take inventory you know it's the truth and there you are see you're asked to sacrifice you say wait a minute brother Branham I'm an American citizen I'm pentecostalam I belong to the assemblies or the the other groups of water is I have American right for this and being a Christian I have a right because I accept the sacrifice that's what's a matter with America that's where she's in the twist today Every Nation wants a messiah and when God sent Israel a messiah there's all prayed for a messiah in the days of the coming of the Messiah Israel wanted a general that would come out and stop room to another country at the same time Rome wanted a messiah that would come and make him a new a great military regime that would would take Egypt and all the rest of the Nations and sought them out each one wanted a messiah and today we find the same thing uh Europe well for instance Russia they want a messiah that can take him to the Moon before everybody else gets there India's wanting a messiah and they won't want to feed him without working for it America what's that they want an intellectual genius they've got a crooked vote machine to give him one God always lets you have your desires of your heart now you got it what are you gonna do with it when all of them is crying for a messiah God sent him on but one morning General one want to uh an educated machine and also forth but God sent him a baby he sent him a savior he know they needed a savior what a fresh you got their Messiah today what would we do see God knows how to give it what if people of age that's praying for a messiah and we're praying for a great something to happen we are with Pentecostals are praying for a great stuff to happen I wonder what would take place if it really happened and maybe he answers your prayer and you don't know it and you wouldn't receive it if he answered it it wouldn't come in the color that she prayed for that's what they've always done and if they come again it would come in the same color it would come in the same package to roll the top of it therefore God deals with an individual he didn't deal with all Israel there today don't whatever's deal with this Jewish boy see it doesn't come in the way that we want it to come now this Jew had seen something uh it was different That's What attracted his heart there was something that he had he had seen that was in Jesus that other man didn't have he noticed priests and his rabbis didn't have the thing that this that this young fella had called Jesus who the people believed to be a prophet he was a different man that serious Rabbi stand up and the Pharisees argue their idea that there was Angel in spirit and the Sadducees come around and prove there is no angel in spirit and they had their differences caught in between that verse the church is caught today does it take denominational groups does it take a group of man does it take a group of women it takes one person's surrender to God to his work Jesus Christ was God made flesh in order to die that the word he in the word was the same the word could just flow through him there's no doubt at all God's trying to get somebody through the sanctifying power of Christ to yield to that word that he and the word can become one again then he can use his word to that person but you see this this young fellow saw something in this man that was different from other man you know there was different because one time it was asked this man don't speak like ordinary man There's Something About This fellas different never a man speak like this because when he spoke God was there to answer what he's saying as I've said many times this week man is still man they're praising God for what he did looking forward to what he is doing going to do that's us but you're ignoring what he's done always man does that Jesus said you claim to be the the children of the prophets and you're the one put him in the grave and you garnish your tombs see we're thinking what God did the only day of Pentecost and through the early age and then we're saying God's going to come with a great something and the first thing you know Pastor I spine will never know it history always proves itself right and it repeats itself we pass Let It Go Right by and don't notice it now this young man had seen something different he seen that there was a difference in this Jesus he wasn't like ordinary man you've seen what that man could do that God was with him he saw that his life though it was contrary to his own church teaching but he saw that man that God was with him like Peter said enter on the day of Pentecost he said uh I believe it was in Acts the third chapter he said amen of Israel Jesus of Nazareth a man proved of God a lot of Miracles and signs that he did the year with Wicked hands is indicting that generation for rejecting him you're the wicked hands have crucified the Prince of Life now we find out now that we are coming in our age and any Bible teacher knows that the last age of Pentecost is Lady ausia Leo seal means woman and the Greek time that when women take over I've got nothing against women as long as they stay in their place if God could have given a man anything better you better give it to him but when she gets out of the place she's watering his blood Solomon said so he's the wisest we ever had but it it's women in politics didn't 25 years ago the lord gave me a vision showing that the women through permitting the bull were to elect elect this Ricky we got up here now a modern Ahab sitting there with Jezebel turning his neck and you women fashion yourself at the same way she's a model of the world there's a lot of similarity to to Israel you know they come in and Tuck a land and drove out the occupants and set up their own uh system there and and that's the same way America did drove back the Indians and set up our system Israel had a great uh man among them they had like Solomon and David and great warriors we had great men Washington and Lincoln but finally there comes something to the throne that through politics is brought in there and it wasn't a Abby is a pretty good guy himself but that woman behind him you know the Bible speaks that same thing in the last day here and you loving your political you Democrats loving your political stand more than you did your Bible and God and you elected that I'm not a republican I'm a Christian Hallelujah I'm here for one thing talk about selling birth rights we have did it right that's right certainly you have and now you've got it what are you going to do with it you had to do it to fulfill this scripture and the people seen that now notice now the rich Lady of sin Church Jesus reveals in Revelation 3. uh gives this age this lady of seeing Pentecostal age the same opportunity this rich man did the same one caused lay your sin knocked at the door showed that our organized life had put Christ outside because Christ is the word in the beginning was the word and the words with God and the Word was God and the word still God and the Lord was put outside for our organizational system that's why I'm here with these businessmen God help him if they'll never organize but you're not far from it you just remember that I love you and you're giving me a spot this has been a place for my Ministry but I foresee it coming the handwriting's on the wall now don't do that you'll take the same chaos the rest of them did the devil's been trying to kill your leader for a long time if you can get rid of him something will take place it's just man they have to have their own ideas of it you put a charter you're not long ago in your paper should have done that that identifies you as an organization we we're a group of Brethren who don't matter what the man believes we're fellowshipping trying to get him let your light shine they'll see the light Hudson Taylor said not long ago that there was a missionary boy come said and India said Mr Taylor I have just received Christ he said Shaw go down and get my bachelor of Art and so forth and train he said no I'll go testify so I think that's a good idea see we're trying to see if you do your wide yourself right into something you get off out here you get a lot of educational programming it takes God right out of it when you get glamor God don't like glamor Hollywood's full of Glamor Hollywood shines the gospel glows there's a lot of difference between shining and glowing [Applause] Hollywood signs with lights and class and the gospel glows in humility quite a difference see now you remember that my brethren and my sisters don't don't shine glow now we find this young fella given this opportunity to do this and he he turned it away because there was too much of a prize to it and I think that's the same thing today we we don't want to we don't want to admit now we don't want to say that we don't but our lives are proven it's proven it it's exactly right but the the lady you'll see putting out of the church that he was knocking on see trying to get back in and Leo seal putting out because that they they were rich they had need of nothing they were just as uh just as uh rich as they could be and so they said we are rich we have need of nothing and God said you are naked poor miserable blind don't know it that's a trouble when they don't know it if a man's eye on the street in that condition naked and blind well most anyone had a human heart would go to that man say Sir you're naked you're out you're you're exposed and you come on in but if a man turn around said yeah you turn into your own business right now what are you gonna do for that fella and you're one of the church thinks that it's so it's so cold and it's it is and it's self-righteousness I'm telling you you're thinking you've got to bring in the word you say let's contrary to our Creed what are you sold out man your birth rights yes yes one instead of being glamor we ought to be glowing instead of having 500 or 600 of what it is you're at a breakfast that's all right I have nothing against it I I'm just hearing the name of the Lord Jesus instead of that there ought to be a glowing Among Us so the Holy Spirit maybe it's only a dozen glowing in the beauty of the Lord the Lord Jesus to be so up honest until the glory of the Lord would be in US but we want to shine more members see the church has always counted membership God counts character not membership as I said this week elaesar has sweated it up trying to find character and when he found Rebecca then he had an awful time maker stand still until he could get her dressed that's the same thing it is with the church we find the character in the Pentecostal church but to get her dressed and you go to say something about it then everybody rise up we won't have him no more we don't have this thing you find what you got character to work on but then you you can't make them stand still long enough bring him back to where they once fell from you Pentecostal Church come right out of denominationalism that's why God brought you out for was to be his church what did you do you turned right back around went right back in the thing you come out of like a dog to its vomit and it hog to its Waller the people did the same thing and now there's not much difference in you playing oh I hope you don't think that I'm trying to be mean a rude I'm only sent here my days may be few I'm standing in the name of the Lord Jesus to tell you what's the truth you mark my words if they don't come to pass you're trying to shine Stop It Go Now Rich the lady Arceus church has done the same thing that the rich wrong ruler did because the price was too great he just couldn't accept the word of the Lord what for him to do he would rather take his way uh with the glamor of the day because he had plenty of money and he could go out in the societies of of the other people and live up his time well that's about the way we've gotten we could be an organization like the rest of them and Pentecost is not an organization it's an experience we can be this other we're just like the rest of them you get more members but what have you got when he got him see mustn't do that that's wrong what do you do when you're doing the same rational mistake of this young rich man did see yes they put him out because of their love of the world now let us uh investigate uh some of these people uh back there and what they did let's look at the where we're at today I know of someone said not all goes I told you what uh you've been a preacher while you're around them businessman I told him I was a Assurance salesman of eternal life so uh there is and that's what Jesus was tying this young man had seen something any now that was different and he knowed he had eternal life so instead of going to his Rabbi he come to that person that he's seen was exactly God's Vindicated word God in Christ was the same because Christ said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father and as I preached or at the central families or the first family of the night how God's great nature projected Jesus see all the rest of nature was Fallen he couldn't take a profit because he was born to sexual desire and it's a fallen nature but God in his love projected one without sin and therefore this one was so perfect with the father just a body that was your call the son that the word was him John explains it in the first chapter in the beginning was the word the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh see uh we now the word of the Lord came to the prophets but Jesus was different from that he was the word the prophet only could say what uh what was put in his mouth to Satan but Jesus was that word at the entire word of God could flow through him without any he could create stop the winds and the ways and what more because it was God always in the word now God's trying to find a church that he can project his word through you see God watches over his word to to to vindicate it and how can he vindicate it when we deny that it's the truth right so these priests with their word though in their own way of thinking they were exactly right Pharisees Sadducees erodians whatever they were it's come to that time again each one in his own thinking they just do what's right like it was the day of judges but there's an ultimate somewhere and that ultimate is God's word because he wants the word now we find that they love these things better than they love God the Bible said they would now we're living in that day now if a prophecy said a certain thing we see it happening then we we got to know where our mistake is we got to know where we got to bypass now the Book of Revelations a third chapter teaches this that we would be in this age and here we are now how about some of those if we had time to stay on this long time but let's hurry to get through cause power to been gone an hour ago but look here this is first of course the word of God now let us examine some of the policy holders of this eternal life and see what it costs them holders of the Eternal Word uh brother Brandon you said Eternal Word yes sir Eternal never did begin Eternal has no end and a word is a thought expressed that was God's thinking before there was a world or Star a moon or anything that was God's thinking what he would do and when he spoke the word it's eternal because he can produce nothing but something Eternal that's the only way we have eternal life is when we get rid of this perverted life and get eternal life that's God Zoe the word right in you and then the word comes right through you and manifests itself and that's what this Rich fellow seen at this Jesus could stand there and he identified the scriptures Jesus said himself if I do not to work for my father then don't believe me search the scriptures free and then you think you have eternal life and there they want to say who I am they're the one testifying me see but they had it so created up like we have today until they couldn't see it now watch Noah was called by the word of God and he took out an investment in God God's Word of Promise he purposed no matter how how bad it looked and how much the rest of the world didn't believe it nor made that investment he invested in God though it was contrary to science we could stay there a long time nor would any more priests on the countdown Sunday afternoon see where we're living all right notice it was contrary to their religious belief it was contrary in the scientific research of that day that there was any rain in the skies it never had rain so therefore he had to take a stand and to make an investment and he did so in the promise of God Satan Tried Him in every way that he could yet he held on to his investment and it paid off at the end time by Saving his life now businessman what better investment could you make in that at the end time where we are and even science itself now comes around is with us and tells us to just try to midnight hours fixing to strike and what goods are big things going to do what goods are great denomination a million more and so forth like this and build them like that when eternal life is waiting out yonder and we have the opportunity and we're invited to receive this Christ uh God could take you and position you in his word in such a place that when you speak the things that that it's foresaw and foretold and so forth could work right through you every time exactly right never fails can't fail well you say I've seen I tried yes I know and you see it fail for his impersonation but when you see something genuine it cannot be of course it's gone and God sets these things for an example that others might see how do you say how does it come but all night fasting that's good all night prayer meeting is still good but obedience to the words where it comes obeying the word amen all right all right it paid off for saving his life let's us investigate another investment that a man by the name of Daniel he knowed he was going to church was going down amongst worldly people so he know that the whole thing would turn that way that's exactly what we see now Pentecost has got on amongst the world singing a brother Glover sitting here um I believe he's with the four square people and um I was talking one day with brother shakaran and uh that a noble person uh brother uh McPherson brother Roth McPherson we were setting in and they were talking I went over to somebody's place that had been associated in some kind of a Latter-Day rain or something and one of the teachers was abraiding me about it why did I come to the temple first and then later on or keep waiting I said well I just remember that the Lutheran was a lot of rain to the Catholic and Wesley was a lot of rain to the Luther and Pentecost was a ladder rain to the Wesley Miss McPherson was a lot of rain to the Pentecost it's all later Rings curing is hungry if they can't find something to eat they'll eat in the garbage can but God will produce the food if they're just ready to take him and Mr McPherson that Noble lady raised up and she said that is true brother Branham she come from a good Pentecostal background she said I said to Roth as long here that our Temple is far got away from that something that Mrs McPherson was telling him about and they've got to making doctors and PhD and lld what is it but a bunch of a million dollars worth of sand and white elephant on their hand what you need is a return back to the principles and the sincerity of the Gospel back to the real Pentecostal things that produces twice in the life of Jesus that's right [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
