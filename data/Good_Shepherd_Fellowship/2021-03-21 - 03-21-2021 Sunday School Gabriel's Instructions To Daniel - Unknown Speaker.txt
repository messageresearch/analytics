========================================
[Music] morning but very glorious to be here so glad that we could get in today for this service and uh i've given out that i have a study now on this 70 weeks of daniel that ties in the rest of the message before i can go with the the seven seals which is seven seals seven flags seven trump is three wolves a woman in the sun casting out the red devils 144 000 sealed away all happens between this time and i thought i'd have to get this in first now it's hot we don't aim to stay too long just as as we can and this is the season usually off season that when people don't have church too often and especially all of them got air-conditioned rooms and so forth where it's comfortable we wish we had that but at this time we don't have it many of our forefathers set out in a hot sun when i think of apologizing to the people for not having our air-conditioned room my thoughts always drift back to africa where they laid there in those storms and them women with their hair hanging down in their face lay there both day and night never leave the spot from where they're laying don't eat drink nor nothing stay right there just to catch a word or two now i name of the lord i can think of mexico when it's so hot but honestly i sat in an air conditioned room and tried to fan myself it was a hot and see them people come there at nine o'clock in the morning in that big arena and no seats to sit down sick people real sick dying sick cancer tumor sick mothers little dying babies and everything stand right down that barling hot sun not a shade nowhere and just lean against one another from nine o'clock at morning till nine that night just to hear 30 minutes to an interpreter and see the works of the lord set their weight big old heavy garments only wear them winter in summer it's all they got and then i think of laying out there in those jungles how they'd bring those sick people in it couldn't even move in an india one that piled one down then lay one on top of that and one on top of that one like that with leprosy and diseases where they drag them through and out of the streets and lay them in that hot barley tropical suns and the storms and lightning of flashing and things like that they'd lay right there in that sun and storm and everything and never move or complain just to try to catch a word of god now and man something for their soul and why should we apologize this morning with a roof over our heads fans are going we should be ashamed if we complain about it amen so i remember not long ago in an island one of the islands out in the south seas i was having a service there that night and oh i'd come up a storm oh i never seen such a storm this one flash of lightning after the other uh lighten up the country and how the winds are blowing until the trees was laying right on the ground i said well there i might as well take off my suit because there'll be nobody down there in a few moments the little car backed up the door and someone knocked at the door ready to go and i said to the boy you can speak english i said anybody down there said you can't even get within city blocks of the place i'm on a big ball park and i said do you mean that the people are are out there like that i said all this storm they said they want to hear about god and so uh i went down there and there were ladies young girls teenagers not sniggering life and popping chewing gum talking about their boyfriend every word they just lay on to it never move just sit and listen make an old recall make this on all our call and thousands raised with tears streaking out of their eyes like that with their hands up to god wanting mercy for their soul young girls and boys 17 18 years old now it's kind of hard to get the old folks to even listen you see it's it's uh shows that we haven't got nothing to complain about thanks be to god yes sir we'd like to have it all modern like the rest of america but we haven't got it that way so we'll just make out what we got amen now i got a little thing that i noticed that i'd like to do here in the tabernacle again how many's got bibles raise your hand good let's turn to psalms 99 before we have prayer we used to do this brother neville years ago i don't know have you already read a psalm this morning i'd just like to the congregation to read some of the psalms this morning when i was sitting in my study room meditating on this message and word i thought you know it'd be good again to have i'm all to read a psalm i like it so well the reason i was just a little late a long distance called them in cheyenne so that's reason i was and now while we're turning to this psalm i have some announcements to be made it would just give me that psalms 99. from it's all announcements concerning meetings here at the tabernacle and in the campaigns will come from the office at jeffersonville anyone desiring to know of the meetings must file out or give their name and address and lay it on the pulpit at the close of the service tonight a notice will be sent to you in time for you to make arrangements for to attend the meetings that is if anybody in the future wants to know just where we're going to have meetings we have a system set up at the office out there now that you can just lay your name and address here and we'll send you a card ahead of time so that you'll know where the meetings are going on and probably the subjects and what more there is if you could get a chance you see if you don't have some official place it comes from one says this and one says that you you don't get it you see so just let make out your name and address and lay it up here and billy paul will pick it up and we'll give it out now it was asked also if there will be any more brother brain would have any more healing services in the tabernacle with discernments no know that discernments will be given by by our other board we have a brother neville here now who has a gift of prophecy that prophesies over the sick and makes known to them the things that they have need of knowing and we have a brother by the name of hick higginbotham one of the was a trustee served faithy on the border don't see him this morning but he usually has a gift of speaking in tongues and a little lady named oregon bride lovely little sister who has a gift of interpretation of tongues and these messages are proving out to be of god because they are actually not not coming out of order they're just set in order and soon as these gifts begin to accumulate we're going to try to to get the to get it set right back into the church way of doing it and i'm to see them pretty soon and uh so that the at the the meetings will be carried on just perfectly in the order of the lord as we can get it perfectly but these dear people so says my neighbor mrs woods who has a microphone hooked up here and a tape back there to take the meetings just purposely to get those messages and write them down and see whether they are right or not that's how she's checking them i know mrs woods to be an honest woman and she's telling me of many things that's been said are coming to pass now so we're grateful for that what a relief that is for me at home when i come in home then that discernment on the prophetic side just tears me down and therefore god has sent me some relief for that through a prophecy and speaking in films and interpretation which is prophecy which is prophecy to speak in tongues as two different people prophesying one speaking the other understanding what the ones saying in unknown tongues is exactly prophecy and now we'll be we have that every day every meeting here when we have our prayer lines in the meeting now that someone then would ask did about the gift yes i still haven't but that only way i use it is on private uh interviews which i have and to obtain them i believe the god on the bulletin board back there to get permission and set your time in order by billy paul my boy for here are in the meetings after this out in the fields anywhere you must have a little card that billy paul will give you if there's something in life that you cannot understand and don't know how to get out of it and you're seeking the wisdom of the lord then let see billy paul my son which is the secretary and he will give you a little card and set you a date at a time and then when we're having those interviews then that will be when we'll go in together just you and i and if it's women coming you'll go with me and my wife and then you we will find out and seek the lord and ask him what must you do now other minor cases and so forth like that is given over to brother neville and brother higginbottom and sister oregon bride and the others who speaks with tongues and interprets which is here in the church therefore we're like the journey i believe with jethro said to moses one day let's take some elders and the spirit of god was taken off of moses and put on 70 of the elders and they prophesied but just the major and hard things come to moses alone now we're not moses neither are these the elders but we're still serving the jehovah god with the same pillar of fire leading us to the promised land hallelujah so then yes there will be other uh be meetings and will be the interpretation the discernments will come that will be giving me a chance then to be in prayer and study the days that i know that these interviews will come and be ready for them i remember billy paul branham our field secretary will it's all bulletin is on the board back there by the trustees i've got a note here to announce that and to tell the people they might read it on the bulletin board going out now now this morning we have a great lesson and tonight we'll try to continue on at the lord willing next sunday another into it i didn't know how deep it was getting until i got to studying and still it's a mystery to me yet so i'm just depending on the lord now you with your bibles let's turn to psalms 90 and 9 99 and i will read the first verse the congregation read the second verse then all together we'll read the last verse we'll continue on me the first congregation ii be the third congregation forth on to the last verse and then we'll all read it together shall we stand as we read the word of [Music] god the lord reigneth let the people tremble he set up between the cherubians let the earth be moved is great and he is high above all the people let them praise thy great and terrible name for it is holy [Music] exalt ye the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he is holy and samuel among them [Music] he spake unto them in the cloudy pillar they kept his testimonies and the ordinances that he gave them the lord our god and worship his holy heal for the lord our god is holy let us bow our heads truly lord these words are written and pinned by thy servant david in a psalm unto thee thou dost dwell between the turbans lord holy and thy hill is holy let us draw nigh with our hearts sprinkled with the blood of the lord jesus with a pure conscience i am with faith and assurance that we are coming into the presence of our god let all this audience this morning be reverent open up our ears of understanding speak through us in wisdom that we might know how we must behave ourselves in these days and in thy presence we would ask the our god to reveal to us these secret things that's been hit all these years as we are approaching one of the most sincere solemn words thou did speak of it when you were here on earth and said he that readeth let him understand so we most graciously come to the lord and seek thy wisdom not knowing just what to say set an order here a few scriptures and solemnly and holy depending upon thee for the answer for no other purpose but that we might know the hour that we're living that we might be prepared for the great things that lies ahead [Music] won't you grant it to us lord in the name of him who taught us all that we should pray like this our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen be seated [Music] now if any other man wants to remove their coats just feel welcome and those who are standing around the sides of the wall if your feet gets achy why just feel at liberty to move out now i think if the children wants to go to their rooms or have they already been dismissed hey we can't have them this morning the pastor says that the crowd is got the rooms packed up so we cannot have sunday school for the little ones we would be happy if you little fellows now would cooperate with us as this morning we are having starting a great tremendous message that i'm sure that will mean a great deal to your father and mother and your loved ones that sharing even to you little ones so we approach it very reverently if the lord willing this morning uh we're taking the subject of daniel's 70 of weeks and this morning we're speaking on daniel in captivity and gabriel flying in to instruct him about the future while daniel was in prayer the gabriel the angel come in to instruct him tonight i want to speak on the six-fold purpose of his visit six different subjects to be brought in tonight what gabriel come from next sunday the lord willing i want to place the reason and the time of the seven church ages and what time they are and where we are standing today amen that's all next sunday morning the lord willing amen now the reason for this i brought down some little notes from my last few messages and this morning i want to laugh over because this is on magnetic tape that will go all over the world many nations and always the reason i laugh it back is perhaps someone would hear the tape for their first time and would not be able to understand what i was meaning when i refer back to something else we have been now for months in the study of the book of revelations the revelation of jesus christ we have come through the church ages the first three chapters of revelations was the church ages then john was caught up in the fourth and fifth chapter and was shown things that that was to be here after now on the sixth chapter he drops down into the earth again to see things taking place that will go from the sixth chapter the first verse until the 19th chapter and the 21st verse in here comes in the seals the plagues the woes the locuses the the woman and the sun and the casting out of the red dragon the sealing away the hundred and forty four thousand and all these things this has been a week of tremendous study yesterday all day i hardly moved from the room trying to study and it's something in the last time and many of the old timers sure that i taught i just said in here belongs the 70 weeks of daniel but i did not try to attack him to explain it but this time by the grace of god i have taken up all myself to try to ask grace before god that i might bring it to the people and in here i'm finding things that i do not know one thing about and then i have been reading dr larkin's book dr smith's book dr scofield's notes different commentaries from man everywhere and yet i cannot put theirs together to make it come out right see so this week i'm planning on been visiting the library in kentucky on some of the ancient astronomy of the calendars and times and picking up from the libraries and so forth all the ancient books that i can and to what little i can do and having my trust solemnly in jesus christ to reveal it to me because i do not want it to say i know this and i know that he knows my heart he's listening at me but i wanted that i might enlighten his people therefore i believe that he will give it to me i do not know as yet but i'm trusting him for next sunday because that will be the tremendous part as next sunday to know and play so seventy weeks each one has a different place and when you do you go to run them all through they don't come out right they don't register upright it can and therefore i i may not be able to have it right but i'm going to trust the lord part and i remember of solomon one time praying and asking the lord god if he would give him wisdom not for himself no extension of days no longer life not riches but if he might have wisdom to know how to to to judge god's people and god honored that prayer and gave solomon that wisdom because it was for his people and that's why i'm asking god to let me know what these 70 of weeks mean because i know it's the exact calendar for the age we're living in amen and therefore i want to know it not for myself i'm not for myself of course i want to know it i don't say it that way not for myself because i do want it for myself i want to know because i want to know where we're living and what time we're living in and then i know that that was given and different ones has figured it out and they've had it way back one thought i was reading had it all ended up in 19 and 19 of the 70th weeks well that wasn't so after 70 of weeks after 78 weeks it's all finished so we uh we don't we want to know the truth and i'm asking god to give me the truth yes amen now in order to back this up go back i want to rehearse a little bit of the back so therefore some notes that i jotted down that we had in the fifth the fourth and fifth chapter so that the people will understand first before we do this i want to laugh it over so that you'll get from the fourth now remember the third chapter was the lady of seeing church age and the church was taken up at the end of lady osea now i was trying to explain something to my wife about it i had becky my daughter with all the different types of dictionaries and things that we could get they don't give the answer i got the bible dictionary i got the old greek dictionary i i got the uh the webster's and many others the modern dictionaries none of them could get them anyway my wife said how do you expect our people which are poor people and many of them uneducated like we are to understand such as that i said god will give me anything amen no matter how complicated it is god can break it down make it simple amen for we are the a potion of those people who are longing hallelujah praying for that day in that hour and our eyes are set towards heaven and we're watching for his coming i like to stop just a second to say that many peoples who are expecting some great tremendous powerful something to happen in the gentile age are certainly wrong the church age and all that will happen during the gentile reign is recorded from revelations 1 to revelations 3 inclusive then the church was raptured and taken up and the rest of this until the 19th chapter is what happens to the jewish race after the church has gone up and it is the time of the great tribulation nothing to happen amongst the gentiles only the slaughtering and so forth as we'll get to that and see but the church itself has gone on the 13th on the last verse of the third chapter of revelations when the ladies in church age end which was the last and we took each church age each time each thing that happened each star each messenger their nature what they've done and brought it right down through history until the very last one draws out there on the picture on the side of the wall and when we got finished the holy spirit come in and made a circle of the same thing on the wall and revealed it by himself right here to all of us now in doing this i trust at the end of this he'll come with a tremendous something and show us again that we are at the end time how many of you heard kennedy's president kennedy's speech the comments and so forth i mean he heard this prediction that by january the 1st has predicted that both the united states and russia will be volcanic ashes that's all we need it's later than we are thinking so if we are so near to even man on this earth are predicting this tremendous thing to happen we better be on the alert everything right up the date all confessions made everything ready because we don't know just what time our lord's going to summon us and when he gives us summons come up higher you better be ready and it's going to come in hour that you think not the great pentecostal revival is now ceasing we see it everywhere last great move and messages went forth everything's ready now waiting the church is sealed away the wicked are doing more wicked churches are becoming more churchy the saints are coming closer to god the gifts of the spirit begin to multiply in the little groups we're at the end time [Music] oh i love that song that we used to sing in the church i'm watching for the coming of that glad millennium day when our blessed lord shall come and catch his waiting right away oh my heart is crying thirsting for that day of sweet release when our savior shall come back to earth again [Music] hallelujah you
