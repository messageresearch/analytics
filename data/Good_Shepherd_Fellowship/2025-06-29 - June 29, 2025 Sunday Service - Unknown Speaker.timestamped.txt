[1:00:55] Heavenly Father, we want to thank you
[1:00:58] this morning for giving us another
[1:01:00] opportunity to be in your house. We want
[1:01:03] to thank you Lord God for your wonderful
[1:01:06] blessings of protection upon us. I pray
[1:01:10] to God this morning and your grace will
[1:01:12] just uh come and bless us Lord Father.
[1:01:16] What a wonderful savior you are. To you
[1:01:19] be the praise, to you be the glory and
[1:01:21] honor. Thank you for your people. And
[1:01:24] Lord, those that are streaming in with
[1:01:25] us this morning, we want to also ask
[1:01:27] that you bless them. In Jesus name we
[1:01:30] pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you.
[1:01:33] You may have your seat.
[1:01:36] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:01:39] Sorry for coming in late this morning. I
[1:01:42] was uh
[1:01:44] I had to be on
[1:01:46] uh an international conference uh call
[1:01:51] this morning on a situation.
[1:01:54] So it threw me back in my time and then
[1:01:58] uh uh
[1:02:01] so I'm very sorry for that.
[1:02:04] Uh but it's good to be in the house of
[1:02:06] the Lord this morning. is something
[1:02:08] there where I I needed to take care of
[1:02:10] and uh it concerned me, it concerned us
[1:02:14] a little bit. Not a bad thing, could
[1:02:18] turn out to be good. So, we want to
[1:02:20] thank the Lord for them. Amen.
[1:02:24] And uh so we we bring greetings uh from
[1:02:28] our campus, the God of Cameron save.
[1:02:30] Amen. We had we had a good time uh uh
[1:02:36] Friday. It was it was uh it was fun
[1:02:40] hanging out with the young people. So uh
[1:02:43] we met many friends on the campground.
[1:02:45] They all send their greetings and uh so
[1:02:48] uh we prayed and look forward to their
[1:02:53] testimony. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:59] And uh uh we were
[1:03:04] like we said the other day, we were
[1:03:05] awaiting u a letter from the city uh to
[1:03:10] see if they will have given us the
[1:03:12] permit that we needed for whatever we
[1:03:14] wanted to do back here. But we were not
[1:03:17] uh given the permit. We are not allowed
[1:03:19] to. The reason is because our building
[1:03:22] is is grandfather in. So anything that
[1:03:26] we want to do on the property will now
[1:03:29] have us to change the entire building
[1:03:32] because of the building codes and
[1:03:33] regulation. So we have to look into
[1:03:36] something else and we we hope that uh uh
[1:03:39] the Lord will give us uh some some form
[1:03:42] of inspiration to be able to do that.
[1:03:45] Praise the Lord. I kept you waiting long
[1:03:48] so I won't keep you in any anymore. So
[1:03:50] let's go to Psalm chapter 22. Thank you
[1:03:53] sister Naomi. Thank you, Sister Joy.
[1:03:56] Praise the Lord. Brother Era is away for
[1:03:59] the wedding and uh uh
[1:04:04] so
[1:04:12] he called in last night and and asked
[1:04:16] that we we greet the church also for
[1:04:18] him. So,
[1:04:20] praise the Lord.
[1:04:24] Psalm chapter 22.
[1:04:28] Psalm chapter 22.
[1:04:33] Don't worry, sister Annette. Uh I will
[1:04:35] be able to manage what I have. Amen.
[1:04:39] I I free you from uh
[1:04:42] back there. So just uh
[1:04:49] Psalm chapter 22.
[1:04:54] We read from uh uh verse one.
[1:05:02] My God, my God, what have thou forsaken
[1:05:05] me? Why art thou so far from helping me?
[1:05:10] and from the words of my rolling. Oh my
[1:05:13] God, I cried in the daytime, but thou
[1:05:17] yareth me not, and in the night season,
[1:05:21] and I am not silent, but thou are holy,
[1:05:25] oh thou that inhabited the praises of
[1:05:29] Israel.
[1:05:31] Amen.
[1:05:32] Our fathers trusted in thee, they
[1:05:35] trusted, and thou did they deliver them.
[1:05:38] They cried unto thee and were delivered.
[1:05:43] They trusted in thee and were not
[1:05:45] confounded.
[1:05:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:50] But I but I am a worm and no man, a
[1:05:54] reproach of man and despise of the
[1:05:57] people. All they that see me laughed me
[1:06:01] into scone.
[1:06:03] They shoot out the the lips and and
[1:06:06] shake their heads, saying, he trusted on
[1:06:08] the Lord, that he will deliver him. Let
[1:06:12] him deliver him. See, he delighted in
[1:06:15] him.
[1:06:17] But thou are he that took me out of the
[1:06:20] womb. Thou did make me hope. When I was
[1:06:24] upon my mother breast, I was cast uh I
[1:06:30] was cast upon thee from the womb. Thou
[1:06:32] art my God from
[1:06:36] my mother's belly.
[1:06:39] Be be not far from me
[1:06:43] for trouble is near for there is no
[1:06:47] help. Praise the Lord. I will stop right
[1:06:51] here. We'll bow our heads and we will
[1:06:54] pray. Heavenly Father, in the name of
[1:06:56] the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray and that
[1:06:59] you will come, oh God, and and uh take
[1:07:02] over our fee, Lord Jesus. And once
[1:07:06] again, Father, Lord God, uh because of
[1:07:09] uh uh what we had to take care of this
[1:07:13] morning, Lord God, we came into the
[1:07:15] service late, but we pray that Lord
[1:07:17] Jesus, grace will cover our mistake,
[1:07:20] Lord, grace, Father, Lord, will be
[1:07:23] sufficient this morning and not to break
[1:07:25] our inspiration, Father Lord. But we
[1:07:28] will be able God to say something that
[1:07:31] Lord God of internal value, something
[1:07:34] that will draw your people closer to
[1:07:36] you. Once again, Father Lord, we just
[1:07:39] want to thank you, Lord God, even for
[1:07:41] those that are streaming in this
[1:07:43] morning. We thank you, Father Lord, for
[1:07:45] our few young folks that we left out
[1:07:47] there in Indiana. Give them a lifetime
[1:07:50] experience, Lord. Something that will
[1:07:52] draw them closer to you. Oh God, we pray
[1:07:55] this morning. Father remember us too as
[1:07:59] you are blessing your people in Jesus
[1:08:01] name we pray. Amen. Amen. The Lord bless
[1:08:06] you. You may have your seat. Go to be in
[1:08:08] the house of the Lord again. Praise the
[1:08:11] Lord.
[1:08:12] Amen.
[1:08:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:19] I read uh I read uh Psalm chapter 22
[1:08:22] this morning because I want to I want to
[1:08:24] use that to go into what I want to talk
[1:08:27] about this morning. And uh uh we know
[1:08:31] that Psalm 22 is a prophetic psalm and
[1:08:35] uh uh it's a prophetic psalm because
[1:08:39] there is a whole lot there in Psalm
[1:08:41] chapter 22. Good to see you, brother
[1:08:43] Wesley and sister Carol back there. And
[1:08:46] uh praise the Lord. We're glad that you
[1:08:49] could make it in.
[1:08:51] Amen. Praise the Lord. And uh uh you
[1:08:55] know, it's just it's just uh it's just
[1:08:57] something that uh uh when going to
[1:09:02] church is become is is part of your
[1:09:04] life, it's hard to stay away. Amen. And
[1:09:07] then when you take it out of your life,
[1:09:09] sometimes it hard to get back.
[1:09:12] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:15] I've seen people that have, you know,
[1:09:17] stayed away from the Lord, backslided.
[1:09:19] The Lord is dealing with their heart,
[1:09:21] but they just struggle to get back to
[1:09:23] church.
[1:09:25] Well, so let's just look into uh uh what
[1:09:28] we want to talk about this morning. And
[1:09:31] uh like I said, Psalm 22 is a prophetic
[1:09:34] psalm. And uh uh we see uh a whole lot
[1:09:38] in this psalm that uh look just like a
[1:09:42] direct voice of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:09:45] Amen. But we know that David was under
[1:09:48] inspiration just like we spoke on
[1:09:50] Wednesday night looking at Richard and
[1:09:53] uh and Leah uh uh taking the both of
[1:09:56] them in a type of uh the the seven
[1:10:00] gentile church ages and the seven Jewish
[1:10:04] church ages that is in a type and uh so
[1:10:08] uh uh and like I said most of these uh
[1:10:11] character they were living you know they
[1:10:13] were just living their own
[1:10:15] uh uh you know normal life and uh but
[1:10:19] yet God was writing out his word in uh
[1:10:23] you know uh in some of the things that
[1:10:26] they were dealing with. So uh uh the
[1:10:28] Lord the Lord uh uh used David here
[1:10:33] under inspiration David crying, you
[1:10:35] know, putting his heart out to God. But
[1:10:38] there there is a whole lot that is in
[1:10:40] this sermon and some of it we want to
[1:10:42] get to this to to this morning. So uh
[1:10:46] there was something that caught my
[1:10:48] attention and that's what I want to get
[1:10:50] to. Now you see David crying out here to
[1:10:53] the Lord. He trusted in the Lord that he
[1:10:55] would deliver him seeing that he had
[1:10:57] made the Lord his delight. And then uh
[1:11:01] uh he says I was cast out you know from
[1:11:03] the womb that are my God from the belly.
[1:11:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:09] Now when you go down,
[1:11:17] you go down into uh into the Psalm
[1:11:29] Psalm uh in verse 22.
[1:11:33] Verse 22.
[1:11:38] Now remember now David is under
[1:11:40] inspiration. He's saying all of these
[1:11:42] things and he says here verse 20 deliver
[1:11:46] my soul from the swore
[1:11:48] uh my darling from the power of the
[1:11:52] dogs. Save me from the lion's mouth.
[1:11:55] Thou for thou have heard me from the
[1:11:59] horns of the unicorn.
[1:12:03] I will declare thy name unto my
[1:12:07] brethrens.
[1:12:08] In the midst of the congregation
[1:12:12] will I praise thee.
[1:12:17] Ye that fear the Lord praise him. For
[1:12:20] all the seas of Jacob glorify him and
[1:12:24] fear him all ye the seas of Israel.
[1:12:27] Praise the Lord. You drop down to verse
[1:12:30] five uh 25. He he says something again.
[1:12:33] He says, "My praise shall be of thee in
[1:12:37] the great congregation.
[1:12:40] I will pay my vows before them that fear
[1:12:45] him." Praise the Lord.
[1:12:48] Now you see, so if if David under
[1:12:52] inspiration was prophesying
[1:12:56] not only of the death of Jesus, not only
[1:13:00] uh giving the Lord h a prophecy that he
[1:13:04] could hang on because brother Brandham
[1:13:06] says Jesus hang on Psalm uh uh 22 verse1
[1:13:11] my God my God why have thou forsaken me?
[1:13:14] He says in his greatest hour he uh uh
[1:13:17] that that that prayer of David you know
[1:13:20] reached out to him. Now so if if if
[1:13:23] there was a prophecy of his death now
[1:13:26] you you look here uh uh in verse uh uh
[1:13:30] 12 you see many bulls have compassed me
[1:13:33] strong bulls of bash have beset me. And
[1:13:37] uh you you will be thinking uh uh when
[1:13:40] you look actually in the death of Jesus
[1:13:43] Christ, you will realize that uh uh
[1:13:46] Psalm 22 really play out because when
[1:13:49] David is describing that he's not just
[1:13:52] only talking about uh you know uh a
[1:13:56] natural bulls, he's also talking about
[1:13:58] demon powers.
[1:14:02] Praise the Lord. He's talking about
[1:14:05] demon powers because if you go back and
[1:14:07] studied on bish the boos of bish you
[1:14:10] studed on bish you will know that uh uh
[1:14:13] that was an evil region.
[1:14:16] Now so there is like I said there is
[1:14:18] just a whole lot here. There is a whole
[1:14:21] lot. The last time we look at it you go
[1:14:23] back again to verse uh uh six. But I am
[1:14:27] a warm and no man. What was that? We
[1:14:30] look at that uh uh some time ago. Uh
[1:14:33] David David saying, "I'm a womb. I'm not
[1:14:35] a man." Praise the Lord.
[1:14:38] Uh uh uh a reproach of man and a despise
[1:14:42] of people. So when you look at where
[1:14:45] where the the scripture says, "Though
[1:14:47] your sins were as crimson, they will be
[1:14:50] white as snow." And and then you study
[1:14:52] this scripture right here, you'll
[1:14:54] realize what David meant because uh uh
[1:14:58] uh
[1:15:01] uh the the the crimson die was taken
[1:15:05] from uh the back of a tree that was
[1:15:08] caused by a worm.
[1:15:12] So uh uh so there is just a whole lot in
[1:15:15] here. But what caught my attention this
[1:15:17] morning or uh during the week that I
[1:15:20] want to drive to this morning is that in
[1:15:23] the same time he he make this
[1:15:25] declaration. I will declare thy name to
[1:15:28] my brethrens in the midst of the
[1:15:31] congregation I will praise thee.
[1:15:35] Praise the Lord. Amen. Now what I want
[1:15:38] to get to this morning by the help of
[1:15:40] the Lord if uh and trust that the Lord
[1:15:43] will be able to help. actually I had on
[1:15:45] my heart to preach on giving. I was
[1:15:48] going to speak on giving this morning
[1:15:51] and uh uh and then the uh I felt that
[1:15:56] the Lord started dealing with me on this
[1:15:58] and it it was just it was such a
[1:16:00] blessing to me and I want to share that
[1:16:01] with you. This is what I want to talk on
[1:16:04] before I give you my my title I want to
[1:16:06] talk on this morning is to help us to
[1:16:09] see that uh what we call the church.
[1:16:14] It's not an organization.
[1:16:16] Praise the Lord. The church is not an
[1:16:19] organization. It's not a denomination.
[1:16:22] But the church is an organized body.
[1:16:25] Amen. Is an organized body because it's
[1:16:28] governed by the word of God. Praise the
[1:16:31] Lord. But we want to look at the church
[1:16:34] from uh from the word of God. We want to
[1:16:37] look at the purpose of the church. Let
[1:16:39] me say it that way. We want to look at
[1:16:41] the purpose of the church because here
[1:16:45] is a prophecy, a psalm that holds the
[1:16:47] prophecy
[1:16:49] of uh uh uh of our Lord Jesus. And on
[1:16:54] this prophecy, David is also declaring
[1:16:58] something. I will make thy name known to
[1:17:01] my brethrens in the midst of the
[1:17:03] congregation.
[1:17:05] Praise the Lord. So we we we going to
[1:17:08] realize that uh God had
[1:17:13] uh h a h a serious purpose in his mind
[1:17:18] for giving us what is called the church.
[1:17:22] The church by definition is a call out
[1:17:25] people. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:28] We living in such a time where you know
[1:17:31] uh everybody have a right and uh we
[1:17:34] having Google we have in AI you know we
[1:17:37] can go and search we can go and define
[1:17:40] sometimes people gets to the place and
[1:17:42] then sometimes when they are caught in
[1:17:43] the in the complex of their of their
[1:17:46] errors you know they get to the place
[1:17:48] and they come up with their own
[1:17:49] definition of what they think God is and
[1:17:52] so that's the God I'm going to say
[1:17:54] because that's what he is. I heard a
[1:17:56] young man saying if God cannot accept me
[1:17:58] you know the way I am I cannot serve thy
[1:18:01] God. Praise the Lord. I believe he
[1:18:03] accept us the way we are but he don't
[1:18:05] want us to remain the way we are.
[1:18:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:12] He's going to accept you the way you
[1:18:14] are. And I hope you accept him the way
[1:18:16] he is.
[1:18:19] Praise the Lord. You see, so people just
[1:18:22] come up with all sorts of things, you
[1:18:23] know. Uh I mean the church the church is
[1:18:26] not a building. This truth is not a
[1:18:27] building. It's a mystical body. But what
[1:18:31] is the purpose of the church?
[1:18:36] What is the purpose?
[1:18:38] Because if we don't if we don't uh h be
[1:18:42] find that if we are not able to see that
[1:18:44] in the word you know what is going to
[1:18:47] happen? We're going to bring our
[1:18:49] culture.
[1:18:51] Praise the Lord. We're going to use our
[1:18:54] manner of life
[1:18:56] to define what the church supposed to
[1:18:58] be.
[1:19:02] Are we together?
[1:19:04] So I I I was I was thinking on that even
[1:19:07] though it's it's uh it's in line with
[1:19:09] what I wanted to talk about giving. You
[1:19:12] know, I I you know, I was just I was
[1:19:14] just going to give one word. I'm going
[1:19:15] to speak on giving this morning. And I
[1:19:18] know I know as I know exactly where
[1:19:21] people mind goes when you talk about
[1:19:23] giving.
[1:19:25] Okay. Says the the the pastor coming to
[1:19:27] church look in our pocket. It look like
[1:19:29] he broke these days.
[1:19:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:34] Amen. But if if uh if if we can if we
[1:19:38] can associate that with this, we will be
[1:19:39] able to do it. And and uh and it was it
[1:19:42] was study on that subject that this one
[1:19:45] came very real to me. So uh we want to
[1:19:48] look into that this morning. Now so the
[1:19:52] first time the word church was used, the
[1:19:55] first time the word church was used,
[1:19:58] Matthew chapter 16, upon this rock I
[1:20:02] will build my church. The first time
[1:20:05] Jesus was the one that used the word
[1:20:08] church.
[1:20:10] The first time church was used, you
[1:20:12] check in your in your Bible concordance,
[1:20:15] you will realize that he was the one
[1:20:17] that used the word church.
[1:20:20] Praise the Lord. Now, you see, God gave
[1:20:24] Israel
[1:20:26] uh uh uh you know uh keeping the Sabbath
[1:20:31] holy and uh and all all of all of the
[1:20:33] ordinance and and everything. You see,
[1:20:36] they they could do it. they they they
[1:20:38] could they could uh h keep those things
[1:20:41] and uh keep the ordinance of God and and
[1:20:44] and all of those things because they
[1:20:46] were living in a community.
[1:20:51] The people of God there in Egypt, they
[1:20:53] were in Genan was their place. They were
[1:20:57] living together. Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:01] So you see that uh uh this this is where
[1:21:05] I'm coming from and and uh uh and if I
[1:21:07] don't do if I don't if if I don't spit
[1:21:10] it out quickly I will keep going into
[1:21:12] cycle. I'm not a good speaker and uh uh
[1:21:15] but where I'm coming from is that God's
[1:21:18] purpose of the church
[1:21:21] is God's community.
[1:21:26] Amen. the purpose of the church. As we
[1:21:29] go into the scripture and then look into
[1:21:31] the message, you will you will pretty uh
[1:21:33] uh uh you will soon see that uh uh uh
[1:21:38] the church, the reason why
[1:21:43] we are called together, the reason why
[1:21:45] the Bible says forsake not the
[1:21:48] assembling of the sin. The reason why
[1:21:50] the uh uh uh you know we must we must
[1:21:55] have a place that we call church a place
[1:21:57] that we call our church our home is
[1:22:00] because that is the closest community of
[1:22:05] God you will have on earth.
[1:22:11] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:14] that is the closier community.
[1:22:17] The church in as much as uh uh uh uh we
[1:22:23] are different families and and you know
[1:22:25] coming from different backgrounds and
[1:22:27] different with all of our differences
[1:22:29] when we come under that headship
[1:22:32] to to believe that uh we are member of
[1:22:36] good sheeperd church. We call this place
[1:22:39] our church, good sheeperd fellowship or
[1:22:42] you know uh uh uh uh uh spoken word
[1:22:46] fellowship or whatever the church name
[1:22:48] is. If we we must realize that we have
[1:22:53] chosen that place to be our community
[1:22:57] and in every community there are uh uh
[1:23:01] laws rules that govern the community and
[1:23:04] I believe that's the work of the word of
[1:23:06] God. The word govern our community.
[1:23:09] Praise the Lord. Now, so you see it from
[1:23:12] that. Wake that young man up.
[1:23:16] Don't do that.
[1:23:18] Okay?
[1:23:21] If you are tired, you go outside and get
[1:23:24] water to drink.
[1:23:26] Now, if you if you if you if we look at
[1:23:29] it together, you will see uh what's
[1:23:31] going on. Now so uh uh uh honor this
[1:23:35] prophecy here David is saying I will
[1:23:38] declare my name thy name to my brethrens
[1:23:43] in in the midst of the congregation.
[1:23:46] Praise the Lord. Now you will find that
[1:23:50] a whole lot in the Old Testament
[1:23:52] congregation is used. Church was never
[1:23:55] used in the Old Testament. Like I said,
[1:23:58] Jesus was the first time. You check it
[1:24:01] out in your Bible, you will see the
[1:24:03] second time church was used, he used it
[1:24:06] again. And the time he use it, he use it
[1:24:09] under the discipline of the church.
[1:24:13] If a brother offend you, you go and meet
[1:24:16] him. If you can't reconcile him, call
[1:24:19] another person to go and meet. If you
[1:24:21] cannot reconcile, get a third person to
[1:24:24] go and meet. If he would not be
[1:24:26] reconciled, bring it to the church.
[1:24:30] Now I will be thinking in my mind these
[1:24:33] Jewish believers, what is he calling the
[1:24:35] church?
[1:24:37] Is said the the is said the name for our
[1:24:41] owner group different from the
[1:24:42] synagogues or different from uh uh uh
[1:24:45] the temple. Are we not calling it temple
[1:24:48] anymore?
[1:24:50] Praise the Lord. So he said if you would
[1:24:53] not be reconciled then bring it and come
[1:24:55] and tell it before the church.
[1:24:58] That is the second time church was used
[1:25:00] in scripture.
[1:25:02] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:08] Now I took all of your time this morning
[1:25:09] to be talking on the phone. So I have to
[1:25:12] go quickly. Let's go to Hebrew chapter
[1:25:15] 2.
[1:25:17] Hebrew chapter 2.
[1:25:28] Hebrew chapter 2.
[1:25:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:49] Now see how how how Paul is going to
[1:25:53] take uh David prophecy and make it more
[1:25:57] real to us. He's going to take David
[1:26:00] prophecy because being a prophet now you
[1:26:04] have to remember he was a student of the
[1:26:06] word when he met Jesus on the on on the
[1:26:09] road of Damascos. God dealt with him and
[1:26:12] and and uh and now he started looking.
[1:26:15] His own Bible became a new book. Amen.
[1:26:18] The Torah became a new book to Paul
[1:26:21] because he could see the revelation of
[1:26:24] what Moses spoke about or what the
[1:26:28] prophet spoke about. Are we together? So
[1:26:32] in in in Hebrew chapter 2, Paul is is is
[1:26:36] now going to establish how
[1:26:42] the God in Sundra times, the God that
[1:26:45] led our fathers by the pillar of fire
[1:26:50] that show himself to Manoah wife
[1:26:55] and there with all the kings and and uh
[1:26:58] uh David and the rest of them, this God
[1:27:02] has come to us in a form called the
[1:27:05] word. In this last day, he has revealed
[1:27:09] himself through his son. But now in
[1:27:12] chapter two, he's going to show how he
[1:27:16] even took a lower form. He make himself
[1:27:19] lower than angels.
[1:27:24] Are we together?
[1:27:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:28] How he make himself lower than angels?
[1:27:41] Are we together?
[1:27:43] Amen.
[1:27:46] Amen. There was something that was
[1:27:48] crossing my mind. That's what I stopped.
[1:27:50] And what what I was thinking about is
[1:27:52] that you know there was the difference
[1:27:53] that made the Pharisees and the
[1:27:54] Sadducees. The Pharisees believe in
[1:27:57] angels. The Sadducees do not believe in
[1:27:59] angels. And the Pharisees believe in
[1:28:01] resurrection. The s Sadducees do not
[1:28:04] believe in resurrection. Now, you have
[1:28:06] to realize that uh uh uh uh the Jews
[1:28:09] hold very very strong to these things.
[1:28:13] Now, so Paul, what he was going to do
[1:28:15] because he wrote the book of Hebrew was
[1:28:18] actually written to the Jewish church.
[1:28:21] Now, so what he's going to do, he's
[1:28:23] going to take their strong belief
[1:28:26] and he's going to show that in as much
[1:28:29] as it was good for us then, but God has
[1:28:33] something better in store.
[1:28:36] Amen. He had a better priesthood. He had
[1:28:39] a better sacrifice. He had a better
[1:28:42] temple. So you you go through the book
[1:28:44] of Hebrew, you see how Paul talking
[1:28:46] about a a priest who are better than the
[1:28:50] ironic priesthood. So he he's saying all
[1:28:53] of these things. Now just trying to give
[1:28:55] you a background so you can be able to
[1:28:57] grab this picture. So he talks about how
[1:29:00] this God uh uh uh uh uh made himself
[1:29:05] lower than an angel. Are we together?
[1:29:08] Amen.
[1:29:12] Let's go to verse four. That will give
[1:29:14] you a little picture and I hope I get
[1:29:17] time then I will come into what I want
[1:29:18] to share with you. God also bearing them
[1:29:21] witness both with signs and wonders and
[1:29:24] diverse miracle the gift of the Holy
[1:29:26] Ghost I call into his own will.
[1:29:30] For unto the For unto the angel
[1:29:35] have he put have he not put in
[1:29:38] suggestion the word to come whereof we
[1:29:42] speak now. So what he's doing now, he's
[1:29:45] trying to
[1:29:47] in as much as the Jewish church believe
[1:29:51] in angels, he's trying to make them to
[1:29:54] see that God did not commit his word,
[1:29:59] his creation unto angels.
[1:30:03] Are we together? Amen.
[1:30:08] But one in a certain place testify,
[1:30:11] saying, What is man that thou are
[1:30:15] mindful of him? Who was that one? David.
[1:30:21] Psalm chapter 8. David was the one that
[1:30:24] said, "Who is man that thou are mindful
[1:30:27] of him?" Now see what he's doing now.
[1:30:32] But one in a certain place testify,
[1:30:34] saying, What is man that thou are
[1:30:36] mindful of him? Or the son of man, that
[1:30:39] thou visitth him? Thou
[1:30:42] madeth him a little lower than the
[1:30:45] angel. Thou crowneth him with glory and
[1:30:50] honor, and did set him over the works of
[1:30:55] thy hands. It was not committed to
[1:30:57] angel.
[1:30:59] But God took a form lower than the
[1:31:02] angel.
[1:31:03] That's what he's trying to help us to
[1:31:05] see. That's why he's trying to bring to
[1:31:07] this Jewish church.
[1:31:10] Now, see, he's preaching the godhead.
[1:31:13] He's trying to make them to see what
[1:31:15] this Jesus was. He was not just a son of
[1:31:19] Joseph.
[1:31:21] Are we together? Amen.
[1:31:28] So he said everything there.
[1:31:31] Verse nine. This is where I where where
[1:31:34] we want to go now.
[1:31:37] But but see but we see Jesus.
[1:31:42] We see this Jesus.
[1:31:46] Praise the Lord. Are you seeing the
[1:31:48] picture?
[1:31:50] We see Jesus who was made a little lower
[1:31:55] than the angel for the suffering of
[1:31:59] death.
[1:32:01] Psalm 22.
[1:32:04] Keep it in your mind.
[1:32:06] Amen.
[1:32:08] He was made a little lower than angel
[1:32:11] for the suffering of death, crying with
[1:32:14] glory and honor
[1:32:17] that he by the grace of God should taste
[1:32:21] death for every man.
[1:32:25] Are we together?
[1:32:27] For it became him,
[1:32:31] of whom all things,
[1:32:33] of whom are all things, and by whom are
[1:32:37] all things, in bringing many sons unto
[1:32:42] glory,
[1:32:44] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:32:47] perfect through suffering.
[1:32:49] For both he that sanctifith,
[1:32:53] he set himself aside,
[1:32:56] the one that make himself little Lord
[1:32:58] and an angel. Both he that sanctifith
[1:33:02] and they who are sanctify are all one.
[1:33:06] Are we together?
[1:33:09] For which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:33:13] call them brethrens. So on the
[1:33:17] inspiration when David said I you know I
[1:33:21] will declare thy name to my brethrens.
[1:33:26] Amen. Praise the Lord. So God be even
[1:33:31] before h
[1:33:34] the virgin birth God was was was
[1:33:38] identifying himself with us.
[1:33:41] Are we together?
[1:33:44] Amen. Amen. I hope I hope that uh the
[1:33:47] Lord helped me to bring it out to you
[1:33:48] this morning and and and it can it will
[1:33:51] be a blessing. Says uh so he said for
[1:33:54] the one that sentif and they that also
[1:33:57] were sanctified all one for which cause
[1:33:59] he's not ashamed to call them brethrens
[1:34:02] saying I will declare thy name unto my
[1:34:07] brethren. What is he quoting?
[1:34:11] Psalm 22.
[1:34:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:18] He's now quoting Psalm 22. Paul has now
[1:34:21] come to the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:24] He have now come after after the uh the
[1:34:27] the angel met him on the road of
[1:34:29] Damascus. His his uh spiritual
[1:34:31] understanding. Now he's seeing the
[1:34:34] mystery of God. Now he's understanding
[1:34:37] God's program all through uh right from
[1:34:39] the beginning
[1:34:42] that this thing was not all about Jews
[1:34:44] and Gentile. This thing it was about God
[1:34:47] manifesting his attribute and gathering
[1:34:50] them back to himself.
[1:34:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:57] Amen.
[1:34:59] Now, so Paul here is re is is is now
[1:35:04] reminding the Jews. This is what is
[1:35:05] written in your Torah. This is what
[1:35:07] David said in the psalm
[1:35:10] saying, "I will declare thy name unto my
[1:35:14] brethrens in the midst of the church
[1:35:20] will I praise, will I sing praise on
[1:35:23] today." What change?
[1:35:28] Congregation.
[1:35:29] Congregation change. David said
[1:35:32] congregation.
[1:35:33] Yeah. Paul is saying church. Where did
[1:35:37] he got it from? Jesus. Because Jesus
[1:35:40] said church.
[1:35:44] Are we together?
[1:35:46] So Paul is now coming into a better
[1:35:50] understanding.
[1:35:52] He read the psalm. It was read during
[1:35:55] services. It was read during the feast.
[1:35:57] Uh over and over they read it during the
[1:36:01] Passover. They read Psalm 22 over and
[1:36:04] over. Being a boy, he heard it being
[1:36:07] read. But yet God now is giving him an
[1:36:10] understanding.
[1:36:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:15] That this thing is not just a ritual to
[1:36:18] be to be read at every event, but this
[1:36:21] is God's program. Are we together? This
[1:36:25] is God's program. This is God's doing.
[1:36:28] That's his manifestation.
[1:36:32] Are we together?
[1:36:36] It's very important people
[1:36:41] because
[1:36:43] the church has been misunderstood
[1:36:46] and the church has been misused.
[1:36:49] Amen. The church has been misunderstood
[1:36:52] and the church has been misused. A
[1:36:55] person can get up today and start a
[1:36:57] church right in their house. You have
[1:36:59] that right. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's
[1:37:04] easy to say Jesus said whatsoever two or
[1:37:06] three gather.
[1:37:08] Praise the Lord. But what's the purpose?
[1:37:14] What is the purpose?
[1:37:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:24] Because if we just change the name
[1:37:28] from good shepherd to good harvest,
[1:37:32] praise the Lord. And it's and and we
[1:37:34] still doing the same thing, then there
[1:37:37] is just no need. Just keep the same
[1:37:39] name. That be good shepherd part one,
[1:37:42] good sheeperd part two, good sheeperd
[1:37:43] part three.
[1:37:47] But if the only thing that makes us
[1:37:49] different is our need and we are doing
[1:37:53] the same thing then there is just no
[1:37:56] need. Praise the Lord. That's why we
[1:37:59] have more than more than 9,000 plus is
[1:38:03] brother said 9,000 in his day. Now we
[1:38:06] have a million plus uh different
[1:38:08] denomination
[1:38:10] with different names.
[1:38:15] Are we together?
[1:38:23] Well, just like I said, I hope I hope I
[1:38:26] hope I hope my prayer
[1:38:29] this morning was Lord, let this be a
[1:38:32] blessing. Amen. I hope that it come
[1:38:35] across to you as a blessing, something
[1:38:38] that will edify you. Then you will see
[1:38:41] where giving comes in.
[1:38:44] You will see what where giving comes in.
[1:38:47] Are we to Are we together? Praise the
[1:38:50] Lord. You will see where giving comes
[1:38:51] in. That uh it's not it's not a
[1:38:56] desperate man coming coming after your
[1:38:59] savings.
[1:39:01] Okay? It's not a desperate man coming
[1:39:04] after your savings.
[1:39:06] Are we together?
[1:39:08] saying, I will declare thy name unto my
[1:39:11] brethrens in the midst of the church. I
[1:39:15] will sing praises unto thee and again
[1:39:20] I will put my trust in him. That was the
[1:39:24] very thing David said.
[1:39:27] He put his trust in him.
[1:39:32] If you read it side by side, Psalm 22,
[1:39:36] you read it close, you begin to see the
[1:39:38] picture. I will declare
[1:39:43] thy name unto my brethrens in the midst
[1:39:47] of the church. I will sing praises unto
[1:39:50] thee. Again, I will put my trust in him.
[1:39:55] David said it in the psalm. He's quoting
[1:39:57] the psalm again. Behold, I am the
[1:40:01] children which God has given me.
[1:40:10] Are we together?
[1:40:13] Amen. Now he's he's quoting he's he he
[1:40:16] he he quoting David. He's making us to
[1:40:19] see is Jesus. He said for this Jesus for
[1:40:23] we see Jesus who was made a lower a
[1:40:25] little lower than the angel.
[1:40:29] Oh father, help us this morning. Amen.
[1:40:33] I will declare thy name unto my
[1:40:35] brethrens. In the midst of the church
[1:40:37] will I sing praises unto thee. Again I
[1:40:40] will put my trust in him. And again
[1:40:43] behold I and the children which God has
[1:40:46] given me. Verse 14. For as much then as
[1:40:50] the children are partakers of flesh
[1:40:55] and blood, he also himself.
[1:41:01] If his children are partaker of flesh
[1:41:04] and blood, he also himself. Are you
[1:41:08] seeing the picture? Is it becoming real
[1:41:11] to you? Hallelujah. This is not
[1:41:14] something that we are joining. This is a
[1:41:16] family thing. This is a blood thing.
[1:41:19] Amen. His blood has to run in you for
[1:41:22] you to be part of this.
[1:41:25] You can't join it. It's a family thing.
[1:41:27] I and the children that God has given
[1:41:30] me, in as much as they are made out of
[1:41:33] flesh,
[1:41:38] for as much as their children are
[1:41:41] partakers of flesh and blood. How do we
[1:41:44] do it? We bypass our true funny.
[1:41:49] Amen.
[1:41:51] We pick up existing element body.
[1:42:00] He also himself likewise.
[1:42:04] If my seed, if my if my children are
[1:42:09] partakers of flesh and blood, he also
[1:42:13] likewise.
[1:42:19] Are we together?
[1:42:24] Are you seeing the picture?
[1:42:27] He also likewise took part of the scene
[1:42:33] that through death
[1:42:35] he might destroy
[1:42:38] him that have power of death.
[1:42:42] That is the devil. That's why brother
[1:42:45] Brandham said he took the stain of
[1:42:48] death.
[1:42:50] He became one of us. He took on flesh so
[1:42:55] he can take this the stain of death and
[1:42:58] destroy the power of death. That death
[1:43:01] do not have power over us. Death only
[1:43:04] change our dwelling place. Amen. It's
[1:43:08] just a burgy that we hit the rope and it
[1:43:11] takes us in the sky. That's all death
[1:43:14] is. Why? Because one took the sin of
[1:43:18] death and he destroyed the power of
[1:43:20] death.
[1:43:22] So you see in God's mind just like how
[1:43:26] he dare with the children of Israel he
[1:43:29] gave them a place he said I will meet
[1:43:31] you in the place that I put my name.
[1:43:35] Amen. That is the only place I will
[1:43:38] accept your sacrifice. That is the place
[1:43:40] I will accept your worship.
[1:43:44] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:43:49] Are we together?
[1:43:51] He kept Israel as a community. That is
[1:43:55] the reason why when the people were
[1:43:58] dispersed,
[1:43:59] they could no longer keep the Sabbath
[1:44:03] because when day is breaking in Africa,
[1:44:05] we going to bed.
[1:44:07] The Sabbath was effective when they were
[1:44:11] as a community.
[1:44:13] They could wake up together. They could
[1:44:15] go to bed together.
[1:44:18] Are you seeing the picture?
[1:44:24] Amen.
[1:44:25] So just like how God there with his
[1:44:30] first church, the people he brought out
[1:44:32] of Egypt, a people he called out of a
[1:44:36] nation and took them into another
[1:44:39] nation. Praise the Lord. The same way he
[1:44:43] dare with them, they traveled together.
[1:44:46] He gathered them the uh at night time he
[1:44:49] brings out the pillar of fire. It
[1:44:51] brightened the place. They can
[1:44:52] fellowship. They can you know uh uh and
[1:44:55] and uh uh the daytime the pillar of
[1:44:57] cloud he gave them manner. He kept them
[1:44:59] together as a community.
[1:45:04] Praise the Lord. Tell me now those
[1:45:07] people were seeing the pillar of fire.
[1:45:09] They knew that that was the glory of
[1:45:11] God.
[1:45:13] Amen. They tasted of the bread.
[1:45:18] The man of fell. They ate of it.
[1:45:22] Glory be to God. But yet in that church,
[1:45:25] we had gossip. We have people plotting
[1:45:28] to get rid of Moses.
[1:45:35] Are we together?
[1:45:38] We're not going to be free from it.
[1:45:41] Amen. Amen. We have men that rose
[1:45:44] against Moses and say see the whole it
[1:45:47] look like this thing is just Moses and
[1:45:48] Aaron. Moses and Aaron. Moses said Moses
[1:45:50] said Moses said
[1:45:53] if they rose against h Moses in the
[1:45:56] first exod we're not going to be free
[1:45:59] from it. If they rose against uh Moses
[1:46:02] uh they complain and uh uh uh uh and and
[1:46:05] and Achon stealing the Babylonian
[1:46:08] government destroying his entire family.
[1:46:10] The very same thing will happen in the
[1:46:12] gentile church.
[1:46:19] Are we together?
[1:46:22] I'm I'm saying all this so you can see
[1:46:24] the picture
[1:46:32] because until we know
[1:46:36] what are our rights, we will not fight
[1:46:40] for it.
[1:46:42] Until we know what belongs to us, we
[1:46:46] will not fight for it. If good sheeperd
[1:46:49] church just looks like it's brother
[1:46:50] one's church,
[1:46:53] you will not fight for it because it's
[1:46:56] just his church.
[1:46:58] Praise the Lord. Amen. And then if you
[1:47:02] go on the next side there and brother
[1:47:04] Dan has his church is brother Dan's
[1:47:05] church. Now what will happen now? You
[1:47:07] have to stay and make your own.
[1:47:12] Are you seeing what I'm bringing across
[1:47:14] to you this morning? Amen.
[1:47:21] I want for I want for us to be able to
[1:47:23] see it.
[1:47:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:32] He prophesied, I will declare
[1:47:37] your name to my brethrens in the midst
[1:47:40] of the congregation.
[1:47:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:46] God back in his word
[1:47:50] for this thing to to happen for it to be
[1:47:52] fulfilled. He said, "For as much as the
[1:47:56] children were made of flesh,
[1:47:59] I will have to be partaker of flesh."
[1:48:03] So we can bring to pass
[1:48:07] the purpose of declaring my name.
[1:48:11] Praise the Lord. So we can bring that to
[1:48:14] pass.
[1:48:16] Because we have to realize that uh uh we
[1:48:20] one time we were all in God's mind.
[1:48:23] He thought about us and in his mind he
[1:48:26] had a happy family. Praise the Lord.
[1:48:29] Amen.
[1:48:33] It's just like a young man before he
[1:48:35] gets married, he's thinking about, I
[1:48:37] want to have three children or five,
[1:48:38] whatever. And and he's just thinking in
[1:48:40] his mind, he's living in that in that
[1:48:43] word of just thinking about them, giving
[1:48:46] them names.
[1:48:48] One time, Almighty God was like that.
[1:48:51] But when he choose to come down
[1:48:55] into time, it was to display his
[1:48:57] attribute. bring all of these things
[1:48:59] that was in his mind, make them
[1:49:01] manifest.
[1:49:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:07] Are we together?
[1:49:25] Now, so here is it.
[1:49:28] Let's go to the book of Romans.
[1:49:39] Romans chapter 8.
[1:49:43] Romans chapter 8.
[1:49:48] Brother Brandham used this scripture.
[1:49:51] He preached the message all things. He
[1:49:53] preached the message pardon.
[1:50:04] Hallelujah.
[1:50:08] Oh, what an awesome God we serve.
[1:50:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:15] What a wonderful Jesus we serve.
[1:50:30] Follow me now.
[1:50:34] Romans chapter 8.
[1:50:38] Let's read from verse 31.
[1:50:50] What shall we say then
[1:50:53] to these things?
[1:50:55] If God be for us, who can be against us?
[1:51:00] Amen.
[1:51:06] He that spare not his own son,
[1:51:10] but deliver him up for us all.
[1:51:15] How shall he net
[1:51:18] with him
[1:51:20] also freely give us all things?
[1:51:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:26] Can we read that again?
[1:51:30] Can we read it together?
[1:51:34] Verse 32.
[1:51:36] He that spared not his own son,
[1:51:41] but deliver him up for us all, how shall
[1:51:46] he not with him also freely give us all
[1:51:50] things?
[1:51:52] I hope you paid attention now
[1:51:55] uh because this is where I was going to
[1:51:57] preach my message giving from.
[1:52:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:07] Now
[1:52:11] when you think about this that God
[1:52:15] in his mind choose to spread his
[1:52:20] children all over the world.
[1:52:24] And the God that placed us wherever he
[1:52:26] is, he has the power to bring us out of
[1:52:28] it. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:52:32] He's he has a power to bring us
[1:52:37] to gravitate us to himself.
[1:52:41] Praise the Lord. In as much as he can
[1:52:44] bring us from different nation,
[1:52:47] different tribes and different people,
[1:52:50] he also can bring us out of different
[1:52:52] situations.
[1:52:56] Amen.
[1:52:57] He can bring us out of different
[1:52:59] situation. He can bring us out of uh uh
[1:53:06] different things we are dealing with in
[1:53:08] our lives.
[1:53:10] Are we together? Amen.
[1:53:14] If he could watch over us from the day
[1:53:16] we were separated from our mother's womb
[1:53:20] and has kept us till now
[1:53:24] and has made a way that we can come to
[1:53:28] his saving knowledge,
[1:53:32] he's able to bring us out of situation.
[1:53:36] Are we together?
[1:53:38] No matter what we are dealing with,
[1:53:41] praise the Lord.
[1:53:43] He's able to bring us out of faith.
[1:53:47] Are we together?
[1:53:49] Hallelujah. Amen. He can do it.
[1:53:55] Now look at what Paul says and what we
[1:53:57] wanted to look at here when we talk
[1:53:59] about giving.
[1:54:02] The most familiar scripture that is read
[1:54:04] in this. I just speak few meanings and
[1:54:06] then allow you to go because u of the
[1:54:09] lateness this morning.
[1:54:13] St. John let us know for God so loved
[1:54:16] the word
[1:54:18] that he gave.
[1:54:21] Praise the Lord. The first giver was
[1:54:25] God.
[1:54:27] He's the best giver and no one can beat
[1:54:31] him in giving.
[1:54:35] There's a there's an old song that says
[1:54:37] you can beat God-given no matter how
[1:54:40] hard you try.
[1:54:42] Amen. You cannot beat God giving. I love
[1:54:46] that song. You cannot beat him. You
[1:54:49] can't beat God-giving no matter how hard
[1:54:51] you try.
[1:54:53] Are we together? For God so loved the
[1:54:56] word. Now that is that is that is a gap
[1:55:00] power.
[1:55:03] That's what agape does. Agap gave.
[1:55:11] For God so agape the the word. He so
[1:55:15] agape the the word that he gave.
[1:55:23] Amen. He gave himself.
[1:55:29] Are we together?
[1:55:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:34] Finding a place here where I can just
[1:55:35] tie the knot,
[1:55:38] you know, and and tie every one of us
[1:55:40] together. Do like Samson. He got those
[1:55:42] foxes tie their taste together. That's
[1:55:45] what I'm trying to do this morning.
[1:55:48] Hallelujah.
[1:55:51] Now, Paul says here, "He that spare not
[1:55:53] his own son, but deliver him up for us
[1:55:56] all. For God so loved the word that he
[1:56:00] gave his son for us all. If he can give
[1:56:03] us his son, that's what Paul is saying
[1:56:05] here. What is hard for God to give you?
[1:56:12] Praise the Lord. Amen. If God can could
[1:56:17] give you his own life, if God could
[1:56:21] condemn sin, take on flesh to be a daily
[1:56:24] fire with you to be the captain of your
[1:56:28] salvation. What is difficult
[1:56:32] for him to give to you?
[1:56:36] Man, I'm going to preach like a
[1:56:37] prosperity preacher this morning
[1:56:41] because whatever you want, you can have
[1:56:43] it.
[1:56:46] Praise the Lord. Whatever you want. You
[1:56:48] want a You want a jet, you can have it.
[1:56:51] You want a mansion, you can have it.
[1:56:53] Whatever you want.
[1:56:57] Are we together? Praise the Lord.
[1:57:01] That's that's that is the conflict that
[1:57:02] is out there. But the word the word
[1:57:05] answer all of our questions.
[1:57:08] Amen. Now, watch the scripture. Now,
[1:57:11] let's go back and read.
[1:57:14] He spar not his own son, but deliver him
[1:57:17] up for us all.
[1:57:21] How shall he not
[1:57:24] with him? With who?
[1:57:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:33] He gave us his own son.
[1:57:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:38] How shall he net with him
[1:57:43] also freely gave us all things? Now if
[1:57:47] you want to take all things, don't leave
[1:57:49] him out because he gave you all things
[1:57:53] with him.
[1:57:58] Praise the Lord. If you want to take all
[1:58:01] things and leave him out, then you're
[1:58:04] not getting it from him.
[1:58:10] Are we together?
[1:58:20] Praise the Lord. So you can have
[1:58:22] whatever you want.
[1:58:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:28] Say, "Oh, well, you know, as as uh you
[1:58:30] know, as a Christian, you must not drive
[1:58:32] this kind of." It does not matter
[1:58:35] as long as you can have it with him.
[1:58:43] How shall he net with him? With Christ
[1:58:47] with the word
[1:58:51] freely give us all things. You are
[1:58:55] freely giving everything
[1:58:57] but with the word.
[1:59:02] Praise the Lord. Brother Brandon will
[1:59:04] bring a very beautiful. He said the
[1:59:07] first of these things I want to mention
[1:59:10] he said is that he gave us pardon.
[1:59:15] He said what is pardon? Pardon is free
[1:59:18] from guilt.
[1:59:21] Praise the Lord. So you cannot be
[1:59:23] guilted driving your
[1:59:27] what is the most expensive car out
[1:59:28] there?
[1:59:33] Bugatti. Okay, I don't even know how to
[1:59:35] call it.
[1:59:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:39] So you cannot be embarrassed driving
[1:59:48] your Bugatti or whatever the name is.
[1:59:53] The first thing he did was he free us
[1:59:56] from guilt.
[2:00:00] When you are free from guilt,
[2:00:03] you don't have to look over your
[2:00:05] shoulders.
[2:00:06] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:11] Are we together?
[2:00:14] Amen.
[2:00:20] So, you love the giving message this
[2:00:22] morning.
[2:00:25] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:27] But it's just the foundation. Wait until
[2:00:29] I finish. See where I'm going this
[2:00:31] morning. Praise the Lord.
[2:00:36] He that spare net his own son, but
[2:00:40] deliver him up for us all,
[2:00:43] how shall he net with him?
[2:00:49] He does not give us all things without
[2:00:51] him.
[2:00:53] Why? because he has make us joers with
[2:00:57] Christ.
[2:01:00] So it's with him Christ the word that he
[2:01:03] gave us all. We have right to
[2:01:05] everything.
[2:01:08] Praise the Lord. Because without him
[2:01:12] we will never get the best use out of
[2:01:14] it.
[2:01:16] Praise the Lord. When Adam dropped him
[2:01:19] in the beginning, the whole earth went
[2:01:21] into chaos. So if he's giving us back
[2:01:24] everything, he has to give it us with
[2:01:27] him, Christ.
[2:01:34] Hallelujah.
[2:01:36] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:38] You see, so if he gives you pardon and
[2:01:41] then he frees you from guilt, you gets
[2:01:44] to the place where uh h I mean as as as
[2:01:47] long as you are in Christ and and doing
[2:01:50] things by the word, you don't have a
[2:01:52] haunting memory. Amen. You don't have
[2:01:54] anything coming after you because you
[2:01:56] know the old account was settled long
[2:02:00] ago. I settle the old account. I settle
[2:02:04] it on my knees.
[2:02:10] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:13] Let the gossip gossip.
[2:02:16] Amen. Let the gossip or gossip.
[2:02:24] Oh brother say ask for big things.
[2:02:28] You see, but if you don't h if you don't
[2:02:30] have him, if you are not going to freely
[2:02:32] have everything with him, then it it's
[2:02:35] going to be a snail for you. It's going
[2:02:37] to destroy your life.
[2:02:43] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:45] Do you see how just one verse can take
[2:02:48] us the sleep from a preacher away? I
[2:02:51] just couldn't I couldn't get asleep.
[2:02:54] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:56] when I travel with the young people, we
[2:02:58] traveled as far as to Chicago and uh uh
[2:03:02] uh
[2:03:05] it was it was almost about 1:00 a.m. and
[2:03:08] I said, "No, I I told him, you know,
[2:03:10] they were all bragging. They are not
[2:03:12] going to sleep, you know, and making
[2:03:14] noise and uh you know, and I mean, we
[2:03:17] were we were singing, we were talking,
[2:03:18] we had good talks, you know, and uh they
[2:03:21] were telling me their expectation for
[2:03:22] the camp and what they expecting, you
[2:03:24] know, and all of that.
[2:03:27] But then I felt I said no I need to I
[2:03:30] need to pull off and you know uh we
[2:03:32] found a hotel
[2:03:34] and we got in there. So uh put the girls
[2:03:38] in their room and Emmanuel and myself
[2:03:40] were together and uh uh so I decided to
[2:03:46] to just steady pray a little bit. That's
[2:03:48] what I wanted to do and uh because I
[2:03:52] know uh it was it was going to be a
[2:03:53] tiresome trip. So I I started
[2:03:57] I started looking started studying and
[2:03:59] praying but then I was just hearing ch
[2:04:06] I had to call them a couple of times on
[2:04:07] their phone. Hey y'all go to bed. Y
[2:04:10] please go to bed.
[2:04:14] Yeah but it was it was good. So I was I
[2:04:17] was just I was looking at this thing and
[2:04:19] and I mean it just it just ruined my
[2:04:21] sleep. I couldn't sleep. And now uh
[2:04:25] okay so let's just go into let's go into
[2:04:28] this now so we can be able to appreciate
[2:04:30] the word.
[2:04:34] Amen.
[2:04:37] Thank you for bearing with me.
[2:04:42] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:48] What an awesome God we serve. Amen. You
[2:04:51] love the Lord.
[2:04:53] Amen. Amen. I sure believe that.
[2:04:58] Hallelujah.
[2:05:01] He's an awesome God.
[2:05:05] He's a wonderful Jesus.
[2:05:15] He that spare not his his own son, but
[2:05:18] deliver him up for us all. How shall he
[2:05:23] net with him freely give us all things?
[2:05:28] What a promise.
[2:05:31] Amen.
[2:05:32] What a promise. That he has given us all
[2:05:36] things. We have a right to everything.
[2:05:40] Everything.
[2:05:41] Praise the Lord. There must be nothing
[2:05:44] that must be too big for us to
[2:05:46] accomplish.
[2:05:47] Praise the Lord. There must be nothing
[2:05:50] that is too big for us. But you see the
[2:05:52] thing about it there is that we must
[2:05:54] first have him.
[2:05:56] Amen.
[2:05:58] We must first have him. He freely gave
[2:06:01] us for God so loved the word if he spare
[2:06:04] not his son. So you see before he gave
[2:06:06] us all things the first thing he gave us
[2:06:09] was his son.
[2:06:12] Are we together? Amen. Now this is where
[2:06:16] this is where my my giving message is
[2:06:18] coming to you this morning.
[2:06:22] You see because uh uh
[2:06:25] you cannot you cannot give
[2:06:31] that's what Paul will say to the
[2:06:32] Corinthians. God love a cheerful giver.
[2:06:36] You cannot give if your heart is not in
[2:06:38] it.
[2:06:41] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:06:44] In as much as giving is a sensitive
[2:06:48] subject to the church, to the religious
[2:06:51] world because it looks like someone
[2:06:53] fishing out for money, but it has a
[2:06:56] revelation. There is something that is
[2:06:58] that is attached to it.
[2:07:01] Praise the Lord. Because I would tell
[2:07:03] you this morning
[2:07:05] that
[2:07:07] your your finance, your contribution,
[2:07:11] your service to the Lord
[2:07:14] is not good enough
[2:07:17] if you have not given yourself.
[2:07:21] Praise the Lord.
[2:07:24] King never brought rotten fruit. That's
[2:07:27] a lying gospel.
[2:07:29] He brought the first fruit. Yes. Amen.
[2:07:34] You go into Leviticus. Leviticus talks
[2:07:36] about the first fruit.
[2:07:40] He brought the first fruit. He was not
[2:07:43] rejected because his his offering was
[2:07:46] wrong.
[2:07:48] The scripture only tell us that Abel by
[2:07:52] revelation
[2:07:54] offer a what?
[2:07:56] More excellent. That's what the Bible
[2:07:58] says. They didn't say uh uh uh uh king
[2:08:02] sacrifice was was was not accepted
[2:08:05] because it was not good. The Bible talks
[2:08:07] about the first fruit. He brought the
[2:08:09] first fruit.
[2:08:12] But what was his problem? His heart.
[2:08:18] Amen. His heart.
[2:08:22] That's where his problem was.
[2:08:26] Praise the Lord. Let me tell let me show
[2:08:28] you something here. Ephesians chapter 1.
[2:08:32] I'm going all over to the place all over
[2:08:34] the place now because I want to get this
[2:08:37] uh I want to get this uh get this thing
[2:08:41] over here with you.
[2:08:44] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:46] See what the Bible says here. Ephesians
[2:08:48] chapter 1. Let's read verse three.
[2:08:51] Blessed be the God and father of our
[2:08:53] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[2:08:55] with all spiritual blessing in heavenly
[2:08:58] places. listening to this now. I call
[2:09:01] him.
[2:09:08] Okay. I want to make sure that I'm not
[2:09:10] off here. I call in as he has chosen us
[2:09:13] in him before the foundation of the word
[2:09:15] that we should be holy
[2:09:18] and uh
[2:09:21] and without blame before him in love.
[2:09:24] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:09:28] having predestinated us to the adoption
[2:09:30] of children by Jesus Christ to him, I
[2:09:33] call him to the good pleasure of his
[2:09:36] will. Verse six, to the praise of the
[2:09:39] glory of his grace, wherein
[2:09:44] he have made us
[2:09:47] accepted
[2:09:49] in the beloved.
[2:09:54] Our acception uh God accepting us is not
[2:09:58] because of the family we were born or
[2:10:01] because of the nation we came from
[2:10:04] or that you know our our our our father
[2:10:07] was a a bishop or grandfather was a a
[2:10:12] minister. No, no, no, no, no. We have
[2:10:14] been accepted in the beloved
[2:10:21] and the beloved is Christ
[2:10:24] because God accepted him as our
[2:10:27] sacrifice.
[2:10:29] Are we together?
[2:10:32] Just like when the worshipper bring his
[2:10:35] sacrifice, when the sacrifice was
[2:10:37] accepted, the worshipper was also
[2:10:40] accepted.
[2:10:43] So are we together? Amen. You go in the
[2:10:47] book of Deuteronomy, the Bible will even
[2:10:48] tell the scripture will tells us that
[2:10:51] even when a man was bringing his
[2:10:53] offering and uh uh uh uh and and he he
[2:10:56] had to put it in the place
[2:11:00] where God has put his name.
[2:11:04] Are we together? So you see it's not the
[2:11:07] service, it's not the sacrifice,
[2:11:10] it's what God's word has ordain.
[2:11:16] Are we together?
[2:11:18] So the first thing that God will take
[2:11:21] from us is ourself.
[2:11:26] Praise the Lord. If you are not giving
[2:11:29] to the Lord, I mean uh your life and and
[2:11:32] and you are not giving yourself to his
[2:11:34] word, you are not giving yourself to
[2:11:37] prayer. You can't give money. Let me
[2:11:41] tell you,
[2:11:43] you can't give money.
[2:11:49] You will struggle to
[2:11:53] praise the Lord.
[2:11:56] Are we together?
[2:11:59] That is the problem with the church.
[2:12:02] We want to do service for God and and
[2:12:04] most of the time we fall in the place of
[2:12:07] just looking for some service also.
[2:12:15] True service to God is when you are
[2:12:18] giving when you you are giving over.
[2:12:24] If God can have you, he can have
[2:12:26] everything that you have. If he can have
[2:12:29] you, there is nothing of yours that will
[2:12:32] be difficult to give.
[2:12:38] That is the problem of giving.
[2:12:46] He that spare not his own son, he could
[2:12:50] give it. If he could give you his son,
[2:12:53] then what is difficult for him to give
[2:12:54] you all things?
[2:12:57] If he could give you himself, what is
[2:13:00] difficult for him to give you all
[2:13:02] things? So, he's not going to receive
[2:13:05] all things or anything from you until
[2:13:08] you can give yourself.
[2:13:16] Praise the Lord.
[2:13:17] And that's the reason why our generation
[2:13:20] is is is is becoming uh uh uh is is
[2:13:24] depleting of men and women that are that
[2:13:28] are that are giving to the Lord. When I
[2:13:31] say giving to the Lord, you'll find uh
[2:13:34] uh uh uh uh uh uh ages back where uh uh
[2:13:40] uh people gave in different ways. They
[2:13:42] went down to uh uh uh shelter to give.
[2:13:46] They went down to homeless places to
[2:13:49] give. They had the burden to to to to do
[2:13:52] something for people that were in need.
[2:13:56] The giving was not just passing
[2:13:58] collection plate. Let's pass the plate
[2:14:00] first, let's pass it second. No, people
[2:14:03] had was burdened
[2:14:06] to be able to do service for other
[2:14:08] humanity.
[2:14:11] That's when men were giving to God.
[2:14:14] They wanted to do something for their
[2:14:16] community. They wanted to do something
[2:14:19] for a a a relative. The relative don't
[2:14:22] have to be in the same church that you
[2:14:24] were in.
[2:14:27] That's true sense of giving.
[2:14:32] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:36] And if we cannot do that,
[2:14:40] no matter how much we pass the plate,
[2:14:47] if we can't give ourself and give our
[2:14:49] time to the Lord, give your time in
[2:14:53] prayer, give your time in reading the
[2:14:55] word,
[2:14:58] you can't give your time in that, coming
[2:15:00] to church will not mean anything to you.
[2:15:03] It won't mean anything to you. You will
[2:15:05] put it on your calendar schedule. I can
[2:15:07] be here this day. I can't be here
[2:15:09] because I have uh I can be here. You
[2:15:12] will just put it on your calendar.
[2:15:16] Praise the Lord. Brother Brandham says
[2:15:18] it was in the jubilee when when the
[2:15:20] jubilee sound when the trumpet sound, he
[2:15:23] says uh the slave drops whatever is in
[2:15:27] his hand because he heard that jubilee
[2:15:29] sound.
[2:15:32] He's ready to go free.
[2:15:34] He's ready to go into worship. Whatever
[2:15:37] we're doing, we can freely
[2:15:40] drop it because we know it's service
[2:15:42] time. Kids, let's gather. It's service
[2:15:45] time.
[2:15:47] Amen. We have given this time for
[2:15:49] service. So whether you at home, whether
[2:15:51] you you you need to be in church, it's
[2:15:53] service time. It must be service time.
[2:15:57] That's giving.
[2:15:59] That's the true sense of giving.
[2:16:04] Giving God is not counted in saints and
[2:16:06] doubt
[2:16:08] people
[2:16:11] because we will not do it faithfully.
[2:16:14] If this is not real to us,
[2:16:18] Amen. If it is not real to us, you will
[2:16:21] not do it faithfully.
[2:16:24] We will count our needs
[2:16:27] in priority
[2:16:33] over our obligations to God.
[2:16:37] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:16:43] And then we want to make it an American
[2:16:45] slogan. The belts bills don't have
[2:16:47] nothing to do with it. It don't have
[2:16:50] nothing to do with it. God took care of
[2:16:53] you before you start paying bills. And
[2:16:56] the same God that took care of you, he
[2:16:58] can take care of you.
[2:17:01] It don't have nothing. It's just a poor
[2:17:03] It's is it's a depleted version of how
[2:17:06] much we have made God.
[2:17:11] A very poor revelation.
[2:17:13] It shows how much the inner man is
[2:17:15] giving to God.
[2:17:22] How much we love this God.
[2:17:28] If he spare not his son
[2:17:32] and freely give,
[2:17:34] he can give us all things. All things.
[2:17:38] Is Bill not part of all things?
[2:17:42] Is build not part of all things?
[2:17:52] Love the Lord with all of your heart,
[2:17:56] all of your soul, all of your mind.
[2:18:01] Love the Lord with all of your heart,
[2:18:04] all of your soul, all of your mind, all
[2:18:08] of your strength.
[2:18:12] It's not just a good verse, people. It's
[2:18:15] an experience with God. Amen. It's a
[2:18:19] birth something you are birthed into.
[2:18:22] Paul says, "What can separate us from
[2:18:24] the love of God?" Amen. Is it trial?
[2:18:29] Is it sickness? What? What can separate
[2:18:32] us? That's what we talking about.
[2:18:36] When we talk about giving, that's where
[2:18:38] it starts from.
[2:18:41] Praise the Lord. Because if you don't
[2:18:43] have it, it just a matter of time you
[2:18:45] start complaining.
[2:18:47] you will start complaining.
[2:18:51] I used to pay my t there.
[2:18:54] I donated there
[2:18:58] pretty soon because there's there is
[2:19:01] there is no keep there is there is
[2:19:02] nothing keeping you
[2:19:07] pretty soon.
[2:19:19] Are we together?
[2:19:25] So king's sacrifice was not was not
[2:19:27] rotten fruit. It was the first fruit.
[2:19:30] Praise the Lord. And if you want to take
[2:19:33] it first fruit, it was thie.
[2:19:37] Your tie is your first fruit.
[2:19:41] So he was paying tithe, but yet it was
[2:19:44] rejected.
[2:19:47] So yeah, God can reject your tie
[2:19:52] based on your attitude.
[2:19:55] Praise the Lord. The things you say
[2:19:57] behind it, the thoughts that run through
[2:20:00] your mind.
[2:20:05] Israel were told that they should they
[2:20:06] cannot pay tithe from uh from uh the
[2:20:09] purchase of dogs which were uh uh
[2:20:11] Gentiles.
[2:20:14] You couldn't you couldn't pay tithe from
[2:20:16] from the purchase of a slave.
[2:20:20] It was not accepted.
[2:20:30] Praise the Lord.
[2:20:33] Are you getting the picture this
[2:20:35] morning?
[2:20:38] The people were supposed to bring
[2:20:42] the uh all of the uh their offerings and
[2:20:46] uh all of the uh sacrifices to the place
[2:20:49] that God has put his name.
[2:20:54] And that place that God has put his name
[2:20:57] in our day is in Christ Jesus the word.
[2:21:01] Praise the Lord. Out of the word. out of
[2:21:04] the word.
[2:21:14] So you see that's that is the purpose of
[2:21:16] the church
[2:21:18] right from prophecy.
[2:21:21] He was to declare his name, make himself
[2:21:23] known.
[2:21:25] And there's there's just a little few
[2:21:27] that I I I would like to go in, but I I
[2:21:29] just thought that I will spend a lot of
[2:21:31] time on it this morning if I continue to
[2:21:33] go that direction.
[2:21:38] You know why I'm saying this people? Let
[2:21:41] me let me be let me be frank to you.
[2:21:44] This little assembling that you see here
[2:21:49] has uh has been involved in lot of
[2:21:52] things. Lot of things. uh uh
[2:21:56] uh in few parts of the word. Let me not
[2:21:58] say the whole word. I I will not be
[2:22:00] telling truth. In few parts of the word
[2:22:03] and uh uh and God has really really
[2:22:06] really blessed us as a people. He has
[2:22:09] blessed us as a people in uh in uh some
[2:22:14] of the things that we do.
[2:22:17] Uh
[2:22:22] we we uh we support work with a lot of
[2:22:26] missionaries,
[2:22:28] you know, because if you can't go, you
[2:22:30] should send one.
[2:22:32] We get involved and uh most of uh the
[2:22:36] preachers that pass uh through us here,
[2:22:38] we treat them as missionaries because uh
[2:22:41] they are they are traveling different
[2:22:43] from the ones that we invite.
[2:22:46] and and as a church we have committed
[2:22:49] ourself you know uh to support these

[2:23:02] first thing that I saw here and I I I

[2:23:35] Don't don't get me wrong. I'm not saying
[2:23:37] that it's wrong. I'm saying that God has
[2:23:40] given us the grace as a church
[2:23:48] not to go that route.
[2:23:52] Okay?
[2:23:54] He has given us the grace as a church
[2:23:56] not to you know uh uh uh you know it's
[2:24:00] not that it's wrong. It's not wrong at
[2:24:01] all.
[2:24:03] It's not wrong at all when people do
[2:24:05] that. But also is at a place where
[2:24:12] uh
[2:24:14] many of us things are done around the
[2:24:18] church and uh uh uh God bless you

[2:24:49] Now so uh uh you know all of all all of
[2:24:52] that uh uh almost kind of losing my
[2:24:54] train of mind here and and there are
[2:24:56] things that are done you know uh and
[2:24:59] everything that is done around this
[2:25:01] local assembly we don't pay for service
[2:25:05] everything that is done for most
[2:25:07] everything that is done here is done
[2:25:09] voluntarily
[2:25:12] is done voluntarily
[2:25:16] most everything that is done around the
[2:25:18] cleaning clean of the build the the
[2:25:19] building the bathroom the cleaning of
[2:25:22] outside and and most everything is done
[2:25:26] is done voluntarily and uh and and and
[2:25:29] it's and it's something that we are
[2:25:31] proud of
[2:25:33] to see that God uh you know have placed
[2:25:35] on people heart to make their time
[2:25:38] available to come and you know make this
[2:25:41] place a habitable place for us. Praise
[2:25:45] the Lord. Amen. That is a beautiful
[2:25:48] thing. But
[2:25:51] as a pastor, I'm not I'm not satisfied
[2:25:56] that our service to the Lord must be
[2:25:59] limited to that.
[2:26:02] Praise the Lord. No, I'm not satisfied.
[2:26:06] Uh uh uh and and I and then I I I I
[2:26:10] don't I don't have to know, you know. I
[2:26:12] don't have to know. I'm not uh uh uh
[2:26:14] trying to be nosy in what you are doing
[2:26:17] you know privately for the Lord. I I
[2:26:19] don't have to know it. But what what I
[2:26:21] want to do is de I want
[2:26:26] by the help of the Lord and the burden
[2:26:28] of the Holy Ghost to make you
[2:26:33] a missionary
[2:26:35] to make you a part of God's work
[2:26:40] in in a in a different way.
[2:26:44] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:26:47] for you to sit and ask yourself, what am
[2:26:50] I doing for the Lord?
[2:26:55] How am I involved?
[2:27:01] Praise the Lord. And uh just just uh the
[2:27:04] other time we had that brother here
[2:27:07] visiting with us from Sevilleong and uh
[2:27:10] just you all know the story. He's he his
[2:27:12] brother lives in the apartment. Yeah. He
[2:27:13] just came back to visit with us. I mean
[2:27:15] a very very good golly man. He's very
[2:27:18] good golly man. I mean he loved the
[2:27:19] lord. He loved the lord. I mean from uh
[2:27:22] from the first day that he came uh uh to
[2:27:25] fellowship with us uh I mean he enjoyed
[2:27:27] the word you know uh uh uh never had no
[2:27:32] problem with uh uh talking to him about
[2:27:35] brother Brandham talking to him about
[2:27:36] the message. I mean uh I mean he just he
[2:27:39] just loved the Lord and he he he felt
[2:27:42] like uh that was the purpose of his trip
[2:27:45] to to America
[2:27:49] to come in contact with the word to see
[2:27:51] it in a way that he had never saw it
[2:27:53] before.
[2:27:56] Praise the Lord.
[2:27:58] And since the first service he's here
[2:28:00] Wednesday night, he's here on Sunday. I
[2:28:02] mean sometimes he's uh maybe the first
[2:28:04] or second person that gets through the
[2:28:06] door. I mean, he was always here
[2:28:10] and he's a pastor of a local church.
[2:28:13] Praise the Lord. So, what we did was
[2:28:18] and uh we thought that we would we would
[2:28:22] give him a little support
[2:28:25] as a as a as a pastor with us. Uh you
[2:28:28] know, we supported him while he was
[2:28:30] around. uh uh just just a little little
[2:28:34] talking we we we choose to give and and
[2:28:37] uh uh you know just just to be able to
[2:28:40] support him. And uh and then before he
[2:28:43] left uh you know uh I told I I took him
[2:28:47] somewhere downtown Minneapolis
[2:28:51] uh to a man that has a uh you know he
[2:28:54] has a ministry of shipping Bibles you
[2:28:57] know overseas and and uh uh his wife and
[2:29:01] my wife work together. That's how they
[2:29:03] got to know one another. And uh uh so so
[2:29:07] we went and and and visited the place
[2:29:09] which of course it was it was just it
[2:29:11] was just it was such a blessing to me.
[2:29:15] Okay. Such a blessing. I mean he's been
[2:29:17] running that place for over you told me
[2:29:19] over 18 years have it organized. He says
[2:29:24] uh we only send out the word nothing but
[2:29:27] the word. Amen. We don't send out
[2:29:29] Jehovah witness things.
[2:29:32] We don't do no cut. We don't do nothing
[2:29:34] just the scripture and just to see the
[2:29:38] commitment. He's sending these things
[2:29:40] out to people he will never meet in this
[2:29:43] life.
[2:29:45] Praise the Lord. Amen. People that he
[2:29:49] would and to see the joy that he has in
[2:29:52] it. Yeah, man. This guy, he has so much
[2:29:55] energy. Amen. He's an older gentleman.
[2:29:58] So much energy. I mean, he said, "Come,
[2:30:00] come inside. Come inside." you know,
[2:30:01] give you a toll and sit down and you
[2:30:04] know, I mean, I mean, I was just I was
[2:30:07] just so carried away.
[2:30:09] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:30:13] We've been given a message.
[2:30:16] God has uh sent a message to call out a
[2:30:19] bride. But you also have to realize that
[2:30:22] when the bride is cut from the pattern,
[2:30:25] the other material is not useless.
[2:30:30] Amen. The other material that that that
[2:30:34] is that has been cut off is not useless.
[2:30:36] It's not thrown away. That's where our
[2:30:39] foolish virgin comes from. Whosoever
[2:30:42] will, he that thirst, let him come.
[2:30:45] That's what John said.
[2:30:49] Praise the Lord.
[2:30:51] When we think about the bride and we
[2:30:53] think about uh uh uh the message, it it
[2:30:57] had just become so selfish in a way that
[2:31:00] we only think about ourself. I'm in the
[2:31:02] message
[2:31:04] as if that was the only thing that God
[2:31:06] wanted to do
[2:31:08] is to get you in.
[2:31:17] That's where I'm coming from this
[2:31:18] morning when I talk about giving.
[2:31:21] It's not to look into your pockets. By
[2:31:24] God's grace, the Lord has been good to
[2:31:26] us. Amen.
[2:31:29] You know, when you when you when you
[2:31:31] come from uh uh a struggling life, you
[2:31:34] appreciate when life gets better. Amen.
[2:31:37] And you don't you don't you don't also
[2:31:39] despise your struggling days because
[2:31:41] when you fall back, you know exactly
[2:31:43] what to do.
[2:31:46] Praise the Lord. But what are we doing
[2:31:48] for the Lord? What are we doing with
[2:31:52] this word that we hear service after
[2:31:55] service after service after service?
[2:32:00] What are we doing for the Lord? What are
[2:32:02] we doing that you can say that the Lord
[2:32:05] placed this burden on my heart?
[2:32:10] Praise the Lord.
[2:32:15] We have men uh that will come and preach
[2:32:17] to us. These men they have uh they have
[2:32:20] wives, they have uh they have family,
[2:32:24] they will come and labor with us and
[2:32:28] wonder, you know, uh uh sometimes I just
[2:32:31] think it in my mind, oh God,
[2:32:35] a lot of lot of things we will do in the
[2:32:38] name of the church. Take this from our
[2:32:40] church. you know uh uh but I mean let's
[2:32:46] let's not let's not allow uh uh the
[2:32:49] burden of the Lord to go away from us.
[2:32:53] We are just so consumed with ourself.
[2:32:58] Praise the Lord. We we are we we I mean
[2:33:01] it's is it's almost Lord Lord let let
[2:33:04] not the rapture come because uh you know
[2:33:06] I want to make sure I achieve this or I
[2:33:08] achieve that and whatsoever. God is not
[2:33:10] working on your timeline anyway. He
[2:33:14] working on his own timeline.
[2:33:19] Praise the Lord.
[2:33:23] But you see the problem is is not that
[2:33:25] the people, you know, in most cases what
[2:33:28] happened is that if you tell the people
[2:33:30] they will do it. If he just says let's
[2:33:33] have a meeting as a church, you know, we
[2:33:36] want to support this brother. I'm
[2:33:38] telling you the people will support
[2:33:42] but
[2:33:45] why should we always say it?
[2:33:51] Why should we always say? Why should it
[2:33:53] be at a place where uh uh we must tell
[2:33:57] you that uh you know this thing need to
[2:34:00] be done
[2:34:02] or this thing need to be done.
[2:34:10] If this is your community, if God has
[2:34:14] called us together as a church to
[2:34:16] declare his name, make his name known
[2:34:18] among us, what is your responsibility?
[2:34:25] What do you pick up as a responsibility?
[2:34:31] What do you do as a as as as going over
[2:34:34] your duty?
[2:34:38] Because he says, I will inhabit the
[2:34:39] praises of of the people. I will I will
[2:34:42] inhabit I will come and do it among
[2:34:43] them. What are we doing to make the
[2:34:45] atmosphere better?
[2:34:47] What are we doing to make it make it
[2:34:50] easier for another person?
[2:34:53] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:34:58] It breaks my heart to say
[2:35:03] not too long. It was just not too long.
[2:35:06] It's not it's not even over a year or
[2:35:08] two. how the Lord was was helping our
[2:35:12] young people.
[2:35:17] Helping our young people. We have uh
[2:35:20] some of the young ones uh uh trying to
[2:35:22] lead songs and uh Simon was playing
[2:35:25] there. The girls here was playing and
[2:35:28] all of that. and and and and sometimes
[2:35:30] when these things happen, it's so easy
[2:35:33] for us to sit back, put on our religious
[2:35:37] blanket,
[2:35:38] sit under it, and just talk.
[2:35:43] What are we doing? How does it affect
[2:35:45] you?
[2:35:48] How do you feel about it? What are you
[2:35:50] doing about it?
[2:35:59] What do we do?
[2:36:03] Praise the Lord.
[2:36:10] We work in places,
[2:36:13] you know. We work in places.
[2:36:16] We live in places.
[2:36:24] You don't want someone guessing whether
[2:36:26] you are a Christian or not.
[2:36:29] You want them to know. You don't want
[2:36:31] them to guess.
[2:36:34] Praise the Lord. You want them to know.
[2:36:36] You're not going about shouting, "I'm a
[2:36:38] Christian. I'm a Christian. I'm a
[2:36:39] Christian." That's not what we're
[2:36:41] talking about.
[2:36:46] Are you seeing what I'm coming from this
[2:36:47] morning?
[2:36:55] Look at the wise men when Jesus was
[2:36:57] born. The Bible says we they said we
[2:37:00] have seen his star in the east and we
[2:37:04] have come to worship him. Praise the
[2:37:06] Lord.
[2:37:08] And when they came to worship, every one
[2:37:10] of them according to the revelation that
[2:37:13] was in their heart, they brought a gift
[2:37:18] for the word. As they come to worship
[2:37:21] the word, there was something they come
[2:37:23] to give.
[2:37:26] You see that is the difference between
[2:37:28] agapo love and feel your love. Feel your
[2:37:31] love, just receive.
[2:37:34] Feel your love, just receive.
[2:37:37] Agap love gave.
[2:37:40] Amen. Brother Brandham says when love
[2:37:42] projects,
[2:37:44] he says when love projects, he says
[2:37:47] that's when sovereign grace steps on the
[2:37:49] scene, take over the situation because
[2:37:53] love has projected itself.
[2:37:58] Praise the Lord.
[2:38:00] I mean it goes as as much as to our
[2:38:03] homes. It goes uh you know to our
[2:38:06] family, our loved ones
[2:38:16] because that's what the church is.
[2:38:19] That's what the church is. That's the
[2:38:23] that is the closest community we have on
[2:38:26] earth. a people
[2:38:29] that mention your name in prayer
[2:38:34] that thinks about you and and and and
[2:38:36] say Lord bless that sister I don't even
[2:38:38] know her name but Lord God bless her and
[2:38:40] and bless that brother sometime ashamed
[2:38:42] to say it when we think about it
[2:38:55] praise the Lord
[2:38:58] and it's our responsibility.
[2:39:03] I'm just doing this this morning
[2:39:06] just to be able to encourage you as I
[2:39:10] just close up now and uh uh
[2:39:22] taking sides with Jesus.
[2:39:25] Brother talks about our
[2:39:28] uh
[2:39:31] there be a tomorrow.
[2:39:35] Every generation live with an
[2:39:37] anticipation of the coming of the Lord.
[2:39:40] And because they were anticipating that
[2:39:44] God will come and they die with that
[2:39:47] anticipation is the expectation is that
[2:39:50] anticipation that wakes them up because
[2:39:52] they die with their think. Praise the
[2:39:55] Lord. Expecting that God will come in
[2:39:58] their generation. But if he don't comes
[2:40:01] in our generation
[2:40:03] and if there is a tomorrow,
[2:40:05] praise the Lord,
[2:40:08] our our young people.
[2:40:12] Praise the Lord.
[2:40:15] If there is a more cherish
[2:40:18] uh
[2:40:20] treasure that we have, it's a young
[2:40:24] people, you know, Friday
[2:40:28] how to do some few things and uh came
[2:40:31] over at the church year, get some things
[2:40:33] done and and then uh I was just getting
[2:40:38] myself ready for the trip. I thought I
[2:40:40] was going to sleep. I couldn't. And then
[2:40:43] I was driving home. home. I was saying
[2:40:44] to the Lord, I says, "Lord, uh these
[2:40:47] parents have given me their children.
[2:40:50] I'm going to drive over 8 hours, Lord.
[2:40:55] And uh whether I slept or not, I still
[2:40:58] need your help."
[2:41:01] Praise the Lord.
[2:41:04] To be able to land him safely to the
[2:41:07] campground
[2:41:09] and make sure that he get back home
[2:41:11] safely.
[2:41:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:41:16] And you see, it's just like when you get
[2:41:19] on the flight or you get on any kind of
[2:41:22] a transportation,
[2:41:24] that moment to your destination,
[2:41:28] your life is in the hands of the pilot
[2:41:32] with God above. Praise the Lord. But
[2:41:36] he's the man. He's the captain on the
[2:41:38] plane. What is the shape? He's the
[2:41:41] captain.
[2:41:42] He hold himself responsible that he have
[2:41:45] your life.
[2:41:47] I feel the same when you come through
[2:41:49] those doors.
[2:41:51] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:41:55] That's how I feel.
[2:42:00] We're going to fly and we want to make
[2:42:02] sure that we land on the other side.
[2:42:05] Praise the Lord. This plane is not made
[2:42:07] by Boeing. So you can you can relax. The
[2:42:10] window is not going to go off. Praise
[2:42:12] the Lord.
[2:42:14] The tired is not going to bust,
[2:42:18] but yet your pilot is a is a human.
[2:42:23] Praise the Lord. He's a guy that can get
[2:42:26] frustrated.
[2:42:29] He's a guy that can get angry. He's a
[2:42:32] guy that can get tired.
[2:42:34] And he's a guy that needs your prayer
[2:42:36] more than anything.
[2:42:38] Praise the Lord. Amen. We have a
[2:42:42] responsibility as a people, as a church,
[2:42:46] not just to have a place, come together
[2:42:50] Wednesday night, come together Sunday
[2:42:52] morning and just sit down and you know
[2:42:56] and you know yell at you all the time.
[2:43:00] No,
[2:43:03] that's a body.
[2:43:06] That's a responsibility.
[2:43:09] This is a community.
[2:43:11] Praise the Lord.
[2:43:13] Amen. If we don't know your needs, we
[2:43:16] can pray for you.
[2:43:19] If you don't allow us, we can't help
[2:43:22] you.
[2:43:25] We can help you.
[2:43:30] I don't even know how to do it.
[2:43:34] But if you trust me and uh and we trust
[2:43:37] the Lord together,
[2:43:39] praise the Lord.
[2:43:42] Just like I said, Moses never got it
[2:43:44] easy. He had a pillar of fire. He had a
[2:43:46] pillar of cloud, but yet he had a
[2:43:48] stealing Babylonian garment. He had uh
[2:43:51] Aberon and and the rest of them rising
[2:43:53] up against. We will always have those
[2:43:55] things. We will always have it.
[2:44:00] But it must not distort our vision. It
[2:44:03] must not distort our purpose. Praise the
[2:44:06] Lord. Amen. We want to make this place a
[2:44:10] happy place. We pray that you know if if
[2:44:13] the Lord will will if he if he retire
[2:44:16] it, if it is in his mind to stay very
[2:44:19] long, we trust that he will bless us
[2:44:21] with uh with place where we can have
[2:44:23] adequate space to do what we want to do.
[2:44:26] But until then,
[2:44:30] we want to keep this place.
[2:44:34] Honor the preeeminence of the Holy
[2:44:35] Ghost.
[2:44:37] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:44:41] Pray for me as I pray for you. And let's
[2:44:44] labor together.
[2:44:47] Glory be to God. Let's labor together.
[2:44:51] Let's do what uh uh uh you know uh is is
[2:44:55] right to do by the word
[2:44:58] and I'm sure we're going to come out
