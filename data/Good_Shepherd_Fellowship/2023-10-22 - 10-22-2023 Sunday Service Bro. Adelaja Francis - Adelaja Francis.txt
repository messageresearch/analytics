God this morning um the Lord has done something amazing in my life uh in the life of my family so um if I don't come object to give the Lord thanks I think I won't be doing Justice uh I'm not a kind of cameram man I don't love coming up here because I'm not a public speaker but um you know sometime when God does something in your life you just don't want to keep sitting back that you want to come in from and just give God all the glory [Music] um this is all about my daughter um she's personally with us here in service today um I would just sum this whole thing up uh it was couple of years back um pretty much I want to say like seven to8 years um my wife and myself we had the um opportunity to travel to the United States so but then my daughter was just 3 months old and I mean you know we we were scheduled to pick our visa from the embassy on a Tuesday Morning a Tuesday afternoon rather so Tuesday around like 4:00 a.m. in the morning my wife got in the liver pain and she gave birth to my daughter who sit here right now so that's that Tuesday in the afternoon we were to appear to the embassi to get our Visa so I went to the ambassy and and just explain you know everything to the counselors and they were like okay if you can get um the child ready you can go with the child to the United States so and all we needed was 600 United 650 United stat to get her ready but we never had a money so um we were unable to bring our daughter so we left her with my mom at the age of uh three months old and I mean it was really hard for us it was really hard so we came and then pretty much after 2 years we decided to P in our p two to three years we decid to put in their paperwork and then um before putting in the paperwork um decid I decided actually to talk with a lawyer concerning the entire process so then this lawyer based on what I explained to him he would then tell me that you know getting my children here would be really difficult because I would have to go through courot martiall and it was just a lot that he told me so I brother one on the phone and then I explain everything to brother one so brother one said um you know I don't think you guys have to go in the way of the lawyer because immigration did not get back to you people immigration did not ask you any question concerning your children then why you want to go back to lawyer you know so uh based on what brother one told me they you know the advis he gave my wife and myself you know we just asked him to just keep us in prayer and then we went about uh doing the paperwork brother Max was one of those that helped me in the process of you know doing all of the paperwork for my children so we submitted the paperwork in and then it took like three and a half years so after three and a half years immigration got back to me and they were ready to give my children Visa so you know our just so excited about it and they told me to tell the boy and the girl to go to the Embassy to get a Visa so when my father-in-law took them there they would not give the boy a Visa that's the reason the boy is not even here with us today so they told me then they called me direct the the the the embassy called me directly from the um from the country and they told me that you know um we will only give your daughter the Visa we will not give your son the visa for what reason up to now I don't even know but anyway just to you know sum everything up they give my daughter the Visa and you know by the grace of God brother Hillary and his family they were in Liberia and I just called them and talked to them about it and they were willing to bring my daughter and they brought the girl uh while coming back to the United States so um I just want to be thankful to God for everything that he has done I know Grandma Kelly and brother Ste uh brother Steve have been really praying for us in regard to our children including brother ju and I believe most of the s in here today so I'm just so thankful to almighty God that my daughter can you know join us in the United State here and we are still looking forward to having the board to also join with us so thank you all for your prayers and

pressure friend of of hers and uh um she want to [Music] testify um so while we were singing this song um I just got back from Israel and um I was there for six weeks with a place called highl we were able to work The Vineyards for six weeks and help the um settlements of Judea and Samaria and I just think of where it says there were there will be Showers of Blessings um this is the promise of love and I really got to experience that I just want to testify because one thing he said we would be able to do when we come back is Testify the beauty of working the land for the children of Israel in their hard times and in their need and then it says there shall be seasons of refreshing working those Vineyards um what was a season of refreshing for me because I got to put my hand to something so precious to God's heart and I always wanted to go there but my friend said I want you to go there and you need to serve because you know we go on tours we see the SS we're touched but it says um sent from the Savior above I really think it was a Divine appointment to go there and be with them people and see the love of the land that they had and that um it says the Bible says Those Who bless Israel are blessed and I was just showered with blessings from them by serving them and I just wanted to share that with you that um it was actually kind of hard to leave because the needs are even more and actually when we were flying back we had a lot of turbulence I actually was more afraid of the plane flying back than being in the midst of the Land There was such a precious um protection there even though a lot of atrocities occurred um there are Miracles when you are in the blessings of God no matter what you're doing wherever you're at and I just want to testify that I love that you guys testify um out every place gives you that opportunity you know to do that and I just want to let you know that it was I hope to go back I don't want to be presumptuous that I get to go back but when we were in Jerusalem during the holidays of sukot I ordered some fish and chips and I was waiting you know for them to be made and I'm listening to the person um the pizza guy um and he didn't say this to anyone else but my heart you know wants to go back and he handed me my fish and chips and he goes I'll see you next year in Jerusalem I just wanted to scream praise the Lord but I'm like keep your cool thank you yep thus sayth the Lord know but I I just kept calm because that may not be How They Roll um but um what's also really beautiful is um we were part of hael they're a Tennessee family and they got soul and I was like you know I knew I wanted to come with Naomi to her church I haven't been to your church before and and it was so refreshing to know that there's Soul here you know what I mean it's refreshing like it's saying and this song just really you know spoke to me because that's not everywhere and um I miss it over there and I'm apprecia that I was able to come today and be part of that with you guys and so I just want to let you know that praise the Lord thank you praise the Lord praise the Lord we thank the Lord for that and uh and thank you for serving the people of Israel amen praise the Lord and uh uh back there on the on the bulletin uh brother uh uh there are some uh messages that I put up uh life story 19 19 1959 April 19 and also the message God uh brother brother Ariel uh working with the young people want to encourage us to be able to play those uh messages with our children and uh uh and they also have the uh uh time of uh Fellowship where they will they they will go through question questions and answers and different things but you see uh uh the powerful way one of the powerful way of teaching as it is in scripture is by examples no matter what we preach no matter what we instruct our children to do if uh if we are not making an example of it it will be hard for them to see the importance of doing that praise the Lord and uh and it's it's it's always a blessing and very important and uh when we can take time to read the Bible with our children listening to a message with them and and and be able to understand from their young mind what are they grapping from those words that they are listening to praise the Lord sometimes it might surprise you that they are getting more than you are getting uh sometimes it might surprise you or they might challenge you to go back and study the word praise the Lord so we want to encourage you to do that and uh uh there is also a prayer need here that we want to remember brother Wesley and sister Cara and that in service this morning because they went into uh uh uh their car got total by running into a a deer so uh uh they called me yesterday to let me know they won't be with us this morning and uh we also realized a few of the Saints are now here too but uh uh we are glad to be here and and ready for the word of God this morning praise the Lord so let's just

sated the good Lord bless you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning I feel uh greatly honored and a great privilege once again to have this opportunity to once again be in uh Minnesota I I think I've been here some years back about 6 years ago and uh so I know there are faces that were not that were here that we Fellowship together and they are not here anymore and then we still got the privilege by the grace of God to still have many of us that were here we were together some six years ago that we still here together to Fellowship this morning and then we still have new ones that we're meeting for the first time well I know I'm not part of you here but I don't I don't feel like a stranger actually no I don't I don't feel like a stranger uh God's people Jesus people are my people and Jesus friends are my friends and wherever people know the name of Jesus Christ I certainly am not going to be a stranger there and so that is why I feel uh very welcome by my friend here uh Pastor one I think U his min back in my church also back in in my country Nigeria and then uh I've uh since he came here I've had the privilege of passing by here and speaking for him once in a while I'm just I'm just just on my way I was just passing by but this about he about the only friend I've got left around North America here so I ain't got them many so I just thought it's not going to be good to pass by uh United States and then I I was just supposed to have a stop over on my way to Canada uh to have uh a vacation there and uh so but I just thought no it's not going to be nice if he was passing in Nigeria I would have said oh no it's good you pass by my place so that's why I planned it in such a way that as soon as I landed just spend uh maybe two days or so at New York then I find my way right here and then my go Grace within the week I'll be off to Canada and I'll be praying for you I trust you remember me in prayer the Lord bless you in the name of Jesus Christ God bless you my brother shalom it's nice to meet you and God bless you richly now um it's a Pity that the prophet of God said in the debate of life as it were I can't qu the exact words the word words of men are always more heard than the words of God and it's such a sorrowful situation that you wake up every morning you look and see everybody's hustling everybody's hustling where the brother the friend that I stay with in New York he lived on the 24th floor and I said that's my first time of living that kind of a place in my life like a bird you know and uh I stand there I wake up like 2 2: a.m. and and I'm standing and I'm seeing cars are still moving people still going to work just everybody's just busy every everybody's running and then you begin to think then you think of that poet that said I look and see that Sor picture the whole M for selfish gain there are toils of Earth all this movement on the road is nothing but for what for ease and comfort that's it every gasoline that is burned on the highway every car is moving every waking up by 4:00 a.m. and running is never for things of eternal life never when it comes to things of eternal life we get a nice sleep and wake up at 10 to 8:00 in the morning and then come around spend some 35 40 minutes in the church and that's so much you know we just we got bills to pay going to go to pay man has not begin to live by for bills you've just become purely animalistic who single the forest life the life in the jungle is basically Survivor just wake up every money and look for what grass to eat only to build up a body that will be used by lion that's all there's nothing the deer that is eating every day and getting Fir and robust and feeling nice where is it going to end up so human beings the devil has just so quick twisted our lives that we have basically become purely animalistic without even knowing wake up every day there is nothing about tomorrow life tomorrow where am I going after leaving here where's the next bus stop where am I heading to I got a few years to spend here those that live this same life 100 years ago where are they what happened to them where am I going we we just leave just run and run and run and run and things of eternal life just take second place in fact not TI of fourth place sometimes and they just about a soring picture the hold move just just just eat and drink for tomorrow just just leave just leave pay bill pay your bill pay your bill send your children know just pay bill just pay bill just pay bills you know and we just become Perpetual depts never free our Visions have become largely distorted what a break of heart it is to God that a whole man that I made have become a subject of what to eat and drink and what kind of house to live in you know when I'm what kind of car to drive that's how can I hold human life in the image of God be reduced be that is what you call decimation is decimated how can a whole human life be so decimated all it thinks about all he lives for all he works for is just EAS just to make life easier and more comfortable and at the end of it where does it end up gve you got more you got more time to spend in the grave than you spending right here now so true so what what's the end of it all so eternal life matters have taken backstage I I pray God helps us this morning to just what what your computer comes redirecting to direct the system to look the right way and relax ourselves and just let's just think about things of life things that are higher things that are nobler let's not just become animals just look at things that are higher things that are nobler let those things are aside let those things be the things we live for we think about because here we've got no continuous City ER seek for the one that is to come this party is soon ending see this party see this church you see all this it's soon ending if you don't quit it it will quit you what we have to do so we want to think on these things this morning as way I I got some things in my heart you know it's always difficult you know coming here you have a lot of things to think you know you'll be thinking oh man I got to get the shortest seron I have so that people don't get angry and leave you know you get a lot of things to think that you don't think back home in Africa you you you think a lot of things then you think of the shortest sermon and it's very bad should I should think of the sermon that is the will of God and not the one that is shot you know and uh then you think about that then you think uh of again how easy it is for you to get through it so I was actually having in mind coming here I thought today I was going to speak on a subject because we've got a lot of troubles around us I'm sorry for people that are maybe new Among Us and uh and are not uh used to our language please I pray you bear with me I'm a visitor here so your pastor will continue the regular sermon so I just I just got I just got this morning alone I was going to speak on Wednesday here again but I'm told I've been scheduled for hour to preach with brother Isaiah Brook so on Wednesday so I'm not going to so that effectively means I just have this morning to speak here and um so I you know so he's going to continue there but for me I want to address some things you know you know there's a way the word of God goes there was a time that the Bible said there were two disciples in the Book of Luke chapter 24 the Bible say there were two disciples that were walking on their way to a miles and they were sad and there was a stranger that came out and joined him and he said what Manner they were talking the Bible said they were talking about they were they were talking about all the things that has happened to them among them and in the city of Jerusalem around that time they weren't actually discussing about the preachings the previous preachings of Jesus no no no no no they were not they were so heartbroken they were so sad they were so confused as as a matter of fact all they have tried to live their life for all they gave their life for they left their country home of Emos and they have literally relocated and left their job to follow the man if you look at the conversation I won't have time to read all of that if you look at the conversation in the Book of Luke chapter 24 he said and we trusted that it could have been this man that would have saved Israel from his problems and now he's crucified and beside today is the third day so the Bible said they weren discussing the preachings that Jesus Jesus Christ has preached before they weren't discussing the wonderful Sermon on the Mount and all of that they were discussing about the current affairs the things that has happened among them and has saided it broke them because what they have devoted their entire life for has suddenly come to an end or so they thought and so the fils had broken and that was what we were discussing when this stranger joined himself with them but you notice this when he joined himself with them and they told him are you he said what manner of conversation is this that you have they say thou a stranger in Israel so if you're a stranger in Israel I pray you just kindly bear with me this morning yeah it's possible to be a stranger in Israel because we're in Israel now we're talking to the Israel okay you know the a sister just talking about the visiting is Israel there yeah that is what the Bible call the natural Israel the real Israel the Bible say not all that are Israel are of Israel yeah the the the tribe of Israel is actually not traced by the physical DNA Judas carried the DNA if you test the blood of Judas it's Carri and you test the Blood of Abraham you will notice that he come from that tribe but Jesus say you of your father the devil even though the physical blood is traceable to Abraham Jesus say you are not Abraham's seed meaning there's another way of reconing Abraham seed that is deeper and higher than the physical blood the people that crucify Jesus Jesus said you have the fire you have your father the devil they say we they say we are Abraham seed if you were Abraham seed you canot kill me he said because because Abraham rejoiced to see my day saw it I was glad Abraham rejoiced to see my day so Jesus provided another means of identifying Abraham seed and they call it the the test the proof of Abraham's seed is the belief of Abraham if if you saw if you were Abraham's seed you will see what Abraham See Saw and you will believe what he believes that is what proves you that is why it is said of the seed which is of faith of Abraham there is a defining characteristics of Abraham in the Bible the defining characteristic of Abraham is not ability to to breathe that's characteristic of General characteristic of living things living things breathe living things uh respirate living things you know those stuff you learn in the in the in the elementary school you understand that's not the defining characteristic of Abraham the defining characteristic of Abraham Paul said in the Book of Romans chapter 4 he says what shall we say then that Abraham our father has discovered he say it was Faith ability to [Music] believe what is impossible What God Says and there is nothing that declares it to natur let me tell you this you have four ways five mechanisms of believing either you see it to believe it you hear it there's only one thing that makes you to know that there's a brother from Nigeria Brother Francis that is talking to you this morning but you can see him and you can hear him if you can't see him you cannot hear him how do you know he's here what's a proof how do you know so it's your s your hearing the five senses that declare but Abraham got another thing that goes beyond beyond that when sight cannot tell you something when hearing cannot tell you something when feeling cannot tell you something then God can tell you that thing and that was what that was the defining character that's what makes him to identify the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ and he rejoice and these other people did not have that characteristic and that is why Jesus said you were not Abraham's seed amen you have your devil and yet they have the DNA of Abraham so if you are talking about the Israelite there this is the real Israel of God the B St Paul was talking to the church he say and now to the Israel of God the Bible say not all Israel of Israel the Bible say we take on the Seed of Abraham Christ by faith when we believe that's why the Bible say the Seed of Abraham shall be in all nations people are still looking for Seed of Abraham in jerus in Israel no no no no it's it has done pass It's All inde Shall how many families of the Earth you understand brother Bram say I am more Jewish than a Jew in Israel yeah absolutely all right let's leave that so what I'm saying it's possible for somebody to be a stranger in Israel so I'm sorry if you a stranger in Israel this morning you will bear with us uh I want to address some things that has happened to us Among Us of recent I was going to talk to you there has been a a lot of noise around around all over the Internet a lot of information a lot of information disinformation and Miss information Miss together yeah that's serious when you have information misinformation and disinformation all mixed together it creates a complex in which you don't even know which way to go and that is actually the program of Satan some people will not believe anything they simply say I don't know what to believe so therefore I believe none and that again is part of Satan's program right I don't want I don't want to to risk I don't want to risk believing the same thing so I end up believing none it's just like being given a a question paper and they answer and they given a question a b c you look at it and say I don't choose none I don't choose n is still wrong you still get the same zero as the person that chose the wrong thing so taking the idea of I'm not going to take anyone does not save you from the Wrath right so it's not an Escape Route we got to Jesus said we've we we we you you got the assignment that you must know truth it's not an option there's no option to it you got to know truth or you are done you are dead you are a gunner there is no option to knowing the truth we just got to know the truth and because that is our only way to freedom to Salvation now so there's been a lot like I said especially America is the base of every everything good to the Gentile World pram says a seat is an Israel of the Gentiles it's a seat of every every good thing that has happened as a matter of fact I took time to study all the inventions both scientific philosophical material and everything that has happened to the 21st 20th and 21st century every single one of them originate from America almost the percentage that goes come from any other countries they are negligible if you want to take all of these modern inventions of the computer the the the the the all those things are from here and what it is again the land where the truth that set men free the last move of God that was to free men and set them in order for the Rapture this was the land where he come from but I want to tell you also anywhere you find the right the wrong is always present anywhere you find the good the bad is always there I want you to notice this darkness is never far from light it's always a neor just watch it anywhere light stops that's why Darkness began they are neighbors they live together and so it becomes also every Force Hood every wrong idea every debasement as a matter of fact that was the absolute reason why brother bam under the spirit of the almighty God put a curse on the west coast of Los of California and he say he going to go down the ocean it doesn't matter what anybody think it stands quoting now so because of that when when you have all this mixed together it creates such a big problem that people don't even know which way to go so I was there's been a lot of stuffs out there in the news and on the on the net and all of that about the prophet about BR Braham about the message about all the things if you if if you just impute BR braham's name online the first set of people things that's going to greet you is how demonic he has been and all other those are the first things that will be flooding your your search engine and it's very it's always natural to want to begin when you Google it it happens to me the first one you you click on to start reading is the first one that appear first and many time by the time you finish reading the first one you don't you don't proceed and so you don't know the rest of the things that's there so this is the point now I don't know I not even find your watch why is the watch in the church oh thank you thank you so now where so this is how it works so because of that so I was going to because there been lot of stuff I wanted to actually approach the subject I titled was Moses on Mon sunset on February 28 1963 I wanted to take on that subject which people have taken and black all kinds of things have been spoken about and all kinds of things and I I wanted us to face it squarely we don't touch we don't touge facts we don't touge truth we follow facts where Le we're afraid because we know we' not believe we not believe conly divice fables if we are wrong we are humble enough and honest enough to admit that it's wrong I'm coming there and then I I thought on that then I look at it that hey this subject is going to take me a bit of time to to drive it through so okay let me leave it so I thought okay I was just going to talk to you on the last pH of this work this work that is going on the last phase of it and what will be happening among what's actually the state of things and why are things the way they are I wanted to speak on that and then that was what I prepared in my heart and then as I landed on Wednesday morning slept over the night the news that greeted me as I woke up on on Thursday morning is that the son of our beloved Prophet brother Billy Paul has gone to be with our lord said I said oh hey we're in trouble I said hey we are in trouble here because our cousins the twins our twin brothers that uh what you call I think you go online they call it living the message or ex message Believers I don't know whether you're you're familiar with them they call them living the message ex message Believers which has become like a Club International club with the headquarters here in America and uh and and Canada and then so and uh we I have a say back home when they started with with believe this sign because when believe this sign bug bites you you develop a Jun Callin syndrome and John Callin syndrome uh almost has no cure it's a particular is a particular strain of unbelief it's a strain is a particular strain of unbelief that is peculiar only to Christians belie of the message Christians that believe the message of brother William Braham and that unbelief works like this destroy William Branham at all cost kill Maline anybody that has any news against him accept it celebrate it anybody never mind facts never mind truth just keep on the attacking line because look at it this way it's it's a strain of of unbelief that is particularly allergic to William bram's name he has a serious allergy once he hears and it's mostly I was listening to your Sunday school this morning when B Brown was preaching and he was talking about that a woman was a judge in a particular City that woman has no business you know teach that take that to CNN and broadcast it by tomorrow morning what do you get 1 billion dislike unfollow him what unfollow and the internet will be a Gog what kind of a human being is this nobody is going to ask what does the word of God say no no no no no no no no no no nobody's going to ask what does the Bible say what did is he saying something different from what God Said in the Bible nobody's going to has that everybody's going to Bas on reasoning and they're going to be pouring all listen just that statement alone pick that statement alone just cut that two paragraph and put it on any international news and check by tomorrow morning is going to be labeled as the greatest disaster that is worse than Hamas and that is the how the strain the strain of the John Callin syndromes works it has a peculiar hit for the name of the ministry of William Bram let me illustrate it for you like this if to the John con syndrome you know why it's called John Collins syndrome now I don't want to take me back John Collins was the like the founder of that move he was the son I think the grandson is it the son of grandson sister it was the Grand brother uh Reverend Collins was the pastor of brand Tabernacle that he was a Deon where Brown was there and his son yeah was the one that had the polio very serious case that was almost there that was supernaturally healed during the preaching of the Seven Seals and then that his song had a son who is now John Colin who was with in the brand tacle for many years and over the years for some reason can't cope the teachings of the prophet of the Bible is not for everybody you need to carry the specious train and Gene of Abraham to be able to believe and follow this not everybody can cope with this thing it's not meant for all it's not meant for all it's the message of Moses was is that is why you will never check your Bible you are never going to find anywhere in the Bible that says and the Lord spoke unto Moses and say speak unto the world go and check it in your Bible and produces for me where and the Lord spoke unto Moses and say speak unto the people of the world where is it was Moses not a prophet of God to the Nations you never find it you will hear where the Bible say and the Lord spok un Moses speak unto who the children of Israel his message cannot be received by the world was not meant for them don't receive a message that was not meant for you stay with the one that's meant for you so Moses message was never meant for the world Paul's messy was never meant for the world no no no no no it was meant only for a specific people the elect of God that's what that's what for and that's exactly the way it is with brother it's the same thing he he he speaks to the elect it say he was a messenger of God to gather the elect and if you don't have enough Faith to become that you are one of them it's not really sent to you you don't have to be there you don't have to come there you don't have to be part of it it's not a problem the Believers of the message is a tiny super tiny minority to the so he started the move to reel out anything and everything against the person of brother just like some people have the move you know go go online to reel out any and everything against Jesus Christ they said Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene they discover his grave he really did not this thing he really did not it's there all over the place yeah that does that make Jesus Christ to be forse he make nothing he don't mean nothing God does not as a matter of fact open a website to Define himself have you seen the website of God where you now query him what about these allegations they put against you he didn't do that because he has warned you there is only one way you are going to know things about me and that's our Mystic just because in America anything you need you just turn to your iPhone hi Siri hi Siri which turn am I going supposed to make at this point and Siri is going to talk to you you also think if you want to know the road to Heaven you also say hi Siri how can I get to heaven well you think you can also do because you are so used to Sir answering so many questions of natural life you also you've trusted it so much until you think you could also say hi Siri what can I do that I have eternal life what can I do that I may not die when you Google to find God and things about God you get opinions did you hear what I said you come up with what opinions opinions may I tell you the internet is a vorum everybody vomits anything there is a vomitorium did you understand Jesus Christ established the a search engine before leaving check your Bible he says search the scriptures are you looking for peace search are you looking for God do you want to have information about me whether I am true or I am false search the scriptures you cannot you cannot use something to search me that I live before that thing was invented it doesn't make sense may I say it again it doesn't make sense to look for a search engine that was invented after I had lived and died to now use that to find out about me and you rely on the information there as absolute truth that's nothing say that is unfair that's wickedness that's Injustice and I want to say the entire system is unjust against God against the truth against the message against the prophet that's right so I so when I wake up I said God I say ah this thing that has happened our cousins our the twins of our Revival they have a feast now this going to be a serious Feast for them oh my it's going to be a serious feast and that is the reason why have you noticed something I'm going to read the scripture now have you noticed something for so many people once they heard it's a big disaster that has happened to us because our ranks are been depleted we are losing soldiers and they basically not replenished we are losing a gener a precious generation that we haven't seen the youths that are in that mold to carry that fire I want you to ask yourself if in 50 years to come brother one is no longer here brother you no longer here What Becomes of this church right what happened is it all this was up is it all this was up guys and that man Jesus you know is it those kind of you want to carry the fire of this R the church will simply die look they're going to die when a system is losing its old and is not replenishing with his young right that system is nearing Extinction liation that's why I want to think so it's it's a big disaster that happen to but have you noticed whenever you go on a hunting on a Hunting Expedition to kill somebody to destroy somebody you lose love and you lose feeling the death of Billy Paul is treated like a saw dust as if it's a saw dust that has no feeling people are rather using it for debate there's no feeling I if to say it's a sest all you mostly what I hear oh he said this brother said this one is debate debate nobody thinks this brother has family he's got children he's a wife he's got loved ones there's no empathy how many of us when we heard he died bowed our head how many of us how many of us bowed our heads and said God thank you thank you for a while a life that was donated for the furance of this message we it saddened yes that is lost and there's nobody to replenish it how many of us take time to pray for the family it's all about debate on whether sharks are flowing are swimming in Los Angeles or not has covered the thing and that is Christians have lost feelings and when you lose feeling you have lost love when you lose love you lost God and with you lose God you have lost the direction to Heaven you got no part with god brother Bram say nothing will enter there except perfect love you can't have love without having feeling so let list our Force you know David in the Bible he lamented when Jonathan died he said David the Bible say David cried he wept and David said how are the mighty Fallen how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war destroyed he said oh Jonathan you were a mighty man of war he said how are the mighty fallly he said tell it not in GTH publish it not in ascalon you know what is GTH GTH is the same lineage with Gaza they are all Philistines tell it not in gath publish it not in ascalon he said L the daughters of the world Rejoice the Bible say they will rejoice at the death of Jonathan why David was busy lamenting doing lamentation some busy I can imagine John cin believe this sign now they saying praise God didn't we say it we said it they were they are jumping yeah yeah prophecy has failed now we are proven to the world that will is forse and all kind of nonsense is going down and David said tell it not he said L the daughters of he not the daughter of Israel the Bible say he taught the daughters of Israel lamentation right lamentation is what we have our enemies are the one rejoicing in somebody's Calamity and taking somebody's failure to mean their success you don't need somebody to fail before you are promoted you are just being Wicked oh you know because you fail the exam you want somebody else to fail so that you be the you miss the question you want the other your friend to miss you so you'll be the first position you are wicked you are Godless if you have God you will wish your neighbor the best sir even in the face of your own failure that is Christianity and I tell you all of the soal believe this sign folks and Liv in the message have no feelings you cannot be a Christian and producing evil work if your belief is good your deed will be good yes sir it takes an evil belief to produce an evil wishes but L the enemies of the Cross Rejoice I want us to take up the subject we're not afraid he brother Bram told a lie and prophesy fely we want to say it that he prophesy fely did you hear me don't be scared we at home we're not afraid of facts we don't Dodge brother Bram said when you see a he didn't touch didn't teach us the principle of dodging facts and dodging truth if brother say when you see a man dodging scriptures Dodge that man Dodge that man is very dangerous so we want to take the subject I want to do this so that the faith of the Saints can be established I cannot brother Bram said study the problem of the people and begin your sment from there I cannot do justice to this message by going to teach some other things where there are fundamental questions that is afflicting the church and people are getting confused even though they don't talk how many churches are closed in the United States can you count them have you heard a Catholic Church Clos how many churches of Catholic you see they say he closed let's say brother Bram message was wrong is he as wrong as Catholic I'm asking you is is he as wrong as that but have you ever seen that the church cannot close we did the last how many years from the testimony you imagine big big name big churches in America close down denounce the message what theyve lived for for years denounced it call the prophet on printable names and all of that and they they lost their faith and so many of us that are not talking is working underneath our mind you got doubts you've heard things you got doubts you got fears you're just trudging alone you can't move like that let us lay the fact down I just pray I got the time my brother oh anyway I'll do the I'll do the bit again anyway I leave it it's fine but it's not a thing that I must let the background of it for you to be able to go so that is why I want to talk to you I'm not just really preaching this morning I want to do a talk there are certain messages in the prophet's message you hear they were really not titled by Brother Abraham you hear him say talk on the word I want us to have a talk this morning I want to address your faith because the faith of so many are shaken shaking I want us to address these issues I want to find out let us lay the facts down what is the truth of this matter is it what is this message worth believing or we're just deceiving ourselves let's be honest with ourselves we ain't got too long to stay around here we cannot I can't be telling myself lies I'm I'm going to 53 how many days have I got to live on here for me to not be fellowshipping on lies that will not take me anywhere I I got to tell myself truths my candle is more than half burned so want to take these things I want to give it talk to you and I want to just simply title it now that our brother our precious brother Billy Paul the son of brother Abraham is gone as a matter of fact Joseph has very little memory he was just 10 the real person that has all the facts was Billy he one among some of the last soldiers and he has laid down his armor and he's gone to rest now that our precious brother Billy Paul is dead that's my that's what I want talk about what what about the prophecy of the sharks swimming in front of May Company in Los Angeles and what about the California earthquake prophecy a lot of ministers have preached these things approached it and it has destroyed the faith of people I just want us to let us pick the things separate the we from the chaff and then you can draw your own conclusion God bless you let's stand precious father I know this is if you don't help me Lord know where I'm standing Lord I won't be able to get it through Lord and yet it's burning in my heart for the people got to know the truth of this matter I need your help Lord to be able to condense these things and yet leave nothing out that will be helpful to their people because your your Bible said have not shown to declare unto you the whole councel of God please help me and help this church our aim is to help to strengthen the faith of the people confirm it Grant it Lord in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you let's turn to the Book of Luke Chapter Luke chapter 1 I'm going to read from verses 1 to 6 Luke chap 1 veres 1 to 6 and then I'll take another reading from the book of Acts chapter I'll take another reading from the book of act chapter 15 all right I want us to listen to the reading of the word for as much I wish I got time to give you the background of this man Luke The Physician that wrote this book Luke this is the out of the four gospels two were written by direct Disciples of Jesus that were one of the 12 the other two Mark and Luke is the second book that is written that people that were not actually part of the original 12 but they were part of the larger group of disciples but not of the 12 they were part of this other 120 that was in the upper room now listen for as much as many I want to give this as a basis for my subject for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are surely believed Among Us brother things that are what surely believed and among not just believed surely believed not among the world Among Us it's not everybody verse two even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning I want you to notice the kind of people that wrote this thing eye witnesses God does not rely on we can't rely on testimony of people that went online yeah they head from them that head from the that head under the law they unfit to be listened to you got to give testimony of a true witness were you there did you see it so I want to see how God God was so mindful of his word and the kind of people he allowed to pend down these things so that there will be no doubt because we can serve God you can serve god with doubts in your heart he can work the little B of doubt that is in your heart will eventually lead you out like a LED lost wife even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were I Witnesses and then what Ministers of the word to be a minister of the world it going to be what eyewitness now we got ministers that are not eyewitnesses what are they going to minister listen so because Luke was not of the actual 12 disciples he has to write it there because God wanted to let it see even apart from the 12 disciples there were still others who saw and knew and testify so he said it seemed good to me also Luke oh I love this having what had what perfect understanding now if you check the Greek word translated understanding here is not our English word the Greek word translated understanding here comes from the word to follow closely and be present when something happened maybe let me illustrate it like this so that you understand why I use the word understanding a lot of people are passing this people place this road there's a road directly here they know this church but they don't understand this church they know it to understand it you have to come under it that is where you get the word understand from under stand under and know that's right that's why you get the word understanding they know the chur they don't understand it to understand you going to be under it be part of it feel it see it then you can tell truth about it what is the guy that is passing here every morning to walk what's he going to say about this church he's going to say they are just just group group of Hermits they don't talk to nobody they just alone to themselves they don't just a cake people you know they don't earring they should be Mark they look like CST and they look yeah that's what going say he he knows the place but he doesn't understand it and so what he's going to be saying is nonsense and once you can pour it on the internet people will be reading it and conclusion so Paul sorry Luke says it seems good to me as is prepared by God it seems Godly to me good is God having had what perfect understanding of what all it is not partial all all things from where from the very first from the very first the word translated from the very first is deeper than the word from the time it started no no no no no no no it means from the first CA from Source from above go and check it go check it when you get home now to write onto D in order most excellent theophilos if you go to verse one of the book of act you're going to see this same name there theophilos nobody actually know who that guy is history does not nobody no history I've read a lot trying to find out history does not know who that guy is but suffices to know you know what that means theophilos means Theo is come from the word God phos love it is those the person who God loves oh God I don't know whether you getting my point nobody know what got but it is to write onto the most excellent Theos most excellent the brothers and sisters whom God love didn't that's is he wrote it to us whom God loves that doubt why God does not live in doubts that is what the songwriter say my my heart has no desire to stay where doubts arise and fears dismay though some may wish to dwell with this my prayer my a is what Higher Ground so the the purpose the heart purpose of God is not to be writing to be making people is the message true are we sure are we sure no no no no no no that thou mightest know that thou whom God loves that thou sister whom God loves that thou brother whom God loves mightest not live in uncertainty mightest what know what the certainty oh Hallelujah the certainty of those things wherein you have been instructed we got to know the reason why God Ser is that we may know the certainty of those things that has been told to us and now I want to stop here while you got to see there was listen now there was in the days of Herod have you noticed how it started there was not I was told I read I Googled right there was I was there there was in the days of Judea are certain not some a certain certain it's not an uncertain a certain priest named Zacharias of the ca of her and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth God bless you that thank you sorry sorry for keeping you standing I just just need to get we just need to get this thank you all right thank you God bless you you know we just need to get these things have you noticed this then let's turn to the book of act chapter 15 let's start from verse one let's see the contrast let's see the contrast to this this brother said he seemed good to me he seemed good to me the Lord placed it in me because good is God to write unto you you may know the certainty let's go to act 15 verse1 listen close to this and there were set came men which came down from Judea look look at they come from BR tacle Judea was where Jesus came from Juda Judea was where Jesus basically did this his last face of his ministry the tpol was in Judea and there were certain men who came from Brown Tabernacle who came from Judea and taught the Brethren they started what have you noticed it's a teaching they established a teaching system okay they had churches where they teaching they were dishing out these things and taught the pren they were trying to teach the church and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved meanwhile salvation is alone is in Christ right in other word they are overthrowing the faith of people they make Jesus unnecessary and they are returning the people back to the very thing Jesus in fact they cancel the work of redemption they destroy C it's a simple this teaching was very simple but the effect is to cancel the entire bed life work death burier resurrection and future Promises of Jesus is to CR CR it out that was the effect of that teaching now that's serious and when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them have you noticed this Paul and Barnabas did what cont this is why some people say why are you talking like this we have to contend with them Paul and Barnabas are Ministers of Christ they cannot sit down and pretended as if nothing is happening I don't want no problem just believe anyhow they didn't tell the church to believe anyhow let me tell you this you can begin your Christian journey by believing anyhow you will not go through it by believing anyhow you got to know to believe anyhow we no work it's not enough anyhow I believe anyhow cannot Rapture you it's enough to take you out of Egypt but he will never take you to the promised land we got to know the certainty of the things whereof we've been instructed and when Paul and B that's why you expect us you expect our Our Generation people like CRA one stand against it we can't fold our arms and behave as if there's nothing going on as if the people are healthy our churches are not healthy people are in doubt people are in fears people are uncertain they will be backsliding our churches will become empty as the year goes by if we don't stand like Paul when Paul therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them can you see no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and to the and Elders about this question right and when therefore sorry move on move move move please and being brought on their way by the church they passed through finess and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and cause great joy unto the all the Breen they were going to Jerusalem let's go all right four I'm going to seven and when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the Church of the of the Apostles and elders and they declare all the things that God had done with them okay go and there are listen this is where I'm going okay but they they declare what God had done and they said but there are certain of the sect of the Pharisees those guys were actually Pharisees who did not belong to the message but were moved into the message by the enemy to do a curse they were Jesuits they never really were converts they never believed they never belonged there can you notice this brother among the disciples this is the first early Church of Jesus Christ this do you let me let me do you notice that Paul himself was a Pharisee Peter was a Pharisee why didn't the Bible say and Paul a Pharisee the real strain and gen of Paul was not Pharisee he but this guy were original say Judas real church was the Pharisees he only moved to the message of the hour for crucifixion of the message let me tell you something no Revival has ever died as a result of persecution from outside persecution from outside only strengthen it every Revival has been killed by the children that raised in that Revival a generation that raised there and KN not the Lord that's right that's right because when they have stayed just imagine me I came to this message when I was 16 when I was 16 I've lived practically all my life inside here I've been preaching this message possibly since I 18 I'm 53 now almost by November just imagine I putting about 40 years I've traveled length and wise defending it and I suddenly turn around and say you know what if anybody supposed to know this thing I'm supposed to be the one you know what I found out I knew all along this guy is false he the devil what do you think happens to the my church what do you think happen to the people following me what do you think happened to the world they will say you know what you know how the word judges cases it's an unjust world they would say if it's an enemy outside then we could say maybe it's a maybe it's not true but if this person who is an Insider can say these kind things therefore means it must be true that is how the world judge if you judge it like that unnown that it is the kingdom of God that suffers elect do not plant spice among non-elect amen it is we that the Bible said the enemy came to spy our Liberty it is we that suffers M wheat does not grow get shot among test it is test that come among wheat to distur and to distort it so these guys really were never par of it one of my very close friends who has in South Africa who has invited me as a matter of fact have been their Church they have put beautiful big big revivals special meetings wonderful meetings BR one has been there I have been there very close he has spent and has been spent for this message he has actually invited me to this 40th year anniversary of the ministry of Malachi 4 in his life and 60 years next coming year I Was preparing to go he just came now he has caught John cin syndrome and he that he denounced brother he denounced the message and callaham on printable names for me to repeat some things he said will amount almost to blasphemy what do you think people people people said all of his followers how many many churches are gone so we we we we we need to purse and find out so this I want you to understand the Affliction that is bef falling us this we are the elect we are the one that have weeds among us to SP now the Bible say these people were originally who Pharisees who came in among us to Lear away until they mature enough to now let me tell you this explosions don't don't fully destroy something is implosion when something implodes from inside he has no chance of Survivor he can hit it by an explosion he can survive and this is why the devil seem to want to implode it but let me tell you this no matter what the devil does whether he likes it or not you can't kill this message look look even if me even if me brother decide now to start curing it it will only use me as a stepping stone and continue it is indestructible because it is godall we want to find out so sir so I want to I want to quickly call your attention to this you know so many of our Brethren they try to be diplomatic with this case and you know I I listened to one of the ministers somebody somebody was quoting one of the ministers in my country yesterday to me he said you know what me I just believe the message me I don't go and be studying prophecy and I don't go I just believe even if brother bram's prophecy concerning Los Ang or concerning swimming even if you fail may I still believe that sounds ni ni and I know a lot of people say yeah it's nonsense I will prove it to you in the light of the message of is this complimentary to God Hand the message what are you talking you think you think God allows you think God is helped by life listen oh yeah you know what even though he's prophecy fails me I still believe I believe anyhow you are lying let me tell you this when I have problem in my country I don't bother to die 999 if you guys have problem here emergency I think is 999 H 911 sorry sorry all right when you guys have emergency here you have some hijackers or somebody with armed or you emergency Health crisis you die 911 I don't bother to die it in my country you know why nobody will come it doesn't work you know why you call it here you know why you call it here it works you can't trust a system that does not work human beings are not design to believe in something that is failing you you can't if this Prophecy of the message is failing and failed just one of it brother Bram said if one that is if one of this thing fail he say it's all a failure in God's economy 99.99 accuracy does not work right because that little percentage there will introduce fear and it will make it you can't trust something that has possibility of failing and then you rest your soul on it it's not possible so you can't tell me when you say even if the message of yah fails I still believe what where you get Faith where you get it you think faith can rest anywhere faith can only rest on something that is failing proof yes sir am so it is a defe attitude it's a lie of the devil it is part of Satan's program to claim that even if he fails I still believe it you are being dis complimentary to the message you are disgracing to the message you are disgracing the message and as a matter of fact you are working for the enemy you are part of our enemy I am telling you if there prophecy or anyone failed the entire thing is a failure let's close it so I want us to examine the facts I'm sorry I can give you all the quotes where the Prophet mentioned it you don't say if you fail here if you fail here no no no no

things that God has told us if you notice braam never say I said he will say he said he never just go and check it when people come to him say what did he tell you he wouldn't tell you what did I tell you he said my words will fail because I'm a man God's word won't fail if he fails is not God has spoke it all right that's right what we do know brother say say what the tape says so somebody told me he say Hey you know hey hey hey you know somebody asked me oh hey you know say shars will be flowing bip will not be an old man and shars will be flowing FR where is the prophecy now I said hey I said just a minute I said oh I'm not aware please can you tell me where I said it I said I'm not aware listen friends I have read all of brother Abram's message from 1946 to the end I have read it this way I started taking it back this way and taking it front this way so you can't tell me a lot of a lot of people I've heard preachers people say I said you are lying he didn't say so it's a lie he didn't say so anybody say anything PR say he didn't say so so I said I beg you to tell me where the pram said that sharks will be flowing in the street of I said show me he was looking I said where is it I'm not aware I to see it say say what the tape say he didn't say it after B died right it was not an after thought he said it 1963 so you you you you going to tell me stories that oh yeah you know because he fa that's no no no no no no no no no no so now I want to say again further that brother bram's deeds and words were never done in secret as we are slanderously reported you know Paul said he says we are slanderously reported it is we that suff slander we slander no man yeah we slander no man it's a slander Paul say we slanderously reported I give you scripture we you know the prophet brother abr's word he didn't work in secret everything was open brotherr said my life my all my words are clear and clean before Uncle Sam he said said I got no secrets nothing to hide nothing like leaked I I I I saw one John Collins the other day I I just I don't have time to read all he said secret T of William Bram mistakenly leaked such deit search somebody it it's all lies but say let FBI braam did not practice behind he everything was open this this was when America was America it was everything was open if there was anything fake he would have been debunked there were so many other preachers there that were jailed you remember they jail a is a they jailed him they jailed them the government jailed them for producing something that is not real that's true and he was right there so what are people talking about so I want to see now I want to say this not anywhere did let us get the record straight don't fly loose just calm down not anywhere directly or indirectly on tape did Brother William Bram ever mention I said directly or indirectly that did he ever mention anything that sounds like shars flowing or swimming in front of May and Company or even did he didn't even mention that in if California sinks sharks will be flowing he didn't even say it not nowhere now let me let's get the record clear if anybody could speak on the message I say I have I not only read most of the messages F by reading I listenting to them many of the people talking and listening to a cter they follow nothing I've devoted my life to this thing the book of my life I gave my Life as a youth to this thing and I'm ready to die with it I've told God lock the key of my soul with the message of William Bram and throw it away I don't want to find it my case is done gone finished it's my choice you can make yours listen listen I want to make it let us get the record clear not any way did did directly or indirectly it's only Common Sense Listen Now it only stands to reason it was only simple application of common sense that we Breen do that if now there's no doubt about it when I'm coming to read it that he prophesied in 1965 said God told me and of course if it doesn't come to pass it's a first Propet absolutely he said God told me California will go under the ocean before the coming of the Lord the hole will go he say God told me may I make it clear there's nothing mentioned of shars go back and listen or anything it's only common sense that we people used that if sharks are in the ocean and the oan floods the place it naturally me sharks will be swimming there it's only common sense they were not words of brother Abraham don't use what he doing God don't use frivolous statements he precise now I am not by this please I want I want to be I want to I'm sure I'm on record I want to be put right straight on record you know what because there my friend in South Africa you know he through a challenge he called bra all kinds of name real all kind of funny Oh my he say so many things he say I have challenged all the preachers to come and defend William Braham lies he said none of them could face me he said he wrote it is a writing I have it he say I am going to report them officially to the South African government end time message to the South African government for profiling and they're going to classify it as a terrorist simple Christians that are living I'm turning hoodlums and wicked people to to become good citizens and I will now be placed on the same roow with heras and esbah and Al shabab is not wickedness KN that once you report such to government you are actually assumed guilty first until you prove yourself otherwise you are not deemed to be innocent you are deemed to be guilty yeah it's like a case of a husband and wife in United States wants your wife report you you are first of all assumed guilty until you prove yourself innocent we are supposed to assume you are innocent until proven guilty that is how God's word law God's law run not the other way around Injustice listen so he said I'm going to report them when I saw the the bre death sent it to me I looked at it and said oh my God what's this it's a very known brother to me friend I said okay you know what I left it then I came back again something took me back there again then I picked it up and I wrote him I have I have I have the conversation I said why is this threat so fast to report just like the threat of Nebuchadnezzar why is it so fast I said give thy servant opportunity I'll meet you I said you know what I say I'm telling you brother you want to prove William Brown to be false or anything no problem I'm ready I said I your I I thy servant I meet you I said I thank God I have a lenty visa to United States have a lent visa to Canada have a lent visa to the UK put the debate anywhere I don't want to go under the excuse that I cannot pay I will pay my fair and I will pay for my hotel bills and everything I will meet you even if it's on CNN and tv anywhere let really it out and let's face facts with facts and with scriptures and let's see I told him I'm waiting please set the date I got me informed I'm still waiting for it it's been months now he say you know brother and you are my friend I respect you I really didn't mean it like that I have his words here okay I we going to get back to you he told me he was going to get back and yet he went online to Blackmail the message and yet he promised to get back to me he never I have this as text so it's not something that is is not ver to deny that is just the way when they can't stand truth it is only backbiting and you know what backbiting mean biting from the back yeah you bite him from the back you can't face him listen so I want to say this now may I get say this and get it on record I am not by this claiming that what bra narrated was a lie never oh my I forgot I wanted to display but I I give I will cite it for you so you can read it I'm not by this trying to tell you that brother bilip Paul statement I've listened to his testimony and is go to the message go to act of the Prophet by green is documented there so and it was written years back so it cannot be so it's not something that they adjusted after he died last week no no no no no no no so brother Billy Paul said I'm coming there I I I'll come there to tell you what he said I am not by this when I tell you bra never I'm just trying to set the record straight he never mentioned anything like that directly or indirectly does that mean that what bra Paul said is for course no I'm never by any means conjecturing that and what where lies the truth we're going to come to it I want you to First of four brother Billy Paul said in 1965 in 1965 April 29 when brother Bram Bram in company of so many Ministers of the Full Gospel businessman La William deosaran and so many people they were having some special meeting in California Los Angeles and brother Brenan was to deliver his sermon that evening he was to deliver the message he was to be the one to preach in the evening in the morning was another preacher that was preaching he was on the platform sitting down and prior to that sister uh Florence sharan had had a cancer case and was almost dead when and brother Brown was a personal friend of the sharian and they contacted bra prayed for her and told them told bra demons that she she won't die she's going to survive this particular Illness but she will not live that was a private stuff now it's not on tape now it's all reported many years ago written down in book all right that sister Florence will not live to see the coming of the Lord but she's not going to die for that she's going to take survive that and sister Florence survived that cancer attack and came to that meeting and in the morning meeting of that day of April 29 1965 sister Florence sang a very inspiring special in that meeting bra was sitting on the platform and when when when she left H the record it's on record says that bra brah nudged brother car Williams that was sitting with him I said can't you see how she's going and he said where he say toward the case of Heaven that was a private conversation and immediately after the sister a thunderous speaking in tongues came from the audience and the pro and gave a message in his tongues and immediately there followed an interpretation which said Daughters of Zion and he was so vivid Daughter of Zion that was talking about sister f sharan That Be not Afraid thou shall leave to see the coming of the Lord directly contradictory BR Bram did not even move but bil Paul was in that meeting I'm giving you the background to the story so we know the truth there is only one way you can defeat the enemy is to know the truth it's not just to say anyhow anyhow I believe what is the meaning of anyhow don't believe God anyhow you believe God by truth all right then after that meeting bilip Paul was very disturbed it was in the evening of that day that brother Bram preached the message choosing of ab Bri where the prophecy of Los Angeles now came out now so Billy Paul and brother BR were walking on the street were together and Billy was so could see that Billy was so agitated so Disturbed and brother Bram was said is all documented to have asked him Billy what's what's the problem Billy Paul said no nothing Daddy and they were going and he called Billy what's what's the matter with you he said Daddy you had didn't you hear that prophecy but you had prophec you have said this is also all of them out of not on tape you've also told Brother demon sharian that this sister will not live to the coming of the Lord but the prophecy said she's going to live to the coming of the Lord and B said brother Bram told him Billy all I can tell you is that the angel has not told me anything different it was in the evening of that day that the prophet now I want you to notice they are the two are not connected that is February sorry April 29 oh God I just pray God I hope you're not tired please please just pardon me I I will not be here I I I I will go I I will not be here please pleas just pardon me I we need to I need to put I can leave I can I can drop it it's not it's not a problem to me I can leave it but I just want you to know so that your faith can stand unshakeable and it's only truth alone not foolish belief listen it was that day that was on April 29 that was the evening of that day it has nothing to do with sharks now that the prophet gave thus said the Lord thou C that called by name of the Angel you will go under the ocean and say Market is th say the Lord is finished going to happen it was that evening in iay now fast forward to September of that Year brother Brown was again in Los Angeles his last series of ever been in Los Angeles before the Lord called him home he was again there for another set of meetings that was the day he preached power of transformation you can check it in U September 9th sorry September 11 1965 they were together brother Bram the day he preached after preaching power of transformation in the morning afternoon they were together with bilip Paul on the streets of Los Los Angeles and then they got the news that sister Flores sharan whom the prophet spoke about has just passed on to be with the Lord then the prophet say hold on they should call back and check what time because the angel told him it's going to be between 2 and 3 what time and they phoned back and said 3:45 a.m. sorry 2:45 a.m. so that was just so he and Billy were was that not what the Lord said can't feel listen and while in that conversation was where B remember the prophec of had happened April nothing like sharks or anything then they were together that afternoon in September these things are if you go to Pages go to pages one 109 to 119 109 to 119 of Act of the Prophet written there it was not written after B Paul died they couldn't have published a book after all perig died so how could have written a book he was written many many years ago all these things were documented so we are not defending anything and may I pause to tell you this somebody said defend brother Bram may I make something clear to you can you defend defense can you guide can you guard God I know g u r a d God can you guard God can you protect protection can you protect protection you can't may I make it very clear there is nothing like the defending brother Bram brother needs no defense truth cannot be defended truth defends itself anything you defend is a lie that was why you notice this have you noticed when Jesus Christ Jesus Christ say I am the way I am the truth I am the life have you noticed that when the Lord Jesus Christ was arranged no defense came ordinarily when you to be charged for treason as he was charged and killed they asked for defense the Jewish law required defense have you noticed nobody came Jesus nobody could stand to defend him because he was truth you can't defend truth right truth defends itself that's right he is truth he defends you know so the say my message is perishable and is not through it will perish and I will perish with it if it is the truth he said you people watch it it will be exactly that way he won't F he will stand out after all the critics are dead and gone he will live right on he will March right on right on right on nobody a't going even if this church decid that we're not going to believe you don't look let me tell you this Heaven is not aware that you around yeah it's American government that make you important and you feel you know you know you feel big you know you know I've noticed when people in advanced country they feel important you know they feel that God should consult me if he wants to do something and discuss with me you just feel you men don't realize the Bible say what is man he didn't say who is man what right what what say what what's man the Bible say when God weighs the whole world not just you alone he said the world is lighter than vanity in weight it's a privilege God give you to come and serve him you are allow it's I want to understand you young people you don't threaten God I a going to serve God again I'm going to leave church to as if you are somebody you're you're nothing the world is not aware that you are around you are in significant you Heaven is not aware of you God is only kind to you to invite you who are you a thousand of you die every day doesn't move nothing yes sir and millions of you are D every day he move nothing he mean nothing my God my daughter sent me a picture of this Earth that was taken out out of outer space the whole earth I don't know if you've seen the picture out of thank you out of outer space do you know the Earth is so small it's not up to the point of a pain until you the whole earth until you can't even see the Earth in the universe the whole of this Earth not you now it's like very T they have to highlight it for you to see that is the whole earth so who are you not you be thinking that you are somebody and you feel important I'm not going to serve God again let them Close Church on time I don't know they're taking time too much and yet if Biden invite you you you you feel important if if the CEO of Apple you to have a meeting with him everybody in church will know you will hang the ID card here and all of that it's a privil I want us to understand it's a privilege that you have young people is a privilege it's a privilege to serve the Lord there is nothing out there in the world nothing is emptiness there's nothing to live for there's no life there I know what I'm saying friends so it was in the evening of that day that brought up so he said bilip Paul said now all this are of the Bram down asked him as they were discussing that matter said the atmosphere changed remember brother ask him Billy where are you he said downtown of course where they were he said downtown Los Angeles he said he asked him two two more times where are you being more specific and he said he told him in front of May and Company he a very big departmental store please can you shoot it for me I have we've gone online to search the information out so that you will see that we are hiding nothing this thing is not written is written by the company it's not written by us it's a very used to be a very big departmental store back then I don't think it's even there any longer you could see you can Google it yourself you understand no no the the the main this thing that contain the picture all right okay so I I I want you to see I I want I want to see so he told him in front of make company that company isn't I don't think it's not even there again that that is where we are standing Daddy he said daddy told me this is it back then this is their we they are the one so it's not we I got nothing to do with it when to search it you can search it I given the materials to this brother you can go online search it has nothing to do with believer no no no no no facts you can see it the on online Museum North American Independent departmental store the museum holds all sort of information about classic department stores which either no longer exist this one does not even exist any longer or or are change beyond recognition a few of them are still with us and provide an interesting connection to North Americans rich past the others are presented so that they can probably be remembered as a tangible part of our life to their customers so this is where we went to this is why the brothers went to check all these things and then they had a chat room for all the people different different question and memories of former staff people that are there now we're going to go through it down so but for the meantime I want to hold I just want to see that we have not follow conly devised Fables we we we we dealing with facts and truths we got nothing to hide we are not I was telling the Breen if the American government know who I am they don't need to interview me for Visa because they don't know me if they know who I am they don't they don't have to interview me I ain't going to stay in their country they don't need to nothing to fear about me I don't belong here I'm not designed for here I don't belong here there nothing to fear you come you will not go back I'm going to go back absolutely absolutely so what are you interviewing me for what are you passing me through stress for nothing I am not of them that get Visa and have scorned no sir no sir so is we are we as true men we are not fakes we not F we we we we we tell truth something has happened in our hearts we have gotten a connection with the Lord Jesus Christ and he has changed our lives praise be to God all right so he said thank you you can close it for now he said I'm coming back to it he say sharks he told him we in front of and can see that that big is not even there any longer you won't be an old man and may I make it very clear brother Bram said from 25 your youthful days are over and say from 45 you're an old man direct statements I can read it for you Billy died at 88 as a matter of fact at the time he was giving those testimonies he was already an old man yes sir so how do you balance it you got to be honest is bram's words I got the quotes down there 45 say I'm an old man old man and he said bil it told Billy you will not be an old man until sharks be flowing in this place that was 1965 Billy Paul was about 25 no Billy was 1935 was 30 years old Billy Paul was 30 years old that time all right now I want us to bring I want to bring it down so that we can see the lines so that your faith can stand strong now but I want us to understand something so I am not and we are not in any way claim claiming the B lies against nope but what we are saying is it is the placing of the prophecy and the interpretation and the placing that is the issue we are not debating he didn't say it and we are not debating that will bilip died an old man what we are saying is the we are talking about the placing and the interpretation and I want to make it clear let's begin from scripture I need to read certain things to you here to be able to know what is the truth of this man brotherr spoke all these things long years ago so it's not going to be an afterthought second Peter chapter 1 verse 15 let's begin please oh oh oh oh oh oh oh this is hurtful I wish I wish I don't have to go elsewhere I want to preach on on Wednesday but I'll try my best it's just that I don't want to miss any fact I could just please second Peter chapter 1 ver1 15 I want us to get the template for scripture interpret prophecy interpretation listen close moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able to after my decease to have these things always in remembrance Peter knew that after I'm dead a lot of things going to happen not know a lot of things going to happen I dead for we listen close for we have not followed canly devis favors when we made known unto you the power of the and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but but we were what ey Witnesses of his majesty continue pre 17 for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice from him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with me in the Holy mon hold it let's pause a little bit according to the John Collins and the belief sign this time people because this particular thing that happened or Transfiguration is not recorded in Times magazine so therefore it didn't happen yeah that's what they say they said they went to check the newspapers then it was not reported so because it's not reported so because it was not reported in the paper the day I arrived United States I didn't come to United States at all it there's no record of it it's not there in the papers it it's nonsense what the Bible use is what you we must base braam on Bible basis of verification Bible uses word eyewitnesses did you notice this which newsp I want to ask you did you think they didn't used to write stories and newspaper in the days of Jesus they do have you read Josephus they do they write records do you know there is no place Joseph there is no history nowhere that ever mentioned that there came Moses and Elijah Transfiguration and that Jesus was transfigured before that is never recorded So we we assume because of that it does not not happen right okay if I may ask you I don't know if somebody oh BR one what is the name of the great what's the name of the father of the father of the father of the father of the father of your father what's his name I don't know you don't know the death for means you didn't have the father of the there's no there was nobody that born the father of the father of the father of your father because it's not on record oh yeah that's how he works because you don't know that means it didn't happen what a foolish What a wicked way of drawing conclusion this thing was not recorded they used to have record it was not recorded you can base things on that list let's let's go please I just I just need to drop all this information oh oh my and this voice came from we also have listen now we also have what a more sure word of Prophecy whereby ye do well that ye take he oh God as unto what a light shineth in the dark place until the day down and the day time arising in your hearts okay knowing this fact this is where I'm going I want me and you to establish the scriptural way of dealing with prophecy knowing this F there are no prophecy not a single one is allowed by God to be of what any private go and check the word private there is personal you can say to me my take there's nothing like your take on a prophecy right it's not allowed there's nothing like to me never it's not bra that wrote this things this is the basis in which bra is to be tested that is where all prophets are tested you can't use T magazine to testam we must use the same Time Magazine to test Moses why you talking now knowing this F that no no Prophecy of the scripture is of any any any private interpretation for the prophecy did not come by the will of man if it was man that said it man can interpret it but because holy men of God were what speak as they were what so it will be the speak normally the person that has the bra interpretation of a thing is the speaker of the thing how can you give Samsung to interpret the manual of Apple how do you do that so I want us to understand according to the scripture this scripture removes ability to interpret that prophecy and place it even away from bil Paul not even bilip has the right to say this is what it means this is what it means I've he look listen I heard him in testimony saying that I'll see that I'm not an I'm not a old man yet I heard it according to brother Bam from 45 I want you to understand this is why somebody wrote to me the other day I got to say some things brother br I'm free yeah you you pre to my church you were free okay all right yeah yeah you were free okay thank you now somebody called me two Saturdays ago in Nigeria he say you know he said brother I want to just tell you that we have received instruction from Brother Joseph Brenham that all the bride all over the world they are to listen to a particular tape on a on this particular tomorrow and in the evening of tomorrow all of us everybody all they elect all the bride in their home supposed to they should keep communion in their homes I said oh my that's so I said is that so he said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh I said I said when did I said when did BR changed the program from Brother Abraham said by the grace of God I will I'm directing the bride of Christ straight statement I can show it to you I said when did braam change the program to say it was now believe oh sorry Joseph Bram directing the bride I said when I said you know it's a it's a prophet I I said I don't answer my question when did the prophet change it I some people think they can use bra William Joseph bram's name to threaten me you can't threaten me with Joseph threaten me no no no no no no no no no you you can't I don't fear I am commanded to fear only what the Prophet said I said Joseph Bram is pastor of Bram Tabernacle he's not my pastor he's a minister he a we are colleagues we are brothers he he pastors his church I Pastor my church he is not my pastor he can direct if you're a member of brah Tabernacle he can direct you he can't instruct me no no no no no the prophet Alone look when I have the prophet's word for something you can't intim at me by nobody you got the right to be afraid you are free not me I have wanting to fear the word I said when did he change it he couldn't tell me say you know you know just reasoning and a lot of churches are closing because of that and all of that stuff like that don't go to I I don't know I I'm not interested said th say the Lord I am leaving the field after me there will be nobody right and I said let me tell you something there is nothing like Deputy eight messenger and there is nothing like assistant Prophet messenger that position does not exist or vice vice leader of the Bride there's nothing like that it is the voice and br br said the opening of The Seven seal put a final fo stop to the New Testament say what has happened now there can be no further advancement may I say it again I said the pro I can give you all children you can get I get give you the quotes there can be no further advancement so he can't Advance nowhere this is the final thing I said so you can tresen Me by any of those things when did he change it he talked he couldn't he all reasoning and this you know once people are looking for physical leader I will prove it to you that's adolat listen close so I want to understand we verify what the message says no prophecy that prophecy not even Billy Paul has the right to interpret it according to the scripture and let me prove it to you now please the word of God Is So set in perfect Precision that no human being is allowed to give his idea and his this on a prophecy is of no private oh God if I read all these quotes we're not going to live here today so I'm so sorry I'll just give you brother Bram said oh God wish I can read them more he said visions and prophecy he say when Visions are given they have to be interpreted visions and I'll give you the an example BR give this example for instance when Peter saw a vision of a sheet coming down and all kinds of four-footed Beast you remember the vision right that's a vision if you look at that Vision it look like God is going to give Peter some animals to catch and for for dinner that's what if God left that that was just a vision if God left that Vision alone it could he said but no when the minute came it means that there was actually no animal the animal is not going to come down physically it just means that some people are coming they are Gentiles and I have Sanctified them they are holy go to them don't call them Unholy that's the meaning so you could see Vision a prophecy must be interpreted there was a time Abraham saw a vision concerning judge right you can get it he saw him with a grave he said I don't know it needs to be interpreted whether judge right he was sick either they digging his grave to bury him or it means that some people were making fun of him for believing in Divine that he is going to bury them he said I don't know which way it mean it got to be interpreted say visions and prophecy itself that there is a vision for something does not mean he can he must still be interpreted and no church member including Billy Paul can ever brother bam said the interpretation of a vision is the Fulfillment of of that Vision oh God please not it down I think I should read this one can you be patient with me all right thank you please give me 64 tape number 64 0205 paragraph 14 I want us to I could read it I want us to see it together this is braam spoke this in 1964 he said Visions prophecies must have inter now let me give you another one why they searing tape number 64205 just trace it out 64205 paragraph 14 64205 paragraph 14 okay now did you remember did you remember the vision of this constellation of the seven angels that the prophet saw in 1962 and narrated in s this is the time I reproach for the cause of the word do you remember did you remember in that Vision BR ABR says Joseph was with me according to div Vision it's in S note it down it's in s which is say is this is time which is 62 1230e paragraph 2 no please don't open that one just open the one I'm I'm just giving them to note it down open the one I give you open 64205 but you don't need to open just not this one now 62230 paragraph 206 you can that you can get it there braam saw a vision of the constellation of seven angels coming down from heaven and there was a blast in tuon he saw he was in tuon and there was a blast and and he saw that Joseph was standing by his side in the vision now and the blast was so heavy that he said no human being can survive that blast and bra say oh my it means I'm going to die I must not tell my family when listen now when the actual if bra had not announced it in 1962 people would have said he lied when the actual Vision fulfilled in 1963 Joseph was not there Joseph was at home they were in Du Joseph was in school was in school what happened God told incest is this the time he say the reason why you are seeing Joseph in that vision is to show you if it was a blast you are thinking you are going to God you would think you are going to die that does not mean your if the you did you remember in that Vision when the blast happened to you you you were hearing Joseph a small boy you were hearing him talking he said that Vision if that blast would have killed you it would have killed Joseph also Joseph presence in the vision does not mean when it happen I don't know where you get my point it will be there it just is to show you that it does not mean your debt that is how he this is why he preached Revelation book of symbols this is a book of symbols this is how he works Canal does not work here these are not your words leave the things to for be interpreted by the person that spoke it I want you to understand you were not the owner of the prophecy you can't tell the meaning it's unfair for me to have a dream and you are the one interpreting it for me you you can't all right please can you give me can you give me are you there right please listen to this God is his own interpreter he don't need anybody to interpret for him he does his own is that not what Peter said in First Peter he does his own interpreting who is the man not even B PA that can interpret God God is his own interpreter 15 15 oh praise the Lord oh brother I love the word of God it solves 15 paragraph 15 please paragraph 15 paragraph 15 I need 15 please all right I I can continue while they looking for it so I'm trying to let you know the principles oh okay thank you he said now Peter speaking here we found out in the beginning Peter when God said let there be light and there was light that is the interpretation to it listen when God said anything and it is manifested then that is God's interpretation of his word it is not me to say this is when it l it happened that is the interpretation all right when he said let there be light that was his thinking first before there was such a thing at light and he said let there be light light sprang into the sky that is the interpretation nobody has to interpret that for God said so and there it was when God speaks and it's manifested that is in the interpretation of the why can't men see that why don't people see it this is the same problem here why are men not seeing it is when he speaks it in manifest that's it you do not need somebody to say I'm going to no it may not ever work the way you ever think I want you to underline it why can't men see that why don't people see please give me the slide or the this thing on that preaching the video of it I wanted to play it why I go further excuse me I want to listen to this it's a short video now okay thank you this was years before now about two brothers spoke on spoke on these things and I am going to when you listen to this video I will now give you the physical from the website of Mayor Brothers I will now give you where they reported it by themselves the fact that you are not aware does not your awareness is not does not mean whether something is true or not right you know I'm just going to deviate here I'm just going to talk about something you've heard the testimony for years and years and years you know so Mr rler you and your husband told some of your goat friends about the California earthquake about what Billy Paul said won't be you won't be an old man when sharks will be swimming here I know cuz I received emails from them telling me we were told this by Ivan and Barbara many years ago we've heard the story told how brother brandham spoke to his young son Billy Paul after the prophecy in Los Angeles and said Billy where are you standing said well I'm standing here in the front I'm I'm in Los Angeles he said no where you standing he said well I'm right here in front of the May building he said bil he said you won't be an old man when sharks will swim here you know we have ideas of how things are going to be and people have built doctrines and thoughts now we look at brother Billy Paul is 82 so this Bo pre be 82 years old well he's by definition an old man he says three scoring 10 and the 10 extra so how could all this be let me just give you some information in the 1970s brother Charlie Spencer that's brother Ron Spencer's father and his wife sister Spencer they were in their kitchen like many of us did back in the day listen to Paul Harvey news and in the 19 in the in the late 1970s or somewhere mid to late whatever it was I don't know exactly the date but he reported there has been an earthquake in Los Angeles and then he spoke of the May building and that the resulting flood from the earthquake had brought in sharks that were swimming around the May building this very story was also confirmed by a member in brother Jason Watkins Church his sister this brother's sister worked at the May building and they were given a memo a warning do not go into the basement because there are sharks sing in the basement sometimes we get things figured out yes sir and things have already happened yes sir for brother brandham supposedly cuz it's not on tapes I say supposedly according to brother Billy's testimony said there would be sharks woming there and I'll tell you if you're waiting on them they've already been there God bless you and he wouldn't have know it's okay fine thank you now did you remember after Jesus came his disciples came to him ah you are the Messiah was Moses and Elijah not supposed to come he said they've already come and you knew it not prophecies don't come with sirene announcement CNN does not broadcast prophecies they happen in such Simplicity as to full people and people will still be expecting them when they are already passed and gone now now some hardened people will still not believe this now I'm going to open please open that this thing I showed you on mayor brother that is online you can get the link from him and go there because let me tell you this to those that don't believe no proof is sufficient but to the Believers no evidence is necessary you can convince them but I just want the Believers to understand we do not followly devis fables these are facts please give me that particular the one I told you to bring out for me yeah I I want I want to I want to see it and then I'm sorry you give me a few more minutes I'm going to run the timeline I'm i' I've given it to you by video I'm going to give it to you by their website of of American departmental stores because that particular thing is not even even no longer there and then I'm going to give it to you by quotes so you will know by three ways is proven beyond a shadow of doubt if anybody wants if anybody wants to be ignorant let them be ignorant this is our faith this is what we believe we owe no man no apology now in that departmental in that departmental store is a whole lot they they run these things you see October 2017 so you know that it was long ago 5 years ago bip was still alive okay there were previous to this you will see if you go there you can take it and run it they started from 1950 something the people that W there they were talking about sorry they started 197 80 something and they were making chat people was send question they will answer different people that knows what happened we answer so I we just I just cut this one from the big chunk of things so you could see the other things there somebody ask October 19 2017 into into this place hi I hear some rumor sorry I wonder if you could help I heard a rumor that there was a flood in the May Company building downtown Los Angeles sometimes during 1970s and sharks were supposedly swimming in the basement is there any truth to this this guy is just people volunteers that were there this guy said there is no reference I want to notice the way he put it there is no reference to a flood or shars and make company in Los Angeles Times archives okay I want you to notice how how it is the AR of Los Angeles Times don't say so therefore it didn't happen they archives of the Roman Empire did not show that Jesus resurrected so therefore Jesus never rose from the dead the archives did not say that Mary mag Mary was conceived as a Virgin It is not reported in the paper so therefore it did not happen if such a thing as a virgin [Music] conceive virgin a virgin come amen Brethren a virgin it has never happened before a virgin conceived wooden news have carried it so since no news reported it so therefore no it didn't happen you judge you yourself this guy wasn't there he said no reference he Mak in Los Angeles it was probably an Oran leg you just imagine somebody will just sit down and cook and say sharks are flowing with does it make sense just imagine somebody just sat down nothing nothing at stake he just had to cook a story there were shars flowing in the street of milap and people will be debating it as telling the story does it make sense so nonsense it was probably an orand I'm reading both sides so that you will see we have nothing to hide around the time of the popularity please give me the next slide give last slide another person asked December 2017 when the person read it I ask the question again please did the shars swim in the May Company basement during the California earthquake did there have let me tell you this according to the American I have the website here uh I think of Geological Survey more than 10,000 earthquakes happen in California every year till now in fact there's no day without earthquake they said the reason why it does not show is that some of them are on the Richer scale just two on the Richer scale so it was not over it happens all the time many times it now did the wat came till May Company downtown Los Angeles please let me know this person writer said that he didn't didn't say I read this somewhere he say yes there were sharks swimming in May building basement this was confirmed by a coworker this were workers there at the basement this was confirmed by a worker there at that time a memo this is what his brother was saying because there are some Believers that were walking there back then but their voices are not heard there was a worker there at that time the M was sent to All worker to stay out of the basement due to shark swimming this is the one that F scripture the Bible say ey witness it's not about I didn't read it somewhere somebody a did not report it and so is it everything the newspaper reports many of the reports are not even so this is it I am saying this that we may know now I've given you the last please let me give you the last proof I want to tell you friends it is a case of misplacement of Prophecy Billy Paul was still a young man at this time it happened exactly think linking it with the earthquake of Los Angeles is human thinking the two prophecies had no link we never connected Satan connected it for mischief listen close there are no connection and let's go by scripture Matthew chapter 24:34 Matthew 24:34 I'm sorry I know you don't stay this long but uh just a few minutes more minutes I'm I'm going to get through Matthew 24:34 please I'm sorry I just I want I want us to read this Matthew 2434 and it says this generation shall not pass please this generation verily right I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things are fulfilled have you read what Muslims and other critics of the Bible said about this scripture they say Jesus prophecy failed Jesus said this generation shall not pass until how many all but do you know the meaning Jesus did not he's talking about the generation that shall see the victory right that's right not the generation he was talking to but human being that are taking it for private interpretation and do you know Jesus knew they said it he didn't bother he didn't answer him he doesn't need to defend himself how do you accuse a man that is dead when you know he's not there to defend himself what a world Wicked World listen they say he never fa he was talking about the generation so if was accused he was not the first to be accused Jesus was accused before him of the same thing I may ask you how will you I give you this as a as a as as a homework how will you explain when Paul say and we which were alive for the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and we which are alive so where is Paul battle with that batt when you find solution to that then you can come on accuse braam listen then let's go to let me give you the next last scripture before I get you the last strength of quotes act sorry John chapter 21 this is very important please don't miss this this is very very important John chapter 21 from vers 20 is very important the Bible said Paul was everywhere confirming the faith of the people we are confirming with let the people know these things are truth we not following lies we don't need to help Abram's failure no there's no failure nowhere this is absolute truth if this me brown's message is not true there's no truth in this world you could as well close and forget it there's no truth nowhere if you leave this message you are finished there you are going nowhere way there's no truth nowhere John chapter 20 sorry I said 20 or 21 John 21 verse 20 now why you are there I want you to understand something that the the post Resurrection Ministry thank you please let's follow I want you to understand if anything and everything Jesus ministry suffered brotherr Ministry of necessity had to suff it because it's the same Ministry this is Bible then Peter turning about said the disciple whom Jesus loved following that is John which also leaned on his pray at supper and said Lord which is it that betrayed thee Peter seeing him said to Jesus Lord seeing the disciple that was leing on the breast of Jesus Peter asked another question what shall this man talking about John which B say was leaning on Jesus breast do you by the way do you understand that Jesus has been accused of homosexual being a homosexual because they say John lean on his breast these guys called brother Abraham homosexual I'm telling you just imagine that just Wicked hit listen Peter said seeing him said to Jesus Lord what shall this man John which is do listen close Jesus said unto him if I I will that he T till I come what is that today follow down me go to the next verse then there went this say not just locally internationally online the all they are cheap blackmailers they cannot use signs and wonders and the demonstration of Jesus Christ to project their Ministry they work online they can't end their trust listen they went the same where abroad I please don't forget this among who was it un believer let me nail let me point out something to you did you notice may we know this do you notice that the post-resurrection ministry of Jesus Christ never happened among unbelievers oh my come on don't you understand don't you understand oh you're going to make me to take you a a bit longer now I'm not the cause of this you the cause of this one yeah because because you you because yeah you're the cost of this one now because uh you are not uh uh you're not uh you're not following you can because if I leave it it will look like we don't know what we are talking about okay do you know this this happening here was after Jesus resurrected so you know that this was after Jesus resurrection now oh John 21 after he resurrected dead Peter say Peter asking who betrayed thee oh come on this was after Resurrection did you notice that oh my please okay don't don't change this because I don't want you to take our time please let somebody open your Bible and read for me act chapter 10 please because it takes time that's why I want read for me act chapter 10 please start from verse 38 it quickly to ver one somebody can read fast can read very I want it to be I want it to be loud for everybody to hear yeah verse 38 to 41 but Jesus said unto them no act chapter 10 act chap 10: 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost uhhuh [Music] uhhuh uhhuh and we Are Witnesses of all things which he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem okay and H on a tree uhhuh goded up day uhhuh not to all the people not to all the people do you no this when Jesus rose from the dead dead people did not see him but to who but unto Witnesses chosen before of God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from after he rose from the dead the whole of his ministry no unbeliever saw him it was all among Believers how come please get let's get back here oh please I told you how come the Brethren here were the people people that were part of the Brethren the Believers of the message that went and misunderstood the prophecy and was narrating around that listen and that when they s abro among the Brethren these were only Witnesses chosen these were Disciples of Jesus Christ how did they get it wrong let me tell you B PA anybody can misunderstand any prophecy there there is none of all that has immunity to misunderstanding that yourson does not make you immutable listen this were witness is chosen be and listen the Wendy say abro among the abro among the that the disciple that that disciple should not die yeah Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that eternity like come what is that to the can you see it bre I want to see it Believers got it wrong Believers got this prophecy wrong ministers got it wrong it's nothing to do the are preachers preach it doesn't make it truth Believers can misunderstand only John tell them this is not what he said do you think they will believe him it was Satan behind his thing because why Satan know that can prove one word of Jesus to be FC he will collapse the entire F of the people and Satan knows if I have time I will take you to another scripture but let me stop it there Satan knows that if he can put proof one point of a failure of the prophet's message your faith and my faith gone and when our faith is gone our our reality and our glory is gone this is the idea now to first of all to finish it up God bless you thank you for your patience I'm I'm sorry I don't I I I don't enjoy I'm the one struggling here I don't enjoy keeping anybody gain anything from there I just want to you to be helped I want your faith because a lot of things are flying you will hear plenty things I want that you may know what is the truth and that you may stand solid and FM
