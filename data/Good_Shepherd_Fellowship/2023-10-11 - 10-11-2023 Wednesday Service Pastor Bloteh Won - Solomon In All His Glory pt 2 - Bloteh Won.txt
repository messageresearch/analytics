we' been good friends way back from the the beginning of uh the uh the message group in Liberia and uh uh actually the brother John BBE that just left us for part of the original group for the matter of fact uh if if if I would be right in the history he was one of the first one to receive the message in Liberia and uh uh uh and we want to thank the Lord for that so just like brother Dan said the to put uh the feral on the Thanksgiving weekend that Saturday uh normally we don't we we do try to uh cancer our uh midweek service on Thanksgiving week so we have our Thanksgiving service the weekend before Thanksgiving to uh allow people to be able to enjoy Fellowship uh with family in France but uh the the jibi family is asking us to to uh uh use uh uh the Friday night they want to do like a Thanksgiving uh service before uh the Saturday uh than giving or weight keeping service or something like that where they can be able to bring their tributes and uh uh so as as we work with them on uh on the ples that for that weekend we will let you know so they are thinking to use the Friday right after Thanksgiving and uh uh so we will keep you updated if that if that's things if there things so um uh brother uh doc Baker from uh tson Arizona uh he grew up in a military family and I think his uh dad saor in Minnesota during one of his uh service in the military so uh some part of Minnesota yeah he grewed up and from the time we met always desired to come and visit so uh he just got back from South Korea uh last week actually he was supposed to do the uh last weekend with us uh but he was returning back on uh on the fifth from South Korea so we canceled that service so we will be having him on the last weekend of uh uh October and that should be the weekend of the 28th and the 20 n so we will have a uh brother dog Baker that weekend uh visiting with us and then we have a a friend that is also passing through uh brother uh Francis from uh Nigeria he's uh passing through the States to Canada uh he's actually flying into New York but uh uh want to come over to see me good friend of mine so we will have him the weekend of the 21st which will be not this coming Sunday but next Sunday this weekend is brother praders uh uh annual meeting in uh uh for SMI and uh uh actually brother William was using this route to go over to F Smith Brother PR to invited him so he and myself will be driving over for the meetings um uh um we will leave probably tomorrow evening if everything works well with the plan the services starts on Friday at 7:30 so brother PR ask that uh we keep him in prayer uh I thinkk uh uh they've been kind of for working on their uh either AC system or some uh preparation they are making there but they want us to keep keep them in prayer and uh it's been a while that uh brother John Reagan daughter Erica has been uh battering U uh some health challenges so all through the day today there have been text message going back and forth asking for

upon us our life praise the Lord amen realizing that I'll be gone this weekend so I just uh choose so to uh uh speak to you a little bit tonight and uh brother William will be going over to brother Flint uh to pray for him on the on the Thanksgiving so maybe on his return He will stop here and maybe he might do a Wednesday service for us so uh [Music] uh if that been said let's just stand to our feet tonight and U there's a chorus that being on my mind I can't now let's just sing the chor of Jesus you are the center of my joy there was something else that was on my mind I can't [Music] remember [Music] let's sing it to him [Music] tonight yes Jesus you're the center of my joy and all the good and death comes from [Music] you you of my content men who fall oh I do oh Jesus you the same center of my joy if you feel like that tonight yes Jesus you are the center of my joy all that's good and perfect comes from you you the heart of my contentment oh for all I do oh Jesus you the center of my one more time now sweet Jesus you are the center of my joy oh Lord all that good and death comes from you you the heart of my contentment oh for all I do sweet Jesus you the center of my joy what the musician softly play I want to read this uh brother Brandon said in the message a way to have Fellowship praise the Lord I was just uh listening to uh that message and he said this it was such a blessing to me I want us to read that before we go into what we want to share tonight but Bram said I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual [Music] gift I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I did rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church now that might sound hard in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is gift they will fill where there is gift they will bring confusion where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and if you had perfect love you did have perfect gift that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gift Paul said in the book of Corinthian I will show you a most excellent way he was speaking about gifts and he says let me show you the most excellent way that is the last verse in the 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and then he goes into chapter 13 which is the love chapter so the most excellent way for every gift the foundation is love amen if you love God you will never struggle when your gift comes on a question if you love God you will never struggle you will never have complex of uh manifestation of gifts or something like that no that's why brother brandham say he said first start with love first work with love praise the Lord can we bow our heads together tonight and just pray that the love of God will be our portion May the love of God be a portion to this church I would rather have a church that knows nothing about spiritual gift and that is just so in love with each other and with Christ in love with the word in love love with the word in love with the message in love with Christ I would rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church now that my sound hard for the Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is love it will fail where there is love it will bring confusion I mean where there is gift sorry where there is gift they will fail where there is gift they will bring confusion where there is gift they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and if you have you have perfect love you did have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gift let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus upon this word we want to approach the service tonight oh God our Father you will just come oh Lord God and Eng grace us with the love like Paul says the love of God spread about in our hearts by the Holy Ghost that's what the Holy Ghost brings to the church Lord it brings the love of God father I pray tonight oh God that Lord you would just you will just bless Lord father this little group oh god father Lord God on 6900 humble Avenue Lord God Brooklyn Center father Lord Jesus what we really need Lord is the love of God in our hearts Lord It's the love of God father that cover the multitudes of sin it's the love of God oh God that is stronger Lord God father than our weaknesses oh God I pray that love of God that will constrain us Lord God to

tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you musicians you can have your seat amen thank you for the music thank you for the singing tonight let's take our Bibles praise the Lord first king I don't know if this will bring the close to Solomon in all of his glory but we want to go back to that tonight first king chapter 11 first king chapter 11 chapter 10 we look at the the Queen of Sheba and uh First Kings chapter 11 praise the Lord but King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughters the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites zidonians and the Hittites of the Nations concerning which the LA said on unto the children of Israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods Solomon cleave unto this in love and he had 700 wives princesses and 300 concubines and his wives turned away his heart for it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David his father amen let us pray together father we want to just thank you tonight Lord and we ask your blessings that Lord God you would just uh come Lord bless your word tonight in Jesus precious name we pray amen the Lord bless you you can have your seat we'll take uh uh again uh uh that verse over amen we take that verse over there in Matthew chapter 6 Matthew chapter six like I said we want to we want to uh continue on our talk Solomon in all of his glory praise the Lord amen Matthew chapter 6 verse 28 and why take he thought of raymen consider the ladies of the field how they grow how they grow they told that neither do they neither do they spend and yet I said unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not array like one of these praise the Lord amen we look at Solomon Glory we look at the glory of the temple we look at the glory of his throne and uh uh the amount of wealth he was sitting in and gold and and precious stones we we we we look at the glory of his uh herses and the food that he ate we look at the glory of his wisdom tonight we want to look at the glory of his wives Solomon in all of his glory praise the Lord amen before before we start there tonight identify Masterpiece brother brandham said and I want to read uh on our subject before we read that tonight uh uh did you appreciate the message on Sunday Amen in the presence of in in in his presence praise the Lord I think that was the title in his presence amen you appreciate the message we thank brother William for that let's give the Lord a hand of Praise amen you know the reason why is that uh uh the the the the house of God and and the preaching of the Gospel is a kind of a supernatural thing and I believe that every service build a foundation for the next service praise the Lord amen because brother William said something on Sunday he and myself we were just fellowshipping on that and I told him I'm going to stand on that tonight to preach amen amen so uh uh we were just Fellowship shipping on that and and uh uh uh I really didn't have much much time to spend with him so I went to pick him up directly from work and took him home to go and get ready praise the Lord so brother Bram says here in identified Masterpiece I will have to go faster just to be able to keep up with the time tonight and uh uh I hope uh I don't want to keep you I don't want to keep you long I hope nothing will make me keep you long praise the Lord and uh hope it will not be a vain promise to brother Bram says Jesus said one time consider the ladies and yet I said unto you that Solomon in all of his glory was not a raay like one Solomon in all of his glory was was a magnificent sight there's no doubt he was a great thing to the word and a great man before God the man that God will says I will give you wisdom that no man before you have ever had or no man after you so if Jesus will say he's greater than Solomon than Jesus Is God Amen praise the Lord that's what one of the scriptural proof that Jesus is God or else God will be breaking his word because he said there would be no man that will have such a wisdom there was no man before you there will be no man after you so it has to be almighty God in flesh amen he was a great man he was a great thing to the word and a great man before God but Solomon Rob they didn't have no life in it it was a piece of material probably sh off of a sheep back praise the Lord so you see where brother bham is holding this this balance that we've been looking at through the scripture and through the different courts Jesus himself is the one that is bringing Solomon into reverence he's referring to Solomon and saying there Solomon in all of his glory in all of his glory not part of his glory in all of his glory so Solomon Glory was in as much as it was an attraction to the eyes in as much as uh uh uh it was mind bluring to the minds of the people the glory of his wisdom the glory of the Tabernacle everything was in order that he pleased God that the the shakana glory came and and hang in the in the temple of Solomon in all of the glory Jesus said it was temporary it was a glory that could be fed away the Bible talk about in The Book of Corinthian the glory of Moses Moses have such a glory that that the people couldn't even look at his face amen and yet Paul Paul was the one that de with Moses Glory Jesus is dealing with Solomon Glory but Paul in the book of Corinthian help us to see that even though Moses came down from the mountain and the people could see the brightness of his face but yet Paul make us to understand that that was a glory that pass away amen it was a temp temporary Glory it faded away which of course also he was bringing to the church that we are having interal Glory praise the Lord you know the way he said it he said it thatth you are having internal weight of Glory you love the Lord amen amen praise the Lord what a wonderful wonderful Jesus we Ser let's look at 2 Corinthians 4:17 let's look at 2 Corinthians 4:17 a little bit yeah you go back he talks he talking about our our trial he talking about the different things that we go through but he brought it in a very beautiful way here that's what I want us to see because you you'll be able to understand here praise the Lord 2 Corinthians chapter 4 let's let's read from verse 10 it will give us a little background year always bearing about in the body in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which are alive are always delivered onto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death WTH in us but life in you we having the same Spirit of Faith ACC calling as it is written I believe therefore I have spoken we also believe and therefore we speak knowing that he which raise up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sake that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many uh redone to the glory of God for which cause we faint net but though our outward men perish yet the inward men is renewed day by day praise the Lord and as we studed the Temple of Solomon the outside of the temple was made with water what we can remember the outside of the temple which material which mineral was he M with praise the lord we can remember BR the outside of the temple was made with BR the inside was made with gold that was what we saw it in the scripture the outside of the temple was made with Brides because Brides represent judgment so Paul is bringing the same thing here ourly we perish we go through lot of things we go through lot of Trials hourly for for an in of Glory so the the even the physical Temple of Solomon the material that was inside the temple had more weight than the one that was outside are we together praise the Lord so he says uh uh for which cause we Fe that but though our outward men perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light afflictions praise the Lord Paul is saying no matter what you are going through it's light when it get on the skill of God is light no matter what you are going through no matter what job went through no matter what every man born of a woman will go through he says it's a light Affliction for our light Affliction which is but for a moment is temporary work for us a far more exceeding an internal weight of Glory so on on the skill of God your your your trials is here your internal weight outweighted that's why it looks like your trial is high up I'm just being tried it's because your internal weight it has your your internal Glory has more weight praise the Lord amen amen if you put two things on the scale the one that have more weight will go down the one that is light will fly up that's why your trials are flying all over the place because they are [Laughter] light amen and the internal Glory that is waiting for you have more weight is solid it will never pass away it will never fill out praise the Lord amen our light reflection don't never forget about this verse write it in the back of your mind no matter what you're going through is light amen the reason why it's springing up is is like is swallowing you is like it's overcoming you is because it's light praise the Lord your internal Glory has more weight praise the Lord while we look not at the things which are seen but are the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporary Solomon Glory could be seen it was temporary the glory that was on Moses face could be seen the people could see the brightness that they couldn't even look at his face it was temporary that is the emphasis that Jesus was bringing in comparing Solomon with the lady is that one one Glory was temporary it captured the whole word everybody that came around saw and said wow what a wisdom what a tabernacle what a temple the worst part of it they say the worst or the better I don't know which one and yet he had 10,000 women around him is it West or better oh you go home and and judge judge that one yourself praise the Lord but it was all temporary temporary in the sense that it was a type God allowed it because it was speaking of something better Solomon Temple was speaking of a better Temple praise the Lord his throne of God was speaking of a better throne are we together so we want to we want to we want to just we want to go into that a little bit here tonight uh so like like like brother Bram said here he says uh his uh Solomon Rob didn't have no life in it a piece of material probably shared off of the the Sheep back but the lady had life what we need today is the Life of Christ inside of us now what is outside amen it's inside the trials are all outside the outside of our Tabernacle is made with Brides because Brides can stand fire Brides represent judgment right that's what our body go through different trials and different things there outside of the Tabernacle is made for brides this body brother bam said we we B pass our T so we can be tempted so we can be tried and while we are tried on the outside the inside the internal Glory the inside character of Christ is being built inside of Us Praise the Lord amen hallelujah are we together amen so let's run through that but the lady her life what we need today is the Life of Christ inside of us that's what purify not the outside to turn around colge or a degree of uh psychology or something it takes the power of the resur of the resurrected Christ to make us what we should be amen God has no other plan than let the Holy Ghost Rule and reign in the church and what did Jesus said the Holy Ghost is in you amen the Holy Ghost is in you there is no other Glory that is more powerful than almighty God tabernacling in you praise the Lord you can go through your mind battles and go through all the Temptation and sensation of your flesh but you know by faith that there is God in your heart praise the Lord amen sometimes we go through all of these trials and temptations and you know and and sometimes you feel so filthy to yourself pray praise the Lord and you don't even want to believe that you have the Holy Ghost you don't even want to believe that that God is in you but you see the the reason why is because you have not seen the beauty of the inside of the Tabernacle praise the Lord amen when Israel set set up the T the Tabernacle uh on Moses the Ark of the Covenant was in the holiest of holy but there were days where storm came and and and a Hil hailstones came down and snow came down and and whatever came down it did not defy what was inside the holiest of holy right praise the Lord so Jesus is bringing us to the place for us to realize realize and appreciate don't Define what he's doing in You by what happening around you because what is happening in you is more Glory interal Glory he's building character in you he's giving giving your soul a thirst for Living Water praise the Lord yes sir As the deer panted for the water Brocks are we together amen so he said that's what purify not the outside he says it takes the power of the Resurrect The resurrected Christ to make us what we should be God has no other plan than to let the Holy Spirit Rule and reign in the church are we together now so we want to look at Solomon Solomon Glory of many wives That's Another other Glory he gave himself took on a glory of 700 wives and 300 Cony bounds praise the Lord now you see that's how God in his great wisdom men in their fallen State you look at their the the the dire thought of a man would just go to filthiness that's that's the first thing he would think in his mind he would think about filth sex 700 w wow why would God allow the son of David the one that he gives an experience of the Millennium because Solomon Reign was a type of the Millennium why will God allow that that shows how his mind is bigger than our mind why would go allow it not felt not sex that is something that is SE introduced that was not God original plan from the beginning praise the Lord so what pleasure do God have in that but why he allow it and to realize that all of those things were a mystery that were heal in the seals that was kept for this day to be revealed praise the Lord and i' I mean I've looked through different different commentaries I've really never saw anyone bringing it out like the way brother Bram said in marriage and divorce he says here marriage and divorce let's take that a little bit here he says now look in the final an analysis look there is one Jesus Christ is that right one man God Emmanuel do you believe that but the members of his wife not wives right the member of his wife one wife see thousand times thousand of thousand his wife bride the church do you understand that so that you who know which is right and which is wrong now he plainly shows here in this types there is one Christ and many members of that wife so Solomon 1,000 wife was just a type of the many member body the many members that will make the bride right it's one bride it's one wife but she brought from every nation praise the Lord amen Saint uh uh since the Holy Ghost fell God has been bringing out his church he's been bringing out his bride the bride has been coming down from the Ephesian Church age many people think it's only people that in the message that is the bride no the bride being long coming it was Paul that says I want to to expose you to Christ as a Chase virgin yes sir praise the Lord so you see when you look at Solomon and His Thousand wives or 700 and concubine and whatever all you see is just filled for the matter of fact they even turned his heart away from God it's a perishable Glory praise the Lord amen but when you look at Christ and his 1,000 BR what the scripture says they were crying him Lord of lords they're going to cry him King of Kings praise the lord they're going to bring more worship to him John said I saw the throne sitting I saw boooks open and thousands and thousands were sitting there to judge the Earth are we together so can you see the perishable Glory with Solomon Glory but here said God by his grace just like how he sent Paul and and all the other messenger of the ages to call the people out of the Gentile for his name's sake so this message have come to call you and myself it have come to call us to this place of Glory praise the Lord amen they have come to call us to this place of Glory Hallelujah and I mean it's just like a type of Esther being called in in in in the land of the Persians and and and and and to to be a queen I believe it was a scary place for her to go she knew that she was a jeude praise the Lord and she was stepping out there but the Bible says she found favor before the king and that is the same thing that you and myself have found before the king but you see the the horrible thing we do we judge ourself by the things we go through the things we have and we don't even know the kind of a glory that he have put Upon Us Praise the Lord can you imagine we grapping a revelation that I in The Bride of Jesus Christ the way we will conduct ourselves to know that everything that heaven holds belongs to you praise the Lord no matter what we are going through we have to keep our heads up high Jesus said look up high your redem your your Redemption draw at night praise the Lord I believe all the kings around the Nations the Bible says of all Nations even the ones that God told them told Israel not to marry to Solomon got a wife there praise the lord it's a type that this bride this bride this message of the hour is is going to go in every cracking corner of the earth praise the Lord every cracking corner of the earth praise the Lord there are people in India in other parts of the word they sit on the ground praise the Lord to Worship the Lord they don't have this kind of a setup that we have people in in in a dark part of the world when you you just you just think about that they give you courage you gather strength praise the Lord there are people that are living in worse life condition right praise the Lord the spoken word reading about the future home is their hope for living they hope for living right they know that there is a future home they know that there is a millennium they know that a prophet speaks about a Rapture I might not have everything in this life but I don't want to miss the Rapture praise the Lord amen we're not getting to heaven to be the bride it's right here amen it's right here when you get that Holy Ghost brother brandham said he slep the Welling B of unmerited Grace that's what keep us are we together Solomon in all of his glory when it comes to the glory of the women with all the wisdom he had it still couldn't keep him right the still could didn't keep him God said you now there will be nobody like you who have wisdom I've given it to you you I gave it to you praise the Lord hallelujah but yet he fell by those things the Bible says his many wife took his heart away from the Lord praise the Lord but you know for for Christ what what he did him many wife make him to leave his throne and come down to Earth his many wife makes him to take a cross to give himself for his many wives praise the Lord amen his many wife moves his heart brother B in the message job he says he says uh uh uh when God came down and and and and says Adam Adam where are you he found Adam he says when God saw Adam giving himself for his bride he's standing before judgment Adam could be selfish and fold his hands and says well you I I told you we were not supposed to do this and you did it you you see what you have done God is going to judge you no but he identify himself with the fult of his wife praise the Lord brother says when God dressed them in a in the in a in in in their bloody sheep skin and they were walking away he says it move the heart of God and God said I will have to do the same thing for my bride praise the Lord while we were yet sinners amen while we were yet sinners it pleased him to come and identify himself with our idolatry with our lies with our fornication with whatever we were doing wherever Grace took us from he felt pleased to identify himself with that praise the Lord not to become part of that not to go astray by there but to redeem us back to himself to bring us back to a better glory and our life has been so Sting with all of those things that we can't even see the glory that he has Upon Us instead of going before him every day and appreciating and say God thank you for making me part of your bride and thank you for what you are doing in my life we go before him every day oh Lord forgive me I'm a sinner oh Lord I'm a sinner Lord I'm a sinner saved by grace I'm a sinner saved by gra yeah you are a sinner saved by grace there's nothing you can do about it why can't we accept what he have provided Lord thank you thank you for the blood that you have shared Lord thank you for the provision that you have made thank you for the righteousness that you have given us thank you that you have made me your bride when will we start learning to pray like that when will we start learning to appreciate that when we start learning to appreciate the glory that he have put upon us are we together Joshua stop the son I wish I can stop that time praise the Lord amen he says there is one Christ and many member of that wife notice he can put us away for Spiritual fornication and for Doctrine at any time he want to praise the Lord why he can do it because he did not partake of our sin he became sin for us but he never partook of our sin praise the Lord as long as Adam pooke of his wife sin he couldn't put her away both of them were condemned but Christ can put us away away any time brother brandham says for Spiritual fornication and false Doctrine praise the Lord that's why we have to be careful what we are feeding our souls with not just Sensational things but man shall live by the word of God it must be the word are we together praise the Lord now so brother brother Willam and myself was fellowshipping on this a little bit here uh uh uh this afternoon on our way over to church and you know we were just having a wonderful time on it a quote from uh uh how can I overcome and uh you know and and and and both of us we could see that you know it's a it's a it's a long standing court and we will get down to that let's read that brother Brandon yeah he was say he's talking about lot and his wife he's talking about the Overcomers how how how she did not overcome she never overcame he said she started out as an as an overcomer but she never did overcome oh she left the denomination she left Sodom she did she walk out of Sodom with lot but she wanted to go back to have her hair cut praise the Lord amen and and and grow R some some some fake nails and all of that put some tattoos on her on her body we can we can bring all of that into today's uh more than uh uh you know what I mean praise the Lord you yeah we know what you mean brother Brandon because we have the worst of it today amen see she had to go back she just couldn't stand the test she had to look back again see oh to see what the rest of them was doing oh you know I had some good friends down there after all and and and uh uh uh and after all this might be just a little a little move I don't I don't know whether it could be right or not praise the Lord I have only only got this man word for it now whose man word her husband amen he was the one that the angel spoke to and said come out I can do nothing until you come out so yeah brother Bram now is stopping lot wife and saying that uh you know she she she saying it's only my husband word I have for I don't know whether is right or not all of those things going through her mind he's he's building up to the to the case and the reason why she looked back I want to got this man word for it though he's my husband but yet now he brings in this he says your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking you see it now whether it could be right or not I don't know maybe he his Revelation wasn't right praise the Lord and uh yeah I had I had a thought to do that and and I never did it uh praise the Lord are we together amen now so that was what we were fellowshipping on a little bit while we were coming here and uh I've I've I've told you this that that particular court it has been uh uh a kind of a long standing court over the years you know uh uh and and uh brother Brandon building a case here of uh of uh of lot praise the Lord of lot wife and uh uh so he's building this case of L wife sorry I'm I'm I'm a little bit little bit just distracted because there was something I wanted to to to bring out uh put the Cote out but I didn't I didn't add it to this I realized so I'm I'm just trying to uh search that out quickly and uh so he's building this case here and uh uh talking about Lord wife not listening to her husband not uh you know uh uh taking her husband word she's saying well I don't know maybe it's his personal revelation I don't see it like that you know what and then she's she it brought her to the place of turning back and here she turned into a pillow of salt and the prophet of God dropped this year he says your pastor is is your husband spiritually speaking you see it and then he went on with their statement praise the Lord and then you can go on and read the rest but you see how just that phrase has been taken as a Doctrine praise the Lord and I've I've said it to you over and over but I F that I should I should be able to read a quote to you tonight uh uh and and and and uh you know and and make you to see you know uh where where it all develop from praise the Lord amen now if if if we want to do a Bible studies here tonight Lord was not a messenger right are we together he was not a messenger the messenger HH H the man of of of that hour was was was Abraham in in every sense he was the one that God was dealing with praise the Lord the messenger were the angels that came to lot he was not a messenger he was just a backslid of man that went down there to Sodom are we together amen I'm going I'm going I'm going to to somewhere with this because you see in a way that this code has been uh uh uh placed in the place of a Doctrine you see if if it is if if if a Doctrine is not based on the word of God is it's quick to it's it's it's dangerous it can destroy people lives it can destroy people homes and just for my little time around uh the word and around the message I've seen how this particular statement has destroyed people homes yes because they have put preachers to the place where they think they can run people homes because they think that they are the spiritual husband but I I'll show to you tonight that brother brandham did not establish this thing as auline I show to you one of the simplest way I can show it to you is right from the same message praise the Lord amen right from the same message and if you have time you can go home that's paragraph 197 that is the second to the last paragraph before the message ends brother brandham says until I see you tonight God love you and be with you you are my children of the Gospel you are the purchase now he says the pastor is the spiritual husband why why didn't he say you are my wife and there is nowhere you will find in the message where brother brandham ever referred to the church that you are my wife he says you are my children in the gospel I was so burdened with this couple of months and some time back so burdened with this as I I rote over this message over and over the Lord used this very last quote until I see you God love you and God be with you you are my children in the gospel if he was established there to be a Doctrine he will say you are my wives Paul said you are my children you will even give your eyes if I asked for it praise the Lord now the reason why I'm bringing this out because Solomon in all of his glory measuring on the natural Glory it took his heart away from the Lord and men that have applied this quote naturally many have gone go got themselves into some some form of idolatry or that praise the Lord but then if the many members are one wife to Christ which is our Solomon amen then how can a man like myself praise the Lord I'm your pastor I'm I'm The Shepherd of this church but he's the chief Shepherd my shepherd work is to stay before the Lord pray and bring you a message I don't know what you are doing to your house I can't keep you safe in the street he keep you safe he's the one that is watching over you he watch over your soul praise the Lord then how can me being a man man human being be more spiritual hosal to you than Jesus how praise the Lord how can I Mar human being like me trusting on the grace of God to be able to bring something to you do you see how man has used this to hold on to the life of people keep them on fear and even some men has used this very quote to abuse the church abuse women in the church are we together brother Bram was says here are we together he will say here listen to year that the message job I think he preached that 1956 he says now in a spiritual meaning of it it says in the spiritual meaning of it that each one of those family the father being the priest of his own home is that not scriptural Paul says if you want to learn anything ask your husband praise the Lord if he don't know he can ask the pastor praise the Lord or invite the pastor to your home so brother Bram year is is is is making us to see it right from the beginning Adam was the priest of his home and in a spiritual meaning of it that each one of those family the father being the priest of his own home they was to kill the lamb for each house that they could eat the meat and but it all represented one lamb are we together amen are you see what I'm going tonight praise the Lord because we we have to understand in this thing the scripture tells us and the message tells us we must never Lo over God's people praise the Lord amen I'm required by the scripture to live such a life for you to have confidence in me if my life is is is is is is not bringing you to that place of confidence there is no way I can shout at you or preach out you jump up and down and and intimidate you for it to create faith in you that's the reason why the scripture holds the man of God at with with a strong responsibility yes sir why because if he lives a life that stumbl the people they lose that confidence they can never build fed again they cannot be fa that that's the reason why that me I mean it's not something that a man can go to school for it's something that God must call a man for are we together now so you see yeah uh uh uh uh oh praise the Lord my time is up here so Solomon in all of his Glory that's that's where that's where we want to we want to we we want to hold you here just so you can be able to realize there because remember I told you we coming down to the kingdom the power and the glory the lord will give us Grace uh to be able to break into that but you see that uh uh how God built those things Jesus our lord Jesus God coming in flesh bringing the people right to the time he he he's taking the most glorious age in Israel the most time that Israel has ever experienced peace the most time that every nation around the world respected it he's taking that time trying to make them to know it was just a shadow it was just a shadow like the prophet said you can never get warm by pained fire you can admire it but it will never make you warm praise the Lord it was just a shadow it was a glory that fed away that is so much that when Solomon left the throne the Kingdom of Israel splitted into two re his son took to Benjamin and Judah and and and jeam took 10 tribes praise the Lord he said not one stone will be left upon another and what he did he took them right to the temple he said look at this Temple now one stone will be left on the other praise the Lord because the people were so captured so drawn to a physical Temple fighting for the physical ground and God was building a spiritual home he was building he was preparing them for a time of the Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost will come praise the Lord he was preparing them for the upper room Lord is it this is it the time that we will take over the kingdom he said it is not for you to know praise the Lord it is not for you to know can you imagine what might have happened to Peter after the Holy Ghost came and he start the spiritual Revelation he's the one that says uh you you are born of you are precious stones born of precious stones and and all of those things he said there he was the one that says from Faith to Virtue and knowledge Peter was the one that say other can you imagine when he started understanding that thing this was the very same man that took out the sword to cut somebody ear can you imagine he realized how my Revelation was so Conor right when people are just fighting over physical things yes and having no knowledge of the of the spiritual Glory that you could tap into and your life would never be the same the the spiritual Glory that you could press into can you imagine what he Tau of think about Paul that got the mystery of the New Testament a messenger to the Gentile yeah brother Brandon say that's the reason why Paul seal his life to death he rather choose to die for this gospel after he realized that the thing that he was killing the disciples for it was a fielded glory after he realized that the traditions of his fathers had no weight Paul say I would rather die for this he denied himself a home denied himself a wife he said change wait for me against all prophecy that came Paul say I would rather walk into death because he he because he broke into the glory that that there was nothing in this life that Paul could hold to he says I labored among you if I wanted a wife I could take one of the sisters for the matter of fact the work that I've done done among you you supposed to take care of me but he says I work with my own hands why because he had broke into the glory he was lifted up into the 10 Heavens he said eyes have not seen ears have not heard neither have it come close to your heart the glory praise the Lord the glory that brother Steve jamb has stepped into the glory that sister M brother Scar and all of these loved ones that have gone the glory that they have stepped into you will not come close to knowing it you will not come close to knor the glory that is hovering around your life right the the glory that is keeping you going every day is not the food you ate yesterday for men shall not laid by bread alone but laid by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God praise the Lord if you have a revelation of that Glory you will find something for from the scripture to feel your soul every day you will find something from the word of God to feel your soul every day you will not be snacking on the word of God praise the Lord amen we have God used to Tak a snack on the word of God just reading one Bible verse and know you will find something to Fe your soul whether it's a chapter in the book or whether it's a subject that is on your heart that you can read few verses praise the Lord or you can get over to the to the to the table and pull out a court and says let me see what the prophet say on this the Pastor said this let me go and see what what the prophet say on love let me see what he says on uh on uh on Thanksgiving let me you you you'll be able to take something feel your soul every day sir that's how you break into that Glory praise the Lord because when you start getting interested in the word the Holy Ghost have a way of grappling you because there is something you will read or something you will hear that will keep playing back in your subconscious and slowly it be taking you into the glory the Lord bless you musicians you can come for maybe you were just clapping for me but let's give the Lord a hand of [Applause] praise [Music] let's stand on our
