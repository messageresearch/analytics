[27:05] from we come from the north part of
[27:07] Germany. Um uh I'm uh I'm uh yeah, can I
[27:12] say uh husband of one wife. I think
[27:15] that's always important to say today. So
[27:18] and we have 10 10 children at home. So
[27:20] not at home anymore. most of them uh or
[27:23] quite some they left already in
[27:25] marriage. So, but uh we are so grateful
[27:27] for the Lord and uh he has blessed us
[27:30] with wonderful children and uh and um
[27:35] I'm ministering pastoring a church in
[27:36] the northern part of Germany for some
[27:38] years and we just want to say the Lord
[27:41] is good. Amen.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And greetings from each and
[27:45] everyone. Uh also I must bring you
[27:47] greetings a brother that you might not
[27:49] know. Uh it's a brother from Uganda,
[27:51] brother Steven Ibali. He just told me
[27:53] when you go down there uh to uh to
[27:56] minister for the for the people there,
[27:58] just greet them from me from a brother
[28:00] in Africa. So this is what I want to do
[28:04] and uh I think that's that's actually
[28:06] all for introduction. I think you will
[28:08] uh get to know me a little better as we
[28:10] are ministering and uh and so we are
[28:13] just uh and I want to thank you say
[28:15] thank you to brother one for uh you know
[28:18] for uh the the really the warm welcome
[28:21] and uh and uh all the things that he has
[28:24] done so far already uh it's just
[28:26] wonderful to be amongst believers. Amen.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Is that fine? Is it
[28:31] enough for introduction?
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Is it okay? Perfect. So then let's go
[28:34] straight into the word because I'm not
[28:37] so good in that uh in introduction and
[28:40] uh because something is really burning
[28:42] on my heart and as you have sang the
[28:45] songs see there sometimes it's really
[28:47] amazing um how the Lord is just uh
[28:50] orchestrating things and so I was so
[28:53] encouraged hearing the songs and uh you
[28:57] know we are all we are all uh we are all
[29:01] in great expectation. Amen.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; For what the Lord uh is is doing or what
[29:07] the Lord has done and also expectation
[29:09] what the Lord is doing and how he will
[29:11] do things.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Think to me uh one of the most important
[29:16] things that we understand how God is
[29:18] doing things.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Uh that God is doing things it's it's
[29:21] sure but how he is doing things that's
[29:24] the way the people miss it.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because that's the way uh um you
[29:31] know when the the rapture will come it
[29:33] will be a secret going.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Uh you know why secret going? Because
[29:38] people expect it different.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; So when it happens because it's not
[29:43] according to the expectation they will
[29:44] miss it.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; So it's it's so important that we really
[29:48] understand how God is doing things.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh and so that was such an
[29:54] inspiring thing to see how even the song
[29:56] service somehow was led in that
[29:58] direction. Amen. So let's turn our
[30:00] Bibles. And as I said, I don't want to,
[30:03] you know, speak long around it. Uh
[30:05] because I know time is always not my
[30:07] friend. So uh I'm I'm known as a long-
[30:10] winded preacher. So I don't want to ruin
[30:14] my reputation in the first service. So
[30:17] that's why we go straight to the word.
[30:19] First Corinthians, we want to uh open
[30:21] our Bibles and I have something for a
[30:23] Wednesday night maybe. Um uh much, but I
[30:26] trust we can get at least some of the
[30:28] highlights.
[30:30] Um I want to speak this evening on ready
[30:33] for rapture
[30:35] &gt;&gt; or ready for change.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; I just want to speak this evening on
[30:39] just ready for rapture. And the question
[30:42] is are we?
[30:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:46] So uh and uh and I think uh I think uh
[30:50] it will be wonderful. First Corinthians,
[30:52] we want to go want to start with 1
[30:54] Corinthians. We want to read uh three
[30:57] portions of scripture. 1 Corinthians 6,
[31:00] [snorts]
[31:01] we want to read from 9 to 11.
[31:05] 1 Corinthians 6 from 9 to11
[31:09] we want to read and it is read like
[31:13] this. Know ye not that the unrighteous
[31:16] shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Be
[31:19] not deceived, neither fornicators, nor
[31:22] idolattors, nor adulterers, nor
[31:24] effeminate, nor abusers of themsel with
[31:27] mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
[31:31] drunkards, nor revilers, nor
[31:33] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[31:37] of God.
[31:38] As such were some of you, but ye are
[31:41] washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye
[31:44] are justified in the name of the Lord
[31:47] Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Luke 18, we want to do as
[31:57] another scripture.
[32:00] Luke 18,
[32:02] we want to read from 9 to4.
[32:06] Luke 18. We want to read from 9 to4.
[32:14] Amen. And we want to speak on ready for
[32:16] rapture.
[32:18] Uh ready for change. And he spake this
[32:22] parable unto certain which trusted in
[32:26] themsel that they were righteous and
[32:30] despised others.
[32:33] Two men went up into the temple to pray,
[32:36] the one a Pharisee and the other a
[32:38] publican. The Pharisees stood there and
[32:40] prayed thus with himself. God, I thank
[32:43] thee that I'm not as other men are
[32:46] extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or
[32:49] even as this publican. I fast twice in
[32:53] the week. I give tithe of all that I
[32:56] possess. And the publican standing a far
[32:59] off would not lift up so much his eyes
[33:02] unto heaven, but smokeote upon his
[33:04] breast, saying, God be merciful to me a
[33:07] sinner.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you that this man went down to
[33:11] his house justified rather than the
[33:15] other.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; For everyone that exaltth himself shall
[33:19] be abased, and he that humbles himself
[33:22] shall be exalted.
[33:25] Who was rapture ready?
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Who was rapture ready?
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; And and just watch. He went home to his
[33:36] house justified.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful?
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; And then one more scripture. Sorry to
[33:43] read a little more, but I always read
[33:45] them in the beginning. And I know you
[33:48] are uh you know, brother one, as a
[33:51] pastor here, you are well taught. So we
[33:54] can stretch our legs this evening a
[33:56] little bit our arms.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; So and I know uh I will not lose you. So
[34:00] we read another scripture James 5. We
[34:03] want to read James 5 16-18.
[34:09] James 5:16-18.
[34:14] I thought that's so so uh wonderful how
[34:17] that's how how James will will bring it
[34:20] out or it comes out here. Uh and just
[34:24] just shortly back that one man went
[34:27] justified home.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; That was the Bible said,
[34:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Confess your faults one to to the other
[34:35] and pray one for the other that me ye
[34:38] may be healed. The effectual favor
[34:42] favoring prayer of a righteous man
[34:46] &gt;&gt; avail much.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; And now now very very beautiful. Watch
[34:52] how the scripture how James brings a
[34:55] type in here. Elias was a man subject to
[34:59] like passion as we are. And he prayed
[35:04] earnestly that it might not rain. And it
[35:07] rained not on the earth by the space of
[35:10] three years and six months. And he
[35:13] prayed again and the heaven gave rain
[35:15] and the earth brought forth her fruit.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it amazing how James is
[35:21] bringing
[35:23] Elias in
[35:25] &gt;&gt; a man that is subject under like
[35:29] passions that we are.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; That means he faced the same trouble
[35:34] that we are facing.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Heavenly Father,
[35:38] &gt;&gt; we just uh it's such a great privilege,
[35:41] Father, to live in this hour. Oh God, we
[35:44] have not deserved it. We have not worked
[35:47] for it, but it was your great merciful
[35:50] plan, Father. And we are so grateful for
[35:53] that that we can live in this hour in
[35:55] the in the most dangerous days and hours
[35:59] that ever was there and the most
[36:01] glorious time that ever was there,
[36:03] Father. And we pray this evening as we
[36:05] look into your word, may you unveil
[36:07] yourself. I pray, Father, forgive us for
[36:10] all our shortcomings. Forgive us for
[36:12] everything that we thought wrong and did
[36:14] wrong. Father just forgive us we pray
[36:17] and may each and everyone walk out this
[36:20] evening like that man ready for rapture.
[36:23] Father I pray thee that you will be with
[36:25] us father in the service
[36:28] &gt;&gt; anoint your word anoint the speaker
[36:30] anoint the those who are listening uh
[36:33] here present and on stream. I pray
[36:35] father that your holy spirit may go and
[36:38] may be there and unveil and reveal
[36:41] himself and your word as we are
[36:43] listening to your word. And we ask it in
[36:45] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. May be seated.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we just want to this was
[36:53] something that was was really um as I
[36:55] was reading it and uh and as I'm um as
[36:59] as we are really approaching I believe
[37:02] we approaching uh the the that day uh
[37:07] and uh what is always somewhere on our
[37:09] mind you know we see the uh modern
[37:12] events how they take how they take care
[37:15] or how they are happening modern events
[37:18] that uh you know were made clear by
[37:21] prophecy.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; But today it's not modern events made
[37:25] clear by prophecy, but it's modern
[37:26] events made clear as they happen.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; They were once prophecy. Yeah.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; But it's not prophecy anymore. So many
[37:34] events are fulfilled in our days.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; So we're living in the hour where those
[37:39] prophecies are are fulfilled.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; As they are fulfilling and and you are
[37:45] here also in a country where many things
[37:47] the prophet would speak about. You you
[37:48] all know that he spoke about the second
[37:50] the second Catholic president and so on.
[37:53] He spoke about the pope and so on and so
[37:56] many things that he spoke of as
[37:58] prophecies are fulfilled.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right? They are fulfilled.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; So they are not just made plain by
[38:05] prophecy but they are made plain as they
[38:07] has happened.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, and that to me makes it makes
[38:12] it more evident that really let's say it
[38:16] if if you take the bright picture, the
[38:17] rapture or the change actually uh is is
[38:20] is just must be very close must be very
[38:24] near, right? Yeah.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; The the the rapture as we know is a
[38:27] process but but the change of the body
[38:29] because this is actually the final stage
[38:31] of the the rapture which will be this
[38:33] the the change of our bodies. Yeah.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We still believe in the change of
[38:38] our bodies.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so happy that these bodies
[38:41] will be changed uh in one of these days.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as it as we are waiting or not
[38:48] waiting but as we are expecting actually
[38:51] that happening we should be under under
[38:54] an expectation under something that is
[38:57] thrilling us because we are living in a
[39:00] time where where people don't have to
[39:03] die but they will be changed in the
[39:06] moment in a twinkling of an eye
[39:08] &gt;&gt; right so and not only one but a
[39:10] [clears throat] whole group of people
[39:12] &gt;&gt; I mean this is amazing you know how God
[39:14] is constructing and orchestrating it.
[39:17] That is not your only only one person as
[39:20] we always had them uh but uh but a whole
[39:23] group of people will be ready at the
[39:27] same time,
[39:28] &gt;&gt; right? Will be ready at the same time
[39:31] and God is able to manage that all over
[39:34] the world.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; So if you are in the states or we are in
[39:38] Europe or you are somewhere in the bush
[39:40] in Africa, I'm much in Africa traveling.
[39:43] So uh and you can see it's I mean this
[39:46] is a masterpiece of God's great plan and
[39:49] orchestration
[39:50] &gt;&gt; how he is able to get a a whole group
[39:54] ready for a body change.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; And we understand the body change will
[39:59] not be one week this and after three
[40:01] years that one but it will be in a in a
[40:04] certain amount of time. It will be very
[40:07] close together.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:09] So, so, so as we are looking at it and
[40:12] it becomes more amazing the more
[40:15] turbulent the whole situation and scene
[40:18] becomes.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[40:20] &gt;&gt; It becomes more of of really you can see
[40:24] it will be the hand of the Lord. It's
[40:26] not orchestrated by men. This is not
[40:29] organized by men.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; This is God must be the organizer of
[40:33] this. That's right. Because in this what
[40:36] we have today, you understand man will
[40:39] never organize it.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Man has never been able to organize
[40:43] this.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. When it all comes together, you
[40:46] know, even if we have modern media, we
[40:48] can communicate with one another, we
[40:50] cannot we cannot organize orchestrate
[40:53] that. So it is the sovereign hand of
[40:55] God.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to read you a statement
[41:00] of the prophet what what he I mean he he
[41:03] said it in in in Balam and in in in
[41:05] Gilead in 19 uh I think it's 1959.
[41:09] Brother Random said speaking about you
[41:11] know the change and then he's speaking
[41:14] about the faith and and then brother
[41:16] makes interesting statement. He said he
[41:20] said uh you just say uh when I go home
[41:23] you know when you drive home he said I
[41:25] got home and out and start the car
[41:27] that's all an act of faith rel said
[41:30] &gt;&gt; he said tomorrow I will meet uh you in a
[41:33] certain place that's all an act of faith
[41:37] &gt;&gt; because you have
[41:40] you you have just done it so much
[41:42] because it had become a regular routine
[41:45] with you.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, that's the way the things of
[41:49] God are.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; After you have trusted him and watched
[41:55] him do so many things, it becomes like a
[41:59] regular routine.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; God.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; And that's the condition I think the
[42:05] church will be just before the coming of
[42:08] the Lord. So the rapture will just go
[42:12] right on in the same way. It will be
[42:15] just a regular routine of following the
[42:19] scriptures and the plans of God.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; So I I found this very amazing statement
[42:25] of the prophet how he how he said that
[42:28] the rapture you know when the the change
[42:30] of the body it will be a normal day. It
[42:33] will be normal life regular routine. So
[42:36] that means you don't need to try to be
[42:40] somebody special.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. to be to be changed or to
[42:45] be in the rapture.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; You don't need to act extraordinary
[42:50] to be ready.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; You understand? The prophet would really
[42:55] try to and most of the time is actually
[42:58] is actually hindering you to be ready.
[43:00] If you are trying to be somebody that
[43:02] you are not,
[43:03] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Random would many times
[43:06] say, don't try to be somebody special.
[43:08] Don't try to be somebody that is maybe
[43:11] your star or he said be what you are
[43:14] because God needs you the way he made
[43:16] you.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; He needs each and everyone the way he he
[43:21] made us. He orchestrated us. You know he
[43:24] planned you. You know that he he planned
[43:26] you.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Brother would say that the the that the
[43:30] birth is more mysterious than the virgin
[43:32] birth.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; So the virgin birth actually was very
[43:36] simple. God just had to create that act
[43:38] and that sperm and that's it.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to you, God had to put
[43:42] put much more effort in it.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; So he had to plan and pre-plan and
[43:46] really orchestrate and and things from
[43:48] generations.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; So that you finally at the end of the
[43:52] day use it here now.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; So and if he put so much effort in your
[43:57] coming that [clears throat] means he he
[43:59] has something he has a plan with you.
[44:00] Right.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has a plan with you. So don't
[44:04] try to be somebody else. Don't try to be
[44:06] somebody that you are not. Don't try to
[44:08] be somebody special to go in the rapture
[44:11] that you are not.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will be it will be a regular
[44:16] routine. the rapture will be.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; It will be. It will be. And so it's
[44:20] that's always that's always stirred me.
[44:23] Uh and and as as we understand this this
[44:27] really this day is approaching and uh
[44:30] and how how you know as as as a pastor
[44:33] also of a church, how how to get the
[44:36] people ready? How to be ready yourself?
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; How to get the people ready. You
[44:41] understand? How to how to be ready? uh
[44:44] because we we don't really it can be
[44:46] overnight. We understand that before we
[44:48] wake up in the morning the thing could
[44:50] be done.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; We understand that right?
[44:54] &gt;&gt; So we still believe that
[44:56] &gt;&gt; you know and it will be it will be in a
[44:58] in a time when people when when maybe we
[45:01] feel it's not a good time to be to to
[45:03] that it comes
[45:06] &gt;&gt; you know so but God is not interested in
[45:08] what we think God is interested in
[45:10] fulfilling his plan. Yeah.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; So that's why in an hour when when we
[45:15] not might not think it or not then the
[45:18] thing will happen.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; So so and and as as we really are
[45:23] looking for for to be
[45:26] ready for rapture rapture ready how that
[45:29] state is how will God orchestrate that
[45:32] worldwide
[45:34] you understand worldwide so that we at
[45:37] the same hour at the same time. My
[45:40] goodness, what kind of a program must
[45:42] God have?
[45:43] &gt;&gt; You know, what kind of what kind of
[45:45] organiz you know, but many times we
[45:48] underestimate the Holy Spirit.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, because because you know, you
[45:53] know, we sometimes we hardly get a you
[45:55] know, a unity in a family how he will
[45:57] get a unity amongst the believers.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; But but but what I what I came to
[46:03] understand is it might be this is what I
[46:06] have learned many times. It comes
[46:08] different than I think.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; So it's nothing wrong with God is
[46:13] something wrong with my way of thinking
[46:16] and with my approach and with my
[46:18] expectation.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; So and that's what I learned. So I just
[46:22] always pray that Lord help me to to have
[46:24] the right kind of expectation
[46:27] &gt;&gt; to have the right kind of goal that I
[46:29] don't miss as it happens
[46:31] &gt;&gt; because I don't want to lo miss the joy
[46:35] of being present when it happens. Yeah.
[46:37] Amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I believe the
[46:39] bride of Jesus Christ especially
[46:41] especially because she is she is married
[46:43] to him and brother Bunn would say that
[46:46] the the bridegroom he's interested now
[46:48] in sharing the secret to her.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; I I think she he is somehow introducing
[46:53] it to the bride so that she can be happy
[46:57] that she can be exciting as she see it
[47:00] happening. So I believe we will walk in
[47:02] our body change with open eyes.
[47:06] Hallelujah.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we walk in I believe
[47:08] that we walk into a body change with
[47:10] open eyes expecting it to happen. And
[47:13] when the dead in Christ shall come will
[47:16] come it will be a surprise but we we
[47:18] will not be shocked.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Because somehow we expect them right
[47:23] somehow we expect them.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Yet I think we will be surprised and
[47:27] absolutely surprised the way they look
[47:29] like. But but but you expect them.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; And and and let's let me read first
[47:38] first Thessalonians. I want to read that
[47:40] again maybe because that is actually the
[47:42] hour that we are approaching. Uh 1
[47:44] Thessalonians 4. For the Lord himself
[47:46] shall descend from heaven with a shout,
[47:49] with the voice of the archangel, and
[47:50] with the trump of God, and the dead in
[47:54] Christ shall rise first.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Then we which are alive
[48:00] and remain shall be caught up together
[48:02] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[48:04] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[48:07] the Lord. Therefore, comfort one another
[48:09] with these words."
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we understand that we're living
[48:13] in the time we brother plainly would say
[48:16] that the shout is the message.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we speak, we don't go
[48:20] this evening there, you know, seeing I
[48:22] went at home a little with the church
[48:24] and the voice of the archangel, Brother
[48:26] said only Christ can be the voice of the
[48:29] archangel.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; He said Christ and and so the the the
[48:32] the the the voice of the archangel and
[48:35] the trump of God shall sound and the
[48:37] dead in Christ shall rise first. And
[48:38] then brother said, you all know the
[48:40] quote in in in the rapture message,
[48:42] brother said he Jesus does all things,
[48:45] three things as he's descending.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so and and surely we have
[48:51] people have their understanding how will
[48:54] it be when the great archangel you know
[48:57] cries with a loud voice. It will be a
[49:00] loud voice,
[49:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; And and so people have their own
[49:05] understandings, their imaginations how
[49:07] things are and and and then then the
[49:10] trump of God the trump of God shall
[49:12] sound and the dead in Christ shall rise.
[49:16] So, so you understand each and everyone
[49:18] has has their own picture how uh you
[49:20] know how that will be and that's the way
[49:22] many times we miss it.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; That's the way many times we miss things
[49:28] in the days of Jesus. You know how much
[49:30] they missed it.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they had a
[49:33] different expectation.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; It came in such a unusual way that they
[49:39] missed it.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and the prophet told us he
[49:42] told us he said it will be this time
[49:44] again it will be so simple people will
[49:46] just simply miss it
[49:48] &gt;&gt; because of the simplicity.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But but as we are as we are
[49:53] um as we are approaching that hour and I
[49:57] and we understand brother Adam could say
[49:59] the shout is the message
[50:01] &gt;&gt; together the people together.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; He said and then the voice and the trump
[50:06] as I said this evening we don't go to
[50:08] details. We don't want that. But to
[50:10] understand it is happening or it must
[50:13] happening. It must happen amongst us.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Because we are about that the dead in
[50:18] Christ shall rise.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[50:22] &gt;&gt; So the dead in Christ shall rise because
[50:25] they they rise because of the the loud
[50:28] voice of the archangel.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; And because of the trump of God. And we
[50:34] understand the prophet would let us know
[50:37] that a trumpet in itself can do nothing.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet said a trumpet is a mute
[50:43] thing unless somebody plays it.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; So the trump of God in itself is a mute
[50:50] thing unless he plays it.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; So but it must happen somehow somewhere
[50:57] before the dead in Christ rise. Okay?
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Because as we have read, as we have
[51:02] heard, the voice of the archangel and
[51:03] with the trump of God and the dead in
[51:05] Christ shall rise first.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Because they we understand that they are
[51:10] that they wait on the other side. As
[51:12] Paul would say to the Hebrews, they are
[51:14] waiting on us.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Without us, they cannot be made
[51:18] &gt;&gt; perfect.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Perfect. That means without us,
[51:23] without us. Come on, church. without us.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; They still have to wait.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; But when this church is ready,
[51:33] &gt;&gt; when this church is ready,
[51:36] &gt;&gt; and God can do with the church what he
[51:39] is intended for,
[51:40] &gt;&gt; then the dead in Christ shall come
[51:42] first, rise first.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So actually God is just waiting on
[51:47] me and on you to be ready.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; So it's right to be ready. Now what do
[51:52] we have to do to be ready?
[51:55] It's as I say it's puzzling always to
[51:56] people what what must I do to be ready
[51:59] you know what can I do to be ready and
[52:02] we understand that's why I've read the
[52:03] scripture of Luke 18 there was a man
[52:07] and seemingly he was he was he was he
[52:11] was a man that that understood there was
[52:13] not everything in his life was right
[52:16] right
[52:19] &gt;&gt; but yet he he said actually that man
[52:21] actually said Lord have mercy on me.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And he went justified home.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; So we understand
[52:34] &gt;&gt; that attitude is maybe more important
[52:37] than we think.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Actually, brother Adam said it is your
[52:42] attitude that presents you before God.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; That's your attitude that present not
[52:49] what you can do, but you want to what
[52:51] you want to do.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Is that right?
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; And and we understand allow allow me
[52:58] maybe shortly to to stay there. Brother
[52:59] Benham said you know many times we we
[53:01] know the the statement of the prophet
[53:03] that the right mental attitude
[53:06] &gt;&gt; of any promise of God will bring it to
[53:08] pass.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; But then brother make also another
[53:11] statement. He said it is not your mental
[53:13] attitude that brings it to pass.
[53:17] It is not your mental attitude that
[53:18] brings it to pass
[53:20] &gt;&gt; because it is your right mental attitude
[53:23] towards the one that brings it to pass.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; He said if so that means if you keep
[53:29] your right mental attitude towards God
[53:32] &gt;&gt; then he will bring it to pass.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; So it's not our mental attitude that
[53:37] produces this. So don't try to be don't
[53:41] stress your mental attitude.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; No, don't do that. Yeah,
[53:46] &gt;&gt; just be simple enough. Have the right
[53:48] kind of attitude
[53:49] &gt;&gt; towards God. Is that right?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Towards God. Anything then he will bring
[53:54] it to pass.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; So I think sometimes it's so important
[53:57] that the people understand how to relax
[53:59] in the right way.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Because we have to today we are mental
[54:03] we are so under pressure under fire the
[54:06] whole world brother Anna would say it
[54:08] will be a mental sick institution
[54:10] actually.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because the mental
[54:13] pressure is rising. Yes.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Constantly.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; And you have to understand that you are
[54:20] more than your mental condition.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; You have to understand that you are
[54:26] living in a dying body and in a dying
[54:28] spirit.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; The body ch the change will not only be
[54:32] your body but also your human spirit
[54:34] will be changed.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Because it needs a change, right?
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So attitude is it's it's very very
[54:42] very I think it's very important and
[54:44] very simple also you understand that and
[54:46] this man had just had the right attitude
[54:49] he just SAID LORD BE MERCIFUL to me
[54:51] THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS ALL
[54:52] &gt;&gt; YES amen
[54:54] &gt;&gt; isn't it amazing
[54:56] &gt;&gt; that was all
[54:58] &gt;&gt; that man went justified home
[55:02] &gt;&gt; and the other man that had his life or
[55:05] that was not in that maybe his genes was
[55:08] a little bit different.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; You understand? So, so he for for some
[55:14] people it's easy to stop smoking.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; For some not.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; I remember when I was young, I tried to
[55:22] STOP SMOKING. I COULDN'T STOP.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because I couldn't.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; And I had I had OTHER FRIENDS. THEY
[55:30] COULD STOP. And I said, "My goodness,
[55:33] what what a cursed person I am."
[55:36] understand that helped me that I needed
[55:39] him.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; You understand I needed him.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, I need you. I cannot do it
[55:44] by myself."
[55:46] &gt;&gt; And you understand if you if you have
[55:47] things that you know you cannot you
[55:49] cannot overcome yourself or or then you
[55:52] know you need him.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That you just you need
[55:56] him
[55:57] &gt;&gt; and as you know you need him, you are in
[56:00] a right condition for rapture.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] I I I think it's I think it's it's
[56:07] beautiful how it is done and and and and
[56:09] and brother Vandom would really say that
[56:12] and and watch in the Bible. Watch in the
[56:13] Bible. We have we have four we have four
[56:16] women in the Bible where really where
[56:19] really um the attitude becomes very very
[56:22] obvious how important that is. The one
[56:25] the first one we want to just touch is
[56:28] Eve. Uh, you know, Eve is was was a
[56:31] woman. She had she had she was the right
[56:34] womb
[56:36] &gt;&gt; and she received the wrong seed.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And the product was Cain.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; So you can be the right womb.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; If you receive the wrong seed,
[56:49] &gt;&gt; you will bring forth something evil.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; That's why Satan hunts you
[56:55] &gt;&gt; because he knows you are the right womb.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:00] Yeah.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; That's why Satan I want to say that
[57:03] again. That's why Satan hunts you
[57:05] because he knows you are the right womb.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; That same womb brought forth Cain
[57:11] brought forth Abel.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; And the next the next woman we want to
[57:19] see which which which I think is very
[57:22] nice. It's Hagar. Hagar was the wrong
[57:24] womb
[57:26] &gt;&gt; in the right seat.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so Eve had was the right
[57:33] womb in the wrong seat.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Hagar was the wrong woman in the right
[57:37] seat. What was the result?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; A man that could not be controlled.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Right. You with me?
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Was I Israel the seed of Abraham?
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; But it was just the wrong womb.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you have the the right womb,
[57:59] wrong seat. Then you have the wrong
[58:01] womb, the right seat. Then we comes then
[58:03] we come to Sarah.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Sarah was the right womb
[58:08] and she had the right seat.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; She brought forth Isaac.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; That was But that man died.
[58:18] But there's another woman in the Bible.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; There's another woman in the Bible. Her
[58:23] name is Mary.
[58:27] She was the right womb.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; She received the right seat.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And what was the difference to Sarah?
[58:35] &gt;&gt; See, didn't die. [clears throat]
[58:37] &gt;&gt; The se the difference to Sarah was Mary
[58:40] had the right attitude.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Where Sarah actually said, "Me, an old
[58:47] woman."
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Sarah said, "It be to be according to
[58:52] your word."
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Just the right attitude. Amen.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Brought forth.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; You understand that,
[59:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just the right attitude brought
[59:05] forth Jesus Christ.
[59:07] So we we understand that's and that's
[59:10] why brother Bam said church age book the
[59:13] word is in the bride as it was
[59:17] &gt;&gt; in
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Mary
[59:20] &gt;&gt; not in Sarah
[59:24] &gt;&gt; not in Eve
[59:25] &gt;&gt; yes
[59:26] &gt;&gt; not in Hagar the word is in the bride as
[59:29] it was in Mary
[59:32] &gt;&gt; showing how important the right attitude
[59:36] will be at the end.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that amazing?
[59:40] &gt;&gt; It's amazing.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing how we can be ready?
[59:43] Very simple.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude towards any
[59:52] promise of God. Just keep the right
[59:54] attitude towards the rapture. Just keep
[59:56] the right attitude to the body change.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:06] Amen. So, so you understand?
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; What shall we do to be ready for the
[1:00:12] rapture?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; What kind of expectation do we have?
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; When is the church ready for rapture?
[1:00:21] Speak of this little local church.
[1:00:24] What? How would you think that people
[1:00:27] that go in the rapture will be shining
[1:00:30] lighting out of this little group here?
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Oh, that mean ah
[1:00:34] that guy is ready for rapture or that
[1:00:37] sister's ready for rapture. How will it
[1:00:39] be?
[1:00:45] [laughter]
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; I trust we can say praise the Lord.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; You understand? Are we ret?
[1:00:53] Well, if it was a good day, yes. A bad
[1:00:55] day, no. No. God is not running his
[1:00:58] business like this.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; I know. Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; God is not depending on your mental
[1:01:03] stage for the rapture.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; It's a for me it's a it's a wonderful
[1:01:16] thing. And uh and so as I as I was
[1:01:19] pondering and and then brother listen
[1:01:21] listen what he what he what he's in
[1:01:23] Christ the mystery of God he makes a
[1:01:26] again a very amazing a very amazing
[1:01:29] statement about the the coming the
[1:01:33] change of the body or the rapture in
[1:01:35] itself.
[1:01:36] Listen what brother said. I know you
[1:01:38] have read it maybe many times. Uh but as
[1:01:41] I even with our own church at home
[1:01:43] sometimes you know the things that the
[1:01:46] the um modern events bring things out
[1:01:50] what brother Brandham said to a new
[1:01:52] light.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; absolutely to a new light.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. things that happening around us
[1:01:59] for me many times bring things brother
[1:02:01] Brandham because you know we have we are
[1:02:04] as message believers we are used to
[1:02:07] quote brother Brandham
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; and if we are really faithful we say
[1:02:12] what the prophet said
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; right
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; but I I really want also to to um maybe
[1:02:21] allow us to to ponder about how can we
[1:02:26] really say what brother Brennan said
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; if we don't see what he saw
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; it
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; we just become parents
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; repeating
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; you know I trust it it doesn't bother
[1:02:48] someone
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; you're not called to be parents
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; that's right Paul said Paul said Brother
[1:02:56] Brandham said, Brother Ram said,
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham spoke something,
[1:03:03] he saw something.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; That's you know, when you really want to
[1:03:08] repeat me, really want to say what I
[1:03:11] say, you have to see what I see.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Is it right? Yes.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; And that's why the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:03:20] today is called to see
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; what brother Renan saw.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; John, come up hither.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Come up hither. [cheering]
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And John said, "And I come and I came
[1:03:32] hither and I saw
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; for myself."
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And when you see for yourself, then you
[1:03:37] can quote, right?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Remember, Satan is very good in quoting
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; the scripture. Yeah,
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; he's very good.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; What do you do when Satan throws the
[1:03:50] truth at you?
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; As he did with Jesus.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; He was That was a temptation by the way.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; It was a temptation by the way.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Where Satan said, "It is written."
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is written.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; And how did Jesus answer? He was not
[1:04:14] disqualifying the scripture.
[1:04:18] He was not even putting uh some commands
[1:04:21] to it. He said it is also written.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; That was his answer.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; You know why Jesus could say that?
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Because he saw
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; He saw what it was when it was spoken.
[1:04:34] It is written.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I believe really as we as we go
[1:04:42] on and we we we see we we uh we see
[1:04:45] where the prophet is modern events as
[1:04:49] the Holy Spirit is still present and the
[1:04:52] five-foot ministry is doing their what
[1:04:55] their work what they have to do.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; And the five foot ministry is doing this
[1:05:01] is this you don't get just by listening
[1:05:03] to tapes.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Sorry to say so.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not what you because I I I
[1:05:09] I I meet people they listen to tapes all
[1:05:12] the days of their life
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; and they don't know you know you know we
[1:05:16] have a wonderful example in the
[1:05:18] scripture it's it everything is nothing
[1:05:21] new under the sun you know that
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; that's what the Bible said
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; so in the time of Jesus we had faithful
[1:05:27] tapelessness
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; that missed everything
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; called the disciples of John,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; They called even themselves. We They
[1:05:44] were the disciples of John.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; What were they? They followed John,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; They followed the the forerunner.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:59] Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; When Paul met them in the upper coast of
[1:06:02] Ephesus after 30 years,
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; okay,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; later,
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Paul asked him, "Hey, did do have you
[1:06:09] received the Holy Ghost?"
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; They said, "What Holy Ghost?"
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; So, this was the group that was very
[1:06:20] true to the forerunner,
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; stayed with what he said,
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; recoted him every day,
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; listened to it. Sorry when I say that.
[1:06:28] listen to a tape every day and missed
[1:06:30] it.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Totally.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; What God was doing.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, church.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; So, we are INVITED AS A BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:06:42] CHRIST. COME ON. BROTHER RANOM IS GONE.
[1:06:46] But but brother even made those
[1:06:48] statements. He said, "Two of us cannot
[1:06:49] be at the same time."
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; If that is true that he is here now,
[1:06:53] then I must decrease and he must
[1:06:55] increase.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Who is that? He that's Christ himself.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; That's Christ himself. Not not another
[1:07:00] prophet, not another messenger. Yet it
[1:07:03] is the messenger of all messengers. But
[1:07:05] because the messenger of the church age
[1:07:07] always was the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and let me drop that little in
[1:07:15] just to think about just to understand
[1:07:18] also what what happened at the end of
[1:07:20] Laia. Do we believe we live in the end
[1:07:23] of Lisia?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? Yeah,
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; we don't know. We we don't put it we
[1:07:28] don't put a time to it, you know. Is it
[1:07:30] is is it now 1977 or was it later or you
[1:07:34] know we are not the shortest age anymore
[1:07:37] anyhow.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Up just a few years I think it was two
[1:07:43] or three years ago was still the
[1:07:45] shortest but now Ephesus is the
[1:07:48] shortest.
[1:07:50] Uhhuh.
[1:07:51] So is Ludicia over? Are we in Ludicia
[1:07:55] still?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. But this is not what I want to do.
[1:08:00] We don't want to go in numbers this
[1:08:02] evening.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Uh because we are not found in the book
[1:08:05] of numbers. [laughter]
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; But rather allow me to say brother make
[1:08:12] a very amazing statement. Let me read
[1:08:14] that before we go here. Brother said you
[1:08:17] know it's God's great mystery of how is
[1:08:20] a secret. He kept it secret. Nobody knew
[1:08:23] about his coming. Even the ages didn't
[1:08:26] understand it. That's the reason why
[1:08:28] under our seventh mystery when the
[1:08:30] seventh seal was opened there was
[1:08:31] silence. Uh you know and when they asked
[1:08:35] Jesus when he was here when it will be
[1:08:38] he said not even the son knows.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; When
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; right when.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And brother said the when and the how is
[1:08:47] a great secret.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Right. The when and the how is a great
[1:08:50] secret. But to me, the when is not so
[1:08:54] important anymore.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; To me, the how became much more
[1:08:58] important
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; because I don't know. I don't care when
[1:09:03] it happens.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; It's important to me that I see how it
[1:09:07] happens.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; You are with me,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; So, if it is now this year or next year
[1:09:13] or over next year or over next year, I
[1:09:16] don't care. It comes when the Lord has
[1:09:19] put his time plan.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; But I want to see how it is happening.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Then I'm a part of it.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Then I'm not waiting for the rapture.
[1:09:28] Then I am the rapture. Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Remember all I think it was a prophet
[1:09:33] speaking of that that old fellow that
[1:09:35] came to church one day and the church
[1:09:37] was in a total mess and uproar and
[1:09:39] everybody was totally confused because
[1:09:41] somebody I don't know if if if there was
[1:09:43] a vision or a dream or whatever and they
[1:09:45] has they they had made up their mind in
[1:09:48] the church the rapture has taken place
[1:09:50] and they are left behind and here that
[1:09:52] old old brother I think brother Adam is
[1:09:54] the story of the prophet that he tells
[1:09:56] that old man came into the church I
[1:09:58] think he said he was a old color brother
[1:10:00] came into the church and he said, "What
[1:10:02] are you so so so yeah have not heard it?
[1:10:04] The rapture has taken place and and the
[1:10:07] the bride's gone and we're left behind."
[1:10:09] He said, "That's not possible."
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "HOW HOW DO YOU KNOW?" HE I
[1:10:15] SPOKE to him this morning.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And he never said me nothing about
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; you understand what what IF YOU KNOW HOW
[1:10:23] IT HAPPENED, how it happening, nothing
[1:10:25] can disturb.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. because you were a part of it.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; But and really really just only to drop
[1:10:34] that shortly in I might go in when I go
[1:10:37] to a higher I might go a little deeper
[1:10:38] into it to brother Chad Lamb we go there
[1:10:40] because it's something that really
[1:10:41] puzzled not puzzled me but really gave
[1:10:44] me so much light that we understand
[1:10:46] really who is here right now.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Who is present with us.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham spoke of someone when
[1:10:52] he said my ministry is to declare him
[1:10:54] that he is here now.
[1:10:56] He was not speaking of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:58] that was there through the church ages.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; That was right.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; But now somebody is here. Brother Wan
[1:11:04] said,
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; right? And and so he I said I'm laying
[1:11:07] the platform not for a new messenger,
[1:11:09] not for another messenger, not for a
[1:11:10] great man, but for for the Holy Ghost
[1:11:13] himself.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Now, now allow me few minutes, just a
[1:11:18] few minutes only to lighten that up. is
[1:11:20] we understand that brother Brandham was
[1:11:22] the the messenger to the Lysian
[1:11:25] churches. Is that right?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; We understand that Paul was the
[1:11:30] messenger to Ephesus.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; We understand Arinius was the messenger
[1:11:35] to Smyrna.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; We understand Martin was the messenger
[1:11:39] to Pergamon. We understand Columbus was
[1:11:41] the messenger to Tyara. We understand
[1:11:44] Luther was the messenger to the Zadis
[1:11:46] Zadian church age. We understand Wesley
[1:11:49] was the messenger to the Philadelphiaian
[1:11:51] church age. I asked you a question. When
[1:11:55] is the messenger coming?
[1:12:02] When is the messenger coming?
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Wen would say the messenger is
[1:12:11] always coming at the end of the age.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's right.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Now, did brother Venom came at the end
[1:12:21] of Lisia?
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Very very very just just give me a few
[1:12:29] minutes you will understand who came at
[1:12:32] the end of Ludicia is Christ himself.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Luther didn't came at the end of
[1:12:41] Ephesus.
[1:12:43] Luther came at the end at the end of
[1:12:46] Judaism,
[1:12:49] right?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; And started the churches of heaven,
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, Paul, sorry, Paul. Thank you very
[1:12:58] much. Arinius
[1:13:00] didn't come at the end of
[1:13:03] Arinius come at the end of Ephesus.
[1:13:10] Brother Brandham, when did brother Renom
[1:13:12] came? Brother Ram came at the end of
[1:13:14] Philadelphia
[1:13:16] as Philadelphia was closing here the
[1:13:19] prophet came right Philadelphia was 1750
[1:13:23] to 1906 and brother Renham was born
[1:13:26] 1909.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Renom made the statement the
[1:13:31] messenger always comes at the end of the
[1:13:34] old age.
[1:13:40] Just for us to ponder who is present
[1:13:43] right now.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Just to ponder who is present right now.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Who who came? Why did brother because it
[1:13:58] was now the end of Laudisia was coming.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And then we understand the great
[1:14:02] happening in the life that changed
[1:14:04] brother Renham's ministry so much. You
[1:14:07] understand that?
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; That changed his ministry.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; And he was the church age messenger all
[1:14:14] the way through. But he WAS MORE THAN
[1:14:16] JUST the church age messenger. Is that
[1:14:18] right?
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; He had more ministries.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; He had the he had the Moses ministry to
[1:14:24] bring the people out. Yeah.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; But he also had the Joshua ministry to
[1:14:27] bring the people in. Is that correct?
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; So we see in that that's why we see a
[1:14:32] change in the ministry of William Brham.
[1:14:34] So it was not SO MUCH MORE HIM BUT IT
[1:14:36] WAS NOW Christ in him
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; in such a different way than it was in
[1:14:41] the beginning. Is that right? Come on
[1:14:42] church.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; It was in the be you know just read what
[1:14:46] the messenger is telling to the Louise
[1:14:48] church age.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; What a MESSAGE HE HE BRINGS TO THE
[1:14:52] CHURCH AGE.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And then watch how the prophet would say
[1:14:56] the Holy Spirit woke me up one night and
[1:14:59] he told me you pick up the pen and write
[1:15:01] now. Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; So then BROTHER BRANDHAM ACTUALLY WAS
[1:15:07] writing something that the Holy Spirit
[1:15:09] himself dictated him.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because the messenger of
[1:15:16] all messengers was present. Now
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand in what we are
[1:15:26] confronted all those years
[1:15:30] something that will maybe uh quite
[1:15:34] enlightened me very much.
[1:15:37] You can study it. You can go home and
[1:15:39] really look it up. For me it was so I
[1:15:43] was I was shocked actually when I found
[1:15:45] that out as as studying the messengers.
[1:15:49] We know about the messenger Cola. Yeah.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:15:54] If you study his life, it was Columba
[1:15:56] from France according to the prophet
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; and you know the Holy Spirit how the
[1:16:02] Holy Spirit vindicated as the prophet
[1:16:04] was looking for the messengers
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; how the Holy Spirit vindicated
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; right
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Mr. Let let me call him Mr. Columba
[1:16:15] never lived one day
[1:16:19] in the church age that he was messenger
[1:16:21] to.
[1:16:24] He was born before his church age
[1:16:26] started and he died before his church
[1:16:29] age started.
[1:16:33] I found that amazing.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I found that amazing just to show the
[1:16:38] principle that the messenger always
[1:16:41] comes at the end of the former. Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; So that's why William Brham the message
[1:16:45] to the churches of Lisia came at the end
[1:16:48] of Philadelphia
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; to open up. Come on church
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; to open up the new church age.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; So who came at the end of Ludicia?
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; It was Christ
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; in William
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Brandon.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; You see the change of the ministry in
[1:17:06] his ministry.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; To really understand where we are at. So
[1:17:12] this is NOT JUST BROTHER RANDOM SAID NOW
[1:17:14] IT'S Christ
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; dealing with the church
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; now IT'S CHRIST HIMSELF DEALING WITH the
[1:17:20] believers
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; that's why brother Adam could say I must
[1:17:25] decrease and he must increase I ask you
[1:17:28] a question has he increased
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; SEE MANY TIMES BROTHER BRANDHAM HAS
[1:17:37] increased
[1:17:41] But has Christ increased?
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; We should not just allow brother Random
[1:17:50] to increase.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; We should Christ to increase.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Because brother said, "I have to go." Do
[1:17:59] you know that brother Renham said to the
[1:18:00] people around him, he said to some, he
[1:18:02] said, you know, "As long as I am still
[1:18:05] with you,
[1:18:08] I will be always here and you will be
[1:18:10] here.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "But when I'm gone,
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; you come up to where I am."
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Was it not with Jesus? The same way. One
[1:18:19] day Jesus told his disciple, "It is
[1:18:21] expedient for me to leave you."
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because Jesus was tired
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; of the disciples depending on him.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, one day when they was
[1:18:35] feeding the multitude of people, then
[1:18:38] after a long service, everybody was a
[1:18:40] little nervous. You know, the service is
[1:18:41] very long and the people, you know, so
[1:18:43] many 5,000 I think it were. So, they
[1:18:45] were a little nervous and
[1:18:48] they preached very long. You know, they
[1:18:49] need to go, they need to go home
[1:18:51] shopping and eating. And Jesus said,
[1:18:53] "No, no, they don't need to go." Jesus
[1:18:54] told them, "You make them sit and you
[1:18:56] give them to eat."
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus was saying.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Jesus said no no no not I will
[1:19:02] give them you give them to eat so the
[1:19:04] ability was there for them
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; to do it
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; but because of Jesus was there they
[1:19:10] wouldn't look at it
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; that's why Jesus said it is expedient
[1:19:14] for me that I go
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; hallelujah how expedient it was that
[1:19:20] brother Brandham went
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; come on church
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; it was expedient him to leave the scene
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; because now he Christ had increase.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Where is he increasing? He's increasing
[1:19:33] in you and in me.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Then then don't worry about rapture.
[1:19:40] Don't worry about ready for rapture.
[1:19:42] Don't worry.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not worrying about the rapture.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; I am the rapture.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And I don't say that proudly.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I don't say that arrogant. I say, but I
[1:19:56] know what God has done. That's right.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And and brother Adam said he he said
[1:20:07] Christ the mystery. He said he has
[1:20:08] showed and revealed it in every type
[1:20:10] that is in the Bible. Therefore, the
[1:20:12] Bible is a revelation of God's great
[1:20:14] mystery. The anti Bible is the
[1:20:15] expression of go one great goal that God
[1:20:18] had and and he wanted to achieve in the
[1:20:20] Bible. And all the acts of the believers
[1:20:22] in the Bible has been a type and
[1:20:24] expressing what God's great goal is. and
[1:20:27] the last day has revealed and showed it.
[1:20:30] So you understand? So even even about
[1:20:35] the the change and the rapture, the
[1:20:37] going,
[1:20:39] God has showed it, brother said in the
[1:20:42] types of the Bible. Is that right?
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And so I I when I when it comes to
[1:20:48] rapture ready,
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; I I I I I said, "Lord, okay, uh I just
[1:20:54] want to see in the Bible
[1:20:58] what it was when people was raptured.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; What it meant to them to be ready."
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. what it meant to them
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; because
[1:21:10] we had gladly we had a prophet and the
[1:21:12] prophet told us there was three raptures
[1:21:14] in the Old Testament.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; And there's three pointed out in the
[1:21:18] New. Is that right?
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; So, we are actually rapture number five.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:27] Number six, we understand will be Moses
[1:21:30] and Elijah.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Just maybe start from the end.
[1:21:35] Maybe just start from the end
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; because that will be after the bride is
[1:21:39] gone. Is that right?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; SO, MOSES AND ELIJAH, how you know, HOW
[1:21:45] CAN WE FIND OUT IF they're ready to be
[1:21:48] raptured?
[1:21:49] What is their condition before they are
[1:21:51] raptured?
[1:21:53] Come on.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL BE THEIR STATE OF being before
[1:21:58] they are raptured?
[1:22:00] Who knows that they will be they lay
[1:22:04] dead in the streets of Raleam,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; murdered,
[1:22:09] killed.
[1:22:18] Huh?
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Killed by what? Killed by the system.
[1:22:26] That's right.
[1:22:28] The whole world will will make a big
[1:22:30] feast when those two terrorists will lay
[1:22:33] in the streets of Jerusalem. Right?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Come on. This what the Bible says.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; When you would see them laying dead in
[1:22:41] the in in Jerusalem, would you think
[1:22:43] they are rapture ready?
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; I would say God help us.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:58] that that we understand what it means to
[1:23:00] be rapture ready
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; because there you can find
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; you the key that you understand when you
[1:23:09] are ready for rapture
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; you're still with me
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; right
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; I we started from the end because to me
[1:23:18] it is striking you can you imagine they
[1:23:21] get they don't murder themselves they
[1:23:23] get killed
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; right
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; so that means that means means they
[1:23:27] don't have the power and the strength to
[1:23:30] withstand that.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; they do great miracles. Is it right?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; They do before great miracles,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; but now it looks like
[1:23:45] strange left them.
[1:23:49] Hello.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Are we still awake? Wednesday night. I
[1:23:53] know. BUT
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU UNDERSTAND IF THEY WOULD BE
[1:23:56] RAPTURED AS THEY'RE PERFORMING MIRACLES.
[1:23:58] OH YEAH. Easy go.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW THEY THEY DEAD IN THE STREET.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Are they rapture ready?
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, they were.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they are.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; They are rapture READY YET LAYING DEAD
[1:24:13] IN THE STREET.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; KILLED BY THE SYSTEM.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:24:21] Brother said he has showed the things in
[1:24:24] the types and the characters of the
[1:24:26] believers of the Bible.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; So we can understand what it means to be
[1:24:30] rapture ready.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU'RE UP ON THE MOUNTAIN, YOU
[1:24:34] FEEL YOU'RE rapture ready. But what if
[1:24:36] if you are low in the valley? That's
[1:24:38] right.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Facing death,
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; facing cancer.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Are you rapture ready?
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you rapture ready?
[1:24:52] Hallelujah.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; I believe we are further than we think.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? Isn't it
[1:24:59] amazing how God is doing things?
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's let's really let's
[1:25:03] really look let's really look a little
[1:25:04] bit at two the other ones of the Old
[1:25:07] Testament because it becomes very plain,
[1:25:09] very plain what it means to be to be
[1:25:11] rapture ready. The first one that was
[1:25:14] raptured, everyone I think knows knows
[1:25:16] the message. It was Enoch. Is that
[1:25:18] right?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Enoch. No. One thing that is very
[1:25:21] when I was a young Christian, I always
[1:25:24] felt it's not just fair
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; that there's so little written about
[1:25:29] Enoch.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; You know, he was the one that the first
[1:25:33] one that was actually raptured, right?
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; And we don't we do not know so many
[1:25:39] things about him, right?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; We don't know what he has done or what
[1:25:43] he has not done.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I said in the big I said Lord
[1:25:48] why can I not read what he has done and
[1:25:50] not done to know what it is
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; God told me is because it's not your
[1:25:56] life.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You you with me?
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; So the first one was Enoch. We
[1:26:10] understand what we know about him. He
[1:26:11] was the seventh from Adam.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He was the seventh from Adam. If
[1:26:16] you can count, you can see he was the
[1:26:17] seventh from Adam.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we understand, we are the
[1:26:22] seventh from the second Adam.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; We are the seventh from the second Adam.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; So that's why Enoch is actually one of
[1:26:32] the the major types for the rapture for
[1:26:35] us because he was the seventh from the
[1:26:37] first Adam.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; And brother Venom would say seventh
[1:26:40] church age, the seventh from the second
[1:26:42] Adam.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? This is who we are.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; So quickly quickly about Enoch. Is that
[1:26:48] okay when I read you a few things about
[1:26:50] Enoch?
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; But brother Venom said about him.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:26:55] again some things you don't cannot read
[1:26:57] black and white in the Bible but brother
[1:27:00] Venom said it
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; and uh I'm not comparing the Bible and
[1:27:05] then brother Venom finding out who is
[1:27:06] the truth. A prophet is given when a
[1:27:09] prophet says something, it is not to to
[1:27:11] contradict the Bible but to to make the
[1:27:14] Bible more plain to us.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because so many times a
[1:27:19] scripture has a compound meaning.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And how many times we limit it just to
[1:27:24] one meaning. Is that right? If we limit
[1:27:26] a scripture to one meaning, we miss 50%.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful things about Enoch uh we
[1:27:38] don't go into into numbers into into
[1:27:40] accountings but we understand Noah and
[1:27:42] Enoch if you really look at it they
[1:27:45] didn't know one another there was 70
[1:27:47] years gap between Noah and Enoch right
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; if you study you will find out
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; it's very easy actually you can see the
[1:27:55] numbers when he was born so when when
[1:27:58] Noah was born Enoch was not there for
[1:28:01] quite 60 or 70 years and yet brotherham
[1:28:05] that that Enoch and Noah knew one
[1:28:07] another.
[1:28:11] This is what brotherham said.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen, I I read to you you
[1:28:16] can read it. Third seal, first seal in
[1:28:17] in different different statements."
[1:28:19] Brother Wam said, "Let me read third
[1:28:20] seal." He said, "Just like Noah kept
[1:28:23] watching Enoch. And when Enoch went,
[1:28:25] Noah said, "Better get close to the ark.
[1:28:28] The time is at hand." Noah kept watching
[1:28:30] Enoch.
[1:28:33] first seal. What was it like Enoch? You
[1:28:35] know, Noah watched Enoch. For when Enoch
[1:28:38] come up missing, he knowed judgment was
[1:28:40] at hand. He's got he was now hanging
[1:28:43] around the ark.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; So there's something special about Enoch
[1:28:50] like there's something special about the
[1:28:52] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT
[1:28:57] THAT YOU CANNOT EXPLAIN.
[1:29:02] The Bible tells us in Genesis 5 that
[1:29:06] Enoch walked with God how many years
[1:29:10] 365.
[1:29:12] Is that right?
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible said and he was we
[1:29:15] read it in a couple of minutes. If you
[1:29:18] take brother Brham he only said Enoch
[1:29:22] walked 500 years with God
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; only.
[1:29:26] And I have all the quotes printed out.
[1:29:29] It's dozens of them.
[1:29:31] He said in a work with God 500 years
[1:29:33] from the top to the bottom. He never
[1:29:35] said 365.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get confused now.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; But what is WHAT WHAT IS BROTHER TRYING
[1:29:44] TO DO? Trying to understand that Noah
[1:29:47] that Enoch was a special man.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; So the BRIDE OF CHRIST WAS SPECIAL. SO
[1:29:52] THE RAPTURE will be special.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; The change will be different than we
[1:29:57] think. Okay.
[1:30:01] Hallelujah.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, we are so privileged.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; That we had a prophet introducing to us
[1:30:10] that the whole body change will not be a
[1:30:13] mystery to us.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; So we we understand what is going on
[1:30:17] with us and we are we changed already?
[1:30:20] Yes. We are not what we want to be but
[1:30:23] we are not what we were. Amen.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; So that's why we ARE CHANGED FROM GLORY
[1:30:28] unto glory. As we look to the right kind
[1:30:31] of picture,
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; When we look to the right kind of
[1:30:35] picture, WE WILL BE changed into the
[1:30:37] same image.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; I think that's that's so beautiful about
[1:30:47] about Enoch. So So and then brother Rand
[1:30:49] makes statements like that. He he he he
[1:30:52] said when God said to Noah to Enoch one
[1:30:54] day he said Enoch walking after
[1:30:57] accepting in 63 accepting God's provided
[1:31:00] way Enoch after walking 500 years with
[1:31:02] God and God told him Enoch you're not
[1:31:05] going you you're not going to have to
[1:31:06] die
[1:31:08] you want to come up home are you
[1:31:11] homesick Enoch he said yeah Lord I'm
[1:31:13] homesick
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; he said you understand
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Enoch was had the same feelings like we
[1:31:20] have sometimes
[1:31:21] Are you sometimes homesick?
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Are you sometimes sick?
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I've still been here.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; So Enoch was.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Have you walked in
[1:31:38] this pedest house down there long
[1:31:40] enough?" He said, "Yes." He said, "All
[1:31:42] right, just start walking." Enoch needed
[1:31:45] a leather. God give him a highway. That
[1:31:48] was God's way for him. It provided him.
[1:31:51] Come on, church.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not LOOKING FOR A LEATHER BECAUSE
[1:31:54] GOD HAD PLACED ME ON THE HIGHWAY.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Let's go quickly quickly together
[1:32:10] to I know that's for a Wednesday. I know
[1:32:12] that's maybe a little a little, you
[1:32:15] know, much, but I trust you. You know,
[1:32:18] sometimes when you have good food, store
[1:32:20] it quickly.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Put it in place so you can eat it later.
[1:32:24] Okay? [laughter]
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Don't throw it away. Just put it in a
[1:32:29] place you can you can you will enjoy it
[1:32:31] later.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go quickly to Genesis 5.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Genesis 5. And you will see how much it
[1:32:36] is a type on what is happening in our
[1:32:39] day. Enoch. So, Enoch was a man like you
[1:32:44] are.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Enoch had his mood swings like you have.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Enoch had his ups. Enoch had his downs.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; You know why? How I know that? Because I
[1:32:56] have my ups and I have my downs.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Let's read the Genesis 5. Uh Genesis
[1:33:06] Genesis 5. You want to read quickly?
[1:33:10] Beautiful. Genesis 5. Um,
[1:33:14] and all the days of Enoch were 360 and
[1:33:17] five years. And Enoch walked with God
[1:33:20] and he was not for God took him.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; So what happening to Enoch was that God
[1:33:28] took him. Right?
[1:33:32] Now, now allow me to just only very
[1:33:35] short go to because then you understand
[1:33:38] that to Enoch happened
[1:33:41] what happened to us.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now our body is not changed yet.
[1:33:49] We still here. We are waiting for the
[1:33:51] body change. But you understand
[1:33:53] according to Romans, Paul said the body
[1:33:55] change is the last step. The final step
[1:33:59] of redemption is the change of our
[1:34:01] bodies.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; That's the final stage of adoption is
[1:34:08] the change of our body.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; But adoption is more than just the
[1:34:12] change of the body.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and listen how beauty you
[1:34:20] can read it. You can find it out
[1:34:21] yourself. Oh. Uh and Enoch walked with
[1:34:24] God and he was not for God took him.
[1:34:27] That word God took him. You know what
[1:34:29] that means? That means in the I think it
[1:34:33] is in the in the Hebrew or the Greek one
[1:34:36] of them it means to select
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; to take to select to take possession of
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; to take in marriage.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Well, we understand it is
[1:34:54] a husband taking a wife.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; And when a man takes a woman, he takes
[1:35:03] her out of her own family. She receives
[1:35:06] a new name as he is taking her.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] So with other words,
[1:35:17] there was a marriage taking place
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; between God and Enoch.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Is there a marriage taking place in this
[1:35:25] hour?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Is there a marriage taking place? Come
[1:35:29] on. William Brandon was what?
[1:35:30] Revelations 10 is actually a marriage.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; You know that.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1 IS WHAT? IS CHRIST
[1:35:39] HIMSELF.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Can I call him the bridegroom?
[1:35:44] Yes, he is.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; There you see Christ himself. Then you
[1:35:48] see Revelation 10:7 is the marriage
[1:35:51] counselor.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Where's the bride go?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; The bride IS A TYPE JOHN THE TYPE OF THE
[1:35:58] BRIDE.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; That's Revelation 10:8-11. Is that
[1:36:02] right?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; So Revelation 10 actually is a marriage
[1:36:04] that takes place.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; So the same thing that happened to Enoch
[1:36:11] IS HAPPENING TO THE CHURCH TODAY.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF, CHRIST HIMSELF CAME DOWN
[1:36:16] AND HE TOOK A WIFE. THAT'S WHY BROTHER
[1:36:18] ADAM SAID, "It is the invisible union of
[1:36:20] the bride of Christ."
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We understand that.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; So if I WANT TO KNOW WHO ENOCH WAS, WHAT
[1:36:30] ENOCH DID, I have to
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; look who I am.
[1:36:38] Amen.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; So don't be depressed when you are
[1:36:42] depressed.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; DON'T FEEL DON'T DON'T DON'T LET THE
[1:36:49] DEVIL GET YOU MORE DOWN WHEN YOU'RE
[1:36:50] DEPRESSED.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; I would doubt my doubts.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We can cause in this hour we can
[1:37:05] cause the devil a heart attack
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; because finally brother don't know what
[1:37:10] to do with the church.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Come on church.

[1:37:16] Where have we come to? We are believer
[1:37:17] of the message. I say at home many times
[1:37:19] 60 years we have this message. What have
[1:37:22] we come to?
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Because if we have the message we have a
[1:37:25] message and the message is not God sent
[1:37:26] a prophet.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; That's not the message.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; No. Come on.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. If somebody is there that tells
[1:37:34] you here's a message,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; then you want to know what the message
[1:37:37] is.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; And don't come with phrases.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Because we have a message. WE HAVE
[1:37:45] RECEIVED A MESSAGE, RIGHT?
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; What is the message?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's that was that was Enoch.
[1:38:00] Let's let's let's quickly go uh if we
[1:38:02] little time we need to go to the second
[1:38:04] and to the third. The second that was
[1:38:06] raptured was was Elijah.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Was Elijah. Is that right? A man
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; of
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; like same
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; passion
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; passion as we are.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful. It's stated in James,
[1:38:21] right?
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; So the Elijah was of Come on. Come on.
[1:38:24] He was was the same. You can imagine
[1:38:26] what what what what kind of person
[1:38:28] Elijah was
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; and and you understand to what kind of
[1:38:33] of swings he went in his life. We know
[1:38:35] even the scripture reads about it. We
[1:38:37] read it very very very close and then we
[1:38:39] see also the mistakes that he did.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Elijah did mistakes.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; And we in our walk sometimes we just do
[1:38:47] mistakes and make situations worse.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Never change the rapture.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When I saw that, I said, "Praise
[1:38:58] the Lord."
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; GOD IS NOT DEPENDING ON MY SKILL.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; God is the rapture is not depending if I
[1:39:07] feel good.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Actually, brother is preaching the
[1:39:14] rapture. Remember how he was reading
[1:39:16] Psalm 27 as a start of the rapture
[1:39:19] message? And he said, "You will be
[1:39:20] amazed." He said, "What I'm reading,
[1:39:22] maybe you're a little bit confused the
[1:39:24] way I'm starting." He said, "But you
[1:39:26] will find out it will be exactly the way
[1:39:28] that I tell you."
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Psalm 27 is right.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; You all know what it is.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible said, "In time of
[1:39:37] great trouble,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; the brother said, I just want to lay a
[1:39:41] platform, a background for the rapture."
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; So, it will be in time of great trouble,
[1:39:46] he shall set me upon the rock.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, read Psalm 27:1-5. This was
[1:39:55] brother Ram's scripture for the rapture
[1:39:57] message.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; But he was he was he was the second one.
[1:40:03] That was Elijah, as we have read in in
[1:40:05] in James 5, a man of like passions. That
[1:40:09] means in the Greek, of like feelings and
[1:40:12] like affections.
[1:40:15] That was Elijah.
[1:40:17] That was Elijah.
[1:40:19] A man that was raptured. Is that right?
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; That was Elijah. A man of So with with
[1:40:24] other words, if you come to Elijah one
[1:40:27] of the one of the days and you tell him
[1:40:29] what you went through, he said, "I know
[1:40:30] I went through the same stuff."
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I think it's so beautiful. Allow me
[1:40:40] to say first
[1:40:43] um how many miracles Elijah did.
[1:40:48] How many miracles Elijah did?
[1:40:52] So you can some some I I understand some
[1:40:54] say eight, some say 16. Okay. Depends
[1:40:56] how you count. But once we once we know
[1:41:00] Elisha
[1:41:02] did double.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; So the amount of miracles that you have
[1:41:09] in your life does not make you rapture
[1:41:13] ready.
[1:41:19] Otherwise, Elisha should have been
[1:41:21] raptured
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; because he had more miracles than
[1:41:24] Elijah.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; So, it's not the amount of miracles that
[1:41:33] you do in your life
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; that makes you ready for the rapture.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Yeah.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; When do we feel we are rapture ready?
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; You know when a miracle I remember I I
[1:41:49] you know the Lord did many miracles in
[1:41:52] my life with me and I I was I was
[1:41:54] witness of of even raising dead a dead
[1:41:57] person.
[1:41:59] I remember I I'm very careful to say
[1:42:01] that because because I I remember I was
[1:42:03] once preaching in a in a place that was
[1:42:05] in Switzerland and there was a there was
[1:42:08] a a p the pastor there and after the
[1:42:10] service after we were in the fellowship
[1:42:12] hall and the pastor had some kind of a
[1:42:15] fit and he passed on and he was laying
[1:42:18] on the ground and they they had a
[1:42:21] registered nurse in the church and she
[1:42:23] went down to him looked at his eyes and
[1:42:25] she told me he's gone.
[1:42:28] Okay, that was and the brother had a had
[1:42:31] a it was was an interesting brother. He
[1:42:33] just said, you know, when I once fall
[1:42:36] dead,
[1:42:37] don't bring me back.
[1:42:41] That was he always told his church, you
[1:42:42] know, when I die, I die. Don't bring me
[1:42:44] back. [laughter]
[1:42:46] Don't, you know, don't make any moves
[1:42:48] with machines and stuff. And so, as as I
[1:42:51] saw him laying dead, I I knew that was
[1:42:54] his command to the church. So he
[1:42:57] but then I said but then I told the
[1:42:58] church but he never told us not to pray
[1:43:00] for him. Okay.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; I said the church said he never told us
[1:43:05] not to pray. Okay. So I said I just
[1:43:07] grabbed the hand of a of a of a man of
[1:43:09] the church said let's pray for him
[1:43:10] quickly. So we prayed for the brother
[1:43:12] that was laying there. He came back to
[1:43:14] life.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; You know what a good feeling that was
[1:43:19] when I went from that place. I said, "My
[1:43:21] goodness,
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; what is going on?"
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Was I rapture ready then?
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; You understand the amount of miracles?
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE FOUNDATION TO be rapture
[1:43:37] ready.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Because Elisha was not You know how
[1:43:42] Elisha went on? You know how Elisha, the
[1:43:46] guy was a the man was a double portion?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Is it has did a double portion?
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; The man with a double portion. You know
[1:43:54] how he died?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he died with his
[1:44:00] sickness.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; He died not on his sickness.
[1:44:09] No believer dies because of a sickness.
[1:44:14] You you die with his sickness.
[1:44:18] But brother said a believer dies when
[1:44:20] his time has come.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? Come on
[1:44:25] church.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; So when Elijah's time had come, he died
[1:44:29] with a sickness.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; You know, God had a plan.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; God had a wonderful plan with Elijah. He
[1:44:43] had a plan with Elisha. That's why
[1:44:46] Elisha was raptured, right?
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, come on, church. If we had time,
[1:44:50] we could could could could
[1:44:53] Elisha was much more of a Oh my my my
[1:44:58] God help me. Elisha was much more of a
[1:45:01] kind person at the end. Elisha was just
[1:45:05] judgmental.
[1:45:07] Elisha started very judgmental, but at
[1:45:10] the end, Elisha, you remember how Elisha
[1:45:12] was cursing those children?
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And brother, it was not pleasing
[1:45:16] to the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; It was a It was an angry prophet.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; But Elisha learned that Elisha grew out
[1:45:25] of it.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; And when Elijah When Elisha Come on,
[1:45:28] church. When Elisha actually was more of
[1:45:30] a kind person
[1:45:33] that should be raptured.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; You understand me?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; And trust we can see. So when it comes
[1:45:42] to be a nice person, El Elisha was much
[1:45:46] more nicer than Elijah.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; So the rapture
[1:45:52] is not depending how nice you are.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; I trust you understand that right.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; I speak to Holy Ghost fil people. Right.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on church.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; And yet we are Holy Ghost fil. We we
[1:46:09] still have our character. We still have
[1:46:11] our being.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:15] And some are nice, some are not so nice.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Be honest. Be honest
[1:46:20] to yourself.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Some are nice. They have nice jeans from
[1:46:23] their parents and grandparents. Some
[1:46:25] not.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT CONTROLLING US, BUT IT'S STILL
[1:46:30] THERE. IS THAT CORRECT?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; After after Pentecost, Peter was still
[1:46:37] Peter. He wasn't suddenly Thomas or
[1:46:39] Paul.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; He was still Peter. Right. Come on.
[1:46:43] Yeah.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; He was full of the Holy Ghost and yet he
[1:46:45] was Peter.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Is that correct? PAUL AFTER HE WAS FULL
[1:46:48] OF THE HOLY GHOST, HE STILL WAS PAUL.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Not so.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Come on, church.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Paul had complexes?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; All his life. You know that.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; So that means even with the Holy Ghost,
[1:47:05] you can have complexes. He had such a
[1:47:07] great complex. You know why? Because he
[1:47:10] killed Steven,
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:13] He was witness remember who who was
[1:47:16] taking the clothes of Steven.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Paul was there.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; And that never Paul can never over it.
[1:47:22] He never came over it.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; That was such a sting in him that he was
[1:47:27] how unspiritual he had been.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; And remember how how he he oh my
[1:47:35] goodness how he wanted to you know he
[1:47:38] wanted to die.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:41] Remember
[1:47:43] when when he wanted to go to Jerusalem,
[1:47:46] I think it was and the Holy Spirit spoke
[1:47:49] to Agabus, I think it was.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; They said don't go.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit telling to a prophet
[1:47:56] don't go. All the other people the
[1:47:58] spirit was leading him telling him don't
[1:47:59] go and Paul was persuading them because
[1:48:03] of a complex.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; All the people said the will of the Lord
[1:48:07] be done.
[1:48:11] You're with me. Come on, church.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; This was a prophet.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; This was the messenger. So that means
[1:48:17] even AFTER HE WAS FULL OF THE HOLY
[1:48:19] GHOST, HE HAD BATTLE WITH HIMSELF.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Come on, church.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready?
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Give me Give me a few minutes. uh
[1:48:35] because we we don't want to go to Jesus
[1:48:37] because that that becomes more more
[1:48:39] obvious. But you can study it yourself.
[1:48:41] [laughter]
[1:48:42] But here is here's but here's here's uh
[1:48:45] listen here's Elijah. Here he's Elijah
[1:48:46] and very very very um amazing. Let's go
[1:48:49] quick to first kings quick. We want to
[1:48:51] read that scripture at least. First
[1:48:53] Kings, we want to read quickly that
[1:48:56] scriptures. First Kings uh 19. We want
[1:48:59] to read quickly
[1:49:02] and this might be a help also for us
[1:49:04] because here Elijah we can see a mistake
[1:49:09] and it's so amazing
[1:49:13] but a mistake that you do sometimes
[1:49:15] because of who you're in
[1:49:19] the mistake that you do doesn't stop you
[1:49:22] from being rapture ready.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; When I look to people, I, you know, when
[1:49:32] I look to myself
[1:49:35] [sighs and gasps] many times, you can be
[1:49:36] disappointed. You say, "Lord, why? Why
[1:49:39] I'm struggling so much?"
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And then Satan brings you down.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You understand? Or he tries to brings
[1:49:48] you down. Yeah.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; But then the word comes in and said look
[1:49:52] then you can say Satan whatever
[1:49:55] condition I am
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; I will be raptured.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Closing with Elisha.
[1:50:08] Remember when Elisha finally died with
[1:50:11] his sickness? They had not even time to
[1:50:13] give him a proper funeral.
[1:50:17] Right.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Because they were in the time of war.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Time of war.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; So they just open quickly a grave and
[1:50:25] throw the body in. Had not even time to
[1:50:28] proper close it.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; God is doing great things in an unusual
[1:50:35] way.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; You remember how then one of the
[1:50:39] soldiers want to get killed?
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; And because they had no grave of war,
[1:50:43] they said, "Hey, the grave is still
[1:50:45] open. Let's quickly put him on. That was
[1:50:49] the solution for that.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Never. Nobody thought of rising up and
[1:50:55] it was just the regular routine.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Hey, let's throw him in there.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Let's throw him in there.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; And as THEY THROW HIM, NOBODY EXPECTED A
[1:51:03] MIRACLE.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:13] And nobody's expecting with you America
[1:51:16] it will happen. [cheering]
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Come on brother.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; We I know the time is going with this.
[1:51:22] We're closing
[1:51:24] with uh first kings 19 quickly. We want
[1:51:27] to read and about quickly about um
[1:51:30] Elijah. Listen listen very carefully
[1:51:32] about Elijah. Elijah and see how that
[1:51:35] follows him till the rapture.
[1:51:42] And Ahab told Jezebel all the things
[1:51:44] Elijah had done and with with all the
[1:51:46] slain all the prophets with the sword.
[1:51:47] And then Jezebel sent a messenger unto
[1:51:49] Elijah saying, "So let the gods do to me
[1:51:52] as more also if I make not thy life as
[1:51:55] the life of one of them by tomorrow
[1:51:57] about this time." And when he saw that
[1:52:00] he arose, he went for his life and came
[1:52:03] to Bashiba which belongs to Judah.
[1:52:05] Listen very carefully.
[1:52:08] and he left his servant there.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; That was the greatest mistake he did.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; This is what many times you do as a
[1:52:17] great mistake.
[1:52:22] You know why? Why did why did why he
[1:52:24] left his servant there? Because if
[1:52:27] somebody is going to a depression, he
[1:52:28] want to be alone.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; So if you go to a depression, don't make
[1:52:34] the mistake to stay alone.
[1:52:38] come to church.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Don't stay home.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; If you are really under big depression,
[1:52:51] don't stay home. Don't stay alone.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; There he made his mistake. He left his
[1:52:58] servant and the servant has to obey.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Not so Elijah. [laughter]
[1:53:07] Come on.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, we we and and listen very carefully.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; it's beautiful. I said, but he himself
[1:53:15] went days for four journey into the
[1:53:17] wilderness and came down and sat down
[1:53:18] under tree and he requested for himself
[1:53:21] that he might die and said, Lord, it is
[1:53:23] enough now, Lord. Oh, take away my life
[1:53:26] for I am not better than any of my
[1:53:27] fathers.
[1:53:29] Can you IMAGINE A MAN LIKE THIS UNDER
[1:53:31] SUCH a that just has done such a great
[1:53:33] miracle and things coming under such a
[1:53:36] mood swing that that he even trying to
[1:53:40] die.
[1:53:43] He said Lord I I just want to die. The
[1:53:46] service would tell him different. The
[1:53:48] ser the servant would tell him his
[1:53:50] purpose.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Come on church. Yeah.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; When you come to church, there is WHERE
[1:53:56] IT'S TOLD YOUR PURPOSE to you.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; That's why when you are in a depression,
[1:54:01] don't stay home. Don't separate yourself
[1:54:03] from people.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; But this was Elijah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; A man of like passion.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Rapture material
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; ready.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; You know, on the day here in with that
[1:54:20] we closing because really the time is
[1:54:22] up. With that we're closing. You know at
[1:54:25] when the time you know at the time when
[1:54:28] he was taken up he went from Gilgal to
[1:54:31] Beth to Jericho to the Jordan.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; A wonderful journey. Watch him
[1:54:41] as he went to Bethl. You know what he
[1:54:43] told Elisha?
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Wait for me.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Wait for me. I want to be alone.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Oh boy.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; You know what Elisha said? Nope.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; And Elijah COULDN'T SAY, "BUT YOU ARE MY
[1:54:56] SERVANT."
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; So Elijah ex accepted
[1:55:06] fellowship.
[1:55:08] They came to They came to Gilgal. The
[1:55:11] same story.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Elisha said, "You know what? Elisha
[1:55:15] Terry here."
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; And Elisha said,
[1:55:24] Come on, church.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; You understand? ELIJAH ON HIS WAY to be
[1:55:28] raptured.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; They came to Jericho.
[1:55:40] So that allow me to say that the
[1:55:42] depression was so much on him.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; That he said again to Elisha, "You know
[1:55:48] what, Elisha? Tell me here. I want to go
[1:55:50] alone. And Elisha said, "No."
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; No. They come to the Jordan. You
[1:56:01] understand that?
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; They go through the Jordan.
[1:56:05] They do a miracle not to show to anybody
[1:56:08] but to walk dry food through it.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:56:15] But then as they stand on the other
[1:56:17] side, Elijah is still a man of like
[1:56:22] passion like we are.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Rapture ready.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; If you would have time to go to Jesus,
[1:56:35] when do you think he was rapture ready?
[1:56:38] When he was born. When he was riding on
[1:56:40] the donkey. When he was doing great
[1:56:43] miracles. when he was making WATER TO
[1:56:44] WINE OR when he was hanging at the cross
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; when he was in the garden of Gethsemane
[1:56:50] three times.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; The spirit had left him.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; When the spirit had left him, was he
[1:56:56] rapture ready?
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; The spirit had to leave him.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Because he had to die as a man.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yes.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; So if you have to if you walk through a
[1:57:14] situation in your life that YOU HAVE TO
[1:57:16] DO FOR YOUR LIFE PURPOSE,
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; come on church.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what it is,
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; you're still raptured.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing?
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Amazing. Wonderful.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; What would you think of Jesus hanging at
[1:57:29] the cross crying lover,
[1:57:32] MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAS THOU FORSAKEN
[1:57:35] ME? WAS he rapture ready?
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Was he rapture ready?
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; This
[1:57:49] became the voice of the resurrection.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Because he cried out with
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; voice. That's right.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; First time he said, "My God, my God, why
[1:58:00] has the second?" And then again he cried
[1:58:03] out with a Lloyd voice. You know what it
[1:58:04] was? It is finished.
[1:58:08] Was
[1:58:10] he rapture ready?
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; And
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; another rapture took place.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; So, I believe we can be rapture ready
[1:58:25] every moment
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; in our lives.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Can we understand that?
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let us enter our feet.
[1:58:38] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Thank you, Lord. [applause]
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; There was a man on the cross. There was
[1:58:48] a malfector on the cross, right? There
[1:58:50] was a man that was hanging with Jesus on
[1:58:52] the cross.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, here we go.
[1:58:58] You know that he was the last one that
[1:59:00] came in. Is that right?
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus told him
[1:59:05] today
[1:59:07] You will be with me in paradise.
[1:59:10] Remember that man was the last one to
[1:59:12] enter paradise.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Belonged to the group that was raptured
[1:59:19] out of there.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Brother said that was the first rapture
[1:59:24] in the New Testament.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; The Old Testament saints rose.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Was the manifactor with them? Oh yes. Is
[1:59:32] that correct?
[1:59:34] He was the last one that came to
[1:59:36] paradise. Is that right?
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And he was taken out of paradise as the
[1:59:42] Bible would say. He would he [music]
[1:59:44] would he would capture captivity.
[1:59:50] Jesus Christ did. Is that right?
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready? How? He just had
[2:00:02] the right attitude.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; He just told to the other malfector on
[2:00:05] the cross, we deserve our punishment
[2:00:08] because we have done wrong, but this man
[2:00:11] has done nothing wrong.
[2:00:14] And then he said, remember me. You know
[2:00:16] what Jesus said, today you will be with
[2:00:18] me in paradise.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; And not only with me in paradise,
[2:00:22] because I come to empty out paradise.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[2:02:52] turned into blood.
[2:02:56] Yet he was rapture [music] ready.

[2:03:04] forsaken me?"
[2:03:06] And yet he was rapture ready.
[2:03:10] Hallelujah.
[2:03:12] Father, and we understand that the voice
[2:03:14] of the resurrection,

[2:03:21] them out of the paradise called them
[2:03:23] out, the same voice is here [music] this
[2:03:26] evening.
[2:03:28] The same voice
[2:03:30] is here this evening. [music]
[2:03:32] And as your prophet told us, that voice
[2:03:36] is now [music] in the church.
[2:03:39] She is the voice under her messenger.

[2:05:25] I was just I was praying so that so the
[2:05:29] time would [music] just stop. I was
[2:05:31] trying to be Joshua tonight. I said,
[2:05:33] "Lord, hold the time at 8:00 I mean at
[2:05:37] 9:00. Let's just stay at 9:00 for
[2:05:39] [music] the next two hours." Praise the

[2:05:56] know uh brother but Andrew was talking
[2:05:58] about uh uh uh Enoch years that he lived
[2:06:03] for many years it's it bothered me I
[2:06:06] really [music] and and I I I preached
[2:06:09] there many time ago
[2:06:11] and the Lord really helped me because
[2:06:14] you have to understand that Moses was
[2:06:17] the one that wrote Genesis
[2:06:20] and Moses wrote Genesis by vision
[2:06:27] and
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; uh and brother Brandon make us to
[2:06:30] understand that from the angle that
[2:06:33] Moses was with what was revealed to him
[2:06:37] it was what he recorded
[2:06:40] and that's the way the prophet spoke.
[2:06:43] So Moses saw 360
[2:06:47] something days of Enoch life. The rest
[2:06:50] was not revealed to him. [laughter]
[2:06:55] The rest was not revealed to him. He
[2:06:57] earnestly recorded what he saw. [music]
[2:07:01] He was not in the Garden of Eden.
[2:07:03] Everything he wrote about the Garden of
[2:07:05] Eden were by vision. Yeah.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; And here is a prophet comes on the scene
[2:07:13] and he gave us the rest of in life.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; The part that Moses never saw.
[2:07:27] [music]
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We we actually had
[2:07:29] church today. We had a good time of
[2:07:31] fellowship before the service this
[2:07:33] evening. [music] So I knew that you will
[2:07:36] enjoy the word. Amen.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; It was it was just amazing. [music] It
[2:07:40] was amazing. And then I I sent brother
[2:07:42] Ariel this song. Are you in the number
[2:07:45] getting ready to leave because that's
[2:07:47] what I wanted for us to sing. [music]
[2:07:49] And then I never had to talk to him
[2:07:51] before the service started. So and uh my
[2:07:55] mind just went off. But
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; uh it was it was really beautiful
[2:07:59] tonight. Let's thank the Lord one more
[2:08:01] time. Father, we just want to be
[2:08:03] grateful to you. We want to be so
