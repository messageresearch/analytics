praise the Lord praise the Lord amen are you glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight and we want to thank the Lord for giving us a time of praying a touch from the Lord will make a big difference amen praise O Lord let's turn to Exodus chapter 19 to 9. Exodus chapter 19. Exodus chapter 19. the Lord has been good the Lord has been gracious water what a wonderful savior that we serve Exodus chapter 19. let's read from verse 1. in the third month when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt the same day came day Into the Wilderness of Sinai for they were Departed from raphidham and will come to the desert of Senate and have passed in the wilderness and there Israel come before the mount and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying those shall their say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel now listen to this listen to this conversation very very very clearly ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I beg you on ego wings and brought you to myself praise the Lord amen have anyone ever experienced being taken on ego range praise the Lord if you if you are saved by grace that's what Grace did for you praise the Lord unless you make your your unless you have made your own way to Salvation to be able to experience that this salvation by the grace of God is what it is to be bad on ego wings you have seen what I did unto the Egyptian and how I beared you on Eagle wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice in be and keep my combining then years shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine now if you listen to this conversation now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed it sounds like God is asking the people to do something does that sound like that if you ever obey my voice indeed and keep my combining praise the Lord but they covered in that God gave to Abraham was an unconditional Covenant right praise the Lord are we together now but if you follow this conversation it looks like God is establishing either a covenant or you have to do this that's how it might sound so you have to listen very carefully now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of praise and a holy nation these are the words which thou shall speak unto the children of Israel and Moses came and called the other people and lay before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him which the Lord told him to go and tell the people not not a commitment as this is my Lord you have to do it it's two different things and all the people answer together and said all that the Lord has spoken we will do and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord amen and the Lord said unto Moses Lord I come on today in a tech Cloud that the people may hear when I speak with them and believe thee forever and Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord let us pray heavenly father in the name of the Lord Jesus we just want to ask your blessings tonight Lord come in a special way father Lord and bless this Wednesday service tonight bless your people in the get so Lord father take your word tonight speak to our hearts o God In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord come up [Music] thank you I had this I had this uh subject so much on my mind that when I came into church tonight I mean as my mind was just so much on what was burning on my heart tonight I want to I want to speak on a subject they are there I want to I want to start and I don't know when I will finish it but it's one of those ones all that the Lord has spoken mm-hmm we will do all that the Lord has spoken we will do praise the Lord all that the Lord have spoken we will do glory be to God now I will take you on the on a little journey tonight before we will We Will We Will Get Down uh to what we want to talk about tonight all that the Lord has spoken we will do take you through uh uh through the scripture and see how we got down to this place but if you if you go back and study you will realize that this was one of the place over and over about Brandon say that we were there a lot of quotes who will read on this subject but this is the place Exodus chapter 19 where is remain the most felter mistake I was going to speak on filter errors before I travel talking about all the different things we were talking about there are some things I wanted to to bring out through the scripture you know the Bible address our mistake in the book of first second John as Saints with an S those are our mistakes praise the Lord and I was like the common saying says it is it is uh you know it is it is human to Earth that's that's what comes with our fallen nature but there is a there is an error that a man or a woman a young boy or a young girl we fall into either by their choice or by deception that would become a filter mistake in your life praise the Lord amen and uh one of those ones are the ones that is very common you know brother Branham in him in an instance give him message uh uh speak on that uh uh when he was talking about the virtues that were giving giving to the woman for Redemption you know and then he he talks about those three virtues and then he says if you might want he says uh uh you know uh you you you you will be forgiving he says but you will not be justified praise the Lord now those are some of the areas where you can say there's a filter mistake when the children of Israel said let his sin be upon us and on our children that was a fatal mistake praise the Lord and right here this is one of the the Fatal mistake that Israel made when they said all that the Lord has spoken we will do praise the Lord and how many times I've read through this chapter and uh and I've heard brother Brandon talking about it how the people for so Grace and they decided to take long and I've I've always played on my mind and and and and I I really wanted to to see it you know well you can you can see it brother Brandon says you know God God wanted to speak to the people they said no let Moses speak unto us you know uh uh you speak unto Moses and Moses will come to speak unto us now I've always used that as as where the people talk Lord and and reject Grace until recently uh we at home who was reading through the uh the book of Exodus and I came to this verse all that the people have spoken we would do and and it just stuck on my mind and now I kept thinking about it uh in in that the first time I look at it to me it was looking like an interesting verse it was looking like the people were taking a commitment but when you study the scripture you will realize that this was a defined statement praise the Lord this was a very defined statement as we look through the scripture as we will study tonight and I pray that the grace of God will be able to help us amen as we look at this now David said something in Psalm 109 let's read that Psalm 109 brother Brandon uh I took there when he preached a message God being misunderstood and you will see how this will soon tied into what we want to look at tonight praise the Lord Psalm 109 praise the Lord now as we as we look into this as you will look into this let me let me help myself here this like um I'm a little bit off praise the Lord are we together okay now let's go ahead oh I will try to grab myself right in here trying to get ahead of myself a little bit now so we see here that uh Israel in the air joining they came through the rare sheet and uh we saw how God stood for his people and and give them a great victory he gave them a very Mighty victory uh in the uh in their walk with the Lord opened the red seed even the calling of Moses the prophet we saw the grace of God coming down just like we try to show this going uh Sunday why it was called the shout of the king in the camp of Israel because of the way that God manifested himself the provision that he gave to his people praise the Lord and uh brother Branham shared this this caught my mind when I was telling the message or he saw by himself he the prophet of God says I got out in the wilderness talking about Israel said oh give us something to do we want to form an organization and we want you to give us something to do let us let us make us something like that give us a law to keep Exodus 19 was the greatest mistake that Israel ever made praise the Lord when Grace has already provided their salvation then they wanted something to do to marinate God already sold to Abraham what he was going to do and he said let us have a lord and the Lord never did no one never kept it they never did praise the Lord amen so we see here the other there was Israel fatal mistake there was an awful mistake and as we'll realize that uh is it has been that way with men I'm trying to find a place to put my foot here tonight believing that the Lord will be able to to grant us Grace you'll be able to grant us Grace the Lord that the Lord in his Mercy will be able to grant us Grace Hallelujah amen [Music] now when Israel came through the Red Sea we all know the story Exodus chapter 15 that was when Moses raised his hands and he sank and he praised the Lord Miriam took the tambourine and she beat and she danced and praised the Lord but then we saw that after in Exodus chapter 16 just follow me in a little bit yeah right after that great victory in Exodus chapter 14 where we witnessed Exodus 13 there the pillar of fire going and defending them you know uh uh the the Egyptians were running they were not they were not playing fun you know they were they were on the speed but yet the pillow fire caught them in a place where they were going nowhere they were running but they were going nowhere the children of Israel were walking but they were moving faster than the terror of Egypt praise the Lord I'm trying to build a story tonight for us to realize how it is so easy for us to honor estimate the grace of God that have kept us all of these years how it's so easy for us to underestimate the grace of God that is that is dealing with us and sometimes we think we need to do this you know to make ourselves to feel like we are fit in and you know we're ready for the Rapture and then you know we are doing this and then uh they went walking through the red seat the Egyptians only achara came right in the middle of the sea the Lord allowed them to get right in the middle where the the distance of going back was fire the distance of going forward and then the sea closed them up praise the Lord and the water swallowed him and then pretty soon we see the other in Exodus chapter 16. even in Exodus chapter 15 at the end at the end of uh of the verse chapter 15. the people were sown get across and they get tested and they want him to drink water is starting to call unto God to ask him for water to drink praise the Lord let me read this also that's Exodus chapter 15 verse 22 and Moses brought Israel from the rare seed and and he went out into the wood into the Wilderness of short and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they came tomorrow they could not drink the water Samara fall they were better therefore the name of it is called married and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink and Moses Cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a treat which when he have cast into the water the water were made sweet there he may for them a stature and an audience and there he proved him now listen to this now Moses did there the Lord showed Moses a trade he threw the treaty into the water the water became a water good for drinking but the Bible says there he made them a stature and an audience and there he proved him and said if thou will diligently yanking onto my voice onto the voice he came to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ears to his commandment and keep all his stature I will put none of these diseases upon thee which are broad which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord they are healeth thee praise the Lord now if you read thou also it's almost like God is saying if you keep my Commandments then I will heal you but that's not what he's saying that is not what he's saying if you keep all of my statue then the diseases that are brought upon the Egyptians I will not bring it upon you that's not what he's saying now the scripture make us to know for the verified that that God instructed Moses to take a treat and put it in that water the Bible said he make a stature he did something to grab their attention but he never saw it they were so consumed in their needs and their loss he did something he make a stature and an audience to grab their attention but they never saw it praise the Lord oh may the Lord help us tonight amen Hallelujah are we together praise the Lord what a wonderful Jesus we serve he's a faithful God amen oh he's a faithful God you love him praise the Lord praise the Lord now you will see here better uh I'm trying to find my voting tonight there's Psalm 106. I said 107 I see why uh I can't get where I want to get there's something I want to read to you tonight one or six [Music] Psalm 106 let's read from verse 7. I'll just just listening to that last night David said our father understood that wanders in Egypt they remember net the multitudes of their Mercy but provoke him at the rare sea provoking by the Sea even at the Red Sea nevertheless he saved him for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power known amen make his mighty power to be known now it shows that these people got down in Egypt you have to realize that brother Branham says it was it was it was because of jealousy you know and hatred towards uh Jacob they got down there and uh uh and ran and naturally they realize they realized that everything that that Joseph said sorry not Jacob Joseph everything that Joseph said was truth praise the Lord amen amen the Bible says that in Genesis when Jacob one time told the dream to his father Joseph to the dream to his father Jacob Jacob said you mean mean and your mother and all your brothers will bow down to you you know I thought about this one time and realized that uh um Rachel never made it over to Egypt but yet it did not disqualify the Fulfillment of Joseph's dream you know when people get technical on Prophecy you have to realize that you are not a Josh of Prophecy you are not the judge of Prophecy the one that gave the prophecy and the purpose that he gave it for praise the Lord we all will talk about Joseph Dream and we never think on the fact that Rachel never make it to Egypt it did not make Joseph a false prophet okay let's go ahead let's let's leave that but they got down there and then pretty soon as as they settled down uh uh uh and and and and and not realizing that they were all playing in the in the enhance of Prophecy we we see here that uh pretty soon the people started settling down and then when it got under the hands of the uh of the Pharaoh that never knew Joseph they started getting angry against God praise the Lord when he came into Egypt and Joseph identified himself and said don't harm yourself God sent me in ahead of you to preserve life they brought the the family down and they all settled down they got the best part of the land they were all rejoicing in the god of Abraham they could all reflect back to what Joseph told them or or Jacob told them that Isaac told him that Abraham told Isaac about the land that we were so John that we all reflect into that could this be the prophecy could this be what what Abraham said praise the Lord but pray this song when there rose up a pharaoh that never knew Joseph and the people God honored the burden and and now they were whipped to make breaks and build a city and different things started happening instead of the people started conditioning their mind and thinking in their mind could this be happening for us to go back to the promised land which of course that's exactly what God was doing God was taking their comfort wrong on them so they can start preparing their heart to goes over to the promised land praise the Lord and the Very preparation the very condition that God had caused to prepare the people started making the people to get angry against God praise the Lord where is God what is the god of our fathers Abraham how could we be in this situation how could this be happening to me [Music] when that is just the very condition that God wants you to be in to get you out of Egypt the praise the Lord are we together that's just the very condition that he wanted them to be when Jacob died he told him to take his bones and bear it with his father when Joseph will also die he told him don't leave my bones here because I know God will visit you praise the Lord Hallelujah now when all of these things are happening around them why couldn't they think could this be praise the Lord oh my brother Brandon said God is never without a witness teaching them Moses brother Branham said there was a man called amram Praise the Lord he said I'm wrong will come from a high day of work with his back bleeding and peace he says he would climb up into the Arctic and he would lift his hands up and say Jehovah God you promised to get us out of here if we would get out of here you have to send a deliverer this place is not our home while the others were looking for comfort in Egypt amram was crying to get out of Egypt praise the Lord Brother bam says Jacob Bell would come and says Hamra you are so tired you you worked so hard he would say honey somebody have to pray we have a promise there's a promise in the world for us to get out of here praise the Lord and God always reward them that seek Him diligently he's a rewarder of them that seek Him diligently and God rewarded amra because you pray for the deliverer through you the deliverer will come yes sir Hallelujah while the others were seeking comfort in Egypt was crying for a deliverer to get out are we together praise the Lord so you see pretty soon the people forget about it and that has just been man's condition that is just our situation pretty soon we forget about how God has been so gracious and so merciful to us and many times we don't even understand praise the Lord let me tell you you are born with a selfish nature if God don't use Grace to force your life from you you will force yourself to hell right you will be so selfish for yourself right if Grace Grace have to rise up with you the same way he rise up with Jacob and Grace have to rise up with you to get your attention Grace have to rise up with you if not with your own selfish nature you will deny God from saving you and run yourself to hell oh let's understand the grace of God a little bit tonight because that's what I want to travel to let's understand this thing we call Grace gods of merits of favor let's understand what the grace of God is you hear the statement of the people all that the Lord says we will do same thing we are saying today you think that you now you have a revelation of the message I'm taking this thing you can stain you are able to stand with Father grace of God praise the Lord let the Lord just allow the little thing to happen then we write into a ticket then we think now we have a revelation of the word of God or the word of God that we cannot even wait to see Lord what are you doing right right what is this all about praise the Lord amen when it used to be that uh when the people of God will have a problem the way they solve their problem was to come together and call on the name of the Lord they get down on their knees in fasting and praying but let there come probably the way we solve our problem is we leave church we leave church let's just come and issue the way that we solve our problem is to leave church because we're taking a stand you don't understand the grace of God whenever you do that is self-righteousness and you are understanding on what you think is right because walls are fought for principle praise the Lord you cannot stay outside and solve the problem that is in the house you have to stay right there when there's a problem stay right there that's what family do they stay right there in the summit how can you stay outside and clean the floor all that the law says we will do was a defy statement it means that they never understood what God was saying Moses go and tell the Lord oh all that Allah said whatever he required of us you see these people came from honor bondage they came from honor the whip of the Egyptians if the Egyptian wanted them to work from six to six they whipped their back and they would do it all right praise the Lord so when that when a person when a person is on up on a burden on a bondage praise the Lord you you don't do the work because you love it you do it because you are bound to do it amen you want to reduce the the whip on your back so you ask yourself to say you are working you are working you you are not happy you're not enjoying it and they took their attitude before God how could they see the opening of the rare seed they saw the Terrors of the Egyptian behind them how could people like that starts to murmur starts to complain the god that split the rest he came he gave you water to drink it's so easy for the human mind to disappreciate the grace of God we have reduced Our God to tangible substance praise the Lord that's the reason why this age is so far from God is so far from God is because we have reduced God tangible substance and then when we're ready we are in a message we are the bride it's not even said with Grace it said with pride and a boastful spirit it's not even said with grace that God in his grace it has picked me up we don't even see it like that we don't see you like that all that the Lord has spoken we will do brother Brandon said in God Be Misunderstood he said you know misunderstanding get us in a lot of trouble misunderstanding get us in a lot of trouble many times there are people say things that they repeat after somebody else where the misunderstooding right you see that's what he was saying I I was there I hear it that's what he was saying and they are completely hmm Flyway praise the Lord I just had to deal with a situation yesterday talking to a brother and uh when that's when he said wow that was completely different from what I heard that's just I told him I said well anyway I was there praise the Lord I was there well let's go here [Music] misunderstanding get us into a lot of trouble many times people say things that they repeat after somebody else were they they misunderstand him that gets a person in trouble I believe it will be good for us if we will just well wait wait praise the Lord that's the reason why you would not you will not be a good judge if you want to run judgment by just hearing one party right there you go praise the Lord oh Hallelujah all that the Lord said we will do me that is a challenging statement that is a challenging statement you will not you will not you will not realize what I'm struggling to preach this you won't realize it because to me it's not just a message praise the Lord when the Lord started dealing with my heart on this subject and I started seeing what brother Branham has made all true when he talked about how Grace provided them a prophet Grace provided them a savior Grace provided them a brazing serpent praise the Lord and yet the people wanted law they wanted something to do they wanted something to do and just like how those people were enslaved that's how the sin nature enslaved us right from birth that's how the same nature enslaved us so you don't have to go in a word and and be on drugs you don't have to go in a word and and say what you want to experience sin you are already born on a slave nature and nature that enslaved you when you came right from the womb and because of that nature we always have anything yeah we want to do something it's always in US praise the Lord it's always in US that we don't even appreciate the grace to realize when brother Brown says wanting a million that there were million cells blood cells that came from your father and blood cells that came from our mother and it is by grace that elected the one that met the blood cells to make you if there were two other that was going to meet you will not be here all of those blood cells they are your brothers and sisters all of those air shelves they are your brothers and said but God he did the choosing the one that would meet the excess to make you was God that did the choosing you never had no work in it yourself what we are I'm telling it if God take his grace back in every one of us here tonight let me tell you there is more evil in US than good the only goat you have in US tonight is the grace of God that's the only good that is in you tonight tell me about all that you want to tell me about I will tell you to not write in your blood cells there is more evil if God will just extract that Grace may God be merciful if God would just extract that Grace Elijah told uh that Captain I Hazel he says I see the evil that you would do to the daughters of Israel how you will ravage them and dash their babies on the wall he said am I a dog am I a dog that I will be that Wicked he was the man he was the man that led War to Israel because a prophet has said a dog will lick the blood of Ahab so it was not going to be a gentle War it has to be a bloody one he was the captain in God take his grace your life we better learn to start appreciating the grace of God more than anything appreciate the grace of God more than the breath that you breathe because if it's not the grace of God your breath will not even smell better to yourself oh that the Lord says we will do praise the Lord even for us to be here tonight is the grace of God oh yeah to stay home you go I found some kind of a reason to stay home I'm tired from work praise the Lord I have to get up get up and go to work tomorrow or you know the children got to go to school you could have found some kind of her reason not to be here but we come to the to us of God God people when we come to the house of God you have to fight yourself every meaning praise the Lord amen not to take anything against a brother that is singing or a person that is doing something or whatever you have to fight yourself and try to be in the right mental state and say Lord I'm thanking you for being here that's the reason why we have to press through and go in the bill and go beyond every distraction from working and whatever you have to do come to the house of God just to show up just to show up and you are not in the service praise the Lord amen are we together thank you so easy to misunderstand we have to understand these things we have to understand it praise the Lord the message of the hour has come to be able to teach us how to deal with this present life brother Branham says there is two-thirds of our being that is under the prince of the power of the air praise the Lord this flesh of ours will never be converted amen the spirit man is birthed between Eve and the second so in in this body in this body is is more even science proven I can I can bring you a diagram on Sunday and and show you how things drift to the left more than to the right praise the Lord amen you clean up the garage or clean up the house pack everything unless you travel as long as you stay in that place is going to scatter it's going to scatter unless you just leave it like that like the house in golf as long as you stay there what's up with this thing um where did I leave it maybe honor this before you realize it think that you're feeling parking you're not feeling disorganizing everything after three months he said after I clean this house it's more easy to drift to the left are we together so you see there are uh that's the reason why we we have to stay Stayed under the grace of God keep appreciating the grace of God keep thanking God for his grace praise the Lord that's why James said we cannot just break and say tomorrow I will be there he said Say by the grace of God praise the Lord Paul says he says Lord ceasing seizing my seizing my words by your grace what I'm doing tonight I want to bring us to the place for those two appreciate what Grace have done for us praise the Lord if there is any good in our life is what Grace had given to you and then when when you when we start to take some of the some of the simple irrelevant things to to to disappreciate praise the Lord better man said Grace give them a prophet the man I will come right there and and and right before the eyes they see Moses speaking the word of God praise the Lord have some things I want to go into on Sunday by the grace of God if the Lord will just would just help me keep praying for me and the program talks you know right there in in uh in Exeter more the most thing that we think about is uh uh uh James and Jamber throwing down the Aztec but there were other things that Moses did that they were able to do oh yeah praise the Lord it's also amazing that God gave Egypt templates and he gave the Hebrews 10 Commandments what was that for what was that for I was talking to to the kids in bed last night we were reading and that says assist you you know you you think about that they had 10 10 10 plagues in the Hebrew had Ten Commandments what was it for I know I get your wheels all spinning numbers just stay here with me stay with me I will soon let you go home for the night praise the Lord ah all that the Lord said will do but Brandon said that was the greatest mistake that is remain chapter 16 uh the cry for food it was better for us to be in Egypt we had enough food to eat it was better for you to be in Egypt you know what you're talking about praise the Lord we always like to hold glory in our past our past has become our hero praise the Lord and God came down again and God give him manner give them food and he repeated the same word to them if I will keep my Commandments oh this is what I want to do man the thoughts of God are deep brother one they are very very deep When God says one thing to you his thoughts are deep that's the reason why you don't take a Bible verse and just run with it because those are the internal thoughts of God your idea about it is just a grain of sin it just like you struggle on the ground and you pick up the grain of sand and you're running with it nobody can see it that's the reason why we need to come back that's the reason why we need to come back let me read some few things to you then we find a place to close here I think I've I struggle but I think I got you to a good place tonight I can leave you here but Brandon says they started out really with Grace the message paradox with grace to begin with before the high Lord the high Grace while they were in Egypt with our Lord no one down there was just the priest and so for bad they didn't have any law their law had not yet been given Grace provided them a prophet also Grace provided and atuming the sacrificial lamb we are getting into this week on the sacrifice the blood because there lays your healing it's in the grace of God that will lay your healing the atonement has been provided before there was any law Grace was before law during law and after Lord it will be the grace of God that's right it was before the Lord even when the Lord was giving Grace was there if God just caught them by the Lord you have wet them out oh may we just learn to appreciate the Lord Jehovah Jeremy says now the Covenant was giving unconditionally now Israel they see natural exchange that and lost it in Exodus 19. God gave their father Abraham an unconditional Covenant but they exchange it Lord praise the Lord oh if you understand the grace of God the grace of God is not selfish for God so loved the word that he gave his only begotten son it's now for God so Lord the elect oh God so Lord the bride for God so loved the word if you understand the grace of God he gave you so much grace for others Exodus chapter 17. after they finish eating manner from heaven driving today I said oh God have mercy on us man has not changed after the finish eating man and Moses told them don't keep nothing they still defy him they want to keep it in the morning it turned to Maggie when were we listing people when will we listening when were we listening you talk to somebody and says God will reveal it to me I will pray for God to reveal it to me foreign we have all become Divine prophets for God to to revate I'm I'm not I'm not putting any kind of a stand that God can relate to you praise the Lord but there are many ways that God speak to his children we'll get into that as we go here because we're not finished with the just now would travel in there a little bit we would travel in there and then we realized that many of the things that we do many of the things that we do with good intention we are not appreciating the grace of God our intentions are good but we are out of the grace of God praise the Lord I just I just want to take it easy you I read this one and yet and then and then I kind of a close he had a close and leave you here stay here and enjoy what you're a better branches look God after he had made the confidence with Abraham Grace already provided a prophet deliverer for them praise the Lord amen we see all of those things we think about a prophet Grace has given us a prophet that we can find ourselves honor a prophet a prophet messenger brother made himself a prophet and say come and believe me as a prophet praise the Lord many times he caught himself in the prayer line honor a Divine gift he still struggle sorry I mean your brother honor a Divine girl he still struggle to shout away from that he was a prophet because the word of God Vindicated him as a prophet Malachi 4 said before I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day God says if I don't send Elijah I will smash the Earth with a curse God reaching Mercy brother Branham says that was God's atonement to this generation let me tell you Church brother Branham is now part of your faithful Ministry prophet he's not a fight for Ministry Prophet no don't put him in among the efficients prophet right we get time to get into all of that he says already provide a prophet and deliver think about it lead the prophet Grace give you parents Grace gave you Paris to take care of you to deny themselves wanting the best for you and sometimes you see a dividing a defined age where people don't even regard their parents this age the Bible says it's an age that is very unthinkable yeah praise the Lord this group we have here that we call the church Grace provided this group yes yes right we never went campaigning around the contract or around the state and say come to Minnesota and here we come we don't appreciate having a church where we can come to we don't appreciate it we get our qualification and classification in our mind we want this that and the other no one effort to believe God get out on your knees and cry to God praise the Lord Grace gave you a pastor praise the Lord give me the choice I don't want it I'm I'm being I'm Being Earnest with you give me the choice I don't want it [Music] Grace gave you a wife well we'll think that we are the man of the house we can find all the courts to protect ourselves and now make us rule us you don't know the grace of God you don't know the grace of God you don't know the grace of God Grace gave you the children you have when you stand there with a defined Spirit you don't know why your path uh why your mind hmm because we because we want whatever we want to to you now you you have found a child you put the legs you put the head everything together that child must be the way you want it to be you don't know the grace all that the Lord has spoken can you do all that the Lord has spoken God said some of the people to the mountain bring them up he had not even started speaking mostly like I thought you say all that the Lord has spoken you would do you're supposed to stand up get out yourself like he told job staying and listening how will you do everything that he said if you will not stand there to listen now you want him to speak to Moses for Moses to come and speak to you right when sometimes you show people thing right in the word you say the scripture has said the prophet has said you say I'll pray so God can relate it to me how we spring the mercy of God we trample over the grace of God because we have God so smart praise the Lord you know why God gave the Ten Commandments to those people let me get ahead of myself we will get there The Ten Commandments was to show the human flawed everything that God asks for in the Ten Commandment was was the fault of the people it was an expulsion of their sin that I shall not convert because he know is Indian it's in him so God was just exposing them God was telling them this is what is in you I'll pick you up my ego with I snatch you out of Egypt I took you for the curse of your first birth I snatch you as an eagle I gather you to myself and are you asking me for something to do may God help us you see I pick you up as an eagle brought you to myself God Express him his desire to the people I want to make you a family of priests a holy nation praise the Lord now if this thing was a Commandment that God was requiring them to do Peter would not say the same thing that we are a holy generation it's the same thing as the expression of God's mind God was just expressing his talk this is my thought concerning you have snatched you to draw you to myself to make you a different people from all the nations of the Earth but because of that enslaving nature they are banished that they were in they have got used to working they have to earn it oh that the Lord have spoken everything that pharah asks us we did I have a have a uh a drama version of the Bible when I'm playing that is it's beautiful oh I got the Lord has spoken we would do you can just see the arrogance that is India expression sure for the fact that they were murmuring after seeing the hands of God Exodus chapter 17 they started crying for water God told Moses I will go and stand on the rock smash the rock what shall we come out just from one thing to another God showing his provision to the people the way he's keeping us put your feet down say I'm better than that the way he's keeping us they sometimes just called a young man or called a young woman set them down and try to advise them they will misunderstand you completely you are talking to them their mind goes why they get angry they take an attitude they take a defensive attitude in a sense who are you to tell me what to do the grace of God people we don't know the grace of God especially people that have come around this message we have Associated ourselves with a supernatural the gift that God has given to this age taking on the title as the bride we make ourselves Superior when we supposed to be servants to the Earth travels to the Earth we know brother Branham has brother Branham Jeffersonville they knew him as Billy that's how they knew him as Billy he was a man that was always helping the people some of those people never knew brother Brannon as as uh in his Healing Ministry when there was a flawed he had his boat on the on on the on the water trying to rescue people when his wife was dying we don't have Seven's heart the grace of God will give you a seven hearts that's why the grace of God would do if we give you a servant's heart become so proud look down on
