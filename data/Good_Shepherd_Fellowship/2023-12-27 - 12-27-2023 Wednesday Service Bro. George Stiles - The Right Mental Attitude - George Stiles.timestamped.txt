[37:29] [Music]
[37:32] yes one thing I would want to encourage
[37:34] ourselves before we just take this
[37:36] prayer needs before and then he comes
[37:41] over never be
[37:45] complacent when it comes to your walk
[37:48] with
[37:50] God I don't care how much of God you
[37:54] have I don't care how many many
[37:57] years you've been walking with
[38:01] God I don't care how many times you pray
[38:04] in a day and how many times you fast in
[38:06] a
[38:07] day and how much of God you think you
[38:10] have when it comes to your work with God
[38:14] never think you have it all
[38:17] am always be willing to
[38:20] accept more of
[38:23] him as I've said before with food if you
[38:27] give me a bowl of food the more of it I
[38:30] have the less I
[38:32] need but it is the other way around with
[38:35] God the more of God you have the more of
[38:37] him you need and when you come to a
[38:40] place to think that oh I have too much
[38:42] of him oh I have a lot of him oh so I
[38:45] care less oh is this brother or is this
[38:48] sister who need him just watch that
[38:54] spirit I hope you are here here tonight
[38:57] with your hearts open to receive of him
[39:01] tonight don't ever stop at the vessel
[39:04] God is
[39:05] using look past that vessel and you will
[39:08] see God when a man has waited on God and
[39:14] has sought the face of God and God has
[39:17] placed a burden on his heart for the
[39:19] church and he
[39:21] comes when he takes the word of God and
[39:24] puts it on his mouth it is de that is
[39:27] [Music]
[39:29] speaking and I will plead with you to
[39:32] [Music]
[39:33] listen I don't have much of it in my
[39:37] archives a lot of the times I would say
[39:40] you either take it or leave
[39:42] it but tonight I will say I'll plead
[39:45] with you to
[39:47] listen praise be to
[39:50] God the prophet of God says something
[39:53] somewhere that the right mental AR itude
[39:57] to every promise would bring it to
[40:02] pass when you
[40:05] walking come with a spirit of humility
[40:08] to receive of
[40:10] [Music]
[40:11] God
[40:13] come because pride has no
[40:18] place pride has no place before God
[40:21] because the Bible says Pride goes before
[40:23] a fall come with the spirit of humility
[40:27] come willing to be corrected come
[40:30] willing to be instructed even when you
[40:32] are rebuked that is what you
[40:36] need praise be to
[40:40] God so when you come just get ready to
[40:44] hear from God and you will always hear
[40:46] from God it doesn't matter how short it
[40:50] doesn't matter how long the service is
[40:52] you would always hear from
[40:55] God as I was coming tonight it just hit
[40:59] me right now we were driving and
[41:01] listening to ktsm uh is that it yes I
[41:04] think it is ktsm yes and then they said
[41:10] something the presenter said we are
[41:14] gaining 1 minute and 7 Seconds of
[41:20] daylight every
[41:23] day 1 minute and 7 Seconds of daylight
[41:28] every day what does that mean to
[41:32] US 1 minute it doesn't mean
[41:38] anything but every day we are gaining 1
[41:41] minute 7 Seconds of
[41:43] daylight and one day before you realize
[41:45] it is
[41:47] daylight praise be to God and as you are
[41:50] coming before God and going every day
[41:53] every
[41:54] evening something is happening to your
[41:57] life you don't see it it may not mean
[42:00] anything to you but something is getting
[42:03] bound something is getting Loos you are
[42:06] not taking notice of it but something is
[42:09] happening sometimes we want it to be
[42:11] from Z to 100 oh yes it happened or 50
[42:14] to 100 yes we saw God but God can do it
[42:18] it doesn't always happen that way it is
[42:21] just by small
[42:23] increment in ways you never understand
[42:26] in which maybe you don't appreciate but
[42:29] God is doing something and tonight God
[42:31] is going to do something praise be to
[42:34] God I don't know what our brother has
[42:37] but I know God has laid a beding on his
[42:39] heart and just encourage our him pray I
[42:43] mean I hope you have prayed up praise be
[42:45] to God so I'm just going to just um ask
[42:49] that we we we we just pray we we commit
[42:53] this prayer these burs before the Lord
[42:55] pray pray for sister Joy uh who is not
[42:58] feeling fine from brother
[43:01] Ben um pray for Simon and
[43:06] Rebecca too praise the Lord yes I didn't
[43:10] even notice they were not here um pray
[43:14] for sis Bri niece who is admitted to the
[43:18] hospital um and I also want us to
[43:21] remember my Mary in
[43:23] prayer and also remember brother uh
[43:26] brother brother one I spoke to him
[43:29] yesterday um the services went very well
[43:33] and he wanted to change his uh flight
[43:36] just coming earlier than
[43:38] planned um he was still working on it I
[43:41] don't know how far he's gone but we want
[43:43] it to be according to God's perfect will
[43:46] and I would want us to all get up and
[43:49] commit all these prayer
[43:52] needs all these prayer needs into the
[43:54] hands of the almighty God and I want us
[43:56] all to pray praise be to God a lot of
[44:00] the times brother one will come behind
[44:03] the pulpit and he will ask we should
[44:06] pray I'll be out there I'll be praying
[44:10] he'll be praying and you just hear a few
[44:16] voices let's all let's let's get into
[44:19] that
[44:20] habit that we all put our licks of fire
[44:25] together
[44:26] you don't know what your little prayer
[44:29] can
[44:30] do let's get into that habit that when
[44:33] somebody comes let's let us pray pray
[44:36] together just don't worry who is
[44:39] standing next to you who is
[44:41] listening who is praying just pray to
[44:45] God I believe in praying in your heart
[44:48] that you can just sit behind your Pulpit
[44:51] I mean you can just sit in your Pew in
[44:54] your chair and pray in your heart with
[44:55] your eyes open I believe that
[44:59] happens I don't expect to call a brother
[45:02] to come and pray and a brother will come
[45:04] and stand here and would not say
[45:06] anything after 1 minute after 5 minutes
[45:09] he says amen and go and sit down and
[45:12] then when I ask he tells me I prayed in
[45:14] my heart
[45:16] no I believe in that but there are times
[45:20] when we should just cry out to God
[45:21] praise the Lord so I want us to commit
[45:24] all these prayer needs into the hand of

[49:26] Lord if the musicians can put this song
[49:29] up while we sing it we invite our
[49:32] brother
[49:33] over praise the
[49:40] [Music]
[49:47] Lord
[49:50] amen in
[49:53] Grace I see
[49:56] [Music]
[50:12] I
[50:14] was was
[50:17] lost but
[50:20] now
[50:23] I was blind
[50:27] but
[50:29] now I
[50:33] see
[50:35] Amen to be quite honest with you I'm a
[50:39] whole lot more nervous now than I've
[50:40] been in a long time standing behind the
[50:42] pull pit
[50:44] but I just thank God that brother Ali's
[50:47] word he comforted me a little bit in
[50:49] what he said so just remember you know
[50:51] got I got to know my position and I go
[50:53] so far and that's it you know so if God
[50:56] uses me to speak through me to you
[50:58] that's God speaking to you that's not me
[51:00] you know God can use a donkey surely he
[51:03] can use a use a human
[51:05] so so U I guess we can go ahead and turn
[51:09] over to Genesis chapter
[51:13] 2 then we'll may maybe say a few
[51:19] words verse
[51:21] one I was going to uh speak on the tree
[51:25] of good and evil or the tree of
[51:28] life and it's not really going to be
[51:30] about that but just consider which which
[51:33] way are you leaning toward or which tree
[51:35] are you're eating off of whenever you're
[51:36] manifesting who you
[51:39] are says um in Genesis CH 2 verse one
[51:44] thus the heavens and the Earth were
[51:46] finished all the host of them and on the
[51:48] seventh day God ended his work which he
[51:51] had made and he rested on the seventh
[51:54] day from all his work
[51:56] and sometimes we still hadn't rested and
[51:58] God's already
[51:59] rested we're still trying to do it on
[52:02] our own and God said come unto me and I
[52:04] will give you rest you know if if you
[52:07] know you know one of The Commandments is
[52:09] is to remember the Sabbath day and keep
[52:11] it holy and if we know the message very
[52:13] well we already know what the prophet
[52:14] said what that Sabbath day
[52:17] was from all his work which he had made
[52:19] and God blessed the seventh day and
[52:21] Sanctified it because in it he had
[52:23] rested from all his work which God
[52:25] created and made these are the
[52:28] generations of the heavens of the earth
[52:30] and when they were created in that day
[52:33] that the Lord God made the earth and the
[52:35] heavens and every plant of the field
[52:37] before it was in the earth and every
[52:39] herb of the field before it grew for the
[52:42] Lord God had not caused it to rain upon
[52:45] the Earth and there was not a man to
[52:46] till the
[52:48] ground but there went up a mist from the
[52:51] earth and watered the whole face of the
[52:53] ground and the Lord God formed man of
[52:56] the Dust of the ground and breathed into
[52:58] his nostrils the breath of life and the
[53:01] Man became a living
[53:03] soul and the Lord God planted a garden
[53:06] Eastward and entered in Eden and there
[53:09] he put the man whom he had formed and
[53:12] out of the ground made the Lord God to
[53:14] grow every tree that is Pleasant to the
[53:17] sight and good for food and then there's
[53:20] a semicolon
[53:21] there and then the tree of life also in
[53:25] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[53:27] knowledge of Good and Evil the semicolon
[53:30] is there is just to show you that there
[53:31] is a difference between those two trees
[53:33] and the other trees that was in the
[53:36] garden and the river went out of Eden to
[53:39] water the
[53:40] garden and from then it was parted and
[53:43] came into foreheads let's bow our heads
[53:47] dear Lord Jesus would come before you
[53:48] and you read a portion of your word oh
[53:50] Father and we just ask oh Lord that you
[53:52] would just open the book to us that we
[53:54] could see in your word how you would
[53:56] live how you would live through US Lord
[53:58] that you can show yourself and to others
[54:00] oh Father we thank you for all things
[54:03] Lord we just ask you just bless the
[54:05] service but we ask it in the name of the
[54:06] Lord Jesus Christ
[54:11] amen I'm not going to
[54:14] um hopefully I don't hold you too long I
[54:17] don't
[54:18] know well I'll go ahead and uh read this
[54:21] out of the Exodus this is from the from
[54:23] the message called The Exodus in 1956
[54:26] and keep this in mind whenever we're
[54:28] considering a tree of the good and evil
[54:30] and the tree of tree of uh life which
[54:34] one are you manifesting which one are
[54:35] you showing forth to other
[54:38] people and Moses now was 80 years old
[54:41] instead of being a deliverer it looked
[54:43] like all hopes was gone you know
[54:45] sometimes you're not on a mountain
[54:46] sometimes you're going through the
[54:48] valley and he was a sheep herder for his
[54:53] father-in-law amen
[54:57] excuse me I got a little back feed
[55:01] there and he was a sheep herder for his
[55:03] father-in-law and way back on the back
[55:06] side of the desert one morning walking
[55:08] alone when the sun was coming up and he
[55:10] looked over and he seen a bush burning
[55:13] God always gives something to attract
[55:15] the attention of the believer ain't you
[55:18] glad God got your attention it don't
[55:19] matter how he got it he might not have
[55:21] got it by a burning bush but he got it
[55:23] somehow you know I remember God got my
[55:25] attention one day and I didn't know how
[55:28] to take it I was just looking over over
[55:30] the over out the window and I was
[55:32] meditating in the heart because the Lord
[55:34] was speaking to my heart and then he
[55:36] sent my dad by to speak to me about
[55:38] exactly whatever I was thinking about in
[55:40] my heart looking out the
[55:42] window so he has a different way for
[55:44] each and every
[55:46] one so he sets aside not to criticize
[55:49] not to analyze not to pull some of the
[55:51] leaves off and take it down to the
[55:53] laboratory to see why them Le leaves
[55:55] didn't burn he stepped to the side of
[55:58] this Burning Fire he reverently he
[56:01] approached it God said take off your
[56:03] shoes Moses for the ground you stand on
[56:06] is Holy
[56:07] Ground listen to this why don't we
[56:10] receive when we come to the Lord
[56:11] sometimes are we coming like Moses did
[56:13] to that bush or we coming in our own way
[56:15] are we coming sincerely or we coming
[56:17] trying to protect
[56:20] ourselves that's what it is today the
[56:22] reason that gifts in the church the
[56:24] reason Reon people don't get very much
[56:26] today it's because it's irreverence you
[56:30] you approach it in other words you you
[56:32] approach it irreverently you don't
[56:34] approach it sincerely you got to come to
[56:37] it with a full surrendered madeup mind
[56:40] amen when you come to God don't just to
[56:42] haphazardly come up beat on the altar
[56:45] chew chewing gum that's not the way to
[56:47] come to God come just as sane as you can
[56:51] come and mean what you're talking about
[56:53] God will receive you
[56:55] you know if if if somebody's speaking to
[56:58] or something speaking to your heart you
[57:00] don't have to try to justify yourself
[57:02] you don't have to say well that might be
[57:04] true but this this and that no it ain't
[57:06] none of that that's re leaning to the
[57:08] tree of Good and Evil see it's good
[57:10] because I realize that this good this
[57:12] good and this good but then it's evil
[57:14] because you got a different motive
[57:15] within your heart trying to justify what
[57:17] you did in the past we ain't got to do
[57:18] none of that just come sincerely the
[57:21] Tree of Life come as sincerely As You
[57:23] Are speak what you are from your heart
[57:26] to the Lord the Lord already knows you
[57:28] ain't going to keep no secret from him
[57:30] you might keep a secret from me or the
[57:31] next guy but you ain't going to keep no
[57:32] secret from the Lord he already knows
[57:34] just be open and sincere with
[57:37] him listen to this next part in Genesis
[57:40] chapter 2 and the Lord God took the man
[57:43] and put him in the Garden of Eden to
[57:45] dress it and to keep it and the Lord God
[57:48] commanded the man saying of every tree
[57:50] of the garden thou mayest freely eat but
[57:53] of the tree of knowledge of good good
[57:54] and evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[57:57] the day that thou eatest thereof Thou
[57:59] shalt surely die and here we whenever we
[58:02] come across that and we can come up to
[58:05] something sincerely manifesting what is
[58:07] truly in our life or we can hide it by
[58:09] our reasoning and our our knowledge of
[58:11] Good and Evil and we can put a spin on
[58:14] it and make it sound a whole lot better
[58:15] than what it is are we going to lean to
[58:18] that way when we lean it that way it's
[58:20] death cuz you can pull a pull a wool
[58:23] over a lot of people a lot of time but
[58:25] you can't do it all time and eventually
[58:27] you're going to be found out that you're
[58:28] trying to trick
[58:29] somebody you're trying to deceive
[58:31] somebody you know
[58:34] recently well well anyway I bought a
[58:37] vehicle and in this
[58:39] vehicle this vehicle I went before the
[58:42] financial people and the financial
[58:43] people presented this thing and it was
[58:45] you know how he presented like it was
[58:47] all good and everything was good about
[58:48] it and this is basically a maintenance
[58:51] plan and I looked at and I looked at the
[58:53] maintenance plan and I said said well if
[58:55] the only thing that does is oil changes
[58:56] in in the wiper blades that's not good
[58:59] that's too expensive he said well it
[59:00] also covers your transmission flushes
[59:02] and all that stuff and I said okay I'll
[59:05] agree to that you know it might be a
[59:06] better deal if it includes all that then
[59:08] when I got home and looked at the at
[59:10] what they recommend in the Ford manual
[59:12] what it said the transmission stuff is
[59:15] not even recommended until after that
[59:18] that deal expired so he was misleading
[59:20] me make it sound better than what it
[59:23] actually was you know are we doing it
[59:25] might give us good might benefit him he
[59:28] might get a little bonus or something
[59:29] because he did that but whenever I find
[59:32] out he don't take long to find out the
[59:34] cards are on the table then hey he was
[59:36] bluffing me it makes me feel kind of bad
[59:39] or disheartened that he would do that to
[59:41] somebody so he don't look like a very
[59:44] good Christian person doing that kind of
[59:46] stuff
[59:47] but but are we doing the same thing with
[59:50] our with our lives we shouldn't
[59:53] be and it ain't just just for uh people
[59:57] low in the church either it's for
[59:59] everybody you look in the church age
[1:00:01] book where brother brandham was reading
[1:00:03] this this article and he said why just a
[1:00:06] few weeks ago I read an editorial yes it
[1:00:09] was an editorial by an unsaved
[1:00:11] businessman not a
[1:00:12] Christian so everybody can see it you
[1:00:14] ain't got to be Spirit-filled to
[1:00:16] recognize when somebody's doing
[1:00:17] something wrong anybody can see what's
[1:00:19] wrong it don't take a genius to figure
[1:00:22] it out sometimes you know it's just
[1:00:23] obvious you know we might think we're
[1:00:25] being slick and Sly eating from the Tree
[1:00:28] of Good and Evil trying to hide our
[1:00:29] mistakes and trying to wash it over and
[1:00:31] keep it up the wool over people's eyes
[1:00:33] but this was an unsaved businessman it
[1:00:35] could see right through
[1:00:37] it it and he said that he was amazed at
[1:00:40] the churches he could not understand
[1:00:43] them they had seminaries filled with
[1:00:45] professors who taught the word of God in
[1:00:47] order to destroy it so they know what
[1:00:50] the word is but because they didn't want
[1:00:52] to live that word they went in there and
[1:00:54] put their spin on it they went it don't
[1:00:57] really mean that it means this I thought
[1:01:00] the word meant what it
[1:01:02] meant now when this man could not figure
[1:01:04] that out he was appalled by it he said
[1:01:07] that he could understand that the
[1:01:09] atheists are communist or the free
[1:01:11] thinker or someone else doing that but
[1:01:13] when the church itself destroyed the
[1:01:15] word of God that was tmount to
[1:01:18] premeditated murder there is your hybrid
[1:01:21] religion wake up America before it's too
[1:01:23] late could the same thing be said about
[1:01:26] us in the message wake up message people
[1:01:28] before it's too late are you going to
[1:01:30] try to twist a message on purpose just
[1:01:32] because you don't agree with the message
[1:01:34] because the message says something that
[1:01:36] was against what somebody else said in
[1:01:38] your past history you're going to take
[1:01:40] what the past history said over what the
[1:01:41] word of God said we we shouldn't be
[1:01:44] doing that we should hey that's the word
[1:01:46] of God maybe if I don't line up with it
[1:01:48] then I need to come to the Lord
[1:01:49] sincerely say Lord change me I see that
[1:01:52] mirror of the word there that mirror of
[1:01:53] the word says is this and the reflection
[1:01:56] I see back from that mirror is not
[1:01:57] lining up with what that word says so
[1:01:59] I'm the one that needs to be changed it
[1:02:01] ain't the word that needs to be changed
[1:02:02] I don't need to go in there with my
[1:02:04] high-bred religion and try to twist it
[1:02:06] around and try to tell you it means
[1:02:08] something that it doesn't
[1:02:10] mean and I i' also realize the word has
[1:02:13] dual meaning sometimes you know like out
[1:02:15] of Egypt I've called my
[1:02:17] son you know he's talking about the
[1:02:19] children of Israel coming out of Egypt
[1:02:20] and I also talk about Jesus Christ
[1:02:22] coming out of Egypt I understand those
[1:02:23] two things there too so in one example
[1:02:26] if the word says one thing it could also
[1:02:28] mean something else but if I'm a
[1:02:31] minister and I only point you to what
[1:02:32] else it could mean but then I come back
[1:02:35] and act like it don't mean what it said
[1:02:36] originally then I'm trying to take it
[1:02:38] out of context it might actually mean
[1:02:41] what I'm saying it means but if I go
[1:02:43] back and try to nullify what it actually
[1:02:45] means then I'm trying to pull a wool
[1:02:46] over your
[1:02:47] lives you know kind of like uh God don't
[1:02:51] use Mechanical Devices we know what that
[1:02:53] means it means what it means you know
[1:02:55] Mechanical Devices could be a tap player
[1:02:57] or whatever it could mean that that's a
[1:02:59] I agree with that fully but if you go
[1:03:01] back and look at what the prophet was
[1:03:03] actually saying he was talking about
[1:03:05] organized men and organizations trying
[1:03:08] to use politics in order to control the
[1:03:10] other ministry that's what he was
[1:03:12] actually talking about so if I come and
[1:03:14] tell you that that God don't use
[1:03:16] mechanical devices and I only say it
[1:03:19] means tape recorders and tape players
[1:03:21] then I could be misleading you because
[1:03:23] if I'm I could look back at myself and
[1:03:26] say am I the one of the political people
[1:03:28] trying to control people with my
[1:03:30] politics to force them to believe what I
[1:03:32] say and everybody else that disagrees
[1:03:34] with me is unqualified to be even in the
[1:03:36] ministry I can't be doing that because
[1:03:38] if I do that I would be the mechanical
[1:03:40] device that the prophet was actually
[1:03:42] talking about on tape if you go back and
[1:03:44] listen to the tape and you hear him
[1:03:46] saying that God don't use Mechanical
[1:03:48] Devices nine times out of 10 you can
[1:03:50] take it straight from his words and see
[1:03:53] that he is talking about about
[1:03:54] denominational Spirits he's not talking
[1:03:56] about actual tap recorders but you can
[1:03:59] take it as a dual meaning and you can
[1:04:01] say tap
[1:04:02] recorders so there is a way you can look
[1:04:05] at the word of God but are you trying to
[1:04:08] twist it to get your agenda across are
[1:04:10] you trying to twist it to get what you
[1:04:12] think across and Dee demean or
[1:04:15] demoralize everybody else no you can't
[1:04:16] do that you got to take the word of God
[1:04:19] it is face value and if I look at the
[1:04:21] mirror and it says there's a possibility
[1:04:24] that I could be a mechanical device and
[1:04:26] I say need I need to say Lord protect me
[1:04:28] from that Lord help me not to be a
[1:04:30] mechanical device I might be a flesh
[1:04:33] human being but if I am doing things as
[1:04:36] a mechanical device only doing what
[1:04:38] headquarters tells me to do or doing
[1:04:41] what this person tells me to do then I'm
[1:04:43] being a mechanical device because I'm
[1:04:45] not telling you what the Lord said I'm
[1:04:47] telling you what some other man says
[1:04:49] even though I I have a lot of respect
[1:04:51] for that man if I'm just telling you
[1:04:52] what he said he could be accidentally
[1:04:55] make a mistake and if I'm I'm just
[1:04:57] repeating his mistake he might be
[1:04:59] sincere and if I reading a word where
[1:05:01] what he says and the word says of two
[1:05:03] different things and I'm repeating his
[1:05:05] mistake he might think it's a mistake
[1:05:07] and he'll be sincerely saying a mistake
[1:05:09] but I will be saying a lie because what
[1:05:10] I'm saying I know it's not true because
[1:05:13] what he said and what the word says is
[1:05:14] two different things but yet I keep on
[1:05:16] saying his mistake because I respect
[1:05:20] him now I'm not supposed to go and blast
[1:05:22] him because he made a mistake
[1:05:24] because Matthew 18 tells us how to how
[1:05:26] to do that doesn't it said I'm supposed
[1:05:29] to go to the brother if I you know
[1:05:30] something work things
[1:05:33] out but anyway I don't know how I got
[1:05:35] off on that I say I get in trouble
[1:05:36] sometimes I go off on tangents and I get
[1:05:38] in
[1:05:39] trouble Let's uh finish reading in uh
[1:05:42] Genesis uh chapter 2 and verse
[1:05:45] 18 you notice up there that
[1:05:49] uh I don't even know where I am now but
[1:05:51] anyway and God the Lord God said said is
[1:05:54] not good that man should be alone I will
[1:05:57] make a help meat for him you notice up
[1:06:00] above in the first part of Genesis where
[1:06:03] I read that that God told Adam that not
[1:06:06] to eat of the tree of Good and Evil but
[1:06:08] Eve wasn't there and some people like to
[1:06:11] use that and say see there Eve is not
[1:06:14] responsible for that because she wasn't
[1:06:16] there when God told him but we read down
[1:06:18] a little further we find out that that
[1:06:20] might be a good thought but it's an
[1:06:21] incorrect thought you know so listen uh
[1:06:24] and God said it is not good that man
[1:06:26] should be alone I will make and help
[1:06:29] meat for him and out of the ground the
[1:06:31] Lord God formed every beast of the field
[1:06:34] and every foul of the air and brought
[1:06:36] them unto Adam to see what he would call
[1:06:39] them and whosoever Adam called every
[1:06:42] living creature was a name thereof and
[1:06:45] this is right after God told him to not
[1:06:47] eat the tree of Good and Evil don't be
[1:06:49] insincere but eat the tree of life and
[1:06:51] be natural so if he he was naming them
[1:06:55] being a sincere believer he would name
[1:06:57] them what they was actually called
[1:06:58] wouldn't it be catastrophe he said this
[1:07:00] is a a puppy instead of a lion when it
[1:07:02] was really a lion we wouldn't know what
[1:07:04] to believe you know come up and pet a
[1:07:07] puppy and all of a sudden and scratch
[1:07:08] your head
[1:07:09] off he was sincere and what he actually
[1:07:12] named
[1:07:13] him another brother I know brother
[1:07:16] Potter he said you see here God actually
[1:07:18] gave a man a job before he gave him a
[1:07:20] wife he gave him something to
[1:07:22] do
[1:07:25] and Adam gave names to all the cattle to
[1:07:28] all the foul of the air to every beast
[1:07:29] of the field but for Adam there was not
[1:07:32] found and help meat for him and the Lord
[1:07:34] God caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[1:07:37] Adam and he slept and he took one of the
[1:07:39] ribs and closed the flesh upon it and
[1:07:42] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:07:44] from man he made a woman and brought her
[1:07:46] unto the man ain't that amazing whenever
[1:07:49] we get first get married oh this is the
[1:07:52] best thing that ever happened to me and
[1:07:53] then 5 10 years down the
[1:07:56] road why did I even ask for that you
[1:07:59] know that's whenever you know the little
[1:08:02] tensions and stuff you
[1:08:04] know as I heard before you know a
[1:08:06] marriage happens when two people agree
[1:08:08] one to agree to be one and then the
[1:08:10] fight happens when they try to decide
[1:08:12] which
[1:08:15] one and Adam said this is now bone of my
[1:08:19] bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[1:08:22] called woman because she was Tak out a
[1:08:24] man now he didn't call her woman because
[1:08:27] he was disrespecting her he was calling
[1:08:28] her a woman because she was part of him
[1:08:31] you know we ever get the Revelation that
[1:08:33] our wives is part of us maybe we
[1:08:35] wouldn't be so hard on them you
[1:08:39] know therefore shall a man leave his
[1:08:41] father and his mother and shall cleave
[1:08:43] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:08:45] flesh and they were both naked the man
[1:08:47] and his wife and they were not ashamed
[1:08:50] in other words they really didn't have
[1:08:51] any secrets between any each other you
[1:08:53] know you know they was Bare before each
[1:08:55] other they didn't they didn't try to
[1:08:56] keep any secrets they wern't trying to
[1:08:58] hide off the tree of Good and Evil and
[1:09:00] say Yes husband I was doing this but
[1:09:02] they really they was doing something
[1:09:03] totally different you know I'm sorry I
[1:09:05] didn't get to do this but blah blah blah
[1:09:07] and all of a sudden you found out later
[1:09:09] it might not be
[1:09:10] true you know I could have made supper
[1:09:12] for you but I was really talking on the
[1:09:14] phone all day they ain't going to come
[1:09:16] out and tell you
[1:09:19] that
[1:09:21] anyway and that that brings me to
[1:09:23] another point with you know with with
[1:09:26] you being being so far you know
[1:09:29] originally we had plans to go somewhere
[1:09:30] else because you know whenever we're off
[1:09:33] visiting with uh on vacation to see the
[1:09:36] in-laws I kind of let Grace decide the
[1:09:38] things to do because you know it's her
[1:09:39] family and stuff so we just go along and
[1:09:42] and let her decide and we're supposed to
[1:09:44] be somewhere else tonight and and that's
[1:09:46] a wonderful thing I'm going to speaking
[1:09:48] Cod here a little bit and uh but
[1:09:51] whenever Brother Juan called me invited
[1:09:53] me to speak the change the plans kind of
[1:09:56] changed and I'm a
[1:09:59] husband and and at a husband I I got an
[1:10:01] office to be a husband and I got to
[1:10:04] realize my authority as a husband go so
[1:10:06] far and that's it it don't go beyond
[1:10:09] where my office is called to be so when
[1:10:12] I got the invitation I told Brother Juan
[1:10:14] we can change our plans and come tonight
[1:10:16] then I contacted my wife and I
[1:10:19] said I said we can't go listen to
[1:10:22] brother someone so speak tonight because
[1:10:25] Brother Juan invited me to speak so
[1:10:27] we're going to go over to good go over
[1:10:29] to Good Shepherd now I contacted her
[1:10:31] because she is my wife and I'm her
[1:10:34] husband and as my husband I got a right
[1:10:36] to ask her to do
[1:10:38] things but because I'm a husband that
[1:10:40] don't mean I'm the husband of everybody
[1:10:42] I didn't contact anybody else's wife to
[1:10:44] ask them to do that and I didn't try to
[1:10:47] put pressure on them to quit what
[1:10:49] they're doing to come to do what I
[1:10:51] wanted them to do why because they're
[1:10:53] not not my
[1:10:54] wife you know the same thing can be said
[1:10:56] for pastors pastors is they got a they
[1:10:59] got a leadership position and they got a
[1:11:01] a leadership and they can go so far and
[1:11:04] they can give you advice and tell you
[1:11:06] what to do but they can't demand that
[1:11:08] another church somewhere else call them
[1:11:11] to get their permission in order for
[1:11:12] them to let somebody else speak because
[1:11:14] they might be a pastor they might be a
[1:11:15] good pastor they might have a big church
[1:11:18] but their pastorship is of the local
[1:11:20] flock it ain't of the pastor of the
[1:11:22] whole message so you can come so far and
[1:11:25] you can stop you ain't got to go and
[1:11:27] take your your position of authority to
[1:11:30] a level higher than what it actually is
[1:11:32] I can only go so far I can't tell
[1:11:34] another sister what I want her to do
[1:11:37] because she's not my
[1:11:38] wife I can go so far and that's it now
[1:11:42] whether she agrees with me or disagrees
[1:11:44] with me and then we got to have a
[1:11:45] discussion but until that point happens
[1:11:48] I'm the husband of one of one wife I
[1:11:50] can't be the husband of somebody else's
[1:11:52] wife the if they want advice they can go
[1:11:55] ask their husband or ask somebody they
[1:11:57] respect but I can't come with authority
[1:12:00] and tell them what to do or not to do
[1:12:02] just like one Pastor can't tell another
[1:12:04] Pastor that you have to get his
[1:12:06] permission in order to let somebody
[1:12:07] preach in his church that's up to that
[1:12:09] Pastor I know the prophet said the
[1:12:12] Pastor is the highest Authority in the
[1:12:14] local church but you notice he said
[1:12:17] local he didn't say he was the highest
[1:12:20] authority of the whole
[1:12:22] message if you want to know who that is
[1:12:24] I guess I'll let you figure that out
[1:12:26] yourself or Brother Juan can tell you
[1:12:28] later I know it sure ain't me I'm glad
[1:12:37] too now whenever you listen to somebody
[1:12:40] like me you you I'm not going to tell
[1:12:43] you that you know like whenever somebody
[1:12:46] uh speaks like brother Al s before
[1:12:49] service that whenever you hear a man
[1:12:51] speaking that could be deity coming
[1:12:53] across cross his
[1:12:54] lips okay that's true but that doesn't
[1:12:57] mean that I am deity that doesn't mean
[1:12:59] I'm God because like I said earlier God
[1:13:02] use a donkey and who is the important
[1:13:05] one you are his child and he's got a
[1:13:08] vessel to speak to his child and if he
[1:13:10] wants to get a message to his child he's
[1:13:12] going to use any vessel he can to get
[1:13:14] his message to his
[1:13:15] child but you got to always compare that
[1:13:18] message with the
[1:13:21] word because if if not even though
[1:13:26] people don't like to do this they don't
[1:13:27] like to look in that mirror and say hey
[1:13:29] block me if this happens I see that and
[1:13:31] I see it's a possibility but I want to
[1:13:33] be blocked I want to be fully
[1:13:34] surrendered to the word to say only what
[1:13:37] the word says I don't want to say that
[1:13:39] this is my opinion and but my opinion is
[1:13:42] the word my opinion ain't the word the
[1:13:43] word is the word because I could be like
[1:13:46] what it says here in in Genesis 3:1 now
[1:13:50] the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:13:52] beast of the the field which the Lord
[1:13:54] God had made and he said unto the woman
[1:13:56] see I could be a serpent I I don't want
[1:14:00] to be a serpent but if I'm not in the
[1:14:02] right calling and position if I'm not
[1:14:04] born again like brother Brown said every
[1:14:06] Minister that stands behind the pull pit
[1:14:07] should be born again then I could be
[1:14:09] manifesting that but I don't want to be
[1:14:12] manifest I just got out of my notes I
[1:14:14] don't want to be manifesting that so I
[1:14:16] got to check myself with the word and if
[1:14:19] and if you are a true servant of God is
[1:14:21] what's it what did Jesus say my sheep
[1:14:23] know my voice another they will not
[1:14:26] follow so you got to make sure that
[1:14:28] you're born again so you can recognize
[1:14:30] what voice is speaking to you because it
[1:14:33] is God speaking to you it's the the holy
[1:14:36] spirit is one that's supposed to lead
[1:14:37] and guide us into all truth you have to
[1:14:40] be able to recognize that voice behind
[1:14:41] the voice it ain't the vessel it's the
[1:14:44] voice behind the vessel that's using
[1:14:46] that
[1:14:49] vessel and and he said unto the woman
[1:14:53] yay hath God said You shall not eat of
[1:14:55] every tree of the garden and see here we
[1:14:59] we like like that one brother said
[1:15:01] before that the woman wasn't there so
[1:15:03] she wasn't responsible for it but let's
[1:15:04] see if she knew about it even though she
[1:15:06] wasn't there when God said that and the
[1:15:08] woman said to the serpent we may eat of
[1:15:11] the fruit of the Trees of the garden but
[1:15:13] of the fruit of the tree which is in the
[1:15:15] midst of the garden God ha said You
[1:15:17] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:15:19] touch it lest you die you see there she
[1:15:23] knew something was said about the tree
[1:15:25] of good and good and evil and she told
[1:15:27] him that God has said it if she wasn't
[1:15:29] there personally the message must have
[1:15:31] been relay to
[1:15:34] her it might be because Adam was
[1:15:36] following in his position as a husband
[1:15:39] and he told her what God told him he had
[1:15:42] discussions and and that's how we are
[1:15:44] you know we got as a father or a mother
[1:15:47] we got children underneath us and the
[1:15:49] word says something and we know the word
[1:15:51] says something are we going to tell our
[1:15:52] children children what the word says are
[1:15:54] we too afraid to tell them that how are
[1:15:56] they going to know if we are too afraid
[1:15:58] to tell them what the word says if the
[1:16:00] word says it and we're too afraid to
[1:16:02] tell them then what's that say about us
[1:16:04] we're not following our duty in the
[1:16:08] word you know as as a man and a woman of
[1:16:11] God you know like a woman she's allowed
[1:16:13] to preach to her kids she's the Fifth
[1:16:18] Gospel and if she never does her
[1:16:21] Duty then is she a good good
[1:16:27] mother and the serpent said unto woman
[1:16:31] you shall not surely die you know he's
[1:16:33] eating of the wrong tree he's trying to
[1:16:35] twist the
[1:16:36] word he's not coming sincerely and open
[1:16:40] before the
[1:16:41] Lord for God knoweth that in the day
[1:16:44] that ye eat thereof then your eyes shall
[1:16:46] be open and you shall be as Gods knowing
[1:16:48] good and
[1:16:50] evil and then when the woman saw that it
[1:16:52] was good for food did she go to her her
[1:16:54] her head and ask him his opinion about
[1:16:56] the situation or did she actually go out
[1:16:58] and do whatever she thought was right
[1:17:00] and then come to him later and present
[1:17:02] something to him what did she
[1:17:07] do and she
[1:17:09] saw when she saw the tree was good for
[1:17:12] food and it was pleasant to the eyes and
[1:17:13] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[1:17:15] she took of the fruit thereof and then
[1:17:17] eat and gave also unto her husband with
[1:17:19] her and he did eat and the eyes of them
[1:17:22] both were open and they knew that they
[1:17:24] were naked and sued fig leaves together
[1:17:27] and made themselves aprons so here they
[1:17:30] was ate of the wrong tree and all of a
[1:17:32] sudden they realized they was naked
[1:17:34] before they didn't have a problem with
[1:17:36] it they was open and honest before
[1:17:38] everybody everybody knew how what they
[1:17:41] were and what kind of Life they lived
[1:17:43] and everything it was open but now they
[1:17:45] got something hied now they're ashamed
[1:17:48] of what they did but they don't want to
[1:17:49] be open and honest about it they want to
[1:17:51] hide it keep it from everybody's
[1:17:55] vision and they heard the voice of the
[1:17:57] Lord Walking In The Garden in the cool
[1:17:59] of the day and Adam and his wife hid
[1:18:01] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[1:18:03] amongst the Trees of the garden and the
[1:18:05] Lord God called Adam and said unto them
[1:18:08] where art
[1:18:11] you and he said I heard thy voice in the
[1:18:14] garden I was afraid because I was naked
[1:18:16] and I hid myself you know we we did
[1:18:19] wrong we know we did wrong we did
[1:18:21] something it wasn't right and instead of
[1:18:23] being open and honest and sincere in our
[1:18:26] heart saying Lord forgive us we want to
[1:18:29] hide say oh it's not my fault I'm I'm
[1:18:32] hiding I got something to
[1:18:35] hide and he said who told thee thou was
[1:18:37] naked hast thou eaten of the tree
[1:18:40] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[1:18:41] should us not eat you know he he asked
[1:18:44] him Point Blank the question he knew
[1:18:45] what was going on giving him an
[1:18:47] opportunity to come
[1:18:49] clean and the man said the woman see p
[1:18:53] the book to somebody else it ain't my
[1:18:54] fault I did it but it's her fault I did
[1:18:56] it somebody else's
[1:18:59] fault you know I might have I might have
[1:19:02] been in sin and I might have been caught
[1:19:04] red-handed but since you didn't see me
[1:19:05] literally with your eyes and it's the
[1:19:07] same as me not doing it no if you're
[1:19:09] guilty you're guilty just repent and and
[1:19:12] make things right and go on don't try to
[1:19:13] hide it and justify
[1:19:16] yourself well I might have did this but
[1:19:18] he did something worse over there well
[1:19:20] that brother needs a repent but that
[1:19:22] don't mean you don't need
[1:19:24] to and the man said the woman whom thou
[1:19:27] givest me she gave me to eat of the tree
[1:19:28] and I did eat and the Lord said unto the
[1:19:31] woman what is this that thou Hast done
[1:19:34] is the woman going to come clean too no
[1:19:37] the woman said the serpent deceived me
[1:19:39] and I did eat so it's always somebody
[1:19:42] else's fault even though we know we did
[1:19:44] wrong we don't want to admit we did
[1:19:46] wrong we don't want to say I'm sorry oh
[1:19:48] it's somebody else's fault not my fault
[1:19:51] their fault
[1:20:00] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:20:02] because thou Hast done this thou are
[1:20:03] cursed above all cattle and above all
[1:20:05] the beasts of the field upon the belly
[1:20:07] Thou shalt go and thust Y shall eat of
[1:20:10] all thy days let me skip on down
[1:20:19] here now since we know the situation of
[1:20:22] man has came into they already ate of
[1:20:24] the wrong tree and they're already
[1:20:26] manifesting the fruits of that tree
[1:20:28] they're already trying to deceive lie
[1:20:30] and hide behind somebody else's faults
[1:20:33] instead of admitting they got their own
[1:20:34] faults now we're going to read in
[1:20:36] Malachi chapter 4 and see whenever God
[1:20:40] came down he gave him a
[1:20:41] solution and he came and gave him Moses
[1:20:44] and Moses gave him the law and tried to
[1:20:46] get them to do right and they couldn't
[1:20:47] do it right in their in their own merits
[1:20:49] and their own efforts they couldn't do
[1:20:51] it under the law of Moses Moes he gave
[1:20:53] him he gave him Abraham Abram told him
[1:20:56] how to do it with under Abraham and
[1:20:58] Abraham was successful in just being
[1:21:00] honest and open before God and
[1:21:01] surrendering all to God and God was
[1:21:04] pleased and satisfied with that but the
[1:21:05] people wasn't they wanted something that
[1:21:07] they could do their own self and God
[1:21:09] said no that ain't happening that ain't
[1:21:10] going to work but he gave them the law
[1:21:11] anyway just to show them that it didn't
[1:21:13] work and then they became a miserable
[1:21:17] failure cuz the problem with knowing the
[1:21:19] word is you can hide behind the word and
[1:21:22] twist word in order to justify yourself
[1:21:24] because you know just enough about the
[1:21:25] word to be
[1:21:27] dangerous I'm not going to give you any
[1:21:29] examples of that because I know that
[1:21:32] there are situations that you can always
[1:21:34] blame what you're doing on somebody else
[1:21:37] you can always it it's you can do it
[1:21:39] every single
[1:21:41] time but over in Malachi chapter 4 it
[1:21:45] says for the day cometh that shall burn
[1:21:48] as an oven and all the proud so that's
[1:21:51] one reason why we don't want to admit
[1:21:52] we're wrong cuz we're too
[1:21:53] proud and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:21:57] stubble and the day that shall cometh
[1:21:59] shall burn them up sayith the Lord of
[1:22:01] host that it shall leave them neither
[1:22:03] root nor
[1:22:04] Branch that's that's one side of the the
[1:22:07] ones the ones that ate of the wrong tree
[1:22:09] the ones that's manifesting the wrong
[1:22:11] tree manifesting those desires out in
[1:22:13] the flesh doing the wrong things they're
[1:22:15] going to be burned as
[1:22:18] stubble but the other side those unto
[1:22:21] you that fear my name or my ways my
[1:22:24] nature shall be shall the son of
[1:22:26] righteousness arise with healing in his
[1:22:28] wings and ye shall go forth and grow up
[1:22:30] as calves and the Stalls and you shall
[1:22:33] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[1:22:34] ashes Under The Souls of your feet and
[1:22:37] the day that I do this sayith the Lord
[1:22:40] of
[1:22:41] hosts then he brings them back to the
[1:22:43] remembrance remember what Moses told you
[1:22:45] to do remember ye the law of Moses my
[1:22:48] servant which I commanded unto him and
[1:22:50] for all Israel with the Statue
[1:22:52] States and the judgments and he told
[1:22:54] them over and over in other places he
[1:22:56] told them he would write it in their
[1:22:57] hearts not just on the outside of their
[1:22:59] flesh and listen to this promise he said
[1:23:03] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:23:05] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:23:07] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[1:23:10] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[1:23:13] the children and the hearts of the
[1:23:15] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:23:17] and smite the Earth with a curse and
[1:23:19] that is prophecy and we know is
[1:23:21] fulfilled and and smite the Earth with
[1:23:23] the curse ain't it just coincidental
[1:23:26] that when the prophet was born if you go
[1:23:28] back to the time of where his conception
[1:23:30] would be and he said he was a fullterm
[1:23:31] baby if you go back to that you'll find
[1:23:33] out that's when the tunguska event
[1:23:35] happened if you remember what that is
[1:23:37] that's when that big asteroid came and
[1:23:39] it blew up over Russia and blew off all
[1:23:42] those trees and they said if it would
[1:23:44] have actually made contact with the
[1:23:45] Earth that would have been a doomsday
[1:23:47] event so there at there lest I come and
[1:23:51] smite the Earth with a curse that would
[1:23:52] have have been a major curse right there
[1:23:54] but it blew up in the sky and it didn't
[1:23:56] happen and if you back figure it back
[1:23:58] from when he was born to the date where
[1:24:00] his conception was it happened on the
[1:24:02] very exact day where that
[1:24:05] happened so that happened and this right
[1:24:07] here he said he came and sent us a
[1:24:11] promise of that Prophet restoring our
[1:24:13] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[1:24:16] seeing we know that happened because of
[1:24:18] what we believe but we can also look
[1:24:20] back in history and see that that
[1:24:22] tunguska event blew up over there and
[1:24:25] that right there came at the exact same
[1:24:27] time that he would have been
[1:24:29] conceived so let let's go a little
[1:24:32] further you know ain't you glad that God
[1:24:34] was merciful enough for us to send us a
[1:24:36] man that God could speak through to
[1:24:38] point us back to what the original faith
[1:24:40] of the apostolic fathers was it ain't on
[1:24:43] our own because everyone was going
[1:24:46] astray and in the church they buil
[1:24:48] you'll find a place where brother
[1:24:49] Brandon said even the ministry was going
[1:24:50] astray so just because of man as a
[1:24:52] minister don't mean he can stand up and
[1:24:54] say he was righteous no he was just as
[1:24:56] lost as all the rest of them he had to
[1:24:57] come back to the word just like we had
[1:24:59] to come back to the word and if we don't
[1:25:02] come back to the word how can we
[1:25:04] manifest what that word
[1:25:08] says now the now on this is Matthew and
[1:25:12] uh this is chapter 1 verse 18 now the
[1:25:15] birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise
[1:25:18] when his well I'm I'm rushing through
[1:25:20] this a little bit Yeah forget forget me
[1:25:22] if this is too boring to you I know I'm
[1:25:25] not as active and and dramatic and as
[1:25:28] brother Loy he's a lot better preacher
[1:25:30] than I
[1:25:31] am I'm kind of boring sometimes so you
[1:25:34] just forgive
[1:25:35] me when as his mother Mary was a spouse
[1:25:38] of Joseph before they came together she
[1:25:40] was found with child of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:43] you know she was sincere and open you
[1:25:45] remember back whenever the angel said to
[1:25:46] her he said she said be it unto me
[1:25:48] according to your word you know she was
[1:25:50] just living the life she was being
[1:25:51] sincere sin to who she was on the inside
[1:25:54] she was open and honest before him you
[1:25:56] know she was manifesting the tree of
[1:26:00] life she was found with child of the
[1:26:02] Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being
[1:26:04] a just man say he was manifesting the
[1:26:07] right kind of tree he was trying to
[1:26:09] manifest sincerity and openness before
[1:26:11] the Lord just like she was and not
[1:26:14] willing to make her a public example you
[1:26:16] know he she he wasn't going even though
[1:26:18] he thought that she might have sinned he
[1:26:20] wasn't going to expose her and try to
[1:26:22] have her
[1:26:23] murdered you know we we could learn that
[1:26:25] a lot of times in in our ranks too we
[1:26:27] find out a man make a little mistake or
[1:26:29] something instead of praying for the
[1:26:31] Brethren hoping him getting to get
[1:26:32] restored we want to point it out and try
[1:26:34] to condemn him and run him over with the
[1:26:36] bus and everything else but that's not
[1:26:38] the way Joseph was and and according to
[1:26:41] the you know what you was thinking if
[1:26:43] this happened to you you would have a
[1:26:44] right to do that too wouldn't you you
[1:26:46] would have a right to do it in your
[1:26:48] carnal speaking but he was a just man he
[1:26:50] wasn't willing to just go out and hurt
[1:26:52] somebody just for the point of proving
[1:26:54] that he could hurt
[1:26:55] them he was minded to put her away
[1:26:58] privately but while he thought on these
[1:27:01] things the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:27:02] unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou
[1:27:04] son of David fear not to take unto thee
[1:27:07] Mary thy wife do you think that he would
[1:27:09] ever came to him if he was he was in
[1:27:12] there of hatred and and hating his
[1:27:13] hating Mary and saying how could she
[1:27:16] ever do this and I'm gonna do this and
[1:27:18] I'm gonna do that and he was just just
[1:27:20] spewing all kinds of hatred out for her
[1:27:22] you think the angel of the Lord would
[1:27:23] have came in that
[1:27:25] atmosphere you know whenever we get all
[1:27:27] hoty and hatred and just filling in our
[1:27:29] you know not openly you know hope not
[1:27:31] you know you know we have that tree of
[1:27:33] knowledge and good and evil we kind of
[1:27:34] keep it to ourselves sometimes but if we
[1:27:37] got that steaming in ourselves you know
[1:27:38] I don't like that brother that brother
[1:27:40] did this that brother did that you know
[1:27:42] what kind of an attitude are we in are
[1:27:44] we coming to the Lord in the right
[1:27:46] attitude you know what was what was
[1:27:48] brother Ally say he said anybody that
[1:27:50] comes to the Lord with the right mental
[1:27:51] attitude according to a promise of God
[1:27:53] we'll bring it to pass we're not
[1:27:55] bringing it to pass if we're coming in
[1:27:56] the wrong
[1:27:59] attitude well he thought on these things
[1:28:01] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[1:28:02] in a dream and Jose and saying Joseph
[1:28:04] thou son of David fear not to take unto
[1:28:07] thee marry thy wife for that which is
[1:28:10] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:13] and she being she shall bring forth a
[1:28:15] son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[1:28:18] you now this is the Holy Ghost it is
[1:28:20] conceived in her as of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:22] and she shall call his name Jesus for he
[1:28:24] shall save his people from their sins so
[1:28:28] we already seen that they fell in the
[1:28:29] Garden of Eden and that was a sin there
[1:28:32] and that was you know it was so much of
[1:28:34] a sin that man's been suffering from it
[1:28:36] ever since ever since that time man has
[1:28:39] been suffering from it they're still
[1:28:40] suffering from it today and it says here
[1:28:43] he's s in it for Jesus shall save his
[1:28:45] people from their sins so now we got the
[1:28:48] promise of of Elijah coming and
[1:28:50] restoring us to the faith of the fathers
[1:28:52] and now we got the very purchase sit of
[1:28:55] who is going to save us from our sins
[1:28:58] here now all that was done that it might
[1:29:01] be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:29:03] Lord by the prophet saying Behold a
[1:29:05] virgin shall be with child and shall
[1:29:08] bring forth a son and they shall call
[1:29:09] his name Emanuel which being interpreted
[1:29:12] is god with us so there is God With Us
[1:29:17] now before he couldn't be with them he
[1:29:19] was above them then he was with them
[1:29:23] then Joseph being raised from sleep did
[1:29:26] as the angel of the Lord had bidden him
[1:29:28] and took un his wife and knew her not
[1:29:31] till he she had brought forth her
[1:29:33] firstborn son and he called his name
[1:29:36] Jesus so he obeyed the voice of the Lord
[1:29:40] because it didn't contradict the word
[1:29:42] and he was sincere and if he was sincere
[1:29:44] he could see that it didn't contradict
[1:29:45] the word sometimes we come with the word
[1:29:48] with so many preconceived ideas that we
[1:29:50] think the word has to mean this and then
[1:29:53] we come out to be like the Pharisees and
[1:29:55] we miss the very word manifested in
[1:29:57] flesh right before our eyes and and why
[1:30:00] it's because we're coming with the wrong
[1:30:02] attitude we're coming with the wrong
[1:30:04] wrong spirit because we don't want to
[1:30:06] admit that we're wrong we don't want to
[1:30:08] look in that mirror of the word and say
[1:30:10] hey I'm not lining up with the word
[1:30:12] therefore I need a change no we see the
[1:30:14] word and the word since Jesus Walking In
[1:30:17] the Flesh right before us and since that
[1:30:20] Jesus Walking In the Flesh don't reflect
[1:30:22] what's in the mirror that we're looking
[1:30:24] at well that can't be right even though
[1:30:26] it was the word Walking In the Flesh
[1:30:28] right among
[1:30:31] us and then we jump down here to John
[1:30:33] chapter 3 so we can see how that we can
[1:30:36] be
[1:30:37] restored there was a man of the
[1:30:40] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[1:30:42] je Jews he wasn't just an average person
[1:30:45] he was a ruler of the Jews the same came
[1:30:48] to Jesus by night and said unto him
[1:30:50] Rabbi we know thou are a teacher it come
[1:30:53] from God for no man can do these
[1:30:55] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[1:30:57] with him and Jesus answered and said
[1:30:59] unto him you know he he didn't even
[1:31:02] acknowledge what he said really he
[1:31:04] looked at him and what he said was true
[1:31:06] he didn't refute him he didn't
[1:31:07] contradict him he just told him he just
[1:31:10] gave him additional truth he just gave
[1:31:11] him some truth to think on it verily
[1:31:14] verily I say unto thee except the man be
[1:31:16] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:31:19] God it seemed like he was on a totally
[1:31:21] different subject but was
[1:31:23] it he already admitted he was a a man
[1:31:26] came from God and if he was a man came
[1:31:28] from God if he did come from God he
[1:31:30] might as well tell him what God's
[1:31:31] thoughts were and that's what he is he
[1:31:33] told him what God's thoughts were and
[1:31:36] that blew Nicodemus away he said how can
[1:31:38] a man being born when he is old can he
[1:31:41] enter a second time into his mother's
[1:31:43] womb and be born so he came trying to
[1:31:47] reason with the tree of knowledge of
[1:31:49] Good and Evil he didn't come trying to
[1:31:51] reason with the tree of life he didn't
[1:31:53] come
[1:31:54] open open saying just mold me in your
[1:31:57] image I want to you know that song says
[1:32:00] I want to do your will oh Lord I want to
[1:32:02] do your will oh Lord take me break me
[1:32:05] mold me and make me I want to do your
[1:32:07] will oh Lord he didn't come in that
[1:32:09] attitude he came and how can that be I
[1:32:11] don't understand that you know like we
[1:32:13] was reading earlier about Moses Moses
[1:32:14] didn't come and say I don't understand
[1:32:16] why that bush is burning why is that
[1:32:18] burning that way he just came up before
[1:32:19] it and then a voice spoke through that
[1:32:22] bush usually when somebody tells you
[1:32:25] about something speaking to them out of
[1:32:26] a bush you think they're mentally insane
[1:32:29] is that the way we're going to come to
[1:32:30] the
[1:32:32] word it saids something different than
[1:32:34] what we thought so how can this
[1:32:37] be Nicodemus said unto them how can a
[1:32:39] man be born when he is old can he enter
[1:32:41] a second time in his mother's womb and
[1:32:43] Jesus said verily verily I say unto thee
[1:32:46] except a man be born of water and of the
[1:32:48] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[1:32:51] of God God so it doesn't matter if we're
[1:32:54] high up or not if we haven't been born
[1:32:57] of the spirit it doesn't matter how high
[1:32:59] you are on this Earth because you're
[1:33:01] still in the
[1:33:03] flesh that which is born of flesh is
[1:33:06] flesh and that which is born of the
[1:33:08] spirit of spirit we're all born in the
[1:33:10] flesh we all come into the world
[1:33:11] speaking lies born in sin speaking Lies
[1:33:14] We all done that that was our fleshly
[1:33:16] condition but if you're born in the
[1:33:18] spirit you're born in a different W
[1:33:20] Realm Marvel not that I said unto thee
[1:33:23] you must be born again the wind bloweth
[1:33:25] where it listes and thou hearest the
[1:33:27] sound thereof but thou cast not tell
[1:33:29] once it cometh or whether it goeth so is
[1:33:32] everyone that is born of the
[1:33:34] spirit Nicodemus answered and said unto
[1:33:37] him how can these things be so he still
[1:33:39] didn't know some things you don't have
[1:33:42] to know it you just have to experience
[1:33:45] it some things you can't understand
[1:33:47] about the new birth but unless you have
[1:33:49] it you ain't gonna be able to explain it
[1:33:52] you can repeat what some other person
[1:33:53] said about it but unless you got it
[1:33:55] yourself you can't explain how it come
[1:33:58] to you personally you know just like the
[1:34:00] scripture no man can call Jesus the
[1:34:02] Christ except by the Holy Ghost anybody
[1:34:04] can say Jesus is the Christ but they
[1:34:06] can't say it and know it because he's
[1:34:10] not their Christ he's not their
[1:34:12] Lord because they're not living what he
[1:34:14] asked them to do how can somebody be
[1:34:16] your lord when you're not even living
[1:34:17] what you know he wants you to
[1:34:19] do art thou a master and knowest not
[1:34:22] these things verily verily I say unto
[1:34:25] thee we speak that we do know and
[1:34:28] testify that we have seen and you
[1:34:31] receive not our
[1:34:33] witness if I have told you of Earthly
[1:34:36] things and you believe not how shall you
[1:34:38] believe if I tell you of heavenly things
[1:34:40] so if a minister is telling you things
[1:34:42] that's even Earthly over the pull pit
[1:34:44] you know like how you should live and
[1:34:46] how you should do the things that's
[1:34:47] right and read the basic Common Sense
[1:34:50] things you disagree with that how are
[1:34:52] you going to tell him whenever he tells
[1:34:53] you that you're the bride of Christ and
[1:34:54] never sin in the first place and none of
[1:34:56] that applies to you at all you're like
[1:34:58] wow I don't understand that I'm guilty
[1:35:00] but yet I'm not guilty it's because
[1:35:02] there's a process that has to be there
[1:35:05] you have to actually be born again in
[1:35:07] order for that to come to pass in your
[1:35:09] life and no man hath ascended up into
[1:35:12] heaven but he that came down from heaven
[1:35:14] even a son of man which is in heaven
[1:35:17] isn't that marvelous that's just like us
[1:35:20] you know here we are born in the flesh
[1:35:22] but yet there is a spirit when we're
[1:35:24] born again which when we hear from our
[1:35:26] theophany that's whenever we come down
[1:35:28] from heaven and here he said he was in
[1:35:30] heaven but he was standing there on
[1:35:33] Earth says Jesus was he says the
[1:35:39] U in in verse 13 it says and no man
[1:35:42] ascendeth up to heaven but he that came
[1:35:44] down from heaven even the son of man
[1:35:46] which is in heaven so here he was on
[1:35:49] Earth speaking to Nicodemus saying that
[1:35:51] he was in heaven whenever he is on Earth
[1:35:54] so you can be in the flesh but you can
[1:35:56] still be in the spirit at the same time
[1:35:58] because the spirit will override the
[1:36:00] flesh but not if you're catering to the
[1:36:02] flesh if you're catering to the flesh
[1:36:03] the spirit ain't going to override the
[1:36:05] flesh but if you're catering to the
[1:36:07] spirit that's a different
[1:36:09] story which one's more
[1:36:11] powerful Moses lifted up the serpent in
[1:36:14] the wilderness even so must the son of
[1:36:16] man be lifted up this is how he's
[1:36:19] describing to you how you're going to be
[1:36:21] redeemed he's going to be Redeemed by
[1:36:23] being lifted
[1:36:24] up that whosoever believeth in him
[1:36:27] should not perish but have eternal life
[1:36:30] now we can take that and twist that and
[1:36:32] say it doesn't matter what you do you
[1:36:34] can do all the evil in the world never
[1:36:36] repent and do nothing only thing you got
[1:36:38] to do is believe in Jesus and you can go
[1:36:39] to heaven we can take that but then we
[1:36:41] would be just like the serpent twisting
[1:36:43] the word to our own means yeah we got to
[1:36:46] read what else he said we need to take
[1:36:49] all the word we don't need to take
[1:36:50] partial word we need all the
[1:36:53] word for God sent not his son into the
[1:36:56] world to condemn the world on the same
[1:36:58] hand we ain't supposed to condemn
[1:36:59] somebody made a mistake either supposed
[1:37:01] to help them to be restored back to the
[1:37:03] truth but that the world through him
[1:37:07] might be
[1:37:09] saved this is what else he said he don't
[1:37:11] just stop at saying that you can believe
[1:37:13] on me and you can live any kind of life
[1:37:14] you want to after that now he goes into
[1:37:17] more detail in verse 18 we just want to
[1:37:20] jump to we want to jump to John 3:16 and
[1:37:23] leave out the first part where he tells
[1:37:25] Nicodemus he has to be born again and
[1:37:26] then leave out the back part where he
[1:37:28] says he how you're supposed to believe
[1:37:30] him he that believeth on him is not
[1:37:33] condemned but he that believeth not is
[1:37:36] condemned
[1:37:38] already because he had not believed in
[1:37:41] the name of the only begotten Son of God
[1:37:44] and this is the condemnation that light
[1:37:46] is coming to the world and Men love
[1:37:48] Darkness rather than light because their
[1:37:50] deeds was evil
[1:37:52] so if we if our Deeds are evil and we
[1:37:54] love our deeds and our evilness you know
[1:37:57] we can use that tree of Good and Evil
[1:37:58] and we can justify our evil Deeds by
[1:38:01] saying that what that light said is not
[1:38:02] true we can twist that word in such a
[1:38:05] way to justify our own self or we can be
[1:38:08] of the tree of life and come just
[1:38:10] manifesting what is in our life living
[1:38:12] through our soul and just yielding over
[1:38:15] to that light that we can see how to
[1:38:18] live but are we going to love Darkness
[1:38:21] more than
[1:38:23] light for everyone that doeth evil
[1:38:27] hateth the light neither cometh to the
[1:38:29] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[1:38:32] if my Deeds are evil I need to come to
[1:38:34] the light so I can reprove my Deeds so
[1:38:36] he can live through
[1:38:38] me it's not what I do it's what he does
[1:38:41] through me but he that he but he that
[1:38:45] doeth truth cometh to the light he don't
[1:38:50] come to the light because he's perfect
[1:38:52] he comes to the light that his deeds may
[1:38:54] be man he manifest that they are wrought
[1:38:56] in God and if I'm looking at that mirror
[1:38:59] and I come into the light and my Deeds
[1:39:01] is not reflecting what that mirror says
[1:39:03] I'm supposed to be doing then that my
[1:39:05] Deeds is what needs to be changed and
[1:39:07] the only way that my Deeds can be
[1:39:08] changed is if I go back and do what
[1:39:10] Jesus told
[1:39:11] Nicodemus I have to be born again like
[1:39:14] Nicodemus was I can't just twist it and
[1:39:17] say well the word don't apply to that
[1:39:19] because of
[1:39:20] this
[1:39:22] and even in John whenever he came down
[1:39:25] and preached and you can find this in
[1:39:26] John chapter 3 we'll skip down to
[1:39:29] 30 and somebody came to him and said
[1:39:31] well Jesus was baptizing and he's
[1:39:33] baptizing more people than you what did
[1:39:35] John did John get jealous did he triy to
[1:39:37] justify himself well anybody comes hear
[1:39:40] him is those people you know if you
[1:39:41] really believe the truth you believe me
[1:39:43] and come follow me that's not what John
[1:39:45] said John actually knew his position it
[1:39:48] went to so high and stopped I asked a
[1:39:51] Jewish man one time he wasn't a rabbi so
[1:39:53] he might not be all that uh you know you
[1:39:57] can just take it as his opinion but I
[1:39:59] asked a Jewish man because sometimes I'm
[1:40:00] in ignorance and sometimes I want to
[1:40:02] know you know little skull caps on their
[1:40:04] head and I asked him said why are you
[1:40:06] wearing that skull cap on your head and
[1:40:07] he said it's because as a Jewish man I
[1:40:10] believe that I go so far and then I stop
[1:40:13] and everything above me is God you know
[1:40:15] that's be a lot of common sense for us
[1:40:17] too to know that we're not as powerful
[1:40:19] as God that we are supposed to be
[1:40:20] subject to God his word whenever we come
[1:40:22] across something in the word of God
[1:40:23] that's different than what we think we
[1:40:25] need to change
[1:40:26] ourselves we need to say Lord I
[1:40:28] Surrender help me there's a place and I
[1:40:30] I'm failing
[1:40:33] there and John said he must increase and
[1:40:36] I must decrease he that Cometh From
[1:40:38] Above is above all he that is of the
[1:40:41] earth is Earthly is that the same way
[1:40:43] you know we're in the flesh that's from
[1:40:46] below but he that Cometh From Above when
[1:40:48] we're born again he's above all
[1:40:51] so if you're born again he that is in
[1:40:54] you is greater than he that is in the
[1:40:55] world so you ain't got no excuse that
[1:40:58] well my flesh made me do it because I
[1:40:59] was born to sinful parents and that's a
[1:41:01] trait that runs in my family for years
[1:41:03] and years and years and they always had
[1:41:04] this bad trait we always lean to this
[1:41:07] way so I got an excuse to do that no you
[1:41:08] don't if you're born from above you got
[1:41:10] a stronger Spirit within you that can
[1:41:13] overcome that
[1:41:15] flesh he that Cometh From Above is above
[1:41:18] all he that is of the Earth Earth is
[1:41:21] Earthly and speaketh of the earth he
[1:41:24] that Cometh From Heaven is above all
[1:41:26] he's not above just a little bit he's
[1:41:28] above all so he's above those pesky
[1:41:31] problems just surrender to him let let
[1:41:33] him help you overcome
[1:41:35] them you ain't got to stress about it
[1:41:37] and say well whenever I get to be right
[1:41:39] then I can I can let brother blatte know
[1:41:42] that I can do such and such in church
[1:41:44] now because now I'm perfect and overcome
[1:41:46] that problem and then next week you'll
[1:41:48] stumble with falling lands flat on your
[1:41:50] face and now are you no longer qualified
[1:41:52] to do that no more now you need to
[1:41:54] repent ask the Lord to help you get rid
[1:41:56] of
[1:42:08] that listen to this and what he has seen
[1:42:11] and heard he testified and no man
[1:42:13] receiveth his testimony you know some
[1:42:16] people won't believe that you've been
[1:42:17] born again some people won't believe no
[1:42:19] matter
[1:42:21] like a man at my work he told me one
[1:42:23] time that he didn't believe in people
[1:42:24] going to church and getting saved and
[1:42:27] they thinking they're changing a brand
[1:42:28] new person because it's impossible for
[1:42:30] anybody to say to do that that might be
[1:42:32] true in one sense you can't change
[1:42:34] yourself but God can God can change you
[1:42:37] until you met God you'll never know if
[1:42:39] you can change yourself because you
[1:42:40] can't God can change it through you he
[1:42:42] can give you that desire to
[1:42:45] change he that hath received his
[1:42:48] testimony has set to his is seal that
[1:42:51] God is true so if you if you received
[1:42:54] his gift then you know God's true you
[1:42:55] ain't got to guess you ain't got to take
[1:42:58] somebody else's
[1:43:02] testimony let's read
[1:43:05] uh let's go ahead and read uh what
[1:43:08] brother Brenham said in
[1:43:13] this I mean if are you living a life or
[1:43:15] you just living by a name that you had
[1:43:17] in the past or by by a reputation I
[1:43:20] believe what brother blat said so that
[1:43:22] means I'm going to heaven well if you
[1:43:24] ain't actually living what brother blat
[1:43:25] is telling you then how are you going to
[1:43:27] go to heaven when you're not living what
[1:43:28] he
[1:43:29] said are are you comparing what brother
[1:43:31] blat said with a word and if they're
[1:43:33] matching and they're lining up then why
[1:43:35] can't you surrender to the Lord and live
[1:43:37] what the word says because brother
[1:43:39] blatte ain't telling you what he thinks
[1:43:40] of his own opinion he's telling you what
[1:43:42] the Holy Spirit told him in his prayer
[1:43:44] chamber and whenever he's telling you
[1:43:46] what the word said in his prayer tramble
[1:43:48] and it's matching the word andever
[1:43:50] you're praying in your prayer chamber
[1:43:51] when your your spirit is agreeing with
[1:43:53] what the word said coming out coming out
[1:43:55] of his mouth then can't you surrender to
[1:43:57] the
[1:43:59] Lord I mean brother Brandon was speaking
[1:44:02] to a sister one time and she said that
[1:44:04] she couldn't surrender to the Lord and
[1:44:05] he typed it as as a as a woman
[1:44:07] surrendering to her husband you know all
[1:44:10] these years she kept her virtues true
[1:44:12] until she got married and then when she
[1:44:13] got married she had to surrender that to
[1:44:15] her husband that's the same way with us
[1:44:17] in Christ whenever we come to the word
[1:44:18] there's something in our nature that we
[1:44:20] can't let down we can't surrender
[1:44:22] because something in our flesh we have
[1:44:24] to recognize that he's our
[1:44:27] Lord and we have to surrender to him
[1:44:30] he's our husband the bridegroom
[1:44:33] impersonation of Christianity loh how so
[1:44:38] as I sit in amazement looking I thought
[1:44:40] well what caused this what stripped the
[1:44:42] life he's talking about the stripping
[1:44:44] the
[1:44:45] life what the Lutheran left the
[1:44:47] Methodist eaten what the Methodist left
[1:44:49] you ain't got to stay with just these
[1:44:51] names you can put any name you want to
[1:44:52] in that you can put in there any
[1:44:55] anything you know any message name or
[1:44:57] any name you put any name in there you
[1:44:59] want to what the Baptist left the
[1:45:02] nazarin eating what the nazarin left the
[1:45:05] Pentecostals eating and brother we have
[1:45:07] got nothing but a just a church
[1:45:11] name I thought isn't that something no
[1:45:14] wonder there's so much impersonation of
[1:45:16] Christianity nothing but a mock do we
[1:45:19] want to be Christian in name name only
[1:45:21] do we want to be messaging name only but
[1:45:23] we ain't got a life to back it
[1:45:25] up of course we don't want to do
[1:45:28] that I won't go over to that building no
[1:45:31] I wouldn't cooperate with such a thing a
[1:45:34] lack of life that's all not a lack of
[1:45:37] church but a lack of
[1:45:39] life so I said in my heart to God I said
[1:45:44] why do you still send the wind then then
[1:45:47] my wind went down to the scriptures too
[1:45:49] dark to REM my little Testament in my
[1:45:51] pocket but I said why would you send a
[1:45:54] wind and my and my mind went down the
[1:45:57] scriptures I will restore sayith the
[1:45:59] Lord all that the calipiter has eaten
[1:46:02] all that the Locust has eaten I will
[1:46:05] restore you know he's going to restore
[1:46:08] you might have fell in the Garden Eden
[1:46:09] you might have had that sin it might
[1:46:11] have be contaminating man from the
[1:46:14] beginning to the end but he told you you
[1:46:16] must be born again in Nicodemus he told
[1:46:18] us he sent us his prophet to restore our
[1:46:21] hearts back to the faith of the fathers
[1:46:23] so what is our excuse what is our excuse
[1:46:27] can we not surrender can we not be
[1:46:29] honest you know I I know if somebody
[1:46:31] comes up and start probing you and start
[1:46:33] asking you personal questions it ain't
[1:46:34] none of their business because we're not
[1:46:36] a Catholic priest and he's not our
[1:46:37] priest and we're not in the confession
[1:46:39] Booth but if the Lord's asking you in
[1:46:41] your heart you can be honest with the
[1:46:44] Lord you ain't got to be honest well you
[1:46:46] can be honest with me but you can tell
[1:46:48] me it ain't none of my business and go
[1:46:49] on my my own business business but if if
[1:46:52] the Lord is dealing with you it's not
[1:46:53] very easy to tell the Lord to go bug off
[1:46:55] and go mind his own business because you
[1:46:57] are part of
[1:47:00] him and if you're not a son of the
[1:47:02] father then you're son of another and
[1:47:04] that's not a good thing because all his
[1:47:05] sons Wills to receive correction of
[1:47:10] him let me skip that
[1:47:18] quote today there is so much based on
[1:47:23] intellectual this is a what does it take
[1:47:26] to make a good Christian Life I mean I
[1:47:29] mean we can be intellectual even if you
[1:47:31] know even if we're uh bragging about how
[1:47:33] dumb we are we can do that with an
[1:47:34] intellectual spirit because we know that
[1:47:37] you know if the fisherman was ignorant
[1:47:39] and they couldn't assign their own name
[1:47:41] and we can brag about how ignorant we
[1:47:42] are but we're doing it through
[1:47:43] industrialism that doesn't mean we're
[1:47:45] sincere we could be using the tree of
[1:47:47] knowledge of Good and Evil bragging
[1:47:48] about how ignorant we are
[1:47:51] it doesn't mean that you're ignorant
[1:47:52] that's the only way you can come to
[1:47:53] Christ it doesn't mean you're
[1:47:54] intellectual that's the only way you can
[1:47:56] come to Christ you come to Christ by
[1:47:58] being honest and sincere with the Lord
[1:48:01] telling him honestly from your heart now
[1:48:03] what what did Brother brandom say in
[1:48:04] that first quote we come to him sanely
[1:48:07] being open with him telling him what's
[1:48:09] in our heart and then he will receive
[1:48:11] you he's not going to reject you you
[1:48:14] know he might reject you if you you come
[1:48:16] to him looking warm and and not really
[1:48:18] caring one way or the other and not
[1:48:19] being open and honest with
[1:48:21] him but if you're being open and honest
[1:48:23] with him and willing to surrender to him
[1:48:26] he's going to receive
[1:48:28] you today there is so much based on
[1:48:31] intellectual there is so much based in
[1:48:33] Pentecostal upon Fanatics upon emotions
[1:48:37] now don't take a substitute when the
[1:48:39] Pentecostal skies are loaded with the
[1:48:41] real thing don't take a little emotions
[1:48:45] some little workup some little oil
[1:48:46] falling from your hands or bloody bloody
[1:48:49] face don't take these little emotions
[1:48:51] when the whole SK SKU of God is full of
[1:48:54] the real genuine Pentecostal blessing he
[1:48:57] will give you a new heart a new spirit
[1:49:00] and put his spirit in you so God's
[1:49:02] already promised to give you the holy
[1:49:04] spirit so why would you accept uh uh
[1:49:08] impersonation we don't want
[1:49:10] impersonation we want to be sincere we
[1:49:12] want to be
[1:49:14] real like one time I was riding in a a
[1:49:17] vehicle with with a well he was one my
[1:49:20] managers above me and and what he was
[1:49:23] what he was listening to was how to be
[1:49:25] perceived to to have integrity wow now
[1:49:30] now if you want to be perceived to be
[1:49:32] integrity that's one thing but if you
[1:49:34] are actually are integrity that's
[1:49:35] another level all together we don't want
[1:49:38] to just be perceived to be Christians we
[1:49:40] don't want to just be perceived as
[1:49:42] having an Integrity but we don't want to
[1:49:44] actually manifest what our life is
[1:49:46] declaring we want to be sincere with the
[1:49:48] Lord we don't want want to put on a
[1:49:51] dog we want to actually do what we're
[1:49:54] saying we are we don't want to brag
[1:49:56] about how big and bad we are then we go
[1:49:58] somewhere else we're we're lay down like
[1:50:00] we're a chicken we don't want to brag at
[1:50:03] all but if we do we want to back up what
[1:50:04] we're bragging
[1:50:06] about you know it's like what Paul said
[1:50:09] in one of his letters you know he said
[1:50:10] that whenever I come to you I'm going to
[1:50:12] be just like what I am in these letters
[1:50:14] I ain't going to be something
[1:50:17] different so let's go uh read uh Romans
[1:50:21] chapter 8 and then we'll wrap this up a
[1:50:23] little
[1:50:25] bit and at Romans chapter 8 I mean you
[1:50:28] can go back in the last end of Romans
[1:50:30] chapter 7 that's where Paul talks about
[1:50:33] what I would do I would not do and all
[1:50:35] that and some people can take that out
[1:50:37] of context and give themselves a right
[1:50:38] to go do anything they want to do say
[1:50:40] well I really want to do right but you
[1:50:42] know this over here is really appetizing
[1:50:44] and I want to go over here to this this
[1:50:46] thing and do my drugs and run with women
[1:50:48] and all that stuff but but my heart's
[1:50:50] really over here going to church but I'm
[1:50:51] going to go over here to this drug party
[1:50:53] and run with these women that's not what
[1:50:55] Paul's talking
[1:50:56] about if you go down to the next verses
[1:50:59] after he said that let's go see what
[1:51:01] he's actually saying let's not take just
[1:51:02] part of the word let's take all the
[1:51:05] word Romans chapter 8 and verse
[1:51:09] one now therefore there is therefore no
[1:51:13] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:51:15] Jesus has walked not after the flesh but
[1:51:17] after the spirit how are we going to to
[1:51:20] be walking we're going to be walking
[1:51:21] after the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:51:22] Evil we can do a lot of good things or
[1:51:25] we going to be walking after the Tree of
[1:51:27] Life are you going to be manifesting
[1:51:29] life or you going to be manifesting
[1:51:32] death for the law of the spirit of life
[1:51:35] in Christ Jesus ha made me free from the
[1:51:38] law of sin and death for what the law
[1:51:41] could not do and that it was weak
[1:51:43] through the flesh God sending his own
[1:51:46] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[1:51:49] for sin condemn sin in the
[1:51:51] flesh so that sin is condemned in the
[1:51:55] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[1:51:58] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[1:52:01] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:52:04] we're not walking after the flesh if
[1:52:05] we're walking after the flesh we're not
[1:52:07] fulfilling the law for walking after the
[1:52:09] spirit we are fulfilling the
[1:52:12] law and we know in another place that
[1:52:16] the Apostle Paul said love was the
[1:52:18] Fulfillment of the law if we're not
[1:52:19] manifesting love we're not fulfilling
[1:52:22] the
[1:52:24] law for they that are after The Flesh do
[1:52:27] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:52:29] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:52:31] the spirit so if you're manifesting
[1:52:33] chasing women you're manifesting the
[1:52:36] flesh if you're manifesting worshiping
[1:52:38] the Lord You're manifesting the spirit
[1:52:41] it's your choice God ain't going to
[1:52:42] force you to go to heaven it's your
[1:52:44] choice you pick this day who you will
[1:52:47] serve for to be carnal
[1:52:50] minded is death isn't that what happens
[1:52:53] when you eat the tree of Good and Evil
[1:52:55] that's death try to justify something
[1:52:58] that it's unjustifiable might as well
[1:53:00] just
[1:53:01] surrender ain't no reason to trying to
[1:53:03] justify
[1:53:04] it but to be spiritually minded is life
[1:53:07] and
[1:53:09] peace the Tree of Life the tree of death
[1:53:12] which one you going to manifest after
[1:53:15] because a carnal mind is enmity against
[1:53:17] God for it is not subject to the law of
[1:53:20] God neither indeed can be so how are we
[1:53:23] going to try to please God with our
[1:53:25] flesh whenever we can't do it the Bible
[1:53:27] says right there we cannot do it we're
[1:53:29] going to come and offer him fruits and
[1:53:31] vegetables on the altar like a Cain
[1:53:33] tried to do it didn't work for him why
[1:53:35] do you think it's going to work for us
[1:53:37] you know I I put the biggest offering in
[1:53:39] church this week that means I can go sin
[1:53:41] a little no I
[1:53:43] don't so then they that are in the flesh
[1:53:46] cannot please God but they but ye are
[1:53:50] not in the flesh but in the spirit
[1:53:53] so if so be that the spirit of God dwell
[1:53:56] in you see the spirit of God has to
[1:53:59] dwell in you Jesus Christ is the hope of
[1:54:01] glory but Christ in you is the hope of
[1:54:04] glory that's our hope is Christ actually
[1:54:07] living in us that we can be
[1:54:09] sincere now if any man have not the
[1:54:12] spirit of Christ he is none of his and
[1:54:14] if we refuse Christ Spirit we can't say
[1:54:17] we're of Jesus Christ we can't go Heaven
[1:54:20] if we're not going to receive the new
[1:54:22] birth if we refuse that life living in
[1:54:25] us that we can be sincere and open and
[1:54:28] somebody says brother I don't agree with
[1:54:30] this something over here can we look at
[1:54:32] him sincerely and and consider what he's
[1:54:34] saying or just blow him off before we
[1:54:36] even hear a word he says so the reason
[1:54:38] why he's he's thinking that way because
[1:54:40] he don't like me about such and such and
[1:54:42] it could be the furthest thing from the
[1:54:43] truth we can be open at least hear what
[1:54:45] he says what he's saying might be true
[1:54:48] what he said might be a misunderstanding
[1:54:50] we don't know but if we just blow him
[1:54:52] off and not be sincere and open with one
[1:54:56] another are we not going to be sincere
[1:54:58] it might not be any of his business I
[1:55:01] heard this one brother one time he said
[1:55:03] that one of his small children was doing
[1:55:06] something this other person didn't agree
[1:55:08] with and this other person came up to
[1:55:10] him and said you need to correct your
[1:55:12] child because he did this this and this
[1:55:14] and the brother considered what she said
[1:55:16] and said well he thought in his mind
[1:55:18] well that's not wrong he he just looked
[1:55:20] at her and Saidi will take care of that
[1:55:22] whenever I get whenever I get him alone
[1:55:24] and he didn't say another word about it
[1:55:25] because what his child did wouldn't
[1:55:27] wasn't wrong it was just her opinion
[1:55:28] that it was wrong now now it would have
[1:55:31] been a different story if she would well
[1:55:33] like I said if I was another man and I
[1:55:36] try to come to another man's wife and
[1:55:37] try to correct his wife whenever she's
[1:55:39] not my wife you know I could come to him
[1:55:42] and say I don't agree with this and this
[1:55:44] but if it ain't none of my business it
[1:55:45] ain't none of my business you
[1:55:48] know
[1:55:50] you know you got to recognize your
[1:55:51] position only go so
[1:55:54] far so let's uh read this quote from
[1:55:57] Daniel's instructions uh Gabriel's
[1:56:00] instructions to Daniel then we'll ask
[1:56:02] for the music to come back up says I see
[1:56:05] people getting in the flesh and shouting
[1:56:08] and carrying on and going out and living
[1:56:10] all kinds of lives is that why we are
[1:56:11] we're coming into church we're
[1:56:13] professing we believer we're professing
[1:56:15] we're doing what the word says but we're
[1:56:16] going out living all kinds of other
[1:56:18] lives are we do at well we should be
[1:56:20] ashamed of ourselves if we
[1:56:22] are and there's got to be a genuine Holy
[1:56:25] Spirit there somewhere I see people
[1:56:28] acting religious and so forth and trying
[1:56:30] to be Pious I know there's a genuine God
[1:56:33] somewhere you know just because you see
[1:56:34] somebody like that that don't mean it's
[1:56:36] all folk and Hokey Pokey for everything
[1:56:38] else the very evidence that there is a
[1:56:40] fake one means there's a real one
[1:56:44] somewhere so if you come in and you see
[1:56:46] a brother in here that's not living
[1:56:48] where he's supposed to and you see him
[1:56:49] did something wrong out there and then
[1:56:51] he comes in here say oh everybody that
[1:56:53] church is wrong no there might be a true
[1:56:54] one in here too might be a real genuine
[1:56:57] Christian that brother might just need
[1:56:59] to be lifted up in prayer for a little
[1:57:01] bit there's got to be a genuine Holy
[1:57:04] Spirit somewhere I see people acting
[1:57:06] religious and so forth and trying to be
[1:57:08] Pious I know there's a genuine God
[1:57:10] somewhere there's a genuine Spirit
[1:57:12] somewhere cuz there's an old hypocrite
[1:57:14] that's made off of it an old bogus one
[1:57:17] there's got to be something that's real
[1:57:19] a man a people a church a god there's
[1:57:23] got to be something true somewhere cuz
[1:57:25] these was just copied off of it there's
[1:57:28] something real
[1:57:31] somewhere amen so let's just come to
[1:57:34] music I said this to the church about
[1:57:37] your gifts listen to your gifts keep
[1:57:39] them in the Bible don't take a
[1:57:41] substitute when the skies are full of
[1:57:43] the real ones let's keep the real ones
[1:57:46] let's get the real and don't have any or
[1:57:50] don't have any at all so it's not the
[1:57:52] gifts it's wrong but if you got the
[1:57:54] wrong ones it's best not even have them
[1:57:57] so let's bow our
[1:57:58] heads we ask brother Ellie come back up
[1:58:01] dear Lord Jesus we come before you
[1:58:03] father and we just ask Lord that even
[1:58:05] though this wasn't fast-paced or or real
[1:58:09] upbeat father we just ask that you would
[1:58:10] somehow take the words Lord and and
[1:58:13] deliver them unto your children how you
[1:58:14] would have them to be delivered oh Lord
[1:58:16] that they would consider your words oh
[1:58:18] Father that was from your word and your
[1:58:21] message oh Father we just pray Lord that
[1:58:23] you would Quicken it to the hearts of
[1:58:25] the ones that you want it to be
[1:58:26] quickened to Lord that you could just
[1:58:28] lift them up Lord let them be encouraged
[1:58:30] that even though there might be a fake
[1:58:32] one here or there but father you have
[1:58:34] promised in your word that there is true
[1:58:36] ones there too that has actually
[1:58:37] surrendered all the way to your word
[1:58:39] Lord that has let that life live through
[1:58:41] them Father that they can manifest to
[1:58:44] all Lord that you are still alive and
[1:58:46] well and living today oh Father we thank
[1:58:50] you for all things Lord for we ask it in
[1:58:52] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:59:09] Lord wonderful praise

[1:59:21] [Applause]
[1:59:23] offering praise
[1:59:26] God praise
[1:59:29] God it was a
[1:59:32] lot that came to us
[1:59:36] tonight and I was really really
[1:59:41] blessed it's just amazing how God does
[1:59:45] it that it doesn't matter whether you
[1:59:47] are 2 3 10 20 100,000
[1:59:52] people one word

[2:00:00] blessed the way I may be touched by the
[2:00:02] word you may not be touched by the word
[2:00:04] the same way but the end of the day we
[2:00:05] are all
[2:00:06] blessed because God knows exactly what
[2:00:09] we need what I need may not be what you
[2:00:13] need and the word just comes praise be
[2:00:17] to God praise the Lord
[2:00:20] God bless you brother George thank you
[2:00:23] we appreciate your coming

[2:00:31] yielded to the Holy Ghost tonight and
[2:00:34] have been a blessing to us praise
[2:00:37] God a lot of things stood
[2:00:41] up and as I said it was like six Blind
[2:00:44] Men that were asked to describe an
[2:00:48] elephant the one that was Seated on the
[2:00:50] back said I'm sitting on a huge
[2:00:53] mountain the one that was holding the
[2:00:56] ear said oh this is the biggest fan I
[2:00:58] ever
[2:00:59] had the one that was holding a leg there
[2:01:02] this is a big tree the trunk of a big
[2:01:05] tree the one that was holding the TR
[2:01:07] said this is a mighty spear they all had
[2:01:11] different different
[2:01:13] different uh description but of the same
[2:01:18] animal so that is how we normally get
[2:01:21] blessed by the same Holy Spirit praise
[2:01:24] be to
[2:01:26] God and I I I took I have taken a few
[2:01:30] notes I'm not even going to go through
[2:01:32] everything I don't want my blessing
[2:01:34] tonight to override yours but if there
[2:01:37] is one thing I can just touch on or
[2:01:39] maybe two now I will just take one
[2:01:41] praise be to God then we can pray praise
[2:01:44] the
[2:01:46] Lord the man of God talked about
[2:01:50] love
[2:01:52] here Joseph and the way he treated Mary
[2:01:57] when he came to the
[2:01:58] realization that Mary was with
[2:02:01] seed just love projecting and getting to
[2:02:05] the very end of it again he mentions
[2:02:10] love
[2:02:11] love I can take
[2:02:14] this praise be to
[2:02:17] God
[2:02:19] talking about the word taking the word
[2:02:22] on his face
[2:02:23] value praise be to
[2:02:26] God do not add to
[2:02:29] it do not take away from
[2:02:35] it do not just take the portion that
[2:02:38] makes you feel
[2:02:40] good and the portion that makes you
[2:02:43] inconvenient you just throw that
[2:02:47] away just accept the word in its
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:53] fullness the Bible says that if our
[2:02:55] heart condemns us
[2:02:58] not we come before him with
[2:03:01] boldness but even where our hearts
[2:03:03] condemn us the Bible says he is greater
[2:03:07] than our hearts and he knows all
[2:03:11] things praise the
[2:03:13] Lord accept the word it is the word that
[2:03:18] brings you
[2:03:19] that transformational power of
[2:03:23] God is the
[2:03:25] word that sets you
[2:03:29] free Heaven and Earth shall pass
[2:03:31] away the only thing that would not pass
[2:03:34] away not even a j of it the prophet of
[2:03:36] God says is the
[2:03:39] word how do we ought to cherish the
[2:03:43] word cherish the word it's a treasure
[2:03:48] it's a treasure
[2:03:49] when we talk of treasure I don't want to
[2:03:52] go I mean praise he said a lot of
[2:03:54] wonderful things I wouldn't want to go
[2:03:56] too much into this so to take anything
[2:03:59] away from that I will just um we'll go
[2:04:02] before the Lord in
[2:04:04] prayer and just pray I just want us to
[2:04:08] pray be born
[2:04:10] again be born again getting the Holy
