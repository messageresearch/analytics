those that are grieving I also want to remember that all those that are upset and angry too but we also want to remember the those police officers too and you might think well why should we pray for them but you know God's way of looking at things I seem to remember somebody in the book of Acts call his name was Saul and he stood there and and when Stephen was stoned he hold they held the coats of those that actually killed Stephen and of course we know the story he was actually on his way to Damascus to arrest Christians who weren't doing anything wrong to bring them back to Jerusalem and then thrown many in jail and I believe many were killed and certainly God took that situation with that man and turned that around too so we just want to remember you know there's a group they have black lives matter but I want to say this morning the way the Lord looks that he says all lives matter so as we go to prayer you have special things in your heart we just want to remember all these things in prayer we just want to ask that my God's grace that peace could sweep over especially in the Twin Cities area and it just hasn't it's gonna have to take God and be able to do that so Amon

we appreciate you Jesus your precious name we pray Amy praise the Lord thank you Father Saints I just wanted to say something Oh Lord you know as we began to sing that song in the presence of Jehovah I wasn't on the list today but I believe it was on his list there was the answer states of God for whatever situation that we're in smaller green the song says troubles vanish and our term ended in the presence of the king we just we just want to be in his presence this morning as Aaron's rod it was a dry old stick but when I went into its presence it came to life amen it brought forth fruit and so as we dwell in his presence will bring forth his fruit and we can take that presence with us wherever we go and it could cause troubles to vanish and hearts to be mended it's Jesus Christ and I just was thinking about as our brother was talking and praying how the scripture says I thank God upon every remembrance of you each and every one of you and I'm just so grateful to be your brother and I just say God richly bless each and every one of you I love you all and I just appreciate all of you so much and it's oh there's only one color that we're concerned about and it's it's blood-red his shed blood of Reason saints of God but I'm so grateful and I'm so thankful upon every remembrance of you and so amen as we're apart I just want you to continue to pray for me and I'll be praying for you too thank you thankful for brother Monty I know I've broken every rule that the governor said but I love my brother I love you and I just appreciate for the blotting let's just remember to pray for him in these times as the pastor amen that the Lord has a special a special thing for him to do being called into that ministry let's just remember him in prayer - god bless you a since there is I mean there is no way we can over emphasize of how much we are grateful to the Lord for happiness as a body every time time and time again he comes in in a very simple way he Benny Kate his presence among a saying and that is and that's all that matters you know what people saying what people think does not matter is what God is doing so we thank the Lord for everything that His grace is doing for us and during this time of lockdown short distance and everything we've been having our services this way and I'm telling you the Lord has been so mindful of us I mean he has come bad I was even thinking about Wednesday service even though the audio was a little bit rough I spoke to brother Prater and and just appreciate him fo for I'm standing in the gap to help us but I was thinking about it you know what is what is the odd that I mean we've been staring from the book of Acts and labral Peter cam right there reading from our chapter 13 and I'm going to am stay continually in mind you know mine my series on the continuation of the book of ads and I was just thinking there as soon as I heard what he was reading from the I was just enough for me to know that you know God was in it all and you know once again we I mean it was it was beyond our control the technicians they did everything you know but prayer even invited some of his people to the church and they're also you know I was thinking about it and I just said lord I will be merciful if we will sit down and complain about the volume and and what of you I don't know what it is really the volume we need we need I mean we need a voice of God we need the Holy Spirit to be able to help us because it's just one word from God that is enough to change our life and you know and then sometimes as human we get first aid you know and we get mixed feeling you know I can't even get this thing I don't even know what's going on and we don't even know I mean the kind of work and effort that is put behind the scenes to have all of these things going on praise the Lord and I just I just pray that the law will be able to help us we have to be spiritual minded in such a time that we are living I mean things are happening the world is changing in such a way that if we are kind of man that we will never be able to catch with a lot of the changes around us I mean there are a lot of things that are happening you know the lead has been taken out of hell they are demon spirits that are streaming out true through the earth I mean in every way shape and form so if you are not prayer for if you are not you know keeping yourself in the presence of Jehovah if you are there - keeping yourself under the blood I'm telling you the devil is going to nail your face Neil your ears you know when the all your eyes and I mean he's just planning to do the most weakest thing that he can do because the scripture says he know his time is short amen and we also know after the seven injured message that time is normal you know so let's let's put importance on the things that is important whether the service is two minutes long if it is just two minutes I mean the light can shut off right now and you listening to me I mean your computer can go off and I mean also some things can happen who are you going to blame are you going to say I don't know what they're doing down there I mean that just a kind of way to behave we must be beyond that because I don't know how many of us gathered together in our home and pray 30 minutes before you even turn your computer on I mean just to sit down as a family hold one another hand and say Lord we are about to stream the service this morning just just bless bless the service Lord bless our brothers and sisters some people just wait for 10 I mean 11 o'clock and then we turned a computer on the ready to get in the spirit there is no way we would get in the spirit that way if we are not praying we are not preparing ourselves the devil is he is against this very thing that we are doing we must know that we are using his media that's the fourth dimension science is the fourth dimension where Andrews will tell you there are hackers that are trying to break into our website he's at his house he's following the service you know and he's kicking hackers from from out of our website in all sorts of things I mean these brothers they are doing everything to be able to serve us so let us not sit down in our home and have attitude let us not allow the things that are happening in the street to give us attitude we are Christians we are believers and we must remain believers the Lord bless you this morning amen and once again like I said let's pray for the work at the church we just wanted to bring you that SHOP video so you can see there is no way you can get back in church now with all of those ladders you know there I don't want claim on a ladder to preach I want a pulpit to preach so let's pray for the Manning enemy you I mean you can just hold to that promise in the book of Psalm Lord unless you build the house the workers that builder ability in vain that was just a consolation to me this morning so Allah bless you let's stand on our feet First Samuel chapter 16 and we will read the Word of God I love you all this morning I mean you have to realize that I'm not coming against anybody that's a spirit out there that's what I'm blasting this morning so first samuel chapter 16 what mary go be self amen he is faithful he's a faithful God for samuel chapter 16 my goodness i'm hope raining this morning believing that the law will be able to to just help us and the Lord said unto Samuel am i in first Samir okay praise the Lord the Lord said unto Samuel how long will their moon for so seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel failed a horn with art and go I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehem IDE I have provided me a king among his sons now this is a beautiful structure have your seat let's read it because I what there is there's a principle that I want for us to catch so I want to take my time I want you know I'm gonna give you the comfort of your seat I would do the standing for you and Sam you said how can I go if so year if he will kill me and the Lord said take and have fun with thee and say I am calm to sacrifice to the Lord what a great wisdom our god of wisdom you know he's he scenes that Sam you you know God is Ned you know he he just don't do things like us you know you would just think that well he's God I should Sam you be afraid of saw in a way he's a prophet you know he's you just stand down there if so I can't you're blind his eyes you know God don't work that way he works with a lot of wisdom you know he says well you take a knife or go and make a sacrifice and call Jessa verse 3 to the sacrifice and I will show thee what thou shalt do now seeing God is instructing Samuel but not giving him the full picture while you are walking in the light I will unfold I will show you what you would do I'm not telling you everything where Ben says God don't tell his prophets everything they have to walk by faith God don't tell his children everything there are things that we have to walk by faith aiming so let's just enjoy the Word of God name and I was show thee what thou shalt do ender sure I know it unto me him woo I mean on today which means God have not told him that yet you go by faith I will show you what you have to do and one that I have mean you will annoyed King and Samuel did that wish the Lord speak and came to Bethlehem and the address of the town tremble at his coming because you know every time the prophet comes to time he's bringing the word of the Lord and said come Adel pizza blade and he said peaceably I come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourself and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice for his Lord but now notice here let's note this Jesse and his sons but David was not there David was not there the scripture will let us know that and and the scripture says now this is what I want us to wash this principle the Bible says and it came to pass when they were come that he looked at ELab and said surely now who is looking this time Samuel he says surely the laws I noted is before him now so let me bring out you know a picture here so you will see when God to Samuel to do this he was afraid so there is an element of fear in him he want to do it quickly and get out of it so that element of fear is now moving him to see this this is the guy I want to do this quickly and get out of here praise the Lord now watch this other principle but the Lord said unto Samuel look net on his countenance all on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the law serious net as main theory for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart now whose hat that's another principle we have to look at who's hot now you have to realize that right there God is dealing with Samuel so God is also telling Samuel dead I'm not going to use your eyes I'm going to convict your heart praise the Lord because Samuel is the one that God is dealing with now most of the time the scripture is stink too we think about it as the one that is going to be anointed it's true that God is also looking at the heart of the one that is going to be anointed but he's also dealing with the heart of the one that is doing the work because the Bible says here if you go back the Lord said unto Samuel look mad at his countenance don't use your eyes don't look at his height don't look at his size I'm going to deal with your heart when the man comes on the scene I would convict you that this is the man are we together and I think you know the rest of the story Amy and if you don't know you can read the rest of the story as chapter 1 let's go - I was tricked her in the book of Acts yeah we're going to read a little bit about the replacing of Judas that's the reason why I set a trap here and put you right in it now I get to I'm going to nail you this morning Amy oh man I just love when the people are pulling and you just get their attention praise the Lord as chapter 1 we continue in the book of Acts let's read verse 15 in those days Peters - up in the myth of the disciple and said the number of names together were about 120 men and Bradley's Peter speaking the scripture must me be must need have been fulfilled wish the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David speak before concerning Judas which was God to them that took Jesus for he was numbered with us and have attained part of this ministry now this man touches a feel wave the reward of iniquity and fall in hell on he brushed asunder in the mists and all his bowels gushed out and it is known unto all that dwelleth at jerusalem in so much as the field is called in the a proper tongue I kept Dhamma that is to say the feet of blood for it is written in the book of Sam let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell it the aim in his bishop read let another take praise the Lord Amen wherefore of this man we have company with us all the time that the law jesus went in and out among us now so this is giving us a record that all of these men that they are going to choose they are not just men that have just come in they have been there all this one it's just that there were none number among the twelve you know so Luke is giving us this report as well you know that this man there has been all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us beginning from the baptism of John see how far this man has been around you know from the bustling of John Anto onto that same day there he was taken up from us most must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection and and they appointed to Joseph called Bathsheba's who was so named Justus and Matthias and they prayed and said thou Lord we should know the heart of all men sure whether of these two thou have chosen that he may take part of this ministry and Apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell there he might go to his own place and give for the a lot and a lot of hair on my tears and he was numbered with the eleven a posture that way nursing the first chapter of the book of Acts there made a law our blessing upon His Word will go right into this subject I will start by saying I thought about it last night this morning as well I mean as I was meditating on the subject staring through the week I said to myself what could have happened if their postures just waited a little longer Pentecost was coming the Holy Ghost was coming they are making a divine choice without the Holy Ghost but brother branham is now going to show us how God will step back when the people make a choice God will be obligated just like he did to solve when the people choose salt as a king he told Samuel forget about it it is not you they have rejected it's me go and annoy Saul you know he told Simon you know you know it is all on the basis of this principle that brother Branham says God would support the choice of the majority it does not definitely mean that it is his choice but when the people choose to do that God would stand behind it and along the way he will vindicate that it was their choice and it was not his choice the same with Saul and David the sin we will see here with my tears and Paul praise the Lord but I was thinking about it and you know just like we're air from the scripture Haman's will always be him on there is something about our nature that is that God just enjoyed when he finds us to be the way we are once again Peter the father man the Bible see Peters to up that solve this problem he's always the forward guy he stood up Menem reveries man I can I can't imagine that Judas did this to us I've been reading the scripture I call into the scripture and I told you every time we come across daddy in the Bible I call into the scripture we must go back and find that structure it is our obligated Jesus says search the scripture so Peter were referring to Psalm chapter 69 you go back and read some chapter 69 you will see the promise that he was referring to there amen so and few our assignment in Psalm chapter follow one also he was he was one of those prophets is I India now so I'm just thinking about it is all my goodness Peter amen he stood up and wanted bread and she says let's solve this problem I just read in the book of Sam somebody have to take his place and all of these men being up there being with us they are all good man and the Bible says they prayed they did what they know was the right thing to do they did the best to the UM knowledge praise the Lord Amen I just feel like closing my Bible just leave you in suspense and you can just solve the rest [Laughter] praise the Lord you know just a little prayer meeting this morning we have had a helped me in a lot I mean to be able to break out of out of everything and just go right into his presence it's just a sweet thing to be in the presence of the Lord amen it sees all the human struggle you know all the human struggle when we get right into the presence of the Lord but let me show you something yes we continue to study the book of Acts let's go to Matthew chapter 1 Matthew chapter 1 as we continue to study the book of Acts all praise the Lord amen Matthew chapter 1 verse 1 says the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the Son of David the son of Abraham there's we'll have the book starts with us then I won't want to take much of my time you know to be able to to go through all this verse 17 says so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations and from David until they carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generation praise the Lord and as you as you read much you introduction there was something I wanted we went over this before I can remember that but I just want to catch you on something here as you read my two introduction he comes in and he talks after talking about a generation the birth of Jesus Christ was on this why's he talks about Joseph and Mary and and and but you will realize that much you he's not going into into a lot of lot of other details here and then I mean he talks about you know the angel visit and then over into verse 2 chapter two he starts wave now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King he talks about Herod the King behold they came wise men from the east to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews so where I want to grab you here my true introduction of Jesus Christ is to present him as a king so he started talking about David David was a king he started talking about Abraham in some sense Abraham was a king over his people even though the title of kingship was not given but he was a leader now so matthew is anointed he's honored this anointing to introduce Jesus Christ as the king praise the Lord mark chapter one the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God as it is written in the prophet behold say my messenger before my face we shall prepare the way before thee the voice of the voice of one crying in the wilderness we know that this is John the Baptist and he comes with John the Baptist you know year John being the prophet and his ministry starting here right at the River Jordan you know he comes up talking about John in Candis Cayne and you know preaching at the River Jordan and he's saying behold the kingdom of heaven is a hint so he introduced John yeah as the priests with a ministry you know in a setting of this new tabernacle or this new kid 'm or this new you know other and then right into chapter 2 chapter 2 you know john mack in his gospel here starts to speak out and pretty soon he goes right into the baptism of jesus so mark the anointing that is all mark is to present Jesus as a sacrifice because John is the priest and the sacrifice must be watch before it before it can be offered so Matthew is honored the anointing of the lion because lion is the king and mark is under the anointing of an ox because there's the sacrificial nature or the sacrificial anointing so right away he starts his introduction lay by the holy spirit to be able to go right to Jesus being watch before he goes right into his into his ministry praise the Lord Luke chapter 1 I know you you finish getting when I'm growing that's okay and relax I'm not never because I want you to get me so if you get me that's fine you mean now we see here a series loop now all of the mass anointing he's going to go into so much detail so much detail and he's going to bring different human characters into the birth of Jesus he was the one that said how Jesus grew in stature getting favor with God and man he's he's keeping the main part of Jesus when brother Branham says he hundred percent God and he's hundred percent man Luke is keeping that part he's showing us that this is a man talking about Jesus being in a captain to shop as a ball Luke is the one that is bringing up all of those him apart of Jesus not that man that ball growing to the time where he would get into his ministry so you see Luke in his presentation of his report of his gospel he having so much information that's not much you might you straight to the the the generation of Jesus Christ coming from Abraham the king I mean David going through the lineage and he's dealing with the kingship and he comes right in there and he says in a time of Herod the King King of the Jews that's the anointing his honor God and nor to him for that sin chapter one when John comes with his owner report he said in the beginning was the word he flew right back to the beginning where about him say his honor that Eagle anointing he can go right back to the beginning are we together so in the gust in in the book of us the reason why I'm bringing this out is because in the books of in the book of Acts we would get to see this anointing place out praise the Lord we will see this anointing the kingdom is now birth the king is taking part of the people's heart some of them will be killed they will be sacrificed they will be whipped but he will be using him as you'll be using common people and right in the midst of their poor will rise up with great understanding in Revelation so it's all the force anointing playing out right in the book of Acts because when we talk about the book of Acts and we talked about the Holy Ghost among the people sometimes we just think in the Eagles anointing we just won the miracles we won the healing we won't order that we don't look at the sacrifice Peter and John being whipped they are partaking of his suffering are we together praise the Lord Revelation chapter 4 but branches this year the mercy seat nothing could come anywhere around around it without crossing those tribes he's talking about the mercy seat in the Old Testament how when the tabernacle was Bill the twelve tribes were divided on the fourth side of the tabernacle so he's bringing their over now to a book of arts that's so that's what he's going crossing what the lion crossing the man he says nothing nothing who come anywhere around the mercy without dealing with one of these anointing prays alone no no wish no no way the enemy come God has a protection on one side if he does not use the anointing of a preacher he would bless a man with wisdom to be able to deal with their situation so no way how the enemy comes if he comes as a Scarlet God would give us the right word in the scripture to stay if he comes as you know whichever way he comes us you know we they are noting this year to D him so brother Branham says there is no way he can come with our cross in one of them he had to cross the lion crossing the man's intelligence the intelligence of a man crossing the the work hers as an ox or crossing the ego the the swiftness of eight seed the heaven the earth in between and all around you see they will gather so this anointing are represented in heaven they are represented in heavenly places this anointing is also represented on earth that is the reason why the the the minister in the book of us are lacking on two angels with Flemish walls because they are there to God the people they are there told to protect the people or protect the church or protect emergency praise the Lord and that is the reason why if a man does that with a selfish desire he ruins the plain of God amen are we together so he says the heavens the earth in between in an order round you see we're gathered and above it was the pillar of fire brother not in touchdown mercy without the approach without meeting one of these praise the Lord that's the reason why God gave ministry to the church that's the reason why God gave a husband to a family his work is to protect provide for seeds that's God's order are we together now he says him the gospel guy to back up the book of Acts that was wrote the gospel is a guide to back up the book of Acts and that is the reason why we show these four anointings in the beginning in the introduction honor honor the anointing that all these apostles were when they gear because the book of us is coming God would start dealing people and these four anointings is going to be around the book on the days of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came it was Christ the King taking the throne on the hearts of his people so the Holy Ghost the birth of the Holy Ghost is God taking his true his resident in your heart because he's king of kings and Lord of lords he don't want no man sitting on your heart he don't want a man idea sitting on your heart he want to be Lord of your life and that's the reason why the book of us game with the day of Pentecost and I mean we can just go and then 3,000 was added in the midst of those 3,000 and miss motors who came in and all of that we would deal with that as we go along but the gospel God to back of the book of Acts water rose now I heard a great teacher bourbon I'm talking years is now long ago a great man fine man met met him shook his hand a fine brother he said but the book of Acts of the Apostles is just a framework for the church hmm in other words he had a framework out here when the book of the the ass of the Apostle was inside and this gospel the framework to hold it together and protect it that is the reason why Luke started with his introduction the things that Jesus began to do he's continuing the things that he began to do in his ministry he's now continuing in the form of the Holy Ghost so it's a continuation see how the mind of a man can do anything I did taught the same thing if it wasn't for him where Bam's is if God did not happen he would be thinking the same thing he says the framework Pentecost wasn't the framework of the gospel the four gospel are the framework to back Pentecost after they had this framework of Pentecost be come into existence he say is that right which was Ruth first he says the book of Acts of the Apostles the book of ads or the the gospel of the Apostles I mean the Apostle he says Jesus walked along doing the work and forgetting what who come and Matthew Mark Luke and John then four guys comes and was writing everything they'd seen coming to pass telling it just like it is how it was going to happen what was going to take place then all at once they frame it around and year it comes a me and Matthew Mark Luke and John is the framework all the God work that protects the mean temple the truth the Pentecost of blessing because over there in John he promised the comforter in the Book of Luke he says that when when when the Holy Spirit comes you will get understanding of these things that are that I'm telling you that's why he spoke to those men on a road of a Meijer you know and in all the promises there so what was he pointing tone he was pointing to the Pentecostal blessing there in John he says out of your belly will flow rivers of water this he spoke of the Holy Ghost to come when even he resurrected at the end of the book of John the Bible said when he appeared unto them he said peace be on to you Shalom he says a receive here the Holy Ghost he pointing them to the pentecostal blessing giving the protection that this thing is going to come praise the Lord oh man is yes it just so wonderful point you to the Pentecostal blessing amen so we see here how that you know God use all of these men in their report I mean give them different anointing that's the reason why the kind of mind can jump right in there and says all my to you is contract dating Luke law they are not contract getting each one of them are on a different anointing they are doing different work they are presenting a Christ honor dia anointing what a beautiful thing here amen and here is it the Pentecostal blessing has not come I love the way brother Branham say this in Fr the Lord can just help us to just stay right in there you will enjoy there let's look at the word made flesh in in trip report he's coming to get on this thing here let's look at their come to get to our so Janelle he said Paul was net an apostille I call him to the twelve Paul was not an apostle calling to the two of Galatians chapter 1 let's read there let's read the Galatians chapter 1 Paul himself testified amen of death Colossians chapter 1 that should be verse 1 praise the Lord okay yeah poor Donna pasta net of man neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead so we realize here they are poor a pasta shape it was now voted upon i mean but we have to remember the other apostles like matthew he was behind his tax collected eggs counting money when jesus passed by they make eye contact and he said follow me Jesus called him in he left his his his you know tax collecting working he went into the ministry Peter the scene and in all of this man they got a call from God from the Lord Jesus the same rapport he got a call but this time it was not in a body form Jesus met him on the road of Damascus praise the Lord Jesus met him on the row of Damascus but his calling was not liked at all because the two of their calling was in the fleshly Ministry of Jesus Christ Paul Collin was in the spiritual ministry of Jesus Christ through the form of the Holy Ghost let's continue to read him he says Paul was not an apostle according to the twelve but did you ever notice they choose materials I believe it was to take Judas place and that's what means done never heard no more of him but God choose Paul to take his place you see and look what Paul did now this is what I want to grab you attention he said see to assure the difference between the choosing of man and the choosing of God amen watch this also now and and that makes he says it gave me a lot of Grace in Mahon butter bread I'm saying this now looking at what took place in the book of God he said it gave me a lot of grace in my heart to wash things even errors and so far so it shows that when we make choices and we and and we come to realize that we make arrow is stretched your grace because let Peter and those men right there they're making a choice on divine scripture Peter is taking the scripture he's taking the the book of Sam he's proving it is written in the book of Sam and not a man should take his place he's bringing all these coats to prove his point and the Bible says after he did that the brothers were convinced they all went to praying they were not they were not just doing things they were trying to follow the scripture in as much as the norm but brother Branham said he says he says and then give me a lot of Grace in my heart to wash things in arrow in a sense verbatim is saying even if I make arrow a giving grace in my heart to know that I was trying to do everything according to the scripture praise the Lord I mean people that want to find our brother brems share this and where bands say this and ever came to point here that pages from your Bible because this man they made an error the first thing there was that Jesus told them to wait until tyree until he received power the power was the Holy Ghost to instruct them but they did this before even the whole goes king that is the first thing that made this choice even before they received the Holy Ghost Oh what can we accept ourself to be humans that grace her safe what should we think that we are angels and we are call never to make mistakes grace has saved us that when we make mistakes we can come back to that same grace and say how mercy he says it gave me lot of grace in my heart two worst things it gave me a lot of grace Emma had to wash people Oh just one there to suck down let me drink water I may go down when I drink but I want you to think about it when we can't find grace in our hand when we can realize that grace have brought us to where we are and we are just so easy to kick other people out of the kingdom we so easy to condemn other people because we are just in their self-righteous mind we're Banshee it gave me a lot of grace he says seeing this it gave me a lot of grace in my heart to wash things and arrows and so far that's the reason why we we appreciate this man ministry because when brother Branham see it in the word he admits to it it gave me a lot of grace seeing this it gave me grace to be patient with people when a brother comes up and preaches salmon and then I mean he just get the scripture makes why come there and says you know what it's a wrong spirit you you said John when it's supposed to be peated give grace let's people grow now the problem there is that if the man is arrogant about it then we know it's a wrong spirit but we give grace sometimes the preacher was sit back he would see things and then people just well why is he lying Teasdale is so happy why is he lying things that is so happening I said to say you never did things that should not happen he says it gave me a lot of grace in my heart towards things and arrows arrows he brought our errors a gaming grace to be able to deal with errors in so it shows the difference between the chosen of man and the choosing of God God would yeah I mean there there are things that God would not choose for us he has given us his word so we can stand on the basis of his word by faith to make choices I'm praying for God to truth he's not going to choose for you he gave you his word you must be his son and his daughter learn his word learn what the Word of God says and use that principle in making your choice and after you have done everything that you know right to do and you still make the right choice there is still grace and there is room other autre my goodness I feel I just running down this street but a Jordan your dogs might get behind me praise the Lord oh man this thing just it just captured my spirit say Oh God teach my heart Lord to see grace give me grace press Roy Amy I mean this just this army takes the weapon takes all the bullet out and just threw on the ground just need an answer Lord that's Serrano praise the Lord it gave me a lot of grace I just came fast this is just just holding me so strong gave me a lot of grace in my heart to be able to deal with things you trust in the Lord you want God to move in you want God to help you are biting your tongue says I wanna walking this seed and I'll status in every way it's in every way you know sometimes you just you look daddy so my goodness you know yeah I wish the Deacons would do this but then it gives you a lot of Grace in your heart he says well pray the Lord we help them to grow in their praise hello let's move on let's move on the Lord is going to help us Amy and he's going to help us he has promised he would never fail amen he has promised he will never fail and we can believe that he will keep his word every way every step of the way amen but this this was this was a major thing major thing major thing in the beginning of the church and one thing also that I was that was principal these guys that were not using their mind we're not using their idea they were proving things by the scripture they were flipping through the scripture Jesus have told them to search the scripture I believe Peter was reading the book of Sam and when he came across that let's read Psalm chapter 69 I hope I'm I'm right with that I think so I read it last night let's go by let's just read Psalm chapter 69 it's just one of the one of those timeless and I was reading and I mean the picture is just so okay read from verse 20 let's look at year that's the Spirit of Christ speaking out here reproach has has broken my heart and I'm full of heaviness Jesus right in that I mean David prophesied Jesus right there in the Garden of Gethsemane he says I look for some to take pity and there was none other those disciples sleeping pray with me one hour they are all sleeping and the comforters but I found that okay let's just go ahead now they give me also God for meat and in matters they gave me vinegar to drink let their tables become a snail before them and that wish to have been for their welfare let it become a trap let let their eyes be docking speaking about those Jews his coming was supposed to be for their welfare let the eyes be docking that they see not and the layers continue to shake pour out that indignation upon them and let the rightful anger take hold of them let their habitation be desolate and let non dirt in the attaint and he's going on and on and on so you see David right here on the on the dis anointing he goes ahead and then for the persecute him whom thou hast met him and did any talk to grieve of those whom thou has wounded and iniquity unto the iniquity and let him not come into thy righteousness let them be blotted out of the book of the living and net be reading with the righteous just on and on on and on you go back to the beginning you see there but this was were David I mean Peter was reading true I mean just read him flipping through the Sun you know and looking at the scripture you go to Psalms chapter 4 the one also some of the prophecy is right there and I think someone 100 something also I was telling there last night and but you realize him that they are not just they are not just looking this is net on the ground of favoritism they are trying to do everything to stay in line with the Word of God they have these two men after looking at everything and looking at the repetition of this men of all the men's that were they the broad is two guys for justice and and my tears I mean just for the two men that you could find that are fit in that place and that is now a favorite hazing it's not on tribal lines it's not on national line they are using the scripture they are doing their best because they want God to be in this thing praise the Lord they are doing their best oh my goodness let me see you see what blood-brain says here Hebrew chapter 3 he says when Judah fell by transgression by the loss of money and the pride of life he fell from grace and went to his place and the disciple said there must be 12 he says in the church with all of his dignity to show you what the church is with all of his dignity and all of his power is still a million my shot at it's very best that's what we need a grist of God we can we can put our hands with coats brother and said a brother and said that the Bible said a brother we are male your minds if God don't help us that's that's the reason why I you know I don't I don't stop people from coming to meet me and discussing subject you know I'm telling me how you feel and what we should do and you know what you think is best in them and in order there but we have to pray about it you have to pray you know sometimes we all like to be that one sheep you know the 99 must be left and only you but sometimes you must get in the 99 and wait for the one to be God because if you come to service and the service don't speak to you or the song leader I don't know why he was singing there and this they're just in in the 1990 you were not the one that I'm song was going after stay in the 1990 patient we all want the attention we all want to be the one that is just electrified by the preaching all yoyoyo still trying to be in the 99 and help the holy spirit to go after one person if the salmon is not appealing till you say Lord Jesus I know you speaking to somebody and whoever you going after because some people that yeah just so filled with the mystery I mean they Atlanta all the Scriptures they get all the cost like machine gun the moment you said there's the bring one out you said that sort of one they bring one are they are just dead I mean they are all audible he missed you know this code supposed to 1963 supposed to come before 1965 they are just all in this place when the Holy Spirit is just laboring to get a young person to come to the reality no we must be in the mistress we must be we must be fire up like like a July 4th with all the crackers growing all over the place Amelia Mize the church with all of its power a million lies away he says at its very best tell you I'm telling you better scared I'm telling you that's what grace comes in that's what grace comes in and we appreciate the little things that are happening if we just rely on our effort how are we ever coming up Emelia Minds if we don't encourage one another how will we ever cover up people comparing this assembly does this this way this assembly does this this way just leave us the way we are we already know we I'm ileum eyes so what we're doing we're just holding one another hands we holy one another here we're going to make it better Steve let's just go we're going to make it we already know me a million miles away oh I just love the Lord this morning my goodness whoa praise the Lord that's the place where we get to we encourage one another you see a brother making it to service or the system making it to 7:00 getting anxious it god bless you from the heart give them an embrace we just down and we line everything out to us now we we got there praise the Lord oh my the church with all this dignitary show you what the church is with all his dignity and all his power is still a million my shot at its very best they said we have got to look out one among us who will take the place I just don't like going into some things here but I just pray that law would just we just help those brothers I mean let me let me stay right here let me just a right to you praise the Lord he says in in the truth by casting love my tear I believe it he says I believe it and whatever they are whenever they choose him and put him with the twelve with the eleven which made up the twelve he did not do one thing now it does not miss that he backsliding but the thing about it there is that God that's that's where Birmingham is drawing it from the Holy Spirit didnêt bring up things materials there what what he what he knew he could do but Holy Spirit did not highlighted on things that he did just so he can bring us to this place to realize that the man for the job was Paul and Bob Arum says how can you think about let just read this before we close this thing up here because I could just go on with this thing the rest of my life realizing I'm a million my why not keep preaching this praise the Lord my goodness appreciate the rest of my life still not catch up he says in and he says that's the only time his name was ever mentioned in the scripture that was the choice that the church making his choice he says and they taught he's a gentleman no doubt oh we love the way he carried himself his necktie is always straight he's a wonderful man he's a scarlet he's smart he's educated and I was reading some commentary and I was with brother Brahim saying this thing that was a very thing just commentary said that my tears was a scarlet you know so a scholar for him to recognize Jesus ministry it was it was it was it was attracted to this disciple this man was a scarlet he knew the straw just like Nicodemus so for him for him being a scour to leave the sealing gas and be following this disciple to all their house meeting it will appeal it appealed to the disciple that this man is an honorable man or not not somebody like Jairus what would come to the evening Saracen in the morning he goes to the synagogue until his daughter died before he really decided to take a stand but this man was an honorable man he was a scarlet he knew the Lord when he saw him when he when he told him this is the sign of the Messiah he just went to one meeting and he saw Jesus calling people by name he said my goodness this is what we've been reading this is what we've been studying this is the word right there he left he left the Sanhedrin Council he started following these disciples they were meeting at the lake he was there he didn't care what kind of I said about him he was an honorable man amen he's a wonderful person he would take the place of Judas and be one of us the Bible said from the from the baptism of John for the time Jesus ascended this man they were there these are the kind of a man I was not missing service they were not so busy with their business meeting that a Quaker every time they were meeting they would make sure they'd be there on time man that are honorable that's what that's what we have been taught by the scripture to look for oh but you just see something yeah this will blow your mind but you know God sometimes I love the advances God sometimes makes to our opinion some of the most foolish choice that's that's what our opinion would be he says now God seen a little hook no Jews just as full of tempo oh my he's leaving the Honorable man in his career for a man with temple my good night is talking about his Christian love for just cracking his teeth you know give me one minute let me see something I need a people I can like these guys up God's choice a man of temper he says oh my goodness me praise the Lord he meant no one ago had to blind his eyes first before before because I mean what were your temper do for you if you are blind what would temper do for poor he want to go and arrest those Kristen he already blind so what would his temper do God has to blind him bring him in a most horrible state for him to seek God get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that he could have patience he could have such a heart when he saw feldman in jail you know as I said I'll send you back to your to your master or an insolence when he saw in jail he could have patience he got there to the Corinthian church and saw that this order but he still have patience God took that temper away that's why the Holy Ghost would do a mayor for up-tempo with with his off setting aside where Brandon just come up with all of these things he got a hook nose and his mouth twisted when he's talking he saw angry intent his mouth his twisted can't even pronounce it's worse because he saw her hungry he got his fish out this pressure is mild twisted and his loss hanging away my goodness I don't know where he get these things from but it's just edify us when we read in prison just showing you God's choice praise Allah oh man praise the Lord my goodness I will go down in there and arrest every one of them talking with his mouth twisted now throw them in jail I mean he's so angry don't tell that the emotion is affecting his body but bird benches that was God's choice amen the rest of them the church the man they took the scholar they took the diplomat you know but God's choice was different he says see you don't know who's that at the altar now he's getting our attention when you see the man weeping or you see a woman crying out to God you don't know who is a daughter sometimes we sit in the pew and we're just looking over our shoulder to be judging people you don't know who is that person you don't know where they have been and you don't know what God is doing in their life a person standing up and testifying you don't know where they have been sit down with chewing gum and your mama you not even supposed to be chewing in church cracking gums and yes your mind is just all over that place he says you don't know that person at the altar amen you know I was reading this I'm telling you but I'm talking all of this and you know he talking about his ear broke down ski eyes skinned up I was just thinking in my mind what if a man comes to church you know or a woman they have all of these Ryan years they have both their ears because they were I mean they they're they were honoring wrong influence and God is dealing with you have what will be your attitude what would be your attitude you could sit right in the presence of God and be so judgmental because that person come with you know with the hanging ears but brother Brennan says you don't know that person you don't know what God is doing in your life for God's sake the best you can do is by your health and prayed that's the reason why we don't we don't even give them a chance because we see their hair all green or blue over we just we just send them in we just let the fire on them we just take the match and just let fire on them that let them just burn we don't even give them a chance but you don't know who that is you just cast your law that's all give give him the word you don't know who is there just cast you a lot give him the word just say God bless you see what how they will respond just say God bless you see how that person is going to respond I remember I remember a brother in in Indiana he tells us his testimony and how he gave his how to the Lord and how he believed the message just to get in the church and I experienced there two years back assisted I used to come to our church you know just to come he was just visiting the church that day then and it was just greeting one another you know shaking god bless you brother god bless you brother he said he never felt a we're coming spirit for somebody that he don't know to call him brother and give him an embrace that's how he came the next time and that's how he came the next time and that's how he gave his heart to the Lord got baptized and serving the Lord just from one visit and somebody just say god bless you brother maybe the brother said I even know it's a visitor the man there in church and said god bless you brother give me a give him and give him an embrace he said that think wash his heart somebody will call him brother the scripture says by one blood by one blood God save oh man robear's is called choice God choose this little heart temple juice and choose him rather on his role then I will go down and get him I will show them what I can do like that and God just knock him down God said that's my choice that's right wouldn't there be foolish to the church
