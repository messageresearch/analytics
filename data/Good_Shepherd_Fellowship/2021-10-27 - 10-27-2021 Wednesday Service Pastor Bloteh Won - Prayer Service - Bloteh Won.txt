verse behold bless ye the lord all ye servants of the lord wish by night stand in the house of the lord lift up your hands in his century and bless the lord the lord that made the heaven and the earth bless thee out of zion praise the lord now this psalm used to be a prayer warrior psalm when we used to stay up all night to pray that's when we read this sign because we're positioning ourselves for work for warfare praise the lord they that stand in the house of the lord stand by night in the house of the lord praise the lord amen so we just want to thank the lord we greet you again in the name of the lord jesus if you want to take your seat or you want to get on your knees to pray but let's have our city in a little bit before we we just spent a little time to pray tonight i was really going to have this service to be a prayer service and we just spent time in praying and praying for the different needs that are in our midst but before we say that just like many of you that came through tonight you realize that the deacons are encouraging us to go back and start using our hand sanitizer and and those that you know want to use max you are also welcome to use max uh on sunday our brother jordy might be able to bring us some few things to talk to us about you know some of the few things that we we realized that we are experiencing whether is the change of the weather whether it is we know we kovic has not gone yet we stay having it because uh uh brother wesley and sister cara we've been praying for them brother wesley talked to him this morning he went to get tested he's tested with kovic you know when praying for his dear wife since since i heard it they're not being well that just i just kind of have been losing sleep out of that you know that that the law would just be able to be able to bring them through from there talk to sister kelly also she also went and got tested and and she also is down with the virus so we want to pray she and brother steve they are quarantining their self you know and all of that is the time that we are living in praise the lord amen is a time that we are living in yeah we will we will keep going in and out with this you know everyone everyone that has to go to work we still go to work we still go to the grocery store you know it's almost like jesus said yeah in this world but you are not part of this world praise the lord a man kovac is here but kovic is not part of us but we will rub arms with kovac amen and i won't see the wine so uh we want to go back and and and get back to our health guidance and things that we did you have to remember that we have such uh a small space okay we have such a uh a small space and and then all of that so we just want to encourage you when you come through the door you know all of those things standing down there with anybody to just be decoration or furniture they are bought to be used don't feel bad if you think you are using all you know uh there's just no way you can bathe with it so just clean your hands when you go out you come in you know we stay uh shake hands with one another we stay embrace one another so let's let's make it a habit praise the lord we are doing the best and we will leave the lord to do the rest but let's do our part and and just because of you know all the different you know uh uh uh family and different things that have been sick uh uh we just thought that we would spend a time to to pray tonight uh we have brother brother thomas fed he actually flew into to be with brother paul this weekend but they don't have uh uh they don't have uh wednesday service so uh but he called me while he was coming into the twin city and i did not know that we would be in a situation like this but when i spoke to him i told him i'm not very sure because my mind was just going in many different directions and whether we should cancel the wednesday service and all of that but then as i was thinking about it and praying about it my my question is how many times in a year will we when we cancel service praise the lord and and and even at a time where we cancel service and stay at home you know uh uh you will find yourself just going back to regular things if you just stay home on wednesday night if there was no service dream tonight you would just go back to regular things praise the lord now one man come together tonight and just put our house before the lord and pray for one another and pray for those that are sick and just ask the lord lord live this thing from over our assembling leave these things from us praise the lord amen so uh [Music] most especially we have we have a good number of the things that comes to this assembly that work you know in the healthy you know hospital clinics nursing home group homes and all of that we we need to pray that the law will keep them safe you know they are all out there dealing with working with people that are in different conditions so uh so i just want us to go to the lord in prayer tonight and we just prayed and remember all of these different ones brother hillary sent me a text just before the service tonight and i think he and his family went down over to the urgent care i think they want to get tested and all of that that's a good thing to do if you if you if you you want to do that just to get uh doubts from over your mind and we all know uh we we taught ourselves that we're not going to play any spiritual giant we're not going to play any you know [Music] any kind of spirituality with base yeah we believe the word we believe the lord is still

each one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ i'm very very grateful to just come the way of my friend again but indeed there is nothing that happened without a cause god knows why i have to come this way this time although my friend was thinking oh there's no opportunity to maybe to preach but uh it is prayer meeting but it's good that i'm here also to join you in praying so all things working for good and i love the lord so we appreciate and i believe that when it is time of mourning we mourn together yeah and when it's time of joy we rejoice together so i'm here to join you and then we just take the petition to the lord jesus christ bro one has been a good friend some of you the old folks maybe you know my face i was with you in one of your meetings your convention and i have really visited him and then the second time i think i could not really preach he just put me at the hotel and he sent me away and being a very good friend and this time also he has received me again just to come and fellowship with you in this prayer meeting and we believe that lord will answer us okay just to exalt you with some calls and some bible so that we go into the prayer [Music] problem was saying something here in the province word he said and let those that have prayer card stand for prayer now as universal we pray for the people now we want you to know you that is standing with prayer card is there any doubt in your life is there any pardon is there any pardon me any sin in your life that you have not confessed if there is let me ask you this don't come into the prayer land with unconfessing in your heart because this is the children's bread you see and if you are not a christian surrender your life to christ in the prayer line then come it is for the believer will you do it accept him first as your savior and then come across a platform to be prayed for amen christ the mystery of god revealed the prophet said we have satan's answer god has vindicated himself god has proved himself to his promise in this day hallelujah the hardship is here amen christ the risen lord he is here in the same power of his resurrection manifesting himself that is the devil's answer there's a reason when this man sitting right here dropped dead on the other day sitting right here we could we could say come back life because the holy ghost said so that's why he could do to that little baby yonder in mexico had been dead for about 15 hours when the vision came and said call it back and i said let the little baby leave yes and the baby that the doctors has wrote a statement died at nine o'clock that morning and 11 o'clock that night come back to life he's living today hallelujah that is we have the devil's answer the brother said jeremiah in the battle of gilead jeremiah many hundreds of years ago was commanded of jehovah to stand in the gates of the city and ask this question is there no birmingham or is there no physician there the question is why then he said is my daughter the daughter of my people not recovered the word why god asked that question when god has made a way for people to escape danger or to escape sickness or to escape troubles or to escape the diseases provides a way of escape and the people turn it down and refuse it [Music] then god asks why what is the reason that you don't accept it amen [Music] just reading some quotes just to help us to know where we are standing so it is today that many people die in front of the church on the steps in the pigs die in their sins because they refuse to accept god's bomb that is in gilly they die in their sins because they refuse it not because there isn't any death but they just refuse to take it then what will they take they have to test something false instead it is not because there is no death is because there is black men and women just refuse to take it and they die die in the church set in the meeting and listen night after night to inspire that inspired prophet of god who must take the word fearlessly and lay it out he must be born again men and women sit in the pews and die and sing into the utter despair and annihilated from god not because there is no grace and salvation but because they refuse to accept it in preparation to you holy people his righteous indignation got up that's just you're speaking of shanghai i hope yours does too tonight let your righteous integration rise up get up against the evil get up against that old wheelchair get up against that crutches one of them will strike on them don't have to have them no sir they don't belong to you christ said should not this daughter be loosed on the sabbath day being bound with the devil all these years just once more he said a woman said i have a right to do what i want to do that is an american privilege it is your american privilege it arranges your god-given privilege though a goat will always kick up and fuse but a sheep stand still and fulfill its rights you see if you are a real child of god you will fulfill your american right to the holy spirit and let him move you and make you like you should be [Music] jesus christ yesterday today and forever now we find him as soon as god came upon him he was anointed went into the wilderness and out after 40 years and defeated satan by the word of god what did he do he brought he brought in the divine promise in the rich of the weakest of christians if he was god why did he let satan say if there be the son of god perform a miracle here and show me you can do it turn these stones into bread and eat he said it is written man shall not leave by bread alone so then as satan always tried to quote just to cover to quote the word went back and told him when he put him in the pinnacle of the temple again he said it is written and he defeated satan on the word of god that showed that you can defeat satan on the word of god no matter the word of god will defeat satan any place anywhere under any condition if it is in the belly even in the belly of a whale even in the lion's den if it is on the bed with cancer or it is lying younger bleeding to death in an automobile accident the word of god will defeat satan anywhere even the weakest christian can use it it is your god give him privilege if somebody prepared to use it [Music] the prophet said you as a christian god has given you a sword but if you don't know how to hold it somebody will stick or beat you somebody will stick he is holding stick but he will defeat you the reason is this because you don't know how to use the sword it is time for us to know let the sword fit our hands and let us know how to drive it right because it was a way it's a combat we must know how to drag the sword into the enemy's heart satan is just a brother brother as long as calvary is still flesh the blood of jesus is the flesh brother we have the antelope we have the solution we should not be afraid of his threat and his or whatever he doing the prophet said even the slim policeman on the road the whole america is behind him he has got authority to stop that big car that is pulling on the road he said you have you have also been giving that authority when satan is throwing sickness against us will help everyone say satan stop there [Music] be have authority brother we should not be afraid because god has given us power and that problem might be exercised that is your position in christ heavenly places in christ jesus amen that is your security praise so those brothers and sisters that has really cut that discovery brother coffee don't know coffee what you know is [Music] let me read this one and i give the prophet to the pastor faith is our victory he said now faith is a conqueror faith is a conqueror it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith doesn't make any peace with them we don't make peace with satan we have to conquer him praise the lord what is it to conquer conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to hank off to throw into prison it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it [Music] you have quipped it yes you have you you are greater than it eight i feel religious now [Music] which was first a sinner or a savior it was a savior for a savior is more powerful than a sin which is first the healer or a sickness it couldn't be less he was over the sickness it is a healer it can conquer the sickness and faith is the victory that overcomes every case of the devil faith is the victory faith is what yes not faith in your church no faith in your creed no faith in some men but faith in jesus christ who made the promise that is the victory what is it it is the victory see my arm is still crippled by faith is the victory i still feels sick but faith is the victory it overcomes the world [Music] that is our position so why we are going to pray then the pastor will take over and then lead us into prayer brother do not look at the circumstances don't look at the environment don't look at the opposition don't look at the challenge look at your victory it is not today you are going to get the victory it's not today if it is today it means you don't know what is in stock for you but you are victorious [Music] you see those days that we go to the cinema the cinema that you have really watched before and then you sit with somebody and then maybe the blues leave you know those and then they'll be beating oh they're beating that one that that's what you watch at the end of it you see this man that is down will rise and defeat the killer that's how it is we know the end of the cinema we know the end of this movie jesus christ has already defeated satan so if the battle is really saturated we fear not yes he will blow you down he will kick you down don't put the ventilator on you they will do this to you but you know the end of death we know the end of the picture victory for a child of god there's no way that the son of god will be defeated if jesus was defeated then the son of god can be defeated today abram said we stand co equal hallelujah hallelujah if a son of god come to know his position yes sister you stand co equally jesus christ wow thank you said angel pleading and then a son of god pleading who will god listen first if angel is asking god give me this give me the and the son of god also stand beside and say lord give brother say god will listen to the son of god first we are sons and daughters of god hallelujah amen let us pray yes thank you precious lord get some fuel encouragement to the church that they might know that the holy ghost is with us yes we are not destitute we are not empty we are filled with the holy ghost and therefore the enemy cannot bring his bluff he cannot bring his threatenings we are fearless we know where we stand you said the disease of the egyptians will not come near us and even if it happens we have the solution we have the blood we just come under the blood because all the benefit of calvary belongs to us we only come and make our claim so all lord the blessing and the sister that has been cut into this way further we lose them in the name of jesus
