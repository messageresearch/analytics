we felt we've felt you with us this whole time and we just continue to ask for your continued prayers not not just in our sorrow but that our joy would be restored that the peace of god that passes all understanding would just flood over our souls and once again that bubbling rook of god's goodness would come forth from our hearts you know we can only sorrow for so long and there always be times of sadness but that is our prayer that god's joy and his peace would pour from forth from us out to everyone else once again that we would be restored we just ask for your continued prayers and those things let's just go before the lord here this morning heavenly father lord we are just so grateful to be here amongst your people here this morning father lord father for their strength and numbers father lord and father we come together against the enemy fathers we bring our licks and flames of fire together father it's just like matches father one by itself you light it and it'll it'll burn

glory and all the praise in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen [Music] put our hands together for jesus [Music] oh yes all right let's go ahead and sit we have um we're going to be very much time conscious this morning we have a testimony from brother johnny and brother joshua have something to say please um two minutes welcome you're able to do that you're all right you're welcome brother and after that brother johnny you'll come up and give your testimony god bless you [Music] [Laughter] god bless you oh you know i just wanted to give a quick little tribute to our dear brother that's going on to glory okay three minutes you said all right um you know i remember when i was really young and ever since i can remember my mother i can remember my brother i can remember my father and everybody i could remember brother scott and a lot of you here you know he was always in my life since i was a little kid and even i remember when we kind of stopped coming here for a while and we got in a car accident that was really bad you know my brother over there broke his back and another person flew out the car and everything he came to the house you know and he was speaking to us and talking to us like we just spoke yesterday or something and just the type of love that he had for people it was so so heartwarming and i actually have a testimony of how god really used him right before he took him on and it was when i first came back to church i you know i would sit down over there and i would hear brother lawrence and the other song service leader you know called people up to pray and i belong okay they just called brother jordan up to prayer they just called brother you know just something i collectively thought in my mind then one day i was sitting over there and he said brother joshua can you come up to leave the service i'm like okay he just called brother joshua to leave i thought about oh that's me and i kind of looked at him and i came up you know he was laughing at me too i remember and i remember that no but he was laughing at me and i'm like huh you know and i thank god for putting down his heart and i went and i sat down when i sat down i felt so guilty and the reason i was feeling so guilty was because a thought came to my mind and it was when i was just about probably godzilla and men's age we were sitting down over there standing over there and brother scott came up and he was leading song service it was the ending of the service and he said brother joshua he didn't call me brother he said joshua would you like to come and close the service i'm like nope i looked a minute i said no he's like what he was kind of confused he said what are you short i'm like yup it's like you sure i'm like yup i'm good he was like huh okay so he bowed his head and he closed he uh prayed close the service and i don't know why that just came to my mind out of nowhere and i'm like man i felt so bad that i said no to him and then i got home i told my my dad i told my mom you know they told me something but it was just really bothering me and it's kind of crazy that the things that bother you that you never really paid attention to but when they come back it kind of disturbs you a little bit and i remember i was sitting down it happened again they called me and the same feeling came to my mind and i just prayed about it i'm like you know what god could you ah i don't know why i'm feeling like this i'm very grateful that you put it on our brother's heart to call me but i just wish that brother scott could call on my name one one last time you know i know it probably won't happen because he doesn't leak song services no more but i just wish that he would call on my name and you know they called on me again and i just kind of forgot to pray that prayer i just kind of forgot about it and then one day brother scott came up to lee's song service the last song service that he led up here and he was leading song service and that thought didn't even cross my mind i was sitting over there and i did not think like called me i was i didn't think it at all you know and before he started he said brother joshua would you come up and leave song service i'm like okay i come up i lead it i go sit back down it didn't even hit me what just happened i just sat down and the thought was coming to my mind and as it was coming he actually was telling me something about brother loyal that happened you know giving his little testimony and i sat down and then we started singing we started singing and it hit me like oh my oh thank you jesus you know it just hit me out of nowhere i'm like thank you lord i just realized what just happened i was very slow too but once it caught me i just got the stomping harder got the clapping more you know it was like wow i didn't realize what just happened until it happened and like it just meant so much to me that that happened right before god took him on because it was you know it may sound small to some of you but it was a real burden to me because i felt like i really let my brother down in a sense and it was just always coming to my heart and i believe god knew what it meant to me to the point where before he took our brother home he had him do that because it would have definitely had been a burden on me for a while so i definitely appreciate the lord for that and i would also like to thank him today is my 21st birthday and i just i'm sorry i know it's past two minutes i'm sorry just give me one second i'm going all right but um this was the last place that i ever thought i was gonna be on my 21st birthday which is very sad to say but you know i thought like to be honest i thought i'd rather be in the grave or a lot of different places than be here today you know i don't see a lot of people i've been around a lot of people that are either dead in prison 16 25 years overdosed got killed and just it's just like i was just living the life that they was living so i thought my faith was gonna be the same as them but after being in so many different situations and getting out of certain situations that they would have got caught in and lost their life or lost their freedom something just told me like this probably ain't your cup of tea and you need to go find something different and i just thank the lord because my birthday has not fallen on sunday for like the past 11 years and it so happened to be that the 21st birthday which i would oh my cousin you we gonna go do this and we gonna go do that no sir i'm not doing none of that you know so it's it's it's a blessing so i like to give god the glory for that i'm sorry [Applause] shalom church i'm very nervous i don't know why i mean this is not the first time i'm in front of people speaking to people but for some reason i'm nervous um i knew brother scott you know for two and a half years now because i've been coming here since the end of 2018 sometimes last year he told me he wanted to speak to me he wanted to meet with me and i didn't know you know was the meeting about and i was very nervous and anxious because at the time i just knew him for about a year and for some reason we couldn't find you know the right time and then finally we connect one saturday we met at caribou cafe in rabbit so during our meeting that's when he informed me what he wanted to meet me for he told me brother johnny me and sister naomi was wondering but i don't know how you will take it if the kids can start coming there you know on saturday as soon as you say that i start crying um so we can play with them we got a lot of games kids glam and stuff like that there's so many things we can do and that way you also can have time to yourself i say wow you don't even know me like that i asked him why and he said why not unbelievable and then i think we spend almost two hours we talk about a lot of things i talk about my conversion and you talk about other things but just to know that you know somebody can have that kind of love i mean this is children we're talking about they can bug you to death you know but because i have said i have twins one is a boy one is a girl so can you imagine but he's like you know i want them to start coming over on saturday that blew my mind i didn't expect that but that just to show you know what kind person or brother was but to go along with that you know i want to throw some flower at your sister because brother brown i'm saying it's better to throw flower at somebody one while they silly laughed then when did the dead sister naomi she's amazing i remember two days before the passing of her husband she texts me she wanted to know my email so i replied i sent her my email just to find out that she had a song she was preparing to sing with the children at church and this is the same lady during kovy she will come to the house and drop up some stuff for the children some materials so the the children can stay busy for them and sister i salute you i'm not gonna wait till god call you but here in closing you know i want all of us to know that death is an appointment we all have it's i mean it's an appointment we all have the appointment unless the rapture comes or jesus comes soon but here's my question to all of us how we want to be remembered when people are going to come and pay tribute what do they want what do you want them to say about you because now we still have time you know to change some things i can imagine cesar fei when people can go to her and tell her look to your father you let father have done for us and that's what i want now people to set my daughter to testify for the goodness of what i've done for people so now while we still have what we still have time we can change some things and that's the only way we can keep the memory of our brother because brother scott was all about love and i know some of us even when you come to church we don't greet one another i'm an usher sometimes i tell somebody to sit rather they resist they want to sit somewhere else it's hard how when do we gonna showing love to one another or sharing love because it's not just about this building me and brother scott did not meet europe we made that saddest church this lot of work needs to be done god bless you richly [Applause] let's put our hands together for jesus

sprang up to me and um when we drove him even this morning were coming there was something he said i mean a lot of things but one thing i just want to pick for a minute he said that god has assigned his angels unto us to keep us to protect us to deliver us and there are angels that are assigned to us and i remember telling a story here once upon a time that back in ghana in the 80s there was a place there's a place called terma sherman one of the terrible areas there ever was in ghana and there was this little guy that would go to church close from church and she walked through the path a bush path to get to the town and she would be singing and praising god as she was going home unknown to her somebody had noticed it and wanted to take advantage of her and this man went and laid in the bush because she knew it was wednesday and this girl was coming to pass by she went to church close from church she was on her way home and she was just singing and praising god she didn't know there was danger in the way and as she got close to the man all the men saw two armed men one on the left one on the right and they were dressed in military uniform and they were escorting her and she was just singing and praising god praise be to god wherever you find yourself whatever condition you find yourself in know that you are not alone praise be to god what a wonderful god we say yes yes just want to pray over this prayer request then we invite the preacher in praise be together shall we pray [Music] our lord and our savior jesus it gladdens our hearts this morning to see our sisters [Music] this naomi and sis faith and brother jordan [Music] and wherever the rest of the family are brother lawyer says grace and um the other sister i know father may you be with every one of them as

of peace and the lord of lords glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord o glory hallelujah praise his holy name amen [Applause] hallelujah isn't he wonderful he's wonderful let's read the portion of the scripture before we see that let's read this morning from the book of genesis chapter 3 we have so few places to read but maybe we will quote it later but genesis chapter 3 and maybe read from hebrews chapter 12. genesis 3 let's pray from verse 6. [Music] and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did it and gave also unto a husband with a and it did hit man let's read one more from my hebrews chapter 12. let's read that and hebrews chapter 12 verse 12 chapter 2 verse 1 wherefore sin we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the scene with that so easily beset us let us run with patients the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the offer and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god amen lord once again we thank you for your word we ask that you be with us in jesus name amen please let's be seated let me read from matthew chapter 15. matthew 15 matthew 14 sorry matthew chapter 14. verse 28 and peter and said him and said lord if it without beat me come on today on the water and he said come and when peter was calm down after the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind busted us he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me amen we thank god for his word amen god's word you know it's just wonderful and the bible tells us heaven and earth will pass away by the word of the lord we never pass away let's maybe we read one more scripture from the book of second kings second kings chapter two second kings chapter two let's straight from verse nine and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elijah said i pray let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou as asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i'm taken away from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talk that behold there appeared a child of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a wide wind into heaven and elijah saw it and he cried my father my father the child of israel and the us men thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his old man or clothes and ran them into he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan and it took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and say where is the lord god of elijah and when he had also had smite in the waters departed heather and heather and the elisha went over amen so we can just continue to read the scriptures and read the scriptures and read the scriptures and it's just wonderful because that's the only way we grow as christians is we read our bible every day and you pray every day amen so cultivate the habit to read the bible some of us don't read the bible but only you come to church and then you but read it at home find time to read your bible amen now we have living in a great technology i mean technology age and you know scientific advancement so you can get your bibles you don't want to carry bible but you can get your bible on your phones praise the lord so what will be your excuse if you don't read it so you can read it anyway so please read the bibles read it everywhere use your type wisely because we have been admonished to meditate on god's word day and night so young people enough of music enough for programs and games right enough of whatsapp and facebook and a different one messenger instagram this this this and all these things steal our time from us may god give us grace to be wise because you are not going to be questioning and what do you see on the instagram or whatever easter or munday or whatever gram or whatever but what did you do with god's word we must use our time wisely because we have been told to redeem the time and the enemy too has brought in a lot of things to steal our time i'm telling you the time we spend on these phones is match from this program to this other one and the things that you know just keep appealing to us anyway this morning we want to speak on keep your eyes on jesus keep looking to jesus do you know that there is something about what we look at what you look at there is something about it because the eye is a gateway it's an athlete that goes right to your soul so there is something about what you look at and you can see why there is so much of adverts and everything is about what you look like sometimes even you have not planned to eat but you look at an advert and you see some burger and some this and some this and some ice cream and the way they made it you want to eat ice cream you you want some beggar they draw they make it so nice and once you look at it it draws you and sometimes you want to lick the air swatch i can't wait to get there what you look at is very important so we must be careful of what we look at and remember in the scripture in the beginning it was what eve looked at that brought us into the state in which we are today she looked at the three and he saw a tree to be desired to make one wise and she stopped that is why she made a mistake she stopped because of what she looked at praise the lord what you look at affects your life so you can be affected positively or negatively depending on what you look at because what you're looking at you are feeding on it that's what the prophet of god said let me come to your office or the house or whatever let me see what you looking at it's i know what you are feeding on but what am i saying this morning let's keep our eyes on the lord jesus christ because there's so many things happening today try to distract our attention from the main thing the prophet of god said so there are so many voices in the world today so many problems and so many needs crying for attention but there will never be a voice so important and that was so attending to as the voice of the spirit of god and that's what the scripture says he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying and the spirit speaks through the prophet for in every age god's mind is meant no to his messenger that's why god addresses himself every time as we go through the church and he said unto the angel of the church right so god addresses himself to the messenger of the age unto the angel of the church right so whatever god has to an aid but it passes through the messenger so if you tell me the prophet william brown is not the messenger of the egg who is the messenger of the age are you the messenger martin luther was a messenger who is the messenger of this age it might not qualify to you he might not be in your sight but that is god's choice [Music] praise the lord that's god's choice you try to find thoughts with the prophet and find forth then you cannot even believe the bible because all the men that we read about were men with thoughts why would you talk about abraham the friend of god because of fear that man told his wife tell the people that i am not your husband he lied yes right i'm just talking the bible god told him don't leave you alone he left what about the man after god's own heart david he commented that don't drink any kills go through the scriptures you know even if you go to israel to the palestine to ask about jesus you hear a lot of things right right once i was in god in israel i went we were on the golan height and then we met a jewish rabbi and the brothers tried to ask so what do you think about jesus he said no i don't want to speak anything let's remain friends listen no but just let us know what you think you know what a rabbi told us i pity you people follow jesus so if they didn't want to speak by the bro you just he said i pray to you people follow jesus he said no and i look i said oh the blindness blindness still happening to these people so he depends where you are taking your information from come on it depends on where you are taking your affirmation from you read the scriptures you read about the disciples you go and ask the people that were in those days read about the prophets the people we admire prophet isaiah prophet jeremiah prophet this and that do you know that they were all killed the bible said isaiah was so asunder you know how many things jeremiah suffered in his days the whipping prophet why did that kill the prophet because jesus came and he told them your fathers killed the prophet and you garnished their tombs why did they kill the prophet because they thought the prophets were wrong that's right [Music] because the prophet was not speaking what they wanted to hear and that's why the prophets were wrong and jesus speaking in his day said be happy and rejoice if they persecute you if this become man of emotions against you he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so persecuted day of the prophets of god so the prophets of god were always persecuted and the people of god today will be persecuted for those that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution praise the lord are we together do you know in the scripture even when jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you had no part in me do you know that what jesus was saying to them why did the people left him servant of his own disciples moses has told the people don't eat blood let alone this man telling us except we eat his flesh and drink his blood how can we eat a man's voice did you hear what the man said and they might be whispering did you hear what he said today he said we eat this flesh how can we eat a man's flesh it was exactly against what moses said it was contrary to what moses said and they tried to put their own understanding they tried to understand it they were trying to explain it but we are not as to explain let us understand we are asked to believe that is why when they left here jesus said to the rest will he also god amen shall we go for we know you are the christ we might not understand what you are saying but you are the christ amen hallelujah hallelujah they did not walk nobody with him they left the message they left the church why because of that statement and you look at this physically but moses said this is not right moshe said we shouldn't eat blood is that when you even kill an animal let the blood go don't eat it how can this man say that ah this man has gone into error they must say that yeah the man is not a theologian he's just a healer he was another now he begin to teach and that's what he said about a prophet he was not a you know it's not that your logic was not a theologian he the gift was different healing and then he now begin to take upon himself to teach if god we are not a man and choosing the way you the prophet in a day more than any other prophet ministry since apostolic day and revealed the secrets of the heart will god leave that man in error brother branham said do you think god will give me the ministry he has given me and vindicate it all over the world and leave me in error it's certainly not i know where i am standing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah keep your eyes on jesus [Applause] [Music] amen you must know where to find your answer get to the scripture you'll find the answer but if you ask for man and some woman they will tell you your opinions what they think yes there are many things you cannot explain supernatural things you cannot explain it always praise the lord hallelujah may god help us keep your eyes on jesus keep your eyes on jesus in the beginning watch the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and direct hamonas don't get yourself confused [Music] if because you stop to look to listen to mr serpent because she stopped to listen she want to know reason she raised it she was she risen against the world because yeah there are so many things that if you want to reason hey you'll be off you see oh yeah there's something proof about this thing but brother like i've told people i am not looking for the truth i have found the truth [Music] let there be struggles like when they went and called nathaniel philip went and cornered he said come we have found him the one that moses spoke about he said we have found him the one that moses spoke about on the other side that the pharisees were saying this is a devil but philip said we found him. so it depends on what you are looking at where you are why are you looking for your answer look to the scriptures so in the bible in isaiah 45 22 god said look unto me are ye ends of the earth look unto me for salvation look unto me for healing look unto me for the answer look unto me for deliverance look unto me because i am the way the truth and the life look unto me the unchangeable god look unto me you are mighty look unto me the alpha and the omega look unto me the author and the finish of your faith look unto me for healing look unto me for deliverance look unto me for the baptism of the holy ghost look unto me for the changing of your life [Music] you won't finance that continuous criticism if you got on the internet today you'll find so many things even today against our lord jesus christ you know that go to the internet somebody they stand don't believe jesus is not god jesus is if you say all kinds of blasphemy things against our lord all kinds of oh my goodness may god help us so it depends on what you are looking at what you are ready and the source that's why you must come to the word you need the revelation of the word of the lord god has to reveal himself to a man if god doesn't reveal himself you will never know him because god hides in self and simplicity in simplicity and reveals himself in simplicity that's why he said no you're calling not many wise men not many nobles not many professors not many of these and that and that but god has chosen the best things of this life to confront the mighty for the wisdom of this world is foolish to god yes sir look unto me look unto jesus hallelujah hallelujah read the scriptures brothers and sisters they killed the prophets they contained the prophets jeremiah they call him a false prophet isaiah a false prophet every one of them that's why they kill them right they hear the false prophets and they condemn the true prophets the true prophets of god were condemned how can today people be finding things against the message of the hour against the prophet and the catholic church is there and you don't find this against the catholic church you don't find this again a matter of the church you don't find this against all these things around us but you want to find something against william branham against the message of the hour against the message that has transformed the lives of millions [Applause] if it has not done that for you it has done that for me [Music] it has made me what i am today [Music] i was reading the bible i was even preaching when i was small boy preaching in buses and preaching in marketplaces and here and there and teaching all kinds of things and i was buying christian books and and it time i you know i i was i got a small job during 98 1975 and then i just going back christian literature and then read about missionaries and read about this and read about that and i just preaching on about trinity about this and that on that until i got the message in 1978 and then i didn't even buy somebody gave me a book and one of the first books i read was a true sign that is overlooked and i was getting ready to go to bible college because i was in the presbyterian church and in the time he said look there are no many people that the thing is in you so go to bible college got to trinity i was very active in the church and yeah yeah yeah i was very active and and then we became in we were in a little prayer group and we call it prayer and outreach group and we pray and we go out and preach we go to dumb broadcasting maybe about 4 4 35 we are out in the in the morning preaching preaching in the neighborhood preaching here and there in the morning sometimes we take the bus season we paid and go up and down the city pray and preach and preach and preach and then even in time we go to when people are going to cinema and make a line to go and watch the film and we'll be there preaching preaching in the morning when we are going to work we meet them at the station the lorry park because they have to make a line to board the buses and we'll be there preaching praise the name of the lord amen hallelujah and then and then god was good to me as i was planning and then look at me through shine and i read it and say man this might never go to bible school any preacher like this wow i don't want to overlook that sign the true sign i don't want to overlook it because if you are driving and you miss the sign you fail to get the right interpretation of the wrong side you'll kill yourself you will miss the junction you'll miss the exit and you'll find yourself somewhere else and many people have missed the exits [Music] you must know how to interpret at all science that's a story i had somebody went to and they tried to find about the road science and he saw a place and they dropped they've dropped they have drilled cattle and they say what is this it's a chokbar that is restaurant because you saw the cattle draw and they said what does he say it's a restaurant he don't know his cattle crossing but when he saw cat he taught his food he says restaurant you must put the right interpretation to the wrong size [Music] of the heavenly bridegroom and the ethnic bride i didn't even understood it but something emissions [Music] and the grace of god has brought me this far no turning back i have decided i have made up my mind i am convinced and i'm going forward because i see my life what this thing has done what the word of god is doing in my life i am break up my mind and i keep looking to jesus [Music] for the bible said looking unto jesus the offer and the finisher of our faith the beginning and the end of our faith the offer and the omega of our faith the word the truth and the lies keep your eyes on the lord jesus christ the word of the lord made flesh for in every age god's word becomes flesh yes [Music] amen hallelujah glory may god help us amen if you're a double-minded person may god help you strengthen you up because you are confusing yourself you are confusing yourself you want to read about this what prophet saw this said what prophet has that said what scientists they say or what i don't care what anybody says i said i don't care what anybody says i only cares but what god says what the word says what did the one says i will send you a light of the prophet before the coming of the tragedy of the lord and it will turn the heart of the children to the faith of the fathers that's what i'm concerned about as it was in the death of noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man one time around 1778 when i got a message and after that we there was a crusade and you know from pedicles that people have in the crusade at rich meeting and i went there and i was standing there and you know we like the things of god so just was there and then after the preaching was over somebody came to me they tried to convince people talk to people to give their lives to christ it's very important if you're here you might be coming to church if you have never given your life to christ please do it surrender your life to christ it's not enough to oh the message is true the preaching is nice receive it you have to repent repent the bible say repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins amen oh but the bible says repent of me baptize in the name in the name of the father and of the son and of the lord yes sir the name of the father son holy ghost is the lord jesus christ like our western people if you are in the class and the teacher said grace or whoever you are come and write your name on the blackboard write your name on the blackboard you come to the blackboard and you say write your name on the blackboard but teach yourself i should write my name on it so i i'm just doing what teachers say write your name on the black board write your name on the right yes the teacher says so write your name a little bit and jesus said baptize and baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost that's what we do in the name of the father we baptize you in the name of the father in the name of the son what is the name what is your name [Music] jesus said father yes i have revealed your name unto them jesus said i did not come in my father i didn't come in my own name i came in my father's name if he came in his father's name and he's called jesus that is the father's name he said i came in my father's name what is the father's name it's jesus [Music] that's why the bible says whatsoever we do whether we eat whether we bury whether we baptize whatever we do we should do it all in the name of the lord jesus christ for there is no name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved except the name of the lord jesus christ so if you are here and you have not been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ to be identified with fame in his death bloody and resurrection i admonish you this morning i admonish you this morning repent surrender your life and be identified with him in his death in his barrier in his resurrection hallelujah young woman mama papa you don't need to be a sympathizer god is not looking for sympathizers god is looking for his sons and daughters god is looking for people that will take their stand people that will identify with jesus people that will pledge allegiance to the lamb of god people that will say yes lord i believe yes lord i believe yes i surrender to you i will go with you other way if you have never done that please don't go back the same because time is running out [Music] hallelujah may the lord help us are we together oh i'm feeling so good [Music] i'm feeling so good talking about jesus accepting jesus and i want to remind you in our age nobody exhausted jesus christ like william branham when people were holding on to trinity and trinity and this man stood up and he prayed to us that jesus is the christ right jesus is the lord jesus is a healer jesus is the baptizer jesus is everything yes yes yes he is such a christ he preached christ and if you receive the message you receive christ as your lord and savior you line up your life with the word amen if we say we are believers and we believe this message your life will line up with these creatures because that is what the prophet preached one time i listened to the testimony of brother agreement he said a man was annoyed with him and the man said to brother peter green what i don't like about your people is your your pastor is mistaken to be jesus christ but apparently he said to the brother the man he didn't believe the message but prairie green said to him excuse me sir has anybody ever mistaken your pastor to be jesus christ it's no longer no no no no brother praise i'm glad i'm happy that my pastor has been mistaken to be jesus christ do you think it's easy for somebody to be mistaken to be jesus christ he said that's the difference your pastor is not living the life my pastor is living their life [Music] what life are you living this message of the hour is to reproduce that life the life of christ in you [Music] jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if you believe the word of the lord the lord jesus will reflect his life in you and you'll be a written epistle [Music] [Applause] sure ready for me people will look at your life people will look at you and they said these are christians [Music] they look at their lives in antioch they say oh they're christians who are these people why are they dressing this way why are they walking their way why are they living this way they are christians they are christ-like they are like christ who are you like [Music] who are we like and who are you like we are not asked to be like any man to be like william branham to be like we are asked to be like jesus christ amen who are you reflected like that and i asked jesus asked the disciples one day whom do men say i the son of man that's right who do they say i am and they say lord some people say you are elijah a lot some people say you are joined the baptist look some people say you are one of the prophets some people say you are just you are a good man some people say you are this and that praise the lord and i am glad that elijah jerry man all the people that they were calling were good character men whom do they say you are too your life is reflecting there you who who that's your neighbor says you are yes [Music] who does your friend says you are who does your relationship your relationship you are who does your fellows or your co-workers or people whom do they say you are your peers in the school whom did they say you are the people we are successful who knew sir we are the people that see us up in the home today say you are amen god help us are we together [Music] why do they mention jeremiah why did they mention isaiah these were godly people you know what every prophet that came lived part of the life of christ because you were the god of the prophets he was the word he was the fullness of the word the fullness of god in christ yes so every prophet lived part of their life so some people look i said ah does not behave like whatever ah it was a gripping prophet like jeremiah was oh he was a prophet like moses the lawgiver he speaks with authority and somebody oh it looks like this one oh it looks like that one who do you say do they say you are whatever in your place and your phrase who do they say what do they say about you think about it may god help us what is your own testimony whom do they say you are not just your dressing because the tree is known by the fruit at best not what you say about yourself whom do they say you are the people that relate with you whom do they say you are if you don't have that testimony you need to be at the utter lord help me because if not we'll be bringing reproach upon the cross of christ [Applause] your men your women mothers and fathers may god help us hallelujah i hope you are not getting annoyed at me but if you do that's your own choice i don't care about that i didn't come here so that you'll be praising me or i will be robbing you with some vaseline or something you know i didn't come here for that i'm here yet my memories to god that he will make use of me that you and i will be helped that way this life is over we'll meet on the other side then you can shake my hand brother god bless you what you prayed the other day help me and that's that's my joy that somebody straighten up and somebody line up and somebody received the holy ghost and somebody's faith is alleged to be more like jesus hallelujah [Music] god help us so as i was saying as i was standing at that crusade and somebody came to me he said brother you know he talked to me and you know the bible says as it was in the days of noah and uh people were eating and they were drinking i said and so what so i made myself as i don't know anything about bible and he said they were eating i said so what happened and then this and that and then it continued i said so what happened and the women were like this and they were modern i said so what and it he said and then he said you know and god sent a prophet and noah was preaching to them and told them to come into the act that's okay when he said we came to the asset now sir will you agree with me that we need a prophet like noah you look up he said you're a brahmin say look at you you thought they were eating they were drinking they were doing this and they were doing this and all these things we see it i said they will not greed that we will need a prophet like noah because jesus said i said to us so celebrity why is that prophet like noah who is that prophet like noah if you said he's not willing are you the one yeah this prophet was vindicated by jehovah god with sights and wonders in the life of brother branham this creature was made real jesus christ the same yesterday [Music] in the man's life this creature that jesus or whatever it's it's reason because when he came he went to the jews he said don't go to the gentiles he did this revealing of the son of man to the jews and the samaritans three races of people jews gentiles samaritans the jews had it the samaritan's added the gentiles didn't have it yes but he said that would be the revealing of the son of man and in our age the son of man was revealed brother branham was not the son of man he was a son of a man revealing the sound of man the son of man is the lord jesus christ [Applause] but his body was borrowed god borrowed that members and god borrows your members god always brought roots he borrowed the womb he borrowed the boot he borrowed the body moses he borrowed please borrow me please give me who will borrow him this morning [Music] who will borrow him this morning murray he borrow the womb who will borrow you something so that he can use you he can barely set he can hide himself and reveal himself through you he needs young men today he needs young women today he needs sons and daughters today he needs vessels today he need people that will surround surrender say lord take me lord take me lord take me i surrender to you because no matter your age irrespective of your age if you surrender to him he will use you lord help me hallelujah i believe he's using me and i believe it's using you because man is god's agent he uses us to express himself to make himself known yes he uses us he uses our eyes our ears he uses our members but lebron said he has no legs but your legs he has no hands but your hands he has no eyes but your eyes so if you borrow him he will see visions he will see dreams he will preach through us he will give prophecy he will manifest himself he will live his own life and when people see you oh we testify brother scout god needs best to use god needs them do you know when you look at something you become one with it something happens that's true let me give in the scripture i think genesis 30 or somewhere there jacob with his father-in-law leban and lebanon was praying tricks this couple had to wait for the man the man was not ready to pay him to give him the good corrupt pay hey don't try to cheat anybody no it's not good our yes we should be honest and sincere don't be tricky and don't try to act smart because somebody can act with you we need to be more godly that god will use it and he saw jacob he made a trick he gathered some sticks with colors and polish whatever colors you need in the bible say when the animals come to give back the strong animals he put them in a gut straight and their eyes look on that stretch that he has made the colors that he has made there and when they give that they give it to that he's in the bible [Music] you can check that later from verse 37 or somewhere there you can get it or somewhere there you read the whole chapter there and jacob when the animals come they are in that gutter and they just look at the streets that he has made they look at it they look at it they stay looking and when they give it they call her that one so what you look at you buff it you give birth to that that's what you look at the things of the world you stay so much your focus is on the jesus you become that you begin to dress like that you begin to act like that yes that's why i don't understand why somebody will take money and say i'm going to buy a crazy jeans christy james oh of course you are crazy to go and buy christine that is stone here and it's done here and it's done here chris city and it's more expensive than property that means are you crazy indeed you lost your mind and then you walk and crazy a normal person would not wear crazy jeans i don't want to be identified with crazy people and if you look and you decide what they get those things from because they look hollywood stars some crazy person that's something some crazy person makes some hairdo and esther some crazy person watching clothing and then a sensible person like you want to act crazy brother brown said you dress like that you look at them you dress like them you are so sad with them you become like them [Music] the amen is not coming out but it's okay [Applause] you go you take this pamphlet or whatever they call them and you look at those pamphlets or whatever you call them attack and then you look at oh they're safe here and they're like so hey oh five dollar what from 40 forte wow you look at it sometimes you don't even need that in you but just because you look at it you have been enticed you go there to the market and buy it there are things you've brought for five years you'll never touch it you look ah so i have this thing here you don't even know me amen there are many of us here we don't even know what we have you don't know what you have and you keep buying come on every day why do they display all those things because there is something about what you look at so that you don't need those things so you didn't go to the market for that thing you didn't go to the mall for that thing but you just look at hey [Music] may god help us to bring this eye under the word [Music] what you look at affect you so we are asked to look to jesus he said look unto me he is the word stay with the word look on him so that we become like him like the india told john go to the angel take the book from his right hand when you eat you become what you eat you become what you look at yes because you are feeding on that oh hallelujah what are you looking at today look at me that's what jesus said and what you look at affects you don't forget that why did the children of israel fail to enter the promised land their eyes they look at the place they look they say ah look at the joints there look at this problem look at this problem some of them look at the problems and some of them saw the opportunities yes faith say oh this is it oh wow why others look at the protestant look at the problem there look at that problem there when god proto moses took them out of the land he said you are going to allow foreign but to get to that land there were a lot of obstacles on the way somebody's had this too much problems oh yeah what some people even wanted to stay back right and i would say i thank god when the children of israel came to the red sea and they come there if they have not seen the egyptians coming after day they would have stayed there they would have said we're okay here it's okay we're okay but god has a plan god has a purpose it's not where you want to stop it is not how we want to live it is not what we want to do god will make sure whatever will move us to get to where he has to sit he will do it whether you like it or not you didn't call yourself you didn't choose yourself you can't stay where you want to stay he will make you up to get you to where you want to be [Music] hallelujah do you know it wasn't the choice of mary and joseph to go to bethlehem it was not your choice they would have to stay in jerusalem it was not their choice to go to the stable to give birthday if there was no marriage choice will anybody choose that place but there is a promise there was a prophecy and the word of god might be fulfilled and god sought to eat that his word not your word not your will his will will be done and may god's will be done in our lives if you are somewhere if you are sitting somewhere if you are doing something that god is not happy may god move you out of that place force it upon you hey brother yes sir you cannot hold back the rapture we must be in our position we must be in our place every one of us from the prophet to the pew we must line up so that the rapture can take place so that we can go let god move you may god force it upon you may dress calm down upon us the children of israel they were at the red sea there they come there and they were enjoying themselves all right after look at the scene we can't go anywhere look at this gossip we'll see and there behold huh that forced them it was forced upon them it was not your choice it was false upon them so now we've got to go we cannot stay here and brother we don't want to stay here lord make it way so we get out of here may it be forced upon us to get out of here or to begin to pray to begin to call upon the name of the lord to begin to seek the face of the lord move everything out of power and they begin to cry and they begin to pray oh hallelujah may something happen to us that will make us to pray and call upon the name of the lord [Music] for it was the prayer when they begin to pray god came down he said i remember and i've seen you afraid and i've heard your cry sometimes we become too flatful we become too careless until something happens and when it happens we begin to come to church some of you that don't want to come to church your wait is coming for you [Music] he's coming for you don't worry if you are a son you better come before your fault [Music] you better shake yourself you better straighten your life because if you're one of these brother he will not leave you if you have to cry he will make you to cry if you have to put on a sick bed he will do it because

morning you have to line up we have to line up we have to repaint we have to strengthen our life strengthen our families [Applause] when they saw that jesus said let's go they didn't know what to do

were afraid to enter the land do you remember how i fought do you remember i brought the question answered to moses the prophet as it was in my heart yes and the prophet gave me hebrew yes he said 45 years ago our brothers were afraid to go there but i want you to know i am 85 years now i'm not 85 i'm 63. i just got 63. [Applause] but i'm saying to you over 40 years i've been preaching and i'm saying to you my strength today to preach is as i was and he becoming sweeter and he becoming glorious and he becoming more stronger [Music] [Applause] hallelujah caleb said give me my mountain i'm ready to fight for it i'm ready to take my possession i'm ready to claim it i'm ready to dispose the people there and take over the land and sisters and brothers we can dispose the enemy we can push them off you can push them from your land push them from your inheritors your god-given land and possess the land you can do it because you have a promise some of you are just looking at me this crazy boy man anyway don't just look at me listen to the word of the lord look to jesus by his grace we are where we are by his grace we have come this far i am not turning back for nothing god be my help i'm going all the way if god has been gracious to me and he has helped me he has stand so much for me and make me what i am today i should leave this for what i should leave this message for what he said today you begin to fight for to the message if stop to look you want to hear what this branch said what this man said what this man said and what that one said and i don't care about what anybody says i am telling you now my concern is what he says [Music] i'm convinced and i have the evidence in my life amen look to jesus keep your eyes on him yes amen when it begins and and the lord they were looking look at the giant look at this look at that look at that and when they look at those things they begin to go down they destroy their faith it weakens them brother the message has so many confusion this one said that and that one said this brother said always the devil we pointed to somebody that is not making it right look at that boy saying believe them and say look at the life is living look at these ones what about the one that is living the life [Music] why don't you look at this other one there why don't you look at that sister there why don't look at that brother there hallelujah look at the right thing hey hey hey hallelujah you look at your wife you look at the brother oh that sister did this that's what about that sister who didn't do that [Applause] [Music] what about that brother that didn't do that what about that brother living right what about the sister living right oh yes son you said my wife did this and oh she did but something what about the good thing she did why you can't talk about the good thing why you don't talk about the good thing your husband did what you're willing to measure on the negative and instead of the positive there is something positive look at the positive way look at the positive one because that will build your faith and that will encourage you and that will make you to live over the mountain [Applause] hallelujah praise the lord oh i love jesus saints of god hey turn your eyes from the negative things to the positive ones because brother branham said if you want to see mistakes you will see it depleted you will see prince look at the sister the way he make his face when it's like the brother was smiling when immediately i came they changed his face it depends on your iso the way you are looking at things when you are looking at this because what you are saying might not be the truth because when you have something in your mind your eye will see that right anytime the sister sees me he squeezes he don't laugh again did he said you should not also laugh if she doesn't laugh love is infectious laugh maybe your own will lose that fellow hallelujah one time we were taking a picture and we stood there and what the cameraman he was looking at this he said we are stopping laughing he wanted us to but he just messed yes do you know you're a creator that you can create an atmosphere you can create you can you can change everything around let's use that power let's use that authority what god has given to us to cheat this around us in your family in the church in your neighborhood in the office be a creator [Music] i have to close because if not we'll not leave here today praise the lord what they look at they look at the jebusites and the giants and the problems this one said that that one said that look at that look at that and they begin to cry what they look they they brought evil report of the land and the people begin to say we cannot take the land look at this people they look at all these problems i'm not going back let's go back to egypt to eat it at this time no way if it was good he would not have taken us out of it do you know god don't want his children to be comparing look at the word and to be like this israel made that mistake they look at the other nations and they said make us a king so that would be like the other nations i don't want to be like the other nations the bible says we are royal pursuit the bible says we are chosen generation the bible says we are peculiar we are holy people what else do you want god said you are holy god says you are choosing god said you are peculiar god said you are blessed god save it [Applause] [Music] stop looking around and keep your focus on jesus amen god help us moses and the rest of the children of israel may god help every one of us joshua and caleb they look at the promise and when they look at the promise that we can take the land he said we are we are more than able to take the land because they look at the promise and when you look at the promise it energizes you it despises you oh hallelujah look at the promise of god look to jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what are you looking at look at the children of israel yes when they met goliath they were looking at goliath they said look at the man's sword look at the man's spear look at the man emmett look at the mantis and they say they were running away but there came a boy they came back david the anointing of god upon him he didn't look at goliath he didn't look at the size of goliath he said god will deliver him to me no matter his size no matter which no matter what he has done i'm able to take it i'll bring that man down what a dark great mountain before zerubbabe it's not by might it's not by power but by the spirit of the living god hallelujah and that's what we need today the spirit of the living god the true baptism of the holy ghost the power of transformation all that will take the desires of the world out of us the last of the flesh the pride of life drinking and smoking and whatever they have and fight and build abuses oh if you take it out the power of the holy ghost come upon you bend the world out of you bend the trash out of you hallelujah hallelujah because we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses let's lay aside every weight and see whether so easily beset us jesus the word i said close let me say this one peter was on the sea jesus was walking and peter said lord if it is you because yesterday don't be afraid it is me please say if it is you let me also walk on the water don't be afraid to ask don't be afraid to ask america put yourself in did you let me walk under water i want to give it to you let me also bring me to work he said come on you can do it come on walk and peter stepped out of the boat and he was walking and he was walking until he turned his eyes from jesus and he began to look at the mountains he began to look at the sea he began to look at the waves he began to listen to the sound of the word because he turned his eyes from jesus when he was looking at jesus dusty were there the water was there the words were still tossing but as he cut his eyes on jesus all those things were silent those things were quiet they were there they were making the noise they were going up and down they were tossing the same yeah but as it was on jesus all those things meant nothing church troubles and trials and things they will be around us if you look at them you will sink if you look at jesus you ride over there may god be with us may god help us to look to jesus look at elijah he said elijah elijah said if you look at me if you see me you'll get it he cut his eyes on elijah his master elijah said what do you want me to do for you he said master i want double portion of your spirit don't be afraid to ask for big things [Music] brother brandon said we should not be afraid god said we should not be afraid god said proof of me ask me of great things ask me of my words prove me prove me question prove me are you afraid for god are you having mercy on god he is the inexhaustible fountain he's still the inaccessible fountain ask me thank you jesus if you are here and like yourself what do you want me jesus said ask what you will did you say that asked your way and elijah said master i want double portion he didn't ask for the same thing he said give me more i want more elijah said i just said you have asked for something that is very hard nevertheless if you see me if you are determined if you are willing if you believe if you love him if you take him at his word if you are sincere if you are sincere you will get it there is nothing that god cannot do for us there is nothing that he cannot give to you if they ask me god want to be proven god wants to be challenged god wants us to ask for big things [Music] don't limit god are we afraid for god is that inexhaustible fountain but abram says he's just like a little fish in the atlantic ocean i don't want to drink too much water let the ocean get finished what right brother said that is nonsense and it is nonsense for you to think that you can exhaust his father i mean exhaust the goodness of god the message of god the i mean the fountain of the living the fountain of life is accessible that's what you weigh you can get it elijah if you see me you'll get it and listening as they were talking i just saw as they were talking it happened right yes i was just thinking like i was thinking as they continue their work and their conversation our master will come in an hour you never thought of let's continue walking let's continue looking he will do it for us believe in him don't be afraid to ask he said i will never leave you so what am i saying this morning keep your eyes on jesus stay focused don't don't be don't be side attracted this one said keep keep looking be focused keep looking because remember there will be things that will try to distract your attention to make you to fail to make you to miss it but keep your eye and brother bryan said it depends on what you are looking at if you look at the promise he said no matter the circumstances god will fulfill his word he said if you look at the promise listing god will bring it to pass he said when you look at the word of god it will bring peace it will bring healing it will bring deliverance every redemptive blessing will become yours it depends on what you are looking at let's look at what will benefit us let's look at what we strengthen us what we energize us and it's jesus the word people are reading about coronavirus people are reading about heart trouble what is this and you read about them read about the solution i am the lord that he left all your diseases i am the way the truth and the life read about it don't change about god the almighty god the great i am the resurrection read
