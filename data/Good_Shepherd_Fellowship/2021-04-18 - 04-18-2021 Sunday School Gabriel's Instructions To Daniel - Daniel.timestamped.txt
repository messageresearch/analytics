[1:55] astronomy calendars and
[1:57] the julian the astronomy and the roman
[1:59] and the whole of them
[2:00] there's somewhere somewhere there's
[2:01] something god knows about it and he's
[2:03] able to redeem it
[2:06] i know the julian calendar has 2 365 and
[2:09] one fourth day
[2:10] in a year so oh they're all mixed up but
[2:14] there's a truth somewhere
[2:16] i see so many churches so many
[2:17] organizations so many people going this
[2:19] and some hail mary and some
[2:21] of worshiping this and that the other
[2:23] there's got to be a truth somewhere
[2:24] there's got to be a god somewhere
[2:26] there's got to be a message somewhere
[2:28] hallelujah
[2:30] i see false prophets arising acting like
[2:33] discernments and all other kinds of
[2:35] stuff
[2:35] going on there's got to be a real one
[2:37] there somewhere
[2:39] that counterfeits made off of i see
[2:42] people getting in the flesh and shouting
[2:44] and
[2:44] carrying on and going out and living all
[2:46] kinds of lives there's got to be a
[2:47] genuine holy spirit
[2:50] [Music]
[2:53] i see people acting religious and so
[2:55] forth and trying to be
[2:56] past i know there's a genuine god
[2:59] somewhere there's a genuine spirit
[3:00] somewhere called that's an old hypocrite
[3:02] it's made off of it an old bogus one
[3:04] there's got to be something that's real
[3:06] amen a man
[3:08] a people a church a god there's got to
[3:11] be something true
[3:12] somewhere yeah amen amen because these
[3:15] are just copied off of it
[3:16] yeah there's something real somewhere
[3:18] i've said to this church about your
[3:20] gifts
[3:21] listen to your gifts keep them in the
[3:22] bible amen
[3:24] don't take a substitute when the skies
[3:26] are full of the real ones
[3:29] let's keep the real ones let's get the
[3:31] realer don't have any at all
[3:33] amen now
[3:37] the closest the fact that god deals with
[3:41] israel only when she's in her homeland
[3:43] let's take
[3:44] when god abraham left the homeland
[3:48] and went down into egypt what happened
[3:51] he walked away from the will of god and
[3:54] never was blessed till he returned back
[3:56] to the homeland
[3:57] amen god never dealt with him
[4:00] not one vision not nothing else till he
[4:02] come back to the homeland
[4:05] look at israel when they were sent down
[4:07] in egypt
[4:08] 400 years
[4:10] [Music]
[4:12] not one miracle not one sign
[4:18] not one thing half of the moment
[4:20] [Music]
[4:21] not recorded in the history of the book
[4:26] same old 9-9
[4:28] [Music]
[4:29] go to church offer the land say a hail
[4:33] mary or whatever it was
[4:34] go back next year same way
[4:37] the priest all argued rabbi so-and-so
[4:40] will let rabbi so and so he's got a
[4:41] better scholarship
[4:43] he knows more about the egyptians first
[4:44] thing you know egyptian
[4:46] and almost the same thing that's the
[4:49] same thing
[4:50] happened to the church
[4:54] we've all went to be methodist or
[4:56] baptist or presbyterian and we're
[4:58] got a degree out of hartford we got a
[5:00] degree out of wheaton we got a degree
[5:02] out of somewhere else or bob jones
[5:04] we we got a bachelor of art we got a
[5:06] ddld or something like what is it now
[5:08] into a bunch of nonsense
[5:10] amen the way it was in egypt and
[5:14] god never did deal with israel till she
[5:18] come to her homeland
[5:21] hear me saith the lord
[5:24] hallelujah god will not deal with his
[5:27] choice so she comes
[5:28] back to the holy land hallelujah
[5:32] message of the hour come
[5:36] back to the original amen get away from
[5:39] your methodist baptist presbyterian
[5:41] ideas
[5:41] your pentecostal assemblies oneness
[5:44] threeness and fivenews
[5:46] whatever it is church of god nazarene
[5:48] pilgrim holiness church of christ
[5:50] all movements amen amen
[5:54] now i realize this strikes the world
[5:57] [Music]
[5:58] all wrong all the devil
[6:03] godly man and every one of them amen god
[6:06] made people in every one of them
[6:07] movements
[6:08] amen but the organization in itself is
[6:11] not god
[6:13] and god will never bless it he never has
[6:15] done it
[6:17] i asked any historian you will hear this
[6:19] tape to write it and tell me whenever
[6:22] the church organized if god didn't lay
[6:25] it on the shelf and
[6:26] never dealt with it no more i'll put it
[6:29] through
[6:30] county when he ever raised up the
[6:31] lutheran again wesley method is our
[6:33] pentecostal
[6:36] never did that organization laid there
[6:39] and
[6:39] cankered it rotten
[6:43] god took individuals
[6:46] and tried to part the people back to the
[6:48] homeland
[6:50] amen and man the individual so weak and
[6:53] sissified with some kind of a degree
[6:56] until they
[6:57] organized another organization made it a
[7:00] two-fold child more hell it was to begin
[7:02] with
[7:02] amen but somewhere surely
[7:07] jehovah has a man that he can put his
[7:09] hands on
[7:11] who will not compromise with them by the
[7:14] young
[7:15] organization who will swing the people
[7:18] back to the rock christ jesus back to
[7:21] the original pentecost in the risen holy
[7:23] ghost
[7:24] with the original signs original one
[7:26] hallelujah
[7:27] [Music]
[7:28] hallelujah
[7:33] under any kind of a persecution run out
[7:36] cancel out
[7:36] fall out anything else amen they'll stay
[7:40] with them
[7:41] god never blesses israel until she gets
[7:44] to her homeland
[7:45] god will never bless you a methodist
[7:47] baptist presbyterian
[7:49] catholic or a pilgrim holiness nazarene
[7:51] church of christ or
[7:53] are a pentecostal organization
[7:58] never bless you that way come
[8:01] back to the homeland
[8:04] to the beginning back to the pentecostal
[8:08] experience
[8:09] like it happened on the day of pentecost
[8:12] on the power of the living god
[8:14] changed those thousands of people
[8:18] and set their heart aflame with the
[8:20] power of god
[8:21] that showed genuine not impersonated
[8:24] signs
[8:26] not some made-up telepathy not some
[8:29] valkyrie got into a rat race like we got
[8:31] in america
[8:33] who can have the biggest painter who can
[8:34] have the biggest crowd amen what
[8:36] difference does that make to
[8:38] god wants the people
[8:41] honest and hard not to be proud
[8:45] and we all got a rat race here running
[8:48] yes what a disgrace to see if we can add
[8:51] a thousand more
[8:52] to our organization to disgrace
[8:58] he wants us back to the truth back to
[9:00] the spirit
[9:02] back to the right line back to the
[9:04] highway in christ
[9:08] back to the truth yes how can he ever
[9:11] bless us the way we go
[9:13] he won't he never blessed israel until
[9:16] they come back to the promised land
[9:18] and when they got back in the promised
[9:19] land signs and wonders begin to happen
[9:23] you sent a man right down among them by
[9:25] the name of moses
[9:27] was this moses come down with a polished
[9:30] up theology
[9:32] did he come down with a bachelor of art
[9:33] degree did he come down with a lld phd
[9:40] come down with the power
[9:44] house
[9:47] and with a message returned from this
[9:50] land
[9:51] to the homeland amen return o disperse
[9:54] to your own
[9:56] hallelujah amen
[10:04] for nearly 2 000 years the jews have
[10:06] been out of their homeland
[10:08] scattered through the four winds of the
[10:10] earth how that we can make this message
[10:13] last for weeks now if we had to go to
[10:14] details
[10:16] we can chase israel right back and show
[10:18] when he was scattered by the roman
[10:19] empire
[10:20] on the rejecting of the messiah how she
[10:23] was drove to every nation under heaven
[10:26] go back to jacob israel back in genesis
[10:29] 44 and 45
[10:31] and show back there how he blessed those
[10:33] patriots and told them exactly where
[10:35] their standing would be in the last days
[10:36] and i can point to you exactly every
[10:38] nation of israel every tribe of israel
[10:41] standing exactly in the nations where it
[10:42] said it would be
[10:44] here we are today the jew that we know
[10:46] that's not the real jew
[10:48] the real jews that real orthodox who has
[10:51] not defiled himself
[10:53] with the things of the world who's not
[10:55] went out and joined other churches
[10:57] that's the ones that's returning out are
[10:59] living on cheese and bread
[11:02] up on the hillsides not allowed in the
[11:05] old city
[11:05] had to build him a city on this side in
[11:07] an old man's land with machine guns
[11:09] pointing both ways
[11:10] but she's beginning to put forth her
[11:12] buds
[11:15] [Music]
[11:23] but she belongs to israel oh glory

[11:32] them explain it all to you the arabs
[11:34] then take you over the other side that's

[11:38] god's children's gonna take her over

[11:46] daily sacrifice will be set up and the
[11:48] antichrist will make a covenant for them
[11:50] last seven weeks
[11:51] and in the midst of it he'll break that
[11:52] covenant turn them all into catholicism
[11:55] the abomination will spread over the
[11:56] whole thing like that and then the end
[11:58] shall be

[12:39] a despisation
[12:40] but because of the love of their money
[12:42] they came back again

[12:46] into palestine

[13:10] declared him a nation this last year

[15:31] six to anoint the most holy let me read
[15:34] it to you now
[15:34] out of the bible it's the 24th verse
[15:37] seven weeks are determined upon thy
[15:40] people the jews and upon thy holy
[15:44] upon thy holy city israel
[15:47] jews jerusalem to finish transgressions

[15:56] to bring in everlasting righteousness
[15:58] for and to seal up the vision
[16:01] five and a vision of prophecy and to
[16:04] anoint the most holy
[16:05] six that's exactly what
[16:08] he came to telling that would be done
[16:12] and then the end would be now tonight
[16:15] we'll get what those things are and see
[16:17] how close we are to there
[16:18] and then next sunday bring in and place
[16:21] these time
[16:22] elements ever exactly where we're
[16:24] standing
[16:25] hallelujah i love him amen
[16:30] israel returning to their homeland
[16:33] israel let me just say this now what i
[16:36] guess it's off the table
[16:39] let me say this the very hour
[16:42] that israel become a nation
[16:46] the reason i've always believed for my
[16:48] clasher
[16:49] that there was something that i'd have
[16:51] apart
[16:54] before i die of getting israel
[16:58] back to the lord because the very
[17:04] hour by the pan american chart
[17:08] that israel was declared a nation for
[17:11] the first time
[17:12] for 2 000 years since it's been
[17:14] scattered not a people
[17:15] it was that very same hour exactly to
[17:19] the hour
[17:19] that the angel lord met me up on her and
[17:21] sent me to the with the gospel
[17:24] amen the very same name
[17:29] may the seventh 19 and 46
[17:33] now then another thing that gives me
[17:37] good no
[17:38] it's restoring the hearts of the
[17:40] children
[17:42] back to the bond and the hearts of the
[17:46] fathers
[17:47] to the children the message
[17:51] notice malachi 4 not 3 4
[17:54] another thing when billy my son and i
[17:58] brother aaron baxter was on our road to
[18:01] palestine
[18:02] after we had met the jews at brother
[18:05] oregon writes
[18:07] and they seen the meeting louis petras
[18:10] had sent these bibles over there and he
[18:11] said
[18:12] these jews come said if you will call up
[18:15] a bunch of the leaders of israel i mean
[18:19] not these new rabbis with all their
[18:21] ceremonies but call the real israelite
[18:25] leaders together
[18:28] and we have read this new testament and
[18:31] we know
[18:32] that when the messiah cometh he'll tell
[18:35] us these things
[18:37] like the woman at samaria we know that
[18:40] moses said our messiah would be a
[18:42] prophet
[18:45] and when you can tell them and show them
[18:48] by the scripture
[18:49] that which we will get in tonight's
[18:50] message that they
[18:52] had to be darkened and their hearts cut
[18:54] off so that the gentile space could come
[18:56] that we'd have a time of reconciliation
[18:58] for the gentiles and their hearts were
[19:00] hardened just exactly like it was the
[19:02] time of joseph and so forth
[19:04] and then bring those jews to a place and
[19:08] call those men from that audience
[19:11] just like you do the gentile church by
[19:13] that inspiration
[19:14] of the spirit because they said if this
[19:17] jesus
[19:18] if he is a messiah and your words are
[19:21] true then he
[19:22] is not dead and he's alive
[19:25] and if he's alive he promised to be in
[19:28] his the
[19:29] servants his disciples and if we can see
[19:33] him do the sign
[19:35] of the prophet then we will believe that
[19:37] he is messiah
[19:41] what a perfect thing
[20:06] and i was on my road and stood at cairo
[20:09] egypt with the ticket in my hand
[20:12] and 15 or 20 minutes of calling time
[20:16] just fixed to make the call and i walked
[20:18] down to see a little piece of this
[20:20] ebony with a little elephant made out of
[20:22] ebony
[20:23] with the uh ivory tusk i was going to
[20:26] send it to a doctor friend of mine dr
[20:28] sam adair for a paperweight and i was
[20:32] looking at it and something said to me
[20:33] this is not yet the hour stay
[20:37] out of palestine
[20:41] so i thought that was just me thinking
[20:43] that i went on
[20:44] something said this is not the hour and
[20:47] i went out behind the hangar
[20:49] i raised up my head to god i said god
[20:52] was that you speaking to me said
[20:53] this is not the hour stay out of
[20:56] palestine
[20:58] this is not the time then i cut my
[21:01] ticket and
[21:02] changed it and went from there up to
[21:05] rome
[21:06] and come back to lisbon and portuguese
[21:09] and from there
[21:10] back to the united states the hour was
[21:13] not yet
[21:14] the iniquity of the gentiles hasn't
[21:16] filled up yet
[21:17] just to the end of the cup but someday
[21:19] that'll be
[21:20] and god will send somebody there
[21:25] that's a prophet and will prove to them
[21:28] i trust that god will raise him up right
[21:30] away whoever he may be
[21:32] that'll raise him quickly i believe it
[21:34] has to come
[21:35] that's what we're studying this far that
[21:37] we're so close and remember the very
[21:40] minute that the jews receive christ
[21:44] the gentile church is gone
[21:47] then the gentiles has the plagues poured
[21:49] out upon them the tribulation
[21:51] and how can man great teachers teach
[21:54] and look at this bible like this and say
[21:56] that the church goes through the
[21:58] tribulation period
[22:00] when there's not a scripture in the
