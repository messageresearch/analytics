[35:55] we could just sing of his goodness over
[35:58] and over and over and over praise the
[36:02] Lord because he has been so so good amen
[36:06] don't stand to your feet I would just
[36:09] want to read few scriptures to you this
[36:12] morning we've been speaking about the
[36:14] burning power and little by little
[36:20] trying to bring out you know what what
[36:23] has been on my heart but this morning we
[36:28] have a different kind of service and
[36:32] believing that the Holy Spirit will come
[36:34] out and be a blessing to us all most
[36:38] especially to to our young people praise
[36:41] the Lord
[36:42] amen Saint John chapter 6 let's look
[36:46] there quickly like I see a saying you
[36:47] see
[36:48] and for the mother farm another one
[36:52] preaching this morning so you can rest
[36:55] assure that you will have a good
[36:58] preacher than me amen
[37:00] praise the Lord
[37:03] Prison or email but in st. John chapter
[37:08] 6 Jesus says something I've been
[37:11] thinking about it all through the week
[37:14] as I have been speaking on this subject
[37:17] of the bound in power he said in in
[37:21] verse 37 if you want to look there
[37:25] closely with me in verse 35 Jesus said
[37:30] unto them I am the bread of life that
[37:33] cometh and he that cometh to me shall
[37:36] never hunger and he that believeth on me
[37:40] shall never thirst but I said unto you
[37:43] that you also have seen me and I believe
[37:48] now all that the father has given me
[37:53] that's what the burning power is for
[37:58] amen this is a parental statement this
[38:04] is a claiming power jesus said all that
[38:09] the father has given me shall come to me
[38:12] and him that cometh to me I will in no
[38:18] wise cast out all that the father has
[38:25] given to me
[38:26] praise the Lord amen now jesus said this
[38:32] to be to claim his own
[38:37] now if Christ is in you you can see the
[38:40] same thing amen
[38:43] if Christ is in you you can you can see
[38:48] the same thing now this is not just a
[38:50] male words this is a word of
[38:53] relationship I mean Jesus had a
[38:59] relationship with the father to be able
[39:02] to claim all that the father has given
[39:05] to him he said all that the father has
[39:09] given to me will come unto me and him
[39:13] that cometh to me I will in no wise cast
[39:16] out
[39:18] praise the Lord amen so so get ready for
[39:24] that that's my next series of messages I
[39:26] will be preaching all that the father
[39:28] has given me so you can claim there for
[39:33] your marriage you can claim there for
[39:35] your children
[39:35] you can claim that and as a preacher I'm
[39:38] claiming there for every souls that come
[39:40] on in my ministry praise the Lord
[39:46] but you see you first have to have a
[39:48] relationship with the father as I
[39:51] chapter 49 verse 16 let's look at their
[39:54] quickly
[39:54] [Music]
[40:07] now in the we talk about the the bonny
[40:10] power now you can understand what we're
[40:12] talking about praise the Lord because
[40:16] that's the power that has been given to
[40:18] the church that was whoever we burn on
[40:20] earth whatsoever we bound to keep amen
[40:25] whatever we bound to claim will be bound
[40:32] are we together as I a chapter 49 verse
[40:36] [Music]
[40:41] 13 sing o heaven and be joyful all earth
[40:45] break forth into singing all mountains
[40:49] for the Lord has comforted his people
[40:53] and will have mercy upon his afflicted
[40:57] him in but Zion said the Lord has
[41:00] forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me
[41:05] can a woman forget her suckling child
[41:10] that she should not have compassion on
[41:14] the son of her warm oh my goodness amen
[41:18] praise the Lord we have a parable that
[41:23] stays or yeah the parable that says
[41:25] there is no Bible for a child
[41:28] amen a mother don't have a Bible to draw
[41:30] her child no matter how worse he is he
[41:35] stays mama baby praise the Lord
[41:39] a woman cannot forsake her chuckling
[41:41] yeah they yeah they may be forgetting
[41:46] yet will I not forget thee behold I have
[41:52] engraving be upon the palms of my hands
[41:59] the walls are continuously before me
[42:03] praise the Lord and this is the word of
[42:07] God to Israel this is the Word of God to
[42:10] his redeemed people amen
[42:14] even though we we live in such an age
[42:17] where motherhood has fallen and then we
[42:21] have in order some of the things that we
[42:22] have before us of mother but God sees
[42:25] even though if a mother ever go to that
[42:27] place yet I God will net for safety and
[42:31] and as we know in the scripture every
[42:34] time God use a language where he
[42:37] positioned himself as as a mother or as
[42:40] a female is always a redemption language
[42:44] why because promise of the Redeemer was
[42:47] given to the woman the woman seizure
[42:50] bruised the head of the seven so when
[42:52] Jesus said all Israel how I will have
[42:55] power you like a hand
[42:58] that's Redemption language a mother will
[43:01] forsake her child I will not forsake
[43:03] thee that's redemption language for I
[43:06] have grieve indeed upon the palm of my
[43:08] hand and he he he did it physically when
[43:12] he was kneel on the cross as I a prophet
[43:16] sad about it but he did it physically
[43:19] every every Roman nail that went through
[43:22] his hands your name was engraved on the
[43:25] palm of his hands praise the Lord
[43:29] amen amen amen
[43:32] so all that the father has given me will
[43:35] come unto me and I want amen that will
[43:41] come that will ever last
[43:44] so that's what we've been talking in
[43:46] this season and I just want to say here
[43:49] to you
[43:51] you know it is just like my camel
[43:53] experience Elijah said all things is
[43:57] ready I believe that that everything is
[44:01] ready for us to be able to have a
[44:03] breakthrough from God amen
[44:06] everything is ready for a revival
[44:08] everything is ready for God to be able
[44:11] to prove his self again the only thing
[44:13] that is left as a people that was
[44:16] surrounded God has everything ready the
[44:21] heaven is so set to break fall to the
[44:24] earth
[44:26] dangers are anxious to run into your
[44:29] mess but he's waiting for the people
[44:31] that I ready because if you are not

[51:39] at you you what I don't know it's a
[51:43] different key than what we were just
[51:44] singing I think he wasn't looking at me
[51:49] when he took me in how many's thankful
[51:52] for this this morning he wasn't looking
[51:54] at my heart that was back by sea
[52:00] no he was looking at the blonde
[52:04] blowing rich and free
[52:08] they're precious love
[52:12] that covers me
[52:15] he wasn't looking at me
[52:19] when it took
[52:22] he wasn't looking at my heart that was
[52:27] black spicy

[52:34] when Jeffrey
[52:37] never
[52:40] that govern me sing it one more time

[52:44] oh he wasn't looking at me
[52:48] any third
[52:50] in the Lord all the looking at my
[52:55] now
[52:57] but they
[52:58] he was
[53:02] [Music]
[53:06] treasure
[53:09] that cover can be
[53:15] amen you may be seated this morning just
[53:17] for a minute here amen praise Lord I
[53:21] love that song and it's you know it's
[53:23] funny because we start to think you
[53:27] cannot gain God's favor by your works
[53:31] that's living under works if we're
[53:34] coming to God saying oh well I've done
[53:36] this then God can't accept me or I've
[53:40] done this God should accept me you
[53:42] that's not the way it works we're coming
[53:44] under the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[53:46] that that God that the Son of God who
[53:49] knew no sin became sin for us that we
[53:53] could become the very righteousness of
[53:55] God we become worthy because he made us
[53:59] worthy and so if you don't feel worthy
[54:01] this morning I don't feel worthy either
[54:04] this morning I don't at all
[54:07] I don't feel worthy every mistake I've
[54:09] ever made comes to my mind before I get
[54:12] up and preach every mistake that it just
[54:14] comes to like you've done this you're
[54:16] this you've done this but that's not my
[54:18] identity he whom the Spirit has made
[54:21] free is free indeed that's my identity
[54:24] my identity is found in Christ my
[54:27] identity is not found in my past or even
[54:29] in my worries about the future it's not
[54:32] based upon this body of flesh it's what
[54:35] God said it's not what what I mind or my
[54:37] memories or my imagination says it's
[54:40] what God said about me let God's Word be
[54:45] true in every man's word a lie and you
[54:48] need to find that in yourself that you
[54:51] can grab hold on that that it doesn't
[54:53] matter it doesn't matter what our minds
[54:56] say we we like Jobe said though he slay
[55:01] me yet I'll serve him job was going
[55:03] through a rough time he you look at it
[55:06] the entire passage we only remember that
[55:09] he's complaining to God the entire book
[55:11] so God what's the deal the entire book
[55:14] yet something within him said though he
[55:18] slave me slay me yet I'll serve him
[55:21] you saying god I don't understand I
[55:25] don't understand what's going on but
[55:27] I'll still serve you I'll still serve
[55:29] you he found that place he found his
[55:32] identity in the Word of God praise the
[55:35] Lord Amen so praise the Lord
[55:40] let's have church this morning amen
[55:42] praise Lord amen I appreciate the
[55:46] presence of God in here this morning I'm
[55:48] ready to have Church I hope you brought
[55:50] your your licks of fire this morning you
[55:53] can just take that clock down now
[55:54] because I'm not even gonna look at it
[55:56] I'm not I'm not kidding I don't know how
[55:59] this sermon is gonna go it's been on my
[56:01] heart for a long time I tried to write
[56:03] notes in an outline and it's like I just
[56:06] can't you can't take your heart and put
[56:08] it into logic you can kind of write an
[56:10] outline but it's like I'm just gonna
[56:12] preach from my heart this morning or or
[56:14] testify from my heart I don't really
[56:16] know I'm just trusting God that um that
[56:19] he's going to lead and guide this
[56:23] morning as with every service you know
[56:26] we come here I was thinking Wednesday
[56:28] night we had a great service and I just
[56:31] loved the way everything dovetailed
[56:32] together the song service dad testifying
[56:34] the word and it's like you know I think
[56:37] sometimes people think I'm really proud
[56:38] of her the Lawrence the way he's getting
[56:40] it's it's it's going in those stages of
[56:44] learning to follow God follow the
[56:47] leadership of the Spirit because it's
[56:48] not calculated um which you guys can be
[56:50] seated by the way sorry um it's not a
[56:53] calculated like okay I'm gonna sing this
[56:55] song this is gonna make people cry and
[56:57] then I'm gonna sing this song is just
[56:58] gonna make people excited that's not
[57:00] what it is at all I think people don't
[57:02] realize that as as worship leaders and
[57:05] things like that we're just as surprised
[57:08] as you are some like I was thinking
[57:10] about Wednesday I was like man I was not
[57:12] expecting to be out in the aisle tonight
[57:13] I just came from you know working out
[57:15] and working it's like God comes and
[57:17] moves and it's as we're able to yield to
[57:20] that spirit I love what brother but one
[57:22] set is that the spirit is here I believe
[57:25] that this area is ripe it is ready
[57:29] there's something going on here and it
[57:32] is ready and
[57:34] have to be yielded and paying attention
[57:37] paying attention to what God wants to do
[57:40] in our lives and as an assembly God is
[57:44] moving it's the same God all along you
[57:47] know we look back in the Bible and we
[57:49] see them and it's like it's it's so
[57:51] compressed you it's just a summary right
[57:54] of all the things that God did and we
[57:56] don't think about the space in-between
[57:57] we don't think about Abraham getting up
[58:00] in the morning with his aching body and
[58:01] his aching back and he's just like Lord
[58:05] you know he's trying he's encouraging
[58:07] himself in the Lord he's reconnecting
[58:10] you look at the struggles that he went
[58:11] where they went through with Sarah
[58:14] recommending Hagar basically like hey we
[58:17] can find a way we're bringing our human
[58:19] reasoning in this into this to make the
[58:22] move of God happen you those struggles
[58:25] those human struggles that happen and we
[58:27] all have the same thing in our own lives
[58:30] we're learning to walk and to wait upon
[58:33] God to go with him as he leads so um
[58:37] we're just gonna jump in into the word
[58:39] here and let's so go ahead and stand and
[58:42] we'll read a couple passages and then
[58:43] we'll just jump in and I just trust
[58:46] please pray for me this morning like I
[58:48] said I'm just trusting the Lord on this
[58:51] we'll go to Psalms 1 it's a very
[58:57] familiar passage we always we've heard
[58:59] this a million times but as I always say
[59:01] our trying to always say when I preach
[59:03] is I want us to take these scriptures as
[59:05] if we've never heard them before because
[59:07] then we'll pay attention to what they're
[59:09] saying we get so familiar with
[59:12] scriptures that we don't we're not even
[59:13] listening we just hear they're like oh
[59:15] yeah I know that says we can almost at
[59:17] work we're counted by heart we want to
[59:20] stop and listen and really let that word
[59:22] soak in if you're there say amen amen
[59:26] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[59:29] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[59:31] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[59:33] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[59:36] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[59:39] does he meditate day and night and he
[59:42] shall be planted he shall be like a tree
[59:44] planted by the rivers of water that
[59:46] bringeth forth he
[59:47] fruit in his season his leaf also shall
[59:50] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[59:53] prosper and let's go ahead and turn over
[59:55] to Ecclesiastes 9 where's the Lord amen
[1:00:08] and we'll go from verse just first 10
[1:00:12] here whatsoever thy hand findeth to do
[1:00:15] do it with thy might and that's it let's
[1:00:19] pray dear Lord
[1:00:20] father we come before you Lord God once
[1:00:23] again this morning not standing in our
[1:00:25] own strength and certainly not Lord God
[1:00:27] father
[1:00:27] I love the passage of scripture where
[1:00:29] you said you you remember our frame that
[1:00:32] we're but dust after this flesh we are
[1:00:34] just dust Lord God and father we're not
[1:00:37] putting our trust or our faith or our
[1:00:38] ability or our hopes and in this this
[1:00:42] body of flesh Lord God Father were
[1:00:44] trusting you that you would come this
[1:00:46] morning
[1:00:46] anoint the word Lord God used these lips
[1:00:49] Lord God and use our ears father may we
[1:00:52] pay attention to what you're trying to
[1:00:54] speak to us this morning Lord God father
[1:00:56] Lord God if there's any needs Lord God
[1:00:58] that would be in any heart Lord God I
[1:01:00] just pray that even if you would take me
[1:01:01] off course and it's talking about
[1:01:03] something else Lord God that it would be
[1:01:05] to minister to someone in their very
[1:01:07] need exactly to where they are today
[1:01:10] we're just committed into your hands now
[1:01:12] father we love you lord we appreciate
[1:01:14] you father the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:01:17] amen you may be seated
[1:01:20] amen it's good to have Ariel back with
[1:01:23] us again it's such a treat to have him
[1:01:24] twice in a row
[1:01:25] heard him playing it was like oh good
[1:01:27] praise God so it's nice to see you amen
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:31] I'm just want to comment real quick just
[1:01:33] during the prayer I thought about this
[1:01:34] is if you if you hear and this is mainly
[1:01:37] to the young people if you hear
[1:01:39] something that God something comes to
[1:01:42] your heart and your you were just
[1:01:45] thinking about that you you were just
[1:01:48] thinking about that you were just
[1:01:50] pondering it or something strikes in
[1:01:52] your heart I know for myself I know when
[1:01:54] God is working on me you're you just
[1:01:57] feel it you can't there it's stick
[1:02:00] something sticks
[1:02:01] your heart don't run from it accept it
[1:02:05] because you're not gonna get away you
[1:02:07] are not going to get away it is going to
[1:02:09] stick with you and it will haunt you it
[1:02:12] will stay with you no matter what you
[1:02:15] try to do to get away from it it will
[1:02:17] absolutely stay with you absolutely so
[1:02:22] what we're going to talk about and this
[1:02:24] is a different kind of sermon like I
[1:02:25] said just a bear with me pray for me
[1:02:27] it's this has been on my heart for a
[1:02:29] long time and I've just I'm just
[1:02:31] trusting God that he'll have his way and
[1:02:34] that it will be a blessing somehow I
[1:02:36] don't really know how it's all going to
[1:02:38] come together but I wanted to take some
[1:02:41] time and there there's it's kind of a
[1:02:43] sermon kind of a testimony it's a
[1:02:45] testimony confession encouragement and
[1:02:48] exhortation all at the same time just to
[1:02:51] zoom back and to talk about a little bit
[1:02:54] of my story and not not I pray afraid so
[1:02:57] many times like God I'm not here to be
[1:02:59] self ingratiating or proud I'm not here
[1:03:03] for sympathy but I feel led to to talk
[1:03:06] about it to talk about my story and I
[1:03:08] hope that this speaks to the young
[1:03:09] people and the old people because we're
[1:03:12] all young we're all we're all children
[1:03:14] in our hearts we just get we just our
[1:03:17] body ages there are some things that you
[1:03:20] know I look at myself at pictures from
[1:03:21] when I was a kid and it's like we are we
[1:03:26] just find guises and masks and we
[1:03:28] thought we grow of course but there are
[1:03:30] there are certain characteristics about
[1:03:32] us that are exactly the same as when you
[1:03:34] were a child
[1:03:35] exactly you're not any different you
[1:03:39] think about the way you thought about
[1:03:40] things or observed things and those
[1:03:42] conclusions that you made about the
[1:03:45] world and about life grow because this
[1:03:48] is true then this is true then this is
[1:03:50] true and this is true and if it's
[1:03:52] correct praise God but if it's wrong it
[1:03:55] takes the absolute grace of Almighty God
[1:03:58] to go back and fix that to go back and
[1:04:02] to take the conclusions we made as a
[1:04:04] child and to change them say that's not
[1:04:08] the way it is at all it's not the way it
[1:04:10] is at all but because of something that
[1:04:12] happened to us
[1:04:14] brother branham you had talked about
[1:04:15] this and they there's a lot of science
[1:04:17] behind this as well is that you look at
[1:04:19] someone until they're about seven years
[1:04:21] old and you'll find out who that person
[1:04:23] is going to be later in life all of the
[1:04:27] seeds are there they're all there and
[1:04:29] those are the things that that manifest
[1:04:31] later in life and so um young people
[1:04:34] this is for you too it's with you're
[1:04:36] paying attention paying attention you
[1:04:40] might not understand all of it but pay
[1:04:43] attention you might just get something
[1:04:46] that catches hold and it will stick with
[1:04:48] you for the rest of your life not in a
[1:04:50] haunting way but in a positive way that
[1:04:52] it will keep you it will guard you it
[1:04:54] will guide you because you can't let go
[1:04:57] of it it's got a hold of you so pay
[1:05:00] attention listen to that um so I wanted
[1:05:03] to talk about that and then also go into
[1:05:05] a little bit about the church and the
[1:05:06] assembly here it's wonderful to see a
[1:05:08] full congregation here
[1:05:12] it's so wonderful praise God like this
[1:05:15] is this is amazing this is amazing so
[1:05:19] part of my reason for wanting to go into
[1:05:21] this is to for those of you that are
[1:05:24] have been here for five years or you
[1:05:26] know maybe a little bit longer is to
[1:05:28] zoom back but there's a song called it's
[1:05:31] dripping with blood this Holy Ghost
[1:05:32] gospel is dripping with blood we have
[1:05:35] this book because people sacrificed and
[1:05:38] it's the same thing the only reason why
[1:05:41] this church is here is because people
[1:05:42] sacrificed people died in a sense they
[1:05:47] fought for this place because we believe
[1:05:50] that God still had something to do here
[1:05:53] in Minnesota there was still a work to
[1:05:56] be done and and I just want to peel that
[1:05:59] layer back to say that for those of you
[1:06:01] that maybe don't know or don't don't
[1:06:03] remember it's not a guilt trip it's to
[1:06:05] say here is the here's of the cross
[1:06:08] we've been carrying join us here's the
[1:06:12] mantle here's the vision yeah this is
[1:06:15] what your forefathers fought for join us
[1:06:18] don't just come to church don't just
[1:06:21] don't just show up don't just show up be
[1:06:25] a part of it who
[1:06:27] grab hold of it because God wants to
[1:06:29] move here he wants to move here and he
[1:06:34] absolutely has and he can and he will
[1:06:38] he's here today so I'm just gonna take
[1:06:42] my Liberty and I'm just gonna preach it
[1:06:43] and we're just bear with me and if I
[1:06:47] just bear with me if I see eyes gazing
[1:06:50] over I'm gonna have everyone stand up
[1:06:51] maybe we'll sing a song and then we're
[1:06:53] gonna keep going that's just that's the
[1:06:56] way it is until I feel like God is sunk
[1:06:58] it in we're gonna go for it
[1:07:00] praise the Lord so for myself I was five
[1:07:05] years old when we when we came to this
[1:07:07] church hey you guys remember this stuff
[1:07:10] it's it's amazing I remember these were
[1:07:13] offices there were there were like
[1:07:15] cubicles and stuff this is an old gas
[1:07:17] station out here and they had turned it
[1:07:18] into an insurance agency and we had
[1:07:21] before this it's a long story but we'll
[1:07:23] just start there five years old I
[1:07:26] remember working on this and it I
[1:07:28] remember seeing what's behind all these
[1:07:30] walls and like there there's still like
[1:07:32] rebar and stuff like this if a bomb went
[1:07:34] off over there we'd actually probably
[1:07:35] all be fine because these walls are
[1:07:38] incredibly strong they were designed
[1:07:39] because it was a gas station that if
[1:07:40] something happened out there
[1:07:41] it would withstand some kind of that
[1:07:44] impact at least as far as my knowledge
[1:07:45] goes I was a kid so once again that was
[1:07:47] an assumption that I made as a child
[1:07:49] like oh these will be fine
[1:07:51] yeah Jordan's back there shaking his
[1:07:55] head just kidding
[1:07:57] five years old and and you know it was a
[1:08:00] new church you were as exciting all that
[1:08:02] all that stuff and I remember just just
[1:08:04] you know being a part of it and we had
[1:08:06] left a previous assembly where you know
[1:08:08] at that time I left a lot of my friends
[1:08:10] as a child that's a big deal you know
[1:08:12] you're my best friend at the time was in
[1:08:14] that church and it's and it's like you
[1:08:17] know what do you do you you pick up and
[1:08:19] you just try to make new friends and
[1:08:20] thankfully as a little kid that's pretty
[1:08:22] easy because every well you know really
[1:08:24] I'm about the same height okay all right
[1:08:27] we can play tag I'm probably faster than
[1:08:29] you so you know and I was here and
[1:08:33] praise God you know of course dad was
[1:08:35] the song later then and mom mom did
[1:08:37] Sunday school which I remember those
[1:08:38] things and I've said this before is that
[1:08:40] Sunday school is a big deal I remember
[1:08:42] those things I remember those things
[1:08:44] that were taught
[1:08:45] they absolutely stuck with me and and I
[1:08:48] just want to commend mom and those that
[1:08:51] are helping out with that cuz that that
[1:08:52] is an amazing it's a ministry it's
[1:08:55] absolutely a ministry and it's a
[1:08:57] wonderful thing so um then I was when I
[1:09:01] was 10 I remember this distinctly I was
[1:09:02] parked back in the sound room on a
[1:09:04] Wednesday night someone's like hey you
[1:09:05] can probably do this like just turn this
[1:09:07] up and do that and back then it's like
[1:09:09] this has come a long way this has come a
[1:09:12] long long way that mean that there was
[1:09:15] like a hole in the wall back there that
[1:09:16] window wasn't there was just like a
[1:09:18] small little box window that whole place
[1:09:20] was just filled with junk and there was
[1:09:22] these sound boards and like the old
[1:09:24] video camera and stuff and and we were
[1:09:25] we were you know we're doing what we
[1:09:27] could with what we had at the time back
[1:09:29] in the 1990's kids 1990s this is
[1:09:33] basically ancient history you you're
[1:09:35] gonna read about the 90s in your
[1:09:37] textbook someday it's true yeah there's
[1:09:41] Seuss before this is before smartphones
[1:09:43] believe it or not I remember as a kid
[1:09:47] the first time I went on the Internet
[1:09:49] I literally do is like wow www dot
[1:09:52] that's a website I've heard about these
[1:09:56] isn't that weird that's how old I am so
[1:09:58] I'm almost 30 praise the Lord so I was
[1:10:01] 10 years old they parked me in the sound
[1:10:03] room and and um you know I just did it I
[1:10:05] enjoyed it I enjoyed being back there
[1:10:07] and and you know I was just a kid I
[1:10:09] would goof off back there and you know
[1:10:11] just pretend that I was you know I'm
[1:10:13] just you know I do the sound but it's
[1:10:14] like you're drawing back there you're
[1:10:16] talking to your friends and all that
[1:10:18] stuff which I know all you young kids
[1:10:19] are doing - you know back there and
[1:10:21] stuff like that and um you know it is
[1:10:24] what it is
[1:10:24] but pay attention you know listen I mean
[1:10:27] you're your kid it's it is what it is um
[1:10:30] but try to pay attention um I did have a
[1:10:33] hunger in my heart for God I was
[1:10:35] baptized I believe at 12 originally and
[1:10:37] I thought I was gonna go to hell like
[1:10:38] all the time I was I was just one of
[1:10:40] those people that like I was like I'm
[1:10:42] definitely going to hell okay
[1:10:43] I always had that that feeling of like
[1:10:46] man I'm a terrible person I'm definitely
[1:10:48] if anyone's going to hell like man I
[1:10:49] hope we don't get in a car accident I'm
[1:10:51] going to hell just stuff like that
[1:10:54] that hangs around your mind and and I
[1:10:56] had that and I was baptized at 12 and
[1:10:58] then um you know just a heart for God
[1:11:01] but not really knowing you know what to
[1:11:03] do I tried to be a good a good kid a
[1:11:06] good Pharisee because until you until
[1:11:10] you're filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:12] truly born again that's the best you can
[1:11:14] give is be got become a good imitator a
[1:11:17] great Pharisee look at my suit look at
[1:11:20] my clothes look look at the way that I
[1:11:22] never swear I never you know any of this
[1:11:25] stuff that is they are not a Christian
[1:11:28] no you're not you're a good Pharisee
[1:11:31] until it comes brother branham said that
[1:11:34] sheep don't manufacture wool they barrel
[1:11:37] until you come to the point where it
[1:11:39] automatically now not to say you don't
[1:11:42] see God and you're all those stuff all
[1:11:43] that stuff but it comes out of the
[1:11:46] desire of your heart where it actually
[1:11:48] comes out of you not on you when that's
[1:11:52] the point you have to get to where not
[1:11:55] because anyone else said it it actually
[1:11:58] comes out of you and until that point
[1:12:00] you're not your you're professing it now
[1:12:03] that's good and that's fine but seek
[1:12:05] more seek him because there is more so I
[1:12:09] was a good Pharisee and I was 12 and uh
[1:12:12] I remember I remember I was back in the
[1:12:16] sound room and later on I mean this is a
[1:12:19] couple years went by I was 14 I was
[1:12:20] sitting back in the sound room and you
[1:12:23] know my friends the pastors kids Daniel
[1:12:26] and Josh would sit back there with me
[1:12:27] and we would talk about video games and
[1:12:29] stuff like that that you shouldn't talk
[1:12:30] about in church but we would you know we
[1:12:32] were sneaking around
[1:12:33] and looking at you kids no just kidding
[1:12:36] oh we know what you're doing I'm just
[1:12:40] kidding um he's I was 14 and I remember
[1:12:46] we had a security camera back there and
[1:12:48] I looked back and I saw my friend Daniel
[1:12:50] sitting back in the back and I knew
[1:12:52] something was wrong
[1:12:53] something was wrong and my pastor came
[1:12:57] up Bruce painter and he stood behind
[1:12:59] this pulpit I guess I don't know if we
[1:13:00] had this pulpit then or not but we stood
[1:13:01] right here and he said that he was
[1:13:03] resigning he was resigning from the
[1:13:05] ministry and he hit there was a lot of
[1:13:07] anger a lot of
[1:13:07] a lot of different stuff I just remember
[1:13:09] being devastated absolutely devastated
[1:13:13] because his kids were my best friends
[1:13:15] absolute and this is after having lost
[1:13:17] you know as a kid my other best friends
[1:13:19] and now here it is it's like wow oh like
[1:13:22] here we go again that that feeling of
[1:13:25] just sinking feeling of like everything
[1:13:27] is about to change and it did there was
[1:13:30] a lot of conflict lots of in those of
[1:13:35] you that were here know the story we
[1:13:36] didn't have a pastor all of a sudden we
[1:13:38] went from having a pastor to not having
[1:13:40] a pastor I mean I don't know I think
[1:13:42] we've had like 35 people that were here
[1:13:44] at the time something like that I didn't
[1:13:46] I was 14 I wasn't counting at the time
[1:13:48] and over the course of time most of them
[1:13:52] left we had about 12 people here that
[1:13:56] were consistent were always here sister
[1:13:59] Christine was here sister Irene was here
[1:14:02] for the Steve and sister Kelly were here
[1:14:05] dad was here for the Juan came I on
[1:14:08] Sundays as well and there was a hole
[1:14:11] there was a pocket of people that still
[1:14:13] believed something was going on and we
[1:14:16] we ended up watching a lot of video
[1:14:18] services watch Geoff Jenkins from down
[1:14:21] in Ohio
[1:14:21] Bertha Lonnie a lot of different people
[1:14:23] and um we did what we could and I
[1:14:30] remember I remember um and just bear
[1:14:33] with me um this is all for a reason gods
[1:14:35] are you okay everyone okay because this
[1:14:38] this is personal stuff for me so I'm
[1:14:39] just going with it because I feel led to
[1:14:43] just speak on this I don't know how it's
[1:14:44] all gonna pan out I've prayed like God I
[1:14:47] don't this is different for me but I
[1:14:49] feel led to do it so I was um was gonna
[1:14:55] close that I'm just gonna speak and I'll
[1:14:57] open that up if I go so that happened
[1:15:02] and and the birth of a major trial for
[1:15:07] this assembly and for the people that
[1:15:08] were a part of this set assembly came
[1:15:10] about we didn't have a pastor this
[1:15:13] church did not have a pastor and as a
[1:15:16] kid I remember dad and I talked about
[1:15:18] this you know because we talked about
[1:15:20] moving we were like well should
[1:15:21] we move should we go somewhere else you
[1:15:23] know what should we do and I remember
[1:15:25] and I don't know how on earth God put
[1:15:26] this in my heart at the time Here I am
[1:15:28] my best friends now we still saw each
[1:15:30] other at that time every now and then
[1:15:33] but there was a lot of friction and
[1:15:36] brother Bruce like he was a face that
[1:15:39] will tell you I mean there was some
[1:15:40] things that happened like where he was
[1:15:41] like well will accommodate you guys and
[1:15:43] there was just like all kinds of like as
[1:15:46] a kid like you feel that pressure like
[1:15:47] someone does not like you very much and
[1:15:50] you just feel that it's like what's
[1:15:51] wrong with me what did I ever do and um
[1:15:54] and you have that and I remember dad and
[1:16:00] I were talking and I just said it and I
[1:16:02] believe that this has come to pass that
[1:16:04] dad the reason for deserts is so that
[1:16:10] the plants dig down deep their roots go
[1:16:14] down deep and they find they find that
[1:16:17] water they find whatever more shirt they
[1:16:19] can get and when the rain does come
[1:16:22] they're ready for it and I believe that
[1:16:26] that's come about by God's grace this
[1:16:28] this church that God allowed things to
[1:16:32] happen in a way to bring about growth
[1:16:35] bear with me you're still with me okay
[1:16:38] God allowed things to happen God allowed
[1:16:42] a major trial to bring about growth this
[1:16:46] church is a testimony absolutely a
[1:16:50] testimony I look at you know you look at
[1:16:53] the Bible David talks often about you
[1:16:57] know my foes encamped against me
[1:16:59] you know they've Nash up on me with
[1:17:00] their teeth basically they're saying
[1:17:01] you're about to die that's what people
[1:17:04] said about us you're about to die I
[1:17:06] remember because I started traveling at
[1:17:08] some point and I would hear people say
[1:17:10] oh that church they don't want a pastor
[1:17:12] that Church is having spiritual
[1:17:15] one-night stands with ministers coming
[1:17:17] through that affects you that affects
[1:17:22] you that is a hard thing to hear as a
[1:17:24] young person having people say that
[1:17:26] about your church and I knew that wasn't
[1:17:31] the truth
[1:17:32] we did we did we felt led that there was
[1:17:37] there was something to be done here
[1:17:39] there was still something to be done and
[1:17:41] we did we couldn't remember down brought
[1:17:43] through a lot of um and the trustee is
[1:17:45] his brother Steve dad brother Kozan
[1:17:49] they'd bring through a lot of Ministers
[1:17:50] sit again
[1:17:53] yes brother Steve brink as well oh yeah
[1:17:56] praise the Lord I love those guys I got
[1:17:58] to get down to Arizona and see them
[1:17:59] again so they finally got sick of the
[1:18:01] winters praise the Lord um yeah Jordan
[1:18:06] knows those guys so Orly Steve yeah down
[1:18:09] in the church there in Phoenix yeah is
[1:18:15] I'm just sharing it from my side cuz I
[1:18:18] know brother Steve is gonna have his
[1:18:19] side dad's gonna dad would have it their
[1:18:21] own stories about how all this came
[1:18:23] together but I want to speak at it as it
[1:18:25] from a young person from from a young
[1:18:28] person who grew up in the message and
[1:18:31] how did this happen I lost my friends
[1:18:34] they ended up when I was 17 and we spent
[1:18:37] a lot of time we did spend time together
[1:18:38] between 14 and 17 but when I was 17 they
[1:18:41] moved to Ohio and that was it I had no
[1:18:45] friends that was my last friend they
[1:18:48] were gone all the other youth all of the
[1:18:50] youth I think we had you know 20 30
[1:18:52] people all of them went to the world
[1:18:53] except one who's married to someone in
[1:18:55] the Hoffman's church all of them went to
[1:18:58] the world and I remember him faith and I
[1:19:00] we had each other we had each other and
[1:19:03] God allowed that and we became very very
[1:19:07] close and very strong because it's what
[1:19:11] do you do what do you do and around that
[1:19:16] time I remember cuz the painter had left
[1:19:20] I went to college what a perfect trap
[1:19:24] what a perfect trap you guys know how it
[1:19:28] is I know how it is
[1:19:30] I had no friends my friends had just
[1:19:33] left and I became incredibly popular you
[1:19:39] have no idea when I went to college I
[1:19:41] was home-schooled I never went to high
[1:19:42] school like with a bunch of other kids
[1:19:44] and
[1:19:46] i I was super self-conscious my entire
[1:19:50] life I always felt like I had to earn
[1:19:51] people's love like I just the way I'm
[1:19:54] caught mine I don't know I'm just I
[1:19:57] always felt like slightly on the outside
[1:19:59] of the other kids like I remember even
[1:20:03] as a kid getting on like I was like
[1:20:05] seven years old and they're all you know
[1:20:07] saying slangs and I'm just gonna say
[1:20:08] them because I know you kids
[1:20:10] well they said slangs for swear words
[1:20:13] and I'm not gonna okay I'm not gonna say
[1:20:15] them because I don't want kids to hear
[1:20:16] it slangs for swear words you know D
[1:20:19] this and and G this and you know oh my
[1:20:22] yeah that and it's like I remember as a
[1:20:24] kid getting on people's case like you
[1:20:26] shouldn't say that that's a swear word I
[1:20:28] looked it up it's in the dictionary
[1:20:29] because it is it's a euphemism for a
[1:20:32] swear word and it means the exact same
[1:20:34] thing it's like a watered down version
[1:20:36] it means the exact same thing and we
[1:20:39] shouldn't be running around saying those
[1:20:40] things because why on earth would we
[1:20:42] want to be cursing everyone everywhere
[1:20:43] we go why would we do that it's not
[1:20:47] helpful and and it's it's not right so
[1:20:51] um but I always felt like an outsider
[1:20:53] and so here I went to college my first
[1:20:56] class they gave us an assignment first
[1:20:59] day first class gave us an assignment
[1:21:01] and it was to make like a movie poster
[1:21:03] thinks I studied film and I remember I
[1:21:07] did I was like oh this is great this is
[1:21:10] easy like I went and did the assignment
[1:21:11] because I taught myself Photoshop and
[1:21:14] stuff before I even went to school and I
[1:21:17] handed it in and they printed that mount
[1:21:19] and they put all of them on the wall and
[1:21:21] they had everyone vote whose was best
[1:21:24] guess whose was best mine first class
[1:21:29] first assignment I was the best
[1:21:33] immediately I was the best and it's like
[1:21:37] wow I am good at this I am really good
[1:21:41] at this and I remember at the time
[1:21:43] making up in my mind like who I had to
[1:21:46] be in order to succeed I knew who I had
[1:21:49] to be as like I've got to go all out on
[1:21:51] this thing but I never missed Church
[1:21:53] thank God I made up I purposed in my
[1:21:56] heart to never miss Church I
[1:21:59] never missed Sunday I never miss
[1:22:00] Wednesday not one time in college not
[1:22:03] one time if it was on Wednesday I didn't
[1:22:05] sign up for the classes I missed I my
[1:22:09] partner and I we won the state
[1:22:11] championship for SkillsUSA which is a
[1:22:13] video competition and I didn't go to the
[1:22:16] reward ceremony because it was on Sunday
[1:22:18] I would have missed church and then we
[1:22:22] went in won nationals so thank God like
[1:22:25] it it ended up working out
[1:22:27] so um god I went into college and I
[1:22:35] became everywhere I went in the video
[1:22:37] deport like everyone knew who I was
[1:22:39] oh it's loyal he's the he's number one
[1:22:41] loyal can probably help you like that's
[1:22:43] was my reputation of constant I hosted
[1:22:46] like we had a Friday show one semester
[1:22:50] that I basically people could direct it
[1:22:53] and who they wanted as their talent to
[1:22:55] host it was a thirty minute segment I
[1:22:57] did it almost every single week because
[1:23:00] everyone wanted me in their stuff all
[1:23:02] the time all the time I was always in
[1:23:05] people's projects because I was really
[1:23:08] good at it you know or whatever you know
[1:23:09] it all happened and of course then you
[1:23:12] have the temptations that come behind it
[1:23:13] and thank God I was incredibly ignorant
[1:23:15] to like what was going on but it's like
[1:23:17] yeah people try to pick you up in
[1:23:18] college absolutely it happens all the
[1:23:20] time and it's like thank God like I was
[1:23:23] blind enough to like oh that's what
[1:23:25] happened like after it happened oh oh oh
[1:23:28] that's what they meant like oh yeah I
[1:23:31] wasn't thinking about that
[1:23:33] like I mean literally like stuff like
[1:23:35] that happens and there's those
[1:23:37] temptations those caught like thank God
[1:23:39] God made me ignorant not ignorant enough
[1:23:41] at the time that I didn't you know I
[1:23:42] just was like really didn't even think
[1:23:45] about it
[1:23:46] but but you know you you go through all
[1:23:49] that stuff and for me it's like I got so
[1:23:51] consumed you know I took critical
[1:23:54] thinking where there's a lot of the you
[1:23:56] know relative truth versus actual truth
[1:23:59] if they talk about Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:24:01] and how do we know that they weren't
[1:24:02] burned with fire for in hospital
[1:24:03] inhospitable 'no stats that's the theory
[1:24:06] is that oh well you know they they were
[1:24:08] cursed because they were wouldn't you
[1:24:10] know they wouldn't feed the a
[1:24:12] Jules are they you know all this that's
[1:24:13] the theory out there and you start to
[1:24:15] get all this stuff in your head and it's
[1:24:18] just like this constant you know I took
[1:24:20] sociology which also liked it like it
[1:24:22] just it strips down your belief system
[1:24:25] that's what it does I mean it's it's
[1:24:27] it's literally designed to do that um
[1:24:30] and like and I went through that so it's
[1:24:32] really popular kind of had all this
[1:24:34] stuff and once again thank God
[1:24:36] I never miss Church a never miss Church
[1:24:40] and I'll put that out as an
[1:24:42] encouragement
[1:24:43] don't miss Church don't miss Church
[1:24:46] obviously we have things come up there's
[1:24:48] there's a cow in the ditch but that's
[1:24:51] not a habit your cows running in the
[1:24:53] ditch all the time you need to build a
[1:24:55] fence around that thing set a boundary
[1:24:59] set a boundary I'm not gonna go there
[1:25:03] anymore I'm not gonna do that anymore
[1:25:05] I'm gonna find a way to not have that
[1:25:09] happen set a boundary and so I had this
[1:25:16] happen and I don't know I was all over
[1:25:20] the place but God got a hold of my life
[1:25:22] in a way I think in the in the in the
[1:25:25] because I didn't know like it was not so
[1:25:27] much that I was here because I was like
[1:25:28] I'm a fun fire for God
[1:25:30] it really wasn't I knew that it was true
[1:25:32] but it was kind of on the sidelines it
[1:25:33] was kind of on the back burner for me
[1:25:35] and I remember I was 18 years old and I
[1:25:38] went down to brother Frank craters
[1:25:40] church for some missionary meetings with
[1:25:42] Nate painter and my brother Steven and
[1:25:44] like it was on a whim they were like hey
[1:25:47] it was during the summer my summer break
[1:25:48] like hey you want to go down to tech to
[1:25:51] Arkansas yeah um thank you Arkansas and
[1:25:55] it's like when are you going this
[1:25:57] weekend is like what am I gonna do drop
[1:26:00] all of my plans is an 18 year old I
[1:26:01] wasn't doing anything anyways um I was
[1:26:04] planning on watching a movie but I ended
[1:26:09] up going and I remember like I remember
[1:26:12] this distinctly you know driving down
[1:26:14] and just like who's reconnecting like
[1:26:17] even just the drive down there it's like
[1:26:19] it was a blessing to me being with
[1:26:20] Steven and Nate and um you know I got
[1:26:23] down there and I remember
[1:26:25] distinctly the first night brother
[1:26:26] brother Jonathan Goff preach we've had
[1:26:28] him here before he's from Texas and I
[1:26:31] remember distinctly I remember being
[1:26:34] there and I I knew I wasn't right I knew
[1:26:37] I wasn't right and I felt like I don't
[1:26:40] you remember what he preached on like I
[1:26:42] don't
[1:26:43] I remember that one of his fingers is
[1:26:44] cut off like if you look at it like the
[1:26:46] tip of his finger because he's a
[1:26:48] construction guy and it's like I
[1:26:49] remember and I remember him and I loved
[1:26:51] him and when brother Jonathan and I
[1:26:52] still are we get along very well
[1:26:54] I knew it didn't even matter what he was
[1:26:57] preaching it was the atmosphere you know
[1:27:00] I'd come from being here where you know
[1:27:03] we were doing what we could but it's
[1:27:04] like you know a minister would come
[1:27:05] through and we'd be watching video
[1:27:07] services and God brought me out showed
[1:27:10] me something about myself got me away
[1:27:13] from the norm put me there I were like
[1:27:16] it wasn't even a big whopping service it
[1:27:18] was a few people there wasn't even a big
[1:27:19] deal but I remember we were sitting
[1:27:21] there and we were singing after the
[1:27:22] service knows like I know by the end of
[1:27:25] this weekend I'm gonna be down at that
[1:27:27] altar so I might as well go right now in
[1:27:30] my mind like I just knew it like I was
[1:27:32] in my conscious I was it was in my I
[1:27:34] just knew it I'm like I'm gonna go and
[1:27:36] so I did I'm not gonna wait for
[1:27:38] something to pull me more than I am NOT
[1:27:40] gonna wait for the emotions and all that
[1:27:42] stuff I know I'm not right something's
[1:27:44] wrong I need to get right and by God's
[1:27:47] grace like I just let go I went down to
[1:27:51] the altar and I let go and something
[1:27:53] happened something happened for me and
[1:27:56] it's it's not that I became a perfect
[1:27:58] Christian listen young people pay
[1:28:03] attention I'm gonna have a sing a song
[1:28:05] if we're not paying attention this is
[1:28:06] important it's for a reason I don't I'm
[1:28:09] sorry God I knew something had gotten
[1:28:15] ahold of my life if you need to stand up
[1:28:20] or whatever just go for it if you need
[1:28:22] to wake yourself up um
[1:28:24] doesn't bother me um God got ahold of my
[1:28:28] life it was it was like suddenly
[1:28:30] something changed in my heart my desire
[1:28:33] changed my desire changed and then I
[1:28:38] went into the worst time of my entire
[1:28:40] life up until that point I college and I
[1:28:45] went from being super like the top of
[1:28:48] the world everyone was like you're the
[1:28:49] you know voted most likely to succeed
[1:28:51] basically it's like you know and then I
[1:28:54] graduated college and if this is 2009
[1:28:56] this is right after the market crash of
[1:28:59] Oh a-and the Great Recession and all
[1:29:00] that stuff and it's like I couldn't find
[1:29:03] a job to save my life at the time I was
[1:29:05] interviewing a caribou coffee and I
[1:29:07] couldn't even get a job there at the
[1:29:09] time like and and that's just the way it
[1:29:11] was and I went I just spiraled into this
[1:29:13] horrible depression and ended up getting
[1:29:15] to the point where um where I got very
[1:29:19] addicted to movies thank god I've never
[1:29:21] done drugs or alcohol any things like
[1:29:23] that but it's like I lost myself it's
[1:29:25] like I was trying to just and I remember
[1:29:28] getting to this point where and this was
[1:29:30] however long it went where I realized it
[1:29:33] was a problem the desire of my heart was
[1:29:35] still there God had locked something in
[1:29:38] me but I gay I gave myself into all of
[1:29:41] this because I was hurting because I
[1:29:44] needed something and I couldn't find it
[1:29:46] I could I'd I had no friends I know at
[1:29:51] that time hardly I'd you know I'd hang
[1:29:53] out with Stephen and his friends
[1:29:54] sometimes but they were like way older
[1:29:56] and they're over at a different church
[1:29:57] and stuff like that and it's like um I
[1:29:59] was looking for something for communion
[1:30:02] for fellowship movies it's a proxy
[1:30:06] relationship you get to experience the
[1:30:09] joy of friends for two hours and then
[1:30:13] you unplug and it's like wow my life
[1:30:15] stinks that's exactly what it is it's
[1:30:19] exactly what it is now I'm not saying
[1:30:21] sometimes movies are great and God can
[1:30:23] use them I've had God speak to me
[1:30:24] personally through that but it depending
[1:30:27] on the person and the situation it can
[1:30:29] totally be every bit as bad as drugs are
[1:30:31] absolutely it can be and so I remember
[1:30:35] that like it it dawn like this is a
[1:30:38] problem but I couldn't stop I couldn't
[1:30:41] stop I knew I couldn't stop I tried I
[1:30:45] could not stop I'd watch five or six
[1:30:47] movies every single day every day every
[1:30:50] day
[1:30:52] yeah that's rough yeah I was not good
[1:30:54] and I remember I ended up going to I
[1:30:57] ended up going to Winnie youth the tree
[1:30:59] and long story short dawn came down and
[1:31:01] it was the weirdest thing for me like
[1:31:03] coming from here where there was like no
[1:31:06] one and I'll bring the twins into it cuz
[1:31:08] it Catherine or Annette ended up coming
[1:31:10] to church somewhere around this time but
[1:31:11] I went from having no young people my
[1:31:15] age to going to a camp or a retreat with
[1:31:19] 400 young people going from 0 to 400 I
[1:31:27] was like what like I didn't even know
[1:31:31] there's this many in the world like let
[1:31:33] alone at one camp all in one place thank
[1:31:36] God oh my goodness and God from that
[1:31:42] time and and I'm I'm gonna skip ahead
[1:31:45] because I'm taking too long just on
[1:31:46] these parts but these details but
[1:31:48] they're for someone
[1:31:49] sons of God are led by the Spirit of God
[1:31:51] this is for someone so if it's not for
[1:31:54] you pray for whoever needs to hear this
[1:31:57] someone needs to hear this I'm convinced
[1:31:59] too that someone needs to hear it and I
[1:32:03] went to camp and I remember it like just
[1:32:05] powerful preaching surrounded by young
[1:32:07] people and there's a beautiful thing
[1:32:08] about young people is that they're not
[1:32:09] set in their ways yet they're more
[1:32:12] they're open to receive they're oh and
[1:32:15] that's why Satan is all what brother
[1:32:17] Branham taught us this this is why
[1:32:18] Satan's trying to get them so hard
[1:32:20] because if they can get locked in you
[1:32:22] know by the time they're around 25
[1:32:24] they're very unlikely to change after
[1:32:26] that it's much harder to change once you
[1:32:29] hit around 25 but if God or Satan can
[1:32:32] get ahold of them yes so young people
[1:32:39] let God get ahold of you let him get
[1:32:42] ahold of you let him get ahold of you
[1:32:44] it's not about it's not about the works
[1:32:47] we think it's more like laws of nature
[1:32:52] we think of these things as these are
[1:32:54] the rules and this is what I have to do
[1:32:56] and if I'm this then I'm a good
[1:32:58] Christian if I walk this way if I dress
[1:33:00] this way while inside we are absolutely
[1:33:02] torn up because we're not who we are
[1:33:05] we're telling a lie were not actually
[1:33:09] living out the truth we're covering
[1:33:11] ourselves in a garment it's a fig leaf
[1:33:14] we're covering ourselves in a pharisee
[1:33:16] achill garment and inside were dying and
[1:33:18] no one can help us because we look so
[1:33:23] good we look the part no one can help us
[1:33:27] and we were so caught up in our own mind
[1:33:29] that were right yet we feel dead inside
[1:33:34] God there's a reality to it there's a
[1:33:41] reality it's not just rule this isn't an
[1:33:44] organization where we're all coming
[1:33:46] together just to get you know here's the
[1:33:48] ten principles of life and you know
[1:33:51] we're not just here to have have have a
[1:33:53] form of godliness
[1:33:55] I can go to Tony Robbins and get that
[1:33:58] the motivational speaker some of his
[1:34:01] content is excellent absolutely
[1:34:03] excellent but if all I'm looking for is
[1:34:05] 1/2 ways decent life there's a lot
[1:34:08] better places that I could go to and of
[1:34:11] course we know that there's no better
[1:34:12] way to live than the than God's Way but
[1:34:14] brother branham even said Buddhism is
[1:34:17] about as good as what we got he
[1:34:19] literally said that that's a direct
[1:34:20] quote they just don't have the blood
[1:34:24] they don't have the blood and there are
[1:34:27] lots of systems if you're just looking
[1:34:29] for something on your flesh or a way to
[1:34:31] you know ten steps to you to um you know
[1:34:35] a happier life there are plenty of
[1:34:38] systems out there there are plenty of
[1:34:40] ways there there are plenty of things
[1:34:42] that you can do broad is the way but we
[1:34:48] serve a real God a Living God there's a
[1:34:51] truth there's a life that goes beyond
[1:34:54] that there's a life that goes beyond
[1:34:58] that and God got a hold of my life got
[1:35:03] and and from that time I'm literally
[1:35:07] just getting started so if you need to
[1:35:09] go use the bathroom go use the bathroom
[1:35:11] this is all laying a foundation if if
[1:35:16] God got ahold of my life
[1:35:19] and I remember we were driving back from
[1:35:20] when he used to treat that year I hadn't
[1:35:23] even asked God to take away that my
[1:35:26] addiction for movies out of my heart and
[1:35:28] we were driving back and we were
[1:35:29] watching a movie on the laptop and it
[1:35:31] suddenly dawned on me I don't even want
[1:35:34] to watch this that what God can do it
[1:35:43] God can do it and it's this we all have
[1:35:47] our different poisons it's not that I
[1:35:48] don't watch at movies ever now it's
[1:35:50] still different though it's still
[1:35:53] different and I have my moments maybe a
[1:35:55] weakness or sometimes where it's fine
[1:35:56] some movies are great they're there no
[1:35:58] problem but God changed something for me
[1:36:03] personally I know that it happened no I
[1:36:06] was there no one else can convince me
[1:36:08] otherwise I didn't work it out I didn't
[1:36:11] go through these like here's how to
[1:36:12] detox your body and change your
[1:36:14] interests or whatever it happened and
[1:36:16] it's the same thing for you if you've
[1:36:18] got a weakness something that you just
[1:36:20] can't stay away from give it to God give
[1:36:25] it to God give it to God and LU and get
[1:36:29] ahold of him seek ye first the kingdom
[1:36:31] of God because the key thing here and
[1:36:33] this is what people don't what people
[1:36:36] don't understand about themselves and I
[1:36:39] don't on about others because it's so
[1:36:41] easy to judge someone when they start to
[1:36:44] go doing something drinking drugs women
[1:36:48] or men depending on who how it is all
[1:36:52] they're trying to do is they're hungry
[1:36:55] they're trying to satisfy a need and
[1:36:59] it's not always a need for God it's an
[1:37:03] actual need they're there they're
[1:37:06] looking to satisfy on one hand they do
[1:37:08] try to satisfy the need for God with
[1:37:10] something and God will will let you keep
[1:37:13] trying to fill that until you're ready
[1:37:14] to turn to Him nothing else can satisfy
[1:37:17] that the need for God but the need for a
[1:37:21] husband or a wife that's a need and
[1:37:24] people will try to satisfy it you think
[1:37:26] about it is we don't satisfy the need
[1:37:29] for hunger with water it'll help a
[1:37:32] little bit for a while
[1:37:33] but in the long run what your body needs
[1:37:35] is to eat it needs to eat and it's the
[1:37:39] same thing if we're if we're going to
[1:37:41] alcohol or drugs or movies or video
[1:37:43] games or or whatever your poison is
[1:37:45] everyone gambling there's a need that's
[1:37:49] driving that there's a need there's a
[1:37:51] desire there there's something in there
[1:37:54] that needs to be met either for more of
[1:37:58] God or for something like love
[1:38:04] admiration acceptance acceptance you
[1:38:12] look at it if you strip it back what
[1:38:14] everyone wants is to be loved and there
[1:38:17] are multiple ways you look at someone
[1:38:19] gambling right someone continuously
[1:38:20] habitually and I have not studied this
[1:38:22] this is just my kind of freewheeling
[1:38:24] with it is they wanna they they have
[1:38:27] they think they can win significant
[1:38:30] they're like I'm somebody I can win and
[1:38:33] if I win I'll be loved I'm important
[1:38:38] look at the prodigal son he had money he
[1:38:42] went out and was you know doing drugs
[1:38:44] and going out with I mean that's what he
[1:38:45] was doing it was living the party
[1:38:46] lifestyle he had all the friends what
[1:38:49] does all the friends actually mean what
[1:38:51] is a bad peer group actually mean you're
[1:38:54] looking for love you're looking for love
[1:39:01] seek you first the kingdom seek the true
[1:39:04] and the bad will fall away
[1:39:07] you can't just cross your fingers and
[1:39:10] say I'm not hungry I'm not hungry I'm
[1:39:12] not hungry I'm not hungry I'm not hungry
[1:39:13] I'm not hungry
[1:39:14] you could but it's gonna hurt you in the
[1:39:17] long run it's going to hurt you taking
[1:39:20] that need to God and He will guide you
[1:39:23] to what actually satisfies that need
[1:39:25] because there is an actual satisfaction
[1:39:28] behind that praise the Lord so God got
[1:39:32] ahold of my life and jumping back over
[1:39:34] to the church now so God got ahold of my
[1:39:38] life and around the same time Katherine
[1:39:41] Ornette the twin started coming back to
[1:39:43] church and and I remember
[1:39:46] Oh as soon as God started getting ahold
[1:39:49] of my life I started singing I just knew
[1:39:51] it I don't know why I just knew it like
[1:39:52] I'm called the sing I knew it as soon as
[1:39:55] God got ahold of my life like I'm called
[1:39:56] the sing and I ended up starting the
[1:39:58] song lead and dad kind of just started
[1:40:00] letting me do that more and um I was
[1:40:05] back in 2008 something like that 2009 I
[1:40:07] don't remember um when I started song
[1:40:09] leaning but I remember bear with me
[1:40:20] let's all stand real quick because I
[1:40:21] feel like the Energy's going down
[1:40:23] everybody stand up turn to the person

[1:41:27] so during this time we were down to
[1:41:29] about 12 people here at the church we're
[1:41:31] down 12 sometimes in some days we'd
[1:41:33] might have up to like 15 16 something

[1:41:40] sometimes in I like oh count count like
[1:41:42] oh but you know we we we persevered we
[1:41:46] continued to persevere and then I
[1:41:48] remember I started to lead songs and you
[1:41:51] know God having this fresh man in my
[1:41:53] heart's like God's done something with
[1:41:55] my heart I'm like alright I'm just gonna
[1:41:57] do this I'm gonna trust God and there's
[1:41:58] lots of shaky moments of the

[1:42:01] great doing just fine doing better than
[1:42:03] I did when I first started so um you
[1:42:06] know it's just like you're trying to
[1:42:07] figure all this stuff out and let God
[1:42:08] use you and the twins and myself and
[1:42:18] faith um Katherine ernet which you saw
[1:42:20] them here last Sunday and I'm just
[1:42:26] trying to transition into this next part
[1:42:30] god we started having a prayer meeting
[1:42:34] just the four of us just the young
[1:42:36] people we had a prayer meeting and Bible
[1:42:38] study we'd have it here sometimes we'd
[1:42:39] go to Caribou sometimes and you know God
[1:42:42] was working on their hearts and they
[1:42:43] started coming back to church and the
[1:42:46] four of us together was like just this
[1:42:48] little oasis of fellowship as young
[1:42:51] people like there weren't any other guys
[1:42:52] I mean John anfinsen my friend he came
[1:42:55] around for a while Danny Hartnett came
[1:42:56] around for a while there's a couple
[1:42:57] other young guys but they were in and
[1:42:59] out Adam Charbonneau came around he was
[1:43:01] the most liked with it and then he moved
[1:43:03] to Iowa you know like you know how hard
[1:43:05] that was for me when when when Adam
[1:43:07] moved I was like praise the Lord some
[1:43:09] fellowship love you buddy I'm moving to
[1:43:12] Iowa what like what like I've been
[1:43:15] praying for a friend you know if I'm
[1:43:17] like 19 by now it's like I've been
[1:43:20] without friends like I need need someone
[1:43:23] my age and um you know that that was
[1:43:26] hard that was very difficult whenever he
[1:43:28] moved but I had faith and I had the
[1:43:30] twins and and uh and we you know hung
[1:43:34] out we spend time to get him we
[1:43:35] fellowshipped and you know God was
[1:43:36] getting getting a hold of our hearts and
[1:43:40] we went to God was putting a desire in
[1:43:47] our heart as young people because here
[1:43:49] we are in a church of 12 people
[1:43:51] by all accounts like if anyone else had
[1:43:53] come in here and looked at us like it's
[1:43:55] dead it's just dry and dead and we're
[1:43:58] just trying to hold on and that's a lot
[1:44:00] of what it was and and not to not to
[1:44:03] pass judgment but we'll say from a young
[1:44:05] person's perspective it's like we're
[1:44:07] just all hanging in there you know it's
[1:44:09] just like you're coming in and watching
[1:44:11] the service and it's like
[1:44:12] oh man and and you're just just trying
[1:44:16] to just keep walking on with God but God
[1:44:18] had done work in my heart and I've been
[1:44:20] did when he used to treat and I came
[1:44:22] back and it's like there was a hunger in
[1:44:25] my heart for more of God and there was a
[1:44:27] hunger in all of our hearts uh the four
[1:44:30] of us for God and we just started
[1:44:32] praying we just started praying more and
[1:44:34] more and I remember I took and a couple
[1:44:35] other people from friends that I had met
[1:44:38] and when he thought treat all across the
[1:44:40] country it's like now I had some
[1:44:41] connections across the country but I
[1:44:42] didn't have any male friends here and
[1:44:45] you know even to some extent like
[1:44:47] Kathryn or that were face friends and so
[1:44:49] it's like it was just you know it's like
[1:44:50] just trying to hang on to some
[1:44:51] fellowship and we started from myself
[1:44:54] and a few other people across the
[1:44:56] country started praying between camps
[1:44:58] between years fasting one day a week
[1:45:01] like let's fast on Thursdays and pray
[1:45:03] that God will do a real work at retreat
[1:45:06] again this year and when a youth retreat
[1:45:08] which those of you that are young people
[1:45:11] in our 17 and older I highly recommend
[1:45:13] you go to when youth the treat it's a
[1:45:14] great camp highly recommended and we
[1:45:19] prayed and something happened that year
[1:45:23] you still with me okay this is this is
[1:45:26] going somewhere and this part is I'm
[1:45:29] just gonna preach it so um hey when I
[1:45:33] when I first started here like I said it
[1:45:35] was 12 people tambourine mom would be on
[1:45:37] the guitar sometime so everyone up and
[1:45:39] leaves oh I can keep on preaching it's
[1:45:42] okay I don't mind I've done it before
[1:45:45] praise God I'm not saying that you
[1:45:47] should do that we went to camp wonderful
[1:45:50] services all that stuff and after camp
[1:45:53] we had this tradition of meeting a bunch
[1:45:56] of the young people from camp because
[1:45:57] you have four or five days that you're
[1:45:59] just in the word like services all day
[1:46:01] long and fellowship it's like you just
[1:46:02] feel so clean then as soon as you left
[1:46:05] you like oh my goodness you're at
[1:46:07] Starbucks and you're like oh my eyes you
[1:46:10] know or my ears like you just have this
[1:46:12] this like you're so aware of the
[1:46:15] presence of God and the presence of
[1:46:17] other spirits that sensitizes you to
[1:46:19] that and so here we were we'd been
[1:46:21] praying a lot fasting praying like
[1:46:23] looking for something from God
[1:46:25] and looking for something real we had
[1:46:27] great services and then we after camp we
[1:46:30] went um we went over to crest Johnson's
[1:46:33] house who was a sister there that would
[1:46:35] open up her house and so we had like 50
[1:46:36] people descend on this poor woman's
[1:46:39] house like literally like 50 young
[1:46:42] people are all talking and just like all
[1:46:44] kinds of noise and I'm Steven investing
[1:46:47] actually when that year as well and um
[1:46:50] and they were engaged they weren't gonna
[1:46:51] get married
[1:46:52] um bear with my faith I need your backup
[1:46:59] on this one just like say say Amen
[1:47:00] because faith was there
[1:47:02] faith was there for this and we went
[1:47:09] there's a real God there's a real God we
[1:47:16] hear so much theory we hear so much this
[1:47:19] is what the word says and praise God and
[1:47:21] God can move but there is a real God
[1:47:25] there's a real anointing there there is
[1:47:28] absolutely something beyond this world
[1:47:33] someone absolutely I'm certain of that
[1:47:37] because I know I was there I saw it we
[1:47:42] have 50 of us went over
[1:47:43] long story short there was 10 of us in
[1:47:45] this small small room tiny we're like
[1:47:48] crammed in there we're all just talking
[1:47:50] about the word talking about God and
[1:47:52] there was a couple different situations
[1:47:55] and we ended up praying we just pray I
[1:47:57] started praying about it you just could
[1:47:59] feel it the president's the atmosphere
[1:48:01] that was just charged everyone outside
[1:48:03] is like playing games and like some of
[1:48:05] them are talking about God too but it's
[1:48:06] like it's a party you know people are
[1:48:08] all young people it's like 20 to 25
[1:48:10] years old and we were in there and we're
[1:48:13] all praying and someone starts speaking
[1:48:16] in tongues and I'd never heard speaking
[1:48:20] in tongues before at that point like I
[1:48:22] had not heard it at all
[1:48:23] and I was just like ever the whole room
[1:48:26] blew up as soon as someone started like
[1:48:29] he just blew literally blew up everyone
[1:48:33] was screaming I screamed like I never
[1:48:34] screamed like that in my life it was
[1:48:36] like I was going through a point where
[1:48:39] it's like I knew
[1:48:39] had worked in my heart but I was still
[1:48:41] so much doubt there was something in my
[1:48:43] mind even while we were praying that was
[1:48:45] saying you don't really believe this
[1:48:47] what if God isn't even real is like
[1:48:48] there's something sitting on my shoulder
[1:48:50] just saying you know you this isn't even
[1:48:52] real like you're not even your you're
[1:48:54] like it you don't even believe this none
[1:48:55] of it's true like you know all that same
[1:48:57] old stuff Hiro was you know praying
[1:49:00] leading a Bible study and like you know
[1:49:02] all that like it's still there that
[1:49:05] never leaves you'll always have
[1:49:08] something there trying to convince you
[1:49:11] that you're you're not you're not it
[1:49:13] you're not it you're definitely going to
[1:49:15] hell you'll always have something there
[1:49:18] and Here I am and it's just it the room
[1:49:20] blew up the literally just it I didn't
[1:49:25] even know my vocal cords could go there
[1:49:27] I don't know if it was a spiritual
[1:49:28] scream or what happened but it's like it
[1:49:30] just like the whole room blew up and an
[1:49:32] interpretation didn't come forth that's
[1:49:34] not really the the point the point is
[1:49:36] what happened afterwards is all of a
[1:49:39] sudden it's like you went from this kind
[1:49:41] of charged room to just an explosion
[1:49:44] just an absolute explosion and we're all
[1:49:47] just I I was like I thought I was gonna
[1:49:49] break the chair underneath me because I
[1:49:51] was kneeling I just like started
[1:49:53] smashing it someone started pounding the
[1:49:55] wall and it's like and the way this room
[1:49:57] was designed it was it was designed with
[1:49:59] a false wall and someone someone at some
[1:50:03] point eventually opened up that wall and
[1:50:06] like it just spread through the entire
[1:50:08] rest of the house through the entire
[1:50:11] rest of the house and it's amazing to
[1:50:13] tell the Stork seventh told us in so
[1:50:14] long it's like you almost forget that
[1:50:16] had happened but I was there I know it
[1:50:19] happened wasn't just emotions it wasn't
[1:50:22] just fanaticism something happened
[1:50:25] something happened God was there and
[1:50:28] it's just it's spread there's a whole
[1:50:32] house to the point where it's like you
[1:50:36] look at the paintings of the old
[1:50:38] Pentecostal meetings the old revivals
[1:50:40] and the like you actually look at them
[1:50:42] I've looked in the like that's exactly
[1:50:44] what we were like exactly people were
[1:50:46] praying I mean there was people
[1:50:49] prophesying people were healed like I
[1:50:51] know they were healed I've
[1:50:53] talk to them since them then people were
[1:50:55] here from allergies we had people healed
[1:50:57] from earth Rytas we had people um I
[1:50:59] don't remember all the all of the points
[1:51:01] but there was multiple points and these
[1:51:03] are all young people no minister there
[1:51:06] there was no minister there there was no
[1:51:08] one there was no music there was no
[1:51:12] music it was a bunch of kids a bunch of
[1:51:17] kids that wanted to see God and they
[1:51:22] were ready
[1:51:23] the atmosphere was there and when God
[1:51:26] moved it happened it's struck it's
[1:51:30] struck and I can't explain it to you
[1:51:35] because you weren't there I wish I could
[1:51:37] take people I've wished for the last
[1:51:39] tenth
[1:51:40] what was it almost ten years nine years
[1:51:43] ago now whatever it was that I could
[1:51:45] take people back there and that's
[1:51:48] exactly what I've been trying to do I
[1:51:51] came back from this and it happened it
[1:51:53] went for five or six hours five or six
[1:52:00] hours of prayer and people running
[1:52:03] around and in in laying hands and
[1:52:06] claiming and confessing sin like you
[1:52:09] like you can't make it up there were
[1:52:12] people that were outside I know this guy
[1:52:15] he's a minister now something got ahold
[1:52:19] of him too friend of mine um
[1:52:22] Jared Meade he said he was outside he
[1:52:25] had gone for a walk he came back and he
[1:52:26] saw everyone running around he's like oh
[1:52:28] they're playing games and he goes
[1:52:30] running in because he thought they're
[1:52:32] playing games and he said when he went
[1:52:34] through the doorway it's like he hit a
[1:52:36] brick wall because his spirit wasn't in
[1:52:39] line with what was going on in there he
[1:52:44] hit a brick wall and of course he stood
[1:52:48] outside and prayed and eventually he
[1:52:50] entered in and and it was a mighty move
[1:52:53] of God like six or seven eight ten
[1:52:56] ministries came out of that all of them
[1:52:59] might like all of my friends like I know
[1:53:01] them Chris take was there Zach Wallace
[1:53:04] was there Nathan Ericson was there I was
[1:53:06] there Jared
[1:53:06] mede was there it's a bunch of other
[1:53:08] guys that are all now carrying this
[1:53:10] gospel why because they saw something
[1:53:12] real something beyond our understanding
[1:53:16] this is beyond theology beyond beyond
[1:53:18] the rules or the constructs or the do's
[1:53:21] and dont's are like there was a prophet
[1:53:23] fifty years ago it was something
[1:53:25] happening today that was real and we
[1:53:28] knew it was real we knew it was real
[1:53:31] something happened and we finally went
[1:53:35] home you know whatever something like
[1:53:36] eventually we went home and we went to
[1:53:38] bed the next morning we went over to
[1:53:40] Paul off Fontaine's Church literal Life
[1:53:42] Tabernacle over there in in Ohio
[1:53:45] Michigan I can't remember there on the
[1:53:46] border um the next day like almost all
[1:53:50] of us went imagine taking 50 young
[1:53:54] people who were just in like this
[1:53:56] amazing charged atmosphere and then put
[1:53:58] him in church the next day it blew up
[1:54:02] again it blew up again we had a five or
[1:54:06] six hour long service you know how long
[1:54:09] it felt that long that long I remember
[1:54:15] looking at the clock when I left I was
[1:54:17] like it's that late five or six hours
[1:54:22] long and the prayer like the the
[1:54:24] deliverance and that church went on to
[1:54:27] have a revival for like two years of
[1:54:30] just ongoing like prophesying and
[1:54:33] speaking in tongues and just ongoing
[1:54:35] revival I listened to the sermons from
[1:54:38] there that were coming from there at
[1:54:39] that time and it was amazing and even to
[1:54:42] this day they still have speaking in
[1:54:45] tongues interpretation from the same
[1:54:47] people that were born out of that
[1:54:50] absolutely go talk to them absolutely so
[1:54:55] I remember I came out I had this it was
[1:54:59] like a fire it was like I remember his
[1:55:02] like I saw it in my mind it's like I
[1:55:03] came back here it's like here's a
[1:55:06] blazing bonfire over here and it's like
[1:55:09] oh look here I am going all alone back
[1:55:12] over here no friends other than the
[1:55:15] twins and faith I'd know like guy for
[1:55:18] like nothing
[1:55:20] and I was like I had this fire in my
[1:55:22] heart like I've seen something real and
[1:55:25] I looked at us and I was I was song
[1:55:27] leaning already at that time and it's
[1:55:29] like well I may not be a minister I may
[1:55:32] not be a preacher but I can sing this
[1:55:35] thing I can sing this thing and you guys
[1:55:39] remember the way it was before you
[1:55:40] remember when I first started and I came
[1:55:43] back and I broke tambourines I bloodied
[1:55:46] my knuckles on this pulpit so many times
[1:55:49] I bloodied my knuckles on tambourines
[1:55:51] because I'd seen something real thank
[1:55:55] you
[1:55:55] praise God thank you sister Kelly thank
[1:55:59] you appreciate that that was something
[1:56:02] living there was something alive and in
[1:56:04] my heart is that God if you can do it
[1:56:06] there you can do it here God you can do
[1:56:11] it here there's a real garden there's a
[1:56:15] matter the numbers it doesn't matter
[1:56:17] that the trials are the suffering or the
[1:56:20] years of God you can do it here you can
[1:56:24] do it and God I might not be able to
[1:56:28] bring it but I can create the atmosphere
[1:56:30] for it and for the last 10 years that's
[1:56:35] been my heart every time I go up to this
[1:56:38] pulpit I've never by God's grace I never
[1:56:43] phoned it in no matter how are the
[1:56:46] trials of the suffering I was going
[1:56:48] through it's God you can still move you
[1:56:51] can do something you can do something I
[1:56:54] know you can do something it's not about
[1:56:57] me it's not about how much I can dance
[1:57:00] in the aisle or we can sing the songs or
[1:57:02] we can play the music it's God I'm
[1:57:04] preparing a ground for you I know I know
[1:57:09] someday like Elijah we're preparing the
[1:57:13] altar and one day there's going to be a
[1:57:16] fire that falls I know it I know it
[1:57:23] there's going to be a fire that falls
[1:57:26] here get ready for it there's going to
[1:57:30] be a fire that falls here absolutely if
[1:57:34] you can believe it if you can receive it
[1:57:36] if you can grab hold onto it if you can
[1:57:38] look beyond the flash it has nothing to
[1:57:45] do with after where we are everything to
[1:57:52] do with God and we'll serve the same God
[1:57:54] today this thing is real it's alive God
[1:58:00] is here since rakesh is dealing with
[1:58:04] this God will raise her up because he is
[1:58:08] the same God he's the same God we serve
[1:58:12] a living God today let the fire fall we
[1:58:16] serve the same God today
[1:58:19] [Applause]
[1:58:26] we serve the same God and that's what I
[1:58:31] want to impress upon you impress upon
[1:58:34] you get in the game
[1:58:37] get in the game get in the game don't
[1:58:42] just be a spectator get in the game
[1:58:45] don't just come and wait for a song to
[1:58:47] happen be the fire of God don't just
[1:58:51] wait for something to happen let it
[1:58:53] happen you let it happen let it happen
[1:58:58] we service all mighty God you can just
[1:59:02] get your eyes away from you and look to
[1:59:06] Jesus it has nothing to do with you
[1:59:11] hallelujah glory man I feel like
[1:59:18] speaking in tongues man poof man we
[1:59:22] serve a living God
[1:59:28] man I want to impress it on you impress
[1:59:35] it on you it's not a one-man show it's
[1:59:40] not brother 1 it's not me it's you it's
[1:59:44] always you get in the game
[1:59:47] grab hold on it God there must be
[1:59:50] something I can do must be something I
[1:59:54] can do must be you know something I
[1:59:59] believe this now maybe it's just me but
[2:00:02] I remember we were in this room 10 of us
[2:00:05] and there was a sister there cheyanne
[2:00:08] she ended up marrying Nathan my good
[2:00:10] friend and I believe and this is just me
[2:00:13] I don't know God will tell he'll
[2:00:15] understand it better by and by but I
[2:00:17] remember she was so angry about
[2:00:21] something like that like that the devil
[2:00:24] had done something she was pounding the
[2:00:27] floor with their fists she was so mad
[2:00:28] so before we went to prayer before like
[2:00:31] this is before the fire fell and I
[2:00:32] remember seeing that it's like I believe
[2:00:35] God was pleased with that
[2:00:38] she didn't just kind of half-hearted
[2:00:40] kindness order like oh god you know it's
[2:00:43] you know you're perfect we'll be done
[2:00:45] and like it she wasn't just passively
[2:00:47] she was so in it she was so in it she
[2:00:52] put herself in that word and it's the
[2:00:56] same thing today music worship what are
[2:01:01] we doing we're here to drive out spirits
[2:01:05] we're here to create an atmosphere that
[2:01:08] the Lord inhabits the praises of his
[2:01:10] people
[2:01:11] David cast spirits off of Saul by music
[2:01:15] by music that's why we do this that's
[2:01:19] why we do this the word is the
[2:01:21] importance absolutely but the reason we
[2:01:23] praise is to bring him down and to cast
[2:01:26] Satan out we do that so we can we can
[2:01:30] we're fighting
[2:01:31] we're fighting in the trenches and it's
[2:01:35] not based on how we feel I didn't feel
[2:01:38] like coming up here and preaching today
[2:01:40] not at all but I did it standing on
[2:01:45] God's Word not based on how we feel but
[2:01:51] because God said so that's the key
[2:01:56] seeking you should it's you it's you
[2:02:08] it's always been you you bring it you're
[2:02:12] the one that brings the anointing it's
[2:02:14] not it's not and don't mean in a
[2:02:16] man-made manufacturing I'm gonna make
[2:02:18] something happen but it's that I'm gonna
[2:02:21] go and I am going to sing my heart out
[2:02:24] I'm going to praise my heart out I'm
[2:02:26] going to worship my heart out because
[2:02:28] I'm gonna get something from God I don't
[2:02:31] care if anyone else there does to some
[2:02:33] extent I'm there to see God and if you
[2:02:37] can grab hold on that grab hold on that
[2:02:41] it doesn't matter but you are the
[2:02:43] revival you are the revival it doesn't
[2:02:46] matter what the whole rest of the church
[2:02:48] is doing
[2:02:49] you are the revival you are the revival
[2:02:52] and God took four young people that came
[2:02:55] from those meetings and came here and
[2:02:58] revived this church this thing was dying
[2:03:01] and God came and brought it here to give
[2:03:04] it new life and it's the same God that
[2:03:07] could do the same today
[2:03:09] God can God can if he can get a hold of
[2:03:13] someone let God get a hold of you it's
[2:03:17] not me it's not brother one don't look
[2:03:19] to us it's you it's you there's an
[2:03:23] anointing waiting to fall on someone
[2:03:25] that will receive it that will act upon
[2:03:28] it who will act upon it praise the Lord
[2:03:35] um praise the Lord man this is so I
[2:03:46] thought of moving to Ohio I almost did
[2:03:48] I'm just gonna keep going until God
[2:03:50] stops me cuz I'm I'm just here I almost
[2:03:54] moved to Ohio around this time because I
[2:03:56] was like Here I am just like and my
[2:03:58] heart was there there was peep like my
[2:04:01] friends like I had this desire and my
[2:04:04] heart's like I had a need I had a need I
[2:04:07] was alone in a sense like there was
[2:04:10] faith in the twins but you know though
[2:04:11] they were friends and I was their friend
[2:04:15] but it's just different it's different I
[2:04:17] didn't have a companion I did not not a
[2:04:19] true like a bosom friend
[2:04:22] not here for years years and I remember
[2:04:28] I was standing back in the back and I
[2:04:30] pray I was praying I was thinking of
[2:04:32] moving to Ohio a lot of people said I
[2:04:34] should and I don't know maybe I have my
[2:04:39] timeline wrong or whatever but it Here I
[2:04:43] am praying in my heart God what should I
[2:04:46] do
[2:04:46] I don't feel settled in one way or the
[2:04:48] other what should I do and brother Diggs
[2:04:53] comes running out from behind this
[2:04:54] pulpit I was standing where brother Dan
[2:04:55] is there a little further back and he
[2:04:57] points me in the face they says don't
[2:05:00] stop don't quit
[2:05:02] stay right where you are and you grow
[2:05:04] where you're planted and I just took
[2:05:07] that at the time like this is God and
[2:05:10] that gave me newfound courage like I
[2:05:12] might I might be having a hard time but
[2:05:16] I've lived under that I believed under
[2:05:18] that like we're gonna have church today
[2:05:21] we're gonna have church tonight we're
[2:05:23] just going to keep on pressing
[2:05:25] persevering we're gonna keep on
[2:05:27] persevering we're gonna keep on pushing
[2:05:30] because God wants to do something keep
[2:05:33] growing keep moving and it may not
[2:05:35] happen this morning may happen next
[2:05:37] Sunday
[2:05:38] I don't know but God is here God is
[2:05:41] doing something and I want to go into
[2:05:45] something because I still feel led to do
[2:05:47] it and I don't know it's it's it is what
[2:05:49] it is and I'm just gonna go into it so
[2:05:50] here I am having gone through all this
[2:05:52] being been been in this you know state
[2:05:55] of just spiritual awakening and all of
[2:05:57] these different things and you tell me
[2:06:00] if I need to stop or the one because
[2:06:01] yeah I see you back there just let me
[2:06:02] know I'm I'm just going for it I took
[2:06:04] the clock down I don't know what time it
[2:06:05] is if you need a drink go get it is you
[2:06:12] know we we we were there and of course
[2:06:14] God started bringing people in some
[2:06:15] people started coming and brother one
[2:06:17] came and you know he would join our
[2:06:19] prayer meeting sometimes and things like
[2:06:20] that and and in like you know there was
[2:06:22] this this work of God that was happening
[2:06:24] and then during this time it's like
[2:06:28] somehow we as young people became
[2:06:31] pillars in the church we did I was doing
[2:06:36] this and sound then the twins started
[2:06:38] doing sound faith who's doing sounds
[2:06:40] like we were kind of touching everything
[2:06:41] and we all unlock to the church in the
[2:06:44] morning like everything it was like you
[2:06:46] know we're a couple a couple of
[2:06:47] 20-something kids and I think what
[2:06:50] happened and this is just this is
[2:06:52] sharing from my heart so bear with me
[2:06:54] and and if you need to go go if you need
[2:06:57] to get a drink of water go I once again
[2:06:59] I just feel led to go through all of
[2:07:00] this so got major testimony right I mean
[2:07:04] all this stuff that's happened and God
[2:07:06] God God did this but there were still
[2:07:11] needs
[2:07:13] and I look at it here we are now and I
[2:07:21] look at this looking back now as God did
[2:07:23] use this for a work and that's good and
[2:07:25] that's right in a like every not
[2:07:28] complaining at all but we were such a
[2:07:31] spiritual state and God used us like
[2:07:36] Elijah and not not comparing ourselves
[2:07:39] at all like I said that this is not at
[2:07:41] all to be self aggrandizing
[2:07:43] to use a fancy word um not to be self
[2:07:46] patting on our back but that anointing
[2:07:48] like the Mount Carmel like you know
[2:07:50] God's using us where our underlying
[2:07:55] things we just never really dealt with
[2:07:57] there were things that were just not
[2:07:59] dealt with because we were still kids
[2:08:02] still young people we're still mean we
[2:08:06] were trying to serve God if all of our
[2:08:07] hearts and God did use us but there were
[2:08:10] things that were laying dormant and I
[2:08:13] look at the twins today and it's like I
[2:08:16] understand I understand because I'm
[2:08:20] there too for me and and I'm just I'm
[2:08:25] I'm opening my heart because I feel that
[2:08:27] it's the right thing to do I think
[2:08:29] sometimes I've been up here and and as
[2:08:31] new people have come in people and maybe
[2:08:35] this is just me but it's like they don't
[2:08:37] understand they don't understand the
[2:08:39] years of burden and toil that's come
[2:08:41] behind this thing you know I've had
[2:08:44] people and I've one particular person
[2:08:46] who used to call me while the song
[2:08:48] service was going on and tell me how
[2:08:50] terrible it was and how it didn't bless
[2:08:52] them and all these different things you
[2:08:54] know you as a young person you just you
[2:08:56] take it on the chin because you know
[2:08:58] your hearts right it's like God all I
[2:09:00] want is to see I've never never gone
[2:09:04] into any of this to make myself
[2:09:05] something not to make myself known
[2:09:08] around the world though I am I didn't go
[2:09:12] into it for that I went because I wanted
[2:09:14] to see God move I want and I still want
[2:09:18] to see God move but I found in myself
[2:09:25] story of Asaph and i'm just gonna read
[2:09:27] this Psalm 73 Asaph he's one of the
[2:09:33] music ministers how ironic one of the
[2:09:36] music ministers right under David he I
[2:09:38] mean he wrote a lot quite a few of the
[2:09:40] Psalms if you look at it
[2:09:41] he's a prophetic music ministry right
[2:09:43] here and I'll just read this truly God
[2:09:46] is good to Israel this is Psalm 73 even
[2:09:49] as such as are of a clean heart but as
[2:09:52] for me my feet were almost gone my steps
[2:09:55] had well-nigh slipped for I was envious
[2:09:59] at the foolish when I saw the prosperity
[2:10:01] of the wicked for there are no bands in
[2:10:04] their death but their strength is firm
[2:10:06] they are not in trouble as other men
[2:10:09] neither are their play are they plagued
[2:10:11] like other men than jumping down verily
[2:10:14] and this is his cry verily I have
[2:10:16] cleansed my heart in vain and washed my
[2:10:18] hands in innocency for all the day long
[2:10:21] have I been plagued and chastened every
[2:10:23] morning if I say I will speak thus
[2:10:25] behold I shall offend against the
[2:10:28] generation of thy children when I
[2:10:30] thought to know this it was too painful
[2:10:31] for me and like I said this this sermon
[2:10:34] is testimony confession exhortation and
[2:10:40] something else I can't remember this is
[2:10:44] me this is exactly what happened to me
[2:10:46] and I I think well I think it happens a
[2:10:50] lot with young people with young people
[2:10:53] that are their their their heart has
[2:10:56] been to serve the Lord with all their
[2:10:58] hearts from the days of their youth and
[2:11:01] that was me it's like I'll give God
[2:11:04] everything I have I gave him everything
[2:11:07] that I had and there and I got to that
[2:11:11] point where and I don't remember when
[2:11:13] all this started it's hard to kind of
[2:11:15] look back but it's like I don't know if
[2:11:17] I was 25 26 what it was you know the
[2:11:20] twins got married and then it's just me
[2:11:23] then faith and you know faith was dating
[2:11:27] Josiah before and then thank God here
[2:11:29] comes Jordan and all that stuff and I
[2:11:32] was alone really alone now really really
[2:11:37] really alone
[2:11:38] it's like I've had I have friends all
[2:11:40] around the world I do I have an open
[2:11:43] invitation to the Philippines I have the
[2:11:45] open invitation to multiple like around
[2:11:47] because and that's not not Tooting a
[2:11:50] trumpet it's the gift of God God's been
[2:11:52] blessed to me in that I've been able to
[2:11:54] make connections around the world I've
[2:11:57] been to ten countries or something like
[2:11:59] that and you know I used that because I
[2:12:02] wanted to go and help and but God also
[2:12:05] blessed me by making many friends in
[2:12:06] that regard but they weren't here they
[2:12:09] weren't here you know you look at this
[2:12:12] and I think of this as during my
[2:12:13] formative years it's like 14 years old
[2:12:16] no pastor friction between what little
[2:12:18] friends I did have 17 friends finally go
[2:12:20] it's like since 14 to some extent to now
[2:12:25] my friendship level has been very I
[2:12:31] don't know I can't even explain it
[2:12:33] but it's like that feeling of not really
[2:12:36] belonging anywhere that that feeling of
[2:12:39] just isolation it's like no one really
[2:12:41] understands and even here and I love you
[2:12:44] guys I really do and brother Stevens
[2:12:46] helped me with some things
[2:12:47] Aaron's helped me with things Ariel's
[2:12:49] helped me with things brother Joseph -
[2:12:50] we did lunch the other day that or other
[2:12:52] months sorry if we've been meaning to
[2:12:53] get back together but it's like there's
[2:12:56] this longing in my heart there's just
[2:12:59] this longing there there's a longing in
[2:13:01] my heart and there had been and yeah if
[2:13:04] you need to go get water do it this is
[2:13:06] this is um I don't know it's important
[2:13:09] there's a reason for all of this I don't
[2:13:11] know entirely why by God God put it on
[2:13:13] my heart truly God is good to Israel and
[2:13:16] I saw this I came to the point when I
[2:13:19] was 25 26 and it's like something just
[2:13:23] changed in my heart just I still wanted
[2:13:26] to see God I still wanted to serve God I
[2:13:28] still want all those things but a Burt
[2:13:31] our desire started growing more and more
[2:13:33] in my heart as God what about me
[2:13:36] you know I saw my friends starting to
[2:13:39] get married starting you know getting
[2:13:41] great careers or you know things like
[2:13:42] that it's like what about me I've served
[2:13:46] you I gave everything I had to this
[2:13:48] thing everything I had to this thing
[2:13:50] praying like
[2:13:52] studying the word like I did and that's
[2:13:54] not not at all to be like hey guys feel
[2:13:57] bad for me or look at me not at all
[2:13:58] that's not the point
[2:13:59] I'm this is more confession than
[2:14:01] anything else that I found in my heart a
[2:14:04] mixture of desire but I had to start
[2:14:08] fighting off a sense of bitterness of
[2:14:11] like I've worked so hard in God what's
[2:14:14] what where's the where's the blessing in
[2:14:16] all this what where is it where is the
[2:14:19] revival where where is it and then for
[2:14:22] me it's like God like I just feel behind
[2:14:27] I feel behind all of my peers and and I
[2:14:30] know I know that I went through
[2:14:32] it's literally this exact trial where I
[2:14:35] started looking at the world is look at
[2:14:36] the success look at this you know if I'd
[2:14:39] gone back and gotten my master's degree
[2:14:40] you know where would I be I'm a smart
[2:14:43] guy like I could have done this I could
[2:14:45] have done this but it's like God but I
[2:14:46] did this for you and that's not wrong
[2:14:48] except that it started going more and
[2:14:51] more into like this inner festering but
[2:14:54] I took that to God in prayer and I
[2:15:00] prayed and prayed and prayed for about
[2:15:03] two years and just praying that I found
[2:15:06] myself in the scripture it's it's it's
[2:15:08] are you still with me okay and and I'm
[2:15:12] just sharing this I don't know maybe it
[2:15:14] will help someone and maybe it won't but
[2:15:16] it's it's I've been in this church for
[2:15:19] almost 25 years that's pretty crazy that
[2:15:24] it's been a long ride a long long time
[2:15:27] I've seen a lot of faces come and go and
[2:15:30] that was very hard seeing John come and
[2:15:34] go seeing Danny Hartnett I love that guy
[2:15:36] I love that guy to pieces and they come
[2:15:42] and go it's like this constant like
[2:15:44] crate finally like ah yes this is gonna
[2:15:47] be great like I got along great with
[2:15:49] those guys but they're not they're not
[2:15:51] Christians they don't serve the Lord
[2:15:52] they don't love the Lord even though
[2:15:54] like there was a point where like yeah
[2:15:56] the God baptized and but they don't it's
[2:15:58] not there it's not really there and
[2:16:04] um I started praying more and more and
[2:16:10] more and I found myself in the word
[2:16:12] thank God you know I'm Hannah God give
[2:16:18] me my blessing
[2:16:18] you know I'm give me my blessing I've
[2:16:22] served you I've served you I've been
[2:16:25] there I've served like I've been there
[2:16:26] you know I I didn't you can't lay a
[2:16:30] finger on on me not doing it because I
[2:16:33] did I know that I did even going to the
[2:16:36] Philippines which it's a complicated
[2:16:37] story around that but I went because I
[2:16:39] felt led I wasn't preaching it I sang
[2:16:41] probably 50 times at other churches um
[2:16:44] III haven't been I've tried to follow
[2:16:49] God to the best of my ability with all
[2:16:51] of my heart not to say I don't have my
[2:16:53] own mistakes cuz I do we all have
[2:16:55] weaknesses we all have tendencies but I
[2:16:57] did that I started finding this in my
[2:17:00] heart and three years ago I had had an
[2:17:10] experience and brother one and I have
[2:17:12] talked about a lot of the stuff we had
[2:17:13] been I love were the one and we've I
[2:17:15] love that we both worked at align it
[2:17:16] together because as soon as he moved
[2:17:18] here I was working at Allina it's like
[2:17:19] or something they were like that and so
[2:17:21] we got to spend a lot of time together
[2:17:22] and so I've enjoyed that a lot
[2:17:26] and that I know him we know each other
[2:17:28] it's not just like I'm just like one of
[2:17:30] the rant like I get to know him don't
[2:17:35] take up all of his time but get to know
[2:17:37] him because it's it's I love that as a
[2:17:41] young person kind of coming up I've had
[2:17:43] that relationship to be able to come
[2:17:45] talk to him about things and I think
[2:17:47] I've probably been more more open than
[2:17:49] he was expecting because it's like hey
[2:17:51] this is what's going on here's my
[2:17:52] terrible troubles and and stuff like
[2:17:54] that but um God told me he was going to
[2:18:01] build my house now I I don't like to say
[2:18:03] God told me unless I'm very very certain
[2:18:05] it's like God told me I know it was and
[2:18:08] it was like an it was an answer to
[2:18:11] prayer it was an it was a direct answer
[2:18:13] to prayers like I'd be prayed for years
[2:18:15] and I made a mistake
[2:18:18] I'll build your house but it says unless
[2:18:24] the Lord builds the house they labor in
[2:18:27] vain that build it and that's the
[2:18:30] mistake I made I made a mistake
[2:18:33] I took I'll build your house and I I
[2:18:36] took it as it's time for me to build my
[2:18:39] house and it was wrong and um it was
[2:18:48] wrong and not that I haven't still been
[2:18:51] serving God and things like that but I
[2:18:53] can see now that because of that I never
[2:18:58] fully dealt with the relief from that
[2:19:02] burden and that bird it kept growing
[2:19:06] this inner resentment and bitterness in
[2:19:09] my heart like when's it gonna happen
[2:19:11] when why is why is this like this and
[2:19:14] and I'm just being totally open and
[2:19:18] honest so um most of you know Sarah my
[2:19:21] former girlfriend we broke up in January
[2:19:23] and this is not a breakup story but it's
[2:19:25] it's that shocked me it shocked me
[2:19:30] because I knew God had told me he would
[2:19:32] build my house and it it it it broke me
[2:19:36] literally just broke me not just a
[2:19:38] broken heart like a standard like oh wow
[2:19:41] poor me like like like that it actually
[2:19:44] broke me like literally broke my trust
[2:19:48] and God like broke my my what happened
[2:19:51] like where did I miss you God what's
[2:19:54] going on it broke my my I've been to the

[2:21:36] open and honest and I don't know if this
[2:21:38] is going out on YouTube or whatever but
[2:21:39] I'm just I'm this is my church and I'm
[2:21:41] talking to my church and my family and
[2:21:44] I'm being vulnerable and honest I'm just
[2:21:45] telling the truth and hopefully this
[2:21:47] helps someone like the show the weakness
[2:21:51] of the strong like this this is my this
[2:21:54] has been my burden and my hurt and the
[2:21:56] difficult but in the space of oh of
[2:21:59] about a week's time broken up with
[2:22:02] accepted a new job was let go from my
[2:22:04] previous job like in the space of a week
[2:22:07] was like boom boom boom oh and then our
[2:22:09] dog died boom like boom and it's like in
[2:22:12] one instance and I knew it like I saw it
[2:22:15] as soon as it happened thank God it's
[2:22:17] like something is happening I knew it
[2:22:20] like God is here somewhere because this
[2:22:23] does not happen by accident there's too
[2:22:25] many things going on all at once is too
[2:22:28] much - it is this is a test something
[2:22:31] about this is a test but I couldn't see
[2:22:34] God I couldn't find him I like I tried
[2:22:39] to see God I looked for him I was Joe
[2:22:43] I wish God had a house that I could go
[2:22:46] and knock on his door and find him find
[2:22:50] him you know and yet in spite of all
[2:22:53] this and I appreciate everyone's
[2:22:55] patience with me cuz I know I don't
[2:22:56] always show up for service in time I
[2:22:58] don't because of this like my heart has
[2:23:01] just been like I had to drag myself to
[2:23:04] church make myself go to church because
[2:23:08] my heart was so hurt not against Sarah
[2:23:13] against God why is this happening
[2:23:16] why did you let this happen what is
[2:23:19] going on why didn't you show me it why
[2:23:22] didn't you let me know is gonna come
[2:23:24] what what is going on I just had to make
[2:23:28] myself come to church and I'll say it
[2:23:31] again come to church get to church if
[2:23:35] you've got to drag yourself by your
[2:23:37] fingernails to the door and sit in the
[2:23:39] back or sit back there get yourself to
[2:23:42] church find a way to make it happen get
[2:23:46] yourself to church honestly like I
[2:23:49] believe that kept me because I'm a like
[2:23:51] I'm a like even if I was like halfway
[2:23:54] through the song service or like barely
[2:23:56] here or whatever it's like I came I
[2:23:59] still came I still came by God's grace
[2:24:03] because I know that it's right I've been
[2:24:06] through it even in these last nine
[2:24:07] months and I'm just sharing this I'm and
[2:24:09] it's from my heart I know some people
[2:24:11] are tired and some things but it's like
[2:24:14] we all will go through this no matter
[2:24:18] how strong you are we all go through
[2:24:21] we'll go through times where we feel
[2:24:24] lost God's abandoned us and we'll go
[2:24:29] through man again and again and again
[2:24:31] and again it will keep going through
[2:24:34] them because it's it and I can say it
[2:24:37] now Jesus told us you would never leave
[2:24:41] us or forsake us and the reason he told
[2:24:44] us is because we would have times where
[2:24:47] we thought that he had that's why that's
[2:24:51] why and I've been through that I've been
[2:24:53] through the stripping down of my total
[2:24:57] belief
[2:24:57] of everything where it's like I don't
[2:24:59] know what's what I don't even know which
[2:25:00] way is up because what happens is when
[2:25:03] when you have something totally
[2:25:06] unexpected that challenges your belief
[2:25:09] not just like oh look someone's an
[2:25:11] atheist is gonna come and try to talk me
[2:25:12] out of Christianity but it's something
[2:25:14] that you believed to be true and all of
[2:25:18] a sudden you find out that it's not it
[2:25:20] shakes everything you know you it would
[2:25:24] be like saying like if some if all of a
[2:25:26] sudden you realize that the Sun didn't
[2:25:28] exist well then what about your
[2:25:30] conceptions about plants because the
[2:25:32] photosynthesis and they interact with
[2:25:34] the Sun and it's all of that that web of
[2:25:36] beliefs we have those we have all of
[2:25:39] these beliefs that are interconnected
[2:25:41] and so when one is broken the rest come
[2:25:45] into question because they're all
[2:25:47] connected and so for me like uh and not
[2:25:51] not to go into too much detail but it's
[2:25:53] like I've been there I've been to the
[2:25:56] point where it's like absolute rock
[2:25:58] bottom not knowing which way was up
[2:26:00] like what like god I'm just crying out
[2:26:03] to you cuz I don't know what else to do
[2:26:04] I don't even know if you're listening to
[2:26:06] me
[2:26:06] I don't know if you hear me I don't know
[2:26:08] if I did something wrong I don't know if
[2:26:10] I don't know I just don't know all I can
[2:26:13] do is cry out that's it
[2:26:16] all I can do is cry out and I I guess I
[2:26:24] want to say this you know to to those
[2:26:27] that have struggled or those that have
[2:26:29] been out of church or back in church or
[2:26:33] whatever or maybe you're dealing with
[2:26:34] something right now you've got a
[2:26:36] temptation you've got a whatever the
[2:26:41] compassion in my heart for you has never
[2:26:43] been greater never been greater I love
[2:26:48] you were the one we all have needs we
[2:26:54] all have needs like we all have needs
[2:26:58] I look at Josh my best friend Josh
[2:27:00] growing up pastor's son now he's gay all
[2:27:03] that stuff he had needs
[2:27:08] he had needs we all have needs and Satan
[2:27:13] will come in and in the season of
[2:27:16] waiting on God he'll give you what you
[2:27:19] need he'll give you what you need
[2:27:24] Satan will come in and and give you that
[2:27:28] substitute give you that it looks so
[2:27:31] good look so perfect it looks just right
[2:27:37] we have to be paying attention have to
[2:27:41] be paying attention and that's finally I
[2:27:44] found a leak of light and that was
[2:27:47] actually what it is
[2:27:49] pay attention before brother 1 started
[2:27:51] preaching this series on pay attention
[2:27:53] those of you that were here remember
[2:27:55] he's preached all these sermons on pay
[2:27:57] attention right before that I had a
[2:28:01] dream and because of the dream I started
[2:28:03] thinking it was like a haunting pay
[2:28:05] attention pay attention pay attention
[2:28:07] and then all of a sudden he starts
[2:28:10] preaching pay attention I was like okay
[2:28:13] god I'm paying attention I don't know
[2:28:15] what I'm supposed to be paying attention
[2:28:17] to I don't know like I don't know where
[2:28:20] you are I can't see you I'm trying I
[2:28:22] know you're here somewhere but I'm
[2:28:24] trying with all of my heart to pay
[2:28:27] attention and he's trying like
[2:28:33] everything just keep on paying attention
[2:28:46] except the Lord build the house they
[2:28:48] labor in vain that build it
[2:29:05] compared with me
[2:29:22] no matter what temptation you're going
[2:29:24] through in the last nine months I've
[2:29:26] probably been there probably been there
[2:29:30] like it's amazing how Satan will come
[2:29:33] and use your emotions and work it it's
[2:29:35] like I didn't get a full sleeve of
[2:29:36] tattoos that's good that's it's good
[2:29:39] that that didn't happen half the reason
[2:29:40] why was because I didn't you know like
[2:29:42] oh look where did that come from
[2:29:44] I didn't know um but really and I want
[2:29:49] to make a point here again cuz this is
[2:29:50] important
[2:29:51] bear with me I am sort of I think I'm
[2:29:53] coming to a close I don't know God God
[2:29:55] do what you want to do Here I am and God
[2:30:01] can still use me he did we had great
[2:30:05] song services I took some time off and I
[2:30:08] had brother Lawrence doing it for a
[2:30:09] while because I I needed that space but
[2:30:11] we still whenever I led songs why cuz
[2:30:14] it's just yielding to God has nothing to
[2:30:16] do with me and I once again I want to
[2:30:19] impress it on you get a hold of God
[2:30:22] yield to God it's beyond it's beyond
[2:30:25] this guy God can still move no matter
[2:30:29] where we are no matter if we're having
[2:30:31] this this in like little the greatest
[2:30:35] trial of my life I thought I've had
[2:30:37] trials worse like before but like now
[2:30:39] I've had it it's like wow this is this
[2:30:41] was rough it's not even people people
[2:30:45] have talked to me it's like it's not
[2:30:46] even just about a breakup because a
[2:30:48] breakup you were like okay get over it
[2:30:49] like it's fine you'll find someone else
[2:30:51] it's the surrounding circumstances and
[2:30:54] the surrounding years of like
[2:30:56] connections and like it's it's what it
[2:30:58] meant it's not what it was it's what it
[2:31:01] meant it's what it was connected to
[2:31:02] years of prayer and years of sacrifice
[2:31:05] and following the leadership of the Lord
[2:31:07] fought like to the best of my ability
[2:31:10] trying to follow the leadership of the
[2:31:11] Lord and it's like God like I don't
[2:31:14] understand like I don't understand how
[2:31:16] did you lead me here what happened but
[2:31:20] we have to
[2:31:27] sons of God are led by the Spirit of God
[2:31:30] and I've come to the point where I
[2:31:32] I prefer sit and I believe it I still
[2:31:34] have my days where it's it's rough I had
[2:31:38] one yesterday I dug myself out thank God
[2:31:40] but it's it's going to the word and
[2:31:44] truly accepting and believing the word
[2:31:48] beyond our feelings beyond what we see
[2:31:52] or what we think we have to accept the
[2:31:55] word God said sons of God are led by the
[2:31:59] Spirit of God God said he'd never lead
[2:32:02] us leave us or forsake us
[2:32:03] God said he's Jehovah Jireh our provider
[2:32:07] he said that and it's it's becoming more
[2:32:11] real to me and I'm honestly I'm probably
[2:32:13] gonna get tested on this tomorrow
[2:32:15] it always happens so pray for me like it
[2:32:17] does brother one knows this like you
[2:32:19] preach something and at least for me
[2:32:20] like for me I preach something I
[2:32:22] immediately get tested on it almost
[2:32:24] happens every single time it's so it you
[2:32:27] have to be careful not to fall into
[2:32:29] while I don't want to preach that
[2:32:30] because I don't want to get tested on it
[2:32:32] it happens like I have to catch myself
[2:32:35] it's like well I'm already getting
[2:32:37] tested on this anyway so might as well
[2:32:40] preach it
[2:32:42] praise God just wanna expose the devil
[2:32:45] as much as possible amen just want to
[2:32:48] expose the devil amen amen
[2:32:53] yeah but it praise God bear with me
[2:32:57] are you still okay like I'm okay I
[2:33:00] didn't see that many hands everybody
[2:33:02] raise your hands praise the Lord
[2:33:04] oh is it hey a second session oh no I'm
[2:33:11] almost done I think I'm okay I am almost
[2:33:15] done um I'm sorry I don't have no clue

[2:33:27] what I'm gonna do next time I'm just
[2:33:29] gonna come up beside hey brother we
[2:33:31] might need a second session
[2:33:35] I'm sorry I'm just teasing a little bit
[2:33:38] um I'll let you guys go pretty quick
[2:33:42] pretty good I'm sorry um I've come to I
[2:33:56] had a breakthrough and I'm just gonna
[2:33:58] say it there's a lot more that I feel
[2:34:00] like I would like like it just is what
[2:34:04] it is and I'm going to I'm just gonna go
[2:34:06] into it I had a breakthrough I hit rock
[2:34:10] bottom again like the darkest clothes
[2:34:13] like just I've been to the absolute
[2:34:16] bottom I'm so glad I didn't start
[2:34:18] drinking thank God it could have
[2:34:20] happened
[2:34:21] it could have happened because when
[2:34:23] you're so out of yourself you're just
[2:34:27] looking for something anything to
[2:34:30] satisfy that need
[2:34:32] anything anything to just take the edge
[2:34:35] off to help you escape from the pain
[2:34:37] from the torment from the hurt well just
[2:34:41] like and when you feel like you can't
[2:34:43] get ahold of God where do you go where
[2:34:48] do you go that's hard it is hard man oh
[2:34:53] it's difficult but I cried out to God
[2:34:56] and I finally found I don't know a form
[2:35:00] of rest in um no I'm gonna read you
[2:35:09] something I found a form of rest in
[2:35:14] simply crying out David talked about in
[2:35:20] the Psalms over and over and over you
[2:35:23] look at the Psalms there David crying
[2:35:25] out to God and sometimes we and it's
[2:35:29] good we ought to UM profess faith and
[2:35:35] those things are right stand upon God's
[2:35:36] word but sometimes it's letting go it's
[2:35:40] letting go in the god I don't even know
[2:35:43] what to say but I know you understand my
[2:35:46] heart that I'm just I'm bro
[2:35:48] can I don't even know I don't know what
[2:35:50] to say I don't know it's real I don't
[2:35:52] know I don't know what but I know there
[2:35:55] is a God I know there is a God God help
[2:36:00] me help me
[2:36:02] that's all I could pray God help me
[2:36:05] that's it and I came to that point where
[2:36:08] it's like that would the end of my rope
[2:36:10] the end of the end of being able to find
[2:36:16] something to pray other than God help me
[2:36:21] help me and um I can't find it I mean I
[2:36:29] won't read it right now but I've only
[2:36:31] had this happen twice in my life two
[2:36:34] times ever where it's like I was writing
[2:36:39] and all of a sudden something just came
[2:36:41] out on the page and it was perfect it
[2:36:42] was perfect it was inspired and it was
[2:36:45] exactly what I needed to hear and it was
[2:36:48] it was about fighting and I can't find
[2:36:51] it right now so I won't read it but it's
[2:36:52] it doesn't matter how dark it gets I'm
[2:36:55] going to fight I'm going to fight it
[2:36:59] doesn't matter I better find it um
[2:37:03] because this is important
[2:37:05] I feel led to go into this so bear with
[2:37:11] me
[2:37:11] I'm coming into a close 15 more minutes
[2:37:14] can I have 15 more minutes please
[2:37:15] okay really quick before I read this
[2:37:23] I'll share this quote that I found that
[2:37:26] is really really helped me from is
[2:37:29] anything too hard for the Lord you know
[2:37:32] sometimes when things are going wrong
[2:37:35] dark we know by nature that it's darkest
[2:37:38] just before day and many times when we
[2:37:41] see disastrous things happening like
[2:37:44] that especially to believers we must
[2:37:47] bear this in our mind that it's Satan
[2:37:50] trying to block the blessing that's on
[2:37:52] its Road amen we're taught in the
[2:37:58] scriptures that all things work together
[2:38:00] for good to them that love
[2:38:02] and no matter how bad it seems remember
[2:38:06] it has to be working for your good so
[2:38:10] I'm glad of that I'm glad of that amen
[2:38:15] and as soon as you get a little scared
[2:38:18] well maybe I haven't done this and that
[2:38:21] I haven't done that right then Satan's
[2:38:23] got that blessing conquered for you
[2:38:25] you can't get to it as long as Satan
[2:38:28] makes you think that and perhaps if we
[2:38:31] would listen to such things of
[2:38:32] temptation like that and would pay
[2:38:34] attention to them it would be that we
[2:38:38] would miss the blessing pay attention oh
[2:38:43] there's the last part as soon as you get
[2:38:46] a little scared well maybe I haven't
[2:38:49] done this and I haven't done that right
[2:38:51] then maybe you did something wrong as
[2:38:53] soon as you start to get a little scared
[2:38:55] Satan's got that blessing conquered for
[2:38:58] you you can't get to it as long as Satan
[2:39:01] makes you think that and perhaps if we
[2:39:04] would listen to such things of
[2:39:06] temptations like that and would pay
[2:39:08] attention to them then it would be that
[2:39:10] we would miss the blessing don't pay
[2:39:13] attention to the Giant pay attention to
[2:39:17] the sling pay attention to the sling pay
[2:39:24] attention to the sling because things
[2:39:25] yea though I walk through the valley of
[2:39:28] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[2:39:31] for thou art with me the importance is
[2:39:36] on that God is with me God is with me
[2:39:43] yes praise the Lord amen God is with me
[2:39:48] and that's the comfort that I finally I
[2:39:51] I'm still in it I'm in the thick of the
[2:39:54] fight but I know God is with me I know
[2:39:57] he's with me and it has to work out for
[2:40:01] my good I don't know what will happen in
[2:40:04] my life I don't I don't know what the
[2:40:06] future hold on I tend to be kind of a
[2:40:08] forward thinking like introspective like
[2:40:11] planning type whatever and I finally
[2:40:14] come to the point where it's like
[2:40:16] that's changed it's changed its that I
[2:40:19] don't know what the future holds I don't
[2:40:22] know we can plan things so well and
[2:40:25] calculate them out and it's like my hope
[2:40:29] has to be in God my hope and my trust
[2:40:31] has to be in God um and in God I'm gonna
[2:40:47] read this I'm just gonna read it the
[2:40:49] it's personal but I believe this was
[2:40:51] inspired there's only one other time and
[2:40:53] brother 1 no I remember this cuz I read
[2:40:55] the last one here and it came to me and
[2:40:58] maybe this can help someone else I I
[2:41:00] don't know it came to me and it is what
[2:41:03] it is I'm wrapping up I'm coming to a
[2:41:05] close you can put the clock back up if
[2:41:06] you want this is my sorrow this is my
[2:41:10] cross every day I raise up and I pick up
[2:41:15] my cross and I bear it empty broken
[2:41:19] hopeless and I get up not because I
[2:41:22] believe that things will get better not
[2:41:24] because I have any hope for a survival
[2:41:26] but because I don't know what else to do
[2:41:28] so I get up I get up and I fight I fight
[2:41:32] one more day bear with me because there
[2:41:38] there's there's a meaning there's a
[2:41:39] message behind this maybe today will be
[2:41:42] the last maybe I won't hurt tomorrow
[2:41:45] maybe it will all be over and I won't
[2:41:47] have to suffer anymore
[2:41:49] maybe a ray of sunshine will strike my
[2:41:51] face today and but for a moment I will
[2:41:53] feel its warmth maybe I won't die after
[2:41:56] all or maybe I will but I fight that is
[2:42:00] all I can do I fight day in day out in
[2:42:04] the darkness I fight I fight because I
[2:42:07] can do no other
[2:42:09] I fight not because I am brave I fight
[2:42:13] because I am afraid more afraid to stop
[2:42:15] fighting than I am to fight I fight not
[2:42:18] to win but to fight with no hope of
[2:42:21] survival but the aim to die with my
[2:42:23] boots on my sword in my hand I fight and
[2:42:27] bear with me this is strange
[2:42:29] there's a message and I'll say it at the
[2:42:31] end my name is loyal and I will fight
[2:42:34] not because there is some reward not so
[2:42:37] others can see not because I expect
[2:42:40] something or because of what I will be I
[2:42:42] will fight because there is nothing more
[2:42:44] I can do I fight because that is what I
[2:42:47] choose to do I fight sword in hand armor
[2:42:52] on broken and worn bloodied and torn I
[2:42:55] fight I fight I fight though I'm
[2:42:58] trampled muddied pushed down I fight I
[2:43:00] fight I fight I will fight I will fight
[2:43:04] as if it is my last I will fight because
[2:43:08] it is my last I will fight I will fight
[2:43:11] I will fight I will not quit I will
[2:43:17] never give up I will not be one of those
[2:43:19] downtrodden few who cower and quiver I
[2:43:22] will fight I may not win but I will make
[2:43:25] my mark I will stand I will get back up
[2:43:28] I will not stop I may cry and swear and
[2:43:32] curse the face but I will fight I will
[2:43:34] fight I will never give up now this is
[2:43:37] strange it's strange but it broke
[2:43:40] something for me and there's there's a
[2:43:44] victory in this there's a victory in
[2:43:46] this it's accepting and there's there's
[2:43:49] something in this yea though I walk
[2:43:51] through the valley of the shadow of
[2:43:53] death this is my cross it's not about
[2:43:57] serving God just for an outcome no
[2:44:01] matter what happens though he slays me
[2:44:05] yet I'll serve Him that was this point
[2:44:07] for me that's when this hit that no
[2:44:09] matter what happens I'll fight I'm not
[2:44:14] letting Satan take me with without my
[2:44:16] boots on I'm going to fight I'm going to
[2:44:19] fight I'm going to fight I'm going to
[2:44:21] fight and I read that as an
[2:44:24] encouragement to each of us you've got
[2:44:26] something we all do we've got something
[2:44:28] in our lives that Satan's working on us
[2:44:30] right now
[2:44:31] everyone does fight fight fight
[2:44:36] pick up the sword and fight him for it
[2:44:39] make him at least try have to try don't
[2:44:42] roll on your back
[2:44:43] let him take it fight fight is not even
[2:44:48] with the hope to win but to fight that
[2:44:52] I'm not going to let you take my land
[2:44:55] without me fighting for it that's it
[2:44:58] that's it I'm going to fight yes sir
[2:45:07] yes amen yes sir
[2:45:10] amen amen to fight amen yes to fight to
[2:45:17] fight to fight you look at um I can't
[2:45:22] even remember who it was now um had the
[2:45:24] rod of brass 600 Philistines were coming
[2:45:28] to take the harvest Shamgar he was not
[2:45:32] hoping to win but he just had enough
[2:45:36] he just had enough of it and he decided
[2:45:39] he was going to fight that's it so if
[2:45:44] you've got something in your life you
[2:45:45] are tired of Satan coming and taking it
[2:45:48] away from you taking away your joy
[2:45:50] taking away your peace taking away your
[2:45:53] hope taking away your faith don't let
[2:45:56] him have it
[2:45:57] you might not win but at least fight
[2:46:00] fight every day get up and fight fight
[2:46:05] fight fight because God is on your side
[2:46:09] God is on your side brother Branham said
[2:46:13] that I might pray for a thousand people
[2:46:16] today and they all died and tomorrow
[2:46:18] I'll come back and pray for another
[2:46:20] thousand because it is not up to me to
[2:46:24] make God's Word real or God's Word true
[2:46:27] it is up to God it's my job to take that
[2:46:31] sword of the word in a strong hand of
[2:46:34] faith and simply fight that's my job and
[2:46:38] that's your job - it's the same thing
[2:46:40] with this assembly it's only God that
[2:46:42] can bring the revival but is your job to
[2:46:46] fight when they went to take over the
[2:46:50] the promised land God said I will I will
[2:46:54] it's yours
[2:46:56] I'm gonna take it I'm gonna go with you
[2:46:58] I'm gonna go before you all these things
[2:47:00] but they had to fight and we're in the
[2:47:04] same place today we have to fight how
[2:47:11] many's ready to fight
[2:47:12] amen praise the Lord amen amen
[2:47:28] praise the Lord counting on that
[2:47:31] counting on that
[2:47:36] I'm leaving God is calling me out of
[2:47:41] Minnesota and I'm counting on that to
[2:47:47] someone to pick up and it's not me for
[2:47:51] the Lawrence is doing a great job up
[2:47:53] here singing but what we need is a is an
[2:47:57] anointing we need the anointing to fall
[2:48:00] I look at an aerial you go where God
[2:48:02] leads you Aaron Joseph brother Steven
[2:48:07] each one of you we're looking for an
[2:48:09] anointing of God to fall to lead this
[2:48:13] thing beyond and brother ones obviously
[2:48:15] got gods
[2:48:16] he's got the vision every joint
[2:48:20] supplieth every joint supplieth and I'm
[2:48:27] I'm leaving Minnesota and I've prayed
[2:48:31] about it for a long long time and I know
[2:48:34] that it's right and I know that it's
[2:48:36] true and and after that God showed me
[2:48:40] something finally for hours and hours
[2:48:43] and hours and hours and hours of prayer
[2:48:46] that he's been calling me out for a very
[2:48:49] long time a very long time and I didn't
[2:48:53] go I didn't follow the voice of God and
[2:48:56] God wants this church to grow and
[2:48:59] someone else to stand here other than me
[2:49:01] I believe that with all of my heart
[2:49:04] there are someone or people here that
[2:49:07] God wants to anoint to take
[2:49:09] thing forward into the next step I
[2:49:11] believe that with all of my heart
[2:49:13] absolutely and I don't know who it is
[2:49:15] I'm not I'm not I point you guys out
[2:49:17] because your other young guys and God
[2:49:19] wants to use us you know it's not it
[2:49:23] shouldn't just be MA and I know there's
[2:49:25] other sisters helping mom back there
[2:49:27] God is it's not a one-man show this
[2:49:30] isn't this isn't the first Church of
[2:49:32] loyal and brother one and sister Naomi
[2:49:35] and Ariel and you know this isn't it's a
[2:49:38] many membered body of Christ and this is
[2:49:41] God's church this is God's church and
[2:49:44] there's gone is is ready to do something
[2:49:50] he's about to do something I believe it
[2:49:53] and I don't know maybe he wants me away
[2:49:55] for a bit and then I'll come back or
[2:49:57] something but I see it I see the
[2:50:02] handwriting on the wall for me and God
[2:50:06] wants someone else to step up part of
[2:50:09] the reason for the service fight get
[2:50:12] ready to step up get ready to fight come
[2:50:15] join in this join in in this get in the
[2:50:20] game get in the game I'm sorry I kept
[2:50:27] you guys too long um there is room for
[2:50:32] more there's plenty of swords to go
[2:50:35] around there's room it's so easy to look
[2:50:40] at the next person over and say well
[2:50:42] they'll take care of it or that you know
[2:50:44] get in the fight
[2:50:46] do something find something that you can
[2:50:48] do
[2:50:56] I love you guys I love you guys so much
[2:50:58] I love this church I love what God is
[2:51:01] doing here and it seems so anticlimactic
[2:51:08] like here's my big trial and then I'm
[2:51:10] leaving
[2:51:12] I'm sorry I I didn't want to like if
[2:51:15] this has been the most difficult sermon
[2:51:17] ever to preach because it's it's it's my
[2:51:20] life and there's a chapter closing and I
[2:51:23] don't know what's going to happen this
[2:51:26] is the first time in my life where it's
[2:51:28] like I am literally stepping out on
[2:51:30] faith because I believe with all of my
[2:51:34] heart that God is leading me out all of
[2:51:37] my heart and there's a reason for that I
[2:51:41] it started a while ago and I stayed
[2:51:44] because I don't want to see this thing
[2:51:46] fail III believe God wants to do
[2:51:49] something here so I know he does I know
[2:51:53] he will and it took me being able to see
[2:51:58] that it's not about me someone else can
[2:52:02] do it it's not me it's not it's not me
[2:52:05] this whole anointing that comes it's not
[2:52:07] me
[2:52:08] it's God it's God God is here I believe
[2:52:13] that with all my heart that God is here
[2:52:15] and that he is doing a work and you can
[2:52:17] see it looking around um I'm sorry this
[2:52:21] is this is all very personal but um I
[2:52:24] love this church I look we've got a
[2:52:26] great we've got something great here
[2:52:28] guys I've traveled around the world
[2:52:33] ministers from everywhere said that
[2:52:35] there's something special here that's
[2:52:38] not to be patting ourselves on the back
[2:52:40] we've got a great a beautiful worship a
[2:52:45] beautiful worship a beautiful praise and
[2:52:48] God comes down don't miss it don't miss
[2:52:53] it make use of it get a hold of it get a
[2:52:57] hold of God God wants to move God wants
[2:53:01] to use you God wants to do something
[2:53:03] wants to take you to the next level the
[2:53:06] next level of faith the next level of
[2:53:08] pray
[2:53:09] the next level of worship let's not rest
[2:53:11] on our laurels and say wow isn't it
[2:53:14] great that we have this or we have that
[2:53:16] or let's go to the next level let's keep
[2:53:19] moving forward with God amen praise the
[2:53:23] Lord I don't really know how to close
[2:53:24] this thing to be honest um I just I
[2:53:28] can't close it
[2:53:38] [Applause]
[2:53:47] praise the Lord
[2:53:50] you see when I was telling the Lord to
[2:53:53] have another session it was not because
[2:53:54] of the time I didn't want him to be
[2:53:58] battle of keeping you long and skip some
[2:54:02] of the things that he wanted to say it
[2:54:05] was not because of the time and you know
[2:54:10] people who not understand you know how
[2:54:18] God leads a man for a matter of fact you
[2:54:24] know we come here we think and pour
[2:54:27] ourselves in the presence of the Lord
[2:54:28] the day it please the Lord and you know
[2:54:32] and he captures in an atmosphere of
[2:54:36] worship we were just saying if that's
[2:54:37] what what he want us to do that just
[2:54:39] exactly what we were going to do we're
[2:54:41] going to just follow the leadership of
[2:54:43] the Holy Spirit you know I don't believe
[2:54:45] that we have an impression machine here
[2:54:47] where we you know just put on and just
[2:54:49] preaching just preaching just bridge and
[2:54:55] most uh many of us even even with the
[2:54:59] Deacons you know the period of time I've
[2:55:03] had to say to sit with them and and talk
[2:55:05] to them and and and there are some
[2:55:08] things I would not you know I'm not
[2:55:10] obligated to come out and just tell you
[2:55:12] everything from the onset you know
[2:55:16] people are led in different ways the way
[2:55:20] they do
[2:55:21] you know the way they are caught in
[2:55:23] their ministry and I'm different
[2:55:25] like from as you know somebody else
[2:55:28] could be different from me and just like
[2:55:33] brother Lloyd said if I go back in his
[2:55:37] testimony
[2:55:38] I will tell you that I saw when he came
[2:55:41] from they came from those prayer
[2:55:43] meetings you know there was one one
[2:55:45] Sunday I mean came from their youth came
[2:55:48] one Sunday I came to service and butter
[2:55:51] scalp was waiting for me right to the
[2:55:52] door because Lord started praying and he
[2:55:56] was he just broke out in the spirit it
[2:55:59] was time to leave sons he just kept
[2:56:01] praying and kept praying and kept
[2:56:05] praying so he met me at a song door at
[2:56:07] the front door I said well the law won't
[2:56:10] stop praying praise the Lord
[2:56:16] at least he was praying amen and you
[2:56:22] know and and it's all because sometimes
[2:56:24] we get caught up in in the traditional
[2:56:27] ways that we do things and we think that
[2:56:29] if we step out a little bit like like
[2:56:32] this service you know people who George
[2:56:35] the service and and says well you know
[2:56:37] how can you take people time and say all
[2:56:40] of this well to them that you know God
[2:56:42] use the service of blessed blessed be
[2:56:44] your heart to death to those that are
[2:56:46] offended at the service may God help you
[2:56:49] praise the Lord because I don't take my
[2:56:52] detects from man I don't care whatever
[2:56:56] it is praise the Lord
[2:56:58] if I never felt led for the service to
[2:57:00] be like this I was a no matter how how
[2:57:03] much law was burden on his heart to say
[2:57:05] I will not have done it but I just felt
[2:57:08] it's the right time
[2:57:10] amen and I was blessed by every bit of
[2:57:13] it
[2:57:14] praise the Lord and as he to tell you a
[2:57:17] little bit of the history of the church
[2:57:19] and I walk right into this into this
[2:57:22] assembly the first time sat right back
[2:57:24] there and and then after a few services
[2:57:29] I believe it was sister faith that came
[2:57:33] to me
[2:57:34] one service and she said but one do you
[2:57:37] mind visiting us at our Bible study I
[2:57:40] said well okay I will you know and then
[2:57:44] I went in there one one just before
[2:57:48] church and these young people will meet
[2:57:50] an hour before church service was 10
[2:57:53] o'clock they will meet 9 o clock spend
[2:57:56] an hour in Bible studies and prayer
[2:57:58] meeting
[2:57:59] even before the service when they don't
[2:58:02] even have a pastor and that was one of
[2:58:06] the thing that kept me in many soda
[2:58:09] those young people I knew there was
[2:58:15] something you know it's net is net it's
[2:58:19] not normal to see you know this net is
[2:58:22] not an ordinary thing to just see young
[2:58:25] people wanting to serve God wanting to
[2:58:29] do what is right when they don't even
[2:58:32] have a pastor it's easy for young people
[2:58:35] to move to other church what they can
[2:58:38] have friends where they can have a
[2:58:40] pastor and have somebody to be
[2:58:42] responsible I left from that prayer
[2:58:52] meeting Bible studies that they in and I
[2:58:56] just I just said lord I don't know but I
[2:58:59] could just feel it I can feel that these
[2:59:04] young people have a heart they want to
[2:59:06] know God because they will ask you every
[2:59:09] question in the book you know and then I
[2:59:16] just want to say take what you say
[2:59:18] because you know you are a preacher you
[2:59:22] know and you know and you answer one
[2:59:24] question and then we will counter it
[2:59:26] with another thought but what's about
[2:59:28] this and then what's about the adding
[2:59:30] and and then over over the period of
[2:59:34] time you know I mean the Lord just did
[2:59:38] it I mean Lord kind of all fed on a mine
[2:59:43] on my wings as a friend you know
[2:59:48] the brother and I will not hold back to
[2:59:51] say as a son we talk and for people that
[2:59:58] would come around they were always think
[3:00:00] that maybe he has an extra privilege no
[3:00:05] there is nobody that hasn't have an
[3:00:07] extra privilege the thing that is that I
[3:00:11] believe that he's been able to
[3:00:15] understand what I'm doing
[3:00:18] praise the Lord
[3:00:20] when we started having live ministry in
[3:00:23] the church we asked all the other
[3:00:26] brothers to leave the sound room we turn
[3:00:29] it over to these young people that was
[3:00:31] birdie too you know to lead a song sound
[3:00:35] and everything and we just we just
[3:00:38] handle handle there is the spiritual
[3:00:41] responsibility over to them because
[3:00:44] that's their as the people I saw had a
[3:00:47] burden there the elderly people were
[3:00:51] there as supporters but these were the
[3:00:55] young people that had the burden praise
[3:01:02] the Lord you know so
[3:01:08] I mean he was just he was just
[3:01:11] everything he was just everything praise
[3:01:14] the Lord I will ask him to do and you
[3:01:17] know according and sometimes I would
[3:01:20] have to join him you know so he can he
[3:01:24] can feel like I'm punishing him and you
[3:01:27] know who come out of the speaker works
[3:01:29] and different things who do and but the
[3:01:32] reason why is because I was I wanted him
[3:01:37] to honest in what I'm doing you know I
[3:01:41] want him to understand you know my mind
[3:01:44] my ways of doing things sometimes you
[3:01:47] would talk so no no brother or any you
[3:01:51] know person have you know a kind of a
[3:01:54] special privilege and they are seeing
[3:01:56] the different things that he was dealing
[3:01:58] with I know to the Deacons it was
[3:02:01] strange you know because I know a few
[3:02:03] times they would come to me and I would
[3:02:05] just tell him okay let's do this you
[3:02:07] talk to this person go to her brother
[3:02:09] Scott to leader sons and in and out of
[3:02:12] there
[3:02:14] praise the Lord I think I preached this
[3:02:18] before and that is the way with many of
[3:02:22] our young people many of these young
[3:02:26] people just like Abraham and Isaac the
[3:02:33] law of that I have for the appearance
[3:02:35] made them to follow the appearance to
[3:02:38] the mountain to go in sacrifice and
[3:02:41] there was what Isaac did he was excited
[3:02:46] trying to be an obedient son just
[3:02:50] because the parent want to make a
[3:02:53] sacrifice you can see high everything
[3:02:58] tie in there God spoke to Abraham he
[3:03:00] never spoke to Isaac he spoke to Abraham
[3:03:04] if you love me then sacrifice your son
[3:03:09] to me and let innocent Isaac following
[3:03:13] his father not knowing that he was a
[3:03:15] sacrifice so is Abraham proving his love
[3:03:20] to God
[3:03:24] praise the Lord
[3:03:26] but then when Abraham relate the story
[3:03:30] to Isaac and Isaac got the revelation of
[3:03:33] it
[3:03:34] he was able to also submit himself to
[3:03:40] have that to be done
[3:03:45] praise the Lord if there were things and
[3:03:50] you know you know if I had to and you
[3:03:55] know just like that you know and just
[3:03:57] like I said I came in I mean law was I
[3:04:01] mean he was whipping before this also
[3:04:03] crying and I just came behind the pulpit
[3:04:06] I started leading songs he knew that you
[3:04:11] know the order has changed
[3:04:13] he went out of faith well maybe some
[3:04:16] expected that I would have preached the
[3:04:18] same on about him he was not doing
[3:04:20] anything wrong there was nothing that he
[3:04:25] was doing wrong he might look wrong in
[3:04:29] your eyes but it was not wrong yes yes
[3:04:35] young man they're pouring out his heart
[3:04:37] to was God I could have been like Eli
[3:04:42] talking to Hannah
[3:04:48] praise Lord amen so just like all of
[3:04:54] these young people some of them has come
[3:04:56] alone
[3:04:57] some have come to understand me some has
[3:04:59] net amen and and and even now when when
[3:05:04] it when it comes to death
[3:05:06] you know when when it gets to the place
[3:05:09] where is a young brother or maybe the
[3:05:12] young sister we're trying to work with
[3:05:15] you know and whenever it gets to the
[3:05:17] place were you know like like brother
[3:05:19] branham said in leadership we have to
[3:05:22] find our place you know there is a place
[3:05:25] word the young people must come on the
[3:05:29] leadership of the ministry and some of
[3:05:33] the dangerous thing is
[3:05:34] there is a lot of parental interference
[3:05:38] when parents want to feel that this is
[3:05:40] my child and why you want to do this to
[3:05:43] my child and what you want to do this to
[3:05:44] my child then you will be hindering
[3:05:47] their child from that time from that
[3:05:49] position of work you know the Holy
[3:05:52] Spirit must be leading him talk you know
[3:05:57] Lord and that's the reason why we relate
[3:06:00] to what we relate brother Ben call me in
[3:06:02] the other morning and you know this this
[3:06:05] security camera will always show
[3:06:07] musicians you can come up this security
[3:06:09] camera will always show anytime there
[3:06:12] was some motion after the Wednesday
[3:06:14] service I feel appreciate out of my
[3:06:15] heart and he wanted to talk to me we sat
[3:06:19] down right here until almost 4:00 a.m.
[3:06:22] in the morning talking we were crying
[3:06:28] we were praying we would get back to
[3:06:30] talking you know but bench verb and said
[3:06:33] my phone keeps sending me you know
[3:06:35] buzzes and when I look you people were
[3:06:37] sitting down up I said we were just
[3:06:41] having to all-night service praise the
[3:06:46] Lord
[3:06:50] you know there was one time Lord came
[3:06:57] and told me he was going to go to he was
[3:07:00] thinking about he was thinking about
[3:07:04] I think his office sending him to North
[3:07:08] Carolina and it looks like he came as a
[3:07:12] surprise when he told me about it I said
[3:07:15] go for it he said really I never thought
[3:07:19] that you used you want me to go and
[3:07:23] there are a lot of personal things we
[3:07:25] talked about I won't want to say some of
[3:07:27] those things but I felt in my heart that
[3:07:29] it was it was time for him to go he
[3:07:33] never saw it that time and but
[3:07:41] even out of this time when he was going
[3:07:46] through all of that I prayed I cried I
[3:07:51] was just telling him the last time we
[3:07:53] were talking I said I saw it when the
[3:07:57] Lord brought him through it I saw it I
[3:07:59] knew that we there was a light at the
[3:08:01] end of the tunnel
[3:08:06] look I've been preaching since I was 18
[3:08:12] years old this is my life I put my life
[3:08:16] into what I'm doing I put my life into
[3:08:24] it it's part of my life and the thing
[3:08:28] that is hard for a preacher is that he's
[3:08:32] not only burdened with your life
[3:08:35] it's almost like he's living part of
[3:08:39] your life that is the thing that is high
[3:08:47] for the preacher
[3:09:03] if you ask me personally you know if I
[3:09:07] will one brother law to go out I would
[3:09:11] say no one because it is somebody that
[3:09:14] that I understand you understand me in a
[3:09:16] lot and he feel free with me
[3:09:19] he can come and pour out his heart and I
[3:09:23] was just setting my chair for my hands
[3:09:25] and he would talk and talk and he will
[3:09:28] cry he would say I'm sorry and you'll be
[3:09:37] talking out you say Lord you just got to
[3:09:39] help us
[3:09:41] give me something to say to this young
[3:09:44] man and you were talking told said I
[3:09:46] don't want to take all your time I said
[3:09:48] take all the time you have praise the
[3:09:52] Lord and I want to say to all of you
[3:10:08] young people when we come in you know
[3:10:17] talking to you people no matter how I
[3:10:22] might say things to you it's with the
[3:10:26] heart of love praise the Lord and I pray
[3:10:41] that the Lord will help all of our young
[3:10:45] people to have a personal experience to
[3:10:51] be able to get hold of God it's not
[3:10:57] something that you know it's not a
[3:11:01] flower bag of ease we're going to have
[3:11:04] challenges and have challenges and I
[3:11:10] mean some of the brothers aaron has got
[3:11:14] used to me Ariel you know Joel you
[3:11:18] always try to run away from me and I'll
[3:11:20] call him set him down and talk to him
[3:11:23] because the thing about young people
[3:11:25] gets to a certain place we start to look
[3:11:28] for our personal identification you know
[3:11:33] and there could make us run into
[3:11:37] different things but you have to know
[3:11:41] that there are people I've been praying
[3:11:46] for you
[3:11:48] amen it's cool to see Josh was sitting
[3:11:51] there in a red suit I drove with him the
[3:11:57] other day and going to drop sister and
[3:11:59] jacket home and we were coming back and
[3:12:02] I reminded him something that he
[3:12:07] couldn't remember we were having a
[3:12:10] prayer meeting one time and he asked me
[3:12:12] a question he asked a question and you
[3:12:16] know and sometimes his mother would
[3:12:18] think that all these children are coming
[3:12:19] up with too much question and he asks a
[3:12:23] question and that question stuck on my
[3:12:26] mind and it had me to study something
[3:12:31] you remember when I was talking about
[3:12:33] golf passing and when Moses was in the
[3:12:37] cliff of the rock and the strange thing
[3:12:40] about it there is that I thought about
[3:12:43] that for many years
[3:12:44] steady on it for many years and they
[3:12:47] were preach it until recently when I
[3:12:50] appreciated so I was reminding him that
[3:12:52] that that give me an inspiration so
[3:12:57] that's the reason why I believe all that
[3:12:59] the father has given to me I can say
[3:13:03] that personally because I know I'm a son
[3:13:07] of God I mean all that the father has
[3:13:11] given to me I will come praise Allah
[3:13:18] amen and if God bless us and keep us
[3:13:22] faithful to him we will present them to
[3:13:25] him because he gave them to us
[3:13:29] let us worship the law
