[9:32] thank the Lord and we will say thank you
[9:34] also for all those that came out
[9:36] yesterday and those that were desiring
[9:39] to come and couldn't come. And uh I told
[9:42] brother Steve we were we were we were
[9:44] more worried about uh uh how much we
[9:47] would for the place. We never thought
[9:49] about the weather. Also, I think we
[9:51] supposed to be more uh thinking about
[9:53] the weather, but uh we we thank the Lord
[9:56] that we had a little time of fellowship
[9:59] uh an hour or two that we spend there
[10:02] and uh and I mean there was just too
[10:05] much food that we can eat. Amen. Praise
[10:08] the Lord. So, uh I took enough for the
[10:13] rest of the year.
[10:17] Praise the Lord. Amen. I told you enough
[10:21] for the rest of years. So, and we want
[10:25] to be grateful this morning to the Lord.
[10:28] Like I said, uh, Brother Jal and Sister
[10:32] Bridget had their baby. And we thank the
[10:35] Lord for that. And, uh, much as I know
[10:39] Sister Christine is recovering home, we

[10:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, so this being u
[10:58] late service gave me no reason to keep
[11:01] you late. Amen.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; It gave me no reason to keep you late.
[11:04] So, uh we just want to do something this
[11:07] morning. You know, I was just I was just
[11:10] thinking on uh uh how to get back to uh
[11:13] things I've been talking about. [snorts]
[11:15] Uh last night I was uh looking a little
[11:17] bit to get back to our subject on the
[11:20] anointing in the house rather. Uh but
[11:23] there there is an area there where I'm
[11:26] I'm trying to uh study on a little bit
[11:30] and I hope that when we talk about it,
[11:33] it will be a blessing. Amen. Amen.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; When we talk about it, it would be a
[11:37] blessing because actually uh uh what
[11:41] what it's all about is is to be able to
[11:44] help us to understand that uh uh the the
[11:49] eagle anointing.
[11:51] Praise the Lord.
[11:54] Amen.
[11:57] Okay. Yeah, that's that's right. Also uh
[12:00] brother Rafford uh is writing uh thanks
[12:04] uh praise the lord. See you have to
[12:06] remind me my friend is uh giving thanks
[12:09] uh also his wife had a baby back home
[12:12] &gt;&gt; on November 25th. So uh uh and
[12:16] everything went well. So we thank the
[12:18] Lord for also blessing their family.
[12:20] Amen.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We pray that the Lord
[12:23] will be with our sister and also uh
[12:27] bless our brother with his time here
[12:29] with us. Amen.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh uh like I was saying, I was
[12:34] I was thinking about uh just studying a
[12:38] little bit on that ego anointing because
[12:41] uh uh uh when you look at that uh you
[12:47] know many of the times
[12:50] we take
[12:52] uh the general thought of the message uh
[12:56] as being honor the eagle anointing. That
[12:58] is true. You know the message is uh
[13:02] under the eagle anointing. But if you
[13:04] look at it in the span time of history,
[13:07] you realize that the ego really never
[13:10] started flying until 1963.
[13:15] Okay. Now until 1963 now uh I mean for
[13:19] for some for some of us that not been
[13:22] following following the status from the
[13:24] beginning. Uh some of the things I would
[13:26] say might sound strange to you. That's
[13:28] not what I'm preaching on. I'm just only
[13:30] trying to make you to know what I'm
[13:33] looking into that when we get back on
[13:35] the subject. Uh uh it will it will come
[13:38] out to you. You see uh uh
[13:43] the uh uh Emanuel, you have my picture
[13:46] there. If you can just go back to it
[13:49] quickly.
[13:52] I know you have you have seen a thousand
[13:54] times it's getting boring to you but
[13:56] that's the only way I can I can be able
[13:59] to help you understand what uh what I'm
[14:02] what I'm trying to say. So just like we
[14:05] said the first three church ages was
[14:07] under the the the lion anointing and uh
[14:10] the dark age which is the age of
[14:13] persecution was honor the ox anointing
[14:16] the the bed and bearer. Now, the the
[14:19] next two ages that follow uh uh or the
[14:24] next three ages that follow, sorry, uh
[14:27] are under the man's anointing.
[14:30] Praise the Lord.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; They were all under the man's anointing.
[14:35] Now this is where we will understand
[14:39] uh you know many people uh uh with all
[14:43] of these believe the sign and everything
[14:45] they kind of uh you know people will say
[14:47] as well uh uh lacking said and and and
[14:52] even brother Brandon would tell you
[14:53] things that he said from Smith from
[14:56] Likings and from all of these people why
[14:59] because they were all under the man's
[15:01] anointing Pentecost uh the the
[15:04] restoration of the gate that that that
[15:07] happened at Zuza was all under the man's
[15:10] anointing. Praise the Lord. Now, so uh
[15:15] that's the reason why water baptism in
[15:19] Jesus name it was is not a mystery that
[15:22] was revealed.
[15:24] No, because under the man's anointing,
[15:26] the Pentecoster got that revelation.
[15:29] They were baptizing in Jesus name.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; You will even be surprised that seven
[15:38] sea is not a mystery that is revealed.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it has it was all it has
[15:44] always been there. It's in John chapter
[15:47] 8. Jesus said it.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; He told the Pharisees, "You are born out
[15:52] of out of fornication." They said, "No,
[15:55] the devil is not our father."
[15:58] &gt;&gt; So, it has always been there. Now the
[16:01] reason why I'm saying this is because
[16:05] from under this anointing you have
[16:11] uh
[16:12] uh uh you you
[16:17] under this anointing
[16:21] was the anointing of reformers.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:28] Right down here. Luther started from
[16:31] here. The just shall live by faith.
[16:35] Wesley brought sanctification right
[16:37] here. Praise the Lord.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; And the Pentecostals brought the the the
[16:45] gifts, the baptising of the Holy Ghost
[16:47] back to the church. But they were all
[16:49] under the man's anointing.
[16:52] Now so that's the reason why
[16:56] uh uh the crossing over to the capstone
[17:00] you find many many of us and many around
[17:05] the message still try to to practice
[17:09] Pentecost.
[17:11] Amen. You find many around the message
[17:14] they they still try to preach
[17:17] reformation. They're trying to reform
[17:19] the people.
[17:22] Praise the Lord. Either by changing the
[17:25] music, either by you know emphasizing on
[17:29] uh uh uh a certain line of thought.
[17:35] So you find that lot of that is stay
[17:39] around our cycles.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[17:48] more more preachers are reformers.
[17:54] Are we together?
[17:56] &gt;&gt; So you will see that right right uh uh
[18:00] from the beginning of his ministry. Uh
[18:04] uh uh uh there were a lot of things
[18:07] that's that's the reason why you find
[18:09] him on that evangelistic gift. Uh he
[18:12] rebuking the church. He rebuking the
[18:15] dress code of the people. He's calling
[18:18] the people out. It was all under the
[18:21] man's anointing. It was it was a portion
[18:24] of reformation
[18:27] until the seals were open
[18:30] &gt;&gt; before the eagle start flying.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:38] That was when the the the the the
[18:41] mysteries of God, you know, uh that tie
[18:44] all the loose ends were revealed.
[18:48] Now, so that's a portion that I'm I'm
[18:51] looking into and and I would want for us
[18:53] to to to be able to look at it because
[18:57] uh the reason there is that it will
[18:59] bring us to the place to know that uh
[19:02] even we oursel we can't carry ourself
[19:04] through a stage of reformation. We
[19:07] trying to stop this. You're trying to do
[19:09] this. You're trying to do that. All of
[19:12] that is beautiful, but you have to
[19:13] believe the word.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It have to be God doing it in you.
[19:19] You have to let go and let God have his
[19:22] way.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Or else you would just be going in a
[19:29] cycle after you have tried to do this,
[19:31] you have tried to do that, you try to
[19:33] stop this, you try to stop that, you do
[19:35] all of these practice, you realize, you
[19:38] come back again the very same thing and
[19:40] and and it frustrate many people.
[19:48] Are we together?
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:52] We have to learn to let go and let God
[19:56] do his work. Amen.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; Let God have his way.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Let the word of God take a hold of us.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; When Mary said, "Be it unto me according
[20:10] to your word." There was nothing she
[20:12] physically did but just to confess to
[20:16] allow the Holy Ghost to overshadow her
[20:19] to allow the Holy Ghost to form that
[20:21] child in her.
[20:24] And that will be the same thing that
[20:26] that that we will have to do.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; It will have to be be it unto me
[20:33] according to your word. When you
[20:36] understand uh uh God's purpose for your
[20:39] life,
[20:40] And when you understand all of this, why
[20:42] what God has been doing with your life
[20:46] because I will tell you that God has
[20:47] been very busy with you
[20:51] &gt;&gt; more than you think that you were
[20:52] involved.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; He's been very very busy and
[20:58] purposefully busy
[21:00] because the purpose of the Lord can
[21:02] never be defeated.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. His purpose can never be defeated.
[21:08] From the day that you were born to the
[21:10] moment that you will leave this earth,
[21:12] God's purpose will be fulfilled.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; And when you get to understand what he's
[21:20] doing for your life and and uh you know,
[21:23] then then it brings you to that place of
[21:25] rest, you know, then you can be able to
[21:28] enjoy the relationship that is between
[21:31] you and the father. But until then,
[21:33] you'll be trying this. You'll be trying
[21:36] that thing. It will just all be a guess.
[21:40] You did not make one contribution to
[21:42] bring yourself here. It was not your
[21:44] choice. It was his choice.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not your choice. It was his
[21:50] choice for you to be here. The one that
[21:52] choose you to be here had a purpose.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:07] Can you think about the think about the
[22:10] teeth on the cross?
[22:13] Praise the Lord. Think about the thief
[22:15] on the cross.
[22:17] With everything that he did to find
[22:19] himself to the place that he found
[22:21] himself, God's purpose could never be
[22:24] defeated in the last meaning of his
[22:27] life.
[22:29] Amen.
[22:31] at a place where he never even had
[22:33] strength to do anything. He was
[22:36] condemned to die in in in a in a a Roman
[22:40] crucification.
[22:43] And there he said, "Yeah, thank you. You
[22:45] can take it down." Uh uh
[22:48] you know, the purpose for his life was
[22:52] made.
[22:56] Praise the Lord.
[22:58] right there on the on the cross with
[23:00] with all the the crookedness and all the
[23:03] lies he had tried to use to to manage
[23:06] his own life. Right there on the cross,
[23:11] God started dealing with his heart
[23:14] that he could see that this man in the
[23:16] middle of the cross never did anything.
[23:18] How did he know?
[23:21] How did he know?
[23:25] How did he know that this man in the
[23:27] middle never did anything?
[23:32] &gt;&gt; It was all because that God purpose for
[23:34] his life could not be defeated. That's
[23:37] why God started dealing with his heart.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; I mean he could have been thinking and
[23:43] uh I see how I wasted my life. uh uh you
[23:46] know, I thought I would have I I thought
[23:48] I would have broke the bank or I thought
[23:50] I would have got money for my family to
[23:52] lay better. All of those things could
[23:54] have been going through his mind.
[23:57] But just in that last moment of his
[23:59] life,
[24:04] something started dealing with his heart
[24:06] that he he started becoming more
[24:08] concerned about the man in the middle.
[24:14] said, "You and myself, we deserve this."
[24:15] He He don't deserve this. How did he
[24:18] know?
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; But because God's purpose can never be
[24:26] defeated.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "You will be with me in
[24:31] paradise."
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; I like the way brother Andre said it
[24:36] that night. He preached for us that he
[24:40] was the last one that paradise was
[24:42] waiting for.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Because he got there not not too long.
[24:49] Jesus died, met him there and they all
[24:51] came out.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; He was the last one. Paradise was not
[24:57] complete without him.
[25:03] So God purpose for your life can never
[25:06] be defeated.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; God purpose and God is determined. No
[25:14] matter how stubborn you are, no matter
[25:16] what uh you know uh what what plans you
[25:19] are making for yourself, God is
[25:21] determined that his purpose will not be
[25:24] defeated.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; God would rather your be defeated than
[25:27] his be defeated. Amen.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's let's do something
[25:34] different this morning because we made a
[25:36] sacrifice to to be here this morning. I
[25:39] was thinking on this uh uh uh studying
[25:42] this the the other night. I was studing
[25:43] on the character of the men of David
[25:47] men. The Bible called them David men.
[25:49] Amen. David's mighty men. Davis Gillan
[25:53] men. I was studying on their character.
[25:55] I was studying on how how these guys
[25:59] became David men. Praise the Lord. What
[26:02] attracted them to David?
[26:05] Amen. What attract attracted them to
[26:08] David? And brother Brandon will say this
[26:10] in in the message in little baptis
[26:17] uh uh they got so they got so influenced
[26:21] by David. They that they love David and
[26:24] they they believed that he was coming to
[26:26] power in so much that
[26:32] the desire of his heart
[26:35] &gt;&gt; was a commandment to them.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to realize that Jesus is
[26:44] our David.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; He's the son of David. Praise the Lord.
[26:51] That's that is the thing that is strong
[26:53] in that statement. The desire of his
[26:56] heart
[26:58] &gt;&gt; was a commandment
[27:01] to them. Praise the Lord.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; That's what I want us to look at a
[27:08] little bit. I want us to just trace. We
[27:10] might not be able to do everything this
[27:11] morning. This is just coming from my own
[27:13] my own devotion and meditation.
[27:15] Sometimes things get on your mind. you
[27:17] are just thinking about it and and you
[27:20] know I was just studing it so I just put
[27:22] some some few notes together
[27:24] [clears throat] rather not really
[27:26] thinking about preaching it this morning
[27:27] but I was just thinking that uh uh his
[27:32] desire has become a commandment to us
[27:37] &gt;&gt; his desire for worship
[27:40] &gt;&gt; has become a commandment
[27:42] &gt;&gt; and I believe that's the thing that will
[27:44] give us a revelation to be in the house
[27:47] of God or that will give us a revelation
[27:50] to be able to seek the face of God.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Or when that when that when when his
[27:59] word says forsaken the assembling of his
[28:02] people, how he inhabit the praises of
[28:05] his people.
[28:07] His desire for worship has become our
[28:10] combining
[28:13] &gt;&gt; that bind us to fellowship. That is the
[28:16] thing that lead us into prayer.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; That is the thing that lead us into
[28:21] reading his word. It's his desire. It's
[28:25] not your desire because actually we
[28:27] don't desire it. Amen. It's his desire.
[28:31] Just like I said the last week, how how
[28:33] can we love you? The Bible says uh uh
[28:36] draw nigh unto God and God will draw
[28:38] nigh unto you. But Jesus said no man can
[28:41] draw nigh unto the father except the
[28:43] father draws.
[28:47] So it is not you drawing is he drawing
[28:50] you.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; You're coming close is because he's
[28:55] having the talk on the line.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; It's just like that fish that that have
[29:02] got a worm that is eating on and and
[29:05] does not know that there is a hook in
[29:07] his mouth
[29:09] &gt;&gt; and the f the the the the fisherman has
[29:12] to give enough line so the fish will not
[29:16] feel it.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; He will be swimming around and swimming
[29:19] around and chewing on the on on on the
[29:22] on the warm and swimming around and then
[29:24] he bring it a bit a little bit closer.
[29:26] When a fish is getting a sense that
[29:29] something is in his mouth, then the man
[29:31] give it a little bit of a line, but he's
[29:33] bringing it closer.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; And that's what God has been doing to
[29:37] us.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; That's what he has been doing to us.
[29:42] He's been using different things in our
[29:44] lives to draw us closer.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's been using different things
[29:53] as a bait to get our attention. to bring
[29:57] us closer to him.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Because he's going to get a rainbow
[30:03] trout. Amen.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; He's not just looking for any kind of a
[30:08] fish. He's looking for a rainbow trout.
[30:11] Amen.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going to get a rainbow trap.
[30:17] So, so that that uh that's that's what I
[30:20] want us to to be able to look at this
[30:22] morning. So actually our studic
[30:25] our study will start from uh 1st Samuel
[30:29] chapter 17. Amen. 1st Samuel chapter 17.
[30:34] There is there's a whole lot there in
[30:36] the in the in the scripture that we
[30:39] going to uh we're going to look at. But
[30:43] but first Samuel chapter 17 actually
[30:46] brings us to the place where David has
[30:49] come right into the battle with uh
[30:52] Goliath. When he have come bringing food
[30:55] for his brothers,
[30:57] he found himself coming right into the
[31:00] battle
[31:02] of Goliath.
[31:04] Praise the Lord.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So since I'm dealing with this
[31:08] right from I know there there just lot
[31:10] of verses here that we going to look at
[31:12] but uh uh I I pray that it become a
[31:15] blessing to you. Amen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Because it was really a blessing to me.
[31:19] Amen.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. 1st Samuel chapter 17.
[31:28] Let's look at verse uh 26.
[31:32] 1st Samuel chapter 17. If we want to
[31:34] look at verse 26, like I said, uh this
[31:38] is no reason for me to keep you too late
[31:41] today.
[31:42] Amen.
[31:49] Are we together?
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Let's look at verse 20. Let's get back
[31:53] to verse 20. and and David rose up early
[31:57] in the morning and left the sheep
[32:02] with a keeper
[32:05] and talked and went as Jesse has
[32:07] commanded him and uh uh
[32:11] uh
[32:13] Okay, God bless you. You can have your
[32:15] seat. Thank you.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you. You can have your seat. I
[32:20] know I know I didn't I didn't ask you to
[32:22] stand, but uh you can have your seat.
[32:24] Thank you. Thank you. Because I've
[32:27] already started preaching.
[32:33] And David rose rose up early in the
[32:35] morning and left uh and left the sheep
[32:39] with a keeper and took and went as Jesse
[32:42] has commanded him. And he came to the
[32:46] trench as the host was going for to
[32:49] fight
[32:51] and shouted for the battle. the man of
[32:54] of of war was screaming and shouting for
[32:57] the battle for Israel and and the
[33:00] Philistines have put the battle in a
[33:02] raid army against army. And David left
[33:05] uh his captain in the hand of the keeper
[33:08] for
[33:10] uh for the for the captain and ran into
[33:14] the army and came
[33:17] and salute his brethrens. Greet his
[33:19] brethren. And as he talked with them,
[33:22] behold, there came up the champion
[33:26] the Philistines of Gad Goliath by name
[33:29] out of the army of the of the Philistine
[33:32] and he speak I call him to the same
[33:36] words and David heard it. Praise the
[33:39] Lord. And all the men of Israel when
[33:42] they saw the man flee from him and were
[33:47] so afraid.
[33:49] And uh and the men of Israel said, "Have
[33:51] ye seen this man that is come up surely
[33:55] to defy Israel?
[33:58] Is to come up uh surely to defy Israel.
[34:02] is he cometh and uh it shall be that the
[34:05] man who kill him, the king will enrich
[34:08] him with great riches and will give him
[34:12] his daughter and make his father house
[34:16] free in Israel. And David speak to the
[34:21] men that stood by. Now, now in this
[34:25] whole story in David meeting the army,
[34:29] this is the first time he's going to
[34:31] speak to the men that stood by. And
[34:34] these men were men that were in the
[34:37] army. Praise the Lord.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because these were the men that
[34:41] that just shouted the shout for war.
[34:45] [clears throat]
[34:46] These were the same men that was getting
[34:48] himself enra. But when Goliath came and
[34:50] stood up, it looks like everybody just
[34:52] got frozen in their armor.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now David speak to the
[34:59] man that stood by saying, "What shall be
[35:02] done to the man that killed this
[35:04] Philistine
[35:06] and taketh away the reproach from
[35:09] Israel?" I love that. Take away the
[35:11] reproach.
[35:13] For who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[35:17] that he should defy the army of the
[35:20] living God? Now all of these men are
[35:22] standing up. They're looking at this boy
[35:26] uh saying this word. They are wondering
[35:28] I mean what kind of a kid is this? Amen.
[35:30] What is he talking about? And the people
[35:34] answer him after this man saying so
[35:37] shall be done to the man that killed
[35:40] him.
[35:42] And uh and El his other brother, this is
[35:46] David's brother now. When he heard him
[35:48] speak unto the man, he got angry. His
[35:53] anger was counted against David. And he
[35:56] said, "Why camest thou down Hader? And
[36:00] with whom thou hast left those few
[36:02] sheeps in the wilderness? I know thy
[36:05] proud and thy nothingness of thy heart.
[36:09] For thou I come down that thou may see
[36:13] the battle. And David said, what have
[36:16] what have I done? Is there not a cost?
[36:21] And he returned from him to uh towards
[36:25] another and speak after the same manner.
[36:28] And the people answer him after the same
[36:31] manner. Now he's keep asking what what
[36:33] will happen to the man that we kill this
[36:36] man? Praise the Lord.
[36:39] Verse 31. And when the words were uh uh
[36:43] And when the words were heard which
[36:45] David speak, they rehearsed them before
[36:48] Saul,
[36:50] and he sent for him. Saul now sending
[36:52] for David. And David said to Saul, "Let
[36:57] no uh let no man have fa because of him
[37:03] that seven will go and fight with the
[37:06] Philistines."
[37:07] And Saul said to David, "Thou are not
[37:11] able to go against this Philistine to
[37:13] fight with him, for thou are but a
[37:16] youth, and he is a man of war from his
[37:19] youth." Praise the Lord.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Which mean you need to grow up. He's
[37:23] been fighting since you were born. Amen.
[37:26] And you are just a baby. And David said
[37:29] to Saul, "Thy servant," now this is
[37:32] where I want to build my story from.
[37:35] David is going back and forth and he's
[37:37] talking to all of these army men that
[37:39] are all afraid of uh of of Goliath. And
[37:44] now he's he's uh for the matter of fact
[37:48] even his own brother tried to intimidate
[37:50] him. Praise the Lord.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; One from his own household tried to
[37:54] intimidate him. The Bible says David
[37:56] just turned away from him and then he
[37:58] went to another person. What what will
[38:00] happen to the man that will kill this
[38:02] man? And then he went to another person
[38:04] until the word finally reached to Saul.
[38:07] And here Saul called David in his
[38:09] presence. Now listen to this. And David
[38:12] said to Saul, "Thy servant keep his
[38:14] father sheep and there came a lion and a
[38:18] bed and took a lamb out of the floor.
[38:22] And I went out
[38:26] after him and smote him and deliver it
[38:29] out of his mouth. And when he arose
[38:33] against me, I caught him by the beard
[38:36] and smote him and slew him. Praise the
[38:39] Lord.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; That servant slown both the lion and the
[38:43] bear. Now all of these military men that
[38:48] are in the army, they are all listening
[38:50] to David's story. Sure. Okay.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; That's the picture I want you to see.
[38:56] They are all listening to David's story
[38:58] because who is this boy that is just
[39:00] running around and he's interested in
[39:02] fighting Goliath. But now when he's
[39:05] standing and talking to Saul, I would
[39:07] tell you many of them did not believe
[39:09] it. Even David brother did not believe
[39:11] it. Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Many of them did not believe it. They
[39:16] were just listening to to to David on
[39:18] the story. But see where the whole thing
[39:21] will turn. Because there is one thing
[39:23] for you to talk too much. It's one thing
[39:26] for you to tell people all that you have
[39:29] accomplished. They are watching to see
[39:31] what you will do.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; And I believe that when David got a
[39:37] result, WHEN HE BROUGHT GOLIATH DOWN,
[39:39] THE VERY SAME MEN that listened to his
[39:42] testimony,
[39:43] &gt;&gt; their word, he won their heart.
[39:48] Praise the Lord.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; There where he warned the heart of those
[39:53] men.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Because even though THEY WERE NOT THERE
[39:59] WHEN he killed A LION, EVEN THOUGH THEY
[40:01] WERE NOT THERE WHEN HE KILLED a bear,
[40:03] BUT NOW THEIR EYES, they have heard by
[40:05] the hearing of ears, but now their eyes
[40:08] have seen.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:13] Because Goliath that they were
[40:15] intimidated about, he's dead. He's down
[40:17] on the ground.
[40:19] Now, so you can see how they got
[40:23] attracted to David.
[40:26] This is a shepherd boy. How did he got
[40:30] this man that I call the mighty man?
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing where we going
[40:38] &gt;&gt; this morning? Amen.
[40:40] that seven slew both that verse 30 says
[40:43] both the lion and the bear and this
[40:46] uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one
[40:49] of them seeing he have defied the army
[40:53] of
[40:55] &gt;&gt; the living God.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; David said moreover the Lord that
[41:01] deliver me out of the paws of the lion
[41:04] and I mean he's speaking it with
[41:06] conviction.
[41:08] He's not intimidated by the faces OF THE
[41:10] PEOPLE WHETHER THEY ARE BELIEVING HIM OR
[41:13] NOT. HE DON'T CARE
[41:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNOW IT'S TRUTH.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; He's not telling HIS DREAM. HE'S TELLING
[41:20] HIS LIFE STORY.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. YOU SEE, DAVID WAS NOT
[41:27] PREACHING TO CONVINCE the people.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; He was preaching to convict them. Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; You see, when you're preaching to
[41:37] convince people, then you have to read
[41:39] bunch of co I'm saying yes and brother
[41:41] just so I can prove to you that I'm
[41:43] saying the truth. But you see, it's
[41:45] completely different when the Holy Ghost
[41:47] comes in.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; And and and and gets the attention of
[41:52] the people because he is the preacher.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; He's going to take that word and drive
[41:59] it right into your life story.
[42:02] ARE WE TALKING ABOUT DAVID? BUT NOW HE'S
[42:05] GOING TO TAKE WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT
[42:06] DAVID AND DRIVE IT RIGHT INTO YOUR LIFE
[42:09] STORY. THAT'S HOW conviction comes.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; If not, I'm just a lecturer.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; I'm just lecturing you on something you
[42:20] have heard.
[42:22] But I hope I'm not a lecturer this
[42:23] morning because I want the Holy Ghost to
[42:26] bring conviction to you.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:32] David said, "Moreover, the Lord that
[42:34] deliver me out of the paws of the lion,
[42:36] out of the paws of the bed, he will
[42:39] deliver me out of the hand of this
[42:41] Philistine."
[42:42] &gt;&gt; And Saul said unto David, "The Lord be
[42:48] with thee."
[42:49] &gt;&gt; First he said, "You are just a kid."
[42:53] &gt;&gt; But now he's convicted.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Because he KNOWS THAT DAVID IS NOT
[42:59] BACKING DOWN. DAVID is speaking with
[43:02] conviction.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT TREMBLING. HE'S NOT HE'S NOT
[43:06] SHAKING his trying to look for page and
[43:08] trying to frame his word off. HE'S
[43:10] SPEAKING WITH CONVICTION.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; THE LORD THAT DELIVER ME OUT OF THE
[43:14] PORTS OF THE BED. AMEN.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; THAT DELIVER ME FROM THIS HABIT THAT
[43:19] DELIVER ME FROM this sickness.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[43:25] &gt;&gt; That God
[43:27] will deliver me. Amen.
[43:30] Praise the Lord.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; When your past experience are not just
[43:36] made uh uh experience in the shadow,
[43:39] &gt;&gt; but your past experience are so real to
[43:42] you because you know that there is no
[43:45] way you have come out of that situation
[43:47] unless the almighty God reached his hand
[43:50] down and brought you out.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; And when you have those kind of an
[43:58] experience, you don't care how many
[44:00] times you say it.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; You don't care whether people have heard
[44:05] it.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; You know, or have not heard it. You're
[44:08] trying to make your point, so I must
[44:10] repeat it again. Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; You get tired with it, but it's part of
[44:13] my life.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; And Saul says, "Go. The Lord be with
[44:22] you.
[44:25] Praise the Lord.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Now, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE HERE DAVID IS
[44:29] NOT TALKING ABOUT HIS ABILITY. HE'S NOT
[44:32] TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, I TOOK STONES.
[44:34] I always have STONE IN MY BED. I HAVE A
[44:36] SLINGSHOT. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S TALKING
[44:38] ABOUT. HE SAID, "THE LORD DELIVER ME
[44:40] FROM THE PAWS OF THE LION. THE LORD
[44:43] DELIVER ME FROM THE PAWS OF THE BED.
[44:45] THAT SAME GOD
[44:47] &gt;&gt; will deliver me."
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:53] when we can talk and get oursel out of
[44:55] the picture
[44:56] &gt;&gt; and let people see the God that deliver
[44:58] us.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Let's see. Let people SEE THE GOD THAT
[45:01] HELP US THROUGH our trials.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Many time we we we get our right on the
[45:06] front page.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was enough to bring conviction
[45:14] to this man of war. Saul was a man of
[45:17] war. Amen. He was a captain. The Bible
[45:20] say he won battles for Israel.
[45:24] By the way, he was a Benjamite. They
[45:26] were very good left-handed people with
[45:28] the ball.
[45:30] Praise the Lord.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; But it was enough for a little boy,
[45:36] conviction,
[45:38] and passion
[45:40] to tell him, "God bless you."
[45:43] Saul said, "God bless you."
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; BRING MY ARMOR.
[45:50] THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT THING he will SAY
[45:51] IS BRING MY ARMOR AND DRESS THIS BOY.
[45:56] You know the rest of the story you can
[45:57] read it.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; But what we are trying to see how David
[46:01] got his men.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; How did he got those men for them TO
[46:09] RISK THEIR LIFE JUST because of his
[46:12] desire? Just because of David saying,
[46:16] "Oh my, I remember the well," he was not
[46:20] even telling him. He was just
[46:22] remembering Beth
[46:24] and remembering the fresh water that he
[46:26] drank.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; It became a commandment to this man.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I love the Lord. I love when God
[46:44] take you on a Bible story. Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; I love when God take you through his
[46:49] word and and then he starts to he starts
[46:52] to open his word to you. This
[46:55] [clears throat] man got attracted to
[46:56] David testimony after they saw the
[46:59] result. And you read the rest of the
[47:01] story, you will see how uh you know he
[47:04] uh uh uh defeated Goliath and all that
[47:07] was just shouting in the coming. The
[47:09] people were rejoicing uh uh uh uh all
[47:13] over the place. Are we together?
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Let's go to chapter 18
[47:26] chapter 18.
[47:31] Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; David has come back from war. Saul I
[47:35] mean Goliath is dead. Israel has the
[47:38] victory.
[47:40] Praise the Lord. The Bible even says
[47:43] that uh the the the people started to
[47:45] make music out of this fight. David K
[47:48] 10,000. Saul kid thousand. David K
[47:51] 10,000. Praise the Lord. But let's go go
[47:54] go on a little bit here. Uh uh chapter
[47:58] 18. Let's read uh uh uh verse five.
[48:04] Let's read verse five.
[48:13] If you read from verse two a little bit
[48:15] here, the Bible says, "And Saul took him
[48:17] that David that day and would not let
[48:20] him go no more to his to his father's
[48:23] house. And Jonathan and David made a
[48:25] covenant between No, Jonathan, they made
[48:28] a covenant because he loved him. David I
[48:31] mean Jonathan loved David as his own
[48:33] soul. Jonathan stripped himself of the
[48:37] rod that was upon him and gave it to
[48:39] David and his garden even to his sword
[48:43] and and to his bowl into his ghetto. Now
[48:46] verse five. And David went outsoever
[48:53] Saul sent him and behaved himself
[48:55] wisely.
[48:57] And Saul set him over the men of war.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Saul set him over the man of war.
[49:08] You have to realize that Abna was was
[49:11] Saul captain. He was the captain of the
[49:14] army. But Abnner has not come into the
[49:16] story yet.
[49:18] Praise the Lord.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Whether he was there or not, Abnner will
[49:22] come into the story later. But what I
[49:24] want to I want I want us to see now
[49:26] because David has demonstrated such a
[49:29] courage. Praise the Lord. He have
[49:32] demonstrated such a courage and and and
[49:35] and Saul is so convinced. He's amazed.
[49:38] He's confused in a sense of how can this
[49:42] little boy. But what I what I want you
[49:44] and myself to recognize not to forget is
[49:47] that it was not David muscles. It was
[49:49] not his talent is because David has just
[49:52] been anointed by the prophet.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; David has just been anointed by the
[50:01] prophet. He he he himself never EVEN
[50:03] HONEST TO YOU REALIZE that in that
[50:06] statement David never told Saul that uh
[50:09] Samuel came down to my father's house
[50:11] and he saw all my brothers and he never
[50:14] anointed them and I came from the field
[50:16] AND HE NEVER TOLD SAUL ABOUT HIS
[50:18] ANOINTING. HE NEVER TOLD SORD ABOUT HIS
[50:21] EXPERIENCE WITH the prophet.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:31] So I want us to keep that in the back
[50:33] part of our mind. The anointing is
[50:36] influencing him and he don't even know.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; The anointing is giving him victory.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; The anointing is bringing him into
[50:48] position.
[50:52] [clears throat]
[50:53] Glory be to God.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The anointing is bringing him INTO
[50:59] POSITION JUST LIKE HOW THE ANOINTING
[51:03] BROUGHT THE CHURCH INTO position to
[51:05] become the bride of Jesus Christ.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; The anointing is bringing him into
[51:10] position
[51:11] &gt;&gt; and he don't even know.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; I encourage you this morning.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Don't make a church out of this. Don't
[51:24] make a church out of this experience
[51:26] with the spoken word, with the reveal
[51:28] word. Don't make a church out of it.
[51:30] Don't make a religion out of it.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Because it's a relationship.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; It's a relationship. Is the heart of God
[51:39] for you.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; You don't need me to tell you. You don't
[51:43] need another man to tell you. You need
[51:45] God.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's doing by revealing
[51:50] himself. He's opening his heart
[51:52] &gt;&gt; to you. Amen.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; For you to see the purpose of your life.
[51:57] And when you see the purpose of your
[51:59] life,
[52:01] praise the Lord.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; There is nothing in this life
[52:06] that you can take above that.
[52:10] Praise the Lord.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; There is nothing in this life that you
[52:13] can take above that.
[52:17] My mind is drain kind of forgetting off
[52:20] here. But let's let's go on now. So the
[52:23] Bible says here in verse five, he make
[52:26] him
[52:27] he set him over the men of war. Praise
[52:30] the Lord. Amen. Let's drop down to verse
[52:34] 13
[52:35] in the same chapter 18.
[52:40] Praise the Lord.
[52:43] Saul set him over the men of war. But in
[52:46] the backp mind this boy is becoming
[52:49] popular. So what he did? He tried to
[52:52] jack him to the wall with a javelin.
[52:55] And few times David will will dod it.
[52:59] The anointing is keeping him safe.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The anointing is keeping him safe.
[53:08] That's what happen when you come under
[53:12] the leadership of God. You come under
[53:14] the anointed word of the hour.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It influence your
[53:20] choices.
[53:23] It takes away the desire
[53:27] from things that will affect your
[53:29] health. It keeps you safe.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:36] We have we have we have problem like
[53:38] like everybody has problem and uh but
[53:41] sometimes think about it how sometimes
[53:44] God will be so good to you
[53:46] &gt;&gt; that you go year two year three years
[53:49] you have really never gone to see the
[53:51] doctor
[53:54] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord it's not that you have
[53:56] not had pain year you have not had a
[53:58] headache you you have not had a cold but
[54:02] you just feel okay praise the Lord you
[54:05] just feel that a cup of water or maybe a
[54:07] little tinol would take the headache
[54:09] away from you.
[54:12] And sometimes we don't realize that the
[54:16] anointed word that you get down on your
[54:18] knees to pray to every morning
[54:20] &gt;&gt; that that anointed word you read every
[54:23] day that you you you take it personal.
[54:26] You are not reading it like a religion.
[54:28] You take it personal. Praise the Lord.
[54:31] When you read in the word that I am the
[54:33] Lord that heal up all your diseases, it
[54:35] becomes real to you.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; You are not reading it just to memorize
[54:39] Bible, but you seeing the person of
[54:41] Christ walking with you in your life.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; The anointing was keeping him safe.
[54:56] So the Bible says Saul tried to to to to
[54:59] jack him up or staff him up or whatever
[55:02] it was [snorts] and and he couldn't. So
[55:04] let's let's get down here. Verse 12, the
[55:07] Bible says, "And Saul was afraid of
[55:09] David because the Lord was with him."
[55:14] The Lord was with him. The anointing was
[55:17] working on his behalf.
[55:21] Saul was afraid. He was wondering what
[55:24] kind of a child is this?
[55:26] When I wake up at night to starve him, I
[55:30] meet him up reading his Bible.
[55:34] Praise the Lord.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can really find his sleeping
[55:38] time. Does he sleep? Does he ever find
[55:40] time to sleep?
[55:43] Praise the Lord.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; And Saul started becoming afraid of
[55:47] David. Not that David will kill him, but
[55:50] he just can't understand
[55:53] what is about this child. What what's
[55:55] about his life?
[55:58] Praise the Lord. Let's look at verse 13.
[56:02] Therefore, Saul removed him
[56:05] and made him a captain. Now, he was set
[56:08] over the army.
[56:11] BUT NOW SAUL STARTED BECOMING afraid of
[56:14] him and remove him and put him over
[56:20] a certain man to be the captain of a
[56:23] certain group
[56:26] the the the
[56:29] uh how you call it the tactical group.
[56:32] Praise the Lord.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; I said David you know you you are so
[56:35] scar so skillful. Yeah. You take these
[56:39] hund men or how many men they were and
[56:41] you rule over them. Now he's no longer
[56:45] the cap. You're no longer over the man
[56:48] of war. Now he's with a certain group of
[56:51] men.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Now remember, now you have to remember
[56:59] we're talking about military men and and
[57:01] and military things have never changed.
[57:05] You read in the Bible, you still read
[57:06] about ambush. You still read about uh
[57:09] conspiracy. You still read about betray.
[57:12] You still read about overtaking. I mean
[57:15] uh all of those things happened before.
[57:19] Praise the Lord.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:23] How David became or this man became
[57:28] David's mighty man. That's what we're
[57:30] trying to look at this morning. Praise
[57:33] the Lord. Are we together?
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Let's look at verse 27.
[57:38] You can do all your reading. I spend
[57:40] time to just skip these verses for you.
[57:43] Praise the Lord. Verse 27. The Bible
[57:46] would tell us here that uh uh there came
[57:50] a time. There came a time. The story
[57:52] behind this here is that there came a
[57:55] time where uh uh uh because now David
[57:59] has uh has killed Goliath. The promise
[58:02] was the king would make him rich and the
[58:04] king would give him his daughter. Till
[58:06] now David has not married to Saul
[58:08] daughter. Praise the Lord. For whatever
[58:11] reason only saw knows.
[58:14] Are we together?
[58:16] &gt;&gt; David position. For the very fact you
[58:17] read the story for the very fact those
[58:19] people started h singing some for David
[58:23] and everybody talking about David Saul
[58:26] became threatened.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. If I give this
[58:32] boy my daughter, I mean he can kill me
[58:35] and then be become the one to rule the
[58:37] kid. My son Jonathan is gone after him.
[58:41] You love him.
[58:44] Saul is now worried. So okay, I have to
[58:47] keep my promise because people are
[58:50] reminding you reminding Saul Saul you
[58:53] have not fulfilled your part of the
[58:55] deal. you have not given David your
[58:57] daughter.
[59:00] Praise the Lord. I don't know what was
[59:02] coming up in the newspaper those days. I
[59:04] don't know what they were publishing.
[59:05] But Saul was under pressure. So he comes
[59:07] here now and he says to David, let's
[59:10] look at this together. Verse uh verse
[59:12] 27. Wherefore David arose. Now he gave
[59:15] David this this thing that David must go
[59:17] out and kill uh uh uh uh uh a hund
[59:22] Philistines and bring the bring the
[59:24] false skin of those Philistines to him.
[59:27] Praise the Lord. And when that happened,
[59:30] he will give David his daughter. While
[59:32] David was gone for war, he took the
[59:35] daughter and gave her to another man.
[59:39] Praise the Lord.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:41] David came back
[59:44] the the daughter was not there. This is
[59:46] the same Lab and uh uh Richard
[59:50] &gt;&gt; and Leah story. Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; He sent David again to go and bring kill
[59:55] another hund Philistine. Bring their
[59:57] false skin. I will give you now and I
[59:59] will give you uh uh my other daughter
[1:00:02] uh Michael Michelle.
[1:00:06] Now, but this is what I want us to see
[1:00:08] here. This is what I want us to see.
[1:00:11] Wherefore, David arose. Verse 27,
[1:00:14] he arose and went. He and his men. I'm
[1:00:17] I'm I'm I'm trying to make the emphasis
[1:00:20] on how how now this was David personal
[1:00:25] mission. This was David mission. He was
[1:00:28] supposed to fulfill this so he can have
[1:00:30] the king's daughter. But now there are
[1:00:33] certain men that are be beginning to
[1:00:35] attach themselves to David.
[1:00:37] There are certain men that are beginning
[1:00:39] to fall in love with him. They like his
[1:00:42] word of life. They love his zeal. I mean
[1:00:46] uh he can worship. I mean when he get
[1:00:48] down playing the heart THERE IS JUST
[1:00:50] SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN.
[1:00:54] Now you also have to realize that these
[1:00:56] men were not there. They did not know
[1:00:58] that David was anointed to be king.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
[1:01:06] ABOUT HIM THAT they just can't put
[1:01:08] TOGETHER BUT IS DRAWING them to him.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; So David going on this personal mission.
[1:01:14] The Bible say he and his men they slew
[1:01:17] the Philistines. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:27] Let's go over to uh uh chapter 21. 1st
[1:01:31] Samuel chapter 21.
[1:01:33] We tracing [clears throat] David and his
[1:01:35] men. Praise the Lord. Now, as you get
[1:01:39] over to chapter 21, what I want you to
[1:01:42] realize here is that David and Saul has
[1:01:46] already break up.
[1:01:48] Saul has become so threatened. David
[1:01:50] realized his life was in jeopardy. Now,
[1:01:53] he has run away from Saul.
[1:01:56] Praise the Lord. Now, so the concept I'm
[1:01:59] trying to bring to us is that these men
[1:02:02] that that got attached to David were men
[1:02:05] that he met in the army of Israel. Men
[1:02:08] that he he saw in uniform that were that
[1:02:11] were trained soldiers and and all of
[1:02:13] these men. H but YET THEY GOT ATTRACTED
[1:02:16] TO THIS BOY WITH a slingshot. Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE COURAGE THAT HE HAD, THE
[1:02:22] MAN THAT COULD STEP DOWN THERE AND HE
[1:02:24] WALKED. HE DID NOT even hide himself. He
[1:02:27] walked straight to the face of Goliath.
[1:02:29] Goliath saw him and say, "I will feed
[1:02:32] you to the birds."
[1:02:35] GOLIATH LAUGHED AND SAID, "WHY YOU SEND
[1:02:37] ME A CAVE? WHO CHILD YOU SEND ME?" NOW
[1:02:40] THIS MAN SAW IN THE LIFE OF DAVID SUCH A
[1:02:44] COURAGE IN SO MUCH THAT THEY WERE READY
[1:02:47] TO BREAK away from Saul and cleave unto
[1:02:51] him.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] THEY REALIZE THAT RIGHT HERE WITH THIS
[1:02:59] SAUL IS just dictatorship and every TIME
[1:03:02] SAUL HE'S JUST PLANNING he I mean he's
[1:03:04] he's putting one man against another man
[1:03:07] in the camp and and you see this man you
[1:03:09] watch over him and he goes to this man
[1:03:11] and say you watch that guy he always
[1:03:13] talking about you he go to he just
[1:03:14] putting confusion among the people
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; they are not getting a good sense of
[1:03:19] leadership
[1:03:21] praise the lord when it comes to David
[1:03:24] it's not that David is giving a command
[1:03:26] and he's teaching them leadership. No,
[1:03:28] they are seeing it in his life.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; The way he carry himself.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you imagine when it
[1:03:38] was announced that Saul threw a javelin?
[1:03:42] Why? Why would he do that? I wonder how
[1:03:44] the David even knew
[1:03:48] Saul was a Benjamite. Those people THAT
[1:03:50] KNOW HOW TO HANDLE SAUL AND AND bow and
[1:03:53] arrow, THEY DON'T MISS. SO, HOW DID
[1:03:56] DAVID ESCAPE THAT?
[1:04:01] The anointing was working
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; on his behalf.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when we come out of tough
[1:04:11] things,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; we always like to praise ourself.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; We always like, you know, I was praying,
[1:04:17] you know, the Lord, you know, I you know
[1:04:20] I was really watching this. We don't see
[1:04:23] the unseen hands
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; that is keeping us.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; That is protecting us.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; We don't see it. We don't see the hand
[1:04:35] of protection.
[1:04:39] David was not announcing himself but
[1:04:42] these men were watching his life
[1:04:44] and so much they were able to detach
[1:04:47] themselves from the army of Israel. Now
[1:04:50] they all has become h fugitives they're
[1:04:54] running around with David no food
[1:04:57] David is David does not have money for
[1:05:00] them to pay their rent
[1:05:03] to send money to their to their to their
[1:05:06] family. What is behind this boy that
[1:05:10] they should LEAVE A GOOD JOB? THE ARMY
[1:05:12] OF ISRAEL leave their salary and they
[1:05:16] are stuck to this boy. Follow me a
[1:05:19] little bit.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Just follow me a little bit.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Chapter 21. Let's look at chapter 21.
[1:05:34] And David came to knock to uh Aima the
[1:05:38] the the the priest and Amela was afraid
[1:05:41] at the meeting of David now because
[1:05:43] David has break away. Everybody know
[1:05:45] that Saul is looking for David. So
[1:05:47] people are afraid. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; And he said on onto the land said to
[1:05:52] David run find out how the arrows which
[1:05:57] are shot.
[1:05:59] No no no. Is that what I'm reading? No.
[1:06:02] No. I'm reading I'm reading what
[1:06:04] Jonathan said to David in chapter 20.
[1:06:08] Should be reading 21.
[1:06:11] And David said to Ahima the priest, "The
[1:06:15] king hath commanded me in a business,
[1:06:17] and have said unto me, let no man know
[1:06:21] anything of the business where of
[1:06:23] ascending, and I've appointed my servant
[1:06:26] to such and such a place."
[1:06:28] Now therefore what is what is under your
[1:06:31] hand? Give me five loaves of bread in
[1:06:34] mind of what there is present. Now so
[1:06:38] David comes down to the priest here. Uh
[1:06:41] now the thing that attracted me in this
[1:06:43] verse as I'm listening to David's men is
[1:06:46] that uh it is not only that they just
[1:06:50] love David but they are also getting
[1:06:52] attached to his life of consecration.
[1:06:56] Because if you read the story here, the
[1:06:58] priest is going to ask David, "Have your
[1:07:01] men been running around with women. Have
[1:07:03] they been drinking?"
[1:07:05] Because the only bread I have here is
[1:07:07] the short bread of the temple.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; And I cannot give it to people that are
[1:07:13] not living the right kind of a life.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:18] So it it it gave us a thought that they
[1:07:22] were not just only liking David but they
[1:07:24] are now becoming attached to his
[1:07:27] lifestyle.
[1:07:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; If David is keeping himself in
[1:07:33] consecration, his men are also keeping
[1:07:36] themselves in consecration.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:43] Now the and the priest said unto David,
[1:07:45] there is no common bread under my hand,
[1:07:47] but but there is a hollow bread. If the
[1:07:50] young men have kept themsel at least
[1:07:54] from women, and David answered the
[1:07:55] priest and said unto him, of a truth,
[1:07:58] women have been kept from us
[1:08:01] about these three days since I came out.
[1:08:04] And the vessel of the young man are
[1:08:07] holy.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] So they are now beginning to attach
[1:08:16] theirel to David lifestyle.
[1:08:19] Their anointing is influencing them
[1:08:23] slowly. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Because the greatest the greatest form
[1:08:31] of teaching is a life of example.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The greatest form of teaching is a
[1:08:38] life of example. It's not all that we
[1:08:41] can explain and how we can break it
[1:08:43] down,
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; but the way we live it out.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; And that that anointing that is
[1:08:52] influencing you, that is guarding you
[1:08:54] that way, it rub against the people that
[1:08:57] are attracted to your life.
[1:09:00] Are we together?
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; They're influenced by David ways of
[1:09:05] life. Praise the Lord. Are we together?
[1:09:09] Chapter 22.
[1:09:15] Now it's good it's good to have you
[1:09:16] going like this. So you see how much I
[1:09:18] sit I I I sit there and just by the
[1:09:20] grace of God I'm just uh spending time
[1:09:22] and saying Lord just just just open this
[1:09:24] thing to me. Whatever it is just just
[1:09:26] show it to me that I be able to bring it
[1:09:28] to the people and be a blessing. I was
[1:09:29] not thinking about this but that just
[1:09:31] what dropped on my heart. Chapter 22.
[1:09:33] Let's look at it a little bit. Amen. We
[1:09:36] found a place to close here. We are
[1:09:38] right right around where I can leave you
[1:09:40] hanging.
[1:09:42] Amen. And then you go and do the rest of
[1:09:46] uh this study. Chapter 22, let's read
[1:09:48] from verse one. David therefore departed
[1:09:50] hence and escaped
[1:09:52] to the cave of uh Adelam. And when his
[1:09:56] brethrens and all his father's house
[1:09:58] heard it, they went down to him. Listen
[1:10:02] to this. Listen to this. and everyone
[1:10:07] that was in distress.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; This that this is the character of the
[1:10:12] people that was around David.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; This is the character of the people.
[1:10:16] When we think about mighty men, we only
[1:10:19] look at uh you know uh uh the
[1:10:21] associates.
[1:10:25] Mighty is not just in the things that we
[1:10:28] achieve.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because the Bible would
[1:10:32] tell us right here, these men were men
[1:10:34] that were distressed.
[1:10:37] They were the ones that were in debt.
[1:10:40] And everyone that was uh uh discounted
[1:10:44] gathered himself unto him and became and
[1:10:47] he became a captain over them.
[1:10:52] And there
[1:10:54] and there were with him about 400 men.
[1:10:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:01] So look at these men. Look at the things
[1:11:03] that they were going in. But yet in it
[1:11:06] all the Bible call them mighty men.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible call them gilling men.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] They were I mean they were h IN
[1:11:22] DISTRESS. WHY? BECAUSE I MEAN THEY don't
[1:11:24] have a permanent job. I mean they don't
[1:11:26] even have a an apartment to live in.
[1:11:28] They are jumping with David from from
[1:11:30] one cave to another cave.
[1:11:33] They have little children. They have
[1:11:35] wife. They have their parents. There was
[1:11:37] h
[1:11:39] no cell phone for them to be sending
[1:11:41] text message. I mean they were they were
[1:11:43] they were in some form of distress
[1:11:47] just like you and myself go through
[1:11:49] different form of distress.
[1:11:53] There are different things that comes
[1:11:54] up. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:58] No, yesterday we were we were going out
[1:11:59] there for for the fellowship. So, uh uh
[1:12:02] I went through there the uh you know uh
[1:12:07] uh Jalai bridge place want to see my new
[1:12:10] grandson [laughter]
[1:12:13] where I had their little daughter with
[1:12:15] us. Uh uh and so I took her home and see
[1:12:18] the baby and then uh uh and then we were
[1:12:22] uh Redeem was with me. So we were coming
[1:12:24] coming down this side to pick up
[1:12:27] something and and I wanted to pass
[1:12:29] through here also like I normally do.
[1:12:32] Just wanted to come and just do some few
[1:12:34] things before I head out there. And uh
[1:12:37] so just coming down and trying to get on
[1:12:40] on uh 100
[1:12:45] coming for 494 trying to get on 100 and
[1:12:48] and I mean the rose with with our first
[1:12:52] huge you normally experience there. Just
[1:12:55] slid it and went right in the middle of
[1:12:56] the road. My vehicle spin and uh I just
[1:13:01] just thank God nothing happened. Amen.
[1:13:04] But I was just thinking about it. So
[1:13:06] wow. Thank God that I mean I deliver
[1:13:09] that little baby or it was going to
[1:13:11] scare her, you know. Uh I know redeem
[1:13:14] also was a little bit scared. So came
[1:13:16] and then uh she had to go with sister
[1:13:18] Joy. [clears throat]
[1:13:20] Uh, and then I came and did what I
[1:13:22] wanted to do. And I left after after we
[1:13:26] left yesterday and and had to drop uh uh
[1:13:29] the reac home and on my way back. I got
[1:13:32] on on 35 South. The very same thing I
[1:13:36] just got off the exit. You know, I have
[1:13:38] gone over a black ice and, you know, hit
[1:13:41] the medium and just spin around and and
[1:13:44] uh, you know, busted the front of my
[1:13:45] vehicle.
[1:13:47] So I sat there and and I knew the
[1:13:50] vehicle time was up. Amen.
[1:13:53] I was saying to myself, I'm going to
[1:13:55] drive this vehicle until 500,000 miles.
[1:13:59] Praise the Lord. And I just sat there. I
[1:14:02] says, "Well, Lord, I thank you that I
[1:14:03] was able to drive the kids home and I'm
[1:14:06] alone that all of this happened and
[1:14:08] just, you know, did what I could do and
[1:14:10] just got home." But I'm I'm just saying
[1:14:12] that we go through different form of
[1:14:15] distress.
[1:14:16] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You
[1:14:19] see, but but until sometimes you tell
[1:14:22] people, it's not something that you wear
[1:14:25] on your face.
[1:14:27] And it's not because you are not hanging
[1:14:29] your face down and and complaining. It
[1:14:32] does not means that you don't have
[1:14:33] problems.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; But you see uh that's the reason why God
[1:14:44] symbolize his anointing
[1:14:46] with oil. And what oil does is that it
[1:14:50] shine your face. Just use some oil on
[1:14:52] your face. You see how bright your face
[1:14:54] is going to shine. [laughter]
[1:14:58] AND BECAUSE WE COME ON the anointing of
[1:15:00] his word, it brighten our face.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; It brightened our FAITH THAT SOMETIMES
[1:15:08] SOME of the painful things you are going
[1:15:10] through, THERE IS NO WAY THAT people
[1:15:12] will ever be able to tell
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; unless you tell them.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see that's the
[1:15:22] reason why God could look down on GIDEON
[1:15:25] AND SAY, "THOU MIGHTY MAN OF VALOR." GOD
[1:15:28] COULD CALL HIM MIGHTY NOT BECAUSE OF THE
[1:15:31] THINGS around him. Because Gideon was
[1:15:33] afraid,
[1:15:36] but God was looking at a supernatural
[1:15:40] element. God was looking at a seed of
[1:15:44] God in you when he call you mighty. AND
[1:15:47] WHEN GOD THINK OF YOU MIGHTY AND THINK
[1:15:50] OF YOU being his son or being his
[1:15:52] daughter, it's not because of any of
[1:15:54] your athlete achievement.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; It's because of what he put in you
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; and because of what
[1:16:04] only he can see.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; When other when other don't think that
[1:16:10] you are a good child of God or a good
[1:16:12] son of God, God sees different.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; When all saw a shepherd boy, God saw a
[1:16:21] cake.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; When even JESSE HIS FATHER THOUGHT THAT
[1:16:27] HE WAS JUST GOOD TO KEEP SHEEPS because
[1:16:29] he was small, God saw a cake.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT THIS THIS WAS THE PLACE THAT
[1:16:38] THAT REALLY, like I said, I want I want
[1:16:40] to see if I can close here. This was the
[1:16:42] place that really got me.
[1:16:46] It got me so much that in my notes I
[1:16:49] highlighted it. I just I just brighten
[1:16:51] it.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; I said because this is it. This is
[1:16:54] really what it is. This is what these
[1:16:57] men were made of. They had depths.
[1:17:00] [snorts]
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; They had things going on. But when it
[1:17:03] cames to what matters,
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; When it cames to what matters.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE FIRST THING OF THEIR LIFE.
[1:17:13] THEY WERE not making excuses. Oh, you
[1:17:14] know, I'm not paying my rent here or you
[1:17:16] know, my my I don't have a car here or
[1:17:18] YOU KNOW THAT. NO, WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES
[1:17:21] TO WHAT MATTERS,
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING WAS WAS LESS IMPORTANT. WHY
[1:17:26] WOULD THIS MAN BE BROKE AND IN DEPTH?
[1:17:29] WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO RISK THEIR LIFE
[1:17:31] TO GET DAVID A CUP of water when they
[1:17:33] could go and and take care of their
[1:17:35] family?
[1:17:37] They could go and and and AND FIND SOME
[1:17:38] KIND OF A JOB TO PAY OFF THEIR DEBTS.
[1:17:42] WHY WOULD GIVING DAVID A CUP OF WATER
[1:17:44] BECOME SO MUCH important
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; than them taking care of their own
[1:17:48] problems?
[1:17:51] Why?
[1:18:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:05] Amen.
[1:18:11] We must ask ourself why why would living
[1:18:14] right become so much problem
[1:18:18] when sometime there are things that you
[1:18:20] could do and nobody will know.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; There are things that you could do and
[1:18:26] nobody will know
[1:18:29] and your life could be a little bit
[1:18:30] better. But why is living right so
[1:18:34] important to you?
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:40] Why is living right, doing the right
[1:18:42] thing? Why is it so important to you?
[1:18:44] WHY IS READING YOUR BIBLE SO IMPORTANT
[1:18:47] TO YOU?
[1:18:50] Praise the Lord. There is no card where
[1:18:53] you read your Bible. You have to bring
[1:18:54] it to church every Sunday. Let's look at
[1:18:56] and see uh uh what book you have read
[1:18:58] and and and how far you are. There is no
[1:19:01] nobody taking record on you.
[1:19:12] Man, I mean this caught my mind
[1:19:17] that these men.
[1:19:20] They were in distress.
[1:19:26] They were in debt.
[1:19:30] Praise the Lord. That's the life of the
[1:19:34] mighty of David.
[1:19:38] Praise the Lord. They have something
[1:19:41] going on. They have something going on.
[1:19:45] Amen. They have something going on.
[1:19:48] Some of them have family problems.
[1:19:51] Some of them were not married.
[1:19:54] Some of them their children went astray.
[1:19:57] THEY HAD ALL FAMILY PROBLEMS.
[1:20:05] You see what it is when you when you
[1:20:06] just when you put the word of God in a
[1:20:09] context of your life.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; They were not CALLED MIGHTY MEN BECAUSE
[1:20:15] THEIR THEIR LIFE WERE PERFECT. THEY WERE
[1:20:18] NOT CALLED MIGHTY MEN BECAUSE I MEAN
[1:20:19] THEY HAD EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND
[1:20:21] EVERYTHING WAS GOING RIGHT for them.
[1:20:24] David was not king yet. He never had no
[1:20:26] money. How was he paying these people?
[1:20:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; And you think about it, the things that
[1:20:34] we do for the Lord.
[1:20:40] Who paying you to clean the church
[1:20:42] building? Who paying you to come and do
[1:20:44] things around the church and and the
[1:20:46] things that you are doing? Brother
[1:20:47] Steve, who paying you to keep the books?
[1:20:51] Who pay you?
[1:20:55] But yet there is SOMETHING IN OUR LIFE
[1:20:57] THAT makes you you feel committed to
[1:21:00] that.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; You feel committed to that.
[1:21:08] That when THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT
[1:21:11] YOUR MIND, YOU HAVING A LOT OF THINGS
[1:21:13] GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE, BUT THEN WHEN
[1:21:14] THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG AROUND THE
[1:21:16] HOUSE OF GOD OR SOMETHING WRONG IN THE
[1:21:18] LIFE OF A BATTLE YOUR MIND, I SAFE TO
[1:21:21] SAY YOU DON'T HAVE NO OTHER PROBLEM IN
[1:21:23] THE WORD.
[1:21:27] THE GUYS WERE NOT ON SALARY.
[1:21:32] Some had children to feed wife to send
[1:21:35] money to. They did not know how to work.
[1:21:37] They were fugitive running around with
[1:21:39] David.
[1:21:44] We read the scripture we get there. When
[1:21:46] David took over, he made them captains.
[1:21:52] He rewarded it.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; When David took over, he rewarded it.
[1:22:14] If we only serving God because of what
[1:22:17] we want to get in this life,
[1:22:20] You are of all men, Paul say miserable.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; You'll be miserable because you will be
[1:22:27] disappointed.
[1:22:31] If we are only serving God because of
[1:22:33] what we want to get in this life,
[1:22:43] hoping that our life on earth will
[1:22:44] become better. will get some kind of a
[1:22:46] paradise and people will be working for
[1:22:48] us.
[1:22:57] They have things going on in their life
[1:23:00] just like you have things going on in
[1:23:02] your life.
[1:23:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; But you see, God was using all of those
[1:23:13] situation going on in their lives.
[1:23:23] And I sure believe. Let me take one
[1:23:25] more. What's the time here? Two minutes
[1:23:28] to one. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Can we take one more? Will you allow me?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Let me take one more and then we close
[1:23:35] here.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Find a place to close.
[1:23:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:41] [clears throat]
[1:23:42] And I want to take this in a little form
[1:23:44] of contracts. I'll read some few things,
[1:23:46] brother Brandham to you. Yeah, maybe
[1:23:50] let's let's do that.
[1:23:53] God's gift always find his place.
[1:23:55] [clears throat]
[1:23:56] Let's read something here and and bring
[1:23:59] us then I will take their portion and
[1:24:02] close. And how that these Gillan men
[1:24:05] know noring David was anointed and was
[1:24:08] going to to come king someday.
[1:24:12] Very unpopular day because he was a
[1:24:15] fugitive among his people. But one day
[1:24:19] his call comes. They had gilling men
[1:24:23] with him. And remember
[1:24:26] these those men were Gentiles.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Most every one of them were Gentiles.
[1:24:33] a very beautiful type of today.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; When you read the book of Acts,
[1:24:43] I think Acts chapter 15 in the council
[1:24:45] of the believers, you will see where
[1:24:47] James when they were talking about the
[1:24:50] Gentiles coming in. You will see where
[1:24:52] James talks, he took the prophecy from
[1:24:55] Amos talking about the tabernacle of
[1:24:57] David. When God promised the tabernacle
[1:25:00] of David. James is taking that promise
[1:25:03] of the tabernacle of David and he's
[1:25:05] attaching it to the Gentiles that are
[1:25:07] coming in.
[1:25:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so you will see that uh these
[1:25:14] men that were Gentiles, they [snorts]
[1:25:16] were our fathers. They were not in the
[1:25:18] covenant of Abraham.
[1:25:21] BECAUSE OF THE POSITION THAT THEY TOOK,
[1:25:25] BECAUSE OF THE ZEAL THAT THEY HAD TO
[1:25:28] STAND WITH DAVID. YOU AND MYSELF, we are
[1:25:30] sitting under the grace of God and
[1:25:32] enjoying the blessings of God. WE ARE
[1:25:34] ENJOYING THE GRACE that has come to us
[1:25:37] freely
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; that sometime we don't show enough
[1:25:40] appreciation for.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; But it was their blessings that we are
[1:25:45] enjoying.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BECAUSE THE STOOL WITH
[1:25:51] A SON OF David
[1:25:53] or David himself.
[1:25:56] Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS REWARDED US OF HIS GRACE
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; IN SO MUCH THAT JAMES WILL HE WILL HE
[1:26:05] WILL STOP THE COUNCIL OF JEWISH
[1:26:07] BELIEVERS AND SAYS DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
[1:26:09] GOD promised
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; to do A WORK. YOU REMEMBER THE
[1:26:14] TABERNACLE OF David
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; who built those tabernacle
[1:26:19] were gentiles.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; So when we say that we are saved by
[1:26:27] grace,
[1:26:29] there was somebody that did the work
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; for you to enjoy the grace.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] Now, so they were gent, gilling men.
[1:26:42] Remember those were gentile. Most every
[1:26:45] one of them were gentile. A very
[1:26:46] beautiful type of today. And one man was
[1:26:50] so gilling he killed 800 men with his
[1:26:54] spear himself. And one day another one
[1:26:56] standing in the field of lentils and an
[1:27:00] army come up, a troop. And all of them
[1:27:03] run. and he stood there and slayed men
[1:27:06] until his arm was tired.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Well, all of those things they doing,
[1:27:10] they get bills, they had deaths,
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; They have families.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Sometimes where people will get so so
[1:27:26] overwhelmed. Oh, I've been serving the
[1:27:28] Lord. you know, I've been serving the
[1:27:29] Lord and all the time I've been serving
[1:27:31] the Lord and Lord, what what have you
[1:27:34] and then you we just bring it into into
[1:27:41] that a man will be running after
[1:27:45] running the battle with a fugitive
[1:27:47] fighting
[1:27:51] so much that his arm was tired.
[1:27:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:58] Amen.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; And then another one, how he jump into a
[1:28:10] pit
[1:28:12] and kill a lion on a snowly day. Amen. A
[1:28:16] day like this.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; It's called every word.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; And that's why let's let's kill our own
[1:28:24] giant. Amen.
[1:28:25] Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Let's kill our giant.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Let's let's come together. Let's kill
[1:28:33] our owner giant.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Or our own lion because the devil is a
[1:28:37] rolling lion seeking for to devour.
[1:28:39] Amen. But you just think about it. You
[1:28:42] just think about it. What what
[1:28:45] importance is that when there are other
[1:28:47] things important in life?
[1:28:51] Whatever his name was,
[1:28:53] I can't even think about the gentile
[1:28:55] name to give him. I would have asked
[1:28:57] him, have you b a house for your family
[1:28:59] before you killing lion?
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; You be house for your family. When you
[1:29:03] die, your children will get place to
[1:29:05] stay. You killing lion. Whatever his
[1:29:08] name was,
[1:29:12] what are you leaving? What are you
[1:29:13] living as an inheritance? I would have
[1:29:15] loved to ask him those question.
[1:29:18] Or is it a lion skin you going to pour
[1:29:20] on the wall? How big is that lion that
[1:29:22] you can make a tent for your children to
[1:29:24] sleep on?
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying there to bring certain
[1:29:31] things in context.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; The Bible says they were men of like
[1:29:37] passion.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; They have all the same things that we
[1:29:45] are dealing with in our life.
[1:29:48] Don't get me wrong. Don't get me wrong.
[1:29:50] Don't throw me on the side to think that
[1:29:52] if you do those things,
[1:29:55] you are wrong. You are out of the will
[1:29:56] of God. No. But I'm just trying to tell
[1:29:59] you that they had need in your life.
[1:30:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Until we leave this body, the needs will
[1:30:06] never finish.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; After you have saw one, another one will
[1:30:09] come up.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. They will come up. They are just
[1:30:16] like rent. a mortgage.
[1:30:20] That's just how it is. As soon you pay
[1:30:22] the rent, you smile. 30 days is coming.
[1:30:26] After the 15, the 20, then you start
[1:30:28] thinking again,
[1:30:30] man, I need to pay this rent.
[1:30:34] Praise the Lord. But I'm I'm I'm trying
[1:30:36] to say all of those things were there.
[1:30:38] It never took
[1:30:41] what
[1:30:42] they thought it was important.
[1:30:46] Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; It never it never it never took it from
[1:30:50] them. They had all of these things in
[1:30:52] their life. But what was major to them?
[1:30:57] These men, they were said sit at night
[1:31:00] with David and tell and and said,
[1:31:02] "David, can you remember that day when
[1:31:04] you came to the army? Let me be let me
[1:31:06] be honest with you. When you came, I
[1:31:08] look you up and down.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; I said this one, I would slap him.
[1:31:14] You think have fun we playing here that
[1:31:17] day when I look at you David I say who
[1:31:20] child is this
[1:31:23] people water time they ain't taking care
[1:31:24] of their children allowing their
[1:31:26] children to run I just thought you run
[1:31:28] away run away from home
[1:31:31] the other guy says it's funny the same
[1:31:34] thing you were thinking I was thinking
[1:31:35] about it I wanted to beat the video
[1:31:39] I wanted to be by way
[1:31:43] because we haven't challenged change.
[1:31:45] Everybody running there. He here running
[1:31:47] around. What would the king do?
[1:31:50] What would the king
[1:31:54] and sitting down with David?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; So, you know, when you started to talk
[1:32:01] about you killed a lion,
[1:32:05] man, I was thinking
[1:32:08] some of these children, they can lie.
[1:32:15] that he is sleep lion
[1:32:19] you can kill fly before you kill lion
[1:32:22] that's why I was thinking in my mind
[1:32:27] praise the lord because you see
[1:32:29] sometimes it take conviction
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; now these guys were convicted they know
[1:32:33] that David was the real deal
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; praise the lord they know that it was
[1:32:38] the real deal THEY NEVER HAD THEY HAD
[1:32:40] never had nothing in them for them to
[1:32:41] hide I MEAN THEY HAVE STUCK THEIR LIFE
[1:32:43] WITH THIS MAN. THEY'RE READY TO DIE FOR
[1:32:45] HIM.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; And then they will go about and tell
[1:32:52] David,
[1:32:54] say a little bit, how did it happen? How
[1:32:56] did you kill the lion? Did it came on
[1:32:58] you and how did you do?
[1:33:01] And while David is talking this,
[1:33:05] they are imagining in their mind themsel
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; if this boy of this age can kill the
[1:33:11] lion.
[1:33:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; If I see a lion, I might try.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; AND AS DAVID TALKS ABOUT IT MORE AND
[1:33:23] MORE and more, what makes you have the
[1:33:26] desire to lay your hands on the sick to
[1:33:28] pray?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY? WHY CREATE IN YOU THE THE
[1:33:34] DESIRE THAT OR WHEN THERE IS A NEED, YOU
[1:33:36] BELIEVE THAT GOD CAN HEAL THE PERSON,
[1:33:38] THAT GOD CAN RAISE THEM UP. WHAT MAKES
[1:33:41] THAT? BECAUSE YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT.
[1:33:43] YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE HEARD
[1:33:45] ABOUT IT that you want to experience it.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AND OVER
[1:33:52] ABOUT KILLING THE LION, KILLING THE
[1:33:54] LION, KILLING THE LION.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; This one was passing and saw the lion in
[1:33:58] a hold. He said, "This is my
[1:34:00] opportunity."
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; This is my opportunity. THE SAME GOD,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; WOW,
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; THAT DELIVERED DAVID WILL DELIVER ME.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; He jumped in the horde
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; and he came home that night with his
[1:34:14] testimony.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Says, "If you don't believe me, come,
[1:34:17] come. Let me go and show you. Come down.
[1:34:19] You see that line?" I killed it.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; That's what happened.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; The word wrote against us.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; It create in you the desire for the
[1:34:29] impossibility
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; THAT TO YOU ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; because God said it.
[1:34:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; It creates endure. You want to see Jesus
[1:34:50] on the scene.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; You want to be able to experience a
[1:34:53] firsthand miracle.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; You want TO BE PART PART OF IT THAT YET
[1:35:00] IT HAPPENED. WE PRAYED and it happens.
[1:35:08] As much as it's good to talk about
[1:35:10] others testimony, you want to talk about
[1:35:12] yours.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:27] He jump in the pit on the snow and there
[1:35:29] single-handed
[1:35:32] and an Egyptian run after him with a
[1:35:34] long spear and he took the stick and
[1:35:37] knocked the spear off his hand, took the
[1:35:39] spear and killed the Egyptian himself.
[1:35:43] And killed 300 captains.
[1:35:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:50] These guys were under the same anointing
[1:35:53] because they have identified with David.
[1:35:55] They have identified with his word.
[1:35:59] That's the message of the hour.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour.
[1:36:06] It's not just only David said he killed
[1:36:08] lion and David said he killed bear,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; but they have identified with it so much
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; that they experiencing the same thing in
[1:36:17] their life. Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; But do you see the paradox?
[1:36:22] With all the supernatural they are
[1:36:23] experiencing, it still did not take
[1:36:25] their life trouble away.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to see.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; With all the supernatural, it did not
[1:36:33] take their life trouble away.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. With all the
[1:36:39] supernatural, he were not there. Yes.
[1:36:42] I'm I'm standing with David to become
[1:36:43] king and and you know supernaturally
[1:36:45] money will get in my bank account and
[1:36:47] and no they still they still have to
[1:36:50] deal with what they are dealing with.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; SO WHATEVER WE ARE DEALING WITH DEAL
[1:36:54] WITH it
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; but let the word of God
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; has the preeminence.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; LET'S THE LOVE FOR GOD'S WORD LET THAT
[1:37:03] LET LET NOTHING YOU ARE DEALING WITH IN
[1:37:06] THIS LIFE
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; DIMINISH THE LOVE OF GOD. TAKE YOUR
[1:37:10] DEVOTION AND YOUR SERVICE AWAY FROM God
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; because you have this problem. YOU HAVE
[1:37:14] THAT PROBLEM. EVERYBODY has problem.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; He said the birds have nets. The foxes
[1:37:23] have ho.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; The son of man never even had a place to
[1:37:27] lay his head.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Never even had a place to lay his head.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; I guess he woke up from a good bed this
[1:37:35] morning.
[1:37:37] took a warm shower to be here.
[1:37:41] Everybody has problem. Everybody is
[1:37:45] going through one thing or another.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Don't blow it into people face. Nobody
[1:37:51] cares. Nobody cares.
[1:37:55] The song says, "Nobody will care for you
[1:37:57] like Jesus."
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; As long as Jesus cares, that's what
[1:38:04] matters. And that's what must matter to
[1:38:06] you to know that he cares.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; All of these things these people did for
[1:38:29] David,
[1:38:32] I'm going to stop here. Let me just take
[1:38:34] the one that I wanted to take. And then
[1:38:37] now
[1:38:39] I will close.
[1:38:44] Amen.
[1:38:47] Let's look in chapter 23. We were in
[1:38:50] chapter 22. Let's look in chapter 23.
[1:39:04] Chapter 23. What what you will see here
[1:39:07] is there what caught my attention as I
[1:39:09] was reading was there David
[1:39:12] is praying to the Lord.
[1:39:15] David is praying to the Lord. Let's look
[1:39:17] at chapter 23:12.
[1:39:19] He's consulting the Lord.
[1:39:21] [clears throat]
[1:39:27] David uh uh 23. Let's look at verse 10.
[1:39:30] Then David, Then said David, oh Lord,
[1:39:32] God of Israel, that servant has set in
[1:39:34] the heard that Saul seeketh to come to
[1:39:37] kill her to destroy the city for my
[1:39:40] sake.
[1:39:42] Will the man of Kla deliver me up into
[1:39:46] his hand? Will Saul come down as that
[1:39:48] servant has heard? Oh Lord God of
[1:39:50] Israel, I beseech thee, tell that seven,
[1:39:54] the Lord. And the Lord said he will come
[1:39:57] down. Now we talk about David devotion.
[1:40:01] I'm also wanting to show David prayer
[1:40:03] life. So he were not just running.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; There was some sense of devotion.
[1:40:12] In all of his life of fugitive, he did
[1:40:15] not abandon his prayer life.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; He heard something was going on. They
[1:40:19] cried to God and say, "Lord,
[1:40:22] if we stay here, will this will this man
[1:40:24] deliver us in the hands of Saul? We
[1:40:26] heard that he's coming."
[1:40:29] Are we together? Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:40:34] Now, uh uh
[1:40:46] verse 13. Then uh David and his and uh
[1:40:52] his men which were about 600 arose and
[1:40:56] depart out of Klad and whensoever
[1:41:00] they could go and it was told Saul that
[1:41:04] David was escaped
[1:41:07] from Klad and he forbid to go forth
[1:41:10] because he was going to come so he did
[1:41:12] not forsake his prayer life. Let's look
[1:41:14] in chapter 24.
[1:41:16] I will take this one. That's the main
[1:41:18] one I wanted to get to right here. And
[1:41:20] then we'll stop there and maybe we will
[1:41:23] continue. Chapter 24. Chapter
[1:41:26] [clears throat] 24 will bring us to the
[1:41:28] place where David cut the garment of
[1:41:31] Saul.
[1:41:33] But what I want I want us to see here is
[1:41:35] that uh David you will see in the
[1:41:39] reading where David men put pressure on
[1:41:42] him to do that.
[1:41:46] Okay. The people around him sometimes it
[1:41:50] looks like the running is is is too
[1:41:53] much. If we can kill Saul, you take over
[1:41:57] and everything ends.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:04] Let's look at the reading a little bit.
[1:42:09] Chapter 24
[1:42:13] we take uh yeah from verse three and and
[1:42:16] he came to the ship by the way
[1:42:23] verse two let me take verse two then
[1:42:25] Saul took three 300 chosen men out of
[1:42:28] out of uh
[1:42:31] all Israel and went to seek David
[1:42:35] and uh
[1:42:38] 300,000 men and David only have 600. He
[1:42:41] took 300,000
[1:42:44] men and David only have 600. That
[1:42:47] crossed my mind just now. So that's what
[1:42:49] I stopped.
[1:42:51] He took 300,000 chosen men out of Israel
[1:42:54] and went to seek David and and his men
[1:42:56] upon the rock
[1:42:59] of white goats and and he came to the
[1:43:02] ship coat by the way where where was a
[1:43:05] cave and saw when
[1:43:08] uh he went in to cover his feet and
[1:43:11] David and his men remain by the side of
[1:43:14] the cave and the men of David now that's
[1:43:17] that's where that's where it is now the
[1:43:20] men of David said unto him, "Behold the
[1:43:22] day, the day of which the Lord has said
[1:43:26] unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thy
[1:43:29] enemy in thy hands, that thou may do to
[1:43:33] him as thou seem good unto thee." Then
[1:43:36] David arose and cut off the skirt of
[1:43:40] Saul rough private. How did he break
[1:43:45] into the ranks of 300,000 men? I don't
[1:43:47] know. But uh that that that's that's
[1:43:49] that's where I want us to to see that
[1:43:52] the people are getting tired. They are
[1:43:54] getting tired of running around. THEY
[1:43:56] MIGHT GET BACK TO THEIR FAMILY. LIFE
[1:43:58] MUST GO ON.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; WILL WE ALWAYS JUST BE IN THIS HUSTLING,
[1:44:03] struggling condition?
[1:44:07] WILL THE CHURCH ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS? WHY
[1:44:10] can't we do this?
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:17] Why can't we do it? Why can't we do
[1:44:19] this? Let's come up with an IDEA HOW WE
[1:44:22] CAN solve this problem.
[1:44:28] Maybe one one one service a month will
[1:44:30] be better.
[1:44:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:36] Or people can take it a while. They have
[1:44:38] to take it on just Sunday. Maybe Sunday
[1:44:40] service will be better, you know. So I'm
[1:44:42] I'm just saying that uh they put such a
[1:44:45] pressure on David. But I want you to see
[1:44:48] what is going to happen after.
[1:44:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS DAVID WENT in there and
[1:44:56] he cut the skirt of of Saul. Cut off his
[1:45:00] garment and he said unto his men, "The
[1:45:03] Lord forbid that I should do this thing
[1:45:06] unto my master, the Lord's anointed."
[1:45:10] David after responding to the pressure
[1:45:14] of the people he felt a conviction in
[1:45:16] his heart.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; If the Lord will deliver my enemy in my
[1:45:21] hands and this is not the way that is
[1:45:23] going to happen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; If the Lord is going to bring us out of
[1:45:28] this situation is is this is not the way
[1:45:31] that is going to happen. We don't have
[1:45:33] to force things to happen.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Let's follow the Lord. Let's let's love
[1:45:39] him. Let's fall in love with him.
[1:45:47] He said the Lord forbade me to do this
[1:45:50] because this man is still the Lord's
[1:45:52] anointed.
[1:45:54] Praise the Lord. And David heart is
[1:45:58] condemning him.
[1:46:02] I should do this thing unto my masters.
[1:46:04] the Lord's anointed to stretch forth my
[1:46:05] hands, my hand against him. Seeing he is
[1:46:10] the anointed of the Lord. So David still
[1:46:12] his servant with these words and suffer
[1:46:16] them not to rise against Saul.
[1:46:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Now they influence him to DO THAT.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; HE REALIZED THAT HE'S ON A CONVICTION
[1:46:26] THAT is wrong. And then he come back to
[1:46:29] the guys and tell them gentlemen what we
[1:46:32] did is wrong.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; That that is leadership.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; When we can assume responsibility
[1:46:41] not looking for people to blame
[1:46:44] but when we realize that we are wrong we
[1:46:46] can sit down and says I'm wrong. I was
[1:46:49] wrong when I did this.
[1:46:52] I thought it was going to help but it
[1:46:54] didn't help. I was wrong.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; He's not blaming THE GUY. WELL, YOU
[1:47:01] PEOPLE TOLD ME TO DO IT. Y I mean, you
[1:47:04] don't know that the word of God said we
[1:47:05] No, he's not casting blame aside.
[1:47:09] But he was able to steal the man
[1:47:13] that nobody woke up because the guys
[1:47:16] were ready to bring Saul to an end.
[1:47:20] David take over the throne. They go back
[1:47:22] to their family.
[1:47:24] They received their reward and they live
[1:47:27] ever happy.
[1:47:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; But David stayed there. They said what
[1:47:33] we did was wrong.
[1:47:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; I would tell you
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; when we assume responsibility,
[1:47:44] when you can bring your heart to the
[1:47:46] place to realize and tell yourself
[1:47:48] blotted, I'm wrong. You were wrong to do
[1:47:51] this. That is a very strong
[1:47:54] sense of repentance.
[1:47:58] And maybe trying to go and and and and
[1:48:00] spend three days of fasting and praying
[1:48:02] is good if you want to push yourself
[1:48:04] before the Lord is a good thing to do.
[1:48:08] Praise the Lord. BUT NO MATTER HOW YOU
[1:48:10] CAN PHRASE your words, see brother
[1:48:13] Brandon when he told his wife, tell them
[1:48:15] I'm not here, he jumped out of the door.
[1:48:19] Amen. when he came to the place and
[1:48:21] realized that he was wrong. He never
[1:48:24] frame it. Nothing different.
[1:48:26] He didn't look for excuses to back it up
[1:48:29] and dress it right. He said I was wrong.
[1:48:34] I WAS SO MUCH WRONG that when the phone
[1:48:36] rang the the next time my little son
[1:48:39] Joseph said, "Daddy, should I tell them
[1:48:41] that you are not here?" He said, "You
[1:48:42] see how influence wrong influence spread
[1:48:49] and brother Brandon never said it on
[1:48:50] tape. We would not know about it.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; But he was not ashamed
[1:48:57] to be able to tell us when he was wrong
[1:48:59] that he was wrong."
[1:49:02] Why? Because he was a him. It's not God.
[1:49:07] Praise the Lord. And he's still the man.
[1:49:10] Character.
[1:49:12] Character. Now those mighty men saw
[1:49:15] character in David. They saw character
[1:49:18] in him.
[1:49:21] Now always wanting to be right that we
[1:49:25] got to turn the picture around. You try
[1:49:27] to turn it around and try to fix it.
[1:49:31] It's still not right. But
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; the B keep getting bigger.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:49] Say God forbid us to do that.
[1:49:53] And the Bible say he still the man that
[1:49:56] they would not rise up from their place.
[1:50:00] And the next morning, David got on the
[1:50:02] rock. He called out to Saul and he even
[1:50:06] apologized.
[1:50:07] He repented.
[1:50:12] Saul said, "My son David,
[1:50:17] I love you.
[1:50:19] I know you will not do no evil to me.
[1:50:22] Come home, David."
[1:50:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:27] He had drunk his own rage. He's drunk on
[1:50:30] his own rage. Jealousy has eaten him up.
[1:50:36] But that was the character. We'll
[1:50:38] continue. Just wanted to bring few of
[1:50:41] this to you. That was the character of
[1:50:43] the mighty men of David.
[1:50:46] They were just not mighty just because
[1:50:50] of their great achievement. They were
[1:50:52] mighty because in THE MIDST OF ALL THAT
[1:50:55] they were doing
[1:50:58] they still choose to stay with the word
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; with everything that was happening
[1:51:02] around their life.
[1:51:06] Their commitment to the word.
[1:51:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:12] Their commitment to the word,
[1:51:15] their devotion to the word was
[1:51:17] important.
[1:51:27] Are we together?
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; You see, were you able to grab the
[1:51:32] picture?
[1:51:35] They were all men like men of like
[1:51:37] passion like we are. Praise the Lord.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Sisters, you can come back to the music.
[1:51:44] They were men all men of like passions.
[1:51:48] They had their struggle. They had the
[1:51:50] different things they were dealing with
[1:51:52] in life. They had their life projects.
[1:51:57] They thought that by the certain time
[1:51:59] they will have been promoted to major or
[1:52:01] to captain. Y say they find themselves
[1:52:03] running with David from one hole to
[1:52:05] another hole.
[1:52:08] They were in distress.
[1:52:12] They had debts.
[1:52:20] Some of them their position affected
[1:52:22] their family
[1:52:27] and different things was going on. We
[1:52:29] all were deal with different things in
[1:52:32] our life. The idea that the the the
[1:52:36] church world tried to sell to us. That's
[1:52:39] the reason why I say bunch bunch around
[1:52:41] the message. We stay under the man's
[1:52:43] anointing because we are still looking
[1:52:45] for good method to serve God.
[1:52:49] We are still trying to create good
[1:52:51] method. Easy way,
[1:52:55] easy way that will make the that make
[1:52:57] the message appealing. I'm telling you
[1:53:00] what will make the word appealing is a
[1:53:02] consecrated life.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; It's a consecrated life.
[1:53:07] That life will rub against someone
[1:53:11] and you will become the line that will
[1:53:13] be drawing and they will not even know
[1:53:15] how they got there
[1:53:17] because you just love the Lord. And
[1:53:20] because you love the Lord, you love
[1:53:22] people.
[1:53:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; You love people. You love to talk to
[1:53:28] people. You love to greet people.
[1:53:31] Your love for God don't makes people
[1:53:34] strangers to you.
[1:53:37] Most especially the ones that don't that
[1:53:39] don't believe that don't see the hope
[1:53:41] that you have in your heart.
[1:53:45] If our Lord Jesus went down to hell and
[1:53:49] hell would not corrupt you.
[1:53:52] Praise the Lord. The love of God in your
[1:53:55] heart,
[1:53:57] there is no element of evil that can
[1:54:00] corrupt you.
[1:54:08] What I want us to do this afternoon
[1:54:11] put in context
[1:54:14] with everything that you are dealing
[1:54:16] with your own life. Let's forget about
[1:54:17] David. Let's forget about his man. With
[1:54:20] everything you are dealing with,
[1:54:22] everything that you are going through,
[1:54:29] what is influencing your love for God?
[1:54:33] What is your motivation?
[1:54:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; What is your motivation?
[1:54:43] Are you just stay holding to the message
[1:54:45] because you don't want uh you know uh to
[1:54:48] make your parents to feel bad?
[1:54:52] Are you just holding on because uh uh uh
[1:54:55] I mean uh are you are you are you really
[1:54:57] at a breaking point that it looks like
[1:55:00] everything has failed you in this life
[1:55:10] or you don't even know or are you at a
[1:55:13] place that you can say I don't even know
[1:55:17] what is holding me
[1:55:20] I can't even understand how do I come
[1:55:22] back.
[1:55:24] Sometimes I feel like giving up, but I
[1:55:27] don't understand. There is just
[1:55:28] something in my heart.
[1:55:34] Something keeps holding me. If we can
[1:55:36] play there.
[1:56:11] Something keeps holding me. [singing]
[1:56:18] Every day I [singing] see
[1:56:23] helping me faithfully
[1:56:27] to overcome [music]
[1:56:29] my trials.
[1:56:33] [music]
[1:56:34] He's guiding me [singing] constantly,
[1:56:40] giving me victory. [singing]
[1:56:46] is a [music and singing] reality.
[1:56:50] Something keeps holding
[1:56:52] me. [music] Let's sing that now.
[1:56:57] Something keeps holding [singing]
[1:56:59] me.
[1:57:02] Every day I see
[1:57:08] helping me faithfully
[1:57:11] to [music] overcome
[1:57:14] my [singing]
[1:57:14] trials.
[1:57:18] He's got [music and singing] it
[1:57:20] constantly
[1:57:24] giving me [music] victory [singing]
[1:57:26] to me
[1:57:30] is a [music] reality
[1:57:33] and something keeps holding
[1:57:36] me.
[1:57:40] Yes. Something keeps holding
[1:57:42] [music and singing]
[1:57:43] me.
[1:57:46] Every day I [music and singing] see
[1:57:51] helping me faithfully [music]
[1:57:55] to overcome
[1:57:57] my trials.
[1:58:01] He's guiding [music and singing] me
[1:58:03] constantly,
[1:58:07] giving me [music]
[1:58:09] to
[1:58:13] [music] my reality
[1:58:16] and something keeps [singing] holding
[1:58:19] me. Do you feel like that? That there is
[1:58:22] something that is holding you.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Do you feel a talk on the other side
[1:58:28] that something keeps drawing you closer?
[1:58:31] In all of your life struggle, in all of
[1:58:34] what looks like failures and defeat and
[1:58:37] the things that you are going through,
[1:58:39] you feel that in your heart that there
[1:58:42] is something that keeps holding me.
[1:58:45] There is something that keeps drawing me
[1:58:47] closer. It's not like something you
[1:58:50] trying to control and you know you make
[1:58:53] your choice when you want to and when
[1:58:56] you don't want to. You know it's
[1:58:58] something that's keep drawing you
[1:59:01] closer.
[1:59:03] Something that is keep pulling you.
[1:59:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Do you feel like that? Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; I mean that's that just that just what
[1:59:14] service is all about.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; That's what service is all about.
[1:59:20] It's at the place where we come to the
[1:59:21] place and uh you know we can be able to
[1:59:24] uh recommmit ourself to the Lord and
[1:59:26] look at our our commitment and look at
[1:59:29] our devotion and look at what what what
[1:59:32] are we taking what what are we taking
[1:59:34] above our love for his word?
[1:59:38] Are we convinced that there's a
[1:59:40] millennial coming? Are we convinced that
[1:59:43] there is a rapture?
[1:59:46] Are we convinced of the promises that he
[1:59:48] has given us? Are we so convinced of it?
[1:59:55] Are we convinced of this coming king
[2:00:05] that has come down in our hearts?
[2:00:20] Sometimes we get these [music] things
[2:00:21] all fixed in our mind. We put our life
[2:00:24] on this on this uh you know and and
[2:00:29] sometimes we want to put our service on
[2:00:31] for God on hold until I can get this
[2:00:34] thing done until this thing can be done
[2:00:36] then I will get [music] you know really
[2:00:38] get into the things of God and and uh
[2:00:41] but I mean it's it's our life.
[2:00:46] is our life.
[2:00:50] These were men of light passion.
[2:00:55] They were going through all of these
[2:00:56] things. They makes mistakes. [music]
[2:01:00] They make wrong choices. But yet they
[2:01:02] come back to the place and realize.
[2:01:12] Let's just speak to the Lord together
[2:01:14] while the music [music] plays softly.
[2:01:22] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we want to
[2:01:24] thank you
[2:01:26] this uh afternoon Lord God, you have
[2:01:29] given us this time. Father, I just took

[2:01:42] that were called the mighty men of
[2:01:44] David. Precious Lord, the kind of life
[2:01:47] Lord God that they live and the things
[2:01:49] that were happening around them, Lord,
[2:01:51] they were not just mighty to God because
[2:01:54] they were healing the sake of God and
[2:01:56] they were living from one miracles to
[2:01:58] another miracle. Lord, they were they
[2:02:00] were mighty because they purpose in
[2:02:02] their heart to God. Come what may

[2:02:45] one of us, Lord, [music] Father, to take
[2:02:47] an inventory of our life and think about
[2:02:50] what is the thing that is so important.
[2:02:52] What what is the thing that is so
[2:02:54] important? [music]

[2:02:57] life?

[2:03:01] the thing that we really want to achieve
[2:03:04] in this life?
