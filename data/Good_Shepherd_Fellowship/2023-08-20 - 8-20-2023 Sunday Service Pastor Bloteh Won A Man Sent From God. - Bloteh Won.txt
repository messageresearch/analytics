the Lord so uh I try to be one this morning amen amen the good thing about it there is that I never told you when I will finish I just said I will try to finish soon amen praise the Lord so that's a little quoti for myself but this morning I want to speak on uh the thought of a man sent from God I want to speak on the thought a man sent from God praise the Lord I want to speak on the top a man sent from God I was I was I was meditating this morning I woke up around 4:00 and uh just keeping my heart before the Lord and and saying Lord uh uh I cannot be any help to your people until you you uh you speak to me and I was thinking because we've been we've been going in uh in uh taking a trip year with what is man that God is mindful of him amen and the son of man that God visited him and we were looking at a different kind of visitation our Salvation is a visitation it's a DAT of the Lord God visit us amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a visitation you know uh uh uh it's it's it's some of those uh kind of a visitation where the father feels comfortable and he comes and stay praise the Lord healing is a visitation and different things we were looking at uh uh and then so we we keep looking at this this subject with with man and and what is man that God is mindful of him so this morning we want to look at a thought a man sent from God praise the Lord a man sent from God but before I get into my subject I will I will I would like us to read Genesis 4 verse 1 Genesis 4 verse1 there is a similar statement that is made by Eve when King was born and we want to look at that closely we want to look at that a little bit critical this morning through the eye of a prophet praise the Lord Genesis 4:1 the Bible says and and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear King and said I have gotten a man from the Lord am amen e is confessing I have gotten a man from the Lord praise the Lord and uh uh and we see that John on the inspiration of the Holy Ghost he's talking about a man sent from God praise the Lord amen but I want us to study uh Eve confession a little bit before we get into our subject if we don't get there then it give me another opportunity to continue but we let's look at Eve confession a little bit and uh uh uh she got a son and she said I have gotten a man from the Lord praise the Lord which of course that is an Earnest confession that is uh uh a truth confession because every life comes from God are we together am amen every life comes from God so Eve was truth about her confession she have gotten a man from the Lord hallelujah but let's look at it a little bit critical let's let's let's uh uh because looking at a critical will help us to be able to understand what John meant when he says what uh uh uh uh uh when he says uh a man sent from God praise the Lord John the apostles were talking about John the Baptist he was referring to John the Baptist as a man sent from God so we want to look at uh Eve confession closely let's let's uh let's take one of our our our reading Year from the semar church age praise the Lord are we together amen it starts with this comment when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything praise the Lord Wednesday night we were talking about uh uh uh a little talk about uh uh staying you know uh uh with the word amen coming subject bringing ourself subject to the word because we realize that was the difference between Christ as a son and we as a son he came directly uh and and we bypass our tiop so until we can get to the full body of the word we have to fight we have to struggle every day to bring ourself in subjection to the word that's what the Christian life is all about praise the Lord that's what the Christian life is all about is you bringing that's your part of redemption Jesus have paid the price amen he had paid the price on the cross of Calvary he spilled his blood and and as as a price for our sin our our part of redemption now is to submit ourself to God whereby we can be able to bring our body bring our thoughts bring our desire bring our tongue bring every fiber of our body subject to the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord H Allelujah amen that's our Christian responsibility amen now so we were talking about that and so this morning we are still going in that same light of bringing ourselves subject to the word so we want to talk about staying with the word staying with the word so brother Bram used that and address address uh uh what we are going into and says when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything when a man gets away from the word he will believe anything when a woman gets away from the word she will believe anything when a family gets away from the word they will believe anything when a nation get away from the word they will believe anything hallelujah amen when the church gets away from the word it will believe anything see how he goes to explain this he says it is like Eve when King was born she said I have gotten a man from the Lord now do you realize that she really meant that she really meant that King was a man from the Lord praise the Lord he goes he says uh she thought that she had a man from the Lord you see once she had been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the word of God she then taught that whatever she said was right amen now you have to go back to she and Satan conversation he said to her that you will be like God Amen you will be like God you will know right and wrong are we together amen so you can look at the the the the the conversation in in the do away he was a man from God because God is the one that gave life amen amen he's the one that gave life so he was a man from God but when you actually look at the statement from her you will see that she's speaking out of deception she has St her deception to be truth are we together are you seeing what I'm going with this amen if you have not yet just stay with me you will get it praise praise the Lord let's go on a little bit she thought that she had a man from the Lord you see once she had once she had been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the word of God she then taught that whatever she said was right you know it's it's it's the place of speaking lies until the lies become truth a person believing lies until they faction it in their mind that it is truth praise the Lord and they can lay their head on chopping B for the lie when it is a lie are we together you see once she has she has been deceived by taking the word of Satan instead of the word of God then she thought that what whatever she said was right if she said that she had a man from God then she had a man from God but God has set laws in the universe every seed will bring forth of It kind that's Genesis 1:11 God said that Lord in the universe before he even manifested Adam and Eve it was a law that was in the universe that whatever you saw you will reap that's right are we together now so no matter what you believe it does not change God's law God's law was in the universe before you were born before we came to the Earth he set a law that every seed will bring for of his kind so no matter what she's believing year it will not change the Lord of God now we will realize that that's the reason why every man will be a liar and God's word will be truth are we together God has set laws in his Universe a good sea can only bring forth good fruit and the evil seed can bring forth only evil fruit praise the Lord amen amen uh you know it's it's simple I I I don't want to go into uh you know teaching on the sepen SE this morning but it should be very easy for us to understand God made Man In His Image he made Adam and Eve in His image they came directly from God like we said on the on the uh Wednesday night Adam was now born of a woman so he don't have a neighbor because that is our Connecting Point with our mother praise the Lord his toes were stuck in the earth God made him upright and when God breath in his nostril like I like to demonstrate he just shook his toes of the earth and on his way he started to go praise the Lord amen now so uh uh uh he came right from the hands of God he came right as a product from God and uh uh uh uh we know Genesis 3 uh sin has been introduced and uh and then the only way that man can ever manifest anything different from what God made is that his blood has to be contaminated so whatever took place in Genesis chapter 3 had to do with blood amen it had to do with blood there is no way we we could manifest attributes of our parents until their bloodstream has run down to Us Praise the Lord so let's leave that part of the blood let's deal with what is before us yet amen now so uh I I just have to put that there in because I I I I will find my way to run back to it a good seed can only bring FR of good fruit evil seed will bring forth only evil fruit now each seed though different will uzee the same Earth the nourishment the muster the sunshine but it will bring forth after its own kind amen amen notice the history of King line notice is the history of set line only one difference between them the original SE nothing El are we together back to Eve's statement if you look at this statement of Eve re real close you will notice that she had more of an understanding than uh most realized she did not attribute it the son to sedan for that will have make him equal with God only God could create the egg the egg in the womb of Mery Satan couldn't do that Eve knew that Satan Cann Satan can own it sorry pervert so he begil her with a wrong seed it was the serent seed that brought for King it it was Adam's seed that brought through abev and SE those seeds went through exactly the same process but the children were different for they were from different seeds praise the Lord amen she believed that King was from God she accepted the devil lied as a truth of God that is exactly what she that is exactly what we have now churches set themselves up as a fountain of truth but the truth is not in them yet their begotten children swear by them and will even kill to uphold their errors praise the Lord amen if we realize that every one of us here in this in this uh in this building this morning that this B that you are sitting in was breeded by by the devil praise the Lord amen if we realize there this morning and if God can just help us to to uh to to come to the place of of understanding that uh as long as we we we stayed in this life we will get headache we will get sickness we will get trouble we will feel discouraged we will get S and uh we will go through different faces of life because this body is not perfect amen this body is a product of the original sin amen are we together praise the Lord that's the reason why God will have to send a man from the presence of the Lord amen a man will have to come from from the presence of God for you and uh and for you and for me praise the Lord amen so let's let's just let's just travel a little bit but you see what we have to realize here is that no matter what uh family you were born in whether you were born in holy well or whether you were born and you never knew your father or you never knew your mother and no matter what the state of your life is we we will have to realize that uh uh uh even if you were born in the church and uh and and you know uh like like uh we like to say to you know we were born in the message and all of that and uh uh you don't want to you don't want to take that to your head you don't want to take that as an absolute you don't want to take your natural birth as an absolute you don't want to take the St of your natural birth you know whether which country you were born in which hospital you were born in which city you were born you never want to take that as an absolute because no matter where you were born we have to know that every B every bir birth is a mess it all goes back to Genesis chapter 3 it all goes back to the fall in the beginning are we together Amen Let me take something here from power of transformation and then I will go back to what we were reading I can brag on my birth now I can't break on my first birth there is nothing I'm ashamed of that but I'm not ashamed of my second birth no no I'm not ashamed of my second birth amen how did he do it by the watching of the word by the word amen True True predestinated Believers stay with the word and and they won't pervert it it can be perverted amen praise the Lord amen so we know our second birth comes by the word Incorruptible praise the Lord the sea Incorruptible which is the word of God so let's go back to there the reason why I I I want to dwell on this a little bit is because we have you have to realize there is deception that is lying in the cells of this body praise the Lord it was born on lies it was born out of deception amen amen you can have a good meal after church today and and you just feel so F before the night up you open in the refrigerator to find something to drink amen you can feel fine toight and uh feel like uh you are flying with wains over the word and tomorrow you on a blanket shaking like uh you are plug to an electric Port are we together so you have to realize that uh something happened Adam and Eve fell from a holy Veil they fell from a state and when she fell from that place into the state that she found herself now she she she she turned to find some way of comfort because all that they ever knew was going down in Eden and fellowshipping with God God coming down and communion with them and and I mean that I mean even before Adam would say some things to her she will pick up his thought and say well there I know you want this to be done I will get it done I mean she was co-equal with Adam are we together they were all in that image of God that God created him that image which is the word they were under the protection of the word but when she fell from there she fell from there she still tried to believe that everything that she's doing now it was stay as them praise the Lord that's why sometimes people struggle with with accepting their age struggle with the changes in their body struggle with different thing because you get in one state you get used to that state when changes are coming you you you want to always be like this so in her mind she could now fully perceive the effect of the Fall she could she could not fully perceive that things is no longer the same praise the Lord that's what brother Brandon started this wave when the church when a man or the woman get away from the word they will believe anything and live comfortably in it people that have grown under the sacr of Truth they have lived and experienced the supernatural of God when when they get away from the word they can believe anything and live comfortably in it that's right amen may God give us Grace to stay with the word and whatever it takes for my will to break that's what I will be willing to do because because we have to realize there's a spirit promise of this age the spirit of strong delusion that the people will believe a lie for the truth it's a spirit of this age why because we're going right back to Eden we are just on the junction The Same Spirit that was right there in Eden a strong delusion that this woman will believe that she has received a child from the Lord praise the Lord amen are we together am and he says that's that's exactly what we have now churches set themselves up as a fountain of truth but the truth is not in them yet they are begotten children swear by them praise the Lord amen we we we we read to you before show you right in the word is the word that comes predestinated I will show you there also as as we will look uh uh uh in the word and uh you see so we we see all of those things even in in the age where we have many of our you know uh uh believing parents trusting God for their children calling to God for their children and uh believing claiming you know applying the token for their children you have to believe it amen you have to believe it brother bam says am I go before you or am I come after you amen but you have to believe that God is going to hear your prayer amen you have to believe that Lord I I I I plac that child I I dedicated him uh uh to you on the eighth day I circumcised him just like jacobe did and and and and I give him to dedication and and and and Lord father you know he's he's he's on the N River I believe that in the midst of all the the the arig gillers you will keep him safe you will keep her safe we have to believe that but another thing I want to bring to you is that uh uh uh we we we didn't give birth to direct uh uh uh uh sons and daughters of God they have to be born again our children don't come from our war as as as Christians as believers they were born in sin shaped in iniquity praise the Lord they came to the Earth speaking lies and God has to meet them they have to have an experience with God they have to be born again praise the Lord they cannot just go on the testimony of Mommy and Daddy they have to have their own experience with God praise the Lord even though when they are born you know they look so cute they look just like a like like an angel so precious wish they could just stay that way all the days of their life then there will be no much trouble just feed them change their diapers that's all praise the Lord amen but when they start growing and uh uh then they have to go to the mountain just like Jesus went to the mountain and he was tempted of the devil amen they have they have to go to their higher Peck and their lowest point are we together so my my emphasis here is there just to see how when the person leave the word and hold on to something that is not the word how soon if God don't help that man or that woman they can start believing there to be truth and brother Bram says they are even ready to die for it or kill you for it praise the Lord with all the manifestation all the Miracles that the Pharisees saw in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ it says now for the Miracles and the good work that he's done we are crucifying but he being man call himself God they were they were ready to kill for it so that is something that we we we have to what amen we see those things happening around our ranks people that have preached this message over 40 years and and and and and and and you know just just young men and God blessed them with with with good wives and God blessed them their children came up right and and all of that they are walking away from the truth and and and and and they are beli in something praise the Lord amen that now the believe to be a truth and the thing that has made the cord of their life they are fighting against it that's how dangerous this is that's how serious it is praise the Lord amen how a person can believe a lie do you see how important for us to bring every thought of our mind back to the word every feeling of our body back to the word praise the Lord amen because if you don't bring your feeling back to the word the devil can make you to believe that you are not healed he will he will make you believe that was just a sensation you are not healed see how you are feeling if you were healed why are you feeling that way right praise the Lord if you don't bring your TS back to the word he can guess right there in your mind just like he did to our lord Jesus if you be the Son of God turn these stones into bread how important for us to bring every desire of our body back to the word is this thing pleasing to God praise the Lord because pray to on he can make that feeling a habit amen and he can he can he can justify it bring a lot of thoughts around your mind and and tell you why it's good for you to for you to be that way praise the Lord are we together for if you think [Music] that let me just let me just Dru to the other ones realize I could stay on this and spend a lot of time here when the church allow herself to move away from the original like Adam and Eve death set in there is no strength in her she she has become uh monos headed the meaning that the church moved to moved towards form and ceremony and towards pries who by organizing the ministers into a group that desire leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and his word that very moment death enter and she and and and she's and she started to get sick it was just one word thou shall not not die when Eve stopped and reason with that one statement death set in Praise the Lord and she never knew she was died she never knew that she was getting away from God that she would get to the place to called a seent seed a man sent from God she never knew that she would go to that far are we together death set in the moment the church gets away from the word and starts to introduce things to make the people happy introduce things to to be like other churches that's why we should stay with the word to the best of our knowledge and the best of our ability are we together let me get down here you temper with God and you you will reap exactly what you injected man ought to learn that from nature you temple with nature he has injected his own idea into nature and and rearranged the molecules Etc and now he's reaping the wh wi just look how they have breathed the chicken it is so highly breeded that it is the laying machine that that that that that lay it out it is no good for food and so soft and poor to eat they injected substance into the meat we eat and because of that the human body is changing so that uh that uh uh we me I getting narrow and all of that but what what actually he's trying to tell us is that just the danger in tempering with the law of God because those law were placed there that was the first Bible the law were placed in the universe before man came and when we can see all of these results of things that are happening around us and and and uh the you know uh the all of these hybrid things how much more about the word of God when men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God like brother brandham says he says that you go to a restaurant if they ever should bring you a soup and you see a fly in it man you will take your your your your phone and and and call the uh uh one agency and to that whole restaurant but yet people will not pay attention to what their soul is feeding on we can be so conscious about the things we put in our mouth but man will care they will care nothing about what their soul fees on they can get on the internet and just feed on bunch of garbage and say yeah praise the Lord that's true that's the way churches are yeah yeah yeah are we together that's the reason why we must hear what the spirit is saying to the church don't get carried away with the emotion of the preacher sit there and see where where where the Holy Ghost is going with that word and stand there and say Amen I think I see it are we together she believe it she believe it a way for her to escape with her guilt of what she did wrong is to believe a lie in that way she can get away with her guilt and go and live on I have received a man from the Lord praise the Lord is that now saying Amen to the devil gospel because he said you will be just like God you will know right and wrong so if she's censuring it which means she censuring it it was right it was good that I did this are we together no remorse no place of repentance praise the Lord amen that prophet of God told us uh you know what uh uh uh the the the the blessings of wealth and material thing is is is no sign of God's approv neither the denial of it if you don't have it is also not a sign what is the sign of God approv is his word is finding ourself in the word of God in the word of God a man sent from God so I will get back to to my to my subject now I just wanted to lay this out because Eve the mother of all living she said she received a man from the Lord when actually it was a SE seed that was not God creation amen it was the devil h h h breathing something are we together now watch this now back to St John chapter 1 let's go back there we will travel a little bit here hallelujah are we together amen John started to talk here and he brought this great introduction talking about in the beginning was the word he went right back to Genesis went back back to the beginning of creation the world was with God the world was God the same was in the beginning with God praise the Lord then verse six he introduced something and he says there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came forth to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe glory be to God Amen let's go back to Luke chap 1 and we can go and look at the birth of John the Baptist amen we can go back and look at the birth of John the Baptist you will see that when John was born that Zachariah his father being a righteous man he was he was uh uh uh uh uh doing his duty in in the in the Tabernacle or the temple you know blowing incense and getting the place ready for worship and prayer when the angel Gabriel met him praise the Lord the Bible say he was a just man but when the angel met him John I mean Zacharias have come to a place in his life where he think that God has blessed him he has had a a successful marriage he and Elizabeth have been together Faithfully they went over the grieving time of having children and the Lord didn't give them children and and and and he was I mean he was to the place where he was satisfied he was saying it is the word of the Lord he accepted that to be the word of the Lord that the angel of the Lord the angel the same angel that announced the coming of Christ appeared to John appeared to Zacharias and told him that he would have a son he tried to ask arue with the angel the angel said no argument you won't talk until the child is born praise the Lord hallelujah oh if God could do do that for us it would be so easy for many of us praise the Lord it will be so easy for many of us the way we argue with uh accepting God's provided way praise the Lord but what I want you to see is there even when the child was born and they were asking how would the child be named praise the Lord John knew I mean Zachariah knew an angel has witnessed his child to him praise the Lord amen amen he knew that this was an angel from the presence of the Lord that have just spoke to him because the angel said you would not speak and right there he could not cry out for anybody to hear him so he knew that he was under the hands of God but yet when the child was born in Zacharias the Bible says here verse 23 and it came to pass that as soon as the day of his ministration would accomplish let me let me drop down I know you you are very familiar with this amen so I don't want to take a lot of time on on uh uh keeping you year but let's go back a little bit let's go go back to verse 13 because there is something I want you to see but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayers have been heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shall call his name John and thou shall have joyed and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall turn to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Lies now Malachi 3 now the reason why I want you to see this is that a man sent from the presence of the Lord but see what Zacharias what the angel is doing here to Zacharias the angel is identifying John Birth by scripture amen the angel is identifying John Birth by scripture praise the Lord amen the angel said I read that again I mean uh uh many Will Rejoice he shall be great in the sight of the Lord the child will be a great child he will be born and right from the mother's womb he will receive the Holy Ghost but all of these things that the angel is saying about this child is not ascribed to the child natural ual birth but the angel is describing putting the child in the in in the pages of God's word so what is happening is God bringing his word to pass amen what what Malachi said in Malachi chapter 3 I will send my angel before my face here is that word coming to pass amen what Isaiah said in Isaiah chapter 4 a voice of one crying in the wilderness that word is coming to pass so the angel is describing John Birth by scripture praise the Lord Eve is not describing King's Birth by scripture she's describing King's Birth by what the seent told her praise the Lord so you see two men from the presence of the Lord two men from God but with different birth their birth is described differently we are now predestinated see because of our parents' birth or our parents bringing us for we are predestinated seed because the scripture said we are predestinated seed we have find a place in the world where we can identify ourself even though we were born by our father and mother but we can look back to God's word it's not our natural birth that makes us predestined a seed it's God's thoughts it's God's breath for you because you were in his mind amen he elected you praise the Lord he choose you from the foundation of the word and he was showed and setting that nothing will stop your birth that you will be here and you will hear the voice of God for this age amen Hallelujah you go through all your struggle and trial of life but there was a promise in this word I will have a people for my name's sake that promise was hanging over your life is that promise that brought you forth amen amen even if the doctor gave the wrong medication to your mama because that promise was hanging over you nothing could have happened to you Lord praise the Lord the mama didn't have good food for me to eat or to eat I will be a a a healthy child there was a promise hanging over my life I might have come up on a tough upbringing and never had shoes to word or close perfect close to word that did not matter because God was setting that nothing will stop you until this world will breath you for then now you can become a son and daughter from the presence of God not by your natural birth but by a message that have birath you oh I want I'm making sense if you can say I'm making sense we close this whole thing cuz I'm trying to make sense and I'm trying to understand myself praise the Lord Amen brother bam said Christ is the Myster of God revealed he said pre destinator he says there's the mystery he before Christ or anything else was ever on Earth you see his great mystery that he choose the bride noring Eve who fall from thisel in the word noring there she who fall but he who choose a bride that will never fall amen that will hold to th word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it praise the Lord in his mind he knew evil fall but in his mind he knew there would come a bride there will come a people that will hear the voice of the seven Angel and people that will receive a message amen praise the Lord that will reshape their life are we together it is that word that been hanging over you is that prophecy being haunting your life is being haunting your life that's the reason why we couldn't find peace we couldn't find rest and until you meet God you will never find peace you will never find the the the fullness of joy there is nothing that will bring full satisfaction to you praise the Lord amen are we together amen you can get the newest phone when the next one come out you want it praise the Lord you can get the latest vehicle when you see the other one going around on the road you want that one that's all the natural man he I mean he just on the right race and you know he's all about that but the thing that brings satisfaction to the believer the thing that brings satisfaction to a son and daughter of God is to know I'm a child of the king amen it's to know I'm a child of the king that's where I get my joy right Hallelujah when the things of Life the hle of life gets on the hle where it's tough I can live for my head and say my father have thousands of cattles amen praise the Lord I can find joy in his promises that's right amen are we together am I making sense the angel said this child is born under a promise he will be a Nazareth from the date of his birth nothing will go through his head not not our our ludicious Nazareth that we are having amen they are on a different kind of influence but he says uh uh uh praise the Lord are we together amen kind of lose lose my place okay right here he shall go before he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elias to turn the hearts of the father to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom and the unjust John Zacharias is standing there listening to this Angel quoting to him Malachi 3 three praise the Lord amen they have read malacha 3 in the temple the priest might have commented on it and this Angel is identifying the birth of his son Zachariah s with this scripture are we together praise the Lord you see the uh uh CH and and El Bram had nothing to do with brother brandham h h h Ministry amen that is their son the the birth him in the state of life and and the household of life and all of the things that they had to go through praise the Lord the reason why we hold to his message is because we find his identity in Scripture amen praise the lord we find his identity in scripture we see here that the angel only mention one part of Malachi he spoke on Malachi 3 but then he mention one part here of uh of uh of uh uh Malachi 4 turning the heart of uh the the fathers to the children and he left the other portion of Malachi 4 praise the Lord this is an angel from the presence of the Lord so you see John being a man when when when John the Revelator or John the Divine or John the Apostle said a man sent from the presence of the Lord and his name was John he was not talking about his his his uh his natural birth he was sent from the presence of the Lord because he came on a prophecy yes there was a word that spoke about him amen so when when when we said you can say the same about uh uh uh Paul the Apostle he was a man sent from the presence of the Lord because he was a light to the Gentiles Paul was able to identify his place in Scripture he saw there was a prophecy that this light the people that sat in darkness great light was going to shine upon them so Paul went under the commission of that great light and he was able to bring great light to the Gentiles praise the Lord oh that's the thing that makes the believer powerful if they can be able to find their own importance in God's word and stand behind it amen and say This Promise is mine every promise in the book is mine am praise the Lord hallelujah I I will tell you the devil knows if you believe it he knows he knows if you believe it he knows also if you are just a bluff praise the Lord he knows because I mean he's going to tempt you everywhere he's going to slap you everywhere and and ask you do you believe it he said well I don't know praise the Lord but a man or a woman that believe in the devil can turn them upside down lay them down on a sick bed they will still lay their hands up and say Lord I believe you are my healer I believe you are my deliverer though he slay me yet I will trust you amen man sent from God praise the Lord hallelujah and I believe that there are sons and daughters that are sent from God for this age amen amen God predestinated us for this age and we are sent to represent him in this age and that's the reason why we want to stand with the word yes we want to stay on the word are we together let me read one more thing to you and and and and close this thing for for today as position of the church ages the Ephesian Church age brother Bram says but fear not little FL stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that and she fell praise the Lord your amount of years serving the lord matters nothing to the devil praise the lord the devil is not afraid of the name of your church neither the name of your pastor the devil don't even afraid if you says I believe brother brandham is a prophet the devil also believe that if you don't know that amen amen he believed that William brandham was a prophet because William brandham command him and he went praise the Lord am so but it does not intimidate the devil yes what scared the devil is when you keep the word praise the Lord when you keep the word between you and him praise the Lord when we bring all our thoughts back to the word we bring our desires back to the word are we living to please ourself or are we living to please God are we striving to please God or we are just championing something of ourself oh and how the devil can make a one to believe that what they are doing they are in the word of God he did the same to Eve you say I got a man from the Lord she was so caught up in that deception that she stepped out of the Holy Ville when she never even knew that she was naked steep out of the Holy ve and now she's professing that what she knows now is better than what she knew then fear not let flood stay with the word keep the word between you and the devil Eve did not do that and she fell but when the church let down on the word she goes into a depth amen of the darkness of Satan praise the Lord amen he will give you every form of religious move he will be able to reason with you and convince you are we together let the musicians come and uh we B our hearts here I hope that uh the Lord was able to minister to your heart this afternoon amen how we can believe people can believe lies and they can be ready to die for it when even though they are not having the spiritual benefit and people can be caught up in different forms of deception why we think on these things sister Grace if you would
