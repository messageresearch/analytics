[3:29] not contrary to the word you say well I
[3:31] was revealed to me that if it's contrary
[3:33] to the word it never come from God Amen
[3:35] that's right now if you want to take Max
[3:38] Matthew 16 18 Jesus said himself that
[3:42] the entire church
[3:44] his church would be built upon spiritual
[3:48] revelation of himself which is the word
[3:53] I say unto you that thou art Peter
[3:56] and Flesh and Blood never reveal this to
[3:58] you but my Father which is in heaven has
[4:01] revealed this to you and Upon This Rock
[4:05] now I know our Catholic friends there
[4:08] you say it was built upon Peter and
[4:10] Peter the apostolic soil so and so on an
[4:12] Apostolic consent uh succession
[4:15] the Protestant said it was built upon
[4:17] Jesus Christ not to be different but
[4:19] take just what he said he said
[4:22] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[4:25] you but my Father which is in heaven has
[4:27] revealed this you and Upon This Rock
[4:32] spiritual revelation of what the word is
[4:37] I'll build my church in the Gates of
[4:40] Hell will never Shake It Down
[4:44] his wife will not be tempted with other
[4:46] man
[4:48] I'll build my church in the Gates of
[4:50] Hell to never shake it
[4:52] and Abel and Cain in the Garden of Eden
[4:55] Cain drawed his own conception he said
[4:58] now look God's a good god he's all over
[5:01] all nature so I'll get the beans and
[5:03] potatoes and I'll get the flowers and
[5:05] I'll make him real pretty altar that's a
[5:06] church he knelt down he believed God he
[5:09] worshiped God put up his hands and
[5:11] offered this sacrifice he done
[5:13] everything religious that Abel did Abel
[5:15] built the same kind of an altar but when
[5:17] Abel brought his he brought a lamb
[5:20] now Cain thought that making an antidote
[5:23] for sin that his father mother must have
[5:26] eat fruit as they were taught in that
[5:28] Garden but Abel by divine revelation
[5:31] know that it was a blood that did it
[5:35] by divine revelation and the Bible said
[5:38] in Hebrews the 12th chapter 11 chapter
[5:40] that Abel by faith Revelation offered
[5:44] unto God a more excellent sacrifice that
[5:47] came by which God testified that he was
[5:49] righteous
[5:50] is that right amen brothers sisters just
[5:54] as plain as anything can be I mean
[5:55] there's the whole thing
[5:58] now on the marriage and divorce it has
[6:00] to be revealed until it's revealed you
[6:03] don't know it but he promised in this
[6:06] last days in this age that every hidden
[6:08] Mystery in the Bible would be redeemed I
[6:11] mean it was at Revelations the 10th
[6:13] chapter Jesus Promised it
[6:16] that all of these hidden mysteries on on
[6:19] marriage and divorce all these other
[6:22] Hidden Mysteries that's been were being
[6:24] revealed in the end time
[6:28] now you remember the voice said go to
[6:29] Tucson remember the Mystic light in the
[6:32] skies the Seven Angels standing there
[6:34] come back in the opening of The Seven
[6:35] Seals watch what's taking place
[6:38] that is true now just a little bit
[6:41] farther but now here
[6:45] I know you took time for you go eat but
[6:47] I'm just eating fine
[6:51] amen notice
[6:53] how the woman's got her place
[6:57] and she is a jewel
[6:59] Solomon this man had had 10 000 wives
[7:03] or had a thousand wise rather
[7:06] he said
[7:07] that a man that's found a wife has found
[7:10] a good team
[7:12] he said a good woman is a jewel in his
[7:15] crown that's an honor
[7:18] but our unrighteous one is water in his
[7:21] blood that's his life
[7:24] he said there might be a one righteous
[7:27] man found in a thousand Solomon said
[7:29] this
[7:30] but said you wouldn't find one righteous
[7:32] woman in a thousand
[7:35] said that
[7:37] now notice that
[7:40] that how it is but you see woman
[7:45] you are
[7:46] you are a jewel
[7:48] if you want to be a jewel
[7:51] but the desire has to be by you and you
[7:54] see while the marriage and divorce was
[7:55] and Jesus pointed back on her it was
[7:57] because your time was the cause of all
[8:01] sin that's the reason polygmy and
[8:03] divorce and things was introduced at the
[8:05] beginning it never was so and it won't
[8:07] be so in the World Over Yonder
[8:10] look at Jacob out of whom come the
[8:13] Patriarchs
[8:15] he had at least a dozen wives
[8:20] he married two sisters and had concubine
[8:23] wise besides that common law women that
[8:26] he lived with and those Patriarchs is
[8:28] born right out of those concubine women
[8:34] is that right
[8:36] amen see you have to make the world run
[8:37] smooth oh I got pages on them
[8:40] if a clergyman ever questions me on it
[8:43] and then we get together we can talk it
[8:45] but surely if he's got any spirituality
[8:47] at all he can see right here it's the
[8:48] truth
[8:49] there's no question to him
[8:51] a good woman is a good thing I know that
[8:55] I know it by real women I've met real
[8:58] women as genuine just as real as any man
[9:00] that ever walked
[9:02] she's a byproduct and a piece of him and
[9:05] in the fall he listened to her and he
[9:08] just she's part of him
[9:10] but it's up to her she's made so she can
[9:13] be filthy
[9:15] and she's given the right to refuse or
[9:17] to accept
[9:20] that's contrary to the original nature
[9:23] that at the beginning see but there you
[9:26] are now
[9:28] it's 12 o'clock
[9:30] so I'll just omit something here for a
[9:32] few minutes
[9:33] I want to ask you something
[9:35] now remember
[9:38] I say this to just my group only
[9:42] and out in the air
[9:44] I'm saying this to only my own followers
[9:48] this message is only to them
[9:50] and what I'm going to say here any
[9:52] Minister that's his sh he's a Shepherd
[9:55] of the flock let him do whatever he
[9:56] wants to that's up to him and God any
[9:59] priest any preacher that's up to you my
[10:01] brother I'm only speaking you're in
[10:03] Jeffersonville the only place I'd speak
[10:04] this at is because it's my own flock
[10:08] it's a flock that the Holy Ghost give me
[10:10] to understand to be overseer over and
[10:12] he'll hold me responsible for it
[10:16] these people of mine's been converts
[10:18] here from across the land that have led
[10:20] to Christ and little children I'm here
[10:22] to help you and I am your friend you
[10:24] might think I'll speak against you I'm
[10:26] saying this to you for your good
[10:28] Ness I love you
[10:30] and if that isn't so God's my judge
[10:33] you know I love you
[10:35] this is an awful strong thing I didn't
[10:38] know how to bring it out what did I do
[10:41] when I got men and women sitting in my
[10:43] congregation someone's been married
[10:45] twice to three times
[10:47] good man and good women
[10:49] all mixed up I've done it false teaching
[10:55] exactly not waiting on the Lord
[10:57] what God has joined together let no man
[11:00] put us and I want man join together what
[11:02] God joined together
[11:03] when you got a direct Revelation from
[11:05] God that's your wife and the same thing
[11:07] that's yours the rest of your life
[11:09] see but what man joins together anybody
[11:12] can put apart but what God joins
[11:14] together no man better dare to touch it
[11:17] whatsoever God joins together said let
[11:19] no man put us under
[11:21] not what some half drunk magistrate or
[11:23] something else put together
[11:24] or some backslidden preacher
[11:26] with a bunch of Creeds and a book that
[11:28] let them do anything in the world the
[11:29] word of God laying right there
[11:31] amen thank you I'm talking about what
[11:33] God joined together
[11:36] now
[11:38] I want to say this to you
[11:41] I'm very careful what I say to you
[11:45] I don't mean to be rough with you three
[11:47] people I don't mean to be rough with you
[11:49] my pastor Brothers
[11:51] I don't mean that but I'm responsible
[11:55] realizing that this has been given into
[11:57] my hands and if I can't hold it
[12:01] I don't know how to give it out and I
[12:03] know that this tape will go oh my I just
[12:06] get rid of the office open up cause here
[12:08] it comes
[12:09] just like it was on the serpent seed but
[12:12] it's absolutely proven to be right
[12:15] I got papers I hear out of paper of
[12:17] women right now and even in in the great
[12:20] some of the great diocese has got the
[12:22] pictures of the original a snake
[12:24] crawling a woman's leg just and how it
[12:27] goes around her she has all kinds of
[12:29] Sensations and things something that a
[12:31] man could never touch her with this huge
[12:32] snake wrapping around her and so forth
[12:34] that's exactly the truth and it's going
[12:37] worse and worse and will get worse
[12:39] serpent which he was not he could not
[12:42] have had the sex affair with her when he
[12:44] was a serpent but remember I was having
[12:46] a debate the other day with a not a
[12:48] debate just a Assembly of God Minister
[12:50] and associate said you're wrong on that
[12:52] I said I may be I'd like for you to tell
[12:55] me he said to anyone he had begin to
[12:56] talk about it first thing you know he
[12:58] got himself lost
[12:59] and one thing he said he said brother
[13:01] Abraham where is that specie God said
[13:04] one of his kind now worry is that specie
[13:06] you said was between man and beasts that
[13:09] science can't find out where is he at
[13:12] said is he on the Earth was he a
[13:14] chimpanzee no because of Japan's blood
[13:16] won't mix with a woman
[13:18] no other animal mixed with her no
[13:21] that water neither will a man spurn uh
[13:24] mixed with a with a female it won't do
[13:26] it then where is that certain animal now
[13:29] God said let everything bring forth of
[13:31] its kind I'll wait it just a minute in
[13:33] the sweetness of the holy spirit said
[13:34] tell him it's here
[13:36] now at first I said well it may become
[13:38] distinct he said but brother Branham
[13:39] that we are talking about the word
[13:41] aren't we I said yes sir
[13:43] and I said the course claimed that the
[13:45] other things like dinosaurs and and
[13:47] Mammoth and so forth mammals mammals
[13:49] rather they're distinct and so forth I
[13:51] said it could have been that he said
[13:52] brother Branham we're talking about
[13:53] proof of the word of sin sure then the
[13:56] original sinner ought to be here also
[13:59] amen and I said Lord Jesus you said take
[14:01] no thought watch you shall say when you
[14:03] come before man because of me given to
[14:05] you in that hour Lord what shall I say
[14:06] he said tell him it's here
[14:08] just the same as C divisions on the
[14:10] platform I set a chair not knowing where
[14:15] he said where and before I could even
[14:18] think he said it's a serpent
[14:20] it's exactly what it was for he's no
[14:23] longer a beast he was cursed and put on
[14:26] his belly for the rest of his days he's
[14:28] here
[14:29] is that right and still in that act that
[14:32] he done that's still the same sin Works
[14:34] around a woman like a male sex like that
[14:36] that's where she has her walleye
[14:38] conditions and things when she has her
[14:40] Sensations far beyond what any man could
[14:42] ever do
[14:43] I'll stop there because we're in a mixed
[14:45] crowd against the man I'll we'll talk
[14:47] more about it got all the papers and
[14:48] things laying around here right at my
[14:49] hand right now now let's go to bring to
[14:51] you this morning let's go take the full
[14:53] day in this but

[14:59] to my church only the not my church The
[15:02] Little Flock that believes me and
[15:03] follows me this is to them
[15:06] the other day knowing that when I tell
[15:09] you anything it must come thus saith the
[15:11] Lord
[15:12] then I had the scriptures as he revealed
[15:15] it to me but Lord God what can I say to
[15:17] that congregation
[15:19] I'll have separations

[15:31] do
[15:32] something said to me go up yonder in the
[15:34] mountain
[15:35] I'll talk to you
[15:39] and while I was up in the mountain not
[15:41] knowing that down in Tucson they were
[15:44] seeing me
[15:46] but even this teachers call the children
[15:51] from my little girl in them from the
[15:53] school room
[15:55] and said look the internet Mountain
[15:59] there's a fiery looking Amber Cloud
[16:01] going up in the air and coming back down
[16:03] going up in the air coming right now
[16:08] Miss Evans are you here

[16:15] I come on back down to the station this
[16:17] young boy by The Filling Station at
[16:19] Evans Filling Station there
[16:21] and before I known what the boy was
[16:23] going to say Tuck Me On My Feet
[16:25] you said brother Graham
[16:27] he was up in that mountain over here
[16:30] I said what do you mean Ronnie no see
[16:33] you'll see what he was going to do a lot
[16:34] of times things happen I don't you don't
[16:36] say it to people it becomes the thing of
[16:38] it is you see so much happening becomes
[16:40] common to you see I just don't tell the
[16:42] people I surrounding what was you he
[16:44] said I'm sure you're right where you
[16:45] were at I said I'll call Mama and we
[16:48] stood here and watched that cloud
[16:49] hanging up in here going up and down I
[16:50] said it's got to be Brethren sitting up
[16:52] in there somewhere that's God's helping
[16:54] God
[16:56] and the whole city people looked at it
[16:58] on a bright day with no clouds over it
[17:01] over this big Amber Cloud hanging there
[17:03] coming down like a funneling going back
[17:04] and spreading out
[17:06] foreign
[17:09] friends
[17:11] and then I'm closing you can go from
[17:13] this
[17:15] that's when this was being revealed to
[17:17] me what I'm going to tell you right now
[17:20] so don't miss it
[17:24] now I'm speaking to our followers only
[17:27] who's following me and this message
[17:30] only not the outside
[17:33] bearing me a record of this before God
[17:36] just to this group only
[17:39] now we are found in this mess because of
[17:44] misinterpreted theology
[17:46] is that right
[17:48] that's why you women married a second
[17:50] time in you man because misinterpret
[17:52] theology
[17:54] now I want to show you something that he
[17:56] told me
[18:01] and if God our creator
[18:05] was questioned the question when he was
[18:07] here on Earth Jesus Christ
[18:10] and when he is delivering Prophet came
[18:13] forth Moses
[18:15] down in Egypt to bring the children out
[18:18] of his of Egypt to put him in the
[18:20] Promised Land
[18:23] and Jesus said here
[18:25] that Moses seen the people in this
[18:29] condition
[18:30] and he granted them a writing of
[18:33] divorcement because the situation was
[18:36] what it was
[18:39] Moses found
[18:41] such as let him suffer God permitted
[18:46] Moses
[18:47] that prophets sent to the people
[18:51] to Grant this writing of divorcement to
[18:53] him
[18:54] and in First Corinthians the the seventh
[18:58] chapter the 12th and 5th verse in the
[19:02] New Testament prophet
[19:04] Paul who met the same thing in the
[19:08] church
[19:09] and spoke this this is I not the Lord
[19:16] is that right
[19:17] because of the divorce conditions
[19:22] it wasn't so from the beginning but
[19:25] Moses was permitted it and God
[19:28] recognized that righteousness
[19:31] and Paul also had to write when he found
[19:34] his church in that condition
[19:37] now
[19:39] you believe this to be true
[19:42] amen and believe it to come from God
[19:46] and by the Vindication of his cloud and
[19:50] his message just brought me this far
[19:54] should not guard up on the mountain
[19:56] permit me to do the same thing to suffer
[19:58] yet to go on the way you are and do it
[20:00] no more go with your wives and live in
[20:03] peace
[20:04] for the hour is late
[20:08] the coming of the Lord is at hand
[20:11] we haven't got time to break these
[20:13] things up
[20:15] don't you dare try to do it again I'm
[20:18] speaking only to my congregation
[20:21] but if you are married
[20:23] and God bore me witness of that on the
[20:25] mountain that I could say this
[20:27] a supernatural Revelation because of the
[20:31] opening of The Seven Seals and this is a
[20:34] question in God's word
[20:36] let them go on in the eyes they are and
[20:40] sin no more
[20:44] it wasn't so from the beginning that is
[20:47] right it wasn't so and it will not be at
[20:50] the end but under moderate conditions as
[20:54] God's servant I won't call myself his
[20:56] Prophet but I believe maybe if I
[20:58] wouldn't be sent for that I'm laying a
[21:00] ground for him when it does come so
[21:02] under the modern conditions I command
[21:05] you to go to your home with your life
[21:08] now if you are happy with her live with
[21:11] her raise your children in the emanation
[21:14] of God but God be merciful to you if you
[21:17] ever do that again
[21:18] you teach your children to never do a
[21:21] thing like that bring them up in the
[21:22] emanation club and now that you are as
[21:25] you are let us go now to late evening
[21:27] hour that we're living in and press
[21:29] towards the mark of the high calling in
[21:32] Christ for all things will be possible
[21:34] until I see you tonight the Lord God
[21:37] bless you while we pray Lord God we give
[21:40] you thanks
[21:42] we give you praise
[21:44] Thou Art the same great Jehovah
[21:48] that suffered Moses
[21:50] Moors is that servant what would he tell
[21:52] these people and God you suffered him to
[21:55] give a riding of divorcement
[21:58] Paul the great Apostle who was the
[22:00] writer of the New Testament as Moses was
[22:03] of the old
[22:05] Moses wrote the laws
[22:08] and a dispensation of laws
[22:11] May the prophets their words was
[22:13] injected into it but Moses wrote the
[22:16] laws
[22:18] and you suffered him already to write
[22:21] them a writing of divorcement
[22:22] because of the hardness of their heart
[22:25] the great Saint Paul being the writer of
[22:29] the New Testament
[22:30] could also make such an assertion
[22:34] that I speak under these conditions ah
[22:38] not the Lord
[22:41] so is it today Lord God at the end of
[22:44] the world
[22:45] as we're here unto the mercy of God
[22:49] knowing it soon we're to answer in his
[22:52] presence
[22:54] and that you have did so much Lord I'm
[22:56] sure in the sight of these people
[22:58] they'll hang on to this like it come
[23:01] from you and to Bear record year to day
[23:03] of many people sitting here that even
[23:05] saw that
[23:07] sign up in the mountain or the angels of
[23:10] the Lord came in the Whirlwind where it
[23:12] came in the Seven Angels or the
[23:14] revealing other seven Mysteries was
[23:16] unfolded and that same angel in the same
[23:20] direction on the same Mountain the day
[23:22] that this was revealed God I pray that
[23:25] the people who go home being thankful
[23:27] that God has granted this grace to them
[23:30] I only spoke at Lord through permission
[23:32] and I only say it to permission Lord and
[23:35] let the people be so grateful that
[23:37] they'll never try to do that sin again
[23:39] and may they never try to do any sin but
[23:43] love you with all their hearts Lord make
[23:46] these families happy and may they grow
[23:48] and raise their children in the
