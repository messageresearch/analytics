[0:00] [Music]
[0:52] then we see a perfect picture in abraham
[0:54] son of the flesh ishmael who teased and
[0:57] fought the son of promise isaac
[1:00] and there was esau who hated jacob and
[1:02] would have killed him had not god
[1:03] intervened
[1:05] in the new testament we find judas
[1:06] betraying jesus while the religious
[1:09] orders of the first century attempted to
[1:11] destroy the early believers
[1:13] the children of this world controlled by
[1:15] the devil hate the children of god who
[1:17] are controlled by the spirit
[1:19] no matter how just and upright a
[1:21] christian is before the public and how
[1:23] gracious he is to his fellow man doing
[1:26] naught but good let him confess christ
[1:28] as his savior and acknowledge the
[1:30] operation of the gifts of the holy
[1:31] spirit in tongues prophecy healing and
[1:34] miracles and he will be condemned
[1:37] the spirit of this world hates the
[1:38] spirit of god
[1:40] and because it can't overcome the spirit
[1:42] of the lord it tries to destroy the
[1:44] vessel in whom the spirit of truth
[1:45] dwells
[1:47] persecution and trials are a natural
[1:49] normal part of the christian life
[1:52] there is only one thing you can do about
[1:53] them
[1:54] commit them all to god judge not and
[1:57] leave their outworking and final
[1:59] judgment to him
[2:01] thou canst not bear them which are evil
[2:04] and thou has tried them which say they
[2:06] are apostles and are not and has found
[2:08] them liars
[2:10] these ephesians believe that god's
[2:12] people ought to be holy
[2:14] according to this verse they took steps
[2:16] to keep the body unleavened from sin
[2:18] most evidently the apostasy had already
[2:21] started sin had entered into the church
[2:24] but they were obedient to the words of
[2:26] paul when he said to put away the wicked
[2:28] from amongst them
[2:29] they were a separated people
[2:31] they had come out of the world and now
[2:33] they weren't going to let the world
[2:34] enter amongst them
[2:36] they would not put up with sin in the
[2:38] church holiness wasn't a phrase with
[2:40] them or a figure of speech it was a way
[2:43] of life
[2:45] thou hast tried them that say they are
[2:47] apostles and are not and hast found them
[2:49] liars
[2:51] my that is a blunt statement
[2:53] thou has tried them who call themselves
[2:55] apostles
[2:56] isn't that presumptuous
[2:58] what right has a people to try those who
[3:00] call themselves apostles
[3:02] and how do they try them
[3:04] oh i love this
[3:06] here it is in galatians 1 8
[3:09] but though we or an angel from heaven
[3:11] preach any other gospel unto you then
[3:13] that which we have already preached unto
[3:15] you let him be accursed it was the
[3:18] apostles who brought the original word
[3:20] to the people
[3:21] that original word could not change not
[3:24] even a dot or dash of it
[3:26] paul knew it was god who had spoken to
[3:28] him so he said
[3:29] even if i come and try to give a second
[3:31] revelation try to make one little change
[3:34] in what i gave originally let me be
[3:36] accursed
[3:37] you see paul knew that first revelation
[3:39] was correct
[3:41] god can't give a first revelation than a
[3:43] second revelation
[3:45] if he did he would be changing his mind
[3:47] he can give a revelation and then add to
[3:50] it as he did in the garden of eden when
[3:52] he promised the seed to the woman
[3:54] and then later designated that seed had
[3:56] to come through abraham
[3:58] and then later said it would come by the
[4:00] same bloodlines in david
[4:02] but it was the same revelation
[4:05] it only gave the people more information
[4:07] to help them receive and understand it
[4:09] but god's word can't change
[4:12] the seed came exactly as revealed
[4:15] hallelujah
[4:16] and see what those false apostles were
[4:18] doing
[4:19] they came with their own word
[4:21] those ephesians knew that word as paul
[4:23] had taught it they were full of the holy
[4:25] ghost by the laying on of paul's hands
[4:29] they looked those false apostles in the
[4:30] eye and said
[4:32] you are not saying what paul said
[4:34] you are therefore false
[4:37] oh that sets my heart on fire
[4:39] get back to the word
[4:41] it is not you that really tries the
[4:43] apostle and prophet and teacher it is
[4:45] the word that tries them
[4:48] one of these days there is going to come
[4:49] a prophet to the laodicean church age
[4:52] and you will know if he is the real one
[4:54] sent from god or not yes you will
[4:57] for if he is of god he will be in that
[5:00] word exactly as god gave it to paul he
[5:02] won't deviate from that word for a
[5:04] moment not by one iota
[5:07] in that last stage when there will be
[5:09] many false prophets appearing watch and
[5:12] see how they keep telling you that if
[5:14] you don't believe them and what they say
[5:16] you will be lost
[5:18] but when that last day prophet comes on
[5:20] the scene if he is truly that prophet
[5:22] he will be crying out
[5:24] get back to the word or you are lost
[5:27] he won't build on a private revelation
[5:29] or interpretation but on the word
[5:31] amen and amen
[5:34] these false apostles are the grievous
[5:36] wolves that paul spoke of he said
[5:39] once i am gone they will try to come and
[5:41] claim equal revelation but their purpose
[5:44] is not to help you but destroy you
[5:46] acts 20 27-32
[5:50] for i have not shunned to declare unto
[5:52] you all the counsel of god
[5:54] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[5:57] to all the flock over which the holy
[5:59] ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[6:01] the church of god which he hath
[6:03] purchased with his own blood for i know
[6:06] this that after my departing shall
[6:08] grievous wolves enter in among you not
[6:11] sparing the flock
[6:12] also of your own selves shall men arise
[6:15] speaking perverse things their own word
[6:17] and ideas not gods to draw away
[6:20] disciples after them
[6:22] therefore watch and remember that by the
[6:24] space of three years i ceased not to
[6:26] warn everyone night and day with tears
[6:29] and now brethren i command you to god
[6:32] and to the word of his grace
[6:34] which is able to build you up and to
[6:36] give you an inheritance among all them
[6:38] which are sanctified
[6:40] john knew of them also for he said in
[6:43] first john 4 1
[6:45] many false prophets are already gone out
[6:47] into the world
[6:49] that antichrist spirit was already
[6:50] infiltrating the church and it was doing
[6:53] it by going against the word
[6:56] why here is where it all started
[6:58] right here in the first church age
[7:00] already they were denying the word and
[7:02] setting up their own creeds and
[7:04] philosophies instead of the word
[7:06] that is antichrist
[7:08] for jesus is the word to be anti-word is
[7:11] to be anti-jesus to be anti-word is to
[7:14] be anti-christ because the spirit and
[7:16] the word are one
[7:18] if you are anti-word you will have to be
[7:20] antichrist
[7:22] and if it started in the first church it
[7:24] will have to grow until the end when it
[7:26] takes over
[7:28] and that is exactly what you will see as
[7:29] we cover all the ages
[7:31] it starts out real small in the ephesian
[7:33] age and it grows in every age until the
[7:36] anti-word antichrist system takes over
[7:39] entirely and the infallibility of the
[7:41] word is repudiated by the false apostles
[7:44] of the false church
[7:46] now it is easy to get a wrong impression
[7:48] of what we are talking about because i
[7:50] am making this so strong
[7:52] it could sound to you as though this
[7:54] anti-word antichrist spirit is a
[7:56] complete repudiation of the word a
[7:58] denial of the bible culminating in its
[8:00] rejection
[8:01] no sir it is not that
[8:04] what it is is revelation 22
[8:07] 18-19
[8:09] for i testify unto every man that
[8:11] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[8:13] this book if any man shall add unto
[8:16] these things god shall add unto him the
[8:18] plagues that are written in this book
[8:20] and if any man shall take away from the
[8:22] words of the book of this prophecy
[8:25] god shall take away his part out of the
[8:27] book of life
[8:28] and out of the holy city
[8:30] and from the things which are written in
[8:32] this book
[8:34] it is the changing of even just one word
[8:36] by taking away or adding to it
[8:38] it is the original trick of satan in the
[8:40] garden of eden
[8:42] he just added one little word to what
[8:44] god had said
[8:45] that did it it brought death and
[8:47] destruction
[8:49] and in ephesus it was just the same
[8:51] just a word added just a word taken away
[8:54] and the anti-word antichrist spirit
[8:56] began to flourish
[8:59] did you get it now
[9:00] there are those twins again
[9:02] there are those two trees again growing
[9:04] side by side in the same earth partaking
[9:07] of the same nourishment drinking in the
[9:09] same rain and benefiting by the same sun
[9:13] but they come from different seeds
[9:16] one tree is for the word of god exactly
[9:18] as god gave it and loves and obeys it
[9:21] the other tree is from the seed that is
[9:23] anti the word of god and changes it
[9:25] where it wants to
[9:27] it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas
[9:30] for the living true word exactly as did
[9:32] cain who ended up killing abel
[9:35] but fear not little
[9:37] stay with the word
[9:39] keep that word between you and the devil
[9:42] eve did not do that and she failed and
[9:45] when the church lets down on the word
[9:46] she goes into the depths of the darkness
[9:48] of satan
[9:51] and hast borne enhanced patience and for
[9:53] my name's sake hast labored and has not
[9:56] fainted
[9:57] this is just about the same as was said
[9:59] in verse two
[10:01] but in verse two the work
[10:03] labor and patience
[10:05] were from guarding the sacred word which
[10:07] was committed unto them
[10:09] how they kept away the adversaries what
[10:11] a credit they were to paul
[10:13] but in this verse their persecutions and
[10:15] trials and patience are over the blessed
[10:18] name of jesus
[10:20] you know that is not at all strange for
[10:22] it is the word and the name that brings
[10:24] the enemy pouring after us like a flood
[10:27] that mighty word which was manifested in
[10:29] healings signs wonders and other
[10:31] demonstrations caused the pharisees to
[10:33] scream out for the death of the true
[10:35] believers
[10:36] and now that name hated and despised by
[10:39] the jews is mocked by the cultured as
[10:41] they laughed to think anyone could be so
[10:43] foolish as to believe in a man who died
[10:45] and rose again and is now seated in
[10:47] heaven
[10:48] so here were the religious persecutors
[10:50] the jews cursing this jesus who to them
[10:53] was a false messiah
[10:55] and here were the others laughing with
[10:56] delight and mocking sarcastically at the
[10:58] name of a new god
[11:00] who to them wasn't a god at all
[11:03] now here is something else that started
[11:05] in that age and will continue right down
[11:07] through the ages getting deeper and
[11:09] darker
[11:10] that is
[11:11] people were repudiating that name
[11:14] it was not the true ephesian church that
[11:16] was doing it no sir
[11:18] it was the false apostles it was the
[11:21] outsider trying to get in and defile the
[11:22] believers
[11:24] the ephesians knew that name and loved
[11:26] it recall the origin of that ephesian
[11:28] church
[11:29] a little group of people who were
[11:31] looking for the messiah heard that a
[11:33] prophet who called himself the
[11:34] forerunner of the messiah had appeared
[11:36] in the desert of palestine and was
[11:38] baptizing people under repentance of
[11:40] sins
[11:41] these then receive the baptism of john
[11:44] but when paul came to them he showed
[11:46] them that the prophet was dead that
[11:48] jesus had come and fulfilled his life as
[11:51] a sacrifice for sin
[11:52] and that now the holy ghost was come and
[11:54] would enter in and fill all true
[11:56] believers in jesus the messiah
[11:59] when they heard this they were baptized
[12:02] in the name of the lord jesus
[12:04] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[12:06] them they were all filled with the holy
[12:08] ghost
[12:09] they knew what it was to obey the word
[12:11] to be baptized in his name
[12:13] lord jesus christ
[12:15] and in that way they knew they would be
[12:17] filled with the holy spirit
[12:19] you could not get that people to change
[12:21] they knew the truth
[12:23] acts 19 1-7
[12:27] they knew the power of that name
[12:29] they saw that name was so powerful that
[12:31] even aprons taken from the body of paul
[12:33] and sent in jesus name to suffering
[12:36] people could deliver the sick from all
[12:38] manner of diseases and cast out evil
[12:40] spirits
[12:41] so manifestly wonderful did that name
[12:43] perform that reprobate jews at ephesus
[12:45] attempted to use it to exercise devils
[12:48] acts 19 11-17
[12:52] god brought special miracles by the
[12:53] hands of paul
[12:55] so that from his body were brought onto
[12:57] the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the
[12:59] diseases departed from them and the evil
[13:02] spirits went out of them
[13:04] then certain of the vagabond jews
[13:06] exorcists took upon them to call over
[13:08] them which had evil spirits the name of
[13:10] the lord jesus saying
[13:12] we adjure you by jesus whom paul
[13:14] preacheth
[13:15] and there were seven sons of juan seva a
[13:18] jew and chief of the priests which did
[13:20] so
[13:21] and the evil spirit answered and said
[13:24] jesus i know and paul i know but who are
[13:26] ye
[13:28] and the man in whom the evil spirit was
[13:30] leaped on them and overcame them and
[13:32] prevailed against them so that they fled
[13:35] out of that house naked and wounded
[13:37] and this was known to all the jews and
[13:39] greeks also dwelling at ephesus
[13:41] and fear fell on them all
[13:44] and the name of the lord jesus was
[13:45] magnified
[13:48] they knew the righteous life that
[13:50] accompanied the bearing of that name
[13:52] for whosoever nameth the name of the
[13:54] lord let him depart from sin
[13:56] be ye holy ye that bear the vessels of
[13:58] the lord
[14:00] thou shalt not bear the name of the lord
[14:01] thy god in vain
[14:03] these ephesians were christians
[14:06] they bore a name and that name was
[14:08] christ
[14:09] who was the spirit of god within them
[14:11] and which was one of the threefold names
[14:13] of their lord
[14:15] and for my name's sake hast labored and
[14:17] has not fainted
[14:19] these believers weren't laboring for
[14:21] paul or for an organization
[14:23] they weren't committed to programs and
[14:25] institutions whereby they built up
[14:27] holdings of value
[14:29] they worked for the lord they were his
[14:31] servants not the pawns of organization
[14:34] they didn't go to church on sunday and
[14:36] talk about that name and then forget it
[14:38] the rest of the week
[14:39] they didn't give lip service to that
[14:41] name
[14:42] no sir
[14:43] it was their lives that were given
[14:47] all they did they did in that name
[14:49] in that name they acted but if they
[14:52] could not act in that name then they
[14:53] refrained from acting
[14:55] these were heavenly placed christians
[14:57] whose behavior was in the lord
[15:00] but that false vine group that wanted to
[15:02] defile that name hung like skulking
[15:04] wolves in the dark
[15:06] waiting to get in and tear down
[15:08] but the saints stood the test and kept
[15:11] the word and the name
[15:14] the complaint of god
[15:16] revelation 2 4
[15:19] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[15:21] thee
[15:22] because thou hast left thy first love
[15:25] to understand this you must realize that
[15:27] the spirit is not speaking to the
[15:29] original saints of ephesus alone
[15:31] this message is to the entire age which
[15:34] lasted about 120 years
[15:36] its message then is to all the
[15:39] generations in that span
[15:41] now history keeps repeating itself
[15:43] in the generations of israel we see
[15:45] revival in one generation only to see
[15:48] the fires fading in the next
[15:50] in the third generation embers may be
[15:52] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[15:54] may be no vestige whatsoever of that
[15:56] original flame
[15:58] then god lights the fire again and the
[16:00] same process is repeated
[16:03] it is simply the manifestation of the
[16:05] truth that god has no grandchildren
[16:07] salvation is not passed on by natural
[16:10] birth any more than is there any truth
[16:12] to apostolic succession
[16:14] it isn't in the word
[16:16] you start out with truly born again
[16:18] believers and when the next generation
[16:20] comes along they are no longer just
[16:22] plain christians but they have taken a
[16:24] denominational name and are now baptists
[16:27] methodists etc
[16:29] that is exactly what they are too
[16:31] they are not christians
[16:34] you have to be born of the will of god
[16:36] not the will of man to be saved
[16:38] but these folks are all coming together
[16:40] now by the will of man
[16:42] i don't say that some of them aren't
[16:43] right with god
[16:45] not for a minute do i say that but the
[16:47] original fire has died down
[16:49] they are not the same anymore
[16:52] the fervent desire to please god the
[16:55] passion to know his word the cry for
[16:57] reaching out in the spirit all begins to
[17:00] fade and instead of that church being on
[17:02] fire with the fire of god it has cooled
[17:04] off and become a bit formal
[17:07] that is what was happening back there to
[17:08] the ephesians they were getting a bit
[17:10] formal
[17:11] the abandonment to god was dying out and
[17:14] the people weren't too careful about
[17:15] what god thought of them as they began
[17:17] to be careful about what the world
[17:19] thought of them
[17:20] that second generation coming on was
[17:22] just like israel
[17:24] they demanded a king to be like the
[17:26] other nations
[17:27] when they did that they rejected god but
[17:30] they did it anyway that is the history
[17:33] of the church
[17:34] when it thinks more of conforming to the
[17:36] world instead of conforming to god it
[17:38] isn't long until you see them stop doing
[17:40] things they used to do and start doing
[17:43] things they wouldn't do initially
[17:45] they change their manner of dress their
[17:47] attitudes and their behavior they get
[17:49] lacks
[17:50] that is what ephesus means
[17:52] relaxed drifting
[17:55] that cycle of revival and death has
[17:57] never failed
[17:58] all you have to do is recall this last
[18:00] move of god in the spirit when men and
[18:02] women dressed like christians went to
[18:04] church prayed all night took to street
[18:07] corners and weren't ashamed of the
[18:09] manifestations of the spirit
[18:11] they left their old dead churches and
[18:13] worshipped in homes or old store
[18:15] buildings they had reality
[18:17] but it wasn't too long a time until they
[18:19] began to get enough money to build fine
[18:21] new churches
[18:23] they put in a choir instead of singing
[18:25] unto god for themselves
[18:27] they put gowns on the choir
[18:29] they organized a movement and ran it by
[18:31] man
[18:32] they soon began to read books that
[18:34] weren't fit to read
[18:35] they let down the bars and goats came in
[18:37] and took over
[18:39] the cry of joy was gone
[18:41] the freedom of the spirit was gone
[18:43] oh they kept on with a form but the fire
[18:46] had died down and the blackness of ashes
[18:48] is about all that is left
[18:50] a few moments ago i mentioned that john
[18:53] understood what it was to love god
[18:55] that great apostle of love would
[18:57] certainly see it when the church began
[18:58] to lose that first love of god
[19:01] in first john 5 3 he says
[19:04] for this is the love of god that we keep
[19:06] his commandments his word
[19:09] one little deviation from that word was
[19:11] a step away from christ
[19:13] people say they love god they go to
[19:15] church they even shout and rejoice and
[19:18] sing and have a great emotional time
[19:20] but when it is all over watch and see if
[19:23] they are in that word
[19:25] walking in it living in it
[19:27] if they go through all the other and
[19:29] then don't walk in that word
[19:31] they can say they love god but their
[19:33] lives tell another story
[19:35] i wonder if john didn't see a lot of
[19:37] that before he died
[19:39] people saying they loved god but not
[19:41] obeying his word
[19:43] oh ephesian church something is
[19:45] happening to you
[19:46] someone is trying to either add to that
[19:48] word or take from it
[19:50] but they are doing it so subtly that you
[19:52] can't see it
[19:53] they haven't made a move so big you can
[19:55] see it out there in the open it is
[19:57] undercover
[19:58] and they are bringing it by way of
[20:00] reason and human understanding and it
[20:02] will take over unless you refuse it
[20:04] go back to pentecost before it is too
[20:07] late
[20:08] but as usual people don't heed god's
[20:11] warning
[20:12] that revival fire built upon the sacred
[20:14] word is so wonderful and the
[20:16] manifestation of the spirit so blessed
[20:18] that a little fear creeps in and a
[20:20] whisper in the heart says
[20:22] how can we protect this truth we have
[20:25] what can we do to see this revival goes
[20:27] on
[20:28] that is when the antichrist spirit comes
[20:30] in and whispers
[20:32] look you have the truth now see that it
[20:35] doesn't get lost
[20:36] organize and set up your creed of what
[20:38] you believe
[20:39] put it all in a church manual
[20:42] and they do it they organize
[20:44] they add to the word
[20:46] and they die just like eve did for
[20:48] taking one wrong word
[20:50] it's god's word that brings life
[20:53] and it's not what we say about the word
[20:55] that counts but it's what god said
[20:59] the warning of god revelation 2 5
[21:04] remember therefore from whence thou art
[21:06] fallen and repent and do the first works
[21:09] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[21:11] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[21:13] his place except thou repent
[21:16] god tells them to remember
[21:18] evidently something had left their minds
[21:21] they had forgotten something
[21:23] he told them to turn back in their minds
[21:25] to their point of origin
[21:26] the origin of the first age was
[21:28] pentecost they had fallen from it
[21:31] they had forgotten the glory and wonder
[21:33] of it
[21:34] it was time to go back in mind and then
[21:36] in reality
[21:37] back to when they could say
[21:39] for me to live is christ
[21:42] back to purity when ananias and sapphira
[21:44] were dealt with back to the gate
[21:46] beautiful
[21:48] oh what a reproach it is to drift from
[21:50] god and countenance those acts that
[21:51] defile his name
[21:53] let those who name his name depart from
[21:55] sin and keep their vessels pure for god
[21:59] look at what you once were in your heart
[22:01] and mind and in your life
[22:03] then go back to it
[22:05] and what is the way back
[22:07] the way is the way of repentance
[22:09] if a sinner has to come to god by way of
[22:11] repentance then the lukewarm or
[22:13] backslider will have to repent that much
[22:15] more
[22:16] repent
[22:17] bring forth fruits meat for repentance
[22:20] prove it by your life
[22:22] if you do not repent said god i will
[22:25] remove your lampstand
[22:27] certainly
[22:28] a church in that condition can't give
[22:30] light to the world its light has turned
[22:32] to darkness
[22:34] god will then take away its faithful
[22:36] messenger and its faithful shepherds and
[22:38] leave them to themselves and they will
[22:40] go on talking about christianity but be
[22:43] bereft of it
[22:44] repent quickly don't hesitate
[22:47] evidently ephesus did hesitate for her
[22:50] lifespan was not very long
[22:52] the glory of god decreased ever so
[22:54] rapidly
[22:55] it was not long until the city was in
[22:57] ruins
[22:58] its glorious temple became a shapeless
[23:00] mass
[23:01] the land became a marsh inhabited by
[23:03] waterfowl the population was gone except
[23:06] for a few unbelievers in a squalid
[23:07] village
[23:08] there was not even one christian left
[23:11] the lamp was rent from its place
[23:15] now it does not mean that she could not
[23:16] have repented
[23:18] it does not mean that we cannot repent
[23:20] we can
[23:21] but it must be quickly it must be a true
[23:24] heart cry to god in sorrow and then god
[23:27] will restore
[23:29] the glory shall come again
[23:33] the seed of
[23:34] nicolaitanism revelation 2 6
[23:39] but this thou hast that thou hatest the
[23:41] deeds of the nicolaitans which i also
[23:44] hate
[23:45] now there are two thoughts on what the
[23:47] nicolaitans were
[23:49] it is said by some that they were a
[23:51] group of apostates who had as their
[23:53] founder nicholas of antioch a proselyte
[23:56] who became one of the seven deacons at
[23:58] jerusalem
[23:59] they had pagan feasts and were most
[24:01] unchaste in their behavior
[24:03] they taught that in order to master
[24:05] sensuality one would have to know by
[24:07] experience the whole range of it at
[24:09] first
[24:10] naturally they gave way to such abandon
[24:12] that their degradation was complete
[24:14] thus they had applied to them the two
[24:16] old testament names that symbolized such
[24:18] extravagances
[24:20] balaam and jezebel
[24:23] since balaam corrupted the people and
[24:24] thus conquered them it was said that
[24:26] nicholas did likewise this group was
[24:28] supposedly forced out of ephesus and
[24:31] found a place of establishment in
[24:32] pergamos
[24:34] but the problem about this belief is
[24:36] that it is not true
[24:38] there is absolutely no history for it
[24:41] it is at best tradition
[24:43] to adopt such a view would make the
[24:45] church age of ephesus absolutely
[24:47] historical with no bearing upon today
[24:50] this is not true for whatever starts in
[24:52] the early church must continue in every
[24:54] age until it is finally blessed and
[24:56] exalted by god or destroyed as an
[24:59] unclean thing in the lake of fire
[25:02] that this tradition is actually against
[25:04] scripture simply note that in revelation
[25:06] 2 2
[25:07] the ephesian church could not bear the
[25:10] evil ones
[25:11] they thus had to put them out or it
[25:13] would not make sense to say they could
[25:15] not bear them
[25:17] if they did not put them out then they
[25:18] were bearing them
[25:20] now in verse 6 it says that they hated
[25:22] their deeds
[25:24] so this nicolaitan group remained a part
[25:26] of the first age doing their deeds
[25:29] the deeds were hated but the people were
[25:31] not rendered impotent
[25:33] thus we see seeds in ephesus that will
[25:35] continue and will become a doctrine that
[25:36] will go right up to and into the lake of
[25:39] fire
[25:40] what are these nicolaitans the word
[25:43] comes from two greek words
[25:45] mikhoe which means to conquer and leos
[25:48] which means the laity
[25:51] in plain fact somebody was doing
[25:53] something in that early church which was
[25:54] conquering the laity
[25:56] if the laity were being conquered then
[25:58] it must have been some authority there
[26:00] doing it
[26:02] what was it that god hated that was
[26:03] happening in that church
[26:05] what was going on then and is now going
[26:07] on today is exactly what the word
[26:09] nicolaitan means
[26:11] the people were being subjected somehow
[26:13] in a way that was absolutely contrary to
[26:15] the word of god
[26:17] now to get the real meaning of what we
[26:19] are about to go into i must caution you
[26:21] to ever keep in mind that religion
[26:24] spiritual matters if you like
[26:26] is composed of two parts that intertwine
[26:28] but are as opposite as black and white
[26:31] religion and the spiritual world are
[26:33] made of those two trees which had their
[26:34] roots in eden
[26:36] both the tree of life and the tree of
[26:38] the knowledge of good and evil stood in
[26:40] the midst of the garden and no doubt
[26:42] their very branches intertwined each
[26:43] other
[26:45] thus in the ephesian church is that same
[26:47] paradox
[26:48] the church is made up of good and bad
[26:51] two vines make the church
[26:53] they are like the wheat and tares
[26:55] growing up side by side
[26:57] but one is the true
[26:59] the other is the false
[27:01] now god will speak to each one and he
[27:03] will talk about each one he will call
[27:06] them the church
[27:07] and only the elect will really know
[27:09] which is the true spirit
[27:11] only the elect will not be deceived
[27:14] matthew 24 24
[27:16] for there shall arise false christs and
[27:19] false prophets and shall shew great
[27:21] signs and wonders
[27:23] in so much that if it were possible they
[27:25] shall deceive the very elect
[27:27] so way back there in the early church a
[27:29] very short period after pentecost
[27:31] the false vine got to intertwine itself
[27:34] around the true vine and we find these
[27:36] deeds of the nicolaitans
[27:38] and that spirit is going to be found
[27:40] fighting the true vine until it is
[27:42] destroyed by god
[27:43] now have you got it
[27:45] all right
[27:47] now what was the spiritual climate of
[27:49] that church
[27:50] it had left its first love
[27:52] leaving its first love of the word of
[27:54] god was revealed to us as having fallen
[27:57] from its origin which was pentecost
[28:00] in plain english that means this church
[28:02] was in danger of being taken away from
[28:04] the leading of the holy spirit the
[28:06] control of the spirit
[28:08] this was exactly what took place after
[28:10] moses led israel out of egypt
[28:13] the way of god was to lead them by the
[28:15] cloud of fire prophetic utterance
[28:17] miracles and signs and god-given wonders
[28:20] this was to be accomplished by
[28:22] god selected and god ordained and god
[28:25] equipped and god sent men
[28:28] with the whole camp being dominated by a
[28:30] holy ghost move
[28:32] they rebelled and wanted a set of rules
[28:34] and creeds to go by
[28:35] then they wanted a king
[28:37] then they wanted to be exactly like the
[28:39] world and went into complete apostasy
[28:41] and oblivion
[28:43] that is exactly how the first church age
[28:45] started and it will get worse and worse
[28:48] until the holy spirit is completely
[28:50] rejected and god must destroy the people
[28:54] see how it started out in the early
[28:55] church
[28:56] it was called deeds
[28:58] then it became a doctrine it became the
[29:00] standard
[29:01] it became the unbending way
[29:04] it finally took over and god was pushed
[29:06] aside
[29:07] oh it started so small so quietly so
[29:10] inoffensively it looked so good
[29:13] it seemed so sound
[29:15] then it caught a hold and like a python
[29:18] it squeezed out the very breath and
[29:19] killed all the spirituality there was in
[29:22] the church
[29:23] oh that false vine is subtle
[29:25] it is like an angel of light until it
[29:27] gets a hold on you
[29:29] now i want to say that i believe in
[29:31] leadership
[29:32] but it is not the leadership of men i
[29:34] believe in
[29:35] i believe in the leadership of the holy
[29:37] ghost coming through the word
[29:39] i believe also that god has said men in
[29:41] the church men who are gifted by the
[29:44] spirit
[29:45] and they will keep the church in order i
[29:47] believe that
[29:49] i believe also that the church is ruled
[29:51] over by men that god sends to take
[29:53] charge but that rule is by the word
[29:56] so that it is not men really ruling but
[29:58] the spirit of god
[30:00] for the word and spirit are one
[30:03] hebrews 13 7
[30:05] remember them which have the rule over
[30:07] you who have spoken unto you the word of
[30:09] god
[30:10] whose faith follow
[30:12] considering the end of their
[30:13] conversation
[30:16] but see what was happening back there
[30:18] that false vine was getting a hold and
[30:20] it was teaching that rulership by man
[30:22] was right
[30:23] it taught that the church had to be
[30:25] governed it taught a control over the
[30:27] people but instead of doing it god's way
[30:30] they simply took authority invested all
[30:32] the spiritual power in their own hands
[30:35] and came out with a holy priesthood
[30:36] standing between god and the people they
[30:39] went right back to the old aaronic
[30:40] system
[30:42] they became antichrist for they disposed
[30:44] of his mediatorship and imposed their
[30:46] own
[30:47] god hated that
[30:49] the ephesians hated that and any true
[30:51] believer will hate it too
[30:53] we would have to be stone blind not to
[30:55] see that same thing at work all through
[30:57] the ages and right now it is the worst
[31:00] of all
[31:01] what it was was organization
[31:03] that separated the people
[31:05] god's people are supposed to be one
[31:08] by one spirit are they all baptized into
[31:10] one body and everyone is to be moved
[31:13] upon by the holy ghost and everyone is
[31:15] to participate in the worship of god
[31:18] but men wanted the preeminence so they
[31:21] took over control and bishops became
[31:23] archbishops and with imposing titles
[31:25] they bypassed the word of god and taught
[31:27] their own doctrines
[31:29] they got the people to obey them until
[31:31] the time came that their way of worship
[31:33] did not in any way at all resemble the
[31:35] early days after pentecost
[31:38] these deeds were the beginning of
[31:39] apostolic succession
[31:41] from apostolic succession it was one
[31:43] easy and quick step to church membership
[31:45] as the means of saving grace
[31:48] the word was reduced to a creed
[31:50] antichrist by his spirit was
[31:52] predominating the church
[31:54] look at it today
[31:56] if you read acts 2 4 the way some do you
[31:59] could read it this way
[32:01] now when the day of pentecost was fully
[32:03] come there came a priest with the wafer
[32:05] and said stick out your tongue and he
[32:08] laid the wafer upon it and he himself
[32:10] drank some wine and said
[32:12] you have now received the holy ghost
[32:15] incredible
[32:16] that is exactly what nicolaitanism has
[32:18] come to
[32:19] they say
[32:20] never mind what god's word says you
[32:23] can't understand it we have to interpret
[32:25] it for you
[32:26] furthermore the bible is not finished it
[32:29] has to change with the times and we will
[32:31] tell you what the changes are
[32:33] how contrary that is to the word of god
[32:35] that emphatically states let god be true
[32:38] but every man a liar whenever there is a
[32:41] conflict with the truth heaven and earth
[32:43] will pass away but not one word of god
[32:46] will fail
[32:48] so the people are led by people who
[32:50] presume to be what they are not
[32:52] they say they are vicars of christ
[32:54] but what they are is antichrist
[32:57] here is another sad story
[33:01] [Music]
[33:29] you
