[39:55] remember our brother scott
[39:58] uh
[39:58] i had a few points to give but i'll give
[40:01] only two
[40:02] one uh
[40:05] brother scott was very approachable
[40:08] that's why i found it you found him to
[40:10] be uh there's a time i had questions
[40:13] i had something that
[40:15] i needed some advice on what was going
[40:17] on in the workplace
[40:19] so i
[40:22] uh i went to him
[40:24] asked him approached him asked him for
[40:27] an advice
[40:28] and the advice that he gave me
[40:31] really helped me to make a decision that
[40:33] was a sound decision a godly sounding
[40:35] decision on what i was doing so uh
[40:39] brother scott i'll put it on the next
[40:42] point too it's about hospitality
[40:45] he practiced
[40:47] hospitality
[40:49] i remember very well
[40:52] every time we'd come to evening service
[40:55] he would welcome us to his home
[40:57] with open homes
[41:00] it was a very good time we had one time
[41:02] i remember one time we had we slept over
[41:05] and then in the morning

[41:41] miss him
[41:42] uh in various front i know he has helped
[41:44] many people in different ways
[41:46] but for me the main two things that i
[41:49] remember for of him

[54:30] still be standing amen
[54:32] still have a mind to serve the lord
[54:35] to hear his word and to bless his name
[54:37] and to believe the message of the hour
[54:39] and to be together with believers and
[54:41] like precious faith

[55:41] and he was we're speaking about how that
[55:44] several folks we know recently have
[55:46] crossed over
[55:47] and i know it's a little bit more of a
[55:49] difficult time now for a family
[55:52] especially being around the holiday
[55:53] season and to think that
[55:55] the family member won't be there this
[55:58] year but there's one thing we have a
[55:59] confidence and a comfort this morning is
[56:02] is we're going to a place where they'll
[56:03] be
[56:04] and we'll be there and that's at the
[56:05] marriage supper of the lamb

[58:45] amen and amen the book of psalms the
[58:47] 37th chapter and the fourth verse
[58:51] i
[58:52] had a whole different thought on my
[58:54] heart this morning but the lord totally
[58:56] changed it last night so i'm just going
[58:58] to follow him if that's okay this
[59:00] morning
[59:01] psalms 37 and verse 4
[59:03] david here writing says delight thyself
[59:06] also
[59:07] in the lord
[59:08] and he shall give thee
[59:10] the desires of thine heart
[59:13] commit thy way unto the lord
[59:16] and trust also in him and he shall bring
[59:19] it to pass
[59:20] notice he's doing this it's not the
[59:22] person it's god
[59:24] he shall bring forth the righteousness
[59:26] as the lie in thy judgment as the
[59:28] noonday
[59:29] rest in the lord and wait patiently for
[59:31] him
[59:32] fret not thyself because of him who
[59:35] prospereth in his way
[59:37] because of the man who bringeth wicked
[59:40] devices to pass
[59:42] he says seeks from anger and forsake
[59:45] wrath and fret not thyself in any wise
[59:47] to do evil
[59:49] for evil doers shall be cut off but
[59:52] those that wait upon the lord they shall
[59:55] inherit
[59:57] the earth
[59:58] amen also i want to look with you in the
[1:00:00] book of luke
[1:00:01] the book of saint luke the 23rd chapter
[1:00:04] luke the 23rd chapter and if we could
[1:00:07] look there this morning in the 44th
[1:00:09] verse
[1:00:10] maybe i know it's a bit of a different
[1:00:12] uh scriptures to be putting together but
[1:00:15] if the lord would help us i've got a few
[1:00:17] things here out of this i'd like to
[1:00:18] share with you luke the 23rd chapter
[1:00:21] and the 44th verse
[1:00:24] the bible here speaking of christ
[1:00:26] crucifixion
[1:00:27] death burial and resurrection in the
[1:00:30] 44th verse he said
[1:00:32] and it was about the sixth hour
[1:00:34] and there was a darkness over all the
[1:00:37] earth until the ninth hour and the sun
[1:00:39] was darkened and the veil of the temple
[1:00:42] was rent in the midst
[1:00:44] and when jesus had cried with a loud
[1:00:47] voice notice what he said
[1:00:49] father
[1:00:51] into thy hands
[1:00:52] i commend
[1:00:54] my spirit
[1:00:55] in other words what he was saying father
[1:00:57] into thy hands i commit
[1:01:00] my spirit
[1:01:01] and having said thus
[1:01:03] he gave up the ghost
[1:01:05] amen we ask the lord this even this
[1:01:07] morning rather to add the blessing to
[1:01:08] the reading of his word as you can have
[1:01:10] your seats here this morning
[1:01:13] from those passages of scripture for
[1:01:15] just a few moments if the lord would
[1:01:17] help me today i want to talk to you here
[1:01:19] on the fault of into
[1:01:22] thy hands
[1:01:23] into thy hands i tell you this morning i
[1:01:26] am thankful that we have a place to put
[1:01:29] all of our problems to put all of our
[1:01:31] situations to put all of our
[1:01:33] circumstances and that is into the hands
[1:01:35] of almighty god and i find it amazing
[1:01:38] here in psalms 37 that david is speaking
[1:01:41] of ways and david will say it like this
[1:01:43] he says commit thy way unto the lord
[1:01:46] then he will speak of another way he
[1:01:48] says fret not thyself because of him who
[1:01:51] prospereth in his way now when you read
[1:01:54] psalms 37 you'll find that david is
[1:01:56] speaking amen of the happy state of the
[1:01:58] godly and the short-lived prosperity of
[1:02:01] the wicked so david is showing you amen
[1:02:04] that the godly are going to be in a
[1:02:06] happy state but the wicked are not going
[1:02:08] to prosper very long and david is
[1:02:10] actually he's admonishing the church
[1:02:12] they meant not to get all tore up or to
[1:02:15] get worried or get concerned about the
[1:02:18] wicked and their prosperous in their way
[1:02:20] now when you think of this word
[1:02:21] commitment it is the state amen or
[1:02:24] quality of being dedicated to a cause to
[1:02:27] an activity to a pledge or to an
[1:02:29] undertaking amen i think of how that the
[1:02:31] prophet of god will preach a message
[1:02:33] called god's provided way i want you to
[1:02:36] notice the title of that amen god's
[1:02:38] provided way he said now just for a few
[1:02:41] moments he said i just have been doing
[1:02:43] this is exalting christ i want to use
[1:02:46] the subject of this he meant god's
[1:02:48] provided way he said you know there's
[1:02:50] two ways for all things right he said
[1:02:53] you are aware of that that's your way
[1:02:55] and that's god's way how many is aware
[1:02:57] that there is our way and then there is
[1:02:59] god's way he said and you can't have
[1:03:01] your own way and be in god's way at the
[1:03:04] same time you have to get out of your
[1:03:06] own way amen and listen to this and let
[1:03:09] god have his way amen you've got to get
[1:03:12] out of your own way and let god have his
[1:03:15] way he said now you're either right or
[1:03:17] you're left right if you're going your
[1:03:19] way and i want you to hear this quote if
[1:03:21] you're going your way then you're out of
[1:03:23] god's way if you cease from your own way
[1:03:26] then you get in god's way god can have
[1:03:28] his way when you cease to have your
[1:03:30] weight but as long as you're having your
[1:03:32] way then god cannot have his way so you
[1:03:35] have to go one or the other ways amen so
[1:03:37] let's just drop our own way and let's
[1:03:40] let god have his way amen let's drop our
[1:03:44] own way and let's let god have his way
[1:03:47] another place he said in the in my story
[1:03:49] he said now there is a perfect way and
[1:03:51] there is a permissive way and i feel
[1:03:53] that if god here on the platform can
[1:03:55] show me things it is
[1:03:57] and in my rooms and so forth he is able
[1:04:00] to tell me just where he wants me and
[1:04:03] what he wants me to do but i feel as
[1:04:05] long as i've got it all hooked up or i
[1:04:07] feel like being he won't put his hands
[1:04:10] on it now watch this as long as i'm
[1:04:12] trying to work it out he won't put his
[1:04:14] hands on it as long as i'm doing it
[1:04:17] that's the way it is as long as you're
[1:04:19] going to do it if someone talks about
[1:04:21] you and you talk back about them he
[1:04:23] meant god cannot fight your battle
[1:04:25] you're fighting it yourself amen so
[1:04:28] let's just let loose and let him do it
[1:04:30] let's just commit it to him he said now
[1:04:33] listen this the greatest weapon i know
[1:04:36] of of a christian today is a committal
[1:04:39] to god he meant the greatest weapon i
[1:04:42] know of a christian today is a
[1:04:44] commitment to god when you can't do
[1:04:47] nothing about it you just commit it to
[1:04:49] him and god will take care of it amen i
[1:04:52] don't
[1:05:01] the greatest victory i received in the
[1:05:03] situation was when i come to the place
[1:05:12] but in divine hands i commend the
[1:05:15] situation amen i think it's a powerful
[1:05:17] thing this morning they met what about
[1:05:19] on this sunday morning we commit
[1:05:21] everything we are amen under god let's
[1:05:24] commit our families to god let's commit
[1:05:26] our church yeah let's commit our
[1:05:28] ministries let's commit everything
[1:05:30] in our families
[1:05:32] even he is the god that's able to take
[1:05:34] care of the situation
[1:05:36] he is the god that's able to move even
[1:05:39] my i think about that there are two ways
[1:05:41] there is a permissive way amen then
[1:05:43] there is a perfect way there is man's
[1:05:45] way and then there is god's way do you
[1:05:47] realize the fall in the card and amen
[1:05:49] actually took man out of god's way amen
[1:05:52] and brought him into his own way he
[1:05:54] meant before the fall in the garden adam
[1:05:56] and eve was operating and doing things
[1:05:59] god's way but after the fall and then
[1:06:02] they began to do things man's way amen
[1:06:04] look here in john the 10th chapter and
[1:06:06] the first verse jesus says verily verily
[1:06:08] i say unto you amen he that entereth not
[1:06:11] by the door into the sheepfold now watch
[1:06:13] this but climbeth up amen some other way
[1:06:16] the same is a thief and a robber the
[1:06:19] prophet said he'd come up man's way he
[1:06:20] come up some way he came the church's
[1:06:23] way or some other way amen but god has a
[1:06:26] way provided and that way is jesus and
[1:06:29] when you come by jesus you take on jesus
[1:06:31] by a spiritual baptism and you are dead
[1:06:34] and take on christ by the new birth and
[1:06:36] you're born again and filled with his
[1:06:38] spirit amen and how you know because the
[1:06:41] life amen your life will compare with
[1:06:44] foes of the bible ain't been the
[1:06:45] apostles who was robbed in his
[1:06:47] righteousness amen then why can't amen
[1:06:50] people who claim to be christians
[1:06:52] believe in signs and wonders and divine
[1:06:54] healing and the working of the holy
[1:06:56] ghost amen why they should do it the
[1:06:59] thing of it is amen they've come in some
[1:07:01] other way besides the door hey if they
[1:07:04] come through the door hear this now they
[1:07:06] would be robed with the same kind of
[1:07:08] spirit they would have the same kind of
[1:07:10] life they would have the same kind of
[1:07:12] testimony they would be the same kind of
[1:07:14] people and then see that other words if
[1:07:17] you come in the message other than the
[1:07:19] way of the door and then you're not
[1:07:21] going to believe in the things that the
[1:07:22] message teaches amen if you come in the
[1:07:24] message by a man's way amen the message
[1:07:27] is going to be just another idea it's
[1:07:29] going to be just another biblical
[1:07:31] approach amendment if you come in this
[1:07:33] message
[1:07:34] it'll be the absolute church it'll be
[1:07:36] the direction of god it'll be the answer
[1:07:39] to the question it'll be the tearing
[1:07:41] down amen of every stronghold amen will
[1:07:44] be the message of the hour amen i think
[1:07:46] it's amazing the prophet tells us that
[1:07:48] god amen hasn't provided somebody shout
[1:07:51] provided provide
[1:07:52] god has a provided amen meant an
[1:07:55] original way to do things and he'll
[1:07:57] never do it contrary to that amen do you
[1:08:00] realize the fall in the garden caused
[1:08:02] man to come out of god's way and go into
[1:08:04] his own way and a prophet will preach an
[1:08:06] entire sermon called the way back amen
[1:08:09] listen that the way back amen not a way
[1:08:12] leaving there to be many ways but he
[1:08:14] preaches the way back and says there's
[1:08:17] many ways out amen but there's only one
[1:08:20] way back he meant there's many ways out
[1:08:22] of the will of god but there's only one
[1:08:24] way back in the way of god there's many
[1:08:26] ways out of fellowship with god but
[1:08:28] there's only one way back in fellowship
[1:08:30] with god there's many ways out of the
[1:08:32] blessings of god but there's only one
[1:08:34] way back to the blessings of god and to
[1:08:37] thank today friends on this thanksgiving
[1:08:39] service we've got something to be
[1:08:41] thankful for they've been that while the
[1:08:43] world is looking for a way back into the
[1:08:46] anointing into the supernatural into the
[1:08:48] blessings of god into the things of god
[1:08:50] amen
[1:09:05] back amen the way found us
[1:09:09] into the place of blessing listen you're
[1:09:11] not sitting outside the essence of god
[1:09:13] you're sitting in the middle of the
[1:09:15] blessings of god this morning by the
[1:09:17] message of the hour by the restoration
[1:09:20] of the way of god my baby when i think
[1:09:22] about this i rejoice amen to tell you
[1:09:25] this morning we are not a people of a
[1:09:28] partial restoration amen we are the
[1:09:30] generation promised a full restoration

[1:09:38] rejoice
[1:09:39] in the lord your god for he hath given
[1:09:42] you the former rain martyr and he will

[1:09:57] all amen and i will restore somebody

[1:10:05] locusts have eaten and the cankerworm
[1:10:08] and the caterpillar and the pomegranate
[1:10:10] my great army which i sent among you and
[1:10:12] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[1:10:15] and praise the name of the lord your god
[1:10:18] who it dealt wonderfully with you and my
[1:10:20] people shall never be ashamed in other
[1:10:23] words prophesying that everything the
[1:10:26] devil has taken from the church god
[1:10:28] would send a ministry that would be the
[1:10:31] torah
[1:10:32] and the latter ever that would be a
[1:10:34] teaching
[1:10:35] it would be a harvest reign it would
[1:10:37] bring the bringing of the restoration of
[1:10:39] the things the devil had taken from the
[1:10:41] church amen what did he say he said i
[1:10:44] will restore amen i will restore look it
[1:10:47] with this word restore it means to
[1:10:49] return to the former owner it means to
[1:10:52] bring back to the former state or
[1:10:53] condition do you realize that god said
[1:10:56] in malachi 4 amen i will restore behold
[1:11:00] i send them to you elijah the prophet
[1:11:02] and he shall what shall turn or shall
[1:11:04] restore your hearts to the faith of the
[1:11:07] apostolic cause
[1:11:09] in the message the uniting time inside
[1:11:12] he says restore back the original the
[1:11:14] pentecostal faith back to the people
[1:11:17] with the same pentecostal message with
[1:11:19] the same sign the same pentecostal
[1:11:21] evidence the same god the same power the
[1:11:24] same teaching everything with the
[1:11:27] vindication of the same pillar of fire
[1:11:29] that struck paul down on the road he
[1:11:32] went down to damascus listen this is
[1:11:34] among us today doing the same things he
[1:11:37] did it that day
[1:11:41] amen the same message the same sign the
[1:11:44] same evidence the same power the same
[1:11:46] teaching with the same pillar of fire
[1:11:49] they've been doing the same thing today
[1:11:51] that he was doing back then amen i've
[1:11:54] often heard people say brother andrew
[1:11:56] i've heard brother adam say we need a
[1:11:57] burning bush experience or he'll say we
[1:12:00] need another ax2 experience or we need
[1:12:02] another ax4 experience or we need
[1:12:04] another damascus road experience and
[1:12:06] they'll say how in the world can we have

[1:12:10] experience when we're not at the burning
[1:12:12] bush amen how can we have a damascus
[1:12:14] road experience when we are not on the
[1:12:16] damascus road how can we have an axe to
[1:12:18] experience when we're not gathered in
[1:12:20] the upper room in the book of acts amen
[1:12:22] but can i tell you amen the reason why a
[1:12:24] prophet said we needed that amen was not
[1:12:27] because of the place it was because of
[1:12:29] the person that was at the place it
[1:12:31] wasn't the burning bliss that changed
[1:12:33] moses it was
[1:12:37] it wasn't the damascus road that changed
[1:12:39] paul it was the pillar of fire that was
[1:12:42] on the damascus road that changed paul
[1:12:44] it wasn't the upper room that changed
[1:12:46] him it was the pillar of fire that
[1:12:48] descended into the upper room amen that
[1:12:51] changed them from being cowards into
[1:12:53] being courageous sons and daughters of
[1:12:55] god and right here this morning in
[1:12:57] minneapolis minnesota amen the same
[1:13:00] pillar of fire that was on the damascus
[1:13:02] road that was home to burning bush that
[1:13:05] was in the upper room has returned
[1:13:08] super tellership church
[1:13:10] meant to bring a transformation to
[1:13:12] release a restoration to anoint a young
[1:13:15] person to anoint a believer amen to
[1:13:18] believe we have come back under god's
[1:13:20] way of doing things in the aids that
[1:13:23] we're living in
[1:13:24] oh my that pillar of power is coming

[1:13:29] word
[1:13:30] pray
[1:13:31] to unite the church amen to the word the
[1:13:34] promise that we see the nations uniting
[1:13:36] we see the world uniting we see the
[1:13:38] churches uniting we see the bride
[1:13:41] uniting with the word amen why the word
[1:13:44] is god
[1:13:45] he meant the word his god as the
[1:13:47] bridegroom being the word and the bride
[1:13:50] being the hearer of the word they come
[1:13:52] together in a union they unite like a
[1:13:54] wedding see they're getting ready for a
[1:13:57] wedding they become one the word
[1:14:00] becomes you are you hearing me now the
[1:14:02] word becomes you and you become the word
[1:14:06] that's why jesus said oh that the father
[1:14:09] is i am and all i am you are and all you
[1:14:12] are i am and in that day you'll know
[1:14:15] that i am in the father and the father
[1:14:17] is in me and i you and you and me he
[1:14:20] said see at that day what day this day
[1:14:24] we've been looking for the day that that
[1:14:26] scripture would be fulfilled and a
[1:14:28] prophet comes along and says you're
[1:14:30] putting it in the future it's not a
[1:14:32] future day coming it's the day you're
[1:14:35] living in old church of the living god
[1:14:37] you're not going to live in a day when
[1:14:39] the word is united with humanity you are
[1:14:42] living in the day when the word has
[1:14:44] united with humanity once again the same
[1:14:47] logos a man that anointed a party and
[1:14:50] manifested john 1 14 is the same logos
[1:14:54] and is manifested itself in this age in
[1:14:57] a many-membered body called the bride he
[1:15:00] said what day
[1:15:02] amen this day
[1:15:03] see we find out the great hidden
[1:15:05] mysteries of god being revealed in other
[1:15:08] words amen the revelation of the hidden
[1:15:11] mysteries amen will restore the church
[1:15:14] the revelation of the hidden mysteries
[1:15:17] will restore the church to the former or
[1:15:20] to the to the original condition to the
[1:15:22] pentecostal message with the pentecostal
[1:15:24] faith with the pentecostal sign where
[1:15:27] the pentecostal evidence the true
[1:15:29] revelation will restore the church and
[1:15:33] then now when you begin to look at
[1:15:34] restoration you know the prophet
[1:15:36] preaches a message called the
[1:15:37] restoration
[1:15:39] of the bride tree and in there he will
[1:15:41] say amen that there is a law of
[1:15:44] restoration he said like if somebody
[1:15:46] stole some property and they're holding
[1:15:48] that property captive amen then you can
[1:15:51] take the law and go to this person and
[1:15:54] the law forces now watch this amen who
[1:15:56] does this the law forces amen or
[1:15:59] enforces this person to restore the
[1:16:01] property back to its natural owner to
[1:16:04] its first estate he said see it is
[1:16:07] enforcement amen watch this what a
[1:16:09] privilege then it is amen to the pride
[1:16:11] of jesus christ to be able to enforce
[1:16:14] amen restoration claims amen do you
[1:16:17] realize that you are amen in the
[1:16:19] beginning you was in the mind of god
[1:16:21] amen before the fall i heard him say
[1:16:22] this morning he said before the
[1:16:24] foundations of the world was laid he
[1:16:27] said god had already called you he had
[1:16:29] already chose you he already elected you
[1:16:32] to live in the age that you're living in
[1:16:35] amen see then the law of the spirit of
[1:16:37] god amen is to enforce amen restoration
[1:16:41] claims amen genesis 1 27 the bible said
[1:16:44] that god had been created man in his own
[1:16:46] image in the image of god created he him
[1:16:50] amen male and female created he them now
[1:16:53] i want you to catch a word there it is
[1:16:55] the word create it amen in the beginning
[1:16:57] god created amen in the beginning god
[1:17:00] created the heavens and the earth
[1:17:01] genesis 1 27 god created man he created
[1:17:04] man in his own image he created male and
[1:17:06] female created he them the prophet said
[1:17:09] the law of the spirit of god is to force
[1:17:11] satan amen to give up that which he is
[1:17:15] unrightfully and deceitfully taken from
[1:17:17] god amen the souls of men he took from
[1:17:20] god the souls of women amen children
[1:17:23] sickness of the body he placed upon the
[1:17:25] people where god made man in his image
[1:17:28] to be like him amen the church somebody
[1:17:31] shot the church and if the church is
[1:17:33] given the rightful legal right and then
[1:17:36] by the bible to take the holy spirit and
[1:17:39] enforce them upon them amen you have
[1:17:42] been given the legal rights by
[1:17:45] redemption to enforce the claims of
[1:17:48] restoration upon whatever the devil has
[1:17:51] stole from the church amen i don't know
[1:17:53] if you all heard this term or not amen
[1:17:55] there's actually a term called on the
[1:17:57] right side of the law amen do you
[1:17:59] realize there's the right side of the
[1:18:01] law and there is the wrong side of the
[1:18:03] law
[1:18:04] do you realize people live their whole
[1:18:06] lives on the wrong side of the law
[1:18:08] they're always fearing the law
[1:18:10] they're always fearing amen they've done
[1:18:13] something wrong or they stole something
[1:18:14] amen and they're always fearing that
[1:18:16] it's going to catch up with them they're
[1:18:18] living on the wrong side of the law amen
[1:18:20] but when you move to the right side of
[1:18:22] the law amen that means amen that
[1:18:24] someone is not living the life of a
[1:18:26] criminal and then they're not they're
[1:18:28] not living as a criminal they're not
[1:18:29] acting as a criminal they've been
[1:18:31] they've been moved to the right side of
[1:18:33] the law amen and for years he'd been the
[1:18:35] church of the living god amen was living
[1:18:38] as a bunch of people who didn't know
[1:18:40] their rights they didn't know where they
[1:18:41] come from they didn't know if they had
[1:18:43] the power to cast out therefore they
[1:18:45] didn't know if they had the power to
[1:18:46] speak to storms they didn't know if they
[1:18:48] had the power to pray for the sick and
[1:18:50] they would recover amen but god would
[1:18:52] send a message of restoration that would
[1:18:55] take the church amen from the wrong side
[1:18:57] of the law to the right side of the law
[1:18:59] amen not with the law against them amen
[1:19:02] but the law for them amen in other words
[1:19:05] amen to fall in the garden put us on the
[1:19:08] wrong side of the law he meant before
[1:19:10] the fall man had dominion over every
[1:19:12] creeping thing over ever fell in the air
[1:19:15] amen he had
[1:19:16] he had dominion over nature amen but
[1:19:18] after the fall amen
[1:19:20] nature had dominion over him and he was
[1:19:23] afraid of every creeping thing and he
[1:19:25] ran from everything amen but the bible
[1:19:27] says amen i will restore unto you amen
[1:19:31] he will restore unto the church amen the
[1:19:34] power that the devil took through the
[1:19:36] fall
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:38] well lord according to truth anyhow amen
[1:19:41] in other words amen before the fall in
[1:19:43] the garden you was on the right side of
[1:19:45] the law you was on the side of faith he
[1:19:48] was on the side of belief he was on the
[1:19:50] side of righteousness he was on the side
[1:19:52] of holiness he was on the side of purity
[1:19:55] he'd been through the fall of god and he
[1:19:57] moved man to the wrong side of the law
[1:19:59] and put him on the law on the side of
[1:20:01] law of science the father said but lord
[1:20:04] after you raised from the dead 1900
[1:20:06] years ago and there you made a promise
[1:20:09] that we would see you in the last days

[1:20:34] was it was the message of restoration to
[1:20:37] take the church amen from the side of

[1:21:58] law that's in him he can sink plum to
[1:22:00] the bottom of the sea and it won't
[1:22:02] bother him a bit it won't break oneself

[1:22:43] law is not in you amen the law is not in
[1:22:46] you to go the bottom and come back up
[1:22:48] amen but it is in the fish to go the
[1:22:50] bottom of the sea and to rise back to
[1:22:52] the top well let's not leave it there
[1:22:55] amen the prophet said and there is a law
[1:22:57] that was in christ and that law is in
[1:23:00] you

[1:23:03] he said you can bear him in the deepest
[1:23:06] grave or the deepest sea or the lowest
[1:23:08] tail but there is a law of the spirit of
[1:23:11] god that will raise him back up again

[1:23:26] through and they're not serving god
[1:23:28] today you go to school with people who
[1:23:30] face the same situations that you faced
[1:23:33] in your life amen but they're not in the
[1:23:35] house of god on sunday morning with
[1:23:37] their hands raised i'll tell you why
[1:23:39] it's because for all that's in you is
[1:23:41] not in them but the law that is in you

[1:24:39] against science amen notice this they
[1:24:42] claim that it's earthbound evergreen
[1:24:44] gravitation has to hold it here but it
[1:24:47] can defy gravitation it can lift itself
[1:24:50] right off of it and go right on amen

[1:28:56] so you call the law and the law comes to
[1:28:58] your house and the law says who does it
[1:29:00] and you say them people cross the street
[1:29:02] down it they said what did they do you
[1:29:04] tell them they broke in the wind and
[1:29:05] they broke in the front door they stole
[1:29:07] this that and the other amen you give
[1:29:08] them your report you tell them
[1:29:10] everything that's been done and when you
[1:29:12] get done talking you know what they say
[1:29:14] they'll say we'll take it from here you
[1:29:16] know what you've just done you just
[1:29:18] committed the entire situation into the
[1:29:20] hands of the law to let them take
[1:29:22] control of the situation well come on
[1:29:24] church amen and god has come down this
[1:29:26] morning they meant to take control of
[1:29:29] the situations of our lives and that we
[1:29:31] can talk about it we can cry about it or
[1:29:34] we can let go and let god have his way
[1:29:37] in the situation the prophet said you
[1:29:39] keep fighting at it and it won't never
[1:29:41] work when you let go and let god he can
[1:29:45] go to work that's all and then you
[1:29:48] operate the law you should matter how do
[1:29:49] i operate the law you operate the law
[1:29:52] by letting go and letting god the fish
[1:29:55] don't try to work it out the lord put a
[1:29:57] law in him he lets go and the law that's
[1:30:00] in him takes him to the bottom and the
[1:30:02] same law that takes him to the bottom is
[1:30:05] the same law that brings him to the top
[1:30:07] even the bird don't try to take off
[1:30:09] running and get enough speed to lift
[1:30:10] himself off the ground and then the law
[1:30:13] that's hit him by god he lets go and he
[1:30:15] lets the wind of the air take a hold of
[1:30:18] his wings and lift him into the heavens
[1:30:20] and come on sons and daughters of god
[1:30:22] you've been trying to work it out you've
[1:30:24] been trying to figure it out amen but
[1:30:26] god this morning is saying let go and
[1:30:29] let the law that's on the inside of you
[1:30:32] amen lift you into heavenly places
[1:30:36] but probably said see it's the same way
[1:30:38] with us we fight and we pull and we
[1:30:41] hurry and oh if i don't get pissed if i
[1:30:43] don't get past that's not it it's to
[1:30:46] know that the law of life is in you and
[1:30:49] you just let go and let god amen see you
[1:30:52] just let go somebody say let go
[1:30:55] come on help me let go
[1:30:57] and let god see he said let go and let
[1:30:59] god he said now watch when you let go
[1:31:02] and you let god then he takes you to the
[1:31:05] baptism of the spirit he takes you to
[1:31:07] your healing or anything that he's
[1:31:09] promised any claim that he's given amen
[1:31:12] is yours by letting go and letting god
[1:31:15] you say andrew is a human i've got to do
[1:31:18] something well let me tell you what
[1:31:19] james said if you really want to do
[1:31:21] something let me say this there's
[1:31:23] nothing you can do to help god in your
[1:31:25] situation a prophet said you've got to
[1:31:27] let go and let god but if you really
[1:31:30] really want something to do let me tell
[1:31:32] you what you can do you can resist the
[1:31:34] devil and he will flee from you and then
[1:31:37] while you're waiting on your answer from
[1:31:39] god when you've committed it to god and
[1:31:42] the devil comes along and says he didn't
[1:31:44] hear your prayer and he's not going to
[1:31:45] answer your petition amen there is an
[1:31:47] anointing upon you he meant to resist
[1:31:50] that lying dead amen and say devil i
[1:31:53] resist you in the name of jesus christ

[1:36:39] and slay him and abraham obeyed god and
[1:36:42] went up on the mountain and when he got
[1:36:44] up there he had a knife in his hand now
[1:36:46] now i just have to be honest with you
[1:36:48] amen isaac was old enough to know the
[1:36:49] order of worship
[1:36:52] he had been up on the mountain too many
[1:36:53] times and he had seen the order of
[1:36:55] worship or y'all hear me this morning he
[1:36:58] went up on the mountain and when he got
[1:37:00] up there and then he laid
[1:37:02] isaac down on the altar and isaac knew
[1:37:05] there was no sacrifice that came with
[1:37:07] him to church that morning amen i wonder
[1:37:10] sometimes brother i've often wondered
[1:37:12] when did it strike isaac's mind you are
[1:37:14] the sacrifice
[1:37:15] when did it come into isaac's heart i'm
[1:37:17] the one that he's going to sacrifice but
[1:37:19] before he left in the back of isaac's
[1:37:22] mind he was rehearsing the words of his
[1:37:24] father i and my lad will go yonder in
[1:37:27] worship but we will return unto you in
[1:37:30] other words abraham said i don't know
[1:37:32] what's going to happen but the god who
[1:37:35] told me to take him up on the mountain
[1:37:37] is a creator he is a resurrector he is a
[1:37:40] life-giver he is a problem changer
[1:37:44] he is the answer to our question and
[1:37:46] abraham obey god he committed his soul
[1:37:48] unto god and he walked upon the mountain
[1:37:51] you don't think abraham suffered he was
[1:37:53] suffering according to the will of god
[1:37:55] and he walked isaac up on the mountain
[1:37:57] and he got isaac up there and just about
[1:38:00] the time he went to take isaac's life he
[1:38:03] heard a noise behind him and he looked
[1:38:05] around and there was a ram that was
[1:38:08] caught in the picket the prophet said it
[1:38:10] was not a vision he said because he
[1:38:12] killed the ram and the ram blade he said
[1:38:15] what happened was the creator created a
[1:38:19] ram for abraham in his time of need
[1:38:24] oh god church amen listen friends right

[1:40:16] was the power going to come amen to
[1:40:18] break the strongholds of rebellion over
[1:40:21] those two boys brother branham wasn't
[1:40:23] going to figure it out you know why he
[1:40:24] meant because the creator was on his
[1:40:27] side the creator was at his side and
[1:40:30] right there in the face of impossibility
[1:40:32] he looked at those two boys or looked at
[1:40:35] hattie rather and he said hattie i give
[1:40:37] you those two boys what are you saying
[1:40:39] preacher amen brother branham didn't go
[1:40:41] over there and lay a desire in their

[1:40:47] hands on them what happened i'll tell
[1:40:48] you what happened the creator who
[1:40:51] created a ram for isaac abraham
[1:40:57] [Applause]
[1:40:59] is in this church
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:24] [Applause]
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:42] under god
[1:41:43] as the faithful
[1:41:45] creator
[1:41:46] amen how many has ever heard of a
[1:41:48] brother named brother joe green he
[1:41:49] pastors a church down to rutherford to
[1:41:51] north carolina hosted many missionary
[1:41:53] camp meetings but joel greene made a
[1:41:55] statement one time i never forget it he
[1:41:57] said it like this he said martin luther
[1:41:58] said one time he said i've healed many
[1:42:00] things in my hands and i've lost them
[1:42:03] all
[1:42:04] but whatever i've placed in god's hands
[1:42:06] that i still possess
[1:42:12] everything these hands have held i've
[1:42:15] washed it all
[1:42:16] but everything i've taken out of my head
[1:42:19] and placed into god's hands i still
[1:42:22] possess yes
[1:42:25] then do you realize whose hands you're
[1:42:26] placing it in your place in hand that
[1:42:30] has your name engraved in the palms of
[1:42:33] them john 10 27 my sheep hear my voice
[1:42:36] and the voice is the word and i know
[1:42:38] them and they follow me the prophet said
[1:42:40] in other words they will not understand
[1:42:42] the theological voice that's teaching
[1:42:45] contrary to the word in verse 28 i give
[1:42:48] unto them eternal life and they shall
[1:42:50] never perish neither shall any man pluck
[1:42:52] them out of my hands my father which
[1:42:55] gave them me is greater than all right
[1:42:58] and no man is able to plug this
[1:43:00] out of my father's hand you know what
[1:43:02] that word pluck means it means to claim
[1:43:05] for oneself eagerly in other words jesus
[1:43:08] christ himself said amen there's no
[1:43:10] devil gonna be able to lay a claim upon
[1:43:13] my children and fulfill that claim
[1:43:16] because the reason i can enforce
[1:43:18] redemption claim is because the abstract
[1:43:21] was put in my hand with a nail at
[1:43:23] calvary and there ain't no dead hor amen
[1:43:26] can take away my sons and bones
[1:43:29] [Applause]
[1:43:30] my father gave them unto me you realize
[1:43:32] revelation 1 20 the bible says there is
[1:43:35] a mystery of seven stars which thou saw
[1:43:38] swear in my right hand and the seven
[1:43:40] golden candlesticks the seven stars are
[1:43:43] the angels of the seven churches and the
[1:43:46] seven candlesticks which thou saw and
[1:43:47] start the seven church ages now watch
[1:43:49] this for the seven churches now do you
[1:43:51] realize in his right hand amen was that
[1:43:53] candlestick which was seven angel
[1:43:55] messengers which we know to be paul
[1:43:57] martin columbus amen are you hearing me
[1:43:59] now all those seven aged messengers amen
[1:44:02] was in the hand of god now you say but
[1:44:04] andrew no wonder they can make it
[1:44:06] because they was held in the right hand
[1:44:08] of god which was a symbol denoting his
[1:44:11] authority but the prophet said not only
[1:44:13] can we speak flesh for the messengers
[1:44:15] but every true believer how many true
[1:44:17] believers shall we god here but every
[1:44:19] true believer is dramatically depicted
[1:44:22] here they are all drawing from the same
[1:44:24] source they have all been dipped in the
[1:44:26] same bowl they are dead themselves and
[1:44:29] their lives are here with christ in god
[1:44:31] they are sealed in by the holy ghost no
[1:44:34] man can pluck them out of his hand their
[1:44:36] lives cannot be tampered with the
[1:44:38] visible life is burning and shining
[1:44:41] giving light and manifestations of the
[1:44:43] holy ghost the inner invisible life is
[1:44:46] hidden in god and fed by the lord's word
[1:44:48] satan oh hear me now satan cannot touch
[1:44:52] them
[1:44:55] satan cannot touch them not even death
[1:44:58] can touch them for death has lost its
[1:45:01] sting the grave has lost its victory and
[1:45:04] thanks be to god they have this victory
[1:45:07] through our lord jesus christ amen in
[1:45:09] other words he's saying there's a group
[1:45:11] of people coming up on the earth who no
[1:45:14] matter what you put them through they're
[1:45:16] not going to become lukewarm by the
[1:45:18] trials they're going through
[1:45:20] yeah can i have some liberty here no
[1:45:22] matter what you put this blind through
[1:45:24] she will not become lukewarm you can put
[1:45:27] her through a sudden death i'm a church
[1:45:29] member but she'll still praise god you
[1:45:32] can put her through a bad damage but
[1:45:33] you'll still praise god you can put them
[1:45:36] through political disturbances
[1:45:40] but they'll still praise god are y'all
[1:45:42] hearing me let's let the devil know this
[1:45:44] morning satan you don't have enough amen
[1:45:47] to cause me to become lukewarm
[1:45:53] what are you saying i'm saying i'll
[1:45:54] serve him when the church is on fire
[1:45:56] we'll serve him when the church is cold
[1:45:58] we'll serve him when the bank is full
[1:46:00] we'll serve him when the bank is empty
[1:46:02] we'll serve him in the basement when the
[1:46:03] bills are paid we'll survey when the
[1:46:05] bills are moved
[1:46:07] there's something about this bride she
[1:46:09] has been restored to the right side of
[1:46:12] the law and there's nothing the devil
[1:46:14] can do he meant to turn her off of her
[1:46:17] convictions
[1:46:19] are you hearing me somebody shot a man
[1:46:21] and then the bible says because they
[1:46:23] aren't lukewarm amen look what this what
[1:46:25] means it's the condition of the soul
[1:46:28] amen which is ritually fluctuating amen
[1:46:31] between a sluggish and a fervor of love
[1:46:34] amen in other words this lay out a sin
[1:46:35] church age whatever they go through
[1:46:37] changes their temperature of their love
[1:46:40] towards god brother thank you for the
[1:46:42] randoms for coming along and clarifying
[1:46:44] to the church amen that the signs of
[1:46:46] god's approval is not in sunny skies and
[1:46:49] the signs of god's disapproval it's not
[1:46:51] in cloudy skies hey are y'all hearing me
[1:46:54] amen i i we woke up this morning i woke
[1:46:56] up and i looked out the window and the
[1:46:59] sun was shining man it was bright i mean
[1:47:01] it was bright sun it was a beautiful
[1:47:03] sunrise amen bro one it wasn't a few
[1:47:05] minutes and the clouds covered the sun
[1:47:07] and the bright sun went away in the
[1:47:09] clouds covering the sky and brother
[1:47:10] brother something down in my heart amen
[1:47:13] just said thank god i conditioned a
[1:47:15] servant god ain't like that but if i
[1:47:17] woke up on sunday morning and the sun
[1:47:19] would shine i was going to church but
[1:47:21] watch how quick the conditions change in
[1:47:23] a few minutes the cloud rolled in
[1:47:25] amendment if there was clouds or sun or
[1:47:28] rain or snow i was still going to the
[1:47:31] house of god even because nature doesn't
[1:47:34] control
[1:47:45] who is controlled by the things of god
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:57] but i'll get back up
[1:48:00] [Music]
[1:48:05] [Applause]
[1:48:09] he said see furthermore if we'll just
[1:48:11] keep the word in mind you will recall
[1:48:14] that nowhere does it say we are in the
[1:48:15] mouth of god
[1:48:17] we are engraved
[1:48:19] we're
[1:48:20] in his palms
[1:48:22] we are carried in his bosom
[1:48:24] way back in the unknown ages
[1:48:28] are y'all hear me now
[1:48:30] before time we were in his mind
[1:48:34] we are in his sheet forth amen in his
[1:48:37] pastures
[1:48:38] but never in his mouth
[1:48:41] see that is what's wrong with the people
[1:48:43] last day they have gotten away from the
[1:48:45] word and they are no longer fervent
[1:48:47] about it
[1:48:48] they are lukewarm about it
[1:48:50] see in other words they will not
[1:48:52] overcome how many knows that each age
[1:48:55] had conditions that had to be overcome
[1:48:57] that's right
[1:48:58] amen the ephesian age that thy tyranny
[1:49:02] all the ages had conditions even up to
[1:49:05] the leona sin age there was a condition
[1:49:07] had to be overcome and i know i touched
[1:49:09] a little bit last night but i want to
[1:49:10] labor here for a second it was the
[1:49:12] condition of being lukewarm
[1:49:14] now do you realize that each church age
[1:49:16] had overcomers no matter how bad
[1:49:19] the penalty was no matter how dark the
[1:49:22] thing of sin was in that age there were
[1:49:24] still people who was elected to overcome
[1:49:27] the election they changed was the
[1:49:28] overcomers of the age by receiving the
[1:49:31] word for the age they overcome the
[1:49:34] conditions of the age by receiving the
[1:49:36] word promise for the age you realize
[1:49:38] that only the elected of the of the age
[1:49:41] in laodicea will overcome the
[1:49:43] lukewarmness of this age paul says this
[1:49:46] and breaking in romans 9 11 that the
[1:49:48] purpose of god according to election
[1:49:51] might stand in first thessalonians 1 4
[1:49:54] it says no one brethren beloved amen

[2:03:02] everybody to death at work
[2:03:04] this purpose took form through election
[2:03:07] that is why he could look right down to
[2:03:10] the last stage when all would be over
[2:03:13] and see himself still in the midst of
[2:03:16] the church as the author of the creation
[2:03:19] of god
[2:03:22] no
[2:03:22] no let me let me try to make sense of
[2:03:24] this if i can he's sitting there we'll
[2:03:26] say in ephesus and he's looking all the
[2:03:28] way over to leonisia and when he looks
[2:03:31] at laodicea he sees himself
[2:03:37] he looks all the way into the dark stage
[2:03:39] of seven ages and sees himself and says
[2:03:43] that he that overcomes will i grant to
[2:03:46] sit with me in my throne as i sit with
[2:03:49] my father in his throne and sends a
[2:03:51] prophet to preach a message how can i
[2:03:54] overcome i'm on church i'm closer now
[2:03:57] god was not worried about having
[2:03:59] overcomers
[2:04:02] the creator created himself a bride my
[2:04:06] old church brings about melchizedek
[2:04:08] let's talk about this
[2:04:10] he came down and created a body and
[2:04:13] stepped into that body and met abraham
[2:04:16] and served his victorious child amen
[2:04:19] communion after the battle in the
[2:04:21] laodicean church age a prophet comes and
[2:04:24] preaches a message who is this
[2:04:26] melchizedek in other words in the
[2:04:29] darkest of seven ages melchizedek has
[2:04:32] returned into his bride the creator has
[2:04:36] returned to his creation
[2:04:39] right
[2:04:40] and it's not you getting to leona see
[2:04:42] you it's the creator himself in you
[2:04:46] that's getting you
[2:04:47] through lay out a seat
[2:04:53] when you come up against something
[2:04:55] and you don't how you're going to get
[2:04:56] through it
[2:05:02] that's why the father said we don't know
[2:05:03] the word retreat
[2:05:06] because the creator don't retreat
[2:05:09] the creator
[2:05:10] create
[2:05:12] the creator don't retreat
[2:05:14] the creator
[2:05:16] creates
[2:05:18] do you realize today in closing we're
[2:05:20] sailing in the ship
[2:05:23] the problem god said one time
[2:05:25] he said the disciples have been over in
[2:05:26] a meeting with jesus
[2:05:28] and he said after the meeting was over
[2:05:30] he said jesus got on the ship and he
[2:05:32] went back in the back of the boat you
[2:05:33] all heard the story
[2:05:34] goes back there and he says he lays down
[2:05:36] to take a little rest and he said the
[2:05:37] disciples
[2:05:38] brother they they push off the shore
[2:05:41] for the arrow he says and they're so
[2:05:43] excited about what they've just seen
[2:05:44] done
[2:05:46] he says they begin to testify
[2:05:48] he said i could hear andrew say
[2:05:50] what about it when he talked to the
[2:05:52] woman at the well
[2:05:54] he said i can hear i can hear phillip
[2:05:55] and the thing that began to talk about
[2:05:57] when he come down there and called him
[2:05:58] by name in john 1.
[2:06:00] he said they're all excited he said and
[2:06:02] all of a sudden while they're sailing
[2:06:03] across the across the waters he said
[2:06:06] having a testimony meeting on the sea he
[2:06:08] said one one brother spoke up he said i
[2:06:10] believe it was young john spoke up and
[2:06:13] young john said oh brothers
[2:06:15] said what was it like when we stood
[2:06:17] there that day and we saw a little boy
[2:06:19] who had skipped school
[2:06:23] come over by the meeting
[2:06:25] and 5 000 people standing there
[2:06:28] and jesus said he was going to feed him
[2:06:30] and he didn't have no food
[2:06:32] oh god
[2:06:33] and the young boy come over there and
[2:06:35] gave jesus his little lunch of two fish
[2:06:38] and five loaves of bread
[2:06:40] and young john said do you remember when
[2:06:42] he stood there and he took that in his
[2:06:43] hands he said do you remember the
[2:06:45] feeling you had when you saw him take
[2:06:47] that little bit and multiply it and feed
[2:06:50] 5000 men and their wives and their
[2:06:52] children
[2:06:53] oh god and brother i'm saying here with

[2:15:14] brother graham said he said if the
[2:15:16] creator is in your body
[2:15:17] he said then that cancer was not created
[2:15:19] in your body he said that cancer is a
[2:15:21] trespasser on your body that's right he

[2:15:30] he'll use your voice to speak to that
[2:15:32] cancer and say cancer dry up in the name
[2:15:35] of jesus christ
[2:15:36] and it's these are the words he used he
[2:15:38] said the cancer case will have to
[2:15:40] itself

[2:15:46] judgment on hallelujah

[2:16:07] that we're we were trusting somebody to
[2:16:09] help us yes
[2:16:11] trusting somebody to help us
[2:16:14] and in reality they hurt us
[2:16:18] i want to share this with you and i'm
[2:16:19] done i promise there's just a wonderful
[2:16:21] atmosphere in here this morning
[2:16:23] i said brother brother lloyd was brother
[2:16:25] of michael's brother down in richmond i
[2:16:27] was out there preaching of the night
[2:16:29] listening cracker bro having supper
[2:16:30] before church
[2:16:31] and brother lloyd began to share some
[2:16:33] stuff with us brother juan he began to
[2:16:34] tell us how that his wife sister paula
[2:16:37] had been having been having trouble
[2:16:38] breathing for years
[2:16:41] he said brother andrew he said he said
[2:16:42] they thought it was asthma
[2:16:44] he said and for years they've been
[2:16:46] treated as asthma he said to the day it
[2:16:48] got real bad so we took her to the
[2:16:49] doctor and he said brother he said we
[2:16:51] went in there he said the doctor did all
[2:16:53] kinds of scans the doctor said well we
[2:16:54] found your problem
[2:16:56] it's called a paralyzed diaphragm
[2:16:58] he said what he said a paralyzed
[2:17:00] diaphragm he said what happened was
[2:17:02] years ago you had a surgery and she said
[2:17:04] yeah i had a rotator cuff surgery he
[2:17:06] said well the anesthesiologist that did
[2:17:07] the anesthesia
[2:17:09] he said when they went in
[2:17:11] they hit their own part of the body and
[2:17:13] when they hit that part of the body it
[2:17:14] paralyzed your diaphragm
[2:17:16] he said so for all these years your
[2:17:18] diaphragm has been hanging down over
[2:17:20] your lung and he said putting the
[2:17:22] pressure there that you feel like you
[2:17:23] can't breathe he said it's not asthma
[2:17:26] it's a paralyzed diaphragm inflicted by
[2:17:27] a surgery that a doctor made a mistake
[2:17:30] a man made a mistake now i'm not i'm not
[2:17:32] preaching against medical science now
[2:17:33] okay don't take it that way
[2:17:35] but these are the words he said brother
[2:17:36] juan he said there's nothing really we
[2:17:38] can do for you
[2:17:39] he said we're sorry but the only thing
[2:17:41] we could possibly do is go in there and
[2:17:43] cut open and lift the diaphragm up and
[2:17:45] try to sew it to something to hold it
[2:17:47] off the lung just to get a little bit of
[2:17:48] relief to breathe but other than that we
[2:17:50] don't it can't be fixed it's beyond
[2:17:52] repair and brother what brother lloyd
[2:17:54] was telling me that in the back of my
[2:17:56] mind i was sitting in a meeting a few
[2:17:58] years ago brother wayne lawson and i was
[2:17:59] preaching a meeting and at the end that
[2:18:01] meeting brother wayne began to tell a
[2:18:03] testimony about his wife's grandmother
[2:18:05] who actually was in brother ramsey's
[2:18:07] meetings in jonesborough arkansas where
[2:18:09] the brand came there and what happened
[2:18:11] was years after that she went and had a
[2:18:13] surgery it was a shoulder surgery she
[2:18:15] went and had a surgery come out the
[2:18:17] doctors told her go to therapy she went
[2:18:18] to therapy and the doctor come to spot
[2:18:20] the physical therapist said you know
[2:18:22] you've gone as far as you can go and
[2:18:23] brother after she had the surgery she
[2:18:25] could only raise her arm this high this
[2:18:27] is as high as it could go she can never
[2:18:29] fully raise it she could raise this arm
[2:18:31] up all over her head but this is as high
[2:18:32] as this one could go and they couldn't
[2:18:34] figure out what was wrong for years and
[2:18:36] finally one day she went to the doctor
[2:18:37] she went there she said doc i'm not
[2:18:39] going to sue you i'm not i'm not looking
[2:18:41] for money i'm just wanting to know what
[2:18:42] happened what what caused my arm to be
[2:18:44] in this condition he said well man i
[2:18:46] hate to tell you he said but during the
[2:18:48] surgery we made a mistake and he said we
[2:18:50] clipped the nerve and when we clipped
[2:18:52] that nerve he said we tried our best to
[2:18:54] fix it there's no way it can be repaired
[2:18:56] he said it's always going to be that way
[2:18:58] you'll never be able to raise your arm
[2:18:59] any higher than that he said we're sorry
[2:19:01] she said i'm not going to sue you i just
[2:19:02] wanted to know what was happening
[2:19:04] he said now brother wayne said like this
[2:19:06] he said she went to she went home and
[2:19:09] was listening to a tape and she heard
[2:19:11] brother branham say that they can send a
[2:19:13] man to the moon and they can't figure
[2:19:15] out the life that's in a blade of grass
[2:19:18] he said they can send a man to the moon
[2:19:20] and they cannot figure out the life
[2:19:21] that's in the blade of grass she heard
[2:19:23] that tape she went to the to a garage
[2:19:25] sale got out of her car and looked at
[2:19:28] the blade of grass and said i just heard
[2:19:30] a prophet say they cannot figure out how
[2:19:32] the blade of grass has life but they can
[2:19:35] send the man to the moon she said
[2:19:36] brother brother wayne told like this he
[2:19:38] said when she said that she said but god
[2:19:41] created the life in that blade of grass
[2:19:43] and when she said that she said praise
[2:19:46] the lord i believe it was like this
[2:19:47] praise lord and for the first time she
[2:19:49] lifted this arm to praise god and raised
[2:19:52] the other one just fine
[2:19:56] the doctor said the nerve was clipped
[2:19:59] the arm would never be raised again but
[2:20:01] listen friends the creator of the body
[2:20:04] was inside of him
[2:20:06] it didn't matter what man

[2:37:13] your birth
[2:37:15] when the bible says you are born again
[2:37:17] by the sea incorruptible
[2:37:20] your birth
[2:37:22] your birth in god
[2:37:24] is supernatural
[2:37:25] [Music]
[2:37:28] it's supernatural
[2:37:30] just like brother andrews testified i
[2:37:32] remember
[2:37:33] one of my last meeting in south africa i
[2:37:35] was dedicating the church there for
[2:37:37] brother lockheed anthony
[2:37:39] i was preaching one night and i was
[2:37:41] preaching the message it was a christmas
[2:37:43] weekend i was preaching the mercy child
[2:37:45] verb graham says uh your natural birth
[2:37:48] is more mysterious than the virgin birth
[2:37:51] that's what i was preaching that night
[2:37:53] and
[2:37:55] as i was preaching
[2:37:57] the lord took over the service
[2:38:00] for some reason
[2:38:02] there was a pause i was in the middle of
[2:38:04] preaching but there was a pause
[2:38:07] and
[2:38:09] and i said
[2:38:12] [Music]
[2:38:14] might think that this is your last
[2:38:15] service
[2:38:16] you might have middle your mind
[2:38:18] that this meeting will be your last
[2:38:20] meeting in church
[2:38:22] and when i said that it's on tech
[2:38:25] something went across the building
[2:38:31] just like that
[2:38:34] it happened to be
[2:38:36] the pastor
[2:38:38] son's wife
[2:38:40] father came from abusive an abusive
[2:38:42] church
[2:38:43] so he just stayed that weekend
[2:38:45] because he had decided after this
[2:38:48] meeting i'm done with this message
[2:38:50] [Music]
[2:38:51] oh
[2:38:52] [Music]
[2:38:54] god and the holy spirit moved in that
[2:38:58] meeting that moved
[2:39:00] it was just like a loch ness that struck
[2:39:02] that man
[2:39:05] every birth of a child of god
[2:39:08] is supernatural
[2:39:13] we might sit in church and come to
[2:39:15] church and come to church
[2:39:17] just stay in the atmosphere
[2:39:20] praise the lord
[2:39:21] when the world brings a birth to you
[2:39:25] is going to be above anything you have
[2:39:27] honestly
[2:39:29] anything that you can explain
[2:39:31] because every birth of a child of god
[2:39:35] is supernatural
