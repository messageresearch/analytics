[39:10] Uh
[39:15] the worship was wonderful this morning.
[39:17] I came in to worship and the song leader
[39:19] saw me and he said, "We should end the
[39:20] worship." But I just came to to worship.
[39:23] Praise the Lord. I just came to get
[39:26] under that anointing so I can be able to
[39:28] flow with it. So we thank the Lord.
[39:30] Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord. We continue to pray
[39:33] that the Lord will keep helping our
[39:35] brother, brother Lawrence.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; And uh
[39:39] uh sometimes I see his courage. He pick
[39:42] up a song uh that he's been practicing
[39:46] and try to bring it and then uh it's not
[39:48] working well and and you know it's okay,
[39:51] let's leave it. Let's go to the next
[39:52] one. Praise the Lord. So we just pray
[39:54] that the Lord will help our brother.
[39:56] Amen.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And again, we want to greet
[40:00] everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[40:02] What can we say about the service on
[40:04] Wednesday night? Amen. It was beautiful.
[40:06] Praise the Lord. Our brother uh traveled
[40:09] to u uh Ohio. He's preaching for brother
[40:13] Charlan this morning and then he leave
[40:15] back to Germany uh uh tomorrow. So uh it
[40:20] was it was good to meet him. It was very
[40:22] very good. especially for me. Amen. I
[40:25] had the best part of it because since he
[40:27] came in on uh Tuesday, we just we just
[40:31] we just had a good time to spend
[40:33] together, visit with one another, get to
[40:36] know one another, talk. I mean, it was
[40:38] just we just took up right from there.
[40:40] Right from there, we just took up.
[40:42] Praise the Lord. Because it happens
[40:43] there. Uh we have many acquaintance, you
[40:47] know. He sent me the picture when he got
[40:49] to the airport. Um and then he's
[40:52] standing with Ruben Dius and his wife,
[40:55] they were my host uh the first time in
[40:57] South Africa 2004.
[41:00] [clears throat]
[41:01] So I thought he just came from South
[41:03] Africa. So uh when when I pick him up, I
[41:06] says, "Oh, you just came from He said,
[41:08] "No, I would just send you a picture so
[41:10] you can you can put a face to the name."
[41:12] I said, "Oh, well, you send me the the
[41:14] picture of my host. Those are my host."
[41:16] "Oh, you know them." And then we just
[41:18] started right from there. Praise the
[41:19] Lord. But the service was wonderful. a
[41:22] little bit different but it was
[41:24] wonderful. Uh all of God's children uh
[41:27] are very very very unique very unique in
[41:30] their way. Amen. But I think one thing
[41:33] we can learn and and the the beautiful
[41:35] thing that also was about the service is
[41:38] that let's go to the book of Colossian.
[41:40] We're not we're not starting our reading
[41:42] yet, but uh uh um this was where brother
[41:48] Farmer read from uh on on Sunday
[41:51] morning.
[41:53] That was where he read from and and that
[41:55] was that was the part of the service
[41:57] that really that really uh you know
[41:59] intrigued me. It got my attention
[42:02] because I just felt like okay I think
[42:04] the Lord is dealing with us here. Praise
[42:07] [clears throat] the Lord. I feel like
[42:08] the Lord is dealing with us.
[42:11] Oh, praise the Lord. He read from uh
[42:15] chapter one.
[42:22] Amen.
[42:35] Okay. Uh let's read from verse 12. This
[42:39] was where he read from on on Sunday
[42:41] morning when he preached to us. And
[42:44] strange enough, he never even gave a a a
[42:46] title to his subject. He just, you know,
[42:49] uh went into the testimony about his
[42:52] mother coming in the prayer line in uh
[42:55] message uh uh uh spiritual food in due
[42:58] season and talked about his healing and
[43:01] he just went on from there. So he really
[43:03] didn't give his his title to his sermon.
[43:06] So I was looking it up and I think what
[43:09] they did was they took the title from
[43:11] the Sunday school and make make it
[43:13] sermon. So that was good. Amen. So if
[43:17] you look online it will be only believe.
[43:20] Now, so from verse uh 12, giving thanks
[43:23] unto the Father, which have made us meet
[43:27] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[43:29] the saints in light,
[43:31] who have delivered us from the power of
[43:35] darkness. That's very powerful. Praise
[43:38] the Lord.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; He have delivered us from the power of
[43:40] darkness and have translated us. Now if
[43:44] you watch when brother FMA preach he
[43:47] will say uh this word was the same word
[43:49] that was used for Enoch. Enoch was
[43:52] translated.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; So actually the message he was preaching
[43:56] was actually around translation around
[43:59] the rapture.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; And here is uh brother uh uh uh uh Andre
[44:05] comes on on uh Wednesday night and he
[44:08] preaching to us rapture ready.
[44:13] Praise the Lord.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; But with this scripture, we can know
[44:17] that we are rapture ready
[44:20] &gt;&gt; because what is happening here is that
[44:23] he has delivered us from the power of
[44:26] darkness. Not only that we are delivered
[44:29] but we have been translated.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; We have been moved under another
[44:34] headship.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; We have been moved on under another
[44:41] headship. So we are completely under a
[44:44] new government. Amen.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; He has delivered us from the power of
[44:47] darkness. Translated us into the kingdom
[44:50] of his dear son
[44:53] &gt;&gt; in whom we have redemption through his
[44:57] blood even the forgiveness of our sin.
[45:01] Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; So I just thought that was just a
[45:04] perfect connection and I mean I was just
[45:06] I was just enjoying his time of of
[45:09] bringing the word. He's a He's a man
[45:12] that is uh as we talk a little bit. I
[45:15] mean, he likes he likes the rubber to
[45:16] meet the road. He likes uh things to be
[45:19] real.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; So, he was he was trying to make us to
[45:23] know it was beautiful. And it's truth.
[45:26] You read the Bible. After Elijah came
[45:29] from out of that anointing, he went
[45:31] straight into depression. And he never
[45:34] got out of it until he was raptured.
[45:36] That's truth. Brother Bannon said it.
[45:40] He went in and out of depression. You
[45:42] know, uh the effect of the anointing and
[45:45] and and and you see that it's so bad.
[45:49] They're so bad. the the tapoo. One of
[45:52] the vision of the tapoo, brother
[45:53] Brandham says uh you know that that part
[45:56] of vision where they were trying to he
[45:58] trying to lace the shoes and God says
[46:01] you cannot teach Pentecost of people
[46:05] &gt;&gt; you know supernatural things
[46:07] &gt;&gt; and that and that is the place where we
[46:09] are you we we finding ourselves in this
[46:12] time where many preachers are running to
[46:15] divine healing. We are we are streaming
[46:17] after divine healing. you know, we want
[46:19] this vedication that I prayed for this
[46:21] person and they were well, you know, and
[46:23] I pray for this person and they were
[46:25] well, but uh if you if you really watch
[46:28] that is that the the healing is still in
[46:31] the camp,
[46:32] &gt;&gt; but it's not the major thing that God is
[46:34] doing.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Healing is still in the camp, but
[46:40] it's not the major thing that God is
[46:41] doing. The major thing that God is doing
[46:44] is getting you rapture ready. Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Getting our state of mind in a place
[46:50] because if you if you really look at it
[46:52] since you will realize that there is no
[46:55] age that is ever like our age.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; You would not imagine the things that we
[47:01] are dealing with in this age.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; You cannot imagine the things that we
[47:11] you are we are dealing with with in this
[47:13] age. But you see because we have lived
[47:16] here I don't know I know my age I don't
[47:18] know yours but for how many years I have
[47:20] been here it is how many years that you
[47:23] have been dealing with that right from
[47:25] the mother's womb
[47:29] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[47:31] &gt;&gt; we are dealing with every form of
[47:33] pressure so you see the word the message
[47:35] of the hour is to set our mind to
[47:39] understand the time we are living in
[47:41] what we are dealing with and what god
[47:44] God is doing in us.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; He's not bringing this flesh to
[47:48] perfection.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; He's bringing your spirit to understand
[47:53] &gt;&gt; the grace that has been given to you for
[47:56] this hour.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; So I I just thought that that was that
[48:02] was very beautiful.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; That was very very very beautiful.
[48:07] the the two witnesses in Jerusalem like
[48:10] he typed Moses and Elijah they are a
[48:12] type of a rapture
[48:15] but they were dead they were killed in
[48:17] the street before their body was
[48:19] raptured
[48:24] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[48:28] &gt;&gt; so I thought it was beautiful Amen
[48:31] he he traveled and touched me yesterday
[48:35] that he he got back and he talked to
[48:38] Ohio sibling and and really really
[48:41] expressed how much he enjoyed the
[48:43] fellowship. Uh amen how much he enjoyed
[48:47] uh uh the quality of uh of the reception
[48:50] of the word. You know when the preacher
[48:52] is preaching he uh he can feed you.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; He can feel that you are receiving him.
[48:57] He can feel that you are resenting him.
[49:00] He really testify that he really fed at
[49:02] home. Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; He fed at home and and uh and so much
[49:07] there. He he asked me he says he said
[49:10] brother one I was thinking to preach
[49:12] something for brother Chab but I'm going
[49:14] to preach exactly what I preach at your
[49:17] place because I I I just found a channel
[49:20] and I felt that it was good. Amen.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to preach there. He says on
[49:24] the voice he says if you will allow me I
[49:27] don't know if I have the authority but
[49:31] praise the Lord. But uh in saying that
[49:34] also is is at a place where uh you know
[49:38] we must we must commend you and uh and
[49:41] commend ourself uh that uh uh you know
[49:44] the Lord has given us the grace to be
[49:46] able to labor together like I've always
[49:49] said there's one responsibility that we
[49:51] have is the atmosphere here.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Every one of us that walks through that
[49:57] door are responsible for what happened
[50:00] here during the service.
[50:02] Praise the Lord.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I think it's a beautiful
[50:07] thing. Uh uh it does not uh it does not
[50:10] have to do with the crowd. It does not
[50:12] have to do with our our it's just it's
[50:15] it's just our expectation.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. The expectation we bring to
[50:21] church, the readiness and and also we
[50:24] are here because you can be here and not
[50:27] here.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; But we want you to be here. Amen. We
[50:32] want you to be here. Don't don't leave
[50:34] your body with us and go shopping with
[50:35] your spirit.
[50:37] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Because uh if you do that, we'll take
[50:43] the rapture and then you get back in
[50:45] just a dead body you meet.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; So we are very very grateful this
[50:50] morning. Very very grateful this
[50:52] morning. I don't have a lot of u uh uh
[50:56] prayer leads that came through the text.
[50:59] I'm sure There's a whole lot there. But
[51:01] uh uh of those uh believers in in
[51:06] Nigeria that were kidnapped uh a text
[51:08] message came uh they all were released.
[51:11] So they went back to their family. We
[51:14] just want to thank the Lord for them.
[51:15] Amen.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So let's just stand to
[51:19] uh stand on our feet and we will go to
[51:21] the book of Isaiah.
[51:24] We go to the book of Isaiah.
[51:28] Praise the Lord.
[51:31] We go to the book of Isaiah chapter 10.
[51:42] Isaiah chapter 10. Let's read verse 27.
[51:46] And I will have you to take your seat.
[51:48] and I will go back to the beginning of
[51:51] the chapter and read what I want to read
[51:54] because I want to use that to be able to
[51:55] set the stage of what I want to express
[51:58] this morning. Amen. Verse 27.
[52:03] And it shall come to pass in that day
[52:07] that his burden shall be taken away from
[52:11] off thy shoulder. His burden shall be
[52:14] taken off thy shoulder, and his yoke
[52:18] from of thy neck, and the yoke shall dis
[52:23] shall be destroyed because of the
[52:26] anointing. Strange enough, when brother
[52:29] Lawrence was studying the song service,
[52:31] he said this, the anointing will break
[52:32] the yoke. I said, well, okay, I think we
[52:35] we are on the same page now.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, we want to
[52:39] ask your blessing, Lord, on the service
[52:41] this morning, Lord God, as we go into
[52:43] your word. We'll go back now, Father, as
[52:46] at the beginning of the chapter, but
[52:48] just help us, Lord, to just be able to
[52:50] grab the context. So, Father, we love
[52:53] you and we appreciate you, Father, in
[52:55] Jesus name. Amen. The Lord bless you.
[52:58] You can have a seat. Let's go back to uh
[53:00] the beginning of the chapter. We could
[53:02] start from verse five. But uh
[53:07] uh
[53:14] I I would jump few verses but I just I
[53:17] just want for us to be able to grab uh
[53:19] the context here. Verse one, woe unto
[53:22] them that decreed on unrighteous decree
[53:25] and that right grievousness which they
[53:28] have perceived to turn aside the needed
[53:32] to to turn aside the needed from
[53:34] judgment and to take away the right from
[53:37] the poor of my people
[53:40] that widows may may be afraid and that
[53:44] they may rob the fatherless.
[53:48] Let's drop down to verse five. The
[53:50] picture really starts to build from
[53:52] there. Oh Assyan,
[53:56] the rod of my anger. Now God is
[54:01] referring to this foreign nation to this
[54:05] hidden nation that they are the rod of
[54:09] his anger. They are a whip in his hands.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's what I want us to see the
[54:16] picture now. Uh ohans the rod of of my
[54:20] anger and the staff in their hand is my
[54:26] indignation. So whatever staff, sword,
[54:30] uh armor they are using, God is saying
[54:33] is my judgment, is my indignation. I
[54:37] will send him. I will send Assyrian
[54:40] against an hypocritical nation, which is
[54:43] Israel. And against the people of my
[54:46] wrath will I give him a charge to take
[54:50] the spo and to to take the pray and to
[54:53] tread tread them down like the m of the
[54:58] street the m of the street. How be it
[55:03] he mean not so neither does his heart
[55:07] think so. Now think about this. Now God
[55:10] is saying that I'm I'm I'm using the
[55:14] appearance as a rod in my hands. But
[55:17] listen to this verse. How be your soul?
[55:19] He meetth now. So his heart tinkketh
[55:22] now. So he he really don't have the
[55:24] heart to be able to do such a
[55:27] wickedness.
[55:28] That's where now you're going to see
[55:30] where the anointing comes in because God
[55:34] is saying I'm going to use a syrup.
[55:36] meaning that I'm going to anoint them to
[55:39] do this. They don't have the heart to do
[55:41] it.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[55:50] &gt;&gt; How be it he meetth so neither does his
[55:55] heart think so. But it is in his heart
[55:59] to destroy and cut off nations,
[56:03] not a few.
[56:06] Praise the Lord.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:16] Uh I want to drop down a little bit
[56:19] here.
[56:22] Okay. Uh let's go down now.
[56:30] Okay. Let's go down to verse uh 14.
[56:37] For my hand has f has found as uh a nest
[56:41] of of riches of the people and as one
[56:45] gathering eggs that are left.
[56:50] Have I gather all the earth and there
[56:52] was none that move the wind or open the
[56:57] mouth of Pet
[57:00] shall the axe. Okay. Yeah. Verse 15.
[57:03] That's what I wanted to get to actually.
[57:05] Now, shall the axe boast itself against
[57:08] him that that held
[57:11] that hel
[57:14] or shall the sword magnify itself
[57:16] against him that shaketh it? Or as as if
[57:22] the rod should shake itself against them
[57:26] that lift it up. or as if the staff
[57:29] should lift up itself as if it were no
[57:34] wood. Now, so God is saying now because
[57:37] you're coming to see where the picture
[57:39] will be here. He's saying that just like
[57:43] this vowing cannot lift itself up and
[57:46] play.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; So neither can the roar lift itself up
[57:51] and fight, the staff cannot just get up
[57:53] and start killing. That's right.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[58:10] Okay. Verse 16. Therefore shall the Lord
[58:14] the Lord of host sent among among his
[58:17] fat ones leaners and under his glory he
[58:21] shall candle uh a burning
[58:25] like the burning of fire.
[58:29] Praise the Lord.
[58:32] Praise the Lord.
[58:41] Verse 17. And the lights of Israel shall
[58:45] be for a fire in his holy one, for a
[58:48] flame, and it shall burn in the hall
[58:50] with tongues and with birth in one bang.
[58:53] Now, so when you read carefully, when
[58:57] you read carefully, I think I might have
[59:00] skipped the verse, but where I'm trying
[59:02] to get to here is that God from the
[59:06] beginning said he was going to use the
[59:08] searing as a rod in his hands. Praise
[59:11] the Lord. Amen.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; But then if you read there carefully,
[59:15] I'm trying to craft the verse because uh
[59:18] that's not where I want to do it, but I
[59:20] just wanted to use it as a picture
[59:22] because we're going to talk about the
[59:23] anointing
[59:25] and and uh
[59:35] okay, let's let's let's drop down a
[59:38] little bit. Okay, the verse is stay
[59:40] ahead of me.
[59:50] The verse is stayed ahead of me. This uh
[59:52] that verse 24. Therefore, thus say the
[59:55] Lord God of hosts, oh my people
[59:58] that dwelleth in Zion, be not afraid of
[1:00:01] the Assyrian, he he shall smite thee
[1:00:03] with a rod, and shall lift up his staff
[1:00:07] against thee after the manner of Egypt.
[1:00:12] for yet a very little while and the
[1:00:15] indignation shall cease and my anger
[1:00:20] in their destruction and the Lord of
[1:00:22] hosts shall strip up uh escort for him I
[1:00:27] calling to the slaughter. Now so what is
[1:00:29] happening yet is that God is saying I'm
[1:00:31] going to use these people but again I'm
[1:00:34] going to turn around because they were
[1:00:36] just a whip for me to be able to
[1:00:38] discipline my children.
[1:00:41] But I'm going to turn around and destroy
[1:00:43] them. And the reason is because they
[1:00:46] thought that they were doing it.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the principle?
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Now think about it, okay? A good picture
[1:00:57] here will be Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; He was just like just like the Assyrian.
[1:01:04] God used him as a whip. But when he took
[1:01:07] it to himself,
[1:01:11] that see all of these things that my
[1:01:13] hand has done.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; He went seven years like a beast.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; He went seven year like a beast. So uh
[1:01:26] uh the principle there that we want to
[1:01:29] we want to look at here is that uh uh in
[1:01:33] in in a message perfect fit brother
[1:01:34] Brandon said in many places but right
[1:01:36] here I have this one. He said but he
[1:01:40] cannot fail. So as long as we are trying
[1:01:43] in ourself and depending on our own
[1:01:46] abilities and so forth why we will do
[1:01:49] nothing but when we but when we get to a
[1:01:53] place where we know we are nothing then
[1:01:56] God can use us.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] So uh uh uh whether the heathens,
[1:02:04] whether the believers, God don't want us
[1:02:08] to depend on our ability.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And and and the the the major thing with
[1:02:15] my mindset here this morning is that it
[1:02:18] will not take our ability to put us in
[1:02:20] the rapture.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will not take our ability to
[1:02:26] overcome in this age.
[1:02:29] We will have to rely on the anointing.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; So, we want to start our subject. We've
[1:02:38] been talking from uh uh uh Revelation
[1:02:41] chapter 4, five, and six. And uh the the
[1:02:44] the the beasts and the rather that's
[1:02:48] what we've been we've been we've been
[1:02:50] dwelling on. [clears throat] And then
[1:02:52] when these brothers comes, they preach
[1:02:54] wonderful messages. you just you almost
[1:02:57] want to leave your subject and follow
[1:02:59] him, but you have to stay where you want
[1:03:01] to be. Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; So, I will read from uh the the the
[1:03:05] fifth seal [snorts] this morning. That's
[1:03:07] where my inspiration is coming from from
[1:03:10] the fifth seal.
[1:03:12] Brother Brandham says here don't forget
[1:03:15] this church and you brethrens on tape.
[1:03:19] We are the one. I want you to examine
[1:03:22] this. How could men do anything else
[1:03:26] beside the power of God that has been
[1:03:29] released to them?
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How can a man do
[1:03:34] anything? How can a woman do anything?
[1:03:37] How can a bride do anything? How can the
[1:03:39] children of God do anything in this age
[1:03:43] than the power that is released to them?
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:51] He says, "I'm going to set uh this box
[1:03:54] up here to represent it." He's trying to
[1:03:57] uh build an image. Now, if God send a
[1:04:00] certain spirit among them, that's the
[1:04:04] only thing that they can the only thing
[1:04:08] that they can work by
[1:04:11] is the spirit that works among them.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Now, we will prove to you by the history
[1:04:21] of the church and by the opening of the
[1:04:24] seals and uh and and the power that let
[1:04:29] loose.
[1:04:31] Now, watch exactly the church responding
[1:04:35] to the anointing and they couldn't do
[1:04:39] nothing else.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; We cannot do nothing else but to
[1:04:45] respond.
[1:04:47] to the anointing of our age.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; We cannot do anything beyond that.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Anything we trying to
[1:04:59] do beyond that, we only using our
[1:05:02] ability and pretty soon we will fail.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? If we try to do
[1:05:09] anything more than that, you see and and
[1:05:12] and that's the reason why the uh uh uh
[1:05:16] you know the the the cult the brother
[1:05:18] introduces thought the rapture will just
[1:05:21] be a normal routine.
[1:05:26] It's not going to be an extraordinary
[1:05:29] thing in uh uh what they did in South
[1:05:32] Africa having people to to go in a bush
[1:05:34] and and everybody going on top of the
[1:05:36] mountain and uh uh uh looking to the
[1:05:39] heavens and uh it's just going to be a
[1:05:43] normal routine. Two will be in bed,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; one will be taken, one will be left. Two
[1:05:48] will be in the field working, one will
[1:05:50] be taken, one will be left. It will just
[1:05:52] be a normal routine.
[1:05:58] Are we together?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; But if you read that quote, it says that
[1:06:05] uh uh brother Brandham says it will be a
[1:06:07] normal routine as we scripturally follow
[1:06:12] the word.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which mean as we are just
[1:06:21] scripturally living living we just
[1:06:23] living our simple Christian life. We are
[1:06:26] not putting up a show. We're not trying
[1:06:27] to impress anybody. We are just living
[1:06:30] our simple Christian life. Believing
[1:06:32] trusting in God. Amen. And just seeing
[1:06:35] how he's dealing with us.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Responding to the anointing. That's what
[1:06:41] I'm I want to preach. I'm I'm speaking
[1:06:43] on this morning. The church responding
[1:06:45] to the anointing. And she can do nothing
[1:06:48] else.
[1:06:50] She can do nothing else but to respond
[1:06:54] to the anointing. You try to get away
[1:06:55] from it, God will drag you by the feet.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; If he got to pull you by the ear, if you
[1:07:00] got to come in by the skin of your
[1:07:02] teeth, he would do it because you are
[1:07:05] you are predestinated to to to respond
[1:07:08] to the anointing of this hour.
[1:07:12] [clears throat]
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:19] So he says here, I I I will prove it to
[1:07:22] you by history of the church and by the
[1:07:26] opening of the seals, the power that let
[1:07:29] loose and watch exactly the church
[1:07:32] responding to the anointing and they
[1:07:35] couldn't do nothing else. Now the first
[1:07:39] was the lion.
[1:07:42] Praise the Lord. The lion that roar that
[1:07:45] pure unadulterated word. The second in
[1:07:48] territorial was ox. Terrier age was not
[1:07:52] the second age but the second anointing
[1:07:55] came in territorial age. Why? Because
[1:07:58] the first three church ages were under
[1:08:00] the first anointing. We've been we've
[1:08:03] been over there going over there. The
[1:08:05] first three church ages were under the
[1:08:08] lion anointing. So that's what he's he's
[1:08:10] saying here. The first anointing was the
[1:08:12] lion that pe on adultery word. And then
[1:08:15] the second interior was the ox. He says
[1:08:19] it was a burden, the beast of burden.
[1:08:21] Pardon me. He says it was a sacrificial
[1:08:24] beast.
[1:08:26] And wasn't that exactly
[1:08:30] exactly the poor little church room has
[1:08:33] scattered down to a thousand years of
[1:08:36] dark age and everything that they didn't
[1:08:39] profess to be to be of the Roman church
[1:08:43] was put to death immediately.
[1:08:48] What did they do? They were they
[1:08:50] willingly walk up there and die. They
[1:08:53] were responding to their anointing.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; They did it joyfully.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. They did it joyfully. They were
[1:09:04] responding to the anointing.
[1:09:06] Our re our first reaction would be to
[1:09:09] run away. Why? Because the eagle loves
[1:09:11] to fly. [laughter]
[1:09:18] Praise the Lord. Our first respond would
[1:09:21] be, "Oh my god, what's happening? you
[1:09:23] start trying to to see if your wings are
[1:09:26] tied.
[1:09:29] What did they do? They willingly walk up
[1:09:31] there and die. They didn't put Kier
[1:09:34] because the spirit of the church in that
[1:09:37] day was sacrificed labor.
[1:09:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Labor. They knew it was going to happen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was the anointing that
[1:09:56] was on the church and they could do
[1:09:59] nothing else
[1:10:01] but to respond to that anointing.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; The anointing on this church is to be in
[1:10:11] the image of Christ.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we must be center
[1:10:15] on the word. We're not following
[1:10:18] emotion. We're not trying to copy
[1:10:20] another church and copy what God is
[1:10:22] doing. So no, no, we must stay with the
[1:10:24] word because we want to be is to be in
[1:10:28] the image of Christ.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; They willingly walk up there and died
[1:10:42] and and and
[1:10:44] they didn't but but uh but care because
[1:10:47] the spirit of the church in that day was
[1:10:50] sacrificed labor. They walk up just as
[1:10:54] freely as they could walk anointed with
[1:10:58] the spirit of God of that age and die
[1:11:02] like heroes.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; They die like heroes. They die singing
[1:11:10] songs
[1:11:12] because it was the anointing that was on
[1:11:16] them.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; I I just I I I just want to to set this
[1:11:27] uh uh uh from the beginning before we uh
[1:11:31] we we take off here. That that that that
[1:11:33] was the anointing that was on the that
[1:11:36] was on the church.
[1:11:38] They died
[1:11:41] a hero, a sacrifice. Thousand times
[1:11:44] thousand
[1:11:46] 68 million of them on the record ox
[1:11:50] sacrifice. Oh mind. Do you understand
[1:11:54] now? Sacrifice is it only could labor in
[1:11:58] that age. It can only labor. It was only
[1:12:01] laboring in that age. This age is to
[1:12:05] come up higher.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:09] That's the reason why all of these uh uh
[1:12:13] self affliction and self starving to get
[1:12:16] more power from God and you just go on
[1:12:18] hunger strike. It does not work.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; It does not work. I'm not weeping away
[1:12:25] fasting and praying. Fasting and praying
[1:12:27] is just a normal thing. It must be a
[1:12:29] normal thing like you coming to church.
[1:12:33] It must not be like seeking for some
[1:12:36] kind of a extra ordinary power because
[1:12:38] it does not work. What what is happening
[1:12:40] here is that the anointing for this age
[1:12:44] is to come up higher.
[1:12:47] This bride got to be a mature bride in
[1:12:49] the word
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; that when we have when we have situation
[1:12:53] and circumstances in our life if a
[1:12:56] person is sick their first mind will not
[1:12:59] be what sin did I committ it
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; right
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; their first thought would be Lord let me
[1:13:07] glorify you in this trial give me the
[1:13:09] strength
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; that my faith would not get weak
[1:13:18] But what what what we do I mean it's
[1:13:21] it's it's a Pentecostal thing for us to
[1:13:23] start looking for uh uh the cause of the
[1:13:25] sickness. Where is the curse coming
[1:13:27] from? You know what our parent did
[1:13:29] something wrong and and and we then we
[1:13:31] go all through this all all through that
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; as if to say we have not received a
[1:13:36] prophet we have not received the word.
[1:13:39] The church must be mature that when we
[1:13:42] have situation in our life, we have
[1:13:44] situation in our home. You must realize
[1:13:47] that UH YOU HAVE THIS BODY THAT HAVE h
[1:13:51] all your senses
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; and YOU ALSO HAVE EXPERIMENT. THAT'S WHY
[1:13:56] Paul call it experiment. YOU HAVE A DUAL
[1:13:59] LIFE.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A DUAL LIFE TO MAINTAIN.
[1:14:06] YOUR PHYSICAL LIFE COULD BE VERY POOR
[1:14:09] AND UNHEALTHY WHILE YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE
[1:14:12] can be strong.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; And a person can ALSO BE SO BRIGHT AND
[1:14:19] AND AND and and prosper and blessed in
[1:14:22] his physical life while their SPIRITUAL
[1:14:25] LIFE IS DEAD AND POOR.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; How are we keeping the balance?
[1:14:33] Eagle have two wings.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; You can't only fly with one,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; We must get oursel from out of this
[1:14:47] death mar. Brother Brandham said it's a
[1:14:50] death mar to just be keep going around
[1:14:52] the same cycle. We must understand that
[1:14:55] God is moving. He's not going around.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; He's moving. He's moving forward. Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; And we must move forward with him.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; You father in the church word they put a
[1:15:16] whole ladder on, you know, pray pray
[1:15:18] fast pray pray pray pray pray pray pray
[1:15:19] pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray
[1:15:19] pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray
[1:15:19] pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray
[1:15:19] pray pray pray pray pray pray pray pray
[1:15:19] pray pray and there is just no balance
[1:15:22] in the word. You don't have a good
[1:15:24] prayer life if you are not reading the
[1:15:27] word.
[1:15:30] No, you don't have a good prayer life.
[1:15:35] If I would say in another way is that
[1:15:38] you becoming too noisy and irritated to
[1:15:40] God because you becoming this person
[1:15:43] that is talking, talking, talking and
[1:15:45] never giving him a chance to talk back
[1:15:47] to you.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; You doing all the talking.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; A good prayer life IS A LIFE THAT IS
[1:15:56] BALANCED IN PRAYER and in the word.
[1:15:58] Amen.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Because as you are talking to him, you
[1:16:04] also allowing him to speak to you
[1:16:06] through the word,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; through the preaching, THROUGH THE
[1:16:10] TAPES, WHATEVER. BUT YOU WANT HIM TO
[1:16:12] SPEAK TO YOU.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; That's why Brandon says the church
[1:16:18] treating God as an errand boy. They just
[1:16:21] want to tell him, "DO THIS FOR ME. GO
[1:16:23] LORD. GO LORD." YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
[1:16:27] YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD PRAYER life if you
[1:16:30] really not seizing in the word. If you
[1:16:32] are not meditating.
[1:16:34] If you are not a line law speak to me
[1:16:36] this scripture I'm reading let something
[1:16:38] come out of it
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; that speak to me.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:59] The church can do nothing
[1:17:02] but respond to her anointing.
[1:17:05] Amen.
[1:17:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:13] All sacrifice. Oh my God. Do you
[1:17:15] understand that?
[1:17:17] Now sacrifice is the
[1:17:20] it only could labor in that age to
[1:17:24] combat the great opposition
[1:17:28] for that 1,000 years. Now you will see
[1:17:32] that uh uh
[1:17:36] look at it this way. Look at it this
[1:17:38] way. Here are the the believers being
[1:17:42] persecuted
[1:17:43] and uh and and being killed.
[1:17:47] We were taken for weakness.
[1:17:50] We were taken for the church being
[1:17:52] defeated.
[1:17:54] But Brandon says that was where that
[1:17:56] that great critics that wrote the book
[1:17:58] on the silent god. That's where he took
[1:18:01] his inspiration from and he wrote he
[1:18:03] says where is God? You were silent and
[1:18:05] they killing the we were taken for
[1:18:07] weakness.
[1:18:10] But for God, he anointed his people to
[1:18:14] go through that.
[1:18:22] Are we together?
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; They were anointed to go through that.
[1:18:25] It was their season. It was what God
[1:18:28] wanted. And it was,
[1:18:33] the Bible says, precious. Precious
[1:18:38] in the sight of the Lord. That's
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Is the death of the saint.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; What what what make the death of the
[1:18:44] saint precious? It's not the way they
[1:18:46] are killed. It's the way they are
[1:18:48] behaving
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; in death.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; The way they are behaving
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; in death.
[1:18:57] EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE DYING, THEIR
[1:18:58] SICKNESS IS EATING THEIR BODY UP, but
[1:19:01] their heart is saying blessed be the
[1:19:03] name of the Lord. EVEN THOUGH YOU SLAY
[1:19:05] ME, I will praise you.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; That's what is precious in death.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; It's not the dying, it's the attitude.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "Precious in the sight of
[1:19:20] the Lord
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; is the death of the saints."
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] Brother Brandham lay down quickly
[1:19:37] warning before Joshua. He learned it
[1:19:39] very quickly.
[1:19:41] He's praying for someone and and uh and
[1:19:44] you know the person came and gave back
[1:19:45] their heart back to the Lord and you
[1:19:47] know he told the told the church the you
[1:19:49] know uh uh I mean told the the family
[1:19:52] you know the the person will be healed.
[1:19:54] Yeah. They got healed. They give their
[1:19:55] heart back to the Lord and and then they
[1:19:57] die. He went before God and says Lord
[1:19:59] why?
[1:20:02] He says that person just moved before me
[1:20:04] and I said to say shut up your mouth.
[1:20:06] Who are you to ask me why
[1:20:10] I could have take her when she was
[1:20:12] backslided?
[1:20:16] Now she has come back to the Lord. That
[1:20:17] is the good time to take her.
[1:20:25] You see our mind is just is just we we
[1:20:28] are so affected church whether we like
[1:20:30] it or not. This the the the Roman stain
[1:20:33] that has been the Catholic stain that
[1:20:36] has been on the church will we will
[1:20:40] battle with it until we leave from here.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Catholism and denomination has abused
[1:20:50] our mind.
[1:20:52] that for us to really understand the way
[1:20:54] that God is, we always falling back to
[1:20:56] the way the church understand it.
[1:21:05] We will take that for defeat, but for
[1:21:07] God it's not defeat.
[1:21:09] Praise the Lord. It's not defeat to for
[1:21:12] God. HE SAID YOU HAVE FOUGHT A GOOD
[1:21:14] fight of faith.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:19] While we will be here crying, oh Lord,
[1:21:21] Lord, Father, we prayed, we fasted,
[1:21:23] Lord, we asked you, we were, we were
[1:21:26] begging you. And because in our mind, we
[1:21:29] in our mind, we are this poor children.
[1:21:33] That in our mind, everything we ask the
[1:21:35] father, it must be yes.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; No. In God's mind, it's not like that.
[1:21:41] He don't want us to be spoiled. He want
[1:21:43] us to be disciplined.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. for us to understand that he has a
[1:21:47] yes and he has a no.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; To every yes there's a no.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; If God said no to you, can you tell him
[1:22:04] thank you?
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Are you are you are you are so
[1:22:08] disciplined and [clears throat]
[1:22:09] understand his ways that if he say no to
[1:22:12] you, you can say thank you Lord.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; You can say thank you with the same
[1:22:17] smile like you would say thank you if it
[1:22:20] was a yes.
[1:22:23] That's where he's getting us to.
[1:22:28] That's that's where he's getting us to.
[1:22:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; And then he gets down to the tear beast
[1:22:46] that went forth out from the devil
[1:22:51] was this black black hery. Now the ter
[1:22:55] beast that went out a power from God to
[1:23:00] come back him to come back that power of
[1:23:02] the black house was was a man a coning
[1:23:06] smart wisdom with the wisdom of God. The
[1:23:11] anointing was a man.
[1:23:14] It was the man age.
[1:23:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:22] It was a manage I say some things here
[1:23:25] this morning that will maybe just slap
[1:23:27] you on your face a little bit but I
[1:23:30] don't know how much shakuba you have.
[1:23:33] Amen.
[1:23:36] Praise the Lord. I don't know how much
[1:23:38] shaka you have but uh let's uh
[1:23:43] he says that the the the ter was the
[1:23:46] man. So, uh, uh, Emanuel, if you could
[1:23:49] just pull my image up a little bit.
[1:23:51] Let's, uh, let's follow.
[1:24:00] Okay, this is the picture that we've
[1:24:01] been we've been working with
[1:24:04] uh uh through our entire
[1:24:08] uh, series here. So we have the the the
[1:24:12] full anointing on this side. Uh and then
[1:24:15] we have the full evil power on this
[1:24:18] side. You see the darkness coming from
[1:24:19] the bottleless PP and it's it's dealing
[1:24:22] with this. And so we we uh uh
[1:24:28] that's what we were dealing with. That's
[1:24:29] the image we were dealing with. But I
[1:24:31] tried to I try to look for another one.
[1:24:34] So uh let's let's see if the other one
[1:24:36] will will explain
[1:24:38] a little more to us now. So, uh we have
[1:24:43] the lion year. So, in the under the lion
[1:24:45] we see there we had the three church
[1:24:48] ages and this is the the the white horse
[1:24:53] rather that was traveling with a bow and
[1:24:56] no arrow. So he he was operating through
[1:25:00] these three church ages. Now you have to
[1:25:02] realize that on the Bible says that uh
[1:25:06] he has a bow no arrow but then he was
[1:25:10] given a crown. Now so we explained that
[1:25:13] how that the the trinitarian doctrine
[1:25:16] was introduced here. It went through
[1:25:18] these ages and it got a crown. Amen.
[1:25:20] Brother B say it just started from a
[1:25:22] thought that that was looking like a
[1:25:25] good thought. It became a deed and it
[1:25:27] was established as a doctrine. So it it
[1:25:29] went through all of these three church
[1:25:31] ages. So in the quote here, brother
[1:25:33] Brandon used territoriing
[1:25:36] the second beast. It was right here.
[1:25:38] That's the that's the uh
[1:25:43] uh the ox the ox anointing. And uh uh
[1:25:48] it's right here in the dark age. And uh
[1:25:53] it has the red horse rather uh which u
[1:25:57] the Bible
[1:25:59] you know, he was his killing. And then
[1:26:01] so we have uh uh the tail one here
[1:26:04] supposed to be a man. I think the
[1:26:06] picture is on the next one is on the
[1:26:09] next one just because of uh the position
[1:26:12] of the man because when you look at
[1:26:15] let's go let's go back to the first uh
[1:26:17] the the first picture. Uh yeah. So when
[1:26:20] you look at when you look at it here
[1:26:24] in in many in many cases
[1:26:27] the lion did the the first three the ox
[1:26:31] the the man anointing
[1:26:33] operated in the last three church ages.
[1:26:39] Okay. The eagle anointing came at the
[1:26:44] end of the laudish church age.
[1:26:47] Are we together?
[1:26:49] It came at the end of the laudisha
[1:26:51] church age and and gave that call of
[1:26:55] come out of her my people. So the eagle
[1:26:58] anointing is actually not an anointing
[1:27:02] for the Laian church age.
[1:27:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; The man's anointing operated the three
[1:27:12] church ages. The eagle anointing came
[1:27:15] and took the church from the the the end
[1:27:19] of the laudish church age into what we
[1:27:22] can call the bride age
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; an eternal age
[1:27:28] the age of the open the open book.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; now? So
[1:27:38] so uh uh yeah then go back go back to
[1:27:41] the to to that. I I thought that using
[1:27:45] the the the parame will will explain it
[1:27:48] better. Let's go back to the next
[1:27:50] picture now. So So uh okay. Yeah. Yes.
[1:27:52] The man's anointing here uh uh that uh
[1:27:57] was over the you know the the three
[1:28:00] church ages. The eagle's anointing come
[1:28:03] at the end of the age
[1:28:05] and then uh it goes right into the rest
[1:28:09] of it. Go back to the first picture. Not
[1:28:11] the one. No, not this one. Okay, go back
[1:28:15] to this one now. So, uh uh we talking
[1:28:18] about the church responding to her
[1:28:21] anointing and she cannot do anything
[1:28:24] else but respond to the anointing that
[1:28:28] is given to us in this age. Now you have
[1:28:32] to know that uh all of these anointing
[1:28:38] all of these anointing
[1:28:40] uh uh
[1:28:44] it is not just
[1:28:46] a feeling you know it's not just a
[1:28:49] feeling that I feel good or you know I
[1:28:51] enjoy the service or no it was it was
[1:28:54] what God gave it was it was the it was
[1:28:57] the power that was given by God to be
[1:29:01] able to fight against the power the evil
[1:29:06] power that was in that age.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so if you go to Revelation
[1:29:15] chapter 6, let's go to Revelation
[1:29:17] chapter 6. While the picture stay up
[1:29:20] there, don't go to the scripture.
[1:29:23] If you have your Bible, you turn there.
[1:29:25] If you don't have your Bible, then
[1:29:26] you're just listening.
[1:29:32] while the picture stays up there.
[1:29:38] Revelation chapter 6.
[1:29:41] Are we together?
[1:29:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6, let's read from
[1:29:52] verse one. And I saw the lamb
[1:29:56] open one of the seal. Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; And I heard
[1:30:04] as it were the noise of thunder
[1:30:09] one of the four beasts. Now I'm not uh
[1:30:13] I'm not I'm not adequate to represent
[1:30:15] the lamb, but because I'm preaching, let
[1:30:17] me be the lamb. Okay.
[1:30:20] the lamb the the the the Bible will be
[1:30:23] the seal book. So the lamb open open the
[1:30:27] seal and John says he heard like a
[1:30:31] thunder but what was thundering was one
[1:30:35] of this anointing that was tonering and
[1:30:38] saying come and see.
[1:30:41] Praise the Lord. So the lamb had the
[1:30:43] book,
[1:30:45] the seal book in his hands, but it was
[1:30:48] the anointing that was identifying.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; The anointing, that's the reason why
[1:30:57] Bern Brand says to overcome is to
[1:31:00] identify the enemy in his tricks.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; But it is not you that is identifying.
[1:31:08] You don't have the power.
[1:31:11] You don't have the ability. You don't.
[1:31:13] Sometimes the devil come, he finish
[1:31:14] doing his work before we even know that
[1:31:16] he visited our home.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Remember now Jesus said the enemy comes
[1:31:24] to do what?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And destroy. Now this is this is the
[1:31:31] Messiah. This is our Lord trying to tell
[1:31:34] us. He comes to do that. And because
[1:31:37] that's what he comes TO DO. SO GOD GIVES
[1:31:40] an anointing in an age that will be able
[1:31:43] to grab him right-handed.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; You see, so the lamb open the book as
[1:31:51] he's opening the book now. So watch now
[1:31:53] is the principle to overcome because we
[1:31:55] cannot overcome in our ability.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; We can only overcome when we hear the
[1:32:02] thunder from the anointing from the
[1:32:04] beast that say come and see.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:08] If we hear it and we receive it AND THEN
[1:32:11] WE ALSO come and see. So he said come
[1:32:15] and see.
[1:32:17] And I saw John now representing the
[1:32:22] bride.
[1:32:24] You are John
[1:32:26] which I'm part of. I'm I'm representing
[1:32:30] the lamb that has the book and the Holy
[1:32:34] Ghost is the anointing.
[1:32:38] Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in the first three church
[1:32:41] ages was the lion's anointing.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; So when he called and said, "Come and
[1:32:48] see."
[1:32:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; So John REPRESENTING THE BRIDE, JOHN
[1:32:55] REPRESENTING THE CHURCH RESPONDED TO
[1:32:58] THAT ANOINTING.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. when he when they
[1:33:04] responded TO THE ANOINTING, HOW did they
[1:33:06] responded to the anointing? BY BY
[1:33:09] RECOGNIZING THAT BAPTISM IS NOT IN
[1:33:11] FATHER, SON, and holy ghost. Baptism is
[1:33:14] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; That is the way they responded to the
[1:33:20] anointing. THEY IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES
[1:33:23] WITH CHRIST IN their age.
[1:33:28] THEY WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE ONES THAT
[1:33:30] CALL THEMSELVES JEWS AND they were n.
[1:33:32] They kicked them out of the church. WHY?
[1:33:35] WHY WERE THEY DOING THAT? THEY WERE
[1:33:37] RESPONDING TO THE ANOINTING of their
[1:33:39] age.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; It's not a guess work.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; It's not a brainstorming work.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; It's a heart that is obedient to the
[1:33:51] word.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Because we know [snorts] as much as
[1:34:05] we know that as much as this is an
[1:34:08] anointing,
[1:34:10] this is also an anointing.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Just realize that this is an anointing.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; It's a very strong anointing.
[1:34:19] This is the This is the SPIRIT THAT
[1:34:22] PLANTED THE TRINITARIAN DOCTRINE THAT IS
[1:34:24] SO HARD TO GET RID OF.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL THE REVIVAL AND ALL THE MEN
[1:34:30] THAT GOD HAS RAISED UP, THEY HAVE NOT
[1:34:32] BEEN ABLE TO REALLY REALIZE THAT A seed
[1:34:36] was planted.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; It's an anointing.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:44] So it is not how I feel or because you
[1:34:49] know I I I really feel good.
[1:34:52] This can also make you feel good.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; It can also make you feel good.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; How do we respond to the anointing of
[1:35:10] our age? Bring it back to the word.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Bring it back to the word. Let it line
[1:35:16] up with the word.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Not what the church says and what uh the
[1:35:21] bishop said, but let it line up with the
[1:35:23] word.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; That is the way we respond to our
[1:35:27] anointing.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:42] So we see here
[1:35:48] the lamb held the book. The anointing
[1:35:51] said come and see. This was what said
[1:35:53] come and see for the first three ages.
[1:35:56] This was what said come and see for the
[1:35:59] dark age.
[1:36:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the people
[1:36:05] hear the anointing and they and they
[1:36:08] responded to the anointing, the
[1:36:10] anointing anoint them for the age.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; So you see the whole thing there is that
[1:36:17] God is weaping away our abilities.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; HE WANT US TO FULLY TRUST in him.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Come with me.
[1:36:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; COME WALK ME. HE WANT US TO FULLY TRUST
[1:36:38] IN HIM. NO MATTER WHAT WE ARE DEALING
[1:36:40] WITH, NO MATTER WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND
[1:36:42] US,
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; we have a city of refuge.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; We have a city of refuge. I think it was
[1:36:53] brother brother Farmer that was saying
[1:36:54] that and that was beautiful. It's true.
[1:36:57] The city of refuge
[1:37:02] was well maintained.
[1:37:05] It was wellmaintained.
[1:37:08] The roads were bigger.
[1:37:13] The bridge were taken care of every
[1:37:16] year.
[1:37:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And they even hide gas. They had gas on
[1:37:26] the road on on the road of the city of
[1:37:29] the refuge to be able to help a man that
[1:37:32] was running.
[1:37:34] A man that needed help.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; They have people that were posted on the
[1:37:41] C TO HELP HIM GET there quickly.
[1:37:46] Is that not what the cherub beans are
[1:37:48] doing to guide us to the tree of life to
[1:37:50] help him get there quickly? Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; The road was clean that there will be no
[1:37:54] obstacle. There will BE NOTHING TO STOP
[1:37:56] US TO RUN FOR HELP when we need help
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; because God is not depending on your
[1:38:02] ability.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; He want you to trust him.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; The church responded
[1:38:18] to her to her anointing that she grew
[1:38:20] up.
[1:38:22] Like I said in previous service,
[1:38:27] we are under the influence of this
[1:38:30] anointing. When brother Brandon preached
[1:38:32] the message influence for many years,
[1:38:35] for many years and even till now
[1:38:38] when we when we read the message
[1:38:40] influence, we preach the message
[1:38:42] influence. We only look at the influence
[1:38:44] of Yuzia on Isaiah. We don't look at the
[1:38:48] influence of the angels.
[1:38:52] The influence of Yuzia on Isaiah that
[1:38:55] was the first influence he was under
[1:38:58] that his natural birth influence.
[1:39:02] UNDER OUR NATURAL BIRTH WE ARE UNDER THE
[1:39:04] influence of our parents, the influence
[1:39:06] of our bus, the influence of culture,
[1:39:09] the influence OF A TRIBE, WHATEVER IT
[1:39:11] IS. BUT WHEN ISAIAH CAME INTO THE
[1:39:15] TEMPLE,
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; HE WAS UNDER ANOTHER INFLUENCE. [snorts]
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. HE GOT UNDER THE
[1:39:21] INFLUENCE OF THE ANGELS. HE SAYS THAT
[1:39:24] DREAM FILLED THE TEMPLE AND I mean he
[1:39:27] WAS SO CAUGHT UP LEFT THE EARTH CAUGHT
[1:39:30] UP IN THE MIDST OF THOSE angels because
[1:39:32] he was under their influence. It
[1:39:34] affected him so much he said won't talk
[1:39:38] a code of fire and come and touch. So
[1:39:40] you see we we we just stick on that and
[1:39:43] and we talk about influence of one man
[1:39:45] on upon another and AND IT JUST SO BOUND
[1:39:48] BUT WE don't really see the the the
[1:39:51] LESSON THAT BROTHER BRANDON WAS TRYING
[1:39:52] to bring to us that THERE WAS A CHANGE
[1:39:55] OF INFLUENCE.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; There is A TIME IN OUR LIFE WHERE GOD
[1:39:59] TAKE US FROM A NATURAL INFLUENCE AND HE
[1:40:02] BRINGS US on a supernatural influence.
[1:40:04] the influence of the word.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; We are under the influence of seven
[1:40:16] angels. We are not under a man
[1:40:18] influence.
[1:40:20] He can be a bishop, a pastor, or whoever
[1:40:22] he is. We are under the INFLUENCE OF
[1:40:25] THOSE ANGELIC BEINGS
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; THAT open the seals
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; that reveal the word.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Until you give us the word, we will not
[1:40:34] BE SATISFIED. DON'T GIVE US YOUR ideas
[1:40:36] or your feelings. JUST SEND US BACK TO
[1:40:38] THE WORD.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Because that's the influence the bride
[1:40:42] is honor.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful Jesus.
[1:41:01] What an awesome God we serve.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; What an awesome God we serve
[1:41:13] in the message. Junction of time. We can
[1:41:15] take take the picture from there. Keep
[1:41:17] it. We'll use it another time.
[1:41:23] Junction of time. Brother Brandham says
[1:41:25] and he says now the church today
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; is now only having miracles.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; But sad enough that's what the church
[1:41:35] want. The church only want to have
[1:41:37] miracles.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; But he says we're not only having
[1:41:40] miracles but we are miracles ourself.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; It's not only having miracles but is
[1:41:49] preparing for a miracle and that is the
[1:41:52] coming of the Lord. and the rapture of
[1:41:54] the church to be taken up. Give me the
[1:41:57] church ready.
[1:42:00] Visualize to see the signs and and and
[1:42:03] to see the unimportant God, the great
[1:42:06] power of God moving among the people
[1:42:10] which the rapture
[1:42:12] will be an easy thing when Jesus come.
[1:42:17] It will be an easy thing. Praise the
[1:42:20] Lord. But then see see where the catch
[1:42:22] is here because because if it is said
[1:42:25] that to see the signs and the
[1:42:27] unimportant of God and the great power
[1:42:29] of God moving among the people, we
[1:42:32] always think that great power of God is
[1:42:34] just something happen that would just be
[1:42:36] making us to be jumping up.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; That great power of God is what
[1:42:40] sustaining you every day. As you go out
[1:42:43] into this Laian word with all the evil,
[1:42:46] the nastiness that is out there is that
[1:42:48] great power of God that is keeping you.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; He says that's why the rapture will be
[1:42:57] easy
[1:43:01] because we have come to the
[1:43:03] acknowledgment that he is the one that
[1:43:05] is keeping me.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:09] Where I get the strength from to get
[1:43:11] back to church, he is the one.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Where I get the strength from to do the
[1:43:15] things that I know is right to do, he is
[1:43:17] the one.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Is that great power of God in
[1:43:20] simplicity?
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful Jesus.
[1:43:32] What a blessed Jesus.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Let's look at a quote here in in
[1:43:37] paradise.
[1:43:40] Hallelujah.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; And what is it?
[1:43:51] What is it? Christ coming
[1:43:55] to his body. Christ is the word. Amen.
[1:44:00] We all know the anointing is Christ
[1:44:04] [snorts]
[1:44:06] that comes to that comes on the word
[1:44:11] that makes the word live.
[1:44:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Simple example. Jesus was born the word
[1:44:22] and that word was a virgin shall
[1:44:24] conceive.
[1:44:26] Are we together? On the river Jordan,
[1:44:29] Christ came upon the word.
[1:44:35] You see the picture?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; John said, "I see a dove landing on
[1:44:40] him." So Christ came upon a word to take
[1:44:43] the word into his commission.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; But he was born the word.
[1:44:55] A virgin shall conceive. was the word.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; But before he could go into his
[1:45:02] ministry, Christ must come upon the word
[1:45:05] to make the word live.
[1:45:21] You will realize the Bible says uh uh he
[1:45:24] will be called Jesus.
[1:45:28] He never put Christ in.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] to take away the sins of the word is a
[1:45:42] part that he will be f fulfilled that he
[1:45:45] will fulfill but before he fulfilled
[1:45:47] that he needed the word needed to be
[1:45:50] anointed
[1:45:52] the word need an anointing
[1:45:55] is the same way that there was a word
[1:45:57] that was spoken for this age and God
[1:46:00] says I will get a bride with spot or
[1:46:03] wrinkle. The word was there. Praise the
[1:46:06] Lord.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will call out a people from out
[1:46:10] of the Gentiles. That is the word. That
[1:46:12] is a prophecy from Amos. Amos started
[1:46:15] prophesying about that before even the
[1:46:17] the the disciple came along and took
[1:46:19] him.
[1:46:21] Hallelujah.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; And it's thy word that has fleshed us
[1:46:25] out.
[1:46:27] We believe the message. We believe that
[1:46:29] yeah there there's a gentile bride but
[1:46:32] for that word to now goes into action
[1:46:35] you need to be anointed.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham says we
[1:46:41] agreeing we must still HONOR THE SON SO
[1:46:43] we can be repping.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; So the word the the anointing of the
[1:46:50] word will make the the life of Christ in
[1:46:53] you.
[1:46:54] We will not be going out looking for our
[1:46:56] own firm and and and and and you know uh
[1:46:58] uh praises of man but it will be
[1:47:01] everything of Christ.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; We know that the word that makes uh he
[1:47:09] says that we know that we we we all know
[1:47:13] the anointing is Christ that comes on
[1:47:16] the word that makes the word live. Is
[1:47:18] that right?
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; That is the anointing. Christ is the
[1:47:22] anointing, the spirit that comes upon
[1:47:26] the word that quickens the word.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; To make it live. Now
[1:47:34] the word is in your heart.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; You believe in divine healing. You
[1:47:40] believe in rapture. You believe in
[1:47:43] sanctified life, overcoming life. The
[1:47:45] word is in your heart. Whatever more see
[1:47:49] Christ the anointing comes upon his
[1:47:52] body.
[1:47:53] The connection there. He is the head. We
[1:47:56] are the body. So Christ the anointing
[1:47:59] comes upon the body.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; To quicken the word that has been
[1:48:06] prophesied for us
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; in our day.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The word that has been
[1:48:13] prophesied for us in in in our lives.
[1:48:17] So Christ comes upon it just like
[1:48:20] husband and wife to become one. Now the
[1:48:24] church has got has got to get to the
[1:48:28] ministry until the church and Christ
[1:48:31] become one. He can anoint you for every
[1:48:36] blessing that's in the Bible
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; is all yours. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Everything is promised at this age is
[1:48:46] yours.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; When we when we leave anything out, then
[1:48:53] if anointing strikes that, it will
[1:48:56] anoint it.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; What? What? What an awesome God. Are you
[1:49:05] Are you getting the picture?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture? There is
[1:49:10] there is that's the reason why we can't
[1:49:12] hurry the rapture. The rapture is not an
[1:49:14] escape plan.
[1:49:17] No, it's not an escape plan. It's not to
[1:49:20] escape temptation.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; I just wish the rapture come now. It's
[1:49:24] not going to come with it.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Because it's not an escape route. No,
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; it's it's it's another program. It's a
[1:49:36] wonderful thing.
[1:49:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing because in God's
[1:49:43] mind, the rapture is the vehicle that
[1:49:47] takes us to the reception.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; It's the vehicle that takes and that's
[1:49:55] what the bride waits for. She wants to
[1:49:58] for everybody to see her leaving.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody standing in the parking
[1:50:04] lot and just see them leaving.
[1:50:09] So it's not an escape something
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; that we have to be craving for the
[1:50:13] rapture so we can get up from here or
[1:50:15] tire with this word. No,
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; it's a beautiful thing.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Whether we are alive, whether we we are
[1:50:25] dead, praise the Lord, for the dead in
[1:50:27] Christ will rise first and we all will
[1:50:30] partake of the beauty of the rapture.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:38] Are we together?
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; I mean that's that's that's where you
[1:50:48] will realize uh the the the power that
[1:50:50] is invested in you or the power that
[1:50:52] been lied in you d by all these years
[1:50:57] because finally we we will have the
[1:50:59] power to overcome sin.
[1:51:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Watch the church. Honor her anointing.
[1:51:16] She can do nothing
[1:51:19] less.
[1:51:20] Let's take this thought also from the
[1:51:23] word is falling apart.
[1:51:25] Now, anything that pulls you away from
[1:51:28] that is wrong. Anything that pulls you
[1:51:31] away from the word is wrong.
[1:51:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:36] That's a false messiah. That's a false
[1:51:38] anointing.
[1:51:44] Pray. Oh, he said the brother has such
[1:51:47] an anointing. What kind of an anointing
[1:51:49] it was?
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; You have to realize
[1:51:54] the uh the Bible says that uh uh Jews
[1:51:57] brought this out. He says Cororan and
[1:51:59] Dton, they were men that that have the
[1:52:02] anointing of a gainer.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; A gainser is is a is a person that can
[1:52:10] that can convince the whole crowd just
[1:52:12] just by one speech.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Logical.
[1:52:17] Praise the Lord. Logical. It's logical.
[1:52:20] What what they were saying is logical.
[1:52:23] We are also Levites.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; We are Levites. Kora was a Levite.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Dayton was a Levite.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; They are saying we are Levite. Moses and
[1:52:34] Aaron are Levite. Why should be them
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; and not us? Is it not logical?
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; If we are all children of Levites, we
[1:52:43] must all be equal.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THEIR ARGUMENT.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; WELL, everything is just Moses and
[1:52:52] Aaron. Moses and Aaron.
[1:52:58] That was convincing.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; But it cost the life of millions of
[1:53:06] people.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Because the earth opened
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; and swallowed them up.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; So they had an anointing.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; I mean to be able to convince half of
[1:53:18] the camp,
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; it takes an anointing. It just does not
[1:53:23] take a a sweet talking.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; So that what I'm saying is that just
[1:53:33] like there is an anointing here for us
[1:53:36] to respond to, there is also an
[1:53:38] anointing to distract us.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There is an anointing
[1:53:45] here for us to to respond to, FOR US TO
[1:53:48] RELY ON. BUT THERE IS also an anointing
[1:53:51] working among us to distract us.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; He said what kind of anointing it is. He
[1:54:09] said Hitler had an anointing. All of
[1:54:11] this men uh uh Pope Pas had an
[1:54:14] anointing.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; What kind of an anointing you got?
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; If it's not anointed with the word and
[1:54:22] vindicated and vindicate every word to
[1:54:25] be true, leave it alone.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; So what is he simply saying? Bring it
[1:54:30] back to the word.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Don't fall for the feelings.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Bring it back to the
[1:54:39] word.
[1:54:44] Are we together?
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; So we that's I mean that's that's
[1:54:56] exactly where we are. That's where we
[1:54:59] are.
[1:55:00] The church responded. If you if you look
[1:55:03] here, you go back to that quote. Brother
[1:55:05] Brandon did not say the church
[1:55:07] responded. He said the church responded.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; I'm using it in the present tense
[1:55:14] because we are here. But with God is
[1:55:17] something that have already happened.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; The church responded to her to her
[1:55:24] anointing and she could do nothing else.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; So there is a people.
[1:55:32] There's a people. That's there there's a
[1:55:34] word. That's the reason why with with
[1:55:36] with all the million pieces of different
[1:55:38] doctrines that have come up all the
[1:55:40] different teachings that God always find
[1:55:43] a way
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; either by taking the false teacher from
[1:55:47] off the scene. For a while the people
[1:55:49] will get confused, they will be
[1:55:51] discouraged. There is some that will
[1:55:52] backslide. They will leave.
[1:55:56] AND AFTER A WHILE THERE WILL BE SOME
[1:55:59] that will be craving
[1:56:01] to get back to church.
[1:56:05] to get back to the word.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; You know the story with Elea
[1:56:14] and Rebecca. Elea spoke so much about
[1:56:18] Isaac.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; HE SPOKE SO MUCH ABOUT ISAAC that just
[1:56:25] in that time when when when Rebecca said
[1:56:28] according to the scripture, WHO IS THAT
[1:56:30] ON THE FIELD? She never saw Eliza any
[1:56:34] animal in the picture.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; And I believe that GOD WILL TAKE ALL
[1:56:43] these main images from us.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; And our focus is going to be on Christ.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; He can be your favorite pastor that you
[1:56:54] ready to die for. God will have to make
[1:56:56] sure that he take your face from him and
[1:56:59] keep your eyes on Christ. Amen.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; HE SPOKE SO MUCH ABOUT Isaac until from
[1:57:13] a distance she could recognize him.
[1:57:17] Praise the Lord. From a distance, SHE
[1:57:19] HAD A VEIL OVER HER FACE, BUT she could
[1:57:22] still recognize him.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's what God is doing.
[1:57:28] I believe that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:57:30] doing.
[1:57:31] This bride
[1:57:33] is anointed
[1:57:35] to respond to her anointing
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; and she can't do anything else.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why I encourage you
[1:57:46] all the time.
[1:57:48] Watch what God is doing in your life.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; In your life.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Don't think about what you used to be.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; That's a dead hero. That's right.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; That hero is there. And we're talking
[1:58:03] about present time. What the word is
[1:58:05] doing in your life.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; What is he taking you to?
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; How is he dealing with you?
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; How is he dealing with you?
[1:58:31] The more you start putting attention to
[1:58:33] that, the more you will see that the
[1:58:36] curtains will start falling.
[1:58:39] The curtains will start falling
[1:58:42] and he's going to pull you right into
[1:58:44] his presence.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see that that's the reason why
[1:58:50] I struggle with the saying when people
[1:58:51] say let invite the presence of the Lord.
[1:58:53] You can't you can't. He is the one that
[1:58:55] is inviting you.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; How can you invite somebody to their
[1:58:59] house?
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; I go to your house. I get there before
[1:59:04] you. Brother Peterson say you come. I
[1:59:05] said if brother you welcome to your
[1:59:06] house.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; How can you invite somebody? He is the
[1:59:11] one that is inviting us.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; As we come into his presence, he's
[1:59:16] inviting us.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He said come in more.
[1:59:20] Come and see more. He's inviting you
[1:59:23] into his presence.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; HE JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST SIT THERE
[1:59:29] AND AND AND just be observing. Feel
[1:59:32] free. Move around. There's more room.
[1:59:35] You can enter in.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; You can go behind the veil.
[1:59:51] He just don't want you to sit. He want
[1:59:53] you to participate.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He want you to move
[1:59:57] around. Ask question. What is this
[1:59:58] picture?
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; What does it mean?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Ask picture. Ask question. Move around
[2:00:04] and and express the liberty.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; I saw this in the word and uh I you said
[2:00:11] this and I mean I I couldn't get the
[2:00:13] connection. Ask question. Just don't sit
[2:00:15] down there and just and just be
[2:00:17] satisfied to be preached on.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; NO. GET IN the word.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; That when you get out and and they ask
[2:00:34] you, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was I was at his
[2:00:36] house. And how does it look?" Well, I
[2:00:37] mean, everything
[2:00:39] everything uh I've went to his house
[2:00:41] before. He have, you know, I don't even
[2:00:43] know what that thing mean. I don't know
[2:00:44] what this thing mean and I don't know
[2:00:46] what that mean.
[2:00:48] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:51] I was talking to somebody in a weekend.
[2:00:53] I trying to give them a picture for them
[2:00:56] to see,
[2:00:58] you know, the the the church. That's
[2:01:01] that's that those are some of the things
[2:01:02] that I say Catholicism has has really
[2:01:06] affected us because you find people that
[2:01:09] they come to church and then after a
[2:01:12] while they get they get uh they take
[2:01:14] offense.
[2:01:16] This is uh I mean uh uh nobody come
[2:01:21] nobody nobody of that church ever come
[2:01:23] to visit me.
[2:01:26] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody come to visit me you know
[2:01:30] and
[2:01:32] the people there I mean you know they
[2:01:34] take off.
[2:01:37] Now there are two ways you can look at
[2:01:39] everything.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:46] But the thing about it then is that our
[2:01:49] thing is our responsibility.
[2:01:52] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Here and wherever you go, it's your
[2:01:56] responsibility to go after what they
[2:01:59] believe.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; What is it all about?
[2:02:06] Because because
[2:02:08] if you unless unless you are just
[2:02:10] passing by and you just if you want to
[2:02:12] make the place home there is your
[2:02:15] responsibility.
[2:02:17] Don't sit back and say well you know
[2:02:19] they should come because that's what the
[2:02:22] church denomination does because we just
[2:02:25] want your presence
[2:02:27] or why were you not in church? We didn't
[2:02:31] see you this Sunday.
[2:02:34] we really miss you. And that just all
[2:02:37] the conversation stopped. Well, you
[2:02:40] know, I never came to church because of
[2:02:41] this reason or because of that reason.
[2:02:43] And it just there is no fellowship.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; There is no word in it.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; There is no word.
[2:02:53] We are just campaigning.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; There just we're just campaigning
[2:03:00] looking for members.
[2:03:02] There is no there is really no word in
[2:03:04] it. I will think that it's our
[2:03:06] responsibility
[2:03:08] to be able to go after
[2:03:11] and says I really want to GET TO THE
[2:03:13] BOTTOM OF THIS. WHY? WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
[2:03:15] SAY I MEAN WHY THEY ALWAYS SAY BROTHER
[2:03:16] Brandham say what is that all about?
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHY WHY THEY, you know, why
[2:03:27] their their women dress this way or
[2:03:29] their men dress this way. While the
[2:03:30] service is ordered like that, it's not
[2:03:32] like every other church. It is our
[2:03:34] responsibility to go after and know
[2:03:36] those things.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; I was wanting to come to my defense a
[2:03:56] little bit, but I'll leave it.
[2:03:59] I'll leave it for another time. Praise
[2:04:01] the Lord.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Because if you ever get mad in your mind
[2:04:05] and says, "Well, I don't visit you." I
[2:04:06] mean, you better understand they are
[2:04:08] tough.
[2:04:10] It has to be for the reason. I would
[2:04:13] love to do it. I would love to do it,
[2:04:15] but it have to be for the reason because
[2:04:18] there is just there just a whole lot.
[2:04:20] I'll just leave you as that.
[2:04:23] [clears throat]
[2:04:24] I love my brother who says I would love
[2:04:25] to visit you and just sit down and talk
[2:04:27] to you, you know, and just spend the
[2:04:29] whole day with you, but uh uh just have
[2:04:34] to listen.
[2:04:36] I want you to just make the list,
[2:04:39] [clears throat]
[2:04:40] make the list, have the question, call
[2:04:42] me some of me. I will show up. If I
[2:04:46] don't have an answer, I will tell you.
[2:04:48] We'll look for it. Amen.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; And it will help me also. They help me
[2:04:54] for me to grow.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; But the church is responding to her
[2:05:00] anointing. You have to realize that and
[2:05:02] you cannot do anything else. Whatever is
[2:05:06] happening like brother Brandon say
[2:05:07] Christ is the ministry of God revealed.
[2:05:09] Whatever is happening around your life
[2:05:11] that you're not understanding is God
[2:05:13] pulling you to that place for you to
[2:05:15] respond to the anointing of your diet.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; And you have to pay attention to that.
[2:05:27] You may not seem like you are in your
[2:05:29] best form. It might not look like you
[2:05:32] are over spiritual.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; But go to your motive energetic. Search
[2:05:37] your heart.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Do you still love the Lord?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; If there is if there is if there is that
[2:05:42] thing there, then there is a deep that
[2:05:45] is down there that is calling to the
[2:05:47] deep.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; And sure, there is a deep to
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; the Lord bless you.
[2:05:52] as musicians who can come.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:58] [applause]
[2:06:07] Musicians, you can come.
[2:06:11] That's the reason why I can't wait for
[2:06:13] us to for us to be able to build our
[2:06:15] church and just have a fellowship hall.
[2:06:17] Amen. we can be able to spend just
[2:06:19] enough time and get to know one another
[2:06:21] over meal. That's a good place to know
[2:06:23] one another. Over meal. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:26] And I'm sure the Lord will be able to
[2:06:28] give it to us. Amen. Let's sing that
[2:06:30] song we sang on Wednesday night. Uh uh
[2:06:34] uh getting ready to leave. Was that what
[2:06:38] we sang?

[2:16:00] There's two [music] scriptures that came
[2:16:02] to my mind
[2:16:04] in lamentation. The Bible says that his
[2:16:07] mercy is renewed every morning.
[2:16:10] And uh and [music] then I talk taught
[2:16:12] also how the ego renew her strength. So
[2:16:16] I was dwelling on the word renew as I
[2:16:19] was just meditating on the Lord and it
[2:16:22] [music] just break to my mind that every
[2:16:24] day when God give us new mercy that is
[2:16:28] strength [music] that he has given you.
[2:16:30] He has renewing your strength
[2:16:34] every day. [music] He gave us new mercy.
[2:16:38] Praise the Lord. And mercy is what we
[2:16:41] [music] don't deserve.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God gave you that to be your
[2:16:47] strength to realize that every what
[2:16:51] whatever was the foolishness you day
[2:16:53] before the the day yesterday, he comes
[2:16:55] [music and singing] down. He gave you
[2:16:56] new mercy.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; To give you strength for you to trust
[2:17:00] him. To give you strength to face your
[2:17:03] day. To give you strength [music] to
[2:17:05] come back to him. Amen.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Every new mercy,
[2:17:11] the Lord renew your strength.
[2:17:15] Showers of blessing.
[2:17:22] Show [singing] us a blessing [music]
