[51:44] Thank You musicians I'll have you back
[51:48] in few minutes here if we can just make
[51:52] this short and sweet tonight praise the
[51:57] Lord Hebrew chapter 2 praise the Lord
[52:09] you know we we sing that song when I see
[52:14] the Blood I will pass over you as if to
[52:17] say we are the one looking for the blood
[52:19] he's looking for the blood what we
[52:21] should be doing is that we should be
[52:23] listening for the blood because we have
[52:25] a blood that speak and better things
[52:27] amen we don't look to see the blood he
[52:29] looks to see the blood but we must be
[52:31] listening amen because the blood speaks
[52:37] praise the Lord
[52:39] Hebrew chapter 2 therefore we ought to
[52:45] give the most energy to the things which
[52:49] we have heard least at any time we
[52:54] should let them sleep for if the word
[52:57] spoken by angels or steadfast and every
[53:01] transgression and disobedience received
[53:04] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[53:08] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[53:14] which are the first began to be spoken
[53:18] by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by
[53:22] them that heard him father bless your
[53:27] word we are grateful Lord and we want to
[53:30] commit ourselves in your hands now the
[53:32] rest of this service in Jesus name Amen
[53:36] Allah bless you you can have your seat
[53:43] praise the Lord you know in a time of
[53:46] the exiting was gone fast
[53:49] praise the Lord amen
[53:53] everything was don't fine but you have
[53:55] to make sure that you did it right
[53:57] praise the Lord everything was done fast
[54:02] but you have to make sure that you did
[54:04] it right I just I just wanted to go over
[54:09] some few things and especially with the
[54:17] way that as a local church here we want
[54:20] to deal with what the epidemic we are
[54:26] going through and and the loss of the
[54:29] land and all of that it is strip sharor
[54:32] for us to obey the laws of the land so
[54:36] we just want to we want to go over some
[54:40] few things here we will I mean
[54:43] repeat some of them on on Sunday but
[54:46] just like you saw we try to send some
[54:49] text messages out before the service you
[54:53] can look forward for more of him as as
[54:57] the days goes by then and more when when
[55:01] we hear from from the governor you know
[55:05] the major of the city in order you want
[55:08] to make sure that we are obeying their
[55:11] part of God's Word praise the Lord
[55:14] you know it is so easy for many of us
[55:17] you know you go you read a lot of the
[55:19] Watts up messages that is coming you
[55:22] read a lot of the things you know the
[55:23] believers are posting and wish of course
[55:29] they are grading you know people going
[55:32] back in and posting coats or Burt
[55:35] Brennan talk about plagues and he talked
[55:38] about fear and he talks about all of
[55:41] these different things you see and that
[55:44] was the thing that kind of awestruck my
[55:46] heart just at the time we started
[55:48] singing you know and singing about a
[55:50] loaf of God you just you just come to
[55:54] turn
[55:55] terms with how it was in Goshen you know
[56:00] and and you know how it was with these
[56:05] people there in Goshen and yearly from
[56:07] afar mother streaming crying you know
[56:11] the first bond is dating and and and I
[56:15] mean another one is second and he's
[56:18] almost going and I mean all the
[56:20] physician there in Egypt were all
[56:22] running up and down to see how they
[56:24] could save the situation but it was
[56:27] God's wrath amen praise the Lord it's
[56:31] never it's not something that we have to
[56:35] be tell us about in the sense of what we
[56:41] think we can boast about where we think
[56:44] we can laugh about it's something really
[56:47] that is going on you know and and in one
[56:53] way we have to we have to identify with
[56:57] it you know net identifying with the
[57:01] fear but identifying that this thing is
[57:04] real it's causing family lives it's
[57:11] putting pressure on families now
[57:18] sometimes we just think as believers we
[57:20] are just in a bubble that is just going
[57:23] free and you know and and I don't think
[57:27] that is the kind of attitude that that
[57:30] God want us to have in time like this
[57:33] doing the floor brother branham was on
[57:35] the boat up and down the river trying to
[57:39] save people you know he could say well
[57:42] this is judgment God's judgment I'm
[57:44] going down in the mountains to go and
[57:45] seek the face of God we have to deal
[57:50] with it it's real
[57:58] and we've there been said a few things
[58:07] just like some of you saw we we try to
[58:12] put up signs and make sure that as we
[58:16] come through the church before we get in
[58:20] here we can go to the bathroom and wash
[58:23] our hands you know just for the fact
[58:27] that we all fellowship in here we are
[58:30] clapping our hands and you want to give
[58:33] a brother the handshake we want to just
[58:34] make sure that we all go through you
[58:38] know the restaurant wash our hands and
[58:40] then we can come right in here
[58:41] the best way we can do it in this I mean
[58:44] that is the way we should treat it every
[58:45] word I think a good hand-washing goes a
[58:49] long way
[58:50] praise the Lord I don't know whether
[58:56] it's a habit we were getting away from
[58:58] and God has to bring her back to it
[59:04] praise the Lord I'm telling you when
[59:07] this thing is done some people would get
[59:09] good hand-washing then we wash their
[59:13] hands I'm going to go through every door
[59:15] Amy praise the Lord and until we heard a
[59:26] word were they I mean they close down
[59:28] every this morning brother job he asked
[59:30] her with Amy attacks and there came out
[59:35] of Louisiana at a live table and I go
[59:38] down there as you believe there should
[59:40] be the same old life tabernacle or the
[59:42] church by the name of that word the
[59:46] police went in and met the pastor and an
[59:50] axe him there their shoes I mean they
[59:52] should close their service and if they
[59:54] don't he's going to ask the National guy
[59:57] to come in make sure that their service
[59:59] is shut down if every word is shut down
[1:00:01] why are they gathering people together
[1:00:03] you know so we might we might get to
[1:00:06] that place and if and if we get to that
[1:00:09] place we
[1:00:10] try to make sure that we can be able to
[1:00:12] that's you know we can we can be so glad
[1:00:16] that we have all of these brothers but
[1:00:19] Angela's brother Jordan brother Lord and
[1:00:22] every one of them that put in the time
[1:00:24] to be able to give us this little
[1:00:27] YouTube channel or website we have where
[1:00:31] we can be able to have our selves glory
[1:00:33] in life and we will be talking to fuel
[1:00:37] the brothers right after the service
[1:00:38] year but what we would like to do and
[1:00:41] you will hear more after we get talking
[1:00:45] with them we have in our Sunday school
[1:00:49] glory on the tape of demonology it's
[1:00:52] very strange before I left I spoke with
[1:00:55] brother Dan and spoke with brother
[1:00:56] Jordan and Tobler Jordan and I was
[1:00:58] thinking on I was playing the message
[1:01:00] impersonation of Christianity that's
[1:01:02] what I told we were going to study and
[1:01:05] while I was on my way I was actually on
[1:01:07] the flooding and and for some reason
[1:01:10] demonology just hit me there is
[1:01:13] something in the subject of demonology
[1:01:16] that hit me so I said well okay I'll
[1:01:18] take the time and and kind of a review
[1:01:20] over the entire series since I'm having
[1:01:22] this long fly you know went through
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:27] physical RAM got a rest and started on a
[1:01:32] spiritual Ram you know and then right
[1:01:36] there I just I just felt convinced in my
[1:01:39] heart as it's a well I think we need to
[1:01:41] play demonology so when I got got home
[1:01:43] there text birth Jordan and says well
[1:01:47] you know if we can start on this
[1:01:49] demonology series I just believe that it
[1:01:52] was the Lord he men speaking with
[1:01:55] brother Wesley yesterday and he was
[1:01:57] commenting a little bit on there you
[1:01:59] know just just to see they are we
[1:02:01] dealing with all of this and I mean as a
[1:02:04] church we are going through the end I
[1:02:06] know some people can make it for the
[1:02:08] sunday school but we have you know the
[1:02:11] Sunday school projected through the
[1:02:15] YouTube channel or the church website
[1:02:18] you can be able to follow it and even if
[1:02:22] you know
[1:02:23] whether you follow it or net you know is
[1:02:27] something different when we all listen
[1:02:30] to it as a congregation and it's also
[1:02:32] different when you get back and just
[1:02:34] take that message and go over any game
[1:02:37] praise the Lord they're things that
[1:02:38] brother Branham dealing with in that
[1:02:40] message we'll have time to pick up some
[1:02:42] of them as we go along
[1:02:44] praise the Lord because we have to
[1:02:47] realize he says the lead has been taken
[1:02:50] off of Hell and demons are sprinkling I
[1:02:54] mean streaming into the earth you know
[1:02:57] we we are faced with them every day in
[1:03:00] different in different ways never have
[1:03:03] been a time where we had my battles I
[1:03:05] mean discouragement and little things so
[1:03:08] to make you never seem a little things
[1:03:11] to make you angry than all of these
[1:03:13] things we have to guide our spirit we
[1:03:16] have a treasure inside that we have to
[1:03:19] God praise the Lord so we will have the
[1:03:28] we will go through that their series of
[1:03:32] demonology and then what we will do is
[1:03:39] there if the brothers agree with me then
[1:03:43] you heard it from me if they don't agree
[1:03:45] with me then what I'm telling you you
[1:03:47] did not hear it
[1:03:55] praise the Lord but what I'm thinking
[1:04:00] about is is for us to open the doors by
[1:04:04] the eleven o'clock or a few minutes to
[1:04:06] eleven o'clock we can play the the
[1:04:12] sunday-school through the tapes maybe
[1:04:14] the musicians can come in early you know
[1:04:18] and a few of the people the scenes that
[1:04:21] would love to come in early that were
[1:04:23] just we just have to go through that
[1:04:25] with the brothers because and in one
[1:04:29] sense too it does not make sense to
[1:04:31] eliminate or stop everybody because
[1:04:33] everybody stay don't come
[1:04:35] you know so if the few that would come
[1:04:40] will come for the Sunday school I think
[1:04:42] we would keep it that way so you didn't
[1:04:44] hear nothing from me and until I talk to
[1:04:48] them
[1:04:48] praise the Lord but it is just all for
[1:04:52] us to be able to keep ourselves in a way
[1:04:55] that we were net you know cause cry on
[1:05:01] us amen we believe that every brother
[1:05:05] and sister is taking enough precaution
[1:05:08] you know so we don't believe that
[1:05:10] anybody is running in you know anybody
[1:05:12] is going to contaminate another person
[1:05:14] what my mind is all about is having a
[1:05:19] crowd here and you know a law
[1:05:22] enforcement or somebody from outside
[1:05:24] realized that group of people a
[1:05:26] gathering that's that's where my mind is
[1:05:28] I'm not I'm not thinking about somebody
[1:05:31] here could contaminate somebody that's
[1:05:33] not what I'm thinking about I'm just
[1:05:35] thinking about you know being being
[1:05:39] cautious of what people out there think
[1:05:42] you know and in pretty soon you know it
[1:05:47] might give us a talk of being fanatic
[1:05:49] see people are fanatics they don't
[1:05:51] believe nothing you know in order there
[1:05:52] so that's what my mind is but we will I
[1:05:56] mean whatever information we have we
[1:06:00] would definitely bring that out to you I
[1:06:03] was trying to do my best
[1:06:04] like I said to the brothers who try to
[1:06:07] keep the service shot as much as we can
[1:06:09] and I would say that was a good
[1:06:12] atmosphere in here tonight amen
[1:06:14] praise the Lord amen I sure want to
[1:06:19] believe that it came from from from the
[1:06:22] turn of the law but I want to just go
[1:06:24] over this thought that we were speaking
[1:06:27] about on
[1:06:35] on Sunday and I show taught that of a
[1:06:43] pickup or a cold wobbler Branum
[1:06:49] canna for reef air Ruth chapter 2 Ruth
[1:06:58] chapter 2
[1:07:15] praise the Lord
[1:07:22] what a wonderful father we self rule
[1:07:28] chapter 2
[1:07:37] now the scripture speaks here we're
[1:07:42] talking about just recompense and I know
[1:07:48] I was kind of a struggling between many
[1:07:53] thoughts and I don't know if I was able
[1:07:57] to help you to see what I was talking
[1:07:58] about but this I was listening to a
[1:08:04] testimony of her brother and let me let
[1:08:07] me share it was this is a minister their
[1:08:21] family went through a rough time and mom
[1:08:25] and dad had to divorce and and it hurt
[1:08:31] the family hurt the children most
[1:08:34] especially the girls
[1:08:36] when you know the day I was not around
[1:08:39] to be able to teach them things that it
[1:08:42] was supposed to to learn so with with
[1:08:47] that experience I mean they went on and
[1:08:50] on and on and I mean they all grew up in
[1:08:53] God my reading I mean try to save the
[1:08:56] Lord their back slighted and everything
[1:09:00] but I think it was in the last three
[1:09:07] weeks of his life he called his family
[1:09:16] to to his sickbed and then as as the
[1:09:26] children would testify most especially
[1:09:28] the girls
[1:09:29] he said this was the first time that
[1:09:33] Adele will look into their eyes and
[1:09:39] apologize and said I'm sorry for all
[1:09:44] I've caused you people
[1:09:52] and I mean and I call it to the brother
[1:09:56] he said there with with tears in his
[1:09:59] eyes tears streaming down his eyes he
[1:10:02] says right there his two sister bursted
[1:10:04] and he started crying you know because
[1:10:09] this was this was what they have whiffle
[1:10:13] you know all of their teenage years and
[1:10:17] now they have grown they have waited for
[1:10:20] this for their father to see this his
[1:10:23] words but what happened was when he said
[1:10:30] that something happened ending something
[1:10:43] happened inside of him there for the
[1:10:47] last three weeks of his life he gave us
[1:10:52] wanted to spend all the time that they
[1:10:55] have lost all the time that he have lost
[1:11:02] and what I'm talking about here is is is
[1:11:06] just recompense like I took the teeth on
[1:11:13] the cross he might have said something
[1:11:18] right that God who overlooked all that
[1:11:28] he have done to give him the equal of
[1:11:35] those that have been saved all of their
[1:11:38] life
[1:11:45] praise the Lord
[1:11:50] I mean these things are not things that
[1:11:53] you recite enough things that you
[1:11:59] I mean you memorize all you premeditate
[1:12:04] on there are things that comes from the
[1:12:06] soul it comes from the inside part and
[1:12:15] as this brother who tell their family
[1:12:21] testimony how I mean the next time they
[1:12:27] he went there and met his sister's
[1:12:29] visiting their dad they singing those
[1:12:32] old son in school sounds and he just
[1:12:37] bawling just crying lying on the bed and
[1:12:40] tears just rolling down his eyes and the
[1:12:43] girls just crying and remember in Sunday
[1:12:46] school days and and and I mean God was
[1:12:49] doing an inner work he was doing an
[1:12:52] inner healing because a genuine art has
[1:12:58] repented to a Janu hurt
[1:13:03] it was the hurt was general as the
[1:13:09] repentance of the heart and when the
[1:13:15] bottom met they just melted they just
[1:13:19] blend it and healing starts to take
[1:13:24] place
[1:13:32] he he repented gave his heart back to
[1:13:35] the Lord and then after three weeks he
[1:13:39] was gone
[1:13:43] praise the Lord
[1:13:46] Ruth chapter 2 the Bible says and the
[1:13:50] Lord verse 12 the Lord recompense that
[1:13:54] work this is Boris speaking to Ruth the
[1:13:58] Lord recompense that work and a full
[1:14:02] reward be giving being of the Lord God
[1:14:08] of Israel all know whose wings thou has
[1:14:15] come to trust praise the Lord
[1:14:23] can we read that verse together it
[1:14:25] sounds so beautiful just now the Lord
[1:14:31] recommends that work and a full reward
[1:14:36] be giving be of the God the Lord God of
[1:14:40] Israel all know whose wings thou I come
[1:14:45] to trust little bit she know that day
[1:14:52] when she look at now me in the face and
[1:14:55] say your God will be my god your people
[1:15:01] will be my people that was not a light
[1:15:06] word that was something that was coming
[1:15:08] from the inside she didn't know that she
[1:15:11] will be hid it her she will be the talk
[1:15:14] of the town she never even consider that
[1:15:20] in the Lord of God her her trouble birth
[1:15:26] was an abomination to God I mean she
[1:15:35] came from a bloodline that was an
[1:15:37] abomination to God
[1:15:40] look that is the place where God goes
[1:15:44] back and he rewrite his own Lord he
[1:15:49] rewrites he he take a pen
[1:15:53] I know where on my face okay I having
[1:15:54] one year and he goes back on the verse
[1:16:04] because that was his word no child of
[1:16:11] the Moabites must come into the
[1:16:12] congregation what year is so
[1:16:23] representation by predestination and so
[1:16:27] crying out to God and said the right
[1:16:30] thing
[1:16:34] praise the Lord and God will give her a
[1:16:38] just recompense he would come her in the
[1:16:44] lineage of the Messiah because she said
[1:16:49] the right thing
[1:16:56] praise Lord amen
[1:17:05] it's just like a man born an American
[1:17:10] citizen he has all the rights all the
[1:17:15] rights that are written in the book in
[1:17:18] the Constitution but when that man goes
[1:17:22] to commit a felony in a committed crime
[1:17:27] that drops him from their Lord and he
[1:17:31] put into prison now he came vote because
[1:17:35] he have committed a crime they have
[1:17:37] taken that right back from him even
[1:17:41] though he stayed an American citizen but
[1:17:44] now he has loose setting right now that
[1:17:48] was where I was bringing equity and
[1:17:52] iniquity praise the Lord because brother
[1:18:03] Branham over and over he deal with that
[1:18:04] more and more over immersion divorce as
[1:18:07] he was trying to lay the principle in
[1:18:11] the beginning it was not so he show us
[1:18:14] how how right from the beginning Adam
[1:18:20] and Eve were cold equal amen they were
[1:18:28] cold equal when a word when she broke
[1:18:32] the word she lost that I call equalness
[1:18:38] Amen even though the Lord of Redemption
[1:18:44] was given to her I said this over and
[1:18:48] over his lama saber burnham said it in
[1:18:50] invincible union he says that was the
[1:18:53] reason why God gave her the three
[1:18:55] sacrifice because he had a lot of
[1:18:57] redemption in the woman that's why he
[1:19:02] says the woman si would bruise the head
[1:19:04] of the serpent that's what he said
[1:19:06] praise the Lord and even though the Lord
[1:19:14] of redemption is giving to her
[1:19:18] and God gave her all of these this
[1:19:21] blessed veteran and gave her all of
[1:19:23] these these wonderful character but yet
[1:19:28] because of that of that Genesis chapter
[1:19:35] three experience
[1:19:37] she dropped from that place now you see
[1:19:40] so it takes the man to bring her back
[1:19:45] then she can get there because of her
[1:19:47] education she can get there because of
[1:19:50] the pay to pay her she can get there
[1:19:52] because of what united nation says the
[1:19:56] way that she can get there is submission
[1:19:59] to the word amen and the love of the
[1:20:04] word will raise her to that place are we
[1:20:08] together just like I said the man is
[1:20:12] broken the woman she's hard because
[1:20:16] she's taken out of that out of that
[1:20:18] broken part of the man so she having so
[1:20:21] much strength but God is is is requiring
[1:20:24] her to submit that strength
[1:20:28] amen to that broken vessel where he took
[1:20:32] her from and the grace to do that that's
[1:20:37] the power of the church the grace I was
[1:20:42] just thinking about that last night and
[1:20:44] I the grace word we can submit our gift
[1:20:48] to the word we can submit our talent to
[1:20:51] the world we are able to submit
[1:20:53] everything we have to the word because
[1:20:58] sometimes gift can be a dangerous thing
[1:21:01] amen people have gifts and and and and
[1:21:07] and because their gifts is so wonderful
[1:21:12] they tried to take it above the world
[1:21:18] are we together
[1:21:24] just recompense he is a just God prays
[1:21:30] alone he isn't just God he will not
[1:21:34] forget your liver of love he will reward
[1:21:41] them that diligently seek Him
[1:21:43] now that word diligently has been put
[1:21:47] into a word of works and people think
[1:21:51] you have to work and work and work and
[1:21:53] work no and they worked himself out of
[1:21:55] the scripture they worked himself
[1:21:57] breaking God's laws because they want to
[1:22:00] be gain favor with God Ruth doing this
[1:22:06] she was not seeking to gain favor with
[1:22:08] God now he has to her I'm old I will not
[1:22:15] be able to have a child anymore I give
[1:22:20] you my blessings you can go and live
[1:22:23] your life I want you to be happy
[1:22:28] Shema I have told her you know if we get
[1:22:32] back down there oh my goodness
[1:22:34] thinking all in her mind what people who
[1:22:36] said and and she already know that she
[1:22:39] having a lot of questions to go in
[1:22:40] answer because she left with her husband
[1:22:42] and sons and now she is going back and
[1:22:45] then after answering all of those
[1:22:47] questions she also have to now talk
[1:22:49] about a more about that she had brought
[1:22:55] praise the Lord no no I don't add to my
[1:22:59] questions I don't believe she said that
[1:23:01] to her but I mean just allowing them to
[1:23:04] God praise the Lord just like the words
[1:23:11] of Peter who will we go to
[1:23:20] when Peter said those words Oh will we
[1:23:24] go to four in you we have found internal
[1:23:33] life this this is the man that would
[1:23:41] deny Jesus I mean but you see when those
[1:23:48] things come out of inspiration when it's
[1:23:53] not something that you have premeditated
[1:23:55] on and you have plaster with Scripture
[1:23:57] and plaster with court and and then just
[1:24:00] drag everything together but something
[1:24:05] that comes from the human soul and that
[1:24:12] is the reason why - nada
[1:24:14] you know I really enjoyed that woman
[1:24:16] getting into prayer and just going
[1:24:19] inside and feeling God's love inside the
[1:24:26] jaw that it gives to know that I am a
[1:24:29] son of God the inner feeling not the
[1:24:39] names we put on our forehead or the ones
[1:24:41] who write on our back but the feeling
[1:24:43] that is inside praise the Lord
[1:25:00] the Lord recompense that work and a for
[1:25:06] reward be giving me of the Lord God of
[1:25:11] Israel owner whose wings
[1:25:15] there are come to trust little did she
[1:25:23] know that when she said your God will be
[1:25:28] my god
[1:25:30] little did she know that she has trusted
[1:25:36] herself she has cast herself right under
[1:25:41] the wings of Jehovah no matter what
[1:25:44] happened to me no matter what name they
[1:25:47] call me no matter what they say to me
[1:25:51] your God will be my god and your people
[1:25:57] will be my people how will her people be
[1:26:02] and now many people will be her people
[1:26:05] unless she's redeemed unless she's
[1:26:10] brought under the Covenant of Abraham so
[1:26:13] even right their honor inspiration she
[1:26:16] was prophesying and we can stand right
