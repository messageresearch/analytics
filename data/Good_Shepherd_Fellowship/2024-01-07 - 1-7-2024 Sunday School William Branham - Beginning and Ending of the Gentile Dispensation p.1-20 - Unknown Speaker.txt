========================================

e somebody that will stand by you a real good friend oh my in foreign lands when you find someone who wants to be your buddy and loves you and stands by you that's worth so much especially a stranger and these Brethren were taken away from their city and their city was burned and all their vessels and the holy things of God have been taken down into Babylon and was put into the Treasure House of King Nebuchadnezzar who had carried out a great grand Gentile King now if if God has permitted that for their City to be burned their church burned and taking them down into the city it was because that they had got away from God but he still had a believer that he could put his hands on and say this is my servant God has always had a witness somewhere amen he never leaves himself without a witness no matter it's got down sometime to just one but he's always had somebody that he could put his hands on and say this is my servant and he'll do as I tell him now we like that noticing then that when these Brethren were down there they were put to a test very beautiful example of what a True Believer comes to when he really accepts the Lord Jesus as his savior he's always put to a test amen Satan still in the testing business and it only comes about to help you it's for your good amen every son that cometh to God must be tried chasen scorched and other words give a little threshing straighten it up and if God gives us some chastisement and we can't stand it then we become illegitimate children and not the children of God now a man that's really got his face set towards heaven no matter what takes place here on Earth he still got his face set towards heaven his friends May forsake Him his family may forsake Him his Pastor May forsake Him but there's one that won't forsake Him that's God and when your mind is made up I like that Daniel had burned all the bridges behind him he wasn't planning on going back anymore amen he wasn't watching his back Trail he was looking forsaking those things which are in the past he pressed on to the mark of the High Calling that's what we should be doing that's what the church should be doing and as I noticed then God God permitted Satan to give him the test and all they tested him by the fire they tested him also by the lons then and in every instant God brought them out more than Victorious many are the testings of the righteous but God deliver him out of them all amen how marvelous that is how we appreciate that trials tribulations tests all working for the the good amen after a while God can see then and he can put his trust in you and then he'll do great things for you now we find out then that Daniel became an instrument in the hand of God while he was away from his own people out of his own City away from his own church in a Strange Land God used him now you can be away from whatever you may be you can be away from all your love Lov ones or you can be away from your church but you can still be an instrument in the hands of God God can use you for our testimony or for anything that he wishes to use you for beautiful examples the Bible's just so chug full of those things everywhere you turn don't you love to read the word oh I just read it sometime and week here a few days ago I was reading in the room there and I just had to sit down and cry like a baby I got up and walked around my chair put my hand on my chair looked down my Bible again I just broke out went around the chair again looked back at it again I thought oh God in there is eternal life amen to every man or woman that'll dare to put their trust in it and believe it eternal life and he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me yes search the scripture the word of God is a lamp unto our feet that we if we should be guided then it's the light that follows the pathway that leads us from Victory onto Victory am now before you can have a victory there has to be a battle and if there's no battles there's no victories so we are to be thankful for the battles and the trying it's God giving us the opportunity to have victories oh my don't that make it a little bit better now see the battle come along somebody saying something bad about you sickness come on to you maybe God give you those light afflictions that he might heal you and show his favor to you let you see what he means about he loves you amen the old Shepherd story that was told there in Jerusalem in the Holy lands of the sheep but is packing a a sheep and he said what you packing it for say it's got a broken leg said how to do that fall over cliff said no I broke its leg he said well you're a cruel Shepherd to break that sheep's leg said no I loved it and said it was going astray and I couldn't make it mind me so I broke its leg so I could give it some extra tension so then it would love me and follow me sometime God has to let us break down just a little bit in health to give us a little extra tension to get us up on his lap to wo us up in his bosom when the doctor said nothing can be done then he take us into his bosom say see I love you I'm going to let you get well oh doesn't that just make life a little better amen oh he's so great he's a marvelous Shepherd isn't he no wonder David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want how he leads us for the side of the Still Waters and restores her soul and runs our cups over and and anoints us in the presence of the enemy did you ever get anointed in the presence of your enemy just to testify to your cup just borrowed over you know just how marvelous it is to be anointed in the presence of your enemy now notice then God took King Nebuchadnezzar and made him a tool in his hand and when King Nebuchadnezzar died after he had the grass grew out he haired like lion like eagle feathers and his fingernails like the claws of the eagle and so forth and God had to let him know who was the real king after his death Belta seure his grandson s succeeded him and then he was more wicked than King Nebuchadnezzar and one night there they had a great big party they called all their their maestrat and all the officers in for our great big jamere and while they were having this jamere and they were went and called out and Tuck the vessels the holy vessels of God just to make fun of God and drink wine to their gods a toast out of the vessels of the Lord now a man is permitted to travel so far but there's a separating line between life and death you must never cross that see you can go on with your little foolishness for a while but you better know where the line is did the Lord ever check you on anything he does all of us pull the check ring say that's far enough now then you better watch what you're doing from that on if you're stepping across towards that line and that night when God pull the check greins on him and he wouldn't listen goes on down and brings out the vessels of the Lord begin to drink W wine and them toast to their gods then there came a hand down out of heaven and wrote on the wall teeny teeny tech praia means th we in the boun and found wanting no one could interpret it it was unknown tongues and there was a man there had the gift of interpretation Daniel so he comes down and interprets and tells the king what would happened and there God destroyed that Nation amen Babylon while Daniel being there he saw great visions and wrote concerning them for this great consolation that we have today knowing and setting in order the end of the Gentile Kingdom amen notice how perfect just get it close now he's seen first the image standing in the field when he interpret the dream of the king he was a spiritual man he dreamed dreams saw Visions interpret dreams God was with him and everyone knew that too and when he saw the vision the head of gold and the breast chair of silver and the thighs of brass and the feet of iron notice each kingdom got a little harder King Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom was a head of gold he interpreted told him just exactly how those kingdoms would succeed each other unto the end then notice from gold is the softest silver is next then brass is next then iron is next harder harder colder farther away notice then in the midst of all that Daniel beheld the image until a storm would shoot out of the mountain that was cut out without hands it rolled into the image and broke it and made it like wheat on the summer flash thrashing floor and the Winds Drive away and the stone grew into a great Mountain that covered all the earth and the sea that was the coming of the Lord Jesus which is now at hand amen he goes on when he was down by the river one day he fell into a trance and saw a vision many of those was with him they didn't see the vision for it was given only to Daniel you see it someone can stand right next to you and see things that you can't see to save your life right someone said I don't believe that I never seen nothing because it wasn't for you to see it amen then it went with Paul when Paul was struck off of his hearts and had to fall onto the dirt and water as it was on the dirt none of them heard that voice or seen that Vision Paul saw it none of them saw the star of the cross the every Observatory but the wise man many things that way God has designated for certain peoples to see and others cannot see amen oh I love that when God in his infant wisdom has predestinated or for ordained for certain things to happen it can happen to the person sitting right next to you and you'll know nothing about it amen amen look at dolin when Elijah was down at dolin and there was all surrounded there by the by the aliens that come in the Syrian Army looking for Elijah the prophet for when they begin to find out every time the syrians had come over to Israel to make war why the Israelites would be laying for and so the king of Syria called him up and said now wait a minute who is for us and who's for Israel said somebody in my group is a spy that's going to tell Israel just where we're coming in at for they're always there waiting for us and one man had a little spirituality about him he said nay my father but it's a Prophet Elijah amen for he knows in his bedroom what you're going to make your move next amen amen oh when Atomic Powers begin to shake I'm so happy that the word of God has tell us where to go to flee to the Rock Christ Jesus every man in it is safe and secured nothing can harm you no atomic bombs no Cobalts nothing else can touch the preserved of God Amen safe secure anchored what a marvelous hope amen that we have in Christ [Music] [Music] Jesus
