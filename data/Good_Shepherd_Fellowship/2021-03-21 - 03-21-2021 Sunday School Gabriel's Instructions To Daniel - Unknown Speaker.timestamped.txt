[0:01] [Music]
[0:11] morning
[0:12] but very glorious to be here so glad
[0:16] that we could
[0:18] get in today for this service and uh
[0:22] i've given out that i have a study now
[0:25] on this 70 weeks of daniel
[0:28] that ties in the rest of the message
[0:30] before i can go with the
[0:32] the seven seals which is seven seals
[0:34] seven flags seven
[0:36] trump is three wolves a woman in the sun
[0:39] casting out the red devils 144 000
[0:43] sealed away all happens between this
[0:45] time
[0:46] and i thought i'd have to get this in
[0:48] first
[0:50] now it's hot we don't aim to stay too
[0:53] long
[0:53] just as as we can and this is the season
[0:56] usually
[0:57] off season that when people don't
[1:00] have church too often and
[1:03] especially all of them got
[1:04] air-conditioned rooms and so forth where
[1:07] it's comfortable we wish we had that
[1:09] but at this time we don't have it many
[1:12] of our forefathers
[1:14] set out in a hot sun when i think of
[1:17] apologizing to the people for not having
[1:19] our air-conditioned room
[1:21] my thoughts always drift back to africa
[1:24] where they laid there in those storms
[1:26] and them
[1:27] women with their hair hanging down in
[1:28] their face lay there both day and night
[1:32] never leave the spot from where they're
[1:33] laying
[1:35] don't eat drink nor nothing stay right
[1:37] there just to catch a word or two now i
[1:39] name
[1:40] of the lord i can think of mexico when
[1:42] it's so hot
[1:44] but honestly i sat in an air conditioned
[1:46] room and tried to fan myself it was a
[1:48] hot
[1:49] and see them people come there at nine
[1:51] o'clock in the morning in that big arena
[1:53] and no seats to sit down sick people
[1:56] real sick dying sick cancer
[1:59] tumor sick mothers little dying babies
[2:03] and everything
[2:03] stand right down that barling hot sun
[2:06] not a shade nowhere
[2:07] and just lean against one another from
[2:09] nine o'clock at morning till nine that
[2:11] night
[2:12] just to hear 30 minutes to an
[2:14] interpreter and see the works of the
[2:16] lord
[2:18] set their weight big old heavy garments
[2:21] only wear them winter in summer it's all
[2:23] they got
[2:25] and then i think of laying out there in
[2:26] those jungles how they'd bring those
[2:28] sick people in it couldn't even move in
[2:30] an
[2:30] india one that piled one down then lay
[2:33] one on top of that and one on top of
[2:35] that one like that with leprosy
[2:38] and diseases where they drag them
[2:39] through and out of the streets and lay
[2:41] them in that hot
[2:42] barley tropical suns and the storms and
[2:46] lightning of flashing and things like
[2:48] that they'd lay
[2:50] right there in that sun and storm and
[2:52] everything and never move or complain
[2:55] just to try to catch a word of god now
[2:57] and man
[2:58] something for their soul and why should
[3:00] we apologize this morning with a roof
[3:02] over our heads fans are going we should
[3:05] be ashamed if we
[3:06] complain about it amen so i remember not
[3:10] long ago in an
[3:11] island one of the islands out in the
[3:12] south seas
[3:14] i was having a service there that night
[3:17] and oh i'd come up a storm
[3:19] oh i never seen such a storm this one
[3:23] flash of lightning after the other uh
[3:25] lighten up the country and
[3:27] how the winds are blowing until the
[3:30] trees was laying right on the ground i
[3:31] said well there
[3:32] i might as well take off my suit because
[3:35] there'll be nobody down there
[3:36] in a few moments the little car backed
[3:38] up the door and someone knocked at the
[3:40] door
[3:41] ready to go and i said to the boy you
[3:43] can speak english i said anybody down
[3:45] there
[3:46] said you can't even get within city
[3:48] blocks of the place
[3:50] i'm on a big ball park and i said do you
[3:53] mean that the people are
[3:55] are out there like that i said all this
[3:57] storm they said
[3:58] they want to hear about god
[4:02] and so uh i went down there and there
[4:05] were
[4:06] ladies young girls teenagers not
[4:08] sniggering life
[4:09] and popping chewing gum talking about
[4:11] their boyfriend
[4:13] every word they just lay on to it never
[4:17] move just sit and listen make an old
[4:19] recall
[4:20] make this on all our call and thousands
[4:22] raised with tears streaking out of their
[4:24] eyes like that with their hands up to
[4:26] god wanting mercy
[4:28] for their soul young girls and boys 17
[4:30] 18 years old
[4:33] now it's kind of hard to get the old
[4:35] folks to even listen you see
[4:37] it's it's uh shows that we haven't got
[4:39] nothing to complain about
[4:40] thanks be to god yes sir we'd like to
[4:44] have it all modern like the rest of
[4:46] america but
[4:47] we haven't got it that way so we'll just
[4:48] make out what we got amen
[4:51] now i got a little thing that i noticed
[4:55] that i'd like to do here in the
[4:56] tabernacle again
[4:57] how many's got bibles raise your hand
[5:00] good
[5:00] let's turn to psalms 99
[5:05] before we have prayer
[5:08] we used to do this brother neville years
[5:11] ago
[5:12] i don't know have you already read a
[5:14] psalm this morning
[5:16] i'd just like to the congregation to
[5:18] read some of the psalms
[5:20] this morning when i was sitting in my
[5:22] study room
[5:23] meditating on this message and word i
[5:26] thought you know it'd be good again to
[5:27] have
[5:28] i'm all to read a psalm
[5:31] i like it so well the reason i was just
[5:34] a little late
[5:35] a long distance called them in cheyenne
[5:38] so that's reason i was
[5:40] and now while we're turning to this
[5:43] psalm i have some
[5:44] announcements to be made it would just
[5:48] give me that psalms
[5:50] 99. from it's
[5:53] all announcements concerning meetings
[5:55] here at the tabernacle
[5:57] and in the campaigns will come from the
[6:00] office
[6:01] at jeffersonville anyone desiring to
[6:04] know of the meetings
[6:06] must file out or give their name and
[6:08] address
[6:09] and lay it on the pulpit at the close of
[6:12] the service
[6:14] tonight a notice will be sent to you
[6:19] in time for you to make arrangements for
[6:23] to attend the meetings that is if
[6:26] anybody
[6:27] in the future wants to know just where
[6:30] we're going to have meetings
[6:32] we have a system set up at the office
[6:34] out there now that
[6:35] you can just lay your name and address
[6:38] here and we'll send you a card
[6:40] ahead of time so that you'll know where
[6:42] the meetings are going on
[6:43] and probably the subjects and what more
[6:45] there is if you could
[6:47] get a chance you see if you don't have
[6:49] some official place it comes from
[6:51] one says this and one says that you you
[6:53] don't get it you see
[6:54] so just let make out your name and
[6:56] address and lay it up here
[6:58] and billy paul will pick it up and we'll
[7:01] give it out now it was asked also
[7:05] if there will be any more brother brain
[7:07] would
[7:08] have any more healing services in the
[7:10] tabernacle with
[7:12] discernments no
[7:15] know that discernments will be given by
[7:18] by our other board we have a brother
[7:21] neville here now who has
[7:23] a gift of prophecy that prophesies over
[7:26] the sick and makes known to them
[7:29] the things that they have need of
[7:30] knowing and we have a brother by the
[7:32] name of
[7:33] hick higginbotham one of the was a
[7:36] trustee
[7:36] served faithy on the border don't see
[7:38] him this morning but
[7:40] he usually has a gift of speaking in
[7:42] tongues and a little lady named oregon
[7:44] bride
[7:46] lovely little sister who has a gift of
[7:49] interpretation of tongues
[7:51] and these messages are proving out to be
[7:54] of god because they are actually
[7:58] not not coming out of order they're just
[8:01] set in order and soon as these gifts
[8:05] begin to accumulate we're going to try
[8:07] to
[8:08] to get the to get it set right back into
[8:11] the church way of doing it
[8:12] and i'm to see them pretty soon and uh
[8:16] so that the
[8:17] at the the meetings will be carried on
[8:19] just perfectly
[8:20] in the order of the lord as we can get
[8:23] it perfectly
[8:24] but these dear people so says my
[8:27] neighbor mrs woods who
[8:29] has a microphone hooked up here and a
[8:31] tape back there to take the meetings
[8:33] just
[8:34] purposely to get those messages
[8:37] and write them down and see whether they
[8:39] are right or not
[8:41] that's how she's checking them i know
[8:43] mrs woods to be an honest woman
[8:45] and she's telling me of many things
[8:47] that's been said are coming to pass
[8:50] now so we're grateful for that what a
[8:53] relief that is for me at home when i
[8:55] come in home
[8:56] then that discernment on the prophetic
[8:58] side just tears me down
[9:00] and therefore god has sent me some
[9:02] relief for that
[9:04] through a prophecy and speaking in films
[9:07] and interpretation which
[9:09] is prophecy which is prophecy to speak
[9:12] in tongues as two different people
[9:13] prophesying one speaking
[9:15] the other understanding what the ones
[9:17] saying in unknown tongues is exactly
[9:19] prophecy
[9:20] and now we'll be we have that every day
[9:23] every meeting here when we have our
[9:25] prayer lines in the meeting
[9:27] now that someone then would ask did
[9:30] about the gift yes i still haven't
[9:33] but that only way i use it is on private
[9:37] uh interviews which i have and to obtain
[9:40] them
[9:41] i believe the god on the bulletin board
[9:43] back there to get
[9:44] permission and set your time in order by
[9:47] billy paul my boy
[9:49] for here are in the meetings after this
[9:51] out in the fields anywhere
[9:53] you must have a little card that billy
[9:55] paul will give you
[9:56] if there's something in life that you
[9:58] cannot understand and don't know how to
[10:00] get out of it
[10:01] and you're seeking the wisdom of the
[10:02] lord then
[10:04] let see billy paul my son which is the
[10:06] secretary
[10:07] and he will give you a little card and
[10:10] set you a date
[10:11] at a time and then when we're having
[10:14] those interviews then that will be when
[10:15] we'll go in together just
[10:17] you and i and if it's women coming
[10:20] you'll go with me and my wife
[10:21] and then you we will find out and seek
[10:24] the lord and ask him what must you do
[10:27] now other minor cases and so forth like
[10:30] that is given over to brother
[10:31] neville and brother higginbottom and
[10:34] sister oregon bride
[10:35] and the others who speaks with tongues
[10:37] and interprets which is here in the
[10:38] church
[10:39] therefore we're like the journey i
[10:42] believe with jethro said to moses one
[10:43] day
[10:45] let's take some elders and the spirit of
[10:47] god was taken off of moses and put on
[10:49] 70 of the elders and they prophesied but
[10:52] just the major and hard
[10:54] things come to moses alone now we're not
[10:57] moses
[10:58] neither are these the elders but we're
[11:00] still serving the jehovah god
[11:02] with the same pillar of fire leading us
[11:04] to the promised land
[11:05] hallelujah so then yes there will be
[11:08] other uh be meetings and will be the
[11:11] interpretation the
[11:13] discernments will come that will be
[11:15] giving me a chance then
[11:17] to be in prayer and study the days that
[11:19] i know that these interviews will come
[11:22] and be ready for them i remember billy
[11:25] paul branham our field secretary will

[15:04] god
[15:05] to reveal to us these secret things
[15:08] that's been hit all these years
[15:11] as we are approaching one of the most
[15:14] sincere solemn words
[15:19] thou did speak of it when you were here
[15:22] on earth
[15:23] and said he that readeth let him
[15:26] understand
[15:29] so we most graciously come to the lord

[15:36] not knowing just what to say set an
[15:40] order here a few
[15:41] scriptures and solemnly and holy
[15:44] depending upon thee for the answer
[15:49] for no other purpose but that we might
[15:52] know the hour that we're living that we
[15:55] might be prepared for
[15:57] the great things that lies ahead
[15:59] [Music]
[16:01] won't you grant it to us lord
[16:04] in the name of him who taught us all
[16:06] that we should pray
[16:07] like this our father who art
[16:11] in heaven hallowed be thy name
[16:15] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[16:19] in earth as it is in heaven
[16:22] give us this day our daily bread
[16:26] and forgive us of our trespasses
[16:29] as we forgive those that trespass
[16:32] against us and lead us not
[16:36] into temptation but deliver us
[16:39] from evil for thine is the kingdom
[16:44] and the power and the glory
[16:47] forever amen
[16:50] be seated
[16:53] [Music]
[17:02] now if any other man wants to remove
[17:05] their coats just
[17:07] feel welcome and those who are standing
[17:10] around
[17:12] the sides of the wall if your feet gets
[17:15] achy why
[17:16] just feel at liberty to move out
[17:20] now i think if the children wants to go
[17:22] to their rooms or have they already been
[17:24] dismissed hey
[17:25] we can't have them this morning
[17:29] the pastor says that the crowd is got
[17:32] the rooms packed up so we cannot
[17:35] have sunday school for the little ones
[17:38] we would be happy if you little fellows
[17:40] now would cooperate with us
[17:42] as this morning we are having starting
[17:46] a great tremendous message
[17:49] that i'm sure that will mean a great
[17:52] deal to your father and mother
[17:55] and your loved ones that sharing even to
[17:57] you little ones
[18:00] so we approach it very reverently if the
[18:03] lord willing
[18:04] this morning uh
[18:08] we're taking the subject of daniel's
[18:11] 70 of weeks and this morning we're
[18:15] speaking on
[18:16] daniel in captivity
[18:20] and gabriel flying in to instruct
[18:23] him about the future
[18:27] while daniel was in prayer the gabriel
[18:30] the angel come in to instruct him
[18:33] tonight
[18:34] i want to speak on the six-fold purpose
[18:38] of his visit six different
[18:41] subjects to be brought in tonight what
[18:43] gabriel come from
[18:45] next sunday the lord willing
[18:48] i want to place the reason and the time
[18:52] of the seven church ages and what time
[18:55] they are
[18:56] and where we are standing today amen
[18:59] that's all next sunday morning the lord
[19:01] willing
[19:02] amen now
[19:05] the reason for this
[19:08] i brought down some little notes from my
[19:11] last few messages and this morning i
[19:15] want to
[19:16] laugh over because this is on
[19:20] magnetic tape that will go
[19:23] all over the world many nations
[19:27] and always the reason i laugh it back
[19:30] is perhaps someone would hear
[19:34] the tape for their first time and would
[19:36] not be able
[19:38] to understand what i was meaning when i
[19:40] refer back to something else
[19:43] we have been now for months in the study
[19:46] of the book of revelations the
[19:49] revelation of jesus christ
[19:51] we have come through the church ages
[19:54] the first three chapters of revelations
[19:57] was the church ages
[19:59] then john was caught up in the fourth
[20:02] and fifth chapter
[20:03] and was shown things that that was to be
[20:07] here
[20:07] after now on the sixth chapter he drops
[20:11] down
[20:12] into the earth again
[20:16] to see things taking place
[20:20] that will go from the sixth chapter
[20:23] the first verse until the 19th chapter
[20:26] and the 21st verse
[20:29] in here comes in the seals the plagues
[20:32] the woes the locuses
[20:34] the the woman and the sun
[20:38] and the casting out of the red dragon
[20:40] the sealing away the hundred and forty
[20:42] four thousand
[20:43] and all these things this has been a
[20:47] week of tremendous study yesterday all
[20:50] day i hardly moved from the room
[20:53] trying to study and it's something
[20:56] in the last time and many of the old
[20:58] timers sure that i taught
[21:00] i just said in here belongs the 70 weeks
[21:03] of daniel but i
[21:04] did not try to attack him to explain it
[21:08] but this time by the grace of god i have
[21:11] taken up all myself
[21:13] to try to ask grace before god
[21:16] that i might bring it to the people
[21:19] and in here i'm finding things that i do
[21:22] not know
[21:23] one thing about and then i
[21:27] have been reading dr larkin's book
[21:31] dr smith's book dr
[21:34] scofield's notes different
[21:38] commentaries from man everywhere and
[21:41] yet i cannot put theirs together
[21:45] to make it come out right see so
[21:48] this week i'm planning on been visiting
[21:52] the library in kentucky
[21:54] on some of the ancient astronomy of the
[21:57] calendars and times
[21:59] and picking up from the libraries and so
[22:01] forth all the ancient books that i can
[22:04] and
[22:05] to what little i can do and having my
[22:08] trust solemnly in jesus christ to reveal
[22:12] it to me because i do not want it
[22:15] to say i know this and i know that he
[22:18] knows my heart he's listening at me
[22:20] but i wanted that i might enlighten
[22:24] his people therefore i believe that he
[22:28] will give it to me
[22:30] i do not know as yet but i'm trusting
[22:34] him for next sunday because that will be
[22:36] the tremendous part
[22:37] as next sunday to know and play so
[22:39] seventy weeks
[22:41] each one has a different place and when
[22:44] you do you go to run them all through
[22:45] they don't come out right
[22:47] they don't register upright it can and
[22:50] therefore
[22:51] i i may not be able to have it right
[22:55] but i'm going to trust the lord part and
[22:58] i remember of solomon one time praying
[23:01] and asking the lord god if
[23:04] he would give him wisdom not for himself
[23:07] no extension of days no longer life
[23:10] not riches but if he might have wisdom
[23:13] to know
[23:14] how to to to judge
[23:18] god's people and god honored that
[23:21] prayer and gave solomon that wisdom
[23:23] because it was for his people
[23:26] and that's why i'm asking god to let me
[23:29] know
[23:30] what these 70 of weeks mean
[23:33] because i know it's the exact calendar
[23:37] for the age we're living in amen and
[23:40] therefore i want to know it
[23:42] not for myself i'm not for myself of
[23:45] course i want to know it i don't say it
[23:47] that way not for myself
[23:48] because i do want it for myself i want
[23:51] to know
[23:52] because i want to know where we're
[23:53] living and what time we're living in
[23:56] and then i know that that was given and
[23:59] different ones has
[24:00] figured it out and they've had it way
[24:02] back one thought i was reading had it
[24:04] all
[24:05] ended up in 19 and 19 of the 70th weeks
[24:10] well that wasn't so
[24:13] after 70 of weeks after 78 weeks it's
[24:16] all finished
[24:18] so we uh we don't we want to know the
[24:21] truth
[24:22] and i'm asking god to give me the truth
[24:24] yes
[24:25] amen now in order to back this
[24:28] up go back i
[24:32] want to rehearse a little bit of the
[24:34] back
[24:36] so therefore some notes that i jotted
[24:38] down
[24:39] that we had in the fifth the fourth and
[24:42] fifth chapter so that the people
[24:44] will understand first before we do this
[24:49] i want to laugh it over so that you'll
[24:51] get from the fourth now remember the
[24:53] third chapter was the lady of
[24:57] seeing church age and the church was
[25:00] taken
[25:01] up at the end of lady osea
[25:05] now i was trying to explain
[25:08] something to my wife about it i had
[25:11] becky my daughter with all the different
[25:13] types of dictionaries and things that we
[25:15] could get
[25:16] they don't give the answer i got the
[25:18] bible dictionary i got the old greek
[25:20] dictionary
[25:21] i i got the uh the webster's and many
[25:24] others the modern dictionaries none of
[25:26] them could get them
[25:29] anyway my wife said how do you expect
[25:33] our people which are poor people
[25:37] and many of them uneducated like we are
[25:39] to understand
[25:40] such as that i said god will give me
[25:43] anything
[25:45] amen no matter how complicated it is god
[25:48] can break it down make it simple
[25:50] amen for we are the
[25:53] a potion of those people who are longing
[25:56] hallelujah praying
[26:00] for that day in that hour and our eyes
[26:04] are set towards heaven and we're
[26:06] watching for
[26:07] his coming i like to stop just a second
[26:10] to say that many peoples
[26:12] who are expecting some
[26:15] great tremendous powerful something to
[26:18] happen
[26:19] in the gentile age are certainly wrong
[26:23] the church age and all that will happen
[26:26] during the gentile reign is recorded
[26:28] from
[26:28] revelations 1 to revelations 3 inclusive
[26:33] then the church was raptured and taken
[26:35] up and the
[26:36] rest of this until the 19th
[26:39] chapter is what happens to the jewish
[26:42] race
[26:44] after the church has gone up and it is
[26:46] the time
[26:47] of the great tribulation
[26:51] nothing to happen amongst the gentiles
[26:53] only the slaughtering and so forth
[26:55] as we'll get to that and see but the
[26:58] church itself
[26:59] has gone on the 13th on the
[27:02] last verse of the third chapter of
[27:06] revelations when the ladies in church
[27:08] age
[27:09] end which was the last and we took each
[27:11] church age
[27:12] each time each thing that happened each
[27:15] star
[27:16] each messenger their nature what they've
[27:19] done
[27:20] and brought it right down through
[27:22] history until the very last one
[27:24] draws out there on the picture on the
[27:26] side of the wall and when we got
[27:28] finished the holy spirit come in and
[27:29] made a
[27:30] circle of the same thing on the wall and
[27:32] revealed it by himself right here to all
[27:34] of us now
[27:37] in doing this i trust at the end of this
[27:39] he'll come with a tremendous something
[27:41] and show us again
[27:43] that we are at the end time
[27:48] how many of you heard kennedy's
[27:50] president kennedy's speech
[27:53] the comments and so forth i mean he
[27:56] heard this prediction that
[27:57] by january the 1st has predicted that
[28:00] both the united states and
[28:02] russia will be volcanic ashes
[28:05] that's all we need it's later than we
[28:09] are thinking
[28:12] so if we are so near to even man on this
[28:15] earth
[28:16] are predicting this tremendous thing to
[28:19] happen
[28:20] we better be on the alert
[28:23] everything right up the date all
[28:25] confessions made everything ready
[28:28] because we don't know just what time our
[28:31] lord's going to summon us
[28:34] and when he gives us summons come up
[28:36] higher
[28:38] you better be ready and it's going to
[28:41] come in hour that you
[28:43] think not the great pentecostal revival
[28:47] is now ceasing
[28:49] we see it everywhere last great move
[28:53] and messages went forth everything's
[28:56] ready now
[28:57] waiting the church is sealed away
[29:00] the wicked are doing more wicked
[29:03] churches are becoming more churchy
[29:06] the saints are coming closer to god
[29:09] the gifts of the spirit begin to
[29:11] multiply in the little groups
[29:13] we're at the end time
[29:15] [Music]
[29:17] oh i love that song that we used to sing
[29:20] in the church
[29:22] i'm watching for the coming of that glad
[29:26] millennium day
[29:28] when our blessed lord shall come and
[29:30] catch his
[29:31] waiting right away oh
[29:34] my heart is crying thirsting
[29:38] for that day of sweet release
[29:41] when our savior shall come back to earth
[29:44] again
[29:46] [Music]
[29:52] hallelujah
[29:58] you
