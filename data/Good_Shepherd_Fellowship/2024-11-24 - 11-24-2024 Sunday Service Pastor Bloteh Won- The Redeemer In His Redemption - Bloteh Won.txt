uh young men back there that had that uh uh trouble uh and we thank the Lord for stepping on the scene amen and I believe that's the reason why God gave children guiding Angels because he know that we can't take care of them enough praise the Lord amen so uh that gu in injured is right there from the beginning I saw uh uh a kind of a kind of a scary uh uh uh video for two twins boys that were that were playing in the room and uh they were trying to climb up on their little cubby and the cubby came right down and the other one was he could quickly escape and the other one was caught under the the cabinet and I I mean I'm just jittering my body oh my God where where you know where're you know we're at the parents and and uh the other twin boy was just going around the cabinet trying to see how he can help his brother he's standing he's looking and he's just that little man just struggling on that thing and I'm saying oh my God and and finally he came out with you know he came out his brother you know trying to potion and I just I'm just saying I said surely there have to be a garden in J there amen because there is no way that that cabinet weight is more than the two of them there is no way he could push that over I saw another fake video a long time ago and uh there there was an earthquake and this little baby was playing with a toy right in the corner of the house the mother was in the kitchen and uh and I mean it was a very serious earthquake I can't remember the country but uh uh when the building came down the the the the the braks from the house hit the mother and I think she broke her back and and I mean she was flat on the ground and uh uh I know what I thought why why all of this coming to my mind but it it kind of for works well because uh I want to speak on a redeemer this morning amen I want to talk about a redeemer that is in his Redemption there is no Redemption if the Redeemer is not in it praise the lord we are we will just be having a ceremony if the redeem if the Redeemer is not in his Redemption praise the Lord I mean uh because he does the work he's the one that does the work he pay the price he the one that come after us we don't go after him praise the Lord amen I want to talk about a redeemer that is in his Redemption this morning so I mean uh uh in there in that in that video uh the the search team came and they wanted to know if there were still survivors so they drill into the earth into the robbers and then they put uh uh uh a little instrument like a like a microphone down in the rubber I mean the duck down in the rubble and and and they had this to their ears to see if they would hear people crying I mean this this was about over over 15 story building that came down by an earthquake and and I mean they they put that thing down in the earth trying to find out uh uh you know how if there were people stay there and and as they were listening they year people groaning you know out of pains and they year people crying you know so uh with that also they send a camera down there to be able to search because they're going to dig into the Earth and they don't want to dig these people alive so they send a camera down there to search down in the earth and see where the person was the beautiful thing about this brought me into tears I mean that night I just cry right into praying and say God how's good you are the camera will picked the little baby in the corner innocent Baby Stay playing mother is lying down there in pain and you know the the more amazing thing about it it was not the same day that did that in my mind I'm thinking who sustained that child when a mother is helpless laying down on the on on the on the bed crying out of pain and uh and and I think there I think there the other siblings got killed or something like that uh and and all of that but the little baby was unharmed because she was right in the corner there you know and the the the you know they were able to get down there you know dig and brought that little baby out and I'm I'm just thinking in my in my mind they have to be God they have to be God amen amen that sustained that child the same God that fair Elijah took care of that little baby and I I think he knows that we can take care of ourselves very well so he has to give us a guing angel to watch over us you love him this morning amen praise the Lord and uh we just want to as we greet to you we want to also uh uh read a little note of thanks here and uh uh from sister Rachel she text me this morning she and her brother Jour turn was uh was inen an in an

yes last week you are so night God even right now right here Lord father and oh God you want to make yourself known every time every time we come in the presence of your word you want to make yourself known if there is one thing that you don't want us to make is that you are here you don't want us to miss that father you don't want us to be caught up in the emotion of the preacher all the songs

morning heal the sick in our midst Lord we love you we thank you we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat we want to speak this morning like I said the redeem the Redeemer in his Redemption praise the Lord the Redeemer in his Redemption brother B preach a message back that he entitled Redeemer Redemption I was listening to to that message and and then uh uh I I got this thought of the Redeemer in his Redemption so uh uh I just thought that okay maybe we can be able to share that with you but uh before we get into what we want to share with you this morning I have one quote just one quote that I will read this morning and that is out of the church age book and that's what I want to take uh uh my fellow my my exhortation from but let's go back to the scripture that we have read first let's go back to the scripture because uh you have to remember that this was Paul that said in the Bible I've seen a man uh uh whether in this body or out of this body praise the Lord he was testifying of going behind the curtain of time or going uh uh to the tear heaven but he said I saw a man you know he says whether it was in this body or it was out of this body I can't tell you know he says but there were things that were so wonderful that was where he took that state that statement from eyes have not seen ears have not heard neither have it come close to the heart of man what God has installed for them that love him praise the Lord amen that that that shows to us there is there is more reality than the reality that we behold there is more to the world that we live in and I believe those are some of the things that Paul was dabbing into when he spoke about the birth the length the depth and the height he says here again I go back to that again uh uh he's bowing his knees to our lord Jesus of home the whole Heaven and Earth the Bible says there is no name given on a heaven whereby uh we can be saved I mean God took a human name and that's the name uh Jesus uh uh but he's being Lord idona uh uh and also being Christ the anointed one uh uh which of course is what he left to be able to guide and govern his people on earth is the anointing is the Holy Ghost so he's called the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord so Paul is saying here and and and God took that name Among Us uh uh that's what the angel said to Mary but Paul is go he's making us to understand that God glorified the name in so much that God took it as his family name he took the name of our Lord Jesus Christ as his family name couple of weeks ago we spoke about uh uh the making and the giving of names and we we show how there were many many people that you know that uh that were called Jesus Through the Scripture it was a common name I mean it was it was uh Yeshua it was Joshua you know uh many people named their children after that but yet God it pleased the Lord to also take that name it was uh it was was a name on Heaven it was an Earthly name but God will magnify that name God will exalt that name amen that every need and every tongue will bow and uh uh that that Jesus is Lord so Paul is is also being grateful here and and and showing his worship to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then he's he's making us to to to see here he's bringing something to the church he's says uh that he who grants you according to the riches of his glory Paul says that God who grants you that God will give to you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man now he's talking about uh God giving us strength Beyond this flesh amen God giving us strength Beyond this flesh because you see this flesh is just a vehicle there is something that drive this flesh praise the lord it's just a vehicle when God made man we we will get to that when he make man at Genesis 1:26 that's where we going this morning when he made man he made man a spirit being you were made a spirit when you leave from here you go back a spirit if we will come back to the Earth will pick up another body praise the Lord amen this is not our reality this body is not our reality it's just a vehicle so where Paul is wanting us to have strength is in our inner man amen if the inner man is strengthened you can command this body to do anything are we together amen praise the Lord you will you will you will soon you will soon see and understand why he's asking for strength uh in our inner man that Christ May dwell in Your Heart by faith that yet being rooted and grounded in love that yet being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all things to comprehend with all sin that we must be able to understand Paul is saying there is something before us there is something that is in our midst there is something that we are living in that we need to understand that we might be able to comprehend with all sins what is the breath and the length and the depth and the height that we must be able to honor understand what is that he's talking about us getting strength in our spirit man why because Paul here is dealing with Dimensions he's trying to make us to realize that we need to be able to be strengthened in our spirit man to to to see and understand the word that we live in amen praise the Lord amen to understand the word that we live in are we together glory be to God we need to understand that and to know the love of Christ which which passes knowledge that ye may be able that you might be filled with all of the fullness of God because we realize that God one time the great Elohim interal Spirit he fell all time in all space you will see you will see that Paul is talking about something far beyond our word that we live in as he closes this chapter let's read a little bit and I'm enjoying the reading amen he says uh now unto him that is able to do the exceeding and abundantly above all that we ask or think praise the Lord do you realize that God can open our eyes this morning just like he did to Gaza on the mountain when Elijah said Lord open open this boy eyes let he see this morning that there is more with us than them that are against us praise the Lord hallelujah I I'm telling you if God can open our eyes this morning and I mean we can be so captur with his presence that it will be hard for us to leave this place praise the Lorden I mean God can he can he can he can take us beyond the the the three dimension that our B this B you know is is is is is is is is have a much understanding of three dimensions but he can take us beyond that praise the Lord that you will you you can even HH have an idea of when did the service started when did they end have you ever been in a service so long and you and and and you think that it was shot when you ask for the time you say oh wow I can't believe it wow why why make you to feel that way it's because your spirit went beyond the time element your spirit went beyond the time element there is more to this word there is more reality to this word in the things that we see and the things we year amen praise the Lord amen that the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye may be filled with all the fullness now unto him that is able to do the exceeding abounding above all that we can ask or thing according to the power that worketh in us the power that work in US is a power that is beyond what we can think we have such an exceeding power that is working in Us Praise the Lord amen such an exceeding power that is far beyond all we can ask all we can think that's why Paul said in Romans we we don't even know what to pray for the spirit have to make intercession on our behalf praise the Lord because when we get to that place our mind is so limited praise the Lord our mind is so limited we we we think about all the things around us all the needs around us but yet the spirit make intercession and he brings us to the place and make requests on our behalf listen to this unto him be gloried in the church by Jesus Christ throughout all ages word Without End Amen what is that word Without End what is that so we we're going to talk about that this this uh this morning we're going to talk about the Redeemer that is in his Redemption praise the Lord amen we learn from the word of God that God Plan of Redemption was before the foundation of the word amen he planned this thing before the foundation of the word that word foundation means beginning before he began the word he had his Plan of Redemption praise the Lord but you see God just did not write out his Plan of Redemption and and and left it or find someone else to come and carry it out no praise the Lord even the man that he choose throughout the ages to use as Messengers as prophets and and different he never left them to them themselves for them to be able to carry out his plan when he met Moses he said he gave Moses a vision and said build a tabernacle according to this Vision but yet he never left Moses the Bible says he came down and he gave men and women a spirit of wisdom amen for them to be able to design the Tabernacle to make the curtains to make uh you know he gave them so God never left his work of redemption just wrote it on a paper and says yeah you know this in the first age this is how it's going to be I'm just going to give it to you your carry up I mean there is no way we will have carry out right men who have fail right from the beginning right amen praise the Lord amen amen Grace Little Grace help Anthony set up baby now so uh uh that's that's why we want to see this morning but let's go let's go to Genesis Genesis chapter 1 let's look at some few things uh they caught my mind this morning and I thought that I will share those things with you amen Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and vow and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and God said let it be light and there was light and God saw the light and it was good he divided the light from the darkness and he called the light day the night the darkness he called night the evening and the morning were the first day now if you read this account you will realize praise the Lord you will realize that uh uh the Bible says here in verse 7 God made the fmen uh I'm I'm trying to okay in verse 4 14 in verse 14 the Bible says and God said let there be light in theen of the Heavens to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons for days and for years you will realize here that this was when God created time praise the Lord amen amen if you look at that again the Bible says in the F he says and let and let them be for seasons for signs for days for years praise the Lord amen so for us to be able to have our calandar and know we are in winter and summer and have all of days and was right here when God placed the light in the farming and and and he divided the day from night so right here time was created praise the Lord but the question I want to ask you before time was created the Bible says back here when he said let there be light he called the light day the night he called Darkness the evening and the morning were the first day how could God have the first day before he created time praise the Lord amen I want you to to think about that a little bit amen what I want really want to do this morning is that uh I just want to I want to get there in your spirit and just and just you know turn things outside down praise the Lord Lord think about it you think about it the Bible says there in Genesis chapter 27 that uh and God made man in his h h h and he formed Man Out of the Dust and he breath into the nostril of man and Man became a living soul that was Adam's birth day amen th was Adam's birthday that was the day that he took form but yet when Adam was born Adam was 21 years old praise the Lord amen when Adam was born he was 21 years old are you you understand what I'm saying praise the Lord amen amen he was not a baby no he was born an upright man God made him upright that's what the Bible says in the book of ecclesiast God made man upright he made Adam upright and he birth into the nost of Adam and Adam became a living Soul Brother Bram says his toes were stuck in the earth like Roots When the Breath of Life got into his body he had to shake his foot out of the Earth to start running but then when he was made on his birthday he was 21 praise the Lord amen you see that's that's what that's what prove that even in Divine Healing if God will give a man a brand new heart or give a man a brand new organs of the body God can create an organ that will capture where your age if a person is 35 years old and God will give them an organ God will create an organ that will be 35 years old to be able to meet with your body praise the Lord are you understanding what I'm saying you see because the the the the the the the thing about it is that we need to understand that the reality of the world that we live in science is talking about all of these years now they've been telling us about virtual reality and science they are probing into more of these thing you think that uh uh uh uh cell phone has affected Our Generation science is challenging you that they are coming up with something that is better than cell phone praise the Lord what they are doing in the medical science is that they are building the chip that they can just put on your your brain and that chap will read your illness and correct illnesses in your body praise the Lord will I ever start preaching this morning amen I need the Lord to help me amen praise the Lord but what what what we I'm trying to bring to us this morning is for us to to realize that almighty God is real amen amen praise the Lord and I think that's that's one of the thing uh uh uh uh uh about the church uh I mean we should not come to church and talk about God we should come to church to experience God amen if he's in our midst let's experience him amen let's let's bring him out of his word let's bring him out of his word if we just talking about him this is no different from a lecture hall if we are just coming together and talk about him and I can just bring you uh h h h h uh 900 quotes of what brother brandham said on the same thing it's just a lecture yeah I believe that we must go beyond that we must bring God out of his word bring God out of the message and when we come together let's experience God that's what having church is praise the Lord you know it's it's almost like when you have a you have a h h h h uh how how how do you call it now you have a p and everybody bring a little bit and you says oh I love your cake you know your cake was nice and person I love the salad that you make oh I enjoy it what are we doing we are experiencing praise the lord we are experiencing the different contribution the different recipe from the hands of one another and that's what we must do when we come to church let's experience god let's not just sit there and wait for a [Music] lecture praise the Lord we've been lectured that's all what the church ages as all been about just a lecture praise the lord we can turn to Matthew chapter 24 and talk about Matthew Jesus said there will be War you know he said this before he went to his disciples and he said this and Jesus said this and Jesus said we just lecturing you about what he said but the very God that said that he's in our midst this morning to bring to pass what he has said good praise the Lord you know you know one thing that parents love to do parents love for their children to experience them praise the Lord amen when when you when when a parent talking about enjoying their children is not lecturing them praise the Lord inste of playing a word game are playing you know uh throwing something across the table and just just experiencing amen or bringing us some some some laughter I mean some half the laughter when you you laugh all your side is cracking up oh my God you're so funny D you're so funny that's what children remember yes they all the lecture that's right praise the Lord that's what children enjoy when they are experiencing you and that's what God enjoy praise the Lord that's what God enjoyed that's what church must be about than just lecturing you Hallelujah praise the Lord you love the Lord glory be to God hallelujah amen let's experience God Amen let's bring him out of his word when it is true say Lord that is true but I believe it can be right now praise the Lord your amen is not only amening because brother Bram said it you are amening because it's real to you and it can be done today if it were just only good for that time then there there is no need for it to be an amen he's an alltime God amen amen he's an everpresent God hallelujah God love to be experienced amen when he allow things in our life he want to be experienced he want to be experienced as a Healer he want to be experienced as a [Music] deliverer he want us to experience him that way you love the Lord hallelujah so Paul is talking about all these dimensional things that you will be able to comprehend the love of God just like I said h a couple of weeks ago or I mean I say it all the time amen the Bible says there is God talking to a people that he had just brought out of Egypt a people that is rebelling against him in the wilderness and he's telling them love the Lord with all your heart and all your mind and all your soul amen amen praise praise the Lord what is that have we ever taught what what actually that is how can we love God with all of our heart how how are we ever able to get to this place that is the thing that Baff me when I went back and start looking at that scripture God is talking to a rebellious people he said these people are stiff neck these are the very people he wanted to eliminate of the earth and Moses had to stand in the Gap and he's telling these people love the Lord with all of your heart I think God knows better praise the Lord that these people all that is on their mind is the garlic in Egypt praise the Lord somebody said that's what I don't like garlic because that's all they wanted and anyway I love GC and I love the Lord amen I love the Lord more than garlic Amen Let me see it that way praise the Lord people quick to go from church with Doctrine we shouldn't like garlic because they wanted garlic that's not what I'm preaching I love garlic but I love the Lord more than garlic praise the Lord amen now so what but here say God is talking to these people people and then when you really come down to it and you look at the the uh the atonement of the human body you look at the human body you realize that actually that compartment that God was referring to is not the compartment that your blood pumps out of God was referring to something that you hold something that is your makeup that you don't have control over you have it you have a spirit where part of your body is your spirit where part of your body is your spirit residing you have a soul where part of your body your soul is residing re re I mean resident in your body brother talks about that little compartment under the heart you know where blood have not pped the prophet of God giving giving us an idea because if you really take it and you go down to that little compartment can you open it and get your soul out can you tell the doctor say doctor you know there's a little compartment the prophet of God said let me read a quote here to you the prophet of God said there's a little compartment in my heart that no blood is uh goes there that's where my soul I want you to operate on me this morning and get a hold of my soul can you do that no you can't do it you can do it even love the Lord with your heart is not what is beating in your chest here that's what Paul is referring to Here There is a dimension About You Even in our physical body amen we have a trinity of ourself a body a spirit and a soul praise the Lord so we have we have this Dimension there is something that is around you there is something that is of your makeup that is more real amen than this body there is something about you that don't age there is something about you that don't age there is something about you that don't get tired you have it it's in you amen that's why we can say the body is weak but the spirit is willing the body is weak there is something about you that can't get tired there is something about you that don't get sick Hallelujah your body gets sick but there is something in you that you just want to get up because that thing that want to get out of bed is not sick this body is sick but that thing is not sick whatever it is you call it whatever you want to call it but I'm here to tell you this morning there is more reality to you Hallelujah amen than this thing you are looking at oh my praise the Lord hallelujah love the Lord with all of your heart then the Bible comes back again and say the heart of man is desperate Wicked how can you love God With A desperate Wicked heart how how how can we but yet we love the Lord amen you love the Lord this morning you you love the Lord this morning praise the Lord if you love the Lord let's give him a hand of Praise Hallelujah do you see why you love the Lord yet there are things in your own very life that you are not pleased with Lord praise the Lord amen amen and you see the lack of the understanding of those things throughout the ages that's what make the age to always live onor his privilege why because the people were the they were they were trying to qualify their Earthly lifel stand up with what God is doing in their life praise the Lord if they go down to the market and and they made a mistake they come back you know they have to do Penance walk on breaking glasses share their own blood knock their head against the wall and they say oh God how how could I do this how Lord how could I do this if if you are really in me I would not do this praise the Lord if you read church history and tell church history you will realize some of some of the atrocities some of the things men committed suicide in good faith because they wanted to please God they wanted to stop thinking evil praise the Lord right and they could not stop thinking evil so the best way they thought they can please God is so just take their own lives what was happening it was because the mystery of understanding their reality was not revealed this message brings the mystery of understanding your reality that's why God sent a prophet what did the angel of the Lord told him I'm sent from the presence of the Lord to tell you about what your mysterious life I will tell you about the reality of yourself that you don't understand hallelujah praise the Lord there were many men many priest under the Roman system they had to castrate thems because they believed that they were giving themsel over to the service of the Lord and according to their system they were not to have nothing but yet they couldn't take the desire they couldn't take the loss of women from the themselves praise the Lord you see how the system became deceitful the system became cruel to those people it became Wicked to them to take young women that could have had beautiful life and prosperous life and say you can be like married but yet it couldn't take the desire it couldn't take the Lost out of them so this man have to kill thems it's written in the Catholic records praise the Lord had a preach on one time we were talking about this thing you know and I and I mean we were talking heart to heart and and talking about the reality of of I mean what what they were in and and he was the first person that brought these things to me he says he says what you're saying is truth and and he says uh I mean we we have those things he called one of the the one of the the priest name I can't remember his name now and says uh the Catholic Church will not make him a sin because he did that but how many of the thousands how many now you think about it let's bring it to ourself we raise our children up telling them about the love of God and and teaching them how to read Bible sing chrisan sons and then they grow up and and then they come to Teenage life and they starts to experience the change in their body praise the Lord that young child onor on their state of innocent uh uh they think they know the love of God the thing they have the the love of God it says I'm born in the message to them being born in the message is the Holy Ghost they are free from Evil they are free from temptation but they get to that age and they are B start sending different signal to them and they can't understand why why am I thinking this way why am I feeling this way praise the Lord amen amen glory be to God living in the in the world in the society that has so disconnected us disconnected us they feel a whole lot on the reality on on on their social media reality and all of that and and and and and and and before you realize that their minds have been this virgin exposed to things and some of those things they are trying to ask themselves in their mind they say why my body is feeling this way and sometimes un known to their parents they are exercising their body to be able to understand why their body is feeling the way they were feeling couple of years back I never felt like this I never thought of this but before you realize there is thousand different signal that's pulling to their body and their mind is running praise the Lord hallelujah amen and then uh the devil gets right in there and starts to make them to realize starts to tell them thatth there's there's nothing truth to this uh H born again and you know uh uh uh I see I see some of the young people here even you know young people growing up they get they get very they get very you know convicted you know they want to be to to to be baptized because they want to come Fort communion they thinking what is in that up that they say only them can eat praise the Lord amen they are thinking that so uh you know they want to be baptized to many of them I remember the child says it might bring me closer to God another child tell me says it will it will it will help me to stop all my baa things I can be doing when I get baptized I will stop all my by by things I can be doing it's so wonderful to talk to those children amen and but yet I don't I don't despise that I encourage that because I know that by the Bible the only thing that we don't believe is infant baptism but I believe thatth it's it's it's a blessing to put a child under that Covenant you know that you have appli the word you have put them under that Covenant you have put them in a a a a h a a guidance you know in in in in in a in a place where the their life has a promise over them because God promised to give them the Holy Ghost amen I I would rather a child be in that place than for a parent to tell me Well my child is Young they are not repented yet they need to grow they need to grow until they are now exposed to all the evils glory be to God you love the Lord oh hallelujah praise the Lord I just I just asked that question because I don't know any better question to ask but I know you love the Lord amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah I'm trying to get something I want to share with you uh I want to share with you this uh it's not it's not part of my my notes this morning but just like I said that brother BR said in the message come follow me he says uh uh uh he says most conversion that that is done to Christ he say it is done he say it is done mostly under the age of 21 it say most conversion that is done to Christ it's not the fact that God don't save people after that age but what brother Brandon was trying to bring is there uh after 21 we are in another cycle we are in another change of our our life he says when people grow up to be older they get so so strong in their ways they have they have buil a very strong character and because of all of life experience that sometime the reality of God God will have to do something Supernatural praise the Lord amen I'll just I'll just listening to the message I'm all over my my myself today but it's wonderful I was just listening to the message uh path of Life brother Bram read that scripture he will show me the path of Life uh uh uh I woke up in the morning I remember the day and and after praying I I had that scripture on my mind so I went through the Bible and I and I read through all where the Bible was talking the path of life because I was thinking on what we are talking about and and and actually it has to do with a dimension there there's a path that that the same God that make signs only discover the path in the air for them to call a airplane route praise the Lord there's a path in the sea David talks about it and there was a there was a US Navy officer a Christian boy I've shared that with you before that read that scripture and it trigger him for him to go instead to draw the map that ships travel on the sea so in the US Academy the the the the they name there after him because he came up with that and where did he took it from because the Bible said there's a path in the sea praise the Lord God told Moses why cry why why you crying to me if God brought them down to that place God knew that there was a route for them to go he pull a route there that's why he said why cry speak and go forward but what do our reality does our reality say there is water I don't see no Ro that's where the him of mind is limited the human our human being our assisting element say there is water I don't see no Road that's why Moses was crying oh God what we are doing now the mountain is here the mountain the Egyptians are behind us God said why cry to me why are you crying just go forward praise the Lord but you see Joshua learned better when he got to Jordan he never needed to cry he just told the Levi you get the presence of God you go in the water he made way back there he will make way again praise the Lord so thinking about this it is because uh SS of God there is there is there is a reality amen you see science is breaking into these things and by technology they they are bringing all of this invention and we are just going oh wow oh oh wow you see what they have brought again you can just do this by your fingerprint and this will happen oh wow it has already been there it has been there since the time of creation it has been there praise the Lord when God set our path on this Earth set us here on this Earth he he cut our path that we will have to walk amen yes he C our path that we will have to walk he knows the people that we needed in our lives to help us make the journey better amen amen praise the Lord so thinking about all of these things in the morning I just make that my meditation and I I you know I was just meditating on that and uh uh uh you know all through just saying uh going through all the Bible verses there on the of life and uh uh and then I remember I say I remember brother preach a message on this let me let me go back and and listen to that he read from some that will show me the path of life and he's he's talking on this meeting he talking on this meeting now follow me a little bit because this really really blessed my heart really really blessed my heart he's talking about a meeting and he's you know he's preaching and then he brings the message to the man with the apple tree praise the Lord okay he brings the message told the man when he and brother Banks who went out there and said the man bank I can't believe you going around with a Preacher Brother brandham said as as he as he was you know as engaging the man the man was talking about uh you know uh uh you preachers you know you just scand the people of their money and you know he just went on chewing brother Brandon he said but but there is one guy that I want to meet amen you know there's a woman up there she went to a meeting now if you follow that story closely let me give you another thing here that that will bless you if you follow that story closely and you associate with the story brother brandham told of the Angel visiting the neighborhood the two women that went to to the meetings and they were prayed for and then when they came back to their home they realized that their healing came he said what happened he said it was the angel visiting the neighborhood one of those women story is associated to this man so just imagine the angel visited the neighborhood they were all shouting because the woman is healed this man went down there and he found out it's true the woman is healed this guy is an infer he does not believe in God but God knew that he was a son and the only way he would come his path to Salvation was to that woman house hallelu so he went to the woman house he realized the woman is healed God is now working in his pyam I want to meet that preacher he had to tell me what he did because I know these guys they are tricky but whatever he told that I want to God is using that to work in his spirit so brother is talking here about him and he says uh uh uh if if you would tell me what intelligence takes uh the leaf off the tree and put the s in the Ruth I will tell you uh uh uh the intelligence that told me that woman will be healed he said are you the preacher he says yes I'm I'm brother BR and brother brandham said listen to this oh listen to this Lord amen like I said like I said this is not this is not part of my note so they will not put it up there Brethren are believe that we have the thing that the word must have but we have got to approach it in the way he says see we got the right things we got to approach the people with it right see that is the thing see it is it is their real General thing this is the holy the Holy Spirit I believe with all of my heart if we had time you know how it is we could approach it by many ways people sometimes you have to use different matter to get to a person praise the Lord amen amen now so he he's saying all of this now because he have just told the story of how he brought an infed somebody that do not believe in God he did not believe in God all of his life whatever happened that that channel him that way he didn't believe in God praise the Lord but there was a path of life for him praise the Lord amen there was a path of life God designed that path of Life David is saying show me the path of life God designed it and here is brother brandham now tapping into God designed path of life amen the angel has already visited the neighborhood God has started doing something around the man that he can't understand he that don't believe in church he don't believe in God but here said there is a preacher he want to meet the preacher that told that woman she will be heal I want to meet him amen praise the Lord here is the preacher William Bram he don't know nothing about it he going to to hunt and now he want to get some apples to eat is the Redeemer in his Plan of Redemption he in his plan praise the Lord he can do without us he wrote his plan and as far as he concerned whatever he wrote down will never fail because he did not he didn't give it to F People Like Us someone like me that always forget a lazy guy like me that God will trust a Redemption plan to me God will not do it he will not do it when he called a man he goes with that man when he call a woman he goes with that woman all that God want from us is to listen and show up Hallelujah just listen and show up be able to y when he call and just show up praise the Lord he's not looking for our credentials our qualification no he he does not need none of that because he's going to get the job done he's going to get the job done hallelujah and you say he's showing here and then he says right here H uh uh you know talking about a man he says and when I went back the next year and I I met his widow he went to be with the Lord and and uh uh I met his widow and I asked her can I can I get op yet and and she said uh uh no you know my husband didn't allow people here then brother BR said he gave me permission said what's your name he says brother Brandon says oh oh oh Bly let me tell you let me tell you about his last moment from that day from that day he found the path of Life praise the Lord amen amen it changed him completely he had a better end than than all of his life that he have livah he had a better end like I've always said I took this from a good friend called Chuck he said the root to this game is to end well it's not how you start it's to end well amall what am I preaching this morning it looks like I'm all over the place praise the Lord you know but you see I got so caught up in Paul talking about Dimensions he talks about the dimensions that we live in the dimensions that we live in the the thing about Dimensions that we don't understand is that that Dimensions is all about reality amen praise the Lord amen it's all about reality amen this three dimensions that we live in Praise the Lord what is our three dimensions space time it matter everything think everything everything it's hard for me to convince you this morning that I don't have a poopet why because you can see it praise the lord it's hard for me to convince you that you we don't have a poopet so dimenions goes to reality it goes to reality because because you can see this poopit to you is real amen amen there is no way you can say that we might we might we might differ with the color maybe I'm color blind praise the Lord I can say right now I'm standing at this white poopit and you say no what is he talking about we might def about the color but in our reality your mind can say that there I I can see it there's a cross on it it had two wings I mean I I don't know what he was talking about but there was a poopet there praise the Lord and that is the same way our faith declar that he is here amen it's not a slogan if we are only saying it as a slogan we are deceiving ourself praise the Lord but our faith must be able to create a vision that makes him real we know that he's in our midst yes Lord amen praise the Lord what what what makes him real Faith brings that reality amen faith in his words says wheresoever two or three I gather in my name I will be there and because we believe that word the reality grabs us that we are in God's presence praise the Lord [Music] hallelujah that's Dimension here is Paul saying he said 14 years ago I know a man he's talking about himself but this reality hit him so hard being a Jew being a Pharisees that he will experience leaving his body and entering into a dimension and I mean they are taught the Torah they they they they are confined to the Torah but Paul had an experience that took him beyond the Torah that make God real to him he had an experience that make him to experience the same thing that Moses experienced on the backside of the desert Paul could say I see why when he came there was so much glory on his face that the people could not behold his face what was that Moses has entered into a reality he has entered into a more reality praise the Lord and I believe that's where the Bride of Jesus Christ is our reality must not be the for corner of these walls when we just come to church no praise the Lord if God is real to us and and I mean the promise of God the promise of the hour is real to us I mean that's why the prophet of God said we can't we will not wait for those doors to open amen because we want to get in there and be able to experience what each and every one of us bring to the table we bring the lake of Lake of Fire we bring our experiences our a and our shout our hand clap glory be to God that will show me the path of Life the Redeemer is in his Redemption amen he's in his Redemption glory be to God the Bible began with in the beginning God that how it begins in the beginning God so the very Plan of Redemption begins with God it does not begin with what church you goes to what family you from no it begins with God and the Plan of Redemption ends with God because it is his plan amen it is his program Hallelujah it was God that came and says Adam Adam where are you it was not Adam and saying oh God I have lost you oh God where are you no it was God going after [Music] him praise the Lord if God would leave it to us we will make a mess out of Faith amen we will make a mess out of it we will mess our own life we will mess everybody around us but God don't leave the Plan of Redemption he don't leave your salvation he don't leave the things that concern you to anybody your health thing he don't leave it to Medical signs because he's the Lord that Health all our diseases praise the Lord let's read this together this is the the one and only quote I had to read to you thank you for helping me preach this morning amen amen these things said this is from the laia church age these things said the faithful and Truth witness now I want to show you what I find in the thought of faithful but I'm talking about the faithful and true witness he said when we talk about faithful let me show you what faithfulness is praise the Lord amen amen you know we often talk about a great unchanging God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seems very impersonal amen we talk about God do not change but we we normally get a view that makes him impersonal why because when we talk about a God that do not change we leave him back in history we leave him in history and because we leave him in history so yeah he's not personal he's not real praise the Lord but if he was if the Redeemer was in his his Redemption there he's in his Redemption today are we together let's continue to read he says we often get a view of him that makes him very impersonal it is as though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then stood back and become a great impersonal God when we are going through trials when we are going through tough times in our life and dealing with things that we don't understand is so easy for us to feel like de praise the lord it's so easy he was the god the Fourth Man In The Fire is he in my fire praise the Lord amen he was the god that came down in the Lion's Den is he in my Lion's Den but I'm here to tell you this morning the Redeemer he's in his work of redemption praise the Lord he's in it it looks like God just made the entire universe and people says where is God there is war in in in in Ukraine there is war in the Middle East you're talking about God where is God God praise the Lord amen we know that God is there he's real why why why why makes us get that faith that he's real that he had not just left these things to run themselves why because his word said it am amen his word declared it am praise the Lord he told us it's going to be like that if we are not just filling our minds with with with with everything and and we're looking at how things are playing out I mean the last time I spoke on the Redemption money and I told you a little bit about uh uh you know the the the the the international market and and all of those things the Rival on disappreciate the US is what causing all of those things dis appreciating the US dollars because if Russia and China and North Kore Korea can be able to influence other people to get away from the US dollar it breaks the the the US economy and it affects the rest of the world right there are a lot of things that is behind our reality [Music] people our politicians don't know uh uh their reality they don't know their reality we can't depend on them because they don't know their reality this word is this Bible is more real than you and myself sitting in this building this morning there are a lot of things that are behind our reality we are just looking from the surface and sometimes we think we know sometimes we think we know even with with think things that we we we battle with in our mind and habits that we struggle with in our lives and things that is happening you know what there is lot of things behind those realities demon powers that is trying to make the word of God of non effect in your life if the devil can just give you the comfort of coming to church and make God a a historical God that's all he wants praise the Lord there is more to that amen but we have a redeemer that is faithful in truth amen everything he have said he will do it that's the reason why every morning he gave us a brand new Mercy he gave us a new Mercy because he want to he want to start a new work with us he want to bring us to New Reality let's not live in the past let's come to every new reality amen amen Our Redeemer is faithful in truth let's read this that's the only quote I have so I read it and then we we Fellowship around and we close amen you love the Lord amen and when we speak of this these things after this manner we often get a view of him that makes him seems in personal as though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it and then he stood back and became a very impersonal God it is as though God made the way to Salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross and then when the death of Christ was atoned for our sin in his resurrection gave us an open door to him God just F his arm and stood back and say well I paid the price already I've gave my life for y y like it y can choose it or not Redemption was not our plan Redemption was his plan amen like I said to you the last time salvation is an individual Affair it's not your Affair you are not the individual he is the individual it is his affair he thought about it from the beginning he choose you before there was a word he's now folding his hands praise the Lord because he said all that the father has given me all that the father has given me he says I will not lose one praise the Lord if he will not lose one then he's in the Redemption business amen he didn't just die on the cross resurrected and just for his hands and say okay let me see what you would do if you have done my part praise the Lord if he didn't call you will not come praise the Lord if he did not call you will not come you must start from there praise the Lord and then if you have come ask him what you call me for amen amen are we together if he did not call you will not come he watch over you full generation to make sure that you sit down on salvation for you to hear the word of God the Gospel of Jesus Christ he watch over you full generation that's how much he's concerned that's how much he's involved every religion have an idol praise the Lord amen every religion has an idol and many of them they made their own Idol and their Idol is just there praise the Lord you see and and and that's the way we try to make God that's the way we try to make him we think we can slam this door go behind this door and do something he will not see us because we left him in church Jesus praise the Lord he knows our very thought he knows the intents of our heart and the Bible says all of our ways are naked in his eyes are we together amen that's how much God is involved people that is how much he's involved he's not just sitting down on his throne okay I will judge these people let me see what they have done I'm waiting for them to come here I will judge them that's the kind of a god denomination gives to us that is the kind of a God that religion has given to us but the god that we serve this morning he's a present tense God he's a god that is real he's a god that is involved in our Affair praise the Lord that's why the prophet of God will tell you when you are stopped in traffic don't get too mad maybe God is keeping you from something from some kind of danger start hitting the wheel and being angry just thank the Lord Lord thank you I mean your angels are in charge I don't know what's going on maybe you are keeping me from some kind of a danger because God is involved he's in charge he's not an impers impersonal God I just set there for his hands and said let me see what they will do praise the Lord he have made us and now we ourself that's what the Simon said he have made us and now we ourself let's Fellowship here as we bring this to a close amen it is as though God made a word of salvation for lost men th that way being the cross and then when the death of Christ was atoned for our sin and his his uh his resurrection gave us an open door God just F his arm and he sto back it is as if we major in believing in a great Creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation that's what the a years want to tell us that's why they don't believe that there is God if there is God while we have all of this trouble right praise the Lord if there is God what what what my life is going through all of this he want to create that question and create that question in our mind what is he after killing the effect in your heart you will just be a b in church but you have no interest of taking go God at his word you have no interest of taking God instruction that's the reason why this age is just to the place where the people want to be entertained just confront them with the word they get they get the gets uh uh Angry they gets I was just thinking about this during the week I say I say how how unfair it is very unfair you go to the doctor you go to the doctor you enter the doctor office you don't know his name the nurses come and tell you that the doctor is coming Dr Joe is coming you never seen this Dr Joe before you're thinking in your mind okay Dr Joe is coming now you are so concerned about the pains that you are dealing with Dr Joe comes in the room of Dr Joseph in whatever whatever it is comes in the room and when the doctor comes he greets you greet you and and he starts to tell you asks you what's going on with you he first did not ask he did not tell you nothing about himself you don't know nothing about him but he start asking you what's going on with you what did you eat today and every question he ask you you answer you don't ask him say why are you asking me this you answer yeah I I at are you sleeping are you really sleeping yeah I do you drink coffee sometime you don't even finish the other one he ask you the next one praise the Lord amen amen and it is this doctor you might go out of that room and never see him again but yet you can tell him about your life and sometimes he gets into the personal things about yourself and then if it require him he tells you undress I'm coming back you don't argue you don't fuss with it no he leaves the room you undress you you wear your G your your your hospital gwn you don't argue with him at all and with all of that he may not even get a diagnosis that you went for he might not even get the diagnosis that you went for he will just tell you okay okay I will send information to your primary care okay okay and you sit down there you don't fce with Dr Joel you don't show him to show to you don't even ask for a medical license it it sound funny praise the Lord amen it sound funny but it's just truth a preacher will come and then uh he's trying to get in contact with you and sometimes he he he brings his personal life and sometime tell you things that he's struggling with and now you think you know him you think you know him all the pr then they are hypocrites but you might not see Dr Joe in your life forever the next time you go to that hospital you might meet Susan whether Dr Joe is struggling with drunkenness you don't know praise the Lord you have a brother you have a sister that sit by you in church Someone that comes to church the same place you come for Fellowship they bow their heads they pray and ask God bless us this morning bless my brother bless my sister but yeah we so easy to take attitude against one another and little thing we flim out because we we are so we we we think that we must we must just we we we we just like all of these entitled children they don't work for anything but they should have everything when God has given us a b he has given us a a group no matter what the size is but he has given us people that we that can earnestly cry to God with tears coming out of their eyes crying and saying God help my brother God help my sister bless us with your presence do something in our midst and here we go through that door we slam it praise the Lord how many times Dr Jesus used me as a preacher just like a nurse but the real doctor that you see is Dr Jesus I'm just the nurse that comes and take information praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen as long as you come to this Clinic you always see me praise the Lord I I bring some other nurses to help us but the main doctor here is Dr [Applause] Jesus do you know what it will be if that reality breaks upon us that a preacher is just bringing us in the presence of Jesus Christ Lord raise my faith oh God Give Me Faith to believe Lord Give Me Faith to receive I don't want to leave here the sameen [Music] do you know what kind of a service we will have I will not need to re bunch of course to you I would just tell you one thing about Jesus Christ and faith will explore in the building glory be to God and sometimes you want to talk to people they get so you know they they just they take an attitude on you it is as though God made the word of Salvation we read this one us already it is as if he he he uh uh we major in believing a great Creator who's been created who who having created lost personal interest in his creation Now I said that as how too many people are able to think but that is that is wrong thinking for God is govering in the Affairs of men praise the Lord he's governing in our Affairs praise the Lord he's govering in our affairs if you have get close to the Lord a little bit and you are sensitive of his presence sometimes you know when an angel wakes you up in the morning you will know because it's different it's effortless amen and sometimes you wake up with such a strength effortless with such a strength you were sleeping but it's just like you drank a cup of coffee amen and just leave that one leave that one also but think about it sleeping and you and you entered into that realm of sleeping you are absent from this realm of Life praise the Lord and don't even know what is happening when you lie down do you know that when you lie down to sleep is just like what happened over the body of Moses there are evil powers and evil spirits trying to possess your body but just like how almighty God Genesis chapter 15 he was watching over the sacrifice when Abraham F asleep he was the one keeping the sacrifice he's watching over you that's how much God is involved that's how much he's involved in your life [Music] we try to remember the last thing we T about before we sleep it's hard to because you don't have control over there God is the one that switch the light off you might be sitting there right down there brother Steve and you know and she's talking to you and before next she hear you snoring he's the one that switched the light off praise the Lord you don't have control over that are you listening to me H yeah yeah yeah that's how much he's involved in our life that's how much he's involved he's not distance away people he didn't redeem us he didn't call us to this glorious calling and just left us to ourself let's stop making our situation bigger than our God praise the Lord but you know one thing about D of Jesus when you come to see him amen he tells you how to dress up he tells you how to dress up and take all of these uh wall things from you and dress up dress up like a gentleman and dress up like a lady he dress you up better amen because he wrap you in the righteousness of his word and then you don't have to struggle with all the the the the walless and and all the things out there but BR says for God is govering in the Affairs of men right now he's both Creator and sustainer he's Creator and sustainer if he gave you life in your body he will take care of you he will provide what is needed for that life to be sustained in your body he's both Creator and sustainer of his Universe the Redeemer is in his Redemption amen he's in his Redemption praise the Lord he might have used men year boas and and and and and and Isaac and all of these different things that was just a picture to show that he's in his Redemption if God will say he number the head on your head that just show how much he's concerned how much he's concerned how much he's close how much he's interested praise the Lord sometimes we think we are doing it that's why we keep feeling we think we are doing it we're trying to change ourself we're trying to make ourself good that's why what we are feeling we must believe that he's here amen he that called me praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah during the week I was I was uh coming from somewhere and then I sto at the stop sign and and this this lady took her daughter across the road and they were entering the place and I saw her giving her daughter a spit bath you know what a spit bath is yes you know she was giving her daughter a spit bath you know she spit on her hand and WEP in her face I sat there I said well I think I'm going to preach on a spit bath praise the Lord amen the Bible say we are watch by the water of the word and where does the water come from from his mouth man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from out of his mouth so the father gave us spit bath amen sometime he needs to take the C from our eyes and you know and clean our mouth a little bit and I I just had a laugh out of Faith but don't don't worry I'm working on it I'm working I already get the inspir pration I just need to put myself before the Lord that's how much God is involved how much that sometimes we need a spit bath he's the one that watches us he's the one that cleanses us he's the one that dresses us up in his righteousness praise the Lord oh my he's both Creator and sustainer cusan 116 year for by him were all things created that are in Heavens that are in the earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or power what is that Dimensions Paul is talking about Dimensions the reality that we live live in every day the reality that we live in every day there are principalities there are powers that are Waring around us we live in that every day we go in and come out of it every day spiritual warfar powers that are that are Waring that you that that you would you you will not be in the house of God power that are Waring and and and I mean that you will not be able to get on your knees to pray but our God is the king of all Spirits praise the Lord amen the king of all Spirits when we will not listening to his word sometimes he will just allow them and they come in trouble us a little bit oh God oh God I really need you oh God I really need you and he's there all the time Our Redeemer is in his Redemption remember he's the one that call us he paid the price he's the one that is doing the work Paul say he's working in us mightily are we to get it amen he has not left his work to us time and time we see him coming behind the preachers and confirming the word to us we see him speaking to our hearts something being said something being Sun sometime he would do he would do things in the creation that will catch our attention because he had not left it to us you know this great God our work in the work of redemption when I think about Jesus being 10 11 years old and going to the Cal shop and Joseph would teach him how to take a Harmon on the nail you have to to hold it like this no you don't you don't do it you knock your finger you have to hold it like this this is the way you hold your Harmon and Joseph will teach him that's what Redemption is when the father call you it's not for you to do the work it's not for you to do the work he's only holding your hands he want that relationship sometime we complain and I've been doing this I've been doing this I've been doing it maybe that's what is not working because you've been doing it the father to take his hands and yet God Almighty standing right there and Joseph is teaching him how to put a ham on on the nail Joseph is teaching him how to S and everything that is going through his mind this is the Redeemer in his Redemption that's all that is going through his mind that the father came down on man and said be me a tabernacle according to the vision that I've given you it was now for Moses to do it all by himself but God came down and he started Distributing the spirit of wisdom and start giving people uh H H skills for them to make curtains is the Redeemer in his Redemption holding our hands and teaching us how to knock a hammer on a nail praise the Lord just like a mother holding the daughter hand and teaching her how to stir in the pot that's how almighty God is to you and myself amen we not serving the buy God no that just stand there and fold hand say let me see what do it if you look through scripture I'll leave this with you you have created such an atmosphere I can preach till tomorrow there's no service on Wednesday so why not preach till tomorrow praise the Lord there's no service till Wednesday why not preach till tomorrow but let me leave this with you it's a subject that we will talk about if you look through the Bible the Bible brings us the character of two sons it's either an adopted son or a bastard son two sons throughout all the scripture that was what was reflected in the twins King and Abel one son will come to adoption the other son will be bastard and when the Redeemer comes in his Redemption he's looking for the son that is interested in the father's business praise the Lord the one he can teach how to put a hammer on the nail no matter how many mistakes he make but he has a heart that is willing to be taught but there is one that have no time to be around that was what Esau was Esau had no time to be around he wanted to be out there he was out all the he was out never had no time to be around two sons we'll talk about it it's a subject I want to bring to you you know my subject is not just one day amen take months to talk about it but I want you to think about it and with the Redeemer in his Redemption what he's looking for is that son and that daughter that is interested when he came down to to uh Mary house what did he said Mar you are too incumber about things that what he said he said but Mary has has choosen the best thing because she's giving herself time to sit and listing two sons you can run it everywhere when a redeemer comes down in his Redemption he's looking for that son like he can show how to solve a math problem problem he's looking for that son you can show how to put a toy car together that's what Redemption is all about it's not laws rules don't do this don't do that it's relationship is the Redeemer the Redeemer the father coming down to create a relationship praise the Lord boas never told Ruth and said no now you have to I want to see you working more than before no when he got attracted to her he told his servants you drop drop wait for her don't let her see it the place that she passed drop more there because all he was looking for is relationship it's not dos and DS It's Not To outwork Us oh I've been working for God I've been working for God God I want to work for God you can work for God you can work for God is the father creating a relationship wanting to spend time with a son and just teach him something little about himself you know when you were growing up I was all of this why I wash you I was you I've seen this thing and the father just give you a little glimp of something he been watching in your life you know how the feeling is when God just showed you something about yourself you sat there and you cried you cried

so good so good love the Lord with all of your heart all of your mind God was wanting us to know that he will bring his love it will be his love that will capture that unseen part of our life his love will work in that dimension of our life the love of God will go as far as affecting our heart we will not explain why we love him it will affect us so much and begins to change our life it is God projecting his [Music] love love the Lord is not a commandment because he knows there is no way we can love him we are born with a nature that is contrary to his but it is God that is reaching down with his love and he's going to affect our life with his love that we were in return turn around and love him [Music] back love the Lord with all of your strength it is God affecting you with his love that you will get strength to stand for what is right is the love of God influencing you to get strength to stand for what is right against your best judgment you can say Lord not my will but your
