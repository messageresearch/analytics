[48:41] shall they call on him in whom they have
[48:45] not
[48:46] believed and how shall they believe in
[48:50] him of whom they have not

[49:36] that father Lord will be able to rightly
[49:38] divide the word of Truth bless your word
[49:41] now to our hearts oh father in Jesus

[49:52] Lord
[49:54] amen
[49:57] how beautiful are the
[49:59] feet that preach the gospel of peace and
[50:02] bring it Glide
[50:04] Tidings now while
[50:07] uh it's it's uh a little bit strange for
[50:11] us this time of the
[50:13] year normally we have uh most of our
[50:16] visitors coming uh between June July in
[50:19] August when uh when when we having nice
[50:23] weather but it's kind of a flip for us
[50:26] it looks like we having more visitor at
[50:28] the end of the year we have brother tan
[50:31] speaking for us last Sunday and brother
[50:34] Thomas on Wednesday night next week we
[50:37] will have a a brother from the Congo
[50:40] brother Ben below me he will be passing
[50:43] back he will speak for us on Sunday and
[50:46] then the Sunday after we will have
[50:48] brother uh uh brother Daniel frer that's
[50:52] brother Jordan's father he will be
[50:54] around visiting with with them so he we
[50:56] will have him to speak for us and now uh
[51:00] uh I I brought this subject of how
[51:02] beautiful are the feet that bring It
[51:04] Good Tidings because of all the visitors
[51:07] we were having and now we having more
[51:09] visitors amen so I believe maybe when we
[51:12] keep preaching on it we will have more
[51:13] visitors coming praise the Lord amen but
[51:17] uh we love the brothers we love the gift
[51:19] that is in the body and uh we love the
[51:23] the the the diversities of ministry so
[51:27] we pray that each one of them will be a
[51:30] blessing to us but this morning as I
[51:33] look at this subject of how how
[51:36] beautiful are the feet that bringeth
[51:37] good tidings now we want to remember
[51:41] that we took uh the prophecy from uh
[51:44] Isaiah
[51:46] 52 and it was speaking about the
[51:49] suffering seven uh it was a prophecy of
[51:53] our Lord Jesus speaking about the
[51:55] suffering seven is is introducing Jesus
[51:59] Christ uh uh uh from uh from the Old
[52:02] Testament coming right into the
[52:05] atonement coming right into uh uh uh his
[52:09] ministry there of uh Isaiah 53 so the
[52:14] prophet Isaiah talking about our lord
[52:17] Jesus or talking about the suffering
[52:20] sevenant Jehovah as a suffering Sant he
[52:23] he he brings out that statement how
[52:26] beautiful are the feet that bring the
[52:28] Good Tidings now so when we look at that
[52:31] the last time we said that is a prophecy
[52:35] that speaks of Jesus in uh uh uh you
[52:40] know in his mediatory work and it also
[52:43] speaks of Jesus what he will be doing in
[52:47] his body the church praise the Lord so
[52:50] this morning we want to look at uh uh
[52:54] let's go to re ration chapter
[52:56] 10 I want to take my time this morning
[53:00] and just bring few scriptural truth to
[53:04] you so it will it will looks like a
[53:08] Bible study it will looks like a
[53:10] teaching but uh uh I would just want to
[53:14] bring
[53:16] uh this to you this morning and uh I
[53:20] pray that the Lord will make it a
[53:23] blessing revelation chap 10 Revelation
[53:26] chapter 10 is a very uh uh it's a very
[53:31] familiar scripture to every one of
[53:35] us because it holds the prophecy they
[53:38] have to do with uh
[53:41] uh the opening of the seals the
[53:43] revealing of the seals the seven tunder
[53:46] the seven Angel messenger and all and
[53:50] all of
[53:52] that but I want you to pay attention to
[53:55] verse two I will read I will read from
[53:58] verse one but uh the reason why I'm I'm
[54:01] going to Revelation chapter 10 because
[54:04] in verse two the Bible say he had a
[54:06] little book in his hand he set his right
[54:09] foot upon the seed and his left foot
[54:11] upon the earth now that that that of
[54:15] that angel we want to identify this
[54:17] morning in the scriptures and in the
[54:19] message of the hour now because uh uh uh
[54:23] that has to happen
[54:26] to also fulfill the prophecy that Paul
[54:30] pick up in Romans chapter 10 now it was
[54:33] Paul that uh we read in Romans chapter
[54:36] 10 when he pick up the prophecy of
[54:39] Isaiah how beautiful are the faith that
[54:42] bringeth good tidings now yet in
[54:44] Revelation chapter 10 here we seeing an
[54:47] a mighty Angel standing with one foot on
[54:50] the seed and one foot on the earth that
[54:53] has to happen for us to have the message
[54:57] of the
[54:57] hour praise the lord we we would not be
[55:01] sitting here believing the message of
[55:03] the hour or uh if God didn't move in
[55:08] this direction so that's what I want for
[55:11] us to pay attention to this morning I
[55:13] pray that the holy spirit will be our
[55:16] help let's read from Revelation chap 10
[55:18] verse
[55:21] one praise the
[55:24] Lord
[55:25] you love the
[55:27] Lord
[55:28] [Music]
[55:30] amen Revelation chap 10 verse
[55:37] one and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[55:41] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[55:44] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[55:48] face was as it were the Sun and his feet
[55:53] as pillows of
[55:56] fire and he had in his hands a little
[55:59] book and he set his right foot upon the
[56:03] sea and his left foot upon the earth now
[56:06] I was talking with a brother uh a couple
[56:09] of weeks ago and uh uh we were just we
[56:12] were uh visiting and then uh you know uh
[56:16] he he asks a question he says uh uh uh
[56:20] when did this happen you know he was he
[56:23] was of The View that uh uh uh the
[56:27] prophecy of uh uh Revelation chap 10
[56:31] really do not address the ministry of
[56:34] the brother Brandon so he were asking
[56:37] when did this happen when did we see his
[56:39] foot upon the sand and upon the
[56:42] sea so I told him I says well I mean if
[56:45] you if you read the scripture you go
[56:48] back to Revelation chapter 13 you will
[56:50] be able to understand when did it happen
[56:54] you know so we talk a little bit and uh
[56:57] uh
[56:59] uh and I I I I realized that okay I
[57:03] think this is a teaching problem maybe
[57:05] he have he have not he have not been
[57:07] taught that he have not seen that but
[57:09] while I was driving back I drove almost
[57:12] two hours to meet this brother and while
[57:14] I was driving back I kept thinking about
[57:16] it I said well I mean uh uh I can I can
[57:19] see because if uh if you are not rightly
[57:22] placing the scripture you will never be
[57:24] able to see it
[57:25] so I started thinking about it so uh
[57:28] this going week while while I was
[57:30] studying and I was thinking about okay
[57:33] I've been speaking about the Fai that
[57:35] bringeth good tidings then I thought I
[57:37] said well okay I think I should use the
[57:40] privilege to be able to bring this to
[57:42] the church uh for the benefit of those
[57:45] that uh uh you know have not had that
[57:48] understanding to be able to see it as
[57:50] well so let's continue to
[57:53] read verse two again in and uh and he
[57:56] had a little book he had he had in his
[58:00] hand a little uh book open and he set
[58:03] his right foot upon the seed and his
[58:05] left foot on the earth and with a loud
[58:09] voice as when a lion ruleth and when he
[58:14] have cried seven Thunder utter their
[58:17] voices and when the seven tunder had
[58:20] altered their voices I was about to
[58:23] write and I heard a voice from Heaven
[58:25] saying unto me seal up those things
[58:28] which the seven Thunder alth and write
[58:32] them
[58:33] net and the servant and and the angel
[58:37] which I saw stand upon the seed and upon
[58:40] the Earth lifted up his hands to heaven
[58:45] and swore by him that liveth forever and
[58:48] ever who created the Heaven and the
[58:51] things that are dead in the Earth and
[58:55] the things that are
[58:59] therein that are there in are and the
[59:02] seed and the things which are there in
[59:04] that there should be time no longer but
[59:09] in the days of the voice of the seven
[59:11] Angel when he shall begin to sign the
[59:16] mystery of God should be finish as he
[59:20] have declared to his servants the
[59:23] prophets
[59:25] praise the
[59:26] Lord
[59:28] amen so as we as we want to look at this
[59:31] together I would want us to go to
[59:34] Revelation chapter 13 now pay attention
[59:39] and I told you I would try to take my
[59:41] time
[59:43] uh I'm not a teacher by calling but
[59:53] uh ask your your pastor I want to take
[59:55] take take my time to approach this
[59:58] praise the Lord now so when you go to
[1:00:00] Revelation chapter 13 which of course
[1:00:03] Revelation chapter 13 is very important
[1:00:06] because it holds a very very important
[1:00:09] Prophecy of the time that we are living
[1:00:12] in and also a very important Prophecy of
[1:00:16] the nation that we are living in brother
[1:00:18] brandham says uh United States comes out
[1:00:21] in Revelation chapter 13 that's what I
[1:00:23] want for us to try to see this morning
[1:00:26] as we'll be looking at uh few scriptures
[1:00:29] and few courts praise the
[1:00:32] Lord now in Revelation chapter 13 let's
[1:00:35] read from verse
[1:00:38] one John says and I stood upon the sand
[1:00:44] of the
[1:00:45] sea and saw a
[1:00:48] beast rise up out of the
[1:00:52] sea as as I'm going with the days I will
[1:00:55] be pointing you now remember now our
[1:00:57] focus is revelation 10 verse 2 the angel
[1:01:02] have one foot on the
[1:01:05] sea and one foot on the earth praise the
[1:01:10] Lord now in Revelation chapter 13 John
[1:01:15] is saying as I stood upon the sand of
[1:01:18] the sea I saw a beast rise up out of the
[1:01:23] sea having seven hairs and 10
[1:01:27] horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and
[1:01:32] upon his head the name of
[1:01:37] blasphemy praise the
[1:01:39] Lord are we together amen let's read
[1:01:43] down a little bit and the Beast which I
[1:01:47] sought was like unto a
[1:01:51] leper and his feet were as as the feet
[1:01:55] of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of
[1:02:00] a
[1:02:00] lion and the dragon gave him his power
[1:02:05] and his seed and great Authority now we
[1:02:09] will not be able to understand this
[1:02:12] until we go back to the Book of
[1:02:17] Daniel Daniel the Prophet Daniel came in
[1:02:21] such a time where God God will speak a
[1:02:26] whole lot about the Gentile
[1:02:29] dispensation praise the Lord he will
[1:02:32] speak a whole lot about the Gentile
[1:02:36] dispensation we will see as we go to
[1:02:39] Daniel chapter 7 let's turn our Bibles
[1:02:41] to Daniel chapter
[1:02:50] 7 Daniel chapter
[1:02:53] 7
[1:03:06] praise the
[1:03:21] Lord Danel chapter 7 if you read from
[1:03:24] verse one in the first year of belzar
[1:03:27] King of Babylon Daniel had a dream and a
[1:03:30] vision of his head upon his bed then he
[1:03:34] wrote the dream and told the PSM of the
[1:03:39] matter Daniel speak and said I saw in my
[1:03:44] vision by night and
[1:03:47] behold the four wings of Heaven stro
[1:03:51] upon the Great
[1:03:53] Sea and four great beasts came up from
[1:03:58] the sea diverse one from
[1:04:03] another and the
[1:04:06] first was like a
[1:04:08] lion and had Eagle wings and I beheld
[1:04:12] till the wings thereof was plucked and
[1:04:15] it was lifted up from the earth and uh
[1:04:19] May stand upon uh the feet as a man and
[1:04:23] a man's heart was given to it and behold
[1:04:27] another
[1:04:29] Beast a second like a bear now remember
[1:04:32] now the first be was like a lion the
[1:04:35] second is like a bear and it rise up
[1:04:38] itself as uh itself on one side and it
[1:04:43] had three rapes in uh the mouth of it
[1:04:47] between the teeth of it and they said
[1:04:52] thus unto it arise th all much flesh and
[1:04:57] after this I
[1:04:59] beheld and lo another like a lepro now
[1:05:04] when you go back to Revelation chapter
[1:05:07] 13 this Beast that that John
[1:05:11] saw praise the Lord are we there let's
[1:05:15] go back to Revelation Chapter 30 we will
[1:05:18] come back to Daniel again just just I I
[1:05:20] want you to grab the picture so um uh uh
[1:05:24] I'm not going to to to get
[1:05:28] excited I'm trying to hold my feet in my
[1:05:32] shoes praise the
[1:05:34] Lord now in Revelation chap chapter 13
[1:05:38] that we just
[1:05:41] read John is describing this Beast that
[1:05:45] came out of the seed with uh with uh uh
[1:05:49] 10 horns and seven head he said the
[1:05:53] beach which I which I saw in verse
[1:05:56] two was like a leper and he had a feet
[1:06:01] like a bed he had a mouth like a
[1:06:04] lion now in Daniel
[1:06:07] Vision Daniel is
[1:06:10] seeing uh uh in his vision he's seeing
[1:06:14] all of these beasts that is uh he's
[1:06:17] seeing the Beast rising up as a lion
[1:06:21] having great wings like an eagle but the
[1:06:23] Beast is a lion that's that's the Beast
[1:06:25] I want you to pay attention to he's
[1:06:28] seeing another Beast that is rising like
[1:06:30] a Beed and he's seeing another Beast
[1:06:33] that is also Rising like a
[1:06:36] leper praise the Lord now there is a
[1:06:40] fourth Beast that Daniel that Daniel saw
[1:06:45] we will read that also but this fourth
[1:06:47] Beast was so
[1:06:50] mysterious that it did not had uh and
[1:06:54] identification just like the first one
[1:06:56] was like a lion and the second one was
[1:06:59] like a bear the fourth Beast was very
[1:07:01] very mysterious now let's get a
[1:07:04] background before Daniel will have these
[1:07:07] dreams you will have to remember that
[1:07:10] the King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream that
[1:07:14] troubled
[1:07:16] him and in his dream he dreamed about an
[1:07:20] image that had a head of gold and the
[1:07:24] the the the breast was like sver and uh
[1:07:28] and and and the lungs like like Browns
[1:07:30] and the feet was like iron but he when
[1:07:33] he woke up from his sleep he forgot the
[1:07:36] dream the dream troubled him praise the
[1:07:39] Lord and then he will call all the wise
[1:07:42] men of the kingom and uh and and you
[1:07:46] know and no one will give him the
[1:07:47] interpretation until Daniel would come
[1:07:50] and give him the
[1:07:51] interpretation praise the Lord amen
[1:07:54] amen and when Daniel will give him the
[1:07:58] interpretation Daniel will bring the
[1:08:01] interpretation and the the
[1:08:03] interpretation will be concerning the
[1:08:06] Gentile Kingdom the succession of the
[1:08:09] Gentile
[1:08:10] Kingdom which will start from Babylon
[1:08:12] the head of
[1:08:14] God and the the the the the m and and
[1:08:18] Persian the uh the the breast of savor
[1:08:22] and then the the Greeks which which is
[1:08:25] brow and then the Roman which is iron
[1:08:28] that is in the
[1:08:30] lead
[1:08:31] now God is giving this Prophet
[1:08:36] Daniel an
[1:08:38] interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:08:41] dream that is going to cover the span of
[1:08:45] time from the bonian kingdom to the time
[1:08:50] that we are living
[1:08:52] in Praise the
[1:08:54] Lord amen just like I said to you before
[1:08:59] there is no time you will realize that
[1:09:02] even the time that we are living in
[1:09:04] right now is more spoken of in the Bible
[1:09:09] than any any time the Bible History have
[1:09:12] ever
[1:09:14] covered are we
[1:09:17] together praise the Lord God is giving
[1:09:22] Daniel an interpretation of this King's
[1:09:25] dream to be able to show the war power
[1:09:31] what we will call
[1:09:34] superpower according to God's
[1:09:37] word the superpower that will control
[1:09:40] the Gentile kingdom is not Russia is not
[1:09:44] America and know according to God's word
[1:09:48] it is these four
[1:09:50] Kingdom that one will go after the other
[1:09:54] and then after the other and now we find
[1:09:57] ourselves stay under the Roman
[1:10:00] Kingdom I will show that to
[1:10:03] you now so those were the political
[1:10:08] Powers Daniel will now have a
[1:10:12] dream and God will now show him four
[1:10:18] beasts praise the Lord because beast in
[1:10:22] the Bible represent in
[1:10:24] power amen it's also proven we talk
[1:10:29] about H power in our in our modern
[1:10:34] science and uh uh uh so God will now
[1:10:38] give Daniel a dream and the significance
[1:10:42] of this dream is to show to
[1:10:46] Daniel the influence that is behind all
[1:10:50] of these political power so what
[1:10:53] Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about was the
[1:10:56] political power that would Ru the
[1:10:59] Gentile Kingdom what God will reveal to
[1:11:03] Daniel is the
[1:11:06] influence the strength that are Behind
[1:11:09] These political
[1:11:12] powers are we
[1:11:16] together I are you getting the
[1:11:18] picture praise the Lord So Daniel we
[1:11:23] have have this dream back in Daniel
[1:11:26] chapter
[1:11:36] 7 back in Daniel chapter 7 we read verse
[1:11:40] six the next beat was like a lepr then
[1:11:44] verse seven Daniel we say after this I
[1:11:48] saw in the night vision and behold a
[1:11:51] four Beast it was Dreadful it was
[1:11:53] terrible and strong exceeding and it had
[1:11:57] great iron teeth it divor and break in
[1:12:00] pieces and stem the rested you with the
[1:12:03] the feet of it and and it was diverse
[1:12:07] from all the beasts that were before it
[1:12:10] and it had 10
[1:12:13] homes it had 10
[1:12:17] homes praise the
[1:12:19] Lord are we
[1:12:22] together
[1:12:25] back to Revelation chapter
[1:12:31] 13 now so in
[1:12:34] Daniel n Vision we are seeing four
[1:12:39] beasts that is uh uh
[1:12:43] identified in the in the form of a lion
[1:12:45] in the form of a bed in the form of a
[1:12:49] leper the fourth one is very mysterious
[1:12:54] amen different from all the others very
[1:12:57] very mysterious they come up with 10
[1:13:01] horns when John in Revelation chapter 13
[1:13:06] now see the span of time between Daniel
[1:13:11] n vision and John on the island of
[1:13:17] pmos Praise the Lord amen see the span
[1:13:21] of time and year God will be giving John
[1:13:25] H a
[1:13:26] visitation a vision on the island of
[1:13:29] pmos and he will and and and he will
[1:13:32] write and let us to know we go back to
[1:13:34] verse one again I st I stood upon the
[1:13:38] sand of the seed and saw a beast rise
[1:13:41] out of the sea having seven head and 10
[1:13:45] horns now in Daniel Vision the last
[1:13:49] Beast that he saw had 10
[1:13:52] horns it was very
[1:13:54] mysterious but if there is one thing
[1:13:57] that we can
[1:13:58] identify from that last beast and bring
[1:14:01] it back to what John is seeing
[1:14:04] here that that last Beast had 10
[1:14:08] horns this Beast that join the seene
[1:14:11] rising from the sea also have 10
[1:14:15] horns praise the Lord are we together
[1:14:19] now one of the thing that is that is
[1:14:23] very
[1:14:25] important that we help
[1:14:28] us is
[1:14:31] uh let's go back to John uh Daniel
[1:14:34] chapter
[1:14:37] 12 let's go back to Daniel chapter
[1:14:42] 12 praise the Lord you love the
[1:14:46] Lord
[1:14:50] amen that's what happen when you start
[1:14:52] teaching it gets very
[1:14:53] quiet because everybody is trying to pay
[1:14:56] attention there is no emotion amen for
[1:15:01] us to get excited because we have to
[1:15:03] understand before we get excited amen
[1:15:05] you just don't get excited because you
[1:15:07] want to be excited amen you have to
[1:15:10] understand what the preacher is
[1:15:12] saying now if you read in Daniel chapter
[1:15:17] 12 I want I want to pick up some few
[1:15:19] things here if you reading Daniel
[1:15:22] chapter 12 you realize that uh uh God is
[1:15:27] revealing some things to
[1:15:31] Daniel
[1:15:34] Amen and uh
[1:15:39] uh I just I want to pick up pick up a
[1:15:41] verse here so uh we
[1:15:45] can we can uh
[1:15:49] uh okay let's look at uh verse two quick
[1:15:54] and many of them that slept in the dust
[1:15:56] of the Earth shall shall awake some to
[1:15:58] everlasting life and some to shame and
[1:16:00] everlasting contempt and they that and
[1:16:03] and they that be wise as shine as the
[1:16:06] brightness of the firmament and they
[1:16:09] that turn many into righteousness as the
[1:16:12] Stars forever and ever but thou oh
[1:16:15] Daniel shut up the words and seal the
[1:16:21] book even to the time of the end many
[1:16:26] shall run to and forth and knowledge
[1:16:29] shall increase now the reason why I'm
[1:16:31] reading this is because lot of what God
[1:16:34] revealed to Daniel here the angel is
[1:16:37] telling him shut the book most of what I
[1:16:40] have revealed to you is for the time of
[1:16:43] the end now that's the reason why when
[1:16:46] God is dealing with John on the island
[1:16:48] of pmos he had to bring up some of the
[1:16:51] things that Daniel saw
[1:16:55] are we together so Daniel had this
[1:16:58] Vision God say shut up the book these
[1:17:00] things are for the time of the
[1:17:03] end praise the Lord amen now uh uh for
[1:17:08] for for for the for us to have a
[1:17:12] continuation we must have a sense of
[1:17:15] repeat or
[1:17:19] reveal so as God is revealing to John
[1:17:24] things concerning the time of the end
[1:17:27] what is he going back he's going back
[1:17:29] and picking up from Daniel Vision
[1:17:32] because Daniel Vision was concerning the
[1:17:35] time of the end are we together praise
[1:17:40] the
[1:17:41] Lord you will see where we come into the
[1:17:44] feet that bringeth good
[1:17:46] tidings praise the Lord because if you
[1:17:49] look through the scripture some of these
[1:17:51] feet that brought us good tidings
[1:17:53] they never came to us so
[1:17:57] easily amen you think about
[1:18:01] Moses after killing an Egyptian and
[1:18:04] running into the
[1:18:06] Wilderness and God will meet him by a
[1:18:09] burning bush and say go and tell Pharaoh
[1:18:12] let my people go that message was good
[1:18:16] Tiding but it never came so
[1:18:19] easy Moses first he have to go back and
[1:18:23] face his
[1:18:24] failure because he fell in
[1:18:27] Egypt praise the Lord and most of the
[1:18:30] people knew that he came up as a a great
[1:18:33] deliverer kill one Egyptian and run in
[1:18:35] the wilderness he had to go back and
[1:18:37] face his failure he had to go back and
[1:18:41] face H H
[1:18:43] Pharaoh praise the Lord
[1:18:47] amen which pretty much was uh was the
[1:18:51] the the very Pharaoh you you know in in
[1:18:54] the same uh uh House of uh of the of the
[1:18:57] Egyptian Kingdom when he was
[1:19:00] there praise the Lord and he never just
[1:19:04] went and said Pharaoh you know uh the
[1:19:06] Lord God said let my people go and pH
[1:19:09] say okay you're go no he he he got
[1:19:12] resistance pharoh said no get it from
[1:19:15] here and and we know the time of the
[1:19:17] plague and and and uh we we know the
[1:19:19] great Deliverance that came down the
[1:19:21] mighty Red Sea Hing they Rejoice about
[1:19:24] it but then when they got into the
[1:19:27] Wilderness he even had to deal with his
[1:19:30] own
[1:19:32] people praise the
[1:19:35] Lord so this feet that brings Good
[1:19:38] Tidings they just don't come on saor
[1:19:42] platter praise the
[1:19:44] Lord Joshua was supposed to take the
[1:19:47] people into the promised land God told
[1:19:49] Moses this is Joshua commission he will
[1:19:52] distri build the land but he had to
[1:19:54] fight for every inch of
[1:19:58] ground he was bringing them to their
[1:20:01] land he was bringing them to their
[1:20:03] inheritance it was a good it was a feet
[1:20:06] that was bringing Good
[1:20:08] Tidings but yet it had a
[1:20:11] resistance praise the Lord amen so
[1:20:15] that's what I want to show you as we
[1:20:17] look into this so God is telling Daniel
[1:20:20] shut up the book SE up these things from
[1:20:22] uh to the time of the end you know uh
[1:20:25] knowledge shall increase and and and men
[1:20:27] will run to and forth now back to uh
[1:20:31] Revelation chapter
[1:20:34] 13 praise the
[1:20:39] Lord are we
[1:20:51] together now so in Revelation chapter 13
[1:20:55] yeah we look again in verse one I stood
[1:20:58] upon the sand of the seed and I saw a
[1:21:00] beast rising up out of the seed having
[1:21:03] seven hairs and 10 horns the 10 horns is
[1:21:06] identified there in Daniel vision and
[1:21:10] upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his
[1:21:14] head the name of
[1:21:17] blasphemy praise the Lord
[1:21:21] amen now so uh uh we can go to
[1:21:26] Revelation chapter 17 to be able to
[1:21:31] identify this uh uh Beast out of
[1:21:35] Revelation chapter 13 let's go to
[1:21:37] Revelation chapter
[1:21:51] 17
[1:21:55] are we
[1:21:56] together this will give us uh uh a lot
[1:22:01] of reading but let's just let's just
[1:22:03] stick together the picture will come
[1:22:05] together amen Revelation Chap 17:1 and
[1:22:08] there came one of the Seven Angels which
[1:22:10] had the seven VES and talked with me
[1:22:13] saying come hither I will show Thee I
[1:22:16] will show onto Thee the Judgment of the
[1:22:18] Great Hall and they
[1:22:20] seated upon many
[1:22:23] Waters praise the Lord amen that Beast
[1:22:28] was rising out of the seed it was coming
[1:22:31] from out of the water so I want us to
[1:22:34] pay attention to that I know many of us
[1:22:36] you have an idea with whom the kings of
[1:22:39] the Earth have had fornication and the
[1:22:42] inhabitants of the Earth have have been
[1:22:45] made drunk with the wine of her
[1:22:47] fornication so he carried me away that
[1:22:49] angel carried me away in the spirit into
[1:22:52] the Wilderness and I saw a woman sitting
[1:22:55] upon a scarlet color Beast full of names
[1:22:59] of blasphemic having seven head and 10
[1:23:02] horns so we can push this back over to
[1:23:04] Revelation chapter 13 that Beast that
[1:23:07] came from out of the seed with seven
[1:23:08] head and and uh uh uh 10
[1:23:12] horns praise the Lord
[1:23:16] amen and the woman was array in purple
[1:23:20] and and and scarlet color dark with
[1:23:23] God and uh uh and and all and all the
[1:23:27] arrayment there verse five and upon her
[1:23:30] forehead was a name written mystery
[1:23:33] Babylon the great the mother of halot
[1:23:36] and the Abominations of the earth praise
[1:23:38] the Lord amen so what what I want us to
[1:23:42] see here and uh
[1:23:49] uh let's go down to verse 9
[1:23:53] let's go down to verse 9 and here is the
[1:23:56] mind which have wisdom the seven hairs
[1:23:59] are seven
[1:24:01] mountains on which the woman
[1:24:04] sth praise the Lord
[1:24:11] amen and there are seven Kings five are
[1:24:14] fallen and one is and the other to come
[1:24:17] but I want us to to to be able to pay
[1:24:19] attention to that verse 12 will tell us
[1:24:22] that the 10 horns which they are saw are
[1:24:24] 10
[1:24:27] Kings they are 10
[1:24:32] Kings which have received no Kingdom as
[1:24:37] yet a king for him to be a king he has
[1:24:42] to have a
[1:24:43] kingdom so if if there are 10 Kings and
[1:24:47] there are no Kingdom so that it shows
[1:24:50] there these are detectors
[1:24:52] they don't have a kingdom but they have
[1:24:54] power as
[1:24:55] kings they have no Kingdom at yet but
[1:24:58] receive power as king one hour with the
[1:25:01] Beast now so I'm bringing all of this
[1:25:05] because I want to build this picture
[1:25:07] before I get back over to Revelation
[1:25:09] chapter 10 now so we see here that uh
[1:25:13] this uh uh uh 10 you know uh uh seven
[1:25:18] hairs and 10 horns and crowns and name
[1:25:22] blaspheming we see that the scripture
[1:25:26] interpreting itself is letting us know
[1:25:29] that this is all about uh uh a woman
[1:25:32] which is a type of a church and we know
[1:25:35] that uh it all goes back to the Vatican
[1:25:39] the Vatican is the only church that is
[1:25:41] on Seven
[1:25:42] Hills are we
[1:25:44] together amen now the reason why I'm
[1:25:48] saying this is that whether you like it
[1:25:52] or
[1:25:53] not from the time of our Lord
[1:25:58] Jesus that that Beast system that
[1:26:02] mysterious Beast that Dan saw took a
[1:26:06] clear watch to our our lord Jesus even
[1:26:11] what is happening now in Palestine in
[1:26:13] Jerusalem is all under the influence of
[1:26:17] this
[1:26:18] power after you have to realize it was
[1:26:21] after
[1:26:22] it was during the time of the Roman rule
[1:26:25] when our lord Jesus was right there when
[1:26:28] he was crucified amen Rome wanted to
[1:26:32] know what was the power behind that
[1:26:35] simple man pet
[1:26:38] Marvel when he knew that Jesus was not
[1:26:41] guilty but yet he would not defend
[1:26:43] himself they wanted to understand what
[1:26:46] what was this about this man praise the
[1:26:50] Lord and after our lord Jesus Jesus was
[1:26:54] crucified and he
[1:26:56] resurrected and the and the Holy Spirit
[1:26:58] came back on the church praise the Lord
[1:27:02] Rome watched closely they saw how the
[1:27:05] early the early Christian how they will
[1:27:09] realize and they talk about the power of
[1:27:11] Jesus and they talk about all of the
[1:27:13] things that happened that is the reason
[1:27:16] why when the when the Roman Governor
[1:27:18] Titus came and besieged Jerusalem after
[1:27:21] Jerusalem was
[1:27:23] bese praise the Lord amen Rome ruled
[1:27:28] that place for the
[1:27:30] why to erase the
[1:27:33] history of the raising Christ to erase
[1:27:37] the history of what happened there they
[1:27:40] were the ones that changed to change the
[1:27:43] the the identity of the place it was the
[1:27:47] Roman government that changed it from uh
[1:27:49] uh Jerusalem and named that place is
[1:27:54] Palestinian so for the while it lost its
[1:28:00] identity praise the
[1:28:03] Lord because you have to realize that uh
[1:28:07] uh H caias and uh and and and the sedran
[1:28:11] council H presented Jesus Christ as the
[1:28:14] king of the
[1:28:18] Jews praise the Lord because they
[1:28:21] thought that if they present Jesus as
[1:28:23] the king of the Jews is going to make
[1:28:26] the Roman h h h government Furious
[1:28:29] because they should have no other king
[1:28:30] beside
[1:28:33] Caesar are we
[1:28:35] together so what am I trying to bring to
[1:28:38] you this morning is there the uh we were
[1:28:41] going into a little bit as we go into
[1:28:43] Revelation chapter 13 but from that time
[1:28:47] Rome started taking over and that was
[1:28:50] when the persecution all the church
[1:28:53] started they were trying to stamp the
[1:28:55] name of Jesus Christ trying to stem God
[1:28:58] out of the people and on and on as we
[1:29:02] would come to see it there was there was
[1:29:04] there was a change from Pagan Rome to
[1:29:10] Papa
[1:29:11] amen praise the Lord and when Papa room
[1:29:16] came that was when uh H H uh Rome in in
[1:29:19] all of a uh uh uh idolatrous worship
[1:29:23] triy to emerge with the
[1:29:26] church so the Christian Church present
[1:29:30] it now we having a great challenge
[1:29:33] because all that we know over the
[1:29:37] history over the the spend of time of
[1:29:39] Christianity all that we have
[1:29:42] today is greatly influenced by
[1:29:47] Rome praise the Lord amen amen all that
[1:29:52] we have
[1:29:57] today because because uh cism took
[1:30:03] over they took the Bibles they took the
[1:30:06] pure word from the
[1:30:09] people and they gave us all of these
[1:30:12] forms that we
[1:30:16] have set up
[1:30:19] choirs so the clergy can be entertained
[1:30:23] praise the
[1:30:26] Lord and most of what we have around
[1:30:29] Christian D that we call the church
[1:30:32] today is influenced by
[1:30:38] calm praise the
[1:30:41] Lord
[1:30:43] amen but God reach in Mercy amen the god
[1:30:49] F of all Grace
[1:30:53] praise the
[1:30:54] Lord came down with an open
[1:30:58] book and he had onef on the
[1:31:02] sea and onef on the
[1:31:05] earth praise the Lord to deliver
[1:31:09] us to bring us Good
[1:31:13] Tidings if we will ever go back to the
[1:31:16] origin of
[1:31:19] faith if we will ever go back to a
[1:31:21] Church where
[1:31:23] Christ is in the
[1:31:27] center of the
[1:31:29] Believers praise the Lord if we don't
[1:31:32] have that we are just having the form
[1:31:35] form of godliness and denying the power
[1:31:39] thereof which of course Paul told us to
[1:31:41] turn
[1:31:45] away are we
[1:31:48] together praise the
[1:31:50] Lord
[1:31:52] that is
[1:31:53] how strong
[1:31:56] because just like all of those
[1:31:59] superpower or
[1:32:01] nation that that Nebuchadnezzar saw in
[1:32:05] his
[1:32:06] dream all of those beasts that Daniel
[1:32:10] saw in his vision was the power that was
[1:32:14] behind the
[1:32:15] nation every nation has a spiritual
[1:32:19] power behind
[1:32:20] it
[1:32:24] am are we
[1:32:27] together
[1:32:29] amen every nation has a spiritual power
[1:32:32] behind it every group of people every
[1:32:35] tribe every Gathering of people and I
[1:32:38] also believe that every church has a
[1:32:40] power behind
[1:32:43] it and the power that must be behind the
[1:32:46] Church of the Living God is the Holy
[1:32:49] Ghost the Holy Ghost should be the one
[1:32:52] influencing what we are doing it's not
[1:32:54] men's coming together and deciding and
[1:32:56] making an idea how we can make a better
[1:33:03] church are we
[1:33:06] together praise the
[1:33:08] Lord So Daniel Nebuchadnezzar had a
[1:33:13] dream that
[1:33:14] shows the the natural
[1:33:17] kingdoms Daniel being the prophet he had
[1:33:21] Vision that revealed the power that was
[1:33:25] behind each of those
[1:33:30] Nations praise the Lord are we
[1:33:37] together so yeah we
[1:33:40] see that uh John is letting us to know
[1:33:44] that this Beast that he's talking about
[1:33:46] from Revelation chapter
[1:33:48] 13 is a power that has rise out of the
[1:33:53] seed and in Revelation chapter 17 he
[1:33:56] said the seed represent multitudes of
[1:34:00] people praise the Lord and this power uh
[1:34:05] it has it has uh seven heads which which
[1:34:08] of course is seven mountains and and 10
[1:34:10] uh horns which of course uh represent is
[1:34:13] 10 Kings which of course they they don't
[1:34:16] have a kingdom how are they
[1:34:18] Kings because they are appointed by the
[1:34:20] popes
[1:34:22] praise the Lord they are appointed by
[1:34:24] the pope so we see here that's that's
[1:34:27] not where I'm going I'm just giving you
[1:34:29] too much information than where I want
[1:34:31] to go this morning but I need to do that

[1:35:00] feet like a Beed he had a mouth like a
[1:35:03] lion and the
[1:35:06] dragon now the dragon now will be this
[1:35:09] Beast that Daniel could not
[1:35:13] describe because Daniel had a beast that
[1:35:16] he could not
[1:35:19] describe which was the fourth Beast
[1:35:23] praise the Lord amen then uh uh uh John
[1:35:28] is saying and the dragon give give him
[1:35:31] his power and his seat and his
[1:35:35] authority praise the
[1:35:37] Lord amen and I saw one of his head as
[1:35:43] it it were wounded to death and his
[1:35:46] daily wound was
[1:35:48] healed and all the word one th after the
[1:35:55] Beast and they worship the
[1:35:57] dragon which gave power unto the Beast
[1:36:02] praise the Lord
[1:36:07] amen saying who is like unto the Beast
[1:36:12] who is able to make wall with her let's
[1:36:16] just read some few things here uh that
[1:36:19] will that will try to help help uh us uh
[1:36:24] anchor this
[1:36:26] together are we together praise the Lord
[1:36:31] praise the Lord let me just share few
[1:36:34] things with
[1:36:40] you praise the
[1:36:45] Lord
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:59] okay we let's let's read from the mark
[1:37:01] of the beast
[1:37:03] here there's that red
[1:37:06] dragon the
[1:37:08] devil not in Russia in
[1:37:12] Rome and said the devil gave him
[1:37:17] power give him his seat his authority
[1:37:22] red dragon n
[1:37:24] russer I've heard great ministers
[1:37:29] say the the Russian is the Antichrist
[1:37:34] why the Russian has nothing to do with
[1:37:37] the Antichrist that's
[1:37:39] communism the false tra of protest Pro
[1:37:43] protesting and cism has produced
[1:37:47] communism the
[1:37:50] reason that the Russian drove them out
[1:37:52] of there because they had all the money
[1:37:56] and had all the prayers said to them
[1:38:00] sins so they buil the biggest building
[1:38:03] and have all the wealth of the people
[1:38:06] and bundle it up like that now this this
[1:38:09] will give us uh a picture
[1:38:12] here you have to realize that uh uh uh
[1:38:17] most of these communist country they had
[1:38:20] their time of
[1:38:22] Revival if you go back to 1909 you will
[1:38:25] know that there was a Revival in North
[1:38:29] Korea that a Revival which was uh the
[1:38:33] the breaking out of the Holy Spirit they
[1:38:36] had they had the move of
[1:38:39] God now so here uh brother Bram is
[1:38:42] giving us a a a history of how how these
[1:38:46] nations turned to be communist nation is
[1:38:50] because of the misrepresentation of the
[1:38:54] Gospel praise the
[1:38:57] Lord here in America we are not we are
[1:39:00] not turning to communist but we having a
[1:39:03] a large growing of agnostic people and
[1:39:07] Atheism why because of the
[1:39:09] misrepresentation of the
[1:39:13] Gospel when we have all of our mega
[1:39:16] churches preaching Prosperity
[1:39:19] Gospel praise the Lord
[1:39:21] when we have men that are preaching the
[1:39:23] word of God and living completely
[1:39:25] different from what the word requir them
[1:39:28] to
[1:39:29] live all all it does is it just hiding
[1:39:33] the hearts of the
[1:39:34] people am praise the Lord it hide in the
[1:39:38] hearts of the people why should we
[1:39:40] preach something from the gospel and
[1:39:42] they can't see
[1:39:45] it we preach a god of love and there is
[1:39:48] just bunch of hatred among the people
[1:39:53] so that is affecting the society and
[1:39:56] brother Braham is saying that is the
[1:39:57] same thing that happened over in Russia
[1:39:59] that's the reason why they drove the
[1:40:01] Protestant Church they having their own
[1:40:03] Russian Orthodox Church why because
[1:40:07] capitalism was ended and all with this
[1:40:10] Purgatory you got to pay for the dead
[1:40:12] and they go after the rich people and
[1:40:15] and and they bring their children into
[1:40:16] the convent and make n a nons out of
[1:40:19] them just to go after their parents'
[1:40:21] wealth they did all of those
[1:40:28] things praise the Lord and they were
[1:40:31] gathering the wealth of the people and
[1:40:34] you will not be surprised it was some of
[1:40:36] the things that caused the persecution
[1:40:38] of the
[1:40:40] Jews because they thought that the Jews
[1:40:43] were they were the business
[1:40:47] men praise the Lord so all of those
[1:40:50] things things that affected uh H H uh
[1:40:53] the the church in
[1:40:56] Russia is because we have this uh H H
[1:41:01] system we have this system it's a system
[1:41:05] praise the
[1:41:06] Lord and that system is after every one
[1:41:09] of us it don't care what church you go
[1:41:12] to what the name is if the system can
[1:41:16] kill the effect of God in your life if
[1:41:19] the system can give you a Reas
[1:41:22] to believe that church is just a
[1:41:26] game the system get a hold of
[1:41:30] you praise the Lord because we will read
[1:41:33] from the scripture sh that that system
[1:41:36] is after the reach is after the pole and
[1:41:39] the Bible says it will cause every man
[1:41:42] upon the Earth To Worship the Beast what
[1:41:44] are you like it or
[1:41:49] not I we we
[1:41:53] together praise the Lord
[1:42:01] am so you have uh uh uh uh you have the
[1:42:05] the the the Russian Orthodox Church they
[1:42:08] do their you know they have their own uh
[1:42:11] worship you know whether they don't take
[1:42:14] they don't take uh uh uh direct order
[1:42:16] from the pope because if if you even if
[1:42:18] you even study uh the colanda you will
[1:42:21] realize that uh uh uh the Vatican gives
[1:42:27] us our yearly calendar when it comes to
[1:42:30] Christian event they are the one that
[1:42:33] decide when is
[1:42:35] Easter because it has to go by their
[1:42:38] length Season but if you go to the
[1:42:41] Russian calendar where a lot of the the
[1:42:44] the the Nations onor communist use their
[1:42:48] Easter comes right after our
[1:42:52] Easter praise the Lord I have a brother
[1:42:55] there in Romania and uh uh uh a couple
[1:42:59] of years ago he invited me to do an
[1:43:01] Easter meeting I told you I said well no

[1:43:12] by the Orthodox
[1:43:15] calendar are we together
[1:43:19] amen too much information but we we will
[1:43:22] get to where we want to go this morning
[1:43:24] by God's help so that's the reason Uh
[1:43:27] Russian drove them out because uh uh
[1:43:30] they had had all the money and had all
[1:43:32] the prayers for the Saints and and and
[1:43:35] they build big big uh biger building and
[1:43:37] all the wealth of the people and bundle
[1:43:40] it up like that and they seen that they
[1:43:42] live no different and was no different
[1:43:45] from any of the rest of the world praise
[1:43:47] the
[1:43:48] Lord and they spilled it out and formed
[1:43:53] communism praise the Lord that was how
[1:43:56] they kicked the church
[1:43:58] out and it came out with
[1:44:04] Communism
[1:44:11] now okay let's let's go back to

[1:48:30] Year Praise the Lord are we together
[1:48:34] amen then when you go to verse
[1:48:39] 11 I'm running out of time here and I
[1:48:42] beheld another Beast coming out of the
[1:48:46] earth and he had two HS like a lamb and
[1:48:51] he speak as the
[1:48:54] dragon the first Beast came out of the
[1:48:57] sea praise the Lord John is now seeing
[1:49:01] another Beast that is coming out of the
[1:49:07] earth praise the Lord now you will see
[1:49:11] here that uh uh uh let's let's let's
[1:49:14] just read this quickly and the inured of
[1:49:17] the Lord and the word of the little lamb
[1:49:22] that rose up in Revelation
[1:49:25] 13 it has uh it has two little homs
[1:49:29] probably little horns Savor and
[1:49:31] ecclesiastic power but after the lamb
[1:49:35] freedom of religion and so forth but
[1:49:38] after the wi it speak like the Beast
[1:49:40] like the dragon and exercise all the
[1:49:43] power the dragon did before him a bitter
[1:49:47] religious persecution we are nearing
[1:49:49] that time now so as we will look at that
[1:49:52] quickly the Beast that came out of the
[1:49:54] seed we we identify that with the Roman
[1:49:58] system we identify that with the seven
[1:50:01] head you know uh uh the the the seven
[1:50:05] the 10 horns and the crowns and all of
[1:50:07] that we identify that with the Roman
[1:50:09] system here we have another Beast that
[1:50:12] is rising out of the sea the Bible says
[1:50:14] that when this beig uh came out of the
[1:50:17] seed he had two horns like a lamb like a
[1:50:21] lamb it was not a lamb but it was like a
[1:50:24] lamb now brother brandham who says he
[1:50:27] says that is that is the American
[1:50:30] buffalo it's not a
[1:50:33] lamb he says that's where United States
[1:50:36] is represented in the scripture and I
[1:50:39] will tell you that there is no Nation
[1:50:42] Under Heaven that have pushed the gospel
[1:50:45] like the United States every
[1:50:48] denomination that that is found all
[1:50:51] around the world has found their
[1:50:54] headquarters somewhere here in the
[1:50:56] USA amen now so but it goes back it goes
[1:51:00] more than that it goes back to the
[1:51:02] history of the nation why he says here
[1:51:06] in the AM of the Beast he says two horn
[1:51:09] like a lamb not a lamb what is it is our
[1:51:13] American buffalo show he said two horns
[1:51:16] like a lamb but then what did he do he
[1:51:20] had the freedom of religion first he
[1:51:23] acted like a lamb that was what our the
[1:51:26] fing fathers brought they ran from
[1:51:30] Catholic
[1:51:32] persecution and they came to a
[1:51:36] land to give birth to a new nation a
[1:51:39] beast rising out of a land brother B
[1:51:43] says it was it was a land that needed to
[1:51:45] be
[1:51:47] inhabited are we together and what the
[1:51:50] Bro the freedom of religion like a lamb
[1:51:54] the lamb speaks of
[1:51:57] Christ are we together amen but this
[1:52:01] Beast that rise up out of this
[1:52:05] land is pretty soon going to start
[1:52:08] speaking like the dragon
[1:52:14] amen praise the
[1:52:16] Lord amen so you see it it's it's all
[1:52:20] because of the influence no matter what
[1:52:23] the nation is no matter what you know
[1:52:26] about the nation history all the nation
[1:52:30] leaders all is Army power there is a
[1:52:34] spiritual influence behind the
[1:52:38] nation that's what proves that your
[1:52:41] spirit is stronger than your body your
[1:52:43] your body is just a
[1:52:47] vehicle it's the spirit that drives it
[1:52:52] praise the
[1:52:54] Lord the nation in all his politics and
[1:52:58] all his governor and all of his judges
[1:53:01] is just a vehicle there is a spirit
[1:53:03] behind it that drives
[1:53:08] it praise the Lord amen amen the falling
[1:53:12] father came and then the late biblical
[1:53:15] principle you will find that even the
[1:53:18] forms of government
[1:53:20] that was established in America is from
[1:53:23] Isaiah go go go to the book of
[1:53:29] Isaiah you find all of his
[1:53:32] law they came with h that that place of
[1:53:37] founding the land to run away then break
[1:53:39] away from the suppression of the Roman
[1:53:42] Church that was ruling in in in
[1:53:47] Europe a beast rising out of the the
[1:53:50] Earth it came up so innocently like a
[1:53:56] lamb praise the
[1:54:00] Lord but not too long it start
[1:54:03] speaking like a
[1:54:08] dragon praise the Lord are we together
[1:54:12] I'll read something to you
[1:54:15] so I can find a place to close here
[1:54:19] let's go verse 12 and he exercised all
[1:54:21] the power of the first Beast before it
[1:54:25] it came up as a lamb but pretty soon it
[1:54:28] started exercising all the power of the
[1:54:30] first Beast that came out of the sea it
[1:54:34] started exercising the Roman
[1:54:43] power and now pretty soon all of our
[1:54:46] judges in the Supreme Court are
[1:54:48] Catholics
[1:54:50] our present president is a
[1:54:54] Catholic there's a huge Catholic
[1:54:59] influence that is behind the nation amen
[1:55:04] praise the
[1:55:05] Lord
[1:55:09] amen when they started taking Bibles
[1:55:11] from the school that was that was
[1:55:14] catholism approach take the Bible away
[1:55:16] and give the people what the church says
[1:55:24] praise the
[1:55:27] Lord are we
[1:55:34] together it's start exercising the power
[1:55:36] of the first Beast verse
[1:55:39] 13 and he does great wonders so that he
[1:55:43] make fire come down from heaven I I love
[1:55:46] this one I love this one because you
[1:55:49] will never not easily be able to pick
[1:55:51] that up until a prophet reveal that to
[1:55:55] you see what he says I love
[1:55:59] it Mark of the Beast here uh where we
[1:56:03] were reading from earlier he says Alam
[1:56:06] that's the American buffalo show he says
[1:56:08] two hn like a lamb and then what did he
[1:56:11] do he had a freedom of religion first he
[1:56:13] acted like a lamb it spoke like a lamb
[1:56:16] but remember he never did become an old
[1:56:19] L he was a lamb which mean it never grow
[1:56:22] up it stay in that infant state of
[1:56:24] religious freedom and then it was
[1:56:26] overtaken by the
[1:56:29] Beast now he goes ahead he says this
[1:56:32] country is only 150 years old he says
[1:56:35] and then he speaks like the dragon he
[1:56:37] exercis all the power uh uh uh the first
[1:56:41] Beast had before him the red dragon and
[1:56:45] causes all that on the earth that dwells
[1:56:47] upon uh upon on the the Earth To Worship
[1:56:51] the Beast whose daily wound was
[1:56:56] healed and and he does great Wonder so
[1:57:00] he make he make him a fire come down out
[1:57:04] of Heaven the atomic bomb and hydrogen
[1:57:08] bomb smart intelligent nation and so
[1:57:11] forth deceiving the Nations by these
[1:57:18] things now when you read that you think
[1:57:21] that it's like Elijah calling fire down
[1:57:24] from
[1:57:25] heaven brother brandham says no is the
[1:57:28] US making hydrogen
[1:57:31] bombs that's what he use on on
[1:57:36] Japan intelligent
[1:57:41] Nation are we
[1:57:47] together and he go ahead he says is here
[1:57:49] he says uh this United State will come
[1:57:52] to a time that church and state will
[1:57:54] unite together the Protestant and the
[1:57:57] Catholic with draw their things together
[1:57:59] to fight communist and it is exactly
[1:58:02] plain in the hand of what God Said right
[1:58:07] here praise the
[1:58:11] Lord so you see we we are we are walking
[1:58:15] on the pages of
[1:58:18] scripture everything that is happening
[1:58:20] around
[1:58:24] us everything that is happening around
[1:58:27] us like I always say prophecy is
[1:58:30] stronger than politics
[1:58:34] amen
[1:58:40] amen now with a few minutes that is left
[1:58:43] before us I have to find a place to
[1:58:46] close this I was thinking that U maybe
[1:58:51] uh uh as we start the the New Year if if
[1:58:54] Jesus started we might do a kind of a
[1:58:56] revelation series I would like to go
[1:58:59] from one chapter to another and uh uh I
[1:59:02] think if the Lord will allow us to do

[1:59:39] book is the Book of Revelation
[1:59:41] Revelation chapter 5 the book that was
[1:59:43] one seal with Seven Seals that no man
[1:59:46] was
[1:59:48] watering
