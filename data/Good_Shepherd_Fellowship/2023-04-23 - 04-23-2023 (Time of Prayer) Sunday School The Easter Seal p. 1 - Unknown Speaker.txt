foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] part of this Fellowship I want to greet brother Carl Williams and his wife brother Pastrami and the rest here at the platform brother Shores brother Outlaw the ministers and all you fine people you know I I had a birthday last week too and uh I'm just a teeny bit older than a chapter I believe you said five and years old for the chapter and somebody said to the day said how old are you brother Branham I said 26. and then I said I wiped out the first 25 years I didn't serve him so well in them I said I hope he does too to get him to do it'll be different but uh it's good to be here and now we want to not take much of your time because we I'm always afraid after I hear some of these fine testimonies and things that's going on that I in songs that I will do something that'll upset that and I wanted to add to it if there'd be anything I could add to it these sisters that brother that sang the song this morning the colored brother I appreciated that the eye on the sparrow and these sisters that sang this song that's been one of my helps since I was here the first time I had that I got it on a record and have just played it out I'd like to talk it over with him and I asked brother Dawson Riley there my friend if he would some of them if they'd see if they'd get those ladies if they were still here on Earth that sang it again this morning and I hope Terry got it and I suppose he did I'll take that off there maybe to a record or something because I really like that song and that's my my desire is to talk it over with him I think we all want to do that that's why we're here this morning now the oncoming meetings next week is it all right to me uh to be at home this coming week it's a tabernacle uh next Sunday for Easter Service Saturday night Sunday and Sunday night and then uh go back to California all you people around California be sure glad to have you at the meeting over there and I think Billy has sent out the wrong advertisement he said the Biltmore Hotel I believe this could be it it's a couldn't get it and it's at the Eastmont Embassy the Embassy Hotel so any of the Full Gospel people over there would let you know if you're over that way and then we come back from there and uh go to South Africa and um just one month from today we sail for South Africa expecting a great time in the Lord about three nations down there so William we certainly solicit your prayers are probably won't be able to see anymore if the Lord carries on of course the gold until I get back and I hope I have a great report for you when we come back last time down there I think that the lord gave me the greatest meeting I ever had and one time for an altar call now this is out of blanket natives as far as I know there was 30 000 accepted Christ at one time and we thought maybe the mid physical healing because there had been about 25 000 healed at one time and the next day the mayor of of Durban which is Sydney Smith said go to your window look coming down the street and they were Van lodatcher van Lord just powerful of old crutches and things just piled up that they were coming behind the natives which was a war at one another coming down the streets of the city singing only believe in their native tongue I'll tell you my heart thrill I when you see something like that brother shows you feel your work's not in vain man you see you're trying and I hope that God repeats it again not because of because we're going down there but because we're looking for the coming of the Lord and this is the song said we're seeking out that little lost sheep that's that he he won't come until that sheep's in everyone has to be in the fall you won't close the door the last ones in so Minister Brothers I'm sure with you this morning of trying to hunt out that last sheep it might be in Phoenix this morning I don't know but when the last one comes in then the shepherd will close the door brother could I just say a word I forgotten something uh we've been talking about forget I don't oh I'm the one who has to write out what I'm going to say on what was I'm since uh getting older I find it harder to remember putting the scriptures down and so forth it used to be I could line up about 50 scriptures in my mind and never even passed right on through it but I got a lot of rough miles behind them days so we're looking for the coming of the Lord Lord bless you all and there you get up here you think you sit down here and hear these people testifying you think well when I get up I'm going to say something about that and there's so much to say you'd be all they saying it but I certainly appreciate you all may this little chapter just keep growing May every Church in Phoenix continually to grow until Jesus comes yeah sincere prayer now I think just to rest this just a little bit let's stand while we had Prayer Will you almighty God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who raise him up from the dead and has given to us as the sacrifice and O Lord and savior we are so grateful to thee for this privilege that we had this morning to stand in thy presence with thy people that's been redeemed and looking for his glorious second coming to receive us unto himself if there be sin Among Us Lord purges with thy House of and we pray heavenly father that you will heal every sick person that's in our midst and if there would be by chance those who doesn't know you in this great baptism of the holy spirit that we're so earnestly contending for and saying it is a must according to the scripture for this last day we pray God is he'll fall upon us all today and baptize us the freshly into the body and bring those that are out in to father bless us as we read Thy word and Endeavor to speak that which is truth of Thy Word close our mouth to that which is untruth and open our hearts and mouths to that which is truth as we commit ourselves to thee use our mouths to speak in our ears to hear in our hearts to receive for we ask that in Jesus name who has ordained it to be so amen I would like to read from the holy word three places in the Bible and if you would Mark these and you want to carry them on through to read them for a further information uh be very happy if you would mark them down the places I'm going to read is Matthew 28 1 10. and then Revelations 1 17 18 Romans 8 11. I may I repeat them again and now Matthew 28 1 to 10. Revelations 1 17 to 18 and Romans 8 11. now we are approaching Easter and as you're getting your places and marking it down I think that this coming week is the most and the greatest historical week of all of the weeks of the year I think of the greatest thing we will celebrate this week this coming week was the greatest event that ever taken place on the Earth I don't think anything could surpass it you say well the the crucifixion was great but many man has died many man has been crucified even in the same Days of Our Lord but there was only one of them who rose up from the dead that sealed now I want to read and this is kind of a little pre-easter message the Lord willing about 40 minutes and now let's read from Saint Matthew's gospel the 28th chapter beginning in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn towards the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalena and the other married to see the Sepulcher and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and set up on it his countenances was like lightning and his reament wide as snow and for fear of him the Quakers did Keepers pardon me it did shape and became his dead man and the angel answered and said unto the women fear ye not for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for He Is Risen as he said come and see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him lo I have told you and they departed quickly from the Sepulcher with fear and great joy and did run and bring the disciples word and as they went to tell his disciples behold Jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worship him then said Jesus unto them Be not Afraid go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee and there shall they see me and in Revelations the first chapter and the 17th and 18th verse and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of death and Hell and in the Book of Romans they eighth chapter and beginning with the 11th verse but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now I trust that the Lord Jesus will add His blessings to the readings of these words seeing that Easter and I have stamped it in my own heart as the greatest meeting or the greatest event of the the year I want to ask you to pardon me a moment isn't that kind of blaring out there to you kind of a roaring is it all right can you hear it all right like that you can't hear it is that better right like that I was didn't want to get too close now why I say this is because that Easter he proved what the Bible had said all the scripture that was written of him to do he sealed his messiahship when he arose from the dead the Easter seal we have so much of it today we talk about that buying Easter Seals well I want to speak this morning on the Easter seal it's a different seal than what we buy with our money as a seal to go on letters for I think the tuberculosis um Association of whatever they call it I I think this seal is a little different seal and being that Easter is the great day of the year for we Christians who claim to be God's children I want to try to break into it and see how we should be fellowshipped with this great a thing that Christ did for us the word of God was spoken many many hundreds of years before his coming of his crucifixion and all of his death and obvious suffering and also of his resurrection we'll be going through these Services perhaps next week as we listen to our our radio programs and in our churches with our pastors and so forth this coming week but of all the days and all of the things that Jesus did and certainly appreciating all of his Vindication of God's word and what he did to fulfill it of Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils preaching the gospel to the poor and fulfilling every word that God said that he would do when he came and then also suffering for our sins and our stead to be the propitiation for sin at the cross where no one else could have done it but him but above all of that I think Easter seal the whole thing because there have been prophets on the earth who had prophesied before him there had been prophets on the earth who would heal the sick even raise the dead and done the same signs that Jesus did but Easter proved it it sealed the word of God forever for the True Believer all Gloom and doubt was shattered at that blessful morning man had been shut up as it was in a prison house even to religious people before this day because they had been seen great religious moves and moving of the Holy Spirit and so forth but when a man died it seemed to settle it but when this one came and said I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up again and then go prove what he said to me that that's the Seal of it when uh when something is said and then uh is turn around and proven the man said like Columbus believed the world was round and he watched the ships as we're told how they come in and he could see the mass way before he could see the ship and proved him that the world was round people didn't believe that in that date but he was a man of vision you set out to prove exactly what he had a vision of that was the truth and God purpose to prove his word the truth so he there was only one man that could do that and that was Jesus and he commented proved that to be the truth it sealed and that broke all the seals of gloom and scattered all the the superstitions of other religions and so forth where great man is raised up and said great marvelous things but they're everyone in the grave but our Christian religion is the only one who has the empty tomb and that proves to me that he is the god of the dead and God of the living that he can raise up the Dead uh back to life again and uh this quickening power quicken in spirit of his has proved through the years that he is the one who can Quicken the dead back to life again and when he proved by his promise this great conquering power that he had on Easter he proved that he could conquer death hell and the great I am he that was dead and is alive again and Alive forevermore and had the keys that to death hell in the grave what a a statement for anyone to make and not only did he make it but he had already proved that he he had what he claimed to have and I think God hastened the day that when we as Christians you and when he proved by his promise this great conquering power that he had on Easter he proved that he could conquer death hell and the great I am he that was dead and is alive again and Alive forevermore and had the keys that to death hell in the grave what a a statement for anyone to make and not only did he make it but he had already proved that he he had what he claimed to have and I think God hastened the day that when we as Christians you believe this Bible can prove what we are talking about see that's what makes is to said a while ago the salt of the earth the sister said that's right the world is looking for this soul and when we can prove by our lives and by the Bible uh that our lives are vindicating that word to be living today that that's the day we're looking for the word this Spirit Romans 8 there that 11 said if this spirit that raised up Jesus Christ be in you will also Quicken your mortal bodies not only did he proved to him to us that he was a Jehovah Redeemer and had power over death hell and the grave but he has also give us the access to the Same Spirit that we ourselves can have the assurance that we too are quickened by that spirit for the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your body it will also Quicken your mortal bodies now the word quickest means to be made alive after death after it's dead then it's to be quickened the world has been shut up in doubt for many ages until then this was proven not only talked about but was proven I think that anything it's worthwhile if Jesus said oh ye therefore teach All Nations and prove to them by demonstrating the power of God to them these signs shall follow them that believe them who promise and say they believe he give us a definite understanding of it that these signs would follow them that believe it would be the proof of their testimony now we can say we believe but until we are have the proven sign that he said that would be upon us then we are just confessing to be Believers and not the possession of believers for remember a few days ago I was listening to a radio a program on kair down in Tucson and this Minister had taken the side of [Music] foreign [Music]
