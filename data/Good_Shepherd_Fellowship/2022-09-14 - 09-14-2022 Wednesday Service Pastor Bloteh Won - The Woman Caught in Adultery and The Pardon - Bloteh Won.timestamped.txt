[35:03] Sunday but Graham yeah you know welcome
[35:05] Christ
[35:08] kind of doing some working and now
[35:11] listening to this message and
[35:13] he says here he says now look
[35:16] let's get another senior look coming
[35:19] down the street Yonder
[35:22] a little old woman oh
[35:26] what a name
[35:28] she had in the city
[35:32] she was a sinner
[35:34] we won't go into detail
[35:37] about it she was a prostitute
[35:41] she was a woman of ill Fame
[35:45] the one that did wrong
[35:48] but remember brother
[35:50] She's Somebody's Daughter
[35:53] that's right
[35:56] how do you know what cause that life
[36:02] maybe some sweetheart introduced her
[36:06] to social life
[36:08] put her in his arm and promise her
[36:11] everything
[36:12] and then and then when he turned
[36:16] her character
[36:18] he run away
[36:20] and left her
[36:22] to sold another one
[36:25] and that introduced her to that kind of
[36:28] for life
[36:30] you know
[36:32] no he didn't say you know he said who
[36:35] knows the story behind her that was the
[36:38] thought that caught my mind who knows
[36:41] the story
[36:42] behind her to every situation there is a
[36:45] story
[36:48] amen
[36:49] to every situation
[36:51] there is a story that's why we should
[36:53] never run into conclusion
[36:55] because we don't know the details
[36:59] praise the Lord
[37:01] he said we'll know the story behind her
[37:03] but now she's mad she has a mark on her
[37:06] no one had anything to do with her she's
[37:10] rumbling the street
[37:11] making the money the best she can that's
[37:15] why our house together tonight
[37:17] and
[37:19] let's play that song this is my story
[37:21] this is my song
[37:25] we have a prayer request here from uh
[37:28] sister Fatu she acts that we pray for
[37:32] her
[37:33] uh
[37:35] her niece daughter who was born
[37:38] premature
[37:39] they were twins one pass
[37:43] and asking prayer for the other one that
[37:46] the Lord will see her true amen
[37:50] and also we want to just uh
[37:53] give thanks tonight
[37:56] that the Lord has given us another
[37:58] privilege to be in the house of the Lord
[38:01] let's also thank the Lord for our
[38:04] brothers and sisters let's thank the
[38:07] Lord for those that couldn't make the
[38:09] service tonight the ones that have to
[38:12] work the ones that couldn't travel
[38:14] and if there's any only a way coming
[38:17] let's pray for them that the grace of
[38:19] God will will be with them and you know
[38:22] a couple of weeks ago I said that I
[38:25] believe that we are at the junction as a
[38:28] church
[38:30] and and I still believe that I believe
[38:33] that uh
[38:35] just like I said before Brad Brahm said
[38:37] at every Junction there are two things
[38:39] that we have to watch for we have to
[38:42] watch and realize that the enemy will
[38:44] come as a flaw
[38:46] that is obvious for Destruction for
[38:50] confusion
[38:51] but the Lord is all will also be there
[38:54] to raise uh
[38:56] a standard
[38:58] and if we can see the standard the
[39:00] standard will be the identification of
[39:03] the word
[39:04] standard will not be signs and miracles
[39:07] the standard we have to be the word
[39:10] the word will always identify itself as
[39:13] the standard and if we can see that then
[39:17] the prophet also said Junction of time
[39:19] he says then we then we will experience
[39:22] the miraculous because the only
[39:24] potential is identified the miraculous
[39:28] will follow
[39:29] and so let's let's just thank the Lord
[39:32] and as we want to bring our hearts
[39:35] before the Lord tonight whatever you
[39:37] want to say or you want to remain
[39:38] standing you want to kneel whatever
[39:40] position we just want to take these few

[48:00] take our Bibles
[48:03] praise the Lord thank you musicians
[48:08] praise the Lord Saint John chapter 8.
[48:13] see John chapter 8.
[48:21] you know sometimes you
[48:24] you uh
[48:27] thinking about a subject on your mind
[48:30] and you're praying and you have your own
[48:32] thoughts you know when you when you
[48:35] think about
[48:37] um unclean Spirit you think about
[48:39] demonology then you think about you know
[48:42] talking about uh uh
[48:51] uh you know evil spirit and all of that
[48:54] but to just see how the Lord kind of for
[48:57] changed what I had on my mind as I was
[48:59] studying on the weekend and then uh it
[49:03] starts to open to different things let's
[49:06] just read uh John chapter 8.
[49:09] uh I read it from verse one Jesus went
[49:11] on to the Mount of olive
[49:14] and early in the morning
[49:16] he came again into the temple and all
[49:19] the people came unto him and he sat down
[49:23] and taught them
[49:25] and the stripes
[49:28] and Pharisees brought onto him a woman
[49:31] taken in adultery
[49:34] and when they had set her in the mess
[49:39] they said unto him Master this woman is
[49:41] taking in adultery in the very art now
[49:46] Moses in the Lord commanded us that such
[49:49] should be stoned
[49:51] but what served down
[49:55] this they say attempting him
[49:58] tempting him that they might have
[50:02] to accuse him
[50:05] but Jesus took down
[50:08] and with his finger wrote on the ground
[50:12] as though he heard him net
[50:15] so when they continued asking him he
[50:18] lifted up himself and said unto them he
[50:22] that is without sin among you let him
[50:27] First cast his stone at her
[50:30] and again he stooped down and wrote on
[50:34] the ground
[50:36] praise the Lord
[50:39] and they wish heard it became convicted
[50:43] by their own conscience went out one by
[50:47] one beginning at the others even on to
[50:51] the least and Jesus was left alone
[50:55] and the woman standing in the mess in
[50:58] Jesus when Jesus had lifted up himself
[51:01] and saw none but the woman
[51:04] he said unto her woman
[51:07] where are those down accusers
[51:11] have no man condemned thee she said no
[51:16] man Lord
[51:17] and Jesus said unto her neither
[51:20] do I condemn thee
[51:22] go
[51:23] and say no more
[51:26] may the Lord bless his word
[51:28] you may have your seeds
[51:33] so going away from the service
[51:36] [Music]
[51:37] uh Sunday
[51:40] and now
[51:42] kind of for meditating you know
[51:44] sometimes you you get out of the service
[51:46] and then you start to really meditate
[51:50] because and and try to think or you know
[51:52] uh
[51:55] see how the law kind of led the service
[51:59] I was thinking about it
[52:01] and it it kind it struck my mind and and
[52:04] uh
[52:07] um
[52:09] talking about mayor Magdalene in the
[52:12] first resurrection to now I want to talk
[52:14] about this woman I hear the woman caught
[52:17] in adultery in the pardon
[52:19] I want to talk about the pattern
[52:26] and what uh what caught my mind in
[52:28] looking at this is the other
[52:32] March you recall the three women
[52:35] in in the genealogy of Jesus Christ
[52:38] which were Gentile we mean in tema
[52:44] Ruth and Rahab
[52:47] which of course is is uh is is strange
[52:51] they are their name will appear in a
[52:54] genealogy of Jesus Christ
[52:56] but then also we realized that there
[52:59] were there were
[53:02] a few women also that were that
[53:04] ministered unto Jesus like the scripture
[53:06] said but they were there were women also
[53:09] in uh
[53:11] in the
[53:14] in the scripture
[53:16] this woman caught in adultery the one
[53:20] that was Jesus
[53:25] feet with her head
[53:27] and then also uh the woman that they
[53:31] were
[53:32] and uh
[53:37] they were very
[53:40] notable women you know there in the
[53:44] scripture
[53:46] so looking at this stuff am I for some
[53:48] reason my eyes
[53:51] starts to look at these three women so
[53:55] maybe if the law will bless us we might
[53:57] we might kind of talk talk about uh talk
[54:00] about them maybe the woman that will on
[54:03] Sunday if we we are led to go in that
[54:06] direction if the Lord don't have us do
[54:09] something yes but I was just thinking
[54:11] about this and uh
[54:14] and in the way that brother Brennan will
[54:18] read some things tonight
[54:19] uh
[54:21] he he he used their story you know
[54:25] reindeer life story together uh uh and
[54:29] it kind of forgive us a picture but you
[54:32] know just like I said I was I was
[54:34] listening to that tape and uh uh doing
[54:38] some work mowing the lawn and all of
[54:40] that and then I got I got caught by by
[54:44] the scene because Birdman yeah was
[54:45] dramatizing you know a scene there and
[54:49] he says who knows the story behind her
[54:54] and then I started to think think about
[54:57] uh some few things that he also said you
[55:02] know uh
[55:03] uh talking about uh rehab the Halep you
[55:07] know uh he you know you know talking
[55:10] about Rahab he says uh she was forced to
[55:13] go in their way of life you know uh not
[55:17] because she she wanted to be a harlot I
[55:22] wanted to be a you know a woman of that
[55:25] kind of a life but uh uh life situation
[55:28] kind of a false or into that now so like
[55:33] I said there is story behind every
[55:36] action amen
[55:38] and and if you don't know the story your
[55:42] judgment will be very poor
[55:45] praise the Lord your judgment will be
[55:48] very very poor so we want to look at
[55:50] this woman tonight in uh in a different
[55:53] way and uh uh and you know
[55:58] I trust that the Lord will be able to to
[56:01] uh to help us with the few meanings that
[56:04] is before us to be able to look at uh
[56:07] some few things
[56:10] now so uh uh he's he's stalking yet I
[56:14] will kind of go over some uh
[56:20] a few of the the different you know
[56:23] different quotes that I was looking at
[56:36] now when we looked actually in the
[56:39] scripture here we will see that uh see
[56:42] John actually is in John chapter 8 is uh
[56:45] we know that it's a very very very
[56:47] interesting
[56:50] uh chapter in the in in the Bible did in
[56:55] Saint John chapter 8
[56:59] it is it is all it is also it is almost
[57:02] like Matthew chapter 12 uh in the Book
[57:05] of Matthew it is also very very
[57:08] important
[57:09] scripture I was going to talk a little
[57:11] bit of that on Sunday but I got I got uh
[57:14] uh uh you know I got moved into water
[57:18] what we was talking about because
[57:21] Matthew chapter 12 is is Johnson you
[57:24] have to remember this in Matthew chapter
[57:26] 12 that the Pharisees called uh uh Jesus
[57:32] ebessi board
[57:34] praise the Lord
[57:35] and it's actually there in Matthew
[57:37] chapter 12 Jesus was was dealing with
[57:40] you know telling them if I know clean
[57:42] Spirit go out of a man it comes back you
[57:45] know seven times
[57:47] now what made that scripture uh uh very
[57:51] important like every other scripture but
[57:54] that chapter you know it shows the kind
[57:56] of a junction because the scripture will
[57:58] tell us from that time Jesus actually
[58:02] never
[58:04] taught publicly
[58:08] from that time he never taught publicly
[58:12] and it it teaches us a whole lot
[58:16] that's where he also said you can say
[58:19] anything about the son of man but when
[58:22] the whole you speak one word against the
[58:23] Holy Ghost it would not be forgiving you
[58:25] it was in that very same chapter because
[58:28] what was happening is that they were
[58:31] attributing
[58:33] the manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[58:37] to a work of the devil
[58:42] praise the Lord
[58:43] amen that this man Caster evil spirit by
[58:47] vegetable that's what he said
[58:50] and and and and Jesus said if it sit on
[58:54] cancer seven you know uh Kingdom against
[58:56] himself will not stand and he was also
[58:59] trying to tell them that you know the
[59:01] you know the the devil cannot you know
[59:03] cannot cast out evil spirit he can bring
[59:06] evil spirit upon people but he can't
[59:08] cast it out he don't have the power to
[59:10] cast that evil spirit
[59:12] and uh
[59:14] you know but it is it is very important
[59:18] because uh uh in the in a in a little
[59:22] measure we will see you know uh just
[59:26] this gun time being in Chicago there and
[59:28] uh with brother Robert Wilson and you
[59:31] know uh he's letting us know he's been
[59:33] there for many years many years
[59:35] and um and uh to see the kind of for
[59:40] history that Chicago holds not only to
[59:43] the U.S but even to Christianity there
[59:46] were great men that came to Chicago to
[59:49] your mother one of them and great
[59:51] Revival you know that uh that uh
[59:56] that that broke out to Chicago but you
[1:00:00] you know as as we were talking you know
[1:00:03] we're talking about different things and
[1:00:05] uh uh and I and I told the brothers I
[1:00:08] said well you know we have to also
[1:00:10] remember this was the very same Chicago
[1:00:12] where Kyle Williams and uh Kenny Hagin
[1:00:15] and all of those men decided to
[1:00:17] challenge brother Brennan improve that
[1:00:20] uh you know his Doctrine was false and
[1:00:23] and and all of that and brought around
[1:00:25] and told Carl Williams you know and says
[1:00:28] uh says you guys this is what you are
[1:00:31] planning to do and even the room that
[1:00:33] you're renting your we will not use that
[1:00:35] room we're going to use this room is
[1:00:37] going to be painted this way and this
[1:00:39] man gonna sit here and this guy going to
[1:00:41] sit here and this other person going to
[1:00:44] sit here and uh uh you know and and all
[1:00:47] of that even that never been to uh
[1:00:51] kind of heading to preach for him and uh
[1:00:55] you know and and all of that but you
[1:00:58] will you will realize that uh uh uh
[1:01:04] it was not too long when Berta Brandon
[1:01:06] told Chicago that she she they have
[1:01:09] missed their day of visitation
[1:01:11] you know and Joseph bozell was telling
[1:01:15] brother Brennan if you listen to some of
[1:01:16] the Last Ship there he's selling bird
[1:01:18] brand that's a great thing Brett Brown
[1:01:19] that you know Chicago is going to have
[1:01:21] that great thing Birmingham told Joseph
[1:01:24] Chicago has already have her visitation
[1:01:27] the great things have already passed
[1:01:30] you know so all of that and it is not
[1:01:34] like you know uh because the beauty the
[1:01:38] beauty of the message of the owl
[1:01:41] is the Fulfillment of scripture
[1:01:44] that's the beauty of the message of the
[1:01:47] owl the beauty of the message of the
[1:01:50] hour is not the man that are playing the
[1:01:52] same
[1:01:54] is not the prophet is not the fight for
[1:01:56] Ministry
[1:01:57] the beauty is the Fulfillment of
[1:02:00] scripture for us to have the privilege
[1:02:04] to be able to see scripture being
[1:02:06] fulfilled in our day
[1:02:09] we can we can we can point to it we can
[1:02:12] say Malachi 4 unless a person can come
[1:02:15] and tell us who fulfill Malacca 4 and 5
[1:02:19] but that's as much as we believe that
[1:02:21] was a scripture that was fulfilled in
[1:02:23] vertebrand Ministry
[1:02:26] praise the Lord that is the beauty of
[1:02:29] the message so you can you can see
[1:02:31] things we can read about uh Matthew
[1:02:34] chapter 12 you know and those men
[1:02:36] calling the work of God uh a devil
[1:02:40] and and right in there we see the
[1:02:44] DraStic change in Jesus ministry
[1:02:48] praise the Lord
[1:02:50] Matthew Chapter 13 he will go and start
[1:02:53] talking in Parables and his disciples
[1:02:56] says Master why are you talking in Paris
[1:02:57] is because it's unto you the secret is
[1:03:00] to be known the the ministry out there
[1:03:02] is done
[1:03:06] praise the Lord and we see the same
[1:03:08] thing you know uh uh repeating Luke
[1:03:11] chapter 4 Jesus came down from the
[1:03:13] mountain went straight into the
[1:03:15] synagogues as the you know the the
[1:03:17] priests giving the the straws you read
[1:03:19] from there this day this scripture is
[1:03:21] fulfilled
[1:03:23] unconsciously fall into the same scene
[1:03:26] the Holy Ghost set everything out he
[1:03:28] couldn't find the the page that he
[1:03:30] wanted to read a Catholic priest gave
[1:03:32] him a Bible he read out of it preached
[1:03:35] the message he wanted to preach going
[1:03:36] out of the service the Holy Ghost remind
[1:03:38] him do you remember there's a scene like
[1:03:40] this in the Bible
[1:03:45] what is that scripture being fulfilled
[1:03:48] before us
[1:03:50] the Fulfillment of scripture is the
[1:03:53] beauty of the message of the owl
[1:03:56] now so uh uh out of that but also yet in
[1:04:01] in Saint John chapter 8 the beauty year
[1:04:04] also is there the here is a woman caught
[1:04:07] in adultery
[1:04:09] and uh uh and uh the woman
[1:04:13] was brought to the Lord Jesus like we
[1:04:17] read European the brother Brandon he
[1:04:18] said she was a drag
[1:04:20] you know she was dragged one he says
[1:04:23] here the the meanest man in town
[1:04:26] and she looked back in a corner and
[1:04:29] there
[1:04:30] he sat now he's talking about the the
[1:04:33] woman that that washed Jesus feet with
[1:04:37] her tears but listen to the story here
[1:04:39] now he said and she said oh to think
[1:04:42] that he's invited
[1:04:45] and he's now grown neither is his feet
[1:04:50] watch I remember that they tell me that
[1:04:55] a woman was dragged into the street
[1:04:58] or drag into the street for for for
[1:05:02] prostitution to be Stone like I will be
[1:05:09] now so he's making a saying that the
[1:05:12] woman uh that was Jesus feet here and
[1:05:15] now she's uh uh seeing Jesus and and
[1:05:19] she's remembering that she was tall of
[1:05:23] the same in Saint John chapter 8 and uh
[1:05:27] uh and she also placing herself in the
[1:05:30] same uh situation
[1:05:35] drag into the street to be stoned like I
[1:05:39] will be and he forgive her
[1:05:42] every scene if I could own it do
[1:05:45] something for him maybe he did forgive
[1:05:48] me my sin
[1:05:51] but what can I do
[1:05:54] I can't even get in the game
[1:05:58] if I could only get to him
[1:06:01] I didn't like to ask him to forgive me
[1:06:04] so she thought
[1:06:07] he is not anointed neither
[1:06:10] is he watch all he uh he's not made
[1:06:15] welcome
[1:06:16] and if I could only get his attention
[1:06:20] I did make him welcome
[1:06:23] if he did only talk to me I will make
[1:06:28] him welcome praise the Lord
[1:06:31] amen so we see here that uh uh so uh
[1:06:38] John is is bringing this scene out but
[1:06:41] you will realize that when John talks
[1:06:43] about this woman and then he talks about
[1:06:46] Jesus saying neither do I condemn thee
[1:06:49] go and sin no more
[1:06:51] and uh uh he says and Jesus said again I
[1:06:56] am the light of the word he that
[1:06:58] followeth me walk and not in darkness
[1:07:00] right away you realize that the the
[1:07:03] Jesus and the Pharisees conversation
[1:07:07] switch from the woman
[1:07:10] praise the Lord now the brother woman
[1:07:13] before Jesus to tempt him
[1:07:16] to find a way to trap him
[1:07:19] praise the Lord
[1:07:20] but then pray this song
[1:07:23] their conversations switched away from
[1:07:26] the woman and noun is going to be more
[1:07:29] in a place where Jesus is talking about
[1:07:32] the light of the word and he is going to
[1:07:34] go into talking about Abraham as our
[1:07:37] father is going to go on and on and on
[1:07:40] that are going to start to talk now
[1:07:42] about uh uh uh uh their beginning
[1:07:46] praise the Lord
[1:07:48] and uh it's it's beautiful it's
[1:07:51] beautiful that uh uh these very people
[1:07:55] that were condemning this woman
[1:07:59] of idolatry because of a physical act
[1:08:03] that she was caught in
[1:08:05] Jesus is going to trace
[1:08:08] their genology to the adultery that was
[1:08:11] that took place in Eden right
[1:08:17] praise the Lord
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:19] because pretty soon
[1:08:23] they will they will say uh Abraham is
[1:08:26] our father
[1:08:28] and we are now born of fornication right
[1:08:33] praise the Lord
[1:08:35] amen and the conversation will go until
[1:08:38] it will go all the way back toward the
[1:08:40] beginning
[1:08:42] praise the Lord now these like I said
[1:08:45] these people that were that was uh uh uh
[1:08:48] uh about to Stone this woman because of
[1:08:52] a physical art that she was caught in
[1:08:56] they didn't know that the spirit of
[1:08:59] rebellion or the spirit that was making
[1:09:02] them to reject the word
[1:09:04] was the spirit of idolatry from the
[1:09:07] beginning
[1:09:10] praise the Lord
[1:09:12] they were they were looking at a
[1:09:14] physical art condemning her for the
[1:09:16] physical art when India's spirit
[1:09:19] they are guilty
[1:09:21] of the same Act
[1:09:28] praise the Lord
[1:09:30] amen
[1:09:36] so you can go on and on just read uh
[1:09:39] Saint John chapter 8 you you will enjoy
[1:09:42] the reading them you know Jesus go ahead
[1:09:45] and and and you know talk very very I
[1:09:48] say unto you uh you know whosoever
[1:09:50] committed sin is a seven to eight and
[1:09:53] the conversation went on they started to
[1:09:55] talk they started to talk
[1:09:57] and uh and then Jesus identified himself
[1:10:02] before Abraham was I am
[1:10:05] but is is uh
[1:10:08] is is beautiful because in these in
[1:10:11] these three women what I wanted to to
[1:10:15] bring out
[1:10:17] is the pattern
[1:10:20] predestination
[1:10:22] and the first resurrection
[1:10:24] which is the rapture
[1:10:27] so we saw Mary Magdalene in the first
[1:10:29] resurrection she was the one that first
[1:10:31] saw Jesus that's what I I call the first
[1:10:34] resurrection praise the Lord but so we
[1:10:38] we are looking at a woman here
[1:10:41] that
[1:10:44] was caught in a physical art
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:50] she was calling the physical eye brother
[1:10:52] Brown said yet in Jesus came and called
[1:10:54] he says
[1:10:58] when she did taught on those things
[1:11:02] she heard a man saying bring me a drink
[1:11:05] now this is the woman at the well
[1:11:09] we're not dealing with her tonight but I
[1:11:12] just want to bring a scene out of it
[1:11:13] because like brother Branham says who
[1:11:15] know the story Beyond her
[1:11:17] okay
[1:11:20] he says what's about it in the in in her
[1:11:24] Darkest Hour
[1:11:27] windhall Maura was gone maybe a pretty
[1:11:31] little lady being turned on the street
[1:11:36] to leave it
[1:11:38] sometimes it's it's not the little
[1:11:41] girl's fault
[1:11:44] is her parents fault
[1:11:47] to let to
[1:11:49] to let her get out like that
[1:11:54] and there she was
[1:11:56] Maybe
[1:11:58] her little curve all hanging down
[1:12:03] she was depleted going alone wearing
[1:12:06] nobody had anything to do with her a
[1:12:10] child
[1:12:12] Maybe
[1:12:14] a big story behind it
[1:12:18] praise the Lord
[1:12:20] just like a woman at Jesus feet there
[1:12:24] she has a story uh
[1:12:26] Beyond her life I also believe that this
[1:12:29] woman has a story behind her life like
[1:12:32] we all have story behind our lives
[1:12:38] praise the Lord
[1:12:41] but just like we we we we saw with uh
[1:12:46] with uh Mayor Michael Lane and uh and we
[1:12:49] will see the uh with the woman at the
[1:12:52] wear that brother Branham says uh you
[1:12:54] know she have a predestinated seat and
[1:12:57] the beauty of that uh you will see when
[1:13:00] we get there is very beautiful when you
[1:13:02] look at it in a scripture and that's and
[1:13:04] that is how I want to look at this
[1:13:06] tonight
[1:13:07] because I will tell you tonight it is
[1:13:10] only the predestinated seed can receive
[1:13:13] the pattern
[1:13:16] because you have to realize that
[1:13:19] not a pattern
[1:13:21] until is received as a pattern
[1:13:25] you have to receive it Jesus died for
[1:13:28] the sin of the word but his death will
[1:13:31] mean nothing to a person that do not
[1:13:33] receive it
[1:13:38] praise the Lord
[1:13:40] amen
[1:13:42] his death will mean nothing to a person
[1:13:45] that will not receive it that will not
[1:13:48] accept him as their lord and savior
[1:13:54] that will now confess and say Lord I
[1:13:56] believe uh uh you being the innocent
[1:13:59] won't die for all my guilt and all my
[1:14:02] shame
[1:14:05] praise the Lord
[1:14:06] so you see that and and that I delegate
[1:14:10] to accept God's offering
[1:14:14] is given to us by God
[1:14:18] it's not our own ability
[1:14:22] praise the Lord
[1:14:25] the ability for us to be able to accept
[1:14:28] what he have done for us
[1:14:31] on our marriage or on our knowledge or
[1:14:34] on our efforts but to realize that
[1:14:38] everything we have he gave it to us and
[1:14:42] if he don't help us we will not accept
[1:14:44] it neither will we use it rightly
[1:14:50] so all comes back to him
[1:14:53] praise the Lord so you see yeah there's
[1:14:56] there's uh that's the wonderful thing of
[1:14:59] of the pardon
[1:15:01] amen that's the beauty of the pardon
[1:15:22] let me read uh something yet again
[1:15:31] but when I mean the message leaving he
[1:15:33] loved me living dying buried raising
[1:15:36] coming
[1:15:38] he was talking about the expression he
[1:15:41] was talking about God expressing his
[1:15:43] love
[1:15:44] and how the love of God is expressed he
[1:15:48] says a real Godly love goes after that
[1:15:52] backslaughter till he finds him Godly
[1:15:57] love goes and stoop to the lowest of
[1:16:00] Hell to pick up the man or the woman
[1:16:03] that's falling
[1:16:05] that's what we are lacking today
[1:16:10] praise the Lord
[1:16:12] amen he says that's what we are lacking
[1:16:15] today we have a a fine cultural Church
[1:16:18] educated fine dress fan building and
[1:16:22] that's quite beautiful music
[1:16:25] some of the the best the word ever had
[1:16:28] but we are dying for some of that Godly
[1:16:33] love
[1:16:34] Jesus expressed a well when he found the
[1:16:39] prostitute dragged before him dragged
[1:16:43] before him guilty of an adultery
[1:16:47] and he dragged her before him and said
[1:16:49] now
[1:16:51] the law required
[1:16:53] for her to die
[1:16:55] what do you say about it
[1:16:59] praise the Lord
[1:17:01] amen
[1:17:03] what do you expect from the Throne of
[1:17:05] Mercy
[1:17:08] amen when brother Brown says no mortar
[1:17:11] can take another mortal before God
[1:17:15] and ever accused him
[1:17:20] praise the Lord
[1:17:21] the prayer of God said no matter what
[1:17:23] someone do to you you can never
[1:17:26] earnestly get down on your knees and
[1:17:29] take another person before God and ever
[1:17:33] accuse that person he said because pray
[1:17:35] this song when you really enter the
[1:17:38] channel of praying and get Before the
[1:17:40] Throne of Mercy you will now begin to
[1:17:42] feel sorry for that person and you will
[1:17:45] say God have mercy on my brother he
[1:17:47] really never meant to do it
[1:17:51] why can't you expect from the Throne of
[1:17:53] Mercy
[1:17:55] praise the Lord amen
[1:17:58] and yeah the broadest woman
[1:18:02] caught in adultery I mean I mean we can
[1:18:04] go through all the stories and say where
[1:18:06] is the man and all of that let the man
[1:18:07] stay wherever he is let he be there amen
[1:18:10] because Jesus never make him the the the
[1:18:12] you know the action of the story the
[1:18:15] woman was the one in concern amen praise
[1:18:18] the Lord you know and as I was as I was
[1:18:20] uh I was uh uh you know I was thinking
[1:18:25] about this and studying on the weekend
[1:18:27] you know as you look at all of this
[1:18:29] story then you even go back and as we
[1:18:31] were listening to marriage and divorce
[1:18:33] as we are going through the series you
[1:18:35] will realize and it to the to the human
[1:18:37] mind is it appeared like a story of
[1:18:41] Injustice it looks like the Lord of God
[1:18:44] was was was against the woman
[1:18:47] praise the Lord why was the man giving a
[1:18:51] second Covenant of of uh to go in with a
[1:18:54] polygamy and a woman calling
[1:18:56] now you see but if you bring it back and
[1:18:58] you realize praise the Lord amen you
[1:19:02] bring it back and you realize then you
[1:19:04] will understand why a prophet of God
[1:19:07] said
[1:19:09] there are three sacred that you was
[1:19:11] given to the woman
[1:19:18] it was a treasure
[1:19:22] it is because of of of all of those
[1:19:25] things that God empowered the woman
[1:19:31] with that
[1:19:35] that's the reason why the the the the
[1:19:38] the promise of redemption
[1:19:40] was given to the woman
[1:19:43] he said because of that
[1:19:46] now so if if a person do not understand
[1:19:49] that you will look at the rest of the
[1:19:52] Bible and says it was it's very unjust
[1:19:54] against the woman
[1:19:58] praise the Lord
[1:20:05] and that's why God has to send us a
[1:20:07] prophet because God's word is not unjust
[1:20:12] praise the Lord
[1:20:14] if you don't understand the law of
[1:20:16] contracts
[1:20:17] you will always take the worst part to
[1:20:20] be bad
[1:20:21] but it have to be there for you to
[1:20:23] appreciate the good part
[1:20:27] if you don't understand a lot of
[1:20:29] reproduction you always say what is this
[1:20:32] happening to me it will not have
[1:20:33] happened unless the seed that you saw
[1:20:35] because every seed we bring forth is
[1:20:38] kind
[1:20:40] you will reap what you saw
[1:20:43] so if you just look at one side of the
[1:20:46] queen you will think that it's unjust
[1:20:50] but no matter how you slice it it will
[1:20:53] always produce two size
[1:20:59] praise the Lord
[1:21:01] amen
[1:21:04] and that's the reason why
[1:21:08] you know uh
[1:21:09] it sounds in in people who think that oh
[1:21:13] yeah you know the the prophet of God you
[1:21:15] know it is it's always you know you you
[1:21:18] it's easy to take it in that kind of
[1:21:20] understanding just like Elijah he was
[1:21:22] against Jezebel this message is how on
[1:21:24] women know
[1:21:25] I don't believe that is how I'm with me
[1:21:29] I believe that this word is your
[1:21:32] protection
[1:21:35] this word is sent to protect you from
[1:21:37] the abuse of the age
[1:21:48] praise the Lord
[1:21:51] thank you
[1:21:52] if you don't understand it
[1:21:54] and you hear people in in secular church
[1:21:57] I mean that's all order for what is uh
[1:22:00] you know me too movement women
[1:22:02] Liberation and all of this going because
[1:22:04] it goes right back to the Bible the
[1:22:06] struggle there is that it looks like a
[1:22:08] woman has been left as a second class
[1:22:13] God gave her
[1:22:15] the greatest gift
[1:22:17] to be a life Giver
[1:22:20] just like him
[1:22:24] the greatest gift
[1:22:27] God gave it
[1:22:29] to the weakest vessel
[1:22:32] he put Heavenly treasure
[1:22:37] in
[1:22:38] a weak vessel
[1:22:40] all because of redemption
[1:22:47] praise the Lord
[1:22:49] now so all of these things and uh here
[1:22:52] is this woman here uh you know and and
[1:22:56] she's caught in this situation the
[1:22:58] Broadband says she's dragged in the
[1:23:00] street you know uh well thank God I mean
[1:23:04] thank God their child they even had the
[1:23:06] mind to bring her before Jesus just to
[1:23:08] tempt him or as they will have soon her
[1:23:10] behind the house and she will be dead
[1:23:14] by the drag car in the street and yeah
[1:23:16] they brought her before our lord Jesus
[1:23:19] praise the Lord
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:22] and uh and and and uh and bringing all
[1:23:27] their accusation against her this woman
[1:23:29] you know uh the Lord of Moses says their
[1:23:33] sauce should be sown once sealed down
[1:23:36] amen
[1:23:37] and the Bible says and Jesus didn't pay
[1:23:40] no attention to them praise the Lord he
[1:23:43] stood down and he started writing in his
[1:23:45] sin amen
[1:23:46] praise the Lord he started writing on
[1:23:48] the ground
[1:23:50] as though he heard him that and when
[1:23:53] they continue to ask him he lifted up
[1:23:56] himself and said unto them he that is
[1:23:58] without sin
[1:24:01] praise the Lord
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:04] he that is without sin among you let he
[1:24:08] cast the first stone
[1:24:11] praise the Lord
[1:24:13] and uh you see the thing there is the
[1:24:17] other I mean uh uh just reading this uh
[1:24:20] a lot of things can come is coming to my
[1:24:22] mind that we can look into here because
[1:24:25] you will realize that uh just like I
[1:24:28] said Jesus was looking all the way back
[1:24:31] to uh the beginning of time
[1:24:35] you must be looking at the birth of sin
[1:24:38] in Genesis 3.
[1:24:42] praise the Lord
[1:24:43] he was saying
[1:24:45] is there anyone among us whose birth
[1:24:49] cannot be traced back
[1:24:51] to Genesis 3.
[1:24:55] and he was the only one whose birth
[1:24:58] could not be traced back
[1:25:00] the woman the man everybody there birth
[1:25:05] could be traced back to Genesis 3.
[1:25:09] right
[1:25:11] praise the Lord
[1:25:14] and you see the the Bible says and then
[1:25:16] when he said that he dropped his head
[1:25:19] down and walked took place a spirit of
[1:25:22] conviction
[1:25:25] a spirit of conviction
[1:25:29] praise the Lord
[1:25:31] took a hold of those men and and
[1:25:33] everybody dropped their song from their
[1:25:35] from the the the heirus person to the
[1:25:38] least and the Bible says they went away
[1:25:42] and he was left with a woman
[1:25:45] alone because you see there's one of the
[1:25:49] things they are saying
[1:25:51] leaves
[1:25:53] in a human spirit
[1:25:56] is more than
[1:25:59] you know all the physical art
[1:26:06] praise the Lord
[1:26:07] saying
[1:26:09] actually
[1:26:15] destroy the human spirit
[1:26:24] we know that uh you know you you talk
[1:26:28] about uh Genesis chapter 3 we take the
[1:26:32] the you know the
[1:26:36] the act of The Serpent and Eve and and
[1:26:39] sometimes it blowed our mind as a great
[1:26:42] mystery it's supposed to be something
[1:26:44] that is that should be very simple you
[1:26:46] know for people to understand you know
[1:26:48] uh most great teachers in the Bible you
[1:26:51] know Scholars they will talk about
[1:26:52] Genesis chapter 6 and they will now want
[1:26:55] to believe that those uh that the sons
[1:26:57] of God they will say is that they were
[1:27:00] Angels they would say that there were
[1:27:02] there were you know uh nephilis now I
[1:27:06] was I would think in my mind why why
[1:27:09] would it be difficult for them to
[1:27:11] believe that the the second was a man
[1:27:13] and it's easy for them to believe that
[1:27:16] these Angels were made
[1:27:19] the reason why it's difficult is because
[1:27:22] there's a mystery in Genesis chapter 3.
[1:27:29] praise the Lord
[1:27:31] that's where the same question is hate
[1:27:37] because if you take it naturally God
[1:27:39] Adam came fresh from the hands of God
[1:27:44] and Eve is about product that came out
[1:27:47] of Adam the same product that God made
[1:27:50] fresh from his hands
[1:27:53] they are bones their blood everything
[1:27:56] that ran through them was righteousness
[1:27:59] how they were seen now contaminated the
[1:28:02] human blood
[1:28:04] how did it coming
[1:28:08] how did that contamination took place
[1:28:12] how
[1:28:14] it was the mystery of blood
[1:28:19] your science class will tell you that
[1:28:23] praise the Lord but you see what
[1:28:25] happened there is there there was just a
[1:28:28] physical act
[1:28:30] but what took place in the spiritual art
[1:28:33] is that
[1:28:34] see unbelief
[1:28:37] was dropped in the human spirit
[1:28:43] unbelief was dropped in the human Spirit
[1:28:45] that's the reason why no matter how uh
[1:28:50] experience we have with God we say how
[1:28:53] this this fight in the human spirit I
[1:28:56] mean you always say well I'm trying to
[1:28:58] find a word of God
[1:28:59] here
[1:29:01] the person know that they are safe the
[1:29:03] question of being saved is not their
[1:29:05] question but there is a struggle in the
[1:29:08] human spirit
[1:29:10] it is because of Doubt sin unbelief
[1:29:15] that was dropped in the human spirit
[1:29:19] praise the Lord
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:23] the physical eye was just the mixture of
[1:29:25] blood
[1:29:28] now so we see here that
[1:29:32] Jesus
[1:29:34] speaking this word convict these men and
[1:29:37] every one of them dropped their Stones
[1:29:39] everybody the Bible says they were
[1:29:41] convicted in their hearts
[1:29:43] that's why the word of God would do
[1:29:46] the words will always go back to address
[1:29:49] that question
[1:29:51] the word when the word is preached unto
[1:29:53] you and you receive the word
[1:29:57] in the womb of your mind brother Baron
[1:30:00] says that's the first place you receive
[1:30:01] the word Thy word starts to go around in
[1:30:04] your conscience it starts to go around
[1:30:06] and what is this doing the breaking is
[1:30:08] is moving in your spirit and it's trying
[1:30:11] to find you know if there is if there is
[1:30:14] any Resident of guilt in you
[1:30:17] because the the purpose of the word is
[1:30:20] to deal with guilt
[1:30:24] amen when Jesus said there is no
[1:30:28] condemnation unto them that are in
[1:30:30] Christ it is when the word has there
[1:30:33] with guilt in you
[1:30:37] praise the Lord
[1:30:39] the pardon is
[1:30:42] a pattern in a sense that we are
[1:30:45] pardoned and we will never remember that
[1:30:48] we did this again or or we would not do
[1:30:50] it again the the you know uh the the
[1:30:53] possibility of doing it again is there
[1:30:57] but the pardon is where the word comes
[1:31:02] to be with guilt
[1:31:06] so you see right here when Jesus said
[1:31:09] woman mourn you they have not seen
[1:31:13] he just rolled back the storm and
[1:31:15] everybody starts to feel a sense of
[1:31:17] guilt in there
[1:31:20] praise the Lord
[1:31:21] amen but what did he did to the woman
[1:31:24] when they were all gone away
[1:31:28] says woman where are thy accusers
[1:31:32] praise the Lord
[1:31:37] did any man accuse thee
[1:31:40] If any man said anything to thee after
[1:31:42] they have all
[1:31:46] have their sense of guilt
[1:31:49] praise the Lord
[1:31:50] that's what happens when when you are
[1:31:52] guilted it's I mean it's very hard for
[1:31:55] you too
[1:31:56] you have to really be possessed
[1:32:00] to shout that guilty away like Jesus
[1:32:02] says and not taking the beam from your
[1:32:04] eyes and try to condemn another person
[1:32:07] he says she said no man Lord and Jesus
[1:32:12] said neither do I condemn be
[1:32:16] go and see no more
[1:32:19] praise the Lord
[1:32:21] now only neither do I condemn thee but
[1:32:24] he went back and there with that girl
[1:32:27] now you see it was not telling the woman
[1:32:29] that I I forgive you but he was telling
[1:32:32] the woman go and see no more in a sense
[1:32:35] like I have dealt with that
[1:32:38] I have dealt with that root cause
[1:32:42] there was not a commitment
[1:32:45] it was a word that would take effect it
[1:32:48] was almost like when Jesus says your
[1:32:51] faith has healed thee
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:56] it was it was not like that the father
[1:32:58] talking to the little child this thing
[1:33:00] that you do don't do it again because he
[1:33:03] don't have the ability
[1:33:05] to take the power of sin out of that
[1:33:07] child but this one that is talking he
[1:33:10] has the ability to reach right down
[1:33:12] there
[1:33:13] and take every unclean desire from that
[1:33:16] woman
[1:33:19] praise the Lord so when he spoke to one
[1:33:23] they were convicted
[1:33:25] when he spoke to this other one she was
[1:33:27] she had another form of conviction
[1:33:31] is that she was released from her guilt
[1:33:36] her form of conviction released her from
[1:33:39] her guilt
[1:33:40] these other guys form of conviction they
[1:33:43] went from the service feeling more
[1:33:44] guilty
[1:33:46] praise the Lord they went from the
[1:33:49] service feeling more guilty like brother
[1:33:51] Graham says you can never come in the
[1:33:52] presence of God and go back to sin
[1:33:56] it'll go worse than you can
[1:33:58] or you go more free than when you came
[1:34:01] praise the Lord
[1:34:03] so one group went back feeling more
[1:34:05] guilty
[1:34:10] and this woman
[1:34:11] experience the pattern
[1:34:15] neither do I condemn thee
[1:34:19] there is no condemnation to them that
[1:34:22] are in Christ
[1:34:24] it's the same it's the same statement
[1:34:25] neither do I condemned it
[1:34:28] go
[1:34:30] and say no more now if you will not
[1:34:32] condemn her there I don't think he will
[1:34:34] condemn her before the throne
[1:34:39] praise the Lord
[1:34:41] you see because the thing is is almost
[1:34:44] like birbam says God is he he's not
[1:34:46] playing games with us
[1:34:50] this this Plan of Redemption is God's
[1:34:54] business
[1:34:55] and he's serious about it
[1:34:59] praise the lord we better make out our
[1:35:01] mind because God is serious about it
[1:35:04] that's his Plan of Redemption
[1:35:07] his purpose was so to to make his
[1:35:10] attributes to manifest his attributes
[1:35:12] that was his purpose
[1:35:15] it was not to kind of a play games for
[1:35:17] people live and and one time you are
[1:35:19] saving another time you are not saved
[1:35:21] and then you can do whatever you want to
[1:35:22] do and then you make up your mind a lot
[1:35:24] now I want to serve you and God is not
[1:35:26] into those games
[1:35:34] praise the Lord
[1:35:45] he said neither do I condemn thee
[1:35:47] go
[1:35:50] sin
[1:35:52] no more
[1:35:55] praise the Lord
[1:35:57] amen
[1:35:59] now
[1:36:01] the place comes where
[1:36:08] they were still on the
[1:36:11] the Old Testament Covenant
[1:36:14] the sacrifice
[1:36:17] has not been offered
[1:36:21] praise the Lord
[1:36:24] amen the sacrifice has not been offered
[1:36:27] the Holy Ghost has not come yet
[1:36:35] glory be to God
[1:36:38] better than this
[1:36:42] how could the atonement take effect
[1:36:45] when the sacrifice have now been offered
[1:36:52] how could they Atomic take effect
[1:36:57] because the Holy Ghost was not given yet
[1:36:59] but yet he's telling the woman go and
[1:37:02] seeing no more
[1:37:08] praise the Lord
[1:37:13] now Alberta Brandon will he will he will
[1:37:16] describe it
[1:37:18] uh
[1:37:20] story he tells
[1:37:23] of a man that was condemned
[1:37:28] he was condemned
[1:37:31] and
[1:37:33] he was to be killed
[1:37:38] and the King asked him and says
[1:37:44] I've given you one wish that you can ask
[1:37:47] for before you be killed
[1:37:51] he says my wish is I want to drink water
[1:37:55] is that all you want
[1:37:58] he said yeah I want to drink water
[1:38:05] let me drink mine
[1:38:08] praise the Lord
[1:38:11] this is that all you want he said yeah
[1:38:13] that's all I want
[1:38:16] so brother Graham says well this the
[1:38:19] king said then you're giving water to
[1:38:21] drink if that's all he wants
[1:38:24] I'll tell you will ask for your children
[1:38:26] to be taken care of your children should
[1:38:28] be sponsored you know if you give your
[1:38:31] wife a lamb say no I wanna I just want a
[1:38:34] glass of water
[1:38:36] so brother Graham said they bring him a
[1:38:38] glass of water
[1:38:40] and he pulled the water on the ground
[1:38:45] remember he said he want to drink water
[1:38:52] praise the Lord
[1:38:54] so
[1:38:56] the thing here is that they can gather
[1:38:58] the water off the ground then they can
[1:39:00] kill him
[1:39:08] do you grab the story
[1:39:10] yeah
[1:39:13] brother Branham says this he says that's
[1:39:16] word that's word
[1:39:18] the atonement can take effect before the
[1:39:21] sacrifice is killed
[1:39:25] because Isaiah said he was wounded for
[1:39:29] my transgression
[1:39:30] he was ruled for our iniquity and by his
[1:39:34] tribes we were healed but Jesus had not
[1:39:37] Got Stripes yet yet he was healing
[1:39:40] people
[1:39:40] sure how was that
[1:39:45] how how did it happen
[1:39:49] praise the Lord you love the Lord
[1:39:51] tonight isn't God good
[1:39:54] he's the only one that can bypass his
[1:39:57] own word
[1:39:59] amen
[1:40:01] he's not above his word
[1:40:04] but yet he can disguise himself and go
[1:40:07] around his word and still come out to be
[1:40:09] truth
[1:40:12] he loved the Lord tonight
[1:40:16] musicians you can come
[1:40:18] we will continue on Sunday
[1:40:21] the Lord give us another opportunity
[1:40:28] how
[1:40:29] he's telling this woman go and see no
[1:40:32] more where will the power come from
[1:40:40] how is he Healing The Sick and raising
[1:40:42] the Dead
[1:40:43] when he have not gone to Calvary yet
[1:40:47] you know
[1:40:51] he have not gone to Calvary he have not
[1:40:53] been bruised
[1:40:55] he has not been killed
[1:40:58] but yet the effect of the atonement is
[1:41:02] taking place on the life of people just
[1:41:04] like how
[1:41:06] jairo's daughter was raised back to life
[1:41:09] when Jesus called her back to life
[1:41:13] it was not a fake thing she came back to
[1:41:15] life so when Jesus said this woman go
[1:41:17] and see no more it was an effect that
[1:41:20] she was going away
[1:41:23] with the same nature gone
[1:41:30] that's the reason why the prophet of God
[1:41:32] says everyone
[1:41:33] must have the opportunity to hear the
[1:41:36] world one time
[1:41:38] he said just one time
[1:41:41] it's enough
[1:41:46] it's enough we don't need uh uh uh uh on
[1:41:51] and on service
[1:41:53] all we're doing is yes we are just
[1:41:55] creating an atmosphere
[1:41:57] we are just creating an atmosphere
[1:41:59] bringing our lack of fire together
[1:42:01] creating an atmosphere thanking God
[1:42:03] praising God that's all we are doing
[1:42:05] but one time when that word is preached
[1:42:09] that I see make a contact with your soul
[1:42:11] is enough there is no devil in hell no
[1:42:15] matter what you go through there is no
[1:42:17] devil in hell
[1:42:19] that can be able to outroot what God has
[1:42:22] already planted in your soul
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:25] just one contact
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:30] all we're doing we are just coming and
[1:42:32] watering that sea
[1:42:34] we are just coming and watering our
[1:42:36] scene
[1:42:37] that's the reason why I don't have to
[1:42:39] impress you because I'm not the one that
[1:42:41] grew in the sea he's the one that
[1:42:43] planted it
[1:42:45] he's the one that blesses it
[1:42:49] and it grows through eternal life
[1:42:53] all of these things were we think that
[1:42:55] we're having something in our hand we
[1:42:57] guess a special Ministry that we will do
[1:42:59] something in and the church will all of
[1:43:01] those things is we must we must throw
[1:43:03] those things away we must always learn
[1:43:06] to appreciate his presence we will
[1:43:09] always learn to appreciate he says I
[1:43:11] will never leave you I will never
[1:43:13] forsake you
[1:43:20] Christian Life become tougher for you
[1:43:24] when the devil can blind you from seeing
[1:43:27] those promises
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:38] let's stand on our feet
[1:43:41] she
[1:43:44] Jesus
[1:43:46] you are the Lamb of God
[1:43:56] [Music]
[1:44:18] of me
[1:44:24] [Applause]
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:30] you are my friends
[1:44:38] [Music]

[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:47:09] my God
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:35] please
[1:47:41] foreign
[1:47:54] just like we said tonight
[1:48:01] there is no condemnation to them that
[1:48:03] are in Christ
[1:48:05] the purpose of the word the purpose of
[1:48:07] the Holy Ghost
[1:48:09] is to deal with sins to deal with guilt
[1:48:13] if there is anything that is making you
[1:48:16] to feel guilty you have to go to Calvary
[1:48:18] you have to believe in the finished work
[1:48:21] because as long as the devil can keep
[1:48:24] you in that condition he will rob you of
[1:48:27] every Victory you don't work it out in
[1:48:30] your mind
[1:48:32] don't make yourself to believe that you
[1:48:34] are you are forgiving no
[1:48:36] it is not you that make yourself
[1:48:38] forgiving
[1:48:39] you got to take God's word
[1:48:42] you got to put it back to the word
[1:48:44] you got these law this is why your word
[1:48:47] says I believe your word you want you
[1:48:50] want that thing to drop down in your
[1:48:52] heart
[1:48:54] don't get work up in your mind
[1:48:57] because the devil knows when you are
[1:48:59] woke up in your mind
[1:49:01] and you also know when you have a
[1:49:03] conviction
[1:49:05] he knows when that thing dropped in your
[1:49:08] heart
[1:49:13] when it drops in your heart
[1:49:17] foreign
[1:49:19] to talk about it
[1:49:25] because it's placed under the seed of
[1:49:27] God's forgive forgetfulness
[1:49:31] is placed into God's seed or
[1:49:34] forgetfulness
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:42] that's what the problem is the pardon is
[1:49:46] to address guilt
[1:49:48] in our life
[1:49:52] foreign
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:50:01] there's a fountain
[1:50:04] of blood drained from Emmanuel vein
[1:50:07] where the sin of plunge beneath that
[1:50:10] floor and lose all
[1:50:14] his guilty sin
[1:50:18] we plunge beneath the floor Now by
[1:50:21] Pentecostal idea Lord I cover myself
[1:50:24] with the blood Lord I wash my family in
[1:50:26] the blood no you plunge beneath the
[1:50:29] floor by accepting God's provision
[1:50:31] accepting God's promise
[1:50:35] we plunged beneath the floor
[1:50:41] to lose or guilt
[1:50:45] guilty if the world asks you to go and
[1:50:47] make it right you are willing to go and
[1:50:50] make it right if the word says tell your
[1:50:53] sister sorry tell your brother sorry you
[1:50:55] would do it because that is the thing
[1:50:57] that plunged you beneath the floor and
[1:51:00] the word said tell your husband sorry
[1:51:01] you're going to do it because that is
[1:51:04] the action that takes you beyond the
[1:51:06] blood
[1:51:13] foreign

[1:51:22] what a blessed people we are

[2:05:01] you say
[2:05:02] you the preacher really spoke to me
[2:05:04] today
[2:05:07] but sometimes there is also an attitude
[2:05:10] where
[2:05:15] we receive the word
[2:05:18] we were blessed by the word
[2:05:21] but you have to realize that the Holy
[2:05:24] Ghost comes to set you free
[2:05:27] and the enemy can use that same word and
[2:05:30] make you go home guilty
[2:05:32] yes
[2:05:39] and most of the time that's when people
[2:05:41] starts to struggle
[2:05:43] and it starts to fuss with the word
[2:05:47] I was the one he was talking about he
[2:05:49] was talking to me
[2:05:51] and they did and the devil would just
[2:05:53] put a flame under there
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:05:59] you have to remember
[2:06:01] the Holy Ghost always come to set you
[2:06:03] free
[2:06:05] that's what that's what he comes from he
[2:06:07] comes to set you free he wants to make
[2:06:09] you free
[2:06:15] the enemy comes to see and kill but he
[2:06:17] comes to give life
[2:06:19] he wants you to be free and live in the
[2:06:23] joy of the word
[2:06:30] let's sing that and we'll be dismissed
