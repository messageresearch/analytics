[0:29] trust in you you would never let her we
[0:32] are so grateful Lord Jesus that it is
[0:35] not by might nor by power but by your
[0:37] spirit we shall overcome there is no
[0:41] doubt about it we don't care what the
[0:42] enemy is doing our fate is in you our
[0:45] fate is grounded in you and we don't
[0:48] care what happens to our lives we know
[0:51] somehow dear Lord Jesus you are going to
[0:54] pull us through because we belong to you
[0:57] we come from you and we go back to you
[1:02] we are children of the Most High God you
[1:06] have taken a delight in us our lives are
[1:08] in your hands and absolutely nothing can
[1:11] go wrong we just thank you so much Lord

[1:19] ones we give you the glory this morning
[1:21] we give you the owner we praise thee

[1:25] the name of Jesus our Lord and Savior
[1:27] once again father it is time for Sunday
[1:30] school we have the next 30 minutes to
[1:33] encourage ourselves far we've been
[1:34] talking of prayer for some time now and
[1:36] we under revision mode we pray dear Lord
[1:39] Jesus just come and ignite our Souls
[1:43] around your word this morning in Jesus
[1:46] name Amen
[1:48] god bless you saints so we are still in
[1:53] the revision mode so talking about
[1:57] prayer just gathering the pieces here
[2:01] and there and happy to see you guys once
[2:06] again
[2:09] last week I touched a little bit on this
[2:15] topic and I'm going to take it I'm just
[2:20] going to just touch it briefly and then
[2:22] we skip and go to something else I was
[2:26] talking about situations that provoked
[2:28] prayer and I talked about gratitude when
[2:38] you are happy about what God has done it
[2:42] provokes prayer you want to go to God
[2:45] and then thank you for what he has done
[2:49] and we said what that does as we took
[2:53] our scripture reading from Luke 17 17
[2:58] where they're not 10 lepers that were
[3:00] cleansed and how many went back to the
[3:04] Lord Jesus to say thank you only one did
[3:06] and a Lord Jesus was so happy with what
[3:12] he did and we made it categorically very
[3:17] clear then whenever God does something
[3:20] for you and you go back to tell God
[3:22] thank you what it does is that it opens
[3:25] the door very wide for greater things to
[3:29] happen in your life when you show
[3:32] appreciation towards the little things
[3:35] God has done in your life it opens the
[3:38] door very wide for greater tends to
[3:40] happen so it's a situation that provokes
[3:43] prayer and we also looked at desperation
[3:46] and we took our scripture reading from
[3:50] Luke 22:44 been in agony talking about
[3:55] the Lord Jesus Christ been in agony he
[3:58] prayed more earnestly and his sweat was
[4:03] as it were great drops of blood falling
[4:08] down to the ground
[4:10] we know that the life of the Lord Jesus
[4:13] all his life was just a timid prayer but
[4:16] one moment why he prayed and he prayed
[4:20] so honestly
[4:22] was when he was in agony
[4:26] desperation said in that is what happens
[4:30] to our lives when storms set in when a
[4:35] storm comes in it cause desperation it
[4:38] gets you to be in agony and we taught
[4:45] about job here and his situation as a
[4:52] god driven stone we said God can allow
[4:55] storms to come and we talked about job
[4:59] last week
[5:00] and we also said that you can create
[5:03] your own strong and we talked about
[5:06] something and we said Delilah was not
[5:11] some sense enemy the Philistines were
[5:15] not some sense enemy some sense enemy
[5:18] was himself he created his own stone now
[5:24] so going over this we said a stone can
[5:33] be a good thing and a stone can be a bad
[5:36] thing depending on where you stand where
[5:41] you are standing sure on the way what a
[5:45] storm would do is draw you closer to God
[5:47] and we also talked about John Wesley
[5:52] that he credited his prayer life to his
[5:57] wife not because his wife was patting
[6:01] him on the back that it is time to pray
[6:03] no but his wife had muscles and would
[6:09] beat the prophet of God around like a
[6:11] kid and that drove him more on his knees
[6:15] to seek the face of God praise be to God
[6:20] but when you are not standing sure what
[6:24] desperation would do is carry you away
[6:27] from God instead of bringing you closer
[6:33] it carries you away from God that is
[6:37] what a stone would do and we also said
[6:40] that when you are being carried away by
[6:43] a storm it is not an indication that you
[6:48] are not a child of God it could be but
[6:52] what it could also mean is that you are
[6:55] not standing where you are supposed to
[6:57] be instead of standing on the rock you
[7:02] are standing on a sinking sand so when
[7:05] the storm comes it takes you away it is
[7:09] not an indication that you are not a
[7:11] child of God what it means is that you
[7:14] are lost and easy oh praise be to God
[7:22] now
[7:31] when you read when you read first
[7:47] Corinthians 10:12 I have it here you can
[7:52] note it down because we have a limited
[7:54] time I'll just try to capture things and
[7:55] then I'll see how fast we can go
[7:57] first Corinthians 10:12 let he that
[8:02] thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[8:05] falls if you think you are standing take
[8:10] heed lest you fall what it means is that
[8:15] examine yourself do an introspection
[8:19] examine yourself against the Word of God
[8:22] and make sure that you are truly
[8:25] standing lest you fall that is what
[8:32] happens sometimes you find people they
[8:36] are not standing but they think they are
[8:39] standing then when the storms come it
[8:44] creates a problem now we all have our
[8:52] high points and our low points in life
[8:56] we are talking about what desperation as
[9:00] something that would draw you closer to
[9:02] God and when you find yourself in the
[9:07] gutter somewhere that is not the end of
[9:11] life when the storm comes and they don't
[9:16] draw you closer to God and you find
[9:19] yourself being carried far away from God
[9:22] it is not the end of life because the
[9:26] Bible says revelation 2:5 remember
[9:32] therefore from whence thou art fallen
[9:34] and repent and do the first works or
[9:38] else I will come quickly
[9:41] alik I will come unto thee quickly and
[9:44] will remove thy candlestick out of his
[9:47] place except thou repent so what it also
[9:51] means is that even when it does not draw
[9:54] you closer to God and it carries you far
[9:56] away from God God is still beating you
[10:00] it is not the end of life God is bidding
[10:05] you come remember from Wednesday at
[10:09] following get back praise be to God and
[10:17] as I have 1:18 confirm the story come
[10:25] now and let us reason together saith the
[10:28] Lord though your sins be as scarlet they
[10:30] shall be as white as snow though they be
[10:34] red like crimson they shall be as wool
[10:39] so a child of God I don't care what it
[10:44] is that happens you know God allows
[10:48] situations to come away not because he
[10:52] hates us God wants you to get closer
[11:06] and if situations come and it don't get
[11:09] you closer to God and they get you
[11:11] further away it is not the end of life
[11:14] God is so bidden you come he has given
[11:18] you that great invitation come and let
[11:21] us reason together
[11:22] praise be to God so desperation will
[11:27] draw you closer to God now having said
[11:31] this I want us to look at a few factors
[11:34] that would cause desperation in our
[11:38] spiritual lives sickness is one we have
[11:45] talked a lot about the third of his
[11:47] Phoenicia woman whose daughter was
[11:49] possessed by evil spirit today I just
[11:53] want to talk about the woman that had an
[11:56] issue of blood for 12 years sickness
[12:02] would create desperation and it would
[12:06] cause you to seek God then when you get
[12:10] to that point you can't take that
[12:12] reproach anymore you can't take that
[12:14] shame anymore the appeal on what you are
[12:17] suffering from you can't take that pain
[12:18] anymore you can't take that sleepless
[12:20] night anymore you would want to cry out
[12:24] to God it drives you it makes you
[12:28] desperate and drives you on your knees
[12:32] and it gets you to places in the
[12:35] spiritual realms where you probably
[12:38] would never have gotten to bed for
[12:41] that's a condition press beauty god this
[12:45] one had an issue of blood for 12 years
[12:48] she may have done everything possible
[12:51] and there was no remedy until she said
[12:55] to herself if I can only turn the hem of
[12:58] His garment the gamut of the Lord Jesus
[13:00] I'll be made to go sometimes we think
[13:03] maybe she just walk straight and then
[13:05] went and talked to him of the Lord I
[13:06] mean the hem of His garment and then she
[13:08] was made whole the Lord Jesus was a
[13:11] crowd puller everywhere he went the
[13:15] crowd followed him
[13:17] and I see him go this way and there was
[13:20] a crowd
[13:21] push it down I see her bodies way and
[13:25] there was a crowd she couldn't get
[13:27] through but she never gave up
[13:29] that is what desperation does it would
[13:33] cause you to do things that you wouldn't
[13:36] do under normal circumstances until she
[13:42] finally touch the hem of the gamut of
[13:46] the Lord Jesus when you are desperate it
[13:51] doesn't matter what names they call you
[13:53] what I might be referred to as a dog I
[13:56] don't care how much in sauce they hip on
[13:59] you it will never dump in your spirit
[14:02] why because you are desperate anything
[14:08] about a Greek woman that is what
[14:15] aspiration can do it drives you drives
[14:20] you towards God sometimes we think that
[14:28] when you parade those nice nice nice
[14:32] waits in prayer that is when you are
[14:36] drawing your drawing closer but God is
[14:40] very interested in those national
[14:42] vocabularies those nice nice voice if
[14:47] they are not coming from your heart
[14:49] and you are coming from here God is not
[14:51] interested in that if they can come from
[14:57] the heart if you find your heart
[15:01] bleeding with those wastes in prayer
[15:04] that is what draws goes attention if you
[15:13] can find your heart bleeding with the
[15:16] ways the Bible says in psalm 51:17 there
[15:26] are sacrifices of God
[15:28] a broken spirit a broken and a contrite
[15:34] heart O God thou will not despise now
[15:43] when you are so desperate or when you
[15:47] are driven to that point sometimes when
[15:51] you are praying you can't even make
[15:53] sense of what you are saying you can't
[15:59] make sense of what you are saying if you
[16:05] should join those pieces of voice you
[16:07] are saying if you should join them
[16:09] together they don't make any sense to
[16:11] you but that draws God on the same
[16:15] because the Bible says a broken and a
[16:18] contrite heart God would not despise if
[16:22] your heart is ruptured is your heart if
[16:25] your heart is bleeding with those voice
[16:28] wonderful it may not make sense to you
[16:32] but that would rock or down that is when
[16:35] you hit the point of desperation praise
[16:40] be to God the fear of death when you
[16:50] read Isaiah 38 1 2 5 it talks about the
[16:55] prophet has a higher the Bible says he
[16:59] was sick unto death I don't think that
[17:01] worried him so much because desperation
[17:07] never set in until God sent Isaiah the
[17:11] prophet to go and tell his Akaya that
[17:14] does say as the Lord got your house in
[17:18] order does say the law you would die and
[17:20] not live that was the moment desperation
[17:23] set in and the Bible said he turned his
[17:27] face to the wall and he cried out to God
[17:29] and God had him
[17:35] now deaf if you can smell death from its
[17:45] distance you will not sit down and wait
[17:48] for it to come praise be to God we know
[17:53] is the Word of God if Christ is in one
[17:58] way or the other we'll be living here
[18:00] this is not our home but God in His
[18:04] wisdom has made it a secret now you
[18:07] don't know when you're going to die you
[18:10] don't know how you are going to die if
[18:12] God should open our eyes to rates there
[18:15] will not be peace in this on this earth
[18:20] you have somebody that is left with one
[18:23] year crying and mourning already you
[18:26] have somebody that's left with ten years
[18:27] wailing already you have somebody that's
[18:30] like I mean don't be confusion on the
[18:32] land sometimes it's just happening the
[18:35] following day and then you are sitting
[18:37] with your loved ones
[18:38] oh god bless you god bless you see you
[18:40] tomorrow morning you go to bed and that
[18:42] is the end of the story you don't know
[18:44] when is coming it is a dangerous thing
[18:47] because the Lord Jesus being God and
[18:52] having seen what you're going to go
[18:55] through in advance it wasn't easy
[18:57] sometimes waiting because he was God in
[19:00] human flesh oh it was just easy
[19:02] it wasn't easy that was why he could
[19:05] pray and say let this cup pass me by
[19:08] because he foresaw what was going to go
[19:11] through that was why God kept it a
[19:14] secret and let me tell you I've been a
[19:18] prison officer before and there were
[19:21] prisoners that were sentenced to death I
[19:23] know so what is that what is that just
[19:26] one day it's because they have not seen
[19:29] death coming so they could say anything
[19:33] and one thing about those murder
[19:37] I mean before they kill you they will
[19:39] come and tell you we are coming for you
[19:42] tomorrow tomorrow is your last day what
[19:44] do you want
[19:46] as some would say I want a packet of
[19:48] cigarettes the light was agreed throw it
[19:52] away
[19:53] light another one throw it away because
[19:56] smoked a cigarette
[19:58] Sam was ok I want vodka so they want to
[20:02] drink I'm booths and I don't even know
[20:05] when they are being shot at they will
[20:08] drink the whole bottle of vodka hardly
[20:11] call it vodka and so never get pushed
[20:16] the whole night they are restless
[20:19] the fear of death can trait can cause
[20:23] desperation when you know where you
[20:27] stand and you can smell death coming you
[20:30] will not sit and wait for it you are
[20:32] going to fight it and you'll fight it on
[20:35] your knees we are talking about the
[20:37] factors that will drive you to a
[20:40] desperate moment with God then you will
[20:44] cry out to God and you know there is a
[20:46] God that is here in you that God becomes
[20:49] so real to you at that point in time
[20:53] that has ever been and you know that you
[20:57] are talking to a human being you are
[20:58] talking to a being a living being
[21:01] praise be to God now another thing that
[21:07] can drive you into a murder of
[21:12] desperation with God in your prayer life
[21:15] is persecution when persecutions rights
[21:22] church is no longer at your convenience
[21:25] it's a murder between life and death
[21:28] why because persecution has come to the
[21:33] camp
[21:36] God always wants you to dial that his
[21:39] hotline God has a hotline he wants to
[21:45] hear from his children he wants you to
[21:47] dial that hotline he was to have that
[21:51] intimacy with you as a child and when
[21:55] God is not here in it he got gritty
[21:57] situation that would ruin
[22:00] praise be to God so persecution you
[22:04] don't think about imitation of the Lord
[22:06] Jesus Christ and what do you want true
[22:10] how do you may have prayed and prayed
[22:12] and prayed asking the Lord as the Lord
[22:17] Jesus said oh if it is your will let
[22:20] this cup pass me by and I hear them pray
[22:23] asking God let this cup pass me by
[22:26] nevertheless not my will let your will
[22:30] be done now you know in times of
[22:32] persecution when you pray and you pray
[22:35] and you pray there are two things that
[22:37] can happen either God would take you
[22:42] away from that persecution or take the
[22:45] position persecution away from you oh
[22:48] you are still going to go through it but
[22:52] God is going to give you enough grace to
[22:54] go through it now even when you are
[22:58] going through it you would wonder people
[23:01] will stand and look at you how did he
[23:03] manage is this a human being it's
[23:06] because the grace of God is more than
[23:09] sufficient it is not as if when you pray
[23:14] body just went stored up in the kitchen
[23:17] he can do it he can do it but other
[23:21] times you allow it but he gives you
[23:25] enough grace to go through it praise be
[23:32] to God
[23:32] I see meshach Shadrach and Abednego when
[23:39] they were in Babylon there were not just
[23:44] some house boys these were men that
[23:47] Nebuchadnezzar set as hell over some of
[23:51] the provinces
[23:54] when King Nabucco Genizah made a golden
[23:57] image they knew about it the newest
[24:00] intention why because there were men
[24:05] that were on top day some of his
[24:08] right-hand men
[24:10] it did not take them by surprise on that
[24:15] day when he announced to the people said
[24:18] when they hear the son of the trumpet
[24:20] the sultry the musical instrument
[24:22] everybody should buy before the golden
[24:24] image and anybody that did not bow was
[24:27] going to be cast into the fiery furnace
[24:29] it didn't come to them by surprise they
[24:34] knew it there may have prayed they may
[24:40] have prayed because they foresaw a storm
[24:43] coming they may have prayed before that
[24:46] day Oh father don't let him see us we
[24:52] love you we are children of God we are
[24:56] not going to bar before this image but
[24:59] blend your eyes don't let him see us so
[25:03] we don't get into trouble but it didn't
[25:05] happen that way
[25:06] praise be to God and a son of the
[25:11] trumpet the musical instruments wonders
[25:14] founded and other people bought before
[25:17] the golden image meshach Shadrach and
[25:21] Abednego and there were some children's
[25:27] who saw them and then went and told the
[25:32] king now you know what you have made a
[25:35] decree that whoever does not watch you
[25:37] die these three children did not bow
[25:41] they said what he goes who angry he
[25:46] commanded them to be brought
[25:48] I'm giving another chance I they sounded
[25:52] the trumpet
[25:53] you guys should bow if you don't bow I'm
[25:56] cussing into the very finish wonderful
[25:59] praise be to God when you are prayed up
[26:03] when you are prayed up when you know you
[26:06] are living in the will of God you don't
[26:09] care what happens as Paul said for me to
[26:12] live is Christ and to die is gain it
[26:16] doesn't make any difference
[26:18] oh my I thought I was just coming but I
[26:21] have very little time it doesn't make
[26:23] any difference and at Orakei okay who
[26:29] would not be careful to as a you in this
[26:32] manner we are not going to borrow praise
[26:37] be to God because we know our God would
[26:40] deliver us and if he doesn't even
[26:43] deliver us praise be to God we are not
[26:46] going to bow he said okay he commanded
[26:50] his people to hit the finish seven times
[26:52] well they did and they bound them
[26:55] oh I can just hear them saying whenever
[26:57] binding them Oh once same to the other
[27:00] are you ready for this
[27:02] oh say I'm ready how about you say
[27:04] brother I am ready I ready to face this
[27:06] I am ready
[27:07] I prayed oh brother oh praise God I am
[27:10] also prayed up we are going to go
[27:12] through it anyhow we shall not live if
[27:14] we have to die for this course wish I
[27:16] died to praise God little did they know
[27:20] praise be to God the God Himself was
[27:23] getting ready for them and when they put
[27:27] them in the fiery furnace not other than
[27:29] the book I did I himself stood on his
[27:31] feet he said did we not country three
[27:34] people to the furnace where I see the
[27:36] fourth passing whose countenance is like
[27:40] the Son of God praise be to God and what
[27:44] were they doing they were just walking
[27:46] in the finish walking the world they
[27:48] were just walking and praising God when
[27:53] you are prayed up when you are prayer of
[27:58] let the will of God be done
[28:02] desperation desperation will draw you
[28:07] closer to God and as I said already
[28:11] where it sends you far away from God
[28:13] it's not an indication that that is the
[28:16] end of life it's not an indication that
[28:18] you're not a child of God
[28:19] what it means is that you are not
[28:21] standing on the rock you are standing on
[28:24] a sinking saying take heed where you are
[28:29] standing take heed examine yourself
[28:32] praise be to God in case you're
[28:39] interested in the story are you guys
[28:41] know it already is Daniel 3:17 about
[28:45] meshach Shadrach and Abednego yes so I
[28:49] think I have enough time to put in one
[28:56] one item so remember Fotis factors that
[29:03] would draw you that would cause you to
[29:06] be desperate in your prayer life with
[29:09] God sometimes we don't have to wait till
[29:16] we get there but the human nature is
[29:19] that when there is nothing happening we
[29:23] are relaxed as I said last week if we
[29:29] will give ourselves to prayer and then
[29:32] pray and seek the face of God there are
[29:34] certain situations that won't even come
[29:36] away at all but a child of God God is
[29:43] going to bring you in one way or the
[29:45] order because you must bear fruits let
[29:50] me see if I can put this in
[29:54] having the smell of divine judgment can
[29:58] also cause a storm can create
[30:01] desperation to smell divine judgment
[30:05] coming your way before the judgment of
[30:15] God comes God would fall on you
[30:21] Jaguars will not just fall upon you from
[30:24] from just out of the blues God is going
[30:27] to fall on you sometimes once sometimes
[30:30] twice sometimes three sometimes four
[30:33] times sometimes forever how many times
[30:37] nobody knows that God would forewarn you
[30:43] in one way or the order just think about
[30:52] Jonah in the land of Nineveh when your
[30:59] sins came before God and God was ready
[31:01] to destroy them and he sent Jonah D away
[31:04] we know the story I'm not going to go
[31:07] into the details I remember one time
[31:09] we're talking about it in the house in
[31:10] our devotion and was it gospel or
[31:13] Emmanuel who asked now why was Jonah
[31:17] selfish I said selfish he said yes I
[31:21] said why I said when he was running away
[31:25] from God
[31:25] and they threw him into the sea and they
[31:29] will swallowed him he prayed for God to
[31:32] have mercy on him and he wanted God to
[31:35] destroy the city of Nineveh I said oh I
[31:38] get it now
[31:41] yes when he cried again the city of
[31:45] Nineveh for yer evil and from the king
[31:51] to the seventh and not only the human
[31:54] beings that King issued a decree that
[31:59] nobody was going to Reno but was going
[32:01] to eat and even the animals were not
[32:05] going to eat they would not drink human
[32:09] beasts and their animals had to fast to
[32:13] seek the face of God praise be to God
[32:16] why because the judgment of God was
[32:20] coming their way
[32:21] it drove them into desperation they sat
[32:24] in such close the certain ashes and they
[32:27] sought the face of God
[32:29] in desperation and the Bible says God
[32:33] was pleased and it repented God that the
[32:41] judgment of God was paid you can be in a
[32:49] condition you can be doing this you know
[32:51] out of the will of God how does God want
[32:55] his children you come to the church the
[33:00] pastor preaches he goes right there is
[33:03] the voice of God coming to you you can
[33:05] take your Bible to read and then from
[33:08] nowhere something catches your attention
[33:10] is the Word of God coming to you you can
[33:12] you can be outside there somebody you
[33:14] don't even know God can use people on
[33:18] the different different situations to
[33:21] get to you and it is the voice of God
[33:25] praise be to God
[33:28] yes so I just have three teens here I
[33:32] think I have to lower the kitchen table
[33:34] we are just a minute above your time
[33:37] praise be to God
[33:42] okay god bless you I don't know how next
[33:52] week is going to be if is the will of
[33:54] God I think to go this way when we talk
[33:58] about this because I'm away we'll be
[34:01] doing something else I'm not very sure
[34:03] how the preparation is gone so if we
[34:07] don't get to talk about this God willing
[34:09] we'll talk about it someday but just
[34:12] don't forget these things they are
[34:14] supposed to help your prayer life you
[34:18] know we have talked about prayer we have
[34:22] made it very clear sometimes you pray
[34:26] you pray sometimes you'll even get a
[34:28] time to pray as situation happens why
[34:31] you just have to speak there is no time
[34:35] to pray just pick we have talked about
[34:39] going through that and sometimes there
[34:42] is no time to pray and sometimes the
[34:46] situation just comes you know and and
[34:49] you can't even speak you have the chance
[34:52] to say just a word the name Jesus is a
[34:57] prayer praise be to God I have seen the
[35:02] name Jesus and I am a living testament
[35:04] there is no time that the name of Jesus
[35:06] is a prayer I've had a story of a child
[35:09] I was falling from the bed a very high
[35:12] bed a little baby that was just coming
[35:14] down the major the murder just shorted
[35:16] Jesus and discharges suspended in the
[35:19] air

[35:22] sometimes that you can you you can't
