[1:14:11] wanted to share with you i was talking
[1:14:14] with brother jbs kameta from
[1:14:17] from nigeria
[1:14:18] he has been here a few times and
[1:14:20] preached for us and
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:27] i think that was uh
[1:14:30] last week of zoe had a
[1:14:33] very
[1:14:35] [Music]
[1:14:36] strange experience that also turned out
[1:14:39] to be a wonderful experience i was
[1:14:42] talking with him in the week and uh
[1:14:44] there there have been a lot of uh
[1:14:47] kidnapping now now back in in nigeria
[1:14:50] this this will be the second minister
[1:14:52] in the message that have gone through
[1:14:54] that
[1:14:55] uh the first one uh uh spent a lot of
[1:14:58] plays and and and those guys who you
[1:15:01] know were keeping up these preachers and
[1:15:03] asked for ransom you know asked for
[1:15:05] money
[1:15:06] and uh and he had that experience he
[1:15:09] went back to to visit uh
[1:15:12] a little work that he was doing and you
[1:15:14] know and he got kidnapped by these guys
[1:15:18] but the thing about it there is that he
[1:15:20] said
[1:15:21] you know they drove him around
[1:15:23] for
[1:15:26] so many hours in a day
[1:15:28] but he had his
[1:15:30] his music playing in the vehicle
[1:15:33] and
[1:15:34] i think pretty soon they came to realize
[1:15:36] that he was a preacher
[1:15:38] so uh
[1:15:41] and he said he was just sitting in the
[1:15:42] back of the vehicle thinking uh
[1:15:45] you know
[1:15:47] my law delivered down here you know my
[1:15:49] law will deliver me you know
[1:15:52] and
[1:15:53] while those guys drove him around on
[1:15:55] their operation they were yeah i mean
[1:15:58] they were carrying on some horrible
[1:15:59] things but yet they had a preacher with
[1:16:01] with them praise the lord
[1:16:04] amen and then at the end of the day one
[1:16:08] of them spoke up and said let's let's

[1:27:59] beginning it shows what has been placed
[1:28:02] in the earth
[1:28:03] amen and revelation he hates revelation
[1:28:06] because revelation
[1:28:08] shows his end amen shows that he
[1:28:11] and the false prophet will be thrown
[1:28:13] into the lake of fire you ought to be
[1:28:15] happy about that tonight

[1:28:27] uh two verses
[1:28:29] by the help of the lord then we go to
[1:28:31] revelation
[1:28:32] 2.

[1:28:56] tonight
[1:28:57] genesis
[1:28:58] 2 and verse
[1:29:00] 15
[1:29:03] and it reads
[1:29:05] and the lord god
[1:29:07] commanded the man sin of every tree of
[1:29:10] the garden
[1:29:13] thou mays freely eat
[1:29:15] in other words there's no limitation
[1:29:18] but of the tree of knowledge
[1:29:21] of good
[1:29:22] and evil
[1:29:24] that shall not eat of it
[1:29:27] for in the day that thou eateth thereof
[1:29:31] thou shall
[1:29:32] surely
[1:29:34] die
[1:29:35] if that's right
[1:29:36] now let's go to revelation
[1:29:39] the second chapter
[1:29:53] revelation
[1:29:56] 2
[1:30:00] and verse 7
[1:30:02] and it reads
[1:30:04] he that has an ear how many thank god
[1:30:06] you got to ear tonight
[1:30:09] let him hear
[1:30:11] and we know we have to be predestinated
[1:30:13] to hear
[1:30:14] the prophet god says it's impossible for
[1:30:17] all to hear
[1:30:19] amen amen
[1:30:20] i'm not talking about the ear
[1:30:22] on the side of your face but you have a
[1:30:24] heart to hear tonight he that has an ear
[1:30:29] let him hear what the spirit said unto
[1:30:31] the churches
[1:30:32] to him that overcometh
[1:30:35] will i give to eat of the tree of life
[1:30:38] which is in the midst
[1:30:40] of paradise of god
[1:30:43] amen let us buy our heads father

[1:31:10] i feel wonderful tonight
[1:31:12] it's good when you could come to church
[1:31:15] and when you enter the threshold
[1:31:18] and you can feel the presence of the
[1:31:19] lord it's it's wonderful you ought to be
[1:31:22] happy tonight to know that the lord is
[1:31:25] with us amen
[1:31:26] and he's keeping us amen a little
[1:31:29] thought tonight by the grace of god
[1:31:32] a reward
[1:31:33] amen a promise
[1:31:35] reward
[1:31:37] a promised reward
[1:31:39] and we look at the word a reward
[1:31:43] is a thing that's that a thing that give
[1:31:46] recognition
[1:31:47] of one service
[1:31:50] effort
[1:31:51] or achievement
[1:31:54] so the promise was only given
[1:31:57] to overcomers
[1:31:58] you find in the bible
[1:32:00] that god made promise amen amen to every
[1:32:04] age
[1:32:06] and listen at some of the promise
[1:32:09] he promised the eat of the tree of life
[1:32:13] he promised that
[1:32:15] they will not be heard of the second
[1:32:17] death
[1:32:18] he promised to eat of the hidden manna
[1:32:22] and i would give
[1:32:23] you the white stone at a new name
[1:32:28] he give us he promised power over
[1:32:31] nations
[1:32:32] he promised uh we shall be closed in
[1:32:36] white remnant
[1:32:37] and i will not blot out his name
[1:32:40] out of the book of life
[1:32:42] but will confess his name before my
[1:32:45] father
[1:32:46] and before his angel
[1:32:48] and he goes on to say and i will keep
[1:32:51] thee
[1:32:52] from the hour
[1:32:54] of temptation which shall come upon the
[1:32:58] world to try them
[1:33:00] that dwelleth upon the earth
[1:33:03] and we found out
[1:33:05] amen that
[1:33:06] the god that we serve tonight
[1:33:09] i'm happy to know that
[1:33:11] god is not a man
[1:33:14] that he shall lie amen
[1:33:17] can somebody say amen
[1:33:19] neither is he the son of man amen that
[1:33:21] he shall repent amen i believe it was
[1:33:24] balaam uh uh that told baylike look god
[1:33:28] is not a man that he is your life amen
[1:33:30] and when god make promise god is
[1:33:32] obligated to keep his promise
[1:33:35] and you're happy about it tonight
[1:33:38] to him that overcometh revelation two
[1:33:40] and seven to him that overcometh what i
[1:33:42] get to eat of the tree of life which is
[1:33:45] in the midst of paradise of god
[1:33:48] this is a future reward to all
[1:33:51] overcomers of all ages when the last
[1:33:55] call the battle has sounded and our
[1:33:58] armor has been laid down
[1:34:00] then we arrest in paradise of god
[1:34:04] and our portion shall be the tree
[1:34:08] of life forever that's beautiful tonight
[1:34:11] yes
[1:34:13] you know i i i think of what is talking
[1:34:16] about god make all these promises
[1:34:19] to him that overcometh
[1:34:22] uh
[1:34:23] i will grant to
[1:34:24] sit with me in my throne
[1:34:27] you know we all desire to lord let me be
[1:34:30] an overcomer i desire to be an overcomer
[1:34:34] he that overcometh will eat of the
[1:34:37] hidden man god can't lie
[1:34:39] god made a promise he that overcometh
[1:34:42] will you know he made all these promises
[1:34:45] so god is obligated to keep all of his
[1:34:48] promise
[1:34:49] but it reminds me of you know when god
[1:34:52] make his promise a lot of time you know
[1:34:55] matthew i think the seventh chapter and
[1:34:57] verse 20 something like that the bible
[1:35:00] let us know that there there's going to
[1:35:02] be many
[1:35:03] that we're going to come we'll come up
[1:35:05] to him in that day and so lord
[1:35:08] did not we cast out devils did not we
[1:35:10] did many mighty works we we we we did
[1:35:13] this and we did that yeah and somebody
[1:35:16] said lord out i was paid for the church
[1:35:18] and i did this and lord i i paid my
[1:35:21] tithes and and all this but he going to
[1:35:24] say i never knew you
[1:35:27] depart from me your workers of iniquity
[1:35:30] and it's good to know the promise that
[1:35:34] god would make amen to us and it reminds
[1:35:37] me of one that is buying a home or
[1:35:42] you're buying an automobile
[1:35:44] and and you know i i could see this
[1:35:47] family you know perching
[1:35:49] sitting down uh signing the contract to
[1:35:53] to get this new home you're so happy and
[1:35:56] sometimes you so happy until you don't
[1:35:58] even realize hey man the small prince
[1:36:03] oh then you know you so happy to have
[1:36:05] this two-story house this house on the
[1:36:07] hill you know beside the lakes and
[1:36:10] little ducks
[1:36:11] you're just looking at uh the floor plan
[1:36:13] you're not really looking at the fine
[1:36:16] prints
[1:36:17] and that's the way it is a lot of people
[1:36:20] that said i'm going in the rapture but
[1:36:22] the rapture is only given to the
[1:36:23] overcomers
[1:36:25] he that overcomes that's right and first
[1:36:28] of all you in order to sit with him you
[1:36:31] have to overcome
[1:36:33] that's right
[1:36:34] and a lot of people will be disappointed
[1:36:37] you know and they would buy this home
[1:36:39] and not realizing in small prints you
[1:36:42] know with this home or
[1:36:46] will the mortgage be met when i'm sick
[1:36:49] or uh what have you or i'm out of work
[1:36:52] will will this mortgage continue to be
[1:36:54] paid well they don't read all that they
[1:36:57] just signed the contract and that's the
[1:36:59] way there's a lot of people where they
[1:37:00] come amen they grab hold to this gospel
[1:37:03] ply and they they're out in the hot
[1:37:05] field and the trials and the temptations
[1:37:08] come you gotta say lord i'm still with
[1:37:11] really to go all the way
[1:37:13] amen amen and i thank god tonight amen
[1:37:17] he that overcometh will i grant to sit
[1:37:21] with me
[1:37:22] in my throne and we know that the
[1:37:24] prophet said that a throne amen
[1:37:28] it rules and you rang your throne is
[1:37:30] over domain that's right he that

[1:39:08] just sitting there and just looking at
[1:39:09] her beautiful dull eyes and he's just
[1:39:11] saying being hypnotized i'll do all this
[1:39:14] for you
[1:39:15] all this for you and all of a sudden
[1:39:17] daddy walking through the house and time
[1:39:20] is getting late and all of a sudden
[1:39:21] father go
[1:39:24] and she said johnny
[1:39:25] it's time for you to go he said i
[1:39:27] promise
[1:39:28] he said i promise i'll be faithful he
[1:39:31] said i promise i'll always be with you
[1:39:34] and so he began to leave and say
[1:39:37] he said i'll be back
[1:39:39] he said i promise i'll come back
[1:39:40] tomorrow
[1:39:41] if it don't rain
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:45] now he just made a promise he won't let
[1:39:47] nothing stop him but now he's letting
[1:39:49] rain
[1:39:51] stop him
[1:39:54] and i'm afraid
[1:39:55] in this christian journey we we make all
[1:39:58] these promises but i thank god god is
[1:40:01] not basing amen his work on my promise
[1:40:05] can god know that i'm filled with faults
[1:40:07] and failure
[1:40:08] but he's basing it on what he did at
[1:40:11] calvary hallelujah glory to god
[1:40:14] hallelujah how many love the lord
[1:40:16] tonight
[1:40:17] and
[1:40:18] and god
[1:40:20] made these promises amen and the tree of
[1:40:23] life the prophet of god said isn't that
[1:40:25] a beautiful figure of speech
[1:40:28] it is mentioned three times in the book
[1:40:30] of genesis and three times in the book
[1:40:33] of revelation all
[1:40:34] six places is the same tree symbolizing
[1:40:39] exactly the same thing
[1:40:41] now in the garden
[1:40:43] there were two
[1:40:44] trees
[1:40:46] are y'all hearing me amen there was two
[1:40:48] trees now there was other trees but
[1:40:50] there's two trees in particular
[1:40:53] standing in the midst of it
[1:40:56] one was a tree of life
[1:40:59] and the other was a tree of knowledge
[1:41:02] good and evil
[1:41:03] man was to live by the tree of life but
[1:41:06] he was not to touch the other tree
[1:41:10] or he would die
[1:41:12] but man did partake of the other tree
[1:41:16] and when he did death
[1:41:18] entered into him
[1:41:20] by his sin
[1:41:22] and he became separated
[1:41:25] from god
[1:41:27] now i would like to demonstrate
[1:41:29] something tonight you know picture is a
[1:41:32] thousand words
[1:41:34] but the one would it be okay here
[1:41:36] because i don't want to damage the
[1:41:37] flower can i just can i put it over here
[1:41:40] i want to use these two objects tonight
[1:41:43] by the grace of god
[1:41:44] and and if you spiritually pretty much
[1:41:46] know where i'm going
[1:41:48] i want the deal tonight
[1:41:51] in the garden
[1:41:52] there was two trees
[1:41:54] and god
[1:41:55] uh commanded his children not which
[1:41:58] treats to eat of
[1:42:01] that's right
[1:42:02] now i want you to realize that when when
[1:42:05] god made man
[1:42:07] he put
[1:42:09] adam in the garden what was the purpose
[1:42:11] he put adam in the garden to address it
[1:42:14] and substitute it and there was to bring
[1:42:17] forth our children and we know it was
[1:42:20] not by the wound of a body but it was by
[1:42:23] the wound of his mouth
[1:42:25] because that she wants to speak children
[1:42:27] into existence that's right
[1:42:29] well the bible let us know that there
[1:42:32] was two trees in the garden
[1:42:34] and god told them now look the tree
[1:42:38] of
[1:42:39] knowledge
[1:42:41] of good and evil y'all help me out oh
[1:42:43] blue i love blue so
[1:42:44] you blue
[1:42:46] blue's my favorite color amen
[1:42:49] amen and
[1:42:51] the tree of life
[1:42:54] and the tree of knowledge good
[1:42:56] and evil
[1:42:57] now i want you to realize that when he
[1:43:00] told them uh not to eat of that tree of
[1:43:04] knowledge good and evil the day you eat
[1:43:06] the earth or the day you partake of that
[1:43:09] tree what you shall what
[1:43:13] surely die amen yeah you're gonna die
[1:43:16] so those two trees it's in the garden
[1:43:19] so
[1:43:20] i don't want you to realize this now
[1:43:22] adam and and
[1:43:24] and his wife
[1:43:26] they
[1:43:27] they were now you know first of all
[1:43:28] genesis 1 that adam was made in the very
[1:43:31] image of god right god is a spirit
[1:43:34] that's right so adam was in the image of
[1:43:36] god genesis 2
[1:43:37] god put man to sleep made man from the
[1:43:39] dust of the ground so i want you to
[1:43:41] realize that the two trees in the garden
[1:43:44] and god sought his dear children in the
[1:43:47] garden
[1:43:48] and he signed them up on a free more age
[1:43:52] where they can make a choice he gave
[1:43:54] them a mind to thank they could make a
[1:43:56] choice of glory to god amen
[1:44:00] glory to god
[1:44:01] god want them to have the right to
[1:44:04] choose evil good well it taught him out
[1:44:07] in the garden and
[1:44:09] and
[1:44:10] and adam and his wife was in the garden
[1:44:13] and i want you to realize that
[1:44:16] the the tree
[1:44:17] of
[1:44:18] life brother brown let us know
[1:44:21] that the tree of life jesus said i am
[1:44:24] the tree of life he talked about he was
[1:44:27] the one that walked in the midst of
[1:44:28] paradise that's right
[1:44:30] i am the bread but he talked about the
[1:44:33] tree of evil that's right well now we
[1:44:36] know the two trees in the garden
[1:44:38] now
[1:44:39] they was to eat up that tree and live
[1:44:42] and have eternal life
[1:44:44] oh glory to god
[1:44:45] how many you realize that those trees
[1:44:48] two trees are here today
[1:44:52] now uh pastor do you have that up there
[1:44:55] yes
[1:44:56] can you put it up now
[1:44:57] praise the lord and i want you to
[1:44:59] realize
[1:45:01] that adam
[1:45:02] and his wife
[1:45:04] they they was made of 16 elements of the
[1:45:07] earth if that's right i know you know
[1:45:09] those things but it's good to remind us
[1:45:11] sometimes
[1:45:12] it was made of what light petroleum
[1:45:14] potash iron clay 16 elements of the
[1:45:17] earth
[1:45:18] right and and and when god made them and
[1:45:21] the first thing when god made paul talk
[1:45:24] about it in thessalonian i think four or
[1:45:26] five and he talked about the body the
[1:45:30] spirit and the soul
[1:45:32] so we realized that when god made man
[1:45:34] the first thing god made was a soul
[1:45:37] that's right and from the soul god made
[1:45:40] what
[1:45:42] a spirit then god makes a body and the
[1:45:46] bible let us know that man became a
[1:45:49] living soul that's right tonight
[1:45:52] so when god made man he gave man a
[1:45:55] choice amen just like we have a choice
[1:45:57] tonight
[1:45:58] you know if
[1:45:59] lord i'm going to do better you got a
[1:46:01] choice yeah uh the the way i come in i
[1:46:04] i'm i'm going back different
[1:46:06] i i'm i'm i'm going to live a better
[1:46:08] life i got a choice that's right that's
[1:46:11] right i i i'm going to be come this this
[1:46:14] year i'm not going away a lot of people
[1:46:16] believe in turning over new leaves
[1:46:18] resolution and they find out next year
[1:46:21] to do the same thing i ain't going to
[1:46:22] wait till the first year i want to do it
[1:46:24] tonight
[1:46:25] lord change me
[1:46:27] lord i got some attitude that i need to
[1:46:29] be worked on i know i can't go like this
[1:46:32] the lord changed me you got a choice
[1:46:35] you got a choice you could eat of the
[1:46:37] tree of life and live or you could
[1:46:39] reasoning with the tree of knowledge
[1:46:42] good and evil somebody say amen
[1:46:45] well when god made man and they made the
[1:46:48] woman and we know and now i want you to
[1:46:51] realize
[1:46:52] that uh they're in the garden
[1:46:56] this serpent brother brandon talk about
[1:46:58] this serpent
[1:47:00] now
[1:47:01] one thing about satan when he he works
[1:47:03] on us and he studies us
[1:47:06] he's trying he studies your weak point
[1:47:09] lord knows don't we have them huh
[1:47:12] and and the devil studies your weak
[1:47:13] points so you know uh i'm sure that
[1:47:17] uh uh
[1:47:18] uh satan knew that he couldn't overthrow
[1:47:21] adam so he had to get the byproduct
[1:47:24] that's right
[1:47:25] so he began to study this woman and he
[1:47:28] began to talk y'all don't let the devil
[1:47:30] talk to you now i'm not just talking
[1:47:32] about physical natural woman but we are
[1:47:34] the bride of jesus christ that's right
[1:47:36] are you with me so when you see a woman
[1:47:38] you talk about the church we are the
[1:47:40] church we are the call out we are the
[1:47:42] elected lady we're going into rapture
[1:47:44] and that's right
[1:47:45] and praise god so here's satan amen hear
[1:47:50] this beast walking in the garden
[1:47:53] brother browner talk about he was just
[1:47:56] as harmless as he could be
[1:47:59] walking through the garden
[1:48:01] just minding his business just walking
[1:48:03] through the garden
[1:48:05] the bible let us know that the serpent
[1:48:07] genesis 3 i think the bible said that
[1:48:09] the serpent was more subtle
[1:48:11] than any beast of the field here here's
[1:48:13] this suffering just walking through the
[1:48:15] garden you know just walking this just
[1:48:17] walking
[1:48:19] that's all you're doing just walking and
[1:48:20] all of a sudden
[1:48:22] lucifer he he lost in heaven
[1:48:26] how many know he been kicked out micah
[1:48:27] kick it kick him out of heaven and
[1:48:30] that's what we need to do sometimes kick
[1:48:31] him out
[1:48:33] so lucifer come down on earth and jesus
[1:48:35] told his disciples i beheld him as light
[1:48:37] and fall from heaven i saw him when he
[1:48:39] hit the ground
[1:48:41] so he's walking on the earth now he's
[1:48:43] trying to figure out how can i get into
[1:48:46] the human race
[1:48:48] how can i stop man
[1:48:50] he saw out of moving things around and
[1:48:52] he wanted to interrupt that
[1:48:55] so
[1:48:56] here's this woman in the garden walking
[1:48:58] and you know she had she could move
[1:49:00] things too yeah
[1:49:02] ma can you imagine can you imagine she's
[1:49:05] looking with adam and she said you know
[1:49:06] i want those flowers
[1:49:08] over there
[1:49:10] i don't think she got to say flower over
[1:49:12] there
[1:49:16] she had it she had a spoken word amen
[1:49:20] but we are word made flesh
[1:49:24] see we we have the same you have the
[1:49:26] same ability glory to god
[1:49:29] it's not coming it has been restored
[1:49:33] glory to god man i i i'm speaking to
[1:49:36] believers here tonight now i i know i'm
[1:49:38] not just speaking to anybody i'm
[1:49:40] speaking to those that come from the
[1:49:42] very mind of god and i'm speaking to
[1:49:44] those that's going back with him i'm
[1:49:46] speaking to those amen the devil can't
[1:49:49] starve you for nothing
[1:49:51] you're bound for the rapture you're
[1:49:53] going in the rapture you are certified
[1:49:56] you come from god and you're going back
[1:49:58] to god
[1:50:00] hallelujah so so satan began to this
[1:50:04] this beast is walking through the god
[1:50:05] you know how sometimes you you come to
[1:50:07] church and you you you're gonna have a
[1:50:09] good time and all of a sudden you walk
[1:50:11] in and all of a sudden you get a bad
[1:50:13] taste in your mouth anybody ever been
[1:50:15] there
[1:50:16] and and you just don't feel like worship
[1:50:18] tonight
[1:50:20] i just don't feel like it
[1:50:22] i just i did you know i had a rough day
[1:50:25] pastor just don't know what i'm going
[1:50:26] through
[1:50:27] he don't know i have had a rough day you
[1:50:30] don't know what he's going through
[1:50:33] see but that's why when we come in the
[1:50:35] house of the lord you need to zero
[1:50:38] everything out
[1:50:40] and put your mind on the lord
[1:50:42] take your troubles
[1:50:44] and bring them to the altar and leave
[1:50:46] them there look devil i'm not gonna let
[1:50:48] you steal my joy tonight
[1:50:50] i come for my healing tonight and i'm
[1:50:53] going to get my healing tonight i i got
[1:50:55] a mind battle and i'm going back i'm
[1:50:58] going to have a piece of mind
[1:50:59] the bible declared i am the god that
[1:51:02] keepeth thee amen he said i'm able to
[1:51:04] keep thee from all
[1:51:07] i'm able to keep thee
[1:51:09] and our god cannot lie
[1:51:12] so
[1:51:13] he perhaps walking into god and satan
[1:51:17] satan begins to study and i'm sure it
[1:51:19] didn't happen it took a while he studies
[1:51:22] us you know he you know he studies you
[1:51:25] and you know if you kind of slow fall
[1:51:28] you know by coming to church he'll tell
[1:51:30] you you know you tired tonight
[1:51:33] why don't you get you some rest
[1:51:35] you know you you shouldn't just wait
[1:51:37] another night you know you tired you
[1:51:39] know but if you love the lord he can't
[1:51:41] tell you that
[1:51:43] huh
[1:51:44] yeah the devil used to tell me you tired
[1:51:47] i said you alive i'm not tired
[1:51:50] i said you must be tired trying to pass
[1:51:52] me
[1:51:53] and no you can't get me
[1:51:55] so i said i'm not tired when i'm in the
[1:51:57] presence of lord your joy
[1:51:59] you know it's a saturday night it's
[1:52:01] snowing on that side it's cold but it's
[1:52:04] warm in my heart when i could just get

[1:52:24] adam will y'all let me preach this
[1:52:26] tonight he just couldn't walk up on adam

[1:52:30] made in the very image of god out of
[1:52:32] moving things around he said i can't
[1:52:35] mess with him so he had to watch the buy
[1:52:37] product

[2:16:49] world and go live in it
[2:16:51] i mean if you want to create jupiter
[2:16:53] mars brothers that's what he said now if
[2:16:55] you want to create jupiter mars and blue
[2:16:57] told to create it
[2:17:00] you don't have to be down create you
[2:17:01] know i preached that one day and i was
[2:17:04] out with a few months ago
[2:17:06] and a brother told me he said brother
[2:17:08] children i was battered well when i
[2:17:10] preached that that old devil
[2:17:12] that odell will come and try me brother
[2:17:13] one i love when he tried me on what i

[2:17:17] i mean i hit him
[2:17:19] well i went to work monday morning amen
[2:17:22] and i create i said i believe that you
[2:17:24] have the power because when you eat of
[2:17:26] the tree of life
[2:17:28] you could be positive yeah it depends on
[2:17:31] what what you eat what you eat you
[2:17:33] become why why revelation 8 i read
[2:17:36] revelation 10 8 uh revelation 11. john
[2:17:39] types of bride what john was told to do
[2:17:41] eat the book

[2:17:49] amen and when you eat it it's going to
[2:17:50] be sweet in your mouth
[2:17:53] yeah it's good but persecution come
[2:17:56] behind that but let me tell you what
[2:17:57] church i'm going to keep on eating the
[2:17:59] book
[2:18:01] it's going to be sweet in my mouth glory
[2:18:03] to god i feel like preaching tonight hey
[2:18:06] look it's going to be sweet in my mind
[2:18:08] cause uh you got the spoken word which
[2:18:11] is the original seed
[2:18:14] somebody said you might have small to be
[2:18:16] talking big you should have seen jesus
[2:18:19] about 130 pounds amen when pilate you
[2:18:22] don't have look don't hold your head
[2:18:24] down he said do you know i have power to
[2:18:26] crucify you or i could have you released
[2:18:29] and when jesus jesus had his head down
[2:18:31] but jesus looked up with those majestic
[2:18:34] eyes and
[2:18:36] historically said when he looked in the
[2:18:37] eyes of pilate the governor he had to
[2:18:40] drop his head why because he looked in
[2:18:42] the eyes of eternity and that's the old
[2:18:45] glory and that's the way you need to do
[2:18:47] it when the devil talked to you looking
[2:18:49] right in the eyes
[2:18:52] look that sickness right in the eye say
[2:18:54] with this strife i am here

[2:57:25] there have never been a time
[2:57:28] that we come
[2:57:30] even sometimes when when we come here as
[2:57:33] brothers to pray
[2:57:35] maybe two or three persons there's never
[2:57:38] been a time
[2:57:40] that the lord has not met us here
[2:57:44] you know sometimes people get angry and
[2:57:46] says oh i didn't yet about a service
[2:57:49] you know one of my
[2:57:51] the glorious meetings i ever had
[2:57:55] was 2004

[2:58:01] we we just we just we were just we just
[2:58:04] went on a transit visa
[2:58:06] but the brother kind of trapped us into
[2:58:09] an entire week program
[2:58:11] [Music]
[2:58:12] my brother and my sibling daily
[2:58:15] five days we have over 24 services
[2:58:21] they were not playing meetings from one
[2:58:23] service it was just a phone call to the
[2:58:25] next village
[2:58:28] [Music]
[2:58:29] it was
[2:58:30] three services everywhere we went i
[2:58:32] started the service
[2:58:34] i preached the second service he come
[2:58:35] preach the terror service i moved to the
[2:58:37] next village
[2:58:38] where i got the strength from i still
[2:58:40] asked myself where did i got that
[2:58:42] strength from
[2:58:43] praise the lord i can't even preach two
[2:58:45] servants i almost want to die
[2:58:48] you know but
[2:58:51] all the law asks us is just to be
[2:58:53] available
[2:58:55] praise the lord
[2:58:56] god knows that you can never be prepared
[2:58:59] he just want you to be available
[2:59:02] that that scriptural word
[2:59:04] yell yourself
[2:59:06] it means be available
[2:59:08] that all just be available just be
[2:59:10] willing that's all you want
[2:59:13] just be willing to worship
[2:59:16] just be willing to receive
[2:59:18] just make yourself available
[2:59:21] we come with all this technicality in
[2:59:24] our mind we got to make ourselves ready
[2:59:27] and sometimes the strange thing people
[2:59:29] take those thoughts
[2:59:32] and when it's communion service they say
[2:59:34] well i'm not prepared
[2:59:36] how prepared can you get
[2:59:37] [Music]
[2:59:40] how prepared can you get you see that's
[2:59:42] the reason why he never even tell us
[2:59:44] what would be the day of the rapture
[2:59:46] because you will wait for that day to
[2:59:47] get prepared
[2:59:50] how prepared can you get
