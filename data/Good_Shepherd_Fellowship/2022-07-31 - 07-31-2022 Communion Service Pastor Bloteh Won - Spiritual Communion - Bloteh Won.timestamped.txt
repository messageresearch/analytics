[44:18] this is something i've i spoke on some
[44:20] time ago but i want to i just want to
[44:22] bring in
[44:24] [Music]
[44:35] first psalm in chapter four
[44:44] let's read from verse three
[44:47] and when the people will come into the
[44:49] camp the elders of israel say wherefore
[44:52] have the laws making us be
[44:54] us today before the philistines let us
[44:56] fetch the act of the covenant of the
[44:59] lord out of shalom
[45:01] unto us that when a comment
[45:04] among us it may save us
[45:07] uh it may save us out of the hands of
[45:09] our enemy
[45:11] so the people sent to shallow that they
[45:13] might bring
[45:19] okay
[45:26] is that a problem
[45:31] okay
[45:34] verse 4 saw the people sent to shallow
[45:36] that they my brain
[45:38] from dance the act of the covenant of
[45:40] the lord of hosts which dwelleth between
[45:42] the cherubians
[45:44] and the two sons of elah
[45:53] okay
[45:56] and the two sons of eli
[45:59] hobnard and finney has
[46:01] were there with the act of the covenant
[46:04] of god and when the act of the covenant
[46:06] of the lord came into the camp all
[46:09] israel shouted with a great shout
[46:12] so that the earth
[46:15] reigns again
[46:17] praise the lord
[46:20] verse
[46:21] seven
[46:24] oh let's let's continue to read from
[46:25] verse six it will help us and when the
[46:28] philistine hear the noise of the shout
[46:30] it said what meaning the noise
[46:33] of this will shout in the camp
[46:37] of the hebrew
[46:39] and the understood that the arc of the
[46:42] lord was come into the camp and the
[46:45] philistines were afraid
[46:47] for they said god is come
[46:51] into the camp and they say a war on us
[46:55] for me there have not been such a thing
[46:58] ever
[47:00] praise the lord
[47:01] amen
[47:03] let us pray father
[47:05] we will ask you blessing upon the word
[47:07] now and we just ask the lord god you
[47:10] will
[47:10] bless this portion of the service in
[47:12] jesus name amen
[47:15] baby the lord bless you may have a seat
[47:22] praise the lord okay i think it's much
[47:25] better
[47:34] now tonight i said i was going to to
[47:38] talk on the importance of the
[47:40] uh the three
[47:42] arguments of the new testament church
[47:45] water baptizing
[47:47] communion and food washing man i would
[47:49] not be able to go
[47:54] okay
[47:56] okay
[47:57] now i will not be able to go into uh
[48:01] everything that i have tonight not to
[48:02] keep you long
[48:04] but i want i want to go this way uh uh i
[48:07] think sometime back we we spoke a little
[48:10] bit on the the the shout of the king
[48:13] in the camp
[48:15] now uh uh we just read the scripture
[48:18] where the they brought brother act of
[48:19] the covenant in the camp of israel and
[48:22] the people shouted
[48:24] and even the philistine school
[48:25] identified by thou shalt
[48:28] that
[48:29] that the lord god was in the camp of
[48:31] israel
[48:33] praise the lord
[48:34] amen
[48:35] that the lord god was in the camp of
[48:37] israel
[48:38] now
[48:38] and and speaking on that we were able to
[48:41] identify by scripture
[48:43] that israel had
[48:46] five supernatural things by the
[48:48] scripture and also by the message of the
[48:50] hour there were five supernatural things
[48:52] that accompanied israel
[48:56] praise the lord
[48:59] they had the act of the coveting now we
[49:01] just read it by the act of the covenant
[49:03] that was one of the spiritual things
[49:05] that they had
[49:06] and
[49:07] they had uh
[49:09] the smitten rock
[49:12] the raqqa uh the moses struck
[49:16] a god's instruction
[49:17] and a broth for water
[49:20] paul
[49:21] who allude to that in the book of
[49:23] corinthians says the rock that followed
[49:25] israel
[49:28] in the wilderness was christ
[49:31] praise the lord
[49:33] so israel had
[49:35] the ark of the covenant they had
[49:38] the smitten rock
[49:40] they had the brazen serpent
[49:42] praise the lord
[49:44] they had uh
[49:47] a vindicated prophet
[49:52] and there's a fifth one
[49:57] what would that be
[50:00] yes they have the pillar of fire
[50:02] that's right that was the fifth thing
[50:04] they had the pillar of fire will will
[50:07] become
[50:08] fire by night and cloud by day praise
[50:12] the lord
[50:13] okay those were the five
[50:16] supernatural things that israel had
[50:20] now god equipped his people
[50:23] by giving them these things praise the
[50:26] lord
[50:27] the the
[50:29] the
[50:31] and because these things were in the
[50:33] camera of israel they all had their
[50:36] representation what they meant to to the
[50:39] wilderness church
[50:41] we will look at it a little bit
[50:43] and uh
[50:45] [Music]
[50:47] you realize that
[50:49] these were just
[50:50] uh
[50:52] jacob and his family households sevens
[50:54] that went down to egypt
[50:56] they stayed there and and they grew to
[50:58] be just this small group of people
[51:00] so they were not uh uh mighty i mean
[51:03] they never even had an army they were
[51:05] just a group of people there were there
[51:07] were seven slaves there in egypt
[51:10] and just at the time of the exeter god
[51:13] came down and he spoke to moses we know
[51:16] the story then he commissioned moses to
[51:18] go and get his people out into the land
[51:21] of promise they will stop the adjoining
[51:24] and then god will now
[51:27] uh equip his people he will he will he
[51:29] will come about them with these five
[51:32] supernatural things
[51:34] praise the lord now you will you will
[51:37] realize that
[51:39] uh
[51:41] beside what paul said in the book of
[51:44] corinthians that the rock that followed
[51:46] them was christ
[51:48] there is nowhere that is uh uh you know
[51:51] is written in the scripture that the
[51:53] rock was rolling and following them
[51:58] right
[51:59] praise the lord
[52:00] amen paul only said that to be able to
[52:05] help us to see
[52:07] the significance
[52:10] praise the lord
[52:12] to be for us to be able to see the
[52:14] significance of those elements that
[52:17] we're giving them i mean
[52:19] not seeing the significance not seeing
[52:21] the importance of it is is uh it's easy
[52:25] for the people to idolize it like we
[52:27] said on wednesday night
[52:29] praise the lord
[52:30] we also realized that the brazen serpent
[52:33] was christ
[52:35] because jesus himself pointed to death
[52:37] as moses lifted up the brazen serpent so
[52:40] the son of man will be lifted up
[52:43] praise the lord
[52:45] the pillar of fire was christ
[52:51] are we together
[52:53] amen
[52:54] and
[52:55] even the act of the covenant because
[52:57] what did they had in the act of the
[52:59] covenant they had the the tablets
[53:02] which
[53:03] was the word
[53:08] now
[53:09] so
[53:11] uh
[53:14] the prophet will help us to understand
[53:17] that when when uh uh uh
[53:22] balad brought balaam
[53:24] and he was trying to to ring curses on
[53:28] these people
[53:30] and uh and and and bilaam went on top of
[53:32] the mountain and uh brother branham
[53:34] would describe it and said that you know
[53:36] balak tried to carry him to a place
[53:38] where he would now he will be able to
[53:40] see in the camera of israel and see all
[53:43] the little easings and see the fusses
[53:45] that were going on and see you know all
[53:48] their backsliding
[53:49] try to bring this man to a place where
[53:52] he will be able to see all the
[53:54] weaknesses and based on thy weaknesses
[53:56] he will now bring down curses on the
[53:59] children of israel
[54:01] praise the lord took him to a very high
[54:03] place that he will be able to see very
[54:06] clear and as high and and as high as
[54:09] high as he went he could see nothing
[54:13] now the way brother branham described it
[54:15] brother branham said is that
[54:19] what was the pillar of fire that led
[54:21] them by night became a pillow of cloud
[54:25] that rolled behind the camera of israel
[54:28] he says the pillar of cloud wrote behind
[54:31] the camera of israel that bilaam could
[54:33] not see anything in the camp
[54:36] because god was now the covering of his
[54:39] people
[54:43] praise the lord
[54:45] now so we i i'm saying this to bring us
[54:48] to the place to realize that
[54:51] uh the one that have caught us is the
[54:54] one that keeps us
[54:58] praise the lord
[55:00] is the one that keeps us
[55:04] i know we we uh sometimes like to to to
[55:09] refer to uh
[55:10] uh
[55:11] uh king message in the book of uh uh
[55:14] genesis and say we have to be our
[55:16] brother's keeper i told somebody before
[55:18] i said king was the one that preached
[55:20] that message
[55:24] it's now scripture
[55:26] in the scripture the bible says the lord
[55:28] is our keeper
[55:32] king was the one that said am i my
[55:33] brother's keeper he was asking god
[55:40] now so what i'm trying to bring to us
[55:43] tonight for us to understand is that
[55:46] uh god did not give us his word
[55:49] as uh you know uh uh uh
[55:52] you know uh uh
[55:54] a commandment in a sense of uh uh you
[55:57] know you have to keep this word if you
[55:59] don't keep this word you know i'm going
[56:01] to blot you out and and you know uh give
[56:04] us his word as something to enslave us
[56:11] just like the scripture says no man is
[56:13] justified by the lord
[56:18] the same one that has given us his word
[56:20] his ordinance and his commandment is the
[56:23] same one that has come in the form of
[56:25] the holy spirit that dwelleth in a
[56:26] believer to keep the word
[56:34] he's a jealous god
[56:38] it's all about him
[56:42] if you take god out of the picture
[56:43] you're going to get it wrong
[56:48] we have to see him in every every every
[56:51] aspect of the picture
[56:58] praise the lord
[56:59] now so we realize that brother branham
[57:02] uh uh uh taught us and says that the uh
[57:05] the brazen serpent represented
[57:07] uh um
[57:10] divine healing amen
[57:13] so even when god
[57:15] started dealing with his people
[57:18] when he called them paul says the church
[57:20] in the wilderness
[57:21] when he called him he gave them a
[57:24] covenant of healing he established
[57:26] something in the camp
[57:29] because these people are now traveling
[57:32] adjoining the where they have never been
[57:35] before they are going through the
[57:36] wilderness
[57:40] and he is the great physician in the
[57:42] camp to be able to keep them healthy for
[57:45] them to continue this journey
[57:49] and that same god is also in our camp he
[57:52] knows that have we have never traveled
[57:54] this road before
[57:56] so he's the lord that he left us of all
[57:59] our diseases
[58:02] praise the lord
[58:07] the smitten rock that followed the turn
[58:09] of israel paul says it was
[58:12] christ
[58:15] now what jesus said
[58:17] he said
[58:18] these signs
[58:20] shall
[58:21] follow
[58:27] so the the
[58:29] the the smitten rock see the position of
[58:31] the smitten rock you i will soon get to
[58:33] where i want to get tonight
[58:35] the people were in
[58:39] they were in
[58:40] need
[58:43] it takes the place
[58:45] of
[58:47] the place where signs and wonders
[58:50] takes in
[58:52] the new testament church
[58:57] because just as the rock followed the
[58:59] people jesus says signs will follow the
[59:02] church the church do not follow signs
[59:04] but signs follow the church
[59:07] is the presence of christ he's the one
[59:09] that does the wonders in the midst of
[59:11] the people whenever we have spiritual
[59:14] needs
[59:16] now so just like the church in the
[59:18] wilderness
[59:20] god established these things among the
[59:22] people
[59:24] for us to be able to realize that
[59:27] they are more with us
[59:30] than we ourself and even them that are
[59:33] against us
[59:36] the church is is a mystical body
[59:42] praise the lord
[59:46] we can all bring our little lake of
[59:48] fires together tonight like we we have
[59:50] done we can bring our our gather all our
[59:53] faith tonight
[59:55] we need his faith
[59:57] amen amen
[59:59] we need his faith to create a hundred
[1:00:02] percent faith in this building where all
[1:00:05] things are possible
[1:00:08] it's where christ come and join to the
[1:00:10] body
[1:00:12] that's when the impossible happens
[1:00:17] so just like how the old testament
[1:00:19] church had these supernatural things
[1:00:22] that was dwelling in the camp
[1:00:29] in the in in the evening as the evening
[1:00:31] shadows are falling the the the pillar
[1:00:34] of fire move over the people and
[1:00:36] brighten the camp
[1:00:39] and israel continued their journey or if
[1:00:42] they are going to encamp and sleep and
[1:00:44] whatever they are going to do but god
[1:00:46] there with the people this way
[1:00:50] creating a
[1:00:52] a a place for the for them to have
[1:00:54] confidence in his presence
[1:01:01] praise the lord
[1:01:03] now
[1:01:04] to the new testament church
[1:01:08] jesus
[1:01:14] establishing a new covenant
[1:01:20] with his church
[1:01:23] we know
[1:01:24] uh
[1:01:25] uh
[1:01:26] the ordinance of water baptism was was
[1:01:29] given right right from uh john he
[1:01:32] started to preach repaint
[1:01:34] for the kingdom of heaven is a hand
[1:01:37] amen
[1:01:38] and he started to baptize the people for
[1:01:41] john baptized onto repentance
[1:01:43] and and then jesus came in and took the
[1:01:46] message of repentance also and started
[1:01:48] to preach out repent the kingdom of
[1:01:51] heaven is a hand
[1:01:54] now
[1:01:55] there is there is there is this thing
[1:01:57] that uh
[1:01:58] uh we we we also see it in the scripture
[1:02:01] and in the message
[1:02:03] that uh
[1:02:05] you know when when brother branham
[1:02:08] uh had a vision one time
[1:02:11] uh when he was going out in his ministry
[1:02:14] where there were there were two plans
[1:02:18] that were before him and and he broke
[1:02:22] uh a branch from each one of these
[1:02:24] plants
[1:02:25] and he was going to plant them together
[1:02:27] almost like a grifter barn he was going
[1:02:29] to graft him together
[1:02:31] and what uh and what that represent the
[1:02:34] interpretation of that uh
[1:02:38] vision
[1:02:39] it was that he was going to stand
[1:02:41] between the trinitarians and the oneness
[1:02:46] right
[1:02:47] praise the lord
[1:02:48] and he was going to bring
[1:02:50] uh uh
[1:02:52] a perfect understanding
[1:02:54] on the godhead
[1:02:58] praise the lord
[1:02:59] now so
[1:03:00] uh because there there there are people
[1:03:03] out there also that uh you know believe
[1:03:05] in uh water baptism in the name of the
[1:03:07] lord jesus christ
[1:03:09] you know the the one that does that the
[1:03:11] united pentecostal does that and and
[1:03:13] different pentecostal group that also do
[1:03:16] that
[1:03:18] now but here he said a prophet was going
[1:03:20] to come and bring and bring us a true
[1:03:23] interpretation
[1:03:25] or the the importance of what this was
[1:03:27] giving to
[1:03:29] the the the new testament church
[1:03:32] when jerome started preaching and and uh
[1:03:34] he he spoke in a sense the other the the
[1:03:38] kingdom of heaven you know uh it's unto
[1:03:40] you repent be baptized the kingdom of
[1:03:42] heaven unto you now so we realized that
[1:03:46] like brother branham says water baptism
[1:03:48] actually put the believer into the body
[1:03:54] it makes the believer is identified with
[1:03:57] both the death barrier and resurrection
[1:04:00] of jesus christ
[1:04:02] praise the lord
[1:04:03] now here is the danger also
[1:04:07] that has happened all through the church
[1:04:09] ages
[1:04:10] you realize that
[1:04:12] uh uh
[1:04:13] you know where brother branham shaves
[1:04:15] the oneness got it wrong because they
[1:04:17] were establishing something like in
[1:04:19] jesus name you know a jesus name group
[1:04:22] and they were baptized in jesus name and
[1:04:24] he says uh they were not doing it in a
[1:04:27] scriptural way because it had to be in
[1:04:29] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:04:33] praise the lord
[1:04:34] now the the the reason there also is
[1:04:38] that uh
[1:04:41] when the person is is baptized you have
[1:04:44] to know like uh uh peter said baptism
[1:04:48] give us a good conscience towards god
[1:04:51] amen
[1:04:52] it does not put away the fit of the
[1:04:54] flesh it gives us a good conscious
[1:04:55] towards god it's a commandment of the
[1:04:58] lord
[1:04:59] and in obedience to god's word he
[1:05:02] promised that he will bless us with the
[1:05:05] holy ghost
[1:05:07] so when we when we come in our
[1:05:09] confession to be identified with the
[1:05:13] death burial and resurrection
[1:05:16] that that is what we are doing we we are
[1:05:19] identifying ourselves with that body of
[1:05:22] jesus christ
[1:05:25] praise the lord
[1:05:28] now over the years
[1:05:30] the churches has used it in a sense of
[1:05:33] being a member of a church
[1:05:37] you got to be baptized to be a member of
[1:05:39] the church
[1:05:41] the structural approach is that we are
[1:05:43] being baptized to be identified
[1:05:48] with his death his burial and
[1:05:51] resurrection
[1:05:53] and that's the reason why
[1:05:55] repentance is important
[1:06:01] praise the lord
[1:06:02] now when a person comes with a mindset
[1:06:05] that i want to be part of this church
[1:06:08] you know in a message you got to be
[1:06:09] baptized in jesus name to be part of the
[1:06:12] local church that's the only way you can
[1:06:14] now so it's just only a church mind
[1:06:22] praise the lord
[1:06:27] and maybe
[1:06:29] uh uh uh you know uh get baptized
[1:06:32] because you know the the scriptures that
[1:06:34] get baptized in the name of the lord
[1:06:35] jesus christ you know they want to be
[1:06:37] part of the church all right yeah i mean
[1:06:39] that's that's uh the first thing you
[1:06:40] have to do the next in venice communion
[1:06:42] they have all of these church
[1:06:45] elements and and and programs on their
[1:06:48] mind and how they can be part of the
[1:06:50] body of that local church and not
[1:06:53] actually fulfilling what the word
[1:06:56] is requiring
[1:07:01] praise the lord amen
[1:07:04] take it take take it in in the light of
[1:07:06] the word
[1:07:12] like brother brandon preach the message
[1:07:14] the creator of sin
[1:07:17] and the penetrator it took to get to
[1:07:19] read sin out of our life
[1:07:23] now if it is approached at a place where
[1:07:26] we know that we are being identified
[1:07:29] with that body
[1:07:33] and what and and the kind of a price
[1:07:37] that he pays
[1:07:41] and he went through all of that
[1:07:44] i mean under no condition a person would
[1:07:46] want to go into the water to be a wet
[1:07:49] sinner and come out i mean a dry sinner
[1:07:51] and come out as a wet sinner
[1:07:58] but you see
[1:07:59] over the years
[1:08:01] and it's all the effect of catholicism
[1:08:05] church owner stays on the minds of the
[1:08:07] people and as long as church stays on
[1:08:10] our mind
[1:08:12] the word becomes of no effect
[1:08:16] praise the lord
[1:08:18] god promised that if we are baptized in
[1:08:21] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:08:23] will receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:08:35] it's because
[1:08:36] the people just want to be identified
[1:08:38] with a church they want to be called you
[1:08:40] know that now this person is a believer
[1:08:43] and after that they can learn all the
[1:08:44] dress code they can learn all the you
[1:08:47] know the behavior that comes to the
[1:08:48] church but you see if there is no death
[1:08:51] if not as a sense of death have hit the
[1:08:54] sinful nature
[1:09:00] you go and identify in water baptising
[1:09:02] and then you still have all of your
[1:09:04] battles and struggles and all that
[1:09:09] praise lord
[1:09:11] am i saying tonight the whole church
[1:09:13] need to be re-baptized no
[1:09:15] that's not what i'm saying
[1:09:17] i'm not saying that you have to examine
[1:09:19] your baptism nope that's not what i'm
[1:09:20] saying
[1:09:23] what i'm saying is that the importance
[1:09:25] of these ordinances
[1:09:27] was not to bring us to a church
[1:09:31] that importance was to put us in christ
[1:09:39] praise the lord
[1:09:43] was to put us in christ
[1:09:47] now the old missionary brother good
[1:09:49] friend of mine
[1:09:51] one time he was over i think over in
[1:09:53] south korea was sold in and uh i mean at
[1:09:56] the time he was taking the message in
[1:09:57] that area
[1:09:58] and then he was sharing
[1:10:01] you know after
[1:10:02] uh most of those people has uh you know
[1:10:05] uh has have some form of uh
[1:10:08] pentecostal things you know with them
[1:10:11] you know and and and you know and when
[1:10:13] the truth of
[1:10:14] water baptism came i mean to them it was
[1:10:17] not a problem because many of them was
[1:10:19] baptized in jesus name
[1:10:21] but the problem there is that even among
[1:10:24] the elders of the church
[1:10:26] it was still difficult for them to get
[1:10:28] over certain things
[1:10:31] struggling with adultery and different
[1:10:32] things was happening in their life and
[1:10:35] all of them
[1:10:37] so he was sharing why
[1:10:39] he said i kept wondering
[1:10:42] why i mean
[1:10:43] why god promised you know you baptized
[1:10:46] in jesus name
[1:10:48] uh uh you know you received the gift of
[1:10:50] the holy ghost why are these brothers
[1:10:52] not
[1:10:53] why are they not overcoming
[1:10:58] he says then i realized that all of the
[1:11:00] organization that they were they were in
[1:11:03] that god that they got baptized in it
[1:11:06] was a way to be identified with the
[1:11:08] church
[1:11:13] are you grabbing the concept
[1:11:18] when you are baptized in jesus name
[1:11:21] in the name of the lord jesus christ is
[1:11:24] not to be identified with the church is
[1:11:27] not to be identified with the message is
[1:11:29] to be identified with the death barrier
[1:11:32] and resurrection of jesus christ
[1:11:35] until that is dreaming home
[1:11:42] not just to take a church identification
[1:11:45] then you get stuck under that church
[1:11:47] spirit
[1:11:55] and like most of the churches would do
[1:11:56] they will have baptizing class to tissue
[1:11:59] their doctrine and tissue you know what
[1:12:01] they believe and all they are doing they
[1:12:03] are just immersing you into the system
[1:12:07] is not in the body of christ
[1:12:18] but this thing was given to the church
[1:12:20] for us to be identified with the body
[1:12:23] and that's the reason why the early
[1:12:25] church had they had
[1:12:28] an immediate result
[1:12:30] because they were not bringing the
[1:12:32] people to an organization
[1:12:34] they were bringing the people to christ
[1:12:36] they were bringing the people to a
[1:12:38] raising christ
[1:12:44] so when they when they when they take
[1:12:46] them down the water they baptize them it
[1:12:48] was an immediate effect immediate result
[1:12:52] but what is on the minds of most of us
[1:12:55] preacher is to make this person a member
[1:12:57] of my church
[1:13:08] now you read the message of desperation
[1:13:11] brother branham
[1:13:14] brother branham let me let me take
[1:13:16] something here then
[1:13:21] praise the lord
[1:13:29] but jordan i'll send a
[1:13:32] note back there i don't know
[1:13:34] let me let me just read that
[1:13:36] bert rams uh spoke this uh on uh
[1:13:41] hebrews series and then he also
[1:13:44] mentioned there on communion
[1:13:46] i was i was also trying to look into my
[1:13:49] notes
[1:13:50] on the kid of the door where he he spoke
[1:13:52] a whole lot about it
[1:13:54] now so i just sat there to be able to
[1:13:57] cover the baptism part of it we have
[1:13:59] been identified with his body
[1:14:04] praise the lord
[1:14:06] when a young
[1:14:09] believer goes down into the water
[1:14:13] he must be able to uh uh be brought to
[1:14:17] the place where he is he's identifying
[1:14:20] himself lord jesus you die on the cross
[1:14:23] for my sin
[1:14:26] praise the lord
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:30] he must he must be he must be in that
[1:14:32] mindset is is i mean with the grace of
[1:14:35] god if the person is i've been taught
[1:14:37] right i mean if god is dealing with your
[1:14:39] heart
[1:14:40] it's not when they just want to measure
[1:14:42] themselves up with the rest of the other
[1:14:44] believers and you know and just want to
[1:14:46] know okay now he's a believer you know
[1:14:48] now we can call him brother john
[1:14:59] because we have to know that we have the
[1:15:02] full benefit if we are in the body
[1:15:08] amen that was the first fruit from the
[1:15:11] dead
[1:15:13] and that's the reason why we have the
[1:15:14] hope in us that we will rise again
[1:15:17] because we are in that body
[1:15:22] we are identified with their body in
[1:15:24] baptism
[1:15:26] we are being placed in the body
[1:15:30] by the baptism of the spirit
[1:15:38] that's the only place where god places
[1:15:40] his name
[1:15:43] that's why we have our healing that's
[1:15:44] what our resurrection is our rapture is
[1:15:47] in our body
[1:15:49] it's not in the four walls of the church
[1:15:58] praise the lord brother branham speaks
[1:16:00] here on this uh uh on this thought let's
[1:16:03] press a little bit on it we are kings
[1:16:05] and priests together what difference
[1:16:07] does it make
[1:16:10] whether we have all
[1:16:13] whether we having as long as we got god
[1:16:17] we are more than conquerors we are more
[1:16:20] than conquerors he says
[1:16:22] we sit in the presence of god in the
[1:16:24] fellowship of the holy of the holy
[1:16:26] spirit taking spiritual communion from
[1:16:29] the hands
[1:16:31] of him
[1:16:33] that testified
[1:16:35] i was he that was dead and it's alive
[1:16:39] again
[1:16:41] and i'm alive forevermore sitting
[1:16:44] together in heavenly places in christ
[1:16:47] jesus
[1:16:48] now brother brother branham yet is
[1:16:50] alluding to the sense of spiritual
[1:16:52] communion that's what we do when we are
[1:16:55] in the fellowship in the church we are
[1:16:57] in church service just as we are now
[1:17:00] under the preaching of the word
[1:17:04] praise the lord
[1:17:06] we have we we are feeding right from the
[1:17:08] hands of the master
[1:17:10] we are having
[1:17:12] fellowship with the holy ghost spiritual
[1:17:14] communion
[1:17:17] praise the lord
[1:17:25] now down here uh communion brother
[1:17:27] brandon
[1:17:28] referred to that i was called on a few
[1:17:30] days ago
[1:17:31] of some uh
[1:17:33] verifying christian gentleman
[1:17:35] that never had this and he understood
[1:17:38] that we were thinking
[1:17:40] communion literally
[1:17:44] they take it what they call spiritual
[1:17:47] communion
[1:17:49] and which as far as communion and they
[1:17:52] said it's all right because communion
[1:17:55] is to talk to
[1:17:57] see
[1:17:58] and the brother gave me this scripture
[1:18:00] and says brother branham you know well
[1:18:02] uh he gave brother branham a scripture
[1:18:05] i didn't add any idea but i just took
[1:18:08] those two two two calls uh to uh kind of
[1:18:12] print the sense of spiritual communion
[1:18:16] and but with this sense also there are
[1:18:18] many like i said this morning you know
[1:18:21] even even around the message i mean
[1:18:23] there are a lot of churches you know
[1:18:25] around the world that they don't even
[1:18:26] practice baptism
[1:18:28] most churches especially when you go in
[1:18:30] the realm of uh uh the character
[1:18:33] churches they are more basic on healing
[1:18:36] you know prosperity and you know that's
[1:18:38] i mean that's that is where their
[1:18:40] doctrine is lining up nothing had to do
[1:18:42] with the body of christ nothing have to
[1:18:44] do with the places of the people those
[1:18:46] things is not for them it's all that god
[1:18:48] promised them god said he's going to
[1:18:50] prosper them he's going to bless them
[1:18:51] they're going to lay fine you know
[1:18:53] that's all they just push out there
[1:18:55] nothing about any otherness any
[1:18:58] scriptural ordinance
[1:19:01] they don't give that to the people
[1:19:04] but
[1:19:05] also
[1:19:06] uh to uh
[1:19:09] uh churches that like laid on uh
[1:19:12] on uh on the scripture make emphasis on
[1:19:14] the scripture you realize that
[1:19:17] you know just and and and as i said i
[1:19:19] mean i got i got uh touched with this
[1:19:23] with this uh uh thing on my heart
[1:19:26] is because i went into an area and i
[1:19:28] realized that
[1:19:30] you know all of these believers people
[1:19:32] been believing the message for 10 plus
[1:19:34] 10 years
[1:19:36] and
[1:19:37] and the pastor just believed that his
[1:19:39] church is not qualified
[1:19:42] to have convenient service
[1:19:47] and nobody in the church is qualified to
[1:19:48] have communities
[1:19:52] praise the lord
[1:19:54] you see how we can we can rest heavily
[1:19:57] on works
[1:19:58] right
[1:19:59] and what we are trying to achieve
[1:20:02] and it's it's it's all it's all in our
[1:20:04] mind that we're trying to this is where
[1:20:07] we want to get the church you are you
[1:20:09] it's all on human efforts
[1:20:21] i mean it's it's said bowling from
[1:20:23] behind the poop as far as i'm concerned
[1:20:24] there's nobody in this church that is
[1:20:26] qualified for communion
[1:20:29] what you are doing is that you are
[1:20:30] trumping on the blood of jesus christ
[1:20:34] right you are saying that blood was not
[1:20:36] sufficient
[1:20:39] you need something better than the blood
[1:20:41] of jesus christ that's what you are
[1:20:43] doing
[1:20:44] sure
[1:20:47] that's right praise the lord
[1:20:49] that's what you are doing
[1:20:51] if a minister would do that that's what
[1:20:53] he's doing he's trumping on the blood of
[1:20:55] jesus christ and if a believer will do
[1:20:58] that
[1:21:01] yeah
[1:21:02] this is i'm not i'm not yet qualified
[1:21:04] for you
[1:21:07] praise the lord whatever you need to be
[1:21:09] qualified you better go find it
[1:21:11] right
[1:21:13] that's right
[1:21:14] praise the lord
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:19] you better go and find it right
[1:21:23] because what is happening here is data
[1:21:26] is word we we i mean we
[1:21:29] we are all caught up in this thing and
[1:21:30] thinking that we are doing something for
[1:21:32] the lord and so we we have to bring you
[1:21:35] know a a a sacrifice that is acceptable
[1:21:39] we are right back to catholicism right
[1:21:44] right back to capitalism we have we are
[1:21:46] creating pennies for ourselves
[1:21:50] the only thing that we are now working
[1:21:52] on grab bottles
[1:21:54] on breaking bottles
[1:21:56] we are not stripping our hair to the but
[1:21:59] we we are affecting our mind
[1:22:07] we are limiting ourselves
[1:22:11] from the blessings
[1:22:19] praise the lord
[1:22:27] in the same sense
[1:22:29] we are not supposed to come and partake
[1:22:30] of the communion when we realize that
[1:22:32] we're not living right
[1:22:34] right
[1:22:35] that's a clear-cut instruction in the
[1:22:36] word of god
[1:22:41] that instruction is there in the word of
[1:22:50] god well you see that our our our
[1:22:54] our taking of the comedian our uh being
[1:22:57] accepted in the beloved
[1:23:00] is not on our works
[1:23:02] you have to realize is
[1:23:05] the sacrifice that is on our examination
[1:23:08] is not the worshipers
[1:23:13] it's the sacrifice
[1:23:15] that is on an examination you see what
[1:23:17] we do is that we replace it we make
[1:23:20] christ the worshiper and we make
[1:23:21] ourselves the sacrifice
[1:23:24] sure because we we think that we need to
[1:23:26] be a zombie
[1:23:30] praise the lord
[1:23:32] and this thing is not right in my life
[1:23:34] and this thing is not right in my life
[1:23:35] and this thing is not right in my life
[1:23:37] you are limiting the you are limiting
[1:23:39] the power of god
[1:23:41] you know what the word of god says
[1:23:43] repent then repent
[1:23:50] so what i wanted to draw to tonight is
[1:23:53] that i'll find timing and be able to
[1:23:55] take you through coaching and scripture
[1:23:57] to really be able to establish this but
[1:24:00] just like how israel had those spiritual
[1:24:03] elements just imagine god is telling
[1:24:06] them you go and take
[1:24:08] the the land and these people are going
[1:24:11] just with their children husband wives
[1:24:13] and and you know just follow they are
[1:24:15] not an army and they are going to
[1:24:17] conquer
[1:24:18] nations
[1:24:19] yeah what is doing that conquering for
[1:24:21] them is not the stakes that they have in
[1:24:23] your hand it's a god that is that have
[1:24:26] promised he said i will send honest
[1:24:28] before you
[1:24:31] he even promised that he would come down
[1:24:33] and fight for them
[1:24:40] praise the lord
[1:24:42] now that is the same that is the same
[1:24:44] way this spiritual element is to the new
[1:24:46] testament church
[1:24:48] right when we are identified in that
[1:24:50] body
[1:24:52] we know that he was bruised for our
[1:24:54] iniquity
[1:24:55] by the chastity by the the uh the the
[1:24:59] chaste man we're supposed to have peace
[1:25:01] by his tribes we are healed we know that
[1:25:03] it was all
[1:25:04] he took all in their body
[1:25:08] praise the lord
[1:25:09] so we can claim our healing because we
[1:25:11] are identified in that body
[1:25:17] we can have victory over our weaknesses
[1:25:23] praise the
[1:25:24] lord because we are identified with that
[1:25:28] body
[1:25:30] what the enemy will always do is that he
[1:25:32] will keep making you to look at yourself
[1:25:35] when you are supposed to be looking at
[1:25:37] christ
[1:25:45] praise the lord
[1:25:48] now so just like how those
[1:25:50] spiritual elements
[1:25:52] created the shout of the king
[1:25:57] when he brought the act of the coveting
[1:26:00] the people yelled because they know the
[1:26:03] presence of god was in the camp
[1:26:05] and even the philistines identify it and
[1:26:08] say god is in their midst
[1:26:11] that's the same thing when the new
[1:26:12] testament church gets down to uh
[1:26:15] uh the reality of this
[1:26:20] we don't make the bread the literal body
[1:26:22] of jesus christ
[1:26:25] the only thing we know that is an
[1:26:27] unliving bread
[1:26:28] because living must not be mixed living
[1:26:31] represents sin
[1:26:33] so it takes is that symbol of unleavened
[1:26:36] bread we know there is some living bread
[1:26:38] it's being baked with prayer that's
[1:26:40] right
[1:26:43] praise the lord amen
[1:26:45] the one that is doing it we know that we
[1:26:48] trust and know the life that they are
[1:26:49] letting and we know that they will
[1:26:51] follow the the scripture of them and
[1:26:53] they will make it with prayer
[1:26:55] now because it's based on the word we
[1:26:58] can come by faith
[1:27:01] and identify with it it's not the piece
[1:27:03] of prayer we are identifying with it's
[1:27:05] the commandment of the lord
[1:27:07] because jesus said do this in
[1:27:09] remembrance
[1:27:11] that's right
[1:27:17] praise the lord
[1:27:18] desperation brother branham says there
[1:27:20] is healing in the communion
[1:27:33] but you see when
[1:27:35] when uh
[1:27:39] the devil
[1:27:40] can guess the place the the the people
[1:27:43] to the place and think that we are now
[1:27:46] walking
[1:27:47] we are not qualified
[1:27:49] sure
[1:27:50] praise the lord what he's doing is that
[1:27:53] he's robbing them
[1:27:56] of the spiritual benefit
[1:27:58] right
[1:28:00] praise the lord
[1:28:01] because even as a pastor of a local
[1:28:05] church
[1:28:06] that's what
[1:28:08] i look for
[1:28:12] after the communion service i see
[1:28:15] i see what god does
[1:28:17] yes sir
[1:28:18] because uh i mean we it's not like we
[1:28:21] just we just make it a routine every
[1:28:24] first sunday it must be every first
[1:28:25] sunday night
[1:28:28] sometimes we need we need their
[1:28:30] spiritual help
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:37] and as just as i will bring in uh our
[1:28:40] ministers and says yeah come and give us
[1:28:42] tedious revival let evangelists preach
[1:28:44] and rebuild sin that's the scene where
[1:28:46] i'll say deacons let's have communion
[1:28:49] sure
[1:28:53] praise the lord
[1:28:56] because what i'm doing is that i'm
[1:28:57] bringing this local local assembly to be
[1:29:00] identified with a portion of the world
[1:29:03] and i'm claiming every blessings that
[1:29:05] goes there
[1:29:06] yes
[1:29:07] for the people
[1:29:24] praise the lord
[1:29:29] right in this
[1:29:30] local church
[1:29:32] identified god
[1:29:33] delivering somebody
[1:29:38] delivering somebody
[1:29:40] and
[1:29:42] just before the communion
[1:29:44] i called them to the office and we
[1:29:45] talked a couple of years back
[1:29:49] and i said to them
[1:29:54] you know we've been praying about this
[1:29:58] i don't know how you feel tonight i
[1:29:59] don't know if you are going to be part
[1:30:01] of the communion
[1:30:02] he says yeah i was thinking about i was
[1:30:04] praying and praying about it and says
[1:30:06] well okay
[1:30:08] what i want
[1:30:09] you to do is i want you to approach that
[1:30:12] table by faith
[1:30:14] and say lord i'm identifying myself with
[1:30:17] your body tonight
[1:30:18] i'm placing this thing in your hands
[1:30:24] amen
[1:30:26] yes
[1:30:27] praise the lord
[1:30:38] and the rest
[1:30:40] is a testimony
[1:30:46] so it is not just to fulfill a church
[1:30:49] ritual
[1:30:52] no
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:59] we need
[1:31:00] all the help
[1:31:03] that we need
[1:31:07] brother branham says he says the new
[1:31:08] testament church
[1:31:10] i mean uh uh uh believes so much
[1:31:14] so much in communion that it would not
[1:31:16] even take
[1:31:18] an elderly sister to be a widow if she's
[1:31:21] not partaking of comedian
[1:31:27] he says paul told trinity don't count
[1:31:30] them a widow
[1:31:32] if they are esteeming from communion
[1:31:34] in a sense that it means that they are
[1:31:36] not living right
[1:31:38] sure
[1:31:50] praise the lord
[1:31:52] we can take the communion for granted
[1:31:55] and just come to the table of the lord
[1:32:01] with unconfessed saints in our life and
[1:32:03] you know and and and gracious and
[1:32:05] bitterness and different things no we
[1:32:07] must not do that
[1:32:08] we must take our house before the lord
[1:32:12] amen
[1:32:14] sometimes the most things that are
[1:32:16] troubling you
[1:32:18] that the enemy keeps using to block you
[1:32:20] with that's what you should bring to a
[1:32:22] communion
[1:32:27] bring you to a communion service
[1:32:31] praise the lord
[1:32:37] because there is healing
[1:32:40] in the communion
[1:32:43] the lord bless you tonight let's pray
[1:33:10] when moses instructed him
[1:33:13] for the passover
[1:33:16] he's a alarm to a house
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:24] alarm to a house
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:31] and in that same sense we come tonight
[1:33:36] as we are identifying with this you can
[1:33:38] claim your loved ones
[1:33:41] you can take your lamb to a house
[1:33:42] tonight
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:48] you can claim somebody that you are
[1:33:49] burning fur you can you can pray or
[1:33:51] stand in the gap for a brother or a
[1:33:53] sister

[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:13] yeah he's the worthy one
[1:34:20] who is wanting to take the bulk and lose
[1:34:22] the sieves thereof
