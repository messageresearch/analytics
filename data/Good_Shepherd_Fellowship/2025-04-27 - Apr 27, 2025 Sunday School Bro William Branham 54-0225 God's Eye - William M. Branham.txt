TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And that is but the Holy Spirit all through the audience now and the angels of the Lord present. I was reading a scripture this afternoon while studying in the book of the Psalms. And I wish to read it just for a moment a few verses of it especi I'll say two verses that's the 32nd Psalm the seventh and eth verse. Thou art my hiding place. I love that David speaking that God is his hiding place. How uh love to think that we have a hiding place that God's great presence can be our hiding place where we can hide from the things of the world and when trouble arrives he's our hiding place and in the eth verse he said and I will guide thee with mine eye was thinking God speaking there, how he would guide us with his eye and to know that his presence is ever near and he does guide us. Now I was thinking how becoming that scripture is to the true servant of Christ in St. John 5:19 or when he says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in himself, but what he sees the Father doing, that doeth the Son likewise." The great eye of Jehovah, Jesus was looking through his eyes. It must have been Jehovah's eyes that he was looking through when Simon came up and he told him that his name was Simon and he was going to change it to Cphus and told him his father's name was Jonah. It just had to be God's eye that he was looking through. God's eye has been with the prophets through the ages that could see ahead of time what was going to happen. It could been nothing else but God's eye when Nathaniel was brought by Philillip into his presence and Jesus said to him behold an Israelite and he said when did you know me rabbi? He said before Philillip called you when you were under the tree I saw you. It must have been God's eye that he was looking through. It must have been God's eye in St. John 4 when he seen the woman have five husbands. It was God's eye that he was looking through when he the woman touched his garment and virtue had gone from him and he looked over his audience until he found the woman and knew what her trouble was. It could have been nothing else but looking through God's eye when he perceived the thoughts of the Pharisees when they said, "You are Beelzeub." in their hearts. It was God's eye that he was looking through when he perceived the thoughts of the disciples when they said reasoning who would be the greatest among them. It was God's eye that he was looking through when he went out into the pool of Bethesda and looked around to find a man on a pallet and knew that he had been in that condition for 38 years. And what a consolation it is in our scripture reading last night that we found that Jesus said the scriptures cannot be broken. And then when Jesus went away and that great eye of God that was to guide he promised the things that I do the works that I do shall you also. And that guiding eye wasn't to be gone at the going of the Lord Jesus. He was to continue forever in his church. And when he rose on the third day and ascended up on high and sent the Holy Spirit back, that the church tonight looks through that same guiding eye that guides his people to all truth and he is truth. And how happy we are tonight to know that that scriptures cannot be broken. And know that that same ah that will guide us is in our presence tonight or we are in its presence tonight. That shall guide us from sickness unto hell. That shall guide us from our afflictions to the [Music] cross. that will guide us from affliction to good health. That will guide us from a sinful life to a saint set aside life in God. That presence of God is ever near. Jesus said, "Lo, I am with you always, even to the end." And we're nearing the end. And as Jesus confirmed that guiding eye being with him in the days when he revealed himself to the Jews before the ending of that church age for the Jews or their dispensation, he manifested it by looking through the eye of God. He did the same thing to the Samaritans. And now we got the Gentiles left. And tonight, God still looks through that same eye because Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he still looks through the eye of God as he can with his grace and sanctifying power cleanse us and has called us to be his sons and daughters to use us as the vines or the branches in the vines to still look through the eye of God to see what has been and what will be. And we will not walk in darkness as long as we look through God's eye. God's eye reflects his will. reflects his spirit, reflects his word. What good would it do with all of our training? What good would it do with all of our teaching and our theology if there wasn't something to keep us even keel? What good would it do a ship to have great sails and great fine boughs and sterns and pockets in it? A great compass on the inside if it didn't have a rudder. What if it had neither compass nor rudder? It would just be drove about with the winds from place to place. But we're thankful that God has both rudder and compass. He lets us know where we're standing today and what we'll be. He'll He said, "I will never leave thee. I will never forsake thee." So, let us look through the eye of God tonight and we will see that he'll lead us to Calvary. And at Calvary, everything was finished. He was wounded for our transgressions. With his stripes, we were healed. Every sinner here tonight was he was saved when Jesus Christ died at Calvary. Every sick person was healed when Jesus died at Calvary. He finished the work. The only thing that God can do now is to anoint ministers to preach the word or set gifts in the church to to point you to the finished work of our Lord Jesus. May God grant it tonight. Here's my prayer while we pray. eternal and blessed God, who brought again the Lord Jesus from the dead and raised him up and set him at the right hand of the Majesty on high making intercessions upon our confession. And we come tonight with a confession to say that we believe every word that he taught us in his word. And to confess is the say the same thing. And we believe that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever that in his presence this year. and will declare him alive after 1900 years at the closing of this age or gentile dispensation. Come Lord God, one word from you will mean more than all the words that we all could say. just to see you speak with your great power. It would send the hearts into a place that they have perhaps never reached before. And it would bring faith to a level for the healing of the sick and conviction to the sinner that would repent of his or her sins. And we pray then Lord tonight that our bodies may be yielded to thee in such a perfect way that you would speak to us. Grant Lord these blessings realizing that our voice going through this microphone declares that there is something alive because the microphone would be a mute if there wasn't something to make a noise behind. And so would we be, oh God. But speak, Lord Jesus, as we yield ourself to thee for service. And in humility, we'll bow our heads and give thee praise while we call for thy presence. We have a right to do it because you promised you would do it. And you do it on those bases, not because you have to, but because you promised it. And the scriptures cannot be broken. They must be fulfilled. Therefore, Lord, we wait humbly as servants of yours on the manifestation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. For we ask that in his name. Amen. Now it depends now upon God. And if he will bless us by his presence, we shall go away with happy hearts like those who came from Emmas. If he will reveal himself to us, the minister has spoke. The songs has been sung and the prayer has been made. The scripture has been preached. Now it's God's time to speak. And God can't speak to her in this manner just and perform things unless somebody will be here to hear it. Many mighty works he could not do because of their unbelief. So tonight, may our conscience and our emotions be moved if he shall so bless us to come in in our billing here tonight and make yourself known that he is the lovely resurrected Jesus. Now we shall call the prayer line. Not too many but just a few to get them to the platform. I believe they said the prayer cards were prayer card P was giving out tonight back in Paul. Last night we took a group of them. So tonight I believe there's some from 50 on till something 75 or something last night. So let's start and just get a few been times fading fleeting fast from us. Let's begin and start with the 85 and go to 100 just to get someone up here. And who holds prayer card P85? Would you just raise your hand so that we could see you here? Maybe I got the wrong place. I will What's it P85 or the lady here? All right, lady. Come right down here. 86. Would you raise your hand? Prayer card P86. The lady, everyone's got prayer cards. Look in those who can't uh uh get up or something or can't move your hands or if you're Look at your neighbor's car. They may be deaf and dumb. 85 86 87 prayer card 87 way up in the balcony. They're just give out all over the building. The boys give them out. 87 [Music] 88. Oh, in the All right. 8889 prayer card P89 the lady there. Thank you lady for helping her. She may be dead. 8990. Would you raise your hand or can I see it? Someone prayer card P90. The lady. All right. 91. Prayer card P 91 92 93 [Music] 94 94 All right. 95 95 prayer card T 95. Would you raise your hand? in the line 96. See, it may be someone coming up here doesn't mean you're going to be healed. Not by no means. You can be healed in your seat just the same as you can be healed here. 96 97 98 99 100. Now, if we can get these out in time, we'll start back somewhere else and just keep bringing them up. But now, coming up here doesn't mean that you're going to be healed. The you can be healed out there just the same as you can be healed here. God will heal you on the merits of your faith. And that alone, just as you believe. Now, how many out there does not have a prayer card and you want God to heal you? You won't be called up the platform, but you want God to heal you. Just raise your hands anywhere in the building. That's the reason we have to give out cards just to get them lined up. All right. You do this. You just look to Christ. The Bible said that he is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. How many know that the Bible teaches that? Well, a woman touched his garment and he said, "I got weak." And she went off into the audience somewhere and Jesus said that he was weak, that virtue had gone from him. Then he he looked around until he found the woman. How many ever read that story? Well, then does the Bible say in Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever? The scripture says he's still a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. Then you look tonight, not to a preacher, not to one of your brothers or sisters, but look to Calvary. Look to Christ who is not exactly Calvary. Calvary is where the price was paid. But Christ is away from Calvary tonight. He's in the presence of God, ever living to make intercessions upon our confession. The spirit of Christ is here in our midst tonight. And notice why they're lining the people up. When Christ was here on earth, he said, "I came from God and I go to God." Do you know that to be true? How many believe that Christ was in the wilderness with the children of Israel? That pillar of fire that led the children of Israel was Christ. Do you believe that the angel of the covenant was in the burning bush? He said he was before Abraham was I am. And I am was the one that spoke to Moses in the bush. Then God was manifested in flesh to take away sin which was in his son's body Christ because God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. He expressed himself through Christ and Christ said I come from God from the pillar of fire and I returned back in that condition. After his death, burial, and resurrection, Paul met him on the road to Damascus, and he was again back into light. How many knows that's true? Well, any spirit will bear record of itself. Any life will bear record. A life of a, as I have said before, a life of a pumpkin vine will bear life bear pumpkins. Grapes will bear grapes. Jesus said, "I'm the vine. You're the branches. The life that's in you, if I told you the spirit of an outlaw was in me, you'd expect me to have big guns and be dangerous." If I told you the spirit of an artist was in me, I would be able to paint the pictures that the artist painted. And if we say the spirit of Christ is in us, we do the things that Christ did. Amen. Think the picture here not of me. I have nothing to do with it at all. It's Christ expressing himself to his people. Then if this this being photographed here in Germany and different places and before the great man even FBI examined the picture, George J. And if it was proven to be a supernatural being and it looks like the same pillar of fire, then it was Christ still with his church. I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee. Then the works that I do shall you also. It'll do the same kind of works he did if it's the spirit of Christ. If it isn't the spirit of Christ, it won't do those works. upon this. Let us say, are you the lady that's to be prayed for? I want to know how many in the building that would raise your hands that I do not know you. Let's see your hands. Everybody in the bill in the prayer line, too, that I do not know you. Here's a picture of the Bible. Now, remember, the Bible was written by the Holy Spirit. And the spirit that wrote the Bible still lives. He doesn't get any different. He doesn't know any more today than he knows then because he was infant to begin with. And if God did anything in the beginning, and if the same circumstances rises again and if he acts different than what he did in the beginning, he acted wrong when he acted. He's got to remain the same. He doesn't get smarter like we do because he was he was infant to begin with. And the Bible is a both a history, it is a prophet, it's a love story and it portrays Christ to us. Then if the Christ of the Bible is not dead but alive, he's got to manifest himself just like he did in the Bible. Now, here's a woman, the dear beloved person is I never seen her. She looks about the age of my mother. I never seen her in my life. And we are totally strange to each other. And here is a picture of the a Bible scene like it was in St. John the 4th chapter when a man and woman Jesus at the well with the woman and he spoke to her. Now notice he was on his road to Jericho but need go by Samaria. Why? He just said in St. John 5, I do nothing till the father shows me first. Do you believe that scripture? Then he never performed one miracle without God showing him first. Verily, verily, I say to you, the son can do nothing in himself, but what he sees the father doing, that doeth the son likewise.
