[2:29] [Music]
[2:33] brought a lamb.
[2:35] He laid his hand upon the lamb. His
[2:37] throat was cut because he sinned. And
[2:40] this lamb died for his sin. Now, the
[2:42] reason he went out, says Hebrews, with
[2:44] the same desire that he had coming, if
[2:46] he committed adultery, he goes back out
[2:47] with the same desire. If he could kill,
[2:49] he goes back out the same desire.
[2:51] hatred.
[2:52] When that blood cell or the lamb was
[2:54] broke, that blood cell in the lamb was
[2:56] an animal's life.
[2:59] It could not come back and dwell in a
[3:01] human life because the animal life has
[3:03] no soul.
[3:05] But the human life has a soul.
[3:08] See, animal don't have a soul. It don't
[3:10] know. You don't have to wear clothes and
[3:11] cover up it snakeness and say bad words
[3:14] and you know what I mean.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; See, they they don't know it. They fell
[3:18] because they're under us. The human
[3:20] beings are above the Amalite because
[3:22] they're a god of the Amalite. That's
[3:24] right. What was in the beginning called
[3:27] Adam named him and had power over
[3:29] Genesis 1:26. He had dominion over all
[3:31] the earth. He was he was made in the
[3:33] image of God and was made to be a lesser
[3:36] God. Jesus said so. Said not your law
[3:38] say that you're gods and if they call
[3:41] them gods who the word of God came to
[3:42] you which was prophet, how do you
[3:44] condemn me when I say the son of God?
[3:46] See there you are now.
[3:49] Now in this the father, son, and holy
[3:53] ghost. Now after he dwelt in the pillar
[3:56] of fire, then came down and made himself
[3:59] a body,
[4:01] brought himself down a tent of human
[4:03] flesh and dwelled him among us. God
[4:06] brought 1 Timothy 3:16 without
[4:08] controversy, Paul speaking. Great is the
[4:12] mystery of godliness, for God was
[4:15] manifested in the flesh.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. creator became savior and a great
[4:21] song that booth clever wrote the great
[4:23] creator became my savior and all god's
[4:27] fullness dwelt in him see now notice
[4:31] father Daniel was the father of way
[4:33] above us couldn't even get around where
[4:35] he was at then he became son and we
[4:38] could touch him feel him is a man and
[4:41] then he gave his life that blood cell
[4:44] was broken by a cruel sinful Roman spear
[4:46] when it pierced his heart and really a
[4:49] broken heart killed him. His water and
[4:52] blood separate. Grief broke the cell of
[4:55] grief because of the sin of the human
[4:57] race. He used to sing a little song. Oh,
[5:01] what precious love that father had for
[5:04] Adam's fallen race. Gave his only son to
[5:07] suffer and redeem us by his grace. Now
[5:12] there that blood cell was broke. Now
[5:15] when we lay our hands by faith upon that
[5:17] trembling lamb of God,
[5:20] feel his flesh quivering and shaking for
[5:23] us
[5:25] and our hands become bathed with his
[5:27] blood in our soul. The life that was in
[5:30] him wasn't just a mere man. Neither was
[5:33] it an animal. It was God.
[5:36] So that life comes back up on the
[5:38] sanctified one and becomes a son or a
[5:41] daughter,
[5:43] an offspring of God. See the life of
[5:46] God. And we are sons and daughters of
[5:48] God through the breaking of that blood
[5:50] cell,
[5:52] Jesus Christ. Now what is then? God is
[5:56] back in his people fellowshipping like
[5:59] he did in the garden of Eden. See there
[6:02] you are sons and daughter. Isn't it
[6:03] beautiful? Beautiful God. Now, now we're
[6:08] going to finish the baptism. Now, let's
[6:10] go. Now, from that time,
[6:14] now the next time baptism spoke of,
[6:17] Philip went down and preached to the
[6:20] Samaritan.
[6:22] Acts 8, I believe it is. Yeah, Acts 87.
[6:27] Stevens the stone. I think it's Acts 8
[6:30] that Philip went out and preached to the
[6:31] Samaritans
[6:33] and
[6:35] they had all baptized every one of them
[6:38] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[6:42] But the Holy Ghost had fell on none of
[6:43] them yet. Peter had the key.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; He has unlocked.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; He has unlocked to that generation. Then
[6:51] when he goes down and the Holy Ghost has
[6:53] fallen on them yet they were baptized in
[6:56] the name of Jesus Christ.
[6:59] Peter went out him and John and laid
[7:01] Peter laid hands up on them and they
[7:03] received the Holy Ghost.
[7:05] Now then while Peter was on the housetop
[7:09] one time and Simon the tanner, he saw a
[7:12] vision because carne it's the gentile.
[7:15] There's the Jew Samaritan now the
[7:17] Gentile. And Peter was on the housetop
[7:20] taking a little nap before dinner while
[7:22] he was fixing dinner. And he seen a
[7:24] sheep being lowered down. All kinds of
[7:27] unclean creeping animals from the earth
[7:29] is on it. And then when he did that, he
[7:32] heard a voice saying, "Rise, Peter, slay
[7:35] and eat." He said, "Nothing's ever come
[7:37] in my mouth unclean." Said, "Don't you
[7:38] call unclean what I call or come and
[7:41] unclean what I'll call clean." See, as a
[7:44] Gentile. And then when he come out of
[7:46] the vision, there was two men standing
[7:48] at the gate calling for him to go up and
[7:50] he tell spirit told him rise and go.
[7:52] Don't think about nothing. Just go on
[7:54] with them. Went to the house of
[7:56] Cornelius.
[7:57] He gathered up. Cornelius was a
[7:59] centurion. He called all his band
[8:01] together and they were all in there and
[8:03] Peter was explaining to him what had
[8:06] happened and Cornelius told him that he
[8:08] had saw an angel that told him to go
[8:10] down and ask for one Simon as follow
[8:13] Simon the Tanner's house. And while
[8:15] Peter was speaking these words, the Holy
[8:18] Ghost fell on them which heard the word.
[8:19] And Peter said, "Can we forbid water?"
[8:22] Seeing that they have received the Holy
[8:23] Ghost like we did. And he commanded them
[8:25] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[8:29] Christ. Now, Acts 19, that's Acts 10:49
[8:34] there, sister. You're putting it down.
[8:36] Acts 10:49. All right. 10:47 on down to
[8:39] the end of the chapter. Read it. And
[8:42] then when they come now to Acts uh uh
[8:45] Acts 19
[8:48] baptism mentioned again
[8:50] Paul now now that makes everybody now
[8:53] the only time baptism is ever rendered
[8:56] was John the Baptist first they were
[8:59] baptized over there they now but they
[9:02] wasn't baptizing in the name of Jesus
[9:04] because they didn't know who he was yet.
[9:06] See now, but now when Jesus said in
[9:09] Matthew 28:19, "Baptize the name of the
[9:11] father, son, holy ghost," and gave that
[9:13] expression to the man he gave the keys
[9:15] to that had the revelation of what it
[9:17] was all about revealed from heaven.
[9:18] That's what you're getting right now.
[9:20] The revelation from heaven just
[9:22] straighten it out. It'll hit the target
[9:23] if you just stay right with it. It's
[9:25] zeroed already. It hit land. Peter had a
[9:27] vision and zero it. This does it, too.
[9:30] Brings it right back in. The gun
[9:31] shooting where it's supposed to shoot
[9:32] now. See? Yes. Now then Paul was a was
[9:37] the apostle to the Gentiles. Is that
[9:39] right? He was a gentile. Of course God
[9:41] sent him to the Gentiles. Now now you're
[9:43] everybody then was baptized in the name
[9:45] of Jesus Christ. Everyone the Jews were
[9:48] they baptized in Jesus name. Acts 2 38.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Samaritans Acts 8 were they baptized in
[9:56] Jesus name?
[9:57] &gt;&gt; All right. Gentiles
[9:59] at Acts 10:49 they baptized in Jesus
[10:01] name wasn't. Yeah.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Well, now there's some more people
[10:04] running around there that isn't baptized
[10:06] in Jesus name, yet they've been
[10:07] baptized. I guess it'll be all right
[10:09] then. So, just let them alone because
[10:11] they've been baptized. What difference
[10:12] does it make? Baptized. But John say
[10:17] we're going to see. We going to see
[10:18] whether this is essential or not.
[10:20] Praise God.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; Acts 19. Paul hasn't passed through the
[10:25] upper coast of Ephesus. He finds certain
[10:28] disciples. Now there was a young Baptist
[10:31] preacher up there and um his name was
[10:34] Apollo which was Apollos rather and uh
[10:37] he was a brilliant man. Acts the 19th
[10:41] chapter. And he was uh he was a
[10:43] brilliant man. And he was u he was
[10:46] proven by the Bible like a real Baptist
[10:49] &gt;&gt; that Jesus was the Christ by the Bible.
[10:52] And they had a revival up there, a great
[10:54] revival. And Paul had been put in jail
[10:57] for casting out his devil out of a
[10:59] fortune teller. And so him and Silas and
[11:02] one night they got to praying in there
[11:03] and singing him and the Lord come out,
[11:05] shut the jail down. So then uh after he
[11:09] had got delivered went out and took the
[11:11] centurion and baptized him and his wife
[11:13] as Paul's cousin of course is baptized
[11:15] in Jesus name and then wanted to talk
[11:18] him and his uh family out and baptize
[11:20] them and then Paul went on his way and
[11:22] he went over to Aquilla and Priscilla
[11:24] which were tent makers friends of his
[11:26] converts to Christ and they had been
[11:29] tending this revival up here for these
[11:31] Baptists 18th chapter before you'd read
[11:33] that just one chapter before. Uh so then
[11:36] so then Paul passed through the upper
[11:37] coast of Ephesus. He finds certain
[11:39] disciples. They were disciples. They
[11:42] were Baptists. Fine preacher and
[11:43] everything proven under the Bible Jesus
[11:45] is the Christ. And he said unto them,
[11:48] "Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[11:51] ye believe?" Ah, you trinitarian brother
[11:54] and sister, you like to lay that into
[11:56] the Baptist. But I wonder if we can lay
[11:58] something back again. You like to say,
[12:01] "Ah, you Baptist. How about you said you
[12:03] received the Holy Ghost when you
[12:04] believed? Paul said, "Have you received
[12:06] it since you believe?" And these people
[12:09] were honest. They said, "We know
[12:11] there'll be one any Holy Ghost." Now, if
[12:13] it don't make any difference after that
[12:16] baptism, water baptism don't make any
[12:18] difference. Why did this apostle ask
[12:20] this question?
[12:22] So, then to what were you baptized?
[12:25] Oh, they might have said this. Oh, we've
[12:28] been baptized. They said, "We've been
[12:29] baptized unto John
[12:32] and we're very well satisfied with it."
[12:34] The same man baptized Jesus Christ. Same
[12:37] old water.
[12:39] I guess that you you baptized John right
[12:41] the same old water Jesus baptiz. You
[12:43] think it's pretty good, wouldn't you?
[12:44] &gt;&gt; But remember the keys is locked in
[12:46] heaven.
[12:48] Peter did on the
[12:50] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. See, it's a mystery.
[12:53] It's hidden. Whatever you bind on earth,
[12:55] I'll bind in heaven. Here's a revelation
[12:57] that only can come through this
[12:58] revelation. See, you see Paul said, "But
[13:01] that won't work anymore."
[13:04] Have you received the Holy Ghost? Since
[13:05] you believe it, said we don't. It'll be
[13:07] one of the Holy Ghost said, "To what was
[13:08] your baptizer?" Otherwise, how was you
[13:10] baptized? They said, "We've already been
[13:12] baptized." Oh, yes, sir. Yes, that's
[13:14] your Apostle Paul. We've been baptized.
[13:16] We baptized. But John the Baptist,
[13:18] right? There's the same old water Jesus
[13:20] Christ is baptized. If he was good
[13:22] enough for Jesus to baptize her, boy,
[13:25] I'm telling you, he's good enough for
[13:26] me. Hallelujah. If they done that,
[13:28] they'd have never got it.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; But Paul said, "Have you received it
[13:33] since you believed?" Said, "We know not
[13:35] where there be any." Oh, go said, "Then
[13:36] what was you baptized?" They said, "Unto
[13:39] John." He said, "John only baptized unto
[13:42] repentance,
[13:44] saying they was to believe on him that
[13:45] was to come, that is on Jesus Christ."
[13:47] And when they heard this, they were
[13:50] rebaptized
[13:51] in the name of Jesus Christ. That brings
[13:54] this group over this group. And they
[13:58] laid their hands up on him and he spoke
[14:00] in tongues and prophesied.
[14:02] I'll tell that every scripture in the
[14:05] Bible, every person in the Bible was
[14:08] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[14:11] I'll take any man, any historian
[14:15] to this task. If you can show me one
[14:18] speck of scripture
[14:20] where anybody was ever baptized in the
[14:23] Bible,
[14:25] New Church, of course, he wasn't
[14:26] baptized in the Old Testament, but in
[14:28] the New Testament where any persons is
[14:30] ever baptized in the name of the Father,
[14:32] Son, Holy Ghost, one place, if that was
[14:36] ever called over him, father, Son, and
[14:38] Holy Ghost,
[14:40] then I'll compromise. And if you and
[14:43] I'll show you if you can show me one
[14:46] text of scripture where anybody was ever
[14:48] baptized in the name of father, son, and
[14:50] holy ghost or one speck of history where
[14:54] anyone was ever baptized and to the
[14:56] ordaining or the studying and order the
[14:59] Catholic Church and AD 600
[15:02] &gt;&gt; 325 it is AD 325
[15:05] 325 years after the apostles everybody
[15:09] continued baptizing in the name of the
[15:11] father, son, holy ghost in the name of
[15:13] Jesus Christ until 3:25 and then they
[15:16] made the organization and in the
[15:18] organization which the Catholic Church
[15:20] is a mother of all organizations. God
[15:22] never did organize a church but in there
[15:26] they substituted the name of father son
[15:28] holy ghost but calls the trinitarians
[15:30] and then they had a great group that
[15:32] went rank and trinitarian and a great
[15:34] group that went rank and unarian which
[15:37] both groups is wrong.
[15:40] See, but no and any person that's
[15:44] baptized using those titles of father,
[15:46] son, holy ghost ignorantly are admitting
[15:50] that they are Catholics and denying what
[15:52] the Bible says. Now, my brethren, and
[15:55] you to listen to this tape, I'm I I w
[15:58] that through ignorance you do this.
[16:01] Don't just throw this away, these women
[16:04] presenting this to you, but you owe it
[16:08] to yourself to sit down and study it and
[16:10] find out.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; If you're not, if if you're a child of
[16:14] God, surely you'll give it that much
[16:17] consideration.
[16:20] The word of the Lord came to the
[16:22] prophets in the old days.
[16:24] The reason they called them prophets
[16:26] because they had the interpretation of
[16:28] the divine word because they were
[16:31] divinely sent and the signs and wonders
[16:34] that follow them prove that they were.
[16:38] God has said in his scripture, if there
[16:40] be a prophet among you, and if he says
[16:42] things and it's not right, don't come to
[16:44] pass, then don't fear him. But if it
[16:47] does come to pass, then you hear,
[16:50] for I am with him. And the very word
[16:52] prophet means a divine interpreter of
[16:54] the divine word. The signs and wonders
[16:57] that ma makes the word manifest is a
[17:00] sign that it came. Now we believe that
[17:03] the gift of prophecy that ties the words
[17:05] together are saying now not long ago and
[17:09] maybe the same man may listen to this
[17:11] tape someday
[17:13] that I at this taking place. It was
[17:17] brother sism
[17:19] of the oneness. Now you you many of you
[17:22] people listening this would say brother
[17:23] Brandham is a oneness. I am not.
[17:27] I think you're both wrong. Both oneness
[17:30] and trinity. Not to be different but
[17:32] it's always a middle of the road like
[17:34] Isaiah said. Isaiah 35 said there shall
[17:37] be a highway. And you Nazarene brothers
[17:39] and so forth you say the grand old
[17:41] highway of holiness. I beg your pardon.
[17:44] It doesn't say the highway of holiness.
[17:46] that there shall be a highway and and is
[17:48] a conjunction and a way and it shall be
[17:52] called the way of holiness, not the
[17:54] highway of holiness. The way is in the
[17:56] middle of the road. Each side is where
[17:59] the offs
[18:01] went to on one side and trinitarian went
[18:03] on the other side. But the true message
[18:06] lays in the center of the road. Now
[18:09] watch here if you'll understand. Now I'm
[18:12] laying three things out. Now, I'm taking
[18:14] this to be what Matthew said and to show
[18:17] you that both men said the same thing.
[18:20] But one the trinitarian people through I
[18:26] hate to say this and don't want to say
[18:27] it, but I don't want to say through
[18:29] ignorance as the Bible said, but I mean
[18:32] that through misinterpretation. You
[18:35] can't make it run right, brethren.
[18:37] You'll never make it run right. It can't
[18:39] till you come back to the revelation
[18:42] and then the whole scripture runs right.
[18:45] Now look here my sisters and you
[18:46] brethren who are present. Matthew said
[18:50] father son holy ghost. Now if you'll go
[18:54] get the emphatic diagnost
[18:58] of the Greek interpretation original
[19:00] Greek interpretation from the Vatican
[19:04] happens to be that I have one.
[19:06] uh it's out of print now I think or any
[19:09] Greek uh uh translation
[19:13] the right translation to Acts 238 Peter
[19:16] said repent every one of you and be
[19:18] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[19:20] Christ the King James version said in
[19:23] the name of Jesus Christ but in the
[19:27] emphatic dig it says in the name of the
[19:29] Lord Jesus Christ
[19:32] now when you want this brethren just
[19:33] baptize in the name of Jesus
[19:36] There just many Jesus's
[19:39] but there's only He was born Christ the
[19:44] son of God he that's his name that's
[19:46] what he is Christ means the anointed one
[19:51] messiah Christ now Jesus
[19:56] 8 days later he was given the name Jesus
[20:00] when he was circumcised
[20:02] and he is our Lord so he is our Lord
[20:06] Jesus Christ. That's what he is. Now,
[20:10] so that you'll see that Peter had the
[20:12] revelation I'm trying to tell you. Now,
[20:14] look at these these boxes on this side.
[20:16] Father, Son, Holy Ghost. That's what
[20:19] Matthew said. 10 days later, Peter said,
[20:21] "Lord Jesus Christ." Now see if these
[20:24] three titles isn't three names uh or the
[20:29] one name of the three titles. Now look,
[20:33] Matthew said father. Is that right?
[20:38] &gt;&gt; But Peter said Lord.
[20:41] Now David said the Lord said unto my
[20:44] Lord. Now they both said the same thing
[20:46] there, didn't he?
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Lord God.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Thy Lord Lord thy God is one. God is
[20:51] true. All right. Now,
[20:54] Peter said
[20:57] in the name of the Lord
[20:59] and Matthew said a title to that Lord
[21:02] which is father. Lord's what he is.
[21:06] All right. Matthew said son.
[21:11] Who is the son? Jesus said Peter.
[21:15] That right? All right. Now, and Matthew
[21:19] said Holy Ghost. Peter said Christ,
[21:24] which is the Holy Ghost, the logos that
[21:26] went out of God.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; See, father, son, holy ghost is the Lord
[21:34] Jesus Christ.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, exactly. The Lord Jesus Christ. So,
[21:40] them are titles and not There you are.
[21:44] Paul,
[21:46] &gt;&gt; I wish we had longer going to it, but
[21:48] it's getting late. Can we uh pray just a
[21:50] moment?
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father,
[21:54] thou does know that we're not trying to
[21:56] try to say something here to confuse
[21:59] anyone.
[22:01] Father God, we're trying to take
[22:02] confusion out of their mind.
[22:06] And no doubt by what they'll be lovely
[22:08] fine Christian brothers, ministers,
[22:11] trinitarian believers
[22:14] that will hear this.
[22:17] Our sisters may play it to their
[22:19] pastors.
[22:21] And I pray, Father, that that you won't
[22:23] let my brother think that I'm trying to
[22:26] act like a knowit all or something.
[22:29] [Applause]
[22:31] But Lord, I am grateful that
[22:34] that you give us the revelation of the
[22:36] word.
[22:38] And I've tried to be like a a Christian
[22:41] brother to them. Never mention it
[22:43] amongst the people. Just go ahead
[22:46] because Lord, I believe they are your
[22:48] children.
[22:51] But they they find these seemingly
[22:54] contradictions in the Bible and they've
[22:56] made a great issue out of it.
[22:58] The assemblies would not associate with
[23:01] the oneness. The oneness was called
[23:05] which we know now and here in this
[23:07] meeting fellowshipping with some of
[23:09] those brethren and we do in every
[23:12] meeting.
[23:14] But Lord, we know they're all your
[23:15] children.
[23:17] But they made a great issue and pulled
[23:19] away and cut off. The assemblies will
[23:22] have nothing to do with them. And they
[23:23] won't have nothing to do with the
[23:23] assemblies, the churches of God and so
[23:25] forth.
[23:27] And each one in doing so, Father, I
[23:29] realize they draw boundary lines and
[23:30] become stuck up and organized. And what
[23:33] did you do with both organizations? Laid
[23:35] them up on the shelf and they're both
[23:38] dying and practically dead.
[23:44] Let honest-hearted people see. Lord, I
[23:47] cannot open their eyes. You're the only
[23:49] one can do that. I present your truth by
[23:52] a revelation of Jesus Christ, which ties
[23:56] the words together, God's word, and make
[23:59] it the true word. I pray that they'll
[24:02] not misunderstand, but will love you and
[24:05] serve you all the days of their life and
[24:08] walk in the light. Grant it, Lord. I
[24:11] pray for these women. Now, I pray that
[24:14] everyone that sees this
[24:17] will not cause them to be confused, but
[24:20] will cause them to be hungered and
[24:22] thirsting for more of God's revelations.
[24:25] Grant it, Father. I commit this to you
[24:28] now. You do with it whatever seems good
[24:30] in your hand in Jesus Christ's name.
[24:34] Amen.
