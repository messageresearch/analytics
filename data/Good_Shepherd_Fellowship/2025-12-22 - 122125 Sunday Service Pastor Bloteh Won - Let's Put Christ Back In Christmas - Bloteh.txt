So uh and we had a privilege to see her. She promised that she would be in church today and so we thank the Lord for his grace upon him too. Amen. &gt;&gt; And um uh we just want to bring you uh just some few announcement this morning and maybe if I don't write it down I will forget. We want to thank the Lord for for giving us u uh the opportunity to be back in the warm church. Amen. And we want to thank the Lord for the trustees that made it possible to get things done. Brother Steve Cassidy, brother Max, and brother Jordan, thank you. Thank you for working behind the scene to make sure that the guys who come in and do the work here for us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And they are not changing the the furnace, they also changing the air condition. So, summertime you will get a brand new air condition. So, we thank the Lord for that. Amen. Praise the Lord. And I think if we start changing everything little by little, we will change the church too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We have first have to start changing our lives and the Lord has helped us and we change the heater and change the air condition. And pretty soon you might show up one day then it's a brand new church. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we just thank the Lord for that. We are very grateful. So uh as we promised you uh we were to have a service the coming weekend but with everything the with with the heater and everything that was going on for some reason I was very hesitant. One of the reason I was hesitant to is because uh uh I was renewing my passport and it was not coming. So in my mind I thought okay I was I will be home and uh I would just let the brothers know to find someone else to take the meeting and so I would just write right standing in between there and then the heater came and uh uh uh so I would make sure that come every morning to make sure that uh there is no pipe that is bust and make sure that the heers were working and I got extra tool to add to what the trustees had just to make So the reason was we didn't want it the pipe to freeze. So uh uh and so right in the midst of that I just couldn't make any kind of a planning for us to have a weekend service next week. So I just I just took that off. I said well we will just have regular service even if I have to go uh brother Dan or or one of the brothers would take the service. And then uh so this coming Wednesday as we and there will be no service. We will stay keep it like that because we were going to have services on the weekend. We would not have a weekend service because we don't have a weekend speaker. But uh uh right in the midst of that uh brother brother Jason Deise uh uh send me a text message that he's in town. He moved to South Carolina and then later on I heard the move over to Canada to be with brother Eugene Brown. So I think he's bringing some folks from Canada over to the US for winter retreat and different things. So he contacted us that he will be around and he wanted to come around. He thought he would come today, but I just told him the other uh I know he's coming from Kennedy there, but uh we don't want to have a cold service like we did last week. So, he'll be preaching for us next weekend. We have him coming speak for us next weekend. I'll be gone and keep me in prayer. I have services Thursday, Friday, two on Saturday, two on Sunday. So uh just uh keep me in prayer and uh uh so uh there'll be no service on Wednesday night. We want to wish you all a merry Christmas. I think sister Ali brother gets back today. Yeah, he flies back today. Praise the Lord. So we pray that the Lord will give uh uh our decon safe travel back and uh so u uh and then the following Wednesday will be our all night service. That's what I did not want to forget. services will start at 900 p.m. which mean we will be seated at 900 p.m. Many times when I say services will start people ask me is it when we will sit or is it when the service will start as when we come through the door service starts. Praise the Lord. As soon as we come through that door we are in the service. Praise the Lord. We are asked to take our seats and pray and uh meditate, read something until the service uh uh the song service come up. So we'll be seated at 900 p.m. and uh we just want to uh uh be able to bring gratitude to the Lord. Uh uh I realized that the last all night service we had, we started an hour late and before we could get to the night, we were already starting to sleep. So uh uh if we can start at 900 p.m. be seated and then go right into our our praise and thanksgiving. that we said uh uh you know uh we are all welcome to uh to sing a special or give a testimony and uh uh if you think your testimony is too long maybe you can you can write it down we'll read it for you amen praise the Lord we'll read it for you and uh so that's why we want to do the the upper Wednesday not this coming Wednesday but the following one will be the 31st. So uh uh and then uh uh that's that is the plan for uh the Wednesday service. I don't know if I'm forgetting anything. The all night service next week Sunday JC Mars will preach for us and uh that's what we want to do. So uh uh Sister Joy gave in a request uh for us to sing a song. What was the song you requested? Oh, come let us adore him. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my favorite uh Christmas message. Praise the Lord. So, uh let's let's stand on our feet. We will sing that. And then uh uh I also wanted to sing uh uh Oh come let us adore him. Oh come let us I don't cry out. Let's sing the verse. Oh God, faithful, joyful and triumphant. Oh come, oh come to the end. has come and behold him from the king of angels. Oh, come let us I know. Yes. Oh, come let us I know him. Oh, let us I know in Christ I verse all of all. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. In the highest. Oh, come let us know. Oh come let us adore him. Oh come let us adore him. Christ the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know why I always do that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wanted for us to try the uh I know if some of the children will be able to help us with that song. I am a CH. I wanted to do it for the little ones.

You know, I thought about this song this morning because when you listen to uh uh uh Brother Brown message on deank, he talks about how uh uh a deoted is not in a manger. Deity is in our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's what brought this song to my mind. So I said I would sing it with the K. So we started pulling around in the house and and I mean my tongue is just stick to the roof of my mouth. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Either either a divine healing or the tongue surgery. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's let's do this other one. Uh there is no salvation.

That's why we were playing there today and next uh weekend uh for our our son school tape playing that we do. There is a portion of that uh service I want to play this morning just before we get into the message. So I ask uh uh the folks back there to just play that for us and uh uh it's a little story that uh a Christmas story and uh just few minutes of your time if you just want to follow with us this morning while we play that. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; I read a story come to my mind not long ago of something on that order. It was in a great city here in this nation and New York and it was on Christmas Eve and there was a poor family, a little daddy. He had TV and he was his wife had TV. They had been underprivileged and he he kind of he's weakly and so nobody would hire him. He had no education and he he people didn't want him. He just as an outcast to become a Just you know what a is just go by and pick up something and paddle it and get what they can. What little uh royalty they make on it. They try to live by just a like a peddler or something on the street. go buy some pins and needles and thimbles and whatever they can and and take it and and maybe buy them for a penny a pack and sell them for a nickel and make four cents on the pack. Maybe in a run of a day that's a great commission, but just think all he'd sell in a day. Maybe make 20 30 cents a day. and he had a family and the little wife being weakly she she died and it was coming Christmas time and the little girl she had developed from malnutrition not having the right food and things uh she took TV also and she had a little fella about 8 n years old 10 and she had never had a dog for Christmas and that's what she wanted for a gift was a doll. And the father not able to give her medical attention and so forth. And he he seen the little girl was going fast. And he tried his best to to to get enough money together to get her a doll for Christmas if he could just get enough to buy her a little doll. And so the Christmas time was coming on. The bad weather set in. The little girl developed some kind of a pneumonia and and she died just a few weeks before Christmas. And the father of course brokenhearted went to his little tin can and got the money out and he thought of his little girl and she wanted a doll like a little girl. See it's a little mother coming on. You notice how a little girl she goes to doll because she's that's her nature. She's a she's a coming mother. She will be mother someday she lives and everything northern nature. That's a little girl likes a little doll she want take care of because after all she she's a little potentially a little mother and she wanted a little doll. She never had one. Daddy had saved everything he could to get her a little doll. And so she died and the father kind of had a lapse of mind. his wife had been taking this little girl in his mind kind of got to a place that he still he go to bed every night and talked to this little girl though she was been buried but he thought he he was talking to her and tell her now honey it won't be long daddy's going to get you this dolly for Christmas and daddy's promised you the dolly and I I'm I'm going to get it finally Christmas arrive and of course you know how it is the rich had their their big parties and the candles burning and the great high masses in the churches and talking about Jesus and and so forth. The churches were going through all kind of routines of mass and singing and carols and everything. Little did they know what was going on back in the alley behind all this. this uh little fella back there and he got beside himself. He wanted that little girl to have that doll so bad cuz she had begged soul for this little doll. So he went out and he bought her a little rag doll, a little uh little thing probably about 30 cents, a little dirty something bought down on the side of the street. And it was a real cold night. the the blizzard winds are blowing, snow falling hard there in New York, out on the coast, the streets filling up and the people in their great big limousine, cars and drunken parties out drinking the celebration of the birth of Christ and of these things that we speak of tonight trying to think that that's the right way to do it is to drink off their old sorrows and things that that's the way to do it. call them stand in the store the other day and a woman talked about what two girls met who won't know what they got for their daddy and one of them said well she got him a carton of certain kind of cigarettes and the other said she got him a fifth of whiskey and a and a and a deck of car that ain't given a memorial gift for the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's the way it goes you see it's just a big bunch of tinsel it hasn't got Christmas in it at all and so we find out this little man. He wandered along and he know his heart his little girl was gone, but he went and bought the doll anyhow. And he thought, I'll just start walking. I'll find her somewhere. She'll be along the street here and I'll find her. And he started walking. He he couldn't fool himself. She wasn't back there in a little shanty and in the little ragged dirty bed, but uh she was buried. So he he knew he thought he'd find her on the street. He said, "I'll just keep walking." And he going down through the alleys while they were singing their carols and going on and going down the alley packing this little dirty doll holded in his coat up to his heart, thinking of his little girl. And finally, a policeman happened to see him and policeman had a few drinks himself and he run into the alley and grabbed the old man and turned him around. He said, "What are you doing? Hang in here." He said, "I'm taking this little doll, sir, to my little girl." He said, "Where do you live?" And he told him, "Where you live?" He said, "Well, you're going away from that place. You're drunk. Go back the other way." He said, "Sir, I'm not drunk. I promise my little girl I' I'd get her a gift for Christmas." And said, "An appropriate gift for a little girl is a little doll." And he said, "Let me see it." So he showed him a little dirty rag doll is holding in his next to his bosom holding a little doll as he. So the policeman half drunk himself shoved him on and started down the old man went down the alley. Snow falling fast and well the midnight parties broke up. The next morning the snow had lit up. The sun had come out and so there was all the people from their great gay parties was ice sacks on their heads from too much drinking and celebration of the the birth of Christ. And and many of them were forced and caring all from all the going on way down in the alley. They found the old man and when he turned him over, he had a little doll next to his heart. I suppose he tuck his gift to him. He found her in a land not here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He he he tucked the gift. It was an appropriate gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God merciful. Yet it cost him his death. There's no other way in the world he could have given her the gift. She was bearing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the only way he could do it was he go like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Little doll. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't mean too much. I guess a little dirty face doll. But it's what did he do? It fulfilled a promise he had made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what the people thought about it, his dirty hands and a little dirty doll, but it fulfilled a promise to his little girl. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes they look upon the gospel the same thing. They didn't want it when God brought it, but it fulfilled a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he would give his son. You know what? They left him to die, too. Just like a on the street. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. They left him to die like a on the street. And today, they treat him like a trap on the street. That's that's little story always moved my heart. Uh when you when you just think about it deeply uh very poor family didn't have anything. Wife was sick. She died time for Christmas. and he made a promise that he would get her little dog. No matter what uh type it was, he wanted to make sure and get it to her. And then while she was waiting for her little gift, she died also. But he kept his promise. He will work hard. He would do everything that it takes him to get the door. She wanted a door. I would get it for her. And he would lay down at night and and just speak. I will get you your daughter, whatever her name was. And uh and as we cancelled, you know, our our service on Wednesday night, praying uh hoping that we'll be able to uh spend time with our family and loved ones. I won't uh you know but uh just like I said the last time you know uh uh having a sense of valuing the people that God put around you sometimes is so easy we uh so common we get so used to one another that uh you know uh uh saying thank you, expressing a sense of appreciation that uh means a whole lot to us. Like sometimes people will say, "Well, they know that I love them because I gave them this, I gave them that, you know, u uh and not even having the strength to even express those words, I love you, looking the person right into the eyes and telling them I love you." And uh all of those things were, you know, those thoughts goes through my mind. You know, like Bram said there, you know, the rich, they hide their party, do whatever it is, but there were people down in the slums, you know, and I think it's the same today, you know, uh the homeless people and people dealing with different things. The same thing about us as as God's children. We all have need. Praise the Lord. But I pray that uh as we go into this season uh uh that God will make this uh this Christmas a little bit different to us uh for the fact that there he will give us the grace and give us the heart to be able to celebrate it in a special way more about the ones that are close to us than the things that we get for him or the things that he gave to us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And just like that, daddy, even though his little girl was gone, but he tried to stay get his gift. Went in the cold and tried to find her to be able to give her this gift. And he died with with with trying. He died trying to get that gift to her because he promised her. May every one of us do the best that we can. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh bring uh in order of our lifetime that we try the best that we can to be able to give him the gift that uh he has given to us. With that being said, let's just stand to our feet and we will read a portion of the word this morning and then we find a little context here to speak to you with a few minutes that is left before us. Matthew chapter 2. Matthew chapter 2. Matthew chapter 2, we read from verse one. Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold there came wise men from the east of Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his side in the east, and I come to worship him." When Herod the king have heard these things, he was troubled in all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and the scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet. And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah. For out of the shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel. Then Herod, when he have privately called the wise man, he inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared, and he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. And when yay I found him bring him bring me a word again then I may come and worship him also. Then u when they have heard the king they departed and Lord the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child, not the baby, but the young child, with Mary, his mother, and fell down and worshiped him. And when they had opened their treasure, they presented unto him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrr. And being warn of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. Amen. It's in John chapter 3. We will take uh one verse that is verse 16. St. John chapter 3:E1 16 and we will read it together. Let's read. For God so loved the word that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Let's pray. Father we have read your word Lord and we just want to ask that you will come this morning take a little uh context out of your word something oh God that will speak to us Lord Father. Oh God, father as we just go into this season that the entire word Lord Father God is commemorating Lord Father the birth of our Lord Jesus. Oh God we know uh we can we can tithe whatever we want to ti to it. But Father Lord what we want this morning is to just find that place in our heart. Oh God where we can be able to thank you for the gift that you give to this world. Father we love you. We appreciate you in Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Amen. Just like I said, we can uh you know uh uh get in all of the the we can get in all of the the history of Christmas and you know uh the time and all of that. It does not matter this morning. And uh uh we can also pre message to show you where we stand with Christmas. It still does not matter this morning. What we want to do is to just be able to speak to you in a little way that uh whichever way that uh uh you choose to spend your Christmas. What I want to say to you is uh from uh this this quote that brother Brandon said here in the message. From the beginning, it was not so. He said, "I seen a little sign today when I was going to eat my breakfast down in the city. It said, "Put Christ back in Christmas." I thought, "Amen. That's good." Not only Christmas, but every day. Put Christ in your every day. &gt;&gt; Put him back in the church. Bring him back to the earth again. Put him in action. Right? &gt;&gt; Let the Christ of God stands in his church because he said, "I will be with you, even in you, to the end of the word." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So this morning, I speak to you, let's put Christ back in Christmas. &gt;&gt; No matter how you celebrate your Christmas, put Christ back in Christmas. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because I believe with all of the stuff, you know, when the the the the gift wrapping and everything that we try to get ourself, it's so it's so easy for us to forget the ones whose uh birthday we uh we are celebrating. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We try to make it ours. Sometime we forget that we were not born uh December 25th &gt;&gt; and then we get offended of the gift that was born and then the thing that was born for me and whatever it is but I would say this morning let's pull Christ back in Christmas. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whatever whichever way you spend your Christmas, let's pull Christ back in Christmas. Praise the Lord. So this morning I I take that little thought to speak to you and uh the past week we were talking about uh uh I don't know how I found myself there uh but all that my words were written in the book and I go to start talking about the book of life and the lamb's book of life and uh uh if you read back in Genesis you'll find that that uh the Bible speaks about the tree of life. Amen. The Bible speaks about the tree of life and we realize that that tree of life had one fruit and it was to give life. The fruit of that tree was to give life. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what it was called the tree of life. Now in the middle of the book we realize that uh Jesus said I am the bread of life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh so uh uh uh I think uh the tree of life bear a fruit of life and that fruit of life became the bread of life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in a way I would like to think about it is that the tree of life was cut down by the hands of men. When they when when when they put him on Calvary, &gt;&gt; when they hang him on a tree, they cut the tree of life down. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But it's a tree that can die. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So all through the ages, the tree of life went through a process just like how men would take trees and and you know and and and and saw them and take them through process to be able to make sheets. The tree of life went through seven church ages and came out as the book of life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It went through seven church ages and came out as the book of life. In Revelation chapter 5, the Bible says there was no man that was wanted to take the book to even look on it to read the book. No man could touch it. And I believe that that was the book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But then one of the others said, "John, there's a there's a there's a lion, the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals there are." And when John looked, he saw a lamb. He saw a bleeding lamb. And the lamb came and took the book from him that sat on the throne. And when the lamb took the book, the book that was the book of life became the lamb book of life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That book became the lamb book of life because the lamb claimed the book. He broke the seals thereof. And then we will see it in Revelation chapter 10. The very same book that no man was wanted to touch. The lamb as the mighty angel this time give the book to the seven angel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the seven angel was promised to to reveal the mystery that was in that book. But uh what we will see in verse 8 of Revelation chapter 10, the angel will give the book back to John and this time he would tell John to eat the book. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To eat the book. So when if you just follow my little story this morning, you will realize that this the tree of life that was in the garden of Eden became the book of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we will realize that that tree was not a natural tree. That tree was a spiritual tree. That tree was Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why he could say, "I am the bread of life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if the tree was Jesus Christ, the bread of life of Jesus Christ, then we will says the book of life is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, eat the book this morning. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we thank the Lord for that. I saw this little thing as I was as I was uh uh just listening to a tape and uh and it it it it taught me something and I want to share that with you this morning. uh from from uh from the message 10 virgins and uh the the the 144,000 Jews. Brother Bam said this it will hit it we hit red because he said this during during this time he said bad weather on the outside but all it is real good on the inside. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is one time we can say is good to be on the inside looking out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it? &gt;&gt; To be on the outside looking in. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now the principle, the thing that hit my mind when I read this is that is the way with election is different when you are inside looking out. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When you are outside looking in, election don't looks like it's fair. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It does not look that like it's fair. &gt;&gt; If you have not received the grace of God to understand God's election, it do not look like it's fair. &gt;&gt; But when you are inside looking out, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, it is one time that we can say it's good to be inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm just trying I'm I'm trying to warm up my my my gear here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we want to we want to say Merry Christmas to you this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to say Merry Christmas to you. And uh uh and as we remind oursel to keep Christ in Christmas, we want to uh just just come to you this morning with this little thought and uh uh you know and and and bring and bring something to you. As I as I was as I was uh thinking on what to speak on as as Christmas message uh uh sister text me and says she said, "Brother War, uh are you preaching a Christmas message on Sunday? Uh, she put me right on the spot. I said, "Well, okay." I said, "Yeah, I'm preaching a Christmas message on Sunday." She says, "Well, okay." And I said, "So, so you pray for me." Now, but this is what I was thinking about. Let me give you a little history. When Jesus, just like we read from the scripture, when Jesus was born, when he was born, there were three stars that constellated in the east. That's the reason why when you read Matthew chapter 2, it speaks about the child. It do not speaks about the baby. &gt;&gt; Because when the wise men got to Jerusalem, he was no longer a baby. &gt;&gt; He was a young child. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to be definite, that was the reason why Herod demanded that the children should be killed from 2 years old down. &gt;&gt; If he was a baby, they will only kill babies. The Bible says he demanded of the wise men, you know, about this time. So they told him when they saw the star. So in his calculation, this should be about two years. Are we together? &gt;&gt; That is something that we all are familiar with. It's not a new news. But uh uh uh uh uh this was a constellation of stars that that that came together. Now in 1962, there was something that happened. There was something that major happened on the earth just like what happened back there in Jerusalem. Amen. what happened in the east that brought these men to Jerusalem. So they took they had almost two years traveling with camels through the desert and whatever that they were coming from to be able to find this place they came uh uh followed the stars and as they followed the star the star brought them to Jerusalem as they were entering the city the star disappeared. If the star will stay there, they will have come and worship the child and Hera will know nothing and nobody will know anything. But the reason why they knew is because they couldn't see the start again. So they thought everybody should know where is he born king of the Jews. They say who are you talking about? We have only one king that's Herod or Caesar is the king. Herod is the governor. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh but this was a constellation of stars. And you know, I was thinking about this because this very promise of a star that is raising up was prophesied by the man called Bam. Yeah, &gt;&gt; back in the book of numbers, Bam was the one that when he was hired by Balac to come and curse the children of Israel and he tried to do it and God would not allow him to do it when he couldn't even obey the angel and and a donkey have to speak to him. But this very man after he broke into the spirit and he realized that he couldn't curse these people and he started blessing them and he started PROPHESYING OVER THEM. HE WAS THE ONE THAT PROPHESIED A STAR will rise out of Jacob. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you tell it about Bam through the scripture, there's a place where the Bible call him a soothsayer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You tell it about Bam through the scripture, you will realize that Balam had a genuine gift, but he was not among the elected Jews. He was not a Hebrew but he had a gift. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot say that uh he was NOT GIFTED BECAUSE YI SAID A STAR HAS RAISED OUT OF JACOB. Y SAID THAT THESE WISE MEN SAW THE STAR THAT BROUGHT them to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Jewel would talk about uh ham. Peter would talk about Balam went after reward and and and and and you just look through the scripture. You see, I was studying on Bum recently. I just looking through the the scripture and and and and and just and just trying to find out most of those things because uh uh uh when you look at the the the comparison of of gifted people in our age and and how people would come so close to say well this person can prophesy or this person you know uh they they had a gift and all of that you realize that in the very same time that Bam was was was there. Moses that met the pillar of fire was there. God didn't give him the vision concerning the star that were raised out of Jacob. God gave it to this man. &gt;&gt; It shows that God is sovereign. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God could have given it to Moses for Moses to convince the people. &gt;&gt; THAT THIS SAME PILLAR OF FIRE THAT IS LEADING US ONE DAY WILL BECOME A STAR. It was given to Bam. Now, so the thing here was that the these stars came together. Three different stars. They came together and they formed a constellation. They they they line themselves. They line themselves in the heavens. And now these wise men saw the star and uh and and and the star minister to them to to each and every one of them. They got they got a they got a they got a message of whatever star that that reveal itself to them. So out of that they brought gift. But this is where I wanted to go with you this morning. in 1962. I think I think uh uh uh the beginning of the end of 1961, you know, uh uh uh science was prophesying of the lining of five stars. &gt;&gt; Okay. At the beginning of 1952, uh uh uh uh brother Ram started to talk about it that there is something about in the news about the lining of five stars. He it really never dawn on him what it meant at the time. Praise the Lord. But when he preached the message the end time sea sign, he would now bring that five stars into context. And the way he would do it is that he would give us uh an example that when Jesus was about to be born, when God was going to make himself in flesh in the ara, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He he announc it by the lining of three stars in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will come to my to my uh uh message in a few minute but I just I want to bring some information to you. These are information end time sea sign. Now listen closely. Don't fail to find this. Now before before the first coming of Jesus the the astronomer of of India they were watching the heavenly bodies and they said God always declared himself in in the heavenly body before he does in the earth before he does anything. They said why? When this the three wise men went to worship the king that was to rule the earth, a baby king that they follow a star. Your scripture said uh uh uh he said but frankly these was three stars that comes together and made one star. The the Christian astronomer that I was talking to or the magist said that means that there were three race of people that this man died for. The only three race there is is Ham, Shem and Jeff. Amen people. And uh uh when his gospel was uh uh has has been preached to Ham, Shem and Jezra people, they come together in his gospel, then the return will be. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Three is a number of perfection. But what do what do I do believe that three was? What do I do believe it was? It was a three of perfection showing there the trinity of God, father, son, and the holy ghost was made manifest in a man, Jesus Christ, the one perfect man. Listen now close. When when the when the little baby Christ was born, three stars went together to make one morning style that reflected the coming of an infant Christ, a perfect one. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now what happened? We see a rolling in the paper across the television out across the nation where five stars just fell in line with the word. What is five? The number of grace. Every time those stars comes then something happened on the earth. What is taking place? Five stars fell and and uh uh uh introducing of what what's happened now. So this is what I want I want I want to bring you now as I as I read this information to you. So this is this is back in 1962. Now he's saying this to us that there were there were the lining of these stars. We saw you know the eclipse and all of these things that been happening in recent times. But this now he's over the years he he was able to grasp it in comparison to just like how when our Lord Jesus was going to be born a h God was going to come in flesh in the infant. He uh he uh he announced it by the lining up of three stars. Now something also begin to happen back there where five star is lining. What is this all about? That's what he's trying to tell us. &gt;&gt; Now, think about it. Now, uh uh uh uh as as believers, 1963 was the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; 1963 will be a birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the Omega church was going to be born, God announced it by three stars. The Alpha Church. Sorry, I get my thing all messed up. The Alpha Church. Now, the Omega also now is being announced by the lining of five stars. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. These are information that follow me a little bit. I don't want to lose you now. So what what is happening here is that uh uh uh this is what this is what he says. Let me let me read read down a little bit here. What's happening? An infant church. Hallelujah. A bride infancy that the power of God has be to fall on her. She is taking form. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is 1962 before the seals were even open. &gt;&gt; He's announcing that uh an infant church is beginning to be born. The word, the fullness of the word is going to come again to a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE HOW THE FULLNESS OF THE word came to the people in Jesus, the fullness OF THE WORD NOW with the opening of the seal because that's that's what make the fullness. We know that every church age had a message. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the opening of the seals was to tie the loose ends of the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And now it's announcing that another another infant is is is will be born. THIS THE WORD IS GOING TO BE BORN. &gt;&gt; But this TIME IS NOT GOING TO BE IN A MANGER IN BETHLEHEM. It's going to be in the hearts of the people. &gt;&gt; Are we together? AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE WORD IS GOING TO BE BORN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE HOW THREE STARS ANNOUNCE his first coming, THE LINING OF FIVE STARS, WHICH MEAN FIVE is the number of grace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; WAS ANNOUNCING THAT SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. An infant church IS GOING TO BE ONCE AGAIN THE WORD MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; Once again there will BE A PEOPLE JUST LIKE HOW GOD TOOK A MANGER. IT WAS MADE OUT OF ANIMAL KING. THAT WAS NOT THE BEST PLACE BUT THAT WAS THE PLACE JESUS WAS BORN. THAT'S THE SAME WAY THAT GOD WILL TAKE A PEOPLE. THEY WILL NOT BE THE BEST PEOPLE BUT THE WORLD WILL BE BORN IN THEM. THE BIBLE SAYS THERE WERE NO WRONG IN THE END. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I just like I've always SAID HOW THE THE OWNER OF THAT OF THAT uh h band that had that PLACE WHEN HE SAW THE SHEPHERDS COMING FROM THE field and then knocked his gate and he RAN TO OPEN THE GATE AND AND AND AND AND ask him what's happening. HE SAID A KING IS BORN IN YOUR COMPOUND. &gt;&gt; A king is born behind YOUR WALLS. WE SAW his star. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AND THE SHEPHERD RAN IN &gt;&gt; AND THEY STARTED SINGING AND TALKING ABOUT ANGELS. AND I I BELIEVE THE MAN HELD HIS WIFE HANDS AND SAID, "OH, I WISH I KNEW I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM A BEDROOM. &gt;&gt; I WISH I KNEW I WOULDN'T HAVE PUT HIM IN THE BAR." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I pray that the Lord help me this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray that the Lord help me this morning because church, let me tell you. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord that you are looking for &gt;&gt; is your going away. &gt;&gt; The coming that you are looking for is your going away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful Jesus we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE CHILD that was born in the manger. &gt;&gt; We can talk about the manger. We can talk about the gift. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We can we CAN TAKE YOU BACK INTO HISTORY AND JUST TELL YOU OFFENSIVE Christmas story &gt;&gt; and make you laugh and yet never tell you about what God is doing in your day. &gt;&gt; Never tell YOU ABOUT WHAT GOD IS DOING IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What did he save you for? WHY DID HE LEFT EVERYBODY ELSE &gt;&gt; AND TO SHOW YOU his grace? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IS IT JUST TO MAKE ANOTHER CHURCH &gt;&gt; OR JUST FOR US TO BE DIFFERENT? &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, an infant church was born. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS ANNOUNCED WITH THE LINING OF SEVEN of five stars. SPEAKING ABOUT THE GRACE OF GOD THAT WILL PICK UP A PEOPLE IN THIS generation &gt;&gt; and God will make himself known to them. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The world will not believe much of our of our story. &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE JOSEPH AND MARY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT THAT WAS SAID ABOUT THE YOUNG WOMAN, &gt;&gt; what did she do? &gt;&gt; What did she do? By the grace of God, she tried to keep herself. She keep herself. IT WAS GOD THAT INTERRUPTED her life. &gt;&gt; The same God that interrupted your life. &gt;&gt; SHE HAD HER PLAN. SHE HAD WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO, HOW MANY CHILDREN SHE WANTED TO BORN. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. For that purpose, she kept herself. &gt;&gt; But almighty God came down and interrupted her life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, I'M GLAD HE INTERRUPTED MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. I'M SO GLAD HE INTERRUPTED MY life &gt;&gt; because he has GAVE ME MORE MEANING to live. &gt;&gt; That is better than whatever I was pursuing. I'M SO GLAD he interrupted my life. I don't know about you, but I'm so glad &gt;&gt; that he interrupted my life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we realize that uh he's bringing this and comparing it to the first coming and the second coming. Amen. It's first coming and the second coming. Amen. I might leave you. I might just suspend you in in some thoughts here, but praise the Lord. I might just suspend you in some thoughts here, but uh uh we allow the Lord to have his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There just so much confusion about the coming of the Lord, whether he has come or whether he has not come. Praise the Lord. And and and and sometimes we get so caught up in all of those things that we don't see what is happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we don't see what is happening. Brother Brandon says, "I believe in a literal coming of the Lord Jesus." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he make us to know that that coming is not for his feet to touch this earth. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That literal coming, his feet will not touch this earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But there is another coming. &gt;&gt; There's another coming that's pertaining to you and myself. It is the breath of that coming that I want to announce to you this morning. &gt;&gt; How that coming came to be &gt;&gt; just like how it came to being in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When God took a manger, &gt;&gt; he took a despised place. &gt;&gt; He was robbed in swollen cloth. &gt;&gt; Amen. The back of a of an animal skin. That's where to put down, you know, h different skins and, you know, and everything there in the band. That's where to put down, you know, for for FOR THE YOUNG MOTHER TO BE comfortable to bring forth a child. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO LIGHT. THERE WAS NO AMBULANCE. THERE WAS JUST NO MIDWIFE. CAN YOU IMAGINE MARY in pain and she crying and and and and and all the animals sticking their heads &gt;&gt; over to see where the noise is coming from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; GOD TOOK THOSE LOWLY ANIMALS TO WATCH his birth. &gt;&gt; When the people of THE WORLD WERE RUNNING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS ENJOYING IT WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING. PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HIGH WAS DOWN TO HIS PLACE AND ALL THE HIGH PRIESTS, ALL THE SAHEDRIN COUNCIL, ALL THE PHARISEES, NONE OF THEM KNEW ABOUT IT. GOD TOOK LOWLY ANIMALS, &gt;&gt; dumb beast &gt;&gt; to witness his birth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE FIRST ONE THAT HEAR THE cry &gt;&gt; of Jehovah when he WAS BORN. BROTHER B SAID JEHOVAH CRYING LIKE A BABY. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE the first one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I can just I CAN JUST HEAR IT IN THE B AS AS AS THE BABY JESUS BEGIN TO CRY.

I don't want to take a lot of your time here, but it sounded so good this morning. What's happening? I'm I'm I'm I'm closing. I might say this friends, the church is coming for God is going to have a church without spot or wrinkle. Now he's saying this thing back in 1962 &gt;&gt; when the seals is not open yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he's seeing the spiritual sign. &gt;&gt; He's seeing a sign that is ANNOUNCING &gt;&gt; THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A BRIDE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. There's going to be a church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to sit down and I mean in in your own uh uh classic ideas that you have and and and let let me tell you, let me tell you if YOU WANT TO VALUE VALUE your revelation, watch your life. &gt;&gt; Because revelation is not something you keep in your head. &gt;&gt; It's something you live. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes people the they argue with the word in their mind &gt;&gt; and and and they cannot challenge their life with the word of God. &gt;&gt; IT DOES NOT LINE UP WITH the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As a son of God, as a daughter of God in this hour that we are living, &gt;&gt; BELIEVING TO BE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, believing to be the people that have received the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is an expectation. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; How we handle the things in our life, how we handle our family. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; By the way, I spoke to brother Andre from uh from Germany that visited us the last time just came from from Uganda. Uh uh I mean such a such an outpouring there. The Lord really gave him wonderful blessing. I would I don't know what is happening but it looks like there is just some kind of a move there. Uh uh he told me almost about uh it say 1,000 or 10,000 Bibles you know they gave out to those uh somewhere in the interior uh to all of these uh uh denomination of people and just for the fact of these people you know receiving Bibles for the first time it just it just broke out something among them. Amen. And uh uh I mean uh that's that just wonderful. That just wonderful. And uh and I think brother Sam Peter from uh New York, he's down there also in another part of the region. Uh uh send me the video of the services last night. You can see that was a village setting. This one is not a church building. Is is uh is is out in the air with candle lights on and lanterns on and but the word of God is preached. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God is just uh &gt;&gt; he's just he's just taking another ride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Another move of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To bring in as much as he want to bring in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can do I mean you can hold to whatever you want to hold to in your mind and whatever you think you believe. &gt;&gt; But I would just say mash your life with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If your life is not mashing with the word, you better challenge what you believe. &gt;&gt; Tell yourself that this thing I'm believing is not producing Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not producing Christ. It's making me to backslide. I need to do something about it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What kind of Christ you have? It don't give you prayer life. You don't have a devotion. You don't have commitment. You don't have a consecration. What kind of a Christ is there? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Walking at Christ, you sleep on. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The church is coming for God is going to have a church with us. Father Rinko, she is predestinated. &gt;&gt; God says so he will have it. That makes it right. No matter what anybody said, God said it. It's in his word. &gt;&gt; That he will have a church without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; It's not a man word. It's God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The same GOD THAT SAID A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE. &gt;&gt; And he conditioned THE VIRGIN AND HE GOT THE VIRGIN AND THE VIRGIN CONCEIVE. &gt;&gt; That same God is saying you will have a church without spot or wrinkles. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will do you much better for you to start believing God's word and taking God's word and and applying God's word than to you be making making complain on your excuses because the church will be without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If your weaknesses is a spot, look away from it &gt;&gt; because it's not going to be part of theirs. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Look away from it. Look to the promise of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord God, you said this and I know you can bring it. You can bring it in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you could BE BORN IN A MANGER, YOU can be born in my life. &gt;&gt; You can be born in my heart. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's just take something yet again and then uh uh we'll see how we can uh continue to tell you. Merry Christmas. God's gift always find its place. Yeah. Here's uh only one gift that you can give and that is yourself. &gt;&gt; Give yourself to God &gt;&gt; because God already gave you. Amen. He gave you his gift. Praise the Lord. Man, there is only one thing you owe him back and and that's yourself to him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I think that's what this Christmas must mean to us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just like that father promising his child a gift. He didn't mind if he was called, he rather die trying &gt;&gt; to bring that gift to his daughter. He died in a cold trial &gt;&gt; to be a loving father. &gt;&gt; He might have failed many times. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you know that's the same thing that the Apostle Paul did? Because he witnessed the death of of Stephen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He cancelled marriage and family life from his life. He say I took the life of one. I will give my life. Whatever it takes, &gt;&gt; I will die preaching Christ. &gt;&gt; I will give my life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or we might make mistakes as fathers and make mis mistake to our spouses. But I mean at a certain time you must grab yourself and says let me try again because God is the God of second chance. If he has given me second chance, LET ME DO THE BEST that I can. &gt;&gt; Let me die trying to be a better father. Let me die trying to be a better son of God, a better daughter of God, A BETTER WIFE, A BETTER HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; This is not about church membership. It's about Christ the word. Are we together? &gt;&gt; That is the only gift that you can give him is to give him yourself. &gt;&gt; Give yourself to God because he has already given you his gift. &gt;&gt; That's the only one thing you owe God and that is yourself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So all your Christmas hat, your Christmas jacket, your Christmas shoes that you buying it for yourself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How can you buy a gift for yourself on somebody birthday? &gt;&gt; Okay, let's let's just go ahead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Watch the gift they brought him. Identify what they thought he was. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the gift of the three wise men. They give identify what they thought he was. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They brought him gold, frank incense and my gold is deity. Frank incense speak of service and murd is death. God deity in service to die. For what? Deity in service of God for death. Jesus was deity in service for death to redeem the word. But what did the word do? They refuse it. &gt;&gt; They reject it. And I say there to us today, the thing that we bring to him identify what our thought is about him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the thing we bring to church, the thing we bring to him. &gt;&gt; Our attitude to him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The thing we bring to him shows our thoughts &gt;&gt; about him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand what I mean? If you believe with all of your heart, every word of God, you uh identify it by giving all that you have to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All that you have to eat. I I tell you, I You know when when the moment you start to talk about giving, the first thing that comes to people mind is money. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I you know I had a a friend a coworker at work and one time uh uh you know we were talking he says he says man when I when I realized that uh you know uh all the offering they were not sending it to heaven I stopped giving. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said sir but whoever taught you that they use our currency in heaven. Who taught you that? You say yeah that thing you know because just being from small you know you know you know you know his mom is a preacher you know mom will carry on to church but that thing just hit me when I realized that they were not sending the money to heaven. I said, "Well, but did you ever thought how they were paying the bills, how they were sustaining the church? You ever thought about that?" Well, no, I didn't think about that. Well, yeah, because that is the first thing. But I would tell you this morning because I can take you back to Deuteronomy, &gt;&gt; you know. And what Deuteronomy says that even your even your offering must be brought to the place where God will put his need. &gt;&gt; That's what it says. &gt;&gt; Your tithe and offering must be brought to the place where God will will put his need. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so you will realize that uh if a man if a man was not uh uh uh in order with H HIS LIFE was not in order, he could not even bring a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you see it's is it's A PRINCIPLE TO SHOW US THAT GOD WANT OUR LIFE before what we give. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; HE WON OUR LIFE. THAT IS THE MAJOR THING. THAT'S WHERE THE REVELATION IS. If we can uh if we can I mean we can we can get all into the to the to the giving scheme, you know, and and all of that, you know, uh and and that is beautiful. But you realize that uh uh even in that area, you will struggle. Yes, &gt;&gt; it is not only BECAUSE YOU ARE STRUGGLING IN THE FACT THAT YOUR finance is not enough, you know, you're not making too much money, you can't pay your bill. No, where actually you are struggling is in your heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MUCH OUR ECONOMY is and how much money we have, IF YOU HAVE A REVELATION THAT GOD IS IN CONTROL, YOU HAVE A REVELATION that he is MY PROVIDER. YOU HAVE A REVELATION THAT THE BIRTH THAT I BRING, HE gave it to me, then I can BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING THAT CONCERN ME, he he will take care of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Like I've always says, if we cannot give him a a dime out of a dollar, &gt;&gt; you will not give him dollar out of 10. &gt;&gt; And wouldn't you would not be able to give him 10 out of 100. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you cannot give him dam out of a dollar. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it is it is not it is not uh you knowh uh you know all of that what what actually he want this morning the thing that we bring to him identify our thoughts about him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in this age that we have people have some of the ridiculous thoughts about church. Some of the things that we will not do at our work, we expect it to be done in church. You will not stay home from work without telling your supervisor. &gt;&gt; But you stay from church and you want the pastor to find out why you stay from church. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Some of the things that we will not do, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Read the book of Malachi. &gt;&gt; That was the very same thing that Malachi rebuked the people of. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The thing that you WILL NOT DO TO YOUR GOVERNOR, &gt;&gt; that's what you are doing in the house of God. &gt;&gt; It just show the kind of a poor revelation you have. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know people think that church is a club that we need you. We don't see the sense that &gt;&gt; you know we need God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You think that the church need you so we must be begging you. We must be we must be running after you. Oh, we didn't see you in church today. I mean, when are you coming to church? What kind of a church is that &gt;&gt; preacher brother? Come on. &gt;&gt; Stay away from work one week. Don't tell your supervisor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Stay away one week. Don't tell your supervisor. &gt;&gt; No. BUT YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT BECAUSE you think your LIFE DEPEND ON the work. &gt;&gt; Your life don't depend on church. That's the way you think. &gt;&gt; But you get it reverse. &gt;&gt; You get it reverse. You are driving your car in reverse. &gt;&gt; That's right. the things we bring to him. It shows the thoughts that we have about him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, let them let it let it correct you. The deacons talk to you. Uh you know, you you show an attitude, a job. Yes, sir. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never knew you. I'm sorry. YOU ARE SO AFRAID NOW THAT THEY COMING TO FIRE YOU. &gt;&gt; How are you surviving? Where was that joy when you were born? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHERE WAS THE JOY WHEN YOU WERE BORN? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We So we we just we we am this morning. &gt;&gt; What am I preaching about? How did I got here? &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How did I got here? Praise the Lord. that we just uh take the kind of attitude that we have and the kind of a mind we we we we are so stuck with and all the thing that Facebook is feeling us with. &gt;&gt; And that's how we look at the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Where is your heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how we look at the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't pay your taxes. see what IRS will do for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we begin we when we start to have the revelation that this is God's community on earth, let me tell you, you don't come to church to serve God. No, there is nowhere in the Bible where the Bible say come to church to serve God. &gt;&gt; No. Paul said, "Don't forsake the assembly of yourself together." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We come to encourage ourself. &gt;&gt; We come to share our burdens and pray for one another. That's what church is for. You serve God when you are out there. &gt;&gt; That's where you serve God. &gt;&gt; When you serve people, the way you live with people, &gt;&gt; the way you treat people, the way you think about people in the street, Are we together? &gt;&gt; We come to churches say, "Brother Johnny, you can do it no matter what you're dealing with." Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just just so we encourage one another. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why when you come to church, you see certain brothers, it lift up your heart. If a person was coming all the time, you don't see them. It it throw what's wrong? What's wrong with this brother? You know, it it throw that thing in your mind. You're thinking what's what's going on with this person? You think about it that way. Why? Because our coming together encourage us &gt;&gt; that we are in this together. &gt;&gt; Because right here, every one of us in our best behavior. How are we serving God? You're sitting quietly. I'm doing the talking. &gt;&gt; So, how are you serving God? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How are we serving God? It's out there. When you go through those doors, &gt;&gt; the way we relate to the people around us, &gt;&gt; like a prophet would say, when you serve your husband, you are serving God. When you serve your wife, you are serving God. When you serve your children, you are serving God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the apostle Paul would says when you are working he says do your job as unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; AT WORK DO IT AS unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't do it only I just here for the paycheck. &gt;&gt; I'm just here for the paycheck. If it were that because of the paycheck, I would have left this place. &gt;&gt; That's not a that's not a Christian attitude. &gt;&gt; The Bible says as unto the Lord, serve your master as unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; THAT THAT'S HOW OUR SERVICE TO God is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Merry Christmas. You see, that's the reason why, look, I I I'm telling you people, I enjoy this little church. Praise the Lord. I, you know, I I I come I come when I come here during the week, I just enjoy myself. Praise the Lord. Whatever that I get my hands on to do, you know, I push the snow back so the God that is coming to clean will clean the place. I throw salt all over the place. Praise the Lord. you know my my my my convert that is in this building every time she sees she come around pastor how are you I'm doing well you know I was listening to your message all the time I mean you were really on it &gt;&gt; you know every time she sees me she comes back and greet me praise the Lord because I realize that's that's that's what I should do I'm your I'm your seven &gt;&gt; I should save you &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; amen I don't feel big to watch the Bible bathrooms. &gt;&gt; This is the toilet. Uh something fell off. I was around yesterday. Lie on the floor is through the back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm not I I do those things. I do it because oh my god tell you some of my secrets. Praise the Lord. I enjoy doing it. &gt;&gt; I receive God's mercy that way. That's the way I I I feel his mercy. &gt;&gt; I have a friend that's right in one in a group home somewhere. I don't even know the place. I stopped by the last time there. Uh uh as soon as he sees now my car is pulled so I don't know how you going to find me &gt;&gt; but as soon as he see my car parking down there he comes when he look around you look he don't see no light he goes to the office window he looks I know straight he's the one I said what what are you doing now this time oh no you know I was just coming to this place I just want to get a sandwich to eat and I saw your car you know he comes in and we talk a little say, "Can I get a dollar or two?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I mean, he's he's an elderly. He he comes sometime. He would just sit out there, you know, he's an elderly guy. I mean, whatever he's dealing with in his body, but uh where were we? What was I preaching? Now I've got I've got into the water. I've got in the alley. I can find my way out. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But that's what Christmas is. Amen. Lending a giving a helping hand, bringing smile to someone. Just sending a text of appreciation to someone. Praise the Lord. Something that would just brighten their day. Make them know that you are thinking on them. But this infant church is already here on earth. People &gt;&gt; this was announced 1962 1963. The seals were open. The revelation came out. I mean even the people in the tabernacle were not even understanding this that brother Brandham was preached. But this this has lingered out and here we are. Here we are. Is the revelation, the revelation of Jesus Christ. We sing that song over and over. Something keeps holding me. &gt;&gt; Is that revelation of Jesus Christ that is holding you? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Trying to get you to your purpose. &gt;&gt; That revelation is holding you. Just like THAT THAT THAT MAN HELD THAT baby a dead little boy. He had it in the cold. I promise my little girl adore she's already dead but HE'S NOT CONSIDERING THAT SHE'S dead because he made a promise. &gt;&gt; He's trying to fulfill it. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I HAVE FAITH PROMISE. I don't want to fail at this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; MAYBE I WILL SEE HER IN THE STREET. MAYBE I WILL SEE HER IN HIS COURT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; TRYING HIS BEST UNTIL HE DIE TRYING his best. &gt;&gt; And I hope I die trying my best. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can major on my flaws and my weaknesses, &gt;&gt; all my mistakes. &gt;&gt; I want to die trying my best. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If there's one thing that this Christmas must taught us, he went to Calvary, DIED TRYING HIS BEST to convince us that there's a land beyond the river. HE DIED TRYING HIS best to let the world know that he is he was the gift of God. &gt;&gt; For God so loved the word that he gave his only begotten son. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, when the wise man saw the star, let me close with this. I'm closing. But Dick say I say I'm closing. I didn't say I close. I'm closing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The wise men they brought their gifts that identify their revelation. When those five stars were lined up, GOD ALSO LINED UP FIVE supernatural gift for us. THE FIVE SUPERNATURAL THINGS THAT WILL happen at the opening of the word speaking scor into existence. &gt;&gt; Amen. PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; THAT GOD WILL BRING YOU TO THIS PLACE ONE OF THESE DAYS &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK THE DESIRE OF YOUR HEART. LORD, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THOSE THINGS WAS SISTER had a children receiving salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEIR FATHER DIED AND AND THE DIFFERENT THINGS that they went through. You know, you think about that people. Let me tell you, there are a lot of things that happen around church that if we will ever make it, it will be the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It will be the grace of God. THE SAME GRACE THAT SAVED us will be the same grace that would take us from here. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THOSE BOYS TRYING TO HELP THEIR FATHER IN THE FIELD AND THEY WATCH a tractor run over him. I BELIEVE THEY CRY, "OH GOD, SAVE DADDY. OH GOD, SAVE DADDY." &gt;&gt; You know, SOMETIMES WHEN YOU NEED GOD, THE THE THE MOMENT THAT THAT THE TIME THE DESPERATE need you have for God, &gt;&gt; it looks like WHEN HE DON'T SHOW UP AT THAT TIME, it looks like he does not exist. It throw them into &gt;&gt; a place where they didn't wanted to hear nothing about God. &gt;&gt; Talk about a prophet, they laugh about it. Sometime those things happen in church. &gt;&gt; It happen in church. &gt;&gt; People go through things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are not there yet, don't don't don't think that it does not happen or it will not happen to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; People go through things that throw them in some form of depression or another, &gt;&gt; especially our young people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS STRIPPING THEM OF ALL THEIR YOUTHFULNESS, &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T HAVE FRIENDS, THEY CAN'T HAVE THIS, THEY CAN'T HAVE THAT, AND WE BASH THEM AND BASH THEM AND BASH THEM. It gets to a place sometimes a trick of their mind and it gets into a cycle. It does not mean that they are lost &gt;&gt; but they get confused. &gt;&gt; They are trapped. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THOSE BOYS WERE GOING THROUGH. They saw their father dying right right before their eyes. THE BREAD WINNER OF THEIR HOUSE, the man that was supposed to lead him to manhood. Where is God? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he had a mama that didn't give up on him. WHEN SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. ASK WHAT YOU WILL. &gt;&gt; PRAISE the Lord. &gt;&gt; A PROPHET OF GOD SAY, "ASK WHAT YOU WILL." YOU ASK FOR MONEY. IF IT DON'T DROP ON YOUR LAP, &gt;&gt; then I'm a false prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God just drop it in her heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD JUST DROP IT IN HER HEART. SHE SAID, "The salvation of my boys Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's ONE OF THOSE GIFTS THAT THE FIVE STARS BROUGHT FOR US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT WE MUST NOT GIVE UP THE THINGS WE ARE GIVING TO GOD. THE PEOPLE WE ARE PRAYING FOR, THE ONES WE ARE BELIEVING GOD FOR. DON'T GIVE UP ON THEM. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Don't give up on them. It was in the stars. Five stars. Five supernatural manifestation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRAND SAID WHEN PEOPLE WERE SICK, there is ambulance lying in MY PARKING LOT. PEOPLE LYING IN THE KITCHEN OR ON THE FLOOR and God will give me a word for a little fish. He says he says the the little things in our lives matters to God. Wow. &gt;&gt; The little things, little insignificant things in our life &gt;&gt; matters to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said THAT WAS THE REPRESENTATION of the little fish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The fourth ONE WAS THE ROLLING BACK OF THE STORM. &gt;&gt; God can roll your storm back. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHATEVER THAT IS STORMING YOUR HOME AND STORMING YOUR LIFE AND BLASTING YOUR MIND, GOD IS ABLE TO ROLL THAT STORM BACK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The fifth one, before the doctor hands would touch. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sister me. BEFORE THE DOCTOR HANDS WOULD TOUCH SISTER, that same God IS THE SAME GOD OF DIVINE HEALING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THOSE FIVE SUPERNATURAL THING WERE LINED UP WITH THE FIVE STARS ANNOUNCED INTO the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT THERE IS A LIVING GOD THAT IS IN YOUR MIDST. &gt;&gt; WE ARE SERVING A LIVING GOD, &gt;&gt; NOT A DEAD ONE. &gt;&gt; He's a living God. &gt;&gt; He's real. He's real and he's in our midst. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH. &gt;&gt; My my my &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have a I have a little story &gt;&gt; and every time I think about that story, it puts my mind to the place and sometimes I use that many times to to talk to people. YOU SEE THE MESSENGER OF THE FIRST COMING OF THE LORD JESUS, John the Baptist, that was a second curse into Jesus. That man Jesus SAID OF EVERY MAN THAT IS BORN OF WOMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; There was none like John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; John never had an easy people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN I THINK ABOUT JOHN THE BAPTIST LIFE, JOHN WAS BORN IN A time his parents were already old. &gt;&gt; He was born IN A TIME HE WAS BORN RIGHT INTO SCANDER. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE MARY IS SAYING THAT SHE HAS SEEN an angel IS BECOMING A SCANDAL AROUND THE Sanhedrin's council. &gt;&gt; JOHN FATHER HAS SAVE THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why sometimes church without God &gt;&gt; can be wicked &gt;&gt; to the people that served them. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE MUST PUT CHRIST IN CHRISTMAS. WE MUST BRING CHRIST BACK TO THE CHURCH. WE MUST PUT CHRIST in our home. Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you have a church without Christ, &gt;&gt; you will feed it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; HE HIS FATHER SAVED THE CHURCH. THE BIBLE SAID HE WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS AT HIS POST OF DUTY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOT THE PLACE READY. HE SENT THE PLACE BEFORE THE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. WHEN ZACHARIAS WAS CONNECTED TO MARY, &gt;&gt; when he was connected to Mary, &gt;&gt; WHEN JOHN WAS BORN, ZACHARIAH TONGUE WAS LOOSE &gt;&gt; TO TELL THE PEOPLE THAT IT WAS AN ANGEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY ALREADY HAD A PROBLEM WITH A GIRL SAYING AN ANGEL MEET HER. NOW SAY ZACHARIAH HAS PUT HIMSELF IN THE SCANDAL. JOHN NEVER SAW THE GLORY OF HIS father ministering &gt;&gt; before HE WILL COME TO THE AGE OF UNDERSTANDING THINGS. &gt;&gt; His father was kicked out of the temple. Praise the Lord. HISTORY WILL TELL US THAT JOHN WENT IN THE WILDERNESS AT 9 YEARS OLD. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. IF HIS FATHER SERVED THE COUNSEL ALL OF HIS YEARS, ISN'T THAT THE COUNSEL THAT'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE care of this boy? &gt;&gt; His his mom and dad died when he was just a little child. &gt;&gt; Most of the time we like to make it spiritual. The spirit of the Lord led him in the wilderness at 9 years old. 9 years old. Let my baby 9 years old. I know what 9 years, which I do. She's almost. Praise the Lord. Do you see WHY HE CAME OUT OF THE WILDERNESS WITH WITH SUCH A LIFE OF COMPLEX? YOU SEE WHY HE CAME OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND HE WAS SO HARD ON THE PEOPLE. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he could HE COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THESE VERY SAME PEOPLE THAT INTREATED HIS FATHER THEY SPOKE BAD WORDS ABOUT HIS FATHER &gt;&gt; ZACHCHARIAH IS DECEIVED HE HAS AN ILLUSION HE HAS FOLLOWED OUT THAT LITTLE GIRL MARY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ANGELS OR ALL OF THOSE THINGS PUT THOSE things into perspective people &gt;&gt; THE VERY PEOPLE THAT REJECTED HIS FATHER NEVER GAVE HIM A GOOD RETIREMENT. HE DIED WITH A BROKEN HEART because he served the people faithfully. When the people SUPPOSED TO BE REJOICING IN his blessing that he HAD RECEIVED A CHILD IN HIS OLD AGE, THEY turned against him &gt;&gt; and they kick him out. John as a little child went into the wilderness went almost like homeless almost like homeless that's the reason why it took almost 30 years because God had to get his attention little by little before he will finally understand that he had a ministry. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes when young people sit in church, praise the Lord, the least we can do for them as others, give them kind words. &gt;&gt; Try to talk to them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because you are shouting amen. Amen. Some sometime they don't understand the things we preach. It goes over their head. But here they sit down here. FINALLY, WHEN JOHN WILL SAY, "BEHOLD THE LAMB THAT TAKE AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD." For him to see a vision AND SEEING THE VISION COMING TO PASS, HE WILL THINK THAT HIS LIFE IS HAVING SOME sense of meaning. &gt;&gt; It will not be too long he will be sitting in prison. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly. PRAISE HIM. ALL OF THOSE things that he went through being a child started to come back to him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's that's what praising does. &gt;&gt; It makes you to remember. You you force yourself to remember. Amen. Cuz you don't have no distraction there. So you force yourself to remember. You will really meditate. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of those things come back to me. Put it in perspective people. Put it in perspective. You have really not been hurt by religion. You have not been hurt when people use hurtful words and not understanding that you are a human. Not understanding that you have lot through your That's the reason why this place is not a social gathering. &gt;&gt; This is a community &gt;&gt; where we must come together with common values &gt;&gt; and do what we can do to make it better. &gt;&gt; Don't expect for it to be better. &gt;&gt; I expect for them to do this. I expect for them to do this. What are you doing about what you expect? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's make it better. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And John will die falling right back into the depression he dealt with as a child because now he's SENDING HIS DISCIPLES. GO AND FIND OUT. IS HE THE ONE? HE WAS THE VERY ONE THAT SAID, "BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD." &gt;&gt; Why will he now say, "Go and find out. &gt;&gt; Something has happened to him." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Something has happened &gt;&gt; to this man. He never had an easy life. Yet he will be the man that Jesus would say of all men born of women of all men born of women. I was listening to brother Brand a few days ago. He was talking about Raha. I don't know. I don't know why why I get connected to those things. But it means a whole lot to me because because you see many times we preach, we read quotes and we don't bring things into perspective. &gt;&gt; You know why the Bible says Elijah was a man of lack passion. &gt;&gt; It's so you can be able to bring your life &gt;&gt; into perspective. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That when you were reading about those people, they were not angels. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN YOU PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE, &gt;&gt; then it hunts you. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said that was not a word of life for her. She had a high life. Her family could in the fall so they had to put her into the street &gt;&gt; so she can take care of them. But down in her heart &gt;&gt; was a predestinated sight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Many has has had hard life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Many people have had high life. Glory be to God. Amen. When people who take the ministry for for pleasure in whatever whatever they take it for. Praise the Lord. Their measure in in in their wealth and in and every other thing God say have men on the scene. My brother Brandon said they don't even have shoes on their feet. I don't have shoes on their feet. I was just following uh my my friend Ruben Daniel, the brother that told you in South Africa that had that uh uh cancer where it took up part of his stomach and uh I I saw him on on YouTube. So I said, "Wow, Ruben is preaching." So I went to look at there. What happened was that u he he went to to dedicate a church where a young man in wheelchair he's he's you know he can use his feet have moved to the outsetting part of of the country and an asker there in in Johannesburg in his wheelchair going from places to places witnessing. He started the church there and called brother Ruben to dedicate the church and and and and pray for the first deacons. And as he testified, he says, "But Ruben and his wife treated me like parents. Nobody would even allow me in their home before allow me on their pit." Ruben saw something in me. It just it just moved my heart &gt;&gt; in which here &gt;&gt; doing the best that he can do for &gt;&gt; if you would if you just if you just think that God has been so good to you. No matter what you are dealing with, there are people that are in worse condition than you. &gt;&gt; If you take time and pray for those people, your situation will get better. &gt;&gt; Instead of just sitting down and being sorrowful for yourself, think about people that don't have the the common privilege that you have &gt;&gt; and pray for them. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's put Christ back in Christmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's put him back in our homes and back in our heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz the manure he's born in is in our heart. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think about that all the time. I think about that all the time. Sometimes we get to the place and and and one of the the common question that is always asked, you know, why why are pastor children, you know, uh sometimes the way they are? Because sometimes uh you know, it's very it's very easy to look at it like, oh yeah, you know, the devil is attacking them to destroy their their uh their father ministry. Yeah, you you are partly right. Just partly &gt;&gt; right. You are just part some of the things there is that they are children. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And some of the true factor there is that sometimes we get so consumed worrying about people issues and we don't even think about our own children. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. we get so wrapped up in that &gt;&gt; you know but uh you know uh I'm just trying to bring certain things to you so so you can be able to to be able to see and and understand when people are going through things don't be so quick to speak out &gt;&gt; don't be so quick to criticize &gt;&gt; our expression will be oh God, what went wrong? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What went wrong? How? Because when you create that question in your mind, that question will give you a constant desire to be seeking in prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord, I wonder what is HE DEALING WITH? WHAT IS she dealing with? It will give you a constant desire. But if you if you just call it they backslided, they were not believers. They don't have the Holy Ghost. You gave yourself a definite reason that you cannot cross. You gave yourself a definite reason that you cannot cross because you to you they don't have the Holy Ghost. So they I mean they are not elect. They are serpency. So you can never go beyond that. &gt;&gt; So there will not be a desire in you to pray. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; How many times we ever think about somebody that you knew that was serving the Lord that is not serving the Lord anymore? How many times you ever thought about them to share the word of prayer? &gt;&gt; We don't do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. We become so judgmental in our minds. &gt;&gt; It looks like I become an evangelist this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I Am I yelling at you? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to make your Christmas merry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; Merry Christmas. I'm trying to make your Christmas merry, but I mean church, we don't know how long &gt;&gt; we're going to be here. &gt;&gt; We don't know how long we going to be here. &gt;&gt; We are facing another year. We don't know what that year brings. &gt;&gt; We don't know what that year is bringing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This afternoon, let's go to the manger. Let's go and look for Christ to the manger. Let's go to our hearts and look for Christ. Let's go there to the manger and sing, "Oh, how I love Jesus because he first." Let's go to the manger and think that God should love a sinner such as &gt;&gt; that's what I want us to do. Let's go to the manger. That will help us to put Christ back in Christmas. Musicians, you can come up. We'll preach to you another day. Let's go back to the manger of our heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me.

And there are a lot of things of our past of our upbringing that haunt us and and a lot of things that we have experienced in this life. The disappointment, the hurt and all of that. But yet God choose to bring his word. &gt;&gt; To my heart and he choose to bring his word to your heart. &gt;&gt; He chose for Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ to be born in you. Not just a head knowledge, he can touch your heart. What do you think this afternoon of what God is doing in your life? Are you satisfied? Do you want more of God? Are you appreciating what he's doing in your life? Are you recognizing the changes he's bringing? Oh, let's go to Bethlehem this morning. It's a different kind of a Beth hand. Let's go down there.
